Foreword
Want a demo? You’re gonna have to wait! Wow, things sure have changed. When I worked 
for an up-and-coming CRM start-up in 1999, our account managers would actually use 
the demo of the software itself as a negotiating tool. The client would request a demo of 
the software and our account managers would, of course, agree to that, but not before 
they were able to negotiate something in return such as an introduction to the senior 
stakeholders, including the VP Sales and/or CEO. Today, I’m the “account manager” at 
my company, Gloo, and I can’t imagine using a demo in that way. As a matter of fact, no 
one asks me for a demo anymore! Why? Because they’ve typically already subscribed 
online to a full trial of the software, maybe added some data to it, and played in the 
system a bit. That is, they’ve given themselves a demo! And all this before I’ve even 
spoken to them. By the time they engage with me, they are often close to making up their 
mind as to which system they’re going to go with and are just looking to us for guidance at 
this point.
I’m sure you have a similar story to the one above as to how sales in your industry 
have changed since the Internet has put more information in the hands of your 
customers. Now put cloud computing on top of this, and I’d be willing to bet that not 
only your sales process has changed but so has the type of person you seek to hire as a 
salesperson. If your people and process has changed, has your technology kept up with 
that change? Whether your business has a CRM system already or not, one thing is for 
sure: your approach to selling has been forced to adapt.
When Ali worked with Gloo a few years ago, the first thing we did was to spend 
time understanding clients’ sales process. While our client’s and our own sales process 
has changed, our approach to understanding that process has not. Ali’s skills at not only 
listening to the client but even anticipating what they are trying to articulate enabled 
us to gain a firm understanding of the client’s processes, document their processes into 
sometimes elaborate flowcharts, and documents that then translate these things into 
the foundation for their CRM system. Ali acted as a go-between the client and technical 
and nontechnical resources here at Gloo. You could say Ali was the glue among us all 
here at Gloo!
We still start all our clients with Zoho CRM as their first application. As you’ll see 
in Ali’s book, it is the hub from which other Zoho applications spoke out. Having said 
that, Zoho offers so much more than CRM nowadays, and our clients want access to 
those applications that come with pre-built integration to Zoho CRM. The market has 
changed as businesses demand more integration capabilities among applications and 
Zoho has responded with not only nearly 40 à la carte business applications (continuing 
to add more!), but they offer three bundles of Zoho CRM Plus, Zoho Workplace, and Zoho 
Finance Plus – and didn’t stop there! You can now purchase all Zoho applications in the 
Zoho One bundle.

■ Foreword
xviii
One thing that hasn’t changed since CRM emerged in the late 1990s is that despite 
its user-friendly interface, it’s a complex machine and you’re going to need help setting it 
up properly for your business. Reading all the “online help” files in the world would still 
require you to decide where to start and where to go next. Engaging with a consultancy 
like Gloo allows our team to guide you through it all. However, if you like the DIY 
approach, Ali has done the heavy lifting for you by writing a step-by-step guide that will 
help you begin to walk through the maze of CRM. This book sets a great foundation for 
you to build on, and I highly recommend it no matter how you approach your project!
Wishing you all the best in your business and your CRM project,

Introduction
Before I started working on this book, I had a look at the first book I wrote on  
Zoho, Foundation Zoho: Work and Create Online (Apress, 2009), and I was amazed by 
how far we have come since then.
Technology has advanced so much in less than a decade that 2009 feels like ages ago. 
Smartphones, big data, Blockchain, 3D printing, civilian drones, artificial intelligence, 
and Internet of Things (IoT), have all graduated lab life and entered our daily lives.
However, none of these technologies (yet) have had as great of an impact on our 
civilization as cloud computing. This may sound like a very bold claim, but bear with me 
for a moment.
Many of us nowadays keep our collection of documents on Dropbox or Google Drive, 
kill time (or do something more productive) on Instagram and Facebook, and rely on 
CRMs (Customer Relationship Management systems) to manage our sales processes, take 
notes on Wunderlist, and manage projects on Trello.
Back in 2009, cloud computing was a relatively new phenomenon, and many 
companies, small, or large, were too hesitant to even give it a try. High speed Internet was 
not as ubiquitous as it is now and mobile computing was at its infancy. Heck, Blackberry 
was the king of the smartphones.
All these are courtesy of some SaaS (software as a service) on a public cloud 
platform. Remove cloud computing from the equation, and you won’t be able to even 
play Pokémon Go on your smartphone.
Eight years later, Internet connectivity has doubled,1 and almost half of the 
population of the planet are connected. Today, it is practically impossible to go through a 
full day (sometimes a full hour) without using the amazing apps and services that run on 
the cloud. But what is cloud computing anyway?
Cloud Computing
The Internet, as it is referred to as the Cloud in IT jargon, powers today’s civilization.
Why on earth the IT crowd would use the word “cloud” as a metaphor for the 
Internet, you ask? Since the old days, it was common when someone wanted to refer to 
a big collection of servers (i.e., server farm) in an IT diagram, they would simply draw 
a cloud to hide the complexity and just connect other machines to it (see Figure 1 for a 
rough idea).

﻿ ■ Introduction
xx
Figure 1.  The Cloud
Cloud computing, to put it simply, is to use the computing power of the cloud in 
combination, or instead of, with the power of the computer on your desk or the one 
in your pocket. As trivial as this definition may sound, cloud computing offers unique 
features, such as the following:
• 
Availability - All you need is an Internet connection to connect to 
any cloud anywhere.
• 
Performance - The immense power of thousands of servers is at 
your disposal.
• 
Elasticity - You could only use and pay for the computing power 
and storage you need for the task in hand, scale up when you 
need more resources, and scale back down when you don’t.
• 
Multi-Tenancy - Multiple tenants (apps, services, users, etc.) can 
use the power of a cloud, allowing resources to be used efficiently 
and costs to be divided between such tenants.
• 
Security - Clouds can be way more secure than your local 
computer, or local server. Since cloud providers have many more 
resources to allocate safeguarding their infrastructure, which in 
turn keeps the tenants more secure.
• 
Reliability - Your data is backed up and is available across 
multiple physical locations, minimizing the risk of data loss to 
almost zero.
• 
Maintenance - Cloud users (tenants) need not worry about 
upgrading servers, power outages, or software updates, all of 
which are done for you by the cloud provider.
• 
Cost - Of course, all of the above contribute to a major benefit of 
cloud computing, which is lowering the cost across the board.

﻿ ■ Introduction
xxi
In general, there are three types of clouds:
• 
public, which as the name suggests, are publicly available for 
everyone to utilize, such as Amazon AWS;
• 
private cloud, which is only accessible to an organization or 
organizations owning that cloud; and
• 
hybrid cloud, which obviously, is a combination of public and 
private clouds.
■
■Note  I stay shallow with these definitions as this book is not about the science of 
cloud computing. The main audience for this book is businesspeople that I can bet are least 
interested in the voodoo behind the technology and merely want to utilize tools that can 
make their lives easier.
The Importance and Scale of Cloud Computing 
As mentioned before, it is safe to say that anything digital nowadays runs on some sort of 
cloud infrastructure. Our civilization depends on the cloud, an industry that is poised to 
grow to $270 billion by the year 2020.2
In their 2009 report, “Cloud Computing Forecasting Change”,3 Deloitte called cloud 
computing the “next technological disruption to transform enterprise IT delivery and 
services.” It is a brilliant piece, which counts cloud computing along with social networks, 
mobile, and Internet of Things (IoT) among the major disruptors and contributors to the 
maturity of the Internet.
Deloitte’s prediction about cloud computing was impressively accurate, except that 
Deloitte and many other experts did not quite predict, however, what was the great impact 
and massive adoption of cloud computing on small- to medium-size businesses (SMBs).
In January 2016, RightScale surveyed 1,060 technical professionals (627 from SMBs) 
about how their adoption of cloud computing.4 The results are, astonishingly, a testament 
to how successful cloud computing has been in recent years:
• 
77% of the SMBs are using cloud computing in some capacity in 
their organizations;
• 
Only 9% said they have no plans for cloud adoption;
• 
Cloud security is no longer the top challenge, dethroned now by 
lack of resources and expertise;

﻿ ■ Introduction
xxii
• 
Cloud users leverage six clouds on average; and
• 
Amazon AWS leads the pack while Microsoft Azure is growing is 
market share as major cloud infrastructure providers.
At its core, cloud computing allows organizations (and individuals) to harness the 
virtually unlimited computing and storage power of hundreds of thousands of servers 
located in a myriad of data centers across the world.
It is, with the immense power of cloud at our fingertips, possible that even the 
smallest companies can analyze terabytes of data at will, fast, and cheap, to create 
massively useful applications and stay ahead of the competition.
Companies such as Uber, Airbnb, Waze, Instagram, Snapchat, and hundreds of 
others whose apps you use on a daily basis all started small, writing their apps on top of 
cloud platforms. The start-up revolution in the past decade owes its success heavily to the 
availability, affordability, and scalability of cloud platforms such as Amazon AWS, Google 
AppEngine, and Microsoft Azure.
Now with the next wave of computing, mainstream AI (Artificial Intelligence), 
upon us, companies such as Amazon are working to make it possible for the software 
developers and cloud users to have access to sophisticated AI capabilities on the cheap.5
The Service Economy
Cloud computing allows various services and applications to be implemented on it. This 
allows a “service” model in which virtually everything can be offered as a service that is 
implemented and distributed on some sort of a cloud. This concept is called Everything 
as a Service or X as a Service (XaaS).
Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) are two examples 
of what can be offered as a service in the cloud. But the most evident and most relevant to 
of all these to the end user (including you, dear reader) is Software as a Service (SaaS).
Let’s start with a real-life example.
A few years ago, if I needed Microsoft Office I had to pay full price for it just to buy 
and own the software before I could use it. A few hundred dollars wouldn’t break the 
bank, but now imagine if I wanted to have Office on all of my 15 workstations at work. 
Then I would have had to commit to a few thousand dollars only in basic software 
expenses. Plus, I would need to have IT take care of updates and patches (more expense) 
and then pay again for every major version released.
Today, with Office 365, not only do I always have access to the latest version of the 
Office software on my laptop, tablet, and phone with the same license, but also software 
updates run more automatically, I get to use 1TB (yes, that is 1000 Gigabytes) of free space 
on OneCloud (Microsoft’s cloud storage service), plus I have access to all my documents 
with editing capability in the browser.
That means I can leave my laptop at home and go on a vacation and edit my 
documents wherever there is a computer connected to the Internet. The best part? I pay a 
fraction of the cost on a monthly basis and I can cancel my contract anytime I want.

﻿ ■ Introduction
xxiii
The same applies for my company. I pay for a new monthly license when someone 
joins the team, and I cancel their contract when someone leaves.
This is the power of Software as a Service, or SaaS.
Unlike Microsoft Office, the majority of SaaS apps do not even need to be installed 
on your local computer. You can access them on a modern Internet browser on a desktop, 
laptop, tablet, or a mobile device.
The main advantage here is that SaaS doesn’t rely much on local computer power, 
so you don’t need a high-performance machine to run your massive CRM used by 2000 
employees across 3 continents. A $200 Chromebook6 will do the job too.
This book is about one of these SaaS applications, Zoho CRM. By the end of this 
book, you will have learned how you can transform your core business processes and stay 
productive using one of the best SaaS applications out there.
Zoho
Zoho, the company behind Zoho CRM and an impressive suite of 34 other SaaS apps 
has been in business since 1996. Launched back in November 2005, Zoho CRM is one of 
Zoho’s main offerings and arguably one of the most powerful and widely used ones.
■
■Note  You can read more about the history of Zoho and the brains behind it on their 
website: https://www.zoho.com/aboutus.html.
I have been an avid user of Zoho suite, especially Zoho CRM and Zoho Creator since 
2008. I have recommended Zoho to many friends, colleagues, and clients, all of whom 
have ended up becoming happy users. Powerful and easy-to-use apps, cost effectiveness, 
and good support have been some of the main factors that have kept thousands of 
organizations and individuals as loyal customers.
I hope this book helps you in deciding whether Zoho CRM is the right choice for you, 
and if it is, how to best utilize it in your day-to-day business.
Who Is This Book for?
This book is for everyone who cares about the growth of their business, or is fully, or 
partly, in charge of generating sales for their company. If you are the slightest serious 
about the current and future state of your business, CRM must be at the core of your 
business regardless of the size or the business model.
This book is for you if any of the following applies to you:
• 
still rely on your inbox, contact list app, or spreadsheets to 
manage your clients;
• 
are confused whether you need a CRM, or believe CRM is overkill 
for your operation;

How the Book Is Structured
The aim of this book is to provide you with a quick but effective guide to make Zoho CRM 
work for business, regardless of your business size. Chapters are focused on step-by-step 
guides to get you up and running in the subject matter discussed while giving you tips, 
always having the bigger picture in mind.

﻿ ■ Introduction
xxv
Throughout the book there are frequent references to the official documentation as 
it wouldn’t make sense to cover every single feature or capability of Zoho CRM in a single 
volume. Also, Zoho CRM, like any other cloud-based app, adds new features. It is a good 
habit to check the documentation often and stay up to speed with the developments.
Chapters of the Book
This book starts with a quick review of the Zoho suite of cloud-based apps in Chapter 1. 
This chapter will give you a brief idea of what other Zoho apps you could be using in your 
business.
In Chapter 2 we will take a step back and briefly look at the philosophy of CRM 
and how being on top your business processes is the key to success in implementing a 
successful CRM and also winning in business in the long run.
In Chapter 3, you will be setting up Zoho CRM from the ground up and cover 
essentials, such as user and email management.
Chapter 4 will take you through a complete journey of managing your sales pipeline, 
starting from mere leads, opportunities, and deals to conversions, reports, and forecasts. 
This chapter will show you the power and ease of use of Zoho CRM available to you, out 
of the box.
In Chapter 5, an important and often ignored aspect of a successful CRM system will 
be discussed: marketing. You will learn how Zoho CRM and other Zoho tools can offer a 
complete platform for your marketing efforts.
Chapter 6 is focused on extending the power of Zoho CRM by integrating it with 
other Zoho tools you learned about in Chapter 1.
More advanced topics will be covered in Chapter 7, focused more on features 
available exclusively to the top tiers of Zoho CRM. Role-based security, data sharing, and 
business process automation are among the topics discussed in the chapter.
How to Best Read This Book
If you are new to Zoho CRM, or the subject of CRM in general, I highly recommend you 
start from the beginning and follow the order of the chapters.
Unless you are experienced in business process and have done a few process 
maps in the past, make sure you go through Chapter 2. It is worth stopping at the end of 
Chapter 2 and learning more about business process improvement and business process 
management as it will help you set up a successful CRM for your organization. Even if you 
already have Zoho CRM installed for your business, it is worth going back and reviewing 
all processes for efficiency and effectiveness.
Chapters 3, 6, and 7 will particularly help you as a CRM manager, admin, or 
consultant to get the most out of Zoho CRM.
If you are sharing this book with your staff that will be using (not configuring or 
managing) CRM, ask them to focus on Chapter 4 and learn pipeline management, the 
Zoho CRM way.

CHAPTER 1
Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
Zoho Corporation has come a long way since they released their first SaaS apps, Writer 
and CRM, in 2005. Writer became the inseparable part of the productivity apps and CRM 
has grown to be of the core Zoho products today, serving millions of people around the 
world, yours truly included.
From the app diversity and completeness of offerings perspective, Zoho still holds a 
unique and strong position in the market while other companies have focused on one or 
a few products around a core objective.
There are many fantastic SaaS apps out there; however, none of which I used or read 
about offer the selection Zoho does. This allows users to use a wide range of apps with a 
single sign on, familiar look and feel, and interoperability (i.e., ability to exchange and use 
information between apps) out of the box.
Zoho apps are divided into six categories:
• 
Sales and Marketing
• 
Email and Collaboration
• 
Business Process
• 
Finance
• 
IT and Help Desk
• 
Human Resources
Now lets’ have a very quick look at each one of these categories and their respective apps.
■
■Note  This chapter merely scratches the surface and only provides a quick introduction 
of all members of the Zoho suite. The aim is to simply let you know what each app can do 
and leave further investigation to you to see whether one or more of these apps could help 
your business in any way.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet

Sales and Marketing Apps
The beating heart of any business, be it a home-based solo operation or a multinational 
conglomerate, is sales. Marketing, on the other hand, provides insights of the market 
and helps the business stay competitive while promoting its products and services to the 
world. The duo of Marketing and Sales is inseparable.
At the core of the Zoho suite, there are a number of apps that help you manage 
almost all your marketing and sales operations, all connected in the cloud.
CRM
Zoho CRM is arguably the star of the show with the highest number of users among Zoho 
apps. First released in 2005, CRM has grown from a small solution for beginners to a full-
fledged suite of an application competing with the industry leaders on many fronts.
The landscape of cloud-based CRM systems for small- and medium-size businesses 
is quite competitive, and there are formidable contenders in the market for every 
requirement and budget. The spectrum of SaaS CRM systems seems endless with 
open source and free offerings inside of the spectrum to full-fledged industry-specific 
solutions on the other hand. Bitrix24, Highrise, Hubspot, Infusionsoft, Insightly, Microsoft 
Dynamics, Pipedrive, Salesforce, and Sugar CRM are just a few that come to mind.
Well, this book is about Zoho CRM, so I know which one I will be recommending. 
That said, Zoho CRM may not be an answer for everyone. The premise of this book is that 
CRM is one of the most important, if not the most important tool, for your business. So, 
choosing the right one early on is crucial.
We will see how Zoho CRM addresses the requirements of a wide range of 
businesses. No matter if you are about to start your business in a month, currently 
bootstrapping, or you have been in business for the past 15 years managing a team 
of 100 salespeople across the globe, Zoho CRM can play a key role in managing and 
streamlining your marketing, sales, and client servicing efforts.
Zoho CRM offers five different editions with each packing a host of features suitable 
for different tastes and needs:
• 
Free edition: This edition offers the core modules such as Leads, 
Accounts, Contacts, Feeds, Documents, and mobile apps for up 
to 10 users, completely free of charge. This is a great way to start 
using Zoho CRM and upgrade to one of the paid editions as your 
business needs grow.
• 
Standard edition: In addition to the features available in the 
Free edition, you will have access to sales forecasting, reports and 
dashboards, document library, roles and profiles, mass email, call 
center connectors, and the ability to store up to 100,000 records of 
information.
• 
Professional edition: Similarly, the Professional edition offers 
all the features available in Free and Standard editions, plus 
email integration, social features, Google AdWords integration, 
workflow automation, inventory management, macros, and the 
ability to store unlimited records.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet

• 
Enterprise edition: This edition offers territory management, 
custom applications, custom buttons, workflow approval 
processes, page layouts, custom modules, and multiple currencies 
on top of the features available to the Professional edition.
• 
Ultimate edition: Last, but not least, the Ultimate edition adds 
even more features to make it the choice for larger organizations 
by throwing in sandbox, dedicated database cluster, priority 
support, advanced customization, advanced CRM analytics, and 
enhanced storage.
• 
CRM Plus: A recent addition to the CRM family, CRM Plus 
provides a more holistic approach to the traditional CRM system 
by combining the Enterprise edition with Zoho Campaigns, 
Desk, SalesIQ, Social, Projects, Survey, and Reports. This package 
allows users to centralize all their marketing, sales, and client 
servicing processes in one place without the need to jump 
between different platforms while saving considerably in direct 
and indirect costs.
■
■Note  Don’t worry if the modules and features mentioned above don’t make sense to 
you yet. We will be exploring almost all of these and use them in the examples of this book.
One of the areas Zoho CRM excels in, compared to the rivals, is a lower barrier to 
entry. Zoho CRM allows organizations of up to 10 employees to use it free of charge for 
sales management and later upgrade to a suitable paid edition as they need more features.
SalesInbox
A new addition to the Zoho suite, SalesInbox claims to be the first mailbox specifically 
designed for salespeople. According to Zoho, SalesInbox automatically organizes and 
prioritizes sales activities based on the sales pipeline and the stage in which each deal is. 
Using Zoho CRM criteria and rules features, SalesInbox could become a sales team’s best 
friend and put an end to the manual work between email and CRM.
■

SalesIQ
Zoho SalesIQ is a live chat solution that you can install and enable on your website to 
understand how visitors are interacting with your website in real time. It provides the visitors 
of your website with a familiar chat box placed on a corner of a webpage, so they can ask the 
sales or support team for help right away, or leave a message without leaving the page.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
4
You can use SalesIQ in conjunction with Zoho CRM and streamline the conversion 
of site visitors to prospects and ultimately buying customers. You should consider 
using SalesIQ if you are serious about capturing website visitors and turning them into 
customers or providing them with an interactive support channel.
The Free edition provides a decent set of features for you to get up and running with 
SalesIQ and later upgrade to one of the paid editions as your requirements grow.
■
■Reference  To learn more about SalesIQ, check out https://www.zoho.com/salesiq/help/.
Survey
Zoho Survey is a versatile tool to create online surveys and collect information from leads, 
prospects, or existing clients through a number of questions. You can dispatch surveys 
on your website, via mobile, or email and have the collected information from these 
channels store in the back end of Survey for later analysis.
Apart from standard survey building and distributing features, Zoho Survey 
automatically translates your surveys to 30 languages,1 and integrates well with email 
campaign apps such as Zoho Campaigns and MailChimp.
■
■Reference  To learn more about Zoho Survey, check out https://www.zoho.com/
survey/help/.
Campaigns
Another powerful app in Zoho’s arsenal is Campaigns, which offers all the tools you 
need to run successful email campaigns. It integrates well with other core Zoho apps, 
especially CRM, removing the need for third-party solutions in most cases.
Any modern organization needs to include email marketing in some shape or 
form in their business practice. Staying in touch with customers as well as prospects is 
crucial and Campaigns allows you to do just that. Despite social media being a major 
channel for connecting with your audience, email still remains the most effective way of 
communication and making sales happen.
Moreover, Campaigns offers email templates to get you up and running in minutes, 
plus email automation features to save you time and help your campaigns be more 
effective. It also provides you with detailed campaign reporting tools for monitoring and 
fine-tuning your efforts.
There is a free edition that allows storing up to 2,000 contacts and sending up to 
12,000 emails every month, so you have little excuse not to start sending that monthly 
newsletter that you have been delaying.

Sites
Unless you are visiting us from a planet where websites are so passé, you most probably 
have a website for your business and chances are that setting it up was not particularly a 
pleasant experience.
There was a time, not so long ago, that if you needed a visually bearable and decently 
functional website, you either needed to know some graphic design and also coding in 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (three of the main technologies behind every website), or you 
were at the mercy of web design companies and freelancers.
Times have changed for the better. Now everyone can build a usable website that 
looks modern, has most of the functionalities of a business website, and works on mobile 
phones as well. Services such as Weebly and Wix allow you to simply drag and drop 
building blocks on webpage skeletons and create a website ready for prime time. Zoho, 
too, happens to have their own website creation wizard: Zoho Sites.
Zoho Sites provides you with a platform to easily and quickly create a professional 
looking website with all the modern features you need, such as blogs, social, multimedia, 
e-commerce, and forms.
What is great is that you can do all of these without writing a single line of code or 
knowing what the difference between HTTP and HTML is.
Similar to other Zoho apps, you can start with a free plan, which offers enough 
features to get your website up and running; and opt for the paid, more feature-rich 
edition down the road.

Social
Social media management has become a part of the business routine of every forward-
thinking business. The immense power of social media allows you to delight prospects and 
clients by conveying a more personal and conversational message across multiple channels.
With a multitude of available social channels, however, it is hard to stay on top of 
publishing, monitoring, and responding to communications and staying productive and 
keeping your sanity in the process.
Fortunately, there are tools that help you manage social media, including Zoho 
Social, a capable social management tool. As of this writing, it allows you to centrally 
manage Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, and Instagram.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
6
You, and your team collaboratively, can publish on selected channels in one go, 
schedule messages, and monitor the performance of your messages. You can also listen 
to a social channel for what people are saying about your business or personal brand.
Another useful feature of Social is that it connects to Zoho CRM effortlessly and 
improves your productivity by providing you with contextual information about your 
social connections that may be on the CRM as well.
As usual, you can start with Zoho Social free of charge and upgrade to a paid plan 
when you need more features.
■

social/help/.
Contact Manager
Having a stand-alone app for managing your contacts may seem totally unnecessary, but 
don’t mistake Zoho Contact Manager for your average contact on your laptop or smartphone.
Contact Manager is actually a mini CRM allowing you to store and manage your contact 
database more effectively. You can share contacts within your team, define and assign 
tasks and follow-ups around contacts, manage deals related to contacts, and integrate your 
contact database with third-party services such as Google Apps or MailChimp.
If you believe you don’t need a full-fledged CRM solution, Contact Manager is a great 
way to start introducing order to your sales processes and centralizing valuable client 
information.

com/contactmanager/help.html.
Forms
Sometimes you need to collect information (online) from staff members, local 
community, clients, or your website visitors. To do so, you usually place some sort of a 
form on a webpage and encourage people to fill it up and submit it back to you.
However, not all forms are created equally. A form could be a simple Contact Us 
form, a long survey, or a complex form with automation workflows embedded for 
approval collection.
Traditionally, you or someone you hire would need web programming knowledge to 
create a form with such capabilities. With Zoho Forms, all you need to do is to drag and 
drop the form fields to a form, do some configurations, and then publish your modern-
looking form online for people to populate.
Zoho Forms allows you to quickly create functional forms, collect data, analyze the 
performance of your forms, and integrate them with Zoho apps, such as CRM; or third-
party apps, such as MailChimp, to automate tedious data entry tasks.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet

Again, you can start using Zoho Forms for free and upgrade to a paid edition as your 
requirements grow.
■
■Reference   To learn more about Forms, check out https://www.zoho.com/forms/
help/getting-started.html.
Motivator
Another newcomer to the Zoho suite, Motivator, is a sales activity management tool. 
It allows you to set sales targets and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) for your team, 
then it automatically analyzes sale information extracted from Zoho CRM to generate 
team member performance so that top salespeople are identified, acknowledged, and 
rewarded for their achievements.
Motivator has a feature called TV Channels, which allows you to show a leaderboard 
of your team performance on big screen TVs to motivate the team and encourage 
employees to compete in a healthy and rewarding environment.
■

Email and Collaboration Apps
To complement the core apps mentioned above, Zoho offers essential apps helping you 
manage your emails, projects, and documents, all improved for the Internet age and built 
from ground up to house modern features, such as social and collaboration features.
A number of other apps help you stay connected with your team and perform a 
number of essential tasks, such as safely storing your passwords in a centralized location.
Mail
Zoho Mail is Zoho’s answer to popular services such as Gmail, or Outlook.com. Although 
it may be much less popular compered other old timers, it is arguably one of the easiest 
to use and most feature-rich mail services in the market. Plus, it is ad-free. No more pesky 
ads in the sanctity of your inbox, ever.
In addition to the default web interface, Mail offers native smartphone apps for iOS 
and Android. You can also configure your favorite desktop or mobile email client (Spark, 
Outlook, Apple Mail, etc.) to check your Zoho account emails.
For business users, Zoho Mail integrates well with other Zoho services such as CRM. 
You can enjoy a single sign-on feature (one user account to use multiple services) and 
host one domain (i.e., yourwebsite.com), plus up to 25 users, all free of charge.

Notebook
Notetaking apps are everywhere. Many of them are average at best, and some of them are 
amazing. Good notetaking apps, such as Evernote and Microsoft OneNote can massively 
contribute to your productivity and help you minimize clutter.
Zoho offers its own version of a notetaking app, Zoho Notebook. It helps you 
organize your notes in a variety of formats: text, image, audio, checklists, and sketches. 
Notes offers a smartphone app for iOS and Android and a web clipper to capture content 
snippets while web surfing.
As of this writing, Zoho is yet to release a desktop version for Notebook, similar to 
what Evernote and Microsoft OneNote offer. As an avid Evernote user since 2009, I can 
see that Zoho Notebook shows promise, especially that it sports a pleasant and easy-to-
use interface and is 100% free.
■
■Reference   To learn more about Zoho Notebook, check out https://www.zoho.com/

Docs
Zoho Docs is a cloud-based storage space on steroids. You can store up to 5GB of files on a 
free edition of Docs, sync your files between devices, and use Zoho productivity suite (Writer, 
Sheet, and Show) to edit your documents in the browser or via their native mobile apps.
You can download the Zoho Docs desktop synchronization tool and your documents 
between a local folder and the Docs folder seamlessly.
If you are already a Google Drive or Dropbox user, you will feel right at home with 
Zoho Docs. The free edition of Docs offers features almost identical to the free edition of 
Google Drive; however, the paid edition gives more bang for your buck compared to the 
paid edition of the Google Drive.
■

Projects
With hundreds of free and paid options available in the market, finding the right project 
management tool that covers all the bases and doesn’t break the bank seems like a 
daunting job.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
9
Luckily, Zoho has a powerful project management tool called Zoho Project. It offers a 
decent combination of ease of use, features, and cost-effectiveness making it a formidable 
choice in the crowded market of cloud-based project management tools.
With Zoho Projects you can run multiple projects across multiple teams, share 
information with clients and outsourced teams easily, create time sheets for your 
projects, create Gantt charts and other complex reports, collaborate seamlessly with all 
the stakeholders, and mange project documents and in a central environment.
You have access to your projects via browser and native mobile apps. You can also 
connect Projects to other apps such as Zoho Books and Zoho Invoice as well as third-
party services such as Google Apps and Dropbox to maximize your productivity and 
efficiency.
Zoho Projects comes free of charge if you are planning to manage one project at 
a time. You can always upgrade to paid editions if you need more from your project 
management tool.
■
■Reference   To learn more about Zoho Projects, check out https://www.zoho.com/
projects/help/.
Connect
Zoho Connect allows you to create a private social network for your organizations. It 
provides you with all the basic tools and features to set up a social network for your team 
to connect and collaborate in real time.
By allowing you to create custom apps and integrate other services such as Zoho Projects, 
Zoho Docs, Google Drive, and Calendar services, Connect helps you streamline internal 
communications processes and keep employees engaged while boosting their productivity.
Similar to other Zoho apps, Connect offers a free edition for you to start building your 
organizational social network and later upgrade to paid plans if you need more features.

BugTracker
If you are into software engineering, you know that during the software life cycle, proper 
bug tracking is very important, and using a powerful bug tracking service will make the 
lives of everyone involved in the project easier.
Zoho BugTracker offers all the essential features a robust bug tracking service should 
provide, plus bug automation features with workflows, out-of-the-box integration with 
Github and BitBucket, file sharing, collaborative dashboard environment, and SLA 
(Service Level Automation) automation.

Meeting
Zoho Meeting is an easy-to-use and powerful web conferencing and live collaboration 
tool for you to take your remote meetings to the next level. You can schedule and run 
unlimited meetings with up to 20 hosts (paid edition) and 100 guests (paid edition) to 
join your web meetings.
Zoho Meeting allows you to remotely control a participant’s computer, making it 
a great tool for remote demoing or troubleshooting. Although there is a handy desktop 
plug-in, Meeting doesn’t need you to install an app to run or join meetings and is 
completely browser based.
It also integrates well with other services such as Zoho CRM, Zoho Chat, Zoho 
Calendar, Google Calendar, and Google Apps.
As with most Zoho apps, you can start for free and set up one-on-one meetings 
right away.
■
■Reference  To learn more about Zoho Meeting, check out https://www.zoho.com/
meeting/resources.html.
Vault
We all use a myriad of apps and services every day, each requiring an account, which as 
prehistoric as it may be, requires a username and a password to log in. Until technology 
comes up with a better way of authenticating users, there is no escape from memorizing 
or storing account information somewhere in a secure place.
Fortunately, there are several apps and services such as 1Password, or Keychain 
Access in Mac OS that store our passwords for us, so we can spend our precious brain 
power on Candy Crush, or something less disappointing.
For teams and businesses, Zoho Vault promises to alleviate this very challenge 
and make password management easy. Vault manages all your passwords securely and 
centrally, logs you into sites and services without the need for manual password entry, 
allows you to share managed passwords with select team members, monitors usage of 
each password, and grants or denies password access accordingly.

Showtime
If you teach or train people for a living, or just give occasional presentations to a large 
audience, you know how important it is to keep the audience engaged and turn them into 
active participants during a session.
Zoho Showtime builds on this simple but crucial fact and provides a tool for you to 
run a smooth show while keeping your audience fully engaged during and after a session. 
You can motivate the audience to express their opinion, run polls, ask questions, and later 
when the session is over, send feedback from and monitor how people engaged with your 
content.
Showtime is a promising and possibly game-changing service for forward-thinking 
trainers. The great news is that it is available for everybody to use free of charge.

Chat
Zoho Chat provides a powerful communication platform for your team, free of charge, 
where you can create channels, share documents, and do more in a modern environment 
available on your computer and your mobile phone.
Zoho Chat is very easy to use and you get it up and running for your organization in a 
few minutes. You will feel quite at home if you used other tools such as Yammer or Slack.
■
■Reference  To learn more about Zoho Chat, check out https://www.zoho.com/chat/help/.
Business Process Apps
Another powerful set of apps that distinguishes Zoho suite from the competition are the 
business process apps. Using these apps, you can build complex database applications 
to run your entire business, or complement other Zoho apps, such as CRM. You can also 
generate sophisticated business and scientific reports based on stand-alone databases or 
tie them back to other Zoho apps.
Creator
Zoho Creator is a powerful platform for creating fully customized cloud-based 
applications. If you have a specific set of business requirements that you can’t find in any 
existing tool, or the available solutions are too expensive, too trivial, or too advanced, you 
can quickly create your very own solution with Creator.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
12
One of the things that makes Creator great is that in many cases you don’t need to do 
a single line of coding to make functional apps. Creator offers many tools to program and 
automate your business processes, but for simpler apps, you don’t need to know any coding.
Simply drag and drop data fields (text boxes, lists, buttons, etc.) to create forms and 
Zoho Creator will do a lot of magic in the background to turn those forms into a full-
fledged application.
My first encounter with Zoho was through Creator. Back in 2008 I was in charge of 
the marketing department of an international real estate brand. We had a clunky CRM 
system, which no one used properly, and it quickly became a bottleneck in our daily 
business processes. We were losing valuable information because salespeople refused to 
use that behemoth of a CRM.
To mitigate this, I ended up creating a mini CRM for the sales team from scratch only 
using Zoho Creator. The app was multiuser, secure, always available, and accessible from 
everywhere. It even generated listing data automatically to send to the local media for 
advertisement.
The team loved the app and used it even after I left that company. I could have 
created a web app from scratch using HTML, PHP, and MySQL, but it would have taken 
me a month to create, test, and deploy something usable. With Creator, I took the app 
from concept to launch in four days while running the marketing department.
■
■Note   If you want to learn more about Zoho Creator and how to leverage its power to 
create world-class cloud-based business applications for your organization, or your client, 
feel free to pick up my other book, Mastering Zoho Creator (Apress, 2017). You will learn all 
the basics of app building in Creator, plus advanced material such as scripting in Deluge and 
integrating with other Zoho apps and third-party services.
AppCreator
Another recent addition to the Zoho family, AppCreator allows you to quickly and with 
minimal or no coding create native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows phones 
and tablets.
With AppCreator you can publish your apps internally within your organization, or 
publicly through one of the app stores.
As of this writing, AppCreator is quite new and available via invitation only.

Reports
If you are into data crunching and analysis, and spreadsheets don’t meet your requirements 
anymore, Zoho Reports is a great option to consider. We live in the age of big data and data 
science is the talk of the town. A plethora of powerful tools such as R, Python, and Tableau 
are available; however, not everyone needs the data scientist’s toolbox.
Zoho Reports is one of the less-known gems that provides you with a powerful 
toolset for collecting data from multiple sources, performing calculations and analyses, 
collaborating, data visualization, and more.
Using Zoho Reports you can manage millions of records and create business 
intelligence to contribute to the success of your business. You can also integrate it with 
Zoho Creator and other apps and services.
Zoho Reports offers a free edition for you to crunch up to 100,000 records of data, 
plus a number of paid editions for heavier use. If you still rely on spreadsheets for data 
analysis and visualization, I strongly suggest you give Reports a try.

Zoho has you covered. A number of finance-related apps will help you keep track of your 
expenses, manage complex accounting operations, issue invoices, and streamline how 
you get paid by clients. There is even an app for managing your inventory, albeit, it may

Invoice
If you are happy with your current accounting software or don’t really need a complete 
accounting software, Zoho Books may not seem so appealing. Sometimes all you need 
as a solopreneur or freelancer is to be able to issue an invoice now and then. In this case, 
Zoho Invoice may just be the answer.
With Invoice, you can define your products and services, add clients, and quickly 
issue estimates and invoices. You can also customize your invoices to your liking and 
include the option to get paid online from within the invoice you send to clients.
Moreover, you can track expenses, set up reminders for your customers to pay you 
on time, and track time for your projects, so you can get paid accurately for the amount of 
work you put in.
The good news is that you can start using Zoho Invoice for free for up to 25 clients 
with all the features available to you.

Subscriptions
If you have recurring billing in your business, for example, you accept monthly payments 
for the subscription site you run, then Zoho Subscriptions can take care of the entire back 
end of the payment system for you.
With Subscriptions, you can create your pricing model, automate billing and payment 
management, monitor your payments, and make strategic decisions accordingly.
Zoho Subscriptions connects to most of the common payment gateways such as PayPal 
and Stripe, and, of course, Zoho apps such as CRM and Books to make your life easier.

Expense
Zoho Expense is an affordable and effective way to get your team expense management 
in order.
You can upload receipts for your daily business expenses on the go via a native 
mobile app, which is quite handy for business travelers. Employees can create expense 
reports by entering receipts and importing card transactions, and then submitting the 
expense reports for approval and reimbursement. Accounts will love this way of receiving 
clear and structured information.
You can connect Zoho Expense to Zoho Books, Invoice, and CRM, as well as 
QuickBooks and Slack (for notifications).

Inventory
Zoho Inventory offers an easy-to-use and cost-effective inventory and order-management 
solution in the cloud. Using Inventory, you can create and manage sales and purchase orders, 
keep track of available stock, and get real-time reports on your logistics operation. All of these 
are possible while you work from your office or on the go via the Inventory mobile app.
Zoho Inventory offers integration with shipping services, such as FedEx, UPS, and 
DHL; online stores such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and Shopify; as well as other Zoho apps 
such as Books and CRM.
If you manage a small inventory and shipping operation out of a single warehouse, 
you can give Zoho Inventory a try for free. As your business grows, you can opt for a 
suitable paid edition and manage tens of thousands of orders per month in multiple 
warehouses.

IT and Help Desk Apps
Zoho’s IT apps will help organizations that need IT support tools to streamline their 
processes and stay productive. Four apps (as of spring 2017) will help your IT team 
provide online and remote support, and manage IT issues and mobile devices.
Desk
Per Zoho, Desk is the “industry’s first context-aware help desk software.”

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet

Customer-centricity must be at the core of every business, and not degraded to merely 
a fluffy statement in marketing campaigns. Customer experience actually starts before 
customers buy your products or services and continues as long as the customers use them.
Zoho Desk tries to improve the often underwhelming (or worse) experience of 
dealing with help desks. Apart from standard issue tracking and ticket management tools, 
Desk offers a centralized, focused, and contextual interface to support teams to stay on 
top of the tasks in hand and manage incoming inquiries from various channels, such as 
phone and email, efficiently.
Zoho Desk also allows you to create a customer service portal and knowledge base 
for your customers, from which they can find solutions to common problems, or file and 
manage their tickets to new issues.
Detailed reporting, a mobile app for customer service on the go, and integration with 
other Zoho apps such as CRM and Projects is also available out of the box.
Even if you are a tiny operation, customer service should still be a key aspect of your 
business culture. That’s how you get loyal customers, repeat business, and referrals.

Assist
Zoho Assist provides an easy way to remotely access computers inside and outside your 
organization for tech support and troubleshooting.
Zoho Assist is a great tool if you need to show a customer how to do a certain task, or 
better, do it for them remotely while they are watching (and hopefully learning). You can 
save time and money and most possibly reduce your carbon footprint by minimizing site 
visits for trivial troubleshooting tasks.
With Zoho Assist you can also remotely access unattended computers (needs software 
installed), so you don’t need someone on the other side to give you access. You can transfer 
files, reboot devices remotely, and access multiple monitors on the host machines.
You can start using Zoho Assist for free for basic tasks, so nothing stands between you 
and helping your clients, colleagues, or your mom remotely with troubleshooting tasks. Now 
you can help her bring back that document that magically disappeared from her desktop.

Human Resources Apps
It is argued that people are a company’s greatest asset. Whether you agree with this 
statement or not, it is important to ensure human resource operations are managed 
properly at all times.
Zoho offers two powerful apps for small to medium businesses (SMBs) to manage 
recruiting fresh blood and also smoothly manage the existing workforce.
Recruit
Zoho Recruit is a cloud-based recruitment solution for recruiting agencies and corporate HR 
(Human Resources) departments. You can create and manage job postings, publish them 
on company websites as well as job boards such as Monster and Indeed, parse resumes, 
manage candidates and communications, and automate tedious HR tasks with workflows.
There is a mobile app for HR ninjas and a free edition for you to give applicant 
tracking and interview scheduling features a try.

People
As you grow, your team grows too. Usually the moment you pass five employees, HR 
requirements, if not handled properly, start to impact productivity and other business 
processes. So, considering an HR solution early on may be a prudent way to go forward.
On the other hand, for companies larger than 5-10 employees, in-house or 
outsourced HR management will become a necessity.
Zoho People is a cloud-based HR management service, which helps you manage 
all HR-related tasks without losing your mind to needy employees. You can manage 
employee information securely, provide self-service features for managers and staff, 
perform time tracking and attendance, and create performance reviews and other 
important reports about your people.
You can start for free to manage up to five employees with Zoho People. Then as 
you hire more people, possibly through Zoho Recruit, you can upgrade to paid plans and 
utilize all the features that People provides in your HR processes.

Where to Start
As you saw in this chapter, Zoho offers a dizzying list of apps. Most of these apps work 
beautifully together and help you streamline your business and stay more productive.
Some of these apps have overlapping features, and it may be confusing which one to 
choose if you are just starting with Zoho or are new to SaaS. So, I try and give a number of 
recommendations in order, which I believe would be applicable to many small businesses:
• 
No matter if you are a solopreneur, a freelancer, or an organization 
of one thousand employees, start with Zoho CRM. Make CRM 
a part of your day-to-day business process as well as long-term 
growth plans. The free edition is a great place to get started. In this 
book, I will cover in detail how to best utilize CRM and make it 
work for your business.
• 
Become more productive by moving your emails to Zoho Mail 
for better integration with CRM. Although CRM offers integration 
with Google Apps and Microsoft Outlook, nothing beats native 
compatibility between Zoho apps. One big bonus here is that you 
can host up to 25 users on Mail for free, and that is with your own 
custom domain.
• 
Incorporate Zoho Campaigns as soon as you can. Almost no 
business, no matter how small, can ignore digital marketing. A big 
part of digital marketing is email and social marketing and Zoho 
Campaign will help you win big here.

Chapter 1 ■ Zoho Suite from 10,000 Feet
19
• 
Get serious about accounting and use either of Zoho Expense, 
Zoho Invoice, or Zoho Books, depending on the size of your 
operation.
• 
Zoho Projects should be another key part of your cloud suite. 
With great integration with CRM and Books, you can easily stay 
on top of your projects and manage the operation of your team 
more effectively.
• 
When your team grows and requirements become more complex, 
use Zoho Creator and Zoho Reports for more advanced business 
processes and adapt Zoho Recruit and People to manage human 
resources.
Once you have these apps utilized, you will see how streamlined your processes 
will become and how much time and money you will be saving. Your team and your 
customers will be happier, which means you will be happier too.
Summary
In this chapter, we had a bird’s eye view of the Zoho suite. I hope you see how 
interconnected Zoho suite apps are and how using as many Zoho apps as possible in your 
business will improve productivity and save you time and money.
In the next chapter, we will look at how CRM as a practice, and not a mere software 
solution, is a key factor to the success of your business. We will also get introduced to 
some basic business-process management concepts to guide us throughout this book.

CHAPTER 2
CRM at Your Business Core
This chapter, as daunting as it may look, is arguably one of the most important chapters in 
this book. Before jumping right into the exciting stuff and starting to explore Zoho CRM, 
let’s take a step back and review what makes a CRM implementation successful.
If concepts, such as CRM, business process, or process modeling are new to you, 
treat yourself to a double espresso (or your favorite hot drink), read through this chapter, 
and study the references provided as well. I promise to stay as shallow as possible and yet 
provide you with enough information to get you going.
On the other hand, if you already have your processes mapped (and possibly 
improved), or you can map processes with your eyes closed, feel free to skip this chapter.
The Why, the What, and the How
It is easy and perilous to get distracted by the fancy shiny IT world and forget what you 
are trying to achieve; how you want to achieve it; and most importantly, why you want to 
achieve it anyway. Let’s put this into perspective.
For instance, imagine you want to implement a CRM for your organization. After all, it is 
most probably why you are reading this book, instead of sipping a piña colada at the beach.
Now let’s revisit the definition of CRM:
CRM is a management philosophy according to which a company’s 
goals can be best achieved through identification and satisfaction of the 
customers’ stated and unstated needs and wants.
So it is safe to say that what you want to achieve is to make your customers happy.
Why you want happy customers has obviously something to do with wanting more 
business and hopefully more money in your bank account.
How you achieve this lofty goal, on the other hand, is by implementing a CRM in 
your organization.
Why am I taking your precious time by garbling philosophy, you ask? To ask you 
to take a step back and make sure a CRM is the right tool for you to achieve your goals. 
By reaching this level of conviction about the means to achieve your organizational 
goals, you will be able to design the best solution that addresses every single business 
requirement and improves efficiency and effectiveness of your efforts in keeping the 
customers happy and your business profitable.

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core

CRM
According to the Oxford dictionary,1 CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management 
and denotes strategies and software that enable a company to optimize its customer 
relations.
BusinessDictionary, on the other hand, gives two detailed and clearer definitions:2
	
1.	
A management philosophy according to which a company’s 
goals can be best achieved through identification and satisfaction 
of the customers’ stated and unstated needs and wants.
	
2.	
A computerized system for identifying, targeting, acquiring, 
and retaining the best mix of customers.
Customer relationship management helps in profiling prospects, 
understanding their needs, and in building relationships with them by 
providing the most suitable products and enhanced customer service. It 
integrates back and front office systems to create a database of customer 
contacts, purchases, and technical support, among other things. This 
database helps the company in presenting a unified face to its customers, 
and improve the quality of the relationship, while enabling customers to 
manage some information on their own.
I particularly like how the definition emphasizes that CRM, first and foremost, is a 
management philosophy. The reason I obsess with this statement is that in many cases, 
when an organization implements an information system, such as CRM, the software is 
deemed a magic wand that you point at the mess you are in, and voilà! It solves all your 
problems.
The reality is quite the opposite. Throwing software in the mix of organizational 
chaos usually leads to more chaos and frustration. It is surprising that even large 
enterprises that do due diligence and have all the complex IT models and methods at 
their disposal fall in this trap too.
As a small business you cannot afford to make such mistakes, especially since you 
have way less resources to gamble with. Although cloud computing and SaaS saves you 
thousands of dollars in upfront IT, implementing information systems needs expensive 
resources, such as time, and it could increase business risk in the transition period.
By utilizing a CRM you take control of three main aspects of your business operation 
(Figure 2-1):
• 
Marketing
• 
Sales
• 
Customer service

Customer relationship management is a perpetual loop. The longer you can keep 
a client in this loop, the more they become and the more successful you are. Your CRM 
must model this loop effectively and help you win new customers while retaining loyal 
customers for the foreseeable future.
In this book you will see how to set up Zoho CRM and utilize its power to do exactly that.
Beyond CRM
Before we go any further, it is worth mentioning Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and 
Business Process Management (BPM) in here. Both are very important in the business 
world, and many books and courses are available on both topics.
ERP
The next level for a business using CRM properly is to consider implementing an 
ERP system and integrating it with your CRM. ERP brings additional activities of an 
organization, such as finance, supply chain, human resources, and reporting under one 
roof to be integrated and managed effectively.
There are many enterprise-level ERP systems, such as SAP ERP, Oracle ERP Cloud, 
and Microsoft Dynamics ERP.
However, for small businesses and solopreneurs, ERP is overkill. Simply start with 
a robust CRM, such as (Zoho) CRM and as your requirements grow, incorporate Zoho 
Books, Zoho People, Zoho Inventory, Zoho Projects, Zoho Reports, and other tools to 
create your customized and effective mini ERP.
Figure 2-1.  CRM loop

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
24
BPM
According to BusinessDictionary,3 BPM is an activity undertaken by businesses to identify, 
evaluate, and improve business processes. With the advancement of technology, BPM can 
now be effectively managed with software that is customized based on the metrics and 
policies specified by a company. This type of action is essential to businesses seeking to 
improve process performance-related issues so that they can better serve their clients.
■
■Reference   To get a better idea of what BPM is, read Nathaniel Palmer’s post.4
BPM is quite enterprise focused and in large organizations systems such as ERP and 
CRM could very well be a part of a much larger enterprise BPM.
We won’t be talking about BPM in here beyond a mere honorable mention. What we 
will focus on, however, is the practice of mapping business processes and then using it 
quite lightly to design our CRM implementation properly.
But before that, let’s understand what we mean by business processes.
Process, Process, Process
Everything in this seemingly infinite world is a part of a process. It is hard to argue with 
this statement. After all, a process is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a 
particular end.
Even the simplest, most mundane things in our daily lives involve multiple 
processes. When you wake up in the morning and make yourself a cup of coffee, you take 
part in a complex process with underlying subprocesses. Some of these subprocesses are 
a trip to the kitchen, preparing coffee, and consuming it.
Let’s break down the trip to the kitchen:
	
1.	
Gently get out of the bed:
	
	
a.	
don’t wake up the angel (or demon) sleeping next to you.
	
2.	
Walk toward the door.
	
3.	
If the bedroom door is closed:
	
	
a.	
open the bedroom door,
	
	
b.	
close the door behind you,
	
	
c.	
pass through the door.
	
4.	
If the bedroom door is open:
	
	
a.	
pass through the door.
3http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/business-process-management-BPM.html

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
25
	
5.	
Walk across the hall.
	
6.	
Avoid stepping on the cat purring right in the middle of the hall.
	
7.	
Arrive in the kitchen.
I bet you can add or change a few steps depending on your own coffee-making routine. 
Now, if you were the obsessive type, you would have wanted to map every single step of this 
process and see whether there is room for improvement. For instance, what if you always kept 
the door open, or would it help if you installed an automatic sliding door for the bedroom?
It may seem excessive, or downright ridiculous, to install an automatic sliding 
bedroom door only to skip two steps in your morning coffee ritual. However, in a business 
scenario – where efficiency is important – the scale of things changes dramatically.
Imagine a good old door installed on the way to the kitchen in a busy restaurant. 
If, on average, 3 staff members were to pass through that door every 5 minutes during a 
normal 8 hour shift, the poor door would need to open and close 288 times every single 
day. Considering maintenance costs, hygiene, and safety measures, an automatic kitchen 
door for a restaurant may not be a bad idea, after all.
You can find similar examples in your work environment. Virtually, any business 
process can be improved. But before improving a process, first we need to fully understand it.
Map All Processes
An effective way of understanding all aspects of an existing process is to create a visual 
representation of it, that is, map it.
Mapping business processes also helps to make sure when implementing 
information systems (e.g., CRM), the behavior and outcome of such systems match, 
complement, and improve the existing processes.
Example: Imagine, up until a week ago, your sales team relied on Gmail and 
Microsoft Excel to manage their clients and deals. It was certainly less than ideal, but it 
was working nonetheless.
Then, you roll out a new CRM to manage the sales force and to improve efficiency 
across the board. Since you are a smart and caring manager (or consultant), you make 
sure staff goes through a full CRM training before the launch, so the transition from 
Gmail/Excel to CRM is as smooth as possible.
You make it clear that after the new CRM is implemented, all data is to be centralized, 
and keeping information on scattered Excel sheets is considered heresy. Everything is 
going smoothly and all heads are in constant nodding mode in team meetings.
Then the disaster strikes. Two days after the launch of the CRM, your new dream 
world comes down crumbling because a workflow in the CRM that automates sending 
emails to the reporting managers skips an internal approval process and messes up the 
whole chain of command. Oh, boy.
Three days and a few unpleasant meetings later, you find out that the process in 
question was not mapped properly nor it was signed off by the management prior to 
being implemented in the CRM.
Unfortunately, incidents such as the just mentioned are not as isolated as one could 
wish for. After all, human error is a part of the job, but it can be minimized with a few 
steps taken in the right direction, that is, mapping, analyzing, and signing off all business 
processes prior to even choosing an information solution.

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
26
How to Map Processes
According to Nathaniel Palmer, business process mapping is to “identify, define, and make 
a representation of the complete process to support communication about the process. 
There is no single standard way to model, but the model must encompass the process.”
It is worth mentioning that process modeling, in contrast to process mapping, is focused 
on the optimization of the processes, which happens after they are properly mapped.
It is a good idea to learn process mapping according to industry standards and best 
practices to make sure other professionals understand it and can continue your work 
without going back to square one. One of these standards is BPMN.
BPMN
A common standard for modeling business processes is BPMN (Business Process Model 
and Notation).5 Figure 2-2 is an example of a very simple process map representing the 
steps and logical connections of processing an order in a typical scenario.
■
■Reference   The process model in Figure 2-2 was downloaded from Business Process 
Incubator.6 Business Process Incubator is a great place to start your journey as business 
owner or consultant in the world of business process management. Make sure you keep 
their BPMN quick guide7 handy when mapping processes.
Tools of the Trade
As you can expect, there is a myriad of process mapping and modeling tools available 
out there. Most of these tools are targeted to enterprise users, but we are going to stick to 
simpler, more affordable options, which can do exactly what we need: to turn mysterious 
business processes and procedures into clear and readable visual diagrams.

You can use any diagramming tool, such as the all capable Microsoft Visio, or the 
versatile and cloud-based LucidChart. Each one of these tools offers the essentials of 
modeling and has unique features to address the requirements of different users.
Microsoft Visio, for example, is very common among the enterprise users who 
use Microsoft ERP and CRM solutions. Visio is also quite similar to Microsoft Office 
applications in terms of look and feel. This familiar interface makes it easier for 
experienced Office users to pick up Visio faster.
LucidChart, on the other hand, is lightweight, suitable for a variety of scenarios, and 
offers different monthly subscription options for different requirements.
In this book we are going to use the nifty Camunda Modeler8 to map our business 
processes based on the BPMN 2.0 industry standard. This is quite handy and future proof 
as you can use the maps created with Camunda Modeler directly for process modeling 
and improvement in the future.
You can install Camunda Modeler on Mac, Windows, and GNU/Linux, or simply run 
it on Chrome.
■
■Note   To learn how to install Camunda Modeler on your system, refer to the installation 
guide at https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.6/installation/camunda-modeler/.
In Figure 2-3 you can see Camunda Modeler (version 1.5.1) in action, with the same 
model from Figure 2-2 loaded in to the modeler.

You can edit, print, and export this model. Click on one of the objects (symbols) on 
the map and a context menu will appear (Figure 2-4). You can also perform a number of 
actions such as editing or removing the object, or adding new objects to the map.
Getting Started with Process Mapping
In this section, we will create a very simple process map with Camunda Modeler to learn 
the basics of process mapping. Let’s start by learning the most basic BPMN symbols.
A Dash of BPMN 2.0
BPMN symbols are divided into four groups:
• 
Flow Objects
• 
Connecting Objects
• 
Swimlanes
• 
Artifacts
There are three groups of Flow Objects:
• 
Event - represents an event (obviously) in the process, for 
example start or end of a process, receipt of a message, a timer 
reaching 0, etc.
• 
Activity - represents a type of work being done, for example, 
sending a message, logging into a system, etc.
• 
Gateway - represents a separation (or recombination) in the flow 
of a process often due to a condition being met in the process, for 
example, an approval being approved or rejected, payment being 
accepted, etc.
Connecting Objects connect the flow objects showing a sequence of actions, the 
route of a message from one stage (or participant to another), or the relationship between 
flow objects (Figure 2-5). These objects are shown as arrowed lines.
Figure 2-4.   Object context menu

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
29
In Figure 2-6 you notice a container box labeled as Sales Clerk. This box is called 
a Swimlane (or Lane, for brevity). Lanes are used to group other objects (symbols) and 
separate logical or actual aspects of a process. Not surprisingly, a collection of lanes is 
called a Pool.
For example, when processing orders in an organization, the order is initially 
received by the Sales department. After going through a few steps, the order is submitted 
to the Finance department for some accounting work, and then is sent back to Sales for 
further processing.
To show this interdepartmental flow, process steps are placed in two adjacent lanes 
called Sales and Finance to show which steps happen where. This not only helps clarify 
the flow, but also it could reveal interdependencies and possible inefficiencies caused by

Last, but not least, there are three types of Artifacts:
• 
Annotations - to provide additional information about the map;
• 
Groups - to put tasks and parts of the process together showing 
some sort of significance; and
• 
Data Objects - to represent presence of data input, output, 
collection, or storage of data in the process.

Your First Process Map
To get our hands dirty, we are going to map a very simple process: cold calling procedure 
for a local insurance broker.
Here is what happens in our typical cold call scenario:
	
1.	
Call the lead.
	
2.	
If the lead picks up the phone:
	
	
a.	
go through the sales script.
	
	
b.	
if the lead is interested, send them more information via 
email.
	
3.	
Hang up.
	
4.	
Log the call.
■
■Disclaimer   This is by no means an exhaustive process for a successful cold call. There 
is more to a killer cold call. Our intention here is to just learn how to map a simple, but 
realistic enough, process.

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
31
EXERCISE 1 – COLD CALLING PROCESS MAP
Follow these steps to map the above process:
1.	
Open Camunda Modeler (Figure 2-7).
Figure 2-7.  Camunda Modeler for Mac, version 1.5.1

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
32
2.	
Click Create a BPMN diagram button in the middle of the  
main window, or press Command+T (on Mac), or Windows+T  
(on Windows) on your keyboard. A new diagram will open with 
an Event symbol (circle) placed in it. This symbol indicates the 
start of the process (Figure 2-8).
3.	
Drag and drop an Activity (rounded rectangular) symbol from the 
toolbox on the left-hand side of the window into the diagram. 
The Activity symbol appears on the diagram in edit mode.
4.	
Type in “Call the Lead” and press Enter on the keyboard 
(Figure 2-9).
Figure 2-8.  Start symbol
Figure 2-9.  Activity symbol

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
33
6.	
Move the cursor toward the Activity symbol until the cursor 
touches the left side of the rectangular shape. The color of the 
rectangle turns light green (Figure 2-11).
5.	
Click the Start Event symbol (circle) and on the context menu 
click on the arrows icons (Figure 2-10). A dashed line appears 
connected to the mouse cursor.
Figure 2-10.  Symbol context menu

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
34
8.	
In the context menu, click on the Gateway symbol. A moving 
shape appears. Move the cursor until the shape is aligned with 
the other symbols and click again. A Gateway shape will be 
placed on the diagram with an arrowed line connecting both 
symbols (Figure 2-13).
7.	
Click again. An arrowed line will be placed between the two 
symbols connecting them. Then a context menu appears 
automatically ready for you to pick the next symbol that is 
connected to the “Call the Lead” Activity (Figure 2-12).
Figure 2-12.  Ready for the next symbol
Figure 2-13.  Gateway symbol

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
35
9.	
Label the Gateway symbol as “Lead Picks up the Phone?”
10.	
Add an Activity symbol labeled “Go Through the Sales Script” 
(Figure 2-14).
Figure 2-14.  Adding another activity symbol
11.	
Add a Gateway symbol labeled “Lead Interested?”
12.	
Label the line connecting the previous Gateway and Activity 
symbols “Yes” (Figure 2-15).
Figure 2-15.  Adding another gateway symbol
13.	
Add another Activity and label “Email Information.”
14.	
Bonus: Click on the symbol and select the tool icon in the 
context menu. A drop-down menu appears to select the  
Activity type.

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
36
15.	
Select “Send Task” in the drop-down menu. A mail icon appears 
in the Activity symbol (Figure 2-16).
16.	
Add two more Activity symbols: “Hang Up” and “Log the Call” 
(Figure 2-17).
Figure 2-16.  Specifiying activity type as a send task
Figure 2-17.  Adding final activities

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
37
17.	
Then add an End Event to indicate the end of the process 
(Figure 2-18). There are still two steps missing from the process 
map.
18.	
Click the “Lead Picks Up the Phone?” Gateway symbol and 
select the arrowed line icon in the context menu. Then move the 
cursor and drop it on the “Hang Up” Activity.
19.	
A line connects the two symbols but overlaps other symbols on 
the way. Fix it by hovering the cursor on the arrowed line and 
clicking when a yellow dot appears on the line (Figure 2-19).
20.	
Then click and drag the line away until a broken line is created 
(Figure 2-20).
Figure 2-18.  Adding the end event symbol
Figure 2-19.  Fixing the overlapping arrowed line, step 1
Figure 2-20.  Fixing the overlapping arrowed line, step 2

Chapter 2 ■ CRM at Your Business Core
38
21.	
Repeat the same on the left side of the line and create a parallel 
connection between the Gateway and the activity shapes 
(Figure 2-21).
22.	
Similarly connect the “Lead Interested?” Gateway to "Hang Up” 
Activity and finish the process map (Figure 2-22).
Congratulations! You mapped your first business process.
Looking at the process map you created, you can see how easy it is now to follow the 
process and understand what happens at each step.
A great benefit of having such a document in hand is that you can share a readable 
process map such as this one with concerned departments (Sales, Marketing, etc.) and 
get their feedback and confirmation about the validity of each step.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned, albeit very lightly, about a number of foundational concepts, 
such as CRM, ERP, and BPM. We discussed that the key to implementing a successful CRM 
is to understand exactly what we intend to do and why we are doing it in the first place.
We also had a quick look at process mapping and how it can save you time and 
money before you embark on implementing any information solution, including a CRM.
I hope I could trigger the interest in you to learn more about process analysis and 
understating how your business works on a granular level. By looking closer into day-to-
day operations, you will be surprised to learn about steps or connections that you didn’t 
know existed, or the unknown bottlenecks that impacted the efficiency of your business.
In the next chapter, we will start using Zoho CRM and prepare it for prime time.

CHAPTER 3
Getting Started with Zoho 
CRM
In the previous chapter, we had a quick look at how a CRM system (Zoho CRM, here) can 
be, and frankly, should be at the core of your business. We also learned about the very 
basics of how to understand and map your business processes.
By mapping your processes accurately, you will have a clear idea of how the  
day-to-day operations of your business improve or impede productivity and efficiency 
throughout your business. You can then begin to improve them.
Additionally, for our purpose, which is to set up a solid CRM system from ground up, 
these process maps will help replicate the exact processes in the CRM.
For example, the specific way your sales funnel (pipeline) is designed needs to be 
reflected in the CRM. These include actions taken by the salespeople from start to finish, 
the documents created and submitted in the process, approvals, notifications, emails, and 
workflows.
Imagine a world in which you have eliminated unnecessary paper trails and 
automated trivial tasks, such as submitting documents for approval. A lot of these 
inefficient processes can be replicated and automated in the CRM. Just don’t expect CRM 
to do everything for you. You may still need HR systems, inventory systems, and project 
management tools; however, CRM will take care of the heart of your business, that is, 
sales, and communicate with other tools and systems improving productivity even more.
With all the preparation and appreciation of the philosophy of CRM under our belt, 
you are now ready to start working on Zoho CRM and learn how to build exactly what 
your business needs.
Getting Started
To start with Zoho CRM, open your favorite browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, etc.) 
and log onto https://crm.zoho.com/.
I will assume that this is your first time here, so before we do anything else, we will 
need to create an account. This account is a universal Zoho account and you can use it to 
access other Zoho services, such as Mail, Campaigns, Books, etc.

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
40
To create a new Zoho account, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the homepage (Figure 3-1), type in your name, email, and 
a strong password.
■
■Note  Building strong passwords for all your accounts, especially accounts in which you 
keep confidential business information, is paramount. You can use tools, such as Keychain 
Access for Mac OS, lastPass,1 or Zoho Vault2 to create and manage strong passwords for 
your accounts.
	
2.	
Click on the Create Account button to initiate the sign-up 
process. Within moments, you will receive a confirmation 
email from Zoho asking you to confirm your email address.
	
3.	
Click Confirm your account button in the email. Upon successful 
confirmation, you will be redirected to the login page.
	
4.	
In the login page, enter your email address and the password 
you chose in step 1 and then click Login.
Figure 3-1.  Zoho CRM homepage

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
41
	
5.	
In the next page, you will be asked to enable Two Factor 
Authentication (TFA) (Figure 3-2). I strongly suggest you enable 
this feature as it will dramatically improve the security level 
of your account against possible attacks (hacking, etc.). Click 
Set up to Protect Now and follow the onscreen instructions to 
enable TFA. If you want to do this later, you can click the link 
below the button that reads Skip Two Factor Authentication.
■
■What is Two Factor Authentication?  Two Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of 
security to your account. Once enabled, Sign-In will require you to enter a unique verification 
code generated by an app on your mobile device or sent via text message, in addition to 
your username and password.
If you opted not to enable this feature during the first setup, you can always enable it at 
https://accounts.zoho.com/u/h#security/authentication.
	
6.	
In the next page, you will be asked to update your company 
information. Enter relevant information for the following 
(Figure 3-3):
	
	
a.	
Company Name
	
	
b.	
Phone Number
	
	
c.	
Mobile Number
	
	
d.	
Time Zone (of your headquarters)
	
	
e.	
Language
	
	
f.	
Currency Locale

7.	
Click Save to continue. You will be redirected to the CRM 
homepage (Figure 3-4).
Quick Tour of the Homepage
On the homepage (Figure 3-4), you’ll be greeted by six big buttons, each helping you get 
started with the CRM. We will skip these fancy buttons.
Figure 3-4.  Zoho CRM homepage after first login
Figure 3-3.  Updating company information

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
43
On top of the page, there is a menu bar with items such as Home, Feeds, Leads, etc. 
Each one of these menus items loads a CRM module (more on this later).
On the right-hand side of the menu bar, there are six buttons that allow you to access 
other features of the CRM, such as set up, messages, and calendar.
Below the menu bar, there is a contextual bar with a welcome message on the left 
side and three items on the right to switch between different views of the homepage:
• 
Getting Started (the current view,)
• 
Customized View, and
• 
Classic View.
Go ahead and switch between them. There is not much to see now, but after data 
is entered into CRM and with some cusomiztion, you can view the current state of your 
business right in your homepage.
Right next to the welcome message is a message in red warning you that you have 
14 days until your Enterprise trial expires. By default, all new Zoho CRM accounts come 
for a limited time with all the features enabled for users to test all aspects of CRM and 
then choose the edition they need. You can ignore this for now.
■
■Reminder  Zoho CRM comes in four different editions: Free, Standard, Professional, and 
Enterprise Edition.
Each one of these editions comes with a different set of features and capabilities with the 
Free edition being the most basic and the Enterprise edition the most advanced one in the 
mix. As a courtesy (and a way of trying all the features), Zoho gives new users a 14-day trial 
of the Enterprise edition. After this period your account will revert to the Free edition. The 
Free edition is quite capable for small operations; however, you may need one of the paid 
editions as per your business requirements.
Learn more about all the features available to different editions of CRM here:  
https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/erutaef321.html.
CRM Terminology
The key to effectively managing the sales processes of your organization is to know exactly 
in what stage of the pipeline (or sales funnel) a potential customer or a deal is. CRM 
manages the entire pipeline in a central location, automates many mundane processes, 
and improves the productivity and efficiency of the sales force.
In a typical (sales-focused) business environment, terms such as lead, prospect, 
customer, opportunity, validation, account etc. is commonplace. Naturally, CRM systems 
adopt such terms in their terminology and Zoho CRM is no exception.

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
44
Below are four of the key terms used in Zoho CRM:
• 
Lead – A lead is an unqualified contact or sales opportunity. For 
example, the business cards collected in an exhibition, or a cold 
referral received from a partner is a lead. Leads enter the sales 
pipeline from early stages and need to be qualified (validated) via 
follow-ups and other methods.
• 
Contact – Once a lead is qualified it gets converted in the CRM. 
One output of this conversion is a Contact who is a person with 
whom you interact during a sales process. For example, suppose 
you are trying to sell raw material to a company overseas. You 
have found and contacted the procurement manager who 
happens to be interested in listening to your offer. This person 
become a contact.
• 
Deal – When you qualify (convert) a lead, it generates asecond 
output, which is the potential deal between you and your client. 
This is called a Deal and goes through various stages in the 
pipeline.
• 
Account – Finally, the last outcome of converting a lead is an 
Account, which is a company or a department within a company 
that you do business with. Each account can have one more 
Contacts assigned to it.
■
■Note  You can create contacts, deals, or accounts directly without taking them through 
the lead conversion process. This is particularly useful when you work with exitisng contact, 
deals, or accounts and just want to import them as they are into the CRM.
There is more to CRM terminologies. We will learn about teach one as we use them in the 
upcoming chapters. For a list of all terminologies, refer to Zoho Help:  
https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/understanding-zohocrm.html#Terminologies
CRM Modules
Zoho CRM categorizes data into logical groups based on their type of content. These 
groups are called modules and each come with a set of unique features relevant to the 
information they manage.
Here is the complete list of standard Zoho CRM modules grouped by their type of 
operation:
• 
Sales Force Automation
• 
Leads
• 
Accounts

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
45
• 
Contacts
• 
Deals (or Opportunities, formerly known as Potentials)
• 
Forecasts
• 
Marketing Automation
• 
Campaigns
• 
Customer Support
• 
Cases
• 
Solutions
• 
Inventory Management
• 
Products
• 
Vendors
• 
Sales Quotes
• 
Purchase Orders
• 
Sales Orders
• 
Invoices
• 
Price Books
• 
Data Analytics
• 
Reports
• 
Dashboards
• 
Activities
• 
Tasks
• 
Events
• 
Call Logs
The name of each module is quite self-explanatory and each represents a common 
business process used by majority of the organizations. We will be using most of these 
modules in various contexts and learn more about inner workings of each one as we go 
forward.
These modules work together seamlessly addressing almost all requiremnts of a 
typical business operation. That said, you can customize them as per your business 
requirements and make them work better for you.
On the other hand, if you have a drastically different set of requirements, you have 
the option to create custom modules. For example, for a real estate company, you can 
customize the Products module to maintin your listings, or create a Listings module from 
scratch and use Products for other purposes.

Setting Up Zoho CRM
CRM has a powerful Setup page in which you can customize its many features. We will 
be visiting the Setup page often, but for now we simply need to modify some general 
settings, namely:
• 
Personal Settings
• 
Company Details
• 
Users
• 
Email Settings
Follow these steps to configure the general settings:
	
1.	
On the top right of the page, in the menu bar, click on the tools 
button and select Setup in the context menu (Figure 3-5). 
Setup page opens (Figure 3-6).
Figure 3-5.  Tools context menu

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
47
	
2.	
In the Setup page, under GENERAL group, click Personal 
Settings. Personal settings page opens.
	
3.	
Click on the small pen icon next to each field and edit the 
values (Figure 3-7).
Figure 3-6.  CRM Setup page
Figure 3-7.  Personal Settings page
	
4.	
Next, click on Company Details on the left sidebar. Company 
Detail will open (Figure 3-8).

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
48
	
5.	
Click the Upload Your Logo link under the logo placeholder.
	
6.	
In the Upload Your Logo dialog box, click the Browse Local 
Files button and select your logo image (Figure 3-9).
	
7.	
Click the pen icon next to company name. The Company 
Details dialog box will open.
	
8.	
In the Company Details box, enter your company information 
and click Save when you are done (Figure 3-10).
Figure 3-8.  Company Details page
Figure 3-9.  Uploading company logo

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
49
	
9.	
On top of the Company Details page, click the Fiscal Year tab.
	
10.	
In the Fiscal Year tab, change the month in Fiscal year begins 
drop-down, if January (default value) is not the start of the 
fiscal year for your organization and click Save to apply the 
change (Figure 3-11).
Figure 3-10.  Editing company details
Figure 3-11.  Setting fiscal year

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
50
	
11.	
Next, select the Business Hours tab (Figure 3-12). Here you can 
set various business hours for different operations based on 
different time zones. For instance, if your tech support team 
is available 24/7, but your head office works only Monday-
Friday from 9a.m.-6p.m. PST, you will need to create two 
different sets of business hours.
	
12.	
In the Business Hours page, click the Create New Business Hour 
button. Business Hours Detail page opens.
	
13.	
Enter a meaningful Name and the applicable Time Zone. Then 
set the operational hours for each applicable day and leave 
the unoperational hours unchanged (01:00 AM) (Figure 3-13). 
Finish by clicking Save.
Figure 3-12.  Creating business hours

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
51
User Management
You should create new users for every employee who will use the CRM. Sharing accounts 
is usually not a good idea due to security and accountability reasons. There are cases 
when you might want more than one person to access the same account, such as the 
administrator account, but for salespeople it is always a good idea to assign one account 
per person.
In CRM, you can define as many users as you like, and the Free edition allows a 
maximum of 10 users to be created. ten free users are often plenty, because if you have 10 
or more employees, you should be investing in one of the paid editions and utilizing more 
advanced features not available in the Free edition.
Although you may not actually need to add new users to CRM at this stage while 
you are still learning, it is still a good idea to add one or two of your colleagues to test the 
features of the CRM together.
Follow these steps to add a new user to CRM:
	
1.	
If you are continuing from the previous section, click Users 
and Controls and then Users on the sidebar; otherwise, 
open the Setup page and click on Users under USERS AND 
CONTROL. A list of users will be displayed (Figure 3-14).
Figure 3-13.  Creating business hours

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
52
	
2.	
Click the Add New User button on top of the list. Add New 
User dialog box will open (Figure 3-15).
Figure 3-15.  Adding a new user
Figure 3-14.  Users settings page

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
53
	
3.	
Enter First Name, Last Name, and Email for the new user.
	
4.	
Next, click on the Roles button next to the Role field. Roles List 
dialog box will open (Figure 3-16).
	
5.	
In Roles List box, click on Manager. Manager role will be 
assigned to the new user.
	
6.	
Select Standard from the Profile drop-down list and click Save 
to add the new user.
At this point the new user will be added to the list of users. CRM wil send an invitation 
email to the new user, which must be accepted before the user can access your CRM.
■
■Note   Zoho CRM offers versatile user profile and role management to give you 
complete freedom and flexibility to define reporting rules, as well as to limit users to access 
the information they don’t need, or are not allowed to access. We will learn about these 
advanced features later in this book.

Email Settings
Despite all the efforts and newer technologies and modern takes on messaging, such as 
Slack,3 a majority of business communications still happens via Email. This 50-year-old 
technology, with all its shortcomings, doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, 
so it is smart to at least use it in a more productive way.
Zoho CRM has a solution for this dilemma. It is called SalesInbox and it allows 
you to incorpate your email account into CRM for better sales and client management. 
Instead of going back and forth between your inbox and CRM, you can access all relevant 
information from one place and improve your efficieny dramatically.
To enable this feature, you need to first integrate your email account with CRM. You can 
integrate all common email services; however, in this example, we will be connecting a Gmail 
account to CRM. Connecting other services should be fairly similar and even less complex.
To integrate Gmail with CRM, follow these steps:
	
1.	
If you are continuing from the previous section, click Emails 
Settings on the sidebar; otherwise, open the Setup page and 
click on Email Settings under GENERAL. A list of popular 
email services will be shown (Figure 3-17).
	
2.	
Click on Gmail button to continue.
	
3.	
In the next page enter your full name, Gmail address, and 
Gmail password (Figure 3-18). Click Continue to proceed.
Figure 3-17.  Email settings

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
55
	
4.	
The page will expand asking for email sharing permissions 
(Figure 3-19). Leave the default selection, Private – Only Me, 
as is and click Continue.
Figure 3-18.  Setting up a Gmail account
Figure 3-19.  Setting up a Gmail account, step 2

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
56
	
5.	
At this stage, the integration wizard may get stuck, even showing 
you an error message. This is due to Gmail security measures 
that stops third-party apps and services from connecting to 
Gmail in the background. You will receive a warning email 
from Gmail telling you about the incident (Figure 3-20). Since 
we know this is caused by Zoho CRM attempting to connect to 
Gmail, we can ignore the warning. To proceed click on the link 
in the email reading “allowing access to less secure apps.”
	
6.	
You will be redirected to the account page of Google where 
you can allow what Google calls “less secure apps” to access 
Gmail (Figure 3-21). Go ahead and select Turn on.
Figure 3-21.  Enabling less secure apps for Gmail
Figure 3-20.  Gmail notification email

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
57
	
7.	
Then log into Gmail and open Settings (Figure 3-22).
	
8.	
In Gmail Settings page, select Enable IMAP and click Save 
Changes.
	
9.	
Now go back to CRM and click Proceed button again. You 
may need to reenter your Gmail password from before. Upon 
successful connection a message will indicate that the sync is 
in progress (Figure 3-23). You can leave this page now. You will 
receive an email after a successful sync between Gmail and CRM.

■Note  Inetgrating emails with CRM could prove tricky, especially with email services 
changing their settings often. Refer to Zoho help at https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/
email/configure-imap-account.html for a complete email configuration guide.
Enabling SalesInbox
One last step is to enable SalesInbox, so you can start doing actual work and converting 
leads into paying customers.
Follow these steps to enable SalesInbox:
	
1.	
Click SalesInbox on the main menu bar. SalesInbox page 
opens waiting to be enabled (Figure 3-24).
	
2.	
Click the TRY NOW button. A dialog box will appear asking 
you if you would like to import the existing email filters in 
your email account (Figure 3-25).
Figure 3-24.  SalesInbox page loading for the first time

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
59
	
3.	
Click Skip for now. You can import filters (if you have any) 
later from the SalesInbox settings page. A moment later the 
SalesInbox page will refresh, showing your emails in a familiar 
inbox interface, only with more features for CRM (Figure 3-26).
Figure 3-25.  Importing email filters
Figure 3-26.  SalesInbox page populated with emails

Chapter 3 ■ Getting Started with Zoho CRM
60
	
4.	
Click on of the emails to see more details about a specific 
email. All essential features, such as Reply and Forward, are 
available for you to manage your emails from within CRM 
(Figure 3-27).
There are, however, two curious buttons on the top right of the screen: LEAD and 
CONTACT. These buttons let you add the sender of the email directly to the CRM process. 
After that point all interactions between you and the lead (or contact) will be logged and 
managed in the CRM. Pretty awesome!
Our work is done here. We will use these buttons and other features of SalesInbox in 
the upcoming chapters.
Summary
In this chapter, you created your very first Zoho CRM and made some essential 
confirgurations to make it ready for the next steps.
In the next chapter, we will start using SalesInbox, modules and other features of 
CRM to manage our sales funnel.

CHAPTER 4
Running Your Business on 
Zoho CRM
It is hard to argue that the core objective of every serious business is to generate profit. 
Therefore, it is paramount to meticulously manage the entire sales process, from 
inception to post sales.
If you closely look at your business processes you will see, not surprisingly, that 
almost every process is, directly or indirectly, contributing to increase sales. Otherwise 
you should seriously review that process.
In this chapter, we will see how Zoho CRM manages the sales force to make your life 
easier and help you increase sales. This is one of the most important chapters in the book. 
Make sure you understand the concepts and practice as much as it takes.
Managing the Sales Pipeline
Zoho CRM is fairly similar to other powerful CRM systems out there in terms of features 
and capabilities of managing your sales processes. If you come from another CRM 
system, you will notice some differences in lingo and other areas; however, the essence of 
CRM practice is more or less the same in all of these systems.
At the core of Zoho CRM lie powerful sales force automation modules and tools, 
allowing you to fully manage your pipeline (or, funnel), that is, all the stages from when 
leads are collected until a deal is closed and beyond.
You should design the stages of your pipeline according to your sales processes; 
however, it is safe to say that there are four common stages to consider for a typical sales 
pipeline:
• 
Lead Generation
• 
Lead Qualification
• 
Opportunities (or Deals)
• 
Sales

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM

Figure 4-1 shows a typical pipeline based on the four stages previously mentioned.
One key importance of the funnel (or pipeline) is that as a business owner, or 
decision maker, you can have a bird’s eye view of your business at any given moment 
and see who is where in the funnel and how close a deal is to closing. Maintaining and 
managing an accurate funnel helps you monitor the performance of your business and 
strategize accordingly, with clarity and agility.
Leads
Leads are people or companies whom fall in your target market and might turn into 
prospects interested in your products or services. Every business card you collect, every 
email address that gets registered on your website, or any one result of executive searches 
on LinkedIn are considered leads.
All leads should be captured in the CRM from the early stage, one by one, or in bulk 
and then be taken through the sales funnel until they turn into sales (or not).
Lead Qualification
The second stage in the funnel is Qualification. In this stage, you (or the person to 
whom specific leads are assigned) validates leads by contacting them, following up, and 
evaluating their interest level, decision-making power, and buying appetite.
You should be capturing every action done on the lead in the CRM. This information 
will help you qualify leads and push them to the next stage, or simply disqualify them and 
move on to the next lead.
Figure 4-1.  A typical sales pipeline

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM

Opportunities
After a lead is qualified, it needs to get “converted.” Conversion turns a qualified lead into 
a contact, an account, and an opportunity (or, potential) for a deal. In the “conversion” 
process, Zoho CRM generates the corresponding Contact, Account, and Opportunity in 
the click of a button.
A lot needs to happen between a lead becoming an opportunity and the actual 
sales happening. Further follow-ups are often needed, followed by sending quotes, sales 
orders, invoices, and hopefully a closed deal at the end.
These steps are documented in a logical and connected way in the CRM, centralizing 
important data and connecting the dots more effectively while keeping valuable 
information safe for future use.
Getting Started with Sales Force Automation
When you first open Zoho CRM (by logging onto http://creator.zoho.com), you are 
welcomed by the Getting Started page (Figure 4-2) inviting you to perform a number of 
common tasks. For now, you can ignore this page.
■
■Warning  Although Zoho CRM offers powerful tools out-of-the-box for you to get started 
almost immediately and use it in day-to-day business, it is imperative to understand all 
the relevant aspects of your business processes and customize CRM accordingly. These 
customizations could be as simple as renaming a module name, or as sophisticated as 
creating custom modules and adding complex workflows. We will learn how to make Zoho 
CRM the rock solid tool your business needs as we go forward.
Figure 4-2.  Getting Started page

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
64
To start, click on the Classic View link on the top right of the Getting Started page to 
switch the view.
The Classic View shows the bird’s eye view of your business. Of course, there is not 
much to see here when you first start (Figure 4-3): however, after populating CRM you will 
start seeing valuable information in real time.
By default, the Classic View shows tasks, events, and the sales pipeline (or, funnel, 
whichever lingo works for you). There is also a Customized View (Figure 4-4), which 
shows a list of open (i.e., incomplete) tasks, today’s leads, deals closing this month, and 
the pipeline. You can add or remove components to this page to turn it into a powerful 
dashboard showing the live state of your sales efforts and helping you monitor and 
manage the sales force more efficiently.

Managing Leads
As mentioned in a previous section, lead management is an inseparable part of the CRM 
process in general and obviously Zoho CRM itself. Leads module is one of the essential 
modules in Zoho CRM and is closely connected with other modules, such as Deals.
Any organization that does some sort of sales of goods and services must take 
managing leads seriously. No matter the quantity and quality of the leads generated, 
if they are not managed properly, chances are that the business is losing valuable 
opportunities that can turn into profitable deals in the short or the long run.
Adding a New Lead
Let’s start exploring the essential lead management features of Zoho CRM by creating a 
single lead manually:
	
1.	
Click on the + (plus sign) on the right-hand side of the main 
menu bar and then select Lead from the drop-down menu 
(Figure 4-5). Alternatively, you can open the Leads page  
(from the top menu bar) and click the New Lead button.
Figure 4-4.  Customized View
Figure 4-5.  Creating a new lead

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
66
	
2.	
In the Create Lead page (Figure 4-6), put in as much 
information as you have about a lead, especially Company 
and Lead Name, as they are both mandatory fields for a lead.
	
3.	
Once you are done with entering all the available information 
for the lead, click on the Save button in the bottom of the 
form. The new lead gets created and displayed in the lead 
details page (Figure 4-7).
Figure 4-6.  Populating the lead form

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
67
Figure 4-7.  The lead page

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
68
	
4.	
You can repeat these steps and add as many leads as you need. 
To see the list of all leads, click Leads on the main menu bar 
(Figure 4-8).
■
■Note  If you don’t see the Leads item in the menu bar, click on the (…) link on the menu 
bar. Then find Leads in the drop-down extension of the menu. Zoho hides the item used less 
frequently under the (…) and shows the regularly used items. Although this is unlikely to 
happen for Leads, as it should be a frequently accessed module; however, it’s good to keep 
this in mind for other less frequent modules.
Interacting with Leads
In addition to the basic information, such as name and company, each lead comes with 
the ability of connecting important and relevant pieces of information to it, such as notes, 
attachments, and tasks.
You can (and you should) manage virtually every bit of information relevant to a lead 
from a central place, the lead detail page. This centralization of information helps the 
person in charge of the lead and other concerned team members to stay productive and 
keep the information that may prove crucial in the future in a single place.
Now, open the lead you just created and follow these steps to add a few more pieces 
of information to our lead:
	
1.	
In the lead page, under Notes section, click Add Note and type 
in some notes for the lead (Figure 4-9).
Figure 4-8.  First lead in the leads list
Figure 4-9.  Adding notes for a lead

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
69
	
2.	
Under the Attachment section, click Attach. A drop-down 
menu opens, providing you with different ways of attaching 
a document to this lead, including uploading from your 
computer, or from cloud storage services, such as Zoho Docs 
and Google Drive (Figure 4-10). Choose one of the scenarios 
and attach one or more files to the lead.
	
3.	
Under Open Activities, there are three types of activities to 
choose from: Task, Event, and Call. You can add a list of to 
dos, log of phone calls, and events (e.g., future meetings) with 
the specific lead in here. Click New Task to continue.
	
4.	
In the Create Task form, type in the mandatory Subject of the 
task and other optional fields (Figure 4-11). You can set up a 
due date and a reminder for the task. Zoho CRM will send you 
notifications to remind you about an approaching task. Click 
Save when you are done.
Figure 4-10.  Attaching files to a lead

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
70
	
5.	
When you complete an open activity and change its status 
to Complete, it automatically moves under Closed Activities 
(Figure 4-12). Open the task you created in the previous step 
and set it to Complete. It will automatically move from Open 
Activities to Closed Activities.
Figure 4-12.  Closed Activites for a lead
Figure 4-11.  Adding tasks for a lead

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
71
	
6.	
Last, but not least, you can send emails to a lead from within 
the lead page. This is great, because it helps you keep a 
complete log of your communications with a specific lead 
in one place along with everything else about the lead. 
Under Emails click Send Email. In the Send Email dialog box 
(Figure 4-13), type in your message. Click Send after you are 
happy with the content of your message and it will be sent to 
your lead immediately.
Feel free to add more items for the lead and see how each section works.
Importing Multiple Leads
Adding leads one by one is a straightforward task in Zoho CRM. There is also the Zoho 
CRM mobile app for the people on the go, so you can add new leads on your way back 
from a successful meeting instead of spending time on Instagram.
But how about when you need to add multiple leads quickly and efficiently? For 
instance, if a large list of leads is generated from an email campaign, or you have a helpful 
admin person to digitize a million business cards you accumulated in a recent exhibition 
you attended?
Figure 4-13.  Sending email to a lead

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM

Thankfully, Zoho CRM has a feature that allows you to import leads in bulk sans the 
joy of keying them in one by one. This is particularly easy if you have the list of leads in 
an Excel or CSV (Comma Separated Values) file. The data in such a list must be properly 
organized and all mandatory fields (Lead Name and Company are mandatory by default) 
are populated for each row.
Let’s learn how this is done in Zoho CRM. If you have your leads already stored 
nicely and cleanly in an Excel or CSV file, you can ignore the first three steps of the 
following instruction set and go directly to step 4.
Otherwise, for the purpose of this exercise, we need to first create a dummy list and 
then import it into CRM. There is a lifesaving website called generatedata.com, which 
helps you create dummy data tables populated with random information. We use this site 
to create our list of dummy leads:
	
1.	
In your web browser, log onto http://generatedata.com.
	
2.	
Under Generate tab, enter “Leads” as filename, then create 
data columns starting with First Name as displayed in 
Figure 4-14. You can add new rows to add more data columns 
by clicking Row(s) button below the list.
Figure 4-14.  Creating dummy data on generatedata.com

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
73
	
3.	
When you are finished with adding all the data columns, 
make sure the CSV tab is selected under Export Types, then 
enter a single comma (,) for Delimiter char(s).
	
4.	
Leave other fields as they are and click the Generate button 
on the bottom of the page. The list will be generated within 
seconds and automatically downloads to your computer. 
Depending on your operating system and browser settings, 
you may get a message box asking you to confirm the 
download.
	
5.	
Open the downloaded CSV file. The data should look like 
Figure 4-15. Quite good for random information!
	
6.	
Now switch back to Zoho CRM, open the Leads page, and 
click on the Import button on the top right of the leads list. 
The Import Leads wizard will open (Figure 4-16).
Figure 4-15.  Snapshot of the dummy data
Figure 4-16.  Import Leads wizard

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
74
	
7.	
In the Import Leads page, select Import My Leads, which will 
set the lead owner to your name.
	
8.	
Click Choose File button to select the leads CSV file you 
downloaded (or you had from before).
	
9.	
Select Overwrite for Duplicate Record, and set Find duplicates 
using to Email.
■
■Note  This setting will tell CRM to consider two (or more) leads the same if they have 
the same email address and then overwrite the older lead (if already existing in the CRM) 
with the new one that is just being imported. This doesn’t mean that the older lead will be 
completely replaced by the new one, rather only the fields that exist on both existing and the 
importing leads will take the value of the importing lead. For this particular example, where 
we are working with dummy data, we don’t worry about existing information, but in an 
operational system where valuable lead information already exists, a simple overwrite could 
delete existing information partially or completely. So, depending on the scenario choose 
Clone or Skip for duplicate leads.
	
10.	
Click Next to continue. The import wizard will upload the CSV 
file and load the columns it found in the file for you to map to 
the matching fields in the CRM Leads module (Figure 4-17).

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
75
Figure 4-17.  Mapping fields

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
76
	
11.	
Review the fields and make sure each column is mapped to 
the corresponding column in CRM. Other than the mandatory 
fields that are indicated with a red label, you can skip 
mapping for the information you don’t have.
	
12.	
Click Next to continue. In the next step (Figure 4-18), CRM 
may show you the columns in the CSV file that are not 
mapped to Leads in the CRM. Ignore the message and click 
Import to continue.
	
13.	
The import wizard will import the data and show you a report 
of how many rows were imported in total, how many added to 
CRM, how many existing ones updated (because we chose to 
overwrite), and how many skipped due to errors (Figure 4-19). 
Also, a sample list of imported information will be shown. 
Review the import and click Done if you are happy, or Undo 
Import if you found an issue and you want to start over.
Figure 4-19.  Bulk leads import complete
Figure 4-18.  Confirming unmapped columns

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
77
Great. The import is done and you can start working with them (Figure 4-20). Feel 
free to navigate through leads, change values, and delete some of them to familiarize 
yourself more with the Leads module.
Bulk Operations
From the previous section, you can see that in our newly imported list, Lead Source is 
missing, because it was not in the CSV file and the import wizard left the value empty for 
all imported records.
Since lead source is an important piece of information, we want to populate this 
value for the leads. One way is to open each lead and set the Lead Source, but that is too 
much work, especially if lead source for all of these leads is the same (a trade show, or 
online campaign). Such scenarios happen often and you need bulk operations to perform 
repeated data manipulation faster and stay productive.
Mass Updating Leads
Fortunately, Zoho CRM offer mass updating features for leads and other modules, so we 
can go about changing the lead source of all newly important leads in one go following 
these steps:
Figure 4-20.  List of all leads in the CRM

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
78
	
1.	
In the Leads page, click on the … button on the top right of 
the page and select Mass Update in the drop-down menu 
(Figure 4-21).
	
2.	
In the next page (Figure 4-22), under Criteria Component 
select Lead Owner for the first criterion, then select is and 
then type in your name. This means that the mass update 
will be performed only on the leads whose owner is the 
current user, preserving other people’s leads from being mass 
updated.
	
3.	
Click the green (+) button next to criterion #1 to add another 
criterion. Then select Lead Status, and is empty (Figure 4-23).  
This ensures a mass update happens only on your leads 
whose Lead Status is not set yet, sparing the ones with existing 
lead status.

Click Search to see a list of leads that match the above criteria 
(Figure 4-24).

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
80
	
5.	
Click Mass Update button on the top-left side of the list.  
A dialog box will open asking which field you want to mass 
update (Figure 4-25). Select Lead Source in the drop-down list.
	
6.	
In the next screen (Figure 4-26), a drop-down list will be 
shown with a list of different values for the Lead Source. Select 
“Trade Show” and click Save.

leads

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
81
After clicking save, as you can see in Figure 4-27, all leads matching the criteria set 
above will have their Lead Status set to “Trade Show.”
Mass Transferring Leads
In Zoho CRM, each lead has an owner who is a registered Zoho CRM user. By default the 
lead owner of a new lead (or leads) is the user who created the lead. This, of course, can 
change by editing a lead and transferring the lead ownership to someone else; however, 
there are times that you need to transfer multiple leads to another user.
Suppose for the leads you imported previously, you need to distribute them among 
the sales team, so they can start contacting them and hopefully turn them into sales. 
A number of factors may be considered when distributing leads, such as geographical 
territory, type of lead, etc. In the following example, we will transfer a number of leads 
to a team member using the simple logic of transferring only the leads whose company 
names starts with an “a.” Not exactly a scientific method of leads distribution, but it serves 
the purpose here.
	
1.	
In the Leads page, click on the … button on the top right of the 
page and select Mass Transfer from the drop-down list.
	
2.	
In the Leads Mass Transfer page, put in your user name in 
Transfer From and the user name of the new lead owner in 
Transfer To.
	
3.	
Under Specify Criteria, select Company and starts with, then 
enter “a” in the value text box and click Search (Figure 4-28).
Figure 4-27.  Mass update took effect for all the leads selected previously.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
82
	
4.	
Review the search results to ensure the leads about to be 
transferred are correct. Then click Transfer to proceed. The 
leads will transfer to the new owner (Figure 4-29).

Finding Leads
Soon you will have tens and hundreds of leads in the CRM waiting for your champion 
salespeople to turn into lucrative sales and loyal customers. More leads means you can no 
longer rely on the list of leads to find who you are looking for. A good CRM system must 
offer advanced and fast search tools and Zoho CRM is no exception.
Searching for Leads
In Zoho CRM, the quickest way of finding leads (and other information) is to use the 
global search. The global search is accessible throughout CRM by clicking on the 
magnifier button on the top menu bar (Figure 4-30). Simply type in the name of a lead, 
company, source, or basically anything you can remember about the information you are 
looking for.
By default, any piece of information that contains the search term (“acme,” in this 
example) in any of its data fields will be pulled from across the CRM and listed in the 
search results. You can see in Figure 4-31 that the search results shows account, contacts, 
deals, and tasks. The result will vary for you as you have different information stored in 
your CRM account.
Figure 4-30.  Searching for a term in the entire CRM
Figure 4-31.  Global search results

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
84
On the results page, you can click on any of the results found and access the 
corresponding information. For instance, clicking on a task will open the detail’s 
respective task.
Notice at the bottom of the results page, there is a gray info-bar listing the modules (e.g. 
Leads, Events, etc.) in which the search didn’t find any results. This means there were no 
leads in my account (i.e., current user) that contains “acme” in any shape or form.
Narrowing Down the Search Scope
Searching the CRM globally is quite handy and often finds the information you are 
looking for; however, these results can get crowded depending on the size of the 
information kept in the CRM and also how generic the search term is.
One good way of quickly narrowing down the scope of your search is to choose 
which CRM module the global search should look into. To do so, in the search results 
page, click the magnifier icon on the top left of the screen and choose the target modules 
(Figure 4-32).
For example, if you are looking to extract the contact information of everyone in a 
company and see if there are any events scheduled for that company, you can deselect all 
modules in the list and only keep Contacts and Events and then click Search.
Figure 4-32.  Choosing which modules to search in

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
85
Filtering Through Leads
As mentioned previously the global is powerful and easy to use, but it is designed for 
quick on-off searches. If you tend to look for specific information in a module (including 
Leads) regularly, there is a better way to find the right information: Filters.
As the name suggests, filters let you filter the long list of leads and see only what you 
are looking for more quickly and more efficiently. The big advantage of filters is that they 
can be saved for later use, without the need for entering the search term every time.
To see them in action, let’s apply a filter to the list of leads:
	
1.	
In the Leads page, select Lead Owner in the list of fields on 
the left side of the screen and then select is and type in a user 
name (Figure 4-33). The list of leads immediately changes, 
showing only the leads that match the filter.
	
2.	
To use this filter again in the future, click Save Filter button on 
the bottom left of the screen and enter a suitable filter name 
(Figure 4-34). Click Save Filter to proceed.
The new filter will be listed under filters and is ready to use in the click of a button.

Views
As you have seen a number of times in this chapter before, when you open the Leads 
module, by default a list of leads is shown in the leads page.
These lists are called Views and are one of the powerful features of Zoho CRM. As 
the name suggests, View gives different ways of viewing your information. One of the 
fundamental characteristics of good software is that users enter information once (e.g., 
add new leads) and output this information in different ways. The difference in output of 
information is often about formatting, order, data set, and output medium.
For instance, one view will show all the leads in the system, while another will only 
show the current user’s leads entered today. Also a view can output its data on the screen, 
to a CSV file, or a PDF document to be sent by email to a third party.
Let’s start our tour of the Views by having a look at two of the most common existing 
views in Zoho CRM.
The first one is All Views, which is accessible by simply opening the Leads module. 
To open other views, you need to click on the view selector button on the top left of the 
screen just below the top menu bar and select any other view (Figure 4-35).
Figure 4-35.  Choosing My Leads view

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
87
Figure 4-36 show My Leads view, which shows the list of leads belonging to the 
current user.
You can see that in the view, the Lead Owner column is not shown simply because 
we already know who the lead owner is. Another characteristic of good software is to 
show only the relevant and necessary information and avoid information clutter as much 
as possible. You will see in the upcoming sections that you can customize and create 
views. Keeping this small but important point in mind helps you create useful views for 
your users.
Customizing Views
There is a good collection of preexisting views in Zoho CRM; however, every business has 
different needs and sooner or later you will need views of your own. The quickest way to 
have your own views is to customize the existing ones.
To modify My Leads, which is an existing view, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open the My Leads view.
	
2.	
Click the … button on the top right of the view and select Edit 
View. The view editor will open for My Leads view (Figure 4-37).
Figure 4-36.  My Leads view

Under Choose Columns section, select Lead Status from 
Available fields to add it to Selected fields (Figure 4-38).

Creating Custom Views
Sometimes you need more than just customizing a few things in an existing view. In such 
a case, creating a new view from scratch is the best option.
Suppose we need a view that shows all the leads without a Lead Status in the system 
(i.e., for all users), so we can identify and assign status to them. To create this view follow 
these steps:
	
1.	
Open Leads from the top menu bar.
	
2.	
Click the … button on the top right of the view and select  
Add View. The view editor will open (Figure 4-40).
	
3.	
Enter “No-status Leads” in view name textbox where it 
currently reads Untitled View (Figure 4-41).
	
4.	
Under Specify Criteria, select Lead Source and is empty.
Figure 4-40.  Creating a custom view

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
91
	
5.	
Under Choose Columns, select and add First Name, Last 
Name, Company, Email, and Leads Source from the Available 
list to the Selected list.
	
6.	
Under Share this with, select Only me to make this view 
available only to you (the current user).
	
7.	
Click Save to create the new view. The view will be added to 
the list of existing views and open for use (Figure 4-42).
Figure 4-41.  Setting view properties

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
92
EXERCISE
As a supervisor, you need a view to show you if there are 
leads entered in the CRM with no action taken on them for 
more than 7 days, and then act accordingly.
Create a new view that shows open leads created before 7 days ago, with no action 
taken on them, that is, no status change, visible only to you, the admin user. Show 
lead name, email address, owner, source, and status.
Converting Leads
If you remember from the beginning of this chapter, we talked about various stages of the 
sales funnel. After Lead generation and qualification comes opportunity creation, which 
is the result of successfully converting qualified leads.
In Zoho CRM, once you deem a lead qualified, you can “convert” it manually. This 
will create up to three new objects in the CRM: a new contact, an account, and a deal 
(opportunity).
To convert a lead, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open a lead you want to convert and in the lead detail page 
(Figure 4-43), click on the green Convert button.
Figure 4-42.  The new custom view in action

2.	
In the Convert Lead page (Figure 4-44), review the first two 
rows of information indicating that a new account and a new 
contact are going to be created in the process of conversion.

3.	
Check (select) Create a new Deal for this Account and enter 
the deal information as you see in Figure 4-44. Notice the 
important fields that indicate the projected amount of this 
deal (opportunity), projected closing date, and the current 
stage of the deal.
	
4.	
Select Contact or Deal to move the existing attachments in the 
lead (if any) to the new contact or the deal.
	
5.	
Set the Owner of the records, that is, the user who will be 
owning the account, contact, and the deal in the CRM.
	
6.	
Click Convert to convert the lead and create corresponding 
records. A confirmation screen will show the output of the 
conversion (Figure 4-45).
You can click on any of the newly created accounts (Figure 4-46), contact (Figure 4-47), 
and the deal (see next section) to view their details and immediately continue working  
on them.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM

Notice how both the account and the contact have a section for deals giving you a 
quick overview of the ongoing deals for each record.
Similar to leads, you can fully manage (edit, export, print, send email, etc.) accounts 
and contacts from within the detail page. Spend a few minutes reviewing the sort of 
information stored for each of these records and see how you can use them in your  
day-to-day business.
■
■Note  You can customize all Zoho modules, such as leads, accounts, and contacts, to a 
good extent. You can add new fields; remove the ones that do not apply to your business; 
and change the behavior of the existing one, for example, make a specific field mandatory. 
We will learn about this in a later chapter.
Deals
Deals hold the live summary of what is happening with an opportunity. Figure 4-48 shows 
all the details of a deal we created in the previous section.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
97
Figure 4-48.  The Deal created during lead conversion

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
98
Vital information, such as contact information, current stage of the deal in the 
pipeline, the history of stage change, notes, tasks, and other related information are all 
listed here in one place.
There are also other pieces of information that you can add to the deal as you go 
forward. Among other things, you can manage the list of competitors who may impact 
the deal, products being sold in this deal, sales order sent to the potential client, and the 
email correspondence. Once a lead is converted, this page will be the command center 
for the user in charge of the deal.
Keeping the Stage Up to Date
As you go forward with the deal in real life, the stage in which the deal is in the CRM 
should change too. This is particularly important to keep the sales pipeline in the reports 
and the people concerned with sales performance in your organization up to date.
You can easily do this by selecting a relevant stage from the Stage graph in the deal 
details page (Figure 4-49). In the graph, the current stage is shown as a green circle while 
previous stages are indicated as green check marks and future stages are grayed out. By 
default, the last three stages of a deal indicate if it is a win or a loss. Visually, these stages 
are indicated with thumbs-up or thumbs-down icons.
To select an applicable stage, simply click on the next stage (gray circle) in line or 
jump and select another future stage. You can hover on a stage to see its name.
In an upcoming section, you will learn how to customize the deal stages to match 
your sales process.
Viewing Deals
To quickly see all active deals in the system in one place, click on Deals on the top menu 
bar. The All Deals view will show all deals grouped by stage (Figure 4-50). Click on each 
deal listed in the view to see its details.
Figure 4-49.  Moving a Deal along the sale funnel

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
99
All Deals view has two ways of displaying deals: one is the default-by-stage view, and 
the other is the simple list view. You can switch between these two by clicking on the list 
and bar icons on the top right of the screen.
Also, there are filters for you to select (from the left sidebar) to narrow down the list, 
in case there are many deals listed here. You can choose to see deals only for a specific 
account, stage, lead source, etc.
Similar to other modules, you can select other available views from the view selector 
drop-down on the top left of the screen and see, for example, only your own deals, deals 
closing this month, etc.
It is also worth reminding you that you can customize these views by clicking Edit 
next to the view selector drop-down and also create new views from scratch by clicking 
Create New item in the drop-down.
Homepage Dashboard
As you enter information in the CRM and keep it up to date, the homepage dashboard 
turns into a powerful place to quickly see the state of your business in one page.
By default, two of the four Components (what Zoho calls the building blocks of the 
dashboard page) show the list of the deals closing this month and the graph of the sales 
pipeline by stage, not surprisingly shaped like a funnel.
In Figure 4-51, you can see that there is only one deal closing this month and judging 
by the funnel, the majority of the deals are still in the qualification stage. Now, if this were 
a real business, you may have needed to ask the sales team some serious questions.
Figure 4-50.  Deals page with all deals listed in different stages of the pipeline

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM

You can make the homepage more powerful and add more views and dashboards  
by clicking on the Add Component button (green plus sign) in the bottom of the page  
and choose from available views and dashboards in the CRM. I leave exploring this 
feature to you.
Customizing Stages
As you learned in a previous section, deals move forward in the pipeline from one stage to 
another until they are won or lost. Making sure deals are in the right stage will give you an 
accurate view of your business, so it is important to ensure these stages reflect your sales 
process correctly.
Figure 4-51.  Homepage dashboard showing the state of the business

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
101
By default, Zoho provisions nine different stages in which a deal can be in: 
Qualification, Needs Analysis, Value Propositions, etc. You can modify the name of existing 
stages, add new ones, and remove the ones you don’t need. Note that these customizations 
are global (i.e., organization wide) and will apply affect all deals in the CRM.
To customize the deal stages, follow these steps:
	
1.	
On the top bar, on the right, click on the tools icon, and then 
click on Setup (Figure 4-52).
	
2.	
In the Setup page, under Customization group, click on Modules. 
A new page will open with all the CRM modules listed
	
3.	
In the modules list, hover the mouse cursor on Deals, click  
on the (…) button appearing next to Deals, and select  
Stage-Probability Mapping in the context menu (Figure 4-53).
Figure 4-52.  Opening the Setup page
Figure 4-53.  List of CRM modules

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
102
	
4.	
In the Stage-Probability Mapping dialog box, modify stage 
name, probability, forecast type, and forecast category for 
each stage you need to customize. Use the + and – buttons 
next to each stage to add a new stage or remove the respective 
stage (Figure 4-54).
	
5.	
Click Save to apply the changes.
■
■Warning  Be extra cautious when you make changes in the Setup area. These are global 
configurations of the CRM, and the smallest change may affect the entire organization or the 
data in a negative way. Make sure you back up data and remember the changes you make 
(takes notes, or screenshots), so you can undo the steps if something goes wrong.
Quotes
As mentioned in the previous section, a deal goes through various stages in the sales 
pipeline. By default, one of these stages is Proposal/Price Quote, which as the name 
suggests, is for when you reach a point in your deal that you need to send the potential  
(or returning) client a quotation for the products or services you intend to sell to them.
Sending quotations is a common stage in any deal. In fact, you may send multiple 
quotes with adjusted prices and terms, until the client is happy to proceed with the deal.
Figure 4-54.  Customizing Stage-Probability Mappings for deals

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
103
You can create quotes for an ongoing deal or directly in the Quotes module.  
I recommend the former, because it makes creating the quote easier and attaches it  
to the deal automatically.
Follow these steps to create a quote for a deal:
	
1.	
Open the deals module and open a deal.
	
2.	
In the deal detail page, click on Create + New under Quotes 
section (Figure 4-55).
	
3.	
In the Create Quote page, enter Subject, and Valid Until 
(Figure 4-56). Note that Quote Owner, Quote Stage, 
Deal Name, Contact Name, Account Name, and Address 
Information are prepopulated based on the deal information.

104
	
4.	
Under the Product Details section, click Add Line Items.  
A Choose Products form will open (Figure 4-57).
	
5.	
In Products Details, type in the product name you want to add 
to the list. You can enter the product name partially. CRM will 
look for any similar products and will show a list for you to 
pick from.
	
6.	
If the product is not found, click on the + Add New Product 
link to open the Quick Create: Product form (Figure 4-58).
Figure 4-57.  Adding products to the quote

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
105
	
7.	
In the quick create form, type in the product information as 
shown in Figure 4-58 and click Save when you are done.
	
8.	
Repeat from step 4 and create another product as shown in 
Figure 4-59. Click Save to continue.
	
9.	
Back in the Choose Product form (Figure 4-60) you have two 
products in the list. Click the Add Products button to continue.
	
10.	
The two products are added to the quote with the total 
amount of the quote calculated and placed nicely below the 
list items (Figure 4-61). As a last step, populate Terms and 
Conditions and click Save to create the quote.
Figure 4-59.  Creating a second product on-the-fly
Figure 4-60.  Two newly created products ready to be aded to the quote

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
106
The newly created quote will be listed under Quotes section in the deal details page 
(Figure 4-62). You can access the quote details or modify it from here. You can also add 
new quotes for the same deal.
Figure 4-61.  A fully populated quote ready for saving

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
107
Quotes are also accessible in the Quotes module. Click on Quotes on the top menu 
bar and a list of all quotes will be shown. You can click on each quote and see the details, 
modify, print, or export them to into PDF documents to send to concerned parties 
(Figure 4-63).
Emailing Quotes
To send quotes to clients, you can export them to PDF and email them to clients and 
other people. You can also kill more trees and print them on paper to send them by snail 
mail (killing even more trees) or fax them if the other party lives in the previous century.
The better way, however, is to email quotes directly to the client (i.e., the contact 
mentioned in the quote) from within the CRM. To do this, follow these steps:

Figure 4-63.  Details of the newly creted quote in the corresponding Quote page

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
108
	
1.	
In the quote detail page, open the … menu on the top right of 
the screen and click Send Mail on the drop-down menu. The 
Send Mail form will open (Figure 4-64).
	
2.	
Choose Quote Template from Choose an Inventory Template 
drop-down list. The quote will be formatted based on the 
template chosen and a preview will be displayed on the right 
side (Figure 4-65). Click Next to continue.

3.	
The Send Mail window will load ready for you to populate 
the message body. To field is already populated from the 
quote contact and the quote itself is attached to the message 
(Figure 4-66).
	
4.	
Click Send once you are happy with the message body. Your 
client will receive an email from you with the quote attached.
Customized Templates
In the previous section, you used a template for a quote. Templates in Zoho are 
predesigned pages that contain visual elements as well as placeholders for information to 
generate formatted output for quotes, invoices, emails, etc.
Templates help save time and also create a uniform way of generating output 
compliant with the branding guidelines of your business. For example, you can design 
templates that feature your logo and use your brand color and typeface while mentioning 
a generic note in the footer.
Then when you send documents such as quotes and invoices, they look professional 
and have the common elements across the board.
The template you used in the previous section was quite simple and unappealing 
at best. Apart from design, you may want to have different templates for quotes (or other 
modules) that have different elements in them.
Zoho CRM allows you to create complex templates with a great look and feel by 
simply using the template designer, dragging and dropping elements into the template. 
There is also a more advanced option for users who want full flexibility designing with 
HTML and CSS.

■Note  If you are not familiar with HTML and CSS, or not interested in designing Zoho 
CRM templates, now it’s a good time to skip over to the next section.
Creating a Custom Template with HTML and CSS
Follow these steps to create a custom template:
	
1.	
Open the CRM Setup page (Figure 4-67) by clicking the tools 
icon on the right side of the top menu bar and selecting Setup 
from the drop-down menu.
	
2.	
In the Setup page, click on Templates under Customization 
section. The Templates page will open, listing the existing 
templates (Figure 4-68).
	
3.	
There are three template categories: Email, Inventory, and 
Mail Merge. Click the Inventory button on top of the page to 
see a list of templates specifically designed for inventory-
related templates such as quotes and invoices.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
111
	
4.	
While in the Inventory list, click the (blue) New Template 
button on the left side of the list.
	
5.	
In the Create Inventory Template form (Figure 4-69), select 
Quotes for Select Module and click Next.
Figure 4-69.  Creating a new template for quotes
Figure 4-70.  Template editor
	
6.	
In the template designer page (Figure 4-70), click on the 
“<html>” icon (next to the smiley face) on the toolbar. Instead 
of using the rich text editor, we are going to paste some HTML 
code in here.
	
7.	
In your browser, open https://github.com/sparksuite/
simple-html-invoice-template (Figure 4-71). This is a 
modern and minimal invoice template you can use in your 
template and modify to your liking.

To make the template work for you, add Merge Fields to its 
body, so these fields get replaced with real data relevant to a 
quote when a quote is generated (Figure 4-75). You can select 
the Merge Fields by selecting them from the two dropdowns 
on the top of the template deisgner and then copying and 
pasting the generated code in to the content.

Once you are done with designing the quote template, click 
the Save button. The template designer will close and you will 
be redirected to the list of existing templates (Figure 4-76). 
You can go back and edit these templates or create new ones 
for different purposes.
Figure 4-77 shows our newly created quote template in action. You can see that the 
merge fields are replaced with actual values from the quote.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
116
Converting Quotes to Sales Orders
A Sales Order (SO) is a confirmation document sent to the customer before delivering 
goods or services. In contrast, a Purchase Order (PO) is an order placed for procuring 
products or services from your vendors.
SO can be created once the quote is accepted by your customer often via a PO sent 
by the customer for further processing.
After sending your (the seller) the PO, the customers may request an SO to know the 
exact date of delivery of the goods or services. Also, the inventory/production department  
(if there is one) looks at the list of Sales Orders to see what needs to be shipped out and when.
Similar to quotes, you can create SOs directly in the Sales Orders module. The 
recommended way, however, is to convert a quote to an SO, so most of the information in 
the SO populates automatically from the quote and a logical connection between SO and 
other related documents is created.
■
■Note  If in your business, creating SOs are not common and you create invoices right 
after a quote is accepted or a PO is received, you can convert a quote directly to an invoice, 
skipping the whole SO creation.
To convert a quote to an SO simply open it and click the (green) Convert button on the 
top of the quote details. Then select Sales Order from the drop-down menu (Figure 4-78).
Figure 4-78.  Converting a quote to a sales order
Once the new SO is created it is displayed for you to review and perform other tasks 
on it. As you can see in Figure 4-79, the SO is quite similar to the corresponding quote 
as it gets its fields from the quote. However, there are subtle differences, such as the SO 
Number vs. Quote Number, Status vs. Stage, and the addition of Sales Commission field.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
117
You can also see that there is a link to the corresponding quote and deal under Sales 
Order Information section, Quote Name, and Deal Name.
One more thing about the SO is to make sure you change the Status field as you go 
forward to reflect the actual status of the SO. As mentioned in the previous sections, you 
can change the values in the Status list in the Setup page under Modules.
Converting Sales Orders to Invoices
Once the sales stage reaches its final phase, you may start working on the payment 
procedure and, obviously, the invoice. This is an important stage for both sales and 
accounting purposes as it completes the sales process and begins the accounting process.
An invoice usually contains the PO reference number, date, address information, 
payment terms, line items (products/services) with quantities and prices as well as 
(optional) tax and discount information.
Again, you have the option of creating invoices from scratch, or converting a quote or 
SO to an invoice, bringing all the information from the base document.
Follow these steps to convert an SO to an invoice:
Not enough product in the inventory; go and change to 10 each; come back to sales 
order; convert.
Now if you go back to the Products page and check the Quantity in Stock, you will 
see that the number is changed to the balance of previous stock minus the number of 
products in the sales order.
You can add to the inventory either manually as you just saw, or through issuing POs.
Exercise: Order new products for the inventory by creating a new PO.
Figure 4-79.  Sales order details

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
118
Hint: You will need to add a new Vendor to be able to issue a PO. If you get stock, refer 
to Zoho CRM documentation.1
This basic inventory management is handy, but for complex operations it will never 
replace proper inventory management.
You can email or print invoices similar to sales orders and quotes. By default, there 
is one minimal invoice template available in the CRM. You can create nicely designed 
invoice templates similar to the ones you created for the quotes in a previous section.
	
1.	
Open the SO you created in the previous section.
	
2.	
In the SO page, click on the (green) Convert button on top of 
the SO details and select Invoice in the drop-down menu.
	
3.	
Depending on how much stock you have of the products that 
are in the quote list items, you may get a warning about low 
inventory levels (Figure 4-80). Click Cancel to proceed.
	
4.	
Open Products page (Figure 4-81) and find the products with a 
low quantity in the stock.
■
■Note  By default the All Products view doesn’t show the value of Quantity in Stock. You 
need to either check the products one by one, to see the quantity for each one, which is a 
pain; or you can quickly edit the view and add the extra column Quantity in Stock to it.
Figure 4-80.  Converting a sales order to invoice interrupted, due to not enough stock of the 
inventory

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
119
	
5.	
In the product details page change the Quantity in Stock value 
to an arbitrary number (because we are testing; otherwise this 
should match the real number in your inventory). Then click 
Save to apply the changes (Figure 4-82).
	
6.	
Now go back to the SO and convert it to an invoice. The 
invoice gets created immediately and you will be redirected to 
the invoice detail page (Figure 4-83).
Figure 4-82.  Changing Quanitity in Stock for a product
Figure 4-83.  Details of the converted invoice

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
120
Take a moment and review the fields in the invoice. Many values are brought from 
the underlying SO (or quote, depending which one you converted).
Quite similar to quotes and SOs, you can print invoices, export them to PDFs, and 
send them via email to your clients directly from CRM.
Reports
You remember from the beginning of this chapter when we argued that one of the 
fundamental traits of good software is that you (the user) enters information once and 
then you can extract it by different means, each serving a specific purpose.
We have learned how to create leads, deals, quotes, etc., in Zoho CRM. We also 
learned that we can see this information through various avenues, by navigating through 
views and detail pages or searching through each module, or globally.
Zoho CRM provides yet another way of outputting information that it reports. 
Reports are read-only (you can’t edit the data in a report), formatted, and often complex 
representation of the information in the CRM.
Similar to other entities, such as quotes and invoices, you can print, export, or email 
them. You can also define user-level and role-based access to the reports to specify who 
sees which report.
Using Existing Reports
Zoho CRM comes with a host of premade reports for most common scenarios. In many 
cases, they are quite usable out-of-the-box, or good to go with a little bit of tweaking.
To access the reports, you need to open the Reports module by clicking on Reports 
on the top menu bar. A list of all existing reports in the CRM will be shown by default 
(Figure 4-84). These reports are divided into smaller categories based on the contents of 
the reports, for example, Lead Reports; or based on other criteria to make them easier to 
find, such as, Recent Reports. These categories are accessible from the left sidebar.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
121
One nifty categorization is the Favorite Reports, which as the name suggests, allows 
you to group your favorite reports in one place.
To add a report to favorites, simply click on the gray star next to any report in the list, 
and the star will turn gold and the report will be added to the Favorite Reports.
Let’s have a look at two of the available reports. The first one is Leads by Status, which 
shows all the leads grouped by their status (Figure 4-85). This report has two parts, a pie 
chart on the top providing a quick and visual representation of state of the leads in the 
organization, followed by a list of leads with more details and also grouped by the status.
Figure 4-84.  List of default reports in Zoho CRM

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
122
The second one is Pipeline by Stage, which again is a two-part report with a funnel 
showing the volume of the deals in each stage of the pipeline on the top of the report. 
There is also a detailed list of pipeline stages and the deals in each stage, including the 
sum of the amount per stage (Figure 4-86).

Creating New Reports
Of course, Zoho CRM comes with a collection of useful reports out-of-the-box that you 
can use or modify to your liking; however, there are times when you need to create a 
report from scratch. Thankfully CRM comes with a powerful report designer.
Follow these steps to create a new report from scratch:
	
1.	
Open the Reports page and click on the (green) Create Reports 
button on the top right of the list (Figure 4-87).
	
2.	
In the New Report wizard, start by setting module information 
and selecting Deals for the main module, and Contact and 
Quotes for related modules (Figure 4-88).
Figure 4-87.  Creating a new report – picking report type
Figure 4-88.  Selecting the source modules for the new report

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
124
	
3.	
Click Continue to proceed with Report Type. Select Tabular 
Type and click Continue (Figure 4-89).
	
4.	
Under Report Representation, select the columns that will be 
showing in the report according to Figure 4-90. Then click 
Continue.

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
125
	
5.	
Under Filters, Select Deal Closing Date from the first drop-
down, then Current FY in the second one, and set the date 
range to cover the current financial year (Figure 4-91). Click 
Continue.
	
6.	
Finally, under Basic Information, Select Deal Reports from the 
drop-down list, enter “Deals and Quotes” as the report name, 
and provide some description about what the report does 
(Figure 4-92).
Figure 4-92.  Putting in report name and description

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM
126
	
7.	
Click Run to see the report in action (Figure 4-93). If you like 
what you see click Save; otherwise click Edit to make changes 
in the report.
As you can see in Figure 4-94, once you run a report, you can export it to an Excel, 
CSV, or PDF document by clicking on the Export button on the top right of the report.
You can also directly send out the report via email by clicking on the Send Email button.
Forecasting Your Business
One of the main reasons that you keep track of every movement in your business in the 
CRM is to be able to rely on the up-to-date key information and make successful tactical 
and strategic decisions toward the profitable and sustainable growth of your business.
One such piece of key information is the performance of your sales force and how 
close or far they are from hitting their targets. Setting clear, achievable, and yet ambitious 
sales targets allows you to plan for growth and budget for success, that is, depending on 
your strategic plans and projected sales, you allocate budget to areas that contribute to 
business growth and cut back on unnecessary costs.

Zoho CRM offers a Forecast module where you can, as the name suggests, forecast 
and also monitor the short-term and long-term sales performance of your business.
■
■Note  Getting into the details of business forecasting is beyond the scope of this book. 
We will be only scratching the surface by setting a simple forecast in Zoho CRM. If you 
have an (even small) sales force in your company and are serious about the growth of your 
business, I strongly suggest you learn more about business forecasting and also refer to 
Zoho CRM documentation on forecasting: https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/forecasts/.
Creating Your First Forecast
Let’s start by creating a quarterly forecast for our sales team.
	
1.	
On the top menu bar, click on Forecasts. If this is your 
first time here, an introductory text will be shown about 
forecasting and its advantages for your business (Figure 4-95).
	
2.	
Click Get Started to continue. The Forecast Settings page 
will load asking you to enter settings for the new forecast 
(Figure 4-96).
Figure 4-95.  Getting started with forecasting in Zoho CRM

Figure 4-96.  Creating your first forecast
	
3.	
In the Forecast Settings, page select Quarterly for Target 
Period, pick a start for the Fiscal Year, and select Expected 
Revenue for Target Field. Click Save to continue.
	
4.	
You will be faced with a confirmation dialog box indicating 
the choices you just made for the forecast settings. Review 
these choices and click Confirm and Continue to proceed.
	
5.	
In the next screen, Create Forecast for CEO (Figure 4-97), and 
select the appropriate reporting quarter. Then set a target  
(in your currency), set quarterly target for the available 
subroles under the CEO (if any), and finally set individual 
targets for users whose role is CEO (highest role level in Zoho 
CRM by default). Click Save to continue.

6.	
Immediately after the new forecast is created, the current state 
of your business in terms of role and individual performance 
will be reported in the Forecast Summary page (Figure 4-98).

Chapter 4 ■ Running Your Business on Zoho CRM

In the summary page, you may see a red asterisk warning you about a mismatch in 
the target. This happens when the total target amount and the sum of individual targets 
for the subroles and its users don’t match. You can fix this by adjusting the main target, or 
adding to the target amount of the team members.
Summary
This exhaustive chapter took you through the essential skills you need to run a successful 
sales operation using Zoho CRM.
You learned to start managing your sales force and processes with first managing leads 
and then taking them through the sales funnel, guiding them all the way to securing sales.
You learned about various modules, such as Accounts, Contacts, and Deals. You 
then continued to utilize Quotes, Sales Orders, and Invoices to communicate with your 
potential and returning customers.
We also covered reports and forecasting that are both essential for staying on top of 
your business.
This is a very important chapter and the learning will prove essential in your day-to-
day business. Make sure you have a good grasp of all the topics covered here. Zoho CRM 
documentation2 is also a good source of information for more in-depth help.
In the next chapter, we will see how Zoho CRM, with the help of other Zoho suite 
apps, can help you take control of all your marketing efforts.

CHAPTER 5
Take Control of Marketing
In the previous chapter, we learned about managing the sales force and the pipeline. 
However, sales without marketing is like shooting in the dark. A big part of the success of 
any business depends on how it understands the target market and promotes its products 
and services to the right audience in the right time, and on the right promotional channels.
Zoho CRM offers a number of essential tools and features that help you stay on top 
of your marketing game without breaking the bank or going crazy managing a toolset of 
apps from different vendors. There are also a number of complementing Zoho apps that 
can greatly boost your CRM-centric marketing efforts.
Before delving into these tools, let’s quickly touch on some of today’s marketing 
challenges.
Marketing in the World of Micromoments
According to Dr. Philip Kottler, the father of modern marketing, “Marketing is the science 
and art of exploring, creating, and delivering value to satisfy the needs of a target market 
at a profit. Marketing identifies unfulfilled needs and desires. It defines, measures, and 
quantifies the size of the identified market and the profit potential. It pinpoints which 
segments the company is capable of serving best, and it designs and promotes the 
appropriate products and services”.1
The core definition of marketing hasn’t changed, but the tactics, methods, channels, 
and challenges are ever changing. With digital marketing taking over most of the 
marketing efforts of the modern businesses these days, it is very important to utilize the 
latest tools and trends to stay competitive in this noisy market.
In the recent years, mobile has been taking over as a major platform for people to 
interact online. People (in America) spend almost five hours on their phones every day,2 
and we can assume that the rest of the world are following suit.
The average attention span of the modern buyer is less than that of a goldfish (8.25 
seconds, compared to 9 seconds, http://www.statisticbrain.com/attention-span-
statistics/). This is impacted even more by hundreds of marketing messages and a 
million other distractions, such as messages and notifications on various devices that 
bombard people on a daily basis.

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
132
We, as a species, are struggling with unprecedented chronic information fatigue 
and it is only getting worse. So, it is important that you as a business get the most out of 
those precious seconds here and there that customers spend discovering, researching, or 
purchasing. These are called micromoments.
■
■Reference  Google, as the leading platform of digital marketing, has a fantastic 
collection of resources to learn more about the latest trends and best practices of content 
marketing called Think with Google. You can learn about micromoments and ways to turn 
those micromoments into successful marketing opportunities for your brand from  
https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/micro-moments/.
The marketing department of today needs, more than ever, to stay in constant touch 
with other parts of the business, especially sales and client servicing. It also needs to have 
access to an arsenal of tools to perform effective and efficient marketing.
Landing pages, email and social media campaigns, feedback collection, social 
listening, paid (digital) advertising, and other tools and platforms will help you better 
understand your market and tell your story better and to more people.
Campaign Management
Marketing activities often happen within a defined campaign. CRM Campaigns are 
often time bound and have clear objectives and are goal defined. They also have success 
measures defined and the performance of the campaign monitored.
Participating in a trade show, renting a booth in a mall, renting a billboard, and 
running an email campaign, all fit in the definition of a marketing campaign and can all 
be managed within Zoho CRM.
Creating Campaigns
Let’s start learning about Zoho CRM campaign management features by creating our very 
first campaign.
	
1.	
On the top menu bar, click Campaigns. In the Campaigns 
page (Figure 5-1), click Create Campaign to continue.
Figure 5-1.  Campaigns page opened for the first time

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
133
	
2.	
In the Create Campaign page (Figure 5-2), populate the 
campaign details. Campaign Date is the only mandatory field, 
but make sure you enter the Start Date, End Date, Estimated 
Revenue, and Budgeted Cost as every serious campaign needs 
to have this information in place.
	
3.	
After entering campaign details, click Save to store the 
information. Then you will be redirected to the campaign 
details page (Figure 5-3).
Figure 5-2.  Creating a new campaign

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
134
Figure 5-3.  Campaign detail page

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
135
The campaign details page is quite similar to leads and contacts pages in terms of 
look and feel. You can add notes, tasks, and attachments to the campaign. You can also 
add leads, contacts, and deals to the campaign. We will learn more about this in a bit.
When you created the campaign the Status was set to Pending by default. Come back 
and update this field as you go forward with the campaign (Figure 5-4).
Customizing Campaigns Module
Like any other standard module in Zoho CRM, you can customize the Campaigns 
module. You can add, edit, or remove fields to make the module match your business 
requirements.
In the next section, we will be adding leads already existing in the CRM to the 
campaign we just created. For that, we need a specific value to be set to a field called 
Campaign Member Status, which is not available in the preset values by default.
To fix this issue, we need to make a tiny change in the Campaigns module itself:
	
1.	
In Zoho CRM, open the Setup page by clicking on the Tool 
icon on the top menu bar and selecting Setup in the drop-
down menu.
	
2.	
In the Setup page, under Customization, click Modules. A list 
of existing modules will be displayed.
	
3.	
Find Campaigns in the list and hover the mouse cursor on it.  
Then click the circular (…) icon appearing next to it (Figure 5-5)  
and click on Campaigns Member Status item in the drop-down list.
Figure 5-4.  Changing campaign status

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
136
	
4.	
In the customization form (Figure 5-6), add “Visited” to the 
end of the list. This indicates that a person has visited our 
premises (or outlet) in person.
	
5.	
Click Save to apply the changes and close the form.
Adding Leads to Campaigns
The main idea of running a campaign is to generate leads and turn them into paying 
customers down the road. To keep track of the leads generated from a specific campaign 
and then evaluate the performance of that campaign better, you can add leads, contacts, 
and deals to a campaign.
Figure 5-6.  Adding a new member status to Campaigns module
Figure 5-5.  Customizing the Campaigns module

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
137
It is possible to add leads and contacts one by one, or add them in bulk from the 
leads already existing in the CRM. For deals, you can only add them one by one.
Suppose we have generated a number of leads, thanks to our recent participation in 
a trade show in Vancouver, BC. The leads are already in the CRM and now we need to add 
them to the campaign we created previously.
Follow these steps to add leads whose country is set to Canada to the campaign:
	
1.	
In the campaign details page, scroll down to the Leads section 
and click on the Add Exiting Leads link. The Add existing 
Leads to Campaign wizard will open (Figure 5-7).
	
2.	
For the Criteria Component, select “Country,” “is,” and type 
in “Canada” (Figure 5-8). Then click search to see the results, 
that is, the leads with the country field set to Canada.
Figure 5-7.  Adding existing leads to a campaign
Figure 5-8.  Selecting which leads to add to the campaign

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
138
	
3.	
Select all or some of the leads in the result list. These selected 
leads will be added to the campaign.
	
4.	
Select “Visited” in the Select Status drop-down list. This 
value is what we just added to the Campaigns module in the 
previous section.
	
5.	
Click the Add to Campaigns button to proceed. You can see 
the selected leads are added to the campaign and the Member 
Status is set to Visited (Figure 5-9). These are the people who 
dropped by our stand in the trade show.
Webforms
Despite the ever-growing power of social networks, such as Facebook, the most effective 
marketing platforms remain emails.3 The more you grow your email database, the more 
the chance of people seeing your message and acting upon it.
One of the most common ways of collecting email addresses and generating leads 
are HTML forms, often embedded in the contact or inquiry pages of websites. Sign-up 
forms that pop up on the screen or are placed in the footer of websites are also examples 
of webforms.
These forms collect the name, email address, and other information and send it back 
to marketers via email, saving in a database, pushing to email marketing services  
(e.g., Zoho Campaigns, MailChimp) or to CRM solutions (e.g., Zoho CRM, Salesforce).

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
139
Zoho CRM offers an intuitive way to generate forms and embed them into your 
website to collect information from the visitors. This information can then be pushed 
automatically to Leads, Contacts, Cases, or any custom module created in Zoho CRM for 
storing and further processing.
Creating a Webform
To have a form on your website that automatically pushes information collected on your 
site back to the CRM, first you need to create a webform in the CRM.
Suppose we need a simple form on our e-commerce site that collects visitors’ basic 
information to sign them up for our monthly special offer newsletter. Follow these steps 
to create a webform for this purpose:
	
1.	
Open Zoho CRM Setup page. Under Extensions & APIs, click 
on Webforms. The Webforms page opens waiting for you to 
create your first webform (Figure 5-10).
	
2.	
Make sure the “Leads” module is selected in the drop-down 
list and then click the click Create Webform button. The 
webform designer opens (Figure 5-11). 
Figure 5-10.  Leads added to the campaign

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
140
	
3.	
The designer adds two fields to the form by default: Last 
Name and Company. Add two more fields: First Name and 
Email, by dragging them from the fields list on the left sidebar 
and dropping them on the form in the order you see above.
	
4.	
Hover the mouse cursor on the Email field and click on the 
gear icon that shows up next to it (Figure 5-12).
Figure 5-12.  Changing the settings of the Email field
Figure 5-11.  Designing the form in Webform designer

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
141
	
5.	
In the Field Properties dialog box, tick the Mark as required 
field check box to make Email a mandatory field on the 
webform (Figure 5-13). Click Done to get back to the webform 
designer.
	
6.	
Similarly, open Field Properties for the Company field and 
remove the required field check mark (Figure 5-14). Click 
Done to get back to the webform designer.
Figure 5-13.  Making Email field mandatory
Figure 5-14.  Making Company field optional

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
142
	
7.	
Add a new field Lead Source to the bottom of the form. We 
don’t want visitors to see this field. Instead, we need this field 
to set a value to the lead (in CRM) without user input. So, we 
should hide this field.
	
8.	
Open Field Properties for Lead Source (Figure 5-15). Tick Mark 
as hidden field and set the Default Value to Online Store. Click 
Done to get back to the webform designer.
	
9.	
Back in the webform designer feel free to use formatting tools 
available via icons on top of the form to change fonts, colors, 
etc. (Figure 5-16).
Figure 5-15.  Making Lead Source field hidden

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
143
	
10.	
Click on the Preview link on the top right of the designer to see 
how your webform will look like in action (Figure 5-17). Close 
the preview when you are done reviewing the form.
	
11.	
When you are happy with the webform, click Next Step to 
continue.

144
	
12.	
In the Form Details page, enter Form Name, Form Location 
URL (where the page that contains the webform will reside on 
your site), and Landing Page URL (link to the web address to 
be displayed once the form is submitted). Also, choose a CRM 
user who will be assigned as the lead owner once the form 
data gets stored in the CRM (Figure 5-18).
	
13.	
Under Notification, enable Notify Lead Owner and leave 
System Generate Mail selected. Also, enable Acknowledge 
Visitor to send them an acknowledgment email once they 
submit a form. Select Choose a default response for all visitors 
(Figure 5-19).

Click on Select Template to choose an email template for 
the default response that will be sent to visitors. The Select 
Template window opens with no templates to choose from 
(Figure 5-20). Click on Create Template on the bottom.
If you have a template to pick, skip to step 23.
	
15.	
The Zoho CRM email template gallery will open in a new 
window (Figure 5-21). Here you can choose from a collection of 
email ready-made templates and modify them to your liking.

16.	
In the template gallery, click on Notification category on the left 
sidebar and choose a notification template. Click Select as your 
choice to continue. The template opens in a template designer 
ready for you to take an artistic stab on it (Figure 5-22).
	
17.	
Click on the logo image on top of the template to change it 
to your organization logo. Image Selection dialog box opens, 
allowing you to choose a logo image (Figure 5-23). Click Insert 
when you are finished.

18.	
Click on the body of text below the main title (Figure 5-24). 
You can edit the content and add merge fields to the text. 
Merge fields allow you to send more personalized emails by 
extracting personal information of the lead, such as first name 
(formatted as “${Leads. First Name}”) and placing in the email 
body for every email sent out.
	
19.	
Feel free to change the fonts, colors, and other design 
elements of the email template using the toolbar placed on 
top of the designer window.
	
20.	
You should name your email template and set an email 
subject to it too. Click on the corresponding placeholders on 
top bar (left) of the designer and type in the name and the 
subject.
	
21.	
When you are finished designing, click Preview on the top bar 
to see what your masterpiece will look like when received by 
the lead (Figure 5-25). Of course, those weird merge tags will 
be replaced by real values coming from the lead. You can click 
Send Test Mail to receive a copy of the email in your inbox for 
further reviewing. Then close the preview.

22.	
Click the Save button on to the top bar (right), check the 
Template Name, and select Public Email Templates for Save To 
(Figure 5-26). Click Save to continue.
	
23.	
Go back to Select Template screen and click the little Refresh 
button appearing there. The newly created template will show 
up in the list (Figure 5-27). Click on the template to select it.

24.	
On the Form Details screen, you can see the email template is 
selected (Figure 5-28). Review the email address mentioned in 
the From field and click Save to continue.
	
25.	
On the Embed options screen, select the code you prefer  
to use to embed the webform into a webpage on your site  
(Figure 5-29). Consult with a web developer if you have no clue 
what that gibberish code is. Click Done to finish the process.

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
150
Now you can see the new webform listed in the Webforms page (Figure 5-30). 
The Status shows that the form is active. You can deactivate the form and it won’t take 
information. This is quite useful as it gives you power over the forms that are published 
on external websites.
To access the form embed code at any time in the future, you can click on Embed options.
Mass Email
One of the key features of Zoho CRM is that you can send emails from within the CRM 
and also keep a track of them too. For instance, you can perform the entire email 
correspondence with a lead right from the lead details page itself.
Figure 5-29.  Getting the HTML source code of the webform
Figure 5-30.  Newly created webform listed and active

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
151
However, sometimes you need to send an email to a group of people at once. For 
instance, you may want to send a public announcement about your holiday hours to your 
contacts, or send a limited offer to your contacts.
For such scenarios, Zoho CRM offers a mass email feature, which allows you to send 
hundreds of emails to a select group of leads or contact at once.
This useful feature saves you a lot of time and also allows you to set up scheduled 
email dispatches and the possibility that your recipients can opt-out from future 
communications.
■
■Note   There is a limit to how many emails you can send per day to your leads and 
contacts. See https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/email/mass-email.html to check the 
current limits for your edition of Zoho CRM.
It is worth mentioning that although the mass email feature of Zoho CRM is quite 
useful in many scenarios, if you want to get serious about email marketing and send 
thousands of emails to different people and monitor the performance of your email 
campaigns among other things, you need a full-fledged email marketing service, such as 
Zoho Campaigns. We will have a quick look at this service later in this chapter.
Sending Mass Emails
For now, let’s try the mass email feature by sending a promotional email to all of our 
leads:
	
1.	
Open the Leads page. Open the … menu on top of the leads 
list and select Mass Email (Figure 5-31).
	
2.	
In the Mass Email wizard (Figure 5-32), review the 
information about email sending limits and spamming 
considerations.
Figure 5-31.  Sending mass emails to leads

Chapter 5 ■ Take Control of Marketing
152
	
3.	
Click the Select Template button under Email Template 
section. 
	
4.	
In the Select Template screen (Figure 5-33), select an email 
template. Create a new template if you need one.
	
5.	
Once you select an email template, it will be previewed 
(Figure 5-34). Review the template and set the From field to 
the right CRM user.

153
	
6.	
Choose the second tab, Select Record, to specify the recipients 
of the mass email. 
	
7.	
Under Specify Criteria, select Custom View Criteria and pick 
My Leads from the drop-down list. A list of all leads in My Leads 
view will be listed (Figure 5-35).
Figure 5-34.  Rviewing the template and setting the email sender

154
	
8.	
Select all or some of the leads in the list. Then click on the 
Send button and proceed with confirmation to send the mass 
email. Et voilà!
After a few moments (depending on how many emails are being sent), you will 
be receiving a confirmation message informing you about the number of emails sent 
successfully (Figure 5-36).
Sending Schedules Mass Email
As mentioned before, you can also schedule mass emails to be sent on a specific date and 
time in the future. This is quite similar to the previous section, so I leave exploring it to you.

Zoho CRM for Google AdWords
Google AdWords® is the Holy Grail on online advertising outside of social networks, 
especially if you want to advertise on Google search and a Google network of partners.
Zoho CRM integrates well with Google AdWords to offer you a better understanding 
of possible connections between online marketing efforts and offline customer 
interactions with your business, such as calling in, buying, or visiting your outlet.
This integration also helps with fine-tuning your AdWords campaigns by exporting 
information from CRM to AdWords.
It is safe to assume that not all readers utilize Google AdWords. Those who do either 
have an in-house skillset to work with the complexities of AdWords, or they outsource 
talent to do the same.
In either case, we are going to skip delving into this integration and leave it to experts 
who are in charge of your AdWords campaign. Just make sure that you refer to Zoho 
official documentation at https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/google-adwords/ before.
Zoho Suite Marketing Arsenal
Apart from the essential marketing tools and features offered in the CRM, Zoho suite 
offers three more apps that each cover a major part of digital marketing.
In the beginning of this book, Zoho Suite from 10,000 feet, we mentioned the name of 
these apps. In this section, we will have a super quick view at how each one of these apps 
integrates with Zoho CRM and extends its marketing capabilities.
Email Marketing with Zoho Campaigns
Based on personal experience and recent reviews, Zoho Campaign is quickly becoming 
one of the best email marketing tools for SMEs finding its place among the household 
names, such as MailChimp.
It also integrates well with Zoho CRM. An added bonus is that you get to enjoy the 
single sign-on to Campaigns, CRM, and all other Zoho apps.
You can import existing leads and contacts from CRM into Campaigns and add them 
to mailing lists. You can then send emails to these lists and enjoy the advanced reporting 
features of Zoho Campaigns to evaluate how successful your campaign has been.
Zoho Campaign also allows you to set up sign-up forms to be embedded in the 
websites to generate leads. You can export these newly generated leads back to CRM.
By enabling two-way periodic syncing, you can configure Campaigns in a way 
that acts as an extension to CRM. With the CRM at the center of your of your sales force 
automation, Campaigns can add a lot of value to your marketing efforts.

Managing Social Media Channels with Zoho Social
With all the craziness in the social media space and the multitude of outlets for the 
marketers (or marketing departments) to take care of, social media management tools 
have become a de facto part of a marketer’s toolbox.
Zoho Social is becoming a contender in this crowded space. Offering many useful 
features while being competitively priced, and also integrating well with Zoho CRM, Zoho 
Social is well worth the investment.
The integration enables a host of useful features, such as helping you stay engaged 
with your clients and prospect on social media, and creating leads from your social 
conversations and interaction with prospects on social media. You can even automate 
some activities, setting Zoho Social to turn new “likes” or “retweets” on social media 
automatically into leads on CRM.
■

https://www.zoho.com/social/zohocrm-integration.html.
Collecting Customer Feedback with Zoho Survey
If you remember from Chapter 2, the CRM triangle consists of marketing, sales, and 
customer service. All three of these require staying engaged with clients and prospects 
alike. No matter how happy or unhappy a client is, their feedback is always golden for the 
success of the business.
Zoho Survey is a powerful tool that helps you interact with clients and prospects by 
asking them key questions about their preferences, experience, feedback, etc. The output 
of such surveys could be invaluable for your sales force and other team members.
With Survey integrated with CRM, your team can see the results of surveys in real

Summary
In this chapter, you learned about the marketing automation features of Zoho CRM: 
campaigns, webforms, and mass email. There was also an honorable mention of 
scheduled mass emails and integration with Google AdWords.
We also touched on other Zoho suite apps that integrate with CRM and extend its 
marketing capabilities: Zoho Campaigns, Zoho Social, and Zoho Survey.
In the next chapter, we will discuss in detail how Zoho CRM integrates with other 
Zoho apps as well as some useful external services to go beyond just being a CRM for 
your business.

CHAPTER 6
Integrating CRM with  
Zoho Ecosystem
In the previous chapter, we quickly touched on how we can extend capabilities of Zoho 
CRM by integrating it with other Zoho apps. For instance, by integrating CRM with Zoho 
Campaigns you can use the power of a robust email marketing tool to engage with your 
prospects and your customers.
The previous chapter was solely focused on marketing and integrating with apps 
that can boost your marketing efforts. Similarly, you can connect Zoho CRM to other 
apps in Zoho suite and extend its capabilities in different areas, such as finance, project 
management, and document management.
Easy integration and single sign-on (log in once and use all Zoho apps with the 
same account) is arguably one of the differentiating factors of the Zoho suite, thanks to a 
collection of interoperating business apps.
In this chapter, we will have a quick look at other Zoho apps that can improve your 
productivity and make your life easier by connecting to Zoho CRM. I won’t be getting into 
details about any of these apps and assume that you (or people in your team) either have 
a basic idea of how each of these apps works, or you are planning to learn more about 
them. Otherwise integrating them with Zoho CRM will be pointless.
■
■Note   Zoho CRM also integrates with a myriad of third-party apps and services, 
including Google Apps, Microsoft Office, MailChimp, and SurveyMoneky (see the full list 
here: https://www.zoho.com/crm/integration/). The focus of this chapter is integrating 
with Zoho apps. We will quickly touch on third-party integrations in the next chapter.
All the Zoho Integrations
Zoho CRM can easily integrate with these Zoho apps:
• 
Zoho Mail – to bring emails into CRM and stay in touch with 
clients and prospects more effectively;

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
160
• 
Zoho Campaigns – to plan and execute successful email 
campaigns directly from CRM and generate detailed analytics;
• 
Zoho Reports – to generate sophisticated enterprise-level 
business reports and analytics;
• 
Zoho Survey – to run surveys and link results directly to CRM;
• 
Zoho SalesIQ – to bring the valuable data from your website visits 
and visitor interactions into CRM;
• 
Zoho Projects – to manage all your projects from the comfort of 
the CRM;
• 
Zoho Desk – to provide better support to your customers inside 
CRM;
• 
Zoho Writer – to improve productivity features of CRM, such as 
mail merge;
• 
Zoho Finance Suite– to stay on top of your accounting by 
connecting bookkeeping and accounting apps to CRM;
• 
Zoho Creator – to dramatically extend capabilities of CRM by 
creating fully customized and integrated business applications; and
• 
Zoho Motivator – to turn selling into engaging and rewarding 
games for your sales force.
One key point to keep in mind is that these integrations are between CRM and other 
Zoho apps that each offer limited free service and different tiers of paid services, each 
unlocking a different set of features. You may need to pay extra for each integrating app to 
keep certain features available beyond the (often 15-day trial period).
Now let’s have closer at these integrations. We have already looked at Zoho 
Campaigns and Survey in Chapter 5. Here, we will have a closer look at integration 
with Zoho Mail, Projects, Invoice, Books, and Creator. You can explore other apps and 
integration as you wish.
■
■Note   Your Zoho account must have an Administrator level account for you to be able to 
configure integrations.
Integrating with Zoho Mail
In Chapter 3, you have configured email for CRM and enabled Sales Inbox. That was 
actually your first integration of an external service, that is, email with CRM. By doing so, 
CRM and your email account are connected to each other and exchange information to 
give you a better idea about your day-to-day business.

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
161
For instance, the moment you connect your (work) email address to CRM, the email 
history of your contacts will appear in their corresponding contact detail page. You can 
send emails directly from the contact page and they will appear in your sent items as if 
they were sent from your email client (e.g., Zoho Mail, Outlook, Apple Mail).
■
■Note  Regardless of the email service you are using, be it Zoho, Gmail, Outlook, or 
others, Zoho Mail is the email client (or, email app) that manages your email account from 
Zoho or other services. So, if you have an @zoho.com, @gmail.com, or @yourcompany.com  
email address, you configure Zoho Mail to be your email app and that is what actually 
integrates with Zoho CRM.
Sharing Emails with Other CRM Users
There is one more feature that you can use to enable emails in the CRM, which is the 
ability to share all or some of your emails with other CRM users. Depending on your 
business process and internal policies, you have the option of letting other users see your 
email correspondence with your leads and contacts.
For example, sometimes your superior officer may need to see past communications 
without asking you to be bothered with forwarding messages to them. They can simply 
take a peek at your emails directly.
Now, this may sound creepy, or even unnecessary, but there are scenarios where this 
feature comes in handy. Obviously, other email messages in your inbox that have nothing 
to do with leads or contact in the CRM will not be shared with others even if email sharing 
is on for your account. Phew!
By default, email sharing is off, which means all your email correspondence is only 
visible to you. An administrator or the users themselves can change this setting.
There are three types of email sharing available:
• 
Complete: all the emails of the sharing user will be accessible to 
the users specified,
• 
Custom: sharing user will decide which email to share with whom, and
• 
Private: no emails will be shared: default state.
Follow these steps to adjust the email sharing settings:
	
1.	
In Zoho CRM Open the Setup page, then click Email Settings 
under Generic section.
	
2.	
On the Email Settings page, open the Email Sharing tab. 
Under Email Sharing Permissions there is a list of all users 
with their email sharing status in front of them, Private for the 
CEO and User’s Choice for the rest (Figure 6-1).

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
162
	
3.	
Click on the status of the CEO (you) and select Custom from 
the drop-down list. Notice the value Emails Shared With 
column in the list column changes to All (Figure 6-2). This 
essentially means that this user’s emails are now shared with 
everybody, which is not optimal and needs to be limited.
	
4.	
Click on the value All in the list. The Email Sharing Setting 
dialog box for the user opens (Figure 6-3). A series of selected 
check boxes will be listed showing the hierarchy of roles in 
your organization down to the users.
Figure 6-1.  Email Sharing tab in the Email Settings page
Figure 6-2.  Changing email sharing settings for a user.

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
163
	
5.	
Uncheck All, so all check boxes are unchecked. Then select 
which roles or users you want to permissions to. Click Done to 
proceed.
	
6.	
Emails Shard With value is now changed to a more limited 
and certain number of roles and users (Figure 6-4).

Integrating with Zoho Projects
Projects are commonplace in most businesses and managing projects often needs a 
dedicated tool. Simpler projects, such as renovating the office flooring, can be easily 
managed with a to do list app, or an Excel sheet, but as projects grow, the number of 
tasks, interdependencies, priorities, project team, and stakeholders will grow too. In such 
case, starting off with a reliable project management app is a prudent move.
For those of us who use Zoho CRM, the good news is that you can use Zoho Projects 
alongside CRM and integrate them to make things easier for your team and your client.
In an ideal scenario, you start with a lead in the CRM, convert it into a deal, and take 
it through the pipeline until you close a deal.
Figure 6-3.  Selecting email sharing permissions from existing roles and users

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
164
Suppose you are a service provider, say a web design agency that uses Zoho CRM 
for sales force automation. When you win a deal, it means a new project kicks off with 
all the bells and whistles. You can easily create a project from within CRM, assign team 
members, track billable hours, monitor project performance, and stay in touch with the 
client, all from the same place.
By default, CRM adds a link to projects portal in the top menu bar. To set up the 
integration, follow these steps:
	
1.	
In Zoho CRM, open the Projects page and then click on the  
Get Started button (Figure 6-5). Alternatively, you can open  
Setup ➤ Extensions & APIs ➤ Zoho ➤ Zoho Projects (Figure 6-6).
Figure 6-5.  Setting up CRM and Project intregation directly from the Projects page

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
165
	
2.	
If this is your first time using Zoho Projects, you may get a 
warning message: “Client Mapping: No client account found to 
match.” Ignore this and proceed.
	
3.	
In the Zoho Projects Integration page (Figure 6-7), select 
Create New Portal to continue.
	
1.	
In the Portal Configuration step (Figure 6-8), type in a Portal 
Name. This name needs to be a single word with no space and 
special characters in it. Click Create to continue.
	
2.	
Next, under Choose Portal, select the portal you created in the 
previous step from the drop-down list (Figure 6-9).

Figure 6-9.  Selecting the newly created Projects portal to be integrated with CRM

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
166
	
3.	
We will have to give permission to CRM users to access 
Projects. There are five different permissions to grant to 
users: to see Projects tab (page) in the CRM, view projects, 
create projects, edit projects, and delete projects. Grant 
Administrators access permission to all these by ticking the 
corresponding check marks. Then grant only Tab Visibility 
and View to Standard users (Figure 6-10).
	
4.	
Click Next to finish the integration. Then review the settings 
and permissions and edit them if necessary by clicking on the 
Edit Configuration link (Figure 6-11).
	
5.	
To test the integration open the Projects page in the CRM. You 
will be welcomed by a warning page (Figure 6-12) saying that 
you are yet to create a project. Click on the New Project button, 
if you wish to continue with Zoho Projects at this point.

Integrating with Zoho Finance Suite
Arguably, CRM (any flavor) and financial software (accounting, bookkeeping, etc.) are 
two of the most important information systems (or software) any organization can have in 
their arsenal.
So, it is safe to say that in most cases, if not all, having them work together under 
one roof would sound like a very good idea. Fortunately, if you are a Zoho user, you can 
integrate Zoho CRM and Zoho Finance Suite (Books, Invoice, Expense, Subscriptions) and 
have them work together.
Follow these steps to integrate Zoho CRM and Zoho Finance Suite:
	
1.	
In Zoho CRM open Setup ➤ Extensions & APIs ➤ Zoho ➤ Zoho 
Finance Suite. Then click on the Get Started button in the 
integration page (Figure 6-13).
Figure 6-12.  Oops, no projects yet

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
168
	
2.	
In the next page (Figure 6-14), select the Finance Suite apps 
that you want to integrate with CRM and then click Next to 
continue.
	
3.	
The page expands. Enter organizational details of your 
company similar to Figure 6-15. This information will be used 
by the Finance Suite apps selected in the previous step to 
create an organization. Click Next when you are done.
Figure 6-13.

4.	
The page expands again asking you whom (in CRM) you would 
like to have financial transactions with (Figure 6-16). Select 
Accounts & their Contacts, so Finance Suite apps features get 
enabled for both Accounts and Contacts.
	
5.	
Click Save to finish the integration. Details of the integration 
will be shown (Figure 6-17). As long as the integration is 
active Accounts and their Contacts, Vendors, and Products 
information will be synced between CRM and enable Finance 
Suite apps.

7.	
In the sync settings page (Figure 6-19), review syncing 
modules, overwrite rules, and field-mappings between CRM 
and Finance Suite. For now, leave the values untouched and 
go back to the integration summary page.
	
8.	
In the integration page, scroll down to CRM Trigger Points. Here 
you can tell Zoho Books (the accounting app in the Finance 
Suite) what to do depending on the stage a CRM deal is in.
	
9.	
Click on Estimate (Figure 6-20) to review the available options. 
For instance, you can set up Zoho Books to create an estimate 
automatically when a deal is in the “Quote/Proposal” stage.

10.	
Select Invoice (Figure 6-21). This option is simpler and has no 
staged settings. If you click the third option, None, then CRM 
won’t trigger any action in Books. Leave this at Invoice and 
click Save to apply the changes.
You can always come back and fine-tune the sync settings between CRM and the 
Finance Suite.

Integrating with Zoho Creator
Zoho Creator is a powerful and easy-to-use business application creation platform. You 
can create simple or complex applications on the cloud: something as simple as a contact 
manager, a mini CRM, a complete real estate management system, or virtually any app 
that deals with business process and data.
Zoho CRM is quite customizable. Armed with features such as automation workflows, 
custom modules, and webforms, it can meet the requirements of most businesses. But as 
your business grows, your business requirements grow more complex as well.
In such a case, you can create customized apps with Zoho Creator and integrate 
them to be accessed from within the CRM. Creator apps also exchange data with CRM, 
meaning each can use information from the other one.
Also, you might be already using Zoho Creator and now you want to connect one or 
more Creator apps to CRM to extend its capabilities.
In a real-life example, a few years ago I had a client who had a team of telemarketers 
working for his company. These telemarketers, would open CRM, call leads and read 
through a sales script to pursue the person on the phone to buy their products. The sales 
script needed to be “smart” meaning it should have adapted itself to a person’s feedback, 
showing only questions that were in line with the answers to the previous question. There 
should also be a way for the telemarketers to take note while on the phone.
After evaluating the requirements and considering available resources, constraints, 
and user experience factors, I decided to make Creator app and embed it into CRM. It 
worked perfectly and the client was very happy. Implementing a similar solution purely in 
CRM would have proved impossible. Creator, with minimal development work, improved 
the process dramatically.
■
■Shameless promotion  In parallel to this book, I have written another one exclusively 
about Zoho Creator called Zoho Creator: Build Cloud-Based Business Applications from the 
Ground Up (Apress, 2017). I encourage you to read it and learn more about Zoho Creator 
if you are serious about creating high-quality cloud-based apps for SMEs with no or little 
programming background and minimal time and effort.
All said, you should make sure you are not reinventing the wheel and what you are 
trying to accomplish in Zoho Creator is not possible or is much harder to accomplish with 
CRM alone.
To enable Zoho Creator integration with Zoho CRM, follow these steps:
	
1.	
Open Setup ➤ Extensions & APIs ➤ Zoho ➤ Build Custom App 
(Powered by Zoho Creator).
	
2.	
In the Build Custom Apps page (Figure 6-22), click on the 
Enable Custom Apps button.

Chapter 6 ■ Integrating CRM with Zoho Ecosystem 
174
A success message will appear indicating the integration was complete (Figure 6-23).
Here, there are two options to choose from:
• 
to create a new Creator application, or
• 
to import an exiting one from Creator.
Clicking on the Import from Zoho Creator link will open the Import App dialog box, 
listing existing apps in your CRM account (Figure 6-24).

Summary
This chapter was all about extending Zoho CRM capabilities by integrating it with other 
Zoho apps. You learned how to integrate some of these apps: Projects, Finance Suite, 
and Creator, which based on experience, I can say that will improve your productivity 
dramatically when coupled with CRM.
In the next chapter, we will go even further and learn how to take CRM to the next 
level by connecting it to the external world, but before that we will go into detail about 
some of the most advanced features of CRM available in Professional and Enterprise 
editions.

CHAPTER 7
Taking CRM and Your 
Business to the Next Level
So far in this book, we have covered all the essential features and tools available to 
you to run a more effective and more efficient sales and marketing operation in your 
organization using Zoho CRM. You should be able to confidently set up CRM based on 
your business requirements and provide your sales and marketing with a robust tool that 
helps them in their day-to-day work.
But CRM can do much more for you. In the previous chapter, you saw how CRM can 
work with other Zoho tools and extend its capabilities on different fronts.
The next step in unleashing the power of CRM is to let it automate key business 
processes, from sending simple notifications, to running complex workflows.
In this chapter, we will go through some of the more advanced features of Zoho 
CRM that are available in the Professional and Enterprise editions. Based on my personal 
experience with clients and colleagues, these two editions are the most popular because 
of the powerful host of features they offer and their (unbeatable) value for the money.
■
■Reference  You can compare all editions of Zoho CRM and find the one most suitable for 
your requirements at https://www.zoho.com/crm/comparison.html.
Let’s start with the most important topic, security, which must always be on top 
of your priority list, and not only for CRM, but for every single software, app, or online 
service that you are planning on using to store your personal or business information.
Security Management
In Chapter 3, you learned how to create users in CRM. However, when it comes to 
managing users and your organizational data in terms of who can access what, CRM 
offers a number of key features to help you control access to information down to 
individual records.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
178
Zoho CRM offers security management in four different ways:
• 
Users: Each represents an employee of the organization;
• 
Roles: Such as Manager, which resemble the organizational 
hierarchy and allow the controlling of data sharing in CRM;
• 
Profiles: Such as Standard, which allow setting permissions to access 
features and tools at module, submodule, and field levels; and
• 
Groups: Such as Sales, which allow giving access to data to users 
with similar job profiles.
The very first CRM user is the one who created the Zoho CRM account in the first 
place. She or he automatically becomes the Super Admin, having full access to all the 
features and information in the CRM.
You (the Super Admin) must protect this user’s id and password with your life. The 
person in your organization who holds the Super Admin account must be well versed in 
CRM and also have the highest clearance to access data, because nothing is hidden from 
the mighty Super Admin.
That’s why in CRM, Super Admin’s profile is set to CEO. Although they may not be 
the real CEO in the organization, they are the equivalent of a CEO in the CRM world.
When deciding about allocating different access levels to different parts of the 
organizational information in the CRM, look at your current processes. For example, if in 
you company only the senior management and above can see the financial state of the 
sales pipeline, then in the CRM, all pipeline-related views, reports, and dashboards that 
contain financial information, must be hidden from the any user that ranks lower than 
Director (or the role you define for your company).
Managing Users
As an admin (system administrator) you can create and delete users. You can also modify 
their information and reset their password.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
179
As a refresher, let’s have a quick look at the Users page by opening the CRM Setup 
page and clicking Users under Users and Control. The Users page will open (Figure 7-1).
By default, your own user is selected in the users list. You can review and modify your 
role, organization information, signature, salutation, etc. You have access to the same for 
all other users too.
Clicking on Add New User will let you create more users. Notice that you may need 
to purchase more users if you have exhausted your available quota. When you create a 
new user in CRM, CRM allocates a profile (Standard, by default) and a role (Manager, by 
default) to that user. You will learn in the upcoming sections how to add more roles and 
profiles that match your business practice.
You can also deactivate other users to suspend their access to CRM temporarily 
without deleting them and possibly losing important information.
An important rule of thumb is to start giving the minimum possible access to 
information to each role and then give more access if necessary. The default Standard 
profile is not suitable for this purpose. Make sure you create a base profile (e.g., “Staff”) 
defined in the CRM that has the bare-minimum access level and assign all users whom 
you are not yet sure how much access you need to give them to that role. We will cover 
this in a bit.
Figure 7-1.  Users page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
180
■
■Reference  To learn more about CRM’s security management features, refer to the 
official documentation at https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/security/.
Managing Profiles
In Zoho CRM, each user belongs to a profile that defines which feature in the CRM is 
available to the user. This helps in allocating permissions to a group of users based on 
their roles in the organization.
For instance, a user from the sales department may not have access to marketing 
campaigns, and a user from the marketing department may not be able to create quotes 
and invoices.
CRM provides you with two default profiles: Administrator and Standard. 
Administrators (i.e., users with profiles set to Administrator) have full access to all 
features and data. Standard users, on the other hand, have more limited access to the 
CRM. You can modify existing permissions for these profiles, or create new profiles with 
customized permissions.
Let’s have a quick look at the default profiles first:
	
1.	
Open the Profiles page (Setup ➤ Users and Control ➤ Profiles). 
You can see the two default profiles are listed (Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-2.  Profiles page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
181
	
2.	
Click on the Administrator profile in the list. The profile 
details with all the permissions will be displayed (Figure 7-3).
	
3.	
Review the list of permissions. You can see that on/off switches for 
some of the permissions are enabled and some are not. You can 
disable access to certain modules for administrators, but essential 
administrative permissions, such as import and export, and user 
management remain on at all times. Go back to the list of profiles 
by clicking on the back arrow icon on the top left of the screen.
	
4.	
Now, open the Standard profile. Quite similar to the 
Administrator page, you can see the permissions listed – some 
of which are changeable and some are not.
Standard profile can’t manage users (add, edit, remove) or perform data migration and 
a couple of other sensitive operations. Otherwise it is quite similar to Administrator profile.
■
■Note   As a best practice, it is recommended to disable or hide any module, submodule, 
field, or feature that is not used in your organization to avoid clutter and confusion. So, if in your 
organization, you don’t use one or some of the default CRM modules, for example, Sales Orders, 
you can disable them in the profiles for all profiles. This way no one will see the unnecessary 
modules. You can always bring them back by enabling disabled modules in the profiles.
Figure 7-3.  Administrator profile page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
182
Since switching many permissions on or off are disabled for the default profiles, we 
should leave these two alone and instead create our own profiles to have more control 
over permissions.
Creating Profiles
Let’s proceed by creating a Staff profile that limits users more than the Standard profile:
	
1.	
In the Profiles page hover the mouse cursor on the Standard 
profile in the list and then click on the … button that appears 
next to it. Then choose Clone in the context menu (Figure 7-4).
	
2.	
Fill in the Create new profile form as you see in Figure 7-5. 
Then click Create to proceed.
	
3.	
In the profile details page, you can see that more permission 
switches are enabled and you have more control over them 
compared to Standard profile. Continue by turning the 
following permissions off:
a.	
Delete and Share (if available) permissions for all 
modules as you see in Figure 7-6.
Figure 7-5.  Creating a new profile by cloning the Standard profile

4.	
Click the back arrow icon on the top left of the screen to return 
to the profiles list.
The newly created profile, Staff, is a good starting point for all users who don’t need 
advanced permissions. If you see in the future that users in this profile need more, or less 
permissions, you can come back and turn a specific permission on or off for them with 
immediate effect across the CRM.
Unlike default profiles, you can delete custom profiles by clicking on the 
corresponding … button and selecting Delete in the context menu. You will be asked to 
transfer any user that is currently under that profile to another profile. Be careful here  
as you may inadvertently give extra (or less) permissions by transferring users to  
another profile.

Managing Roles
Zoho CRM allows you to simulate your organizational hierarchy using Roles. Roles in 
CRM are about data access. Users at a higher level (e.g., senior management) can access 
all the records of the users at a lower level. For instance, a Sales Manager can access all 
the information entered (and owned) by sales representatives.
By default, there are two roles in the CRM: CEO and Manager. Obviously, users with 
a CEO role (yes, there can be more than one CEO in the CRM world) have access to all 
the information stored in the CRM. Managers, on the other hand, can only view or edit 
their subordinates’ records if they have the Read or Edit permissions. You can define 
data sharing rules in Zoho CRM to allow roles, such as peers, who do not see certain 
information by default, to access specific information. To make these assertions make 
more sense, let’s continue by creating a number of new roles and then look at data sharing.
Creating Roles
To create a new role, follow these steps:
	
1.	
In the CRM, open the Security Control page (Setup ➤ Users 
and Control ➤ Security Control.
	
2.	
Click Roles on the top tab bar. Roles page will open showing 
the default roles in a hierarchical manner (Figure 7-7).
Figure 7-7.  Roles page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
185
	
3.	
Click on the New Role button. In the New Role form, populate 
the form as you see in Figure 7-8 to create a new Director role.
a.	
To select a role for Reports To field, click the Role Name 
Lookup icon next to it and then select CEO in the Roles 
List dialog box.
b.	
Click Save when you are done.
	
4.	
The details of the newly created role will be shown (Figure 7-9). 
You can edit the role if needed, or delete it if you change your 
mind. For now, simply click on Go to Roles List.
Figure 7-8.  Creating new “Director” role
Figure 7-9.  Role detail page showing the details of the Director role

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
186
In the Roles page, hovering on the Director role, you can see a context bar appearing 
allowing you to add subordinates to this role, as well as to edit or delete it (Figure 7-10). 
You can also see that both Manager and Director roles are listed under the CEO; however, 
we want Managers to report to Directors.
So, instead of adding a new role under Director, we can move the existing Manager 
role under Director.
To do so, hover the mouse cursor on the Manager role and click the pencil icon to 
edit the role.
Then in the Edit Role page (Figure 7-11), change Reports To to Director and click 
Save to apply the changes.
Figure 7-11.  Editing the Manager role
Figure 7-10.  Roles hierarchy and role context bar

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
187
Now if you go back to the Roles page (Figure 7-12), you should see the role Manager 
is placed under the Director, and it, under the CEO.
EXERCISE
Add more roles matching the organizational chart of your company and create the 
proper hierarchy for them in the CRM. Indicate which roles can share data among peers.
Managing Data Sharing
You learned earlier that in Zoho CRM, the default setting is only the record (any piece of 
information, such as a lead, contact, etc.) owner and their manager. Users in other roles 
can see information that they or their subordinates have not created.
Data sharing rules in CRM will help you override the default settings and provide 
access to other roles and groups according to your business requirements.
For instance, if in your company, the Digital Marketing Manager needs to have 
read-only access to everyone’s Campaigns information, you can enable this by defining a 
specific data sharing rule. Then users with that role can see all campaign records in  
the system.
Figure 7-12.  Updated organizational hierarchy

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
188
■
■Note   Don’t get overgenerous and give extra access to data to people who don’t need 
it. Always keep data access to the minimum number of people, roles, and groups possible. 
This way, you have better control over information leakage, make less people accountable 
for safekeeping of organizational information, and minimize information clutter on the 
receiving end.
For instance, although the VP of Operation could technically see all sales and marketing 
information, does she really need that many records to clutter her view? If, in your company, 
she needs to see sales information, provide a limited, clear, and concise sales report and 
save her time and yourself less headaches down the road.
In general, you can set data sharing rules for all CRM modules, such as Leads, 
Contacts, etc., except for Forecasts. Attachments, notes, emails, and other records 
connected to a record are also accessible to others.
There are three types of access levels in Zoho CRM:
• 
Private: Access is limited to the record owner and their superior,
• 
Public Read only: Other users can only view records that are 
made public without the ability to modify and delete them, and
• 
Public Read/Write/Delete: Other users have full access over 
records that are made public.

Managing Default Permissions
Suppose we need to make vendor and product information publicly available to all users, 
so no matter who created a vendor, or a product, everyone can access their information.
To change default data sharing permissions for Vendors and Products, follow these 
steps:
	
1.	
Open Data Sharing Setting page via Setup ➤ Users & Control 
➤ Security Control ➤ Data Sharing Settings. All modules will 
be listed with their current access permissions (Figure 7-13).
	
2.	
Find Products in the modules list and click on it. In the 
Edit Default Organization Permission dialog box, select 
Public Read Only in the drop-down list for Default Access 
(Figure 7-14). Click Save to continue.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
190
	
3.	
Repeat step 2 (above) for the Vendors module (Figure 7-15).
	
4.	
Notice in the modules list, both Products and Vendors have 
their Default Access set to Public Read Only. To apply the 
changes throughout CRM, click the Compute All button on 
top of the list (Figure 7-16).
Creating Data Sharing Rules
There are many scenarios where changing default permissions at module level (see 
previous section) are just what you need. However, you may want to give more controlled 
access to some users beyond a mere public read/write/delete permission.
Fortunately, Zoho CRM allows you to define data sharing rules at role and group level.
Figure 7-16.  Default Access changed for Products and Vendors modules
Figure 7-15.  Changing Deafult Access for Vendors module

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
191
For instance, suppose your CEO receives leads in her meetings, which her Executive 
Assistant (who has access to CEO’s CRM account) enters in the CRM. Now, we cannot rely 
on the CEO and her super busy schedule to respond to leads in a timely fashion, so we 
need the Sales Director to see these leads and act upon them accordingly. This way, the 
lead owner remains to be the CEO and managing the lead will be the Sales Director’s job.
Follow these steps to give the Director role access to see the CEO’s leads:
	
1.	
Open Data Sharing Setting page via Setup ➤ Users & Control 
➤ Security Control ➤ Data Sharing Setting.
	
2.	
Scroll down the page until you see Sharing Rules section 
(Figure 7-17).
Figure 7-17.  Sharing Rules section in Data Sharing Settings page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
192
	
3.	
Click on the New Sharing Rule button in front of the 
Leads subsection. The New Sharing Rule form will open 
(Figure 7-18).
	
4.	
In the form, select:
a.	
Role and CEO for Records Shared From,
b.	
Role and Director for Records Shared To,
c.	
Read Only for Access Type (Figure 7-19), and
Figure 7-19.  Sharing Rule form populated with a new rule
Figure 7-18.  New Sharing Rule form
d.	
Click Create Sharing Rule to add the rule.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
193
Figure 7-20.  New sharing rule is listed under Leads
You can see the new rule listed under Sharing Rules ➤ Leads (Figure 7-20). You can 
edit or delete this rule and the changes to access permissions will take effect immediately. 
■
■Note   In the above example we gave access to the CEO’s leads to the Director role. This 
means all users at Director level (e.g., Sales, Marketing, Operations, etc.) can see the CEO’s 
leads. If you want to give the Sales Director only access to these leads, you need to first 
create a new Sales Director role, assign the corresponding user to this role, and then create 
the data sharing rule.
Sharing
There is yet another deeper level of sharing data in Zoho CRM and that is Record-Level 
Sharing. Record-level sharing allows you (or any CRM user) to share only a specific set 
of records with specific users. You can share as many records as you want and from any 
module (except Forecasts) that you want.
For instance, if you want to share the 25 leads you collected in an exhibition you and 
your colleague Daenerys attended together last week, you can easily select those leads 
and share them with her.
FURTHER READING
Share a number of leads and a contact with another user using record-level sharing. 
Give only read access to leads. For the contact, give read/write access to the contact 
and read access to related deals.
Consult the official documentation if you get stuck: https://www.zoho.com/crm/
help/security/record-level-sharing.html.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
194
Managing Groups
Sometimes you need to grant access to specific data in Zoho CRM to a group of users who 
are not in the same role (level), reporting hierarchy, or department. In such case, roles 
alone will not help you. You will need to utilize groups.
For instance, as a part of an internal audit project, you may need to give temporary 
access to all invoices in the CRM to all Directors, Finance Managers, and two employees 
from the Finance department.
CRM Groups let you put users, roles (and subordinates), and other groups (and 
subgroups) into a single group and then create data sharing rules for that group.
Let’s create a group and share all Accounts information with them:
	
1.	
Open Groups page from Setup ➤ Users & Control ➤ Users  
➤ Groups. There are no groups by default (Figure 7-21).
	
2.	
Click on the Create Group button. The New Group form will 
open (Figure 7-22).
Figure 7-22.  Creating a new group
Figure 7-21.  Groups page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
195
Figure 7-23.  Populating the new group form
	
3.	
Fill in the form as you see in Figure 7-23:
a.	
Give new group a name and a description.
b.	
Under Group Sources, select Roles for Select Group  
Source Type.
c.	
You can see the existing CRM roles get listed under 
Available pick list. Select the Director role and click the 
Add button (little right arrow) to add it to the Selected 
pick list on the right side.
d.	
We need to add a user to the group as well. Under Group 
Sources, select Users for Select Group Source Type.
e.	
CRM users get listed under Available pick list. Select a 
user and click the Add button to add it to the Selected pick 
list on the right side.
f.	
Click Save to create the new group.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
196
	
4.	
You will be redirected to the group details page where you 
can see users, roles, roles and subordinates, and other groups 
associated with the newly created group (Figure 7-24).
Automating Business Processes
When the first computers were built in the 1960s, humanity, as a naturally intelligent and 
lazy species, got one step closer to its dream of automating mundane tasks by machines 
to save our most precious asset, time.
Fast forward to today. Our electronic friends (or frenemies in the near future) have 
automated most of our lives giving us enough time to do more important things, such as 
taking millions of pictures of ourselves and our food and sharing the glory with the world 
to enjoy.
Zoho CRM, too, provides powerful features that allow users to automate repeated 
tasks away from delays and human error. Autoresponders, alerts and notifications, data 
sharing rules, territory management, and a few other essential features make it easier to 
rely on CRM to perform a number of basic tasks and help us stay productive.
Figure 7-24.  Group details page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
197
There are also more advanced features, such as workflows, assignment rules, website 
integrations, scoring rules, and the recent Blueprint that focus on automating and 
streamlining business processes of an organization.
■
■Note   We will review some of the business process automation tools and features of 
Zoho CRM in this chapter. You can learn more about other existing and new features in the 
official documentation at https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/automation/.
Workflow Automation
Workflows are series of activities or processes that are performed in a specific sequence 
to accomplish a task. A workflow can be manual, partially, or fully automated. Workflows 
often contain a set of rules and criteria in them.
For instance, here is a simple customer service workflow:
• 
Trigger: when a deal is finalized.
• 
Activities:
• 
send a reminder to the sales person to send the client a thank 
you email and a feedback form, and
• 
send a notification to the sales manager to review the sales 
report.
This workflow can be automated even further to send the thank you note and the 
feedback form automatically without the interference of the salesperson in charge, and 
also email the sales report to the sales manager directly.
A workflow could also trigger another workflow. In the example above, when a 
feedback form is sent to the client, upon submission of the form, another workflow  
can be triggered that notifies both the salesperson and the manager, as well as the 
marketing team.
By looking at the simple workflow, you can guess how much manual work you can 
ask CRM to do for you automatically. This will save your team a ton of time, minimizes 
errors and omissions, and ensures that business processes are followed to the dot.
To help you get the most out of workflows in Zoho CRM, you can use a mix of the 
following tools:
• 
Workflow Rules: which are triggered when specific criteria are 
met, for example when a deal is finalized;
• 
Workflow Alerts: which send email notifications when specific 
workflow rules are triggered, for example, a thank you email;
• 
Workflow Tasks: which assign tasks to users when specific 
workflow rules are triggered, for example, a report submission task;

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
198
• 
Workflow Field Updates: which change the value of specific 
fields when workflow rules are triggered, for example, setting the 
value of the Next Step for a won Deal to “Receive Client Feedback”;
• 
Webhooks: which send web notifications (i.e., HTTP requests) to 
third-party applications when an event is triggered in the CRM, 
for example, sending an external accounting system financial 
information when an invoice is issued in the CRM; and
• 
Custom Functions: which allow you to write scripts (small 
programs intended to do a limited set of tasks) using Zoho’s 
proprietary scripting language, Deluge, to communicate with 
external apps and services and make changes in Zoho CRM, for 
example, receive inventory data every night from a remote server 
and update CRM inventory automatically.
■
■Reference  Deluge (stands for the mouthful Data Enriched Language for the Universal 
Grid Environment) is Zoho’s proprietary scripting language that allows you to write complex 
scripts in Zoho CRM and Zoho Creator and extend their capabilities dramatically. If you are 
familiar with programming and planning to impressive stuff in CRM, indulge yourself with 
the official Deluge documentation: https://www.zoho.com/creator/help/script.
Creating Workflow Rules
To learn more about workflow automation let’s start by creating a workflow rule:
	
1.	
Open Workflow Rules page via Settings ➤ Setup ➤ Automation 
➤ Workflow Rules. There is a demo workflow rule called Big 
Deal Rule already in the list of rules (Figure 7-25). Ignore this 
one for now and study it later.
Figure 7-25.  Workflow Rules page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
199
	
2.	
Click on the Create Rule button. Create Rule dialog box will 
appear (Figure 7-26).
	
3.	
In the Create Rule dialog box, select Deals for Module, then 
type in a Rule Name and a Description as you see in 
Figure 7-27. Click Save to continue.
	
4.	
A new page will open showing a visual representation of the 
workflow rule (Figure 7-28). Continue by setting “when” the 
workflow has to trigger.
Figure 7-26.  Creating a new workflow rule

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
200
	
5.	
Select On a record action under the question When do you 
want to execute this rule? A list of possible actions will appear 
(Figure 7-29).
	
6.	
Select Field update for an action and then select the Stage 
from the first drop-down that lists the fields of the Deals 
module (Figure 7-30). Click Next to continue.

201
	
7.	
In the next step, you need to know which records will be 
affected by the workflow. Leave the selections as you see in 
Figure 7-31.
	
8.	
For the first condition (you can add more if you like), select 
Stage, is, and Closed (Won) (Figure 7-32). This indicates that 
the workflow runs only when a deal stage is won and finalized. 
Click Next to continue.

9.	
Next, you will be setting which actions the workflow will 
perform, starting with creating and assigning a task for the 
deal owner. Click on the Instant Action box and then select 
Task in the context menu (Figure 7-33).
	
10.	
In the Assign Task dialog box, populate the form as you see in 
Figure 7-34. Leave Assign To empty, so the task is assigned to the 
deal owner. Then click Save and Associate when you are done.

203
	
11.	
Back in the workflow designer, add another action and this 
time select Send Mail (Figure 7-35). We will need to inform 
the deal owner’s manager about winning the deal.
	
12.	
In the Send Alert dialog box (Figure 7-36), click New Alert.
	
13.	
In the Send Alert dialog box, give the alert a name and select 
Deal Owner’s Manager in the recipients as shown in Figure 7-37.  
You can select more recipients from other modules and also 
type in additional email addresses if you like.

14.	
Click Select Template button and in the template selector 
dialog box (Figure 7-38), choose one of the existing templates, 
or create a new one for this workflow by clicking Create 
Template on the bottom of the dialog box.
	
15.	
Once you select a template, you will be back to the Send Alert 
dialog box. Review the entries and click Save and Associate.
	
16.	
We are done. The final workflow is show in the visual designer 
(Figure 7-39). Click Save to create the workflow rule.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
205
You will be redirected to the Workflow Rules page (Figure 7-40). The newly created 
workflow is listed here and is active (the green switch on the right side is on). You can 
always come back to this page to modify, deactivate, or permanently delete workflow rules.
Make sure you test your workflows and check whether every single step works as 
intended. For our sample workflow here, you would be moving a (dummy) deal to the 
Closed (Won) stage and then check if a task was created and assigned to the deal owner, 
and an email was sent to the deal owner’s manager announcing a win.
You can add schedule workflows, create multiple workflows that work in parallel, 
and have some of these workflows trigger other workflows. I will leave further exploration 
to your imagination and, of course, your business requirements.
Approvals Automation
In almost any business beyond a one-person operation, obtaining approvals for certain 
tasks is the norm. Approvals and sign-offs help managing the junior personnel better and 
double-check when a potentially sensitive step is about to be taken. It also clarifies and 
enforces accountability and chain of command in an organization.
For instance, giving an extra discount to a buyer, ordering a product more than the 
normal monthly quota, or even sending a quote to an opportunity may need approval (or 
sign-off) from one or more superiors.
In smaller companies, approval may be simply a verbal confirmation, or an email 
sent to managers; however, in the bigger organizations approvals are an important part of 
the business process and must be followed specifically so everyone keeps their jobs.
Zoho CRM provides an approval process to help you automate various approval 
processes in your organization.
Creating Approval Processes
Suppose, in your company, moving a deal to the Quote stage needs approval from the 
Sales Director. Instead of getting the sign-off manually (calling, emailing, etc.), setting up 
an approval process will automate this task and ensure that no deal enters the quote stage 
without written consent of the Sales Director.
Figure 7-40.  Workflow rules page with new workflow listed and active

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
206
Follow these steps to create the suitable approval process for the deals:
	
1.	
Open Settings ➤ Setup ➤ Automation ➤ Approval Processes. 
An empty Approval Process page will open (Figure 7-41). Click 
on the New Approval Process button to continue.
	
2.	
Populate the New Approval Process form as you see in 
Figure 7-42. This indicates that the approval process will 
trigger when a deal gets edited (changing Stage is considered 
an edit). Click Add Rule to this process to continue.
Figure 7-41.  Empty Approval processes page
Figure 7-42.  Adding a new approval process

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
207
	
3.	
In the next form, start by setting the Rule Criteria (Figure 7-43), 
which indicates which records are affected. Select Stage, is, and 
Proposal/Price Quote for the criteria.
	
4.	
Then set who the approver(s) are. In our case, it is the Director 
Role (Figure 7-44). You can add more than one role or user as 
an approver.

208
	
5.	
Check the Assign Task box and fill in the Assign Task dialog box 
(Figure 7-45) to create a task and a reminder for the approver 
to remember to approve the process in a timely fashion.
Figure 7-45.  Creating and assigning a new task for approver(s)
Figure 7-46.  Setting actions to be taken once a process is approved

Move on to section 3, Action(s) upon Approval (Figure 7-46). 
This is where you set what actually happens in the CRM when 
a process gets approved.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
209
	
7.	
Click on the Update Fields gray box to set the action that 
happens for each approver. Since we have only one approver 
here, Update Field will happen once, but for scenarios 
with multiple approvers you should come up with a better 
alternative.
	
8.	
In the Update Fields dialog box (Figure 7-47), select Next Step 
in the field’s drop-down. Then enter “Send Quote – Approved.” 
This will cause the Next Step field value to be updated with 
Send Quote – Approved as an indicator that the request is 
approved.
	
9.	
Click Done to close the Update Fields dialog box.
	
10.	
Next, you will configure actions that will happen only after 
everyone in the approving chain has approved the process. 
Click on Assign Task.
	
11.	
In the Assign Task dialog box (Figure 7-48), you can choose 
from a list of existing tasks, or create a new one. Click on the 
New Task button to proceed.

Blueprint
There is no doubt that day-to-day business consists of a series of complex processes 
and subprocesses. There are main activities, such as sales, procurement, finance, and 
logistics, and then there is the business as a whole that needs to keep all units in check 
and push forward.
To ensure success in day-to-day operations and achieve strategic goals too, robust 
and efficient business processes must be designed and followed to the dot by all involved 
parties. Following policy and procedure is not easy nor is it exciting. Human beings are 
prone to error and sometimes they cut corners. It is even more severe in the case of a new 
workforce simply because they lack experience.
Training and having process maps handy definitely help, but what if there was a tool 
that could guide the employees through every step of a process? Fortunately, Zoho CRM 
just introduced the tool, Blueprint.
Blueprint lets you map the entire business process of your business (well, the ones 
that fit in the CRM capabilities) and have it facilitate process automation and validation, 
improve productivity and stop loopholes and missed steps from happening.
Creating a Blueprint Process
To learn a bit more about this exciting tool, we are going to create a simple process that 
guides users about the stages of contacting a lead.
Each lead has a Lead Source property (field), which by default is empty and could 
take one of these values:
• 
Pre-Qualified,
• 
Not Contacted,
• 
Attempted to Contact,
• 
Contact in the Future,

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
214
• 
Contacted,
• 
Junk Lead, and
• 
Lost Lead.
You may want to change these default states according to your needs; however, we 
will work with these in this scenario.
The idea is to instead of letting the user change Lead Status arbitrarily, enforce a 
process where a certain order is followed.
Follow these steps to define the supporting Blueprint process:
	
1.	
Open Blueprint page via Settings ➤ Setup ➤ Automation ➤ 
Blueprint. Then in the Blueprint page (Figure 7-56), click on 
the Create Blueprint button.
Figure 7-56.  Bluprint page
	
2.	
Populate the fields in the Create new Blueprint dialog box as 
you see in Figure 7-57 and click Next when you are done:
a.	
Blueprint name: “Contacting Leads”
b.	
Module: Leads
c.	
Choose Layout: Standard
d.	
Choose Field: Lead Status
e.	
Criteria: Lead Owner, is, Logged in User

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
215
Figure 7-57.  Creating a new Blueprint
	
3.	
In the Blueprint visual designer (Figure 7-58), you can see the list of 
available states for the process, which is basically the list of statuses 
from Lead Source field. Drag Not Contacted from the list (left) to the 
designer (right) and drop it on the big circle in the middle.
Figure 7-58.  Blueprint visual designer

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
216
	
4.	
Blueprint automatically creates a small process with a Start 
point and connects it to a Not Contacted state (Figure 7-59). 
Each rectangle represents a stage in the process and the 
arrowed line is a connection showing the flow of the process.
Figure 7-60.  Adding more states
Figure 7-59.  Adding the first state in the process
	
5.	
Now drag Pre-Qualified from the list and drop it in the 
designer adjacent to Not Contacted. Then hover the cursor 
on the Start, notice the small connection circles appearing 
around it, drag one, and drop it on the Pre-Qualified to create 
a connection between two states. The result should look like 
Figure 7-60.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
217
Figure 7-61.  Completing the process map
	
6.	
Similarly, drag and drop other states and connect them as 
shown in Figure 7-61. You can actually read the process map 
and follow the logic. For instance, in real life, if a lead gets 
Pre-Qualified, the process end there, but if it is set to Not 
Contacted, you can still turn it into a Contacted or Attempted 
to Contact.
Figure 7-62.  Adding the first transition
	
7.	
Next, we need to tell Blueprint what happens when the state 
changes. Using Transitions you can dictate the action that 
takes place between two states of the process. Click on the red 
plus button between Start and Pre-Qualified.
	
8.	
Notice on the right sidebar a new tab shows up called 
Transitions (Figure 7-62). Type in “Prequalify This Lead” in 
the Transition Name and click Save. This transition will show 
up in a lead’s details page as a button, so the user can simply 
click it to set the state. More on this in the next section.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
218
	
9.	
A green parallelogram representing the transition you just 
created will replace the red plus between the two states in 
the process map (Figure 7-63). Also the Transitions tab in the 
right side bar, will be divided into three subtabs for Before, 
During, and After the transition happens. Continue by clicking 
the Add Criteria link in the bottom of the Before subtab.
Figure 7-64.  Setting transition criteria
Figure 7-63.  Configuring the transition
	
10.	
In the Transition criteria dialog box (Figure 7-64), select Country, 
is, and enter “Canada.” This will tell the Blueprint to show a 
Pre-Qualify  This Lead button in the details page of the leads that 
are local (from Canada), which means users can only pre-qualify 
local leads. Click Done to go back to the visual designer.
	
11.	
In the right sidebar, click on the During subtab to set actions 
to happen when a user clicks attempts to pre-qualify a lead 
matching the criteria above. First, check Make Notes as 
mandatory to ask the user to log the event (pre-qualification). 
Then click on the Add button and select Company from the 
field’s drop-down list as shown in Figure 7-65.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
219
Figure 7-65.  Adding actions to happen during transition
	
12.	
Click on the Validation link appearing next to the Company 
field. Then in the field validation criteria enter a single 
criterion: Company, is not empty. Also, type in an alert 
message as shown in Figure 7-66, so when the user skips 
entering the company name for a pre-qualified lead, they 
get an error with this message asking them to put down the 
company name. Click Done to continue.
Figure 7-66.  Adding validation criteria for the Company field

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
220
	
14.	
In the right sidebar, move to the After subtab (Figure 7-68) 
to set actions that will happen after a lead state becomes 
pre-qualified. In this case we want the user’s supervisor to get 
notified via email that the user just made a lead pre-qualified. 
Click on Email Alerts link to continue.
Figure 7-68.  Adding an action to happen post-transition
Figure 7-67.  Adding second action for the transition
	
13.	
In the right sidebar click Add again and similar to the previous 
step, add the Phone field and set the criteria for it, so it is not 
left empty. You can see the results in Figure 7-67.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
221
Figure 7-69.  Setting an email alert for post-transition
	
15.	
In the Email Alert form (Figure 7-69):
a.	
Enter “Email Supervisor” for Name;
b.	
Under Email Recipients, select People Associated with 
the…, then Lead Creator, then Lead Owner’s Manager 
from the list;
c.	
Select (or create) a suitable template for the occasion and 
select it for Email Template;
d.	
Select Record Owner’s Email for From; and
e.	
Click Done to proceed.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
222
	
17.	
Create another Transition between Not Contacted and 
Attempted to Contact named Call Unsuccessful (Figure 7-71). 
Under During subtab check Make Notes as mandatory to 
ensure the user logs the details of the unsuccessful call.
Figure 7-71.  Adding the third trnasition
Figure 7-70.  Adding the second transition
	
16.	
Create a Transition named Haven’t Contacted Yet between 
Start and Not Contacted (Figure 7-70) states and leave it 
without any further configuration. This means that a Haven’t 
Contacted Yet button will show for all leads as a possible state, 
but it will not do anything specific during or after being clicked 
other than changing the Lead Status value to Not Contacted.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
223
Figure 7-72.  Configuring the Call Successful transition
	
18.	
Create one more Transition between Not Contacted and 
Contacted named Call Successful (Figure 7-72). Then check 
Make Notes as mandatory and add a criterion for Email field 
not to be left empty.
	
19.	
Also, add an After action to send an email alert this time to the lead 
themselves with a special offer template (Figure 7-73). The idea is 
when a user sets the Lead Status to contacted, they must send an 
email with the latest offers to the lead. This transition automates 
that process. Click Done when you are finished.
Figure 7-73.  Setting an email alert for the Call Succeful transition

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
224
	
20.	
Finally, create a Transition between Not Contacted and Junk 
Lead named Wrong Number (Figure 7-74).
Figure 7-74.  Configuring the Wrong Number transition
	
21.	
Under After subtab, create a Task action, so when a user sets 
a lead as junk, a task is created and a reminder is set for them 
to manually delete the leads after 30 days (Figure 7-75). Click 
Done when you are finished.

225
	
22.	
Click Save in the bottom left of the screen to save the 
Blueprint process (Figure 7-76).
Figure 7-76.  Saving the complete Blueprint
Figure 7-77.  Newly create Blueprint activated
Et voilà! You created your first Blueprint process and it is listed in the Blueprints 
page. By default, it is deactivated. Click on the Status switch and activate it (Figure 7-77).

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
226
Figure 7-78.  Blueprint buttons showing in a lead details page
As you can see, creating Blueprints is quite a task, especially for more complex 
processes. However, it is well worth the time investment as it will save your team many hours 
avoiding small mistakes or forgetting procedure, and also your company’s hard-earned cash.
Executing Blueprints
Now that we have a robust Blueprint created for Lead Status of the leads, let’s see how the 
users will utilize it:
	
1.	
Open a lead with Country field set to Canada (or whichever 
country you set in step 10 in the previous section). Notice 
the new gray row with current state and transition buttons 
appearing for the lead (Figure 7-78).

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
227
	
2.	
Click on the View configuration actions link on the top right 
of the gray row. The Contacting Leads dialog box will open 
showing the possible transitions and states for the Lead 
Status (Figure 7-79). This diagram is quite handy and acts as 
your pocket reference process map. Close the dialog box to 
continue.
Figure 7-80.  Blueprint buttons change according to the state (Lead Source)
Figure 7-79.  Current process reference map
	
3.	
Click on Haven’t Contacted Yet. The buttons will change to a 
new set resembling exactly the states you designed beyond 
the Not Contacted state (Figure 7-80). The Current State and 
the Lead Source are both changed to Not Contacted. Also 
notice that you can’t change Lead Source manually like you 
normally could. This field is now controlled by the Blueprint 
process.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
228
Figure 7-81.  Blueprint process enforces data entry upon a successful call
	
4.	
Suppose you made a phone call and the lead picked up the 
phone. Click on the Call Successful button to continue down 
the process. As per our design, Blueprint will show the Call 
Successful dialog box asking us to log the call in the Notes and 
make sure Email field is populated (Figure 7-81). Fill in the 
blanks and click Save to proceed.
Figure 7-82.  Blueprint process under My Jobs section
At this stage our feisty Blueprint process has completed its task enforcing a number 
of rules and guiding user behavior.
Before we move on, there is another place in CRM that you can check all approvals 
and processes that await your action in one place. It is called My Jobs and is accessible 
from the top menu bar (Figure 7-82).
Here, you can review the items in the list and click on an appropriate action button 
to move the work forward in the underlying process workflow. In this example, you can 
see a (Blueprint) process initiated and waiting for your command.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
229
One of these reports, for instance, is the Transition Occurrences, which shows a 
bar chart for the number of transitions happening for each state of a specific Blueprint 
(Figure 7-84).
Figure 7-84.  Transaction Occurrences report for the Blueprint
Figure 7-83.  Blueprints usage reports
Knowing these stats will help you design a better process map knowing where the 
heavy loads are and at which stage (if any) processes are dropped or underperform for 
any reason.
To take this further, these reports could also help you improve your real-life 
processes by finding and addressing bottlenecks and other issues. After all, Blueprint 
processes and other workflows in the CRM must simulate real-life business processes.
Blueprint Usage Reports
Blueprint provides you with a number of reports and stats as to how existing processes are 
being used. You can access usage reports in the Blueprint page under Usage tab (Figure 7-83).

Custom Modules
Zoho CRM offers a decent collection of modules that in most cases addresses all your 
business needs. Leads, Contacts, Accounts, and Deal, are just some of the standard CRM 
modules. However, every business has unique requirements and CRM allows you to 
accommodate these unique requirements.
It is possible to customize the standard modules by adding and removing fields 
specific to your business, and changing value, validation rules, or behavior of these 
modules. For instance, you can make First Name mandatory for Leads, change list and 
order of Stages in Deals, and add a new Mother Company field to Accounts.
However, if the existing modules don’t serve your purpose, it is also possible to 
create new modules from the ground up. Suppose you run a real estate operation and 
need to maintain a full list of all your properties with fields such as size, floor, bedrooms, 
etc. Or you need to have access to actionable market data from within CRM.
Not only will custom modules allow you to create and maintain various lists of 
information in the CRM, they interact well with the data stored in other CRM modules. 
For example, you can add a field to your real estate module called Agent and have it 
populate from CRM users, or attach a real estate record to a deal.

the official documentation at https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/customization/ 
module-builder.html.
Creating Custom Modules
In this section we will create a simple custom module for retail spaces of a business.
Follow these steps to create a custom module:
	
1.	
Open CRM Modules page from Settings ➤ Setup  
➤ Customization ➤ Modules. You can see all available 
modules are listed (Figure 7-85) with most of them 
configurable.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
231
	
2.	
Click on the Create New Module button on top of the list. 
Create New Module page will open (Figure 7-86). On the left, 
there is a sidebar with different types of fields that you can use 
in the module. The rest of the page is allocated to the module 
designer where you can decide what fields the module will have 
and design how the module will look like in the details view.

In the Enter Module Name dialog box (Figure 7-87), enter 
“Retail Outlets” for plural and “Retail Outlet” for singular 
names.
Figure 7-87.  Giving new module a name
	
5.	
Hove the mouse cursor on the Secondary Email field and click 
on the trash can icon to remove this field (Figure 7-88). We won’t  
be needing two email addresses for our shops.
	
6.	
Drag a Single Line field (Figure 7-89) from the right sidebar 
and drop it between Email and Created By fields in the 
designer. Type in Street as the label for the field.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
233
	
7.	
Drag and drop a Pick List field to the form right below the 
Street field. In the Picklist properties dialog box, type in “City” 
in Field Label, add a number of cities under Pick List Options, 
and make the field Required as shown in Figure 7-90. Click 
Done to continue.

235
Figure 7-93.  Allowing Staff members to access the module
	
10.	
In the Module Permission dialog box (Figure 7-93), click the 
text box and then add Staff from the context menu, so both 
Staff members can access this module. Click Save to continue.
Once you are done designing the module, click Save on the bottom of the page to 
create the module.
Accessing Custom Modules
Custom modules are accessible from the top menu bar. Find Retail Outlets item in the 
menu bar (it may be hidden under the …) and click on it. An empty module page will 
open inviting you to add or import retail outlets (Figure 7-94).
Figure 7-94.  Newly created module page

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
236
Figure 7-95.  Creating a new Retail Outlet
Clicking on the Create Retail Outlet will bring the corresponding form (Figure 7-95) 
waiting for you to create a new entry.
The interface and the look and feel are almost identical to other CRM modules, 
making it easy to use. Almost all standard features, such as views, filters, import and 
export, and printing, etc., are available to custom modules. You can attach files and 
associate activities to the custom module records.
Custom modules will help you put key information lists in one place next to 
other important information. No more decentralized and conflicting lists of company 
information floating around in random Excel files.
Extending CRM Beyond Zoho Platform
As you learned in the previous chapter, you can extend the power of Zoho CRM by 
integrating it with other Zoho Apps, such as Creator, Books, and Project. You can also 
connect CRM to external apps, such as Google AdWords and Slack.
But there are times when you still need more external apps and services to work with 
Zoho CRM seamlessly. For instance, if you already use a third-party accounting app, or 
custom enterprise software, you would want to automatically exchange data between 
CRM and them.
Fortunately Zoho offers a REST (Representational State Transfer) API (Application 
Programming Interface) that allows you to send and receive data between CRM and 
third-party apps that support APIs.
You (or your software developer) can use this API with common programming and 
scripting languages, such as Python, Java, PHP, and C# and create apps that interact with 
CRM, or create middleware that connects CRM with other software.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
237
This is not a job for the faint of heart and you need to be an experienced programmer 
or have access to one (or more). As a business owner or decision maker, rest assured that 
it is possible to create interoperability between Zoho CRM and other advanced software.
■
■Reference  Since this is an advanced topic and chances are that you are already bored, 
I am not going to go any deeper than an honorable mention of the CRM API and will refer 
you to the official documentation at https://www.zoho.com/crm/help/api/welcome.html.
Summary
In this chapter, you learned how to control access to CRM data down to record levels 
using users, roles, groups, and data sharing rules.
You also learned a great deal about automating business processes using workflows, 
approvals, and the all-new Blueprint.
Another key learning point was the custom modules that will help you bring all 
organizational information stored in scattered lists under one roof and manage them 
properly.
We also quickly touched on extending Zoho CRM beyond the Zoho suite using REST 
API and custom programming.
■
■Reference  Zoho CRM regularly introduces new features. In fact, a number of features 
were released while I was writing this book, and I’m happy I could touch on some of the 
major ones, such as Sales Inbox and Blueprint. Make sure you visit the What’s New page on 
the Zoho CRM website at https://www.zoho.com/crm/whats-new/ to see what exciting 
features are added to the CRM.
One More Thing
I hope this book helps you win big with Zoho CRM. Whether you are setting up CRM for 
your organization from the ground up, or providing consultation to a client, always keep 
in mind that you cannot and should not rely solely on information solutions, including 
CRM, to improve your business.
The most important factor for the success of any information solution is the people 
who will be using it. If you train your people patiently, and manage the transition from the 
previous system to the new one properly, the probability of success for the new system 
will dramatically increase.

Chapter 7 ■ Taking CRM and Your Business to the Next Level
238
However, if you just go out and pay an arm and a leg to buy the best CRM (or any 
other information system) in the market only to throw it at your team to use it without 
getting the buy-in of the managers and onboarding other staff, don’t blame your 
inevitable failure on the poor software.
I have seen companies that were struggling with their existing software and all they 
did to remedy that was to buy (or create) more software.
If you want to succeed, give People, Process, and Technology the same weight in 
your decision making. Let your team see that you (as a decision maker) are doing this for 
them – not to them. Make sure you involve the right people in the organization from the 
early stages, when you are mapping processes and choosing solutions.
Never underestimate the power of human resistance as the most sophisticated 
software is as useless as an empty gun if people refuse to use it properly. It is no surprise 
that the subject of Change Management is such a hot topic in the corporate environment.
And finally, if you are in charge of a big operation, don’t shy away from involving 
external, experienced consultants who know business process management; change 
management; organizational behavior; and, of course, CRM.
Good luck.
