Introduction
The concept of radar—radio detecting and ranging—emerged in the beginning 
of the twentieth century. The father of radar was Christian Huelsmeyer, who 
applied for a patent for his “telemobiloscope” on April 30, 1904. His device 
worked quite well and detected ships at ranges up to 3 km, but he had no suc­
cess in selling telemobiloscopes, which is why the early radar concept faded 
from memory. The reinvention of radar was done almost simultaneously in 
many countries in the 1920s and 1930s, and great progress in radar technology 
was made during World War II. In the last 60 years, many different radar tech­
nologies have been developed, increasing the radar’s ability to detect targets in 
the presence of ground and sea clutter, to measure the target range velocity, and 
to create high-resolution images. In military areas radars are used for detecting, 
tracking, and imaging enemy airplanes, ships, satellites, and vehicles. They are 
used also for fire control, missile guidance, proximity detections, target identi­
fication, and many other purposes. Radars are also found in many civilian ap­
plications. They are used in air traffic control (ATC), ground traffic monitoring 
(including enforcement of the speed limit by police), collision avoidance and 
traffic assistance (automotive radars), observation of the Earth (biomass calcula­
tion, disaster control, change detection, and ocean currents monitoring) and in 
industry (measurement of liquid or powder level in tanks, object positioning, 
movement detection, and so on).
Early radars were noncoherent pulse radars. To obtain a long-range de­
tecting capability, the radar emitted very short electromagnetic pulses with very 
high peak power (up to several megawatts), and such a large peak caused a lot 
of difficulties. The transmitter was big and heavy. Microwave waveguides had 
to conduct megawatt pulses, and their construction was complicated. The large 
peak power also had an impact on the environment. All life in the surround­

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
ing areas near the radar was exposed to this hazard; birds were often killed by 
electromagnetic radiation, and trees sustained damage.
The maximum detection range of a radar is limited by several factors such 
as the antenna, the size of the target, the noise level in the receiver, and, one of 
the most important, the total energy radiated towards the target. It is possible 
to exchange the transmitted pulse width with the peak power. In a classical 
pulse radar an increase of the pulse length decreases the radar range resolu­
tion, which is generally undesirable. To obtain relatively low peak power and 
a high-range resolution simultaneously, different types of pulse compression 
are used. Among them the most popular has been compression based on linear 
frequency modulation. To improve the radar’s properties, different types of in­
trapulse modulation have been investigated, such as binary-phase modulation, 
polyphase modulation, and noise or pseudo-noise modulations.
In military radars there is a continuous contest between the radars and 
electronic support measurement (ESM) devices. The modern military radar 
should detect the target before being detected by an enemy ESM receiver. The 
ESM detection range depends on the peak power of the signal transmitted by 
the radar, so the concept of low probability of interception (LPI) continuous-
wave radars was introduced. Such a radar, usually equipped with separate trans­
mitting and receiving antennas, could simultaneously transmit and receive sig­
nals so the pulse length can be extended almost infinitively (ranging in practice 
from nanoseconds to seconds, several orders of magnitude). As a result, the 
peak transmitted power could be reduced by even a million times (60 dB). 
Again, as in the case of pulse compression, different types of signal modula­
tions have been investigated. Many continuous-wave radars used sawtooth fre­
quency modulation of the transmitted signal. The signal processing algorithms 
for linear frequency-modulated continuous-wave (LMCW) radars are relatively 
simple (based on the two-dimensional FFT) and require reasonably low com­
putational power, so LMCW radars could be simple and cheap. 
Recent progress in ESM technology has made it possible to detect FMCW 
radars, so radar scientists are looking for new technologies that will improve the 
LPI properties of the radar and prevent ESM receivers from detecting and clas­
sifying the signal transmitted by the radar. As of the time of this writing, there 
were several candidates for modern LPI radars. The first of them was noise radar 
technology. The second was passive coherent location technology, and the third 
was passive technology based on a signal’s time difference of arrival (TDOA) at 
several different locations. 
In most classical active radars the transmit signal is periodic. The period­
icity introduces ambiguities in the radar measurements. The long-range pulse 
radar sends a sounding pulse and waits for an echo to return from the maximal 
distance. As a result, the pulse repetition frequency is low and such a radar suf­
fers from Doppler ambiguity (Doppler frequency measurement is ambiguous). 

 
Introduction

It is also possible to build high pulse repetition frequency (high PRF) radars, 
but an increase of the PRF decreases the unambiguous detection range and, as 
a result, introduces range ambiguities. It was not possible to measure both the 
distance from the target and the target radial velocity instantaneously with­
out the ambiguity caused by the sampling theorem. To fulfill different require­
ments, three main types of pulse radar are used: low pulse repetition frequency 
(LPRF), medium pulse repetition frequency (MPRF), and high pulse repetition 
frequency (HPRF). To resolve Doppler or range ambiguity, different estimation 
methods, usually in conjunction with pulse staggering (changes of PRF dur­
ing target illumination), are used. LPRF radars are free from range ambiguity, 
but have Doppler ambiguity. They are commonly used as ground-based sur­
veillance radars. HPRF radars have range ambiguity but do not have Doppler 
ambiguities. They are commonly used as airborne radars and tracking radars. 
MPRF radars have both range and Doppler ambiguities. This radar operation 
mode is often used as an additional mode in HPRF airborne radars. Neverthe­
less, the idea of the pulse radar can lead to a relatively simple design, which can 
be implemented using analog-only devices.
The rapid progress in digital signal processing (DSP) hardware and algo­
rithms has enabled designers to use more sophisticated ideas and more compli­
cated signal processing algorithms in modern radars. One such idea is to use a 
continuous wave (CW) instead of high power pulses. This idea is not new; the 
first Daventry experiment (see Chapter 2 for details) was based on CW radio 
emissions, but the practical use of CW emissions was limited by the necessity 
to build a sophisticated matched filter set. Modulated CW radars were built 
during World War II and discussed in the earliest postwar literature, but most 
early CW radars were constructed as Doppler-only radars (e.g., police radars) to 
measure the velocity of the target. More advanced systems used periodical linear 
frequency modulation (FMCW) to obtain range resolution. Due to a lack of 
modulation (in single-frequency police radars) or periodicity in modulation (in 
FMCW radars), the ambiguity problem was not removed, but CW radars have 
some very strong advantages. Many CW radars use low transmitted power (1 
mW up to 100W) and due to low peak power (equal to the mean transmitted 
power), it is difficult to detect and classify this type of radar, so they are treated 
as a low probability of intercept (LPI) class of radars. Such radars can detect 
targets before being detected.
The idea of LPI radars in connection with the requirement of designing 
an ambiguity-free radar leads directly to the concept of the noise or pseudo-
noise radar. In this kind of radar the target is illuminated by continuous noise-
like radiation. The reflected power is collected by the radar receiving antenna, 
and detection is based on the matched filtering of the received signals. Due to 
the fact that both the target range and the target velocity are unknown, then 
instead of using a single filter matched to the selected target’s range and velocity, 

4 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
it is necessary to use a two-dimensional set of filters, matched to all possible tar­
gets’ range-velocity pairs. The detection of targets in noise radars thus requires 
very high computational power and cannot be effectively implemented in the 
analog technique. 
The theoretical cross-ambiguity function of the noise signal has a delta 
shape: infinite value at zero time shift, zero Doppler frequency, and zero else­
where. The transmit signal is not periodic, so there are no range or Doppler 
ambiguities in the measurement. 
Of course, nothing is free, so we pay a price for the lack of ambiguity. 
The delta-shaped cross-ambiguity function is for an ideal white noise signal, 
infinite in time and frequency (bandwidth). Such a signal would have infinite 
energy and could not be generated by any real radar. In practice we can gener­
ate a sounding system limited in time and bandwidth (finite energy). In such 
a case the cross-ambiguity signal has a clearly visible peak at the zero Doppler 
frequency and zero time delay, and the width of the peak in time is equal to the 
inverse of the signal bandwidth and in frequency, the inverse of signal duration 
time. Such a signal also has nonzero values out of the peak region. Time and 
range residues of the cross-ambiguity function (which can be treated as the 
sidelobes in the case where single noise realization is treated as a deterministic 
signal, for example, stored in memory) have random nature, but the level is BT 
(the product of the signal bandwidth and duration time) below the peak value. 
This means that the ambiguity problem was converted to the masking problem. 
Sidelobes of strong echoes can mask weak ones if the ratio of the strong to weak 
echoes is higher than the time bandwidth product.
The limitation of weak-signal detection in a noise radar is due to the 
problem of the strong echo signals, which usually originate from nearby ground 
clutter and are received simultaneously with the weak target echo. To ensure 
correct detection of distant targets, the radar has to have a very high dynamic 
range and very low intermodulation. When the matched filter of the noise radar 
is tuned to the range and Doppler velocity of the weak echo, the power of all 
other echoes can be summed with the receiver thermal noise power decreasing 
the effective signal-to-noise ratio of the weak target. This phenomenon, to­
gether with the method of countering it, is described in Chapter 4.
The concept of noise radar may be used for the detection of moving tar­
gets, but it can also have many other applications. There are several papers 
showing the possible implementation of noise technology in an imaging radar 
working in the synthetic aperture mode or inverse synthetic aperture mode 
(ISAR). This concept can be extended to the passive detection, imaging, and 
identification of targets. Noise radar will probably be used in the future in other 
fields, such as air traffic control, pollution control, and security applications.
This book presents the basic idea of noise radar and details of signal pro­
cessing. It is assumed that the reader has a basic knowledge of signal processing

[1–3] and general radar technology [4–9]. However, in Chapter 2 the funda­
mentals of the classical pulse radar are presented. More detailed analyses of 
classical radar processing can be found in the radar engineering bible [4] and 
other radar books [5–9]. In Chapter 3 the basic noise radar concept and cor­
relation processing are introduced. Chapter 4 presents the effect of masking 
weak echoes by a strong cross-talk signal and strong echoes. In this chapter 
the number of algorithms designed to mitigate this problem is discussed. In 
Chapter 5 the idea of the multistatic noise radar network is presented. This 
chapter presents the idea of placing the transmitter and receiver in different 
locations, and discusses the advantages and limitations of such an approach as 
well as the methods for synchronizing the transmitter and receiver. This chapter 
also describes a more advanced idea of the use of a multistatic system, where 
several transmitters illuminate the target using the same carrier frequency. The 
approach presented leads to an increase of surveillance volume, measurement 
accuracy, and probability of detection.
In Chapter 6 the principles of noise synthetic aperture radar are present­
ed. In Chapter 7 the new idea of the passive detection and imaging of moving 
targets is described. The idea presented is based on radiometry and exploits the 
thermal emission of microwave noise signals originating from moving targets. 
Chapter 8 shows selected examples of noise radars and draws conclusions on 
noise radar technology.

Radar Principles
A radar is a device that can remotely detect targets and measure the distance. 
The name radar comes from acronym of the technology called radio detection 
and ranging. Classical surveillance radar scans the area using a single antenna 
beam or a fan of beams in which short (and very often coded) radio-frequency 
pulses are emitted. The signal reflected from the target is received by the radar 
antenna and is then further processed by the receiver and radar signal process­
ing units to extract information about the target and its location. The first 
radio-detection devices were developed by German engineer Christian Hüls­
meyer. He started his work after witnessing a collision of two ships. His device, 
which he named the telemobiloscope, was the predecessor of the modern radar. 
The drawings of the telemobiloscope, as presented in his German patent [1] are 
presented next. The general idea is presented in Figure 2.1. Ship A is equipped 
with a radar on the mast, illuminating ship B, and the reflected signal is received 
by a radar receiver.
Technical details of the invention are presented in Figure 2.2. It consisted 
of a Righi-type spark gap radio-wave transmitter (as a discharging device), op­
erating at a wavelength of 40 to 50 cm (600–750 MHz). The radio-wave pulses 
were directed to the target using a funnel-shaped reflector and a narrowbeam, 
horn-type antenna. The second narrowbeam receiving antenna concentrated 
the energy reflected from the target onto the detector, which was based on a 
coherer. The two antennas were separated by a metal shield and mechanically 
scanned in a horizontal direction. As an indicator, an electric bell was used, and 
it rang when the antennas were pointed towards the target.
The mechanical scanning device was used to find the direction of the 
target. The idea of this mechanism is shown in Figure 2.3.
In June 1904 Hülsmeyer presented the new anticollision devices to the di­
rector of a Dutch shipping company, showing that it was possible to detect ships

at a distance of up to 3 km. The inventor also planned to add ranging capability 
to his devices, using two-dimensional scanning. He obtained several patents 
on the telemobiloscope in Germany, Great Britain, and the United States. The 
U.S. Patent No. 810,150 was dated January 16, 1906. Hülsmeyer founded 
the Telemobiloscop-Gesellschaft Hülsmeyer und Mannheim company, but his 
invention was too far ahead of its time. At that time people believed more in 
Figure 2.1  The idea of the first radar telemobiloscope as presented in Christian Hülsmeyer’s 
patent. Ship A is equipped with a radar on its mast, illuminating ship B, and the reflected signal 
is received by a radar receiver. (From [1].)

optical observation than in technical support, and bad weather conditions were 
not taken into consideration so seriously. However, his device was able to work 
24 hours a day, making observation in day and night conditions, and also was 
able to observe the target on foggy days. His invention could have saved the 
Titanic and many souls. As a result, Telemobiloscop-Gesellschaft Hülsmeyer 
und Mannheim had no commercial success and the radar, or more specifically 
the telemobiloscope, concept was forgotten for more than 20 years.
In fact, the telemobiloscope was the first noise-pulse radar, while the 
sounding pulses, produced by an electrical discharge filtered by a bandpass an­
tenna system, were band-limited noise pulses from the present point of view.
Progress in the construction of radio devices, power amplifiers, receivers, 
and selected filters was the reason why many scientists in the early 1920s started 
to carry out independent research on radar technology. In 1922 Guglielmo 
Marconi presented his idea of detecting remote objects by radio signals, but it 
took him 11 years to build his radar demonstrator. The first radio range-find­
ing experiment took place in Great Britain in 1924, when Sir Edward Victor 
Appleton used radio echoes to measure the height of the ionosphere. The next 
important contribution to radar technology was made by the British Post Of­
fice issuing a report in 1932, which pointed out that airplanes were interfering 
with radio signals and reradiating them. 
In 1935 Sir Robert A. Watson-Watt worked on the concept of a “death-
ray” weapon. During his research he discovered that the death-ray concept, very 
popular in science fiction literature at that time, was not yet possible, because 
the energy required to kill the pilot of the airplane was far beyond the technical 
limitations. So instead of discovering a directed-energy weapon, he found that 
by using a radio transmission, it was possible to detect an echo from a plane at a 
range exceeding 200 km. On February 26, 1935, he carried out an experiment 
at Weedon, 6 km southeast of Daventry (a town located between London and 
Figure 2.3  Scanning mechanism. (From [1].)

Birmingham) and obtained a detection of an RAF Heyford bomber at a height 
of 1,800m and a distance of 8 miles, using a radio beam from the short wave 
BBC transmitter at Daventry, working at the 6-MHz frequency band (49m 
wavelength). It was the first passive radar experiment in which a noncooperative 
transmitter of opportunity was used. The problem of direct signal cancellation 
was solved by using two receiving antennas placed at positions that allowed 
the direct signal from the two antennas to be summed in an opposite phase 
and thus strongly attenuated (see Figure 2.4). The echo signal coming from 
other directions was amplified and displayed using a cathode ray tube (CRT) 
oscilloscope. On the basis of that experiment, the concept of active radar was 
developed in Great Britain. This concept was shortly converted to a chain of 
active pulse radars, which became operational in 1937 under the name of Chain 
Home. Before World War II, 10 countries (Britain, France, Germany, Hungary, 
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Russia, and the United States) had 
operational radars in their inventories.
2.1  Pulse Radar and Its Range Equation
In the Daventry experiment continuous-wave illumination was used. The con­
tinuous-wave illuminator of opportunity was chosen, but at that time it was 
impossible to estimate the distance to the target using such an illuminator. Even 
now, using modern digital signal processing techniques, it would be very dif­
ficult to estimate the range to the target using such illumination, and effective 
range resolution would be of dozens of kilometers. The scientists of the 1930s 
developed an alternative idea. Instead of providing continuous illumination, 
they used short pulses to illuminate the target and they constructed pulse radar. 
This technology is also used in many modern radars.
The idea of pulse radar is very simple. Pulse radar emits a train of short, 
high-power electromagnetic pulses, and after each emission starts to listen to 
the pulse echoes. The distance to the object is obtained by measuring the time 
delay between the emitted pulse and the return echo, whereas the target posi­
tion is estimated by finding the direction from which the returned echoes are 
the strongest. Let us consider the mathematical details of the radar principles.
The pulse radar emits high-power, short electromagnetic pulses at a given 
carrier frequency F, using a directional antenna of gain GT. The antenna direc­
tive gain is obtained by emitting all electromagnetic energy within a narrow 
angle instead of emitting it omnidirectionally. The antenna gain in a simple case 
(with an ideal, lossless antenna) can be calculated as ratio GT = 4π/α, where α 
is the solid angle of illumination. 
The pulses are reflected by a target (see Figure 2.5) and are received by a 
receiving antenna. In most cases the same antenna is used both for transmitting

and receiving, allowing the radar to be equipped only with one antenna, as 
presented in Figure 2.6. The transmit signal is separated from the received one 
using a microwave circulator and/or transmit/receive switch now constructed 
using PIN diodes.

detect radio signals reflected from an aircraft.

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
As the electromagnetic pulses travel in open space at the speed of light 
(c = 299,792,458 m/s), a radar can measure the range to the target by measur­
ing the time delay between the emitted and received pulses, and target angular 
coordinates, determined in selected coordinate system, are estimated by find­
ing the maximum of the echo power received during the scanning process (see 
Figure 2.7).
Now let us consider the power relations assuming that the radar emits 
short pulses of power PT towards the target. If an omnidirectional antenna were 
used, the power density at the range R would be the ratio of emitted power to 
the surface of the sphere of radius R. The use of the antenna of directional gain 
GT = 4π/α will increase the power density at a target GT times and the final 
power density will be described by the following formula [2]

Harbor during World War II. (Photo credit: First Lieutenant Harold Zahl.)

The energy that illuminates the target can be reflected, absorbed, or 
passed through a target. 
In our case we assume that all energy is reflected omnidirectionally by 
the target, which is true only for a small spherical target. In the case of a more 
complex target, we can modify So to incorporate the angle relation of scattering 
properties, absorption, and other effects. Then, keeping in mind the proper­
ties of So, we can calculate the power received by the radar. The unit of radar 
cross-section is 1 square meter. Although the range equation has multiplicative 
terms, electronic engineers prefer to use decibel units instead of linear ones, 
because in such cases equations take the additive form. So instead of using an 
[m2] unit for radar cross-section, decibel units are often used with respect to 
1 square meter, and such a unit is called dBsm (decibels related to one square 
meter). Table 2.1 presents the relation between those units and example targets 
of similar size. It is important to remember that the target radar cross-section 
depends significantly on the radar wavelength, aspect ratio, and material from 
which the target is constructed.
Let us assume again the ideal case, in which the energy collected by the 
target is reradiated omnidirectionally. The reradiated energy illuminates the 
whole sphere of radius R centered on the target, and the radar receiving antenna

To detect the target, it is necessary to measure the received power and to 
make the decision that the received power originates from the target of interest. 
Usually, the received power is very low and an analog amplifier has to be used.
In free-space conditions the received echo signal is the only signal received 
by the antenna, but the analog amplifier produces the noise signal. The goal 
is to distinguish between the amplifier noise and received echo by choosing

between two hypotheses: H0 (there is only noise in the signal) and H1 (there is 
the echo plus noise).
The radar echo detection is equivalent to the classical problem of detect­
ing a known signal buried within white noise [3]. The receiver’s equivalent 
noise power can be expressed as

ing of a received signal), and k is Boltzmann’s constant (1.3806505 × 10−23 
[J K−1]). Using the Neyman-Pearson criterion, it is assumed that hypothesis H1 
is true (there is an echo in the signal), when the echo power is higher than the 
noise power multiplied by the detectability factor Do, usually having the value 
of 12–16 dB, depending on the assumed probability of a false alarm. The radar 
detection criterion can then be written as

In high-frequency, long-range radars, the insertion losses depend on the radar-
target range, and the maximum detection range must be calculated numerically. 
It depends strongly on weather conditions, especially air humidity. However, in 

16 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
this book this effect is not taken into consideration, and for the sake of simplic­
ity, (2.8) is used. 
As stated in (2.8), the detection range depends only on transmitting pulse 
energy, transmitter and receiver antenna gains GT, GR, target cross-section So, 
and wavelength λ, and does not depend on the pulse length or the receiver 
bandwidth (assuming that a matched filter is used). Formula (2.8) describes 
a single-direction/single-pulse case. It is easy to see that this equation is also a 
good approximation of the detection range for more complex detection sche­
mas, using the multipulse technique with coherent integration or continuous 
waveforms. In that case ET stands for total energy emitted towards a target, 
assuming that fully matched filtering is possible (the signal can be integrated 
coherently). It is not always true, however, because many radars use noncoher­
ent (amplitude-based) signal integration. As well, in such cases, (2.8) can be 
very useful because all losses such as integration losses, filter mismatched losses, 
antenna losses, and others can be calculated and incorporated in loss factor L.
The two main types of radars are surveillance radar and tracking radar. 
Surveillance radar searches the surveillance space volume and detects all targets. 
The radar detections (plots) are used for updating existing the track position 
(track-while-scan function) and to initiate a new track. Tracking radar has an­
other goal: to provide the position information of a single selected target so 
that all available energy is allocated to detect and track that target. The target 
illumination time can be much longer than in surveillance radar and is limited 
by the required position data refresh rate.
Modern radars are multifunctional, often equipped with electronic scan­
ning antennas (see Figure 2.8) and such a radar can allocate part of its resources 
(time and energy) for surveillance scanning and the rest for tracking multiple 
selected targets. For all of these processes, (2.8) can also be used to predict the 
detection and tracking distance.
As mentioned before, a wide variety of radars work in the surveillance 
mode. Let us consider a surveillance radar equipped with a transmitter having 
the mean transmitted power PTm, searching the surveillance solid angle αs in 
time ts. In many cases the surveillance solid angle is a whole semisphere (2p).
The idealized transmitting antenna with gain GT emits electromagnetic 
waves in the solid angle αT = 4π/GT. In order to scan the whole surveillance 
volume (surveillance angle), it is necessary to scan ns = αs/αT = αsGT/4π direc­
tions, so the time of illuminating a single direction (called time on target) is 
limited to the value

(2.10)
As follows from the analysis of formulas (2.9) and (2.10), the detection 
range depends on the receiving antenna gain, mean transmitter power, scanning 
angle, and time. The gain of the transmitting antenna does not contribute to 
the detection range, but it influences the time on target. Time on target for sur­
veillance radar is described by (2.9), but other factors can also influence it. The 
other limiting factors are time of the electromagnetic wave propagation (time in 
which electromagnetic pulses propagate from the radar to the target and back) 
and the time the object stays in a radar range-angle resolution cell.
In many radar systems the same antenna is used for transmitting and 
receiving. It means that GT = GR and all transmitted energy is collected by the 
receiving antenna having the same beamwidth. To extend the effective radar 
range, it is possible to use a separate receiving antenna with higher gain than 
the transmitting antenna, but the use of a single receive antenna will provide

tion Radar Characterization System.

mismatched antenna pattern losses when the receive antenna beamwidth is 
smaller than the transmit one and part of the transmit energy is lost. To avoid 
such losses, a set of more directional, high-gain antennas can be used. This leads 
directly to the concept of a multibeam or stacked-beam antenna presented in 
Figure 2.9, which is very popular in 3-D surveillance radar. This idea can be 
further extended, and it is possible to develop a system with an omnidirectional 
transmit antenna and a multibeam receive antenna set.
2.2  Radar Range Measurement and Range Resolution
The range R from a radar to the target is determined by measuring the time in 
which the electromagnetic pulse is propagated from the radar to the target and 
back. The time delay between the transmitted and received signal τ is equal to
	
τ = 2R
c
	
(2.11)
where c is the velocity of light, equal to 299,792,458 [m/s] in a vacuum. In 
practical cases the radar pulses travel in the Earth’s atmosphere, and the velocity 
of light depends slightly on the air temperature, pressure, and humidity, but 
such aspects are not considered in this book and standard light velocity will 
be used. Thus, the range to the target R can be easily calculated when the time 
delay is known, using the following formula:
	
τ
= 2

In other words, the problem of range estimation can be converted to the 
problem of estimation of time delay . Of course, the time delay can be estimat­
ed by means of different methods. The most popular is finding the coordinates 
of the maximum value of the cross-correlation function between the transmit­
ted signal xT and received signal xR, defined as

where * denotes a complex conjugation. Usually the formula (2.13) is applied 
to the downconverted signals shifted to the baseband.
In a classical pulse radar, electromagnetic energy is emitted as a short pulse 
of a sine wave signal of frequency F and duration time tp (see Figure 2.10). 
To maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio, matched filters are often used 
in radar technology. The matched filter generates at the output a signal pro­
portional to a cross-correlation function determined between the transmitted 
and received signals. In this case the output signal has a triangular envelope of 
total time duration 2tp, filled with a carrier frequency cosine signal (see Figure 
2.10). The basic question related to the range measurement is, what are the 
radar range resolution and accuracy of range measurements? Resolution is the 
ability to resolve two closely located targets and the question is, how far from 
Figure 2.10  The received pulse after matched filtering.

20 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
each other should two point targets be (usually defined as targets of equal radar 
cross-section) in order to be resolved by radar (detected as two targets, not one)? 
The second question is, how possible is it to precisely measure the distance to a 
single point target using a selected waveform?
While the filter matched to the pulse tp has a bandwidth of approximately 
B = 1/tp, it is easy to calculate the range resolution for different pulse durations. 
Example calculations are presented in Table 2.2.
The echoes received from the two separate objects are fully separated if 
their time delay difference is equal to or higher than 2tp, which means that their 
radial distance is higher than tpc. In cases when the time delay is smaller, the two 
echo components will overlap at the output of the matched filter. The shape of 
the output signal will depend on the difference of the phase of the echo signals.
In Figure 2.11 the shapes of the signal at the output of the matched filter 
are presented for a phase difference of ϕ = 0°, 90°, 180° and the time delay 
between the signals tp, 1.5tp, and 2tp, respectively. It is usually assumed that two 
objects can be distinguished if their range separation is greater than tpc/2, but 
full separation is obtained for ranges greater than tpc. 
The spectrum of a rectangular pulse signal is described by a sinc function, 
presented in Figure 2.12. The main lobe spectrum width (at the −3-dB level) 
is almost equal to B = 1/tT. Naturally, the total signal spectrum is spread over 
a much wider bandwidth, and the first sidelobes are attenuated only by 13 
dB. To avoid interferences between radars working at different frequencies, the 
transmitted spectrum is sometimes limited by using frequency filtering or time 
windowing. An example of limiting the transmitted signal spectrum by apply­
ing a Hamming window to the transmitting signal is given in Figure 2.12. This 
approach is seldom used in practice, as it requires that the transmitter operate 
in the linear mode, greatly reducing the peak transmitter power relative to satu­
rated operation. Thus, to limit the frequency sidelobes, microwave filters are 
often used. Such filters reduce frequency sidelobes but also introduce additional 
losses (0.5–3 dB), and widen the main lobe (10%–40%), therefore decreasing 
the radar range resolution and accuracy. In that case the correlation function

envelope no longer has a triangular shape and its peak can be approximated by 
a higher-order polynomial.
As stated in (2.8), the detection range depends on the transmitted energy 
and is independent of range resolution. Thus, the peak power required to de­
tect a certain object (in the classical pulse radar) is inversely proportional to the 
range resolution of the pulse radar. Figure 2.13 presents the required transmit­
ted power versus required range resolution, calculated for ideal (L = 0) radar

operating in the X-band (9.5 GHz), equipped with a 30-dB gain transmit­
ting/receiving antenna and a transmitter enabling the radar to detect a 0-dBsm 
target at a range of 50 km. It is assumed that the receiver temperature TR is 
300 [K] and detection factor Do is 13 dB. Note that the presented situation is 
rather artificial while in almost all pulse radars several pulses are used for target 
detection (usually 5–40). As a result, the required transmitted power is 5–16 
dB smaller than that presented in Figure 2.13, but it is a good illustration of he 
trade-off between peak power and range resolution in a pulse radar.
The peak power of a transmitted signal in a low-resolution, medium-
range radar (resolution 200m, detection range 50 km for 0 dBsm target) must 
reach the value of 850 kW. If a much higher resolution of 0.2m is required, the 
transmitted signal power should reach 850 MW. In practice, however, it is very 
difficult to obtain a peak power greater than 1 MW. The constraints usually 
come from maximum power densities in radar microwave circuits (ionization 
in waveguides) and the classical pulse radar resolution for the radar parameters 
assumed here is limited to several hundred meters. To obtain a better resolution, 
the pulse compression technique has to be used [2]. In pulse compression radars 
the transmitted signal duration time is much longer than the time correspond­
ing to the range resolution of the radar. The transmitted signal bandwidth must

be at least B = 2∆R/c and the transmitted signal has a more complicated wave­
form than the simple rectangular pulse filled with a sine signal. In such a case 
(2.8) held and to obtain a certain detection range the appropriate amount of 
energy has to be sent towards the target. Thus, the constructors gain an addi­
tional dimension of freedom; they can exchange power with time to obtain a 
constant energy pulse. 
In Figure 2.14 the required peak power is plotted versus the pulse time 
duration (before compression). The radar parameters (band, antenna gain, 
range) are the same as in the last example. 
The use of a 10-ms pulse decreases the required peak power to the level 
of 100 kW and a 100-ms pulse decreases the peak power to the level of only 10 
kW. In the case of a very long (1s) pulse, the required power is equal to 1W. 
As a rule, a very long pulse allows designers to apply a low peak power solid 
state transmitter, which is more modern and more reliable than a transmitter 
equipped with a high-power vacuum tube.
It is worth mentioning that in using pulse compression the radar range 
resolution is independent of pulse duration and is related to pulse bandwidth. 
It is also worth mentioning that there are no free lunches in the universe, so 
we have to pay somehow for such freedom. In the pulse radar using a single

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
antenna with a transmit/receive switch, we pay when creating a blind zone 
around the radar: 150m for each microsecond of pulse duration, so typically we 
can have a 1.5- to 15-km blind zone (for pulses 10–100 ms). If such a blind zone 
is not acceptable, we can send alternately long pulses to have long-range detec­
tion and short pulses to provide detection in the blind zone, but we need extra 
time to perform this. If longer pulses are used (1 ms–1s, providing a theoretical 
blind zone of 150–150,000 km), it is necessary to complicate the radar design 
and have separate transmit and receive antennas with good electromagnetic 
separation between them.
Another cost of using pulse compression is the existence of time sidelobes 
(see Figure 2.15), originating from the fact that many targets at different dis­
tances can be illuminated simultaneously by the same pulse. The sidelobes of a 
strong echo can mask weak echoes and weak echoes can be undetected by the 
radar.
There are a number of waveforms used for pulse compression [2, 4]. The 
most adequate of them should ensure a narrow peak of the autocorrelation 
function and low time sidelobes [5–7]. The most frequently used waveform is a 
chirp modulated signal [8], described by the formula

for time interval -tp/2 < t < tp/2, where A(t) denotes the amplitude envelope 
of the transmitted signal, F denotes the carrier frequency, and B denotes signal 
bandwidth. In Figure 2.15 the example chirp signal is presented together with 
its amplitude spectrum and the signal (including sidelobes) at the output of the 
compression filter. The linear frequency-modulated signal (LFM) has an almost 
rectangular spectrum. The signal after the matched filtering has a narrow main

peak and sidelobes extending over a relatively long time (equal to the transmit­
ted signal duration on each side of the main peak). Because of the rectangular 
spectrum the time response of the matched filter,for large Btp approaches the 
sinc function. The first sidelobe is at the level of -13 dB below the main peak, 
the second −19 dB, and the next decrease with reversely proportional to the 
distance from the main peak as presented in Figure 2.16.
The envelope of an example signal (signal magnitude) at the output of 
the pulse compression filter for an LFM signal with a time-bandwidth prod­
uct equal to 20, is presented in Figures 2.16, 2.17, and 2.18. In Figure 2.16 a 
rectangular amplitude envelope has been used for transmission and the fully 
matched filter at the receive. The 3-dB length of the main lobe is almost equal 
to tc = 1/B, but the time sidelobes level is very high (the first sidelobes are 13 dB 
smaller than the main lobe). In Figure 2.17 the Hamming amplitude envelope 
(Hamming time window) has been used for tapering the transmission pulse 
and a fully matched filter was used at the receive side. In this case, the length 
of the compressed signal main lobe at the 3-dB level is wider than in the previ­
ous case and reaches the value of tc = 1.8/B, and the range resolution is almost 
two times worse than in the previous case. The sidelobes level is now reduced, 
and the first sidelobes are below −44 dB (compared to the main lobe). A time-
bandwidth product close to 20 was used in the first pulse-compression radars, 
and this value was used in the examples presented above. In modern radars the 
time-bandwidth product may reach several thousands, but the initial problems 
remain relevant.

filter. Linear frequency modulation, square (boxcar) amplitude of the transmitted signal with 
time-bandwidth product = 20.

26 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
In many radars it is not possible to modulate the amplitude of the transmit­
ted signal. In such cases the unmatched filter concept is often used. The trans­
mitted signal has a rectangular envelope, but a compression filter is matched to 
the signal with a Hamming (or other shape) envelope. The signal at the output 
of the unmatched compression filter with a Hamming window is shown in 
Figure 2.18. In that case the level of sidelobes is smaller than −29 dB (compared 
to the main lobe), and the main lobe width is tc = 1.4/B, a little smaller than in 
the case of a Hamming weighed signal, but wider than for a rectangular (box­
car) weighted signal. The range resolution is 1.4 times worse than in the case 
when no windowing is applied. Generally, the sidelobe level and structure for a 
windowed signal depend not only on the shape of the applied window but also 
on the time-bandwidth product of the transmitted signal.
Linear frequency modulation is used extensively in both radar technology 
and in nature. These sounding signals are used by bats, dolphins, and other 
animals. The modification of linear frequency modulation results in nonlinear 
frequency modulation, where, instead of applying time windows, modulation 
nonlinearity is used [4]. The number of possible linear modulations for a given 
pulse time duration and bandwidth is limited to two: up-chirp and down-chirp. 
They are almost orthogonal. When nonlinear frequency modulation is used, 
there are a few more possibilities, but still only two are almost orthogonal, 
while others are strongly correlated. In some applications a greater variety of 
sounding pulses are required. In such cases phase modulation is often used. The

filter. Linear frequency modulation, transmitted signal with Hamming window signal with time-

simplest are binary phase (biphase) modulation [9, 10] or polyphase waveforms 
[11–13]. Among others, the binary-phase Barker code is also often used [14, 
15]. The amplitude of the main peak of the correlation function of the Barker 
code is equal tothe length of the code, while that of the sidelobes is limited 
to unity. There are Barker codes that exist up to and including length of 13. 
The absolute value of the correlation function of a widely used 13-stage code 
(1111100110101) is presented in Figure 2.19. As can be seen, the time sid­
elobes are uniformly distributed at the level of −22 dB. 
The duration of the transmitted pulse is constrained by several technical 
factors, depending on the radar function performed and the selected processing 
schema. In classical surveillance scanning radar without pulse compression it is 
limited by the single direction scanning time described by (2.9). In all radars 
using classical signal processing (i.e., without compensation for target veloc­
ity), the duration of the pulse is also limited by the time the target stays in the 
range-azimuth resolution cell. The time that targets remain in a single-range 
resolution cell is approximated by the formula

m/s), the maximum pulse duration time has to be smaller than 50 ms, unless 
the signal processor includes a correction for known target velocity. The third 
factor is the time when the target remains inside the antenna beam (for target 
movement perpendicular to the line of sight). This time limit can be expressed 
as follows:

beamwidth, a range of 10 km, and a target velocity of 1,000m/s, the pulse 
duration time has to be shorter than 200 ms. For most radars this constraint is 
less restrictive than the previous ones. Using more advanced signal processing 
(like signal stretching to incorporate range migration or multibeam coherent 
processing to prevent angular migration), it is possible to extend the pulse dura­
tion or coherent integration time.
2.3  Radar Range Velocity Measurement and Range Velocity 
Resolution
Classical radar can measure not only the distance to the target but also the 
target radial velocity by exploiting the Doppler effect. The returning (received)

from a stationary (nonmoving) target. In most cases, however, the radar is used 
for the detection of moving targets. Consequently, the return signal, reflected

where ϕR = ϕ – 4πR0F/c is the received signal initial phase, and fd = 4vF/c = 
2v/λ is a Doppler frequency shift. For radar using a short single pulse, when 
the Doppler shift is much smaller than the reciprocal of the transmission pulse 
interval (4vF/v << 1/tT), the Doppler effect is negligible. In pulse radar it is 
possible to estimate the target Doppler shift if the train of pulses is used. Ac­
cording to (2.21), the phase of each returned pulse is different, and Doppler

information is hidden in their phase difference. Table 2.3 presents typical Dop­
pler frequencies for different targets and different radar bands. 
The emission of a consecutive pulse train can be treated as a time-sam­
pling procedure. According to the Shannon sampling theorem, the pulse repeti­
tion frequency (PRF) should be twice the maximum Doppler frequency:

For example, for a 10-cm wavelength (3 GHz) and a 1,000-m/s maxi­
mum target velocity, the required PRF should not be smaller than 40 kHz and 
the target velocity can be estimated finding the coordinates of the maximum 
FFT of the consecutive echoes sampled for the chosen time delay (range to the 
target).

In the above example, the unambiguous range is limited to 3,750m. The 
typical detection range for medium-range radar is 100 km, so in most pulse 
radars it is not possible to simultaneously achieve range and the velocity un­
ambiguity. In a ground-based surveillance radar range unambiguity is usually 
treated as a major requirement. The pulse repetition frequency must be se­
lected at a value far below the constraint formulated in (2.22), and in effect 
the velocity measurement is ambiguous. Using the nonuniform sampling con­
cept, a number of methods for unambiguous velocity measurement have been 
developed [16], but low-frequency components (echoes originating from the

ground, vegetation, weather, and sea clutter) can mask weak, high-frequency 
echoes. For airborne radars [16–18], medium [19] or high PRF concepts [20, 
21] are usually applied. 
The high PRF mode is a radar sounding mode in which the PRF is select­
ed in such a way that velocity measurement is unambiguous. This means that 
constraint (2.22) is fulfilled. For the L-band radar the PRF should be around 20 
kHz, for the X-band 100 kHz, and for the K-band 200 kHz. Of course, in that 
mode velocity measurement is unambiguous, while range measurement is am­
biguous, and a special procedure, usually based on the Chinese remainder theo­
rem, has to be used to resolve range ambiguity [23]. The radial velocity resolu­
tion is limited by the time on target. Using the filtering concept or equivalent 
FFT processing, it is possible to separate two targets in velocity when the Dop­
pler frequency difference is greater than the reciprocal of a coherent integration 
time (time duration of a signal block taken for Doppler frequency analysis, 
smaller or equal to time on target). The velocity resolution is as follows:

(2.24)
For example, for a 10-cm wavelength and an integration time of 10 ms, 
the velocity resolution is 20 m/s, while for 1s the resolution is much better 
and equal to 0.2 m/s. The coherent integration time is limited by the factors 
mentioned earlier, among which is the time when a target remains in the range 
resolution cell (2.15). Additionally, when Doppler processing is applied, the 
integration time is limited by target maneuver. Proper target detection and ve­
locity estimation can be achieved only in the situation where the target veloc­
ity during observation remains in a velocity resolution cell. This leads to the 
constraint

where amax denotes the maximum target range acceleration. For example, for a 
10-cm wavelength with 1-g (9.81 m/s) maximum target acceleration, the co­
herent integration time is limited to 0.14s, while for 10g the limitation is at 
0.045s. It is worth noting that target range acceleration can be present even for 
nonmaneuvering targets, while range and range velocity are measured naturally 
in radar polar coordinate systems. Signal processors can be designed to over­
come this limitation by applying compensation for known or assumed target 
acceleration, requiring multiple channels if the acceleration is unknown.

2.4  Radar Ambiguity Function
Up to now, the range and Doppler measurements have been treated as indepen­
dent measurements. It is true for pulse radar, when short pulses are used, but it 
is not fully true for pulse compression radars. To measure and verify coupling 
between range and Doppler measurements, the radar ambiguity function is 
used [23–28]. 
The radar ambiguity function is a 2-D function of the Doppler frequency 
and the range (or time delay). Since Doppler frequency and range (time delay) 
are canonical conjugate variables, there exists an uncertain relationship between 
them. It is not possible to measure both these quantities with infinite accuracy. 
The shape of the region of uncertainty depends on the transmitted waveform. 
The cross-ambiguity function between the two signals x1 and x2 is defined by 
the following formula:

time-Doppler properties of a single signal, and has the form

Examples of ambiguity functions of signals commonly used in radar tech­
nology are presented in Figures 2.20 through 2.24. In all these cases it is as­
sumed that a radar working in the X-band is used (10-GHz carrier frequency).
In Figure 2.20 the absolute value of the ambiguity function of the short 
(100-ns), single-frequency pulse is presented. As follows from the figure, the 
time (range) resolution is good (100 ns is equivalent to 15-mach resolution), 
but there is almost no Doppler resolution using single pulse (within the range 
±70 kHz, which is equivalent to a target radial velocity ±3 Mach.)
In Figure 2.21 the absolute value of the ambiguity function of the con­
tinuous-wave, single-frequency radar is presented. The frequency resolution, 
for the 0.1s analysis time, is equal to 10 Hz, and the velocity resolution is equal 
to 0.15 m/s, respectively. There is no range resolution. Such radars commonly 
used for velocity measurements include single police gun radars, radars for mea­
suring tennis and golf ball velocity, and so forth. 

 
Radar Principles

The absolute value of the ambiguity function of a 10-ms chirp signal (10-
MHz bandwidth) is presented in Figure 2.22. For this type of waveform, the 
range resolution is very good (15m in the example presented). The Doppler 
frequency changes the time position of the signal at the output of the matched 
filter. However, in the useful Doppler frequency range correspondence ±2M 
to ach, the time shift is limited to two range resolution cells. A relatively high 
Doppler frequency shift decreased the amplitude of the compressed signal, but 
again a Doppler shift corresponding to the maximum target velocity caused 
only very small amplitude changes (below 1 dB). However, if much longer 
pulses are used, then the Doppler frequency ranges will be smaller and range 
shift due to the presence of target movement will be greater. In this case range 
correction should be applied after the estimation of Doppler frequency. 
In Figure 2.23 the absolute value of the ambiguity function of the 13-bit 
Barker code (100-ns bit rate) is presented. In this case the range resolution is 
also good (as in the previous case). There is no range displacement related to 
the Doppler shift, but the useful Doppler velocity range is much smaller. The 
faster target will not only be attenuated but also split in range, so such a sound­
ing signal is useful only for relatively slow targets unless velocity compensation 
is applied in the processor.

tion magnitude is coded in grayscale.

34 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
The absolute value of the ambiguity function calculated for a long noise 
pulse (1-ms duration time, 10-MHz bandwidth, X-band) is presented in Figure 
2.24. Due to the long pulse time, the main peak of the ambiguity function is 
narrow not only in range dimension, but also in the Doppler frequency dimen­
sion. The useful Doppler frequency range is much wider than the ambiguity 
function main lobe. This means that both the range and Doppler frequency can 
be determined using this kind of modulation, and it is possible to distinguish 
the two targets at the same distance to the radar, but having different radial 
velocities. The disadvantage of this kind of modulation is that in using a long 
noise pulse it is necessary to apply a bank of matched filters adopted to different 
Doppler frequencies instead of a single matched filter. Detailed analyses of the 
applications of noise waveforms in different radars are the subject of the next 
chapters.
2.5  Radar Operation over the Ground or the Sea
In the previous sections all considerations have been made assuming a single 
target and free-space conditions. In practice a radar is situated either on the

wave. The function magnitude is coded in grayscale.

ground or on a moving platform such as a vessel, airplane, or spacecraft. If the 
radar uses a pencil beam and directs the beam towards the sky, then the free-
space condition is a good approximation. If the transmit or receive beam looks 
towards the ground or sea surface, then such an approximation is very coarse 
and to understand all phenomena related to the radar, it is necessary to also take 
into consideration the reflection from the ground or sea surface.
2.6  Multipath Effect 
A target located over the ground or sea surface is illuminated in two ways: by a 
direct wave and by an indirect wave reflected by the ground surface. A typical 
scenario over flat ground is presented in Figure 2.25. To calculate the effect of 
the multiple paths, it is necessary to calculate the complex signals traveling in 
both ways and sum them.

where L is the ground distance between the transmitter and the target, hT is the 
altitude of the target, and ht is the height (over ground level) of the transmitting 
antenna.

where X is the baseband complex transmitted signal, A is the ground reflection 
coefficient (usually negative, where the ground reflection reverses the signal 
phase), and λ is the wavelength of the illuminating signal. 
In the classical approach, described by (2.31), the time shift between the 
direct and indirect signals is not taken into consideration. When the distance 
difference is comparable or higher than the radar range resolution, a more

complex analysis has to be performed, including correlation between pulses 
coming both ways. A large distance between the two paths leads to reverses 
of the direct and indirect signals. When the distance difference is close to the 
width of the range resolution cell, the correlation coefficient is almost equal 
to 0, and instead of the signal fading due to opposite phase summation, one 
can observe an increase of total illuminating energy by 3 dB. As a side effect, 
degradation of range resolution can be observed. If the range distance (2.30) 
is significantly greater than the radar range resolution, then two targets can be 
observed instead of one. The true one, usually stronger, is closer to the radar, 
while the second is placed at a longer distance. 
For a rectangular spectrum signal the correlation function has the form 
of a sinc function. For a Gaussian signal spectrum, the correlation function is 
also Gaussian. In the case of a strong correlation of the direct and indirect sig­
nal, the illuminating power can vary from almost 0 to double that of the signal 
amplitude (6 dB). The lower and upper bounds for the illumination power 
change caused by the multipath effect versus the distance difference are plotted 
in Figure 2.26 for the rectangular signal spectrum and in Figure 2.27 for the 
Gaussian signal spectrum. 
As we can see, the bounds depend very slightly on the shape of the spec­
trum of the illuminating signal if the range shift is smaller than the range

resolution cell. For the Gaussian spectrum there is almost no illumination pow­
er change if the range distance is within the second resolution cell. For rectan­
gular illumination the power changes are small, within 1 dB. 
In the case when ∆R is bigger than two range resolution cells instead of 
summing energy, it is necessary to consider multiple detections of different 
ranges and different radial velocities.
A similar analyses can be performed for propagation from the target to the 
receiver. Thus, four different ways can be observed:
• Direct illumination–direct reception;
• Indirect illumination–direct reception;
• Direct illumination–indirect reception;
• Indirect illumination–indirect reception.
If the radar receiver is in the same place as the radar transmitter (monos­
tatic case), then either the signal variation is twice as high (in decibels) or three 
targets are visible (direct path, direct-indirect path, and indirect-indirect path). 
In the multistatic radar up to four targets can be visible.

Gaussian signal spectrum.

The flat Earth model is adequate only for small distances between the 
target, transmitter, and receiver. For longer distances it is necessary to apply a 
spherical Earth model. The results of the calculation of the distance difference 
obtained from the two models for an object at altitudes of 1 and 10 km, a radial 
velocity of 100 m/s, and placing the radar transmitter at 200m AGL, are pre­
sented in Figure 2.28. As can be clearly seen, the flat Earth model can be used 
for short distances (up to 10 to 20 km), while for longer distances the spherical 
model should be used. It is worth noting that at higher altitudes there are very 
small differences between the flat and spherical Earth models.
To obtain multiple targets, relatively flat (compared to wavelength) areas 
are required around the radar transmitters. The change of the illuminator-target 
distance also influences the Doppler frequency shift. While direct and indirect 
illumination have different path lengths and illuminate the target at different 
angles, in addition to the difference in range target position, it is possible to 
observe the difference in target radial velocity. The radial velocity differences for 
the conditions described above are presented in Figure 2.29.
The velocity differences are rather small and in most cases do not exceed 
1 m/s (for 100 m/s target velocity). The velocity resolution depends on integra­
tion time and wavelength, but in most cases it will not be possible to distinguish 
between direct path and indirect path echo in the velocity dimension.

In this chapter the fundamentals of classical radar technology were pre­
sented to provide to the reader with basic knowledge. In the following chapters 
advanced techniques used in noise radar will be presented. The radar funda­
mentals presented are dated from the beginning of the second half of the twen­
tieth century. Since that time, progress in pulse radar has been amazing and a 
great deal of modern signal processing technology has been developed. Readers 
can find information on modern radar signal processing in [2, 29, 30] and in 
many other books and journal papers.

Noise Radar
In the previous chapter the fundamentals of radar technology were shown. The 
different sounding waveforms were discussed starting from simple short pulses, 
continuing on to linear frequency modulation, and through to more complicat­
ed phase coded signals. In this chapter sounding signals in the form of random 
or pseudo-random sequences will be the focus of consideration. The properties 
of such sounding signals will be discussed and the method of processing signals 
to obtain good detection properties will be shown. 
The term “noise radar” refers to a group of radars using a random or pseu­
do-random waveform signal for target illumination. In many references, this 
type of radar is called a random signal radar (RSR) [1]. This type of radar can be 
used in a relatively wide range of applications. It is possible to construct surveil­
lance, tracking, guidance, collision warning, subsurface, and other radars using 
noise-sounding signals. Noise radars have several advantages over the classical 
pulse, pulse-Doppler, and FMCW radars. From the literature it follows that a 
noise waveform signal ensures the absence of range and Doppler ambiguity, low 
peak power, and very good electromagnetic compatibility with other devices 
sharing the same frequency band. Due to the low peak power, noise radars also 
have a very good electronic countercountermeasure (ECCM) capability. The 
probability of the interception of this kind of radar is also very low, and even if 
the sounding signal is detected, it is difficult to classify and treat it as the threat.
Unfortunately, this type of radar also has several disadvantages. Undoubt­
edly, signal processing in a noise radar is much more complicated in compari­
son to the corresponding pulse radar. The required computational power is very 
high and it is difficult to apply the noise radar signal processing in real time 
for high-bandwidth radars. Noise radars also suffer from near-far problems, 
very well known in radio communication. The received electromagnetic power 
changes with the reciprocal of the fourth power of the range, so for long-range

radars a very high, effective dynamic range (usually much higher than 100 dB) 
is required. For a smaller effective dynamic range, the masking effect will be 
clearly visible, and strong objects nearby will mask weak ones at a far distance. 
The first fundamental paper on noise radar was published by B. M. Hor­
ton in 1959 [2], presenting the major concept of a range measuring radar. The 
next papers in this area were published in 1960s and 1970s [3, 4]. At that 
time, the concept of noise radar did not attract many radar designers since the 
correlation signal processing was very difficult to obtain by means of analog 
electronic circuits. However, several researchers had been working on the noise 
radar concept. Two of them were M. P. Grant and G. R. Cooper from Purdue 
University [5]. They proposed the use of the analog delay line to compensate 
for the time delay of the echo signal and the use of an analog multiplier. The 
block diagram of their radar is presented in Figure 3.1. 
Such a radar can only detect slow targets (with the Doppler frequency 
lower than the bandwidth of a lowpass filter) at the single range gate selected by 
the delay of the applied delay line. 
Of course, it was possible to detect targets at different ranges by using a 
multiple receiving channel, as presented in Figure 3.2. By selecting the appro­
priate delays of an applied delay line, it is possible to select the range cells for 
which detections are performed.
Another approach to noise radars was proposed by P. R. Krehbiel and M. 
Brook in 1979 [6]. They used a pulse noise radar working in the X-band (λ = 
3 cm) with a pulse width of 1 μs and a bandwidth B of 300 MHz. The noise 
signal was generated by amplifying resistor thermal noise using a band limit­
ing amplifier. The output signal was keyed to form 1-μs pulses sent by the Tx/
Rx antenna. The received signal, separated from the transmitted signal by the

microwave circulator, was amplified by an input amplifier similar to the ones 
used for signal generation, and then passed via a square low detector (which 
simply calculated the square of the input voltage) and averaged with time con­
stant T  similar or equal to the pulse width.
The block diagram of this radar is presented in Figure 3.3. The radar 
was successfully used for meteorological purposes, detecting areas of clouds and 
rain, but at that time only amplitude data was used. The radar did not provide 
information about target velocity as it was very simple.
In the late 1970s more research was done on noise and pseudo noise ra­
dars. J. R. Forrest and D. J. Price from University College London worked on a 
digital correlator for noise radar [7] and later W. Knapp and B. Wigger worked 
on the use of surface acoustic wave filters (SAW filters) for signal compression 
in a pseudo noise radar using binary phase shift keying (PNBPSK) [8].
In the last two decades the noise radar concept has been rediscovered 
and a large number of scientists have begun to work on this kind of radar. The 
renaissance of noise radar has been caused by the quick development of com­
puting platforms and fast analog/digital converters. Modern high-speed digi­
tal signal processors (DSP), programmable logic devices (PLD) equipped with 
hardware multipliers, and multicore graphical processing units (GPU) make it

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
possible to calculate the transmitted and received signal cross-ambiguity func­
tion in real time. At present, the noise radar concept is the subject of intensive 
investigation. Many papers have been published on the short-range surveillance 
radar [9–11], on the imaging radar working both in SAR [13–28] and ISAR 
[29] modes, and on ground-penetrating radars [30–32].
Modern noise radars can be divided into several groups depending on 
the selected criteria. One of the most common criteria is the radar applica­
tion. According to this criterion, noise radars can be divided into the following 
main groups: surveillance radars, tracking radars, imaging radars, and ground-
penetrating radars, among others. It is also possible to divide the noise radar 
according to the carrier frequency, bandwidth, and range. The most important 
criterion in this book is the integration time criterion. According to this par­
ticular principle, it is possible to divide noise radar into three major groups 
[33]: short, medium, and long integration time radars.
3.1  Short-Integration-Time Pulse Noise Radar
A short-integration-time noise radar is a pulse coded radar that, instead of us­
ing a classical LFM or phase coded waveform, emits a noise or pseudo-noise 
waveform signal. Such a radar with incoherent processing has been described 
in [6]. However, most modern radars rely on coherent processing. This type of 
radar emits a train of noise-modulated electromagnetic pulses toward the target, 
applies the pulse compression technique, and detects the target. The range to 
the target is calculated by estimating the time delay of the return signal, and the 
radial velocity of the target is estimated using MTD techniques [34]. In terms 
of properties, the only difference between this type of noise radar and the pulse-
Figure 3.3  Block diagram of a pulse noise radar.

 
Noise Radar 
49
coded radar is the level of, and phase instability in, the range sidelobes. If the 
noise modulation is the same for all pulses within the MTD batch, then the sid­
elobes are stable and MTD processing will cancel both the ground clutter and 
its time sidelobes. In the case where a different realization of noise is applied for 
each pulse, then the main lobe clutter (in the time dimension) will be canceled 
by MTD processing, while the time sidelobe clutter will remain and decrease 
the ability to detect small targets in the clutter environment.
For pulse noise radar the integration time is equal to the transmitted pulse 
length. Due to a short integration time, it is necessary to calculate a single-
dimensional correlation function between the transmitted and the received sig­
nals. To avoid detection losses caused by Doppler shift, the pulse duration time 
should be shorter than λ/2vmax. A typical integration time, depending on the 
radar carrier frequency and the maximum target velocity, is within 1÷100 μs. 
The advantage of such a radar is that the signal processing is relatively simple, 
consisting of range compression and MTD processing, and requires relatively 
low computational power.
3.2  Medium-Integration-Time Continuous Wave Noise Radar
In a medium-integration-time radar target detection is performed using range-
Doppler correlation processing. This procedure is very similar to the calcula­
tion of the cross-ambiguity function [35–37]. The medium integration time 
refers to a situation for which the target remains in both the range and Doppler 
resolution cell during the integration period. The integration time is limited 
by constraints (2.15) and (2.25), and is usually within the range of 1÷1,000 
ms. The maximum integration time depends of course on the radar carrier fre­
quency, the signal bandwidth, the maximum target velocity, and acceleration.  
The medium integration time concept may be used in radars equipped 
with a mechanical or electronically scanned antenna, as well as for those 
equipped with a multibeam antenna. To avoid strong cross-talk between the 
transmitter and receiver, the transmitting and receiving antennas have to be 
separated. A transmitted signal is continuous, at least during integration time. 
The received signal, which is a delayed, Doppler-shifted copy of the transmitted 
signal, is divided into segments and processed by a correlation processor. The 
ranges and radial velocities of targets are evaluated directly by the correlation 
processor, while the target azimuth is estimated using one of the following tech­
niques: the sigma-delta antenna angle estimation technique [34], the interfero­
metric technique [38, 39], usually called the monopulse estimation [40–44], 
or the technique of estimating the centroid of power envelope while using a 
mechanically scanned antenna.

50 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
3.3  Long-Integration-Time Continuous Wave Noise Radar
In a long-integration-time radar the target is illuminated for a relatively long 
time, and in this case the target can migrate between the radar range and range 
velocity resolution cells. As a rule, the integration time exceeds the constraints 
(2.15) and (2.25) and is usually in the 1÷10 second range. Such a relatively 
long integration time may be achieved by the use of a tracking radar or the use 
of a multibeam radar with a fixed set of antenna beams. In the first approach 
the receiving antenna has to track the target using either electronic or mechani­
cal beam positioning. The time on target may be almost infinite, but in the 
case where the tracking process is performed using measured angle data, the 
integration time is limited by the target position update rate required by the 
tracker. In the second approach the radar is equipped with an omnidirectional 
or sector transmitting antenna and a set of directional receiving antennas cover­
ing the required surveillance space. Instead of using a multi-antenna receiving 
system, it is possible to design a multibeam planar or circular receiving antenna 
using analog or digital beamformers. The signals from targets located in the 
surveillance space are received simultaneously by a multichannel receiver. The 
integration time is then limited by the time the target remains within the single 
antenna beam (2.16), and by the required target update rate (equivalent to the 
scan time in the classical radar).
Signal processing takes into account the target range and velocity mi­
gration, and thus is more elaborate and requires much higher computational 
power than the signal processing in the medium integration time radar. 
3.4  Fundamentals of the Noise Radar Correlation Receiver 
As stated in the previous chapter, a noise radar illuminates the target with a 
noise waveform and listens to the echo. A typical functional diagram of the 
noise radar is presented in Figure 3.4. 
The noise signal is produced in the noise generator. This generator may 
be constructed using an analog technique, for example, amplifying the thermal 
noise, or generating the noise digitally by replaying the data samples stored in 
the memory and converting it to an analog signal using fast digital analog con­
verters (DACs). In general cases, it is assumed that the generator output signal 
is a complex one. It can be achieved by generating two independent real-valued 
signals, one for a real part and one for an imaginary part, and treating them 
as a single complex signal. From a theoretical point of view, the output of the 
noise generator can be treated as the band-limited noise signal xT (T ), centered 
around the zero frequency. The bandwidth of the signal B can vary from tens 
of kilohertz to thousands of megahertz or more. The carrier frequency F is 

 
Noise Radar 
51
generated by a separate, highly stable sine signal generator. The noise signal is 
upconverted to the carrier frequency in the first mixer. It is worth noting that 
from a theoretical point of view the mixer performs the operation of multiply­
ing the complex noise signal by the complex harmonic signal. This operation in 
the frequency domain is equivalent to the simple frequency shift. In this book 
the technical aspects of upconversion and downconversion are omitted. More 
information on that subject can be found in [45, 46]. This high-frequency sig­
nal generated by the mixer (usually equipped with a bandpass filter) is amplified 
and emitted using the transmitting antenna. The echo signal arriving to the 
receiving antenna is also amplified and downconverted to the baseband in the 
second mixer. It should be pointed out that again the mixing operation can be 
treated as the frequency shift. At the output of the mixer the complex analog 
signal is produced. The baseband received signal xR(T ) (consisting of two real-
valued signals) is digitized and passed into the correlator. The reference signal 
for the correlator xT (T ) is produced by downconverting the transmitted signal 
using a third mixer. In the case where the downconverted transmitted signal is 
used as a reference signal, both receiving (measurement) and reference signals 
are passed via an identical (or almost identical) downconverting channel and 
the amplitude and phase distortion to both signals should be the same. A direct 
usage of the generated noise signal xT (T ) as the reference signal is also possible, 
but it would usually lead to large errors in the correlation process, while the up­
conversion and downconversion processes are a source of amplitude and phase 
distortion. If we can measure these distortions, it is possible to incorporate a 
measured frequency response in the processing chain and filter the reference 
signal using an appropriately designed filter.

Theoretically the autocorrelation function of the white noise is a Dirac 
delta function, the infinite peak at zero time delay and zero for other time de­
lays, as presented in Figure 3.5. 
Such results are for the infinite bandwidth of the signal and infinite cor­
relation time. In all practical cases the bandwidth of the signal is limited, and 
correlation time is also limited as stated in (3.2). In such cases the shape of the 
correlation function is (in approximation) presented in Figure 3.6. The main 
peak width is approximately 1/T i , while the time sidelobe level is approximately 
it B  times below the main peak (in the linear amplitude scale).
A correlation receiver improves the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) by the fac­
tor T iB, where B is the bandwidth of the transmitted noise signal. This simple 
correlation processing can be used only in short integration noise radars for

slow moving targets, where the Doppler effect during integration time can be 
negligible. Figure 3.7 presents the example signal produced by the correlator 
when a T iB factor is equal to 100, in the case where the transmitted and re­
ceived signals are identical. 
Figure 3.8 shows the output signals produced by a correlator in a situation 
where only white thermal noise is received. The powers of the received signals 
are equal in both cases. 
The shape of the main peak of the correlation function and the shape of 
the time sidelobes are related to the shape of the spectrum of the noise signal.

As we can see from (3.4), the autocorrelation function is the inverse Fou­
rier transform of power spectral density of the noise signal. Let us start our 
consideration from the rectangular spectrum of the noise signal. The inverse 
Fourier transform of the rectangular signal is in the sinc (sin(x)/x) function, so 
uses the rectangular signal spectrum (or power density; in this case both signal 
spectrum and signal power density has a rectangular shape). The sinc function 
has high sidelobes (up to -13 dB), so such a signal spectrum is not the prefer­
able one for a radar application. Of more use is the triangle power spectrum, for 
which the autocorrelation function is sinc2. The first sidelobe is at the level of 
−26 dB below the main peak, but such a value is still high. The most interesting

shape of spectrum is the Gaussian function exp(-αx2). In this case the autocor­
relation function is also Gaussian and no lobes are present (in theory). In prac­
tice the limitation of integration time introduces sidelobes (sometimes referred 
to as residual fluctuations) as shown in Figures 3.6 and 3.7. 
The selected power density function and related autocorrelation functions 
are summarized in Table 3.1. Please note that in many books [47] it is possible 
to find more functions that have the Fourier transform in analytic form, but 
the power density function is a positively defined function (having only non-
negative values) and only such functions can be taken into consideration.
3.5  Target Detection in Noise Radar 
In the previous section information on how to process signals using the correla­
tion function was presented. Assuming that a received signal consists only of 
receiver white noise and echo, the optimal detection (in the mean square sense) 
is based on correlation processing, but such processing must be followed by an 
appropriate detector, as presented in Figure 3.9.
To detect the useful signal in most radar systems, the constant false alarm 
Neyman-Pearson detector [34] is commonly used. This detector compares the 
signal after correlation processing with the selected threshold D. The hypothesis 
H0 (where there is only thermal noise and no useful signal) is assumed when the 
signal is below the threshold, and hypothesis H1 (where there is thermal noise 
plus target echo) is assumed when the signal exceeds the threshold.
When no reflected (echo) signal is received, the signal at the output of a 
correlation receiver has a Rayleigh probability density function (PDF) due to 
Table 3.1

the central limit theorem (CLT) and almost regardless of the input noise (or 
interference) PDF. The CLT is applicable in this case where the discreet imple­
mentation of correlation processing is equivalent to the weighted sum of the 
independent (or almost independent) samples of input noise or interferences. 
In Figure 3.10 the threshold value versus the probability of a false alarm 
(PFA) is plotted. It can be easily seen that for the 10−6 probability of a false 
alarm, the threshold level Do should be at 12 dB over the correlator output 
noise level [34]. The probability of detection depends on the mean return signal 
power and selected threshold level. In Figure 3.11 the detection probability for

a nonfluctuating target (Swerling model case 0 [34]) is plotted. As follows from 
the figures, the detection probability 0.9 can be reached for a signal to noise 
level equal to 14 dB (with a threshold chosen for PFA = 10−6).
3.6  Correlation Processing of Moving Target Echoes
The correlation function described by (3.1) can only be used for motionless 
(stationary) or very slow targets. To detect moving targets, the Doppler frequen­
cy shift has to be taken into account in the detection procedure. Let us assume 
that the transmitted signal can be treated as a narrowband signal. The received 
signal, reflected from a moving target, is then a delayed and Doppler-shifted 
copy of the transmitted signal and can be described by (2.19). The complex 
envelope of the received signal can be expressed by the formula:

where A denotes the complex echo signal amplitude (A = |A| exp(jϕR). The 
optimum detector (in the mean-square sense) is based on the matched filter 
concept. The output of the filter, matched to the signal echo described by (3.5), 
can be calculated as an integral:

Of course, the concept of the matched filter can be utilized directly only 
when the position and velocity of the target are known. To detect a target at an 
unknown position, it is necessary to construct a bank of filters matched to all 
possible targets ranges and their velocities. Such an approach leads directly to 
the range-Doppler correlation function, defined as:

The above relation is very similar to the cross-ambiguity function (2.26), 
but as opposed to the cross-ambiguity function, the time delay is applied only 
to the transmitted signal. Such a transformation form is more convenient for 
practical implementation in digital techniques, and will be further referred to 
as a range-Doppler cross correlation function. 
The relation (3.7) can be treated as a set of one-dimensional correlation 
functions of the received signal and the Doppler-shifted transmitted signal, or 
as a set of Fourier transforms of the multiplication of the received signal and a 
complex conjugation of the time-shifted transmitted signal. 
Figure 3.12 presents an example diagram of the absolute value of the 
range-Doppler cross-correlation function between the received and transmitted 
signals for a single target at the distance of 10 km and radial velocity of 100 m/s, 
computed directly using (3.7). It is easy to notice the presence of relatively high-
frequency sidelobes, caused by a boxcar window following integration limits. To 
decrease the sidelobe level, other time windows can be used. The windowing 
can be applied either at the transmission side (by changing the amplitude of the 
transmitted signal) or during signal processing. The second approach leads to 
the concept of nonmatched filtering, described by the following formula:

where w(t) is a windowing function. An example result of the application of 
the Hamming window to range-Doppler correlation processing is presented in 
Figure 3.13. The first sidelobe level is decreased from −13 dB to −60 dB.
3.7  The Range Equation Formulated for Noise Radar 
Let us consider a noise radar equipped with a transmitting antenna with gain 
GT and a receiving antenna with gain GR. This radar transmits the electromag­
netic signal of power PT and illuminates a target characterized by cross-section 
So located at a distance R from the radar. The received echo signal power is

To detect the reflected signal in the presence of the thermal noise, the cor­

received signal can be detected when its power is higher than the power of the

From the theory presented earlier, it follows that the value of the detect­

The detection range can be increased by increasing the transmitted power 
PT , the antenna gain G, and the integration time T i. For a medium integration

Assuming the maximum target velocity at the level of Mach 3 (1,000 m/s), 
the maximum value of the time-bandwidth product is limited to 150,000. The 
maximum processing gain is then equal to 51.7 dB. The use of a windowing 
function will decrease this value by a few decibels. If the noise radar is used for 
detecting or imaging slower targets, then it is possible to increase the correlation 
gain, as stated in Table 3.2.
3.8  Long-Correlation-Time Noise Radar Processing
The integration (correlation) time ti is one of the most important parameters 
that can influence the sensitivity of a noise radar. The integration time in the 
medium-integration-time radars, where signal processing is based on (3.7), is 
limited by the range and velocity cell migration effects, described by constraints 
(2.15) and (2.25) to the values presented in Table 3.2. To achieve a longer cor­
relation time, it is necessary to incorporate range and Doppler cell migration 
effects into the detection algorithm. Let us consider at the beginning the range

to the target can be written as R = Ro + vt. In (3.5) the influence of the target

It is now clearly seen that the reference signal is now stretched according 
to the ratio of target and light velocity. The computational complexity involved 
in calculating a range-Doppler cross correlation function is now much higher 
than the computational cost of calculating the final result using (3.8), while it 
is necessary to time-scale the transmitted signal. Time scaling, also referred to as 
stretch processing, may be performed in the time domain by resampling a trans­
mitted signal or in the frequency domain by using the chirp transform [47, 48].
3.9  Stretch Processing 
To obtain long time integration, it is necessary to perform the stretch process­
ing/time-scale change of the reference signal according to (3.12). The idea of 
applying stretch processing as time transformation is not new. Time scaling, 
time slowdown or speed-up, and even time reverse techniques were introduced 
in the second half of the twentieth century [49]. For time scaling the analog 
dispersive delay line was used and time scaling was performed that time for 
short pulses only.
In a modern noise radar correlation processing is performed digitally, so 
the time scaling can be achieved by resampling the reference signal. The result­
ing reshaping of the reference signal spectrum should not introduce phase and 
frequency errors. The quality of stretch processing is fundamental for obtain­
ing a high integration gain and long detection range. The above conclusion is 
also valid for other types of radars. In pulse radar simplified range migration 
processing can be performed after pulse compression by the coherent integra­
tion of the signal over several range cells [50]. Stretch processing in the FMCW 
radar has been considered in [51]. In this case the stretch processing may be

implemented effectively with the use of a group of subband filters (frequency-
dependent delay lines). The applications of stretch processing have also been 
presented in [52–54]. 
In noise radars stretch processing can be implemented in many different 
ways. Among others, the three most popular algorithms that are frequently 
used are: linear interpolation between samples, cubic spline interpolation, and 
resampling based on the pairing of chirp transform and inverse FFT. The results 
obtained by using the algorithms mentioned above are close to each other. 
It should be pointed out that stretch processing should be performed in­
dependently for each velocity resolution cell. However, such an approach re­
quires very high computational power. To implement a long integration time 
concept in real-time applications, it is essential to make some simplifications. 
In most cases it is sufficient to stretch the reference signal not for each Doppler 
resolution cell but for the group of velocity cells occupying the velocity strip 
width ∆v. The velocity strip width ∆v should satisfy the constraint (2.15). In 
other words, the strip width ∆v should be smaller than c/2BT i. Thus, in order to 
calculate the whole range-Doppler correlation plane it is necessary to perform 
N = 4BT ivmax/c stretching operations and calculate the range-Doppler correla­
tion in each narrow velocity interval.
The effectiveness of stretch processing verified using a Monte Carlo simu­
lation is presented in Figures 3.14 through 3.17. Three moving point objects 
were used in simulations. The first object had a range velocity of −270 m/s and 
a range of 5.8 km, the second object had a velocity of 6 m/s and a range of 
13.4 km, and the third object had a velocity of 705 m/s and a range of 25 km. 
All echoes had the same strength. The results of the long-time range-Doppler 
processing of the 1-second data record (100-kHz bandwidth) are presented in 
Figure 3.14. Without stretch processing only the second target echo is properly 
focused, as it is almost stationary. The first and the third target echoes are defo­
cused in both range and velocity. The integration gain of the first echo is 3 dB 
smaller than the integration gain of the almost stationary target. For the third 
target, the integration loss is greater than 10 dB.
The range cross-section of all plots is presented in Figure 3.15. It is easy to 
see that defocusing is strictly related to signal losses. Additionally, high-velocity 
targets, for which the range migration effect occurs, are smeared not only in 
range but also in velocity. This effect is due to the fact that the object remained 
in the single resolution cell for much shorter than the integration time T i, and 
shortening the effective integration time (limited in this case by range walk) 
decreased the velocity resolution. 
The concept of dividing the full velocity range into several intervals re­
quires the calculation of several range-Doppler cross-correlation functions, each 
using a reference signal stretched according to velocity nc/2BT i, where n is the 
index of the segment –N/2 < n < N/2).

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
Figure 3.16 presents the absolute value of the whole range-Doppler cross-
correlation function calculated using a reference signal stretched according to 
the velocity of the third echo. The cubic spline algorithm has been used in this 
example. It is obvious that the third target echo is focused, while the other 
echoes are unfocused and attenuated. 
The final results of the segment-based stretch processing are presented in 
Figure 3.17. The correlation plane has been divided into N velocity segments, 
and each of them has been stretch-processed with the segment middle velocity 
as a reference. All three echoes are focused and the amplitudes are now almost 
equal.
Consequently, for extended integration time the assumption of constant 
target radial velocity may not be valid. The target radial velocity changes (range 
acceleration) can cause both velocity cell migration and additional range cell 
migration. If integration time exceeds the time limit described by (2.25) (ve­
locity cell migration), or exceeds the limit described by the following formula:

then the target echo will be defocused. Those formulas describe the limits af­
ter which a more complex approach is needed, adding an extra dimension of 
acceleration. 
3.10  Processing with Radial Acceleration
The extension of the integration time requires the introduction of radial accel­
eration into the target motion model. For the constant radial acceleration the 
range to the target can be expressed as

The limitation of the integration time in long-correlation-time noise ra­
dars is caused now by the rate of acceleration changes, the time that the target 
remains in the antenna beam, and the required target refresh ratio. In typical 
radar systems this time limit takes values from the range of 1÷10 seconds. It is 
worth noting that for a long correlation time it is possible to estimate not only 
the target position and range velocity, but also the target range acceleration, so 
the target update rate can be relatively low without the risk of the radar tracker 
losing track or making an error in the target-plot association procedure.

nal stretched according to the third target echo (grayscale in decibels).

The idea of acceleration estimation in a radar technique is not new [59]. 
The accuracy of the acceleration estimation depends on the target observation 
time. In classical air traffic control radars such time is very short, so the accuracy 
of the estimation of both velocity and acceleration is very low. In FMCW radars 
the observation time is usually much longer, so more effort was assigned to this 
problem [55, 57, 60].
The estimation of target acceleration can be performed both in long and 
medium correlation time noise radars [56]. The coordinates of the maximum 
of the range-Doppler correlation function are the estimates of the target coor­
dinates (range RT  and velocity vT ). The target acceleration can be estimated by 
finding the coordinate of the maximum of the single-dimensional acceleration 
transform [56] calculated for the estimated target range and velocity:

The example results of the estimation of the target acceleration are pre­
sented in Figures 3.18 through 3.20. A single moving target placed at a distance 
of 15.5 km with a range velocity of 430 m/s and a range acceleration of 8.8 m/

s2 was used in the simulation. In Figure 3.18 the results of the range-Doppler 
processing (2-D processing) are presented. The echo is well focused in both 
range and velocity, while the acceleration is small enough and fulfills the con­
straint (2.25).
The absolute values of a velocity-acceleration cross correlation function 
(3.19) for the estimated target range are presented in Figure 3.19, and the re­
sults of the acceleration processing described by (3.18) are presented in Figure 
3.20. The estimate acceleration (the coordinates of the maximum acceleration 
transform) agreed very well with the model.

Masking Effects
In the previous chapter single-target detection using a noise radar was pre­
sented. Typical noise radar processing based on the calculation of the range-
Doppler correlation function described by (3.8) [1] is optimal only in the case 
where a single target echo creates the received signal. In practical cases, however, 
the radar observes many targets [2], and in addition to target echoes, ground 
clutter echoes and weather clutter echoes also exist in the received signal. In a 
pulse radar the echoes reflected from scatterers at different ranges are separated 
in time. In continuous-wave radars, and especially in noise radars characterized 
by medium and long integration time, all targets and clutter echoes overlap 
and interfere with each other. The overlap of echoes leads to effects known as 
masking effects [2–4]. Weak echoes of far-off targets can be masked by much 
stronger echoes of nearby targets or ground clutter reflections. In this chapter a 
detailed description of the masking effect together with algorithms designed to 
mitigate this problem will be presented [2, 5].
The correlation detection concept described by (3.6) is not optimal when 
more than one target’s echo exists in the received signal. The received signal 
containing many echoes may be represented by:

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
which is a simplified form of (4.1). The number I stands for the total number 
of objects observed by the radar, Ri is the range to the ith target, and vi is the 
ith target velocity. Remember that (4.2) is a simplification of the target echo 
model valid for medium integration time, where no target range and velocity 
walk occurs.
The single target optimal detection is based on the concept of matched 
filtering. While the target range and range velocity are unknown, a bank of fil­
ters matched to different target ranges and range velocities is used. The maximal 
signal is present at the output of the filter tuned to target range and range ve­
locity. In the case where multiple targets echoes exist in the received signal, the 
matched filter concept is not optimal. In the case where the selected matched 
filter is tuned to the parameters of one target (range and velocity), the echoes 
originating from other targets add their power to the power of the receiver noise 
and increase the processing noise floor [2]. This effect can decrease the detec­
tion range in the case where the power of one or more echoes exceeds the re­
ceiver’s noise power (characterized by the receiver’s effective temperature). The 
detailed description of this effect is a subject of interest in this chapter.
To simplify the problem stated above, let us assume that two target echoes 
are present in the received signal: one strong echo originating from a nearby 
target and one weak echo originating from a far target. Detection of the first, 
strong echo will be performed almost perfectly without any degradation, while 
detection of the weak echo will be difficult or impossible in practice due to the 
interference caused by the strong echo. In such a case, when the matched filter 
is tuned to the far echo, the first, strong echo signal can be treated as additional 
noise, increasing the receiver noise floor above the thermal noise level to the 
value:

where S1 denotes the radar cross-section of the first (nearby) target, r1 denotes 
the nearby target’s distance to the radar, and TRe denotes the effective receiver 
temperature. The increase of the noise floor causes a decrease of radar sensitivity 
and consequently degrades the radar detection range. This effect can be treated 
as masking weak (usually far) targets by strong (nearby) ones. The far-target de­
tection range, calculated by substituting the noise power calculated from (4.3) 
into the classical range equation, is shortened in such a case to the value:

D S . This value is some­
times several orders of magnitude smaller than the free-space, single-target de­
tection range. In the case of receiving many strong echoes originating from 
point-like targets or range and Doppler spread clutter, the situation is still 
worse. The power of the total interfering noise is a sum of the receiver thermal 
noise power and the powers of all strong echo signals.
Another approach to the masking problem is to convert the additional 
noise to the classical loss factor of radar range equation (3.12). The losses calcu­
lated using such a concept for classical noise radar are presented in Figure 4.1. 
The diagram was calculated assuming that the noise radar observed two objects 
of the same cross-section at different ranges and the echoes of both targets were 
much stronger than the receiver thermal noise. The time-bandwidth product 
was 50 dB (100,000). The horizontal axis is the ratio of the far to near distance, 
Figure 4.1  Detection losses in the case where two targets of the same radar cross-section 
at different ranges are observed by noise radar.

78 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
and the vertical axis presents the losses in decibels. As one can see, no losses oc­
cur only if the far-to-near range ratio is above 0.1 (e.g., the far target is 100 km 
from the radar and the near target is 10 km away). If that ratio is equal to 0.01 
(e.g., the far target is 100 km from the radar and the near target is 1 km away), 
losses reach 18 dB (the radar detection range is decreased 2.8 times). If such a 
ratio reaches the value 0.001 (e.g., the far target is 100 km from the radar and 
the near target is 100m away), losses rise to 58 dB and the detection range is 
reduced 28 times, under the assumption that both targets have the same radar 
cross-section. 
In practice many radars observe very large ground surfaces in the near 
distance, so a noise radar equipped only with a range-Doppler correlator will be 
almost blind due to very strong ground clutter echoes. The masking problem is 
also illustrated in Figures 4.2 and 4.3. 
Figure 4.2 illustrates the basic case where a single object is visible by noise 
radar because the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is smaller than the time-
bandwidth product and the output (after correlation) SNR is higher than the 
detection threshold. In such a case the target is detected and its position (range 
and range velocity) can be estimated. The figure is a simplified one, and the 
constant (asymptotic) value of the sidelobes (or noise residues), as well as the 
thermal noise, is plotted. They are random variables, and measured (real-life) 
values are closer to what is plotted in Figures 3.5 to 3.7 than to a straight line. 
When the additional strong echo exists in the input signal and the strong 
signal to weak signal power ratio is higher than the time-bandwidth product 
(illustrated in Figure 4.3), then the sidelobes (after processing) of the stronger 
echo will be higher than the weaker echo peak and in such case the weaker echo 
will be undetected. 
Figure 4.2  The signal components after correlation processing: the main peak of the weak 
echo is above the thermal noise and thus can be detected.

 
Masking Effects 
79
To avoid the masking effect and restore the original noise radar sensitivity, 
the received signal must be CLEANED and the strong components have to be 
removed. The mathematic background and implementation of such processing 
is presented next.
4.1  Cancellation of the Point-Target Masking Effect 
As stated in Chapter 3, classical range-Doppler processing, optimal in the case 
of a single target, is very sensitive to the presence of high-power components. 
The noise radar can easily be blinded by the strong echo signal, so to avoid this 
effect and construct a long-range noise radar robust to the presence of strong 
ground clutter, additional processing is required.
In modern radar systems all signal processing is performed digitally. The 
received signal, prior to signal processing, is sampled with the sampling period 
Ts. It can be represented in the discrete time domain by the formula:

where n denotes the time instant number and I denotes the number of targets

ceived signal, the optimal detection of the targets by noise radar can be achieved 
by solving the set of nonlinear equations:

target echo is detectable, and the weak target echo is below the sidelobes of the strong target 
and is not detected.

. The number of unknown independent 
variables is equal to 3I. If the signal model (4.5) is to be free of the receiver 
noise, then (4.6) could be solved using the block of samples of length N = 3I. In 
the presence of receiver noise such a solution would be very inaccurate. Better 
accuracy can be obtained by using a much longer data block. While the number 
of equations in this case is greater than the number of unknown parameters, the 
overdetermined equation set can be solved by minimizing the mean-square er­
ror. Such an approach is computationally ineffective and sometimes gives false 
alarms (false detections), when the true number of targets I is unknown.
A more computationally effective approach is based on the adaptive re­
moval of the strong echo components of the received signal [2, 6]. In its simpli­
fied form it is assumed that all visible targets can be modeled by point scatterers 
separated in the range-Doppler domain. If this assumption is not fulfilled, a 
more elaborated approach, presented in Section 4.3, should be applied.
The initial step of the procedure is the calculation of the range-Doppler 
cross-correlation function described by (3.8). In the second step the strongest 
echo is located by finding the maximum of the range-Doppler cross-correlation 
function. The coordinates of the maximum of the computed absolute value of 
the range-Doppler cross-correlation function indicate the estimates of target 
range and velocity. These estimates of the strongest target position 1ˆR , velocity 
1ˆv , and amplitude 
1ˆA  are further used for modeling the strongest target echo 
signal. The modeled signal is subtracted from the received signal according to 
following formula:

The signal (1)( )

echo signal. The algorithm described above is a modification of a CLEAN type 
algorithm [7, 8] originally used in radio-astronomy to reduce the problem of 
observing weak radio sources in the presence of strong ones. 
The resulting signal vector (1)
R
x
, which consists of a noise signal and weaker 
echoes, can be further processed according to the same adaptive echo cancella­
tion procedure until all echoes are removed from the signal, and the noise floor 
is reached. The method above is based on computations in the time domain. 
Its main disadvantage is that the estimated target range time delay is usually 
not the multiplicity of the sampling interval. The estimated target time delay is 
usually fractional, lying somewhere between the correlation function samples, 
as shown in Figure 4.4.
As a consequence, a resampling of the reference signal is required. The 
quality of the cancellation procedure depends significantly on the quality of 
resampling. To obtain good cancellation of the strong echo signal, a complicat­
ed resampling based on high-order polynomial modeling is required. An alter­
native approach is based on strong echo cancellation in the frequency domain.
Let us assume that both signals (reference and measurement signals) are 
amplified and downconverted by analog circuits with the same amplitude and 
phase transfer function K(ω). After downconversion, the signal is sampled

terval Ts fulfills the Nyquist theorem. In that case the range-Doppler cross-

), m is the Doppler shift

efficiency, the fast Fourier transform (FFT) is often used to calculate the cross-
correlation (4.8). Let XR = FFT(xR(0..(Mi – 1))) be a vector containing the 
Fourier transform of the measurement signal vector of length Mi, and Let XT = 
FFT(xT(0..(Mi – 1)))  denote a vector containing the Fourier transform of the

m) that returns the vector X shifted by m elements clockwise. A single row of 
the range-Doppler function (4.8), for a selected Doppler shift index m, can be 
treated as the inverse Fourier transform of the product of the Fourier transform 
of the measurement signal (usually zero-padded) and the complex conjugation

The location of the maximum value of yl,m can be found in the discrete 
domain l,m. The discrete estimates of the Doppler frequency and range of the 
target has insufficient accuracy for strong echo cancellation described by (4.7), 
and more accurate estimates of those parameters should be used. The simple 
estimation method based on fitting a parabolic curve to the logarithm of the 
absolute value of yl,m, described by the author in [9], has been selected for mod­
eling the main peak of the shape and for estimating the target range and velocity 
by finding the coordinates of the maximum value of the parabolic curve, both 
in range and Doppler. This method has been used for all simulations presented 
in this chapter.
The estimated values of Doppler shift 
1ˆm  and range shifts 1ˆl  are not integer 
numbers required for a direct use of the discrete time version of (4.7), because 
the time shift is usually not an integer multiple of the sampling time Ts. To 
overcome this problem, reference signal resampling is required for modeling 
the strong echo signal in the time domain. In the frequency domain, however,

83
the time resampling is not needed [2]. In this domain the well-known time-
shifting properties of the FFT transform, FFT(x(t – τ)) = FFT(x(t))e-jτω, can 
be used. The strong echo signal model in the frequency domain can be evalu­
ated by computing the Fourier transform of the reference signal vector multi­
plied element by element with a harmonic signal of the estimated Doppler fre­
quency

The resulting output signal (in the frequency domain) is further subject 
to the detection process of remaining weaker echoes. These computations can 
be performed iteratively until all strong echoes are removed from the received 
measurement signal. The procedure described above requires L + 1 calcula­
tions of the range-Doppler cross-correlation function, where L is the number 
of iterations. 
The question is how many dominant scatterers it is necessary to remove, 
and whether it is possible to terminate the procedure before removing the last 
echo.
The answer is positive. It is possible to terminate the procedure when the 
strongest echo is much smaller (say, more than 10 dB) than the noise floor plus 
time-bandwidth product (in the decibel scale). If such a condition is reached, 

84 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
then all the next targets will have a rather small contribution to the noise floor 
(except in the case where there are many of them).
Such an approach, even if terminated earlier, is very ineffective from the 
point of view of the computational power requirement. However, it is possible 
to decrease the computational complexity by calculating the range-Doppler 
cross-correlation function only twice (or a few times). In the first stage, the 
range-Doppler cross-correlation function is calculated using the received sig­
nal. In the second stage, all strong targets are detected and their range and 
Doppler coordinates are estimated. In the third stage, the strong target echo 
removal procedures are carried out for all detected targets, sorted from stron­
gest to weakest. In the fourth stage, the final range-Doppler cross-correlation 
function is calculated and the weak targets are detected. Such a procedure can 
introduce some detection losses and produce some false alarms, but it requires 
much less computational power. If the total power of all the echoes detected in 
the fourth stage is smaller than the thermal noise then the procedure should be 
terminated. If not, then the cleaning and detection stages should be repeated 
once more.
The example results obtained using the algorithm described above are 
presented in Figures 4.5 through 4.7. For the simulation the signal bandwidth 
of 100 kHz was selected and the integration time was equal to 0.1 second. 
The reference signal was modeled as band-limited Gaussian noise obtained by 
the lowpass filtering of complex white noise. The thermal noise was modeled 
as complex Gaussian white noise. The measurement signal consisted of two 
echoes of different amplitudes, shifted both in range (time shift) and velocity 
(Doppler shift). The S/N ratio for the first, strong echo was equal to 20 dB 
(calculated at the input, before correlation processing), the range was 5 km, and 
the velocity was -300 m/s. The second, weak signal had an S/N equal to -20 
dB, a range of 31 km and a velocity of 150 m/s. The time-bandwidth product 
was equal to 10,000 (40 dB).
The range-Doppler cross-correlation function calculated for the measure­
ment and the reference signals is presented in Figure 4.5. The strong echo peak 
is clearly visible while the weaker signal is completely buried (not visible) in the 
correlation sidelobes (noise floor). To obtain the detection of the weak echo, the 
CLEANing procedure was applied. The result of the strong echo cancellation 
procedure is presented in Figure 4.6. After applying the cancellation procedure, 
the strong echo has been suppressed more than 40 dB (together with the cor­
responding sidelobes) and, due to this, a weak echo peak can easily be detected. 
For a comparison Figure 4.7 presents the magnitude of the range-Doppler 
cross-correlation function in the case where the measurement signal consists 
only of the weaker echo and the thermal noise. There is only a slight difference 
in the noise floor sidelobe structure, but the noise floor takes the same level 
in both cases. In the experiments presented above, the reference signal was a 

 
Masking Effects 
85
“pure” one, which means that it was free of any distortion and additional noise 
components (such as reference channel receiver noise). In real situations, how­
ever, the reference signal also includes a white noise component weaker than 
the reference signal by a factor of the S/N ratio of the reference channel (which 
can be at a level of 60 to 110 dB, depending on the quality of the mixer and 
A/D converter used). The noise of the reference channel receiver is then added 
to the measurement channel signal during the strong-echo-removal procedure. 
As a result, the performance of the presented method is limited by the reference 
channel’s S/N ratio.
The procedure described above is effective only for mitigating the mask­
ing effect of point-like target echoes. This procedure can be easily applied in 
low and medium resolution radars for ensuring radar sensitivity in the direction 
of strong target echoes. It is also possible to implement the strong echo cancella­
tion procedure in the long time integration radar. Radars of this type require the 
additional stretch processing of the reference signal, described in Section 3.4.1. 
For range spread target echoes spanning several resolution cells, it is necessary to

4.2  The Stretch Processing for Point-Like Target Cancellation 
In the previous chapter a very simple target echo model was applied. It was as­
sumed that the time delay is constant and the target movement only influences 
the Doppler frequency, which was also constant during observation time. Now 
we will add another effect to the signal model: a time stretch under the assump­
tion of a constant target radial velocity v. Under such an assumption, the range 
to the target can be expressed as R(t) = Ro + vt. In (4.2) the influence of the 
target velocity is limited only to the Doppler effect, which is a good approxima­
tion when the observation time is short enough. For a longer integration time 
the received baseband signal differs from the transmitted one by the Doppler 
modulation of the phase and by its envelope being delayed and time-scaled:

In (4.2) the factor 2v/c in the envelope argument was assumed negligible 
with respect to one, which is not true for the long integration time. Therefore,

cessing noise floor (correlation sidelobes) is attenuated by 25 dB. Grayscale is in decibels.

to calculate the long-time model of the signal it is necessary not only to shift 
the transmitted signal envelope in time, but also to perform the time stretch op­
eration. For longer integration times more complicated target motion models 
should also be taken into consideration. For the constant acceleration in R(t), 
the range to the target can be expressed as

In this model the Doppler component has a polynomial phase, which 
makes the correlation processing more complicated due to the necessity to esti­
mate the phase polynomial coefficients. A detailed description of this problem 
can be found in the previous chapter.
If the time of the observation is extended even further, higher derivatives 
of range R(t) should be taken into consideration, and also the amplitude must 
be treated as a variable of time, as the received power is related to the radar-
target distance and the aspect ratio. Also in such a case the target rotational

only the weak echo is present in the received signal. Grayscale is in decibels.

88

motion can influence the model, while target rotation can introduce the ampli­
tude modulation due to the variation of RCS versus aspect angle.
The quality of the CLEANing procedure depends on the quality of the 
model used (agreement between the model and the echo signal) and the quality 
of model parameter estimation. In the case where the range or Doppler posi­
tion of the target is estimated with a large error, the CLEANing procedure will 
cancel only part of the signal and the echo residue power will remain.
Figure 4.8 presents the echo residual power after the removal of a strong 
object versus a normalized target range estimation error (range error to range 
resolution cell size). The 0-dB level in the residual power represents the power 
of the strong object and means that residual power is equal to echo power, so 
the cancellation was not successful at all. It can be seen that a 10% range estima­
tion error will limit the quality of the CLEAN procedure to the value of about 
14 dB and a 1% accuracy to the value of 34 dB, and, to obtain more than 60 
dB, of CLEANing, it is necessary to have a range accuracy better than 0.1%. 
A similar analysis, but in this case for velocity accuracy, is presented in 
Figure 4.9. The results are almost identical to the range case and a 10% Dop­
pler frequency (range velocity) estimation error will result in the limiting of the 
CLEAN procedure to the value of about 14 dB and a 1% accuracy to the value

89
of 34 dB, and, to obtain more than 60 dB of CLEANing, it is necessary to have 
a velocity accuracy of better than 0.1%. 
Another factor is the range migration of the target during coherent inte­
gration time. Such migration implies two effects in noise radar. The first effect 
implies integration losses while the time the target remains in the resolution cell 
is shorter than the integration time. The second implies losses in the CLEAN­
ing procedure, while the modeled signal differs from the received one.
The losses in the correlation receiver due to the neglecting of the stretch 
effect are shown in Figure 4.10. The losses are defined here as the degradation 
of the S/N at the correlation receiver output for a moving target with respect 
to a stationary target of the same echo strength. The x-axis is scaled with vt/dR, 
the target migration during observation (integration) time t, normalized to the 
radar resolution cell size in range dR. As can be seen from the plot, the losses 
start to be visible when the range migration in the integration time approaches 
the range resolution cell size and becomes very high for a migration of several 
range cells.
An example of the second effect is presented in Figure 4.11. The residual 
power after the removal of a strong object is shown versus the target migration 
normalized to the range resolution cell. It can be seen that the effective removal 
of the object echo becomes a problem much earlier than when the correlation

ror, normalized to the Doppler frequency resolution cell.

90 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
losses show up. If the target migration is within 1% of the resolution cell, then 
it is possible to clean the target with 44-dB quality, which is sufficient for most 
cases. However, such a small migration is only for slow targets, with a velocity 
equal to 1% of the maximum assumed target velocity (10 m/s for vmax = 1,000 
m/s). The echo of the targets that migrate 10% of the range resolution cell will 
be attenuated only by 24 dB, and targets that migrate through the entire resolu­
tion cell will be attenuated only by 4 dB.
The avoidance of such effects is possible with stretch processing. In the 
derivations of both the correlation receiver and the strong echo canceler, the ex­
pected target echo is modeled using the known transmitted signal (a template) 
as a base. In the case of stretch processing, the construction of a modeled echo 
[according to (4.13)] requires modulating the baseband template with the tar­
get’s Doppler frequency (to match the Doppler shift in the received signal) and 
stretching the template in time (to match the envelope stretch).
In practice all the processing is done by digital means. The transmitted 
signal template is obtained either by the sampling of an analog noise or just by 
storing the digitally generated pseudo-noise signal that is used to modulate the 
carrier. Thus, the stretching of the reference signal requires the changing of the 
sample rate of the signal according to the equation:

where xT(t) is the continuous representation of a discrete-time transmitted sig­
nal template xT(n) and ts is the sampling interval. Depending on the target 
direction, the velocity v can be positive or negative; the time scale has to be 
dilated or compressed. 
As it can be seen from the above equation, with the practical values of 
velocity v the sample rate ratio differs from 1 by a very tiny fraction, for ex­
ample, for the v = 150 m/s the ratio 1 + 2v/c is equal to 1 ± 10-6. This makes 
the effective resampling a complicated task to be done in real time. Many of 
the popular methods developed (e.g., for image processing) are suitable only for 
rescaling by a ratio of two relatively small integers. Several fast methods will be 
discussed next.
One of the simplest resampling methods, used mainly in image process­
ing, is the nearest-neighbor interpolation [13]. The method is very fast, but at 
the cost of poor accuracy. In the case of a sample rate change very close to 1 as 
expressed by (4.15), the nearest-neighbor resampling consists of periodically 
removing (or duplicating) one of c/2v samples.

Another simple method is the linear interpolation method, where a new 
sample is calculated as a linear combination of adjacent original samples:

Polyphase filtering methods are a computationally efficient form of 
upsampling by an integer factor N and then downsampling by another factor 
M, with lowpass filtering to remove aliasing [14]. In a standard application they 
allow the obtaining of a rational M/N stretch factor using a linear filter with M 
coefficient sets, changing for each output sample. For a noise radar application, 
the number of coefficient sets is very large, as the M/N has to approximate a 
number very close to 1, but a simplified approach using the technique similar 
to the one described in [15, 16] can result in a smaller number of coefficient 
sets. First, a simple polyphase resampler is used to calculate the sample values 
for time instants from a set of points oversampled by some integer factor. Then 
a simple linear interpolation is performed to find a more exact value at a desired 
point between these samples. Such an approach will be referred to in the follow­
ing as the modified polyphase method.
Spectrum-based methods consist of the conversion of a signal to the spec­
tral representation and making the resampling a manipulation in the spectral 
domain. The manipulated spectrum is then converted back to the time domain 
(e.g., using an efficient IFFT algorithm). Similar to the polyphase filter resam­
pling, the methods based on FFT allow resampling by a rational factor N/M, 
where M and N are orders (numbers of points) in FFT and IFFT. The existence 
of very efficient libraries of functions for the software implementation of the 
arbitrary order of FFT/IFFT, using state-of-the-art mathematical concepts and 
programming techniques [17], makes the FFT method a very good choice if 
the resampling factor can be expressed as a ratio of two integers. In other cases, 
another spectral method may be of use, namely, chirp-z transform resampling. 
The chirp-z transform [14] is an efficient method to compute the z-trans­
form on a set of points that are defined as an where n =N0 …N1. By setting
a = ej2π(1+2v/c)/N and calculating the chirp-z transform of an N-point FFT, we 
effectively obtain the signal resampled with exactly the required rate [18]. An 
example of this method being applied to image scaling is shown in [19]. The 
efficient implementation of the chirp-z transform is about three times more 
complex than the FFT. It has been shown that in the case of correlation pro­
cessing for a PCL radar the simplest interpolation methods perform well [18].

93
To illustrate the accuracy of the methods described above the result of 
simulations are presented in Figures 4.12 and 4.13. As the transmit signal, a 
noise signal with a bandwidth equal to 0.6 of the sampling frequency was used. 
Three stretching methods were investigated: linear interpolation, modified 
polyphase (with 2× upsampling followed with linear interpolation), and the 
chirp-z based method. The plot shown in Figure 4.12 confirms the usability 
of all stretching methods for correlation processing in a noise radar (the losses 
being within 1 dB). However, only the chirp transform does not introduce 
losses. It is worth noting that, due to linear resampling errors, the first method 
introduces losses for small range walks (much smaller than one range resolution 
cell) while applying no stretch provides better results. 
In the case of strong echo cancellation algorithms, the requirements on 
stretch quality are higher. The results plotted in Figure 4.13 show the cancella­
tion residual power using different resampling methods for stretch processing. 
In comparison to no stretch processing the linear interpolation method shows 
some improvement, about 14 dB, which is not enough in a typical application. 
The improvement occurs only for target range walks similar or bigger than the 
range resolution cell. For small walks (below 30% of the range resolution cell), 
there is no improvement. The modified polyphase method performs a little bit 
better, providing about 21-dB improvement for a long walk and a few deci­
bels for a small walk. Only the chirp-based method allows the attainment of 
Figure 4.12  Correlation losses after stretch processing.

the desired improvement, about 40 dB over almost all the evaluated migration 
values range. In most cases this is enough to remove a strong target completely.
4.3  Cancellation of Direct Signal and Range Spread Clutter 
In the previous chapter the effective method for the cancellation of the masking 
effect regarding the point-like targets was presented. In many practical cases 
the dominant part of masking effects comes from range-spread ground clut­
ter echoes and cross-talk between the transmitting and the receiving antenna. 
Cancellation of the direct signal, as well as the cancellation of range spread 
stationary target echoes (ground clutter) spanning several range resolution cells, 
requires another approach. From one point of view, this part of the process is 
much more complicated, as range spread clutter has to be attenuated with a 
much more complicated model, but it is simpler as it deals only with the time 
shift of the signal while the Doppler shift is zero (or almost zero). 
4.3.1  The Simple Method of Direct Signal Cancellation
In an ideal case the separation between the transmitting and the receiving an­
tenna is infinite, so no direct (transmitting) signal is defused to the receiving 
signal. In real cases separation between these two antennas is limited to the

value of tens of decibels. The presence of a transmitted (direct) signal in the re­
ceived signal produces a high level of sidelobes in the correlation process, which 
may completely mask almost all echoes of interest. The cross-talk can be treated 
as the presence of a very strong object very close to the radar, and, using (4.4), 
it is possible to calculate the detection range in the case of cross-talk. 
The power of the received target echo signal is described by (3.7). The 
power of direct (crosstalk) signal at the receiver input is equal to: 
	
T
d
P C

L
=

where PT denotes transmitted signal power, C denotes cross-talk coefficient, 
and L stands for radar (transmitting and receiving) losses. Usually the direct

For example, the maximum detection range for a 1-m2 target for a radar 
working in the X-band (carrier frequency 10 GHz) with the processing gain of 
tiB = 50 dB, an omnidirectional transmitting antenna, a directional receiving 
antenna with a 30-dB gain and −80-dB crosstalk between antennas, is equal to 
120m. This detection range is independent of the transmitting signal power 
(assuming that this power is high enough to produce cross-talk significantly 
higher than the receiver thermal noise power, in this case higher than a few mi­
crowatts). To obtain the detection range of 40 km, the additional 100-dB direct 
signal attenuation is required. The numbers presented show that to construct a 

96

useful noise radar it is necessary to ensure a very high dynamic range and very 
low cross-talk between the transmit and receive antennas. 
The direct signal can be attenuated using a simple adaptive procedure. Let

In practical cases the direct signal is not removed completely. The direct 
signal attenuation factor depends on several factors. The most important factor 
is the colinearity of phase and the amplitude transmission characteristic K(ω) of 
the surveillance and reference channels. The absolute value of the gains of those 
two channels are not important while the actual cross-talk is estimated and 
removed adaptively, but the mismatch in the frequency characteristic decreases 
the direct signal attenuation factor. It is very difficult to ensure the required co­
linearity of channels by using analog filters, so it is recommended to use wide­
band analog front-end and digital filters for final signal filtering. The second 
factor, also very important, is the time delay τC between the point from which 
the reference signal is acquired and the point of cross-talk. For the relatively 
small time delay τC the receiving signal can be represented by:

The use of the procedure described above does not allow the removal 
of the cross-talk signal fully while there is decorrelation between the reference

The attenuation factor of the direct signal (

(normalized by the signal bandwidth) is illustrated in Figure 4.14.
It follows from the plot shown in Figure 4.14 that a good enough attenu­
ation (more than 100 dB) can be obtained only in the case where the time delay 
between the point when the reference signal is sensed and the point of cross-talk 
multiplied by signal bandwidth is in the order of 10-3. Assuming a 10-MHz 
signal bandwidth, the physical distance between those two points must be kept 
within 3 cm. However, it is usually difficult to fulfill this requirement. More­
over, in many practical cases there are several sources of crosstalk, separated in 

98 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
space. In order to obtain a good attenuation of the direct signal it is necessary 
to use a more elaborate cancellation procedure, which is presented in the next 
section. 
4.3.2  Ground Clutter Cancellation
There is another reason for the decrease of noise radar sensitivity besides the 
direct signal cross-talk: strong ground clutter echoes coming from the vicin­
ity of the radar can significantly increase the processing noise floor or even 
saturate a radar receiver. In typical pulse radars two mechanisms of ground 
clutter mitigation are applied. The first is sensitivity time control (STC), which 
changes the gain of the radar receiver or introduces additional losses just after 
the pulse emission in the first tenths of microseconds to avoid receiver satura­
tion by strong nearby echoes. The second is the attenuation of ground clutter 
by using classical moving target detection or moving target indication (MTD/
MTI) techniques. The received signal is passed through the bandpass or high­
pass filters that attenuate the zero-Doppler echoes. It was shown in [5] that 
such an approach is not effective in noise radars, where filter-based removal of 
ground clutter does not remove the sidelobes of ground clutter and a simple 
MTD procedure does not eliminate the masking effect.

ence signal and crosstalk normalized by signal bandwidth.

To remove the ground clutter echo signals together with the sidelobes 
related to them, a more complicated adaptive removal procedure should be ap­
plied [5, 21].

targets) can be represented by:

(4.29) can also be used for modeling a direct signal, for which r is close to zero. 
Assuming that the spectrum of the received signal is band-limited, it is possible 
to apply time sampling with sampling period Ts < 1/B. The sampler produces 
the discrete time signal described by the following formula:

It was shown that this model is also useful for predicting the clutter signal 
without the assumption of the slow change rate of clutter reflectivity.
To remove the ground clutter and the direct signal, it is necessary to es­
timate the unknown vector of the complex amplitudes [Ai] of the cross-talk 
signal and clutter echoes and to subtract the modeled clutter signal from the

The number of unknown independent variables is equal to I, and thus the 
minimal number of equations is N = I. In the absence of the receiver thermal 
noise, this number of equations would be adequate and the estimated vector 
{ ˆ
iA } would be equal to {Ai}. In practical cases thermal noise is present at the re­
ceiver input and it is necessary to estimate the amplitude vector { ˆ
iA } by solving 
the overdetermined equation set (4.33) using a much longer data record. 
Equation (4.33) can be solved using linear algebra methods [20]. Let us 
assume that XR denotes the row vector containing N received signal samples, 
namely, n = 0 to n = N - 1, and XT denotes the transmitted signal vector also 
containing N signal samples (n = 0 to n = N - 1). Furthermore, let XT(l) be the 
transmitted signal vector shifted in the time domain by l samples, containing 
N signal samples from n = -l to n = N - 1 - l. Let XM be a transmitted signal 
matrix of dimension N  I, consisting of transmitted signal vectors XM = {XT(0), 
XT(1), …, XT(I -1)}. Let A be a column vector containing unknown clutter 
complex amplitudes {Ai} for i = 0 to i = I - 1. Equation (4.29) can then be 
rewritten in the following matrix form:

After finding the estimates of the complex amplitudes { ˆ

easy to remove the ground clutter echoes from the received signal. After this 
operation a clutter free signal should be obtained. The removal procedure can

The received signal xRC(nTs) obtained in this way (after the clutter remov­
al procedure) can be next used for range-Doppler calculation and moving target 
detection. It should be pointed out that the procedure described above can 
effectively remove not only clutter echoes, but also the direct signal crosstalk. 
It results from the fact that the crosstalk signal can be also modeled by (4.32).
The procedure presented may also be derived using a linear space concept 
[22]. The received signal can be treated as a single point in the multidimension­
al signal space (see Figure 4.15). The dimension of this linear space is N (the 
number of received or reference signal samples in the processed data block). 
Usually this dimension is in the range of 105 to 107.
In this approach the clutter removal procedure is based on the concept of 
the decomposition of the signal space into two subspaces, namely, the clutter 
Figure 4.15  The received signal as a single point in multidimensional signal space.

102 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
and target subspace. In this situation the most straightforward method of clut­
ter reduction will be the projection of the received signal onto the target sub­
space (see Figure 4.16). Such a method, however, is very difficult to implement 
as the dimension of the target subspace is very large. 
The alternative method is based on calculation of the clutter signal and its 
subtraction from the received one. The dimensionality of the clutter subspace, 
usually in the order of 102 to 104, is usually much smaller than the dimension­
ality of the target subspace. For this reason it is much easier to calculate the 
projection of the received signal on the clutter subspace. Such a projection (see 
Figure 4.17) is equivalent to the estimation of the clutter signal.
In the next step the clutter signal is subtracted from the measurement 
signal. As a result, one obtains the clutter-free measurement signal, consisting 
of the receiver thermal noise and the target echoes as presented in Figure 4.18.
The methods discussed above are equivalent to each other only if the tar­
get subspace is orthogonal to the clutter subspace. The situation is completely 
different when there is no orthogonality between these subspaces and under 
the assumption that the clutter echo power is much higher than the target 
echo power. In such a situation the second method is much more effective and

ensures almost total clutter removal. As a result part of the target echo power 
will also be removed, but the loss of sensitivity is relatively small (usually below 
1 dB). 
The zero-Doppler clutter subspace is spanned over the vectors formed by 
the time-delayed copies of the reference signal, where time delay varies from 
zero to the delay corresponding to the maximum assumed clutter distance. The 
maximum clutter distance for a ground-based radar is limited by the radar hori­
zon in the location it is placed or by the power budget; then such budget limits 
the maximum distance for which the clutter echoes have sufficient echo power 
to be detected by radar (of course after removing strong components).
For the infinitely long observation time the time-shifted versions of the 
noise signal are orthogonal to each other. In this case it would be possible to 
use the simple orthogonal projection of the signal on each clutter base vector as 
presented in Figure 4.19. In all practical cases observation time is finite and the 
vectors forming the clutter subspace do not form the orthogonal base. For that 
reason the more elaborate algorithms for clutter suppression have to be used 
for that purpose. One possibility is to solve the linear equation set described by 
(4.34) (see Figure 4.20). Another possibility is based on forming the orthogonal 
base vector set using the linear transformation of the clutter base vectors.
Figure 4.18  Calculation of the clutter-free target’s signal.
Figure 4.19  Projection of the signal on orthogonal clutter base vectors.

104 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
Another idea of clutter base orthogonalization is the use of Gram-Schmidt 
process as presented in Figure 4.21. The first base vector remains unchanged. 
The second orthogonal base vector is formed from the second vector by sub­
tracting from that vector its projection on the first vector. The consecutive or­
thogonal base vectors are formed from the consecutive original base vectors by 
subtracting their projection on the already constructed orthogonal base vectors. 
The method described above is rather ineffective as it requires I(I - 1)/2 vector 
projections and subtractions. It can be used only for a small I number.
The signal orthogonalization can also be performed using the lattice filter 
[10, 21, 23, 24] presented in Figure 4.22. This method requires much smaller 
computational power than the previous one but only provides good orthogo­
nalization for long data blocks. 
The lattice filter presented in Figure 4.22 consists of I − 1 identical blocks, 
producing the backward (Xb(i)) and forward (Xf (i)) prediction error vectors on 
the basis of the backward and forward prediction error vectors from the previ­

ous stage (Xb(i−1) and Xb(t−1)). At both inputs of the first stage the transmitted 
(reference) signal vector XT is applied. 
The lattice filter backward prediction errors from consecutive filter stages 
are orthogonal to each other, and thus the lattice structure can be used for clut­
ter base orthogonalization. The partial correlation coefficients for each stage are 
calculated using the following formula:

In Figures 4.24 through 4.29 the simulated result of the ground clutter 
removal procedure is presented. The received signal consists of the direct sig­
nal (+40 dB over receiver noise), several ground clutter echoes (0.. 20 dB over 
receiver noise), a strong moving target echo (S/N = 0 dB) at a range of 15 km, 
and a weak echo moving target echo (S/N = −16 dB) at a range of 27 km. The 
result of the correlation processing of the received signal is presented in Figure 
4.24. Only the direct signal and the strong ground clutter are visible. The pro­
cessing noise floor is at the level of 95 dB and it masks moving-target echoes. 
The result of the classical MTD procedure, which filters out the zero-Doppler

components, is presented in Figure 4.25. The direct signal, as well as the ground 
clutter, is filtered out, but the processing noise floor is at the same level. Both 
moving targets are masked by the sidelobes of the direct signal and the ground 
clutter echoes. The removal of the direct signal improves the situation. The 
result of the range-Doppler processing of the received signal after the direct 
signal removal procedure is presented in Figure 4.26. The processing noise floor 
is now reduced by 15 dB to the level of 80 dB, and the strong moving target 
echo is now clearly visible together with the ground clutter echoes. The weak 
target echo is still below the processing noise floor (sidelobes of ground clutter). 
Again, the usage of the classical MTD technique, presented in Figure 4.27, 
removes the ground clutter, but does not remove the ground clutter sidelobes, 
and thus the weak target is still hidden in the ground clutter sidelobes. The 
procedure for ground clutter removal described above completely eliminates 
the direct signal and the ground clutter echoes together with their sidelobes, as 
depicted in Figure 4.28. In the case presented, the processing noise floor has 
been reduced by 35 dB to the level of 60 dB. Now both moving target echoes 
are clearly visible. 
Just for comparison, in Figure 4.29 we present the result of the range-
Doppler processing of the received signal in the case where no direct signal

or ground clutter was present. Those two figures (Figures 4.28 and 4.29) are 
almost identical (it is possible to notice only slight differences in the processing 
sidelobes structure) and it shows the effectiveness of the described procedure for 
the ground clutter echo removal. 
The block adaptive method presented in this chapter is only one of several 
possible methods used for ground clutter cancellation in noise radar. Almost all 
adaptive filtration procedures can be applied for this purpose [4, 25–27]. How­
ever, block algorithms perform better when block processing is applied. Recur­
sive algorithms are better suited for continuous signal reception and block par­
titioning after a ground clutter removal procedure. Recursive algorithms usually 
require a bit more computational power, but do not have to remember whole 
blocks of data so they are better suited for fast signal processing, especially using 
field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs).
4.3.3  Doppler-Spread Clutter Cancellation
The method presented in Section 4.2.2 is very efficient for the direct signal 
and for the zero-Doppler ground clutter cancellation. As it was shown in the 
Figure 4.25  The magnitude of the range-Doppler cross-correlation function for a measure­
ment signal containing a direct signal and ground clutter after MTD processing. Grayscale is 
in decibels.

presented example, the described method can completely cancel both the direct 
signal and the ground clutter with their processing sidelobes. 
In many real radar scenarios the clutter model is much more complicated. 
The Doppler shift of the clutter echo is not always zero, while the clutter scat­
terers may be swung or moved by the wind, vibrate, or have a more complicated 
motion. As stated in [28], the ground clutter spectrum very often has a Gauss­
ian shape and Doppler spread equivalent to the clutter movement with a speed 
from 0.01 to 5 m/s. The Doppler spread is different for different areas (ground 
types). In urban areas buildings can be swung by the wind [28–30]. The tops 
of high buildings may have velocities up to 0.1 m/s. In urban areas, except for 
the reflections from buildings there are a lot of reflections from vehicles and 
pedestrians. The velocity spread for pedestrians is in the range of 2 m/s, while 
for vehicles it can reach 30 m/s. Depending on the application, the pedestrians 
and vehicles can be treated as the targets of interest or as clutter. For vegetation 
areas (fields, forests, meadows), leaves and branches can be swung by the wind 
with the velocity spread of almost 1 m/s. On the sea’s surface there are many 
types of waves that can travel in various directions with different velocities. Sea 
clutter usually has a velocity spread in the range of several m/s and also a non­
zero mean Doppler frequency. Much more complicated is weather clutter. In 
Figure 4.26  The magnitude of the range-Doppler cross-correlation after the direct signal 
removal procedure. Grayscale is in decibels.

heavy wind conditions the mean clutter velocity can reach tens of m/s, with a 
very wide velocity spectrum caused by wind turbulence (especially during storm 
conditions).
To detect the weak targets in the presence of Doppler spread clutter, it is 
necessary to attenuate those clutter echoes [31, 32]. The noise radar Doppler-
spread clutter echo signal can be modeled by the weighted sum of the time de­
layed and Doppler shifted copies of the transmitted signal, where the maximum 
time delay is limited by the maximum range of the clutter, and the maximum 
Doppler shift is limited by the maximum clutter velocity. For the sake of sim­
plicity it is assumed that there is the Doppler separation between the clutter and 
the targets. The clutter signal can then be modeled by the discrete formula [32]:

Under further consideration, the first model described by (4.44) will be 
applied. All presented results however can be easily adapted to more elaborate 
clutter models, described by (4.39) and (4.40). It is worth noting that those 
clutter models can be applied both to medium integration and long integration

by the constraint (2.15).
As in the previous case, clutter cancellation can be performed by estimat­

As in the case of zero-Doppler ground clutter, it is possible to construct 
the received signal vector XR as the row vector containing N received signal 
samples from n = 0 to n = N - 1. The transmitted signal matrix XM (dimension 
NxIx(2K + 1)) now consists of time and Doppler shifted copies of the trans­
mitted signal. Let us denote that XT(l,k) is the transmitted signal vector shifted 
in time by l samples, multiplied element by element by frequency shift vector 
{exp(-2πnk/N}. The vector XT(l,k) can then be written in the form:

Equation (4.48) can be then rewritten in the matrix form (4.34), and the 
unknown coefficient vector A can be estimated using the mean-square solution 
of (4.34), which is described by (4.35). 
However, the direct usage of the method described above is very limited. 
Such a method was not numerically effective in the case of ground clutter, 
where the dimensionality of clutter subspace was in the order of 102 to 104 and 
now the dimensionality of clutter subspace is much higher, in the order of 103 
to 105. Except for a high numerical complexity of the method, we can expect 
relatively high numerical errors during matrix inversion and thus limited qual­
ity of the clutter suppression.

114 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
Instead of solving the overdetermined equation set, it is again possible 
to apply the concept of the projection of the received signal on the clutter 
subspace. The clutter subspace is now spanned on time-delayed and Doppler-
shifted copies of the transmitted signal. The matrix XM (4.51) contains all clut­
ter base vectors. Again, as in the case of the ground clutter removal, the clutter 
subspace base vectors do not form the orthogonal base. The orthogonalization 
of clutter subspace is now much more difficult. The classical orthogonalization 
procedure described in Section 4.2.3 has very high computational complexity, 
so suboptimal methods are required.
The presented method is based on the observation that in most cases 
the dominant part of clutter energy originates from zero-Doppler or almost 
zero-Doppler echoes. The use of the lattice filter can produce a zero-Doppler 
orthogonal base in the form of {XC(i)} (4.41). Applying the frequency shift to 
those vectors, one can obtain an almost orthogonal clutter base, constructed 
from vector XC(i,k):

The idea of simple clutter removal using a nonorthogonal base is pre­
sented in Figures 4.30 and 4.31. The signal at the input of the consecutive stage 
is projected on the consecutive base vector. The projected clutter component 
is subtracted from the signal, and the procedure is continued for the next base 
vector. In Figure 4.30 the removal of the first clutter component is presented. 
The removal of the second component is presented in Figure 4.31. After finish­
ing the procedure the clutter is not removed completely because of a lack of 
orthogonally of the base vectors; some residual clutter remains in the signal. 
This clutter can be further reduced by applying the clutter removal procedure 
again. When the clutter base vectors are already created, the computational cost

sary to store all clutter base vectors in data memory, which can be difficult in

The quality of the single-pass Doppler spread cancellation depends on the 
angle between the clutter base vectors. Instead of calculating the angle between 
vectors, it is possible to calculate the base vector product. For orthogonal vec­
tors such a coefficient is equal to zero, and for the proposed base vector it is 
equal to:

In general cases the vector product for k2 ≠ k1 is more than Bti ≈ N smaller 
than it is for k2 = k1, so the clutter cancellation procedure should work pretty 
well. For constant amplitude noise (constant amplitude base vectors) this prod­
uct is equal to zero for k2 ≠ k1, and this is the reason why constant amplitude 
noise is preferred for a noise radar working in an environment with Doppler 
spread clutter. For the cross-terms, for k2 ≠ k1 and i2 ≠ i1, the vector product 
is equal to the Fourier transform of the product of the vectors

for the frequency (k2 – k1)/N. While both vectors consist of independent white 
noises, their product should have a white spectrum, and the mean value of the 
product (4.57) should also be smaller than the mean vector energy by factor 
Bti ≈ N. 
In Figures 4.33 through 4.37 a simulated result of the Doppler spread 
clutter removal procedure is presented. The scenario consists of one point target 
echo (at the range of 7 km and a velocity of -22 m/s) and 100 clutter point 
echoes, distributed randomly in range and Doppler. The Gaussian distribution 
for the Doppler spread has been chosen. The result of the correlation processing 
of the received signal is presented in Figure 4.33. Only the strong zero-Doppler 
clutter is visible. The clutter returns reach a level of 74 dB. The processing noise 
floor is at the level of 25 dB and it masks the moving target echo. 
The effect of the zero-Doppler removal procedure is presented in Figure 
4.34. After removing the zero-Doppler clutter, it is possible to observe the Dop­
pler spread clutter, which reached the level of 57 dB. The maximum clutter 
level was reduced by 18 dB, but the processing noise floor was reduced only by 
13 dB to the 12-dB level. Reduction of the noise floor is smaller than the re­
duction of the maximum clutter level because now there are many contributors

to the overall level of the noise floor. Now it is possible to guess the location of 
the target echo, but the target echo level is still at the same level as the higher 
processing sidelobes. Using classical automatic detection procedures [28] based 
on a constant false alarm rate detector, it would be very difficult to detect the 
target. After the application of the Doppler spread clutter removal procedure 
described by (4.56), the processing noise floor was reduced by a further 20 dB 
reaching the level of -8 dB. The target echo is now clearly visible as depicted 
in Figure 4.35, but the residual clutter remains in the clutter rejection region 
(range from 0 to 12 km, velocities from -10 m/s to 10 m/s). The second use 
of the Doppler spread clutter rejection procedure (see Figure 4.26) significantly 
clears the clutter rejection area and decreases the processing noise floor by an 
additional 3 dB, to the level of -11 dB. In this example the clutter cancellation 
procedure increased the dynamic range of the radar by 36 dB, extending eight 
times the radar detection range. 
Just for comparison, in Figure 4.37 the result of the Doppler spread clut­
ter reduction based on the overdetermined equation set solving is presented. 
The result is very similar to the case of the double usage of the previous algo­
rithm (compare it with Figure 4.36). The difference in the processing noise

floor is within 0.5 dB, but in this case the clutter rejection region has been 
cleared completely.
4.4  Robustification of the Noise Radar Signal Processing
Target detection of the target of interest in a noise radar is based on the cor­
relation of the transmitted signal with the received one, which is equivalent to 
the matched filtering of the received signal. Matched filtering is optimal (in the 
mean square sense) only when one target is present in the received signal and 
the receiver noise (thermal noise of the receiver, external noise, interference) 
has a Gaussian probability density function (PDF). In the previous chapters 
analyses of the multitarget problem were presented and a suboptimal solution 
based on the CLEAN concept was proposed. Now we will discuss the problem 
of the occurrence of non-Gaussian interferences at the input of the correlation 
receiver.
In many practical cases the input noise consists of impulse interferences 
and the Gaussian part originates from the receiver thermal noise. As a result, 
the receiver noise has a non-Gaussian PDF with heavy tails and the correlation

process is no longer optimal. To improve noise radar sensitivity in the case of a 
non-Gaussian PDF of the input noise, radar engineers use nonlinear process­
ing, which is usually known as robustification of the radar detection. The name 
comes from the fact that after such a procedure, a radar is much less sensitive (so 
it is robust) to the changes of the probability density function of input noises 
and interferences. Just to show the existence of the problem, the real part of the 
signal recorded during a noise radar experiment at the Warsaw University of 
Technology is presented in Figure 4.38. The measurement was performed from 
the roof of the university situated in the center of Warsaw, in a typical urban 
environment. It is easy to see the impulsive character of the signal. In Figure 
4.39 the probability density function of the real part of the received signal is 
presented. For reference normal distribution was plotted in a dashed line. In the 
one sigma region there is a pretty good agreement between the measured and 
Gaussian PDF, but at further regions (for higher amplitudes) the heavy tails are 
clearly visible. 
Next a robustification procedure will be shown in a noise radar applica­
tion, and the effective solution of detector robustification in case of clutter will 
be shown.

For decades, the Gaussian probability distribution has been one of the 
most important tools of the description of random signals in communications 
and signal processing theory and practice. Many methods and algorithms for 
signal processing have been derived on the basis of the Gaussian character of 
signals under consideration. One of the most important reasons for the role 
of the Gaussian distribution in such signal processing lies in the central limit 
theorem (CLT) which states that a random variable being a sum of infinitely 
many independent random variables with finite variances are normally (Gauss­
ian) distributed. Thus, if there is no a priori information about the statistical 
model of the noise, it is reasonable to assume that the noise in an additive 
channel will obey the Gaussian model. This model is also very popular when 
there is a closed-form solution for problems where such noise exists. In the 
derivation of various signal processing algorithms, the Gaussian assumption 
leads to linear solutions, which are elegant from a mathematical point of view 
and usually relatively cheap in implementation. Another great advantage of the 
Gaussian model is its invariance under linear transformations. This means that 
all filtration algorithms, correlations, and Fourier transforms do not change 
the PDF if the input PDF is Gaussian. Moreover, if the input PDF is non-
Gaussian, such a linear operation will almost turn it into Gaussian, based on

the CLT. The Gaussian process is described completely by its second-order mo­
ments (the mean value and variance) and no numerically burdensome higher 
order statistics are necessary in this case. Moreover, we can use very attractive 
mathematical tools such as the Hilbert space formalism in the analysis of the 
Gaussian random variable. 
Despite the strong theoretical motivation and practical usefulness of the 
Gaussian model, there are many cases where noise generation is not based on 
the accumulative process and in which the model is unrealistic and inadequate 
[33–35]. These problems are related to the impulsive nature of many signals and 
noises present in the physical world. The impulsive behavior manifests itself in 
large amplitude outliers occurring in the observed data, with a probability that 
is significantly higher than that predicted by the Gaussian distribution. Thus, 
non-Gaussian distributions with much heavier tails are required for the proper 
probabilistic description of signals with impulsive noises. For decades, many 
efforts have been made in literature to develop statistical non-Gaussian models 
for impulsive noises. Classical statistical-physical models of interference in radio 
channels were proposed by Middleton [36–38]. He introduced three different 
classes of electromagnetic interferences, denoted as A, B, and C. Middleton’s 
models have been widely accepted since they describe real impulsive interfer­
ences very well. However, the mathematical complexity is a big disadvantage of 
these models. This is particularly true for the class B model that contains six pa­
rameters, including one which is purely empirical. Alternatives to his model are 
the symmetric α-stable (SαS) distributions presented in [39, 40]. The α-stable 
distributions constitute a different class of distributions but they can also suc­
cessfully approximate Middleton’s class B distributions [41]. Such distribution 
is difficult to handle mainly due to the lack of a closed-form expression of PDF. 
The another candidate which approximates Middleton’s class A distribution 
is the ε-contaminated model, which is the mixture of two weighted Gaussian 
PDFs described by the following class of distributions:

where N(0, s2) is the Gaussian distribution with the variance σ2, 0< ε <1 is a 
distribution parameter describing how often heavy tails occur and κ >> 1. It is 
possible to expand this model for a more element weighted sum of Gaussian 
PDFs [42]. 
The intuitive interpretation of the ε-contaminated model (4.60) is very 
simple. Most of the observed input noise is assumed to be Gaussian, but a frac­
tion ε of observations is affected by another, heavy tails noise, which also has 
Gaussian distribution but with a much larger variance. Such outliers can be 
caused by many phenomena: atmospheric discharges, man-made interferences, 
communication disruptive signals (like WiFi), and others.

124 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
It is well known that almost any algorithm developed on the basis of the 
Gaussian assumption loses its optimal properties while the noise probability 
density function is not Gaussian. Even a small deviation from Gaussianity usu­
ally leads to the loss of optimality and can cause significant performance deg­
radation of the algorithm. It is especially true in the detection process, where 
heavy tails can either raise the probability of a false alarm or, after proper use of 
the constant false alarm rate detector (CFAR), increase the detection threshold 
and then significantly decrease the probability of the detection of useful targets.
As was stated before, the probability density function of the noise at the 
output of the correlator is Gaussian almost regardless of the input probability 
density function, but heavy tails can change the noise floor of the processing 
and as the result decreases the sensitivity of the radar. This drawback can be 
omitted by introducing some nonlinear data transformation before the correla­
tion in the place where the non-Gaussian probability density function exists. 
In many statistical problems, when the PDF of the input signal is known, this 
nonlinear transformation can be chosen optimally. Huber formulated in [43, 
44] the minimax rules of the optimal choice of these nonlinear functions. He 
considered the problem of the robust estimation of the location parameter θ in 
the case of an independent, identically distributed observation of the form xi = 
θ + ui where ui are described by a distribution belonging to the class (4.60). The 
proposed robust M-estimator ˆθ is given by the solution of a nonlinear equation:

where xi represents the ith observation and ψ is the robustifying func­

known, that is, when the parameters ε and κ are fixed and known, the choice

 leads to the well-known maximum likelihood estimator 
of the location. Another particular choice of function ψ, namely, ψ(x) = x, 
leads to the standard nonrobust estimation, optimal in the least squares (LS) 
sense. In this case, the solution of the estimation equation (4.61) leads to the 
sample mean. As it is well known, the performance of the sample mean as an 
estimator of location degrades substantially in the presence of abnormally large 
observations, and even a single outlier can significantly change the value of the 
estimate, which manifests itself by increasing the bias. In order to reduce this 
effect, a function ψ with a different kind of monotony is needed. According to 
[45], the optimal choice of the robustifying function ψ is based on the analysis 
of the asymptotic variance of the estimator. It can be shown that the asymptotic 
variance of an M-estimator defined by (4.61) at a distribution F from the class 
(4.60) is given by [43]:

 which means that the M-

Huber showed that the density of the least favorable distribution mini­
mizing the Fisher information over the class Fε with unity variance of the cen­

The minimax robustification presented above might not be very effective 
when highly impulsive noise is present. In the case of high impulsivity better 
results are obtained using a non-monotone robustifying function, decreasing or 
even having zero values for large values of the input signal. 
In the CDMA communication systems to improve the multiuser detec­
tion [46], a new class of robustifying functions called α-functions has been 
proposed:

It can be noted that for large values of the argument, ψα(x) decreases 
exponentially so such a robustification function should be very effective for 
impulsive noise suppression. To make use of the function, an appropriate value 
of the parameter α has to be chosen. The way of choosing this value, presented 
in [46], is based on comparing the asymptotic variance of the estimation error 
corresponding to α-function with that of minimax robustification. Both vari­
ances are determined by (4.64) with an appropriate choice of the robustifying 
function ψ. These variances will be denoted as Vα(ε, κ) and VH(ε, κ) for the 
α-function (4.67) and the Huber minimax function (4.65), respectively. In [46] 
the distance measured was defined as:

where integration intervals are selected so as to cover the range of variation of 
the contamination noise parameters that are of interest to us. It is shown in [46] 
that DH(a) has a unique minimum. For a reasonable range of the contamina­
tion noise parameters, that is, 0.01 ≤ ε ≤ 0.1 and 1 ≤ κ ≤ 100, the minimum is 
achieved at α = 0.15.

In the classical problem of the robust estimation of a location parameter, 
the minimax optimality is very often given up in order to obtain an estimator 
with better performance for outliers with very large magnitudes. In this case, 
a non-monotone function ψ, vanishing outside some interval around zero is 
preferred. Among many functions with this feature [43], the Tukey bisquare 
function (also called the biweight function) is very popular in literature. It has 
the following form:

In the estimation problem of a location parameter, the tuning constant 
a is chosen to ensure the desired level of asymptotic efficiency in the Gaussian 
case. For example, a = 4.68 guarantees 95% of maximal asymptotic efficiency 
achieved in the Gaussian case by a linear estimator. 
After the theoretical consideration it is time to show the shape of the 
robustifying functions. Figure 4.40 presents the robustifying functions defined 
by (4.68), (4.89), and (4.71) for a selected value of parameters. In the case of 
functions ψh(x) described by (4.68) and ψbs(x) described by (4.71), the increase 
of characteristic parameters k and a causes the linear or pseudo-linear region of 
the functions to widen. The behavior of the ψα(x) function given by (4.89) is 
the opposite; an increase of α narrows the pseudo-linear region of the function. 
For that reason, the reciprocal of α is used in further experiments for scaling 
the x-axis.
The presented functions have been developed for real signals. In the case 
of noise radars all signals are complex signals after converting to the baseband, 
and the theory presented above is not directly applicable. However, it can be 
observed [47–51] that even a simple and nonoptimal method of robustification 
can improve the radar detection in the case of heavy tail distributed noise. So 
for noise radar robustification it is assumed that the robustification function 
is applied to the magnitude of the received signal xR(t), while the phase of the 
signal is preserved:

Afterwards a nonlinear processing signal is passed to the correlation pro­
cessing described by (3.7). The quality measure of the robustification is the S/N 
after the correlation procedure, calculated as the ratio of the maximum peak to 
the mean noise floor [47]. The properties of robustification are related to two 
main parameters: the shape (or shape parameter) of the robustifying function 

128 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
and the parameter (or power) of input noise. In real situations noise parameters 
are usually unknown, but can easily be measured (e.g., input noise power). As a 
result, the robustifying function parameter can be modified (or rather normal­
ized) accordingly to the measured noise power. The research on robust detection 
in noise radar presented by the author in [47, 48] shows that the normaliza­
tion parameter should be proportional to the amplitude of the central Gaussian 
component (the first component in (4.60)) of the input noise. The value of the 
parameter can be determined in various ways. One of the simplest choices, well 
fitted to the Gaussian case, is the standard deviation (or the power):

However, the use of the standard deviation of the input signal for signal 
normalization may lead to unexpectedly high results, as the standard deviation 
will change significantly with varying parameters of the impulsive component 
of the noise. For this reason, additional normalizing methods will be presented, 
which are more robust to parameter changes. Among many possibilities, robust 
estimators will be shown. The first is the mean value of the absolute value of 
the signal:

That value can easily be calculated, while the summation is relatively 
cheap from a numerical point of view. The problem is that we usually have real 
(I) and imaginary (Q) parts of the received signal. Further investigation shows 
that it is possible to sum the absolute values of the I Q components instead of 
summing the absolute values of the signal.
The second candidate for the robust estimator is the exponent of the

and the effective amplitude of contamination κ. The first problem is knowing 
how robust the estimators (4.73) through (4.76) of the uncontaminated noise 
component are. The results provided by the estimators mentioned above versus 
noise parameters ε and κ are presented in Figures 4.41 and 4.42. It can be seen 
that increasing noise impulsiveness by increasing e or k causes a significant in­
crease of the estimator P0 based on signal variance. The estimator based on the 
mean amplitude P1 is less sensitive to contamination, but still its value changes 
about four times in the presented parameter range. Much better results can be 
obtained with an estimator based on the geometrical mean amplitude P2 (mean 
log value of noise). It varies below two times and only for a very high prob­
ability of contamination (above 20%). The estimator based on the median of 
the input amplitude P3 remains fairly constant versus ε and κ but it is a more 
costly estimator. However, several iterative algorithms exist which are based on 
a simple comparison and summation, and can estimate the median of long 
signal vectors with sufficient accuracy. The computational complexity of those 
algorithms is of the order of N rather than NlogN (required by a fast sorting 
algorithm) and does not need to remember the whole signal vector. 
To show the importance of the problem, a simple calculation of the ex­
pected signal losses can be made. In the classical Gaussian case the S/N after 
correlation processing is improved by the time-bandwidth product. In the con­

130

tamination case the signal level after correlation is unchanged, but the noise 
level is increased from the original noise level PN to the value:

The example of a signal to noise losses, normalized to an S/N value with­
out contamination is presented in Figure 4.43. As it can be seen, up to 20-dB 
losses can be expected for 10% of a strong contamination. In most cases ex­
pected losses will be between 2 and 10 dB. 
The robustification function presented in Figure 4.40 can be divided into 
two major classes. To the first class belong all the functions that resulted in zero­
ing the outlier [as described by (4.69) and (4.71)]. If the zeroing is perfect, then 
each outliers will be substituted by the zero value, canceling both the outlier 
and the signal. The effective integration time is in this case reduced by the fac­
tor 1-ε and the integration losses (in decibels) can be estimated as:

(4.78)
To the second class of the robustification function belong all functions 
that result in the saturating of the outlier value at the selected threshold. Satura­
tion limits the outlier power but attenuates significantly the signal. In a sim­
plified consideration, we can assume that in all saturated samples the signal is 
completely cut out, and the noise remains at the threshold value. Setting the 
threshold level close to the mean value of the noise, we can estimate that the 
losses will be two to three times higher than predicted by (4.78). The value of

the predicted losses versus the contamination intensity ε for both classes of ro­
bustifying functions is plotted in Figure 4.44. 
As it is shown in Figure 4.44, the losses for 10% of the contamination are 
predicted at the 0.5-dB level for the first class of robustification functions (cut­
ting the outliers) and to 1.5 dB for the second class of robustification functions 
(saturation of outlier). The analyses presented above are based on very high 
simplification, so more detailed analyses are required to verify their properties 
for a different level of contamination.
The proposed robust detection of weak echoes in the noise radar was 
verified with Monte Carlo simulations. The transmitted signal envelope was 
simulated as complex Gaussian noise. The received signal after conversion to 
the baseband was modeled as the sum of the delayed and Doppler shifted copy 
of the transmitted signal (target echo model) and the external noise. The input 
noise containing impulse distortion was modeled as the ε-contaminated white 
complex noise. The input Gaussian noise component was generated in the same 
manner as the transmitted signal, and the impulse noise component was mod­
elled by multiplying randomly selected noise samples (with probability ε) by 
the factor κ. The input S/N was set to −12 dB for ε = 0 (pure Gaussian input 
noise) to minimize the influence of the echo signal on the input noise probabil­
ity density function. This assumption is very realistic since the strongest echoes 
can be easily detected and removed without robustification. After the cleaning 
operation, the S/N is usually much lower than 0 dB.

The effectiveness of three previously described robustification functions 
are shown in Figure 4.45. The simulated impulsive noise had the following 
parameters: κ = 100 and ε = 0.1. The dash-dotted line shows the S/N level for 
ε-contaminated noise without any robustification. The solid line shows the S/N 
level obtained for Gaussian noise with no robustifying function. The detection 
losses without robustification are at the level of 10 dB, which is in agreement 
with (4.78) (see Figure 4.43). 
It can be seen that by choosing the characteristic parameter of a function 
appropriately, a performance comparable to the Gaussian case can be obtained 
(the worst results were obtained for the Huber function ψh with a 1.5-dB loss 
in comparison to the Gaussian case, which again is in good agreement with the 
prediction shown in Figure 4.44). The result was achieved for the two other 
robustification functions which canceled the outlier, but the losses are within 1 
dB. This means that the prediction described by (4.78) is slightly too optimistic 
and the losses are almost twice higher than predicted. This is because in the 
derivation of (4.78) the assumption of the perfect cancellation of outliers was 
taken, while in practice two effects occur: the outliers are not fully canceled 
and the high values of the signal are attenuated, except for the robustification 
function. 
In the example presented, a single set of parameters κ and ε was selected. 
In the practical case it would be advantageous to find such a set of parameters

functions.

that could give satisfying results for all possible (expected) values of κ and ε. 
The alternative approach would lead to the estimation of the values of κ and 
ε and the choosing of the appropriate robustifyiung parameter. As the optimal 
S/N values after correlation are almost the same for the robustification func­
tions ψα(x) and ψbs(x), and the function ψα(x) is less sensitive to an improper 
choice of the robustification parameter than function ψbs(x), the function ψα(x) 
was chosen for further presentation.
As mentioned before, the parameter of the robustifying function is strong­
ly related to the choice of the normalising parameter P. Also stated before, the 
classical power estimator based on the standard deviation of the input signal 
may not be the best one since it will vary with changes in the noise characteris­
tics. As a result, the optimal value of the parameter α changes significantly with 
the change of the input noise parameters ε and κ. This situation is illustrated 
in Figures 4.46 and 4.47, showing the S/N versus α for different ε and κ. For 
higher impulsiveness, the optimal value of 1/α is smaller and it is not possible 
to choose a single value of α that will significantly improve detection for all 
possible values of ε and .
The situation is much better when the robust estimator of noise power 
based on the median value of the input noise amplitude is selected, as discussed 
before. Figures 4.48 and 4.49 show the S/N versus α parameter for different 
ε and κ in the case where the robust median-based parameter P3 is used for 
normalization. The curves have approximately the same behaviour, irrespective

of the impulsiveness of the noise. This allows us to choose one value of α, in 
this example equal to 0.2 (1/α = 5), which yields acceptable results for a wide

range of variations of the impulsiveness of the noise. Detection losses in the case 
of pure Gaussian noise are smaller than 0.3 dB and the difference between the 
optimal value of S/N and the actual S/N value for any particular values of the ε 
and κ parameters does not exceed 1 dB. It is possible to further reduce the losses 
for the Gaussian noise by decreasing the α parameter to 0.1, but the losses for a 
high value of ε will increase in that case.
The robustification requires very low input signal to noise ratio, much 
lower than 0 dB (usually in the range of -35 to -10 dB). If the input signal to 
noise level is much higher (above 0 dB), then the dominant component will be 
echo, not noise, but after classical correlation the signal-to-noise level will be 
higher than the time bandwidth product, usually above 50 dB. In this case even 
20-dB losses will not significantly influence the detection process. 
The question is how to operate in an environment where both strong 
(such as ground clutter and nearby targets) and weak (far) targets exist simulta­
neously. The proposed processing structure is presented in Figure 4.50.
The signal received by the receiving antenna, after amplification and con­
version to the baseband, is passed to the adaptive ground clutter canceler, where 
all stationary or low-speed components are removed. The clutter-free signal is 
then passed to the range-Doppler correlator, where all strong targets are de­
tected and their parameters like amplitude, range, range velocity, and accelera­
tion are estimated. In having those estimates, it is possible to pass the signal to 
a strong echo canceler, where the signal is CLEANed of all strong components. 
Figure 4.49  S/N versus parameter α with normalization using P3 for different κ (ε = 0.1).

137
After this  CLEANing stage, the signal consists only of thermal noise, interfer­
ences, and weak echoes buried in the noise. Such a signal is being robustified 
using a nonlinear transform and passed to the final range-Doppler correlator 
where the weak targets are detected and their parameters are estimated. All ex­
tracted targets (plots) are then passed to the plot combiner and further on to a 
data processing unit (not shown in the picture) where final data association and 
target tracking is performed.
To simplify the picture, the reference signal paths are not plotted, but it is 
obvious that in most processing parts a reference signal is used for  CLEANing 
and for correlation.
Some more remarks on such combined processing are presented in [47–
49] where as stated the signal CLEANing is used prior to robustification. The 
result of applying the robustification function in the case of heavy ground clut­
ter is presented in Figure 4.51. The clutter power was approximately 25 dB 
above the noise level and 50 dB above the moving target echo power level. The 
results obtained in both cases (with and without clutter, as depicted in Figures 
4.51 and 4.48, respectively), are almost identical. This is proof that the robus­
tifying procedure can also be successful in the case of heavy clutter and strong 
targets. 
The performance of the noise radar based on a linear correlator can drop 
dramatically with impulse noise and interferences. In a classical pulse radar, im­
pulse interferences, which are a potential source of false detections, are canceled

by nonlinear procedures such as binary integration. In a noise radar, impulse 
interferences do not produce false targets but increase the noise floor and thus 
decrease the radar sensitivity. The presented procedure of noise radar robustifi­
cation restores the sensitivity of noise radar almost to the level where no non-
Gaussian interferences are present, at the cost of no more than 0.5-dB losses 
for the Gaussian case and no more than 1-dB losses in the non-Gaussian case. 
The presented procedure shows its high performance in the presence of heavy 
clutter or strong echoes, which have to be removed prior to nonlinear signal 
transformation.

Multistatic Noise Radar
The concept of noise radar can be used in both the monostatic and the bistatic 
configuration. In the monostatic configuration, as stated in Chapters 3 and 4, 
the transmitting and receiving antennas are placed at the same point. Theoreti­
cally, it is possible to use the same antenna for both transmission and reception, 
but due to very high crosstalk between the transmitting and receiving chan­
nels, such a configuration in a continuous-wave radar is used very rarely. Much 
more popular is the configuration with two vertically or horizontally stacked 
antennas. Although there is some spatial separation between the antennas, such 
a configuration is defined as monostatic1. To obtain much smaller crosstalk 
between the transmitting and the receiving antenna, it is possible to place those 
antennas in different locations, which leads to the bistatic configuration. Spatial 
separation of antennas has several advantages. In addition to good electromag­
netic separation, it is possible to have much larger surveillance volume than in 
the monostatic case and to exploit high bistatic reflectivity of many man-made 
objects [1] as well as mitigate the problem of detection of stealth targets [2]. 
The radar cross-section of the target rises significantly when the transmit an­
tenna, receive antenna and the target are almost collinear [3–7]. In this case the 
target is in the forward scattering region and the radar cross-section of the target 
can be 20–40 dB higher than it is in the monostatic case. Besides many advan­
tages, the bistatic configuration also has some drawbacks. In the area where 
the forward scattering effect exists, both the range and the Doppler resolution 
are significantly degraded. To perform correlation processing, it is necessary to 
acquire the reference signal. This can be performed by using a separate refer­
ence antenna placed at the receiving site, by using a reference antenna placed 
1.	 According to the IEEE definition, bistatic radar is a radar using antennas for transmission and 
reception at sufficiently different locations so that the angles or ranges from those locations to 
the target are significantly different.

144 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
near the transmitter, or by sending the reference signal (usually in the digital 
form) using a dedicated transmission channel. In the first case, when a refer­
ence signal is received by the reference antenna placed at the receiver site, there 
usually exists a blind zone in the direction of the transmitter where target detec­
tion is almost impossible in spite of the large increase in target cross section. To 
overcome this drawback, it is possible to extend the radar configuration from 
bistatic to multistatic, adding additional transmitting and receiving sites. In the 
multistatic configuration it is possible to obtain good range and Doppler reso­
lution in the whole surveillance space and avoid or minimize blind zones, also 
increasing the detection probability [8]. 
5.1  Bistatic Configuration
The classical bistatic configuration is presented in Figure 5.1. The sector or 
omnidirectional transmitter illuminates the surveillance space and the receiver 
site. The bistatic receiver consists of two channels. The first, the surveillance (or 
measurement) channel, receives the echoes from moving targets. The second, 
the reference channel, receives the direct signal required for correlation process­
ing and clutter rejection.
The spatial separation of the transmitter and receiver has several advan­
tages. The first significant advantage is the possibility of better attenuation of 
the direct signal, so the required receiver dynamic range can be much smaller. 
Assuming that there is a direct line of sight between the transmitting and receiv­
ing (measurement t) antennas, then the power PD of the direct signal received 
by the measurement antenna can be described by the formula:

where PT is the transmitted power, GTD is the transmitted antenna gain in the 
direction of the receiver, GRD is the receiver antenna gain in the direction of the 
transmitter, R0 is the distance between the transmitter and receiver, and λ is the 
wavelength. For example, for a bistatic X-band radar with a 3-dB transmitting 
gain, a 20-dB receiving gain towards the transmitter, and 10 km of distance 
between the transmitter and the receiver, the direct signal attenuation is at the 
level of 110 dB. This is much more than what can be achieved in the monos­
tatic configuration. The minimal required receiver dynamic range depends on 
the direct received power (5.1) and thermal receiver noise (2.5), and for the 
classical bistatic configuration it can be predicted by the equation:

Equation (5.2) does not take into consideration the signals reflected from 
targets close to the receiver, so the required receiver dynamic range can be slight­
ly higher than predicted by (5.2). For the configuration mentioned above with 
the bandwidth B = 1 MHz and transmitted power PT = 10 kW, the minimal 
required dynamic range is almost 80 dB. The received direct power versus the 
distance between the transmitter and receiver for the example mentioned above 
(10-kW transmitter, 1-MHz bandwidth, 3-dB transmitting antenna gain, and 
20-dB receiving antenna gain) is depicted in Figure 5.2.
A further decrease of direct power may be accomplished by increasing the 
distance between the antennas, forming the receiver antenna radiation pattern 
with null at the direction of the transmitter or shielding/shadowing the receiv­
ing antenna. One of the possible configurations of a bistatic noise radar with 
the measurement antenna placed in a shadow region (behind the mountains as 
described in [9]) is presented in Figure 5.4. In such a case the reference antenna 
has to be placed in another location, with direct illumination of the transmitter, 
or it is necessary to acquire the direct signal in a different way (e.g., by using a 
separate data channel between the transmitter and the receiver).
The bistatic detection range can be predicted in a very similar manner 
as described in Section 3.2. In the monostatic case the received power can be 
predicted by formula (3.9). In the bistatic case the distance between the target 
and transmitter R1 is usually different from the distance between the target and 
receiver R2, and the power received by the measurement antenna can be pre­
dicted by the formula [1]:

In this case the bistatic range has two components: target-transmitter dis­
tance and target-receiver distance. For a monostatic case the coverage diagram 
is in the form of a circle with the radius Rmax. For a bistatic case the coverage 
diagram forms the Cassini oval, presented in Figure 5.5.
The theoretical coverage can be achieved only in the second bistatic con­
figuration presented in Figure 5.4, when the direct signal cancellation is not re­
quired. However, in the first configuration, shown in Figure 5.1, it is necessary 
Figure 5.4  Bistatic configuration of a noise radar without direct illumination of the receiving 
(measurement ) antenna.

148 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
to cancel that signal. The reference antenna, apart from the direct signal, also 
receives the target echo. If the target is placed on the transmitter-receiver line, 
or close to it, then the direct signal cancellation procedure (or clutter cancella­
tion procedure) will also cancel this target echo. The echoes of all targets present 
in the direct signal antenna beamwidth will be attenuated, and the attenuation 
factor will depend on the Gref /(Gref – GrefT ) ratio, where Gref is the reference 
antenna gain towards the transmitter and GrefT is the reference antenna gain 
towards the target. An example bistatic noise radar coverage diagram after the 
direct signal cancellation procedure is presented in Figure 5.6 [11, 12]. An an­
tenna pattern with a main beamwidth of about 40° has been assumed in the 
experiment.
As one can see from Figure 5.6, it is not possible to detect the target in the 
direction of the transmitter and in the zone of a few degrees around this direc­
tion. The result of direct signal cancellation is the creation of a radar blind zone. 
The method for blind zone reduction is discussed in Section 5.1.
As in the case of the monostatic radar, the presence of strong echoes origi­
nating from the nearby target or ground clutter will reduce the detection range 
for simple correlation processing. The nearby point target of effective radar 
cross-section S1 will produce an echo with the power:

If this power is higher than the receiver noise power kTRB, then the echo

The limitation of the coverage diagram due to the presence of a near, 
strong target is presented in Figure 5.7. In the calculation a typical receiving 
antenna pattern with azimuth sidelobes at the level of -25 dB has been taken 
into consideration. The presence of the antenna sidelobes has led to a situation 
in which the detection range was reduced not only in the direction of the strong

procedure. Grayscale: detected RCS [dBsm].

150 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
target, but also in the direction of the maxima of the surveillance antenna sid­
elobes. In the calculations presented, the assumption of the use of a multibeam 
antenna was made.
The masking problem can be eliminated by the use of the strong target 
removal procedure described in Chapter 4. The application of the procedure 
mentioned above can almost restore the original radar coverage [12]. In Figure 
5.8 the noise radar coverage in the presence of a strong nearby echo is presented, 
after the clutter and strong echoes cancellation procedure.
In the case presented the strong echo was not canceled completely, but 
the range reduction in the direction of the strong echo is very small (less than 
20%), and in the other directions the echo-free coverage has been almost fully 
restored.
Correlation processing in the bistatic noise radar is performed in the same 
manner as in the monostatic case, although the range and range velocity of the 
correlation peak in (3.8) now have completely different meanings. In the mo­
nostatic case the range is defined as the distance from the radar to the target. In 
the bistatic case the range is defined as:

Constant range forms a circle in a two-dimensional monostatic radar and 
an ellipse in a bistatic radar as depicted in Figure 5.9.
Similar to the monostatic case, the angular resolution is much smaller 
than the bistatic range resolution and the error gate forms a long ellipse. The 
bistatic range is very small in the zone between the transmitter and receiver (as 
shown in Figures 5.10 and 5.11), so in that area the positioning error can be 
large.
The bistatic velocity is defined as the time derivative of the bistatic range:

On the line between the transmitter and the receiver the bistatic angle is 
equal to 180°, so the maximum bistatic velocity is zero, and all targets on that 
line will be treated as zero-Doppler clutter. Also, targets near this line will have 
very small bistatic velocity and could be treated as low-Doppler clutter. The 
maximum bistatic velocity for a 100 m/s target is plotted in Figure 5.13.
5.2  Multistatic Configuration
The bistatic configuration, described in the previous section, has several dis­
advantages. It is impossible to detect a target in the blind zone between the 
transmitter and the receiver due to the presence of several effects. In the blind 
zone the target echo is attenuated significantly by the direct signal and clutter 
removal procedure. The maximum bistatic velocity and bistatic range in the 
blind zone are very close to zero, so even if it is not canceled in the process of 
direct signal cancellation, the target will be treated as low-Doppler near clutter. 
To overcome this problem, to make the detection less sensitive to interfer­
ence, to increase the positioning accuracy, and to increase the target update rate, 
the multistatic configuration should be used. The multistatic configuration

Multistatic Noise Radar

presented in Figure 5.14 may consist of one transmitter and a multiple receiver, 
one receiver and multiple transmitters, and a net of multiple receivers and mul­
tiple transmitters [8, 13]. 
In the case of multiple transmitters, it is possible to allocate a different 
carrier frequency to different transmitters or work on a single carrier frequency. 
The use of a single frequency simplifies the receiver (only one receiving fre­
quency channel is needed), but makes the detection procedure more complex. 
It also complicates the direct signal and clutter cancellation procedure. The 
single frequency net transmitters can emit independent noise signals or use the 
same noise signal in each transmitter. In this case it is necessary to synchronize 
all the transmitters (e.g., using GPS technology) and transmit the noise signal 
to all transmitting and receiving nodes. In a synchronous noise radar network 
we may simply cancel the direct signal as well as the ground clutter using the 
procedure described in Chapter 4, but each target will generate multiple echoes 
which must be combined with tracks during the target tracking procedure. 
The use of multistatic configuration will increase the accuracy of target po­
sitioning. The measurement error area for each transmitter-receiver pair forms a 
long ellipsoid. Having several independent measurements originating from dif­
ferent transmitter-receiver pairs, it is possible to obtain a much higher pointing 
accuracy, as depicted in Figure 5.15. The use of two transmitter-receiver pairs 
allows us to precisely localize the target in two-dimensional space, while the use 
of three transmitter-receiver pairs allows for three-dimensional pointing and 
tracking [8, 14–16]. A higher number of transmitter-receiver pairs will increase 
the pointing accuracy [15].
Multistatic operation increases the likelihood of target detection and de­
creases the blind zone. In Figure 5.16 the bistatic coverage for a multistatic 
noise radar with three transmitters and one receiver is presented. The coverage

in this figure is defined as the area where the target with a given radar cross sec­
tion can be detected. As a result, multistatic radar coverage defined in this way 
is the logical (or rather geometrical) sum of the coverage of each transmitter-
receiver pair. 
Precision two-dimensional tracking can be performed in the area where 
a target is detected using signals from at least two transmitters. The precision 
two-dimensional tracking area presented in Figure 5.17 is smaller than the de­
tection area presented in Figure 5.16, but there are no blind zones between 
the receiver and the transmitters. For precision three-dimensional tracking, it 
is necessary to have simultaneous detection which has originated from at least 
three transmitter-receiver pairs, so the three-dimensional tracking area is much 
smaller (see Figure 5.18), and blind zones towards the transmitters exist. The 
three-dimensional tracking capability exists only when transmitters, receivers, 
and targets are at different Z (high) coordinates. When they all are on this same 
plane, the effect of geometrical dilution of precision (GDOP) exists and ac­
curacy of Z-coordinate is very low. In general, altitude errors are several times 
higher than the errors in the horizontal coordinates and depend on the altitude 
of the target. Z-coordinate accuracy of low-flying targets is usually low.

Multistatic coverage can be enlarged by adding an additional receiving 
node. The detection coverage for a multistatic net consisting of two receivers 
and three transmitters is presented in Figure 5.19. In Figure 5.20 the precision 
two-dimensional tracking area is presented, and in Figure 5.21 the precision 
three-dimensional tracking area is shown. In the presented configuration each 
target can be detected by six transmitter-receiver pairs, although only three are 
needed for precision tracking, so there are no blind zones towards receivers even 
for the precision three-dimensional tracking. 
5.3  Clutter Cancellation in Multistatic and MIMO Noise Radar
As was discussed in Chapter 4, one of the crucial problems of noise radars is the 
presence of the masking effect [17–21]. Weak targets echoes can be completely 
masked by sidelobes of strong clutter. This problem can be solved by using 
adaptive methods for strong echo cancellation [20, 22]. Current research on 
the noise radar is focused on three main configurations: monostatic, multistatic 
(netted), and multiple input multiple output (MIMO). The concept of netted 
noise radars forming a “fence” along a border has been proposed in [23] and the 
Figure 5.18  Precision three-dimensional tracking area for a multistatic net of noise radars 
consisting of one receiver and three transmitters. Grayscale: tracked RCS (dBsm).

 
Multistatic Noise Radar

noise MIMO radar has been described in [24]. In the case in which all transmit­
ters working in the multistatic configuration are emitting signals using different 
carrier frequencies, and the transmitted bands are separated in frequency, then 
there is no interference between transmitters and the entire signal processing can 
carried on in the same manner as in the monostatic case described in previous 
chapters. However, there are many reasons why it would be practical to transmit 
all signals in the same band. The first reason is the frequency allocation problem 
and limited frequency resources. It is not trivial to allocate separate frequency 
bands for all transmitters, especially when the net consists of many of them and 
uses wideband signals (such as 100 MHz or more). The second is the need of 
many receiving channels. In a separate frequency multistatic radar network, it 
is necessary to add to each reviving antenna the number of receivers equal to 
the number of transmitters. In the case of multiuse of the selected single band, 
all transmitters use the same (or very similar) carrier frequency using different 
or the same noise modulation. The use of the same noise modulation leads to a 
concept very similar to a single-frequency network used in commercial radio or 
TV broadcasting (DAB, DVB-T). All transmitters must be synchronized (e.g., 
Figure 5.19  Coverage of a multistatic net of noise radars consisting of two receivers and 
three transmitters. Grayscale: detected RCS (dBsm).

160 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
by GPS or cable synchronization) and transmit the signal of the same carrier 
frequency and the same modulation.
Although all transmissions have the same contents and differ only in time 
delay, all methods for signal processing described in Chapters 3 and 4 can be 
used. 
An alternative solution is to transmit independent noise waveforms from 
each transmitter using the same frequency band. In theory the transmitted 
noise signals are orthogonal to each other, and due to this orthogonality be­
tween components, the signal processing can be relatively simple. The orthogo­
nal components can be removed consecutively (one after another). However, 
due to limited integration time all transmitted signals are not fully orthogonal 
and an additional effort has to be made to remove the unwanted signal compo­
nents to achieve long-range detection of the weak targets. 
Let us consider the multistatic noise radar net consisting of K transmit­
ters and L receivers, located in different positions. The transmitters send inde­
pendent noise signals xk(T ) in the same frequency band. Each of the receivers, 
apart from the echo signal, can receive (e.g., using dedicated data links or highly 
directive antennas) the reference signals x1(T ) ... xK(T ) sent by all transmitters.

The signal xk(T ) correlates only with the corresponding term yk,l (T ) of 
the signal yl (T ). However, other components of signals yl (T ) originating from 
other transmitters act as additional noise sources. As a result, the noise floor of 
the range-Doppler surface is raised up and this leads to detection losses. In the 
case of heavy noise clutter, moving targets can be completely masked by the 
sidelobes of the clutter echoes. 
Single-channel ground clutter can be removed using the algorithms de­
scribed in Chapter 4, but those algorithms have been developed under the as­
sumption that there is a single source of illumination. However, it is relatively

simple to extend the CLEAN algorithm based on a lattice filter structure (as 
presented in Figure 5.23) to the vector form.
As in the previous case, the lattice structure is used for clutter space or­
thogonalization and the lower part of the filter is used for the removal of or­
thogonal clutter components from the received signal.
The multichannel lattice prediction algorithm can be described by for­
mulas (5.15) through (5.25) [25]. The forward prediction error fm(n) is K × 1

The targets were simulated by adding time-delayed and Doppler shifted ver­
sions of the transmitted signal to the received signal. The sampling frequency 
was equal to 200 kHz and the length of the signal blocks was equal to 32,768. 
The range-Doppler surfaces were calculated using formula (5.14). To reduce 
the Doppler sidelobes a Hamming window was applied to the signals before 
correlation. 
The simulated scenario is presented in Figure 5.22. Three transmitters 
and one receiver were simulated. Ten stationary targets of a different radar cross 
section and three moving targets were simulated in the presented example. Fig­
ure 5.24 presents the result of the correlation of the signal transmitted by the 
first transmitter x1(T ) with the received signal y1(T ). The values of the correla­
tion were clipped at the mean noise floor level. In the figure, only ground clut­
ter at zero Doppler frequency is visible. The noise floor level is approximately 
at 30 dB (arbitrary scale). As can be seen in Figure 5.24, no moving targets are 
visible, as they are masked by the ground clutter echoes that have originated 
from all transmitters.
The effect of the zero Doppler clutter removal procedure using only the 
signal from the first transmitter x1(T ) is presented in Figure 5.25. The single-
channel lattice filter in this example completely removed the ground echoes that 
originated from the first transmitter, so no ground clutter echoes are visible.

However, the clutter components that originated from the other transmitters 
mask all moving targets’ echoes, and only the noise floor at the level of 28 dB is 
visible. The first echo cancellation reduces the noise floor by only 2 dB.
In the consecutive steps, a single-channel lattice filter was used to remove 
signals originating from consecutive transmitters separately. This led to further 
reduction of the noise floor to the level of −5 dB. This means that the noise 
floor was reduced in total by 35 dB. The range-Doppler plane calculated after 
such a clutter cancellation procedure is presented in Figure 5.26. Due to the 
lack of orthogonality between the transmitted signals, the ground clutter com­
ponents have not been removed completely, but the 35-dB reduction in the 
noise floor was sufficient to reveal the moving targets’ echoes.
The use of the multichannel lattice filter described by formulas (5.15) 
through (5.25) removed the ground clutter components completely, as depicted 
in Figure 5.27. In the presented case the noise floor was reduced by an addi­
tional 19 dB to the level of −24 dB. The simulated moving targets are clearly 
visible above the noise floor.
As shown in Figures 5.24 through 5.27, the use of the single-channel 
ground clutter cancellation procedure does not CLEAN the received signal 
sufficiently, while vector CLEANing provides satisfying results. In Figure 5.28 
the noise floor level versus the number of transmitters is depicted for different

clutter cancellation methods. The simulated received signal consists of several 
strong ground clutter components and the receiver noise is 40 dB below the 
level of the useful signals. It can be observed that a joint (vector) cancellation 
method using a multidimensional lattice filter canceled all ground clutter, and 
the noise floor level is independent of the number of transmitters. This fixed 
noise floor level results from the noise added to the signal. Independent can­
cellation of each channel causes the noise floor to rise by several decibels in 
comparison to the multidimensional lattice method. When the clutter removal 
method is not used, the noise floor level increases steadily as a result of an in­
crease in the total radiated power (sum of the power radiated by all transmitters) 
of the larger number of transmitters.

Noise Synthetic Aperture Radar
The first application of the classical radar was to detect ships and airplanes. 
After a few years of development, it was found that radar could also be used for 
imaging purposes. One of the first imaging applications was bombsight, a de­
vice used in bomber aircraft to help in finding the optimal time instant to drop 
bombs. Further developments led to coherent imaging techniques: Doppler 
beam sharpening (DBS) [1–4] and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) [5–8]. For a 
long time detailed pictures of the Earth’s surface, taken from airplanes and satel­
lites, have been used for monitoring natural terrestrial phenomena and human 
activities. In civil applications these pictures are used for map creation, biomass 
calculation, flood control, pollution control, and others. In military applica­
tions detailed pictures are used most frequently for intelligence, the control of 
army movement, target recognition, identification of military installations, and 
others. Pictures taken in the visible light spectrum, as well as in near infrared 
or ultraviolet, are susceptible to atmospheric conditions and, of course, to the 
Sun’s illumination. The search for sensors that are able to operate day and night 
in all weather conditions has led to the development of airborne and spaceborne 
SAR technology. This technology makes it possible to produce medium- and 
high-resolution images of an area of interest. The principle of SAR technology 
is described in detail in [5–8]. Therefore, in this chapter the SAR principles are 
described only briefly. 
The range resolution of a conventional radar depends on the transmitted 
signal bandwidth, and can reach values from 1 cm to 100m. The cross-range 
resolution depends on the width of the antenna main beam, and is usually 
much worse (20 to 1,000m at a 10-km distance). To increase the cross-range 
resolution of the classical radar, it is necessary to build extremely large (long) 
antennas. Instead of constructing a very long physical antenna, it is possible 
to process the signals collected during the flight over a selected path and form 

172 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
a very long synthetic antenna aperture. The spatial resolution of an SA image 
depends on the bandwidth of the transmitted signal (in the range dimension) 
and the size of the antenna aperture (in the cross-range dimension). The theo­
retical cross-range resolution limit of SAR is equal to half of the real antenna 
aperture length and is independent of the range to the target. To increase the 
image resolution, it is necessary to decrease the real antenna size; however, the 
use of small antennas leads to several technical problems. The transmitted sig­
nal power must be high enough to guarantee the detection and proper imaging 
of small targets at long distances. Due to a wide beam of the real antenna, the 
Doppler frequency spectrum of the ground returns is also wide (especially in 
the case of high platform velocity) and high pulse repetition frequencies are re­
quired. This effect decreases the maximum unambiguous range and thus limits 
the width of the observation strip.
The designers of SAR systems are looking for new technologies and pro­
cessing algorithms that could overcome limitations inherent to classical SAR 
technology and lead to advanced SAR radars with better spatial resolution and 
wider observed areas. One of the technologies that can be used for this purpose 
is noise radar technology. In Section 6.2 the algorithm of noise SAR processing 
is presented, and in Section 6.3 the results of the image enhancement algorithm 
are shown. 
6.1  Fundamentals of Classical SAR Processing
For a long time engineers looked for a method of obtaining high-quality im­
ages using radars installed on board an airplane. The classical surveillance radar 
with a short sounding pulse gave a good range resolution (usually 10–100m), 
while the cross-range (azimuth) resolution was much worse and depended on 
the range from the radar to the imaged area. For narrow-beam radars cross-
range resolution is a product of range and antenna beamwidth. For a 20-mrad 
(1.10) antenna beam, the cross-range resolution at a distance of 10 km is equal 
to 200m, and for the distance 100 km it is 2 km. The increase of cross-range 
resolution in the classical radar may be achieved by decreasing the antenna 
beamwidth. The theoretical width of an antenna beam is approximately equal 
to the wavelength divided by antenna length (λ/La), so to improve the cross-
range resolution, it is possible to use either a longer antenna (in the along-track 
dimension) or shorter waves. The usage of very short waves is limited by the 
atmospheric attenuation effect, especially in the presence of high humidity, fog, 
or clouds. Because of this limitation the L-, C-, S-, X-, and K-bands are used 
in airborne radars. The length of the radar antenna is limited by the size of the 
airplane. In the case of surveillance radars the antenna length is limited by the 
width of the airplane. In a small airplane it is possible to install a rotating an­

 
Noise Synthetic Aperture Radar

tenna with length of between 0.5 to 2m. For example, a 1.5m antenna working 
in the X-band has a beamwidth of 20 mrad. As stated before, the cross-range 
resolution of a radar equipped with such an antenna is moderate. A longer 
antenna may be installed only as a fixed antenna on the side of an airplane. In 
such a case the length of an airplane limits the antenna length. Additional an­
tenna length limitations may have their origin in antenna vibration and thermal 
deformation. The typical antenna length used in side-looking antenna radars is 
4 to 10m. An X-band 10-m antenna has a beamwidth of 3 mrad, so the cross-
range resolution at a 10km range is equal to 30m and is at the range of 100 km 
to 300m. However, using the side-looking antenna radar, it is possible to create 
a radar image of terrain on the side of the plane trajectory. The image is format­
ted when the plane passes by the imaged area.
Research on a completely new technique for high-resolution radar imag­
ing was carried out in the 1950s and 1960s [9–11]. In 1965, an American sci­
entist named Carl Wiley patented the new concept of the application of Dop­
pler information to increase radar resolution [12]. Since that time, this concept 
has become known as the precursor of the new field of radar technology, the 
synthetic aperture radar [13, 14].
The idea of SAR technology is based on the coherent summation of re­
turn echo signals collected along the straight flight of the airplane. The coherent 
summation of a signal is equivalent to forming a very long “synthetic” antenna 
with a narrow beam. A typical SAR scenario is presented in Figure 6.1.
Let us assume that a synthetic aperture radar installed on a moving plat­
form (airplane or satellite) is equipped with an antenna of real length La (in the 
along-track dimension) and a height of Wa. The main beam of the antenna is

perpendicular to the flight-line and directed at the looking angle γ towards the 
Earth’s surface, as depicted in Figures 6.2 and 6.3.
The 3-dB along-track beamwidth of the antenna is θH ≈ λ/La (assuming 
rectangular antenna illumination), and the cross-track beamwidth is θv ≈ λ/
Wa. The width of the scanning strip γ (assuming a narrow-beam antenna and a 
relatively small-looking angle Wg ) can then be evaluated as:

The ground range resolution is not constant and changes reciprocally 
with the sine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the 
Earth’s surface. For typical look angles (30°–60°) the ground resolution is 1.5 to 
2 times worse than the slant range resolution of the radar. For an angle close to

90°, the range resolution is almost equal to the slant range resolution. However, 
such large angles are not of interest in practice because of a very heavy shadow 
effect, as presented in Figure 6.4.
This effect is very clearly visible in urban and mountain regions. Objects 
located in the shadowed region are invisible in the final SAR image. In some

objects by measuring the length of the SAR shadow.

For surveillance or side-looking airborne radar (SLAR), radars the diam­
eter WH (6.3) is equal to the radar cross-range resolution. The cross-range reso­
lution can be significantly improved by applying signal processing techniques 
to process the received signal further.
The first step for deriving an appropriate processing schema is to predict 
the echo signal which originated from a single scattering point. Let us consider 
a single scatterer placed on the Earth’s surface at the coordinates (Xo, 0,0), and 
a SAR airplane traveling along the Y-axis at the height H with velocity v. The 
range between the radar and the scattering point is equal to

For narrow antenna beams the higher terms may be neglected, while for

It can be easily seen that the signal frequency is a linear function of time, 
so the signal (6.6) is a classical linear frequency modulated (LFM) chirp signal.

point scatterer signal, equal to:

(6.11)
As the received signal is an LFM, it is possible to apply the classical pulse 
compression technique described in Chapter 2. The focused image will be pro­
duced by the matched filtering of the received signal in the cross-range di­
mension (2.13). It is worth noting that the pulse response of the compression 
filter is different for different ranges, while the observation time (6.8) depends 
linearly on the range to the scattering center and the bandwidth (6.11) is range 
independent.
The distance between the radar and the point scatterer is a function of 
time (see (6.4)). The change of that distance produces not only the phase shift 

178

of the received signal, but also the target range migration effect. If the target 
range migration, described by the formula:

is smaller than half of the radar range resolution (∆R(t) < cτ/2 ), then the target 
echo will remain in the same range gate during the whole observation time. In 
this case the matched filter can be designed as a single-dimension filter work­
ing in the along-track dimension. The maximum range for which the single-
dimension compressing filter can be used for image formation is limited by the 
following inequality:

(6.13)
If the range to the target does not fulfill the constraint (6.13), it is neces­
sary to perform the two-dimensional range-cross-range filtration. The filtration 
in the time domain (or the equivalent spatial one) requires great computational 
power, and a number of much more effective algorithms in the frequency do­
main have been developed [8]. 
The single point scatterer echo after pulse compression (performed either 
in the time or frequency domains) will have (in the time dimension related to 
the cross-range spatial dimension) a pulse width equal to the reciprocal of the 
signal Doppler frequency bandwidth. Thus, the cross-range resolution ∆RSAR of 
the focused SAR is equal to the product of the platform speed and the reciprocal 
of the signal Doppler bandwidth. After a simple calculation, one can obtain the 
final SAR resolution formula [6]:

(6.14)
As stated in (6.14) the cross-range SAR resolution is independent of the 
range to the target and the carrier frequency (wavelength). It depends only 
on the SAR real antenna aperture length. A better resolution, opposed to the 
surveillance radar, can be obtained using a smaller antenna. The decrease of the 
antenna length improves the SAR system cross-range resolution. However, the 
reduction of the SAR antenna size also has some negative effects. It leads to the 
decrease of radar sensitivity, as the antenna gain depends on the antenna size. It 
also increases the required pulse repetition frequency and, as a result, decreases 
the width of the scanned strip.

An example of a focused SAR image created by the author’s team is pre­
sented in Figure 6.5 [15]. The image was created using off-line processing. The 
raw radar data was recorded onboard a moving platform equipped with a radar 
working in the X-band. The flight altitude was 500m and the platform speed 
was 70 m/s. The mean distance between the airplane and the imaged area was 
20 km. The available navigation data (true heading, ground speed) was not 
precise enough, so it was necessary to apply an autofocusing algorithm [16–21]. 
The range resolution of the image is 15m, while the cross-range resolution is 
equal to 0.6m and the antenna size was 1.3m.
The SAR radar detection range can be predicted using (2.8). In the fo­
cused SAR the integration time is equal to the scatterer observation time de­
scribed by (6.8). This time depends on the range. As a result, the energy effec­
tively used for scene illumination is equal to the product of the mean emitting 
power PTm and observation time, and depends on the range:

As follows from (6.17), the SAR detection range is proportional to the 
cube root of the transmitted signal power (rather than the fourth root for a clas­
sical surveillance radar), the cube root of the antenna length (in the along-track 
direction), and the cube root of the square of the antenna width (in the cross-
track direction) and is inversely proportional to the cube root of the platform 
speed and wavelength. Because the integration time in the SAR radar is usually 
much longer than it is for a surveillance radar, the detection range in the SAR 
mode is usually greater than the detection range in surveillance mode for this 
same radar. The time-on-target in a surveillance radar is typically at the level of 
tens of milliseconds. The integration time in a SAR mode, depending on the 
range, antenna beamwidth and the platform speed, is in the range of seconds 
or tens of seconds. As a result, in most radars the integration time in the SAR 
mode time is 102 to 104 times longer than in the surveillance mode, and thus 
the detection range in the SAR mode is 3 to 10 times greater than in the sur­
veillance one. 
To avoid the distortion of the SAR image caused by the aliasing effect, the 
pulse repetition frequency PRF must be higher than the received signal Doppler 
bandwidth:

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
For low velocity, low-resolution (using a long antenna) SAR systems, the 
above constraint gives relatively wide zones of available PRF. However, high-
speed satellite SAR systems can have a very narrow zone for PRF. The increase 
of SAR resolution is then limited by the constraint (6.25), and more sophisti­
cated methods have to be used to overcome this problem. One possible method 
is the use of a multibeam (multisegment) antenna [23]. Another possibility 
is to use continuous noise waveforms, which are free of range and Doppler 
ambiguity. 
For a satellite platform the orbit velocity is strictly connected with the 
orbit heights. Assuming a circular orbit the satellite velocity can be calculated 
from a well-known formula:
	
E
GM
v
R
H
=
+
	
(6.26)
where G is the gravity constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and RE is the 
Earth’s radius. For a typical low SAR orbit (H = 300–700 km), the orbiting 
velocity is close to 8 km/s. The relative speed of the platform is further modified 
by the rotation of the Earth and other phenomena, but in a simplified case it 
can be assumed to be constant. 
The maximum pulse repetition frequency is upper-limited by the width 
of the strip observed by the radar [see constraint (6.24)]. For example, for the 
orbit height of 500 km, antenna beamwidth of 5°, and looking angle of 45°, 
the maximum PRF is limited to approximately 2 kHz. The range resolution of 
the image can be improved by using a high-bandwidth transmitted signal. To 
obtain a 10m ground resolution, the bandwidth of 15 to 25 MHz has to be 
used. Using modern microwave and digital technology, it is possible to generate 
and receive 100-MHz to 2-GHz bandwidth signals, so it is possible to obtain 
a tenths-of-centimeter range resolution in modern SAR systems. It is more dif­
ficult to obtain a high cross-range resolution. The first limitation comes from 
the power budget. To obtain the 1m resolution, a relatively small antenna (2m 
long) has to be used. This type of antenna has relatively low gain, and thus a 
high power of transmitted signal is required. The second limitation comes from 
the received signal Doppler bandwidth, predicted by (6.11). The pulse repeti­
tion frequency is then low-limited by constraint (6.18). For the 1m cross-range 
resolution (2m antenna length), the PRF must be higher than 8 kHz. For the 
10-cm resolution, the PRF must be higher than 80 kHz. In both presented 
examples the two constraints (6.18) and (6.24) exclude themselves mutually, so 
it is not possible to obtain a high cross-range resolution using the classical space 
SAR strip mode. One of the possible solutions to obtain a high cross-range reso­
lution is to decrease the vertical width of the antenna beam. As a consequence,

it would create a very narrow scanning strip. Another solution is to use the spot­
light mode [24–27] instead of the strip mode. In the spotlight mode the SAR 
antenna is directed to one point on the Earth’s surface, changing its position in 
satellite coordinates. This mode of operation leads to the increase of the obser­
vation time, which consequently leads to the increase of the Doppler bandwidth 
of the received echo signal. This is equivalent to an increase of the cross-range 
resolution of the final image. Except for this significant advantage (increase of 
cross-range image resolution), spotlight technology has many disadvantages. It 
requires high-precision mechanical or electronic antenna beam steering. The 
imaged area is relatively small, and signal processing is much more complicated 
as it is usually necessary to take into account the higher-order terms in (6.5) and 
compensate the range walks of the observed points.   
The ambiguity problems discussed above exist only in the classical pulse 
SAR. The random or the quasi random continuous waveforms are free from 
the ambiguity problem [28], and it is possible to design a high-resolution SAR 
using noise radar technology.
6.2  Noise SAR 
One of the alternatives to the classical pulse SAR is the continuous-wave noise 
synthetic aperture radar. This radar simultaneously transmits and receives high-
frequency, narrowband noise, or a noise-like signal [29–35]. Such a signal is 
usually synthesized using noise amplitude or a phase modulation of the carrier 
sine signal. The transmitted signal ambiguity function, in contradiction to the 
pulse signal, has only one main lobe, and thus no ambiguity problem is pres­
ent in this type of radar [28]. The PRF limitations (6.25) are no longer valid 
during the design and manufacturing of SAR, and it is possible to develop a 
spaceborne, high-resolution SAR satellite with a wide scanning strip. 
An example of the SAR scenario is presented in Figure 6.6. The platform 
is moving along the Y-axis at the height H and the speed v. Let us consider a 
single scatterer placed at the position (Xo, Yo, 0) on the surface of the Earth. The 
distance between the electromagnetic center of the SAR antenna and the point 
scatterer can be expressed by the formula:

mitted signal power, antenna gain, and total losses, and w(α) denotes the along-
track antenna angular radiation pattern (gain related to the maximum gain). 
The final SAR image creation in a noise SAR is more complicated than 
with a pulse SAR. Noise SAR processing is based not on the matched filtering 
concept but on correlation signal processing. The final SAR image is calcu­
lated in a correlation processor. This processor correlates the single-dimensional 
input data stream with the signal model (6.28). The correlation procedure is

 is the integration time, depending on the target 
range. 
While the mean distance between the satellite and the target does not 
fulfill the constraint (6.13), the space SAR image formation has to take into 
account the target range migration.
The computational complexity of (6.29) is much higher than the com­
putational complexity of classical pulse SAR processing, but in many cases the 
space SAR image formation is performed off-line in ground stations, so the 
computational power is not the main limitation of the spaceborne SAR system. 
In many practical cases (6.29) can be simplified to decrease the computational 
complexity of the image formation. 
The verification of the presented method was done using simulations. 
Figure 6.7 presents an example of a noise SAR image of a scene with five reflect­
ing points forming a cross. The range and cross-range resolution is equal to the 
resolution of a classical SAR.

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
The raw radar data was created using a Raw Radar Data Simulator [36, 
37]. The magnitude of the radar return is presented in Figure 6.8. It is easy to 
notice that the return signal has the antenna beam modulation and the addi­
tional modulation caused by the interferences between five echo components. 
The raw radar data, in contradiction to the pulse SAR mode, does not have any 
range resolution and the cross-range resolution is equal to the antenna beam­
width at the selected distance. It is worth noting that in this case the signals 
which originated from all the scattering points from different ranges overlap. 
All useful information is hidden in the signal complex spectrum. The mag­
nitude of this spectrum is presented in Figure 6.9. Due to the interferences 
between several echo components the received signal spectrum differs from the 
transmitted signal spectrum presented for reference in Figure 6.10. 
6.3  Adaptive SAR Image Enhancement
The image formation procedure described by (6.29) is not optimal in the case 
where strong reflecting points and weak scatterers are simultaneously present on 
Figure 6.8  Magnitude of the return signal, x-axis – samples.

the scene. In this case the echo originating from a strong scatter can mask the 
weak targets [38], and the overall picture quality is poor. The mean level of the 
echo sidelobes is smaller than the main lobe by the factor Bti, where B is signal 
bandwidth and ti is the integration time. Although the Bti factor in space SAR 
can have a value in the range of 60to 80 dB, the masking problem can appear 
when the dominant scatterer is 30 to 50 dB above the mean scatterer level, 
due to the fact that all scatterers contribute to the total noise floor of the SAR 
image. One possible solution of this problem is the use of the adaptive image-
enhancing algorithm based on the adaptive cancellation of the main scatterers’ 
echoes [38–41] (CLEAN method).
Let us consider that the received signal consists of several strong echoes 
and many weaker ones. In the first step of the algorithm the primary SAR image 
is formatted using a correlation algorithm (6.29). In the second stage the main 
scatterers are detected, and for each one its position ( ˆ

In the fourth algorithm step the weak target SAR image with removed 
strong scatterers is created. This image is formed using signal (6.31) for the 
correlation procedure. Steps 2 to 4 can be repeated until no strong dominant 
scatterers are detected in the SAR image.

In the last stage of the algorithm, the final image is formatted by selecting 
the strongest points detected from the primary image (from the first algorithm 
stage or from the fourth stage if the repetition of the strongest target removal 
is applied) and incorporating them into the image created in the previous stage 
of the algorithm. 
The results of the simulations carried out by the author are presented in 
Figures 6.11 through 6.14. In the first step of the experiment the Raw Radar 
Data Simulator [36, 37] was used to generate a reflected signal from five re­
flecting points, using noise illumination. Each point has the same radar cross 
section (100 m2) and the points form a cross on the X-Y plane. The SAR image 
obtained using correlation processing (6.29) is presented in Figure 6.11. The 
processing noise floor is 40 dB below the strongest echo. The time-bandwidth 
product is equal to 40,000.
This high level of noise floor can mask weak echoes. In the next step of the 
simulation the cross-section of the central scatterer was decreased by 40 dB (to 
0.01 m2). Figure 6.11 presents the SAR image obtained by applying correlation

processing. The high sidelobes of the strong side scatterers mask the central 
scatterer echo, which is not visible in this case (as it is hidden in the strong scat­
terers’ sidelobes).
The results of applying the adaptive SAR image enhancement algorithm 
are presented in Figures 6.13 and 6.14. The SAR image after the dominant 
echoes removal procedure is presented in Figure 6.13. The central scatterer is 
now clearly visible and the residuals of the dominant scatterer echoes are also 
present. The removal procedure attenuates the strongest echoes by 50 to 60 
dB. The final SAR image is presented in Figure 6.14. All scatterers are visible 
and the processing noise floor has been decreased by 40 dB. The procedure 
described can be further applied to the weakest echoes, and a further decrease 
in the noise floor by a few decibels can be achieved.

6.4  Ground-Based SAR Example
In this chapter an example noise SAR demonstrator built in the Radar Technol­
ogy Laboratory of the Warsaw University of Technology is presented. The aim 
of the demonstrator’s construction was to gain experience with the noise and 
pseudo-noise signals applied in SAR technology.
The SAR demonstrator was built using commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) 
elements: an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG, Agilent MXG N5182A), a 
directive coupler, two antennas (Tx and Rx), and a two-channel vector signal 
analyzer (VSA, Agilent 89600). The main components of the noise SAR dem­
onstrator are presented in Figure 6.15.
The arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) can modulate the carrier fre­
quency up to 3 GHz with an arbitrary complex baseband waveform uploaded 
to the internal memory of the instrument. For the purposes of the test, Gauss­
ian white noise was generated using the MATLAB software and downloaded 
to the AWG. The AWG is equipped with two digital-analog converters (for 
Figure 6.13  SAR image after the dominant echoes removal procedure. The central scatterer 
is clearly visible, and the side scatterer echoes significantly attenuated (50–60 dB). x-axis:

I and Q channels) working at a clock frequency of 60 MHz; therefore, the 
theoretical signal bandwidth is almost 60 MHz. The sampling frequency of the 
Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) is about 46 MHz (again I and Q sampling) and 
the maximum signal bandwidth is equal to 36 MHz. This limitation comes 
from antialiasing filters used in the VSA. The VSA is equipped with two chan­
nels. The first VSA channel was used to record the surveillance signal from the 
receive antenna and the second was used to record the reference (transmit) sig­
nal, as shown in Figure 6.16. The signal generated by the AWG generator was 
split into two parts. The main part of the energy was directed to the transmit 
antenna, and a small portion (−20 dB) was used as the reference signal. Both 
channels of the VSA have a common local oscillator (LO) and synchronized 
sampling clock so both signals were recorded coherently. The only custom ele­
ment of the demonstrator hardware was a movable antenna platform, used to 
obtain the movement of the SAR sensor.
The experiment was carried out on a balcony of the Radar Technology 
Radiolocation and Digital Signal Processing Students’ Research Laboratory, 
located about 21m above the ground surface. The imaged area was the space

between the building of the Faculty of Electronics and Information Technol­
ogy, on which the system was placed, and the building of the Faculty of Civil 
Engineering, situated parallel and at a distance of about 110m.
The SAR sensor consisted of two widebeam patch antennas, mounted 
to a platform moving along the balcony’s railing. Accurate positioning of the 
platform was possible due to a computer-controlled step motor. The system 
worked in a stop-and-go mode, which means that each sounding was obtained 
from a stationary sensor position and there was no signal distortion caused by 
Figure 6.16  Block diagram of the noise SAR demonstrator.

the Doppler effect. The carrier frequency was set to 1.920 GHz in a single-
band mode while the center frequency of the stepped-frequency recordings was 
equal to 1.992 GHz. To satisfy the Nyquist theorem and avoid aliasing in the 
azimuth domain, the step between the sensor’s positions had to be smaller than 
λ/4, where λ is the carrier wavelength. As a result the scene was sounded with 
a 3-cm step between sensor positions, which gave 300 soundings positions and 
a 9-m synthetic aperture length. A single recording size was 219 samples, which 
was equivalent to a 10-ms emission. The Rx and Tx antennas were separated 
by 1.3m, and the crosstalk signal between the antennas was about 30 dB higher 
than the strongest scene echoes. The crosstalk between the transmit and receive 
antennas is unwanted from the point of view of the SAR image formation, since 
it raises the correlation sidelobes. For this reason the crosstalk was removed from 
the surveillance channel using the lattice filter described in detail in Chapter 4.
The radar demonstrator was used in two modes: single band and mul­
tiband. In the single band the range resolution was about 5m. As the demon­
strator used a stop-and-go antenna motion, it was possible to divide all signal 
processing into two stages: range compression and cross-range compression. 
The first stage of the stop-and-go SAR processing was range compres­
sion. Due to the random character of the sounding signal, range compression 
was performed for the noise radar by cross-correlating the received signal (after 
CLEANing) with the reference signal. An efficient way to compute the cross-
correlation between the reference and surveillance signals is to make a compu­
tation in the frequency domain described. As a results of the calculation of the 
correlation function, complex range profiles were obtained. The next step is the 
final SAR image formation using a selected method of cross-range compression, 
which in this case was the simplest backpropagation method [8] due to limited 
aperture length. The image is formed by the calculation of a complex pixel value 
for each node of a rectangular grid in the x, y coordinates, where x corresponds 
to azimuth and y corresponds to range. For all nodes of the grid the following 
processing is applied: first, for each antenna position (indexed with n), the bi­
static distance rx,y(n) from the Tx antenna to the grid node (x, y) and back from 
the node to the Rx antenna is computed as:

where y is the fast range coordinate of the node and xTx, xRx, and x are, respec­

antenna position and the node. Then the time delay of the expected echo from 
the node can be calculated for each antenna position as:

where d0 is the constant delay resulting from the system cables length and Ts is 
the effective sampling period.
With this information each range profile can be shifted so that the expect­
ed response of the imaged point is placed exactly in the first column of the pro­
file matrix. This procedure is called range cell migration correction (RCMC) 
and can be performed by the modulation of each profile’s spectrum with
exp(−j𝜃dx,y(n)), which is equivalent to a shift in the time domain by dx,y(n) sam­
ples. Having the expected point’s response collected in one vector, matched fil­
tering in azimuth is performed. Its aim is to detect whether the energy gathered 
in the vector comes from the examined scene point. The filtering is based on 
phase differences of the point’s response caused by different distances between 
the point and subsequent antenna positions. Expected phases of the point re­
sponse may be expressed as:

absolute value of A is the SAR image’s pixel brightness. 
To increase the radar range resolution, the step stepped frequency ap­
proach was used. In the presented case five subbands, each with a bandwidth of 
36 MHz, were used, giving a total bandwidth of 180 MHz. This corresponds to 
a 0.8m range resolution, similar to the expected cross-range resolution.
There are two methods of band synthesis: summation of interpolated sig­
nals in the time domain and the spectrum concatenation. The second approach 
was used as it is computationally more effective. The process of the band syn­
thesis is very simple: from each band a useful part of the spectrum is extracted 
(cut) and placed in a proper position in the final spectrum. After obtaining 
synthetized spectra of the transmit and receive signals, the cross-correlation 
function is calculated by computing the inverse FFT from the product of the 
spectra.

Passive Detection of Moving Targets
In the previous chapters active radar technology was presented. Active pulse 
radars have been used for many years to detect moving targets [1]. Active radar 
technology is now established, but its high peak power makes active radars very 
easy to be detected and classify, and thus their expected lifetime on the modern 
battlefield is very limited. For a long time scientists and engineers have been 
searching for a radar technology that would have a low probability of intercept 
(LPI). The search for an LPI radar with a low peak power and a long detection 
range has led to the development of continuous-wave radars such as frequency 
modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars [1–8], ultrawideband radars, and 
noise radars [9–13]. This approach eliminates some of the disadvantages of 
active radars such as very high peak transmitted power. However, more covert 
sensors are still required due to the fast progress in electronic support measure­
ments [7] and electronic countermeasures [14–20]. Most of the active radars 
can today be detected and jammed so that alternative technologies free of their 
own emissions are being investigated. 
The sharp increase in available computational power makes it possible to 
develop the family of passive radars. The leading technology in this field is pas­
sive coherent location (PCL) [21–29], also referred to as passive covert radars 
(PCR) [30–34]. In this technology target detection is based on the determina­
tion of the range-Doppler correlation function between the signal used for the 
illumination of the target and its return echo. To illuminate the target, various 
types of emitters of opportunity can be used, depending on the availability, 
required detection range, and properties. The most popular systems exploit FM 
radio [27, 29, 35–40]. There have been many studies on the exploitation of 
analog television illumination [41–46], but this signal is obsolete nowadays. 
Many countries have already switched off this transmission and many more 
intend to do it over the next couple of years. Much more attention has been 

202 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
attracted by digital broadcasting. Digital video broadcasting from satellites 
(DVB-S) provides very wide coverage even at low altitude, and also provides 
very wide frequency bands (30 MHz in a single channel, more than 2 GHz 
in total [47–50]), but the power density is very low and thus practical use is 
very limited. A similar problem occurs in exploiting GPS and GLONASS sig­
nals for passive location [51–55]. Illumination in this case is worldwide, but 
the power density is also very low. To improve the target echo to noise signal, 
the forward scatterings concept has also been investigated [56, 57]. Terrestrial 
digital signals are much more attractive than those in satellites. Much research, 
along with practical application, has been done on terrestrial digital television 
(DVB-T) [58–66]. The DVB-T transmitters have significant power (up to 100 
kW), a bandwidth comparable with active radars (8 MHz) and good coverage 
in order to provide a high-quality service to subscribers. This service is very well 
developed in many countries and is a good candidate for application in passive 
radars. Digital audio broadcasting transmitters (DAB) are also of interest as il­
luminators of opportunity [67–70], but the DAB signal is not as popular as it 
once was. The other group of signals exploited in passé radars are communica­
tion signals. Medium range passive radars (up to 50 km) can exploit cellular 
phone signals (GSM and UMTS among others) [71–80] and Worldwide In­
teroperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) networks [81–85]. Low-power 
WiFi networks can also be used for passive sensing in short-range applications 
(up to several kilometers) [86–89]. 
The PCL technique can be named passive only from the sensors’ point of 
view, but it still requires the existence of powerful illuminators of opportunity. 
Radar designers aspire to develop a fully passive system based on the radiation 
generated by the target. A wide scope of existing passive sensors called passive 
emitter tracking (PET) exploit the target’s man-made radio emissions such as 
on-board radio and radar transmitters, data link transmitters, secondary radar 
returns, and others. Two technologies are commonly used; namely, the mo­
nostatic direction of arrival (DOA) method [90–92] and the multistatic time 
difference of arrival (TDOA) technique [93–93]. The multistatic method of­
fers better accuracy than the monostatic one [98], but it requires much more 
computational power and broadband transmission links between sensor sites. 
However, this method works only when the onboard emission is switched on. 
A silent target can pass the defense line without being detected. 
To detect targets in a situation when there are no man-made emissions, 
either on-board or off-board of the target, other physical phenomena must be 
taken into consideration. These phenomena should be inherent to the mov­
ing target of interest. One feature that is widely used for target detection is 
thermal emission of the body of the target. The hot surface emits a broadband 
noise signal in the high-frequency (HF), microwave, and infrared regions. Far 
infrared (thermal) cameras have been in widespread use for target detection 

 
Passive Detection of Moving Targets

and tracking in military and commercial systems for a long time [99–102]. 
Lower microwave frequencies are utilized in radiometric systems [103, 104] 
that find many fields of applications, such as radio-astronomy [105], remote 
sensing [106, 107], medicine [108], pollution control (detection of oil slicks 
on the sea surface) [109], mine detection [110], and emission detection [111]. 
In most applications, only the emitted signal power is used. In some cases, 
however, the phase information is also taken into consideration. Most detection 
algorithms in phase-sensitive radiometry are based on the examination of the 
cross-correlation function of signals received by the antenna sets [105]. More 
sophisticated algorithms are used also for high-resolution passive radar imaging 
based on SAR technology [107, 112].
In classical radiometry, it is not possible to detect targets with the same 
temperature and radiation properties as their surrounding environment. How­
ever, the usage of correlation radiometry enables detection of man-made mov­
ing targets. Until now, there have not been such commercially available systems, 
but the experiments on tracking oceanic streams or detecting atmospheric phe­
nomena such as hydrometeors [107] show that it is possible to detect moving 
targets and estimate their position and velocity. 
7.1  Radiometric Detection System
Thermal emission is a feature of all objects whose temperature is higher than 
0 [K]. All man-made objects emit electromagnetic energy that can be used to 
detect and track such objects. Thermal emission covers a very wide frequency 
range, starting from the radio frequency and ending at the infrared or visible 
light frequency. According to Planck’s law, the radiated power density of a per­
fectly black surface is described by the formula:

where S0 is the effective area of the target, k is the Boltzmann constant, Tt is the 
target temperature, c is the velocity of light, F is the frequency, and h is Planck’s 
constant. The power, received by the narrowband microwave radiometric sys­
tem with bandwidth B and central frequency F (F >> B), equipped with an 
antenna system with effective surface (effective aperture) Sr and gain Gr, at the 
distance rt from the target, calculated using the Rayleigh-Jeans low-frequency 
approximation of Planck’s law is equal to:

where L stands for the receiver system losses. Several radiometry algorithms 
can be used for the detection of the target [111, 113, 114]. The most popular 
algorithm, very close to the optimal one, is based on the square-law detector 
and linear integration of the received power. The target detection range can be 
predicted as [115]:

(7.3)
where D0 is the detection threshold for a chosen probability of a false alarm and 
TR is the equivalent receiver temperature. The above equation determines the 
detection range in a clutter-free environment when only one target is present 
and detection is limited only by the receiver’s system thermal noise. In most 
practical scenarios the target is detected against the ground clutter and/or the 
space noise, so the detection range is much shorter. The direct use of the radio­
metric concept does not allow a sensor to distinguish a moving target from the 
ground clutter, and moving targets can be undetected when either the classical 
radiometric system or infrared cameras are applied. 
7.2  Detection of Moving Targets
The discrimination between the ground clutter and the moving target can be 
achieved using the Doppler frequency analysis. An example scenario of the pas­
sive detection of a moving target is presented in Figure 7.1.
The range velocity of the target (the change in time of the range between 
the target and the sensor) introduces the frequency shift to the narrow-band 
received signal. The Doppler frequency shift is equal to:
	
d

λ

(7.4)
where 
r

 is the target range velocity, λ is the wavelength, and F is the 
central frequency of the received signal. In active radars and PCL systems it is 
easy to detect even small Doppler frequency changes due to the fact that the 
reference (emitted) signal is available. In the case of radiometric systems it is 
not possible to calculate the Doppler shift from a single received signal. The 

 
Passive Detection of Moving Targets 
205
one and only way to estimate the Doppler frequency shift is to collect the signal 
radiated by the target using multiple receivers separated in space [115] and to 
perform correlation analyses of both received signals. The signal received by 
each receiver is a sum of the receiver’s system thermal noise, ground clutter, and 
the target signal shifted in time and in frequency by the Doppler shift (7.4).
To perform a correlation process, both receivers must have identical phase 
and amplitude characteristics. This constraint can easily by fulfilled by using 
the digital receiver concept [116], sometimes referred to as software-defined 
radio [117]. The received microwave signal is amplified by a wideband ana­
log receiver, downconverted to intermediate frequency and sampled by a high-
speed analog/digital converter. Further filtering and quadrature detection are 
performed digitally, which guarantees identical receiving channels frequency 
responses. The output signal is a complex digital signal shifted to the base­
band, sometimes referred to as a complex envelope. Nevertheless, to simplify 
the analysis, all further equations will be written in a continuous time domain, 
but discrete time equations lead to the same results.
Let us consider the case when the target can be treated as a point emit­
ter. Such an assumption can be valid if the range extent of the target is much 
smaller than the range resolution cell size11 
c
r
B
∆=
. To achieve a significant 
correlation between the received signals, it is required that the thermal emission 
1.	 In active radar the signal propagates from the radar to the target and back to the radar. In the 
described passive system the signal travels one way from the target to the receiving antenna, 
so the range resolution is half the quality of an active radar in the same bandwidth.

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
from a target surface illuminates simultaneously both receiving antennas. It is 
equivalent to the requirement that both antennas “observe” the same part of 
the target’s body.
The ground clutter can be divided into two classes of components. The 
first class is components that simultaneously illuminate both antennas, and the 
second class is components that illuminate only one receiver. To simplify the 
problem, only one point-like moving target and one point-like ground clutter 
source will be considered in the set of equations (7.5) and (7.6), which de­
scribe the signals received by both sensors (complex envelope of high-frequency 
signals):

In classical radiometry the signal cross-correlation function is often ex­
ploited. In the presented case the target signals are shifted both in time and in 
frequency. The optimal detection (in the mean square sense) for the single tar­
get scenario (without the ground clutter) can be performed by calculating the 
correlation coefficient between the signal received at the first site and the sig­
nal received at the second site, appropriately shifted in time and frequency for 
compensation of the range and Doppler shifts. In practice, the target range and 
Doppler parameters are unknown, and it is necessary to repeat the procedure

described above for all range and Doppler resolution cells. As a result, the 2-D 
range-Doppler cross-correlation function has to be calculated [118]:

A similar approach has also been described in [119] for the remote sens­

cross-correlation function (7.7) are the estimates of the target range difference

 and Doppler frequency difference (fd1 - fd2). The target is considered 
as a moving one if the estimated Doppler frequency difference is higher than 
the expected Doppler spread of a stationary target. The bistatic detection range

which is very similar to (7.3) describing the classical radiometric detection 
range. 
The advantage of this method is the possibility of distinguishing between 
stationary and moving targets. A simulation result of a range-Doppler plane 
calculated for each range and Doppler resolution cell directly from (7.7) for a 
single moving target (without ground clutter) is presented in Figure 7.2. The 
range difference from the moving target to the sensors is equal to 6.2 km, the 
radial velocity difference is equal to 61 m/s, the signal received from the target is 
8 dB smaller than the receiver’s system noise, and the time-bandwidth product 
is 10,000.
A single pair of sensors can be used to detect the target and to estimate 
the following: the two angles to this target, the difference of ranges between 
the target and the sensors, and the difference of radial velocities towards the 
sensors. In many cases this information is sufficient for the localization and 
tracking of the target. A better positioning accuracy can be obtained by using 
several pairs of sensors. In this case the angular information is redundant and 
the target position (on a 2-D plane or in a 3-D space) can be calculated using 
only the range data. 
7.3  Limitations of System Performance
The detection range determined by (7.8) can be extended by increasing integra­
tion time ti, system bandwidth B, receiver antenna gain G, and the decreasing 

208 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
of the receiver’s system equivalent temperature (e.g., by the use of a cooled 
amplifier). Performance of the system is limited by several factors. The first is 
the presence of the ground clutter. The part of the signal that originated from 
ground clutter that illuminates both receivers introduces additional correlation 
peaks at the zero frequency to the correlation plane (7.7), and sidelobes at non­
zero frequencies. The part of the ground clutter that illuminates only one sen­
sor increases the overall receiver noise level as well as the level of sidelobes in 
the correlation plane. The main lobe component may be easily removed using 
various types of MTI or MTD processing [1]. The sidelobe components can be 
removed in an active noise radar if a reference signal is available. In radiometric 
systems, however, it is not possible to create such a signal, and the heavy ground 
clutter can reduce the detection range. The reduction of the detection range 
occurs when the ground clutter power is higher than the thermal noise of one 
of the receivers. This effect can be incorporated into (7.8) by substituting the 
receiver system losses L with the value:

where Pg is the total power originated from ground clutter. 
Figures 7.3 and 7.4 show two examples of the range-Doppler plots ob­
tained in a simulation where both a moving target and the ground clutter are 
present. The first one illustrates the case where the ground clutter power is 
smaller than the thermal noise of one of the receivers. The scenario consists 
of one moving target and four point-like ground clutter sources. The signal 
received from the moving targets is 8 dB smaller than the system thermal noise, 
and the signal received from each clutter source is 12 dB smaller than the sys­
tem noise. The growth of the sidelobe level is no more than 1 dB in comparison 
with the clutter free environment.
In the scenario presented in Figure 7.4, the ground clutter power is much 
greater than the power of the receiver’s thermal noise. The scenario consists 
of one moving target and two point-like ground clutter sources (generating a 
signal 8 dB higher than the system noise). The sidelobe level increases signifi­
cantly, and in this case a small moving target cannot be detected. The sidelobes

generated by the ground clutter can be reduced by increasing the time-band­
width product and by decreasing the antenna beamwidth.
The second limitation is caused by the target range migration. The range 
resolution of the system is equal to c
B . The integration time should be limited 
by the time interval when a target remains within the resolution cell. This limi­
tation is described by the inequality:
	
i
c

Bv
<
	
(7.10)
where v is the difference of the object range velocities towards both receivers. 
Extension of the integration time can be achieved by adding additional terms in 
the cross-correlation function (7.7) correcting the range migration of the target 
[118]. Assuming the constant target velocity v, the range can be expressed as r = 
r0 + vt, and the correlation equation can be rewritten in the form:

The correlation described by (7.11) can be calculated effectively using the 
stretch processing concept described in Chapter 3.
The third limitation is caused by the target Doppler frequency migration. 
The Doppler frequency resolution of the system is equal to 1

It is possible to also take into account higher-order terms (e.g., accelera­
tion change), but this would lead to very high computational complexity, which 
could not be implemented nowadays in real time. Another possibility to over­
come the presented limitations is to combine the coherent integration with the 
noncoherent one. A short coherent integration time leads to a wider velocity 
resolution cell. To overcome the acceleration problem, a long data record can 
be divided into several shorter subblocks, and for each subblock the coherent 
integration can be performed. The inter-subblock noncoherent integration will 
decrease the system sensitivity in comparison to single subblock sensitivity by 
only a few decibels, and the numerical complexity will be much lower. A similar 
approach can be used in the case where limitation is caused by the range migra­
tion of the target. In this case it is possible to expand the range resolution cell 
by dividing the receiver bandwidth into several subbands [120]. The coherent 
integration can be performed separately for each subband and noncoherent 
integration can be applied to combine the data from all subbands. It is also pos­
sible to combine these two methods to achieve a high time-bandwidth product 
and high sensitivity, only a few decibels lower than using the compound coher­
ent integration.

Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar  
7.4  Passive Target Imaging
In a modern radar system the detection of a moving target is only the first step 
in data signal processing. The next step is to identify the target. Target iden­
tification may be performed using different methods. The classical secondary 
surveillance radar (SSR) or identification friend or foe (IFF) uses active iden­
tification. Such a radar sends an identification request to the target, and the 
target responds sending an identification code to the radar. Such an identifica­
tion method may be achieved only for cooperating targets. For noncooperative 
targets identification may be done using high-resolution target imaging. For 
this purpose optical, infrared, or radar imaging techniques are often applied. 
Optical or infrared imaging is based on high angular resolution of the optical 
systems, while radar imaging is based on inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) 
technology exploiting the coherent integration of target echoes.
The coherent integration technique, similar to the ISAR technique, can 
be used to obtain the high-resolution target image using the target’s thermal 
emission.
Let us consider a target composed of separated emission point-like centers 
both in the cross-track dimension and the along track dimension. The target 
is moving parallel to the Y-axis with a velocity of v. Two radiometric sensors 
observe the target in the time interval (-ti /2..ti /2). The sensors are placed in 
positions (0, Y0), (0, -Y0), respectively.
An example scenario is presented in Figure 7.5. The distances between the 
target and sensors are equal to:

For a short integration time optimal detection processing can be described 
by (7.7). For a longer integration time it is necessary to modify the detection 
equation and take into consideration the range migration effect and relation 
between the Doppler frequency and the range to the target. The range differ­
ence between a point-like emitter and receiving sites can be approximated by

If the target is a complex one and can be treated as a set of emission cen­
ters placed at different ranges, then each emission center contribution will have 
a different Doppler frequency, and those centers can be distinguished if their

Doppler frequencies differ more than the frequency resolution. The Doppler 
frequency resolution achieved using correlation equation (7.19) is equal to 1/T, 
and the final range resolution of the target can be expressed by the formula:

An example of a target range resolution for a radiometric system working 
at 20 GHz with 1-second integration time and 1 km of distance between the 
receiving sites versus the range to the target (X0) for v = 100 m/s, is presented in 
Figure 7.6. The resolution at the distance of 1 km is much better than 1m, for 
10 km it is equal to 10m and for 100 km it is equal to 1 km. The resolutions for 
long ranges are not too good, but can be improved using a longer integration 
time and a longer baseline. A similar analysis may be carried out to calculate 
the along-track resolution, but in this case the resolution is proportional to the 
receiver’s bandwidth:

In the scenario presented the simplest possible configuration was ana­
lyzed, but it is not difficult at all to extend the analysis to some more compli­
cated scenarios. 
As presented above, the passive noise system can be used both for mov­
ing target detection, tracking and target imaging. The additional limitation of 
the passive detection and imaging methods presented comes from the existing 
transmitter network. At present, it is very difficult to find a frequency band free 
of any man-made emission, and each man-made emission contributes to the 
overall system noise level and causes the decrease of passive system sensitivity. 
The influence of man-made emissions can be decreased by the adaptive cancel­
lation of unwanted emissions [121] using additional reference antennas.
As seen in this chapter, it is possible to use the radiometric coherent pro­
cessing concept to detect moving targets and also to image the target. For this 
purpose it is necessary to build a set of receiving stations tuned to the same fre­
quency and send all received signals to the processing center. To have sufficient 
sensitivity, it is necessary to find the frequency band free of interferences, which 
can be more and more difficult in the present time as an increasing amount of 
frequency bands are allocated for communication purposes.

Examples of Noise Radars
In the previous chapters the theory of the noise radar was presented. Up to now 
there have not been any commercially available noise radars and the technology 
is not mature yet, but more examples of noise radar demonstrators have been 
shown. Some are still based on analog signal processing, becuase such an ap­
proach leads to cheap, simple solutions. However, the majority of present-day 
examples are based on modern digital technology.
Several experiments with noise radars have been carried out in the Ra­
dar Technology Laboratory at the Warsaw University of Technology. One such 
experiment, limited synthetic aperture radar, was described in Chapter 6. The 
structure of the experimental noise radar used in most of the experiments at the 
Warsaw University of Technology is presented in Figure 8.1. The noise source 
is an arbitrary waveform generator. The digital memory of the generator stores 
the real and imaginary parts of the baseband complex signal (IQ). Values of 
the sample are read from the memory and converted to the analog form using 
two digital analog converters (DACs) with a 14-bit resolution in this case. The 
IQ signals from the converters are then lowpass-filtered to remove the high-
frequency component (higher than the Nyquist frequency) and upconverted by 
mixing them with the carrier frequency. The signal from the generator is split 
into two paths: the transmit signal and the reference signal. The dominant part 
of the generated power is transmitted through the transmit antenna. A fraction 
of the signal, taken from the low power output of a 20-dB splitter (directional 
coupler), is fed to the first receiver channel as a reference used in signal process­
ing. The signal from the receive antenna is amplified in a low-noise amplifier 
and fed to the second channel of the receiver. In the receiver, both channels are 
downconverted using a common local oscillator (LO). The use of the same LO 
signal guarantees frequency and phase coherence of the receiver. The received 
signals after downconversion are lowpass-filtered and digitized using a common 

226 
Signal Processing in Noise Waveform Radar 
ADC clock. After digitizing, the signals are passed to the digital IQ, demodu­
lated, and two IQ data streams (14 bits in this case) are passed to the signal 
processing unit. This unit can either store the data to the internal memory 
or hard drives matrices or process it in real time. For this purpose, different 
commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware was used. The examples of such 
hardware are presented in Figures 8.2 and 8.3. 
In Figure 8.2 the single channel noise radar hardware is presented. The ar­
bitrary waveform generator can store about 100 million complex samples in its 
internal memory and the vector signal analyzer can also store a similar number 
of samples with an instantaneous bandwidth of 36 MHz. The range resolution 
in the single frequency band is then at the level of 5m. A better resolution can 
be obtained using multiple bands. The length of the recording is equal to the 
sampling interval multiplied by the number of samples, so depending on the 
chosen bandwidth, it can vary from 2 seconds to 2 minutes. After the data

acquisition period, it is necessary to upload the recorded data to the computer 
controlling the radar demonstrator, which takes up to 15 minutes.
The second hardware setup is presented in Figure 8.3. The hardware con­
sists of a three-channel signal generator and a three-channel vector signal ana­
lyzer. The instantaneous bandwidth of the whole system is 50 MHz, which is 
equivalent to the monostatic range resolution of 3m. Both the generator and 
vector analyzer can be connected directly to the hard disk matrix so it is possible 
to stream recorded data directly to the hard drives and also get the recorded data 
to the generator. As a result, it is possible to record the three-channel data (and 
also to generate three channel data) continuously for more than 24 hours. The 
time of the recording (and playing) is now limited only by the capacity of the 
hard disk matrix.  
The first experiments on noise radar concerned the detection of moving 
targets. The first targets of opportunity were cars on the street near the War­
saw University of Technology. The measurements were taken from a balcony 
of the Radar Technology Lab [1]. The measurement scenario together with the 
antenna setup is presented in Figure 8.4. As the transmit and receive antennas, 
two log-period wideband antennas for the 800 to 2,100-MHz band were used. 
The transmit antenna was placed on the right side and the receive antenna was

placed on the left side. The area of interest was the street visible between the 
two buildings and the parking lot. The distance to the street was approximately 
250m. During the experiment cars on the road and cars in the parking lot were 
detected after the application of the ground clutter removal procedure [2]. Af­
ter this success, more experiments were carried out. For the second experiment 
a field environment was chosen [3]. The observed area was a country road, 
and this time the noise radar demonstrator was equipped with two reflector 
parabolic antennas used for transmitting and receiving with a gain of 24 dBi. 
The picture of the noise radar demonstrator and cooperative target equipped 
with a GPS logger is presented in Figure 8.5. The radar carrier frequency of 
2.45 GHz was chosen to work on the public band [2.4 GHz is the Industrial, 
Scientific and Medical (ISM) band]. The spectrum of the transmitted signal 
was Gaussian to avoid range sidelobes. The block length of 50 ms was chosen 
for analysis. The receive data was tapered using a Hamming time window. The 
cross-ambiguity function of the transmit signal is depicted in Figure 8.6. 
Also in this case the calculation of the cross-ambiguity function between 
the transmit (reference) and receive signals shows only direct antenna coupling 
and strong ground clutter as shown in Figure 8.7. The crosstalk signal was at 
the level of 60 dB (arbitrary scale) and the noise floor was at the level of 10 dB. 
The noise cancellation procedure, described in Chapter 4, completely removed 
the crosstalk signal and ground clutter. As a result, the noise floor was reduced 
to the level of −35 dB (a 45-dB improvement) and all targets were visible as 
Figure 8.5  Field test of the noise radar demonstrator working in the 2.4-GHz band.

depicted in Figure 8.8. The target with the velocity of −10 m/s was the coop­
erating target equipped with a GPS logger. As can be seen in Figure 8.8, the 
cooperating target position and velocity measured by the noise radar is in very 
good agreement with the logged position and velocity. The targets at velocities

−30 m/s and 25 m/s are noncooperative targets of opportunity and the target 
with the velocity of −5 m/s was a cyclist. 
The maximum detection range was about 600m as only that part of the 
road was illuminated by the radar.
To verify if it is possible to have longer-range detection, the next experi­
ment was focused on airplane detection. The Warsaw Airport is about 8 km 
away from the university campus and the flight path of the arriving airplanes 
is only 6 km from the Radar Technology Laboratory. Again noise illumination 
was used together with two reflector antennas. The carrier frequency was 2.45 
MHz and output power was 20 dBm. The view from the balcony of the labora­
tory where both antennas were placed is presented in Figure 8.9. The picture 
was taken during signal recording and the landing airplane is clearly visible. 
The result of the signal processing (including ground clutter cancellation) 
is presented in bistatic range-Doppler coordinates in Figure 8.10. The noise ra­
dar detected the landing aircraft at a range of 5.7 km. The target range velocity 
was only −27 m/s as the flight path is almost perpendicular to the line of sight. 
The detected position was compared with the ground truth obtained by the 
MODE-S receiver. Again both positions are in very good agreement. 
The noise radar demonstrator was also used to measure ground reflectiv­
ity. In this case it was necessary to measure all polarimetric components: ground 
reflectivity in HH, VV, HV, and VH polarity. To perform the measurements, 
four antennas were used: two transmit (H and V polarized) and two receive

(also H and V polarized). The two orthogonal noise signals were transmitted 
simultaneously and two received signal after amplification were recorded. For 
transmitting and recording a three-channel NI signal generator was used, and 
for receiving a three-channel signal analyzer was used. The block diagram of 
the scatterometer based on the noise radar demonstrator is shown in Figure 
8.11. Two channels were used for signal transmission and recording, while a 
third channel was used for synchronization purposes. The picture of the ex­
perimental setup is presented in Figure 8.12. The four antennas were placed on 
top of a 12m deployable mast. All electronic devices were put into the camp­
ing trailer. To calibrate the scatterometer, the corner reflector of a known radar 
cross-section was used. The idea of scatterometric measurements is depicted in 
Figure 8.13. The radar signal of the selected bandwidth is emitted by transmit 
antennas. The reflected signal is collected by the receive antennas and the reflec­
tion originating from each range ring is calculated [4, 5]. The expected signal

from the scatterometer is presented in Figure 8.14, while the measured values 
for each polarity are presented in Figure 8.15. 
Intensive research on noise radar has also been carried out at the Military 
Technical University, Warsaw, Poland, in a laboratory led by Professor Broni­
slaw Stec. His group is working on both analog and digital-based noise radars. 
An example of the radar for a through-the-wall sensing application is presented 
in Figure 8.16. As it is for most continuous-wave radars, it is equipped with 
Figure 8.14  The theoretical (expected) results of the measurements (range profile).

separate transmit and receive antennas. The block diagram of the radar is pre­
sented in Figure 8.17.
The noise signal generated in the noise signal transmitter is radiated by 
the transmit antenna. Part of the transmit signal, taken from the coupler, is 
delayed by the tunable delay line and passed to two correlators producing in-
phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals. The signals after the multipliers (mixers) 
are lowpass-filtered using integrating analog circuits. An example of the output 
IQ signals is presented in Figure 8.18. Three different phases of the experiment 
are clearly visible. In period 1 the radar observed the scene when only a non­
moving object was present. As it can be seen, the IQ signals are almost constant.

In period 2 a man entered the observation area, walked to a chair waving his 
hands, and sat on it. As can be seen, the IQ signals change rapidly in time. In 
period 3 the man was sitting still. The harmonic signal that originated from his 
chest movement due to his breathing can be observed. The distance between 
the radar and the man was about 6m. Similar signals were observed by Professor 
Stec’s team when a man was hidden by a brick wall. Apart from Professor Stec, 
many scientists are working on the problem of through-the-wall object detec­
tion using wideband or ultrawideband noise radars [8–10]. 
Another very active scientist working in the noise radar technology area 
is Professor Konstantin Lukin from the Usikov Institute for Radiophysics and 
Electronics, at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. His main area of 
interest is synthetic aperture noise radar. He has developed several noise radar 
demonstrators, described in his papers [12–18]. His synthetic aperture radar 
demonstrators are ground-based limited aperture radars. He has designed mo­
nostatic and multistatic systems working with different scanning concepts. One 
of the first was an arc-scanning SAR, where the SAR antenna was mounted 
at the end of a rotating arm, presented in Figure 8.19. In that particular case 
there was a single horn antenna used, while the radar worked in the pulse noise 
mode. The mechanism of the arm directed the antenna towards the scanning 
area during the whole 180° rotation of the arm. The example image obtained 
by the arc-SAR radar overlapping an aerial photo of Professor Lukin’s labora­
tory is presented in Figure 8.20, where the building and surrounding trees are 
clearly visible.

Another interesting example of his noise SAR is presented in Figure 8.21. 
It is an illustration of an interferometry campaign held in Kiev, Ukraine, to mea­
sure the displacement of the bell tower during the day and night [11]. In this 
case a Ka-band, continuous-wave noise limited aperture SAR radar was used. 
The antenna was not in motion, but inside the waveguide antenna a moving

slot was placed. The movement of the slot makes a horizontal shift of the radia­
tion center of the antenna, and this is why the SAR image could be obtained.  
The SAR image of the bell tower is presented in Figure 8.22. The shape of 
the tower can be clearly seen in this picture. During the measurement campaign,

several SAR images were taken, and these images were further used for the cre­
ation of interferograms (plots of phase changes between complex images). Two 
examples of interferograms are presented in Figure 8.23. The left interferogram 
was taken during nighttime, with almost constant ambient temperature. The 
shifts of the tower are very small, corresponding to changes of phase within 10°. 
The right image presents the interferogram taken during sunrise. The phase 
difference is now much higher, at the level of 40°. Further analysis shows that 
the phase measurement accuracy was at the level of 3°. In the Ka-band it cor­
responds to a measurement accuracy of the radial shifts at the level of 0.03 mm.
The example presented shows that noise radar technology is the subject of 
intensive research. Many scientists in different countries like the United States, 
Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Ukraine, Poland, Iran, South Korea, 
and many more are conducting research in this area, and in the near future 
noise radars will probably become commercially available.
All the technology presented is based on microwave devices, fast DAC 
and ADC, and an expensive signal processing unit. At first glance, it seems that 
only rich laboratories can make research in this area, but it has been shown that 
it is possible to carry out research in this area using acoustic signals instead of

noise SAR. Temperature variations in the scene during the night (left) and during sunrise

microwaves [20, 21]. As it was also shown, it is possible to construct an interest­
ing sensor and investigate noise radar-related problems using a classical personal 
computer equipped with a sound card, loudspeakers, and a microphone. To 
obtain a long detection range, acoustic parabolic mirrors can be used, and satel­
lite TV dishes are also very useful for this purpose.
