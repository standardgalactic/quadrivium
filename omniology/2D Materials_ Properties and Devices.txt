2D Materials
Properties and Devices
Learn about the most recent advances in 2D materials with this comprehensive and
accessible text. Providing all the necessary materials science and physics background,
leading experts discuss the fundamental properties of a wide range of 2D materials, and
their potential applications in electronic, optoelectronic and photonic devices. Several
important classes of materials are covered, from more established ones such as gra-
phene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, to new and
emerging materials such as black phosphorus, silicene, and germanene. You will gain
an in-depth understanding of the electronic structure and optical, thermal, mechanical,
vibrational, spin, and plasmonic properties of each material, as well as the different
techniques that can be used for their synthesis.
Presenting a uniﬁed perspective on 2D materials, this is an excellent resource for
graduate students, researchers, and practitioners working in nanotechnology, nanoelec-
tronics, nanophotonics, condensed matter physics, and chemistry.

“This book, edited by the top researchers who have been working on atomically thin materials in
the past decade, contains the essential contents of our current scientiﬁc understanding of this
novel form of materials. The authors have compiled comprehensive and contemporary reviews on
various topics ranging from fundamental science to engineering applications, providing an
excellent textbook for students as well as references for experts in the research ﬁeld.”
Philip Kim, Harvard University
“This edited volume consists of 25 topical chapters contributed by scientists active in the growing
ﬁeld of 2D semiconductors, who summarize the most salient features of these intriguing materials.
Contributions are grouped into three parts dedicated to graphene, transition metal dichalco-
genides, and elemental group V layered semiconductors including phosphorene. Covered are the
most actively researched topics : synthesis, stability, thermal and electronic properties including
transport, optics, optoelectronics and spintronics, phonon structure, and mechanical properties of
few-layer systems including heterostructures, as probed by state-of-the-art experimental and
theoretical techniques. While emphasis is placed on the rigorous scientiﬁc representation of
knowledge acquired to date, the contributors also offer a refreshing insight into potential applica-
tions of this new class of materials.”
David Tomanek, Michigan State University
“The ﬁeld of 2D materials, which started with graphene, now includes dozens of one-atom thick
crystals. Many of them demonstrate properties end effects which are equally as exciting as those
found for the famous ancestor. And, judging from the recent progress, the ﬁeld will be developing
very fast for many years ahead.
This book, written by scientists who are the leaders in their ﬁelds, is the most comprehensive
and up-to-date attempt to review this fast-developing subject. Starting with an in-depth summary
on graphene, it moves to other 2D crystals, such as transition metal dichalcogenides, black
phosphorous, and others, providing probably the most complete reference on the topic at the
moment.”
Kostya Novoselov, University of Manchester

Introduction
Phaedon Avouris, Tony F. Heinz, and Tony Low
The study and use of layered materials whose structure involves the stacking of
individual platelets has a very long history. Among these materials, graphite, an
allotrope of carbon, is perhaps the best-known example. It was already used by
Neolithic Danubians around 4,000 BC as paint for pottery [1]. Its chemical composition
was determined by Carl Wilhelm Scheelein 1779 [2], with details of its atomic structure
in 1924 [3], and electronic structure calculations in the 1950s [4, 5]. Other important
families of layered materials include the transition metal dichalcogenides (e.g., MoS2,
MoSe2), certain metal halides (e.g., PbI2 and MgBr2), and oxides (e.g., MnO2, MoO3),
perovskites (general form ABO3), layered III-VIs (e.g., GaS, InSe), and V-VIs (e.g.,
InSe, GaS) materials and layered silicates (clays, micas). The insulating hexagonal
boron nitride (h-BN) system is another important layered material, one isostructural
with graphite, but exhibiting very different properties. Currently, around 500 different
layered materials have been identiﬁed [6, 7].
Until relatively recently, research and applications of layered materials involved their
bulk solids. It was the mechanical exfoliation of a single graphene layer from graphite in
2004 by Geim, Novoselov, and co-workers [8] that focused the attention of the scientiﬁc
community on the study of single or few layers of these materials. A considerable
variety of other layered 2D materials has now also been mechanically exfoliated using
adhesive tape [9]. Chemical exfoliation in liquid dispersions is another widely used
technique. Ancient Mayas applied such an approach with clays for use as pigments,
while in the 1960s Boehm [10] isolated thin graphite ﬁlms in this fashion, and
Frindt [11] exfoliated metal dichalcogenides thin ﬁlms. Typically, chemical exfoliation
involves dispersion of the material in high-surface tension solvents, oxidation, or
intercalation by a variety of agents that lead to exfoliation [12]. Chemical techniques
can produce large quantities of 2D layers in a solvent, appropriate for depositing ﬁlms
that can be used in industry. Increasingly, for electronics and more high-end applica-
tions, 2D layers are directly synthesized using catalytic chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) or van der Waals epitaxy techniques [13]. Heterostructures involving atomic
layers of different materials can also be produced, by either sequential transfers or
direct growth.
In this book, the structure and properties of several classes of single or few layers of
2D materials are discussed. In the monolayer or few-layer regime, many layered
materials can acquire new and distinctive properties compared with their bulk parent.
For example, when graphite reduces to its monolayer, electrons acquire a linear

massless Dirac energy spectrum, leading to interesting physical phenomena such as the
anomalous half-integer quantum Hall and Klein tunneling. Indeed, the anomalous
quantum Hall signatures provide a smoking gun experiment for the conﬁrmation of
single-layer graphene [14, 15]. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the electronic
structure and Dirac physics in graphene, including its AB stacked bilayer. Massless
Dirac fermions have extremely high carrier mobilities. Chapter 2 surveys the various
scattering mechanisms that can limit carrier mobilities in graphene, such as intrinsic and
substrate phonons and impurities. Despite being atomically thin, graphene can absorb
about 2% of incident light in the visible range and its absorption exhibits distinctive
characteristics from the UV to THz frequencies. Chapter 3 discuss the electrically
tunable optical properties of graphene. In its perfect crystalline form, graphene is also
the strongest material. The mechanical properties of graphene and the experimental
techniques used to establish these properties are described in Chapter 4. A formal
introduction to the vibrational modes and their characteristics in graphene are provided
in Chapter 5. This is followed by a discussion of the exceptional thermal conductivity of
graphene in Chapter 6.
While new physical phenomena are still being discovered and interesting techno-
logical advances are continually being made, research in this ﬁeld has arguably reached
a juncture where opportunities for real applications are being considered and weighed
against today’s state-of-the-art solutions. Chapter 7 discusses graphene device physics
and the development of graphene electronics especially for radio frequency applica-
tions. Chapter 8 provides a different perspective on graphene electronics, exploiting
electrostatic p–n junctions to realize electronic analogues of optical effects such as
waveguiding and negative index of refraction. Due to the negligible spin–orbit coupling
in graphene, it is also touted as an excellent channel for spintronics as discussed in
Chapter 9. Chapter 10 discusses the use of h-BN as a substrate for graphene and its
encapsulation, yielding electronic properties in graphene close to the intrinsic limits.
Chapter 11 discusses the application of graphene for optoelectronics, including as
photodetectors and light modulators. By exploiting plasmons in graphene, light–matter
interactions can be strongly enhanced at the mid- to far-infrared frequencies by effective
light conﬁnement. Chapter 12 discusses the basics of graphene plasmons and some
emerging applications. We conclude the discussion of graphene with Chapter 13 on its
growth using chemical vapor deposition.
Another important class of 2D materials presented in this book is that of the transition
metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). The stoichiometry of these materials is MX2, where
M = Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Mo, W, Re, and X = S, Se, Te. They form layered 2D crystal
structures, each layer having a thickness of 0.6–0.7 nm, with the metal atoms forming a
hexagonally packed layer sandwiched between two adjoining layers of chalcogen atoms.
The stacked layers are held together by van der Waals forces. As bulk solids, these TMDC
materials have many interesting properties. They can be metals (e.g., NbS2, VSe2),
semiconductors (e.g., MoS2, WS2), and insulators (e.g., HfS2), as well as displaying
superconductivity and charge-density waves at low temperatures (e.g., NbSe2, TaS2).
The second part of this book is devoted to the electronic and optical properties of
monolayer TMDCs and their potential applications. Chapter 14 discusses the evolution

of the electronic structure of TMDCs, such as MoS2 or MoSe2, from indirect gap
semiconductor in bulk to direct gap at monolayer thickness. The effective Hamiltonian
for electrons, the band gap, and the materials’ dependence on strain are examined.
Unlike graphene, electrons in TMDCs are described by a massive Dirac Hamiltonian
and exhibit interesting coupled spin–valley physics. Chapter 15 introduces these basic
theoretical concepts and the associated physical effects, such as spin–valley Hall
currents, valley selective optical properties, and exciton physics. Experimental results
on the electronic transport properties of MoS2 are presented in Chapter 16. This is
followed by a discussion of the materials’ optical properties, focusing primarily on
circular dichroism and strongly bound excitons, in its vertical heterostructures in
Chapter 17. In Chapter 18, we provide a survey of emerging applications in optoelec-
tronics, including light-emitting devices and photodetectors. Chapter 19 discusses the
experimental realization of vertical heterostructures and their corresponding optical and
excitonic properties. Chapter 19 provides an introduction into the synthesis of large-area
TMDC crystals and their heterostructures by means of CVD. We conclude the second
part of the book with a discussion about common sources of defects in 2D materials,
particularly in TMDCs, in Chapter 20.
In the ﬁnal part of this book, emerging new 2D materials are discussed. A layered
material that has recently generated great excitement is black phosphorus (BP). It is an
allotropic form of phosphorus produced from the common red phosphorus at very
high pressures [16]. Like graphene, 2D sheets can be formed by exfoliation. However,
its monolayer structure is not planar, but buckled and featuring highly anisotropic
properties. Sheets of BP are semiconducting, with a direct band gap that varies
signiﬁcantly with layer thickness. In Chapter 21, we provide a broad theoretical
perspective on the anisotropic electronic, optical, excitonic, plasmonic, thermal,
thermoelectric, transport, and mechanical properties in BP. This is followed in
Chapter 22 with a review of recent experimental studies and of our current under-
standing of the electronic, mechanical, and thermal properties of BP. Experimental
investigations of the optical properties of BP, particularly of its excitonic signatures
and applications in optoelectronics are discussed in Chapter 23. In a different research
direction, honeycomb lattice analogues of graphene involving group IV elements,
such as Si (silicene), Ge (germanene), and Sn (stanene), have recently been synthe-
sized. Unlike graphene, these layers have strong spin–orbit coupling and are predicted
to be topological insulators, displaying an interesting quantum spin Hall effect. The
structure and properties of these new materials are discussed in Chapter 24. The book
then ends (Chapter 25) with a discussion about how theoretical predictions based
on ﬁrst-principle calculations can guide the search for 2D layered materials with
desired properties.

1.1
Chemical Bonding and Ground-State Structure
Carbon is the sixth element in the periodic table. The carbon atom has six electrons, two
of them in the 1s2 shell and four ﬁlling 2s and 2p states. The ground-state atomic
conﬁguration is 2s22p2, with total spin S = 1, total orbital moment L = 1, and total
angular moment J = 0 (the ground-state multiplet 3P0). The ﬁrst excited state with J = 1,
the 3P1 multiplet, has energy 16:4 cm1  2meV [1] which gives an estimate of the
spin–orbit coupling strength. The lowest energy state with 2s12p3 conﬁguration has
excitation energy 33735:2cm1  4:2eV [1], representing the promotion energy of a 2s
electron to a 2p state. Therefore, we might expect carbon to be always divalent, due to
the two 2p-electrons and the closed 2s shell. This conclusion is, however, wrong.
Normally, carbon is tetravalent, due to the formation of hybridized sp states, according
to the concept of “resonance” by Linus Pauling [2, 3].
When atoms form molecules or solids, the total energy decreases due to overlap of
the electron wave functions at different sites and the formation of molecular orbitals (in
molecules), or energy bands (in solids). This energy gain can be sufﬁcient for the energy
necessary to promote electrons from 2s to 2p states in the carbon atom. In non-ionic
solids, there are two kinds of strong chemical bonding: covalent and metallic. In
covalent bonds, the electrons are shared between neighboring atoms with a strong
dependence of the cohesive energy on the angles between bonds, whereas in metallic
bonding, the electrons are redistributed over the whole crystal in a more isotropic way.
In diamond, four sp3 covalent bonds with tetrahedral orientation are formed, with bond
length a  1:54 Å. Alternatively, three electrons can form sp2 covalent bonds with planar
minimum energy conﬁguration and 120o angles, whereas one p-electron per atom forms a
metallic bond. The prototype is the conjugated bond in the benzene molecule where the
interatomic distances are a  1:42Å shorter than in diamond. Graphite, the most common
form of elemental carbon at ambient conditions, consists of ﬂat layers with this type of
covalent and metallic character. When isolated, a single layer is called graphene. In
graphite, the graphene layers are weakly coupled by van der Waals interactions with an
equilibrium interlayer distance 3.35 Å [4]. The minimum energy corresponds to Bernal
stacking AB where even layers (B) are rotated on odd layers by 60o, as shown in
Fig. 1.1. A slightly less favorable conﬁguration is the rhombohedral graphite with three
periodically repeated layers ABC, each rotated by +60o with respect to the adjacent
ones. Structures with a random distributions of +60o and –60o rotations are called

turbostratic graphite. The AA stacking is energetically costly, and is not found in nature.
The energetics of different types of stacking are discussed, e.g., in [5, 6]. Similar
sp2-type bonding is also found in nanotubes and fullerenes [7]. Nanotubes can be
thought of as graphene rolled at given angles and leading to a structure similar to the
planar hexagonal structure of graphene but with slightly bent hexagons. Fullerenes are
large molecules (C60, C72, ...) which can be considered as graphene pieces curved into
objects with the topology of a sphere. For topological reasons (different Euler
characteristics for sphere and cylinder), they cannot be built from hexagons only and
require the introduction of 12 pentagons per molecule [7]. All these allotropes of
elemental carbon, with the exception of diamond, are called graphitic forms.
As seen in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 1.2, at ambient conditions graphite is the
stable structure, which is why it is much more common on the Earth’s surface whereas
at large pressures, like in the Earth’s mantle, diamond is more favorable. The difference
between graphite and diamond is very small but with a large barrier to be overcome
for the transformation so that diamond exists as a metastable structure up to high
temperature. In Fig. 1.3, we show how the energy change when pressure is applied
perpendicularly to graphite layers leads to the transformation to diamond [8, 9]. The
stability of the sp2 bonding with respect to sp3 for carbon is the reason why layers can
be easily separated. In 2004, it was shown that single layers could be exfoliated and
deposited on other substrates [10, 11] leading to the beginning of the “‘graphene boom”
and opening the door to new two-dimensional (2D) materials. Other elements of the
same fourth column of the periodic table strongly prefer sp3 hybridization. For Si, Ge,
and Sn, the diamond structure corresponds to the minimal energy. For Sn, this is the
ground state at low temperature (grey tin) competing with the metallic phase (white tin)
at higher temperatures (T > 286 K), whereas Pb is a metal with an fcc structure.
Nevertheless, we can obtain 2D analogues of graphene for Si [12] and Ge [13], e.g.
by epitaxial growth on the (111) surfaces of fcc metals. Exfoliation is of course
impossible because, as said, there is not a bulk graphitic form for these elements. While
for graphene in its ground state, the chemical bond is of pure sp2 character and the
structure is exactly planar, for silicene and germanene there is an essential sp2–sp3
mixture of the bonding resulting in a buckled conﬁguration. As shown in Fig. 1.4,
due to the buckling in germanene the electronic density is strongly modulated in the
Fig. 1.1 Bernal stacking: carbon atoms belonging to sublattices A and B are shown as

coupling in silicene and germanene with potential relevance for spintronics [13].

consider the properties of freely suspended graphene that can give general results for 2D
structures embedded in 3D space. This is not only relevant for all other 2D crystals but
also for the general long-standing problem of mechanics and statistical physics of thin
membranes [18, 19, 20].
In crystals, the phonon spectrum always includes acoustic modes, with linear
dispersion ω / q for q ! 0, where ω is the phonon frequency and q is the
wavevector. As a result, in the harmonic approximation, at ﬁnite temperature the
contribution of these modes to the mean square atomic displacement is divergent as

Þ, where L is the sample size. This was ﬁrst noticed
in the 1930s by Peierls [21] and Landau [22] and led them to the conclusion that 2D
crystals cannot be stable. Strictly speaking, this divergence only implies that the
harmonic approximation, based on the assumption that thermal displacements are much
smaller than interatomic distances, is not valid in 2D crystals. However, this statement
on destruction of the long-range crystalline order in 2D crystals turned out to be correct
and rigorously proved as a part of the Mermin–Wagner theorem [23]. Therefore, the
statement that graphene is a 2D crystal requires some explanation and clariﬁcation.
If we embed 2D crystals in 3D space, the situation seems to be even worse. In fact, in
this case, acoustic out-of-plane phonons turn out to have quadratic dispersion ω / q2

out-of-plane ﬂuctuations

(for a review see [18, 19, 20]) show that an harmonic coupling of in-plane and out-

considerations similar to those used in the theory of critical phenomena. As a result,
out-of-plane acoustic modes become less soft q2 ! q2η but in-plane modes become

reason, long-range crystal order does not exists also for 2D crystals embedded in 3D
space. The long-range crystal order is observable through the existence of Bragg peaks in
the structure factor, which become inﬁnitely sharp in the limit L ! ∞. For 2D crystals in
3D, these peaks have a ﬁnite broadening [19]. This broadening is small if kBT  κ,
where κ is the bending rigidity, and the centers of the broadened Bragg peaks still form
the ideal reciprocal lattice. For graphene at room temperature, kBT=κ  1=40, thus
justifying the use of the name crystal for graphene [20].
In turn, the behavior predicted by scaling theory h2

/ L2η means that at any ﬁnite
temperature graphene has a rippled structure due to out-of-plane ﬂuctuations. This is
clearly seen in atomistic Monte Carlo simulations [25, 26], where ripples reversibly
appear with temperature with amplitude following the above scaling with L. A typical
snapshot for graphene at room temperature is shown in Fig. 1.5. Rippling of suspended
graphene was experimentally observed by electron diffraction [27], although it is still
under debate if these ripples are intrinsic due to dynamical thermal ﬂuctuations or static,
e.g., due to thermal compression [28].

The electronic structure of graphene and graphite are discussed in detail in [30]. In
Fig. 1.7, we show the graphene band structure. The sp2 hybridized states (σ-states) form
occupied and empty bands with a huge gap, whereas π-states form a single band with a
conical self-crossing point at K (and by symmetry also at K0). The assignment to σ- and
pz-bands is done as in [31]. This band structure was obtained for the ﬁrst time by
Wallace in 1947 [32], by a simple tight-binding model, later developed by McClure [33]
and Slonczewski and Weiss [34]. The Fermi energy of undoped graphene falls exactly
at the crossing of the conical points, separating a completely ﬁlled valence band and an
empty conduction band with no band gap in between. Therefore, at ﬁrst sight, graphene
might be classiﬁed as a gapless semiconductor [35]. Three-dimensional crystals, such as
HgTe or α-Sn (gray tin), are known to be gapless semiconductors. What makes
graphene unique is not the gapless state itself but the very unusual chiral nature of the
electron states, which will be described later, as well as the high degree of electron–hole
symmetry. As a result of subtle quantum relativistic effects (conductivity via evanescent
modes of the Dirac operator), undoped graphene has a ﬁnite conductivity at zero

gapless semiconductor [36, 19].
Following [32], we consider only the π-states and nearest-neighbor hopping terms
(parameter t), so that there are only hopping processes from one sublattice to the other
(bipartite lattice). The basis of the electronic states contains two π-states per unit cell
belonging to atoms of sublattices A and B. The tight-binding Hamiltonian is therefore

The term in t0 breaks the electron–hole symmetry shifting the conical point from
E = 0 to E = –3t0 but it does not change the behavior of the Hamiltonian near the
conical points. Experimentally, t0 is negative (the sign of t is arbitrary since it can be
eliminated by a gauge transformation of the wave function in one of the sublattices) and
t0  0:1 tj j [39]. The existence of the conical points in graphene is a consequence of
symmetry [34], and therefore it does not depend on any speciﬁc assumptions on the
number of bands, hopping parameters etc. The protection of this feature relies on two
discrete symmetries: time reversal, and spatial inversion [40]. The latter assumes
equivalence of the sublattices.
The points K and –K0 are equivalent because they differ by the reciprocal lattice vector

For ideal graphene, the valleys are decoupled. In the presence of inhomogeneities,
which are smooth at the atomic scale (external electric and magnetic ﬁelds, disorder,
etc.), the valleys remain independent since the Fourier component of the external
potential with the Umklapp wavevector b
! is very small, and intervalley scattering is
improbable. However, we should keep in mind that any sharp (atomic-scale) inhomo-
geneity, like boundaries or vacancies, would mix the states from different valleys.

The Hamiltonian (Eq. (1.12)) is a 2D analogue of the Dirac Hamiltonian for massless
fermions [42]. Instead of the velocity of light c, there is a parameter v  c=300. The
internal degree of freedom, which is just spin for “true” Dirac fermions, is the sublattice
index in the case of graphene. Dirac “spinors” consist here of the components giving the
distribution of electrons in sublattices A and B. We will call this quantum number
pseudospin, so that pseudospin “up” means sublattice A and pseudospin “down” means
sublattice B. Beside the pseudospin, there are two more internal degrees of freedom,
the valley label (sometimes called isospin) and the real spin, so that the most general
low-energy Hamiltonian of electrons in graphene is an 8  8 matrix.
Spin–orbit coupling leads to a mixture of pseudospin and real spin and to gap
opening [43]. However, the value of the gap is supposed to be very small, of the order
of 102K for pristine graphene [44]. The reason is not only the lightness of carbon
atoms but also the orientation of the orbital moments of π-states perpendicular to the
graphene plane.
For the case of “true” Dirac fermions in 3D space, the Hamiltonian is a 4  4 matrix,
due to two projections of the spin and two values of the charge degree of freedom
(particle versus antiparticle). For the 2D case, separation in particle and antiparticle
is not independent of the pseudospin direction. Electrons and holes in graphene are
just linear combinations of the states from the sublattices A and B. The 2  2 matrix

(helical), as it should be for massless Dirac fermions [42]. This is of crucial importance
for “relativistic” effects, such as Klein tunneling [45, 19], which will be considered
brieﬂy later.
The Dirac model for electrons in graphene results from the lowest-order expansion of
the tight-binding Hamiltonian (Eq. (1.12)) near the conical points. Taking into account
the next, quadratic, term, we ﬁnd (in the basis (Eq. (1.16)), instead of the Hamiltonian

Electronic Structure of Bilayer Graphene
The process of exfoliation leads often to samples made of more than one graphene layer.
Bilayer graphene [47] is especially interesting. To describe a bilayer, we need to extend
the tight-binding model to consider interlayer terms [33, 34, 48].
The crystal structure of bilayer graphene with Bernal stacking is shown in Fig. 1.9.
The atoms in the sublattices A of the two layers lie exactly on top of each other, with a
ﬁnite hopping parameter γ1 between them, whereas there are no signiﬁcant hopping
processes between the sublattices B of the two layers. Data on the electronic structure
of graphite [49] indicate that the parameter γ1 	 t⊥is about 0.4 eV, an order of
magnitude smaller than the nearest-neighbor in-plane hopping parameter γ0 ¼ t. The
simplest model, which takes into account only these processes, is described by the
Hamiltonian

Graphene as a Bridge between Condensed Matter
and High-Energy Physics
The many exceptional properties of graphene discussed in this chapter make it interest-
ing in many respects and it will therefore be the subject of following chapters. Here we
will underline the relevance of graphene for fundamental physics, beyond condensed
matter. The key point is that charge carriers in graphene can be described as massless
Dirac fermions. In particle physics, to reach this ultra-relativistic regime we need
energies much higher than the particle rest energy whereas in graphene one can reach
it by default. Moreover, to open a gap in the spectrum, which corresponds to the rest
energy in particle physics, some efforts are needed, like chemical functionalization [53],
combination of strain with electric gating [54], size quantization in nanoribbons [55].
Massless Dirac fermions appear also in other situations in condensed matter physics, for
example in superﬂuid 3He [56] and on the surface of topological insulators [57], but in
Fig. 1.11 Effect of hopping parameter γ3 on the band structure of bilayer graphene.

graphene the Dirac regime describes the energy spectrum in an particularly broad range
up to a few eV. Since in graphene there are two Dirac cones instead of one as in
topological insulators, the Dirac physics can be in principle destroyed by intervalley
scattering processes due to atomically sharp defects. However, since graphene has
one of the strongest chemical bonds in nature, such defects (vacancies, dislocations,
Stone–Wales defects) have high-formation energy [29] and rarely occur spontaneously.
Therefore, the observation of phenomena related to the Dirac nature of the charge
carriers is not very challenging. An important difference between Dirac fermions and
charge carriers in graphene is that the light velocity c is replaced by the Fermi velocity
v which is 300 times smaller. As a result, instead of the ﬁne structure constant
α ¼ e2=ħc  1=137 determining the strength of interaction in quantum electrodynam-
ics, in graphene there is a much stronger interaction with adimensional coupling
constant e2=ħv  2:2. For this reason, some quantum relativistic effects, which are
difﬁcult to observe in particle physics, become accessible in the physics of graphene.
Probably the best example is the relativistic atomic collapse which is supposed to
happen for the elements with Z > 170, determining the natural limit of the periodic
table [58] which is still far from being reached. For graphene, an analogous phenom-
enon was predicted [59, 60, 61] and experimentally observed [62]. Funnily, the true ﬁne
structure constant also plays a role in graphene, determining its optical transmission
with absorption coefﬁcient η ¼ πα  2:3% per graphene layer [63].
Probably the most relevant quantum relativistic phenomenon for the physics and
applications of graphene is Klein tunneling [45] which was also experimentally
observed [64, 65]. This is a property of relativistic quantum particles, to be transmitted
across a potential barrier of any height and thickness. This property is a direct conse-
quence of chirality (Eq. (1.22)). On the one hand, Klein tunneling does not allow to
make a graphene transistor based just on p–n junctions as in semiconductors because we
cannot lock the junction. On the other hand, it is the Klein tunneling that protects the
mobility of charge carriers in graphene, making the unavoidable presence of electron–
hole puddles [66] not so detrimental to charge transport.
A detailed discussion of the relation of the physics of graphene to high-energy
physics can be found in [19].

Electrical Transport in Graphene:
Carrier Scattering by Impurities
and Phonons
Jian-Hao Chen
Charge carrier transport in graphene has been one of the major focuses of attention since
the experimental realization of isolated graphene [1]. Much of the interest has arisen from
the prospect of fabricating graphene into high-speed electronic devices, which rely on the
exceptional carrier mobility of the electronic material as well as consistency in the
performance of such devices. The large surface-to-bulk ratio of graphene/few-layer
graphene provides exceptional tunability of the electron system to external perturbations,
including electric ﬁeld, magnetic ﬁeld, surface modiﬁcations, etc. The meaning of such
tunability is two-fold: it could be exploited in technological applications, while the effects
of disorders (impurities, ripples, phonons of graphene, and the device substrate) become
an important factor in determining the performance of graphene-based devices. Indeed,
graphene ﬁeld-effect devices fabricated on various substrates (e.g. silicon dioxide sub-
strate, hexagonal boron nitride substrate) as well as suspended graphene devices (the
active area of graphene suspended in vacuum) have shown varying ﬁeld-effect mobilities
ranging from 0.1 to 20 m2/V s [2, 3, 4], which are mainly caused by scattering of
electrons by structural defects [5, 6, 7, 8], charged impurities [9, 10], and neutral
physisorbed species [11]; phonons [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] have measurable effects on the
performance of the device, with most of the effects coming from the scattering of
electrons by substrate phonons [13, 14]; the corrugation of the two-dimensional graphene
layer could cause some scattering, but the effects are small compared with those of other
scattering sources in realistic device conﬁgurations [17, 18, 19].
This chapter proceeds as follows: Section 2.1 introduces the basics of Boltzmann
transport theory and early experimental ﬁndings; Section 2.2 explains the experimental
and theoretical understandings of charge carriers scattered by charged impurities; Section
2.3 covers the effects of resonance scatterers; Section 2.4 discusses the effects of corruga-
tions of the graphene membrane (ripples); Section 2.5 examines the effects of phonons,
including optical, acoustic, and substrate phonons on the performance of graphene devices.

phenomena in graphene that are related to current state-of-the-art technological appli-
cations. In the semiclassical picture, the single-electron probability distribution is the

In the early dates of graphene research, there were three major experimental ﬁndings
for the quasi-DC transport properties of graphene in zero magnetic ﬁelds [2, 22, 23, 24]:
(1) conductivity of graphene depends roughly linearly on carrier density both in the
electron conduction regime and in the hole conduction regime (see Fig. 2.1(a) and
Fig. 2.2); (2) near the charge neutrality point, the conductivity of graphene devices
does not go to zero, but instead has values near 4e2=h (see Fig. 2.1(b) and the inset in
Fig. 2.2); and (3) temperature-dependent resistivity of graphene is smaller than that of
semiconductors such as silicon (see Fig. 2.3). For graphene devices with high ﬁeld-
effect mobilities, a sublinear dependence of the conductivity on carrier density is also
observed [2, 10]. Theories on carrier scattering in graphene in zero magnetic ﬁelds at

low temperature (Sections 2.2–2.4) have been proposed to try to explain these charac-
teristics and were tested by experiments. The theoretical and experimental understand-
ing of the effects of phonons is described in Section 2.5.
2.2
Charged Impurities
Charged impurities are predicted to have dramatic effects on the transport properties of
graphene. Several groups [9, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29] have shown theoretically that charged
impurity scattering in graphene should produce a conductivity linear in charge density
and inversely proportional to impurity density, i.e.
σci n
ð Þ ¼ Ccie
n
nimp
				
				:
(2.9)
This is equivalent to a constant mobility, inversely proportional to charged impurity
density μ = C/nimp. The linear σci(n) arises from the 1/q dependence of the Coulomb
potential on the wavevector q, leading to a 1/kF dependence of the scattering rate.
A unique aspect of graphene, as opposed to other two-dimensional electron
systems (2DES), is that the 1/kF dependence is preserved even for a screened
Coulomb potential in graphene [28], creating a clear dichotomy in graphene between

dependent conductivity near the Dirac point for the data in the main panel (adapted with

long-range and short-range scattering potentials. Hwang et al. [28] calculated the
screened Coulomb potential within the random phase approximation (RPA), and used
the results to determine Cci  5  1015 V–1 s–1. Novikov [30] noted that, beyond the
Born approximation used by Hwang et al. [28], an asymmetry in Cci for attractive
versus repulsive scattering (electron versus hole carriers) is expected for Dirac
fermions.
In the presence of charged impurities, at low carrier density, the conductivity does not
vanish linearly, but rather saturates to a constant value, the minimum conductivity σmin,
over a plateau of width ΔVg [9, 26, 28]. Numerical calculations [26, 28] showed a ﬁnite
conductivity of order 4e2/h at zero charge density, which persisted over a plateau width
roughly determined by the impurity density. Adam et al. [9] calculated the plateau
width ΔVg analytically; they also found that the minimum conductivity ranges from
4e2/h to 20e2/h depending on the density of the charged impurities. Adapting the theory
of semiconductor band tails [31] to this problem, they calculated the carrier density at
which the minimum conductivity occurs (Vg,min), and predicted that σmin occurs not at
the carrier density which neutralizes nimp, but rather at the carrier density at which the
average impurity potential is zero [9]. This prediction suggests that the gate voltage of
the minimum conductivity Vg,min would have an effective power law dependence on
nimp, with an exponent not equal to one, but rather a function of the distance of the
charged impurities to graphene [9]. The minimum conductivity problem was also
treated by Cheianov et al. [27]. Their results are qualitatively consistent with Adam
et al. [9], but they made no quantitative prediction on the magnitude or charged-
impurity-density dependence of the minimum conductivity.

2.2 Charged Impurities

14 Aug 2017 at 14:27:11, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

Chen et al. [10] performed an experiment in which graphene ﬁeld-effect devices with
clean surfaces were placed in an ultra-high vacuum environment and potassium atoms
were absorbed on the surface of the graphene with the sample at low temperatures. The
conductivity σ versus gate voltage Vg (proportional to carrier density n) were then
measured in-situ for different potassium concentrations. The absorbed potassium atoms
ionize and act as charged impurities. By measuring the dependence of σ versus Vg , Chen
et al. extracted the scattering strength of the Dirac Fermions in graphene by charged
impurities, and demostrated that (1) charged impurities give rise to linear dependence of
σ versus n (see Fig. 2.4); (2) charged impurities are the major scatterers of high-quality
graphene devices; and (3) the DC minimum conductivity of graphene is not a universal
number, but, rather, determined by the details of local impurities (see Fig. 2.5).
Further experiments have been done to verify the validity of the claim by Chen et al.
[10]. The general idea of these follow up experiments is to alter the dielectric environ-
ment of the graphene sample so that the effects of charged impurities can be tuned.
Ponomarenko et al. [32] covered a graphene sample with glycerol, ethanol, and water
and put graphene onto various dielectric substrates such as SiO2, polymethylmethacryl-
ate, spin-on glass, bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, mica, and boron nitride.
They found that the mobility of graphene increases modestly if it is put into an environ-
ment with stronger dielectric screening, but the magnitude of the increase could not
match the dielectric constants of these substrate materials. This experiment points to the
difﬁculties in increasing dielectric screening of low-dimensional materials without intro-
ducing other scattering sources: liquid dielectric such as water has an uncertain dielectric
constant (it has been shown that water molecules absorbed on a graphite surface form a
thin ice-like structure [33], with much less dielectric constant than liquid phase water),
while high-k solid state dielectric materials generally have a surface plagued with
dangling bonds and soft polar optical phonons that are activated at moderate tempera-
tures; both of which are strong scattering sources that will lower the mobility of the
graphene samples. Jang et al. [11] undertook a highly controlled in-situ experiment
in an ultra-high vacuum environment, in which ice layers were absorbed on graphene

ﬁeld-effect devices with clean surfaces at low temperatures. The experiment found that,
by changing the dielectric environment of the top surface of graphene from vacuum to
ice: (1) the scattering strength of charged impurities was reduced; (2) the scattering
strength of neutral “white noise” disorder was increased; and (3) the minimum
conductivity of the device remained unchanged (see Fig. 2.6). These ﬁndings agree with
theory qualitatively, and show unambiguously that charged impurity is indeed the
dominant scattering source that produces the linear conductivity versus carrier density
and limits the mobility of high-quality graphene samples.
2.3
Resonant Scatterers
The concept of resonant scatterers was introduced to describe carrier transport in metals
with impurities that have strongly attractive potentials which form bound states or
quasi-localized states [34, 35]. It was ﬁrst introduced in the context of carrier transport
in graphene by Stauber et al. [5] and further developed by Titov et al. [36] and Weling
et al. [37] as a type of inter-valley scatterers.
Stauber et al. [5] proposed that vacancy defects in graphene are one kind of resonant
scatterer and that they give rise to bound states at the Dirac point, which are also called
mid-gap states. Mid-gap states are strong carrier scatterers with short-range interaction,
which strongly perturb the system such that the Klein paradox [38] is not at work, and
the scattering potential gives rise to a conductivity in graphene of the form that is similar
to a non-relativistic electron gas [5, 39]

where Cmg is a constant, nd is the vacancy defect density, and R0 is the effective radius
of the vacancy (of the order of the bond length in graphene). The logarithmic term leads
to slightly sublinear dependence of conductivity on charge density. Other resonance
scatterers [36, 37, 40, 41] include the formation of various covalent bonds (such as
C—C bonds, H—C bonds, and F—C bonds) on the surface of graphene.
A number of experiments were reported in which resonance scatterers were uninten-
tionally [42] and intentionally [6–8, 43, 44, 45]; [46, 47, 48] introduced into graphene
samples.
Chen et al. [6] performed an in-situ transport experiment in which the density of
vacancy defects in graphene is controllably tuned during a single experimental run. In
the experiment, transport properties of graphene devices were measured in an ultra-high
vacuum environment while the devices were irradiated with low-energy inert gas ions to
create vacancy defects. These defects are found to diminish the mobility of graphene
and are four times as effective as the same amount of charged impurities (see Fig. 2.7),
and produce a linear conductivity as a function of carrier density, consistent with the
theory of resonant scatterers [5]. In another in-situ transport experiment performed in an
ultra-high vacuum [44], atomic hydrogen was introduced to the graphene device at low
temperature. It was found that the formation energy of the H—C bond on the basal
plane for substrate-bounded single-layer graphene was small. The majority of absorbed
hydrogen readily desorbs if the sample is warmed to room temperature. This experiment
suggests that additional energy from electron beam irradiation or plasma bombardment

might be crucial for ex-situ experiments to achieve hydrogenation of graphene at room
temperature. (Here “ex-situ” means creating hydrogenation and measuring transport
properties of the sample with two different apparatus, with likely exposure to air
between the two experimental steps.)
The ex-situ experimental ﬁndings of hydrogenated graphene and ﬂuorinated
graphene are similar. Temperature-dependent resistivity of hydrogenated graphene [7]
and ﬂuorinated graphene [8] are both consistent with variable range hopping, with the
hopping temperature T0 tunable by carrier density. Magneto-transport of hydrogenated
graphene [49] and ﬂuorinated graphene [45] both show negative magneto resistance
near charge neutrality.
Chen et al. [50] studied the temperature-dependent resistivity of graphene with
vacancy defects. After subtracting the effects of weak localization and an enhanced
electron–electron interaction [51], a tunable Kondo effect is found in which resistivity at
all carrier concentrations goes through a logarithmic divergence at around the Kondo
temperature and saturates at the low temperature. The normalized resistivity to tempera-
ture curves at all carrier concentrations follows the universal Kondo behavior. Hong
et al. [52] studied the low ﬁeld magneto resistance of ﬂuorinated graphene at high
carrier density and extracted an anomalous electron dephasing time, which is attributed
to the existence of magnetic impurities. McCreary et al. [53] studied the spin-polarized
transport of the graphene spin valve. They found an anomalous V-shape in the non-local
resistivity versus magnetic ﬁeld curve around the zero magnetic ﬁeld and attributed the
observation to the existence of non-correlated magnetic impurities after hydrogenation
of the graphene samples.
2.4
Corrugations of the Graphene Sheet
Another proposal to explain the linear σ(n) has been the effect of geometric corrugation
of graphene (i.e. “ripples”) present due to contact with a rough substrate [18, 54] or
Fig. 2.7 The inverse mobility as a function of ion dosage (proportional to defect density) of
graphene samples under four different experimental runs. The predicted effects for the same

graphene’s “intrinsic” rippling [55], or as a result of proposed thermally activated out-
of-plane motion of the graphene sheet [56, 57], or the presence of local modiﬁcation of
the bonding in graphene [58]. Katsnelson and Geim [57] have suggested that ripples in
graphene produce a conductivity of the form
σcorr n
ð Þ ¼ Ccorren2H1,
(2.11)
where Ccorr is a constant which is proportional to R=z
ð
Þ2, where R is the radius of the
ripples, and z is the height of the ripples, and the exponent 2H is given by the
dependence on the distance r of the height–height correlation function of a corrugated
surface, e.g. g rð Þ / r2H at small r, where g rð Þ ¼
h r0 þ r
ð

[18]. In this
scenario, scattering by ripples would produce a linear σ(n) for 2H = 2, a situation that
would, in principle, occur for equilibrium ﬂuctuations of a ﬂexible membrane in a planar
conﬁning potential [59]; or produce a constant σ(n) for 2H = 1, typical of the much more
common case of a non-equilibrium structure with short-range correlations [60]; or
produce a conductivity which has very weak density dependence, for 1< 2H < 2.
The magnitude of the scattering from ripples can be estimated by Ccorr. Cullen et al.
[19, 61] pointed out that the relationship, Ccorr / r=z
ð
Þ2 can be better formulated as
Ccorr / qA q
ð Þ
ð
Þ2, where q is the wavevector of the Fourier spectrum of the corruga-
tion, and A(q) is the Fourier amplitude which is a function of q. Cullen et al. argued that
the maximum value of qA(q), readily obtained from the Fourier spectrum, should set an
upper bound to the additional resistivity associated with the rippling of graphene
[19, 61].

For substrate-bound graphene devices, however, in addition to the LA phonon in
graphene, the polar optical phonons of the SiO2 substrate are also expected to scatter
electrons in graphene through surface polar phonon scattering [13, 62, 63, 64]. The two
strongest surface optical phonon modes in SiO2 are calculated to have ħω  59 meV
and 155 meV, with a ratio of coupling to the electrons of 1:6.5 [13, 63]. Surface polar
phonon results in long-ranged potential, which gives rise to density-dependent resistiv-
ity in graphene, similar to charged impurity scattering. Speciﬁcally, in the simplest case,
the electron–phonon matrix |Hkk0|2 element is proportional to q–1, where q is the

where CPO is a constant deﬁning the strength of the scattering, α is the exponent on the
density dependence, both of which can be experimentally determined; the terms in the
brackets are the Bose–Einstein terms from the two strong polar optical phonons and
the coupling ratio of 1:6.5 is determined by the oscillator strength and energy of these

Chen et al. [14] measured the temperature-dependent resistivity of pristine graphene
devices in an ultra-high vacuum environment and between 16 K and 490 K. Two
temperature-dependent components (ρA and ρB) of the resistivity were extracted. ρA is
density independent and linearly dependent on temperature, which dominates below
200 K; ρB has an activated behavior that is dependent on carrier density, which
dominates above 200 K. By examining the details of Eqs. (2.12) and (2.13), Chen
et al. conﬁrmed that ρA ¼ ρLA and ρB ¼ ρPO. The ﬁndings point to an important
conclusion that phonons in graphene are fairly ineffective in scattering charge carriers,
which make graphene the most conductive material at room temperature at a techno-
logically relevant density of 1012 cm–2; the choice of device substrates, on the other
hand, is crucial in determining the room temperature performance of graphene devices
(see Fig. 2.8).
The drastic effect of substrate polar optical phonons as a scattering source for
graphene and carbon nanotube devices has been independently conﬁrmed by Raman
spectroscopy on graphene [65] and carbon nanotube [64, 66] ﬁeld-effect transistors

under large bias, and by large bias transport measurements [16]. It is worth noting that
the temperature-dependent resistivity of suspended graphene has shown an unexpected
gate voltage dependent on a temperature below 200 K [15], pointing to other
temperature-dependent mechanisms in suspended graphene, such as the interplay
between ﬂexural phonons in graphene and the strain of graphene from the application
of a back-gate electric ﬁeld [67].
To summarize, the resistivity of graphene can be decomposed into
ρ ¼ ρci þ ρsr þ ρmg þ ρLA þ ρPO þ ρcorr,
(2.14)
where the subscripts indicate the contributions due to charged impurities (ci), short-
range scatterers (sr), midgap states (mg), longitudinal acoustic phonons (LA), polar
optical phonons (PO), and surface corrugations (corr). Understanding the relative
strength of various scattering sources reveals the path for improving the mobility of
substrate-bounded graphene and other low-dimensional electronic materials.

Optical Properties of Graphene
Feng Wang and Sufei Shi
The two-dimensional graphene crystal exhibits fascinating electrical, mechanical, and
optical properties. In this brief review, we examine the distinctive behavior of light–
matter interactions in graphene. These interactions are surprisingly strong, rendering
optical spectroscopy a powerful tool for probing the unusual physics of graphene.
Indeed, it was the strong optical absorption of single-layer graphene (with its
absorbance of ~2.3%, as discussed below) that permitted the initial discovery of exfoli-
ated monolayers by visual inspection under an optical microscope. In particular, the
optical transitions in graphene can be controlled through electrical and magnetic ﬁelds,
nanostructuring, and layer–layer interactions.
Optical spectroscopy provides a powerful and versatile tool for probing the unique
physics of various condensed matter systems and graphene in particular. The light–
matter interaction in graphene is remarkably strong, which enables the observation of
a broad range of unusual optical phenomena. It is interesting to note that the strong
light–matter interaction allowed for seeing graphene, a monolayer of carbon atoms, with
the naked eye under an optical microscope. This capability played a key role in the
initial discovery of exfoliated graphene in 2004 [1].
The strong coupling between light and graphene originates from the delocalized
π-orbital of graphene electrons [2, 3, 4]. Optical spectroscopy offers a sensitive probe
of elementary excitations in graphene, ranging from electron–hole pairs and cyclotrons
to phonons and plasmons. In addition, the light–matter interaction in graphene can be
controlled through electrical gating [5, 6, 7], structural engineering [8, 9], and coupling
between graphene layers [10]. This controllability provides exciting opportunities both
for systematic understanding of graphene physics, and for technological applications in
tunable photonics and optoelectronics.
In the last few years, tremendous advances have been made in optical spectroscopy
study of graphene. Broadly speaking, the studies can be divided into two categories
based on the employed experimental techniques: (1) optical transmission/reﬂection
spectroscopy that probes elastic optical process and (2) Raman spectroscopy that probes
inelastic optical processes. Below we provide an introduction to optical transmission/
reﬂection spectroscopy of graphene, and Raman scattering will be covered in a
separate chapter.
Absorption/reﬂection spectroscopy is a basic but powerful optical technique. It
yields direct information on the energy excitation spectrum of a system, and has long
been an indispensable tool for atomic, molecular, and solid state physics. With the

advent of modern lasers and synchrotron light sources, which provide tunable phonons
ranging from the infrared and visible to ultra-violet and X-ray spectral ranges, absorp-
tion/reﬂection spectroscopy has becoming even more powerful in probing a wide range
of elementary excitations [11]. In graphene research, absorption/reﬂection spectro-
scopy with infrared to visible and ultra-violet light has been most successful, because
photons energy in this spectrum range match nicely with many important elementary
excitations, including the interband [5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16] and intraband [7, 17,
18, 19] electronic transitions, Landau level transitions [20, 21, 22], and plasmon
excitations in graphene [8, 9]. Very often optical spectroscopy study of graphene is
employed in a microscopy conﬁguration so that one can readily probe exfoliated
graphene samples of micrometer sizes. For large-area graphene, such as those produced
through the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method [23, 24], micro-spectroscopy is
less of a necessity, but can still be valuable when examining spatial variation in optical
properties in large-area samples.
In this chapter, we will describe the unique tunable optical properties of graphene:
(Section 3.1) Tunable Interband and Intraband Transitions in Electrically Gated
Graphene; (Section 3.2) Landau Level Transitions in Graphene under a Magnetic Field;
(Section 3.3) Plasmon Excitation in Graphene; (Section 3.4) Optical Transitions in
Bilayer and Multilayer Graphene.

Gated Graphene
3.1.1
Optical Absorption in Pristine Graphene
The electronic structure of graphene can be well approximated by the linear Dirac
cone close to the Fermi energy, where the conduction and valence bands touch at the
Dirac point (Fig. 3.1(a)). Interband absorption [5] arises from direct optical transitions
between the valence and conduction bands. At frequencies above the far-infrared region,
these interband transitions typically deﬁne the optical response of graphene. Within the
tight-binding model, the optical sheet conductivity from interband transitions can be
readily calculated [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]. For pristine graphene at zero temperature,
the optical conductivity in the linear dispersion regime of graphene is found to be
independent of frequency. The corresponding “universal” conductance of graphene is
determined solely by fundamental constants and assumes the value of σ ω
ð Þ ¼ πe2
2h [15,
25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33]. This conductivity corresponds to an absorbance of
A ω
ð Þ ¼ 4π
c σ ω
ð Þ ¼ πα  2:29% [15, 32], where α denotes the ﬁne structure constant.
Figure 3.1(b) shows the frequency-dependent absorbance for three different graphene
samples for photon energies between 0.5 and 1.2 eV. Over this spectral range, different
samples show equivalent responses, not inﬂuenced by the detailed nature of the sample
or its environment. Moreover, the absorbance is largely frequency independent, with an
averaged value over the speciﬁed spectral range of A ¼ 2:28  0:14

the universal value of πα = 2.29% [15, 34]. The slight departure from a completely

frequency-independent behavior, which becomes more pronounced at higher photon
energies, is due to a deviation from the linear electronic band at high energy in graphene.
The independence of the interband optical absorption on both frequency and the
material properties (as encoded in the Fermi velocity vF) can be understood in several
ways. In general terms, it can be explained by dimensional analysis, since the graphene
Hamiltonian describing the linear bands has no intrinsic energy scale with which to
compare the photon energy. More directly, in terms of a calculation of the absorption in
perturbation theory, we note the perfect cancellation of the ω and vF dependence in the
three important parameters – the square of the transition matrix element / v2

3.1.2
Gate-Tunable Interband Optical Transitions
Electrical doping can dramatically modify optical absorption in graphene. Because of
the single-atom thickness of graphene and its linear dispersion with high Fermi velocity,
the Fermi energy in graphene can be shifted by hundreds of meV through electrostatic
gating. Such doping leads to a strong change in the interband absorption through Pauli
blocking. As shown in Fig. 3.2(a), the interband transitions for photon energies below
2 ϵF
j
j are suppressed, while those at energies above 2 ϵF
j
j are unaffected. The optical
response in graphene thus becomes highly tunable.
Experimentally, the doping level can be tuned electrostatically in a ﬁeld-effect
transistor (FET) conﬁguration by applying gating voltage across a SiO2 dielectric or
an electrolyte layer. The doping concentration of the former structure is typically limited
to e5  1012 cm2 by the breakdown of the oxide layer, while electrolyte gating can

change in the optical transmission as a function of photon energy induced using gating
with ionic liquid electrolyte. Increased optical transmission arising from Pauli blocking
is observed up to a threshold characterized by a photon energy of 2 ϵF
j
j. With increased
carrier doping, this threshold energy shifts to a higher value, as expected. Using ionic
liquid gating, one can reach a threshold energy above 1.7 eV, thus accessing the visible
spectral range. Quantitatively, optical absorption in doped graphene can be described by

The tunability of the interband transitions in graphene offers new possibilities for
probing fundamental physics and for various technological applications [5, 6, 38]. In
addition, the underlying Pauli blocking process provides a direct approach to measuring
the Fermi energy in graphene without the need of any electrical contacts. The threshold

Gate-Tunable Intraband Optical Absorption
Since the speed of light c is much higher than the Fermi velocity vF of graphene (c/vF
~ 300) [39, 40], direct absorption of a photon by an intraband optical transition does not
satisfy momentum conservation. To conserve momentum, extra scattering with phonons
or defects, as shown in Fig. 3.3(a), is required. The simplest description of the optical
response of free carriers is then captured by a Drude model for the frequency-dependent
sheet conductivity

Far-infrared spectroscopy can be used to probe the intraband absorption in large-area
graphene grown by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method [23, 24]. In Fig. 3.3
(b), we show the free-carrier absorption spectra of graphene at different doping levels
[37]. These spectra ﬁt reasonably well using the Drude form, consistent with theoretical
calculations based on the Kubo formalism that ignore many-body interactions [27, 29,
33]. The Drude scattering rates for different gate voltages are shown in Fig. 3.3(c). The
different electron and hole scattering rates suggest that they experience different defect

(b) Change in the optical sheet conductivity of graphene in the infrared range is controlled by
electrostatic gating, which is at –1.0 V, –1.8 V, –2.2 V for the curves from left to right. In the

near-infrared, Pauli blocking of interband transitions can be used to determine the Fermi energy.

which corresponds to a momentum relaxation lifetime of ~50 fs.
From the Drude ﬁt of the spectra in Fig. 3.3(b), we can obtain the free-carrier (or

lower value than Dinter. We note that the Drude weight of intraband absorption should
equal the reduction of interband absorption oscillator strength, as required by the sum
rule. This is conﬁrmed in Fig. 3.3(e). The measured reduction in Dintra is, therefore,
correlated to the imperfect Pauli blocking [6] of interband transitions at energies
below 2ϵF.

Landau Level Transitions in Graphene under a Magnetic Field
Massless Dirac electrons in graphene have unique Landau level (LL) structures in a
magnetic ﬁeld. They give rise to an extraordinary “half-integer” quantum Hall effect
[39, 40], the observation of which ﬁrst ignited worldwide interest in graphene.
In traditional 2D materials with parabolic band dispersions, the Landau level energies
are equally spaced and are described by
En ¼ n þ 1=2
ð
Þℏωc ¼ n þ 1=2
ð
ÞℏeB=m,
where ωc is the cyclotron frequency, n is the LL index, and m the electron effective
mass. The linear dispersion relation in graphene, however, leads to an unequally spaced
LL spectrum En ¼ sgn n

, where vF is the electron Fermi velocity, and
n>0 or n<0 represents electrons or holes, respectively. Most unusually, a LL at zero
energy (n = 0) with zero doping exists, and this level is characterized by a distinctive
electron–hole degeneracy. Each of the LLs has four-fold degeneracy due to the spin and
valley degrees of freedom. These unique Landau level structures in graphene can be
probed directly using infrared spectroscopy. Infrared spectroscopy probes transitions
between different Landau level states. Such infrared transitions have to satisfy speciﬁc
selection rules, i.e. Δ nj j ¼ 1, due to angular momentum conservation [22]. Fig. 3.4(b)
displays the experimental data of normalized infrared transmission spectra through a
graphene sample in different magnetic ﬁelds. The electron density is controlled so that
Fermi energy lies between the –1 and 0 LL. Two transmission minima T1 and T2 are
readily observable. The T1 resonance corresponds to the n  1 ! n ¼ 0 intraband LL
transition, and the T2 resonance arises from the degenerate interband n ¼ 1 ! n ¼ 2
and n ¼ 2 ! n ¼ 1 transitions. The LL transition energy scales linearly with

expected from the LL structure described previously. A careful examination of the

The Landau level transitions lead not only to strong absorption at the resonances, but
also appreciable corresponding phase shift dictated by the Kramers–Kronig relations.
Selection rules for LL infrared transitions require that different infrared transitions can
only be excited by light with speciﬁc circular polarizations. As a result, strong circular
dichorism and Faraday rotation of infrared light arise from graphene LL transitions, as
demonstrated recently in [20, 46].

Plasmon Excitations in Graphene
Plasmons are quanta of collective oscillations of charge carriers. They are important for
understanding the dynamic response of electron systems and for developing optical
metamaterials [47, 48, 49]. Plasmons of Dirac electrons in graphene are predicted to
exhibit behavior distinctly different, not only from electrons in bulk materials, but also
from their counterparts in conventional 2D electron gas (2DEG) systems [26, 50, 51].

Direct light absorption by propagating plasmons in graphene ﬁlm is not allowed
due to the large momentum mismatch between photons and plasmons. However,
plasmon absorption can be enabled with grating coupling, which provides an effective
momentum due to the periodic grating structure. Alternatively, one can utilize localized
plasmon resonances in graphene structures with sizes smaller than the relevant wave-
lengths. L. Ju et al. demonstrated that strong optical resonances from localized
plasmons could be achieved in patterned arrays of graphene ribbons of micron widths
[8]. Standard photolithography and oxygen plasma etching were employed to prepare
the required microribbon array from large-area CVD graphene. The optical response
of the graphene microribbon arrays was probed using polarized Fourier-Transform
Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). For light polarized along the length of the ribbon, the
absorption spectrum is characterized by a Drude response similar to that in bulk
graphene sheets. For light polarized perpendicular to the length of the ribbon, however,
prominent localized plasmon resonances are observed. The coupling between light and
the graphene plasmons is remarkably strong, with achievable oscillator strength of an
order of magnitude larger than that in conventional semiconducting 2DEGs. This
difference originates from a low effective electron mass and the much higher doping
levels attainable in graphene.
The localized plasmon resonance in graphene can be modiﬁed through electrostatic
doping. Figure 3.5(b) shows the gate-dependent absorption associated with excitation of
these localized plasmons. The plasmon resonance is observed to become stronger, and
its frequency to blue shift with increasing carrier density. The relation between the
frequency of the plasmon resonance and the carrier concentration is found to scale as
ωp / n1=4 / ϵF
j
j1=2. This scaling law, contrary to the n1=2 dependence for conventional
2DEGs [52, 53], is characteristic of Dirac electrons.
One can control the localized plasmon resonance by modifying the spatial patterning
of the graphene array. Figure 3.5(c) displays the plasmon resonances in graphene

microribbons with different widths but the same carrier concentration. We see that the
plasmon frequency increases with decreasing ribbon width according to ωp / w1=2.
Unlike the variation with carrier density, this geometric scaling arises from electrostatics
and is obeyed by plasmon excitations in other 2D electron systems [26,50]. Tunable
graphene plasmon has also been achieved in arrays of graphene microdisks [9],
and real-space imaging of graphene plasmon has been achieved using near-ﬁeld
infrared nanoscopy.
3.4
Bilayer and Multilayer Graphene
There has been increasing interest in bilayer and multilayer graphene recently because
they offer the potential for controlling electronic states through interlayer coupling, and
bilayer and trilayer graphene can exhibit strong electron–electron interaction effects [54,
55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. It was demonstrated both theoretically and experimentally that
the electronic structure of bilayer and multilayer graphene are distinctly different from
that of the monolayer graphene: the characteristic linearly dispersing bands of the single
layer are either replaced or augmented by pairs of split hyperbolic bands. The much
richer electronic structures in bilayer and multilayer graphene give rise to many
fascinating new physical phenomena, ranging from strongly correlated ground state in
pristine bilayers to widely tunable electronic band gaps in electrically gated bilayer and
multilayer graphene.
When graphene layers are stacked together, they can assume different stacking
orders. The most energetically favorable order is the so-called Bernel stacking, as
typically found in natural graphite. Most exfoliated graphene samples tend to inherit
this Bernel stacking. Graphene synthesized through chemical vapor deposition and
epitaxial growth can have either Bernel stacking or random orders. In this review, we
will focus on the electronic structure and physical properties of Bernel stacked bilayer
and multilayer graphene.
The electronic structure of few-layer graphene has been investigated experimentally
using optical spectroscopy [16, 32, 61] and ARPES [62]. Figure 3.6(a) displays a
systematic set of infrared absorption spectra from single-layer to eight-layer graphene
over the photon-energy range of 0.2–0.9 eV [32]. It shows that the graphene absorption
(or equivalently the optical conductivity) scales linearly with the layer number N at
higher energies (above 0.8 eV). At low energy, however, graphene absorption exhibits
highly structured and readily distinguishable spectral features for different layer thick-
nesses. The absorption spectrum evolution as a function of layer number can be
visualized from a contour plot of the normalized conductivity spectra for all the samples
of layer thicknesses. The absorption peaks correspond to principle transitions across the
conduction and valence subbands in few-layer graphene. There is a systematic depend-
ence of the principle transition energies on the layer number N, as illustrated by the solid
curves in Fig. 3.6(b). This systematic evolution of subband principle transitions can be
understood through zone-folding of the 3D graphite band structure: one can decompose
the electronic structure of few-layer graphene into chiral massless and massive
46

components with characteristics, such as masses and Fermi velocities, that depend
critically on the layer number N. In particular, both massless and massive components
are present if N is odd, while only massive components exist if N is even [10]. The
highly structured infrared spectra of few-layer graphene corroborate the richness their
electronic structure.
The rich electronic structures of few-layer graphene can be further modiﬁed by
applying external electrical and magnetic ﬁelds. This control of the electronic structure
in few-layer graphene provides new opportunities in exploring graphene physics, as
exempliﬁed by the electrical studies of bilayer graphene over the past few years.
The electronic structure of a pristine AB stacking graphene bilayer (Fig. 3.6(d))
features two nearly parallel conduction bands and two nearly parallel valence bands
near the Fermi level. Remarkably, the lowest conduction and highest valance band
states are degenerate at the K-point, giving rise to a zero band gap in pristine graphene.

3.4 Bilayer and Multilayer Graphene
004
14 Aug 2017 at 14:27:55, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

The energy degeneracy of the K-point states is protected by the inversion symmetry of
the AB stacked bilayer graphene. This symmetry, however, can be lifted by applying an
electrical ﬁeld perpendicular to the graphene plane. It offers the possibility to continu-
ously vary the electronic band gap in bilayer graphene through electronic gating.
Speciﬁcally, electrical gating have two important effects, which can be described in
terms of the top and bottom electrical displacement ﬁelds Dt and Db: the average of the
two, 〈D〉= (Db + Dt)/2, breaks the inversion symmetry of the bilayer and generates a
non-zero band gap (Δ) [63, 64, 65] (Fig. 3.6(h)), while the difference in the two, ΔD =
Db – Dt, leads to a net carrier doping, i.e., a shift of the Fermi energy (EF).
Such electronic structure control of bilayer graphene was ﬁrst demonstrated in
ARPES studies of chemically doped epitaxial graphene [62]. The bilayer graphene
was synthesized on a silicon carbide substrate, and the ﬁeld control was achieved by
chemical adsorption of potassium atoms. Figures 3.6(e)–(g) displayed the evolution of
the bilayer band gap at different doping levels from potassium adsorption. As the
prepared bilayer is electron doped from the substrate, it corresponds to a ﬁnite Db and
zero Dt, leading to a ﬁnite band gap and doping. Potassium adsorption generates a ﬁnite
Dt. When its value is the same as Db, one obtains an electron doped bilayer graphene
with zero band gap. Further increasing potassium adsorption and Dt, causes a ﬁnite band
gap to reappear with even stronger electron doping [66].
To explore new physics and device applications of bilayer graphene, a continuously
tunable band gap through electrical gating is desirable. Such a tunable band gap through
electrical gating was later demonstrated using infrared spectroscopy, either through moni-
toring the gate-induced change in the valence to conduction band optical transitions or
through investigating the changes in splitting of higher energy transitions [14,61]. Both
studies yield a similar dependence on the bilayer band gap as a function of the average
displacement ﬁeld 〈D〉[16]. However, observing this band gap has been challenging for
electrical transport measurements. Indeed, electrical transport of a gated bilayer in the ﬁrst
electrical study exhibits an insulating behavior only at temperatures below 1 K [67],
suggesting a much lower band-gap value. This is because electrical transport is extremely
sensitive to defects and impurities, and very high-quality graphene is required to reach the
intrinsic bilayer graphene behavior. Recent transport studies [68] have demonstrated a
“transport band gap” closer to that obtained through optical spectroscopy.

Introduction
The mechanical strength and reliability of materials have long been of fundamental
concern. In the ﬁrst recorded quantitative study of the strength of materials, Leonardo da
Vinci [1] measured the breaking force of ropes of progressively shorter lengths. Galileo
Galilei [2] introduced the concept of stress when he reported fracture strength under
tension to be independent of the length and proportional to the cross-sectional area.
Later Edme Mariotte [3] observed that “a long rope and a short one always support the
same weight, unless that in a long rope there may happen to be some faulty place in
which it will break sooner than in a shorter.” Thus was established a stress-based
perspective of material failure where imperfections or defects in a material play a
central, but qualitative, role in determining material strength.
No further conceptual progress occurred until 1921 when Grifﬁth postulated that
microscopic cracks lead to rupture when the potential energy released in crack growth is
sufﬁcient to overcome the energetic cost of creating the new surface area [4]. Using this
thermodynamic analysis, he showed that the critical rupture stress at which cracks
propagate increases with elastic stiffness and surface free energy, and decreases with
crack size. Based on this realization, Grifﬁth postulated that the surest way to decrease
the size of a defect is to decrease the size of the material that contains the defect: in the
limit of a one-dimensional chain of atoms, the defect density would be zero and the
material would possess its intrinsic strength, which is the maximum stress a pristine (i.e.
defect-free, or at least a vanishingly small defect density) material can withstand
without failure. In that spirit, Grifﬁth devised a set of experiments to measure the
breaking stress of drawn glass rods of progressively decreasing diameter. Extrapolating
his measurements to a diameter of one atomic unit, he estimated the intrinsic strength of
glass to be E=9, where E is Young’s modulus (i.e. linear elastic stiffness under uniaxial
stress). Thus, the intrinsic strength represents the upper strength limit of the material and
is fundamentally related to the strength of its interatomic bonds.
The main roadblock to the measurement of intrinsic strength has been the inability to
isolate sufﬁciently large specimens of pristine materials to carry out mechanical tests.
The isolation of lower-dimensional materials offers a unique opportunity to investigate
a greatly simpliﬁed system in which many types of defects cannot exist, so the
likelihood of isolating a pristine material sample increases. In particular, graphene
and other two-dimensional materials are ideal for this purpose: they lack surface defects

present in three-dimensional materials (except at their one-dimensional edges), and are
less sensitive to single point defects than one-dimensional materials such as carbon
nanotubes. Thus, the ability to experimentally probe and model two-dimensional
materials from a ﬁrst-principle perspective opens the door to understanding the physics
of deformation of materials in a more general setting.
This chapter discusses the experimental methods used to mechanically test
graphene, the development of a non-linear anisotropic elastic multiscale model to
understand its state under arbitrary deformation, and the validation of the multiscale
model by the experiments with consideration of the instabilities that lead to failure. At
the end of the chapter, these methods are applied to defective graphene to explore
the effect of point and line defect types. These results unveil graphene’s excellent
mechanical properties.
4.2
Experiments
Traditionally, uniaxial tension tests are used to determine Young’s modulus and the
breaking stress of a material. However, a tension test is not ideal for two-dimensional
materials, primarily because any ﬂaw or crack at the edges of a sheet will lead to
fracture at stresses far below the intrinsic strength. Therefore, as can be seen in Fig. 4.1,
we have implemented a different approach based on indentation of a circular membrane
at its center. This scheme has a number of advantages. Since the stress decreases
roughly inversely with distance from the center, the area under large stress is minimized
and therefore the sensitivity to defects is lessened. For the same reason, relatively weak
Van der Waals adhesion is sufﬁcient to clamp the membrane at its edge even up to
fracture, and the test is insensitive to edge defects. Finally, analysis is simpliﬁed due to
the cylindrical symmetry.
Mechanical testing specimens can be readily fabricated by placing a graphene ﬁlm on
top of a substrate that contains circular holes or wells. The freestanding membranes are
then deformed with a nanoindenter or AFM, while recording the deﬂection and force at
the indenter tip. Representative force–deﬂection responses can be seen in Fig. 4.2.

Typically, the indenter tip radii (R) range from 15 to 35 nm and the membrane radii (a)
range from 0.5 to 1.5 μm. The AFM experiments are performed with permutations of
AFM tips of radii 16.5 and 27.5 nm and specimens of radii 1.0 and 1.5 μm [6].
During an experiment, the indenter tip ﬁrst indents the specimen center cyclically to
progressively increasing depths. In most samples, negligible hysteresis is observed,
leading to two important conclusions. First, good adhesion exists between the graphene
and the substrate, suggesting negligible displacements at the specimen periphery.
Second, the material deformation is reversible and characteristic of an elastic material
whose behavior is fully deﬁned by a strain energy density potential function. In the few
samples showing hysteresis, subsequent AFM imaging reveals slippage to be the cause.
On non-hysteretic specimens, the load on the indenter tip is subsequently increased until
the graphene ruptures. Characteristic AFM scans of the suspended membrane before
and after rupture are shown in the inset of Fig. 4.2. It is worth noting that during initial
attempts to break these suspended membranes, silicon AFM tips used in the original
experiments fractured before membrane rupture. Therefore, diamond indenter tips with
a known tip radius of curvature are used in the experiments.
Representative force-deﬂection curves for the four permutations of tip and specimen
radii are shown in Fig. 4.2. The force-deﬂection response changes with specimen radius
a but is independent of indenter tip radius R: since R  ɑ, the force–deﬂection behavior
can be treated as deﬂection of a membrane under point loading. Furthermore, the force
on the indenter tip at graphene rupture is a function of the indenter tip radius and not the
specimen radius, which suggests that rupture is governed by the details of the stress
concentration within the portion of the graphene specimen in contact with the indenter
tip. Thus, the experimental protocol has the added advantage of separating the analysis
of deformation and fracture.

The graphene ﬁlm can be analyzed as an axisymmetric membrane (i.e. ﬁnite stretch-
ing stiffness but negligible bending stiffness) with a central load point and vanishing
displacements at the peripheral boundary. Assuming isotropic linear elastic mechanical

Þ ¼ 1:02 is a dimensionless constant that depends on
ν, Poisson’s ratio (taken here as 0.165, the Poisson’s ratio for graphite in the basal plane
[7]). Since graphene is a true two-dimensional material, its thickness is indeterminate.
Thus, the units of the E2D and σ2D

are force/length rather than force/area which is
appropriate for a three-dimensional material. Below we normalize E2D and σ2D

by the
interplanar distance between graphite basal planes to express the elastic stiffness and
pre-stress in effective three-dimensional values.
Histograms from two sample populations (AFM and nanoindentation measurements)
of the value of E2D obtained through ﬁtting Eq. (4.1) to experimental data are obtained
by mechanical exfoliation of graphite. Looking ahead at Fig. 4.5, it is crucial to ﬁt the
data from only about two-thirds of the indentation depth to failure with Eq. (4.1).
Equation (4.1) is not sufﬁcient for large indentation depths and will result in inaccurate
calculations of the 2D Young’s modulus and pre-stress. Sixty-seven AFM responses
from 23 ﬂakes as well as 88 nanoindentation responses from 34 ﬂakes are taken to
adequately capture the statistics of each population. Both the AFM and nanoindentation
histograms adopt a normal distribution, with mean values of E2D ¼ 340  50 N=m [6]
and E2D ¼ 324  13 N=m [5], respectively. The Student t-test reveals no statistically
signiﬁcant difference between the two populations. Figure 4.3(a) shows the histogram
of the value of E2D from the nanoindentation measurements. This value corresponds to
1.0 TPa, consistent with measured values ranging from 1.02 to 1.09 TPa in the basal
planes of graphite [7] and a value of 1.00 TPa in CNTs [8].
As discussed above, the force on the indenter tip at rupture is predominantly a
function of the radius of curvature of the indenter tip. Graphene is a brittle material in
the sense that it fails catastrophically upon rupture initiation. In conventional brittle
materials, it is not possible to assign a deterministic value to the rupture strength since
defect size, shape, and density can typically only be described in a probabilistic sense.
This led Weibull [9, 10, 11] to postulate a probabilistic description based upon defect
densities, in which the cumulative probability distribution function is given by

abruptness of the transition from P ¼ 0 to P ¼ 1 is determined by the value of the
Weibull modulus. The limit m ! ∞gives a sharp step and corresponds physically to the
rupture behavior of a defect-free material where the failure mechanism is activated at
the intrinsic strength.
When treating the variable F as stress, assuming linear elastic behavior under the
indenter, the Weibull modulus for AFM data similar to Fig. 4.3(b) is m  30, which
indicates a very narrow probability distribution. This value is much larger than seen for

which is less than 0.05% of the total area of the specimen when accounting for non-
linear anisotropic elastic properties.
We now consider the plausibility of obtaining a defect-free specimen suitable for
mechanical testing. Graphene is a 2D material so it can contain only 0D and 1D defects.
However, the exfoliated specimens are single crystals [15] so they can contain only 0D
defects, of which atomic vacancies would have the largest effect on strength. The
probability of an atomic vacancy is pv ¼ exp hf =kT


, where hf is the enthalpy of
formation of an atomic vacancy at constant pressure, k is the Boltzmann constant, and T
is the temperature at which the graphene is formed [16]. Given hf ¼ 7:4 eV [17] for
graphite, the probability of an atomic vacancy in the graphite prior to exfoliation of the
graphene layers is exceedingly small. In agreement with this analysis, scanning tunnel-
ing microscopy (STM) studies of graphene (obtained from the same kish graphite
source and prepared using the same methods as in our study) have found no point
defects or dislocations over areas of hundreds of square nanometers [15].
We now return to the histogram in Fig. 4.3(b) of breaking force for both indenter tip
radii. For pristine graphene, the force on the indenter at rupture is a function only of
indenter tip radius, so the force at rupture would be constant for a given indenter. Thus,
the distribution in the rupture force in Fig. 4.3(b) is due to instrument error alone, which
is consistent with the observed normal distributions.

In order to determine the breaking strength from the measured fracture force, it is
necessary to model the response of the membrane under tension to determine the
maximum stress in the experiment. In our original work [6], we realized that a simple
linear-elastic model was insufﬁcient and added a (negative) quadratic term as an
adjustable parameter in a radially isotropic description of graphene’s in-plane deform-
ation. In this way, the intrinsic strength could be determined as the maximum point of
the stress-strain curve. Finite element modeling was then used for comparative experi-
ment; assuming fracture at the intrinsic strength allowed determination of the quadratic
term, with intrinsic strength of 42 N=m (130 GPa). As will be discussed later and seen
in Fig. 4.5, this constitutive model is still insufﬁcient and the calculated strength is an
overestimate. The accurate intrinsic strength turns out to be 34:5 N=m (103 GPa) with
the appropriate model [5]. Subsequently, we expanded this analysis to go beyond the
simple quadratic and isotropic description to create a constitutive model that describes
the non-linear and anisotropic elastic response of graphene under arbitrary in-plane
tensile deformations. This model, based on both a non-linear continuum description and
ab initio calculations, allows for straightforward implementation in ﬁnite element
modeling and provides excellent agreement with experiments.
4.3
Non-linear and Anisotropic Response of Graphene
In principle, all crystalline materials have non-linear stress versus strain elastic
responses for sufﬁciently large strains. Typically, however, defects activate inelastic
deformation mechanisms (such as plastic deformation via dislocation motion or fracture
via crack propagation) prior to non-linear elastic deformation. As we have seen above,
however, for pristine graphene we must account for the non-linear elastic behavior.
The work done on an homogeneously loaded specimen can also be written as
dw ¼ σ dε, where w ¼ W=V0 is the work per unit original volume V0, or the work
density. Any such pair of stress and strain measures (here suitable for inﬁnitesimally
small deformations) is said to be work conjugate. The expression for work density can
be readily generalized to dw ¼ σij dεij where the i and j indices refer to components of
the second-rank stress and strain tensors. In this formulation, we consider only in-plane
deformations within the sheet of graphene and neglect all out-of-plane bending contri-
butions to the elastic strain energy density potential, so that the values of the i and j
range over 1 to 2, where x1 is the zig-zag direction and x2 is the armchair direction.
Figure 4.4(a) shows these coordinate directions with respect to graphene’s crystal
lattice. The summation convention holds when the same index appears twice in an
expression. In elastic materials under adiabatic conditions, this work is stored as elastic
strain energy which can be recovered upon unloading. Thus an elastic strain energy
density potential function, ψ, exists that is deﬁned for inﬁnitesimal deformations as
dψ ¼ σij dεij where ψ has units of energy per unit original volume and represents the
thermodynamic internal energy density. Rearranging this expression, the elastic energy
density potential function determines the stress in an elastic material as a function of the
deformation state by the expression σij ¼ ∂ψ=∂εij where all but one strain component

remains constant while taking the derivative. The fourth-rank elastic stiffness tensor is
determined by the second derivative Cijkl ¼ ∂2ψ=∂εij ∂εkl. For a linear elastic material,
described by Hooke’s Law as σij ¼ Cijkl εkl, the elastic strain energy density potential is
quadratic in strain as ψ ¼ 1
2 Cijkl εij εkl.
The most common method to describe ψ is to choose a mathematical expression
derived from a mechanistic model or phenomenological description, and then ﬁt free
parameters in the model to experiment [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. However, such a
phenomenological approach is unnecessary for graphene. Instead, we expand the elastic
strain energy density potential in a Taylor series in powers of strain as

where we employ the Green–Lagrange strain measure, ηij, which together with its work
conjugate the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress measure, P

quantities relative to the undeformed reference conﬁguration [18]. The Green–Lagrange

, where F is the deformation gradient and I is
the identity tensor. The second Piola–Kirchhoff stress is related to the more commonly
used true or Cauchy stress measure, σ (e.g. force per unit current area or length) by

J FΣFT, where J is the determinant of F. As before, the stress state is calculated
from P
ij ¼ ∂ψ=∂ηij and the tangent modulus (i.e. the slope of the stress–strain behavior)
is calculated from the second derivative of ψ with respect to ηij. The zeroth- and ﬁrst-
order terms of the Taylor series are neglected because they do not contribute to the
second derivative and hence the elastic response. The quadratic term describes a linear
elastic material and the higher-order terms introduce the non-linearity. As discussed
below, a ﬁfth-order expansion is necessary to accurately describe the behavior of
graphene to breaking load, so that the stress–strain relationship becomes

The number of non-zero and independent tensor components in the terms above is
determined by the symmetry elements in the D6h point group that describes graphene’s
crystal lattice, which consists of a six-fold rotational axis and six mirror planes. There
are two independent components (that can be expressed as Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio) in the second-order elastic constants (SOEC) Cijkl, three in the
third-order elastic constants (TOEC) Cijklmn, four in the fourth-order elastic constants
(FOEC) Cijklmnop and ﬁve in the ﬁfth-order elastic constants (FFOEC) Cijklmnopqr, for a
total of 14 independent elastic constants [18]. The challenge of describing the elastic
strain energy potential function thus reduces to ﬁnding suitable values for the 14 inde-
pendent tensor components.
The general expression for stress in Eq. (4.4) is lengthy and unwieldy after the
summations are carried out. Therefore, we consider three simple deformation states:
uniaxial strain in the zig-zag direction and armchair direction, and equibiaxial strain.
In the case of uniaxial strain in the zig-zag direction, the graphene is strained with a
tensile value of η11 in the x1-direction while η22 ¼ η12 ¼ 0. The resulting stresses are

for which the response is isotropic because the symmetry elements are not broken as a
consequence of the applied deformation.
All 14 elastic constants appear in Eqs. (4.5)–(4.9). In principle, they could be
measured by devising suitable stress versus strain experiments with those deformation
states, but such an approach is extremely challenging. Therefore, we calculate the elastic
response using atomic scale calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). DFT
is used to calculate the response of graphene at discrete values of the three deformation
states discussed above, with the 14 elastic constants then determined by ﬁtting the
response with Eqs. (4.5)–(4.9) appropriately. While the primitive unit cell of graphene
consists of two atoms, calculations are performed here with a four atom unit cell (which
is outlined in Fig. 4.4(a)) for the convenience of the orthogonal coordinate system.
Homogeneous deformation states are prescribed by specifying the positions of the
boundaries of the unit cell, using periodic boundary conditions. The Vienna ab initio
simulation package (VASP) is employed in the calculations. Since DFT performs 3D
calculations, a large interplanar distance is chosen to eliminate interlayer interactions.
The equilibrium lattice constant determined from the minimum energy position of
atoms B within the unit cell is consistent with measured values within 0.5% [25, 26, 27].
The above deformation states are then calculated for a discrete number of strain
increments by setting the displacement of the atoms along the edge of the unit cell and
relaxing the inner atoms using a quasi-Newton method. The elastic strain energy density
is given by the total energy within the supercell divided by the initial volume. The
stresses in VASP are reported in the Cauchy stress measure which is later converted into
the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress measure by P ¼ JF1σ F1

T. Likewise, the
applied deformations are expressed in terms of the Green–Lagrange strain measure.
The stress versus strain results of the DFT analyses for the ﬁve cases corresponding to
Eqs. (4.5)–(4.9) are shown as discrete points in Fig. 4.4(b), with least-squares ﬁts shown
as solid lines. The 14 independent elastic constants given by this ﬁtting are reported in
Table 4.1. The ﬁts are excellent, indicating that further terms beyond the ﬁfth order are
unnecessary, whereas lower-order versions of Eq. (4.4) (e.g. in our previous analysis
and previous work demonstrating expansion to the cubic term [28]) are not sufﬁcient to
fully capture all ﬁve curves up to the maximum stress values.
The 2D linear isotropic elastic Young’s modulus and the Poisson’s ratio under the

0.169, respectively. These compare well with reported in-plane (basal plane) graphite values
and graphene values [7, 29]. The TOEC and FFOEC components are all negative, such that
graphene softens up to a point of maximum stress and after this point the stiffness is negative.
The elastic properties in Fig. 4.4(b) are both non-linear and anisotropic. The non-
linearity becomes signiﬁcant beyond about 5% strain and the anisotropy becomes
evident after about 15% strain. Another notable feature is the presence of peak stress
for each of the deformation states, which is interpreted as the intrinsic strength. The
DFT results indicate that the intrinsic strength itself is a function of the stress measure
and the deformation state. As can be seen in Fig. 4.4(b), when the stress is expressed in
the second Piola–Kirchhoff stress measure, the peak stress is 31:4 N=m (93.7 GPa) and
29:5 N=m (88.1 GPa) for uniaxial strain in the zig-zag and the armchair directions,
respectively, and is 33:1 N=m (98.8 GPa) for equibiaxial strain. When expressed in the
more fundamental Cauchy stress, those peak values are 38:6 N=m (115 GPa), 34:7 N=m
(104 GPa), and 33:1 N=m (98.8 GPa) for uniaxial strain in the zig-zag and the armchair
directions and equibiaxial strain, respectively.
Internal consistency of the higher-order continuum description is veriﬁed by comput-
ing deformation under uniaxial stress (as opposed to uniaxial strain). The results obtained
by the continuum description correspond closely with those obtained directly by DFT
calculation. The multiscale constitutive description is also compared to published ab
initio results [29] and showed very good correspondence for strains even up to 30%.

Experimental Validation
Validation of the non-linear anisotropic constitutive relation is achieved through imple-
mentation in ABAQUS ﬁnite element analysis (FEA) software to simulate the AFM and
nanoindentation experiments. Since R  ɑ the contribution of bending stress is negli-
gible compared to the in-plane stress, membrane elements are used to model the circular
graphene sheet to utilize their zero bending rigidity. The indenter tip is modeled as a
frictionless rigid sphere. The radius of the membrane and the indenter tip can easily be
adjusted to match the various experiments performed. A zero displacement boundary
condition is applied to the periphery of the membrane and the indenter incrementally

displaces the center of the membrane in a quasi-static manner at a constant velocity.
Due to the large kinematic and material non-linearity, the equilibrium of the graphene
membrane must be determined incrementally. The inset in Fig. 4.5 shows a representa-
tive cross section of the model during the simulation.
As the simulation progresses and the stress approaches a maximum, the solution no
longer numerically converges to equilibrium. This is a common issue in these types of
problems and is combated by introducing a small amount of viscosity in the constitutive
relation [31]. The negligible effect of the viscosity term on the solution in ABAQUS
was veriﬁed by comparing the response under uniaxial and equibiaxial strain with ab
initio calculations.
The constitutive model is validated against experiments by comparing the force-
deﬂection response and the maximum force at fracture. Excellent consistency is seen in
the force-deﬂection responses that is within the experimental error in Fig. 4.5 [30]. The
maximum force beneath the indenter tip at failure is 1.818 and 2.988 μN (for the 16.5
and 27.5 nm radii tips, respectively) and is consistent within a 99% conﬁdence interval
of the experimental values, 1.8 and 2.9 μm. Figure 4.5 shows the material non-linearity
at strains greater than 5%, and anisotropy at strains greater than 15% is well captured.
These results provide evidence that the proposed non-linear anisotropic constitutive
relation describes graphene’s deformation within the context of these nanoindentation
experiments. Finally, we note that the linear elastic and non-linear models diverge for
deﬂection beyond ~80 nm. Therefore, the linear constitutive relation initially used to ﬁt
the force–deﬂection response is accurate up to ~2/3 of the maximum deﬂection, but
should not be used past this point.
Figure 4.6 shows a representative contour map at varying indentation depths of the
maximum in-plane stress in the area under the indenter tip where the largest stresses

occur. Here, the anisotropy can readily be seen from the six-fold symmetry in the
contour, corresponding to graphene’s hexagonal crystal lattice. It also shows that the
stress state in the material point immediately under the indenter tip is less than the
intrinsic value under equibiaxial strain. The material encircling that material point,
however, is at the intrinsic stress, conﬁrming that the material immediately under the
indenter tip is deformed into a regime of negative tangent modulus.
4.5
Instabilities
No defects exist in pristine graphene at which material failure can be initiated. Hence
rupture will initiate due to one of at least three possible different classes of deformation
instability.
Elastic instability [32] occurs when the tangent modulus (the instantaneous slope of
the stress versus strain response) approaches zero and becomes negative. For a uni-
formly strained sample, further load increments induce locally unbounded strain energy
density leading to spontaneous fragmentation. This potential instability can be seen for
deﬂections of 115 and 118 nm in Fig. 4.6 where the material has a negative tangent
modulus [32].
Soft phonon mode instability is akin to a phase transformation and occurs when the
frequency for a vibrational mode reaches zero, leading to a diverging vibrational
amplitude at ﬁnite temperature. In 2010 Marianetti and Yevick predicted via DFT
calculations that soft phonon mode instability can induce an accelerated softening that
reduces the intrinsic strength at least in homogeneously deformed graphene [33]. The
non-linear anisotropic elastic constitutive model discussed above does not account for
the possibility of soft phonon mode instability, but could be generalized to do so.

4.5 Instabilities
005
27 Jul 2017 at 14:02:05, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

Elastic structural instability occurs when the potential energy of a structure (deﬁned
by considering the material, conﬁguration of materials, and the applied loading) loses
positive deﬁniteness (e.g. [34]). Thus the structure can not store additional elastic
energy as a consequence of additional load increment, and structural collapse ensues.
In the simulations of Fig. 4.6, the local instability at the membrane center is constrained
by a surrounding “ring” of graphene at stress below the peak. The good agreement
between experiments and the maximum deﬂection and load predicted by structural
instability indicate that this is likely to be the case in experiments, although more precise
measurements are required for deﬁnitive conﬁrmation. If so, this indicates that graphene
can potentially be studied (e.g. through very local optical probes) in a locally
unstable state.
4.6
Defective Graphene
Utilizing graphene (or any 2D material) in practical applications requires the develop-
ment of methods to scale the material to a usable size. Defects are an inevitable
consequence of increased scale, so it is important to understand the effects of the
defects that can exist (0D and 1D defects). The multiscale model described above
provides a rigorous machinery by which experiments on defective graphene can be
analyzed to extract elastic stiffness and breaking strength.
4.6.1
Point Defects
The effects of point defects can be studied by oxidation of membranes using a weak
oxygen plasma [35, 36, 37, 38]. The evolution of the defect type and density with
plasma exposure time is determined through Raman spectroscopy: the ratio of the
D peak to the D0 peak intensities discriminates between sp3-type defects from oxygen

[39]. The defect density,

Figure 4.7 shows the extracted value of E2D, as determined from analysis of load-
deﬂection curves using Eq. (4.1), for various plasma exposure times. E2D remains
constant (within experimental uncertainty) over the entire sp3-type defect region,
indicating that these defects do not appreciably change the stiffness; this is expected
in the case of sparse defects, since the elastic stiffness averages over the bond stiffness
of the whole sample. Once the exposure time crosses over into the vacancy-type defect
region, E2D decreases with increasing defect density to a minimum of ~30% of the
initial value, after which the membranes were not stable.
As expected, the breaking load shows greater sensitivity to defects regardless of type.
An approximately 50% smaller breaking load is observed by the time the I D

properties are dominated by the 99.93% of the graphene that is pristine, the non-linear
model is still valid for modeling of the experiments, and can be used to generate a plot
of maximum stress versus applied load (similar to the plot seen in Fig. 4.9 which is
discussed in more depth later). We ﬁnd that the two-fold decrease in breaking load
corresponds to a decrease in strength of only ~14%. Once the graphene crosses into the
vacancy-type region, the linear elastic modulus changes, so the non-linear model is no
longer valid, and more detailed modeling will be required to analyze experimental data
in this regime.
4.6.2
Line Defects
Graphene produced by a scalable method such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
possesses grain boundaries that can also reduce the breaking strength. Theoretical
studies have argued that these grain boundaries can be nearly as strong as the
pristine lattice, with the strength varying with tilt angle and arrangement of defects
[42]. We have studied the mechanical behavior of two different types of CVD
graphene: continuous ﬁlms with small (1–5 μm) grains (SG), and isolated single
crystals with large (>100 μm) grains (LG). These were transferred to Si substrates

difference is seen in the elastic stiffness. Just as in the case of point defects, a dilute
fraction of defective graphene in grain boundaries does not change elastic properties.
Figures 4.8(d), (e) and (f) show histograms of the breaking force. LG graphene
shows the same breaking force as exfoliated graphene. Therefore, we can conclude
that the spacing between point defects (if any) in LG graphene must be much larger
than the value of 7 nm that produced a 50% decrease in breaking strength in the
previous study (Fig. 4.7). On the other hand, the SG graphene shows a ~25%
decrease in the mean breaking force and a broader distribution of strengths. This
distribution is presumably due to both random location of grain boundaries relative
to the indentation point, and variation in the individual grain boundary strengths. In
order to more precisely determine the properties of individual grain boundaries, we
have performed AFM nanoindentation tests directly on grain boundaries identiﬁed
by dark-ﬁeld TEM imaging. Conﬁrming the statistical results of the nanoindenter
test, these show a ~30% decrease in average breaking force. However, it is important
to note that a small fraction of grain boundaries is not “well-stitched” but instead
consists of overlapping sheets. As can be expected, these show virtually no breaking
strength.
As in the study of point defects, the non-linear model can be used to extract the
breaking strength in each of these cases. The ability to model experiments by FEA is
particularly useful in this case, where the nanoindenter and AFM used tips with
different radii of 26 nm and 38 nm, respectively. The computed maximum stress
versus load for both tips is plotted in Fig. 4.9. The maximum strength given by the
average breaking force of the SG graphene is only ~5% smaller than the intrinsic
strength, and the grain boundary strength is only ~10% smaller. Thus we conclude
that polycrystalline CVD graphene can be nearly as strong as single-crystal, pro-
vided that “overlap” grain boundaries can be eliminated.

Conclusion
We have developed an experimental regime to fabricate and experimentally test the
mechanical properties of monatomically thin specimens of graphene. The experiments
and concomitant analysis demonstrate that pristine graphene achieves its intrinsic
strength, making graphene the strongest material yet characterized.
From a materials perspective, the ability to isolate via mechanical exfoliation and also to
grow graphene via scalable CVD methods creates potential avenues for applications. One
such opportunity is to incorporate graphene as a strengthening element into composite
materials based upon polymer, metal, or ceramic matrices. The high strength of graphene
also is a requisite for incorporation of graphene into many electrical or optical applications.
We have carried out an almost identical set of experiments and computations with
suspended 2D MoS2 rather than graphene [26]. The close correspondence between the
predicted behavior and experiments suggests that this framework for deriving a higher-
order mulitscale anisotropic non-linear elastic continuum description would be valid for
any 2D crystal. Multiple length scale modeling is required to obtain a predictive
understanding of mechanical properties. The validated higher-order elastic constitutive
model for graphene and MoS2 provides guidance for the development of rigorous
models for 3D crystals as well.
Graphene also provides the opportunity to study the initiation, suppression, and
interactions of various instabilities in the absence of material defects. In the experiments
with graphene and MoS2, the elastic and soft phonon mode instabilities are apparently
suppressed, due potentially to a number of factors, including: out-of plane bending
deformation; contact with indenter tip; presence of strain gradients; ﬁnite temperatures,
chemical interactions with indenter tip, among others.
Several avenues of future research would be of interest. The present constitutive
model accounts only for in-plane deformation. While appropriate for the indentation
experimental conﬁguration, other applications in which large curvatures develop may
require accounting for the strain energy density due to bending, and especially the
coupling between the in-plane and bending deformations [43]. The ﬁnite deformations
that can be achieved in graphene present the opportunity to study coupling between
mechanical and other properties, such as catalysis.

Vibrations in Graphene

5.1
Structure and Vibrations of Monolayer Graphene
The organization of atoms in a crystalline structure imposes symmetry-related
constrains on the net motion, which inﬂuences most properties of solid state systems.
In the group theory framework [1], the hexagonal symmetry of monolayer graphene on
isotropic medium belongs to the space group P6/mmm (D6h
1), with two inequivalent
C atoms in the unit cell [1, 2, 3, 4]. The unit cell is illustrated in the left sketch of
Fig. 5.1(a), deﬁned by the vectors a1
! and a2
!. Strain can break the hexagonal symmetry,
as indicated by the other sketches in Figs. 5.1(a) and (b), with implications on the
vibrational structure.
5.1.1
Graphene in an Isotropic Medium
The graphene phonon dispersion is plotted in Fig. 5.2(a). The two unit-cell atoms
moving in the three-dimensional space generate six phonon branches – three acoustic
(A), with in-phase displacements of the two unit-cell atoms, and three optical (O), with
out-of-phase displacements of the two unit-cell atoms. The phonon eigenvectors are
described by the acoustic and optical unit-cell displacements multiplied by a wavevector
q, which deﬁnes the phase modulation along the unit cells in the crystalline lattice.
Figure 5.2(a) shows the phonon frequencies with q along the Γ–K direction in the
hexagonal Brillouin zone. Figure 5.2(b) shows the 12 phonon eigenvectors at the Γ and
K points. The atomic displacements in the graphene plane (i for in-plane) can be
longitudinal (L) or transversal (T) with respect to the phonon wavevector direction.
The atomic displacements perpendicular to the graphene plane (o for out-of-plane) are
transversal (T) phonons, and they generally exhibit lower frequencies because the
out-of-plane restoring forces are much weaker than the in-plane ones.
At the Γ point (q = 0), the group of wavevector is isomorphic to the point group D6h,
which has the special property of being homogeneous for in-plane lattice distortions
[1, 2, 4]. Consequently, the in-plane longitudinal optical (iLO) and the in-plane transver-
sal optical (iTO) phonons are degenerate, representing the only ﬁrst-order Raman active
mode of graphene, named G band, belonging to the double-degenerate irreducible
representation E2g, appearing at 1584 cm–1 [4, 5, 6, 7]. The relatively high frequency
of this optical phonon (~0.2 eV) allows the use of Raman spectroscopy to probe
small environmental perturbations, including variations in strain [8], doping [9], and

temperature [10]. The out-of-plane transversal optical mode (oTO) at the Γ point is active
in infrared absorption spectroscopy [2]. However, the polar character of this vibrational
mode is very weak because graphene is homoatomic, and infrared spectroscopy is mostly
used to measure the vibrations from functionalization agents and other contaminants in
graphene [11, 12], besides direct electronic effects near the K point [13, 14].
The lines in the graphene phonon dispersion plot in Fig. 5.2(a) are theoretical
calculations [15], and the symbols are experimental data from inelastic light-scattering
[16]. Force constant models are generally used for describing phonon dispersion in
materials, but they rely on a limited number of atomic neighbor interactions and do not
account for electron–vibration interactions [6]. Graphene, however, has long-range and
non-adiabatic effects that had to be considered before an accurate description of the
phonon dispersion could be achieved [15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21].
Experimentally, due to momentum conservation requirements, most materials rely on
either neutron or X-ray inelastic scattering to probe phonon dispersion [22, 23],
necessary for achieving scattering by phonons in the interior of the Brillouin zone.
Graphene, however, has a combination of factors that generate unique effects making it
possible to probe the phonon dispersion with inelastic light-scattering in the visible

Fig. 5.2(a) come from the so-called double-resonance Raman scattering effect [24, 30],
where q 6¼ 0 phonons that generate resonant electron scattering between different points
in the K and K0 valleys can be probed [31]. Changing the excitation laser energy
changes the double-resonance selected q, and different places in the phonon Brillouin
zone can be probed [24]. Another interesting effect is the stacking of two graphene
layers with a mismatch rotation angle θ between the lattice structures in each layer,

building the so-called twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) [16, 27, 28, 29]. The mismatch
angle θ generates a superstructure where a potential modulation activates phonons with
the modulation wavevector q(θ) [16, 27, 29, 32]. Figure 5.2(c) shows the Raman spectra
from several tBLGs with different mismatch angles θ [29]. The peaks marked with * are

an interlayer vibration present only in many-layers graphene. N-layers graphene (N =
number of layers) has 2N atoms in the unit cell, and they will be discussed in Section 5.2.
5.1.2
Graphene under Strain
Small modiﬁcations in the graphene structure may lead to different symmetry groups,
sometimes related to other 2D materials [3]. For example, the structure of monolayer
black or blue phosphorus (phosphorene) [37], silicone, and germanene [38] can be
achieved by a distortion of the graphene lattice. Figure 5.1(a) shows that starting from
the D6h
1 graphene a uniaxial compression induces a phase transition to subgroup D2h
11 of
strained graphene. The hexagonal symmetry is lost, and the resulting structure is ortho-
rhombic with all atoms in the same plane. Such a strain breaks the hexagonal symmetry,
and two G bands are observed in the Raman spectra [8]. In order to accommodate such
strain in the orthorhombic lattice, a possible distortion is to displace lines of atoms
perpendicular to the plane periodically up and down [3]. These zig-zag lines of atoms
displaced periodically perpendicular to the plane generate the structure of black P, which
belongs to the D2h
7 subgroup. Otherwise, starting from the D6h
1 graphene symmetry
(Fig. 5.1(b)) and applying an isotropic strain, changes are expected in the C—C bond
distances, and such changes can be measured through changes in the G band frequency
[6]. Relatively small homogeneous strain does not affect the symmetry of the system. For
higher pressures, in order to accommodate the anisotropic strain, one possible distortion
is to displace the atoms periodically up and down, perpendicularly to the plane, generat-
ing a trigonal arrangement of atoms. Such a distortion generates the structure of blue
P (also of silicene, germanene, and stanene), which belongs to the D3d
3 subgroup [3].
Group theory has been used to gain insights into the symmetry aspects of graphene, black
P, blue P, silicene, germanene, and stanene [3]. This analysis can be used to distinguish
the different systems, and for a fast characterization of in-plane heterostructures that can
be built to customize certain desired properties in these new materials.

Many-Layers Graphene and the Interlayer Vibrations in 2D Systems

In-Layer Vibrations
The symmetries for N-layer graphene, with N even or odd (from now on, N 6¼ 1), are the
same as for bilayer and trilayer graphene, respectively [1, 2, 3]. The main symmetry

operation distinguishing the point groups between even and odd layers are the horizon-
tal mirror plane, which is absent for N even, and the inversion, which is absent for N
odd. At the Γ point, the point group is D3d for N even and D3h for N odd [2]. The
consequences on the vibrational modes are mostly related to the fact that N-layers
graphene has 2N atoms in the unit cell, thus multiplying the number of phonon
branches. This aspect is behind the broad use of Raman spectroscopy as the main
method when assigning the number of layers is a graphene sample [1, 5, 7, 39, 40].
Although the interlayer interactions are weak and no major change happens to the ﬁrst-
order phonon spectra, the changes in the second-order spectra subjected to the dou-
ble-resonance condition is considerable, and generates the well-known method for N-
assignment [6, 39, 40].
Graphite belongs to the P63/mmc (D6h
4) non-symorphic space group with only four
atoms in the unit cell [2, 41]. The wavevector point groups are isomorphic to the
wavevector point groups of monolayer graphene, but differ fundamentally for some
classes where a translation of c/2 is present c
! is the unit cell vector normal to a1
! and a2
!.
5.2.2
Interlayer Vibrations
Up to now, mostly vibrations within the two-dimensional planes have been discussed.
These vibrations are usually characterized by relatively large phonon frequencies, and
the stacking of multiple layers is of minor importance. There is another set of vibrations
that are related to the coupling of two or more layers, which are the interlayer vibrations.
The frequencies of the interlayer vibrations are much lower because the interlayer
coupling in two-dimensional materials are governed by van der Walls bonds, which
are much weaker than the in-plane covalent bonds [42, 43]. The physics of interlayer
vibrations is independent on the speciﬁc in-plane symmetry, being general for two-
dimensional materials with two layers or more, and can be used to monitor the number
of layers and to study the evolution from the two-dimensional system to the bulk form.
There are two main types of interlayer vibrations: the shear (in-plane) and the
breathing (out-of-plane) between two adjacent layers [44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51,
52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. Figure 5.3(a) shows both types of vibrations for N =
2, 3, and 4. The number of different modes increases with (N – 1).
In bilayer graphene, the shear mode vibrates at 28 cm–1, while the interlayer
breathing-mode frequency is close to 80 cm–1 [44, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]. Different
works have reported the observation of shear modes from bilayer to bulk graphite using
optical techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and coherent phonon spectroscopy [47,
48]. Figure 5.3(b) shows the measured differential reﬂectivity as a function of time for
graphene samples with different numbers of layers. This experiment was accomplished
using coherent phonon spectroscopy, where two pulsed laser beams (one pump, the
other probe) were used, and the time delay between them could be tuned [48, 53]. The
excitation generated by the pump pulses perturbs the interlayer potential in the few-
layer graphene samples, launching the shear-mode oscillations. Since the duration of the
pump pulse is shorter than the shear-mode period, the shear mode can be excited
coherently. These coherent oscillations modulate the optical dielectric function of the

graphene layers, the amplitude of the modulation being proportional to the amplitude of
the vibration [48, 53]. The Fourier transform of the experimental differential reﬂectivity
data shown in Fig. 5.3(b) provides a measure of the shear-mode frequency as a function
of the number of layers, as shown in Fig. 5.3(c). As shown in the graphics, the shear-
mode frequency increases monotonically with the sample thickness [47, 48]. The shear
and out-of-plane modes in few-layer graphene (as well as for other two-dimensional
systems) are theoretically described by considering a coupled oscillator model, in which
only interactions between identical adjacent layers are considered. The branch with the
higher frequency corresponds to the shear motion of adjacent layers vibrating in
opposite directions. The frequency of this branch for N-layers is given by
ωN ¼ ω∞cos π=2N

where ω∞is the shear-mode frequency in the bulk limit [47, 48]. This model describes

Although we have focused our attention on the graphene case, the interlayer vibrations
occur for all different classes of two-dimensional materials [47, 51, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59,
60]. These vibrations provide a signature for the thicknesses of these two-dimensional
systems, and open up new possibilities for studying interactions between adjacent layers
or between the layers and the external environment (e.g. supporting substrate).
5.3
The Quantum Nature of Atomic Vibrations
Because of energy quantization, the low-energy acoustic phonon states are generally
more populated than the high-energy optical phonon states. At a given temperature, the
phonon population is described by the Bose–Einstein distribution function
n0 ¼
1
eEq=kBT  1 ,
(5.2)
where Eq and kBT are the phonon and thermal energies, respectively [6, 61]. In the
harmonic oscillator theory, the increase and decrease in the population number n is
achieved by applying the creation (a†) and annihilation (a) operators, respectively, on
an eigenstate |ni. These operations introduce normalization factors given by a†|ni =
(n + 1)½|n + 1i and a|ni = n½|n – 1i. Therefore, the phonon population can be measured
in the inelastic scattering of light by phonons, where a photon creates or annihilates a
phonon, in the so-called Stokes (S) or anti-Stokes (aS) Raman scattering processes,
respectively (see Fig. 5.4(a)).
The intensity ratio between the Stokes and anti-Stokes signals (IaS/IS) is determined
by the quantum mechanics normalization factors, i.e. IaS/IS / n/(n + 1) [6, 61].
Replacing n by the Bose–Einstein population function n0 gives

where the constant C accounts for the optical properties of the system and can be found

dependence of different nanomaterial properties, such as electrical power [62], thermal
conductivity [63], effective temperatures on biased nanostructures [64], phonon
anharmonicities and lifetimes [65, 66], and optical transitions [67, 68].
However, Eq. (5.3) it is not universal. Special care should be taken when using
Eq. (5.3) in materials with high-energy phonons like the G band in graphene. In this

case, the thermally activated phonon population at room temperature is very low, and
the anti-Stokes scattering may be dominated by a correlated phenomenon, called
Stokes–anti-Stokes (SaS) scattering, where the same phonon is exchanged in the
Stokes and the anti-Stokes scattering [see SaS in Fig. 5.4(a)] [69, 70]. To account for
this phenomenon, Eq. (5.3) has to be generalized to include this effect, and the IaS/IS
ratio is given by [71]
IaS

(5.5)
where the term explicitly dependent on the excitation laser power (PL) accounts for the
SaS correlated scattering. The constant CSaS measures the importance of the SaS
phenomenon, and if CSaS is negligibly small, Eq. (5.5) goes back to Eq. (5.3).
Evidence for the SaS process has been accumulating in materials science [70, 72, 73,
74, 75], generating interest in quantum optics [74, 75]. Since phonons have a signiﬁcant
lifetime (in the order of picoseconds [65, 66]), it has been proposed that these systems
can work as a solid-state quantum memory, storing information between the write
(Stokes) and read (anti-Stokes) processes [74]. For the optical phonons in graphene,
the quantum memory would work at room temperature, because Eq  kBT at T ~ 300K.
The correlated character of the Stokes and anti-Stokes photons can be continuously
varied from purely quantum to purely classical, as demonstrated in diamond [75].
While many experiments have been performed in diamond with ultra-fast pulsed
lasers to enhance the response of the non-linear SaS event, there is evidence for the
observation of the dominant SaS event in graphene using a few miliwatts continuum
wave (CW) laser, i.e. achievable even with a simple laser pointer. This result was
obtained in a tBLG, specially engineered to exhibit resonance with the anti-Stokes
photon emission [70]. In Fig. 5.4(b), the excitation power dependence of an AB-stacked

bilayer graphene exhibits an IaS/IS power dependence that can be ﬁt using Eq. (5.5) with
CSaS = 0 and an effective phonon temperature increasing linearly with the increasing
excitation laser power. The excitation power dependence of the tBLG, however, clearly
exhibits a linear dependence on PL for larger excitation power values, and a ﬁt using
Eq. (5.5) shows that anti-Stokes photon production is dominated by the correlated SaS
scattering [70, 71].
5.4
Phonon Coherence Length in Graphene
The phonon coherence length c
! is another important aspect of vibrations, playing an
important role in the optical and transport properties of materials. For example, the
high-energy optical phonons are known to limit electrical transport [62, 63, 64, 65].
Since phonons are studied in graphene mostly using light-scattering, the phonon
coherence length will rule the length scale where spatial coherence takes place.
Spatial coherence deﬁnes the ability of two distinct points of a wave to interfere. The
classic example of this phenomenon is the fringe visibility in a Young’s double-slit
interferometer. While broadly explored in optics, spatial coherence has been neglected
in the light-scattering by phonons, because the ﬁeld emitted by an incoherent source at a
given wavelength λ is spatially uncorrelated on length-scales larger than λ/2 [76].
However, this approach is not valid if the non-radiating near-ﬁeld components in the
light–matter interaction are taken into account [77, 78, 79, 80]. It has been shown that,
because of coherence, Raman intensities at the nanoscale depend signiﬁcantly on the
mode symmetry and spatial conﬁnement of the vibration [81, 82].
In the case of graphene, it was theoretically predicted [81] and experimentally
demonstrated [82] that the G band signal (E2g symmetry) is subjected to destructive
interference in the near-ﬁeld regime. The results obtained from near-ﬁeld Raman
experiments revealed that these optical phonons in graphene are subject to coherence
lengths c
!  30 nm [82].
For nanostructured materials whose average crystallite size La is smaller than the
coherence length c
! of the phonons, the quantum conﬁnement can generate frequency
shift, broadening, and asymmetry of the peaks in the Raman spectra [6]. These changes
are caused by the uncertainty in the phonon momentum associated with the ﬁnite size of
crystallites. In other words, when La < c
!, the Raman-allowed phonon wavevector q is
relaxed by the amount Δq / La
–1. For this reason, the crystallite size La can be extracted
from the width of the Raman lines in polycrystalline graphene systems with La < c
!, as
discussed in Section 5.5.

Probing Phonons Near Defects and Edges/Grain Boundaries

Disorder-Induced-Raman Processes in Graphene
Raman spectroscopy is considered as one of the most useful techniques for graphene
characterization, with strong emphasis on defects [5, 6, 85, 86]. The key factor is the
79

occurrence of disorder-induced bands in the presence of defects, and their evolution
with the amount and type of disorder. Figure 5.5 shows a Raman spectrum obtained
from an ion-bombarded graphene sample [87]. This spectrum shows the ﬁrst-order
allowed G band (~1584 cm–1), the second-order (or two-phonon) G0 (~2700 cm–1, also
called 2D band in the literature), and 2D0 (~3120 cm–1) bands. The spectrum also shows
three other additional disorder-induced bands, namely: the D band (~1350 cm–1), the D0
band (~1620 cm–1), and the combination D+D0 (~2970 cm–1). Some important aspects
and deﬁnitions about these features are:

The D band originates from a totally symmetric vibration mode occurring near
the corners (K or K0 points) of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone (see eigenvector iTO at
K in Fig. 5.1(b)) [88]. This mode belongs to the iTO phonon branch [89], and its
Raman activity is mediated by a double-resonance mechanism in which the
photoexcited electron or hole is scattered by a phonon (with ﬁnite wavevector
qD 6¼ 0), and back-scattered by a defect that provides momentum conservation in
the process [30]. Because the phonon scatters an electron/hole from one Dirac
cone to another, this process is called intervalley [24].

The mechanism giving rise to the D0 band is similar to the one originating the
D band (double resonance). The differences are: (i) the associated vibration
mode belongs to the iLO phonon branch, occurring near the center of the ﬁrst-
Brillouin zone, although the phonon wavevector is still ﬁnite, i.e. qD0 6¼ 0; (ii)
since the phonon wavevector is much shorter than the one giving rise to the
D band, the electron is scattered by the phonon from one eigenstate to another
belonging to the same Dirac cone. For this reason, this process is called
intravalley [5, 6, 7, 24, 30].

www.ebook3000.com


The G0 (2D) and 2D0 bands originate from the overtone of the phonon modes that
give rise to the D and D0 bands, respectively [5, 6, 7, 24, 30, 90]. Since the
electron (or hole) is scattered twice by the same phonon (with opposite wave-
vectors), the G0 and 2D0 do not require the defects to be observed.

Unlike the G0 and 2D0 bands, the combination D+D0 requires the presence of
defects for momentum conservation, since the D and D0 phonon wavevectors
have different magnitudes (|qD| 6¼ |qD0|) in the scattering process [91].
5.5.2
Types of Defects and Their Inﬂuence on the Disorder-Induced Bands
Long-Range versus Short-Range Defects
Because the magnitude of the wavevector of the phonon giving rise to the D band is
relatively large (if compared to the total extension of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone), the
D band is only activated by short-range defects [15]. In other words, the defect has
to be conﬁned to a small region in the real-space in order to provide such a large
momentum in the reciprocal space. Structural defects such as vacancies, edges, and
crystallite borders belong to this class of short-range defects, and therefore the
D band is activated. On the other hand, the wavevector of the phonon associated
with the D0 band is considerably shorter, and therefore the D0 band can be activated
by long-range defects such as charged impurities absorbed on the graphene sheet
[15]. For these reasons, the ratio between the D and D0 intensities can be used to
probe the nature of the defects, being larger for long-range defects than for
short-range ones [92].
Edges/Grain Boundaries
Regarding graphene edges, and considering that the grain boundary is a type of
graphene edge, two important points are highlighted.

Both D and D0 intensities are strongly dependent on the direction of the polariza-
tion vector P of the exciting ﬁeld relative to the edge direction, following the
relation
ID,D0 / cos 4α,
(5.6)
where ID,D0 is the intensity of the D, D0 scattered ﬁeld, and α is the angle between
P and the edge direction [93, 94]. Therefore, these two features present maximum
intensities for incident light with the polarization ﬁeld parallel to the edge, and
minimum (null for perfect edges) for incident light with the polarization ﬁeld
perpendicular to the edge [94, 95].

The D band exhibits maximum intensity for armchair edges, and cannot be
activated by zig-zag edges. This property can be used to probe the crystallo-
graphic orientation of graphene edges [94, 95]. The atomic structure of the edges
plays no role in the D0 scattering.

5.5.3
Quantifying the Amount of Disorder by Raman Spectroscopy
The ratio between the D and G band integrated intensities (ID/IG) has been broadly used
to measure the amount of disorder in nanostructured graphitic samples [4, 5, 6, 7]. Care
should be taken when reading the literature because some authors use the intensity
(peak height) ratio and others use the integrated intensity (peak area) ratio. The ﬁrst
approach was originally introduced by Tuinstra and Koenig [88]. By noticing that the
D band is activated by the borders of crystallites in nanographitic samples, the authors
proposed that its intensity should be scaled with the perimeter of the crystallites, that is,
ID / La, with La being the lateral dimension of the crystallite. On the other hand, the
G band intensity should be proportional to the crystallite area (IG / La
2). Based on these
two geometrical assumptions, Tuinstra and Koenig proposed the proportionality rela-
tion ID/IG / 1/La. Later on, Ferrari and Robertson noticed that the relation proposed by
Tuinstra and Koenig was no longer valid for samples with a high-degree of disorder, for
which they proposed the relation ID/IG / La
2 [89].
Both relations (Tuinstra and Koenig (ID/IG / 1/La), and Ferrari and Robertson (ID/IG /
La
2)) are based in a single parameter, which is the crystallite size La. In order to introduce a
uniﬁed approach, Lucchese and collaborators [87] proposed a phenomenological model to
explain the evolution of the ID/IG ratio in a graphene sheet with points defects, as a function
of the average distance LD among defects. In this model, two new parameters are intro-
duced: (i) the radius (rS) of the structurally disordered area, which is a measure of the defect
size; and (ii) the radius (rA) of the area where the D band scattering takes place, rA > rS.
While rS is deﬁned as a purely structural parameter, rA is a dynamical variable related to the
coherence length of the photoexcited electrons or holes involved in the D band scattering.
A similar model was applied for polycrystalline graphene samples with average crystal-
lite size La [84]. In this case, the length of the D band activation area (LA) near the borders of
the crystallites replaces rA, and the thickness LS of the structurally disordered area
surrounding the crystallite (LS  LB/2, where LB is the thickness of the grain boundary
between two merged crystallites) replaces rS. The two models have the same geometrical
reasoning, but in one case the defects are point-like (zero-dimensional, 0D) and in the other
the defects are line-like (one-dimensional, 1D). The experimental values obtained for these
parameters were rA  LA  4 nm [84, 87], rS  1 nm [87], and LS  2 nm [84].
The ID/IG ratio depends on the wavelength of the excitation laser source, λL
[96, 97, 98]. While the G band intensity is proportional to λL
-4 (as usual for ﬁrst-order
Raman scattering processes [6]), the D band intensity does not depend considerably on
λL [96], and therefore the general trend ID/IG / λL
4 was experimentally observed for λL,
within the visible range [84, 91, 96, 98].
Figures 5.6(a) and (b) show the plots of the relations obtained for the ID/IG ratio as a
function of LD (Fig. 5.6(a)) and La (Fig. 5.6(b)), considering different excitation laser
wavelengths. These plots summarize the results presented in [87, 91] and [84], and can
be used as a guide to estimate LD and La, respectively.
For samples with point defects separated by LD  10 nm, the experimental results
presented in [87, 91] lead to

For LD < 10 nm, ID/IG deviates from this simple equation [87] and the broadening
effects take place [99].
In the case of the nanostructured graphene with the crystallite sizes larger than the
phonon coherence length, i.e. La  30 nm (see Section 5.4), the Tuinstra and Koenig
proportionality relation holds, and the experimental results yield [84, 98]

Thermal Properties of Graphene:
From Physics to Applications
Alexander A. Balandin
6.1
Thermal Conductivity of Graphene and Few-Layer Graphene
Graphene [1], in addition to its unique optical [2] and electronic [3, 4] properties,
demonstrated extremely high thermal conductivity [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The ﬁrst experi-
mental studies of the thermal conductivity of graphene were made possible with
development of the optothermal Raman technique (see Fig. 6.1). In this technique, a
Raman spectrometer acts as a thermometer measuring the local temperature rise in
graphene in response to the laser heating from the same instrument [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
Graphene has distinctive Raman signatures, e.g. G peak and 2D band, which exhibit
strong temperature dependence [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. This means that the shift in
the position of G peak in response to the laser heating can be used to measure the local
temperature rise. The correlation between temperature rise and the amount of power
dissipated in graphene, for the sample with given geometry and proper heat sinks,
allows one to extract the value of the thermal conductivity K. A small amount of power
dissipated in graphene is sufﬁcient to induce a measurable shift in the G peak position
due to the atomic thickness of the material. The suspended portion of graphene serves
several essential functions in this method (Fig. 6.2). It is needed to accurately determine
the amount of power absorbed by graphene, forming an in-plane two-dimensional (2D)
heat front propagating toward the heat sinks, and reducing thermal coupling to a
substrate through increased micro- and nano-scale corrugations (Fig. 6.1). In recent
years, the optothermal Raman technique developed at UC Riverside was extended to
other 2D materials, such as layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) [18, 19,
20] and macroscopic suspended ﬁlms [21]. In the case of TMD, the thermal conductiv-
ity values are much smaller, which allows to induce sufﬁcient heating with a Raman
spectrometer laser even in relatively thick ﬁlms.
The ﬁrst optothermal Raman measurements of suspended graphene [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
demonstrated that the thermal conductivity can exceed that of the bulk graphite, which is
~2000 W/mK at room temperature (RT). It was determined that the electronic contribu-
tion to heat conduction in graphene, which is not gated, is much smaller than that of
phonons near RT. The phonon mean-free path (MFP) in graphene was estimated to be
~775 nm near RT [6, 10]. Several independent studies, which utilized modiﬁed versions
of the Raman optothermal technique [22, 23], found that the thermal conductivity of
suspended high-quality chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene is in the range of
K ~ 1500 to ~5000 W/mK [22, 23]. At temperature T ~ 600 K the thermal conductivity

Fig. 6.1 Illustration of the optothermal Raman experimental technique developed
for measuring thermal conductivity of suspended graphene. The suspended graphene is
heated with the laser light while the corresponding temperature rise is determined from the
shift in the G or 2D peaks in the Raman spectrum of graphene. The knowledge of
temperature rise in response to the dissipated power and geometry of the graphene layer are
sufﬁcient for determining the in-plane thermal conductivity. The corrugations in the partially
suspended graphene, which are depicted in the schematic, reduce graphene thermal coupling to
the substrate. The technique was subsequently modiﬁed with metal heat sinks and a detector
placed under the suspended graphene. Recently, the optothermal Raman technique was
extended to other two-dimensional van der Waals materials that have clear Raman signatures
(for details, see [10]).

measurements. In the experiments, 2D material is heated in the middle of the suspended part

extracted under the assumption of 2.3% light absorption was determined to be K ~ 630
W/mK [24]. One should note though that, due to the many-body effects, the absorption
in graphene is the function of wavelength λ, when λ > 1eV [25, 26, 27]. The absorption
of 2.3% is observed only in the near-infrared at ~1 eV, and it steadily increases with
increasing energy. Taking into account actual absorption at 488 nm under the conditions
of the experiments would increase the extracted values of thermal conductivity.
A recent study using a different experimental technique – electrical thermal bridge – of
the residue-free suspended graphene also obtained thermal conductivity above the bulk
graphite limit: K ~ 2430 W/mK at T = 335 K [28]. Naturally, defects and grain boundaries
characteristic for CVD graphene can substantially reduce the thermal conductivity [10].
The thermal conductivity of the supported graphene is lower than that in suspended
graphene due to coupling of graphene phonon modes with substrate modes and enhanced
interface phonon scattering. The thermal conductivity of graphene on the Si/SiO2 substrate
was measured using the thermal bridge technique and found to be K  600 W/mK near RT
[29]. Encasing graphene within two layers of SiO2 leads to further reduction of the thermal
conductivity due to the phonon–boundary and disorder scattering [30].
Theoretically, the thermal conductivity in graphene has been investigated using a
range of approaches from the Boltzman transport equations (BTE) to molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations [31–54]. The BTE approaches gave K values from 1000
W/mK to 8000 W/mK, depending on the defect nature and density, edge quality and
size of graphene ﬂakes. The MD simulations typically result in lower values from
~500 W/mK to ~2900 W/mK owing to the small simulation domain sizes and
underestimation of the contribution of the long wavelength acoustic phonons.
Theoretical studies conﬁrmed that phonon scatterings on edge roughness and lattice
defects, as well as the strain characteristics for suspended samples can strongly affect
the thermal conductivity of graphene. The fact that graphene can have higher thermal
conductivity than that of the basal planes of graphite, despite similarities in phonon
dispersion and the crystal lattice inharmonicity, was explained by the speciﬁcs of the
long-wavelength phonon transport in 2D crystal lattices [10]. The long-wavelength
phonons in 2D graphene have exceptionally long MFP, limited by the size of the
sample even if the thermal transport is diffusive. In different terms, this means that the
phonon Umklapp scattering is ineffective in restoration of the thermal equilibrium in
2D crystal lattice such as in 3D crystal lattices. The latter results in an anomalous
dependence of the thermal conductivity of few-layer graphene (FLG) on the number of
atomic planes in the samples [17]. The most recent theoretical studies suggest that the
size of graphene samples have to be in the 100-μm or 1-mm range in order to converge
to the intrinsic value of the thermal conductivity, limited by the crystal lattice
inharmonicity alone [55, 56]. In both reports, the K values were substantially larger
than the bulk graphite limit (K = 5800 W/mK at T = 300 K [55]). This conclusion is
in line with the theoretical predictions of logarithmic divergence of the thermal
conductivity of strictly 2D crystal lattices without defects [57, 58]. Another interesting
question in the theory of heat conduction in graphene, which continues to attract major
attention, is the relative contributions of the longitudinal acoustic (LA), transverse
acoustic (TA), and out-of-plane (ZA) phonons to thermal conductivity.

6.2
Isotope and Rotational Engineering of Thermal Properties of Graphene
We now turn to a discussion of the effects of isotopes on the thermal conductivity of
graphene and the possibility of tuning thermal properties of FLG by the atomic plane
rotations. Naturally occurring carbon materials are made up of two stable isotopes
of 12C (~99%) and 13C (~1%). It is known from theoretical studies that a relative
concentration of isotopes and crystal lattice defects can have a dramatic affect on the
thermal conductivity. The ﬁrst experimental study of the isotope effect on thermal
properties of graphene [59] used material with various percentages of 13C, which were
synthesized using the CVD technique. The thermal conductivity of the isotopically pure
12C (0.01% 13C) graphene, measured by the optothermal Raman technique [10], was
higher than 4000 W/mK at temperature ~320 K, and more than a factor of two higher
than the thermal conductivity of graphene sheets composed of a 50%–50% mixture of
12C and 13C (see Fig. 6.3). The evolution of thermal conductivity with the isotope
content was attributed to the changes in the phonon – point defect scattering rate via the
mass-difference term [60]. The ability to control thermal transport via isotope engineer-
ing can help in understanding the speciﬁcs of heat conduction in 2D systems. It may
also have practical implications for situations when the thermal conductivity has to be
reduced without degrading the electrical conductivity.
One of the most interesting recent developments in the graphene thermal ﬁeld is the
investigation of the phonon and thermal properties in twisted bilayer graphene
(T-BLG). Single-layer graphene reveals four in-plane phonon branches – transverse
acoustic (TA), longitudinal acoustic (LA), transverse optical (TO), and longitudinal
optical (LO) with the atomic displacements in the graphene plane – and two out-of-
plane branches – acoustic (ZA) and optical (ZO) with the displacements perpendicular
to the graphene plane. The in-plane acoustic branches are characterized by the linear

concentrations of 0.01%, 1.1% (natural abundance), 50%, and 99.2%, respectively, as a
function of temperature (data from [59]).

energy dispersions over the most part of the Brillion zone (BZ) except near the zone
edge, while the out-of-plane ZA branch demonstrates a quadratic dispersion near the
zone center q = 0 (q is the phonon wavenumber). However, it deviates from the
quadratic dispersion as q increases. The number of the phonon branches in bilayer
graphene (BLG) is doubled: six additional branches possess non-zero frequency at
q = 0 and at the low frequencies are affected by the interlayer interactions [61]. The
emergence of many folded hybrid phonon branches in T-BLG was explained by the
change in the unit cell size and a corresponding modiﬁcation of the reciprocal space
geometry. The number of the polarization branches and their dispersion in T-BLG
depend strongly on the rotation angle [61].
The ﬁrst measurements of the thermal conductivity of suspended twisted bilayer
graphene were also performed using the optothermal Raman technique [62]. It was
found that the thermal conductivity of the twisted bilayer graphene is lower than that of
monolayer graphene and the reference Bernal stacked bilayer graphene in the entire
examined temperature ranges from ~300 K to 700 K (see Fig. 6.4). This ﬁnding
indicates that the heat carriers – phonons – in the twisted bilayer graphene do not
behave as in individual graphene layers. The decrease in the thermal conductivity in
twisted bilayer graphene was explained by the modiﬁcation of the Brillouin zone due to
plane rotation and the emergence of numerous folded phonon branches that enhance the
phonon Umklapp and normal scattering [61, 62].
A possibility of engineering the speciﬁc heat of T-BLG has been studied theoretically
[63, 64, 65]. In Fig. 6.5(a), the temperature dependences of the phonon speciﬁc heat cv
in SLG are shown for different phonon branches: ZA, TA+LA and ZO+TO+LO.
The contribution of ZA phonons to the speciﬁc heat is dominant up to T ~ 200 K.
Nevertheless, both the ZA contribution to the speciﬁc heat and the total value of cv

demonstrate deviation from the linear T-dependence beginning from T ~ 15 K. This is a
manifestation of the anisotropy and a deviation from the parabolic of the ZA dispersion
[64]. The power index n of Tn-dependence of the speciﬁc heat increases faster for the
total speciﬁc heat than for the ZA component of cv due to the contributions from LA and
TA phonons revealing ~T2 dependence for T < 100 K. The contribution of the in-plane
phonons to the total cv increases with the temperature and becomes comparable with
that of the ZA phonon contribution for T ~ 250–300 K. This illustrates that the simpliﬁed
isotropic models for the phonon density of states in graphene do not capture all the
characteristics of the speciﬁc heat and thermal conductivity [64, 65]. For temperatures

and in-plane phonons for graphene (solid curves) and 13.20 T-BLG (dashed curves).

T ~ 300 K, the contribution of the in-plane acoustic phonons to the speciﬁc heat is larger
than that of ZA phonons. The contribution from optic phonons is very small (<10%) up
to T ~ 180 K due to the low population of these modes. However, their contribution
to the speciﬁc heat grows rapidly with the temperature: at RT it constitutes ~23%, at
T = 500 K is ~ 36%, while at T = 1000 K is ~46%.
In Fig. 6.5(b), we illustrate the contributions from the out-of-plane and in-plane
phonon modes to the total phonon speciﬁc heat of single-layer graphene (solid lines)
and T-BLG (dashed lines) as a function of temperature [64]. The speciﬁc heat of the
out-of-plane phonons varies with temperature as Tp, where p = 1 for graphene and
p = 1.3 for T-BLG at T < 15 K. The difference in p is explained by the speciﬁcs of the
folded phonons in T-BLG. In general, the dispersion relations of the additional acoustic
phonons cannot be described by a parabolic law, even at the phonon wavevectors near
the BZ center. As a result, both p = 1.3 of T-BLG and p = 1.6 of AB-BLG are larger
than p of single-layer graphene [64].
The theoretical results show that ZA phonons dominate the speciﬁc heat for
T  200 K while their contribution become comparable with that from LA and TA
phonons in the temperature range 200 K  T  500 K [63, 64]. In this sense, the out-of-
plane vibrations, which resemble standing waves, are efﬁcient in storing thermal
energy. However, this does not automatically mean that ZA phonons make the domin-
ant contribution to the thermal conductivity. In kinetic theory, the phonon thermal
conductivity can be written as K ~ cvVΛ, where V is the phonon group velocity,
Λ = Vτ is the phonon MFP, and τ is the combined relaxation time of the phonons.
The thermal conductivity, particularly near RT, is affected strongly by phonon group
velocity (deﬁned by the slopes of the dispersion branches) and phonon scattering due to
inharmonicity of the crystal lattice and defects. The question of the relative contribution
of ZA, LA, and TA phonons at different temperature ranges and under different
conditions (e.g. supported graphene versus suspended) is still a subject of theoretical
debates. No conclusive experimental evidence has so far been provided.
The fundamental difference of phonon engineering by twisting from earlier
approaches that involved phonon conﬁnement in acoustically mismatched nanostruc-
tures, e.g. conventional quantum wells and nanowires [66, 67], is the possibility of
controlling not only acoustic phonons but optical phonons as well. The twisting of
atomic planes results in breaking the unit cells and reducing BZ, which results in
phonon dispersion modiﬁcation all the way to the optical branch [61]. The possibility
of the engineering of the acoustic and optical phonon dispersion can be useful for
energy storage and thermal management applications.

Graphene Applications in Thermal Management Technologies
Excellent heat conduction properties of graphene and FLG coupled with graphene
ﬂexibility stimulated investigation of possible thermal management applications of these
materials [68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74]. In this section, we outline graphene applications in
thermally conductive coatings and thermal interface materials (TIM). In the thermal

context, we consider a ﬂake to be FLG rather than a piece of graphite as long as its
thickness is below 7–10 atomic planes, and, correspondingly, Raman spectrum is differ-
ent from that of bulk graphite. For practical thermal applications, FLG can have certain
beneﬁts compared to single-layer graphene. The thermal conductivity of FLG is still high
and it is subject to less degradation when FLG ﬂake is embedded inside matrix material as
compared to that of graphene [10]. The larger cross-sectional area of FLG translates to
higher heat ﬂuxes along the length the ﬂake as compared to single-layer graphene.
Thermally conductive coatings are particularly needed to improve heat removal from
various plastic components, e.g. electronic packaging, since the thermal conductivity of
plastic is very low (below 0.5 W/mK at RT). Graphene laminate (GL) has demonstrated
potential for the thermal coating applications [21]. The chemically derived graphene
and FLG ﬂakes in GL layers are closely packed in the overlapping structure. The GL
ﬁlms can be easily deposited on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrates or other
plastic materials. The deposited or “sprayed on” GL ﬁlms can be roll compressed (see
Fig. 6.6). The physics of heat conduction in such materials is non-trivial given the
random nature of the overlapping regions of graphene ﬂakes, the large distribution of
the ﬂake sizes and thicknesses, as well as the presence of disorder and defects.
Fig. 6.7 shows the RT thermal conductivity of the uncompressed and compressed GL
ﬁlms on the PET substrate as a function of the average graphene ﬂake size. The data
were obtained using the Raman optothermal technique [21]. The overall thermal con-
ductivity values for GL ﬁlms are rather high from 40 W/mK to 90 W/mK. Considering
that PET and related plastic materials have the thermal conductivity in the range from
0.15 W/mK to 0.24 W/mK, coating PET with graphene laminate increases the thermal
conductivity by more than two orders of magnitude (170 to 600). It is clear from
Fig. 6.7 that one can achieve high thermal conductivity in both compressed and
uncompressed GL ﬁlms. The PET substrates had little if any effect on the heat transfer.

The laminate thickness variation is clearly seen from the micrograph (data from [21]).

No dependence on GL layer thickness was observed. The thermal conductivity for both
uncompressed and compressed ﬁlms scales linearly with the average ﬂake size. The
overall value of the thermal conductivity and its dependence on the ﬂake size indicate
that the heat conduction in graphene laminate is limited by the ﬂake boundaries rather
than the intrinsic properties of the graphene and FLG. Compression results in better
alignment of the ﬂakes or their closer attachment, which leads to higher thermal
conductivity for each size of the ﬂake [21]. The fact that high thermal conductivity can
be achieved in both uncompressed and compressed GL ﬁlms has practical implications. It
suggests that graphene coating via a “spray on” process, without roll compression and
other processing steps, can be used for improving heat conduction properties of plastics
used, for example, in electronic packaging or housing of light bulbs that require high
thermal conductivity.
A separate important area of graphene thermal applications is in TIMs or thermal
pastes, which are applied between the heat sources and heat sinks [68–72]. Conven-
tional TIMs ﬁlled with thermally conductive particles require high volume fractions of
ﬁllers (f ~ 50%) to achieve the thermal conductivity of the composite in the range of
~1–5 W/mK at RT. The demand for better TIMs is not limited to electronics. The key
renewable power generation technologies also require efﬁcient thermal management.
Graphene and FLG produced by inexpensive and a scalable liquid phase exfoliation
(LPE) technique has shown early promise as ﬁllers for TIMs [68–72]. Graphene
outperforms carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as ﬁller material owing to its better thermal
coupling to the matrix materials, comparable or higher thermal conductivity, and
Fig. 6.7 Thermal conductivity of GL-on-PET as a function of the average ﬂake size. The results
are shown for the compressed (circles) and uncompressed (rectangles) graphene laminate. The
dashed lines are to guide the eyes only. Note that the high thermal conductivity can be achieved in
both uncompressed and compressed samples. For the same ﬂake size, the compressed samples
have higher thermal conductivity than uncompressed ones owing to better ﬂake alignment
(data from [21]).

substantially lower cost. The loading fractions of graphene in composites are relatively
low, e.g., up to 10% in TIMs [71] and up to 20% in PCMs [72].
The theory considerations for graphene composites and experimental results for other
types of ﬁllers suggest that a particular strong increase in thermal conductivity at small f
can be achieved if the ﬁllers are aligned along the direction of heat ﬂux. In the TIM
context, the direction of alignment has to be perpendicular to the connecting surfaces,
thus facilitating heat transfer from one surface (e.g. computer chip) to another (e.g. heat
sick or package). Molecular dynamics simulations predicted that one can achieve a
tremendous 400 enhancement of the thermal conductivity along the direction of the
graphene ﬂake alignment at f = 5 vol.% in common matrix materials [75]. TIMs with
low graphene and FLG ﬁller loading are preferable because high f results in increased
viscosity, air gap formation, and agglomeration, which degrade heat conduction prop-
erties. The low loading of graphene is also beneﬁcial for keeping the price of TIMs in
the acceptable range.
The data presented in Fig. 6.8 show that the enhancement of the apparent thermal
conductivity with the oriented graphene ﬁllers is twice as strong as that with the random
ﬁllers at small loading (f = 1 wt.%) of the graphene. The apparent thermal conductivity
includes the effects of the thermal contact resistance with the connecting surfaces [76]. The
ratio of the apparent thermal conductivity of the composite to that of the base epoxy is
Km/Ko ~ 3.2 for the oriented ﬁllers and Km/Ko ~ 1.7 for the random ﬁllers. The enhance-
ment for the bulk thermal conductivity can be stronger. It is interesting to note that the
temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of composites with oriented ﬁllers is
somewhat different from that of composites with random ﬁllers. The thermal conductivity
of composites with random ﬁllers increases with temperature, which is characteristic of
Fig. 6.8 Apparent thermal diffusivity for the Cu-TIM-Cu structure as a function of temperature.
The data are shown for a sample where the graphene ﬁllers were left random and another
sample where they were oriented with the help of a ﬂat permanent magnet. Note that the heat
dissipation via TIM with the oriented graphene ﬁllers is substantially better than in the reference
commercial TIM and TIM with random graphene ﬁllers (data from [76]).

amorphous and disordered materials [10]. In contrast, the decrease in the thermal conduct-
ivity of composites with oriented graphene ﬁllers can be explained by the decreasing
viscosity at elevated temperatures, resulting in partial loss of the ﬁller orientation [76].
The thermal conductivity measured for bulk samples is a material metric, which does
not completely represent how well it will perform in practice. The apparent thermal
conductivity measured for realistic bond-line thicknesses, which includes the effect of the
thermal interface resistances, is a more informative characteristic of TIMs. However, the
metric used in industry for assessment of the suitability of TIM for speciﬁc applications is
a temperature rise in a given device or a system with a certain TIM. In Fig. 6.9, we present
the results of the temperature rise testing using a high-end desktop computer [76]. These
experiments allow one to assess the TIM efﬁciency in transferring generated heat away
from the computer processing unit (CPU). For these tests, the conventional TIM supplied
with the CPU package was removed and replaced with the graphene-enhanced TIMs. To
achieve alignment of the functionalized graphene ﬁllers, the CPU assemblies were placed
on a ﬂat permanent magnet. As one can see from Fig. 6.9, the temperature rise is reduced
in the CPU by as much as 10 oC after 15 hours of operation when TIM with f = 1% of the
oriented graphene ﬁllers is used. This reduction is substantial for practical applications. In
some device technologies, the reduction of the temperature rise by 20 oC translates into an
order of magnitude increase of the device lifetime [76].

7.1
Macroscopic Approach to Graphene Plasmonics
To introduce graphene plasmons, we ﬁrst consider the simple case of an inﬁnite
graphene sheet contained inside an electromagnetic medium that is translationally
symmetric along the in-plane axes. This allows a simple decomposition into Fourier
modes with in-plane wavevector k ¼ kx; ky


and with a ﬁxed frequency ω, so that each
ﬁeld varies as exp ikxx þ ikyy  iωt


. In the following, we consider, without loss of
generality, waves directed along ^x, that is, ﬁxed kx with ky ¼ 0. Electromagnetic modes
in this situation may be transverse electric or transverse magnetic, however, charged
oscillations like plasmons occur only in the latter (H
! k ^y, and E
! in the x, z plane). We
focus on the transverse magnetic modes.
The graphene plasmon is an oscillation with inertia provided by free charge carriers
in the graphene, and restoring forces provided by the Coulomb interactions between the
electrons (which are also inﬂuenced by the dielectric environment around the graphene).
In a linear response, the electrodynamics of graphene in this situation can be completely
described by its optical conductivity function σ kx; ω
ð
Þ, which gives the sheet current
density per unit of the in-plane electric ﬁeld Ex, i.e.
Jx kx; ω

Þ ¼ σ kx; ω

ÞEx kx; ω

The charge buildup, ρ ¼ kx=ω
ð
ÞJx, generates the restoring electric ﬁeld.
In general, σ kx; ω
ð
Þ is a non-trivial complex function, dependent on the graphene
carrier density and temperature. Section 7.2.1 provides a deeper theoretical understand-
ing of σ kx; ω
ð
Þ, which we will leave aside for the moment.
7.1.1
Kinetic Inductance and the Drude Model
To establish a basic understanding of graphene plasmons, it is helpful to have in mind a
simplistic model of the graphene optical conductivity. For this reason, it is common to
approximate the conductivity by the Drude law that is independent of kx

The parameter D is known as the Drude weight, and describes the collective response

electrons (dependent on carrier concentration), i.e., the difference between Fermi level

Note that the Drude law (7.1) can be rewritten as a series combination of resistance

Here, the resistance ρ0 ¼ Dτ is the sheet resistivity measured in electrical experiments

this kinetic inductance which allows the existence of plasmons.
By varying EF – which can be performed in situ by moving the Dirac point energy
with gate voltages – D in graphene can be tuned over the range of approximately

3D Electrodynamic Modes of a 2D Conductor
The plasmon can be found by considering, hypothetically, what happens when a
longitudinal sheet current wave Jappeikxxiωt^x is driven immediately adjacent to the
graphene. This charge wave can excite a plasmon if kx and ω match appropriately.
The added response of the graphene and the dielectric materials produces a longitudinal
electric ﬁeld Ex in response to Japp, and electrodynamic modes such as plasmons can be
found as a resonance in response that occurs at particular values of kx and ω. (This
approach to identify the plasmon is by no means unique: other response functions such
as the evanescent Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcient will contain the same resonance.)
In this case, the total current at the level of the graphene is given by
Jx ¼ Japp þ σEx,
(7.4)
composed of the externally applied current Japp and the graphene response to the total
electric ﬁeld Ex. By Ampère’s law, this concentrated current sheet produces a discon-
tinuous step in the transverse magnetic ﬁeld

The boundary conditions in the medium surrounding the graphene provide additional

(7.8)
A resonance in Z indicates a self-sustaining oscillation: Ex 6¼ 0 with Japp ¼ 0. This
occurs when kx and ω are such that
Ya þ Yb þ σ ¼ 0:

The above equation can be considered as a lumped element or circuit model for the
electromagnetic modes, shown in Fig. 7.1. The real and imaginary parts of Z are the
resistance and reactance to the applied current Japp. The admittances Ya, Yb are typically
capacitive Ya þ Yb ¼ iωC

capacitor oscillator, this system naturally oscillates at a frequency of ω ¼ 1=

oscillation relies on the kinetic inductance of the free charges and hence it is classiﬁed as
a plasma wave (or plasmon).
7.1.3
Plasmon Dispersion
In general, the admittances Ya, Yb are dependent on the wavevector kx, leading to
dispersion of the plasmon. A common situation is where the spaces above and below
the graphene are ﬁlled with isotropic dielectrics of permittivity ϵa and ϵb, respectively,

under a variety of circumstances:

Dielectric dispersion, i.e., variations in ϵ ω
ð Þ, especially from phonons. We
discuss plasmon–phonon hybridization effects in Sections 7.1.5 and 7.4.2. Note
that formula (7.11) is not valid when permittivities are negative, as occurs in the
reststrahlen frequency bands that can appear due to phonons.

Dielectric layered structures, in particular with thin ﬁlm dielectrics with thick-
nesses of order 1=kx or smaller. As an extreme case, if graphene is separated from
metal by a thin dielectric, one obtains a linear dispersion ω / kx at low frequency.
Section 7.1.5 examines different dielectric environments for the graphene
plasmon.

Non-Drude conductivity. Interband electronic contributions (see inset Fig. 7.1)
tend to increase the kinetic inductance at high frequencies when ω > jEFj=ħ,
pushing down the plasmon frequency. Competing with this are intraband con-
ductivity modiﬁcations at low phase velocity (for ω=kx not much larger than
Fermi velocity), which decrease kinetic inductance and push up the plasmon
frequency. Figure 7.2 compares the Drude model predicted plasmon to the fully
calculated dispersion for a particular case.

Retardation effects, violating the quasi-electrostatic limit that was assumed for
(7.11).
7.1.4
Comparison with Plasmons in Other Systems
Comparison with Other 2D Plasmons
Graphene plasmons can be compared to a variety of other plasmonic systems. The
plasmons in semiconducting two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are the closest
analogue. All 2DEG plasmons rely on inductive sheet conductivity σ, and hence follow
the electrodynamics described in Section 7.1.2. As a result, all 2DEG plasmons have the
ω /
ﬃﬃﬃﬃ
kx
p
dispersion when the 2DEG is between two simple dielectrics, as described in
Section 7.1.3.
The main distinction between graphene and other 2DEGs is quantitative: the plasmon
wavelengths differ greatly, as do the frequency ranges for plasmonic behavior. There
are two reasons for this: ﬁrst, a high Drude weight is possible in graphene where
EF e 0:4 eV is easily achievable, whereas in a semiconductor 2DEG one is hard pressed
to exceed 0:1 eV;3 second, the bulk semiconductor permittivity around a 2DEG is
quite large, typically ϵa þ ϵb > 20ϵ0, whereas graphene on a typical substrate has
ϵa þ ϵb 	 5ϵ0. The different Drude weights and permittivities combine (see Eq. (7.11))
3 Note that for a two-valley semiconductor 2DEG with degenerate electron gas the formula for Drude weight
in terms of EF is identical to that of graphene, Eq. (7.3).

to give graphene a much longer graphene plasmon wavelength (smaller kx) for a given
frequency, or in other words, a higher graphene plasmon frequency ω for a given kx.
This allows graphene plasmonic structures to oscillate at much higher frequencies
than semiconducting 2DEGs, for the same spatial dimensions. Graphene plasmons,
however, operate at lower frequency than thin ﬁlm metal plasmons; this is true even in
the hypothetical case of a single-atom-thick metal ﬁlm, which would follow many of
the same equations just discussed but with a much higher Fermi energy of order
3–10 eV.
Each material also has a different relaxation time, τ, which limits plasmonic operation
at low frequencies: below f ¼ 1= 2πτ
ð
Þ, the plasmons are overdamped. At room tem-
perature, the large τ in graphene allows plasmonic operation down to approximately
0.3 THz, whereas in metals the lower limit is around 8 THz. Note that dielectric
properties also inﬂuence plasmons losses, as further examined in Section 7.3.
Comparison with Surface Plasmons
Two-dimensional plasmons are quite different in nature from surface plasmons, which
instead occur at the surface of a bulk conductor (without a 2DEG). In this case, one
of the bulk materials provides the necessary inductance, appearing as a negative
permittivity. For example, the permittivity of a bulk conductor (metal or otherwise) is
typically represented by Drude law permittivity
ϵb ω
ð Þ ¼ ϵ∞1  ω2
p= ω2 þ iωτ1




,
which is a combination of background permittivity (ϵ∞) and free-carrier Drude response;
ωp is the bulk plasma frequency.
The analysis of Section 7.1.2 is easily adapted to derive surface plasmons: we take
σ ¼ 0 and look for resonances given by Ya þ Yb ¼ 0. The surface modes can occur
when they have dispersion given by (via (7.10), taking ϵb negative)

Note the essential appearance of μ0 in the surface plasmon dispersion, indicating that
full electromagnetic forces are at play, in contrast to the electrostatic forces required for
the 2DEG plasmon dispersion in Eq. (7.11). A surface plasmon is therefore typically
referred to as surface plasmon polariton (SPP) reﬂecting that it exists as a hybridization
of electromagnetic light plane waves with surface plasma resonance. For most frequen-
cies, the surface mode phase velocity ω=kx only differs slightly from the speed of light

7.1.5
Inﬂuence of Dielectric Environment: Permittivity Dispersion and Thin Films
We have seen that the dielectric environment has direct impact on the plasmon
dispersion: in Eq. (7.11), the plasmon kx for a given frequency has a direct proportional
scaling with permittivity ϵ. However, to arrive at Eq. (7.11) we have assumed a very
simple dielectric environment.
To accurately characterize the dielectric environment around the graphene, one may
need to include (1) phonons, (2) birefringence, or (3) thin ﬁlm effects. As an example of
practical interest, the highest quality plasmons in graphene to date have been observed
when graphene was encapsulated between thin ﬁlms of hexagonal boron nitride [97]. In
this case, one needs to take into account all three of the effects just mentioned:
hexagonal boron nitride is a birefringent dielectric with highly polarizable phonons,
and in these devices it is usually encountered in nanometer-thick ﬁlms.
Dielectrics can be modeled as a macroscopic and local permittivity tensor that is
frequency-dependent, ϵij ω
ð Þ, implying a constitutive relation for polarization given by
Pi ω
ð Þ ¼ P
jϵij ω
ð ÞEj ω
ð Þ. This captures the effects of both phonons and birefringence.
One can then solve Maxwell’s equations as usual, and taking into account thin ﬁlms
with the appropriate boundary conditions.4 The modes are, as before, found as zeros of
Ya þ Yb þ σ
ð
Þ, see Section 7.1.2. Assuming the quasi-electrostatic limit and also kx > 0
and ω > 0, below are a few notable examples:
1.
For a half-space of isotropic medium with dispersion (e.g., phonons, free
electrons, or other dynamic polarizable degrees of freedom), the admittance
expression in Section 7.1.3 remains valid, except ϵ ω
ð Þ is frequency-dependent.
We repeat this formula

[91].
3.
For a half-space consisting of a nearby ﬁnite ﬁlm of birefringent dielectric (ϵx, ϵz)
of thickness d, followed by a perfect conductor (approximating a metal, for
example)
4 The transfer matrix approach provides a convenient framework for analytically or numerically evaluating
the effects from an arbitrary number of layers.

An interesting limit of practical interest is small βzd  1 (long wavelength and thin

plasmon instead of the usual square root. This linear dispersion persists to arbitrarily
low frequencies but with a phase velocity much lower than the speed of light [4].

large jϵj ⋙jϵxj and hence α 	 0, and one recovers Eq. (7.14).
Any of the above formulas may be used with dispersive dielectrics, i.e., with a
frequency-dependent permittivity.
Regarding the last two examples, an unsusual phenomenon occurs when ϵx=ϵz is
negative, which characterizes so-called hyperbolic materials or indeﬁnite materials.
This gives an imaginary βz and hence the waves in the dielectric are propagating in z,
instead of evanescent. This phenomenon occurs naturally in hexagonal boron nitride, in
two frequency bands [11, 22]. One then ﬁnds that numerous conﬁned electromagnetic
modes of differing kx can exist at a single value of ω, not all of which are related to the
graphene plasmonic response.
7.2
Microscopic Approach
In this section, a more in-depth theory of the plasmonic response is provided. In
particular, we summarize a simple but highly successful approximation: the random
phase approximation (RPA) [8, 40], which captures plasmon collective excitations. In
connection with the previous section (analyzing plasmons via macroscopic electro-
dynamics), here we provide the microscopic approach to calculate the conductivity
function σ k; ω
ð
Þ of graphene, which goes beyond Drude’s law.
Electrons in graphene, as in any other material, do not move as independent particles.
Their motions are instead highly correlated due to pairwise interactions [42]. These are
described by an interaction potential v rij

(with physical dimensions of

between two electrons. The non-relativistic (instantaneous) Coulomb interaction
between two electrons in graphene is sensitive to the dielectric media surrounding the
graphene sheet. For graphene with one side exposed to a uniform and isotropic medium
with permittivity ϵ1 and the other to one with permittivity ϵ2, a simple electrostatic
calculation yields

Beyond RPA
We conclude this section with a few comments on the physics of Dirac plasmons
beyond the RPA.
(i)
As explained in [3], because the 2D massless Dirac fermion (MDF) model
Hamiltonian is not invariant under an ordinary Galilean boost, the RPA is not
exact for interacting systems of MDFs even in the limit q ! 0. This is in striking
contrast to what happens in the conventional 2D parabolic-band electron gas [42],
where for q ! 0 the plasmon dispersion is protected from many-body renorma-
lizations by Galilean invariance. When interactions between MDFs are treated
beyond RPA, even the leading long-wavelength term in the plasmon dispersion
acquires a non-trivial density and coupling-constant dependence [3].
(ii)
In the RPA, a Dirac plasmon has an inﬁnite lifetime at low momentum and energy
and zero temperature T ¼ 0

near the origin of the q; ω

Þ
	

¼ 0. When the plasmon dispersion hits the
continuum of interband electron–hole excitations, Landau damping kicks in. This
simply means that a plasmon can decay by exciting single interband electron–hole
pairs. At ﬁnite temperature, Landau damping “leaks” into the T ¼ 0 Pauli-blocked
region of the
q; ω
ð
Þ plane. Going beyond RPA, the plasmon acquires a ﬁnite
intrinsic lifetime τp1 q
ð Þ, also at small energies and momenta [86]. A long-
wavelength plasmon can decay by emitting, for example, two electron–hole pairs
5 Note that in a full electrodynamic model of graphene, σ q; ω
ð
Þ at non-zero q becomes a tensor, containing
longitudinal and transverse parts. The quantity examined here is the longitudinal conductivity involved in
plasmonic behavior, i.e., in transverse magnetic modes. The transverse conductivity, related to magnetiza-
tion and relevant for transverse electric modes, has also been calculated for non-interacting electrons in
graphene in [87].

ð
Þ and p2; p2  k
ð
Þ. In a real system,
other physical effects, such as scattering by disorder and phonons, can substan-
tially affect the plasmon lifetime, as we discuss in Section 7.3.
7.3
Plasmon Damping
From any deﬁning dispersion relation of graphene plasmons, such as (7.11), it is clear
that if there are losses Re σ > 0 or Im ϵ > 0
ð
Þ, then either kx or ω must be a complex
quantity. This means that the mode must either decay in time, or in space. In this
section, we provide the common metrics used to describe this decay, and discuss the
common physical sources.
7.3.1
Quantifying Lifetime and Propagation Length
In the case of plasmonic resonators, one considers standing waves (kx real) with a
complex ω. Depending on the situation, one may be concerned with the amplitude
lifetime, 1=Im ω, or the energy lifetime 1= 2 Im ω
ð
Þ. A useful dimensionless ﬁgure
of merit is the lifetime quality factor Q, which is deﬁned as
Q 
Re ω
2 Im ω


real kx
:
(7.31)
This is 2π times the number of oscillation periods required for the standing wave to
decay to 1=e of its starting energy.
In the case of propagating plasmons, one may consider ω real (continuous-wave
excitation) and examine the amplitude attenuation length, 1=Im kx, which determines
the propagation losses away from a localized excitation source; in this case, the standard
dimensionless ﬁgure of merit, known as the inverse damping ratio, is given by
γ1
k

Re kx
Im kx


real ω
:
(7.32)
This is a sort of propagation quality factor (not to be confused with Q): γ1
k
is 4π times
the number of wavelengths that have travelled away from the source before the wave
decays in energy by 1=e.
Provided the losses are small, the temporal and spatial losses will be related via the
group velocity vg ¼ dω=dkx of the mode6
6 This generic relation for wave phenomena occurs since plane wave modes can be deﬁned as a complex zero
of some analytic, two-parameter response function F k; ω

Þ. The mode condition F k; ω

we have that Q ¼ γ1
k . It is stressed however that square-root
dispersion is not universal for graphene plasmons (see Section 1.3 and the following
subsection), and in general one should not conﬂate the lifetime/propagation quality
factors.
7.3.2
Sources of Damping, Inﬂuence on Plasmon
The graphene conductivity losses are often the dominant cause of plasmon damping.
A non-zero value of Re σ can come from extrinsic disorder such as electron scattering
from charged impurities in the substrate, or ripples in the graphene. Intrinsically,
thermal vibrations in the graphene lattice also cause scattering. Even without scattering
processes, one ﬁnds Re σ 6¼ 0 in some regions of ω, kx due to Landau damping (from
allowed intraband or interband single-particle electronic transitions excited by the
plasmon), and this is captured in the RPA.
The Drude formula (7.1) can be crudely used to capture scattering losses via the
parameter τ, where it is considered as a constant and thus independent of ω and k. This
is a simpliﬁcation, however, and the effective dependence of both τ and D on ω, k is
relevant for most of the plasmon damping process. Most signiﬁcantly, the τ relevant for
plasmonics is not the same τ as obtained from low-frequency transport measurements;
this is further discussed in the next subsection.
In general, the complex-valued kx or ω should be found as a complex pole of the
impedance function discussed in Section 7.1.2, or equivalently as a complex zero of the
RPA dynamical dielectric function discussed in Section 7.2.1. It is, however, informa-
tive to consider the case of Drude conductivity with inﬁnite dielectrics of arbitrary ϵ ω

in the quasielectrostatic limit, Eq. (7.11). For small losses

In the special case of non-dispersive and lossless dielectrics, one obtains simply

¼ ωτ. In other words, the energy lifetime of the plasmon is simply the
conductivity relaxation time τ. If there is dielectric dispersion, however, the lifetime
may easily exceed τ, since the mode would no longer be purely plasmonic (it would

hybridize with, e.g., a phonon). The large dielectric losses near phonons will, on the
other hand, tend to decrease the mode lifetime.

which is probed in a dc transport experiment.
In the presence of long-range scatterers, which play an important role in graphene
on SiO2 or at low densitities in high-quality encapsulated devices, the plasmon
lifetime increases with increasing carrier density, remaining substantially shorter than
the dc Drude transport time, even at high carrier densities [85]. The authors of [87]
carried out a detailed study of the inverse damping ratio of plasmon–phonon
polaritons in high-quality van der Waals stacks comprising graphene and h-BN. They
considered two possible sources of scattering that limit the lifetime of these hybrid
modes: scattering against graphene’s acoustic phonons and h-BN optical phonons. It
was found that scattering against intrinsic acoustic phonons is the dominant limiting
factor (yielding theoretical quality factor Q and propagation factor Re kx=Im kx in the
range 50–70 at room temperature). Including thin ﬁlm effects, dielectric dispersion,
and dielectric losses – see Section 7.1.5 – it was found [97] that the plasmon lifetime
displays a very weak dependence on carrier density and a strong dependence on
frequency.

Experimental Observation of Graphene Plasmons
Plasma waves and surface plasmon polaritons have been studied experimentally in
metallic systems, doped semiconductors, graphene or semiconductor electron gases,
employing a wide palette of experimental techniques. The most common technique for
probing and exciting plasmons is based on radiation ﬁelds of visible, infrared or THz
frequencies, depending on the plasma frequency to be addressed. Various alternative
techniques include electron beams or photon emission. As discussed before in the
theory section, the momentum of plasma waves in graphene is much larger than the
momentum of free-space photons. Therefore, several methods are employed for

launching and detecting plasmons, either by overcoming this momentum mismatch or
by employing direct electrical coupling to the plasma waves.
7.4.1
Probing Plasmons by EELS and ARPES
Before discussing the optical experiments on graphene plasmons, we will brieﬂy
address techniques which have been used for studying collective excitations in gra-
phene, in particular angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), and electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS).
The ﬁrst experimental reports on plasmons in graphene, and in particular the inter-
action between plasmons and single-particle electron excitations, were based on ARPES
[9, 95]. ARPES is a spectroscopic technique for measuring the electron distribution in
reciprocal space. This is achieved by detecting the energetic and angular distribution of
ejected electrons which are excited by high-energy photons (usually soft X-ray). Instead
of the usual interactionless crossing of the two bands at a single point (Dirac point),
these pioneering works reported the observation of the four bands which cross in a
diamond-like shape. This modiﬁcation of the electron/hole momentum distribution is
well understood by considering interaction effects, which can be very strong in gra-
phene [56, 81]. For example, electron–electron interactions can lead to the formation of
quasiparticles, such as plasmarons which consists of electrons (or holes) and plasmons,
coupled by Coulomb interactions between single electrons/holes and the plasma excita-
tions in the electron sea. The existence of the plasmaron changes the topology of the
bands near the Dirac crossing as theoretically predicated [47, 81]. The key signature of
the involvement of graphene plasmons in the renormalized band structure was the
observation of linear scaling of the dielectric function (and therefore the plasmon
dispersion) with Fermi energy EF.
The ﬁrst experimental observation of the dispersion relation (energy versus momen-
tum) for graphene plasmons for a wide range of energies was obtained by energy loss
spectroscopy (EELS). EELS is a powerful tool for studying the interactions of electrons
with plasmons, phonons, or single-particle excitations (inter- and intraband transitions).
The working principle of EELS can be summarized as follows: when an electron beam
impinges on a solid-state material, it loses part of its energy by inelastic scattering (e.g.,
by phonons, plasmons, or electronic single-particle excitations). By analyzing this
energy loss in addition to the associated momentum transfer – employing an electron
spectrometer – information about the inelastic interactions can be obtained. In contrast
to optical absorption spectroscopy, EELS is not limited to zero-momentum transfer
(q 	 0 for photons but not for electrons), thus providing information about the energy
loss spectrum Im

. For graphene, the observed energy loss spectrum
showed a peak at the energy of the two-dimensional π plasmon (or sheet-plasmon).
From these peaks, the energy and momentum of the plasmon resonances can be
extracted. Based on this method, several reports on EELS or high-resolution EELS
(HREELS) applied to graphene conﬁrmed the characteristic ω /

on top of the polar substrate SiC [54, 60, 63] showed a strong deviation from the 2D-
plasmon dispersion, explained by plasmon–phonon hybridization, as was predicted
theoretically [47]. The coupling of collective electronic modes with optical phonons
has been studied extensively on semiconducting structures using EELS spectroscopy
[26, 53, 83]. More details on plasmon–phonon hybridization will be discussed below.
7.4.2
Plasmons in Patterned Graphene Structures and Substrates
The size of the plasmonic material can strongly inﬂuence how it interacts with light,
especially when it is much smaller than the free-space wavelength [57]. Discontinuities
in the electric permittivity can set up standing localized plasmon waves conﬁned to the
plasmonic material, when the light frequency is tuned to its plasmon resonance. In a
similar fashion, 2D localized plasmons can also be excited in lithographically designed
graphene ribbons, disks, their periodic arrays, and anti-dots [10, 50, 55, 89, 102, 104,
107]. Grating structures can also be etched onto the substrate to couple light into
graphene plasmons [38, 43, 80, 106]. Figure 7.3 illustrates these various plasmonic
nanostructures and grating structures in graphene.

As an example, let us consider plasmons in graphene nanoribbons. When illuminated
at normal incidence with electric ﬁeld polarized perpendicularly to the ribbon axis,
plasmon modes can be excited. They propagate back and forth between the ribbon
edges, setting up Fabry–Pérot modes. In a single homogeneous ribbon with width W,
these modes should satisfy
kpW þ ΦR ¼ πn,
where W is the ribbon’s width, and ΦR is the reﬂection phase picked up by the plasmon
as it is reﬂected off the ribbon edge, known to be reﬂected with virtually 100%
amplitude attributed to the large density of states in graphene versus the photonic
radiating modes [39]. If the ﬁelds vanishes exactly at the ribbon edge, then one obtains
ΦR ¼ π . However, recent work has found a non-trivial reﬂection phase ΦR 	 3π=4 in
the case of graphene due to the excitation of highly evanescent modes [74]. Hence, the
fundamental mode n ¼ 0, will have the wavevector kp ¼ ΦR=W. Subsequent excited
modes follow with n ¼ 2, 4 . . . as modes characterized by odd integers are antisym-
metric with respect to the ribbon axis and do not couple to normal incident light. These
modes have zero dipole moments, and are also known as dark modes.
Experiments on these graphene nanoribbon plasmonic resonators reveal resonant
absorption in their measured extinction spectra [10, 30, 50, 102], deﬁned as
1  T⊥=Tk , where T⊥Tk


are the transmission spectra for perpendicular (parallel)
polarized light with respect to the ribbon axis. Since these resonances reside in the
terahertz to mid-infrared frequencies, the experiments typically involve an infrared
microscope coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR), used in
conjunction with a broadband polarizer. Figure 4.4 illustrates the measured extinction
spectra for graphene nanoribbon arrays with different widths. The observed resonances
correspond to the plasmonic “cavity” modes we discussed earlier. With the ribbon
width, which translates into the plasmon wavevector kp, a reasonable estimate of the
ribbon plasmon resonances can be obtained from its 2D graphene plasmon dispersion

Typically in these experiments on graphene plasmonic resonators, the plasmons reside
outside the Landau damping regime. Nevertheless, these plasmons have a ﬁnite lifetime
[10, 50, 102, 104, 107]. This is because several mechanisms can provide the momentum
or energy to couple the plasmons with the single-particle phase space (i.e. Landau
damping), where the plasmons will decay into electron–hole pairs. For example,
120

www.ebook3000.com

high-energy plasmons can emit optical phonons in graphene (~0.2 eV) or scatter off
short-range defects along the edges which provide large momentum transfer [48, 102].
Other phonons such as the acoustic phonons in graphene or the polar substrate phonons
can also play an important role in the plasmon lifetimes [87, 97]. In sum, the damping rate
Γpl in graphene nanoribbons can be phenomenologically described by
Γpl ¼ Γ0 ω
ð Þ þ a
W ,
where Γ0 ω
ð Þ refers to the damping due to the various phonons and the latter is due to
scattering off the edges, where a is of the order of the Fermi velocity, and was experi-
mentally found to be a 	 2  106 m s1 [102]. We note that the latter effect is also
important in small plasmonic metal particles [51]. This simple model gives a good
account of the dominant plasmon damping observed in experiments [102]. The damping
rate can be obtained from the experimental spectra, through the full-width half max-
imum of the Lorentzian-like resonant proﬁle, δω, and is related via δω ¼ 2Γpl.
It is interesting to note graphene also accomodates peculiar one-dimensional
plasmons modes propagating along the edges [70, 96]; however, these do not ordinarily
couple to light. In fact, the fundamental mode in a graphene nanoribbon consists of such
localized edge modes [75], while the higher-order modes are usual cavity modes as we
discussed earlier. These edge modes were observed recently in an infrared near-ﬁeld
scattering optical microscope [35, 108].
By exploiting resonant excitation of plasmons, as discussed above, light absorption in
patterned graphene can be strongly enhanced. This enhanced absorption is related to the
oscillator strength of the plasmon resonance, which can be relatively strong, and even
lead to absorption cross sections that are higher than the size of the resonant structure

[15, 55]. Mid-infrared absorption spectra [10, 29, 100] on highly doped periodic
patterns of graphene nanodiscs revealed absorption fractions of around 10%, taking
into account the coverage fraction of the graphene, and up to 30% was observed by the
implementation of a Salisbury screen [49].
This is remarkably strong absorption considering that this plasmonic system is only
one atom thick, and usually absorbs only 2.3% [71]. Higher cross-sections are relevant
for applications such as sensing and light-harvesting or photodetection. A more intuitive
and quantitative insight is provided by the consideration that the absorption cross-
section σext is governed by the oscillator strength of the resonant plasmon mode, which
is in general proportional to the plasmon lifetime and the ratio of the carrier density and
effective mass n=meff. Due to the small effective mass of graphene charge carriers,
relatively large absorption cross sections are attainable. For a single-layer graphene

ﬃﬃﬃn

and thus σext / ω2
pτ. In order to increase the oscillator strength, one can
increase the plasmon resonance frequency (by reducing the size of the nanostructures or
by increasing n), the plasmon lifetime, or one can employ multi-layer graphene/insula-
tor stacks. It was shown in [100] that stacks of graphene disks exhibit enhanced
resonant absorption due to the coulomb interaction between the disks.
We remark that compared to conventional 2DEGs with typical densities up
to 1012 cm2, the density of graphene can be tuned to much larger values, up to
1014 cm2 [23, 52]. In combination with the smaller effective mass for graphene,
compared with the effective mass of charge carriers in semiconductors, the accessible
oscillator strength is much stronger for graphene resonant plasmon systems than for
conventional 2DEGS.
Additional advantages for conﬁning light to very small volumes are the prospects for
enhancing light–matter interactions, e.g., for sensing and enhanced non-linear response
[16, 17, 18, 67]. One of the key parameters for quantifying the strength of light–matter
interactions is the Purcell enhancement which is traditionally deﬁned for a dipolar
emitter coupled to an optical cavity. The Purcell factor P is proportional to Q=V, where
Q is the quality factor and V is the mode volume normalized by the free-space
mode volume λ3
0. The ratio Q=V was quantiﬁed in [10] for localized plasmon modes
in graphene ribbons 40 nm width. While the quality factor was fairly low, between 2.5
and 15, the mode volume was found to be extremely small, down to 106λ3. The ratio
Q=V was reported to be within the range 106107, in agreement with predictions by
[55]. This Q=V ratio is 2 orders of magnitude larger than ratios reported so far for
metallic nano wires [58, 61].
Plasmon–Phonon Coupling in Far-Field Experiments
As we have discussed in Section 7.1.5, many dielectrics have a dispersive permittivity
due to phonons, which strongly disturbs the electrodynamics of the plasmon. This can
be fully captured by the frequency-dependent permittivity, which in the case of phonons
is typically approximated by adding damped oscillator responses

where ε∞is the high-frequency dielectric constant, ωTOα is the natural vibration
frequency of the bulk optical phonon in the absence of long-range repulsion, δεα is
the oscillator strength, and γα the damping rate of the phonon mode α. Table 7.1
summarizes some of these paramaters for the common dielectric substrates for
graphene.
By plugging this permittivity into (7.11), or its extension discussed in Section 7.1.5,
one ﬁnds the full mode dispersion function kx ω
ð Þ that exactly includes the plasmon–
phonon hybridization. In far ﬁeld experiments on resonant nanostructures, however, one
does not measure kx but rather one measures the mode frequency for a ﬁxed kx
determined by the nanostructure size. One is more interested in the function ω kx
ð
Þ.
In this section, we consider the special case of graphene on top of an isotropic
dielectric with a single phonon mode, and show how for ﬁxed kx the “bare plasmon,”
which would have frequency ωpl, hybridizes with the “bare surface phonon mode” at
frequency ωSO, leading to a hybridization and splitting which is analogous to har-
monic oscillator coupling. The plasmon–phonon hybridization can also be understood
as a the long-range Frohlich coupling through the surface optical (SO) phonons [37].
In the simple case of a dielectric-vacuum surface, the surface phonon mode (SO) is
related to its bulk phonon frequency via ωSO ¼

One can easily recover the results ωþ ! ωSO and ω ! ωpl in the limit of zero
coupling, i.e. ωSO ! 0. Figure 7.5 shows the measured extinction spectra [102] for
graphene nanoribbons array on a polar substrate SiO2. Across the measured frequency
range, there are two SO phonon modes at ωSO1 ¼ 806 cm1 and ωSO2 ¼ 1168 cm1.
The coupling of these phonons with the graphene plasmon results in three coupled
plasmon–phonon modes, where the experimentally obtained dispersions (resonance
position of these spectra) are plotted in Fig. 7.4. Another SO phonon mode at
ωSO3 ¼ 406 cm1 resides outside the experimentaly frequency range.
Classical Harmonic Oscillators

plasmons) are often understood in classical terms with coupled harmonic oscillators.

We consider a typical physical situation where such a model can be applied.
Figure 7.6(c) shows the measured extinction spectra of a AB-stacked bilayer graphene
ribbon array for two incident light polarizations [44]. The optical response of bilayer
graphene has serveral interesting infra-red responses, such as mid-infrared plasmons,
the Γ point optical phonon at 0.2 eV, and interband response at ~ 0.4 eV [64]. In the
perpendicular polarization, the plasmons resonance is tuned to coincide with that of the
optical phonon. Their largely mismatched lifetimes and weak coupling results in an
induced transparency phenomenon, and can be largely reproduced by the simple
coupled oscillator model we describe here. As the plasmons and phonon detuning
increases, the induced transparency evolved into a Fano-like structure in the spectra
as shown in Fig. 7.6(d).
7.4.3
Exciting Plasmons by a Dipolar Emitter
A (point) dipolar emitter, placed close to the graphene, can couple efﬁciently to plasmons
because its momentum covers a wide range [55, 73]. In particular, for graphene, this
coupling can be very strong, leading to a signiﬁcant modiﬁcation of the emitter lifetime.

graphene distance and k⊥the inverse decay in the plasmon away from the surface. In
[91], the coupling between graphene plasmons and erbium emitters was observed. The
emission energy of erbium is 0.8 eV, and thus plasmons of 0.8 eV were excited, which is
promising for the prospects of data communication applications.

different emitter–graphene spacer layers. The emission contrast decreases for large
Fermi energies, unless a spacer layer of 12 nm or more is present. This reveals the
conﬁnement of the plasmon to the graphene sheet below a lengthscale of about 12 nm.

It is also insightful to inspect the Fresnel reﬂection coefﬁcient in a colorplot as a
function of wavevector and Fermi energy (as shown in Fig. 7.7). One can see the
intraband and interband excitations, as well as the plasmon resonance emerging at
Fermi energies above the emission energy of the emitter.

Real-Space Imaging of Plasmons by Scanning Probe Techniques
An appealing technique for studying and imaging high-momentum plasmons in real-
space is scattering near-ﬁeld microscopy (s-SNOM). This imaging technique is based
on light-scattering from a metal-coated and sharp AFM tip. This tip has an elongated
shape along the z-direction perpendicular to the surface, with an apex rounding radius
r 	 20 nm, which is sharp compared to the light wavelength r 	 110 μm. By illumin-
ating the tip, the light-scattering at the tip apex produces a nanoscale-induced electric
dipole oriented perpendicular to the surface. This dipole can excite optical ﬁelds with
the wavevector up to kmax 	 1=r. Additionally, due to the strong optical ﬁeld conﬁne-
ment under the apex of the tip, this technique enables imaging with a resolution of order
r, which is far below the diffraction limit.
The ﬁrst experiment exploiting this technique on graphene was performed by [34] for
the mid-infrared region 880–1270 cm1 (8–11 μm). Spectroscopic measurements of the
near-ﬁeld scattered light revealed a blue-shift of the optical phonon resonance of the
SiO2 substrate. This was explained by considering the hybridization of the SiO2 phonon
with the graphene plasmon. As discussed above, the plasmon–phonon interaction splits
the dispersion into two branches. The observed blue-shift was in agreement with the
energy shift associated to the higher branch and this energy shift was tunable by gate
voltages, conﬁrming the tunability of the plasmon–phonon hybridization, as expected
by theory [46, 54].

7.4 Experimental Observation of Graphene Plasmons
008
14 Aug 2017 at 14:29:49, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

The ﬁrst observation of the spatial proﬁle of propagating graphene plasmons [13, 32]
enabled direct probing of the plasmonic properties such as its dispersion, losses, and
scattering at edges and defects. These near-ﬁeld real-space imaging experiments are based
on the following principle, which is illustrated in Figs. 7.8(a) and (b). First, light scattered
at the tip launches plasmons that propagate along the surface of the graphene sheet (or
nanostructure). Next, these plasmons reﬂect at the edges of the graphene structure (or grain
boundaries). Part of these plasmons propagate back to the tip, and are subsequently
elastically scattered into photons, which are then detected with a pseudoheterodyne
interferometer. The scattered intensity is mainly sensitive to the z-component of the ﬁeld,
as the tip is comparatively much less efﬁcient in producing scattering of ﬁelds oriented
along the other two remaining directions. Therefore, the s-SNOM setup is collecting a
complex amplitude (including information on the phase) that is proportional to the z-
component of the ﬁeld produced by a dipole along z at its own position. The imaginary part
of this ﬁeld is the local density of optical states (LDOS). Thus, the detected signal is
qualitatively correlated with the vertical component of the LDOS [13], also called partial
LDOS. The experimental data and calculations show interference fringes which run
parallel to the edge and decay away from the edge. This is consistent with the aforemen-
tioned physical picture of the near-ﬁeld measurement technique.
Interestingly, the spatial proﬁle away from the edge (as shown in Fig. 7.8(c)) deviates
from what is expected from basic interference effects and decay due to plasmon
damping as well as additional decay in the signal due to the circular character of the
waves. These deviations can be attributed due to the inhomogeneous doping proﬁle at
the edge, the ﬁnite size of the scattering tip leading to multiple reﬂections close to the
edge, edge roughnesses or some additional intrinsic damping mechanisms. A more
elaborate model was developed [32] to take some of these effects into account. Further
from the edge, about one plasmon wavelength away, the near-ﬁeld signal ﬁts reasonably
well with a simple interference model, including an additional (non-lossy) decay factor
due to the cylindrical character of the plasmon wave

where k ¼ k1 þ ik2 is the complex plasmon wavevector. Propagation losses are char-
acterized by the ratio k1=k2, discussed in Section 7.3. Near-ﬁeld data and a ﬁt to this
basic equation are shown in Fig. 7.8(d). In [97], this was used to show that the lifetime
of plasmons in graphene can be as high as 500 fs, in the case of pristine graphene
encapsulated inside h-BN layers.
Because the near-ﬁeld imaging experiments probe the interference of forward- and
backward-propagating plasmons, the maxima of the interference fringes are separated
by half the plasmon wavelength λp=2. For excitation wavelengths of the range 811 μm,
a plasmon wavelength of about 70–500 nm was found [13, 97], which is about a factor
of 40 smaller than the free-space excitation wavelength. This is consistent with the
compression factor λp=λ0 ¼ α

owing
to the coupling of plasmons to the SiC surface phonons [13] (further discussed in
Section 7.4.2. Due to the strong dispersion of the SiC dielectric constant around the
phonon resonance, the plasmon wavelength was tuned over a very wide range while
varying the excitation wavelength only over a small range. This relatively “ﬂat”
dispersion was extracted from the near-ﬁeld experiments. Intriguingly, the coupling
between plasmons and phonons was shown to be tunable. The authors of [21] showed
that hyperbolic polaritons can be effectively modulated in a van der Waals
heterostructure.
The near-ﬁeld imaging technique is also suitable for probing localized plasmon
modes, such as standing waves between the edges of a ribbon. Due to the resonant
character of these modes, an enhancement of the near-ﬁeld signal was observed at the
resonance conditions where the ribbon width is comparable to λp or λp=2. This is

indicated by the white and red arrows in Fig. 7.9. These observations were consistent
with the LDOS calculations as shown in Fig. 7.9. Interestingly, the ﬁeld intensity is
maximum at the edges for the lowest order mode (indicated by the red arrows). This
suggests that the mode-proﬁle is equivalent to a Fabry–Pérot model with a zero-phase
reﬂection coefﬁcient. This situation is also encountered in plasmonic slot waveguides
[7] and plasmonic nanoantennas [25], and it originates in the complexity of the reﬂec-
tion of 3D electric ﬁelds at the edges.
An important aspect of graphene plasmons is the strong optical ﬁeld conﬁnement.
This feature was directly reﬂected by the observed resonant modes. Experiments
revealed a mode volume of about 106 below the free-space mode volume λ3
0 [13]. This
mode volume is extracted by measuring directly the mode-proﬁle in-plane. The decay in
the mode-proﬁle out-of-plane, with typical distance 1=k⊥can be extracted from the
relation k2
k 	 k2
⊥, and thus the plasmon decays exponentially away from the graphene
sheet with a typical length scale kk=2π. Here, kk can be extracted experimentally from
the in-plane mode-proﬁle.
Due to the strong plasmonic ﬁeld conﬁnement, it is possible to use the near-ﬁeld
imaging technique as a probe for nanoscale interactions. For example, grain boundaries
in CVD-grown graphene have been visualized using infrared s-SNOM. This has been
realized by infrared nanoimaging of reﬂected surface plasmons from the graphene grain
boundaries, and thus causing plasmon interference [14, 33]. In addition, the dynamical
response of graphene on a crystal of hexagonal boron nitride is signiﬁcanly altered due
to superlattic structures. In [72, 82], the formation of these collective modes is
discussed.
7.4.5
Plasmon Tuning
An important advantage of graphene plasmons compared to metallic plasmonic systems
is the tunability of the carrier density which governs the plasmonic properties such as
Fig. 7.9 Near-ﬁeld amplitude image acquired for a tapered graphene ribbon on top of 6H-SiC.
The imaging wavelength is λ0 ¼ 9:7 μm. The tapered ribbon is 12 μm long and up to 1 μm wide.

wavelength and damping. Various techniques are available for introducing charge
carriers in graphene:

The most common technique is electrostatic doping by a gate: the application of a
gate voltage leads to a potential difference between gate and graphene, inducing
additional charge carriers in the graphene. This shifts the Fermi energy up or
down, relative to the intrinsic Fermi energy without voltage applied. For pristine
graphene, the intrinsic doping is zero and therefore the Fermi energy is at the
Dirac (or charge-neutrality) point. However, contaminations on the surface, or
graphene–substrate interactions [41, 59], can lead to residual charge carriers in
graphene, shifting the Fermi energy away from the Dirac point. A major disad-
vantage of gating techniques is dielectric breakdown, which limits the Fermi
energy to about 0.3 eV

An alternative gating technique to reach higher doping levels is electrolyte gating.
Due to the nanometer-thick Debye layer, the electrical potential drops over a
distance of only a few nanometers, and thus a much larger gate capacitance
compared to oxides can be achieved. In this way, doping levels of up to
1014 cm2 have been realized [103] using a liquid electrolyte or a solid polymer
electrolyte gate [23, 28].

Even higher doping levels can be achieved by chemical doping techniques
[63, 31], such as surface transfer doping or substitutional doping. Unintentional
chemical doping is often encountered by species absorbed from the surroundings
or residual polymers used during device fabrication. Chemical treatments such as
intercalation can also be used to create intentional doping, e.g., for the purpose of
plasmonics or highly conductive transparent electrodes. Intercalation is the revers-
ible inclusion of a molecule (or group) between two other molecules (or groups).
An example is intercalating few-layer graphene with ferric chloride (FeCl3), for
which Fermi energies up to 1.5 eV and densities up to 91014 cm2 have been
realized, while maintaining charge carrier mobility of 2000–3500 cm2/V s [52].
Experimentally, in-situ plasmon tuning is exhibited by near-ﬁeld imaging experiments
as well as optical spectroscopy (see Fig. 7.10). Speciﬁcally, plasmon absorption peaks
shift to higher energies for higher n, due to “stiffening” of the plasmon wave. Addition-
ally, the amplitude of the absorption resonance increases for higher n due to the increase
in oscillator strength which scales with ω2
p. Quantitatively, the relation ωp / n1=4 was
reported for many experiments, based on spectroscopic or near-ﬁeld techniques [10, 13,
29, 32, 50]. This is as expected because for resonant plasmons the wavevector
kp / 1=
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ

is deﬁned (and thus independent of n) by the geometry and size W of the
structure while the relation between kp and ωp depends on n: kp / ω2
p=EF / ω2

p .
Thus, the plasmon resonance shifts to higher frequencies for higher EF, as kp is
constant. These observations have also been exploited to conﬁrm the Dirac fermion
nature of graphene plasmons (Dirac plasmons), as the resonance frequency depends on
carrier density according to ωp / EF / n1=4. In contrast, classical plasmons follow
the relation ωp / n1=2 because the effective mass is not dependent on n and thus the
Drude weight is proportional to the ratio of the carrier density and mass of the charge

ωpl / n1=4 due to carrier–carrier scattering have been predicted [62, 81], but have not
been conﬁrmed experimentally.
The tunability of the wavelength and losses of plasmons by in-situ tuning of the
carrier density by gate voltages was also revealed by near-ﬁeld measurements in various
ways. First, the location of the resonant “cavity-like” plasmon mode in the tapered
ribbon was tuned by gate voltages as discussed in [13]. For larger carrier concentration,
the resonant mode shifts to the wider part of the tapered ribbon, consistent with the
expected scaling λp / EF

. Moreover, the interference fringes close to an edge
exhibit an increase of fringe amplitude and periodicity with increasing n, as shown in
Fig. 7.10(b). By tuning the carrier density into the interband excitation regime
E < 0:7EF, strong damping was observed and the near-ﬁeld signal disappears (see
red band of Fig. 7.10(b)). In this way, it is possible to switch plasmons “on” and “off.”
7.4.6
Magnetoplasmons
Magnetoplasmons have been studied extensively for low frequencies (0–100 MHz) in
two-dimensional electron systems (e.g., Si and GaAs), both experimentally [68, 3] and
theoretically [36, 69, 92, 93]. Due to the low cyclotron mass of graphene carriers (about
2 orders of magnitude lower than in noble metals), plasmon resonances respond
strongly to the magnetic ﬁeld [19, 101], leading to a distinct splitting of the plasmon
mode at higher frequencies and for moderate ﬁelds of 1 T. This splitting was observed
for graphene nanodiscs at high excitation energies of up to 5 THz [19, 101].

Interestingly, the magnetoplasmons were observed not only for well-deﬁned circular
discs, but also for large-area CVD graphene containing natural nanoscale inhomogene-
ities, such as substrate terraces and wrinkles. These form natural scatterers for plasmons,
and can even lead to a strong THz plasmon resonance [19].

[36], where ω0 is the plasmon frequency at zero ﬁeld, and
ωc ¼ eB=mc is the cyclotron frequency. The higher frequency branch is the bulk
mode which increases with ﬁeld due to the ﬁeld-induced gap (cyclotron energy ħωc),
eventually approaching the usual cyclotron resonance which depends linear on ﬁeld.
The lower branch is a gapless collective mode conﬁned to the edge (edge magneto-
plasmon, also abbreviated as EMP) which decreases with the ﬁeld [36]. A remarkable
change in resonance line width was observed by [101]: the upper branch broadens for
increasing ﬁeld while the lower branch strongly sharpens for increasing ﬁeld. The latter
is due to the suppression of backscattering by the magnetic ﬁeld.
At even higher magnetic ﬁelds (and lower densities), the quantum hall regime can be
reached where edge electron transport is chiral and backscattering is fully suppressed.
Graphene edge magnetoplasmons in this quantum hall regime have been reported in the
time domain by Petkovic [77]. Ultra-fast voltage pulses, applied to a voltage probe
attached to a circular sheet of graphene, were used to launch EMP and ultra-fast voltage

measurements to probe the propagation in the time domain. A constant propagation
velocity was found, in contrast to the strong dispersion for bulk plasmons. Chiral
propagation of EMP along the edge was observed with extremely low attenuation,
corresponding to a plasmon relaxation time of 50 ps. This long plasmon lifetime reveals
additional advantages of EMP above bulk graphene plasmons.

Applications
Vibrational spectroscopy is a powerful, non-destructive analytical technique that pro-
vides a ﬁngerprint of molecular and bio-molecular structures. However, the interaction
of infrared light with wavelengths in the μm range with nm scale molecules is weak and
thus requires rather a large amount of the analyte. The large conﬁnement that graphene
plasmons offer at infrared wavelengths makes them promising candidates for the
enhancement of vibrational absorption spectra. The ﬁrst studies involved thin organic
layers such as MMMA and PVP on graphene nanoribbon arrays [99]. These polymers
contain C=O chemical groups, so the studies concentrated on the C=O vibrational
absorption at about 1700 cm1. Tuning of the plasmon frequency was achieved by
changing the width of the nanoribbons. When the plasmon resonance frequency was far
away from the vibrational frequency, normal vibrational absorption was observed. As
the overlap of the two excitations commenced, characteristic lineshape changes were
observed for light polarized perpendicular to the ribbons, and at resonance an EMT was
clearly observed (Fig. 7.5). For an 8-nm-thick PMMA ﬁlm, excitation resulted in a
transparency dip of 0.63% compared with a 0.25% absorption without the plasmon.
Taking into account the ﬁlling factor of the nanoribbon structure, this corresponds to a
ﬁve-fold enhancement of the absorption of the C=O in the ﬁlm. Deposition of PMMA
on the nanoribbon led to a red-shift of the plasmon absorption that increased with
increasing ﬁlm thickness due to the change in the dielectric environment. This type of
shift is utilized in refractive index sensors for organic and bio-organic systems. At
saturation coverage, the observed 260 cm1 shift corresponds to a high refractive index
sensitivity of ~2650 nm/RIU, a ﬁgure of merit used in plasmonic sensors [65]. From the
change of the red shift as a function of PMMA thickness, the 1/e decay in the plasmon
E-ﬁeld into the dielectric was obtained to be d0 ¼ 10  2 nm. Considering that the
incident light wavelength was λ0 ¼ 6 μm, this decay length corresponds to a conﬁne-
ment factor in the normal direction of λ0= 2πd0
ð
Þ 	 100, and similar results were
obtained with even thinner ﬁlms of PVP [100].
A similar approach was utilized to study the vibrational spectra of proteins [20]. The
proteins, recombinant protein A/G and goat anti-mouse IgG antibody, were deposited
on graphene nanoribbons and the vibrations associated with the C=O stretch and N—H
wag/C—N were monitored. In this case, the tuning of the plasmon was performed
electrostatically. By depositing the protein bilayer on the nanoribbons, a 160 cm1 red-
shift of the plasmon was observed. More recently, experiments in the submonolayer
molecular coverage utilizing PTCDA molecules on graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) were
performed. The plasmon resonance was controlled using chemical doping. At a

thickness below 0.6 nm, when no vibrations were observable in the conventional FTIR
spectrum, clear EMT transparencies were observed when the plasmon was in resonance
with the PTCDA C=O, ring C—C and C—H modes. Studies of the dependence on the
detuning of the plasmon and vibrational excitations showed that the C—C ring
vibrations couple stronger to the graphene plasmons through ππ interactions than
the dipole coupling of C=O. Given that the plasmon ﬁeld extends to a distance of about
the plasmon wavelength above the graphene surface, the spectra of gases whose
molecules are within that distance from the surface would be enhanced. This indeed
was demonstrated recently for acetone and hexane vapors [24].
All the studies of vibrational absorption enhancement by graphene plasmons that
have been performed so far involved a blanket coverage of the entire device surface.
However, the ﬁeld enhancement is mainly concentrated in certain regions, the so-called
“hot spots.” For example, in a GNR the ﬁeld is highest at the edges of the ribbon.
Simulations show that if molecules could be directed to such hot spot sites, for example
by factionalization, enhancements of many orders of magnitude would result. In a
recent computational study of the plasmonic enhancement of the vibrational
absorption of monolayers of the molecule pyridine over graphene nanodots, enhance-
ments of 3–4 orders of magnitude were predicted [2]. It was concluded that using
broadband light for excitation and scanning the graphene Fermi energy (through a gate),
the transmitted intensity would reproduce the infrared spectra without the need of a
spectrometer.
Since the graphene plasmons can enhance the infrared absorption, it can also be
employed to enhance infrared photodetectors [66]. Photodetection is driven by the carrier
heating effect, i.e. bolometric, and can be further optimized by eliminating heat loss
pathways as is commonly done in bolometers. Kirchhoff’s law tells us that the absorp-
tivity should equal the emissivity of a material which would imply an enhancement of the
infrared emission. Thermal emission from a graphene nanoribbon array on SiNx has been
studied [94]. Along with the broad thermal emission, two narrow band emissions at
1360 cm1 and 730 cm1 were observed. The 1360 cm1 emission was found to be
polarized perpendicular to the ribbon axis and to be tunable by changing the gate voltage.
The 730 cm1 band was essentially unchanged by gate bias. It was concluded that the
high-energy band is due to emission from the conﬁned plasmon of the ribbons, while the
low-energy emission is due to emission from the phonon of the underlying SiNx.
Another interesting application of graphene nanoresonators is to design electrically
tunable metasurfaces that can control the angle of reﬂection of an incident mid-infrared
beam [1, 27]. By utilizing nanoribbons with different widths (or doping), one can design
plasmon resonators that impart a spatially varying scattering phase to the impinging
light. In our classical harmonic oscillator discussion, the oscillator can have a different
phase shift with respect to the driving force, which also depends on the detuning
frequency. Such a phase gradient, dθ
dx, can result in an angle of reﬂection that differs

Electron Optics with Graphene
p–n Junctions
James R. Williams
8.1
Introduction
Quantum materials offer the opportunity to investigate electronic behavior beyond
electron-like excitations, and graphene is (from an electrical perspective) our highest-
quality quantum material. Its honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms produces a
gapless, linear energy dispersion, and electron mobility can now reach values near
1,000,000 cm2/V s [1–3]. Aside from reaching mobility near the best two-dimensional
semiconductor materials, its energy dispersion allows for novel device phenomena,
enhancing device capabilities beyond electronics based on conventional material elec-
trical devices. Within a few years of isolating single-layer graphene, several groups
developed methods to create adjacent p (hole-like) and n (electron-like) regions within a
single sheet of graphene [4–6] (Fig. 8.1). Around the same time, the role of disorder on
charge transport at low carrier densities was understood to be dominated by puddles of
electrons and holes [7, 8]. Hence, this junction is essential to many electrical properties
of graphene, and a thorough understanding of the role the p–n interface plays in electron
transport is essential.
Small devices, where the mean-free path is of the order of or greater than the device
size, enable the investigation of optics-like phenomena using electrons rather than
photons. For example, focusing on ballistic electrons using an electrostatic lens has
been demonstrated in GaAs two-dimensional electron gases [9, 10]. However, in typical
semiconductors, only carriers of the same sign of electrical charge are allowed in
adjacent regions – carriers of a different sign are separated by an insulating space where
the Fermi energy transitions through the band gap. For gapless materials such as
graphene, carriers are allowed to switch sides at the interface; electrons can be transmit-
ted or scattered as holes (and vice versa). From this come new phenomena, augmenting
the optics-like phenomena available to electrons. Further, the relative immunity of the
mean-free path to temperature in graphene [11] allows some of the novel optical
phenomena in graphene to persist to high temperatures (>100 K).
In this chapter, I will survey the current status of research in graphene p–n junctions.
In Section 8.2, the basic theory of electrical transport through a single p–n interface at
B = 0 and B > 0 (B is the magnetic ﬁeld) will be described. Section 8.3 will review three
aspects of the optical-like phenomena capable in graphene: Veselago lensing, conﬁne-
ment and guiding, and snake states. Recent experimental progress in this area will be
detailed. Finally, some key future research directions will be discussed in Section 8.4.

8.2
Basic Electrical Properties of p–n Junctions
8.2.1
Sublattices, Valleys, and Pseudospin
Graphene is known to posses a linear-in-energy band structure and the Hamiltonian of a
single sheet of graphene resembles the relativistic Dirac equation. At six high-symmetry
points in the Brillouin zone, the conduction and valence band meet at a single point
called a Dirac point; two of these reciprocal lattice points or “valleys” are unique,
termed the K and K0 points or Dirac points. The Dirac equation can be obtained from
tight-binding approximation [12] using nearest-neighbor hopping between the inequi-
valent lattice sites A and B (A to 3B atoms and B to 3A atoms). Using a small
momentum k expansion for values around the K and K0 points gives
E ¼ ℏνFk,
(8.1)
where ℏis Planck’s reduced constant and vF is the Fermi velocity. Embedded in the
hexagonal arrangement of carbon atoms is a degree of freedom associated with the
amplitude of the wave function on each of the A and B sublattices. This degree of
freedom can be viewed in a similar light to the spin associated with an electron, and
assume an “up” value for A sublattice and a “down” value for the B sublattice. For this
reason, the sublattice degree of freedom is called the pseudospin. The hopping motion
of electrons between the two lattices produces an artiﬁcial magnetic ﬁeld that is
proportional to the electron’s momentum. This gives a “handedness” or chirality to
the direction of the pseudospin that is opposite for electrons and holes. The pseudospin
texture for the K and K0 valleys are shown in Fig. 8.2(a). This has a fantastic effect on
transport of electrons in graphene: electrons are protected from backscatter by their
pseudospin and, for any pseudospin-preserving barrier, carriers are transmitted with unit

Fig. 8.1 (Above) Schematic of dual-gated graphene device used to create a p–n junction within
a single sheet. (Below) The electric ﬁeld provided by the gates in the above device produces a
potential difference in the graphene sheet, creating a transition region between electrons and
holes: a p–n junction.

probability (Fig. 8.2(b)). This is one description (albeit oversimpliﬁed) of the Klein
phenomena in graphene. However, the situation is complicated if carriers are allowed to
scatter between valleys. A right mover in the K valley has the same pseudospin as a left
mover in the K0 valley; hence for any scatterer that allows for the transfer of electrons
between valleys – intervalley scattering – the arguments above no longer hold.
8.2.2
Angular Dependence of Transmission, Sharp, and Smooth Barriers
The angular transmission of carriers across a p–n interface will be considered for two
situations: a sharp and a smooth barrier. A barrier is deﬁned as sharp or smooth by
comparing the Fermi wavevector kF to the width of the transition region between the n
and p regions, d. For kFd <1, the barrier is deﬁned as sharp, while for kFd >1 the
barrier is smooth. The transmission characteristics of a sharp barrier will be investigated
ﬁrst for each case of a symmetric junction: |n| = |p|.
A simple tight-binding approximation allows for an accurate construction of the
graphene band diagram and electron eigenstates. For a nearest-neighbor, tight-binding
approximation, the Hamiltonian is of the form H ¼ vFp  σ, which is identical to the
Dirac equation, with the role of spin being replaced by pseudospin. Eigenstates for this
Hamiltonian will therefore have the same spinor form

where tan θ
ð Þ ¼ ky=kx is the angle of the pseudospin vector (deﬁned below), s ¼ 1 for
electron/hole states, and χ are the spinors for electron and hole states. The sharp limit
consists of a step function barrier at the origin and is independent of y. The transmission
of an incident electron can be calculated by conserving the transverse component of
momentum ky, as demanded by the symmetry of the barrier, and by matching the
incident, reﬂected and transmitted spinor amplitudes at the interface x ¼ 0. First, the
former demands both specularity in the reﬂection angle (θr ¼ π  θi, where θi and θr
are the angle of incidence and reﬂection, respectively), giving rise to an equation similar
to Snell’s Law for the law of refraction in optics

(8.3)
where θt is the angle of transmission and En, Ep are the Fermi energies in the n and p
regions. Here is evidence of the ﬁrst demonstration of the novelty of graphene p–n
junctions. The ability to tune the Fermi energy to negative values (by tuning the region
to p-type carriers) allows for the index of refraction η to be negative, and the conse-
quences of this property will be considered later in this chapter. Matching the spinor
amplitude at the interface gives
χi þ rχr ¼ tχt ! r θi
ð Þ ¼ sieiθi  steiθt
sieiθi þ steiθt ,
(8.4)
where the relationship between θi and θr from above was used, and the incident and
reﬂected wave were taken to be in the n region. Solving for t for a symmetrically bias
junction gives tj j2 ¼ cos2 θi
ð Þ, and perfect transmission is obtained at normal (θi ¼ 0)
incidence, regardless of the height or length of the barrier. The perfect transmission
holds for conditions when the p–n junction is not symmetrically biased [13]. The
angular dependence of transmission can also be viewed through the lens of
pseudospin. An electron approaching the barrier at normal incidence from the right
has group velocity dE=dk > 0, with momentum ℏkx and right-pointing pseudospin. It is
transmitted as a hole with momentum ℏkx and right-pointing pseudospin (Fig. 8.2),
matching the incoming wave perfectly. For ﬁnite values of ky, which must be matched
on either side of the junction, there is a mismatch of incoming and outgoing pseudospin
of angle. The resulting reﬂection amplitude is related to the scalar product of the two
spinors: χ†
i  χt e sin θi
ð Þ.
For a potential that varies smoothly, the transmission properties of the barrier can be
treated within a WKB approximation. As can be seen in Fig. 8.3, the dispersion along kx
acquires a “ky-dependent gap”, resulting in a mimicked classical forbidden region
between n and p. The size of the forbidden region increases as ky increases, thus a
decreasing transmission probability with increasing ky is expected. The case of a linear
transition region between n and p was treated in [14] and it was found that the
transmission probability as a function of angle is

Thus, in either case – smooth or sharp – the barrier acts to decrease the transmission
probability. For example, in the case of a sharp junction symmetrically biased (|n| = |p|),
the effect of reduced transmission probability at angles of incidence away from zero is
to lessen the conductance by 2/3 [15]

j2 in both the sharp and smooth junctions acts as a collimator: only

discussed below. However, this collimation and other novel phenomena are lost when
an appreciable amount of disorder is added at the interface, as was studied in [16], hence
the peculiar properties of these junctions must be investigated under low-disorder
conditions.

Experimental Properties: Device Design and Basic Transport Properties
Fabrication of graphene p–n junctions have now gone through a number of generations.
Common to most devices is a two-gate conﬁguration consisting of a global back-gate
(either VBG or VB in this chapter) and a local top-gate (either V TG or VT in this chapter).
The global back-gate typically consists of the degenerately doped silicon wafer with a

silicon oxide on which sits the graphene device and controls the carrier density
everywhere on the sheet of graphene. A local top-gate covers only part of the graphene
device and the carrier density underneath is controlled by a linear combination of the
top-gate and back-gate. The coefﬁcients of this linear combination are controlled by the
capacitive coupling of the device at each gate. Early devices were created using gate
oxide which covered the sheet of graphene and electrically isolated the local gate.
Careful attention was paid to the oxide to ensure uniform coverage and the preservation
of the graphene sheet [5]. The next generation moved away from oxides to suspended
gates [17], avoiding the degradation of the graphene mobility in the oxide from the top-
gate geometries. The most recent version of graphene fabrication have eliminated the
oxide from both the back-gate and top-gate and replaced it with either a suspended gate
[18, 19] or boron nitride (substrate) [20] and either a suspended gate [21–24] or boron
nitride top-gate dielectric [25, 26]. This experimental progress has elevated the mobility
from around 10,000 cm2/V s to above 100,000 cm2/V s and has allowed for the investi-
gation of optics-like phenomena in graphene.
The transmission properties of a p–n junction fabricated using the clean methods
above were ﬁrst reported by [23, 24]. An air bridge device micrograph and resistance
data are reproduced in Figs. 8.4(a) and (b). This air-bridge produces two back-to-back
p–n junctions, each of which can be characterized by the above t θi

junctions (Eq. (8.5). Figure 8.4(b) shows the increase in resistance produced by
driving the top-gated region to an opposite polarity (p–n–p), resulting in an increase
in resistance above the unipolar resistance associated with the angle-average transmis-
sion. In addition to this increase in resistance, regular conductance oscillations are
observed and these oscillations can be useful in decoding the nature of transmission at
the interface. These are the electronic analog of the Fabry–Pérot effect in optical
cavities, whereby multiple reﬂections at the two parallel p–n interfaces interfere and
give rise to the coherent addition of electron waves, producing regular peaks in
conductance. Measuring the conductance provides only an indirect method of probing
the Klein paradox, since conductance measures the angle-average of t θi

provide a direct measure of Klein tunneling [27], where a phase shift occurs directly as
a result of the Klein paradox in graphene [28]. With the increase in quality of graphene
devices, Fabry–Pérot resonances can now be observed in micron-sized gated regions,
indicating top-gate devices can be fabricated with mean-free paths greater than
1 micron (Fig. 8.4(c)) [23, 24].
8.2.4
Transport Properties in a Magnetic Field
At magnetic ﬁelds large enough to produce the quantum Hall effect in graphene, edge
states form and the p–n junction plays an important role in determining the conductance
of the device. The n and p regions have opposite directions of propagation in the
quantum Hall regime, and at the interface each edge state copropagates along the
junction with its partner (Fig. 8.5(a)). Should there be no crosstalk between the two
adjacent edge states, the two-terminal conductance will be zero. Any amount of

crosstalk will cause equilibration between the left edge state at potential V and right
edge state at potential 0, and the amount of equilibration will determine the conduct-
ance. In the case of full mixing – deﬁned by the condition that a carrier approaching the
junction in one edge state has equal probability of leaving the junction in either edge
state – the conductance of a p–n junction is given by the ﬁlling factors of the Landau

the junction [29, 30]. For high-mobility graphene devices, moderate magnetic ﬁelds
allow for spin and valley resolved edge states. In the bipolar regime, the lowest Landau

Photon Analogies for Carriers in Graphene

Introduction
Electron-light analogies are provided by the similarities between the Helmholtz equa-
tion for light waves and the time-independent Schrödinger equation for electrons.
Diffusive electron motion in disordered, and interacting conductors can spoil this
analogy. Some conductors can now be synthesized with extremely low disorder levels
and devices can be fabricated with dimensions below the typical length scale for
scattering and phase relaxation. In such ballistic coherent devices at low temperatures,
the electrons can be described by a wave function that satisﬁes a time-independent
Schrödinger whose quantum wave function propagates in a similar fashion to geometric
ray optics (à la Huygens construction). For example, the ability to locally tune densities
in nanostructures in conventional two-dimensional electron gases produces a Snell-like
Law [32]. This analogous equation allows for micron and nanoscale devices to mimic
ray optical devices such as lens, prisms, beam splitters, and waveguides. In addition, the
charge degree of freedom of electrons allows for manipulation of electron trajectories
with magnetic ﬁelds [33].
In ballistic graphene devices, similar optics-like devices are possible except with the
added degree of freedom that both positive and negative values of η in adjacent regions.

This addition allows for a variety of optical phenomena with electrons to either enable
or enhance compared to conventional semiconductors. For example, optics-like devices
have been proposed in graphene to study collimation [34], waveguides [35–38], snake
states [39–42], Vesalago lenses [43], whispering gallery modes [44, 45], and the
quantum Goos–Hänchen effect [46], to name a few.
Soon after the implementation of local gates to produce p–n junctions in graphene,
experimental evidence for novel optical phenomena were observed including Fabry–
Pérot oscillations [27], optical guiding of carriers [47], and snake states [48]. The clarity
of the observation of optics-like phenomena has been enhanced by rising mobility
values from the creation of suspended graphene and graphene–boron nitride hetero-
structures. After boron nitride was used as a substrate to enhance the mobility of
graphene [20], boron nitride was also implemented as a nanometer-thin tunneling
barrier [49], and gate dielectric [26] and p–n junctions with transition regions less than
the Fermi wavelength were possible. In conjunction with the micron-scale mean-free
path, devices were now capable of exploring the effects on transport of a negative index
material. Below three optical phenomena – Vesalago lensing, conﬁnement and guiding,
and snake state – will be reviewed, illustrating both theoretical and experimental works,
elucidating the physics explored therein.
8.3.2
Veselago Lensing
Materials with negative index of refraction can occur when the group velocity (dE=dk) is
opposite in sign to the phase velocity (momentum) as is the case for electrons and holes in
graphene. The reformulation of optical laws for negative index materials was ﬁrst con-
sidered by Vesalago [50]. That Snell’s Law can accommodate negative index of refraction
materials by simply allowing for negative values of η is by no means obvious. A consider-
ation of Fermat’s principle of least time for geometric rays which accounts for negative
index materials led to the postulate that the path of light is a local extremum of the length of
the optical path [50, 51]. With this addition, the laws of geometric optics can describe
negative index materials taking the refractive indices to include values less than zero. For
example, an extremum for the optical path for two materials with opposite values of η,
η1 ¼ η2, paths which satisfy the modiﬁed Fermat’s principle are shown in Fig. 8.6(a).
Applications of graphene for use in negative refractive index materials was ﬁrst
proposed in [43]. Using the modiﬁed Snell’s law for negative index materials, the
authors were able to show the focusing of electrons for convergent parallel plate
(Vesalago) lenses and investigate the wave singularities (caustics) in asymmetric
junctions (η1 > 0, η2 < 0, η1 6¼ η2). Device schematics for observing Vesalago lensing
were also proposed (for similar devices, see Fig. 8.6(b)). Typical device operation is as
follows: current is provided to the device through the injector and the current extracted
at the “focused” contact (β) is compared to that at one or two other contacts (α and γ). At
the gate voltage (typically the top-gate voltage VT) such that η1 ¼ η2, the extracted
current in β is enhanced compared with α and γ.
Using boron nitride-encapsulated devices, Lee et al. [52] have observed the ﬁrst
evidence in transport of negative refraction in graphene. A schematic of the device and

the lensing effect is shown in Fig. 8.7(a) where graphene is ﬁrst deposited on top of a
boron nitride substrate, following by deposition of an additional boron nitride on top of
the graphene serving as the gate dielectric (Fig. 8.7(b)). The thickness of the boron
nitride top-gate dielectric was estimated to be 14 nm, resulting in a junction sharpness of
~12 nm. Current is injected into the upper left corner of the device and signatures of
lensing were obtained by analyzing the current extracted from the lower right-hand
corner, I2. Vesalago focusing peaks are observed on the bipolar side of the normalized

observed), indicated by gray triangles in Figs. 8.7(c) and (d). The data are taken at a
temperature of 100 K, suggesting that the observed peaks are a result of classical electron
trajectories, consistent with expectations from lensing. The focusing peak moves linearly
with back-gate voltage VB and diminishes as the magnitude of VB increases; the latter is
a result of the decreasing ratio of the Fermi wavelength to width of the p–n junction and
the former an indication that the peak arises from changes in density (rather than a
random disorder-induced increase in I2). Further evidence of negative index refraction is
obtained in measurements of a non-local resistance (Rnl). Electrons are injected from a
contact on the lower left and the voltage difference between two contacts, one roughly
aligned with the injected electrons and one aligned with the path expected from Snell’s
Law with a negative η (Fig. 8.8(a)). At the value of VT, where electrons are expected to
refract towards the lower contact, an increase in non-local resistance (Fig. 8.8(b), white
triangle) is seen, consistent with expectations for η < 0.
8.3.3
Conﬁnement and Guiding
In addition to lensing, p–n junctions permit conﬁnement of carriers, a phenomenon
made difﬁcult by the gapless nature of carriers in graphene. Carriers approaching a p–n
junction at large angles of incidence have a high probability of being reﬂected and this
effect can be used to conﬁne carriers in graphene, and interesting trapped state behav-
iors in 1D channels [53] and 0D whispering gallery modes [45] have been reported. For
example, placing two adjacent, parallel interfaces (Fig. 8.9(a)) along a device creates a
channel capable of conﬁning carriers that approach the barrier with large angles of

incidence, or equivalently, large values of ky=kx, where ky and kyx are the components of
momentum parallel and perpendicular to the channel. The resulting guiding has been
studied theoretically [35–38], numerically [47], and experimentally [47, 53]. For chan-
nels in graphene with index of refraction η1 surrounded on either side by regions with
η2 6¼ η1, three effects combine to promote conﬁnement of carriers to the channel.
A ﬁber-optic analogue is where carriers experience total internal reﬂection called optical
guiding OPG. This effect occurs for angles of incidence above a critical angle deﬁned as

where E1, E2 are the in-channel and out-of-channel Fermi energies, respectively. In
addition, reﬂection can occur due to the small transmission probability of a p–n junction
at large angles, called p–n junction guiding PNG. Shown in Fig. 8.9(b) is a quantum
transport simulation of the guiding values for PNG at a Fermi energy of –0.2 eV inside

measured in a similar fashion to Veselago (Fig. 8.9(a)); current is injected into the
channel through an injector contact and collected at a contact at the opposite end of
the channel. This current is compared to the current lost to two contacts placed outside
the channel. As the channel becomes smaller (or, equivalently, the Fermi wavevector
becomes smaller as the channel is depleted), the number of propagating modes can
become quantized due to conﬁnement of carriers in the channel. Figures 8.10(a) and (b)
shows an example of a high-quality graphene electron waveguide.
In [53], a graphene sheet is suspended above a dual-gate geometry and the channel
density can be controlled by the local bottom-gate of width 350 nm. In this work, guiding
efﬁciencies were experimentally extracted as the ratio of the current collected at the
collector contact C to the total current injected into the device: γ ¼ ISC=ITOT. Figures 8.11
(a) shows γ as a function of nin and nout. The grey dashed lines separate regions where
guiding occurs. Light gray regions are where neither PNG nor OPG guiding occur, and
arise from the ﬁnite transmission probability of electrons traversing the graphene device.
In the right and left quadrants to the two crossed lines, guiding occurs: for nin*nout > 0,
it is OPG and for nin*nout < 0 it is PNG (or a combination of p–n and OPG, although
this distinction is not made in the paper). It is clear that the two effects enhance the
guiding, and guiding is observed to be largest when the two mechanisms both contribute
(black regions of Fig. 8.11(a)). As nin is increased from zero in the PNG regime, steps in
the guiding efﬁciency are seen (indicated by arrows in Fig. 8.11(a)). One-dimensional
cuts of the plot of γ nin; nout
ð
Þ are shown in Fig. 8.11(b) where steps in γ are observed and
attributed to a momentum-dependent ﬁlling and ﬁltering effect of modes in the channel.
This mode ﬁltering effect allows for the transmission properties of single channels to be
probed, and gives rise to quantum point contact in γ.

magnetic focusing [54]. Application of moderate magnetic ﬁelds enables another mode
of conﬁnement at the interface of p and n regions in graphene resulting from the
alternating sign of the Lorentz force on either side of the junction. Above a critical
magnetic ﬁeld – deﬁned when the magnetic length becomes less than the width of the
junction – no conductance is theoretically expected across the junction (in the absence
of disorder) and the only propagating states are those which move parallel to the
junction in skipping and snake-like trajectories [55] that have measurable effects on
transport [48]. A detailed theoretical analysis of this phenomenon is given in [41].

either reﬂected into skipping orbits or are transmitted across the interface. Transmitted
carriers experience an opposite Lorentz force as a result of the change in sign of the
charge and are bent back towards the interface. Successive transmission across the
interface form an oscillating trajectory about the p–n junction called a “snake state,”

example, for x0 ¼ rn ¼ rp (see starred plot in Fig. 8.12) only features arising from
snake state trajectories occur. A semiclassical description of the case rn ¼ rp which
accounts for the coherent quantum interference effects, predicts that the probability
amplitude of ﬁnding the electron on either side of the junction oscillates, depending on
the number of times the electron (classically) traverses the interface. Even and odd
number of crossings puts the electron on either the same or opposite side of the junction
(Fig. 8.13(a)), and in [41] this effect was predicted to have a impact on conductance,
contributing to an oscillation component of the conductance with a period of 1/B, the
inverse of the magnetic ﬁeld.
Oscillatory behavior unique to the bipolar regime has been explored in encapsulated
[56] and suspended [57] graphene devices. Conduction along a p–n junction can be
predicted by considering the electron motion in a semiclassical billiard model. For
carriers approaching the interface from the injector side, four possible interface trajec-
tories are possible depending on the density in each region. In the snake state regime,
conductance is enhanced if the end point of the semiclassical trajectory is on the
collector side (Fig. 8.13(a), left schematic). The shape of the conductance oscillations

orbits rn,p injected a distance x0 from the p–n interface. For a balanced |n| = |p| junction (starred
plot, second from the right), the transmission along the interface is dominated by snake states

as a function of VBG and V TG simulated in Fig. 8.13(b) is unique to snake state
behavior, distinct from both Shubnikov–de Haas and Fabry–Pérot oscillations. Experi-
mental results of the differential conductance dG=dVTG plotted over the same voltage
range are shown in Fig. 8.13(c) and show good agreement with the simulations.
Remarkably, the snake state trajectory crosses the interface ~50 times over the
12.2 micron long p–n junction, showing an impressive immunity to the disorder, despite
the susceptibility to disorder near the low-density transition region of the junction [58],
a testament to the sharpness of the interface created in this encapsulated device. Further,
as with other optical phenomena seen in this chapter, the oscillations persist above a
temperature of 100 K.
8.4
Future Directions
The introduction of new fabrication techniques have allowed for investigation of
electron optics phenomena in graphene. However, clarity of experimental results is
lagging behind that of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases despite similar
levels of disorder in the two systems. One source of this discrepancy is the lack of
injection techniques in graphene with well-deﬁned momentum, unlike GaAs where
electron collimation is possible in quantum point contacts [59, 60]. Collimation tech-
niques in graphene are difﬁcult using point contacts, due to the difﬁculty of creating
one-dimensional channels in the gapless material. However, collimation using an array
of p–n junctions [34] or using one-dimensional channels of graphene [53] might now be
possible, given the high quality of current graphene devices and the expected immunity
to disorder in p–n junction arrays [61].

In addition, the Schrödinger equation is a function of a scalar quantity and hence can
only be related to a single component of the electric or magnetic ﬁeld in the Helmholtz
equation. The wave function for graphene has a spinor form and more resembles a Jones
vector representing polarized light, as was noted in [62]. In structures created from a
p–n junction superlattice, collimation occurs through a collapse of the pseudospin
vector in the direction perpendicular to the superlattice [34]. Hence linear and circularly
polarized light analogues through pseudospin control in graphene should be possible,
offering an interesting future direction of research.

Introduction
Graphene, a single atomic sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice, has
taken centre stage in materials science both for fundamental studies and many potential
applications, ever since its ﬁrst discovery about a decade ago. In particular, graphene
exhibits many unique characteristics that make it a highly attractive material for the new
generation of electronics, with an unprecedented combination of speed and ﬂexibility [1].
For example, graphene exhibits the highest carrier mobility up to 1,000,000 cm2/Vs
(i.e., ~2–3 orders of magnitude higher than that of silicon) (Fig. 9.1(a)) [2–5] and the
highest carrier saturation velocity of all known materials (Fig. 9.1(b)) [6], making it a
potential channel material for ultra-high-speed transistors [7]. Additionally, the single-
atom thickness represents the ultimate limit for down-scaling [8–13], while the large-area
two-dimensional structure makes it suitable for large-scale integration [14–16], and the
exceptional mechanical strength and elasticity make it desirable for highly robust ﬂexible
electronics [16].
However, the lack of an intrinsic band gap in graphene has limited the achievable
on/off ratio in transistors using graphene as the active channel. Considerable efforts have
been devoted to addressing this challenge, including the induction of a transport gap in
graphene nanostructures [22–33] or bilayer graphene [34–37]. The creation of a transport
gap in graphene nanostructures or bilayer graphene can improve the on/off ratio [22, 24,
38], but often at a cost of the electronic performance and the deliverable current density.
For example, graphene nanoribbons obtained from a lithographic cutting approach
typically exhibit carrier mobility of the order of 100–1,000 cm2/Vs or less, which is
2–3 orders of magnitude smaller than that of the pristine graphene [39–45]. With
single-atom thickness, ﬁnite density of states (DOS), and weak electrostatic screening
effect, graphene exhibits a ﬁeld-tunable work-function and partial electrostatic trans-
parency. It can thus function as an “active” contact in graphene-semiconductor junc-
tions to enable entirely new possibilities for device design and engineering. Exploiting
graphene as a tunable contact in the vertical heterostructures [46–51] with diverse
semiconductors or insulators, new designs of devices, including vertical tunneling
transistors [46, 47], vertical ﬁeld-effect transistors [48], barristers [51], and vertical
thin ﬁlm transistor [49, 50] have been demonstrated with a greatly improved on/off
ratio and current density.

In this chapter, we review the recent progress in exploring graphene as the semicon-
ducting channel for ultra-high-speed transistors or as an active contact for a whole new
generation of tunable electronic and optoelectronic devices. Speciﬁcally, we will ﬁrst
discuss exploring pristine graphene as the active channel for radio frequency (RF)
transistors and its potential application in analog circuits. For band-gap engineering,
we will discuss graphene nanostructures, including graphene nanoribbons and graphene
nanomeshes, and bilayer graphene as the active channel for transistors with an improved
on/off ratio. Finally, we will discuss the exploration of graphene as a tunable contact for
the design and creation of a variety of vertical graphene transistors, and ﬁnish with a
brief summary and perspective.

With superior carrier mobility and current saturation velocity, graphene is well suited
for RF analog applications. The performance of an RF transistor (see the Fig. 9.2(a) for
the equivalent circuit diagram) is typically characterized by the cut-off frequency, fT, at
which the magnitude of the small-signal current gain rolls off to unity (|h21| = 1). The
cut-off frequency, fT, is generally determined by

where gm is the transconductance; Cgs, Cgd, CG is the parasitic capacitance of gate-source,
gate-drain, and gate, respectively, and RS, RD is the resistance of source and drain.
While fT is of considerable importance in determining the intrinsic speed of RF
devices, for analog applications, another important ﬁgure-of-merit is the maximum
oscillation frequency fMAX, which is the highest possible operating frequency before a
transistor loses its ability to amplify power. This value is typically deﬁned as the
frequency at which the unilateral gain (U) becomes unity and is generally governed
by the following formula

where go is output conductance and Ri is the intrinsic resistance.
In general, the speed of an RF transistor is proportional to the intrinsic transconduc-
tance, gm, and inversely proportional to all the parasitic capacitances and resistances.
Therefore, to achieve a high-frequency device, it is necessary to maximize the trans-
conductance using high-mobility materials (e.g., graphene), reducing the channel
length, optimizing the gate coupling (e.g., using high-k dielectrics), and reducing
parasitic capacitance and access resistance (e.g., using optimized device geometry with
self-aligned source and drain electrodes to minimize the source-gate and drain-gate gap
or overlap). In particular, to create a functional RF transistor, it is necessary to integrate
a local gate (typically top-gate) to minimize the large parasitic capacitance in global
back-gated devices. The creation of top-gated graphene transistors requires effective
integration of high-quality gate dielectrics with graphene, which is non-trivial since the
most conventional dielectric integration approach is not compatible with the pristine
clean graphene. Typical dielectric deposition approaches either result in poor dielectrics
with considerable trapping states or severely damage the pristine graphene lattice and
degrade its carrier mobility [52].
The ﬁrst graphene RF transistor was reported in 2009 using epitaxial graphene and
atomic layer deposition (ALD) deposited Al2O3 as the gate dielectrics, with a relatively
low cut-off frequency 4.4 GHz [53]. The performance of the device is largely limited by
the relatively low-quality gate dielectrics and severely degraded carrier mobility
(~200 cm2 V–1 s–1) in graphene during the dielectric deposition process. By depositing
a functionalization layer consisting of 50 cycles of NO2-trimethylaluminum (TMA)
prior to the ALD growth of gate oxide, a uniform coating of oxide with less pinholes
can be deposited on mechanically peeled graphene, which soon enabled the demonstra-
tion of faster graphene transistors [10]. The new device architecture consists of two
parallel channels controlled by a single gate in order to increase the drive current and
device transconductance. For a device with a gate length of 150 nm, a peak fT as high as
26 GHz is obtained. Furthermore, an fT = 50 GHz was demonstrated in a 350 nm gate
length device by the same group (Fig. 9.2(b)) using a thin layer of naturally oxidized
Al2O3 as the nucleation layer for the deposition of high-k gate dielectrics to minimize
graphene mobility degradation and simultaneously using a back-gate modulation to
electrostatically dope the graphene and reduce the access resistance. A further key

development in dielectric integration is to use an interfacial polymer layer as the buffer
layer for the ALD of high-k dielectrics, which minimizes the mobility degradation to
achieve a mobility value of 900 to 1520 cm2 V–1 s–1 in a top-gate graphene transistor.
With this approach, a 240 nm channel length graphene transistor has been demonstrated
with the fT as high as 100 GHz (Fig. 9.2(c)), marking an important milestone in the
development of graphene RF transistors [8].
Despite the tremendous progress, the reported RF performance was still far from the
potential that the graphene transistors can promise, which is primarily limited by two
adverse factors in the device fabrication process. The ﬁrst limitation is associated with
the severe mobility degradation resulting from the graphene–substrate interaction and
graphene–dielectric integration processes, which introduce considerable scattering
sources which reduce carrier mobility. In particular, the dielectric integration processes
have typically severely damaged the graphene lattice and reduced carrier mobility by
1–2 orders of magnitude. To mitigate the mobility degradation effect during the dielec-
tric deposition process, a dry transfer approach has been developed for dielectric
integration without any obvious impact to graphene mobility. For example, using dry
transferred Al2O3 nanoribbons as the top-gate dielectrics, a highest carrier mobility of
23,000 cm2 V–1 s–1 has been achieved [5, 13, 54].
A second limitation of the top-gated graphene transistor is the large access resistance
due to non-optimum alignment of the source, drain and gate electrodes, which can have
particularly adverse effects on short channel devices that are necessary for high-
frequency applications. To this end, a self-alignment process has been designed to
ensure that the edges of the source, drain and gate electrodes are automatically and
precisely positioned so that no overlapping or signiﬁcant gaps exist between these
electrodes, thus simultaneously minimizing parasitic capacitance and access resistance
[13, 54].
A notable development in this regard is the utilization of a dry-transferred nanowire
as the self-aligned gate for an ultra-high-speed graphene transistor [13]. In this device, a
synthetic Co2Si/Al2O3 core/shell nanowire is used as the gate electrode to deﬁne the
channel length on a mechanically exfoliated graphene ﬂake, with the 5 nm Al2O3 shell
functioning as the gate dielectrics, and the metallic Co2Si core functioning as the local
top-gate. At the same time, the nanowire gate is used as a shadow mask for the
deposition of an ultra-thin layer of platinum thin ﬁlm pads, which naturally separates
into two isolated parts at the left and right sides of the gate to function as the self-aligned
source and drain electrodes. Using this approach, a record high cutoff frequency of
300 GHz is achieved in a 144 nm transistor (Fig. 9.2(d)). Its performance is about twice
as fast as the best silicon MOSFETs of comparable sizes and is similar in speed to the
best InP high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) and GaAs metamorphic HEMT
(mHEMT) with similar channel lengths.
Despite the considerable potential demonstrated with mechanically exfoliated gra-
phene, it is intrinsically unsuitable for large-scale integration. To this end, large-area
graphene by CVD or the epitaxial method has also been explored for RF transistors
[59]. An fT up to 210 GHz has been achieved in 210 nm epitaxial graphene transistors
[8, 60]. With the channel length shrinking to about 40 nm, the fT of the CVD graphene

device on a diamond like carbon substrate can reach 300 GHz, and the epitaxial
graphene device can offer an fT of 350 GHz (Fig. 9.2(e)) [56]. Additionally, a
transfer-gate approach has also been developed to create 67 nm long self-aligned
graphene transistors with the highest cut-off frequency of 427 GHz in mechanical
exfoliated graphene [54]. Compared with the transferred nanowire gate described
above, the transfer gate stack is ﬁrst deﬁned on a sacriﬁcial substrate using a scalable
lithography process; it is thus compatible for mass production of graphene RF devices
when applied to large-area CVD graphene [13, 54].
In summary, graphene has been shown to exhibit considerable potential for RF transis-
tors applications. In general, the intrinsic cutoff frequency of graphene RF transistors
exceeds the best silicon MOSFET devices with comparable dimensions and is on par with
the best group III–V HEMT devices (Fig. 9.2(g)), while the maximum oscillation frequen-
cies are generally worse than those of silicon or group III–V transistors (Fig. 9.2(h)),
largely due to the lack of band gap and current saturation. On the other hand, with the
availability of large-area CVD graphene, graphene could offer an attractive material for
low-cost large-area ﬂexible RF electronics. Additionally, it should be noted that the
performance of current graphene transistors is still limited by the practical issues in
material integration and device fabrication processes, and the ultimate performance of
graphene transistors could far exceed what is achieved today [52]. It has been predicted
that an optimized graphene transistor can deliver an intrinsic cut-off frequency over 1 THz
when the channel length is reduced to 70 nm or 5 THz at 10 nm channel length [58, 61].
Importantly, an experimental projection based DC study of ultra-short channel graphene
transistors with a self-aligned GaN nanowire gate suggests such high-speed operation is
indeed possible in the optimized graphene transistors (Fig. 9.2(i)) [12, 62, 63].
9.2.2
Graphene RF Circuits
The demonstration of graphene RF transistors with both the intrinsic cutoff frequency
and maximum oscillation frequency well exceeding 1 GHz can open up exciting
opportunities for applications in RF electronics. Inspired by the rapid advancements
in single graphene RF devices, graphene RF functional circuits have been fabricated,
such as the graphene ampliﬁer [56], frequency multiplier [64], frequency mixer [65],
and oscillator [66]. For example, exploiting the unique ambiploar characteristics of
graphene transistors, a frequency doubler can be readily created. Figures 9.3(a) and (b)
show a typical graphene frequency doubler, which doubles the input frequency from
1.05 GHz to 2.10 GHz [67]. In practice, frequency multiplication is a key signal
generation technique, where a signal of frequency f0 is introduced to a non-linear
element to generate harmonics at higher frequencies, which is central for all major
areas of analog communications, radio astronomy, and terahertz sensing. A graphene
frequency mixer has also been demonstrated (Figs. 9.3(c) and (d)), where the input
frequency is 4.0 GHz and 3.8 GHz, and the detected output frequency includes the
frequency superposition (7.8 GHz) and frequency difference (0.2 GHz) [65]. In add-
ition, graphene RF receiver integrated circuits (IC) have also been developed to perform
signal ampliﬁcation, ﬁltering, and down conversion mixing [65]. It has been shown that

graphene nanostructures, including graphene nanoribbons and graphene nanomeshes,
have been suggested to induce a size-tunable band gap due to the quantum conﬁnement
and edge effects. Graphene nanoribbons were ﬁrst proved to be an effective way to
introduce a tunable transport gap when its width is reduced down to a sub-100 nm or
even sub-10 nm regime. Similarly, graphene nanomeshes have also been shown to
exhibit a band gap that is tunable by the hole and neck size (constriction width).
9.3.1
Graphene Nanoribbion Transistors
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) are a type of graphene nanostructure with an extended
structure in one dimension for charge transport and highly constricted geometry (e.g.,
sub-10 nm) in the other dimension for quantum conﬁnement. Due to the asymmetry of
graphene lattice (Fig. 9.4(a)), a perfect graphene nanoribbon can display two typical
edge structures, armchair (ac) and zig-zag (zz). GNRs are predicted to be semiconduct-
ing due to edge effects and quantum conﬁnement of the electron wave function in the
transverse direction. Theoretical studies suggest the band gap of GNRs scales inversely
with their width, and a width in the sub-10 nm regime is required to achieve a several
hundred meV band gap, which is needed for logic transistor operation (Fig. 9.4(b)).
Additionally, it has also been suggested that the edge states can have a profound effect
on the transport gap opening and the charge transport properties.
It is non-trivial to experimentally prepare GNRs with controllable size and smooth
edge in the sub-10 nm regime. Using electron beam lithography or atomic-force
microscopy (AFM) lithography, GNRs of variable widths have been achieved, but
typically with relatively rough edges and poor width uniformity [22]. Beyond the
traditional lithography, chemical templates (such as nanowires) have been explored as
the etch mask to produce ultra-narrow (sub-10 nm) GNRs with relatively smooth edges
[23]. Herein size controllable GNRs with a nearly atomically smooth line edge can be
readily obtained by tuning the nanowire diameter and etching time.
Taking a step further, using a conducting/dielectric core/shell nanowire as the etching
mask and the gate electrode, a top-gated GNR transistor can be made with ultra-thin
gate dielectrics and uncompromised electronic properties (Figs. 9.4(c) and (d)). It has
thus enabled the best-performing GNR transistor with the maximum transconductance
reaching up to 3.2 mS μm–1, outperforming that of silicon transistors. The effectiveness
of the band-gap opening was also seen by the transistor characteristics with an on/off
ratio about two orders of magnitude (Fig. 9.4(e)) [24]. Besides using the lithographic
approach to cut GNR from the graphene sheet, unzipping carbon nanotubes is also an
interesting method to obtain GNRs (Fig. 9.4(f)), either by chemical methods [69] or
plasma etching [25]. By selectively unzipping CNTs, it has also been demonstrated that
a GNR-CNT intramolcular junction can be created with a well-deﬁned diode effect [26].
The GNRs obtained from the lithographic approach generally exhibit ill-deﬁned edge
structures. Alternatively, the bottom-up synthetic chemistry has also been recently
employed to synthesize GNRs with precisely deﬁned edge structures [70]. With the
bottom-up synthesis approach, the exact atomic structures as well as the hetero-atom
doping can be rationally designed by choosing proper precursor molecules. It can
167

therefore allow the creation GNR heterostructures with seamlessly assembled segments
of pristine (undoped) GNRs (p-GNRs) and deterministically nitrogen-doped GNRs
(Fig. 9.4(g)), or with width modulated armchair GNRs [71], thus enabling the creation
of intramolcular GRN devices (e.g., p–n diodes).
Both theoretical and experimental studies have conﬁrmed that the GNRs exhibit a
tunable transport gap that is inversely proportional to their width (Fig. 9.4(h)) [1, 22, 27,
28]. On the other hand, the carrier mobility decreases with reducing width (Fig. 9.4(i)).
In particular, the carrier mobility achieved in GNRs is considerably lower than that of
graphene, or even lower than that of silicon when the band gap is above 1.2 eV. The
decreasing mobility in GNRs has seriously limited their competitiveness with traditional
semiconductors. Nonetheless, with increasing band gap in narrow GNRs, transistors
with an on/off ratio exceeding 1000 can be readily achieved, rendering them suitable for
logic applications. Indeed, logic OR gates have been demonstrated by integrating
multiple top-gated GNR transistors with zirconium oxide nanowires as the high-k gate
insulator (Fig. 9.4(j)) [29].
9.3.2
Graphene Nanomesh Transistors
The formation of GNRs with lateral quantum conﬁnement can effectively open up a
sufﬁcient band gap for room temperature transistor operation. However, with a highly
conﬁned transverse dimension, the GNR devices often have limited driving current or
transconductance determined by the intrinsic properties of individual GNRs, which can
severely limit the ability to rationally design and fabricate devices to meet speciﬁc
circuit requirements. To ensure GNR devices have the desired characteristics that will
integrate them into useful circuits will require precise assembly of multiple GNRs into
densely organized arrays, which represents a considerable challenge. Additionally, the
high-yield fabrication of GNRs with controllable width, length and edge structure
remains a signiﬁcant challenge to date. Alternatively, a new graphene nanostructure,
graphene nanomesh (GNM), has been proposed for introducing lateral quantum con-
ﬁnement into a continuous layer of graphene to create a semiconducting thin ﬁlm
(Figs. 9.5(a) and (c)) [30–32].
GNMs consist of single or few-layer of graphene with a high density of in-plane
nanoholes (Figs. 9.5(a) and (c)). In order to achieve a sufﬁcient band gap, GNMs must
be fabricated with a sufﬁciently narrow neck width down to the sub-10 nm regime,
which is non-trivial using the lithography approach. On the other hand, a variety of
chemical templates, including block copolymer [30] and anodic aluminum oxide
(AAO) [33], can function as the natural etch mask for producing GNMs. For example,
GNMs with variable periodicities and neck widths down to 5 nm have been prepared
using block copolymer lithography. Using the GNMs as the semiconducting channel,
room temperature transistors have been demonstrated to deliver current nearly 100 times
greater than individual GNR devices, whilst with a comparable on/off ratio that is
tunable by varying the neck widths (Figs. 9.5(d) and (e)) [30]. It is important to note that
the requirement to achieve a similar on/off ratio in a large sheet of GNM is generally
much more stringent than in a narrow single GNR device, as each conducting channel

needs to be small enough to afford a large on/off ratio. The ability to achieve a high on/
off ratio and high current in the large GNM devices signiﬁes the relative uniformity of
the GNM ﬁlm. The approaches used to make the GNMs and GNM devices are generally
scalable, and can be applied over large areas to enable a continuous semiconducting
GNM thin ﬁlm, which can allow for rational design and fabrication of graphene-based
devices and circuits using standard semiconductor processing. Similar to GNRs, the
increase of the band gap in GNMs with reducing neck width coincides with the
decreasing carrier mobility due to signiﬁcantly increased edge scattering in the GNMs
with narrow constrictions (Fig. 9.5(f)). Nonetheless, a mobility >100 cm2/V s has been
achieved, far higher than that of typical thin ﬁlm semiconductors, making GNM an
attractive thin ﬁlm semiconductor material for large-area ﬂexible electronics.

ratio, a sufﬁcient gap can only be achieved at extremely narrow channel width (typically
<10 nm), which not only poses a serious technical challenge for conventional semicon-
ductor processing but also causes severe degradation of the carrier mobility due to the
edge scattering effect. To minimize the edge-states-induced carrier mobility degrad-
ation, an alternative approach is to use bilayer graphene.
Compared with the linear dispersion relationship of graphene, bilayer graphene
showed a parabolic band structure with non-zero effective mass Dirac fermions and
zero band gap. It has been theoretically suggested that a band gap can be opened in the
Bernal-stacking (AB-stacking) bilayer graphene by applying an external electric ﬁeld
normal to the graphene plane (Figs. 9.6(a) and (b)) [34], thus opening a new pathway
for introducing a band gap in graphene without creating extensive edge disorder in
graphene nanostructures. This theoretical prediction has been experimentally
veriﬁed by optical measurements (Fig. 9.6(c)) [35]. Electrical measurements have
also demonstrated the opening of a transport gap in the bilayer graphene with
vertical displacement ﬁeld. In particular, bilayer graphene transistors with an on/off
ratio up to 2000 have been achieved in bilayer graphene devices at low temperatures
(Fig. 9.6(d)) [38].
However, the high on/off ratio in such bilayer graphene devices is often achieved
only with very high voltage applied to both the top and bottom gates in a dual-gated
device, and the Dirac point for the maximum on/off ratio state is not controlled and
usually occurs at a high-bias point due to the fundamental requirement of a large vertical
displacement ﬁeld, making it difﬁcult to implement for low voltage logic applications.
To apply such a bilayer graphene device for low voltage complementary logic
electronics, the control of the Dirac point is an import problem to address. An alterna-
tive approach to produce an effective offset voltage without high gate voltage is to
introduce opposite chemical molecular doping to the top and bottom layer of the bilayer
graphene. Chemical doping like benzyl viologen molecules can modulate the displace-
ment ﬁeld to allow the opening of a transport gap, and increase the on/off ratio in the
bilayer graphene transistors [36]. Additionally, the Fermi energy level in the opened gap
can be rationally controlled by the amount of molecular doping required to obtain
bilayer graphene transistors with tunable Dirac points. Indeed, the threshold (Dirac
point) split has been demonstrated to achieve both n- and p-type bilayer graphene FETs
for the construction of complementary inverters (Figs. 9.6(e) and (f)) [36].
Taking a step further, a combination of lateral constriction of charge carriers in GNRs
and vertical inversion symmetry breaking in bilayer graphene can be used to further
modulate the band gap in bilayer GNRs. Bilayer GNR transistors have been realized
with maximum on/off around 3000 at room temperature upon applying a vertical
electric ﬁeld, which is generally higher than that of the bilayer graphene transistors
under the same applied electrical ﬁeld (Figs. 9.6(g)–(i)) [37].
Compared with graphene nanostructures, band-gap openings in bilayer graphene
require fewer fabrication processes and maintain the intrinsic graphene lattice, and thus
have a less impact on its carrier mobility. The electrical-ﬁeld tunable band-gap opening
in bilayer graphene makes it an interesting semiconductor with a tunable band gap,
which may open a pathway to tunable optoelectronics.

ﬁnite density of states (DOS), and weak electrostatic screening effect, graphene exhibits
a ﬁeld-tunable work-function and partial electrostatic transparency. It can thus function
as an “active” contact in graphene-semiconductor junctions to enable entirely new
possibilities for device engineering. Exploiting its “tunable work function” and partial
“electrostatic transparency”, graphene has been explored as a tunable contact for
creating unique types of vertical tunneling transistors [46], vertical ﬁeld-effect
transistors [47], or graphene barristors (GBs) [51]. For example, a vertical ﬁeld-effect
transistor (VFET) can be created in a graphene–MoS2–metal heterostructure, in which
the charges travel in the vertical direction from graphene to MoS2 and then to the metal
electrodes (Fig. 9.7(a)). A gate voltage modulates the graphene work-function and the
barrier height across the graphene–MoS2 junction (Fig. 9.7(b)). It can thus regulate the
amplitude of the current injected across the junction to switch the device on and off and
enable a transistor with a room temperature on/off ratio >103 (Fig. 9.7(c)) [48].
It should be noted that in the graphene–MoS2–metal vertical transistor design, the
unique part is graphene, which is an active tunable contact, and the MoS2 merely
functions as a thin ﬁlm semiconductor. This approach thus offers a general strategy
for the vertical integration of graphene with various semiconductors to obtain both p-
and n-channel transistors, or even with insulators to create vertical tunneling transistors.
For example, using the layered p-type Bi2Sr2Co2O8 (BSCO) nanosheet, a p-type VFET
has been demonstrated [48]. Integrating with silicon, graphene barristors have been
created on 6-inch silicon wafers with essentially the same working mechanism [51],
where graphene can be used as both the p-type and n-type Schottky contact to silicon,
resulting in complementary inverters and half-adder logic circuits (Fig. 9.7(d)). Inte-
grating graphene with thin ﬁlm oxide semiconductor has enabled the scalable fabrica-
tion of vertical thin ﬁlm transistors (VTFTs) and logic circuits (Fig. 9.7(e)) [49].
Integrating graphene with insulating thin ﬁlms (e.g., BN) has enabled the creation of
vertical tunneling transistors [46, 47]. More importantly, this strategy of vertical
integration can be readily extended to multiple-transistor stacking in the vertical direc-
tion, opening a new dimension for 3D integration at the device level. For example, by
vertically stacking two graphene-based vertical transistors, with a Bi2Sr2Co2O8 layer as
the p-channel and a MoS2 layer as the n-channel material (Fig. 9.7(f)), a complementary
inverter has been demonstrated with a larger-than-unity voltage gain (Fig. 9.7(g)). In
this way, the concept of vertical transistors can open up a totally new strategy for logic
integration in the third dimension, distinct from the two-dimensional integration in
traditional planar silicon electronics.
The design of vertical transistors is fundamentally different from the traditional
“planar transistor” structure that has been used in conventional silicon electronics for
more than half a century, and exhibits two important features that make it highly
attractive for large-area ﬂexible electronics. In a planar transistor, the charge carriers
travel in the planar (lateral) direction from source to drain electrode, with the speed
largely deﬁned by the time required for electrons to travel from the source to drain
electrode, which in turn is determined by the carrier speed of the semiconductor
materials (determined by the intrinsic carrier mobility and applied ﬁeld, or carrier
saturation velocity) and the distance between the source and drain electrodes

(determined by the lithographically deﬁned gate length). With the same device archi-
tecture, the speed of the planar transistors is inevitably limited by the lateral size or the
ultimate resolution of the lithography used to fabricate the devices. The current large-
area electronics and thin ﬁlm transistors are typically dominated by low performance
materials with relatively large device dimensions, and thus typically exhibit a rather low
speed. Importantly, with the vertical transistor concept, the channel length is no longer
determined by the lithography, but by the thickness of the semiconductor thin ﬁlm. It
can therefore enable ultra-short channel transistors beyond the limitation of traditional
lithographic resolution, opening a new pathway to high-speed devices (even using low-
resolution lithography). This attribute of vertical transistors can be highly signiﬁcant for
low-cost, large-area ﬂexible electronics, where a moderate device operating speed is
required but the high-resolution lithography is too costly or too difﬁcult to implement.
For example, using a simple shadow mask approach without sophisticated lithography,
a graphene–poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) heterostructure vertical device with a size
over 10,000 μm2 has been produced with megahertz frequency response, comparable to
the highest speed P3HT transistors fabricated using the high-resolution lithography
(Figs. 9.7(h) and (i)) [50].
Additionally, for ﬂexible electronic applications, the repeated bending cycles can
induce planar cracks that may block the current transport in traditional planar TFTs
(Fig. 9.7(j)). Importantly, the unique vertical (out-of-plane) charge transport across the
large-area vertical junction makes the source–drain current much less affected by the
in-plane cracks in the semiconductor thin ﬁlms to afford unprecedented tolerance
to in-plane cracks (Fig. 9.7(j)) [49]. It can thus enable exciting opportunities for highly
ﬂexible electronics with exceptional electrical performance and superior mechanical
robustness. Indeed, the repeated bending cycle test of VTFTs made on a plastic
substrate conﬁrms the highly robust nature of the VTFTs (Fig. 9.7(k)). A bending test
shows that the current drops by about ﬁve orders of magnitude from their initial state
within 50 bending cycles for the planar TFTs due to the formation of small cracks or
dislocations inside the channel under repeated bending cycles, while the VTFTs show
highly stable operation current with little change up to 1000 bending cycles. These
studies clearly demonstrated the overall robustness of VTFTs against repeated bending
cycles, which can open up exciting opportunities in large-area, ﬂexible, high-
performance macroelectronics.

Conclusion
Graphene, as an extraordinary member of a large family of layered materials, displays
rich physical properties and represents an exciting material system for exploring
the fundamental physics and for developing exciting technologies. With the unique
two-dimensional geometry, ultra-high mobility, high carrier saturation speed, linear
dispersion relationship, and exceptional mechanical properties, graphene has attracted
considerable interest as an alternative material for a new generation atomically thin
electronics with unique functions or unprecedented performance. With the potential for

terahertz RF circuits, current graphene RF transistors already show comparable per-
formance with the best devices made from traditional materials. Though the zero band
gap of graphene limits its potential for logic applications, the band-gap opening in
nanostructures or bilayer graphene may greatly expand the application horizon towards
digital circuits. By integrating with other two-dimensional materials or semiconductor
thin ﬁlms and exploiting graphene as a unqiue tunable contact, vertical graphene
transistors show much improved properties (on/off ratio) for logic electronics.
Despite the signiﬁcant potential demonstrated to date, there are also substantial
challenges to bringing these potentials into practical technologies. To overcome the
limitations of the semimetal nature of graphene, recent interest is expanding to other
2D materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with tunable intrinsic
band gaps. In particular, exploiting atomically thin MoS2 as the active semiconductor
channel, RF transistors with an intrinsic cutoff frequency >40 GHz, and maximum
power gain frequency up to 50 GHz have been demonstrated [79]. However, further
improvement of the RF performance in such devices is limited by the intrinsically lower
carrier mobility (~100 cm2/V s) and the challenge in creating low resistance contacts. To
this end, black phosphorous has recently attracted considerable interest because of its
moderate intrinsic band gap and considerably higher carrier mobility (~1000 cm2/V s)
than TMDs [80]. Additionally, the creation of van der Waals heterojunctions by
combining several different 2D materials could allow atomic scale integration of high
disparate materials and high distinct properties. It could enable totally new device
concepts, and open up exciting technological opportunities beyond the reach of existing
materials.

10.1
Introduction
The unique optical properties of graphene coupled with its outstanding electrical
properties make it an ideal system for optoelectronic and photonic applications.
Graphene’s absorption spectrum extends from the ultra-violet to the far-infrared and
terahertz regions. In the near infrared and visible part of the spectrum, the absorption
is the result of interband excitations at the K and K0-points of the π-band structure of
graphene, where the dispersion is essentially linear. In pristine graphene and T ¼ 0,
the optical conductivity σ ω
ð Þ in this region is quantized, independent of the exact
frequency, and given by σ ω
ð Þ ¼ πe2=2h, where e and h denote the electron charge and
Planck’s constant, respectively [1–3]. This conductivity corresponds to an absorbance
for normal incidence of A ω
ð Þ ¼ 4=πc
ð
Þσ ω
ð Þ ¼ πα  2:3%, where α is the ﬁne struc-
ture constant and c is the speed of light. At higher frequencies, trigonal warping and
many-body effects affect the interband transitions. Near the M-point of the band
structure, a saddle-point singularity gives an absorption maximum at about 4.3 eV [4].
Absorption at the Γ-point occurs at very high energies (e20 eV).
Doped graphene absorbs in the far-infrared region as a result of intraband transitions
involving free carriers. These transitions are momentum forbidden but become possible
due to scattering by phonons and defects. The absorption in this region is not quantized
but is determined by the free-carrier density. Its oscillator strength is given by the Drude
weight D, which for graphene is D ¼ e2vF
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
πη
p
, where η is the carrier density and vF the
Fermi velocity. The sum rule dictates that an increase in the Drude weight of the
intraband transitions should lead to a corresponding decrease in the strength of the
interband transitions; providing an important tool for modulating the optical absorption
of graphene [5].
Along with the above single-particle excitations, collective excitations (plasmons) are
possible in graphene. Due to the mismatch in the light and plasmon dispersions, direct
excitation of plasmons in extended graphene is not possible. However, there are a
number of approaches by which momentum conservation can be achieved and light
can couple to plasmons [6]. The intrinsic plasmon of the π-electrons of monolayer
graphene is centered at e5 eV while the σ þ π plasmons at e10 eV [7]. More relevant
for device applications are the intraband plasmons arising from collective free-carrier
excitations in doped graphene. In monolayer graphene, the frequencies of these
180

www.ebook3000.com

excitations scale with free-carrier density η as ωpl / η1=4 / EF
j
j1=2, with EF being the
Fermi energy [8, 9].
In addition to the extended plasmons, localized plasmons in structures smaller
than the relevant wavelength, as in metallic particles, can be directly excited. Such
structures may involve graphene nanoribbons, nanodots, or have other shapes. The
localized plasmon resonance frequency depends not only on η, but also on particle
size and shape. For example, light polarized perpendicular to the axis of nanoribbons
can excite localized plasmons with frequencies that scale with the ribbon width W as
W1=2 [10]. Typically micron size graphene conﬁned structures have plasmon
resonances in the far-infrared region, while nanostructures have them in the near-
infrared region.
Graphene in general does not exhibit photoluminescence. This is due to the absence
of a band gap and the ultra-fast relaxation and cooling of the photoexcited carriers. Hot
band luminescence at a given frequency is observed in doped graphene when 2 EF
j
j
approaches the emission energy and disappears when 2 EF
j
j surpasses the excitation
energy [11].
The value of graphene as a photonic material is due to its wide range of absorption
and the ways this absorption can be controlled. Furthermore, the large carrier mobilities
in graphene further enhance its potential in optoelectronics. Key to the control of the
optical properties is the ability to change the carrier density by electrostatic or chemical
doping. In this way, the charge density can be varied from about 1011 to 1014 cm–2. The
tunable doping leads to Pauli blocking of interband excitations in the near infrared,
allowing for light switching [12, 13]. In the case of localized plasmons, it determines the
plasmonic resonance frequency. The plasma frequency can also be controlled by
conﬁnement, while the absorption strength can be enhanced by the excitation of
intrinsic plasmons or the plasmons of other attached materials. Furthermore, the prop-
erties of other optical materials such as photonic crystals can be modiﬁed by combing
with graphene layers [14–16].
10.2
Light to Current Conversion
Most photonic applications of graphene involve light to current conversion. This can
be accomplished through different physical mechanisms, illustrated in Fig. 10.1(a)
[17]. The simplest perhaps is through the photoelectric (PE) effect, where the
electron–hole (e–h) pairs produced by photoexcitation are separated and accelerated
by the internal electric ﬁeld present at doping (e.g. p–n) or metal–graphene junctions.
The junctions are created either electrostatically by using split gates, or chemically by
doping, or by using contact metals with work functions that are higher/lower than that
of graphene.
Another current generation mechanism involves the photothermoelectric (PTE)
effect. A photovoltage VPTE is generated at a doping junction 1–2 that is given by
VPTE ¼ S1  S2
ð
ÞΔT, where S1 and S2 are the Seebeck coefﬁcients of the two sides of
181

the junction and ΔT is the temperature difference. In general, a photovoltage is
generated when irradiation generates a temperature gradient rT x
ð Þ in a material with
a spatially varying Seebeck coefﬁcient, then VPTE ¼
Ð
S x
ð Þ  rT x
ð Þdx. The Seebeck
coefﬁcient of graphene can be obtained from the Mott formula by differentiating the
DC conductance with respect to the Fermi level. The coefﬁcient can be tuned by

of photocurrent in a graphene junction. In this example, it is assumed that the doping in region 2
is ﬁxed (position 3) and the doping in region 1 is controlled by the gate voltage (positions 1–4).
The photocurrent changes sign twice (positions 2 and 3).

varying the chemical potential and can reach values of e100 μV=K [18]. A typical gate
voltage dependence is shown in Fig. 10.1(c). Due to the slow scattering of excited
carriers in graphene by acoustic phonons, a substantial number of hot carriers survives
and contributes to the photoresponse. Figure 10.1(b) shows an example of a graphene
p–n junction that is locally illuminated with a laser beam. The dominance of the PE or
PTE effect in the photocurrent generation in a graphene junction can be ascertained by
examining the sign change in the current as the doping in the two regions changes [19–
21]. In case of the PE effect, the sign changes once – namely, when the two regions
have the same chemical potential. Instead, if the PTE effect dominates, the sign changes
twice – one sign change occurs when the chemical potentials in both regions are the
same, the other arises from the non-monotonic dependence of the Seebeck coefﬁcient
on the chemical potential (see Fig. 10.1(c)).
Irradiation-induced heating can also change the photocurrent by changing the trans-
port characteristics of graphene, i.e. the mobility of the carriers or by thermally exciting
additional carriers. This effect is referred to as bolometric (BE). A temperature increase
in graphene reduces carrier mobility leading to a current reduction, while additional
carriers increase the current. The relative importance of the two factors is largely
determined by the Fermi energy. Near the Dirac point, the number of carriers is low
and additional carriers have a signiﬁcant effect, while at high doping the reduction in
mobility dominates.
Detection of terahertz (THz) radiation by graphene can also be achieved based on a
mechanism proposed by Dyakonov and Shur [22, 23]. In this mechanism, a two-
dimensional electron system in a ﬁeld-effect transistor (FET) structure acts as a resonant
cavity for plasma waves. When an AC voltage is applied between source and drain and
the channel is irradiated with THz radiation, a DC component appears in the potential
difference between source and drain. This rectiﬁcation is due to the non-linear response
of the cavity. The detection characteristics depend on whether the device operates in the
resonant mode (plasmon transit time shorter than the momentum relaxation time) with
very high-peak responsivity at the resonance frequency (up to 106 V/W predicted), or in
the non-resonant mode. Resonant operation requires mobilities of at least several
thousand cm2/V s at frequencies >1 THz. In the non-resonant (overdamped) regime,
the plasma waves decay at a distance smaller than the channel length, and broadband
THz detection is expected.
Graphene can also be utilized in a FET conﬁguration as a sensitive photogate. In
this case, light may be absorbed by the graphene, e–h pairs are created, and then one
of the carriers is transferred to another material in contact with it, e.g. a quantum dot, a
thin insulator with traps, or adsorbed atoms or molecules. The reverse process where
the primary e–h pair generation takes place on the second material is also possible.
The charge separation is the critical step. The resulting strong ﬁeld leads to photo-
gating that drastically increases the number of carriers drawn in the FET channel
and therefore the current in the FET. The photoconductive gain G is given by
G ¼ τtrap=τtransit, where τtrap is the trapping lifetime and τtransit is the transit time from
source to drain. While longer τtrap gives higher gain, the photoresponse time also
becomes slower.

10.3
Photodetectors
Photodetectors convert light into electrical signals and are at the heart of a multitude of
technologies, such as optical communications, video and biomedical imaging, and
many more. For photodetection applications, graphene offers two main advantages.
(i) Graphene exhibits ultra-fast carrier dynamics, which enables picosecond conversion
of photons into electrical signals, and could be applied in high-data rate optical
communication networks. (ii) Being gapless, graphene absorbs light over a wide range
of electromagnetic frequencies, which makes it an appealing material for photodetection
applications in spectral regimes that are currently not well covered by other materials
(e.g. terahertz and mid-infrared).
10.3.1
Metal–Graphene–Metal Photodetectors
Photocurrents of opposite polarities are generated by local illumination of the drain and
source contacts in a graphene FET, operated under short-circuit conditions. In early
studies, this current was attributed to the e–h separation at the built-in electric ﬁelds at
the drain and source contacts [24–26]. The ﬁelds arise from the charge transfer between
the contact metal and the graphene due to their work-function differences. It can be
adjusted by proper choice of the metal and can be further enhanced by electrostatic
doping. The photoresponse near graphene p–n junctions and single/bilayer graphene
interfaces were shown to be dominated by the PTE effect [19–21]. Recent wavelength-
dependent measurements of the photoresponse near graphene–metal junctions were
used to quantify the relative contributions of PTE and PE effects, both adding to the
overall photoresponse, with the PTE effect being more important [27, 28]. As the
photocurrent in a graphene transistor is generated only in the vicinity of the contacts,
an interdigitated metal ﬁnger conﬁguration was used to increase the effective photo-
detection area (Fig. 10.2(a)). Breaking the mirror symmetry of the device by applying a
drain-source voltage, as is done in traditional metal-semiconductor-metal detectors, is
not practical, because graphene’s low resistance would result in a large dark current. An
asymmetric metallization scheme was thus employed to break the symmetry under
short-circuit conditions [29]. This enabled near zero-dark current operation and respon-
sivities (the responsivity relates the electric current produced by a photodetector to the
incident optical power) of up to 6 mA/W. Several approaches have been pursued to
enhance the interaction between light and monolayer graphene and to increase the
responsivity. One approach is based on the integration of graphene into an optical
cavity. Incident light is trapped inside the cavity and passes multiple times through the
graphene sheet, giving rise to enhanced absorption. Cavity-integrated graphene
photodetectors were realized using distributed Bragg reﬂectors [30], metallic mirrors
[31], and photonic crystals [32]. Another approach involves the use of the ﬁeld
enhancement resulting from the excitation of plasmons, either by placing metallic
nanostructures near the contacts [33] or by exploiting collective charge oscillations of
the electron gas inside the graphene itself. Graphene nanoribbon arrays with different
widths were demonstrated as tunable mid-infrared photodetectors [34].

10.3.2
Waveguide-Integrated Photodetectors
Figure 10.2(b) shows the coplanar integration of graphene with an optical waveguide
for photonic integrated circuits [35]. The optical mode in the silicon waveguide couples
through its evanescent tail to the graphene on top. The photocurrent is generated at the
interface between the signal-electrode and graphene and is driven towards the ground
leads. In order to avoid losses due to light absorption in the signal-electrode, other
studies employed a pair of electrodes located on each side of the waveguide [36, 37].
One of the electrodes was positioned sufﬁciently close to the waveguide edge to
efﬁciently separate the photoexcited electron–hole pairs at the junction, and the ground
electrode was placed at larger distance to break the device symmetry. An almost ﬂat
photoresponse across all optical telecommunication windows, from the O-band to the
U-band, was demonstrated, which is well beyond the wavelength range of germanium
detectors. A bandwidth of 42 GHz and responsivities of 0.36 A/W and 0.08 A/W under
bias and zero-bias operation, respectively, were reported [37].
10.3.3
Sensitized Graphene Photodetectors
Sensitive photon detection requires a gain mechanism that can provide multiple electrical
carriers per incident photon. One way to accomplish gain in a graphene transistor is by
sensitizing its surface with light absorbing particles, such as quantum dots, molecules, or
metallic nanoparticles (Fig. 10.2(c)). Photons are absorbed in these particles, followed
by charge (either electron or hole) transfer into the conducting graphene channel. As a
result, the carrier density in graphene changes by Δn and therefore its conductance by
ΔG ¼ eμ Δn. As the carrier mobility μ is large in graphene, it is a natural candidate for
highly sensitive photodetection. Moreover, since graphene is a two-dimensional material,
the charge transfer can be very efﬁcient. The photoconductive gain results from recircula-
tion of free carriers in graphene during the lifetime of the trapped carriers in the particles. A
gain of up to 108 was observed for graphene decorated with PbS quantum dots, correspond-
ing to an ultra-high responsivity of 107 A/W [38]. However, the trade-off between respon-
sivity and speed, which is associated with the trapping time (typically milliseconds), makes
these devices only suitable for applications that do not require a fast response.
10.3.4
Bolometers
A bolometer measures the power of electromagnetic radiation by absorbing the incident
radiation, ΔP, and reading out the resulting temperature increase, ΔT. The thermal
resistance Rh ¼ ΔT=ΔP deﬁnes the sensitivity of a bolometer, and the heat capacity
determines its response time. Graphene has a high thermal resistance and a low heat
capacity, which makes it an ideal material for a low temperature bolometer. The weak
temperature dependence of the electrical resistance in monolayer graphene, however,
imposes a challenge for electrical read-out of the temperature increase ΔT. Yan et al.
thus used a dual-gated bilayer graphene sheet with an optically transparent top-gate

electrode to open a band gap and obtain temperature-dependent resistance (Fig. 10.2(d))
[39]. This device was characterized under mid-infrared illumination (10.6 μm wave-
length). The thermal resistance showed approximately the T3 temperature dependence
expected for (disorder-free) phonon cooling and the photoresponse mechanism was
identiﬁed to be bolometric. The detector exhibits a noise-equivalent-power of
33 fW/Hz0.5 at 5 K (lower than that of commercial silicon bolometers) and an intrinsic
bandwidth of >1 GHz (orders of magnitude higher than in silicon). A challenge that
remains is the matching of the high impedance of a gapped graphene bilayer to that of
free space for more efﬁcient photon coupling.
10.3.5
Terahertz Detectors
Commercial THz detectors are mostly based on thermal sensing elements or fast
Schottky diodes. However, both technologies have limitations in terms of performance.
Thermal detectors exhibit a slow response and Schottky diodes are limited to low THz
frequencies. Newer generations of THz detectors can overcome these limitations by
relying on the Dyakonov–Shur mechanism, i.e. the excitation of plasma waves in a
high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) channel by the incoming THz radiation
[22, 23]. Graphene supports plasma waves that are weakly damped, making it a
promising candidate for such devices. Room temperature detection of 0.3 THz radiation
was demonstrated in a top-gated graphene FET, in which a log-periodic circular-toothed
antenna at the source and gate electrodes was used to couple the radiation (Fig. 10.2(e))
[40]. The dependence of the photovoltage on doping was found to be in agreement with
the predictions of a diffusive theoretical model, thereby proving that the detector
operates in the overdamped plasma wave regime. In an improved buried-gate device,
responsivity of e1:2 V=W and noise equivalent power of e2  109 W=Hz0:5 were
achieved, competitive with the performance of commercially available systems [41].
Resonant detection is still to be demonstrated. An ultra-fast THz detector based on the
PTE effect with an array of asymmetric metal contacts has also been demonstrated [42].
10.4
Light Modulators
Optical modulators allow for the electrical control of the amplitude, frequency, phase, or
polarization of light. Electro-absorption modulators based on bulk semiconductors or
semiconductor quantum wells exploit the Franz–Keldysh or quantum-conﬁned Stark
effects to shift the material’s optical absorption edge by an electric ﬁeld. The optical
absorption in graphene can be controlled by shifting the chemical potential with a gate
voltage VG. At VG ¼ 0, the Fermi level EF resides close to the Dirac point and
interband transitions can occur, giving rise to light absorption (Fig. 10.3(a), middle
image). At large negative VG, the Fermi level is lowered and the graphene becomes
transparent as no electrons are available for interband transitions (Fig. 10.3(a), left). At
large positive VG, the Fermi level is raised which prevents interband transitions due to
Pauli blocking (Fig. 10.3(a), right). Optical interband transitions can thus be turned on

and off, provided that the photon energy hv is smaller than 2 EF
j
j. Modulation by
monolayer graphene is only about 2.3% at normal incidence, but integration with an
optical waveguide (Fig. 10.3(c)) greatly increases the interaction length through
coupling between the evanescent light wave and graphene, resulting in strong electro-
absorption modulation of e0:1 dB=μm (Fig. 10.3(d)). In the ﬁrst graphene-based modu-
lator, demonstrated by Liu et al., the waveguide itself was utilized as a back-gate
electrode to dope the graphene sheet [13]. A 4 dB modulation depth was achieved in
a 40 μm long device. The modulator showed a broad spectral bandwidth (1.35–1.6 μm),

small device footprint (25 μm2), and high operation speed (1.2 GHz). An improved
design, demonstrated later by the same group, used a graphene–oxide–graphene struc-
ture [43]. Under bias, both electrons and holes are injected into the graphene layers to
form a p–oxide–n junction (Fig. 10.3(b)) and both layers become transparent simultan-
eously. Without bias, both graphene sheets become absorbing. This design avoids the
participation of electrons/holes in the (usually highly resistive) silicon waveguide, and
therefore increases its operation speed. In addition, using two graphene sheets increases
the optical absorption and modulation depth, resulting in smaller device footprint and
lower power consumption.
Graphene modulators face fundamental tradeoffs between operation speed and efﬁ-
ciency. The speed can be increased using a thicker gate oxide, but the lower capacitance
then results in reduced efﬁciency because of a lower carrier concentration change with
voltage. To overcome this tradeoff, Phare et al. integrated a graphene double-layer over
a ring resonator that is coupled to a bus waveguide [44]. The resonator was designed to
be critically coupled for low losses. When losses in graphene are increased, the
resonator becomes undercoupled, increasing transmission through the bus waveguide.
This device operated with a 30 GHz bandwidth and with state-of-the-art modulation
efﬁciency of 15 dB per 10 V.
In addition to interband transitions, which dominate in the infrared and visible range,
intraband optical transitions can occur in graphene, resulting in an optical conductivity
described by the Drude model. The latter dominate the optical properties of graphene at
terahertz frequencies. By electrically tuning the density of carriers available for intra-
band transitions, the transmission of terahertz radiation through graphene can be
controlled (Fig. 10.3(e), right). On the basis of this principle, Sensale-Rodriguez et al.
demonstrated a graphene-based terahertz modulator [45]. The device, depicted in
Fig. 10.3(e), consists of large-area monolayer graphene that is electrostatically gated
by a SiO2/Si back-gate. An intensity modulation depth of 15%, an intrinsic insertion
loss of 5%, and a modulation frequency of 20 kHz were demonstrated at 0.57 THz.
10.5
Ultra-Fast Lasers
Ultra-fast lasers produce nano-, pico-, or femtosecond optical pulses and are deployed in
a variety of applications, ranging from optical spectroscopy to materials processing and
medical surgery. To produce a train of ultra-short optical pulses, most laser designs
exploit a technique called passive mode-locking, in which a non-linear optical element
causes self-modulation of the intracavity light intensity. A commonly used non-linear
optical device is a saturable absorber, in which the absorption of light decreases with
increasing intensity. Saturable absorbers for ultra-fast lasers are either based on semi-
conductor saturable absorber mirrors, called SESAMs, or various kinds of artiﬁcial
saturable absorbers that exploit non-linear optical effects (e.g. Kerr-lensing).
In general, saturable absorption results from depletion of the ground-state population
and most materials show some degree of saturable absorption if the incident light
intensity is high enough. However, the key requirements for using an optical absorber

in mode-locked laser – ultra-fast response time and low saturation ﬂuence – can only be
met by a few materials. In addition, low optical insertion loss, broad spectral response,
and high power handling capabilities are desirable. The ultra-fast carrier relaxation in
graphene, combined with strong optical absorption, makes it an ideal material for fast
saturable absorption. Further, due to graphene’s broadband optical response, there is no
need for band-gap engineering as in SESAMs. Figure 10.4(b) shows the optical
transmission of graphene (more precisely, a graphene–polymer composite) as a function
of pump power at different wavelengths. The transmission is almost independent of
pump intensity for low input powers and increases by 1.3% due to absorption saturation
when the incident power is raised. The wavelength independent behavior demonstrates
that graphene can be used for saturable absorption over a broad spectral range. The
origin of the saturation can be understood by considering the photoexcited carrier
dynamics in graphene (Fig. 10.3(a)). Optical interband excitation by an ultra-short
optical pulse produces non-equilibrium carrier distributions in the conduction and
valence bands. The excitation is followed by an equilibration process [46]. After
photogeneration, the electrons and holes thermalize among themselves on a time scale

of tens of femtoseconds via carrier–carrier scattering, leading to a hot electron–hole
plasma with elevated electron and hole temperatures. As the carrier–carrier collisions
preserve the total electronic energy, the carrier temperature scales with pump power and
can reach thousands of kelvins. Pauli blocking of interband optical transitions gives rise
to the saturation behavior. Subsequently, a phonon-mediated cooling process sets in and
the system returns to equilibrium on a picosecond time scale.
An example of an ultra-fast laser that comprises a graphene saturable absorber is
shown in Fig. 10.3(c). This speciﬁc device is entirely ﬁber-based and uses a ring cavity
design [47]. An erbium-doped ﬁber, pumped by a diode laser, is used as the gain
medium. The optical isolator and polarization controller maintain unidirectional pulse
propagation for optimized mode-locking. The mode-locker itself consists of a
graphene–polymer composite, sandwiched between two ﬁber connectors. Other works
have utilized mechanically exfoliated ﬂakes, CVD-grown ﬁlms, functionalized gra-
phene, or reduced graphene oxide ﬂakes instead. The laser produces 464-fs-long pulses
at a 1.55 μm wavelength and with a 20 MHz repetition rate. A more recent, optimized,
design has allowed the generation of pulses as short as 29 fs [48]. Graphene saturable
absorbers have also enabled mode-locking of free-space solid-state lasers [49] and
semiconductor lasers [50].
10.6
Thermal Radiation Sources
Light sources in the far-infrared and THz regions of the spectrum are scarce. This is
largely due to free electron or phonon absorption in the materials used in optics. This,
for example, limits the operation of quantum cascade lasers in the region of phonon
absorption of III–IV materials. As a result, this important spectral regime is often
referred to as an “optical desert” [51]. Thermal radiation could be used in this frequency
regime but, unlike laser radiation which is monochromatic, coherent, and directional,
thermal radiation is generally considered to be broad, incoherent, and determined solely
by the material properties. However, not all of this is necessarily true [52–54]. One way
of achieving coherence and directionality in thermal radiation involves the thermal
excitation of coherent propagating modes, plasmons in free electron systems, or phonon
polaritons in polar dielectrics. If the material is appropriately patterned into a grating,
momentum conservation can be achieved and these evanescent modes can become
radiative [55]. Similar results can be obtained by coupling to other types of antennae
systems [56].
Graphene with its continuum of quantum states, controllable carrier concentration,
and high thermal stability seems to be an ideal thermal radiation source. Spatially
resolved thermal radiation from electrical heated graphene on SiO2 in a FET conﬁgur-
ation was studied by Freitag et al. [57] and Berciaud et al. [58]. The temperature was
measured using the Stokes/anti-Stokes ratio and the shift of the G0 band in Raman
measurements. They found that the location of the maximum temperature along the
length of the graphene channel and the position of the Dirac point could be controlled
by the gate voltage. The infrared radiation in general follows Planck’s law, but local hot
191
10.6 Thermal Radiation Sources

spots were also observed. By suspending the graphene so as to reduce heat dissipation,
graphene could be electrically heated to even higher temperatures (e2800 K) leading to
bright visible light emission [59]. Emission from electrically heated graphene incorpor-
ated inside a planar metal microcavity was ﬁrst reported by Engel et al. [31]. The cavity
was fabricated with a resonance in the near infrared. Unlike free-space thermal radi-
ation, thermal radiation from the cavity had a 140 times narrower spectral distribution,
and was concentrated in a 240 angular lobe (FWHM).
An effort to enhance thermal emission and make it directional and tunable was
reported by Brar et al. [60]. They studied thermal emission from a graphene nanoribbon
array on SiNx. Along with the broad thermal emission, two narrow band emissions at
1360 cm–1 and 730 cm–1 were observed. The 1360 cm–1 emission was found to be
polarized perpendicular to the ribbon axis and be tunable by changing the gate voltage.
The 730 cm–1 band was largely unchanged by gate bias. It was concluded that the
high-energy band is due to emission from the conﬁned plasmon of the ribbons, while
the low-energy emission is due to emission from the phonon of the underlying SiNx.
The authors estimated that the device can modulate a 2 μW of power over a 100 cm–1
bandwidth, which is comparable or better than commercial LEDs over similar band-
widths. The spectral observations in the above study can be understood on the basis of
Kirchhoff’s law connecting thermal absorption and emission [61] and the fact that the
nanoribbons allow plasmon excitation with perpendicularly polarized light [62], and
that these plasmons can couple effectively with the underlying substrate phonons [60]
Brar et al. also point out that spontaneous thermal emission is subject to the Purcell
effect and therefore can be modulated in plasmonic cavities. Thermal emission from
graphene at even longer wavelengths (few THz range) from a FET was reported by
J. Tong et al. [63]. The emission was found to be optimized at a particular gate voltage
suggesting a charge-density dependence of the THz generation mechanism. From the
above, we can conclude that graphene in the form of gratings, or coupled to various
antennae, or in metamaterial structures could potentially produce directional, thermal
emitters that operate throughout the infrared frequency range.
10.7
Passive Optical Elements
Graphene is becoming the basis of a number of passive optical elements such as ﬁlters
and polarizers, which are scarce particularly in the THz region. It is relatively simple to
form notch ﬁlters by patterning graphene into nanostructures which exhibit localized
plasmon resonances. Using nanoribbon structures and utilizing the fact that only light
polarized perpendicular to the ribbons can excite the plasmons, polarizers can be
produced (Fig. 10.5(a)) [62]. The frequency and attenuation of such devices can be
tuned by doping, changing the conﬁnement, or the stacking of multiple graphene layers
[64]. The limited absorption of graphene, however, limits practical applications. For this
reason, graphene is usually coupled with waveguides, optical ﬁbers or as metamaterials
structures. For example, Bao et al. [65] demonstrated a TE optical ﬁber graphene
polarizer with an up to 27 dB extinction ratio at 1.55 μm (Fig. 10.5(b)), while
192

Kim et al. [66] produced a polymer waveguide which changes its polarization from TE
(e10 dB) to TM (e19 dB) by adding a dielectric cladding on the graphene. A graphene
metamaterial, tunable THz ﬁlter, which is based on the shift of the resonance frequency,
was proposed by Yang et al. [67].
10.8
Transparent Conductive Electrodes
A very active area of graphene research involves its use in transparent and conductive
electrodes. Such electrodes are employed in touch screens [68], organic light-emitting
diodes (OLED) [69, 70], and organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells [71, 72]. Currently the
dominant technology is based on indium tin oxide (ITO), which has a low sheet
resistance of 10–25 Ω/sq, 90% transmittance, and can be deposited conformally by
sputtering. However, ITO is expensive and has poor mechanical properties when bent or
stretched. Other conductive polymer systems used for the same purpose, such as
PEDOT:PSS ﬁlms, have good optical properties, but poor environmental stability.
Graphene, on the other hand, has excellent optical transparency (e97%), high carrier
mobility, is inert and stable, and has a high Young’s modulus [73]. Furthermore, in
principle, it can be produced cheaply by catalytic CVD processes, and large-area
deposition can be achieved using roll-to-roll technology [68]. In practical devices,
several graphene layers need to be stacked to reduce the sheet resistance, which, for
Fig. 10.5 (a) Graphene nanoribbon polarizer (ribbon widths: 50–130 nm) (reproduced with

Cu CVD graphene, is typically about 300 Ω/sq and also for structural stability. At four
layers, this resistance is already reduced to about 50 Ω/sq. However, as the number
of graphene layers increases the optical transmittance decreases by roughly 3%
(at 550 nm). Further reduction in sheet resistance can be induced by doping using
chemical dopants such as HNO3 or AuCl3 or electrostatic doping using, for example,
poled ferroelectric ﬂuoropolymers [74].
A number of different devices utilizing graphene electrodes have been successfully
demonstrated. These include both resistive and capacitive touch screens. The former
require 90% transmittance at 550 nm and a sheet resistance up to 550 Ω/sq [68], while
the latter must have a lower resistance up to 100 Ω/sq. Graphene OLEDs have been
demonstrated for both display applications and lighting. In a recent study, green gra-
phene OLEDs with an enhanced out-coupling and the addition of a hole transporting
layer were demonstrated and had external quantum efﬁciency >60%. Phosphorescent
white organic light-emitting diodes with an external quantum efﬁciency >45% at 10,000
cd/m2 with color rendering index of 85 were also demonstrated [75]. In OPVs, graphene
is used as a counter electrode and a low resistance and high work function are required
[76–78]. Current research in the graphene conductive electrode area is focusing on
increasing the sheet conductivity of graphene, developing doping schemes that provide
better environmental stability [79, 80], and efforts to decrease contact resistances [81]. In
terms of processing the graphene ﬁlms, improvements in the roll-to-roll process are
required and also ways of transferring CVD graphene on non-ﬂat structured surfaces.

11.1
Introduction to Spintronics
Charge and spin are two fundamental properties of the electron which are currently
exploited in advanced technologies, but to date they have been used separately in
information processing and data storage, respectively. Charge currents drive the
operation of elementary electronic devices and logic circuits that encode and process
binary or analogue information. Meanwhile, the spin degree of freedom is used in its
collective form of magnetic domains for switching magneto resistance signals and
realizing long-term data storage, from ferrite core memories to modern hard disk
drives [1].
The ﬁeld of spintronics aims to combine the charge and spin of electrons to create
novel functionalities [2]. In the simplest spintronic device, called a spin valve, an
electronic current ﬂows between two ferromagnetic electrodes through a non-magnetic
channel. A spin signal is carried along with the charge current and is normally detected
through its magneto resistance [3], which is inﬂuenced by the magnetic ordering of the
electrodes. The requirement for non-magnetic channels is to transport spin currents with
minimum spin information loss due to spin-scattering events, which in most cases are
caused by spin–orbit coupling.
The ﬁeld of spintronics emerged from scientiﬁc discoveries in the 1980s, which
concerned spin-dependent electron transport phenomena in solid-state devices.
Following the observation in 1985 by Johnson and Silsbee [4] of spin-polarized
electron injection from a ferromagnetic metal to a normal metal, the foundational step
of the ﬁeld of spintronics was the discovery, by Albert Fert et al. [5] and Peter
Grünberg et al. [6], of giant magneto resistance in thin ﬁlm structures composed of
alternating ferromagnetic and non-magnetic conductive layers. Control of magneto
resistance has required the use of various magnetic and non-magnetic metallic and
semiconducting materials, and has resulted in a massive technological impact on
magnetic ﬁeld sensors, which today are used in hard disk drives, biosensors, micro-
electromechanical systems (MEMS), and magneto resistive random-access memory
(MRAM) [7]. Following the discovery of the spin transfer torque effect, which
permits the control of the magnetization with an electrical current, a second revolution
in spintronics is currently underway [8].
As will be discussed in this chapter, graphene spintronics has been envisioned as
highly promising, owing to its unique electronic band structure of so-called massless

Dirac fermions, which are robust to backscattering and allow charge to travel at room
temperature at an unprecedented speed (1/300 of the speed of light c) over long
distances (tens of microns). Additionally, the weak spin–orbit coupling (SOC) in sp2
carbon also suggests that the electron spin should be carried nearly unaffected over
considerable distances, making practical applications of lateral spintronics feasible
[9, 10]. Pioneering works have echoed such high expectations, heralding graphene as
a unique material [11]. Current state-of-the-art research conﬁrms the potential of
graphene for transporting spin signals over tens of micrometers at room temperature,
which is sufﬁcient for the realization of magnetic sensors, nanooscillators, or spin-based
logic circuits [12–15].
Graphene also provides solutions for the integration of several circuit elements on the
same platform. For instance, non-volatile graphene ﬁeld-effect transistors with ferro-
electric gates have been demonstrated to operate as three terminal resistive memories,
while graphene-based memristors are interesting since they may act both as memory
and logic elements [16].
From this perspective, graphene, being compatible with more-than-Moore CMOS
and non-volatile low-energy MRAM, brings revolutionary opportunities for achieving
efﬁcient spin manipulation and for the creation of a full spectrum of spintronic nano-
devices, including ultra-low-energy devices and circuits comprising (re-)writable micro-
chips, transistors, logic gates, and more.

SOC in Graphene – Expectation of Long Spin Lifetimes
The unique electronic band structure of graphene leads to a strong suppression of
backscattering and allows electrons to travel over long distances at a constant speed
of c/300, even at room temperature. This makes graphene highly interesting for a variety
of electronic applications, where high carrier mobility plays an important role.
Also different than other materials (metal and semiconductors), the electronic struc-
ture in graphene is electron–hole symmetric with a linear energy dispersion relation

Additionally, the absence of hyperﬁne coupling and the small intraatomic spin–orbit
coupling in carbon atoms should yield long spin relaxation times [17]. The spin–orbit
coupling interaction can be derived from the weakly relativistic limit of the Dirac

Hamiltonian. In its simplest explanation, it can be seen as an effective magnetic ﬁeld in
the rest frame of an electron moving through an electric ﬁeld E. This effective magnetic
ﬁeld couples to the spin angular momentum of the electron as a Zeeman term, so that the
SOC Hamiltonian can be written as Hso ¼ gμB

. We ﬁnally
note that the SOC Hamiltonian is invariant under the time reversal operation [17].
The size of the intrinsic spin–orbit coupling in graphene was a matter of some debate,
with the earliest estimates of 200 μeV [18] conﬂicting with tight-binding studies (s and
p orbitals only) [19] that predicted a spin–orbit gap as small as 1 μeV. All-electron ﬁrst-
principle calculations gave a much higher value of 50 μeV [20], but it was later shown
that the spin–orbit coupling is inﬂuenced by the (nominally unoccupied) d orbital and
higher orbitals [21], which give a gap of about 25 μeV. It is currently accepted that the
intrinsic SOC is a value ranging between 10 and 25 μeV.
Additionally, in a device geometry, graphene is generally placed onto a substrate,
which usually includes screened charged impurities and is gated during the transport
measurement. While free-standing graphene ideally has a center of inversion symmetry,
making its states doubly (spin) degenerate at a given momentum, even in the presence
of intrinsic spin–orbit coupling, graphene on a substrate or under a gate bias voltage
loses this property and the bands are split. This splitting is akin to the one encountered
in semiconductor physics under the name of Bychkov–Rashba splitting or structure
inversion asymmetry-induced splitting [22, 23]. In the presence of Rashba splitting,
only Kramers degeneracy is left, meaning that the energies of the states of opposite
spins and momenta are equal.
The Stark effect is the mechanism describing the extrinsic splitting of the graphene
bands, driven by the SOC-induced hybridization of pz and s orbitals combined with the
intraatomic splitting of the p-orbitals. Tight-binding and ab-initio calculations show that
d orbitals give a contribution of only about 1% [19, 22]. The corresponding extrinsic
gap is typically found to reach about 10 μeV for an electric ﬁeld of 1 V/nm, and it scales
linearly with the ﬁeld. For the continuum model approximation of linear massless Dirac
fermions, the expression of the Rashba SOC Hamiltonian reads HR ¼ λR τσxsy  σysx


whereas the intrinsic SOC Hamiltonian is HI ¼ λIτσzsz with τ ¼ 1 a valley index, and
σ, s are Pauli matrices for pseudospin and spin, respectively.
It is also useful to note that if one computes the eigenstates of the full Hamiltonian

between spin and pseudospin is referred to as spin–pseudospin coupling, and it has
further consequences for the time-dependent dynamics of spin and pseudospin polar-
ization and spin relaxation mechanisms.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that a signiﬁcant enhancement of the extrinsic spin
splitting has been reported for supported graphene [24–26]. The estimations of the
splitting are obtained by assuming the Elliot–Yafet spin relaxation mechanism, which
consistently results in a splitting of the order of 1 meV in samples of different origins
and processing [27]. In the case of chemisorbed hydrogen, such an enhancement was
argued to result from charge transfer and local sp3 hybridization and distortion caused
by the defect/graphene interaction [28]. This may have consequences for the formation
of the spin Hall effect, as will be discussed later.
11.2.2
Lateral Spintronics – Room Temperature Record High Spin Diffusion Lengths
The ﬁrst spin injection measurements based on non-local spin valve geometry revealed
surprisingly short spin relaxation times of 100–200 ps, which were only weakly dependent
on the charge density and temperature [11]. However, after signiﬁcant effort to improve
device integration, and interface engineering such as encapsulating graphene with hex-
agonal boron nitride substrates, room temperature spin lifetimes in single, bi, and trilayer
graphene devices have been found to reach up to 12 nanoseconds with spin diffusion
lengths up to 30 μm, combined with carrier mobilities exceeding 20,000 cm2/(V s)
[12–14, 77]. The spin relaxation lengths of graphene compare favorably with those
obtained in metallic thin ﬁlms such as aluminum [29], silver [30], or copper [31]. For
metallic thin ﬁlms, the relaxation lengths are about 1 μm. The transmission of spin
information has been demonstrated over much longer distance in crystalline aluminum
(several hundreds of micrometers [4]) and semiconductors, albeit at cryogenic tempera-
tures. In GaAs, spin lifetimes of a few tens of nanoseconds and spin relaxation lengths of
the order of 10 μm have been observed [32]. The results are more favorable in intrinsic
silicon: spin lifetimes of several hundred of nanoseconds have been reported [33] whereas
the measurements of Hanle precession was identiﬁed over millimeter distances [34].
11.3
How to Measure Spin Lifetimes in Graphene and 2D Materials
11.3.1
Two-Terminal Resistance Measurements
To investigate the potential of graphene for spintronics, two-terminal resistance meas-
urements are of fundamental importance. This approach allows for the investigation of
interface effects, and for optimizing spin injection efﬁciency. In addition, using the
phenomenological theory developed by Fert and co-workers, an estimate of the spin
diffusion length can be obtained [35]. Finally, two-terminal devices will be key for the
further construction of spin-logic-based circuits, so that their complete understanding
will be necessary for future technologies.
As discussed above, graphene exhibits a variety of electronic properties suitable for
spintronics, including the capability for efﬁcient spin injection from ferromagnets
owing to the tunability of the Fermi level [35]. The large electron velocity already

implies the propagation of spin polarized currents over long distances, meaning that the
optimization of graphene spin valve devices necessarily includes a focus on the speciﬁc
role of magnetic contacts, including their spin injection and detection efﬁciencies and
the possible role of interface effects in spin relaxation and spin dephasing. Interface
engineering to optimize spin injection and detection between a ferromagnet and gra-
phene still remains a very challenging issue and represents one of the main bottlenecks
for graphene spintronics. Systematic investigations of the role of the tunnel barrier have
been slow because of difﬁculties in growing uniform, ultra-thin insulating layers on
graphene. Any irregularity during growth favors the formation of pinholes which may
alter the spin injection efﬁciency.
Contact effects and general environmental factors can have an important impact on
the estimated spin relaxation lengths and thus bring an important contribution to the
device efﬁciency. A fundamental mechanism known as “conductivity mismatch” was
identiﬁed in 2000 as a roadblock for efﬁcient spin injection from ferromagnets into
semiconductors [4]. To circumvent this effect and to prevent the “backﬂow” of the spins
back into the contact, efforts have been made to increase the contact resistance above
the “spin resistance” of the spin transport channel. This backﬂow is generally accom-
panied by spin relaxation in the metallic ferromagnet, which has a very short spin
relaxation time. It has been demonstrated that the effect can be controlled technologic-
ally by tuning the dwell time of the spins in the semiconducting channel, giving only a
narrow window for the contact resistance [28]. In graphene, this phenomenon is well
described in [35]. A two-terminal spin valve device made of graphene on a silicon
carbide substrate is shown in Fig. 11.1(a), and the local magneto resistance spin signals
measured at 4 K are shown in Fig. 11.1(b). Variations of about 10% of the magneto
resistance in the range of 6 MΩ are observed.

11.3.2
Non-Local Hanle Spin Precession Measurements
The spin diffusion coefﬁcient and the spin relaxation time are generally estimated from
Hanle measurements (Fig. 11.2), which are non-local transport measurements in which
the spin diffusion far from the source–drain contact is tuned by an external and
perpendicular magnetic ﬁeld, inducing spin precession [4, 36–37].
The basic physical principles of the non-local devices are electrical spin injection,
the generation of non-equilibrium spin accumulation, and electrical spin detection
using ferromagnetic electrodes as spin polarizers. Sketches of the device are shown in
Figs. 11.2(a) and (b). Figure 11.2(c) shows a scanning electron microscope image of an
actual device based on a suspended graphene ﬂake [37]. The injected current I on the
source contact (FM1) produces spin accumulation in the graphene layer, which is
quantiﬁed by the detector voltage VNL. The current I is injected from FM1 and away
from FM2, and the electron spins diffuse isotropically from the injection point. The sign
of VNL is determined by the relative magnetization orientations of FM1 and FM2
(Fig. 11.2(d)). The spin accumulation and VNL can then be quantiﬁed from the spin
splitting in the electrochemical potential induced by spin injection, which decays over a
characteristic length λs.
The spin orientation can be manipulated by applying an external magnetic ﬁeld
Bperp [35–37], which is perpendicular to the substrate and induces coherent spin
precession in the plane of the graphene layer (Fig. 11.2(b)). In this situation, spins
that are polarized along the FM1 magnetization rotate around an axis that is parallel
to the ﬁeld with a period determined by the Larmor frequency Ω = γBperp, where γ is
the gyromagnetic ratio of the electron. During the time t that it takes the electron to
travel to FM2, the spin will rotate an angle ϕ = γt. Because VNL is sensitive to the
projection of the spins along the FM2 magnetization, it oscillates as a function of
Bperp (Fig. 11.2(e)). The measured non-local magneto resistance RNL = VNL/I is
usually modeled with a one-dimensional spin-Bloch diffusion equation [35–37],
which assumes a diffusive propagation of spin and relates the resistance to micro-
scopic parameters through

where Ds = vF
2τs is the spin diffusion coefﬁcient, τs is the spin relaxation time, and L is
the distance between electrodes. An important observation is that this approach cannot
tackle the situation of ballistic or quasi-ballistic spin propagation and needs further
generalization for describing clean graphene, for which mean-free paths can be several
hundreds of nanometers long [38], and are thus comparable to the typical electrode
spacing. Additionally, for more disordered graphene the contribution of quantum
interferences and localization phenomena, which in certain materials have been shown
to be robust up to 100 K, are neglected and could affect the estimates of Ds and τs.
Finally, τs has been also estimated independently from two-terminal spin valve

measurements, and was found to be at least one order of magnitude larger than those
obtained from Hanle measurements [35–37]. This difference was attributed to the high
contact resistances in the two-terminal measurements, compared with those typically
found in four-terminal Hanle measurements [12, 35].
Spin transport has been studied in non-local devices (see illustration in Fig. 11.2(a))
where the graphene was attached to, or supported by, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)
[13, 14, 77]. Signiﬁcant increases of the spin lifetime (up to 12 ns) and length
(exceeding 30 micrometers at room temperature) have been reported as compared with
graphene on SiO2 establishing a new record for spin relaxation length at room tempera-
ture [77]. Others have performed experiments where the graphene was fully encapsu-
lated by h-BN, showing indications that the ratio of spin lifetimes for spin directions
perpendicular and parallel to the graphene sheet can be tuned by the use of top and
bottom gate electrodes [13]. These results suggest an electrically induced Rashba spin–
orbit coupling, and open up new possibilities for electric control of spin transport in

graphene. However, subsequent studies of this ratio using a much smaller perpendicular
magnetic ﬁeld showed no evidence of Rashba spin–orbit coupling, albeit for a SiO2
substrate and not for graphene fully encapsulated in h-BN [78].
These results identify the Rashba spin–orbit coupling as one of the factors which
could be responsible for the observed short spin relaxation times. Another bottleneck for
spin transport is inhomogeneous oxide barriers which may result in conducting pinholes
within the otherwise insulating spin injection and detection barriers [39]. In graphene/
MgO/Co spin valve devices, it was found that the pinholes cause inhomogeneous
current ﬂow through the MgO barrier. Next to the actual spin signal, this results in an
additional charge accumulation signal which is measured as a magnetic ﬁeld-dependent
background signal in the non-local voltage [40]. This background signal, which is often
observed in non-local spin transport studies, is thus a hallmark for the quality of the
oxide barriers. Additional background signals that depend on the carrier density can
originate from thermoelectric effects that are known to be strong in graphene and that
can be further enhanced by the presence of hot electrons [41].
Finally, it is worth observing that spin injection is enhanced by the use of suitable
interface materials. Because of the so-called conductance mismatch and the spin absorp-
tion at both injector and detector FMs, the spin injection efﬁciency is strongly suppressed
for Ohmic contacts. Typical reported non-local spin magneto resistances in this case, i.e.,
the overall change ΔRNL in the non-local spin transresistance VNL/I between the parallel
and antiparallel conﬁguration of the electrode magnetizations, are in the range of a few
mΩ to a few tens of mΩ [42]. Larger values of ΔRNL have been obtained by placing an
insulator between graphene and the FMs, which helps circumvent the conductance
mismatch and reduces the spin absorption in the contacts. The insulators are typically
MgO or AlOx because of their success for tunnel magneto resistance [11]. In this way,
ΔRNL was observed to increase to up to a few ohms (pinhole barrier) or a hundred ohms
(tunnel barrier) [43]. However, high-resistance tunnel barriers are detrimental to high-
speed and spin-torque applications and alternative approaches to increase ΔRNL and the
spin accumulation have been proposed by, for example, adding a Cu layer at the metal–
graphene interface [44]. Recently developed unconventional interfaces comprising
amorphous carbon [45] or ﬂuorinated graphene [46] are also very promising.
11.3.3
Spin Relaxation Mechanism – DP versus EY
The analysis of scattering mechanisms and their connection to spin relaxation are
necessary in order to achieve optimal production methods for graphene-based spin
valves. In materials such as metals and small band-gap semiconductors, two mechan-
isms are usually dominant, namely the Elliot–Yafet (EY) [47, 48] and Dyakonov–Perel
(DP) [49] mechanisms. In EY, the electron spin has a ﬁnite probability to ﬂip off
impurities or phonons during each scattering event [47, 48]. The DP mechanism is
driven by the precession of electron spins about an effective magnetic ﬁeld whose
orientation depends on the momentum, with the direction and frequency of precession
changing at each scattering event [47, 48]. A theoretical derivation of the EY mechanism

in SLG, accounting for the Dirac cone physics, predicts a spin relaxation time that varies
proportionally with both the transport time and the electron density [50].
Figure 11.3 provides an overview of the dynamics of spin polarization of electrons
moving through graphene away from the Dirac point. The dependence of the polariza-
tion dynamics on disorder strength is dictated by the transport time τp. An effective
spin–orbit coupling λR (as induced by ad-atoms for instance) leads to spin precession
when the injected electrons are polarized out of the plane or along the direction of
momentum. The spin precession time is given by TΩ ¼ πħ=λR. Panel (a) shows the case
when τp  TΩ, a regime which is typically seen in experiments. Different snapshots at
different times (T1, T2, T3) show that the ensemble-averaged spin polarization (Sz in
panel (d)) decays weakly, since elastic scattering interferes with the spin precession.
A scattering event experienced by one propagating state randomizes its momentum
and hence the orientation of the effective ﬁeld about which the spin precesses. Being no
longer coherent with the other states, such randomization drives spin relaxation in the
ensemble. The spin relaxation time depends on how strongly the precession of the
scattered state deviates from the rest of the ensemble. If the scattering time is short
(τp  TΩ), the difference in the precession remains small.

By increasing the scattering time (τp  TΩ), faster spin decoherence is obtained
(panel (b)), as conﬁrmed by comparing the corresponding averaged polarization (panels
(d) and (e)). This illustrates the Dyakonov–Perel mechanism, for which the spin
relaxation time scales inversely with the transport time (τs / 1=τp).
Panel (c) shows the clean limit (with small residual disorder such that τp 	 TΩ),
where only a few scattering events occur during the time sequence. The average
polarization (panel (f)) then clearly exhibits the spin precession phenomenon character-
ized by oscillations with period TΩ. On top of this, the spin signal decays continuously
owing to scattering and dephasing effects. The decay is weaker for lower scattering,
suggesting that τs should be maximized for long τp, usually observed at energies closest
to the Dirac point.
However, based on further quantum simulations, we ﬁnd the opposite behavior, i.e. τs
is minimized at E  0 and that a simpliﬁed description of spin motion fails to capture
the more subtle phenomena in place at the Dirac point, as detailed below.

New Spin Relaxation Mechanisms
Original predictions of spin lifetimes in the micro- or even millisecond range [51], based
on conventionally conceived mechanisms of spin relaxation, have heralded graphene as
an exceptional and unique material for the development of lateral spintronics [15].
However, despite one decade of experimental efforts to improve the quality of the
material and device fabrication, spin lifetimes have only reached the nanosecond scale.
A variety of modeling techniques from ab-initio to efﬁcient real-space spin propaga-
tion methods have to be used for an in-depth exploration and understanding of what
makes spin dynamics in graphene unique and why spin relaxation times are much
shorter than initially predicted. New spin relaxation mechanisms, beyond Dyakonov–
Perel and Elliot–Yafet, have been recently discovered in graphene and are either related
to the presence of magnetic moments [53, 54] or to the contribution of spin–pseudospin
locking, the latter of which has been shown to yield minimum spin lifetimes at the Dirac
point and at high energies [55–57]. Experimentally these mechanisms can be identiﬁed
by studying the spin relaxation anisotropy ζ = τs?
s∥, where τs∥τs? is the lifetime of spins
oriented in (perpendicular to) the graphene plane [9, 13]. The ratio ζ provides infor-
mation on the dominant spin–orbit ﬁelds that are involved in the relaxation. A classical
example is the two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin–orbit coupling, for
which ζ = 0.5; this is due to the fact that spins along the in-plane Rashba ﬁeld do not
precess and do not dephase. Recently it has been demonstrated that ζ can be readily
determined by measuring the response of non-local spin devices under oblique magnetic
ﬁelds [78].
Fast spin relaxation can be related to the presence of isolated magnetic impurities that
also act as resonant scatterers. A magnetic impurity locally produces a ﬁxed (although
arbitrarily polarized) magnetic moment [52, 54], and an enhanced spin ﬂip probability is
introduced due to the exchange interaction between propagating spins and the local

moment, where resonant scattering occurs. While in conventional scattering (Born
approximation) the probability for a spin ﬂip is small (of the order of 0.01%), for a
resonant scatterer the spin ﬂip probability becomes comparable to that of spin conserv-
ing scattering (around 50%).
Similarly to a Friedel virtual bound state, propagating spins will remain trapped by
the resonant scatterer for a certain dwell time, during which the electron spin will
precess due to the exchange interaction with the magnetic impurity (Fig. 11.4(a)).
Such mechanism works as long as the spin precession time is shorter or comparable to
the resonance dwell time, which is predicted to be the case for ad-atoms such as
hydrogen [52].
The local magnetism induced by a hydrogen impurity has been calculated using the
self-consistent Hubbard model in the mean ﬁeld approximation for the dilute limit,
while spin relaxation lengths and transport times were computed using an efﬁcient real-
space order-N wavepacket propagation method [17]. Typical spin lifetimes of the order
of 1 ns are obtained for 1 ppm of hydrogen impurities, while charge transport times of
about 50 ps lead to spin diffusion lengths far beyond tens of micrometers. The spin
lifetime modiﬁcation with impurity density suggests a scaling τs / τp as for the case of
the Elliott–Yafet mechanism, even though the origin of the spin relaxation is unrelated
to the spin–orbit interaction [54].
Fast spin relaxation can also be related to the complex interplay between the spin and
pseudospin degrees of freedom when disorder does not mix valleys [55]. The contribu-
tion of spin/pseudospin entanglement is particularly important when defects or
impurities at the origin of local Rashba spin–orbit coupling preserve the pseudospin
symmetry and lead to very long mean-free path (schematics shown in Fig. 11.4(b)).
Pseudospin-related effects (and the associated Berry’s phase) are known to drive
most of the unique transport signatures of graphene (Klein tunneling, weak anti-
localization, anomalous quantum Hall effect), but until recently the role of the
pseudospin on spin relaxation has not been established. Pseudospin and spin dynamics
are usually perceived as decoupled from one another, with pseudospin dynamics much
faster than those for spins. However, this picture collapses in the vicinity of the Dirac
Fig. 11.4 (a) “Planetary” model of resonant scattering electrons, where the electrons tend to stay
around (“orbit”) the impurity for a certain dwell time. If the dwell time is comparable to or greater
than the spin precession time induced by the exchange interaction with the local magnetic
moment, then spin-ﬂip scattering is as likely as spin-conserved scattering. (b) Schematic of the
entangled spin–pseudospin dynamics induced by local Rashba spin–orbit interaction related to

point, a region that is out of reach for semiclassical and perturbative approaches, but is
particularly relevant for experiments. In the presence of SOC, spin couples to orbital
motion, and therefore to pseudospin [24], so that spin and pseudospin dynamics cannot
be treated independently.
Below we present spin dynamics in graphene using more general quantum simula-
tions while taking into account the speciﬁcities of the graphene band structure in the
presence of spin–orbit coupling and disorder (energy broadening and electron–hole
puddles). It has recently been found that the strength and size of electron–hole puddles
can vary signiﬁcantly for different substrates (such as SiO2 and h-BN), and in the
situation of clean supported graphene it is generally assumed that a weak Rashba-SOC
ﬁeld is always present because of mirror symmetry breaking and environmental electric
ﬁelds. Values of the Rashba spin–orbit coupling typically range from a few to a few tens
of μeV.
An important limit for spin relaxation in graphene is the limit of very weak
momentum scattering, when charges propagate ballistically and the momentum scat-
tering rate is no longer a relevant timescale for spin relaxation. In this limit, spin
relaxation is dictated by the presence of energy broadening and non-uniform preces-
sion frequency. The presence of spin–orbit coupling generates an effective magnetic
ﬁeld Beff at the origin of the electron spin precession. When the magnitude of Beff (or
its direction) depends on the energy or momentum of the charge carriers, then because
of a certain distribution of energies or momenta (due to temperature or effective
disorder-induced broadening), the total spin signal will be dictated by the interference
and dephasing between different precession frequencies. To see this more explicitly,
consider the example shown in Fig. 11.5, where we assume that the spin precession
frequency varies linearly with energy, ω E

In general, Eq. (11.2) indicates that the combination of energy broadening and
non-uniform spin precession leads to a decay in the spin signal due to dephasing, with
a relaxation rate proportional to both the broadening η and the variation in the preces-
sion α. This decay will occur even in the ballistic limit as long as there is a mixing in
energy or momentum. We note that the decay is not necessarily exponential, but rather
depends on the broadening function and the variation in the precession frequency. For
example, replacing the Lorentzian in Eq. (11.2) with a Gaussian distribution gives a

Figure 11.6 below shows how this phenomenon manifests itself in pristine gra-
phene. We use a tight-binding representation of graphene with Rashba SOC (see Eq.
(11.3) below) from which we calculate the spin dynamics of a large sample of k-points
in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. The total spin signal is the sum of spin dynamics at each
k-point weighted by a Lorentzian broadening function. Panels (a) and (b) show the
complex spin dynamics that arise in graphene with Rashba spin–orbit coupling in the
presence of energy broadening. A non-uniform and anisotropic spin precession fre-
quency, arising from the tight-binding band structure, results in a collective spin signal

exhibiting multiple exponential decays and beating patterns. Panel (c) shows the
energy-dependent spin relaxation time extracted from the spin dynamics. Owing to
the complexity of the spin dynamics, we calculate the spin relaxation time as the point
where the envelope function of Sz(t) falls below e–1, as illustrated in panels (a) and (b).
Here we have assumed a Rashba SOC strength of VR = 25 μeV and a broadening of
η = 13.5 meV.
There are two interesting features of the spin relaxation time shown in
Fig. 11.6(c). The ﬁrst is the M-shaped energy dependence of τs, which is a minimum
at the Dirac point together with an independent decrease towards higher energies.
Near the Dirac point, spin–pseudospin coupling leads to highly complex spin
dynamics [55], which leads to fast dephasing of the spin signal in the presence of
energy broadening. This effect is weaker away from the Dirac point, leading to the
minimum of τs at the Dirac point. At higher energies, the spin splitting becomes aniso-
tropic, resulting in increased dephasing due to the mixing over momentum and energy.
Overall, these two effects yield the M-shape dependence of the spin lifetime on the
energy or electron density. This shape is solely a consequence of the graphene band
structure (including Rashba SOC), and is thus a signature of the dephasing-induced spin
relaxation mechanism in graphene.
The second interesting feature is the magnitude of the spin relaxation time. Even in
the clean limit, relatively modest values of Rashba SOC (μeV) and energy broadening
(meV) yield spin relaxation times of the order of nanoseconds. While we used a
constant value of η, in realistic systems this energy broadening could arise from
scattering (electron–electron, electron–phonon, etc.), electron–hole puddles [58], or
even a ﬁnite temperature. The strength of the spin dephasing in the clean limit suggests
that it could also play an important role in more disordered systems.
To compare this limit with a situation of more realistic disorder, we simulate
graphene supported on SiO2 and h-BN substrates using a tight-binding model given by

, and the puddle depths (εα) are chosen at random so that the
standard deviation for the local potential of h-BN (SiO2) is 5 meV (56 meV), similar to
experiments [58]. We also assume a Rashba SOC strength of VR ¼ 25 μeV. Our
calculations reveal that for graphene on SiO2, τp=TΩ  1, whereas for graphene on
h-BN τp=TΩ  1. This will have profound consequences for the dominant spin

which allows us to estimate the spin precession time and the spin lifetime.
Figure 11.7 shows a global summary of our results, where in the main frame we plot
the spin lifetime τs as a function of the inverse momentum relaxation time, 1/τp. For the
SiO2 substrate, we ﬁnd that τs is inversely proportional to the density of e–h puddles,
and, equivalently, to τp. In fact, we ﬁnd that for E = –200 meV the scaling matches well
with the traditional DP relation, τs ¼ TΩ=2π
ð
Þ2=τp, where TΩ ¼ 2πħ=3VR. For the
h-BN substrate, we ﬁnd the opposite behavior, with τs proportional to τp, reminiscent
of the EY mechanism. This transition in behavior can be connected to the relationship
between τp and TΩ. For SiO2, one obtains τp  TΩ; in this regime, the momentum
scattering strongly interrupts the spin dynamics, inducing motional narrowing of the
precession and yielding the DP relaxation mechanism (cf. Figs. 11.3(a) and (d)). For the
h-BN substrate, one ﬁnds that τp  TΩ, allowing for spin precession between scattering
events. In this case, the momentum scattering acts as an effective broadening of states,
leading to increased dephasing and relaxation. This behavior can be qualitatively
reproduced by tuning the broadening parameter in the case of clean graphene (dashed
line in main frame).
Interestingly, similar trends have been obtained in experiments that compare spin
relaxation on SiO2 and h-BN substrates. As shown in the inset of Fig. 11.7, these

measurements indicate an inverse relationship between τs and the sample mobility for
SiO2 substrates, suggesting the DP mechanism of spin relaxation. Meanwhile, spin
lifetimes of single-layer graphene on h-BN substrates appear to show a positive
correlation between τs and mobility.
In conclusion, the numerical study of spin dynamics in ultra-clean graphene devices
has revealed that a very weak uniform Rashba spin–orbit coupling (with a value
of μeV) – as generally assumed for supported graphene – in conjunction with
substrate-dependent electron–hole puddles, yields spin lifetimes in the range of few
hundreds of picoseconds to the nanosecond scale. The spin relaxation is jointly
governed by the Dyakonov–Perel mechanism together with a pure dephasing mechan-
ism whose relative strength depends on the electron–hole puddle characteristics [56].
Spin dynamics in clean graphene on SiO2 are found to be dominated by the Dyakonov–
Perel mechanism, in contrast with the case of puddles for the boron nitride substrate.
One should note that the effect of a low density of ad-atoms, such as gold or nickel
(down to 1012cm–2 or lower), yield similar conclusions [55]. By introducing a random
Rashba ﬁeld in real-space but vanishingly small intervalley scattering, long mean-free
paths of the order of several hundreds of nanometers are obtained, but the time-
dependent spin polarization also reveals a short spin lifetime that is at a minimum at
the Dirac point.
The spin relaxation mechanism revealed in non-magnetic samples is interpreted as
resulting from a quantum entanglement between spin and pseudospin driven by SOC,
unique to graphene. The mixing between spin and pseudospin results in fast spin
dephasing even when approaching the ballistic limit, with increasing relaxation times
away from the Dirac point, as repeatedly observed experimentally. In the clean gra-
phene limit, SOC can be caused by ad-atoms, ripples or even the substrate. Such a
ﬁnding actually suggests inspiring ways to control the spin by modifying the pseudos-
pin or vice versa. For example, spins could be manipulated by inducing pseudomagnetic
ﬁelds by straining graphene [15].
11.5
Proximity Effects and Spin Gating
In addition to ballistic transport and micron-long mean-free paths [38], spin relax-
ation lengths in graphene also reach unrivalled values. Thus, graphene’s intrinsic
features are ideal not only for downscaling of conventional devices, but also to
demonstrate radically new ideas, for instance harnessing spin manipulation. New
concepts to be explored include tailoring spin degrees of freedom in graphene
through magnetic proximity effects, torque effects, the spin Hall effect, mechanical
strain, chemical functionalization, or nanopatterning, all of which require an interdis-
ciplinary research community. By tackling these issues, one can anticipate the
eventual demonstration of external ways to control the propagation of spin currents,
achieving operational reliability at room temperature and architectural compatibility
with Si technologies.

11.5.1
Magnetic Proximity Effects
Electronic and spin properties in graphene can be modulated by harnessing interface-
related proximity effects with insulating magnetic materials, magnetic molecules,
materials that have a large spin–orbit coupling, or ferroelectric materials. For example,
spin polarization has been predicted to be induced by an interface with europium oxide
[59] or yttrium iron garnet (YIG), or a material with strong spin–orbit interaction [60].
Such a mechanism would not require ferromagnetic metallic contacts to inject spin-
polarized electrons, and thus could be a way to circumvent the conductivity mismatch
problem. Similarly, it is appealing to study the interaction between spin-polarized
currents in graphene and extrinsic sources of spin or magnetization.
11.5.2
Spin Hall Effect
The spin Hall effect (SHE) is a relativistic spin–orbit coupling phenomenon that can be
used to electrically generate or detect spin currents in non-magnetic systems. Spin
current generation by means of the SHE in heavy metals for spin-torque applications
has gained considerable attention in recent years, and magnetic memory prototypes
have been demonstrated using this technology [65]. The SHE in graphene has been
studied by means of the so-called Hall bar geometry (Fig. 11.8(a)) that relies on the SHE
for spin injection and the inverse SHE for detection.
In a ﬁrst experiment, a large Hall response was observed near the graphene neutrality
point in the presence of an external magnetic ﬁeld [61]. The results were ascribed to
spin currents that resulted from the imbalance of the Hall resistivity for the spin-up and
spin-down carriers induced by the Zeeman interaction (thus entitled Zeeman Hall
Effect). This process does not involve a spin–orbit interaction, i.e., is not of the SHE
origin, and is largest in the cleanest graphene samples.
More recently, spin Hall angles larger than 10% have, surprisingly, been reported in
graphene after the addition of ad-atoms such as hydrogen or metallic particles, or by
contacting graphene with WS2, suggesting that the SHE (in modiﬁed graphene) can also
be an efﬁcient way of generating spin currents [62]. The controlled addition of small
amounts of covalently bonded hydrogen atoms has been reported to induce an enhance-
ment of the spin–orbit interaction, estimated to be up to three orders of magnitudes
Fig. 11.8 (a) Hall bar device. A charge current in the top arm generates a spin current via the
SHE that ﬂows to the bottom bar, which results in a measurable voltage via the inverse SHE.

when compared with clean graphene [63]. Such large enhancement was estimated from
non-local signals of up to 100 Ω, which are observed at zero external magnetic ﬁelds
and at room temperature. From the magnetic ﬁeld and the length dependence of the non-
local signal, a spin–orbit strength of 2.5 meV was extracted for samples with 0.05%
hydrogenation using an Elliot–Yafet scaling. However, the interpretation of the results
as originating from the SHE has been recently criticized and is thus still an open
question [64].
Additional experiments on hydrogenated graphene and graphene decorated by Au
and Ir ad-atoms indicate that the spin Hall model fails to explain the observed phenom-
enon and an alternative interpretation might be required [64]. Moreover, recent quantum
simulations found the presence of multiple background contributions to the non-local
resistance, as measured experimentally, that are unrelated to SHE and question the spin
origin of the measurements [79]. Therefore, the mechanisms involved in the generation
of the detected signals are yet to be fully understood, and further optimization of the
SHE has not yet been achieved; these will be key objectives for the years to come.
Device geometries such as the one shown in Fig. 11.8(b), or the one proposed in [79],
present an alternative for the exploration and control of the SHE in a modiﬁed graphene
platform [65].
11.5.3
Quantum Spin Hall Effect
In 2005, Kane and Mele predicted the existence of the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE)
in graphene due to intrinsic spin–orbit coupling (SOC) [66].
In the QSHE regime, the action of the spin–orbit interaction can be understood as a
momentum-dependent magnetic ﬁeld coupling to the spin of the electron, which results
in the formation of chiral edge channels for spin up and spin down electron population.
The observation of the QSHE is inhibited in clean graphene owing to increasingly small
intrinsic spin–orbit coupling of order of μeV [67], but has been demonstrated in strong
SOC materials (such as CdTe/HgTe/CdTe quantum wells or bismuth selenide and
telluride alloys), giving rise to the new exciting ﬁeld of topological insulators [68, 69].
Recent proposals to induce a topological phase in graphene include functionalization
with heavy ad-atoms [70], proximity effect with topological insulators [71], or intercal-
ation and functionalization with 5d transition metals [72].
In particular, the seminal theoretical study by Weeks and co-workers [70] has
revealed that graphene endowed with a modest coverage of heavy ad-atoms (such
as indium and thallium) could exhibit a substantial band gap and QSHE ﬁngerprints
(detectable in transport or spectroscopic measurements). For instance, one signature
of such a topological state would be a robust quantized two-terminal conductance
(2e2/h), with an ad-atom density-dependent conductance plateau extending inside the
bulk gap induced by SOC [70, 73]. To date, such a prediction lacks experimental
conﬁrmation, despite some recent results on indium-functionalized graphene that have
shown a surprising reduction of the Dirac point resistance with increasing indium
density [74].

Ad-atoms deposited on graphene inevitably segregate, forming islands rather than a
homogeneous distribution, and the impact of ad-atom clustering on the formation of the
QSHE has been clariﬁed recently by Cresti and co-workers focusing on thallium
ad-atoms [75]. In this work, in addition to the disappearance of the QSHE upon atom
segregation, two other physical regimes are identiﬁed, namely a SHE regime in which
spins with opposite polarization still accumulate at opposite edges, but in the absence of
a bulk band gap. The second regime of topological nature is manifested in a bulk
minimum conductivity and suppression of localization effects. Additionally, such a bulk
topological state is visualized by the real-space formation of locally and partially chiral
bulk currents circulating around thallium islands, which are at the origin of the
suppression of quantum interferences.
Finally, the scale-invariant quantum conductivity is reminiscent of the usual topo-
logical insulator surface states but exists in a bulk extended state forming inside the
material in the presence of locally strong and inhomogeneous spin–orbit coupling. The
ﬁnite value of the quantum conductivity also point towards the existence of a quantum
critical point, as suggested for instance theoretically by Mirlin and co-workers in the
situation of similar symmetry breaking effects [76].

Graphene–BN Heterostructures
Lei Wang, James Hone, and Cory. R. Dean
12.1
Introduction
Minimizing extrinsic sources of disorder is crucial to fully characterize and utilize the
exceptional electronic properties of graphene. In the ﬁrst studies of graphene exfoliated
onto SiO2 substrates, it was shown that scattering from charged surface states and
impurities [1], substrate surface roughness [2, 3], and SiO2 surface optical phonons [4–6]
dominate the electron response, limiting device mobilities to less than ~20,000 cm2/V s.
Near charge neutrality, substrate-induced disorder creates inhomogeneous patterns of
electrons and hole puddles [7, 8] that obscure the low-density transport signatures.
Suspending graphene above the substrate provided the ﬁrst demonstration that carrier
mobility in excess of 200,000 cm2=V s could be achieved [9, 10]. However, this
geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. Achieving
both device requirements – namely high electron mobility and substrate-supported
geometry – was made possible by the introduction of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)
as an alternative substrate dielectric [11].
The hexagonal phase of BN is an insulating isomorph of graphite with boron and
nitrogen atoms occupying the inequivalent A and B sublattices in the Bernal structure.
The different on-site energies of the boron and nitrogen atoms result in a large (5.97 eV)
band gap [12] and a small (1.7%) lattice mismatch with graphite [13]. Owing to the
strong, in-plane, ionic bonding of the planar hexagonal lattice structure, h-BN is
relatively inert and is expected to be free of dangling bonds or surface charge traps.
Furthermore, the atomically planar surface may play a role in suppressing rippling in
graphene, which has been shown to mechanically conform to both corrugated and ﬂat
substrates [2, 14]. The dielectric properties of h-BN are similar to those of SiO2,
allowing the use of h-BN as an alternative gate dielectric with no loss of functionality
[15]. Moreover, the surface optical phonon modes of h-BN have energies two times
larger than similar modes in SiO2, suggesting the possibility of an improved high-
temperature and high-electric-ﬁeld performance of h-BN based graphene devices over
those using typical oxide/graphene stacks [16, 17].
The ﬁrst electrical transport measurements of graphene with h-BN dielectrics showed
a dramatic decrease in disorder, exhibiting an order of magnitude enhancement in
carrier mobility [11]. This technical advancement paved the way for numerous experi-
ments exploring the intrinsic electron properties and device applications in the disorder-
free limit, and, indeed, most modern studies of graphene now include h-BN as the

standard substrate choice [18]. Many excellent reviews can be found discussing the
details of these experiments and so we attempt to avoid repetition here. Instead, we
focus on the mechanical assembly techniques that we have developed in recent years
to maximize device performance. Our discussion centers on device characteristics that
are equally important for both fundamental scientiﬁc pursuits as well as potential
electronic device applications. These include carrier mobility, electrical contact resist-
ance, environmental insensitivy, and ﬂexibility in terms of the range of device
geometries that may be realized. We conclude by brieﬂy reviewing recent applications
of these same techniques to the emerging study of other 2D van der Waals materials,
beyond graphene.
12.2
Mechanical Assembly of Graphene–BN Heterostructures
12.2.1
van der Waals Assembly
The ﬁrst h-BN-supported graphene devices were constructed using a layer-by-layer
assembly technique, in which a polymer layer was used to peel the graphene off of a
Si/SiO2 substrate and place it onto an h-BN ﬂake [11]. This technique was extended to
enable more complex structures such as fully encapsulated graphene with h-BN as both
the top and bottom dielectric [19]. However, accumulation of polymer residues at the
interfaces has proved to be a signiﬁcant drawback. A particularly striking consequence
of this residue is the appearance of bubbles between layers (Fig. 12.1). These bubbles
limit the size of h-BN/graphene/h-BN devices to e1μm. Moreover, the problem is made
worse as more layers are assembled, making it impractical to realize a multi-layered
device with sufﬁcient area.
The more recently developed van der Waals (vdW) transfer method eliminates
interlayer polymer contamination using van der Waals adhesion to directly assemble
heterostructures. This results in further enhancement of device performance while

(b) AFM image of same sample after transfer of second h-BN layer on top. The dense bubbles
in the area of the h-BN/graphene/h-BN stack are due to polymer residue on the top surface of
the graphene.

simultaneously allowing for increased complexity in the layer stacking sequence. Here
we describe this process in detail.
First, a bare Si chip is coated with e1μm of poly-propylene carbonate (PPC) (Sigma-
Aldrich, CAS 25511–85-7). The PPC is manually peeled from the Si substrate and
placed onto a transparent elastomer stamp (poly-dimethyl siloxane, PDMS) (Fig. 12.3).
In parallel, ﬂakes of graphene and h-BN are exfoliated onto Si/SiO2 (285 nm) wafers
and examined by optical microscopy and atomic-force microscopy (AFM). For the
highest quality devices, particle contamination and atomic step edges in the h-BN are
avoided. To make an h-BN/graphene/BN stack, the slide with the PDMS stamp is
inverted and attached to a micromanipulator. Typically, the micromanipulator is used
on a wafer probe station that provides independent motion and temperature control of
the wafer chuck, and an optical microscope for alignment (Fig. 12.3). Using this setup,
the PDMS stamp is manipulated over a BN ﬂake that will ultimately form the top of the
layer stack. It is then slowly pressed onto the h-BN, and the PPC is heated slightly so
that it ﬂows around the h-BN. The sample is then cooled and the stamp is retracted, such
that the PPC then peels the h-BN from the SiO2 surface.
Next, the manipulator is used to position the h-BN ﬂake over a chosen graphene
ﬂake, to bring the two ﬂakes into contact, and then to lift the stack. The graphene
adheres more strongly to the h-BN than the SiO2 and is lifted from the substrate. We
have found that setting the stage temperature to 30 C produces the best results (nearly
100% yield). This process can be repeated by alternating the h-BN and graphene layers
as desired.
Once complete, the full layer stack is placed onto the ﬁnal target substrate. This
substrate is then heated to 90 C slowly to soften the PPC, which allows the glass slide
and PDMS to be removed, leaving the PPC on the substrate. This PPC is removed with
chloroform, followed by annealing in a vacuum furnace to 350 C for 15 min.
A critical feature of this technique compared with previous methods is that the active
interfaces do not contact any polymer throughout the process, reducing impurities trapped
between the layers. Figure 12.4(a) shows an AFM image of a h-BN/graphene/h-BN
heterostructure made by vdW assembly. The graphene appears clean and free of macro-
scopic contamination over the entire device area,  200 μm2. In Fig. 12.4(b), a high-

resolution cross-section STEM image shows that the resulting interface is pristine, with
the graphene layer nearly indistinguishable from the adjacent BN lattice planes. Remark-
ably, this suggests that despite being assembled in the open laboratory environment, the
interface between the graphene and BN is free of impurities at the atomic scale.
12.2.2
One-Dimensional Edge Contact
Assembly of high-quality h-BN/graphene/h-BN stacks poses a new challenge to making
electrical contacts since the encapsulated graphene layer is no longer directly accessible.

To address this, we developed a new device topology in which 3D metal electrodes are
connected to a 2D graphene layer along the one-dimensional (1D) graphene edge
[22–26]. This is achieved by etching the heterostructure to expose only the edge of the
graphene layer, which is in turn metalized. The result is a similar contact geometry as in
conventional semiconductor FETs where doped 3D bulk regions make lateral contact to
a 2D electron gas (Fig. 12.5). Despite the fact that in in this geometry carrier injection is
limited only to the 1D atomic edge of the graphene sheet, the contact resistance is
remarkably low, reaching 100 Ω  μm. The edge-contact geometry additionally enables a
complete separation of the layer assembly and contact metalization processes.
Figure 12.5 illustrates the edge–contact fabrication process in detail. Beginning with
a BN-G-BN heterostructure, a hard mask is deﬁned on the top BN surface by electron–
beam (e-beam) lithography of hydrogen-silsesquioxane (HSQ) resist. The regions of the
heterostructure outside of the mask are then plasma etched to expose the graphene edge.
Finally, metal leads (1 nm Cr/15 nm Pd/60 nm Au) are deposited by e-beam evaporation
making electrical contact along this edge. Contact can also be made by both thermal
evaporation and sputter deposition, making a variety of other metal combinations
possible.
In Fig. 12.5(b), a cross-section scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM)
image of a representative device shows the resulting geometry of the edge contact. In
the magniﬁed region, electron-energy-loss-spectroscopy (EELS) mapping conﬁrms
that the graphene and metal overlap at a well-deﬁned interface. From the angle of the

etch (~30), we can expect that the graphene terrace is exposed only 1–2 atoms deep, as
conﬁrmed within the resolution of the STEM image. There is no evidence of metal
diffusion into the graphene/BN interface, conﬁrming the truly edge nature of the
contact. The EELS map additionally indicates that contact is made predominantly to
the Cr adhesion layer.
To characterize the quality of the edge contact, we used the transfer-length method
(TLM), as shown in Fig. 12.5(c). Multiple two-terminal graphene devices consisting of
a uniform 2 μm channel width but with varying channel lengths were fabricated, and
their resistances were measured as a function of carrier density n induced by a voltage
applied to a silicon back-gate. Figure 12.5(d) shows the resistance versus channel
length, measured at two different carrier densities. In the diffusive regime, where the
channel length remains several times longer than the mean-free path, the two-terminal
resistance can be written as R ¼ 2RC W
ð
Þ þ ρL=W, where RC is the contact resistance, L
is the device length, W is the device width, and ρ is the 2D channel resistivity; RC and ρ
are extracted as the intercept and slope of a linear ﬁt to the data.
The contact resistance versus carrier density measured for two separate devices is
shown in Fig. 12.5(e). RC is remarkably low, reaching e150Ω  μm for n-type carriers at
high density. As a comparison, this value is approximately 25% lower than the best
reported surface contacts without additional engineering such as chemical [27] or
electrostatic [28] doping. We further note that, since this value is obtained in a two-
terminal geometry, it includes the intrinsic limit set by the quantum resistance of the
channel, which can be subtracted to yield an extrinsic contact resistance close to
100Ω  μm.
The edge-contact resistance is asymmetric, being lower by a factor of 2–3 when the
device is gated to be n-type versus p-type. This asymmetry is consistent with electrical
contact being made primarily to the Cr adhesion layer, as suggested by the cross-section
EELS map (Fig. 12.5), since the Cr work function is approximately 0.16 eV lower than
that of graphene [29]. The contact resistance scales inversely with the contact width
(inset in Fig. 12.5(e)), as expected for the edge–contact geometry. Finally, we ﬁnd that
the contact resistance is largely independent of temperature (Fig. 12.5(f)), in contrast
with the linear temperature-scaling that has been reported for surface contacts [30].
We note that the contact resistance diverges near the charge neutrality point. This
may be expected owing to a decrease in the density of states in the 2D graphene layer.
We also observe an additional local peak in the contact resistance at ﬁnite negative
density. We have observed that exposure of the graphene edge to a weak O2 plasma
immediately prior to metalization can cause this satellite peak position to vary, indicat-
ing that the origin of the second peak may relate to the speciﬁc chemistry of the edge
termination.
A full understanding of the nature of the edge contact remains incomplete. The low
junction resistance results at least in part from the favorable momentum matching across
the geometry [22–26], compared with top contacts where the electron must be injected
perpendicular to the channel. Ab initio simulation assuming a Cr metal electrode
indicates that edge contacts lead to shorter bonding distance with larger orbital overlap
than surface contacts, consistent with previous calculations for other common metals in

the same contact geometry [22]. Incorporation of some additional interfacial species,
such as oxygen, which might result from the etch process, may additionally help to
improve bonding and increase the transmission [20].

High-Performance Graphene
12.3.1
Electron Mobility
Combining the vdW assembly and edge-contact techniques, we can fabricate a larger
area >100 μm2
ð
Þ, with fully encapsulated devices with good contacts. These devices
allow for assessment of device performance from the point of view of electron transport
through the channel. Figure 12.7(a) shows resistance versus density from a
15 μm  15 μm, BN–G–BN, device. The transport characteristics indicate the graphene
device to be remarkably pristine, with a narrow resistance peak (indicating low disorder)
centered near zero back-gate bias (indicating low intrinsic doping). At carrier density
nj j ¼ 4:5  1012 cm2, the room temperature sheet resistivity is less than e40 Ω=W,
corresponding to an equivalent 3D resistivity below 1:5 μΩ  cm, smaller than the
resistivity of any metal at room temperature.
The room temperature electronic mobility μ, calculated using the Drude model as
σ ¼ neμ, is shown in Fig. 12.7(b). A remarkable feature of this device is the simultan-
eous realization of high mobility at both low and high carrier density: μ is
40,000 cm2=V s at n e 4:5  1012 cm2 and increases beyond 140,000 cm2/V s at low
density. We note that in the high-density regime the measured mobility is comparable to
the acoustic phonon-limited mobility theoretically predicted for graphene [6, 31],
indicating that we have reached the intrinsic limit. The room temperature response of
the graphene device reported here outperforms all other 2D materials, including the
highest mobility 2D heterostructures fabricated from III–V semiconductors [32, 33]

carrier densities.
At low temperatures, four-terminal measurement yields a negative resistance (inset in
Fig. 12.7(a)), indicating quasi-ballistic transport [34]. In the diffusive regime, the mean-

is the Fermi wavevector. In Fig. 12.8(a), Lmfp versus
applied gate voltage is shown for selected temperatures from 300 K down to 20 K. The
mean-free path increases with gate voltage until it saturates to a temperature-dependent
value at high density. This maximum Lmfp increases monotonically with decreasing
temperature until the mean-free path approaches the device size at T ~ 40 K (Fig. 12.8
(b)). In the low-temperature ballistic regime, four-terminal measurement is dominated
by mesoscopic effects [35] and the calculated mean-free path exhibits large variation,
depending on the measurement geometry. The temperature dependence therefore pro-
vides only a lower bound of the mean-free path. The negative resistance observed at
base temperature indicates that electrons travel ballistically across the diagonal of the
square, corresponding to a mean-free path as large as 21 μm in this device. This
corresponds to an electron mobility of approximately 1,000,000 cm2/V s at a carrier
density of e3  1012 cm2.
Figure 12.8(c) shows the mean-free path versus carrier density for devices of varying
sizes. In each case, the mean-free path initially increases with increasing carrier density,
before saturating to a value similar to the device dimension (labeled in the ﬁgure).
In Fig. 12.8(d), the maximum mean-free path is plotted against device size for
devices ranging from 1 to 15 μm. Over this range, the mean-free path scales linearly

with device size. This result indicates that, in the low-temperature limit, mobility is due
to edge scattering, suggesting we have not reached the intrinsic impurity-limited
scattering length. Even higher mobility is therefore expected for larger area devices,
which may be enabled by further progress in scalable growth techniques [36, 37].
12.3.2
Ballistic Transport
The negative resistance measured in the van der Pauw geometry (inset Fig. 12.7(a)) is
one characteristic feature indicative of ballistic transport [19]. A more direct probe is
provided by magnetic focusing. Under application of a transverse magnetic ﬁeld,
electrons in the graphene undergo cyclotron motion with radius determined by the
Lorentz force. A resonant conduction path (measured as a voltage peak) is realized
when

=eL, where the mode number j is the number of half circles between
the electrodes, e is the electron charge, B is the magnetic ﬁeld, L is the distance between
the electron emitter and voltage detector, and n is the charge carrier density [38].
Figure 12.9 shows an example of this measurement for the same device as in
Fig. 12.7. The resonant peaks have perfect ﬁt. Since this measurement requires that
the electrons travel ballistically from source to probe electrodes, the path length of the
corresponding half circle gives a further lower bound on the mean-free path. For the
device geometry depicted here, this corresponds to approximately 23 μm.
12.3.3
Environmental Insensitivity
Figure 12.10 shows four examples of the exceptional protection against environmental
factors afforded by h-BN encapsulation. Figure 12.10(a) shows Raman spectra of
exfoliated graphene on SiO2, transferred to h-BN, and encapsulated between h-BN
ﬂakes. Each sample is examined as fabricated: in air after annealing in Ar/H2 at 400 C
for two hours, and in a vacuum. The encapsulated sample shows no change in the

Raman spectrum from either the annealing process in a vacuum environment, whereas
the SiO2-supported sample shows a large shift in the G peak position and decrease in the
2D peak intensity upon annealing, and the non-encapsulated graphene on h-BN shows a
decrease in 2D peak intensity upon annealing. The position (1582 cm–1) and width
(12 cm–1) of the G peak for the encapsulated sample indicates doping below a level of
1012 cm–2. The encapsulated sample also shows the highest intensity ratio I2D=IG, again
consistent with an absence of environmental doping or scattering. Figures 12.10(b) and
(c) show electrical transfer curves of encapsulated devices after the same annealing
process, and after exposure to oxygen plasma (50 W, 20 s). There is no change in
behavior after annealing and only a small (2 V) shift in the Dirac peak position after
plasma treatment. Finally, Fig. 12.10(d) shows a long-term study of the stability of an
encapsulated device at high bias. In this test, a source–drain voltage of 25 V is applied
to a 5μm long device, inducing a current density of 3:5  108 cm2. At this current
density, the graphene reaches a temperature of 2000 C, and emits bright thermal
radiation in the visible range, as shown. Under a mild vacuum of 105 Torr, the current
is stable within 0.4% over 106 s, such that the estimated lifetime of this light source is
~5 years. A similar device without h-BN encapsulation shows a lifetime of only a few
minutes under similar conditions.
12.3.4
Moiré Superlattice
At the atomic scale, coupling between graphene and h-BN results in a periodic moiré
pattern due to the isomorphic, but slightly mis-matched, crystal lattices. The moiré
wavelength is directly related to the angular rotation between the two lattices [40, 41,
43–46], spanning from approximately 14 nm down to zero between 0 (maximally
aligned) and 30 (maximally misaligned), respectively. STM images of the resulting
superlattice at different relative twist angles are shown in Fig. 12.11(b) [40]. The moiré
pattern acts as a perfectly periodic superlattice potential, superimposed onto the
Fig. 12.9 (a) Transverse magnetic focusing measurement conﬁguration. Solid lines indicate the
trajectory for the ﬁrst and second resonant path paths. (b) Resistance versus gate bias. Resonant
paths are apparent as resistance peaks. Dashed lines correspond to the expected resonant modes
calculated from the sample geometry.

graphene band structure. Moreover, the favorable dielectric characteristics of h-BN
maintain high mobility in the graphene channel. This provides unprecedented access
to a fully tunable superlattice, without the need for lithographic patterning [27, 47].
Figure 12.11(c) shows transport data measured from a device corresponding to near
zero-angle alignment. In addition to the usual resistance peak at the charge neutrality
point (CNP), occurring at gate voltage Vg e 2 V, two additional satellite resistance peaks
appear, symmetrically located at Vsatl e 30 V away from the CNP. These satellite
features are consistent with a depression in the density of states (DOS) at the superlattice
Brillouin zone band edge, analogous to spectroscopic measurements by STM [40, 48].
Assuming non-overlapping bands, Vsatl
j
j, gives an estimate of the moiré wavelength to
be ~14.6 nm, in good agreement with the expected length. The nature of these satellite
peaks can be further probed in the semiclassical, low B-ﬁeld transport regime. In
Fig. 12.11(d), longitudinal resistance, Rxx, and transverse Hall resistance, Rxy, are
plotted versus gate voltage at B ¼ 1 T. Near the central CNP, the Hall resistance
changes sign as the Fermi energy passes from the electron to the hole band. The same
trend also appears near Vsatl, consistent with the Fermi energy passing through a second
band edge. This provides further conﬁrmation that the moiré pattern, acting as a periodic
potential superlattice, gives rise to a mini-Brillouin zone band [49]. The satellite peaks

broaden with increasing temperature, but persist to room temperature (Fig. 3.5(a))
indicating that the coupling between the BLG and h-BN atomic lattices is in excess
of ~30 meV.
The moiré length scale at zero angle proves to be ideal to study the interplay between
the superlattice-induced bloch bands, and magnetic ﬁeld-induced Landau bands, enab-
ling for the ﬁrst time conﬁrmation of the predicted fractal band structure known as the
Hofstadter Butterﬂy [41, 45, 46, 50].
12.3.5
Monolayer Band Gap
The ﬁrst studies of moiré-patterned graphene used the layer-by-layer assembly tech-
nique. We found that by using our vDW assembly technique, in which the graphene/BN
interface remains pristine [20], alignment between the graphene and BN can be
achieved by simple application of heat. Figure 12.12(a) inset shows an example of a
heterostructure that was assembled with random (and unknown) orientation of each
material. After heating the sample to ~350 C, the graphene ﬂake translates and rotates
through several microns, despite being fully encapsulated between two BN sheets. This

behavior has been observed in several devices, in each case resulting in a moiré
wavelength ranging between 1015nm (indicating less than 2 angle mismatch [40]).
We postulate that the thermally induced motion proceeds until the macro-scale graphene
ﬂake ﬁnds a local energy minimum, corresponding to crystallographic alignment with
one of the BN surfaces [51].
Figure 12.12(a) shows transport of a device fabricated with thermally induced
alignment. The three resistance peaks, characteristic of the electronic coupling to a
moiré superlattice [40, 41, 45] are evident. The CNP peak resistance exhibits thermally
activated behavior, and exceeds 100 kΩ at low temperatures, indicating a moiré-
coupling-induced band gap [46, 51, 52]. The gap varies continuously with rotation
angle, consistent with previous studies of non-encapsulated graphene [46]. At zero
angle the energy gap measured by transport is equivalent to the gap energy measured by
previous optical studies [53], providing further indication of the high-quality device
realized by vdW assembly. This represents the ﬁrst demonstration of a band-gap
opening in monolayer graphene, without signiﬁcantly degrading the carrier mobility
in the on state (the mobility of the moiré-patterned graphene shows the same ballistic
transport as the previously discussed devices).
Several groups have reported observation of this band gap in moiré-patterned
graphene [42, 45, 46, 51, 53, 54]; however, there are some inconsistencies between
the studies. Reference [46] ﬁnds that the gap decreases continuously as the twist angle
increases from 0o to 5o, while reference [51] states that in their studies the gap has never
been observed for devices with twist angle larger than 1o. In multiple experiments, it is
reported that the gap is only observed for non-encapsualted graphene [45, 51, 54], with
the gap suppressed when a BN layer is placed on top of the graphene. In contrast, we
routinely observe the existence of a band gap in encapsulated devices fabricated by the
Fig. 12.12 (a) Zero ﬁeld resistance versus gate bias measured in a BN encapsulated graphene
device with a ~10 nm moiré superlattice. Inset is an optical image showing macroscopic motion of

vdW technique [42]. Figure 12.12 summarizes these ﬁndings. The difference in the
sample preparation methods, and variability in device quality may explain why in some
cases a band gap is not observed. Owing to the technological importance of developing
a band gap in monolayer graphene, resolving these discrepancies through further
experimental and theoretical study is highly desirable.
12.4
Beyond Graphene
The mechanical assembly of 2D materials provides several exciting new opportunities
in device design that go beyond the individual properties of the constituent layers. For
example, vertically layered heterostructures can be made by assembling multiple
monolayer graphene crystals seperated by few-layer BN (Fig. 12.13(a)). The BN spacer
thickness precisely determines the coulomb interaction and wave function overlap
between the graphene layers, providing an unprecedented resolution with which to
make vertical superlattices. Tunnel FETs and optoelectronic devices with novel proper-
ties have been demonstrated by additionally controlling the rotational lattice orientation
between the graphene layers [18].
Graphene represents just one of a larger subset of layered van der Waals materials,
including the transition metal dichlcogenides (TMDCs) transition metal oxides (TMOs),
and topological insulators (TIs), each of which can also been exfoliated down to a
monolayer [18]. For the semiconductor TMDCs, we demonstrated that h-BN as an
encapsulating dielctric results in signiﬁcant enhancment in device mobility [55], much
like we observe for graphene devices (Fig. 12.13). In MoS2, mobility of 1,000 to above

10, 000 cm2=V s is achieved utilzing graphene as an improved electrical contact, inte-
grated during the vdW assembly process. This allows a carrier density range of
1012 cm2 to be studied, where strong gate-tunable quantum oscillations are observed
[55]. A number of studies by other groups in related materials such phosphorene and
WSe2 have found similar results with these techniques [57, 58].
Finally, an engineering challenge facing a number of these materials is their sensitiv-
ity to exposure to air. In the case of NbSe2, for example, bulk superconductivity is
supressed in the monolayer limit, owing to rapid oxidation. The vdW assembly tech-
nqiue, however, allows for isolation of monolayer crystals, followed by encapsulation
in h-BN, all within a glove box ﬁlled with nitrogen, such that the monolayer ﬂake is
never exposed to oxygen. By integrating few-layer graphite as electrodes, the NbSe2 is
electrically connected and protected from oxidation in a single step, and superconduct-
ivity is recovered [56] (Fig. 12.13).
The capability to combine 2D crystals into vertically layered structures, represents a
new paradigm in materials engineering, where, instead of atomistic layer-by-layer
growth, we can fabricate heterostructures by mechanical assembly of naturally occur-
ring 2D layers. This process is therefore free of many of the constraints of conventional
MBE techniques. Owing to the wide range of properties associated with the many
available 2D materials, the future of this technique is expected to ﬁnd many applications
in the areas of novel band structure engineering, tunneling devices, tunable optoelec-
tronic response, and hybrid materials for ﬂexible electronics.

13.1
Introduction
Since its debut in 2004 [1], graphene has attracted intense interest because of its
extraordinary properties, such as carrier mobility close to 200,000 cm2/Vs [2, 3], long
ballistic transport distances at room temperature [4], half-integer quantum Hall effect
[5], and broadband light absorption [6]. These unique properties initially raised hopes
for creating breakthroughs in electronics, although it was recognized early on that the
gapless nature of graphene means it is not going to replace silicon electronics anytime
soon. However, graphene still holds great promise for applications such as RF transis-
tors, sensors, nanocomposites, and super-capacitors. To realize the potential applica-
tions of graphene in these technologies, the scalable synthesis of graphene is of
considerable importance. In the past decade, many graphene fabrication methods have
been developed (Fig. 13.1) [7]. Although the mechanical exfoliation of highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite has initiated the discovery of graphene and remains the best method
to date for studying the physical properties of graphene, it is not a viable method to
produce uniform graphene in sizeable amounts due to its poor reproducibility [8–11].
The epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC substrates holds promise for the develop-
ment of certain graphene-based applications in electronics and optics. Its transfer-free
process avoids the effect of residues on the devices. Over the past few years, Walter
A. de Heer’s group has intensively explored the growth and applications of graphene
and other two-dimensional (2D) materials using the epitaxial growth method [12–15].
Recently, they reported exceptional ballistic transport in epitaxial graphene nanoribbons
[16]. It should be noted that the epitaxial method has drawn considerable interest also in
the growth of other 2D materials such as silicene [17, 18], germanene [19, 20], and
stanene [21]. However, the epitaxial method is restricted to speciﬁc substrates with
lattice-matched properties, and at present it cannot be readily extended to the industri-
ally important silicon platform.
Inspired by mechanical exfoliation, a liquid-phase exfoliation approach has also been
developed to generate solution-processible graphene [22–25]. Multilayer graphene
ﬂakes can be obtained on a large scale, and the most effective exfoliation methods
generally used strong acid and base as the oxidation and reduction agents. Given the

destructive process inherent in sonication-assisted exfoliation, the as-synthesized
samples are not very uniform, as the size and layer-number are difﬁcult to control
[26]. Analysis of commercial liquid-phase exfoliated graphene revealed that the
purveyed products contained a signiﬁcant amount of graphite.
It is difﬁcult to achieve precise control over graphene’s size, layer number, and
morphology using mechanical or solution-based exfoliation methods. To make high-
quality, thickness-controllable graphene, which is industrially compatible with regards
to either wafer-scale process or roll-to-roll process on metal foil, chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) has emerged as the most effective way to advance the industrial
development of graphene.
13.2
CVD Method for Graphene Growth
13.2.1
CVD Process
It should be noted that the CVD method is a very well-established method in the growth
of carbon thin ﬁlm and layered materials [27–29]. A typical CVD system usually has
several components, such as a heating furnace, a gas introduction system, and a reaction
chamber [30]. The chemistry of graphene growth is straightforward. The carbon source,
usually some carbon-containing hydrocarbon, decompose into carbon clusters on the
metal catalyst substrates, followed by diffusion–aggregation of these clusters to form
graphene. The complexity lies in how to control the layer uniformity, and how to attain
single-crystal domain over macroscopically large areas.

13.2 CVD Method for Graphene Growth

14 Aug 2017 at 14:50:01, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

During the common CVD process for graphene growth, substrate temperature,
catalysts, carbon source, and gas ratios are all of considerable importance, and differing
growth conditions can lead to considerable differences among the as-grown samples.
Among various crucial factors in the CVD process, the metal catalysts have the greatest
inﬂuence on the as-grown graphene sample, as different catalytic systems can result in
completely different growth modes for graphene and other 2D materials.
Recent advances in graphene growth using the CVD method have shown that almost
all of the transition metals listed in the periodic table can be used as catalysts for graphene
growth [31–37]. Depending on the solubility of carbon in different metals and the strength
of metal–carbon bonding, different metal catalysts produced graphene ﬁlms of different
thicknesses and crystalline quality. Rational approaches have been applied for the engin-
eering of metal catalyst layers. Among the various metals, Ni and Cu command the most
interest for the preparation of uniform, high-quality graphene. Ni-catalyzed, few- or multi-
layer graphene can be used in stretchable transparent electrodes where the thickness of
graphene is needed to ensure sufﬁcient conductivity [38, 39]. In turn, monolayer graphene
ﬁlm grown on Cu is better suited for use in high-mobility ﬁeld-effect transistors [40].
Metal Ni foil was ﬁrst introduced for CVD graphene growth in 2008 [38], earlier than
the introduction of metal Cu. However, the non-uniform, few-layer characteristics of the
as-grown graphene result in comparatively poor electrical performance compared to
exfoliated single-layer graphene. Cu was later introduced for the growth of monolayer
graphene [40]. Given its ultra-low carbon solubility, a surface catalyzed, self-limiting
process can be used to form uniform, monolayer graphene over the whole Cu surface
(Fig. 13.2). It was soon realized that by alloying fractions of Ni (~10%) in the Cu

substrate, the controlled growth of graphene with different layer numbers can be
achieved because of the higher solubility of carbon in Ni [41]. The ratio of Cu and Ni
in the alloy catalyst determines the diffusion and precipitation of the carbon in the bulk
and on the surface, thus allowing some control over the growth of graphene of different
thicknesses. There are ongoing efforts to make bilayer graphene using this approach, by
increasing the fraction of nickel to ~20%.
13.2.2
Solid Metals for Use in Graphene Crystal Growth
Controlling the Size of Graphene Crystals
CVD graphene ﬁlm is generally polycrystalline and displays electronic properties inferior
to the exfoliated counterpart due to the presence of grain boundaries (GBs), whichare major
sources of intervalley scattering [42]. Thus, the fabrication of single-crystal graphene
without structural defects becomes the obvious goal. There are two ways to produce
single-crystal graphene: growth from only one nuclei by lateral expansion on the substrate,
or growth of a single-crystal domain from the seamless merging of numerous nuclei with
aligned orientation. Both approaches have been applied with various degrees of success in
the synthesis of single-crystal graphene. In the ﬁrst approach, the ﬁrst step is to reduce the
number of nucleation sites (Fig.13.3(a)). This can be achieved by a number of methods,
such as using annealed copper foil at high temperatures [43, 44], preoxidized copper
[45, 46], or polished copper foil [47]. It can be appreciated that growth from a single nuclei
may require a long growth time, although the recent breakthrough by Xie suggests that the
kinetic limit can be overcome [48]. Alternatively, the stitching of numerous epitaxially
aligned graphene grains has the potential to yield uniform, single-crystal graphene ﬁlm, in a
much shorter time compared to growth from a single nuclei (Fig. 13.3(b)).
In the single nucleus approach, the key point is the suppression of nucleation density.
Ideally, the growth proceeds from only a single seed, thus avoiding grain boundaries.
Surface design of the catalytic substrate is shown to be an effective approach for
obtaining single-domain growth. The nucleation density of graphene depends on the
carbon supply for graphene growth and the active sites for graphene nucleation.
Diluting the carbon source proves effective in reducing the number of active sites but
may take too long to produce large-sized crystals if the same condition is kept
throughout. On the other hand, passivating active sites which have low-energy barriers
for nucleation, including atomic steps, grain boundaries, and point defects on the Cu
foil, has emerged as a good strategy to control nucleation density. The use of melamine
to passivate active sites has been demonstrated as a facile surface engineering method to
grow large single-crystalline monolayers which exhibit ultra-high carrier mobilities
exceeding 25,000 cm2 V–1 s–1 [50]. Oxidizing the Cu surface to form copper oxide
also substantially decreases the graphene nucleation density by passivating the surface
active sites [51]; this has now been actively pursued as a method for the growth of
centimeter-scale, single-crystal graphene domains (Figs. 13.4(a) and (b)).
Alternatively, restricting the delivery of growth ﬂux spatially to a single point was
demonstrated to allow a single nucleus to evolve into a monolayer at a fast rate [48]. By
locally feeding carbon precursors to a desired position on a substrate composed of

optimized Cu–Ni alloy catalyst, a ~1.5-inch-large graphene monolayer was synthesized
in 2.5 hours (Figs. 13.4(c) and (d)). Such localized feeding restricts the nucleation zone
spatially, and the optimized alloy activates an isothermal segregation mechanism that
considerably increases the growth rate.

Eres and co-workers [52] proposed a new framework for optimizing the growth of
large-area single-crystal graphene. Using a kinetic model, they show that at very low
nucleation densities, carbon incorporation occurs by a cooperative island growth mech-
anism. In order to suppress the nucleation density of graphene, the reactant is cooled
transiently by an argon pulse to produce collisional deactivation of the active carbon
growth species. This direct intervention of the growth process was found to suppress the
nucleation completely. After the argon pulse, the carbon supersaturation was increased
(by increasing CH4 ﬂow rate) so that the lateral growth rate, due to the addition of
carbon monomers to the edges of existing graphene seeds, could be boosted. The
change in growth mechanism from random nucleation to cooperative island growth
leads to three orders of magnitude increase in the reactive sticking probability of
methane, thus the growth rate of large size single crystal graphene increases rapidly
after an induction period (Fig. 13.5).
The multiple nuclei approach to the growth of large-scale, single-crystal graphene
ﬁlm is based on the premise of having all the graphene nuclei oriented in the same
direction to facilitate seamless merging of the growing grains when they meet. None-
theless, the question of whether the presence of aligned grains will ensure the absence of
all types of grain boundaries is not certain, since translational dislocation can occur even
between two parallel hexagons when they impinge, or twin boundaries can occur due to
defects on the substrate. It is not easy to observe such grain boundaries with conven-
tional laboratory microscopy techniques, an aberration corrected transmission electron
microscopy technique, or a scanning tunneling microscopy technique, is usually needed
to identify grain boundaries of very narrow width.
To attain alignment of the grains, a growth substrate with an heteroepitaxial relation-
ship to graphene is needed. Based on this concept, the growth of wafer-scale, mono-
layer, single-crystal graphene ﬁlm has been realized on a hydrogen-terminated
germanium buffer layer of H-terminated Ge (110) crystals (Figs. 13.6(a)–(c)) [49].
The anisotropic, two-fold symmetry of the germanium (110) surface allows the unidir-
ectional alignment of multiple seeds, which were merged to create uniform single-
crystal graphene. Furthermore, the weak interaction between the graphene and the

underlying hydrogen-terminated germanium surface enables the facile etch-free dry
transfer of graphene and the recycling of the germanium substrate. However, the
formation of defects or impurities on the Ge (110) surface makes it difﬁcult to synthe-
size graphene with a high uniformity and reproducibility.
Compared to the H-terminated Ge (110) substrate, the Cu (111) substrate has a
hexagonal symmetry (surface nearest-neighbor distance of 0.255 nm) which is lattice
matched to graphene (lattice constant of 0.246 nm). In addition, Cu foils are compatible
with the industrial roll-to-roll process, thus growers are now developing recipes to make
highly textured Cu (111) foil for the heteroepitaxial growth of graphene [53]. Using the
concept of seamless stitching, Nguyen and co-workers demonstrated the growth of 6 cm
 3 cm monocrystalline graphene without grain boundaries on polished copper (111)
foil (Figs. 13.6(d)–(f)) [53]. Other than Cu foil, the lattice matching between Cu and
c-plane sapphire allows highly textured Cu (111) ﬁlm to be grown on sapphire, thus
allowing wafer-scale single crystalline graphene to be grown in principle on a Cu (111)
ﬁlm-coated substrate [54]. One question is this: using growth strategy involving the
“merging of grains,” how small can the graphene domains (or grain size) be before
rotational disorder sets in to make a “mosaic” nanocrystalline graphene. On the
(111)-textured Cu ﬁlm on sapphire, Nai et al. [55] investigated the spectroscopic
signatures of graphene ﬁlm containing highly oriented grains with sizes varying from
20 nm to 150 nm using Angle-resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and
High-Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS) [55]. The robustness
of graphene’s Dirac Cone, as well as dispersion of its phonons, as a function of
graphene’s grain size was investigated. At the Κ point, well-deﬁned conical Dirac
dispersion can be seen for the nanocrystalline graphene ﬁlms due to the fact that the
majority of the nanosized graphene grains are aligned with the substrate. Not surpris-
ingly, the bands in the Dirac cone are sharpest for ﬁlms with ~150 nm grains and become

diffused for ﬁlms with smaller grain sizes. Although such nanocrystalline graphene ﬁlms
exhibit the spectroscopic ﬁngerprints of near-single crystalline graphene, especially
when the grains are larger than 100 nm, the presence of grain boundaries modify the
electronic properties of these ﬁlms, for example, making them n-doped in the vacuum.
Due to the reactive nature of grain boundaries, adsorbates such as water and oxygen
molecules, which adsorb preferentially on the grain boundaries, often impose a p-doping
offset on graphene ﬁlm. These ﬂuctuations in doping shifted the position of the Dirac
point from charge neutrality, and its position is highly sensitive to the environment or
heating, which makes device fabrication difﬁcult to control. It can be expected that for a
single crystalline graphene ﬁlm with no grain boundaries (or at least very low density of
grain boundaries), the graphene ﬁlm will be highly stable and the Dirac point should
remain close to the charge neutrality point. Thus a good yardstick of a single crystalline
graphene ﬁlm with low density of grain boundaries can be the electronic stability of the
ﬁlm in terms of its Dirac point, besides exhibiting very high mobility.
The approach in which commensurate stitching on the Cu (111) surface is used to
realize large-area mono-crystal graphene can also be applied to the growth of other
layered materials, such as hexagonal boron nitride and transition metal dichalcogenides.
Controlling the Shape of Graphene Crystals
The hexagonal shape has been considered to be the most thermodynamically stable
morphology of graphene due to its highly symmetrical structures. Warner et al. ﬁrst
reported the growth of hexagonal, few-layer, single-crystal graphene on solid Cu foils
using ambient pressure CVD, as shown in Fig. 13.7(a) [56]. Transmission electron
microscopy and Raman spectrum measurements conﬁrmed that the as-grown, few-layer
graphene mainly comprised approximately 5–10 layers. The selected area electron
diffraction of individual crystals suggested that they were single crystals with AB Bernal
stacking. It should be noted that the size of the hexagonal graphene crystals was only
2–5 μm. The work has stimulated [56] considerable follow up work on the preparation of
hexagonal single-crystal graphene.
Almost simultaneously, Yu et al. systematically studied single-crystal graphene growth
and showed how the individual grain boundaries between coalescing grains affected
graphene’s electronic properties [42]. The edge types and layer numbers of as-grown
hexagonal graphene were determined by scanning tunneling microscopy and Raman
spectroscopy, in which zig-zag edge types and single-layer properties of the graphene
was conﬁrmed, respectively. Notably, in this work, a novel approach was developed to
precisely control graphene nucleation using pre-patterned growth seeds. Figure 13.7(b)
clearly shows that the pre-seed method leads to well-aligned hexagonal grains.
Liu’s group reported the large-scale growth of equiangular or hexagonal single-
crystal graphene on solid Cu foil [57] and fully investigated the effects of the growth
parameters, such as temperature, carbon source ﬂow rate, and growth time, on single-
crystal graphene growth, as shown in Figs. 13.7(c) and (d). A qualitative model for
hexagonal graphene growth was proposed by combining experimental results and
classical nucleation theory. A critical carbon concentration for graphene nucleation
was deﬁned, and then the graphene growth stage was studied under varied conditions.

Apart from the typical hexagonal shape, other graphene crystal shapes have also drawn
intensive interest. Liu grew graphene on cube-textured (100)-oriented Cu (CTO-Cu) foils
using CVD [58]. Well-aligned, triangular grains up to several micrometers in size were
ﬁrst self-assembled on CTO-Cu during CVD heating in ﬂowing hydrogen. This work
also demonstrated that the shape and possible alignment of the graphene grains can be
tuned by changing the properties of the substrate.

such as grain boundaries or defects, resulting in graphene grains of inhomogeneous
sizes, and overall difﬁculty in controlling the nucleation density.
Solid Cu foils change into a liquid phase when the growth temperature is higher than
the melting point of Cu (1084 C). The introduction of liquid Cu [59–61] provides a
particularly effective way to control graphene nuclei, given its complete elimination of
grain boundaries on solid Cu foils. Due to the high uniformity of the liquid Cu surface,
submillimeter-sized, large-area hexagonal graphene grains (HGFs) could be grown.
Considering the ﬂuidity of liquid Cu, Geng et al. used Mo and W foils as supporting
substrates for their good wettability with liquid Cu [59, 60]. Remarkably, uniform
monolayer graphene ﬂakes and ﬁlms were prepared on liquid Cu (Fig. 13.8). The size
of the hexagonal graphene domains was on average 100 μm, reﬂecting an advancement
in the growth of highly uniformed large-sized graphene. Numerous reasons have been
proposed to explain liquid Cu’s success in growing large-sized single-crystal graphene.
It is speculated that the liquid phase of Cu allows dynamic restructuring of carbon atoms
during crystallization, and largely eliminates the grain boundaries present on a solid Cu
surface. It is known that the absence of grain boundaries leads to decreased graphene
nucleation and larger graphene crystals.

A study led by Warner also reported the use of molten Cu in fabricating large-scale,
single-crystal graphene [61]. By controlling the amount of H2 present during the growth
process, the size of individual graphene crystals grown could reach 200 μm, demon-
strating the considerable potential of molten Cu in the growth of large-sized, single-
crystal graphene. Mohsin et al. synthesized millimeter-sized, hexagonal-shaped, single-
crystal graphene on re-solidiﬁed Cu foils [62]. A solid Cu foil was ﬁrst melted and then
re-solidiﬁed by lowering the temperature. The in-situ processing approach produced a
relatively smooth surface that resulted in low graphene nucleation density, enabling the
growth of millimeter-sized, single-crystal graphene. Liquid Cu CVD methods are
usually operated under ambient conditions, exhibiting signiﬁcant advantages in scaling
up graphene production.
It has also been shown that the morphology of single-crystal graphene can be
precisely tailored using a liquid Cu surface. Snowﬂake-like graphene crystals
(Fig. 13.9(a)) were grown on liquid Cu surfaces [63], and the manipulation of the Ar:
H2 ﬂow rate ratio resulted in the evolution of these graphene ﬂake (GF) shapes. A series
of SEM images of typical GFs grown on liquid Cu surfaces under various ﬂow rate
ratios of Ar:H2 was obtained (Fig. 13.9(b)–(l)). Using higher ratios of Ar:H2 resulted in
the formation of GFs with symmetric dendritic structures. As the Ar:H2 ratio decreased,
more compact structures appeared until eventually regular hexagonal GFs with straight
edges were obtained. Using pure H2 led to a slight deviation in the perfect hexagonal
structures to produce edges with positive curvatures.

Using liquid brass (30% Zn and 70% Cu) as a catalyst in the approach previously
described allowed further ﬁne manipulation of GF morphologies, reﬂecting the possi-
bility of ﬁne-tuning GF morphology (Fig. 13.10). For example, when the Ar:H2 ratio
was low, the GFs assumed a compact hexagonal shape. As the Ar:H2 ratio increased, the
vertices of the hexagonal GF crystals became distorted, producing increasingly more
concave polyhedral structures. Further increasing this ratio led to the formation of
ﬂower-like GFs, similar to the case in which pure Cu was used. To explain the shape
evolution of GFs, a diffusion-limited growth mechanism was proposed. The competi-
tion between ad-atom diffusion along island edges and ad-atom surface diffusion
determines the morphologies of GFs. A geometrically well-deﬁned graphene island is
formed when an ad-atom relaxes sufﬁciently to ﬁnd an energetically favorable location
along island edges or corners; in the absence of such relaxation, diffusion-limited
growth leads to dendritic structures.
Liquid Ga
In addition to liquid Cu, liquid Ga has also been used as a catalyst to fabricate high-
quality graphene. Ga is carbon-insoluble, but it is an excellent absorber of carbon, which
gives it the potential to act as a good surface catalyst for graphene growth. Jiang’s group
studied several molten metals and their alloys for use in graphene growth [64], and liquid
Ga exhibits a highly effective catalytic ability. Graphene with a controlled layer number
and quality level was prepared on liquid Ga over the course of a few minutes by
APCVD. It should be noted that the as-grown graphene was mainly few-layer.
Fu et al. further improved CVD growth conditions on liquid Ga, and then prepared
uniform, monolayer graphene ﬁlm and hexagonal single-crystal graphene [65].
The carrier mobility of the as-grown graphene crystals reached a high value of
7400 cm2 V–1 s–1, demonstrating liquid metal’s signiﬁcant potential in growing high-
quality graphene. The remarkably high mobility originates from Ga’s characteristics,
including low vapor pressure at elevated temperatures, resulting in a homogeneous

surface and low nucleation density (Fig. 13.11). The density was as low as 1/1000 μm2,
compared with graphene grown on solid polycrystalline Ga (1/100 μm2). The growth of
homogeneous monolayer graphene was attributed to the self-terminating process caused
by the high surface energy of liquid Ga. To lower its surface energy, Ga absorbs carbon
atoms or clusters on its surface. During growth, the surface-bound carbon species nucleate
and form a graphene ﬁlm. Once the surface of Ga is fully covered by graphene, additional
carbon atoms are blocked from absorbing on the Ga surface, thus limiting the growth.
13.3
Prospects
This chapter presents the controlled growth of graphene crystals on metal catalysts by
CVD. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in the last few years for the growth of large-
area single crystalline graphene, and it is highly plausible that in the near future the size
of such single crystalline graphene is limited only by the size of the polished copper foil
it is grown on. Two distinct approaches to the growth of single crystalline graphene may
converge to allow better control of large-area single crystalline graphene growth. First,
polishing the copper foil to obtain a crystallographic textured (111) surface provides an
epitaxial substrate for the growth of aligned graphene grains, which can merge seam-
lessly to produce single crystalline graphene. Next, passivating defects on copper foil to
reduce nucleation density allows the growth of much bigger crystalline graphene
domains. Future efforts are directed at engineering alloy catalyst based on Ni/Cu to
allow the controlled growth of bilayer graphene, which have many interesting properties
distinct from monolayer graphene.

Compared with the use of solid metals in growing graphene, the use of liquid metals
(particularly liquid Cu and Ga) as a catalytic substrate is intriguing as it provides a
defect-free surface for the synthesis of large graphene crystals. Large-sized graphene
crystals have been successfully synthesized on liquid Cu and Ga using the CVD
approach, with excellent tolerance to variations in the growth conditions. However, it
is still challenging to make uniform graphene with different layer numbers. A better
understanding of the growth mechanisms on various liquid metals is needed. The
shortcomings of the liquid metal approach include the much higher temperature needed
compared to solid metal CVD, as well as the difﬁculty in attaining wafer-scale growth.
This means that industrialization will be highly challenging.
Finally it should also be noted that notwithstanding the rapid progress made in the
CVD growth of graphene, there is still room for improvement for the current transfer
method of graphene; wet etching or electrochemical bubbling methods usually intro-
duce residues or breakages, compromising the intrinsic properties of graphene. High-
ﬁdelity transfer or direct growth of high-quality graphene ﬁlms on arbitrary substrates is
needed to enable wide-ranging applications in photonics or electronics, which includes
devices such as optoelectronic modulators, transistors, on-chip biosensors, and tunnel-
ing barriers. The direct growth of graphene ﬁlm on an insulating substrate, such as a
SiO2/Si wafer, would be useful for this purpose to enable many applications on the
silicon wafer. Recently, Libo Gao et al. developed a face-to-face transfer method for
wafer-scale graphene ﬁlms that accomplished both the growth and transfer steps on one
wafer [66]. This spontaneous transfer method relies on nascent gas bubbles and
capillary bridges between the graphene ﬁlm and the underlying substrate during etching
of the metal catalyst. In contrast to the previous wet or dry transfer results, the face-to-
face transfer is non-hand-crafted and is compatible with any size and shape of substrate;
this approach also enjoys the beneﬁt of a much reduced density of transfer defects
compared with the conventional transfer method. Most importantly, the direct growth
and spontaneous attachment of graphene on the underlying substrate is amenable to
batch processing in a semiconductor production line, and thus will speed up the
technological application of graphene. Thus combining methods to grow large-area
single-crystal graphene on copper-coated silicon followed by a face-to-face transfer
method, may open up direct deposition of single-crystal graphene on silicon.

Electronic Properties and Strain
Engineering in Semiconducting
Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Rafael Roldán and Francisco Guinea
14.1
Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) form a new family of layered two-dimensional
materials that, as graphene, can be easily exfoliated and present promising electrical and
optical properties [1]. Among them, semiconducting TMD are of special interest
because they present a gap in the optical range of the energy spectrum that makes them
candidates for device applications [2–4].
It has been demonstrated experimentally [6–9] that the band structure of those
compounds dramatically changes from single-layer to multi-layer samples, involving
a transition from an indirect gap for multi-layer samples to a direct gap for single-layer
samples [5], pointing out the important role of interlayer hopping of carriers in these
compounds [10]. Furthermore, their electronic properties are highly sensitive to external
conditions, such as strain, pressure, or temperature. For instance, a semiconducting/
metal transition can be induced under speciﬁc conditions [11–23]. Such possibility to
tune the gap is very interesting for applications in optoelectronic nanodevices [2].
Semiconducting TMDs present a strong spin–orbit interaction, that lifts the spin
degeneracy of the energy bands in single-layer samples due to the absence of inversion
symmetry [24]. Since time reversal symmetry must be conserved, the spin splitting in
inequivalent valleys must be opposite, leading to the so-called spin–valley coupling
[25–27], which has been observed experimentally [28–33]. The coupling of the spin, the
valley, and the layer degrees of freedom in semiconducting TMDs opens up the
possibility to manipulate them for future applications in spintronics and valleytronics
nanodevices [25, 28–31, 34–36].
Another of the fascinating properties of the two-dimensional TMDs is their high
stretchability and the possibility to use external strain to manipulate their electronic and
optical properties [37]. Strain engineering – which involves the study of how the
physical properties of materials can be modiﬁed by controlling the external strain ﬁelds
applied to them – has a perfect platform for its implementation in two-dimensional
semiconducting TMDs. Non-uniform strain proﬁles can be used to create a funnel of
excitons, which allows to capture a broad range of the solar spectrum, concentrating
carriers in a small region of the samples [11]. Strain engineering can be also used to
exploit the piezoelectric properties of atomically thin layers of TMDs, converting
mechanical to electrical energy. Molybdenum disulphide, a material which is not

piezoelectric in its bulk conﬁguration, has been shown to become piezoelectric when its
thickness is reduced to a single atomic layer (or to an odd number of them) [38].
In this chapter, we describe the electronic properties of 2D semiconducting transition
metal dichalcogenides. The corresponding band structure is analyzed in terms of density
function theory (DFT) calculations. This information will be used to develop a tight-
binding model that contains the relevant orbital contribution to account for the valence
and conduction bands. Finally, we will see how the band structure can be modiﬁed by
means of externally applied strain to the samples.

Electronic Structure
The lattice structure of single and multilayer MX2 (where M ¼ M0, W and X ¼ S, Se) is
schematically shown in Fig. 14.1. The crystal has an inner layer of metal M atoms
ordered on a triangular lattice, which is sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen X
atoms located on the triangular net of alternating hollow sites. We denote a as the
distance between nearest-neighbor in-plane MM and XX atoms, b as the nearest-
neighbor MX distance and u as the separation between the M and X planes. Therefore,
the MX2 crystal constitutes an almost perfect trigonal prism structure with b ’

Q valleys that correspond to the minimum of the conduction band for multi-layer
samples are also shown.
In the following, we study the electronic band structure of single-layer, multi-layer,
and bulk TMDs. For this purpose, we use relativistic Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations, in which the intrinsic spin–orbit interaction term for all atoms is
included. Figure 14.3 shows the band structures for single-layer, bilayer, and bulk
MX2. The most important features of the band structures, such as the band gaps and
the energy splitting of the valence and conduction bands at different points of the BZ
(due to spin–orbit interaction), are summarized in Table 14.2. Contrary to what
happens in other 2D crystals, such as graphene or phosphorene, the valence and
conduction bands of TMDs present a very rich orbital contribution. They are made
by hybridization of the d orbitals of the transition metal atom M, and the p orbitals of
the chalcogen atom X. In particular, the analysis of the orbital contribution for the
block of bands containing the ﬁrst four conduction bands and the ﬁrst seven valence
bands, in an energy window from –7 to 5 eV around the Fermi level, reveals that
these bands are mainly constituted by the ﬁve 4d orbitals of the metal M and the six

(three for each layer) 3p orbitals of the chalcogen X, which sum up to 93% of the total
orbital weight of these bands [5]. All the single-layer compounds are direct gap
semiconductors, with the gap lying at the two inequivalent K and Kʹ points of the
hexagonal Brillouin zone, as shown in Fig. 14.3(a). The most relevant orbital contri-
bution at the edge of the valence band at the K point riginated from a combination of
dx2y2 and dxy orbitals of the metal M, which hybridize with px and py orbitals of the
chalcogen atoms X [5]. The edge of the conduction band, on the other hand, has a
main contribution due to d3z2r2 of M, plus a minor contribution of px and py orbitals
of X. Multi-layer samples are, on the other hand, indirect gap semiconductors. The
maximum of the valence band is placed at the Γ point of the BZ (see Figs. 14.3(b) and

(c)), with a major contribution from d3z2r2 and pz orbitals of the metal and chalcogen
atoms, respectively. The edge of the conduction band in multi-layer samples is at the
Q point of the BZ (indicated by a dashed vertical line in Fig. 14.3). The Q point is not a
high-symmetry point of the Brillouin zone, and therefore the minima of the conduction
band for bilayer and bulk materials do not lie exactly at the same point as for single-
layer samples. The orbital character at this point originates mainly from the dxy and
dx2y2 orbitals of the metal M, and px and py of the chalcogen X, plus a non-negligible
contribution of pz and d3z2r2 of X and M atoms, respectively. This extremely rich
orbital contribution to the relevant bands that occur in semiconducting TMDs makes
the construction of a minimum tight-binding model, valid in the whole Brillouin zone,
a cumbersome task, as we will see in the next section.
Another characteristic of these compounds is the strong spin–orbit coupling, which
leads to a large splitting of the valence band at the K and Kʹ points of the BZ. Since
spin–orbit interaction is stronger for heavier atoms, the splitting of the valence band for
MoX2 (see top panels of Fig. 14.3) is smaller than the splitting of WX2 bands (bottom
panels of Fig. 14.3). For the Mo compounds, the splitting is of the order of ~150 meV,
whereas for the heavier W compounds increases up to ~400 meV. Spin–orbit interaction
also leads to a splitting of the conduction band at the K point, as well as at the secondary
minimum Q. DFT calculations yield splittings between 3 and 30 meV of the minimum
of the conduction band at the K point. In contrast to the valence band (where the
splitting is due to the d orbitals of the metal), both atoms give comparable contributions
to the conduction band splittings at the K point of the BZ.
An interesting aspect of the TMDs is the appearance of a superconducting transition
with a critical temperature that strongly depends on the carrier density. A superconduct-
ing dome, similar to that observed for the layered cuprate compounds, has been experi-
mentally observed in the temperature-carrier density phase diagram of MoS2 [43–46].
The samples, which were doped by a combination of liquid and solid gating, showed a
critical temperature of Tc  10:8 K for the optimal doping n  1:2  1014 cm2. From
the theoretical point of view, the origin of superconductivity in heavily doped MoS2 has
been studied, by considering the role of both electron–electron and electron–phonon
interactions in [47]. The estimations for the strength of the different contributions to the
effective coupling suggest that superconductivity in MoS2, under the experimental
conditions of [43] and [44], is likely to be induced by the electron–electron interaction.
The short-range repulsion between carriers at the conduction band allows for a
superconducting phase induced by the electron–electron interaction with a non-trivial
structure, where the gap acquires opposite signs in the inequivalent pockets of the
conduction band. Functional renormalization group studies suggest that the triplet
pairing is driven by ferromagnetic ﬂuctuations [48]. The multi-orbital nature of the
conduction band, as well as Hund’s coupling, seems to play an essential role in the
physics of MoS2. On the other hand, DFT calculations for the phase diagram of TMDs
suggest that phonon mediated superconductivity is also possible for some range of
electron doping. A charge-density wave phase is also proposed to exist for higher carrier
concentrations [49]. It has also been suggested that spin-triplet p-wave superconduct-
ivity can be stabilized by Rashba spin–orbit coupling [50].

From Density Functional Theory to Tight-Binding Approximation
The low-energy physics of monolayer MoS2 was ﬁrst described in terms of a massive
Dirac Hamiltonian around the K and Kʹ points [25]. More accurate approximations
such as kp approximations [51, 52] that account for the presence of trigonal warping
and diagonal quadratic terms in momentum, as well as tight-binding approximations
[5, 40, 51], were developed later. As we have seen in the previous section, monolayer
TMDs are direct band-gap semiconductors with the gap placed at the K and Kʹ points of
the Brillouin zone. First-principle calculations show that there are two additional
secondary extrema: a local minimum of the conduction band at the Q point, midway
between the Γ and K point, and a local maximum of the valence band at the Γ point [53].
These local extrema present in the band structure of single-layer compounds, become
absolute extrema in multi-layer samples, for which the minimum of the conduction band
is at Q, and the maximum of the valence band is at Γ (see Fig. 14.3). A tight-binding
model that aims to be useful for the valence and conduction band in the whole Brillouin
zone must capture these features, and this will be the focus of the present section.
Furthermore, the orbital content of such a tight-binding model must be appropriate so as
to capture the rich orbital contribution that presents the relevant bands above and below
the energy gap.
The main features of the band structure of TMDs in the whole Brillouin zone,
described in the previous section based on ﬁrst-principle calculations, can be captured
by a Slater–Koster tight-binding model that includes 11 bands. These bands corres-
ponds to the ﬁve d orbitals of the metal M atom and to the six p orbitals of the two
chalcogen X atoms in the unit cell, and the base can be expressed as

(14.1)
where the labels t and b refer to the top and bottom chalcogen planes, respectively.
Following the standard Slater–Koster description [54], the model is deﬁned by the
hopping integrals between the different orbitals, described in terms of σ, π, and δ ligands.
The details of the model can be found in [5, 27]; here we just reproduce the most
important results. The hopping processes of the relevant pairs of neighbors are described
in terms of the Slater–Koster parameters, namely Vpdσ and Vpdπ for MX bonds, Vddσ,
Vddπ and Vddδ for MM bonds, and Vppσ and Vppπ for XX bonds. Additional param-
eters of the theory are the crystal ﬁelds ϵ0, ϵ1, ϵ2, ϵp, and ϵz, describing, respectively, the

M orbitals, the in-
plane (px, py) X orbitals, and the out-of-plane pz X orbitals.
In spite of the large Hilbert space considered in this model, a simpliﬁcation is
possible. By performing an unitary transformation that transforms the p orbitals of the
top and bottom X layers into their symmetric and antisymmetric combinations with
respect to the z-axis, the 11-band model can be decoupled into a six bands block with
even symmetry with respect to z ! z inversion, and a ﬁve bands block with odd
symmetry. Since low-energy excitations belong exclusively to the ﬁrst block, the
relevant bands above and below the gap can be considered by the reduced Hilbert space

systems with arbitrary stacking orders. The advantage of the present tight-binding
description with respect to ﬁrst-principles calculations is that it provides a simple
starting point for the further inclusion of many-body electron–electron interaction
effects by means of quantum ﬁeld theory techniques, as well as of the dynamical effects
of the electron–lattice interaction. Tight-binding approaches are often more convenient
than ab initio methods for investigating systems involving a very large number of atoms
[23], disordered and inhomogeneous samples [56], and materials nanostructured in
large scales (nanoribbons, ripples) or in twisted multilayer materials. In the next section,
we will explain how to apply the method to strained samples.
14.4
Including Strain in the Tight-Binding Hamiltonian
The use of the above Slater–Koster tight-binding approach is particularly convenient
when considering lattice deformations, such as those produced by external strain. If one
neglects as a ﬁrst approximation the corrections to the local atomic potentials due to
Fig. 14.5 Tight-binding band structure of single-layer MoS2 (thick black lines) compared with
DFT result (thin gray lines). The Slater–Koster parameters are given in Table 14.4.

lattice deformation [57, 58], the effect of strain in the sample is driven by the depend-
ence of the tight-binding parameters on the two-center energy integral elements, which
depend on the interatomic distance. At leading order, the modiﬁed hopping terms in the
presence of strain can be written as [23, 55, 59, 60]

A microscopical estimation of the electron–lattice coupling parameters Λij,μv is in
principle possible by means of an accurate analysis based on the direct comparison
between ab initio and tight-binding calculations. For instance, the electron–phonon
coupling associated with the different interlayer hopping amplitudes in multilayer gra-
phene was estimated in [61]. However, this is a formidable task in transition metal
dichalcogenides because of the large number of orbitals/bands that are involved, and
because of the lack of a Fermi surface that can be used as a reference. In the absence of any
experimental and theoretical estimation for the electron–phonon coupling, it is common to
use the Wills–Harrison argument [62], which states that tij,μv rð Þ / rj j lμþlvþ1
ð
Þ, where lμ
is the absolute value of the angular momentum of the orbital μ, and lν is the absolute value
of the angular momentum of the orbital v. Following this approximation, it can be assumed
that the coupling between p orbitals of the chalcogen is Λij,XX  3, the coupling between
p orbital of the chalcogen and d orbital of the metal is Λij,MX  4, and the coupling
between d orbitals of the metal is Λij,MM  5.
This model can be used to simulate the effect of non-uniform strain in the electronic
band structure of realistic ribbons of TMDs subject to external deformations. By
considering a one-dimensional proﬁle along the y-axis of the strain tensor, and assuming
a sinusoidal proﬁle of strain, the deformations along the armchair direction can be
described by the strain tensor

but other distributions of the strain along the sample, such as Lorentzian distribution,
Gaussian distribution, etc., can be considered with this model. Panel (a) corresponds
to the band structure for the case of an unstrained ribbon, whereas panels (b) and (c)
are the band structures calculated for wrinkled ribbons with a 2% and 4% maximum
tensile strain, respectively. The vertical arrows indicate the direct band-gap
transitions, and from the calculation, one clearly sees that the corresponding band-
gap energy decreases as the uniaxial strain increases. This theoretical result is in
agreement with the trend observed experimentally for MoS2 wrinkles subjected to
inhomogeneous strain [23].

Low-Energy Model of Strained Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
The Hamiltonian (Eq. (14.3)) includes explicitly the hybridization between the metal
and the chalcogen atoms, being therefore the appropriate starting point for a compelling
derivation of an effective low-energy model of TMDs in the presence of strain. In this
section, we present, following the work of Rostami et al. [55], a simpliﬁed model for
strained single-layer TMDs valid around the K and Kʹ points of the Brillouin zone.

For this aim, we perform a Taylor expansion in momentum and in strain ﬁelds, followed
by a canonical projection onto the two (valence and conduction) low-energy bands.
From the technical point of view, in order to obtain an effective 2  2 (4  4 including
spin) model Hamiltonian, we use the Löwdin partitioning method [63]. Details about
the derivation are provided in [55]. Similar to the carbon nanotube and to the graphene
cases [59], we ﬁrst set the momentum coordinates on the relative valley (K-point of the
BZ), and we hence derive a strain-dependent Hamiltonian which includes the effect
of hopping integrals modiﬁcation caused by the deformation. The strain-dependent
Hamiltonian around K-point, up to second order in strain and momentum, can be

case of MoS2. A detailed derivation of the numerical values of all the parameters
of the low-energy model in terms of the original tight-binding parameters can be
found in [55]. It is useful to notice that the mass asymmetry parameter, α, and
topological term, β, are related to general physical properties of the band

small deformation.

of η1, the off-diagonal pseudo vector potential (A1) results are very weak as compared to
the diagonal ones. The opposite happens for the well-known cases of mono- and bilayer
graphene, for which the off-diagonal terms are the dominant components of the strain-
dependent Hamiltonian [59, 64]. The weakness of A1 in MoS2 might stem from the large

Strain Engineering in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
In the previous sections, we have summarized some of the theoretical tools that can be
used to study the electronic properties of TMDs, in particular when these materials are
subjected to external strain. To understand such effects is of fundamental importance
in order to exploit the potential of these crystals for their application in strain
engineering. Indeed, atomically thin semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides
have shown, apart from their outstanding ﬁgures-of-merit and electrical performances,
very interesting mechanical properties, unmatched by conventional 3D semiconduct-
ors. Application of different kinds of strain is possible in the laboratory with the use of
speciﬁc experimental techniques, as reviewed in [37]. In particular, nanoindentation
experiments on freely suspended single-layer MoS2 have demonstrated mechanical
properties approaching those predicted by Grifﬁth for ideal brittle materials in which

the fracture point is dominated by the intrinsic strength of the atomic bonds and not by
the existence of defects [65]. Contrary to conventional 3D semiconductors like
silicon, which typically breaks at strain levels of 1:5%, two-dimensional MoS2
does not break until >10% strain levels, and it can be folded and wrinkled almost
at will [37].
Strain engineering involves the study of how the physical properties of materials can
be tuned by controlling the external strain ﬁelds applied to them. The outstanding
stretchability of transition metal dichalcogenides makes them excellent candidates for
strain engineering due to the unprecedented tunability levels predicted for these mater-
ials that could lead to straintronic devices – devices with electronic and optical
properties that are engineered through the application of mechanical deformations.
For instance, single-layer MoS2 is expected to undergo a direct-to-indirect gap transition
at 2% of tensile uniaxial strain, and a semiconducting-to-metal transition at 1015%
of tensile biaxial strain [11, 16, 19]. Such huge tunability of the electronic band gap
(from 1:8 eV to 0 eV in single-layer MoS2) can be realistically exploited in thin layers
of transition metal dichalcogenides, since these materials can withstand such levels of
strain without rupture. It is interesting to compare this behavior with the poor window of
tunability of only 0.25 eV achieved for strained silicon at 1.5% biaxial strain, due to the
breaking of the bonds beyond that strain value [66].
Another possibility of atomically thin semiconductors is that one can deform them
only at a speciﬁc region, making it possible to generate localized proﬁles of strain.
A very interesting possibility of local strain engineering is to create a continuous
bending of the energy levels of electrons, holes,and excitons when a MoS2 membrane
is subjected to a point deformation at its centre. Upon illumination electron–hole pairs
are generated and, due to the large exciton binding energy, they are forced to hold
together and migrate towards the centre of the membrane, where the strain is maximum
and the band gap is minimum [11]. Therefore, strain gradients can be used to concen-
trate excitons in a small region of the crystal, which can be of interest for fundamental
physics (e.g. exciton condensates) and applications (e.g. solar energy funnel). The
possibility to create an exciton funnel has been demonstrated experimentally by two
different techniques. In [23], atomically thin MoS2 layers are subjected to large local
strains of up to 2.5% induced by controlled delamination from an elastomeric substrate.
The use of simultaneous scanning Raman and photoluminescence imaging allowed for
spatially resolved direct band-gap reduction of up to 90 meV induced by local strain.
A funnel effect was observed, in which excitons drift hundreds of nanometers to lower
band-gap regions before recombining, demonstrating exciton conﬁnement by local
strain. In [67], it has been created an optoelectronic crystal of artiﬁcial atoms in
strain-induced single-layer MoS2 with a non-uniform strain proﬁle.
The sensitivity of transition metal dichalcogenides to mechanical deformations can
be seen in the response of the phonon structure to strain. The Raman spectra of these
materials contain two main peaks corresponding to the A1g out-of-plane mode, where
the top and bottom X atoms move out of plane in opposite directions while M is ﬁxed,
and the E1
2g in-plane mode where the M and X atoms move in-plane in opposite
273

directions [68, 69]. The E1
2g mode is especially sensitive to applied strain. The
degeneracy of this mode is lifted under uniaxial strain, leading to red shifting and
splitting into two distinct peaks for strain of just 1% [23, 70, 71]. In Fig. 14.7, we
show the correlation between the measured Raman shift of the E1
2g mode and the strain
estimated from the analysis of the AFM topography. The black squares show the
results reported in [72] (which follows a linear relationship with a slope 1:7cm1 per
% strain) obtained by applying uniform tensile strain to few-layer MoS2. The change
in the size of the direct band gap as a function of the strain is shown in Fig. 14.7(b).
The change in the direct band gap is obtained from the shift of the A exciton in the
photoluminescence spectra, while the strain can be estimated from the shift of the E1
2g
Raman mode. The modiﬁcation of the direct gap obtained from the tight-binding
model introduced in the previous sections is shown by the solid line in (b). The tight-
binding theory describes the order of magnitude of the strain-induced change in the
gap, as seen by the coincidence between the calculated and measured extremal points
of the distribution; however, there are also many points that fall below the solid line.
This is a consequence of the funnel effect [11], which in the present context means
that, while the Raman signal represents an average over the whole laser spot area, the
photoluminescence gives only information about the minimum gap in the region
illuminated by the laser (Fig. 14.7(c)). When including this funnel effect, the local
strain tight-binding model ﬁts very well with the experimental results (dashed lines in
Fig. 14.7(b)).
Apart from the modiﬁcation of the band structure, strain engineering can exploit the
piezoelectric properties of 2D TMDs, converting mechanical to electrical energy.
Piezoelectricity is a well-known effect in which stretching or compressing a material
causes it to generate an electrical voltage, or the reverse, in which an external voltage
leads to contraction or expansion of the crystal membrane. To be piezoelectric, a
material must break inversion symmetry. A single atomic layer of MX2 has inversion
symmetry broken, and should be piezoelectric. However, in bulk MX2, successive
layers are oriented in opposite directions (see Fig. 14.1), and generate positive and
negative voltages that cancel each other out and give a zero net piezoelectric effect. This
effect has been proven in [38], where strain is induced on exfoliated MoS2 single-layer
ﬂakes when the polymer substrate is mechanically bent. The piezoelectric response can
be studied by coupling the device to an external load resistor, ﬁnding that the strain-
induced polarization charges at the sample edges can drive the ﬂow of electrons in an
external circuit. The electrons ﬂow back in the opposite direction when the substrate is
released. When strain is applied in the armchair direction, a positive (negative) voltage
and current is generated with increasing (decreasing) strain. This demonstrates the
conversion of mechanical energy into electricity [38]. Since one of the necessary
conditions for the existence of a piezoelectric effect is the lack of inversion symmetry,
when the experiment is done with bilayer or bulk samples, the piezo response is not
observed. Therefore, single-layer and few-layer samples of TMDs, with an odd number
of layers, present a strong intrinsic piezoelectric response, and are excellent candidates
for piezotronics applications in electromechanical sensing, wearable technologies, and
implanted devices.

Valley-Spin Physics in 2D
Semiconducting Transition
Metal Dichalcogenides
Hongyi Yu and Wang Yao
15.1
Introduction
Monolayer group-VIB transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently
emerged as a new class of semiconductors with appealing properties. The compounds
have the chemical composition of MX2, where M stands for the transition metal
element Mo or W, and X for the chalcogen element S or Se. The bulk crystals of the
group-VIB TMDs are of the layered structures where the elementary unit, i.e. mono-
layer, is an X–M–X covalently bonded quasi-2D hexagonal lattice [1]. The monolayers
are loosely bound together by the weak van der Waals force to form the bulk crystals.
Monolayer TMDs can be extracted from bulk crystals by mechanical exfoliation [2–4],
or synthesized using chemical vapor deposition or molecular beam epitaxy [5–10].
When TMDs are thinned down to the monolayer, the band gap crosses from an indirect
one to the direct one [2, 3, 6, 11, 12], which is in the visible frequency range. The
conduction and valence band edges in the monolayers are both located at the corners of
the hexagonal Brillouin zone (BZ), i.e., the K and K points that are related by time
reversal. The two degenerate but inequivalent band extrema constitute a discrete index
for low-energy electrons and holes, known as the valley pseudospin. Similar to the use
of spin in spintronics, this valley pseudospin of carriers may be utilized to encode
information in electronic devices, which has led to the concept of valley-based
electronics (or valleytronics) that has been explored in various materials with multi-
valley band structures [13–22].
Monolayer TMDs have provided a remarkable new laboratory for the exploration of
valley physics and valleytronic applications. Key to the utilization of carriers’ internal
quantum degree of freedom for information processing is the capability to distinguish
between states that represent different pieces of information and to control the dynamics
in the Hilbert space spanned by these states. This requires the internal quantum degree
of freedom to be associated with measurable physical properties, allowing it to be
coupled to external perturbations for measurement and control. In the 2D hexagonal
crystals, it was shown earlier using graphene models that, when inversion symmetry is
broken, the two degenerate valleys can be distinguished by pseudovector quantities,
such as the Berry curvature and the magnetic moment, which must take opposite values
at the time-reversal pair of valleys [15, 16]. The valley contrasted Berry curvatures and
magnetic moments can couple to external electric and magnetic ﬁelds, respectively,

giving rise to the valley Hall effect and valley Zeeman effect. Because of the inversion
symmetry breaking, optical interband transitions at the time reversal pair of valleys can
also acquire valley-dependent transition selection rules. These valley-dependent phe-
nomena make possible the manipulation of valley pseudospin via electric, magnetic,
and optical means, and they have all been discovered in monolayer TMDs where the
lattice has structural inversion asymmetry. Moreover, the strong spin–orbit coupling
from the transition metal elements gives rise to an effective interaction between the
valley pseudospin and the spin, making possible the interplay between these two
degrees of freedom, and allowing spin manipulations via the valley phenomena.
In this chapter, we give an overview of the valley and spin physics in monolayer
TMDs. The content is organized as follows. Section 15.2 brieﬂy introduces the valley-
dependent electronic structures at the band edges. Section 15.3 presents the various
valley and spin-dependent phenomena in monolayer TMDs, including the valley and
spin optical selection rules, the valley Zeeman effect, the valley and spin Hall effects,
and the non-linear valley and spin currents from triogonal warping. In Section 15.4,
we explain how the monolayer valley and spin physics can be inherited in bilayers.
Our emphasis is on the basic physics and theoretical framework, while more details on

Electronic Structure at the Band Edges
Figures 15.1(a) and (b) illustrate the quasi-2D hexagonal lattice of a TMD monolayer
[1]. The M atom is coordinated by the six neighboring X atoms in a trigonal prismatic
geometry. With the trigonal prismatic coordination, the structural inversion symmetry is
broken in the monolayer, key to the emergence of the valley-dependent physics
discussed here. There is mirror symmetry in the out-of-plane
zð Þ direction, which,
together with the time reversal symmetry, dictates an effective form of the coupling
between the valley and the spin degrees of freedom.
First-principles calculations have found that the band edge Bloch wave functions near
the conduction band minimum (valence band maximum) at K are predominantly from

operator ^Lz with magnetic quantum number m ¼ 0 m ¼ 2
ð
Þ [23], plus a small contri-
bution from the Xpx and py orbitals [1, 24] (Fig. 15.1(d)). The K points are high-
symmetry points invariant under the C3 operation (2π=3 in-plane rotation). Thus the
Bloch functions at K are the eigenstates of C3 with the eigenvalues ei2
3lπ, where l is an
integer that depends on the choice of the rotation center (M, X, or h the hollow center of
the hexagon formed by M and X, see Fig. 15.1(a)) [1]. In Table 15.1, the orbital
contributions and the quantum number l are given for the conduction and valence band
edge Bloch functions at the K point, while their counterparts at the K point can be
obtained by taking time reversal. The C3 rotational symmetry, of the band edge Bloch
functions, b underlies the valley optical selection rule in the monolayer and the interlayer
hopping properties in the bilayer, to be discussed in the following sections.

TMDs have a strong spin–orbit-coupling (SOC) originating from the M-d orbitals
[1, 24, 26]. The form of the spin–orbit splitting at the band edges is dictated by the
symmetries. With the mirror symmetry about the M-atom plane, the Bloch states in the
monolayer are invariant under the mirror reﬂection operation. Considering the fact that
mirror reﬂection of an in-plane spin vector is its opposite, while that of an out-of-plane
spin vector is itself, the Bloch states must have their spin either parallel or antiparallel to
the out-of-plane zð Þ direction, i.e. the SOC splitting must be in the z direction. Besides,
time reversal symmetry requires the spin splitting to have opposite sign at an arbitrary

First-principle calculations have found that the valence band at the K point has an
SOC splitting of λv e 0:15 eV in the MoX2 monolayer and λv e 0:45 eV in the WX2
monolayer [24, 26–28]. Because of this giant SOC splitting, the valence band edge in
monolayer TMDs has the spin index locked with the valley index, i.e. the K K
ð
Þ
valley has only the spin up (down) low-energy holes, which are formed by removing
spin down (up) valence electrons (Fig. 15.1(e)). Compared to the valence band edge
from the dx2y2  idxy orbital that has a ﬁnite magnetic quantum number m ¼ 2, the
conduction band edge is from the dz2 orbital with m ¼ 0. Thus the on-site spin–orbit
coupling vanishes to the leading order. First-principles calculations ﬁnd that the magni-
tude of conduction band spin splitting λc is a few meV for MoS2 and tens of meV for
MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 [24, 25, 29–37], which originates from the small X-p orbital
compositions, as well as second-order effect mediated by the remote conduction band
consisting of M-dxz  idyz orbitals. The two contributions to SOC have opposite signs
and their competition leads to the sign difference of λc between MoX2 and WX2
(Fig. 15.1(e)) [24, 25, 30].
The simplest theoretical model that gives a reasonably good description to the top
valence band and lowest conduction bands is a three-band tight-binding model [25],
constructed with the three M-d-orbitals only, i.e. dz2 and dx2y2  idxy, which are the
major orbital compositions of the band edge Bloch functions in K valleys. Including
the M–M nearest-neighbor hopping only, the three-band tight-binding model describes
the dispersions and Berry curvatures of conduction and valence bands near the K
points [25]. By including up to the third-nearest-neighbor hopping, all three bands agree
well with the ﬁrst-principles ones in the entire BZ [25]. This model has been applied to
the study of edge states in TMD nanoribbons [38], quantum dots formed by lateral
conﬁnement potential in the extended TMD monolayer [39], intercellular orbital
magnetic moment [40, 41], magnetoelectronic and optical properties [42], and
magnetoluminescence [43].
Expanding the tight-binding model in the neighborhood of the K points, the kp
model for describing the band edge physics can be obtained. By expanding the above
three-band model and keeping to the linear order in k, a minimum description of the
conduction and valence band edges in τzK valley has a rather simple form [26]

which captures the low-energy electronic structures in the K valleys of monolayer
TMDs, including the band dispersion, the Berry curvatures, and the giant SOC splitting
of the valence band. The τz terms explicitly account for the valley dependence of the
electronic structures at the band edges, which lead to the valley Hall effect, valley
magnetic moment, and the valley-dependent optical selection rule which will be
discussed in the following sections.
The two-band kp model has been widely used to study various properties of TMD
monolayers because of its simplicity. In the meantime, the simplicity of this model
inevitably imposes some limitations on its applications. For example, it cannot account
for the electron–hole asymmetry and the trigonal warping of band dispersion. The two
effects can be accounted for by including terms quadratic in k [24, 25, 29, 44]. The
corrected models with high-order terms have been used to study optical conductivity
[45], magneto-optical properties [46], plasmons [47], and spin relaxation [48]. The
small conduction band spin splitting at K, absent in the three-band tight-binding
model and hence its kp expansion, can also be added as a correction to Eq. (15.2)
if needed.

Valley and Spin Optical Selection Rules
The optical selection rules for interband transitions at K points are the direct
consequence of the C3 rotational symmetry of Bloch functions discussed earlier
(cf. Table 15.1) [1, 26, 49]. The interband optical transition matrix element satisﬁes

[26] (Fig. 15.2(a)). Owing to the giant SOC splitting in the valence band, the valley
optical selection rule also becomes a spin optical selection rule depending on the
excitation frequency [26] (Fig. 15.2(a)). Optical excitations of electron–hole pairs with
four distinct combinations of their spin and valley indices can be selectively realized
through the choice of the polarization and frequency of the excitation light. In principle,
such a selection rule is rigorous only at the high-symmetry K points. Near the K
points, the kp model in Eq. (15.2) leads to [26]

15.3.2
Optical Orientation of Excitonic Valley Pseudospin
Through the interband transition, the absorption of a photon excites a valence electron
to the conduction band, leaving a vacancy in the ﬁlled valence band that is effectively
described as a hole. The attractive Coulomb interaction between the negatively charged
electron and the positively charged hole leads to their binding into a hydrogen-like
bound pair, known as the exciton. Exciton plays a key role in optoelectronic phenomena
in monolayer TMDs [50]. It can capture an extra electron or hole to form a negatively or
positively charged exciton, also known as trion. The measured trion binding energy, i.e.
the difference between the exciton and trion resonances in the absorption or photo-
luminescence, is of the order of tens of meV, about one order of magnitude larger than
that in GaAs quantum wells. This points to an exceptionally large exciton binding
energy of the order of hundreds of meV [51–54], which is also predicted by ﬁrst-
principles calculations [28, 33, 55–58], and jointly revealed by various measurements
including the reﬂection spectra [59], two-photon absorption [60–63], and scanning
tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy [10, 64–66]. Such strong Coulomb binding is due
to the large effective masses of both electron and hole and the reduced dielectric
screening in the 2D geometry [56, 59, 61, 67]. Meanwhile, the exciton wave function
is largely the Wannier type, with electron and hole both well localized near the K
points in the momentum space [56, 61]. An exciton can then be classiﬁed by the valley
Fig. 15.2 (a) Valley and spin optical transition selection rules. (b) Optical orientation of excitonic
valley pseudospin. A bright exciton in the K valley corresponds to valley pseudospin up
(τz ¼ þ1, north pole on the Bloch sphere), which couples exclusively to σ+ circularly polarized
photon, while bright exciton in the –K valley corresponds to valley pseudospin down (τz ¼ 1,
south pole on the Bloch sphere), which couples to σ circularly polarized photon. The Bloch
sphere equator corresponds to an equal superposition of the two valleys (in-plane valley
pseudospin), which couples to linearly polarized photon with the polarization indicated by double
arrows (reproduced from [50] with permission from Oxford University Press). (c) Valley-

conﬁguration of its electron and hole constituents. Due to the momentum conservation,
the bright exciton that can radiatively recombine must have its electron and hole in the
same valley. The two degenerate valley conﬁgurations of bright excitons can then be
described by the excitonic valley pseudospin τ, where τz ¼ þ1 and τz ¼ 1 corres-
pond, respectively, to the exciton being in the Kand  K valley (Fig. 15.2(b)).
These bright excitons inherit the valley optical selection rules of the band-to-band
transitions at K points, allowing their valley speciﬁc interconversion with photons of
selected helicity: exciton with valley pseudospin up (down) τz ¼ þ1 1

Þ circularly polarized photon (Fig. 15.2(b)). A linearly
polarized photon is a coherent superposition of a σþ polarized photon and a
σ polarized one, which can then interconvert with an exciton in a coherent superpos-
ition of being in the Kand K valley, transferring the optical coherence to valley
quantum coherence [51]. Such a bright exciton carries an in-plane valley pseudospin,
i.e. on the equator of the Bloch sphere representation of the excitonic valley pseudospin
(Fig. 15.2(b)). Different points on the equator then correspond to photon linear polar-
ization along different axis in the monolayer plane. The correspondence between the
valley polarization/coherence and the photon polarization has been exploited for optical
orientation of the excitonic valley pseudospin using circularly or linearly polarized
excitation, as demonstrated in experiments of polarization-resolved photoluminesence
[49, 51, 68–72]. The valley selective exciton–photon coupling has also enabled the
pump–probe study of valley dynamics [73–77], and the valley selective optical Stark
effect [78, 79] at different monolayer TMDs.
15.3.3
Valley Magnetic Moment and Valley Zeeman Effect
The magnetic moment of a Bloch electron characterizes its response to the magnetic
ﬁeld. In monolayer TMDs, the time reversal symmetry between K and K requires
their magnetic moment to have identical magnitude but opposite signs. An out-of-plane
magnetic ﬁeld then lifts the valley degeneracy, leading to a valley Zeeman effect. For
the spin–valley locked band edges, the overall valley Zeeman shift has three contribu-
tions [40, 41, 80, 81] (Fig. 15.2(c)). The ﬁrst is from the spin magnetic moment. The
second is the atomic orbital magnetic moment. In monolayer TMDs, the conduction
(valence) band in the K valley mainly consists of M-dz2 dx2y2  idxy

orbitals with

ð
Þ. This contributes to a Zeeman shift of 0 and
2μBB for the conduction and valence band, respectively. The third is a lattice
contribution (i.e. vanishes when the hopping between the lattice sites is turned off),
which is also associated with the Berry phase effect of the Bloch electrons [82]. This
lattice contribution is given by [16, 83]

The valley Zeeman shift of the conduction and valence band edges can manifest in
the energy cost of generating an electron–hole pair in a speciﬁc valley, so the two valley
bright exciton states will also have a valley Zeeman splitting, making possible magneto-
control of the excitonic valley pseudospin dynamics. With the valley optical selection
rule, the exciton valley Zeeman splitting may be detected from the polarization-resolved
PL measurement, where the magnetic ﬁeld is expected to shift in opposite directions
with the σþ and σ polarized PL peaks that correspond to the bright exciton resonances
in valley K and K, respectively [40, 41, 80, 81] (Fig. 15.2(c)). The exciton valley
Zeeman splitting measures the difference between the Zeeman shifts of the conduction
and valence band edges, so the three contributions to the magnetic moment of the
spin–valley locked band edge carriers are partially inherited. Firstly, the spin magnetic
moment does not affect the optical resonances, because optical transitions conserve
spin so that the shift of the initial and ﬁnal states due to the spin magnetic moment
is identical. Secondly, with the conduction (valence) band in the K valley
mainly consisting of M-dz2 dx2y2  idxy


orbitals with the magnetic quantum
m ¼ 0 m ¼ 2
ð
Þ, the magnetic moment of the atomic orbital is a major contribution
to the valley Zeeman shift of the exciton resonance (Fig. 15.2(c)). Lastly, we note the
lattice contribution to the magnetic moment also results in a ﬁnite exciton valley
Zeeman shift. Within the minimum two-band massive Dirac fermion model of Eq.
(15.2), the electron and hole magnetic moment associated with the Berry phase effect
exactly cancel because of the particle–hole symmetry. Nevertheless, corrections beyond
the two-band model result in a ﬁnite difference for the electron and hole magnetic
moment, and it is this difference, as well as the atomic orbital contribution, that is
measured by the splitting of the σþ and σ PL peaks [40, 41].
15.3.4
Berry Phase Effect and Valley Hall Current
The Berry phase effect for a particle lies in the dependence of the internal structure on
the dynamical parameter [82]. In the context of Bloch electrons, it lies in the depend-
ence of the periodic part of the Bloch function un,k on the wavevector k. Consider a
wavepacket of Bloch electrons moving adiabatically in a non-degenerate energy band
with band index n. Under smooth perturbations, it is possible to construct the wave-
packet with a length scale that is small compared to that of the external perturbation but
large compared to the lattice constant. One can then speak simultaneously of the central
position of the electron in real and in momentum space, and the semiclassical equation
of motion for the Bloch electron is then written [15, 83]

Obviously, in an applied electric ﬁeld the Ω term corresponds to an anomalous velocity
perpendicular to the ﬁeld, i.e. a Hall effect. The Berry curvature has a form similar to the
lattice contribution of the magnetic moment m (cf. Eq. (15.4)), so non-zero Berry
curvature in general implies a ﬁnite magnetic moment, and vice versa.
In monolayer TMDs, the K valley conduction and valence bands can be described
by the massive Dirac fermion model, which together with the inversion symmetry
breaking give rise to sizeable Berry curvatures with opposite signs at the two valleys

,In the presence of an in-plane electric ﬁeld, the valley contrasting Ω gives rise to a
Hall current of the carriers with the sign depending on the valley index [16, 26, 84]
(Figs. 15.3(a) and (b)), i.e. a valley Hall effect. The valley Hall effect is an analog of the
spin Hall effect [85–87], but with the valley pseudospin playing the role of spin. For
hole doped systems, because the spin index is locked with the valley index for the band
edge holes, the valley Hall effect is at the same time a spin Hall effect (Fig. 15.3(a)). For
n-doped monolayers, the ﬁnite conduction band spin splitting can lead to different
populations of spin up and down electrons in a given valley (cf. Fig. 15.1(e)), and the
spin dependence of Δ0 in Eq. (15.7) also results in different magnitudes of their Berry
curvatures. As a result, the valley Hall effect of electrons is also accompanied by the
spin Hall effect (Fig. 15.3(b)). Passing a longitudinal current through the monolayer, the
valley Hall effect in the 2D bulk will lead to valley polarization on the edges, which can
be detected from the Kerr rotation of an incident linearly polarized light based on the
valley optical selection rules [88].
The valley contrasting Berry curvature and the valley optical selection rules together
can further lead to a Hall effect that can be detected from electrical measurement [16].

and holes will acquire opposite transverse velocities because of the conduction and
valence band Berry curvatures, which then move to the two opposite edges, contrib-
uting the same sign to the Hall voltage [16, 26] (Fig. 15.3(c)). Such Hall effects of photo
injected carriers have already been observed in monolayer MoS2 and WS2 [89, 90].
15.3.5
Non-Linear Valley-Spin Current Response from Trigonal Warping
The valley Hall effect is a linear response to the electric ﬁeld. The valley current in the
transverse direction is always accompanied by the much larger longitudinal charge
current, a major cause of dissipation that cannot be removed as it has the same linear
dependence on the ﬁeld. Here we show that there exists another mechanism for
generating bulk valley current in monolayer TMDs, which is a quadratic response to
the electric ﬁeld that makes possible current rectiﬁcation to generate dc valley currents
by ac electric ﬁeld, with the absence of net charge current. The effect arises from the
trigonal warping of the band edges at the K valleys, which corrects the parabolic
dispersion to [29]

Þ is the wavevector measured from the band edge τzK point,

in the trigonal warping term ensures the time reversal symmetry between the K and K
valleys, which have opposite trigonal warping (see Figs. 15.4(a) and (b)). The trigonal
warping term couples the valley index to the momentum, so the current response to an
in-plane electric ﬁeld becomes valley dependent. This gives rise to a ﬁnite valley current
jv, deﬁned as the difference between the current responses in the two valleys [91]. For
the spin–valley locked band edge carriers in monolayer TMDs, the valley current is also
a spin current.
Under the relaxation time approximation and in the limit of weak intervalley
scattering, such valley current arises in the second order of the applied electric ﬁeld [91]

(perpendicular to) the ﬁeld (see Figs. 15.4(a) and (b)). In an ac electric ﬁeld, the dc
charge current is absent, while there is a dc valley current, as the valley currents in
opposite electric ﬁelds point in the same direction (Fig. 15.4(c)). From the quadratic
dependence of jv on kd in Eq. (15.9), it is clear that the non-linear valley current favors
large mobility. Taking a mobility value of e1000 cm2 V1 s1 that has been achieved at
low temperature [92, 93], we estimate the non-linear valley current magnitude starts to
exceed that of the valley Hall current at an electric ﬁeld of e10 mV μm1.

We summarize here the key differences between the two mechanisms for bulk valley
current generation. The origin of the non-linear valley current is valley-dependent
dispersion, arising from the Fermi surface anisotropy for a time-reversal pair of valleys,
while the valley Hall current is induced by the ﬁnite Berry curvatures of the carriers.
The valley Hall effect requires inversion symmetry breaking, which is not necessary for
the non-linear valley current studied here. The valley Hall current is always perpendicu-
lar to the electric ﬁeld and is independent of the crystalline axis, while the direction of
the non-linear valley current is determined by both the direction of the electric ﬁeld and
the crystalline axis.

Valley and Spin Physics in Bilayers
Natural crystals of the four TMDs of interest (MS2 and MSe2) are mostly the 2H stacked
ones, where the adjacent monolayers are rotated 180 to each other, with M sites of one
layer sitting right on top of the X sites of the adjacent layer. Figure 15.5(a) shows the
unit cell of the 2H stacked bilayer and bulk, where inversion symmetry is restored.
Albeit less stable than the 2H stacking, 3R is another possible stacking order for the
bulk crystals of the four TMDs of interest. 3R stacking has the same monolayer unit as
the 2H stacking, while the neighboring layers are simply translations of each other
[94, 95] (Fig. 15.5(b)), so the inversion symmetry is still broken.

15.4 Valley and Spin Physics in Bilayers

14 Aug 2017 at 14:34:21, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

The valley and spin physics of the monolayer is inherited in different ways in the 2H
and 3R stacking. For the 3R stacking, the interlayer hopping simply vanishes at the K
points for both the conduction and valence bands, because of the rotational symmetry of
the band edge Bloch functions. The hopping matrix element between two adjacent
layers write
hψU,Kj ^HintjψL,Ki ¼ hC3ψU,KjC3 ^HintC1
3 jC3ψL,Ki
¼ ei2
3π lUlL
ð
ÞhψU,Kj ^H intjψL,Ki:
(15.10)
A non-zero hopping matrix element therefore requires the two quantum numbers
lU and lL to be identical. For the 3R stacking, an X-site in the upper layer sits on top of
an M-site in the lower layer, which can be taken as the center of the in-plane C3
rotations in Eq. (15.10). Thus, the values of lU and lL are to be taken, respectively, from
the X and M columns in Table 15.1, which are different for either the conduction or the
valence band edge Bloch functions. Thus the interlayer hopping vanishes at K for
both the conduction and valence bands. The optical selection rules and valley Hall effect
of the monolayer are directly inherited in the 3R bilayer and multilayers [95].
For 2H stacking, similar analysis can show that the interlayer hopping vanishes at
K in the conduction band [1, 96, 97]. In the valence band, however, the interlayer
hopping is ﬁnite at K, and its competition with the large spin–valley coupling has
interesting consequences. Figure 15.5(c) schematically shows the band edges of two

monolayers in 2H stacking order, with dashed arrows illustrating the interlayer hopping
that conserves the spin and momentum. The 180 rotation of the lower layer (relative to
the upper layer) switches the K valleys. As a result, the sign of the spin splitting
becomes dependent on both the valley index and the layer index. Introducing pseudo-
spin χ to denote the layer degree of freedom (χz ¼ 1 for upper, and χz ¼ 1 for lower
layer), the holes at τzK can be described by
^H2H ¼ λvτz^Szχz þ t⊥χx:
(15.11)
The ﬁrst term characterizes the SOC, i.e. the valley and layered-dependent spin
splitting, which manifests as an effective coupling between spin, valley, and layer
pseudospins. The second term is the interlayer hopping, where ﬁrst-principle calcula-
tions ﬁnds t⊥in the order of tens meV. The SOC strength λv then corresponds to the
energy cost of the interlayer hopping.
In WX2, where λv is much larger than t⊥, interlayer hybridization is substantially
quenched by the giant SOC splitting [1, 12, 98]. Thus in 2H bilayer WX2, both the
conduction and valence Bloch states in the K valleys are predominantly localized in
either the upper or the lower layer. The K valley physics is essentially that of the two
decoupled monolayers. The valley Hall currents from the two layers average out, but the
spin Hall currents add constructively. Under excitation by circularly polarized light,
e.g. σþ, valley K is excited in the upper layer while valley K is excited in the lower
layer, so there is no net valley polarization generated. However, σþ excites spin up
exclusively in both layers, so the spin optical selection rules are still present in the
inversion symmetric bilayers. Circular polarized PL can now come from the spin optical
selection rule and is not necessarily an indication of inversion symmetry.
In MoX2, λv has comparable magnitude to t⊥, so the layer hybridization becomes
non-negligible. In such a case, an interlayer bias that breaks the inversion symmetry in
the bilayer can substantially change the layer polarizations of the Bloch states in the
K valley, affecting the valley related phenomena. Experiments have shown that the
degree of circular polarization of photoluminescence under a circularly polarized
excitation can be continuously tuned between zero and ﬁnite as a function of gate
voltage in bilayer MoS2 [99]. The tuning of the valley Hall effect by interlayer bias in
bilayer MoS2 is also reported recently through the detection of valley polarization
accumulated via the Kerr rotation measurements [88, 89]. These experiments indicate
a controllable way to tune the valley physical properties by changing the symmetry of
the system.
Lastly, it is worth noting a unique possibility of controlling the spin and pseudospins
in 2H bilayers. With the effective coupling of spin and valley to the layer pseudospin,
concerning the carriers in the lower energy spin-split subband, the spin index is now
locked to the layer pseudospin polarization in a given valley. As the layer pseudospin
couples to the electric ﬁeld in the perpendicular direction, such spin-layer locking
suggests the possibility of controlling these quantum degrees of freedom by various
magnetoelectric effects [96, 97, 99]. For example, the electric ﬁeld can now induce a
spin splitting much larger than that possible in a magnetic ﬁeld [96, 97], while in-plane
magnetic ﬁeld can induce charge oscillations between the layers [96].

Electrical Transport in MoS2:
A Prototypical Semiconducting TMDC
Andras Kis
16.1
Introduction
The sheer number of materials in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide family,
around 60 of them already known in late 1960s [1] makes this material class a very
interesting playground for exploring mesoscopic physical phenomena at the single- and
few-layer limit. Depending on their chemical composition, layered TMDCs can cover a
wide range of electrical properties from semiconducting to semimetallic and metallic.
Collective phenomena such as charge-density waves and superconductivity have also
been observed in the single- and few-layer limit [2] at low temperatures and sometimes
high charge densities. This chapter will not be discussing these but will rather focus on
electron transport and how it is inﬂuenced by disorder in the example of single-layer
and ultra-thin MoS2. Since the resurgence of TMDCs in the context of 2D materials,
MoS2 has been and remains the most studied material from this class. The easy
availability of MoS2 at reasonably high qualities and at low prices in the form of a
mineral molybdenite gave rise to a virtuous cycle with a rapid progression of experi-
mental results and theoretical predictions. As a result, we now have the most complete
picture of charge transport, and the different scattering mechanisms, that can limit it,
built on the example of MoS2.
One of the critical advances that brought about the resurgence of layered TMDCs as
semiconducting alternatives to graphene was the realization of a ﬁeld-effect transistor
that could be switched on and off, based on single-layer MoS2 [3]. This was the ﬁrst
time a high-quality device on a 2D material other than graphene was demonstrated.
Field-effect transistors are not only important as the basic building block used a switch
in a digital electronic circuit but is also the basic device used to interface nanoscale
semiconductors with the outside world and assess their electrical properties. Crucial for
the success of this MoS2 transistor was the use of HfO2 as a top-gate dielectric but also
as an encapsulating layer that allowed high-performance levels to be reached. Its role
was theoretically explained later by homopolar phonon mode quenching [4, 5] and
charged impurity screening by the dielectric and the top-gate [6]. Later experiments
showed that even higher mobilities in monolayer MoS2 could be achieved using
vacuum annealing that could remove adsorbates [7, 8] or by encapsulating MoS2
between two boron–nitrate (BN) layers [9].
Multi-terminal devices in the dual-gate geometry were also used to demonstrate the
metal-insulator transition and band transport in MoS2. Figure 16.2(a) shows the

observed sheet conductivity and its dependence on the top-gate voltage. For charge
densities above a value of ~1013 cm–2, monolayer MoS2 shows conductivity that
increases as the temperature is increased which is a sign of metallic behavior. Electron
mobilities extracted from measurements showed an impurity-limited mobility of
120–180 cm2 V–1 s–1. Above 20 K, the mobility starts to decrease and in the
100–300 K range it can be ﬁtted to the power-law dependence μ / Tγ with the exponent
γ in the 0.55–0.78 range. This value is much smaller than the experimental values found for
bulk crystals (γ = 2.6 [10]) or for bare monolayers (γ = 1.4 [11]), showing that the presence
of the top-gate can reduce the rate of mobility degradation with rising temperature.

Ballistic Transport Simulations
Valuable ﬁrst insights into the performance limits of MOSFETs based on 2D TMDCs
near their scaling limit can be obtained by starting from band structure calculations and
using a simple analytical theory for ballistic FETs [12]. Such simulations can then be
considered as the best-case scenario for highest achievable current levels and switching
slopes. They consider mobile charges at the top of the potential barrier between source
and drain electrodes. The barrier is controlled by gate, source and drain potentials
through respective capacitors.

Figure 16.3 shows the simulations for n-type MOSFETs based on several TMDC
monolayers [13]. Mo-based monolayers show similar ON currents due to their effective
masses being similar, and they slightly outperform 5 nm thick Si transistors. WSe2
devices outperform reference 5 nm thick Si transistors by ~28% in terms of the ON-
current.

Quantum transport models, based on the non-equilibrium Green’s function (NEGF)
formalism are the next step up in terms of accuracy [14]. Here, a solution is found by
iteratively solving transport equations together with Poisson’s equation until a self-
consistency between charge density and electrostatic potential is achieved. Current is

where F–1/2 is the Fermi–Dirac integral of order –1/2, TSD the transmission coefﬁcient
from source to drain, and EFS and EFD are the Fermi energies in the source and drain
electrodes.
This results in a device characteristic of ballistic transistors with a 15 nm gate length
shown in Fig. 16.4, with a maximum current Imax ~ 1.6 mA/μm. For this simulated gate
length, the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) is very small (10 mV/V). Simulations
also show that the control of the gate electrode over the device is very good (see
Fig. 16.4(b)), due to the small thickness of the semiconducting channel and that devices
with a 5 nm gate length show performance close to the ITRS 2026 low-power
requirements [15].
A further exploration of device limits was performed using full-band quantum
transport simulations [16, 17], which reveal an additional region of negative differential
resistance (NDR) in the drain current versus voltage characteristics which are not seen
in effective mass-based NEGF calculations. This is attributed to the narrow width in
energy of the lowest conduction band but could be suppressed in realistic devices by
scattering. Similar to NEGF simulations, full-band simulations show negligibly low
DIBL of ~10 mV/V and an ideal subthreshold slope of 60 mV/dec at 300 K, with the
best numbers for MoS2. Increasing the mass of the chalcogen atom results in a slight
degradation of subthreshold slope and DIBL. The peak transconductance for MoS2 is
reached for VDS = 0.2 V and is about 4 mS/μm. Further increase of the bias voltage

reduces the transconductance due to the appearance of NDR. W-based compounds in
general show higher transconductance and weaker NDR (Fig. 16.5).
16.3
Scattering Mechanisms
While modeling of devices using ballistic simulations can provide upper bounds on
their performance which could be relevant for the performance of scaled devices, in
order to achieve more realistic results, we also need to consider various sources of
scattering. According to sources, these can be divided into intrinsic or extrinsic. Phonon
scattering should be the dominant limiting factor in sufﬁciently clean samples at room
temperatures. Kaasbjerg et al. [4] ﬁrst calculated the strength of electron–phonon
interaction in MoS2 from ﬁrst principles using DFT calculations as the starting point,
from which they deduced the acoustic and optical deformation potentials (ADP and
ODP) as well as the Fröhlich interaction. They found room temperature phonon-limited
mobility for monolayer MoS2 of ~410 cm2 V–1 s–1, determined by zero-order deform-
ation potential scattering and polar optical scattering via the Fröhlich interaction.
The mobility drops signiﬁcantly from ~2500 cm2 V–1 s–1 at T = 100 K to
~400 cm2 V–1 s–1 at T = 300 K. Liu et al. revisited NEGF-based simulations of scaled
devices [18] and found that including phonon scattering levels corresponding to this
value of room temperature mobility result in a 34.9% reduction in the ON-state current
in a device with a gate length of 20 nm and 11.2% in a 5 nm device when compared
with results in the ballistic limit.
Including piezoelectric interaction [5] lowers the mobility to 320 cm2 V–1 s–1 at room
temperature at a change concentration n = 1011 cm–2. The room temperature mobility
also follows a dependence on temperature that can be described with a relationship μ /
Tγ, where the value of the exponent is γ ~ 1.69 whereas bulk MoS2 is characterized by
γ ~ 1.69 [10], which could be an indicator of different electron–phonon coupling in bulk
crystals and monolayers. The mean-free path at room temperature should be λ ~ 14 nm.

16.3 Scattering Mechanisms
017
14 Aug 2017 at 14:34:44, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use,

For scattering from charge impurities to be dominant, the impurity spacing should be
of the order of the phonon mean-free path or smaller, resulting in a lower limit of
~51011 cm–2 for the minimum impurity concentration needed to dominate phonon
scattering [4].
At lower temperatures (T < 100 K), scattering from optical phonons is suppressed
and acoustic phonons become the dominant source of scattering (Fig. 16.6). Unlike
scattering from impurities which can be addressed using for example dielectric
engineering [19], scattering from acoustic phonons cannot be eliminated and hence
presents an upper limit for mobilities. Such a regime gives rise to a strong change in
the temperature-dependence of the carrier mobility as the temperature is lowered
under the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature TBG. In the case of monolayer MoS2 with
a 2DEG and valley degeneracy of 2, the Bloch–Grüneisen temperature TBG
corresponds to

for the transverse (TA) and (LA) acoustic phonons, implying the need to achieve high
charge densities, using for example ionic liquid gating.
The room temperature phonon-limited mobility could also be strongly inﬂuenced by
intervalley scattering. In addition to the band gap located at the K point for the
monolayer MoS2, DFT calculations also predict that there is a second, local minimum
in the conduction band, located at a slightly higher energy than that of the K point. This
point is called the Q valley and the energy separation between Q and K valleys EQK is
estimated to be between 50 and 200 meV [4, 20]. The emission or absorption of
longitudinal acoustic phonons can then mix these two valleys and the relatively large
density of states in the Q valley increases the likelihood of scattering. Li et al. [21]
found that, for EQK = 70 meV, intervalley scattering can increase the scattering rate for
K-valley electrons by almost an order of magnitude at room temperature, resulting in a
room temperature mobility of ~130 cm2 V–1 s–1.

The dielectric environment can affect the scattering inside 2D semiconducting chan-
nels. In the presence of a charged impurity in the semiconducting channel, the mismatch
in the dielectric constant between the semiconductor with a dielectric constant εs and the
environment (εe) result in the creation of an inﬁnite array of image charges, contributing
to the total electrical potential affecting the motion of the electron. This results in an
enhancement of Coulomb interaction between the charged impurity and the electron in
the case of εe < εs and a suppression for εs < εe. In the presence of a large number of
charge carriers inside the 2D semiconductor, the Coulomb potential is further screened.
The screening from free carriers has however an opposite dependence on the dielectric
environment than in the case of image charges: the free-carrier screening is weaker for
εs < εe and stronger for εs < εe. To gain a more complete picture of the inﬂuence of the
dielectric environment on the electron mobility in a 2D semiconductor, we also need to
include another important scattering mechanism that limits the mobility in samples of
MoS2 and related materials. It is the remote phonon or surface-optical (SO) phonon
scattering, due to electrons in the 2D semiconductor exciting optical phonons in the
surrounding dielectric through long-range Coulomb interaction. In a realistic situation,
the total of these previously considered contributions – the screening from image
charges, screening from free-carriers, SO phonon scattering, and phonon mode
quenching – that describe the inﬂuence of the dielectric environment on charge trans-
port inside the semiconductor. While at ﬁrst we could expect that having a high-κ
environment would result in the highest mobility, typical high-κ dielectrics also tend to
have low optical phonon frequencies, Table 16.1, which makes it easy for charge
carriers to excite them.
This is clearly illustrated on Fig. 16.7, where the room temperature electron mobility
in single-layer MoS2 is plotted for different dielectric environments at 100 K and 300 K.
In the absence of SO phonon scattering, the electron mobility is limited by impurities
and increases with increased dielectric constant of the environment as the dielectric
screening reduces Coulomb scattering. Including SO phonon scattering reduces electron
mobility, in some cases to levels under the reference value for SiO2/air interface,
corresponding to one of the most common back-gated transistor conﬁgurations.
The importance of charged impurity and SO phonon scattering in single-layer MoS2
is also shown on Fig. 16.8, where the mobility is plotted as a function of impurity and
electron densities. From this, it can be seen that for high impurity concentrations
(NI above ~1013 cm–2), the presence of high-κ dielectrics can improve the mobility,

especially for low charge carrier concentrations (Fig. 16.8(c)). For NI lower than
~1012 cm–2, low-κ environments show higher electron mobility, with suspended
MoS2 showing the potential to reach over 10-000 cm2 V–1 s–1, while BN/BN shows
second-best mobilities. Encapsulating MoS2 in BN has indeed resulted in highest low-
temperature mobilities in this material to date, reaching 34,000 cm2 V–1 s–1 for six-layer
thick MoS2 [9]. Another promising strategy for achieving high mobilities involves
vacuum annealing that can remove adsorbates and related charged scatterers [7, 8].
The fact that the experimentally observed [11] dependence of the electron mobility
on temperature showed a power-law behavior (μ / T–γ; γ in the 0.5–0.78 range), which
shows that other mechanisms, in addition to scattering from acoustic, optical and remote
optical phonons, could be responsible for enhancing the mobility at room temperature.
Ong et al. [6] developed a model in which they included the effect of image charges
induced in the top-gate by charged impurities in MoS2, Fig. 16.9(a). They ﬁnd that the
Coulomb-impurity limited mobility monotonically increases with charge density n and
that the mobility enhancement from the top-gate stack is modest at low temperatures
(T < TF, where TF is the Fermi temperature, TF = 29 K for MoS2), since there the
screening is dominated by the charge polarizability. At temperatures above TF, the
screening by the surroundings of MoS2 become more important. Adding the scattering
contributions from phonons, results in the mobilities plotted on Fig. 16.9(b). Phonon
scattering from longitudinal acoustic, transverse acoustic, longitudinal optical, and
homopolar phonons is included in mobility calculations for bare MoS2 (Fig. 16.9(b))
while for the top-gated MoS2 it is assumed that the homopolar modes are quenched [4,
5]. The γ exponent as a function of temperature is plotted on Fig. 16.9(c), showing that it
decreases from 0.75–1.0 to 0.43–0.47 in the presence of the top-gate, indicating that it
modiﬁes the Coulomb-impurity scattering.
16.4
Point Defects
The main candidates for intrinsic charged impurities are point defects. These are present
simply due to entropy and can be introduced in large concentrations during CVD and
other growth processes. Figure 16.10(a) shows TEM images and structural models from
some of the most common point defects occurring in the CVD material, including sulphur
vacancies (VS), bivacancies (VS2), substitutions of S columns by Mo atoms (MoS2)
missing MoS3 and MoS6 complexes (VMoS3 and VMoS6), and substitutions of Mo atoms
by S columns (S2Mo) [22]. Calculations of their formation energies can give insight into
their stability and relative abundance, with point defects having lower formation energies
being more stable and appearing more often. Results of such calculations are shown in
Fig. 16.10(b) and show that sulphur vacancies have the lowest formation energy and are
the most common point defects, with a formation energy of 2.12 eV and observed
concentration which could be as high as ~1013 cm–2 [23]. Bivacancies are less likely
with a formation energy of 4.14 eV, followed by the SMo antisite defect [23].
These point defects introduce in-gap localized defect states, with Fig. 16.10(d)
schematically showing the band structures for VS, VS2, and S2Mo type defects.

VS and VS2 result in the formation of unoccupied deep levels 0.6 eV below the
conduction band minimum, possibly acting as compensation centers in n-type MoS2.
They also result in the formation of shallow levels above the valence band, which could
explain the difﬁculty in achieving ambipolar operation in monolayer MoS2. VS2 and
S2Mo are also expected to result in the formation of shallow levels below the conduction

band, which could signiﬁcantly affect charge carrier transport and introduce disorder.
Calculations of the effect of these defects on the phonon-limited mobilities [23] show
that the presence of sulphur vacancies (VS and VS2) has a weak effect on the phonon-
limited electron mobility, which in turn is strongly affected by antisite defects (MoS and
MoS2). All these signiﬁcantly reduce hole mobilities, which is understandable since they
all result in shallow levels above the valence band maximum.
While these calculations only considered vacancies and substitutions of Mo by S and
vice versa, another common impurity in MoS2 samples could be Rhenium substituting
Mo atoms, since Re can commonly occur in naturally occurring MoS2 [25]. Its high
melting point also makes it difﬁcult to separate from molybdenum and it could be
present in molybdenum-based compounds used in CVD synthesis, so we cannot
exclude it from being present in CVD materials at this point. Substitutional Re acts as
an n-type shallow donor [26] and together with sulphur vacancies could explain why
monolayer MoS2 is an n-type semiconductor.
Intrinsic point defects, together with defects in the surrounding dielectric or the
semiconductor/dielectric interface, can trap charges which can then scatter mobile
charge carriers and act as a source of disorder. Temperature-dependent electrical
conductivity measurements in the four-probe geometry can very clearly show the effect
of point defects and disorder on electrical transport. Figure 16.11 shows the Arrhenius
plot of monolayer MoS2 conductance G as a function of inverse temperature and for
different charge carrier concentrations. The device in this example consisted of back-
gated monolayer MoS2 [11]. Two distinct scaling regimes can be distinguished: at
relatively high temperatures and charge concentrations, the conductance G follows
thermally activated behavior with G / exp(–Ea/kBT), shown as straight lines on
Fig. 16.11, and corresponding to nearest-neighbor hopping. At lower temperatures

and charge densities, a crossover to a weaker temperature dependence can be
observed, with a conductance that can be ﬁtted by the variable-range hopping model,
G / exp(–(T0/T)1/3), typical of hopping transport via localized states in disordered
low-dimensional systems.
More insight into disorder and localized band tails states in MoS2 can be gained using
capacitance and ac conductance measurements as the localized states are characterized
with different time constants τ and act as additional capacitors and resistors connected in
parallel to the semiconductor.
An example of such capacitance measurements as a function of frequency is shown
on Fig. 16.12(a) [27]. The presence of a double hump in these measurements indicates
the presence of at least two types of traps, with the corresponding density of states and
time constants shown in Fig. 16.12(b). These are assigned to mid-gap traps (M) and
band edge (B) traps. Their location in the band gap is shown on Fig. 16.12(c). The trap
states at the band edge contribute to its smearing that for energies below the band edge
energy ED can be described by an exponentially decaying density of states as we move
away from the band edge into the band gap

with φ = 100 meV the characteristic energy width of the band tail obtained from a ﬁt to
data. Such a relatively high value is indicative of relatively large disorder and scattering.
Some of the point defects can however be repaired, with the most prominent sulphur
vacancy being a prime example. Low-temperature thiol chemistry was successfully
used to repair them [28] using (3-mercaptopropyl)trimethoxysilane (MPS) and mild
annealing. This was shown to result in a reduction in localized trap states and a very
high mobility of 80 cm2 V–1 s–1 in monolayer MoS2 at room temperature. Treating
MoS2 with a non-oxidizing organic superacid bis(triﬂuoromethane) sulfonimide (TFSI)
was also recently shown to enhance the photoluminescence and minority carrier lifetime

Optical Properties of TMD
Heterostructures
Pasqual Rivera, Wang Yao, and Xiaodong Xu
Heterostructures formed by 3D semiconductors have led to repeated breakthroughs in
both condensed matter physics and modern optoelectronic technologies. In analogy to
these 3D heterostructures, a natural extension of the studies of 2D semiconductors is the
investigation of van der Waals bound heterostructures built from them [1–3]. The
techniques developed during the nanofabrication of graphene-based electronic devices
have been adapted to allow for the assembly of complex layered heterostructures. In this
section, we will consider those made with monolayer semiconductors from the family of
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). When these 2D semiconductors are placed in
contact with one another, an atomically sharp interface is formed. The close proximity
causes interlayer coupling, which can dramatically affect the electronic and optical
properties of the layers. Distinct from double quantum well structures formed by 3D
semiconductors, such 2D heterostructures inherit the valley physical properties from the
constituent monolayers. For instance, a relative rotation between the crystal axes of the
monolayers will introduce a twist angle between their valleys in momentum space,
which may allow for engineering the valley-optoelectronic properties. Here, we will
ﬁrst present the contemporary experimental results and understanding of 2D hetero-
structures without their valley functionalities. Afterwards, we will discuss the theoret-
ical background of the valley optoelectronic properties and present the current outlook
with recent experimental progress.
17.1
Fundamentals of 2D TMD Heterostructures
17.1.1
Band Alignment of MX2
The electronic properties of 2D semiconducting heterobilayers follow from their rela-
tive band alignment. Calculations of the band gaps and work functions of the monolayer
TMDs predict a staggered band alignment for these heterostructures [4–12], as is
qualitatively shown in Fig. 17.1(a). The MoX2/WX2 heterostructure (Fig. 17.1(b))
therefore manifests a type-II band alignment, with the conduction band minimum in
the monolayer MX2 and the valence band maximum in the monolayer WX2. Density
functional theory calculations show the full band structure (Fig. 17.1(c)) of the
MoX2/WX2 heterostructure with AA-type stacking and idealized lattice matching [13].
The results indicate that the band edges remain at the K points in the ﬁrst Brillouin zone,

just as in the isolated monolayers. In this idealized heterobilayer, the K points in the
MoX2 conduction band are primarily composed of the dz2 orbitals of the Mo atoms (top
layer of inset), and the valence band edges in the WX2 are composed mainly of the
1ﬃﬃ

orbitals of the W atom (bottom layer of inset) [17, 18]. Given the
spatial separation, the interlayer coupling at the K points is not expected to cause
signiﬁcant hybridization of the band edges [5, 9, 10, 16]. This is different than that seen
in the multilayers of MX2, where the band edges shift away from the K points to produce
an indirect band gap [10, 12, 14–16]. Recent micro-ARPES (angle resolved photoemission
spectroscopy) measurements on monolayer MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures have con-
ﬁrmed the above understanding on band parameters and hybridization, and determined
the valence band offset to be e300 meV [19]. In addition, scanning tunneling spectro-
scopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy have been used to determine the conduction
and valence band offsets of ~800 meV in MoS2/WSe2 heterostructures [5].

for fabricating vertically stacked 2D heterostructures [20, 21]. A typical transfer stage
for heterostructure fabrication is shown in Fig. 17.2(a). The combination of the critical
components identiﬁed in this graphic allow for precision positioning and control during
the transfer of the sample from a substrate to a polymer stamp in the following manner
(see Fig. 17.2(b)).
1.
The stamp is prepared by attaching a thin layer of polymer – such as polycarbonate
(PC) – and the identiﬁed sample on substrate is oriented and mounted to the
heating stage.
2.
The stamp is brought to within a few microns of the sample surface with the aid
of the optical microscope and manipulators. Thin ﬁlm interference allows one to
identify the lowest spot on the stamp as it nears the substrate, and the sample on
the substrate is positioned nearby.
3.
The external heater slowly raises the temperature of the heating stage. Thermal
expansion brings the sample in contact with the stamp surface in a controlled
manner.
4.
The heating stage is slowly cooled so that the polymer stamp peels away from the
substrate, taking the sample with it.
5.
The sample has now been transferred to the stamp and is ready for successive
fabrication steps.

Using this transfer technique, it is possible to assemble the MX2 heterobilayer with
control over the twisting angle between the constituent layers. In the following example,
the monolayers are obtained by exfoliation of bulk crystals onto ~280 nm SiO2 on Si
substrates. This allows for visual identiﬁcation of the monolayer samples by their
contrast using a high magniﬁcation optical microscope [22]. The optical micrographs
of a monolayer MoSe2 (top) and a monolayer WSe2 (bottom) are shown in Fig. 17.3(a).
The monolayer character of these samples can be readily veriﬁed by the room tempera-
ture photoluminescence (PL) spectrum. The sample surfaces are then characterized by
atomic-force microscopy to ensure that they are free of signiﬁcant surface contamin-
ation (Fig. 17.3(b)). Having large areas free from surface residues, these samples are
suitable for use in assembling a heterobilayer.
The crystal axes of the monolayers are then determined by analyzing the intensity
of SHG that is co-linearly polarized with the excitation source [23–25]. An example of
the polarization resolved SHG intensity as a function of the angle of the excitation
polarization is shown in Fig. 17.3(c). The peaks of the SHG intensity correspond to the
armchair axes of the crystals [23–25], and the zig-zag axes are at 30 rotation (solid
lines in Fig. 17.3(c)). Comparing the axial SHG intensity maps with in-situ optical
micrographs clearly shows that the straight edges of these two samples correspond to
the zig-zag axes of the crystal. One should be aware, however, that this technique is not
phase sensitive, so the crystal axes are only resolved to an arbitrary 60 rotation.
To assemble the heterobilayer, the top monolayer (MoSe2) is ﬁrst transferred from the
substrate (SiO2 on Si) to a PC on PDMS stamp. The monolayer orientation on the stamp
is imaged to aid in aligning the bottom layer (WSe2 on SiO2 on Si). The bottom layer is
then manipulated to the desired relative rotation and position with respect to the top
monolayer on the stamp. Computer software allows one to overlay the images to ensure

the desired positioning prior to bringing the monolayers in contact with one another.
The accuracy of this technique can be considerably enhanced by simultaneously
triangulating the positions of bulk pieces on the substrate and on the stamp. This
process is shown in Fig. 17.4, where the monolayers shown in Fig. 17.3 have been
assembled into a MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer with the crystal axes aligned (modulo 60).
A solvent rinse of the PC leaves the heterostructure on the SiO2, which is ideal for the
fabrication of electrical contacts using standard electron beam lithography.
Considering the high sensitivity of 2D material properties to surface contaminants,
the transfer process will continue to evolve towards heterostructures with pristine
interfaces. The realization of commercially viable electronic and optoelectronic hetero-
structure devices currently hinges on the scalable growth of high-quality, large area,
monolayer crystals, as well as the ability to process them into heterostructures with
high-quality interfaces. Further, the ability to control the crystal axes of each layer may
be an opportunity to engineer the optoelectronic response for tailored end-use applica-
tions. Towards this end, researchers are developing scalable growth of 2D heterostruc-
tures by vapor transport techniques [26–28], which is a promising approach for routine
synthesis for experimental studies and potential applications.
17.1.3
Ultra-fast Interlayer Charge Transfer and Photovoltaic Response
The type II band alignment of the MoX2/WX2 heterostructure (Fig. 17.5(a)) is useful for
many optoelectronic devices. For example, under photoexcitation, electrons and holes
will relax to different layers without an applied bias. This intrinsic charge separation
facilitates subsequent carrier collection, which is ideal for many photovoltaic applica-
tions. Notably, the heterostructure has an atomically sharp interface, so there is a
vanishingly small depletion region between the two layers. The signiﬁcant conduction
and valence band offsets drive ultra-fast <1 ps

determined, the bottom monolayer is rotated and positioned to achieve the desired twisting
angle and stacking conﬁguration, as shown [3]. The polymer stamp is melted onto the substrate

(60 angle) demonstrates the accuracy of the stacking procedure.

the MoSe2/MoS2 heterobilayer [29]. Further, interlayer hole transfer in the MoS2/WS2
heterobilayer was determined to be less than 50 fs using non-degenerate ultra-fast
pump–probe measurements [30]. Presently, charge transport rates have not shown
dependence on the twist angle between the layers – this possibility will be interesting
to explore in the future.
Since electrons and holes are localized in opposite layers, the 2D heterobilayer manifests
a vertical p–n junction [26, 28, 31–36]. The formation of vertical p–n junction has been
conﬁrmed experimentally by electron transport measurements showing diode-like behav-
ior [32, 34–36]. Optical absorption and PL measurements, which will be discussed in detail
in the following sections, further support this conclusion [28, 31–33, 37, 38]. Since the p–n
junction is the back-bone of modern electronic and photonic devices, such as light-emitting
diodes and photodetectors, 2D semiconductor heterostructures are naturally suitable for
nanoscale optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. Already, tunable photocurrent
generation has been demonstrated in 2D MX2/WX2 heterostructures [34–37].

(XI in Fig. 17.5(b)) [29, 31, 32, 37]. When this exciton recombines, the emitted photon
energy corresponds to the reduced band gap between the conduction band minimum in
the MoX2 and the valence band maximum in the WX2, less the interlayer exciton
binding energy. Therefore, the underlying type-II alignment makes the interlayer
exciton the lowest energy excitonic state in the system, which is readily seen from the
heterobilayer PL spectrum [26, 31, 32, 37, 38].
Here, we again use the MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer as an example. Figure 17.6(a) shows
the optical image of such a heterostructure in which the staggered stacking conﬁguration
allows the direct comparison of the PL from the MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayer to that from
isolated monolayers of WSe2 and MoSe2. Low temperature PL spectra from these three
regions are shown in Fig. 17.6(b). The PL spectra from the WSe2 and MoSe2 mono-
layers, labeled as XW and XM, respectively, are typical for monolayers of these materials
[31]. The high-energy PL from the heterobilayer resembles the summation of the PL
from the MoSe2 and WSe2 monolayer regions (Fig. 17.6(c)). This implies the band
hybridization at the K point is weak, consistent with the μ-ARPES measurement [19].

The spectrum from the heterobilayer also shows the emergence of pronounced
low-energy emission (XI at ~1.4 eV). Spatially resolved measurements show that
this low-energy emission is isolated entirely to the heterostructure region [31, 32]
(Fig. 17.6(c)). The reduced energy PL is a consequence of the reduced band gap of the
heterobilayer (cf. Fig. 17.5(a)), and is a hallmark of the interlayer exciton. The relative
energy position between interlayer and intralayer exciton implies a large binding
energy for XI, which is consistent with the small interlayer spacing (<1 nm) and the
2D nature of the heterostructures. Indeed, combining the optical spectroscopy and
μ-ARPES measurements, the binding energy of XI in the MoSe2–WSe2 heterostructure
is determined to be at least 200 meV, which is of the same order as the intralayer
exciton binding energy [19].
It is also common to see a drop in the intensity of the intralayer exciton PL from the
heterobilayer region compared to monolayers [31, 32, 34]. Figure 17.6(b) shows that the
PL of intralayer excitons are quenched on the heterostructure. This quenching of
intralayer exciton PL is a consequence of the ultra-fast interlayer charge transfer and
subsequent XI formation. The charge relaxation opens a non-radiative decay channel for
the intralayer excitons, and the substantial quenching of the intralayer exciton PL is a
consequence of the charge transfer time (< ps) being less than that for radiative decay of
intralayer excitons (~1–100 ps). Further, photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy
(PLE) shows XI PL peaks when the laser excitation energy is resonant with intralayer
excitons in monolayer WSe2 and MoSe2, which conﬁrms XI is formed from the charge
transfer between the layers [31].
17.2.2
Spatially Indirect Effects
With electron and hole located in different layers, XI is a spatially indirect exciton,
similar to those discovered in III–V coupled quantum wells [39–41]. The out-of-plane
spatial separation of the charge carriers give rise to an intrinsic out-of-plane electric-
dipole moment (illustrated in Fig. 17.7(a)). This has profound implications for the
general properties of XI and makes it distinct from the in-plane dipole nature of
intralayer excitons in monolayer TMD [42].
Electrical Tunability
One of the consequences of the out-of-plane dipole is that it couples to parallel electric
ﬁelds, allowing for control of the interlayer exciton energy with an externally applied
electric ﬁeld [31]. Figure 17.7(b) illustrates a MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure device with
both bottom- and top-gates. Here, we have used the previously described technique to
fabricate the heterobilayer with a top-gate of few-layered graphene separated by a thick
layer of boron nitride by picking up these layers before constructing the heterostructure.
The interlayer exciton PL spectrum as a function of applied gate voltage is shown in
Fig. 17.7(c), which displays a linear gate-dependent energy shift of ~80 meV. The large
and linear shift of the emission energy is consistent with the out-of-plane dipole
interacting with the vertical electric ﬁeld, i.e. a Stark shift. These effects are absent in
the isolated monolayers, where the intralayer exciton shows very little energy shift
317
17.2 Interlayer Exciton Properties

under the application of an out-of-plane electric ﬁeld [43]. In addition, this means that
variations in the interlayer spacing of the heterostructure can result in inhomogeneous
broadening of the interlayer exciton energy.
Many-Body Interactions
Another consequence of the out-of-plane electric-dipole moment is the self-energy
associated with the net repulsion of mutually aligned dipoles. Since the strength of
dipole–dipole interaction depends on the exciton–exciton separation; the interlayer
exciton energy also depends on the local exciton density. This effect is seen in the
power dependence of XI PL, which blue shifts with increasing excitation power
(corresponding to increasing exciton density) [31]. A second noticeable effect of the
dipole repulsion is the interlayer exciton in-plane motion. Higher exciton densities
cause greater in-plane velocities for the exciton center-of-mass, and few μm drift-
diffusion lengths have recently been observed in the MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructure under
pulsed laser excitation [44].
Long Lifetime
Aside from the dipole moment, the spatial separation of the electron and hole results in
reduced overlap of their wave functions. Therefore, from Fermi’s golden rule, there is a
reduced oscillator strength for the XI optical dipole transition [13]. This spatially
indirect nature, combined with indirect momentum (discussed in next section), results
in dramatically enhanced lifetimes for interlayer exciton [31, 44] when compared with
their intralayer counterparts ðe10 psÞ [45–48]. Lifetimes of ~100 ns have been recently
reported in high-quality samples [44]. The relatively long lifetime not only causes the
saturation of the interlayer exciton PL at very low excitation power [31], but also allows
for the long-range drift-diffusion in the 2D plane [44]. This long lifetime is important

such as excitonic superﬂuidity and condensation [49].
17.3
Valley Optoelectronic Properties of 2D Heterostructures
So far, we can see that XI is an analog to spatially indirect excitons in double quantum
well structures formed by bulk III–V semiconductors. However, heterostructures of 2D
crystals possess novel properties beyond the conventional III–V heterostructures [44].
The distinct physical properties arise from valley degeneracy of the conduction and
valence band edges at the hexagonal Brillouin zone (BZ) corners and the valley-
dependent physics of the constituent monolayers. As two monolayers stack together,
a twist angle can be created between the two layers (Fig. 17.8(a)). Such a twist angle in
the real-space will lead to a concentric rotation of the hexagonal BZ of one layer with
respect to the other layer (Fig. 17.8(b)). In addition, the difference in lattice parameter
between MoX2 and WX2 corresponds to a difference in the reciprocal lattice vectors, so
the size of the BZ is different for each layer. Either the twisting or the lattice mismatch
inevitably results in a misalignment of the BZ corners between the layers. In the context
of interlayer excitons in the heterobilayer, this corresponds to a momentum mismatch
between the electron and hole dispersion minima, which has a signiﬁcant impact for the
light coupling of the interlayer exciton, such as dynamics, optical selection rules, and
valley-dependent phenomena, as described below.

conﬁguration as that with both the monolayer crystal axes aligned and with the metal
atom in the lower layer as the origin, the stacking conﬁguration of the heterostructure
may be entirely characterized by the following: a translation r to the transition metal
atom in the top layer, a rotation 0 < θ < 60 of the top lattice with respect to the
bottom lattice (Fig. 17.9), and the lattice constants for the bottom ab

monolayers.
Following the work of Yu, Wang, Tong, Xu, and Yao [13], we treat the interlayer
coupling as a perturbation to determine the light coupling properties of the interlayer
exciton. The basis states are taken as the Bloch states in the upper and lower
monolayers in the absence of interlayer coupling, while the latter causes off-diagonal
couplings between the basis states are treated perturbatively. Since we are primarily
concerned with the optical properties of the interlayer exciton when the twisting angle
is small, we will focus on electrons and holes near the band edges, located at the
corners of the hexagonal BZs of the two layers. We will denote the inequivalent
valleys as τK and τ0K0, where τ ¼ 1 is the valley index and the unprimed (primed)
variables represent the bottom (top) layer of the heterobilayer. In the bottom mono-
layer, the low-energy conduction

Finite Velocity Light Cones
The interlayer valley excitons can couple to light in the presence of interlayer coupling.
Before giving the details, we ﬁrst analyze the constraint on the light coupling imposed
by momentum conservation. An electron–hole pair at their kinetic energy minima can
no longer recombine if they do not overlap in the momentum space. However, the
momentum mismatch between the minima can be compensated for by the ﬁnite kinetic
momentum of the electron and hole. As shown in Fig. 17.10(a), the electron–hole

where α and β are the weighted coefﬁcients of the direct interlayer exciton emission

The essential result now is that XQ, τ0, τ


may couple with photons with general
elliptical polarization, without the assistance of phonon or impurity scattering at the
ﬁnite velocity light cones Q. Considering the underlying ^C3 rotational symmetry of the
interlayer exciton states, the elliptical polarization at Q0, ^C3Q0, and ^C2
3Q0 are also ^C3
rotations of each other. Therefore, without mutual quantum coherence, the sum of
emission from these three light cones combines to produce light with a ﬁnite degree
of circular polarization but no linear polarization. The light cones Q0, ^C3Q0, and
^C2
3Q0 are the time reversal counterparts of the above three where the excitons have the
opposite valley conﬁguration, and the elliptical polarization also has the opposite
helicity.
17.3.5
Valley Functionalities of Interlayer Excitons
At each light cone, we see that the major axis of the elliptical polarization is locked to Q
(see Fig. 17.12(a) for an illustration), which also corresponds to the kinematic momen-
tum of the interlayer exciton at the light cone. This means that the ﬁnite-velocity light
cones not only allow for the optical injection of valley polarization, but this absorption
will also produce a valley-dependent exciton current. This results from the fact that light
cones for different valley conﬁgurations not only correspond to different polarizations,
but also different in-plane velocity of the interlayer exciton. For example, under
excitation by a linearly polarized light, each of the light cones will absorb at different
rates depending on their elliptical polarization, which results in a net valley current, as
shown in Fig. 17.12(a). The long lifetime and long-range drift-diffusion of the interlayer
exciton may further allow for demonstrations of valley Hall effects through the obser-
vation of the spatial proﬁle of the polarization (cf. Fig. 17.12(b)). Additionally, the
324

optical injection of valley current induces a number current in the perpendicular
direction due to Berry curvature effects, i.e. the inverse valley Hall effect shown in
Fig. 17.12(c).
17.4
Outlook
This theoretical framework illustrates the unique valley-dependent physical properties
of interlayer excitons in TMD heterobilayers. This points to exciting opportunities
based on 2D heterostructures for optoelectronics with valley functionalities. Notably,
the most recent measurements in MoSe2/WSe2 heterostructures with nearly aligned
crystal axes show the promise of this direction. Circularly polarized interlayer exciton
PL is observed by circularly polarized optical pumping, demonstrating the optical
generation of valley-polarized interlayer exciton. Time and polarization resolved PL
reveals the valley polarization life time of ~40 ns [44], many orders of magnitude longer
than that in monolayers. This long valley lifetime is a consequence of the spatially
indirect nature of XI, which suppresses the intravalley electron–hole exchange
interaction, a main cause of the valley depolarization of intralayer excitons. The long
lifetime also enables the observation of drift-diffusion of valley degrees of freedom in
the 2D plane, with the spatial pattern of polarization evolving from a disk to a ring
pattern as a function of optical excitation intensity, implying fascinating valley-
dependent many-body interaction effects [44].
Based on the theoretical predictions, we anticipate future work on interlayer valley
exciton properties as a function of twist angle of fundamental scientiﬁc interest. These
properties include the evolution of optical selection rules, the exciton and valley
polarization life times, interlayer charge/spin transport dynamics, and in-plane exciton
transport. Realization of valley functionalities, such as interlayer valley exciton Hall
effects and optical injection of valley current, would be challenging but intriguing. The
understanding of the fundamental properties will be important for studying exciton

TMDs – Optoelectronic Devices
Thomas Mueller
18.1
Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer properties that complement those of
graphene. Graphene is a semimetal with high carrier mobility and peculiar electrical
transport behavior, but the lack of a band gap hampers its use in many optoelectronic
applications such as lasers or photovoltaics. In contrast, semiconducting TMDs (in
particular, MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, WSe2, MoTe2, and WTe2) possess a sizeable band
gap of the order of 1–2.5 eV. A layer-dependent indirect-to-direct band-gap transi-
tion was observed in these materials, which resulted in bright photoluminescence
from monolayers, whereas photoluminescence from bulk was found to be practically
absent [1, 2]. The reported photoluminescence quantum yields are still poor. Likely,
unintentional doping and crystal defects play a major role in suppressing the
luminescence. The room temperature yield of monolayer MoS2, for example, was
found to be [1] 4  10–3. In transition metal selenides, yields an order of magnitude
better were obtained [3, 4].
The optical properties of ultra-thin TMDs are dominated by excitonic rather
than band-to-band transitions. Excitons are strongly bound in two-dimensional (2D)
materials due to reduced dielectric screening and enhanced electron–hole interactions.
Several excitonic transitions can be observed, where the two lowest energy peaks,
known as A and B-excitons, arise from optical transitions between the valence bands
with strong spin–orbit splitting and the weakly split conduction bands. [1] The exciton
binding energies of mono- and few-layer TMDs have been determined by various
experimental and theoretical techniques [5–11]. The binding energies increase with
decreasing material thickness and are typically of the order of ~0.5 eV in monolayers.
Excitons in 2D semiconductors are thus stable at room temperature and dominate the
optical and optoelectronic properties. The strong exciton conﬁnement in TMDs further
results in short radiative lifetimes, of the order of tens of picoseconds, which should
enable light emission with high modulation bandwidth.
The band structure of TMD monolayers exhibits two non-equivalent valleys, K and
K0, located at the corners of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. The broken inversion symmetry in
TMD monolayers, together with time reversal symmetry, gives rise to spin–valley
coupling, i.e. the sign of the hole spin is opposed in the K and K0 valleys. This leads
to valley-dependent optical selection rules for interband transitions: right-handed
circularly polarized light only couples to the K-valley; left-handed circularly polarized

light couples to the K0-valley [12, 13]. The ability to control and detect the valley
polarization, not only optically but also electrically, could provide a basis for
constructing a new generation of valley-dependent optoelectronic devices for
information processing.
18.2
Light-Emitting Diodes and Lasers
Electroluminescence is the generation of light by a current passing through an electronic
device. It is the result of radiative recombination of electron–hole pairs (or excitons) in a
semiconductor and forms the basis of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and semiconductor
lasers. Radiative recombination occurs much more efﬁciently in direct band-gap
semiconductors than in indirect gap materials, which is why TMD monolayers are
usually preferred over multi-layers or bulk. Nevertheless, some works have reported
strong electroluminescence in multi-layer TMDs, either by carrier redistribution from
the indirect to the direct valleys in a high electric ﬁeld [14] or by inducing a very
high carrier concentration to ﬁll the indirect valleys in the conduction and valence
bands [15].
18.2.1
Hot-Carrier Electroluminescence
Electroluminescence from a 2D semiconductor was ﬁrst reported by Sundaram et al.
[16] by driving a unipolar (electron) current through a MoS2 monolayer and exploiting
hot-carrier processes for electron–hole pair (exciton) generation. Under high drain-
source bias, strong band bending occurs at the metal contacts of a TMD ﬁeld-effect
transistor. Electrons that are injected from the contact into the semiconductor are
accelerated by the electric ﬁeld. If these electrons acquire a kinetic energy that is larger
than the MoS2 band gap before being scattered by phonons, electron–hole pairs can be
generated via impact excitation. This process is known to be very efﬁcient in low-
dimensional systems due to the strong electron–hole interactions [17, 18]. The large
exciton binding energy in low-dimensional materials prevents the excitons from being
dissociated by the strong electric ﬁeld. Characteristic features of impact excitation are a
threshold behavior of the electroluminescence (electrons need to acquire a kinetic
energy of at least e1:5Eg, where Eg is the semiconductor band gap) and the exponential
increase of the emission above threshold [17]. Spatial mapping of the light emission
conﬁrmed that the electroluminescence is localized near the metal-semiconductor inter-
face where the electric ﬁeld is highest. The electroluminescence efﬁciency was esti-
mated to be 105, and the emission peaked at the MoS2 A-exciton wavelength in
accordance with photoluminescence measurements.
18.2.2
Light-Emitting Diodes
LEDs are based on semiconductor p–n junctions, in which both electrons and holes are
injected. Both types of carriers recombine radiatively, releasing energy in the form of
photons. This process is thresholdless and more efﬁcient than electron–hole pair
generation by impact excitation. In a traditional LED, the semiconductor material is

doped with impurities to create the p- and n-regions. As stable chemical doping is
currently difﬁcult to achieve in TMDs, electrostatic doping was used by Pospischil et al.
[19], Baugher et al. [20], and Ross et al. [21] to realize TMD monolayer p–n junctions.
In these devices, split-gate electrodes couple to two different regions of a TMD, as
illustrated in Fig. 18.1(a). By biasing one gate electrode with a positive voltage and the
other with a negative voltage, electrons and holes, respectively, are drawn into the
transistor channel and a lateral junction is formed. As ambipolar electrical transport
behavior is difﬁcult to achieve in MoS2 monolayers, and has as yet only been accom-
plished using ionic liquid gating [22], WSe2 monolayers were employed in [19–21].
Applying voltages of opposite polarities to the gate electrodes led to diode-like current
rectiﬁcation, whereas applying voltages of same polarity resulted in resistive behavior.
The devices also showed a photovoltaic effect under illumination. By driving a forward
current through the electrostatically deﬁned junction, electroluminescence emission was
obtained. The emission occurred at the same wavelength as the photoluminescence in
the near infrared spectral regime (~750 nm), indicating that electrons and holes form
excitons before radiative recombination. Electroluminescence in such devices was
measureable at injection currents as low as [21] 200 pA and with efﬁciencies of
0.1%, mainly limited by resistive losses at the contacts and non-radiative recombin-
ation. The spectral weight of emission from the neutral and charged excitons was found
to be tunable by the bias current [21]. Similar studies, performed with ionic liquid gated
WS2, yielded visible light emission at ~630 nm wavelength [23].
18.2.3
3D/2D van der Waals Heterojunctions
Devices based on vertical structures, in which the current ﬂow is perpendicular to the
2D layers, have also been demonstrated. The vertical heterostructure design allows
the performance to be improved in several respects: (i) reduced contact resistance due to
the larger contact area, (ii) higher current densities which allows for brighter emission,
(iii) luminescence from the whole device area, and (iv) easier scalability. Vertical
structures can be fabricated by stacking of 2D materials in a layered conﬁguration on
top of each other, or on top of a traditional 3D semiconductor such as silicon. The van
der Waals interaction between the 2D (or 2D and 3D) materials keeps the heterostack
together. Electrically driven light emission from vertical 3D/2D heterojunctions
(Fig. 18.1(b)) was demonstrated by Ye et al. [24] and Lopez-Sanchez et al. [25]. Their
devices were composed of a MoS2 monolayer, which is intrinsically n-doped, and a
p-doped silicon wafer. The p-doped silicon served as a hole injection layer into MoS2,
whereas electrons were injected into MoS2 through a standard metal contact. Light
emission occurred across the entire face of the junction [25]. The electroluminescence
originated from excitons related to the optical transitions between the conduction and
valence bands in MoS2. Both A- and B-excitons were observed, with the B-exciton
likely being excited by impact excitation. Radiative emission from silicon was not
observed due to its indirect band gap. In addition, bound-exciton related emission
features were identiﬁed and, at a high injection rates, exciton–exciton annihilation
[26] of the bound excitons was studied [24]. Another work utilized p-doped GaN to
inject holes into n-type MoS2 for light emission [14].

2D van der Waals Heterostructures
Figure 18.1(c) schematically depicts the architecture of a van der Waals heterojunction
that is entirely composed of 2D materials [27]. It was made by stacking of metallic
(graphene, Gr), insulating (hexagonal boron nitride, h-BN) and semiconducting (TMD
monolayers, WS2 or MoS2) 2D crystals, to realize a vertical LED. In this device,
electrons and holes are injected into a TMD monolayer from two graphene electrodes.
Thin boron nitride layers to both sides of the TMD serve to reduce the direct tunneling
between the graphene sheets, resulting in electron and hole accumulation in the
semiconductor. Electroluminescence emission was obtained above a threshold that
can be associated with the alignment of the top and bottom graphene Fermi levels
with the TMD conduction and valence band edges, respectively. The electrolumin-
escence emission wavelength was found to be similar to that of the photoluminescence
emission from negatively charged excitons, suggesting more efﬁcient electron than hole

injection. An external quantum efﬁciency of more than 1% was obtained – ten times
larger than that of the planar p–n diodes. This improvement most likely is due to the
lower contact resistance. The quantum efﬁciency was further improved by stacking of
multiple devices in the series. At low temperature, efﬁciencies of up to 8.4% were
reported, comparable to those of state-of-the-art organic LEDs. Also samples on elastic
and transparent substrates were prepared, demonstrating the capability of such devices
for ﬂexible and semitransparent optoelectronics.
18.2.5
Lasing in TMDs
It has been shown that coupling a TMD light emitter to an optical cavity can signiﬁ-
cantly enhance the spontaneous emission rate due to the Purcell effect [28, 29]. Using
cavities with a high-quality factor, Wu et al. [30], Salehzadeh et al. [31], and Ye et al.
[32] demonstrated that sufﬁcient optical gain can be provided in a TMD by optical
pumping to compensate for the cavity losses and to achieve lasing. A photonic crystal
cavity (Fig. 18.2) was utilized in [30], whereas microdisk cavities were employed in
[31] and [32]. Both cavity designs offer the potential for ultra-low threshold lasing,
and continuous-wave operation, and an optical pumping threshold as low as 27 nW at
130 K was reported [30]. Hallmark features of a laser are the abrupt changes of the slope
of the output light intensity and the emission linewidth around the lasing threshold.
Both features were indeed observed, but photon statistics measurements still need to
be demonstrated.

Photovoltaic Devices
Photovoltaic cells allow the conversion of sun energy into electricity. Typically, inor-
ganic or organic semiconductors are used, but also TMDs have long been considered

for photovoltaics, because of their band gaps in the visible part of the electromagnetic
spectrum and their strong optical absorption [33]. From a technological standpoint,
abundance of source materials, chemical stability, environmental sustainability, and low
cost of production are essential requirements. All these demands can potentially be
fulﬁlled by TMDs, making them interesting candidates for ﬂexible thin ﬁlm solar cells.
The electronic band gap in 2D semiconductors is higher than the optical gap due to
the weak screening and large exciton binding energies. As in organic solar cells,
photogenerated excitons must thus disassociate into free carriers to generate a current.
Theoretical studies of graphene/MoS2 [34] and WS2/MoS2 [35] (all monolayers)
heterojunction solar cells have suggested achievable power conversion efﬁciencies of
~1%, limited by the low optical absorption of the ultra-thin materials. Absorption
enhancement using plasmonics or vertical stacking of 2D layers will thus be necessary
for these devices to become competitive with other technologies.
18.3.1
Lateral p–n and Schottky Junctions
The photovoltaic properties of bulk TMDs have been studied experimentally since the
1980s [33]. The photovoltaic properties of monolayers were studied only recently using
p–n and Schottky junctions. When biased in diode conﬁguration, the device presented
in Fig. 18.1(a) showed a photovoltaic response [19, 20]. As expected, the electrical
device characteristics were not affected by light when the device was operated as
resistor. Despite the low optical absorption of the monolayer material, power conversion
efﬁciencies (the percentage of the incident light energy that is converted into electrical
energy) of ~0.5% were obtained, comparable to those reported for the early bulk devices
[33]. For a similar device layout with multi-layer MoSe2, power conversion efﬁciencies
surpassing 5% and ﬁll factors of 70% were reported [36]. Similar experiments were
performed using other 2D semiconductors, such as black phosphorus [37]. Multi-
junction solar cells could hence potentially be constructed by stacking of 2D materials
with different band gaps, which would allow for more efﬁcient absorption of the solar
spectrum without losses due to carrier thermalization. Lateral built-in ﬁelds in 2D
semiconductors also occur at Schottky junctions. Fontana et al. [38] studied MoS2
ﬁeld-effect transistors with two different contact metals – palladium and gold. Upon
illumination, photogenerated electron–hole pairs were separated by the built-in potential
from the space charge regions at the contacts. Electrons accumulated on the gold
contacts and holes on the palladium side, which gave rise to an open circuit voltage
and a sizeable photovoltaic effect.
18.3.2
2D van der Waals Heterostructures
Although experimental studies of lateral junctions have shown encouraging results, the
complex electrode arrangement does not allow for easy scalability for which a vertical
geometry would be desirable. Such vertical heterostructures can be obtained by stacking
of 2D materials in a layered conﬁguration to realize a van der Waals heterostructure.
Photovoltaic effects in TMD van der Waals heterojunctions were ﬁrst demonstrated by
Furchi et al. [39], Lee et al. [40], and Cheng et al. [41]. The device structure is depicted
in Fig. 18.3(a). The electron afﬁnity (the energy required to excite an electron from the

bottom of the conduction band into the vacuum) of MoS2 is larger than that of WSe2.
The lowest energy electron states are thus spatially located in the MoS2 layer and the
highest-energy hole states lie in the WSe2, forming a type-II heterojunction (schematic
energy band diagram in the inset of Fig. 18.3(a)). Photoluminescence studies and
optical pump/probe measurements conﬁrmed efﬁcient and ultra-fast charge transfer
between TMDs with almost 100% efﬁciency and <100 fs transfer time [39, 40, 42–44].
The electrical characteristic of the device can be controlled by electrostatic doping,
and, for a certain gate voltage, a vertical p–n junction is formed. The device current as
a function of bias voltage displays diode-like rectiﬁcation behavior, consistent with the
type-II band alignment. The rectiﬁcation behavior of a van der Waals heterojunction
diode, however, is of different origin than that of a conventional 3D semiconductor
diode. Two mechanisms contribute to the current. Forward biasing the diode drives

electrons (holes) in MoS2 (WSe2) to the heterojunction, where they may either overcome
the conduction (valence) band offsets to be injected into the neighboring layer and
diffuse to the contacts, or recombine so that a continuous current is maintained. Whereas
in an ideal diode the ﬁrst process dominates, it has been suggested that in atomically thin
p–n junctions the latter is more important [40]. Due to the absence of a depletion region
in ultra-thin heterojunctions, majority carriers (electrons in MoS2 and holes in WSe2) are
in close proximity to each other, which gives rise to strong interlayer carrier recombin-
ation [39, 40]. Forward biasing the junction leads to an accumulation of majority carriers
and enhances the recombination current, whereas depletion under reverse bias reduces
recombination. Figure 18.3(a) (right panel) shows the photovoltaic response of the
junction under white-light optical illumination. Photons are absorbed in WSe2 and
MoS2, resulting in electron–hole pairs (excitons) in both layers. Relaxation of the
photogenerated carriers then occurs, driven by the type-II band offsets. The relaxed
carriers diffuse to the contacts, resulting in a photocurrent. Interlayer recombination
occurs during diffusion, which reduces the efﬁciency of the solar cell. Power conversion
efﬁciency and ﬁll factor were estimated to be 0.2% and 50%, respectively. It was shown
that better efﬁciency can be achieved by sandwiching the semiconductor junction
between graphene electrodes. This arrangement allows for vertical carrier extraction
which reduces the losses due to diffusion (Fig. 18.3(b)) [40]. Photovoltaic effects in van
der Waals heterojunctions were also demonstrated with other material combinations,
such as MoS2/black phosphorus [45] or MoSe2/WSe2 [46].
Vertical p–n junctions have also been fabricated from a single TMD material using
plasma-assisted doping and from MoS2/Si type-II heterojunctions. Wi et al. [47] treated
a multilayer MoS2 ﬂake, which is intrinsically n-type, with a plasma species to induce
p-doping in the top MoS2 layers. A vertically stacked Au/p-MoS2/n-MoS2/ITO photo-
voltaic cell was then fabricated and power conversion efﬁciencies of up to 2.8% were
achieved. Tsai et al. [48] utilized the built-in ﬁeld generated at the interface between
p-doped Si and a n-MoS2 monolayer, and reported an efﬁciency of 5.2%. A major
outstanding challenge remains the scaling of TMD-based photovoltaic devices to
macroscopic dimensions.
18.4
Photodetectors
Photodetectors convert light into electrical signals. The diversity of applications, ranging
from optical communications to imaging and sensing, require a wide range of different
technologies and materials. Most commercially available photodetectors are based on
elemental or compound semiconductors, but with growing demand for devices that offer
ﬂexibility, semitransparency, and easy integrability with passive optical components
(e.g. optical waveguides), the need for alternative photodetection materials is becoming
more eminent. Although graphene photodetectors are being envisaged for applications in
high-speed optical communications and long-wavelength (e.g. terahertz and mid infra-
red) detection, TMDs offer properties that complement those of graphene. In particular,
TMDs are advantageous for applications that require high sensitivity and low dark

currents, though they work mainly in the visible and near infrared spectral regions.
Broadly speaking, three groups of TMD-based photodetectors have been investigated:
(i) lateral metal–TMD–metal detectors, whose device structure resembles that of TMD
ﬁeld-effect transistors, (ii) hybrid devices that utilize sensitizing centers, such as quantum
dots that absorb light, followed by charge transfer into the TMD transistor channel, and
(iii) van der Waals heterostructure devices, in which few-layer TMD semiconductors are
sandwiched between optically transparent (graphene) electrodes.
18.4.1
Metal–TMD–Metal Photodetectors
Figure 18.4(a) depicts a device structure that has been employed by a number of groups
for photodetection applications based on various 2D semiconductors, including
MoS2, WSe2, WS2, GaSe, GaTe, GaS, In2Se3, black phosphorus, and others [49–62].
Photoresponsivities of up to 2200 A/W and high photogain were reported for some of
these devices. The photoresponsivity R ¼ Iph=Popt is one of the most important ﬁgures-
of-merit of a photodetector and measures the electrical output current Iph per optical
input power Popt. The term photogain, or photoconductive gain, refers to the fact that
the number of circuit electrons generated per photoexcited electron–hole pair can be
larger than one. Wavelength-dependent studies have shown that the photocurrent
follows the TMD’s absorption spectrum. Further, it was suggested that the spectral
response of TMD photodetectors can be adjusted using 2D layers of different

thicknesses. For example, MoS2 mono- and bi-layers are effective for detecting green
visible light, whereas triple-layer MoS2 is better suited for red light detection [51].
Studies have also extended beyond mechanically exfoliated samples to chemical vapor
deposition grown TMD devices [51].
In general, a number of physical mechanisms can give rise to photocurrent generation
in a TMD ﬁeld-effect transistor. Similar to graphene, photoelectric [55] and photother-
moelectric [63] contributions were identiﬁed under short-circuit operation (i.e. without
drain-source bias) using scanning photocurrent microscopy. The photoelectric effect
relies on the separation of photoexcited electron–hole pairs in the built-in electric ﬁeld
of a lateral [19, 20] or vertical [39–41] p–n junction, or a Schottky barrier at the
interface between a 2D semiconductor and a metal contact [38, 55]. The electric ﬁeld
may also be produced, or enhanced, by means of an external voltage. In addition, optical
illumination of the metal–semiconductor contacts can produce a photovoltage as a result
of the photothermoelectric (Seebeck) effect [63]. Both effects lead to moderate respon-
sivities of the order of tens of mA/W.
Much larger responsivities have been obtained via internal ampliﬁcation of the
current by applying an external drain-source voltage and such devices can operate on
homogeneous TMD sheets, without the need to introduce a junction or built-in ﬁeld.
The photocurrent is then given as the difference between drain-source current under
illumination and dark current, Iph ¼ ID,illum  ID,dark: Typically, photogain results from
capturing of photoexcited carriers into trap states that are present either in the under-
lying substrate (in most cases SiO2) or in the TMD itself. The former is exacerbated by
the high surface-to-volume ratio of the 2D transistor channel, and substrate surface
treatments have been shown to modify this effect [50]. Trapped charge can inﬂuence the
conductance of a TMD transistor channel in two ways. (i) It can change the transistor
threshold voltage from Vth in the dark to Vth  ΔVth under optical illumination. This
effect is referred to as the photogating effect and has been studied extensively in organic
ﬁeld-effect transistors. As a result of the threshold voltage shift, the photocurrent
becomes Iph ¼ ID VG  Vth þ ΔVth
ð
Þ  ID VG  Vth
ð
Þ  gm ΔVth, where gm is the tran-
sistor’s transconductance and VG is the gate voltage. (ii) Optical excitation increases the
conductivity Δσ due to photoinduced excess carriers, Iph ¼ W=L
ð
ÞVD Δσ, where W and
L are the device dimensions and VD is the applied drain-source voltage. This is called
the photoconductive effect. It can be shown that in the presence of traps with density
pt, Δσ is by the amount eμpt higher than what would be expected without traps [56]
(e denotes the electron charge and μ is the carrier mobility). In general, the photo-
response will be a combination of both mechanisms. Measurements, performed by
Furchi et al. [56] on MoS2, showed striking similarity between Iph and gm, suggesting
that the photogating effect dominates the response with a responsivity of ~103 A/W. At
illumination intensities of the order of ~1 nW, the trap states get ﬁlled, resulting in
saturation of the photoresponse. Response times were found to be slow, extending from
one second to even tens of seconds depending on surface treatments. In addition to the
photogating effect, a faster (and weaker) response was identiﬁed and attributed to the
photoconductive component [56]. Measurements were performed at kHz frequencies
to suppress the slow photogating effect. At low incident optical power, a responsivity

of 6 A/W was obtained, corresponding to a photoconductive gain of ~100. The gain was
attributed to valence band tail states, induced by disorder or structural defects, into
which photoexcited holes are trapped. Charge neutrality then requires the external
circuit to provide additional electrons until recombination with the trapped holes occurs.
18.4.2
Hybrid Photodetectors
Photogain can also be accomplished by integration of 2D semiconductors with other
materials to produce a hybrid phototransistor. This was ﬁrst demonstrated by Konstan-
tatos et al. by sensitizing the surface of a graphene transistor with lead sulﬁde (PbS)
quantum dots [64]. Light absorption in the PbS quantum dots leads to charge transfer to
the graphene sheet, which effectively modiﬁes graphene’s conductance. A similar
concept was demonstrated Roy et al. [65], who employed MoS2 instead of quantum
dots as the photoactive material. Although ultra-high responsivities of 107–1010 A/W
were achieved in those devices, they also suffered from high dark currents and large
power consumption because of the semimetallic character of graphene. To reduce the
dark current, Kufer et al. [66] replaced the graphene channel with MoS2, whose
semiconducting behavior provided the possibility of turning off the transistor by
applying an appropriate back-gate voltage (Fig. 18.4(b)). Light is absorbed in the PbS
quantum dots and photoexcited carriers are separated at the PbS–MoS2 interface. While
holes remain trapped in the dots, electrons circulate through the MoS2 channel driven by
the applied bias voltage. As the light absorption takes place in the quantum dots, the
spectral response can be engineered and can also extend into the infrared, where TMDs
are not absorbing. The hybrid PbS–MoS2 detector showed a responsivity of up to 106
A/W, and a low dark current which resulted in a detectivity of almost 1015 Jones,
comparable to state-of-the-art compound semiconductor photodetectors for the investi-
gated (near infrared) wavelength range.
18.4.3
Van der Waals Heterostructure Devices
2D materials can be assembled layer by layer to form van der Waals heterostructure
photodetectors [67]. The surfaces of 2D materials display no dangling bonds and the
absence of lattice matching conditions in van der Waals heterostructures permits
combining any arbitrary sequence of layered materials. Heterostructure photodetec-
tors, comprising vertical stacks of graphene–TMD–graphene layers, have been dem-
onstrated by Britnell et al. [68] and Yu et al. [69]. In these devices (Fig. 18.4(c)),
graphene was employed as a work function-tunable electrode, whereas a TMD
semiconductor was utilized as a photoactive material, showing strong light–matter
interactions and photon absorption. The Fermi levels in graphene can be positioned by
asymmetric electrostatic or chemical doping of the top and bottom graphene sheets, so
that a built-in electric ﬁeld is produced even when applying an external voltage. Upon
illumination, photogenerated carriers are separated in the TMD layer and collected
within a short distance by the graphene electrodes. The photocurrent was mapped
by scanning photocurrent microscopy, and it was veriﬁed that the photocurrent
was generated across the whole graphene–TMD–graphene junction. The measured

responsivities were of the order of 0.1 A/W, which is comparable to state-of-the-art
bulk semiconductor ﬂexible membranes [70, 71].
18.5
Valley-Dependent Optoelectronic Devices
Excitonic transitions in monolayer TMDs are associated not only with the spin degree
of freedom but also the valley degree of freedom [72]. Valley-dependent optoelec-
tronic devices exploit the conﬁnement of charge carriers in the K and K0 valleys for
novel functionalities. All-optical generation and detection of valley polarizations in
TMD crystals has been demonstrated by several groups [12, 13] but demonstrations of
electro-optical devices are still rare. In the following, we discuss some ﬁrst steps in
this direction.
18.5.1
Spin–Valley-Polarized LED
Zhang et al. fabricated multi-layer WSe2 p–n junctions with the p- and n-regions
deﬁned using electric double-layer gating [15]. Electric double layers, formed at
solid-electrolyte interfaces, are capable of inducing very large gate ﬁelds, resulting in
carrier accumulations in the 2D channel that can be more than an order of magnitude
higher than that achieved with solid dielectrics. As a result, the induced carrier density is
sufﬁciently high to populate the direct gap K and K0 valleys and achieve light emission
in the multi-layer TMD. The strong gate ﬁeld also breaks the inversion symmetry of
multi-layers and recovers the valley circular dichroism that is otherwise only present in
monolayers. The electroluminescence spectra of the p–n junction for opposite current
ﬂow directions were taken and the light polarization was analyzed. The electrolumin-
escence was found to be circularly polarized, where the polarization can be controlled
with current ﬂow direction. If the device is operated as a p–n diode and the current is
driven from right to left, as shown in the upper left image of Fig. 18.5(a), the left-handed
circularly polarized light emission σ
ð
Þ dominates over the right-handed emission σþ
ð
Þ.
On the other hand, if the current ﬂow direction is reversed (n–p diode; bottom left
image), the σþ polarization dominates over σ. The degree of circular polarization
reaches values as high as 45%, comparable to that of photoluminescence from mono-
layers. To understand this behavior, we recall that circularly polarized luminescence in
TMDs occurs when the K and K0 valleys are populated differently with electron–hole
pairs. It was suggested that the electron–hole overlap can be controlled by the in-plane
electric ﬁeld of the 2D diode. Under an in-plane ﬁeld, the hole and electron distributions
in momentum space are shifted from their equilibrium positions in the direction of the
ﬁeld (holes) or the opposite to them (electrons). These shifts are depicted in Fig. 18.5(a)
by the contours of the electron and hole distributions in momentum space. The
electron–hole overlaps, represented by the shaded areas, differ in the K and K0 valleys.
This is because of the trigonal distortions of the band structure around the K point –
especially that of the valence band. The trigonal warping effect provides a luminescence
intensity difference between both valleys, leading to circularly polarized emissions.
Similar effects were also observed in other TMDs such as MoSe2 and MoS2 [15].

18.5.2
Spin–Valley-Polarized Photovoltage/Current Generation
Due to the broken inversion symmetry in TMD monolayers, carriers in the K and K0
valleys experience effective magnetic ﬁelds with opposite signs that allow for the
generation of valley-polarization by circularly polarized optical pumping [72]. Accord-
ingly, when a TMD monolayer is electrically biased, the carriers in the K and K0 valleys
experience opposite Lorentz-like forces and are deﬂected in opposite directions perpen-
dicular to the current ﬂow (Fig. 18.5(b), upper image). This phenomenon is analogous
to the spin Hall effect and is called the valley Hall effect. To demonstrate the valley Hall
effect in a TMD monolayer, Mak et al. [73] measured the photovoltage produced by
circularly polarized light in a MoS2 Hall bar. The sign of the Hall voltage in monolayers
could indeed be controlled by the helicity of the light, whereas no effect was observed in
(inversion symmetric) bilayer devices (Fig. 18.5(b), lower image). Other works demon-
strated the generation of spin–valley-coupled circular photogalvanic currents in a WSe2
electric double-layer transistor [74] and a CVD grown MoS2 phototransistor [75].

Synthesis of Transition Metal
Dichalcogenides
Yumeng Shi and Lain-Jong Li
19.1
Introduction
Novel properties and new phenomena that arise from two-dimensional (2D) materials
have stimulated huge research interest recently. Among the 2D material family, semi-
conducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with an intrinsic band gap are
complementary to the gapless graphene [1, 2]. Hence, both single-layer and multi-layer
TMDCs are promising candidates for high-performance electronic [3–7] and optoelec-
tronic [8–14] applications. The thickness uniformity and the lateral size of a single
domain are important concerns for the exploration of the properties, function, and
fabrication of electronic devices. Considerable efforts have been made in the synthesis
of 2D semiconducting TMDCs, and the main theme focuses on large-scale growth of
single crystalline monolayers and their heterostructures.
Various methods have been developed for the large-scale production of monolayer
and few-layer TMDC nanosheets, including the top-down layer exfoliation from bulk
crystals [15–19] and the bottom-up chemical synthesis. Among all the approaches, the
liquid phase exfoliation of TMDC layers from their bulk crystals generates a range of
well-dispersed TMDC monolayers with a high yield [20]. This method has immense
potential for solution-based printable and ﬂexible electronics. However, the wet chem-
ical method may unavoidably alter the lattice structure of thin TMDC layers and
introduce extrinsic defects during the exfoliation process. It is essential to develop a
synthetic technique that can produce wafer-scale TMDC materials that are also compat-
ible with the current nanoelectronic fabrication processes. Considerable efforts have
been made in developing controllable synthesis of 2D semiconducting TMDCs. Several
synthetic routes, including thermolysis of thiosalts [21, 22], sulfurization (or seleniza-
tion) of metal (or metal oxide) thin ﬁlms [23], physical vapor phase transport [24], and
chemical vapour deposition (CVD) [25], have been developed. Among all these
methods, vapor phase deposition shows great promise towards high-quality TMDC
production [1]. With this technique, monolayer TMDCs that have single domains with
scalable size, controllable thickness, and excellent electronic properties can be obtained.
In addition, the electro-dispersive properties and the semiconducting nature of TMDCs
can be tailored by tuning the synthesis conditions. Remarkably, vapor phase deposition
can also be employed to synthesize TMDC ternary alloys, in-plane heterostructures, and
multilayer van der Waals stackings, which pave the way for exploring new devices and
physics based on 2D materials.

19.2
Mechanism of Growth
Controllable synthesis for TMDCs are critically important since the uniformity in
thickness and lateral domain size are major concerns for the fabrication of electronic
devices [26, 27]. TMDCs are atomically thin-layered materials with a transition metal
atom sandwiched between two layers of chalcogen atoms. The atomically ﬂat-layered
structures of TMDCs enable their heteroepitaxial growth even on a substrate material
with some lattice mismatch. The growth of TMDCs proceeds via van der Waals
interaction, which has tolerance to release the lattice mismatching condition.
The three primary growth modes for TMDC thin ﬁlm epitaxy are the Volmer–Weber,
Frank Van der Merwe, and Stranski–Krastanov modes. The Volmer–Weber mode is a
layer-by-layer growth mode [28]. However, the van der Waals epitaxial growth of
TMDC layers commonly follow the Stranski–Krastanov or Frank Van der Merwe
growth modes [2]. For Stranski–Krastanov growth mode, monolayer TMDC domains
initially gather and interconnect with each other until ull coverage of the monolayer is
completed. Beyond the critical layer number (1 for TMDCs), growth continues through
the nucleation and coalescence of TMDC nanoparticles or a few-layer islands which
lead to few-layer epitaxy. Thus, the Stranski–Krastanov growth mode is also known as
“layer-plus-island growth,” while Frank Van der Merwe is an “island growth” mode,
where the TMDC layers form in isolated islands with different layer thicknesses and
then stitch to form a complete thin ﬁlm.
Generally, two strategies can be utilized to manipulate the growth process, including
thermodynamic and kinetic controls [2, 29]. The thermodynamic process is typically
used to produce high-quality crystals with more stable atomic structures, such as bilayer
or thicker TMDCs. For example, physical vapor deposition is considered as a thermo-
dynamic process [30] when the thermodynamic conditions for TMDC formation are
reached, TMDC powder evaporates and recrystallize on a cold surface to form mono-
layer domains. The kinetic process normally requires a lower activation energy than the
thermodynamic one. A good example is the lateral heteroepitaxy growth [31], where
edge features can promote the formation of TMDCs due to a signiﬁcant reduction in the
nucleation energy barrier. The kinetic process also prefers metastable structure forma-
tion such as vertical aligned TMDC layers grown perpendicularly to the growth
substrates [32].
19.3
Sulfurization/Selenization of Transition Metal Oxides
Chemical vapor deposition (CVD), a bottom-up strategy, provides a synthetic route that
can be employed to obtain TMDC monolayers, heterostructure alloys, and multiple-
layer stackings. Different from physical vapor phase transport method, CVD uses a
chemical process to produce the layered materials and this technique is commonly used
in the semiconductor industry. Li et al. ﬁrst proposed the CVD synthetic method to
grow single crystalline MoS2 in 2011 [21, 25]. In a typical CVD process for TMDC
growth, the substrates are exposed to volatile precursors that react or decompose in

vapor phases, by which the desired layered materials can be formed. It shows great
promise to generate high-quality TMDC layers with a scalable size, controllable
thickness, and excellent electronic properties.
19.3.1
Synthesis of TMDC Monolayers
The sulfurization of metal oxides in vapor phases can result in either single-crystalline
TMDC ﬂakes or continuous monolayer thin ﬁlms on arbitrary substrates depending on
the nucleation density. Since the report on vapor phase growth of single-crystalline
MoS2 monolayers [21, 23, 25], there is a growing body of research on the growth of
various TMDC structures. The direct vapor phase reaction of transition metal oxide and
sulfur/selenium has been widely applied to produce TMDC layers such as MoS2 [29]
WS2 [33, 34] MoSe2 [35], and WSe2 [36]. As shown in Fig. 19.1(a), in the pioneer
experimental report for monolayer TMDC CVD synthesis [25], sulfur and MoO3
powders were chosen as the growth precursors. Suggested by the Mo–O–S ternary
phase diagram in Fig. 19.1(b), it was proposed that the MoO3 precursor in the vapor
phase undergoes a two-step reaction during the CVD growth
MoO3 þ ðx=2ÞS ! MoO3x þ ðx=2ÞSO2,
(19.1)

(19.2)
where the transition metal suboxides are likely to be formed during the reaction. The
reaction intermediates diffuse to the substrate and further react with sulfur vapors to
grow MoS2 layers, as shown in Fig. 19.1(c). The partial pressure of the gaseous species
can be controlled by the temperature of S and MoO3, which can govern subsequent
adsorption and surface-bound reactions on the substrates [2]. Therefore, the CVD of
TMDCs via the sulfurization/selenization transition metal oxides requires a well-
controlled sulfurization/selenization rate especially for monolayer TMDC production.
For example, excess in sulfur supply could suppress the volatilization of MoO3 (or
WO3), which may lead to a low yield of TMDC growth. While insufﬁcient chalcogen
supply may not be able to allow S to replace the oxygen in metal oxides completely, this
is not preferred for TMDC formation. It has been argued that pre-treatment of the
growth substrate is very inﬂuential for MoS2 growth. Nucleation engineering by
seeding the substrates with graphene-like species has been systematically investigated.
Planar aromatic molecules were found to be good promoters for MoS2 growth [25, 37].
The high yield of MoS2 is anticipated to occur with a better wetting condition between
precursors and the growth surfaces due to the lower free energy for the nucleation.
This approach can be further utilized to promote the growth of TMDCs on graphene
and h-BN [37].
Najmaei et al. [38] and van der Zande et al. [39] have reported a reﬁned route for
MoS2 growth, respectively. MoS2 triangular monolayer ﬂakes and aggregates can be
obtained on bare substrates without seeding molecules. Najmaei et al. found that the
MoS2 triangular crystals are commonly nucleated and formed on the step edges due to
signiﬁcant reduction in the nucleation energy barrier compared with the ﬂat surface [38].

Growth of MoS2 layers can be controlled by patterning the substrates using conven-
tional lithography processes. Van der Zande et al. report a 100-micrometer-sized
triangular TMDC single domain, synthesized using carefully cleaned substrates and
fresh precursors [39].
Gong et al. have reported the tellurium-assisted low-temperature synthesis of MoS2
and WS2 monolayers [40]. Introducing Te into the growth is able to make reaction
conditions milder, since Te has a lower melting point at 450 C, and a small fraction
of W can dissolve into Te. In a sulfur-rich reaction environment, WS2 crystals precipi-
tate from Te agglomerates and grow on SiO2 substrates. Thus, TMDCs can be obtained
at a reduced temperature of ~500 C. The as-grown monolayers show good optical
characteristics and electrical performance, which are comparable to samples prepared
by CVD at higher temperatures without Te.

Ternary TMDC Alloys
Band-gap engineering of 2D materials is critical for their applications in nanoelectronics
and optoelectronics. The band structure in TMDCs can be engineered by their stoichi-
ometry [41]. The isomorphism of the transition metal dichalcogenide families
(MX2: M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) makes them promising candidates to form ternary

van der Waals alloys without phase separation. Substitutional doping of chalcogenides
and transition metals has been demonstrated to be effective in tailoring their electronic
properties.
Gong et al. demonstrate growth of the alloy MoS2xSe2(1x) with fully tuneable
chemical compositions [42]. Using the same CVD technique developed for TMDC
synthesis, ternary van der Waals alloys can be produced through the reaction of MoO3
with selenium and sulfur powder. A random and homogeneous doping of Se in the MoS2
lattice is achieved. This TMDC alloy shows a tuneable band gap between 1.85 eV and
1.60 eV determined by the Se doping level. However, it is difﬁcult to precisely control
S and Se vapour diffusion in a small CVD furnace, which results in large variations in
atomic composition in the ﬁnal product. Similarly, Zhang et al. report a one-step CVD
synthesis for the ternary alloy Mo1xWxS2 and the MoS2(1x)Se2x monolayer [43]. The
optical band gap could be broadened to a range of 1.97 eV to 1.55 eV by controlling the
ratio of Mo/W or S/Se in the precursors.
It is found that MoS2xSe2(1x) monolayer alloys can be prepared either by seleniza-
tion of CVD MoS2 or sulfurization of CVD MoSe2 [44], which makes the production of
TMDC alloys more controllable. Su et al. systematically compare these two approaches
in detail [44], Spectroscopic and TEM evidences show that the Mo—S bonds can be
replaced by the Mo—Se bonds in a random manner. In contrast, it is preferable for the
replacement of Mo—Se by Mo—S bonds to occur along certain directions depending
on the crystalline orientation of MoSe2 – this makes the optical band gap of these alloys
distinctly different.
19.3.3
Vertical Heterostructures
With various 2D building blocks in hand, most of the critical components in modern
electronics can be redesigned and fabricated by TMDCs and their heterostructures.
Heterostructures of 2D TMDC materials provide a new strategy for materials engineer-
ing, where the electrical and optical properties are dominated by the stacking orientation
and the strength of the interlayer coupling. Combining the electronic properties of
different 2D-layered materials in hybrid heterostructures offers the possibility to create
devices with new functionalities. Therefore, it is of considerable interest in the con-
struction of these heterostructural materials, e.g. alternating individual layers of differ-
ent 2D ﬁlms (graphene, boron nitride, Mica, TMDCs, and others) with particular
stacking patterns. TMDC layers formed by vertical stacking have been realized by the
CVD method. For example, many novel devices are based on heterostructures formed
between MoS2 and graphene. Electronic logic and memory devices have already been
demonstrated from graphene/MoS2 hybrids [45]. The graphene/MoS2 heterostructures
also show extremely high photo gain [46] and ultra-sensitive detection of DNA
hybridization [47].
For vertically stacked TMDC heterostructures, Ionescu et al. have demonstrated
highly ordered MoS2/WS2 bilayer domains by sulfurization of drop-casted MoO3 and
WO3 nanobelts in sequence [48]. Gong et al. report the synthesis of WS2 and MoS2
heterostructures, where the mixture of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3), tungsten, and

tellurium powders is used as the metal source (the addition of tellurium helps to
accelerate the melting of tungsten powder during growth) [49]. Due to the difference
in nucleation and growth rates for various materials, MoS2 and WS2 can be sequentially
deposited on substrates. In accordance with their calculation, the van der Waals
heterostructure is thermodynamically favored. Therefore, as shown in Fig. 19.2(a) and
(b) and (c) and (d), TMDC layers with different stacking manners can be achieved by
controlling the reaction temperature, where in-plane lateral heterojunctions are formed
at 650 C, and vertically stacked bilayers dominate when the synthesis is carried out at
850 C (Fig. 19.3(d)). Gong and co-works further report the vapor phase growth of
2D TMDC heterostructures with vertical stackings using the two-step approach [50],

where the MoSe2 layers are synthesized ﬁrst and followed by an epitaxial growth of
WSe2 on top. High-resolution STEM images suggest that the WSe2 second layer
epitaxially grows on top of MoSe2 by either 2H or 3R stacking, indicating that different
interface properties or growth conditions could affect the stacking manner.
In addition to TMDCs, other 2D materials such as graphene [22, 51], boron nitrides
[34, 52], and mica [53] are also considered to be a good van der Waals epitaxy substrate
for TMDC growth due to their atomically ﬂat and chemically inert surface with a
hexagonally arranged in-plane lattice. Ji et al. report that the centimetre-scale uniform
monolayer MoS2 can be synthesized on ﬂuorophlogopite mica (KMg3AlSi3O10F2)
through a low-pressure CVD (LPCVD) process [53]. The MoS2 growth on mica follows
an analogous layer-plus-island (or Stranski–Krastanov) growth mode as described
earlier.
19.3.4
In-Plane TMDC Heterostrucutre
Vertically stacked TMDCs have a large interface area, which can signiﬁcantly promote
photon carrier interaction and thus could potentially have considerable applications in
solar cell, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors. However, the tuning of the band
offset is usually not easy since the two TMDC layers are spatially overlapped. The
lateral heterostructure is another very attractive structure in which the junction is
atomically sharp and the active region can be as narrow as few strings of atoms. This
structure offers much easier band offset tuning since TMDC materials are spatially
separated.
Several attempts using the vapor phase reaction of transition metal oxides and
chalcogenides to grow lateral heterostructures have been attempted [49, 50, 54–56].
However, it is challenging to obtain a well-deﬁned and atomically sharp interface
between two TMDC regions, since the interface regions for these lateral junctions
tend to form alloy structures at elevated temperatures. All vapor phase precursors that
co-exist during the growth and the formation of TMDC alloys are thermodynamically
preferred. As shown in Fig. 19.2(e), to realize TMDCs heterostrucutres with atomic-
ally sharp interfaces, Li and co-workers have demonstrated a two-step growth method.
This two-step growth offers the precise control necessary to achieve the atomically
sharp transition in compositions at the junction, as displayed by Figs. 19.2(f) and (g)
[31]. The controlled growth of the lateral WSe2/MoS2 monolayer heterojunction is
realized using a two-step epitaxial process, where the ﬁrst TMDC layer of WSe2 is
grown on substrates by van der Waals epitaxy followed by the edge-epitaxy of the
second TMDC of MoS2. The MoS2 layers extend from the WSe2 domains with a
single crystalline and without any lattice misorientation. The atomically sharp inter-
face is an intrinsic p–n junction characterized by electrical measurement, including
diodes and photovoltaic measurements. Since the lattice mismatch for WSe2 and
MoS2 is as large as 5.5%, the lateral strain is signiﬁcantly dependent on MoS2,
leading to a variable band gap (1.8–1.9 eV). This strained TMDC, induced by crystal
mismatch, is the 2D version of strained semiconductors, which likely opens up the
possibility for 2D straintronics.

19.4
Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition
The aforementioned CVD processes commonly rely on the vaporization of solid state
metal oxide precursors. However, the vaporization of metal oxides is sensitive to
temperature and pressure. Therefore, it is challenging to have precise control of
precursor delivery. Additionally, the variation in the precursor vaporization rate results
in the ﬂuctuation of the atomic ratios between the transition metal and chalcogen in the
reactants, and thus affects the growth results. For instance, growth substrates close to
the metal oxide precursor normally have a higher growth temperature and are expected
to have an excess supply of precursors, which may result in the deposition of bulk ﬁlms
or metal oxide byproducts on the surface.
As shown in Fig. 19.3(a), to have a consistent precursor supply and to improve the
chemical vapor deposition reliability, a metal organic chemical vapor deposition
(MOCVD) method for monolayers MoS2 and WS2 with wafer-scale homogeneity has
been developed the by Park’s group [57]. The major synthetic difference is from the
precursors, where materials with a high equilibrium vapour pressure around room
temperature are selected. Molybdenum hexacarbonyl (Mo(CO)6), tungsten hexacarbo-
nyl (W(CO)6), and diethyl sulphide ((C2H5)2S) are used as chemical precursors for Mo,
W, and S, respectively. According to their report, the layer-by-layer growth mode can
be achieved by a low partial pressure of metal vapor. This work shows signiﬁcant
promise for a scalable synthesis of TMDCs since it provides better control over the
metal and chalcogen precursor delivery during synthesis. Remarkably, after the ﬁrst
TMDC layer growth, SiO2 can be deposited and used as the growth surface for the
second TMDC layer deposition, shown in Fig. 19.3(b). This method enables the
production of multi-stacked monolayer MoS2 ﬁlms as well as electronic devices
fabricated at different vertical levels, as displayed in Figs. 19.3(c) and (d). Eichfeld
et al. have demonstrated a scalable synthesis of large-area, mono and few-layer WSe2
via cold wall MOCVD using W(CO)6 and (CH3)2Se as the precursor, as shown in
Figs. 19.3(e) and (f) [58]. It is found the WSe2 quality can be determined by the growth
condition, including temperature, pressure, the Se:W ratio, and the choice of substrate,
such as graphene, boron nitride, and sapphire, as shown in Figs. 19.3(g) and (h).
MOCVD can be also used to produce a TMDC alloy with a tuneable band gap. Mann
et al. demonstrate the synthesis of MoS2(1x)Se2x monolayers using a mixture of organic
selenium and sulfur precursors and MoO3 powder [59]. The room temperature optical
band gap can be tuned between 1.87 eV (for pure single-layer MoS2) and 1.55 eV (for
pure single-layer MoSe2). MOCVD is more capable for large-scale synthesis due to
easier control of precursor delivery. However, the carbon impurities from the metal
organic precursors may be an issue for electronic applications.

Physical Vapor Phase Transport
The physical vapor deposition (PVD) method has been adopted to produce TMDC
monolayers with high optical quality, which is required for the study of valley-related

physics. In a PVD process, TMDC vapors are generated by heating or sputtering
methods and then transported onto growth substrates followed by deposition.
Xu et al. demonstrate a vapor-solid (VS) growth method for the synthesis of MoS2
[30] and WSe2 [24] monolayers. The starting material TMDC powder is evaporated at
~900 C under a low pressure condition. MoS2 and WSe2 monolayers with high optical
quality can be grown on the substrates close to the edge of the tube furnace at the
downstream side of the TMDC powder crucible. The MoS2 monolayers prepared by the
VS method possess a PL polarization that is substantial with a maximum of 35% at
~1.92 eV, even at room temperature [30]. The result suggests a superb optical quality
and high crystallinity of MoS2 layers. The WSe2 prepared by the VS growth method has
a lateral dimension up to 30 μm and the low temperature PL measurement shows well

resolved and electrically tunable excitonic features similar to the exfoliated monolayers
from bulk crystals [24].
As displayed in Figs. 19.4(a) and (b), the PVD technique could also be used to
produce other TMDC materials and alloys. Using the VS growth approach, Fang et al.
demonstrate the synthesis of MoS2(1x)Se2x (0.4  x  1) semiconductor alloys, where
MoS2 and MoSe2 powders are used as the growth precursors [60]. Both of the powders
are simultaneously evaporated and TMDC alloys are produced under a pressure of
8 Pa. Since the evaporation rate of MoS2 and MoSe2 is sensitive to their respective
temperatures, the composition of as-synthesized MoS2(1x)Se2x monolayers can be
tailored. The band-gap photoluminescence is tunable from 1.86 eV (i.e., 665 nm when
x = 0) to 1.73 eV (i.e., 716 nm when x = 0.40).
Shown in Figs. 19.4(c) and (d), Xu et al. further use the PVD method to synthesize
lateral TMDC [61] by using two source powders WSe2 and MoSe2 powders. The
similarity of these two TMDC materials permits the lateral epitaxial growth of WSe2
directly from MoSe2 edges. However, the Mo1xWxSe2 (0 < x < 1) ternary compound
is usually observed at the junction area region.
Uniform growth of pristine two-dimensional (2D) materials over large areas at a
lower temperature is a critical pre-requisite for energy efﬁcient production and seamless

high heating temperature that is close to the melting temperature of TMDC powders.
Furthermore, the random nucleation of TMDC crystals and non-uniform layer numbers
are commonly seen for VS growth.
19.6
Summary and Outlook
2D TMDCs exhibit unprecedented electrical, optical, thermal, and mechanical proper-
ties which enable them to be used as building blocks in ﬂexible, compact, and light-
weight integrated electronic systems. It is demanding and essential to develop synthetic
approaches for uniform and large-area TMDC layers.
Vapor phase deposition is one of the most promising techniques for mass production
of various high-quality TMDCs with scalable size, controllable thickness, and
contamination-free interfaces. The conditions for TMDC growth such as temperature,
pressure, gas ﬂow rate, substrate interface property, and precursor delivery can signiﬁ-
cantly affect the synthetic pathway and thus produce TMDC layers with different
surface structures and chemical compositions. To realize the practical applications,
more effort is needed to attack many issues related to the growth and device fabrication,
including layer number control, size control, area selective growth, and direct growth of
heterostructures. The success of cost-effective and large-scale TMDC synthesis could
also enable a new generation of ﬂexible electronics for wearable personal electronics.
Besides the widely synthesized and studied MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 layers,
new type of TMDCs, such as NbS2 [62], MoTe2 [63], and PtS2 are emerging [64]. The
synthesis of these TMDC layers aims at expanding the band-gap coverage in the 2D
family and in pursuing the ultra-high electron/hole mobility in electronic devices [64].
The theoretical calculation shows that TMDCs have phonon-limited mobility up to
~2500 cm2/(Vs) at room temperature [64]. However, the performance of current
TMDC-based transistors are still limited by several factors, including the quality of
materials, interfacial charge trap/scattering, metal contacts, and TMDC–dielectrics inter-
faces. The synthesis of 2D TDMC materials is a relatively new but exciting and rapidly
expanding area of research, which requires more effort and investment in the future.

Defects in Two-Dimensional Materials
Xiaolong Zou and Boris I. Yakobson
20.1
Introduction
While defects have been vastly explored in bulk materials for decades, due to their
governing role in determining key material properties, it is only after the successful
growth of graphene by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) that the defect behaviors in
two-dimensional (2D) materials began to capture much attention from researchers.
The recent shift of focus from semimetal graphene to other monolayer insulator/
semiconductor materials – including h-BN, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC),
and phosphorene – further underscores the importance of defect engineering. For
example, MoS2 is an n-type semiconductor, and electron mobility is still usually
relatively low. More importantly, large-scale growth of various 2D ﬁlms, necessary
for their technological applications, inevitably introduces a variety of defects, includ-
ing dislocations, grain boundaries (GBs), and edges. Most of these defects are
detrimental to electronic applications. To facilitate purposeful engineering or control,
it is vital to develop a deeper understanding of the defect formation, structures,
properties, and response to external environmental conditions. Powerful microscopy
techniques nowadays not only allow for imaging or characterization of individual
defects, but can also serve as a route to creating various nanostructures, ranging from
phase interfaces, GBs, to nanowires, in addition to the conventional vacancies. While
generated vacancies can be intentionally ﬁlled with foreign atoms to achieve the
desired doping, other various nanostructures provide rich platforms for the design of
new devices and exploration of novel condensed-matter physics. In addition, the shear
openness of 2D crystals compared to bulk materials offers a new degree of freedom
and often signiﬁcant advantage to engineering defect structures and their properties
through environmental control.
In this chapter, we will review recent advances in our understanding of defects in 2D
non-graphene materials, and highlight the engineering control of such defects research-
ers have successfully achieved so far. The defects are classiﬁed into four categories:
point defects (PD), topological defects including dislocations and grain boundaries
(GB), dislocations in bilayers, and other one-dimensional (1D) defects, ranging from
edges, interfaces, to nanowires (NW). We will mainly focus on 2D transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDCs) because of their considerable potential in electronic and
optoelectronic applications.

Point Defects
20.2.1
Point Defects in TMDC, Connection to Electronics
The most important questions regarding point defects are their thermodynamic
equilibrium concentration and their inﬂuence on electronic and optical properties. The
equilibrium concentration of defects can be derived from their formation energies.
Several theoretical works [1–3] have presented formation energies for various defects
in MoS2, including vacancies, anti-sites, interstitials, and larger voids, which were clearly
identiﬁed by the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), Fig. 20.1(a) [1, 4].
Among them, the single S vacancy (VS) has the lowest formation energy, irrespective of
chemical potential. Since the interaction between the VS and another vacancy is weak,
only 60 meV can be gained by forming a double S vacancy (VS + VS ! VS2), as derived
from density functional theory (DFT) simulations, Fig. 20.1(b). On the other hand, the
strong interaction between Mo and S greatly reduces the formation energies for larger
voids (MoS3 and MoS6 vacancies), by as much as 5.5 eV, compared to the energies of
isolated VMo and VS. The Gibbs free energy (G) for the formation of n vacancies is given
by G = nGF – TSconf, where GF and Sconf are the formation energy for a single vacancy
and the conﬁguration entropy, respectively. Following Boltzmann’s formula, Sconf = kB
ln P with P = N!/(Nn)!n!, and N the number of atoms of crystals. The theoretical
equilibrium concentration of defects can be obtained by minimizing G with respect to n.
Applying two simple approximations, ln(x!) = x ln(x) and Nn ’ N, the concentration
n/N is obtained as exp(–GF/kBT). Since GF is a function of chemical potential, and thus
pressure and temperature, the theoretical value for the concentration of VS lies in the
range of 108–1011 cm–2 (~10–5–10–2%) [2], which is about two orders of magnitude
lower than the experimental one (1013 cm–2 or ~1%) [4, 5]. The observed much higher
vacancy concentration could result from electron beam damage or vacuum annealing.
Nevertheless, electronic behaviors of the dominating VS have considerable inﬂuence on
transport properties. It has been commonly accepted that the ubiquitous VS causes
intrinsic n-type conductivity [5–8]. However, DFT calculations (inset of Fig. 20.1(b))
found that VS only introduces two unoccupied levels deep in the band gap, while
occupied states are close to the valence band maximum. Further investigations [2] of
charged defects (Fig. 20.1(c)) have revealed only neutral or negative states as stable for
VS, and that the charge transition level lies deep inside the band gap. Therefore, VS acts
as a deep acceptor, and has no contribution to n-type conductivity. In contrast, these deep
electron traps are strong scattering centers for carriers, and tend to decrease the mobility.
It is then expected that the effective passivation of chalcogenide vacancies, using thiol [9]
or oxygen [10], could lead to an enhancement of conductivity, as shown in WSe2, where
a 400 times increase is observed [10].
20.2.2
PD-Doping Control of the Carriers
Extrinsic doping is a viable route to control carrier type and concentration in 2D
TMDCs [11]. In contrast to bulk cases, where doping is mainly achieved through

dopant diffusion or ion-implantation, the most controllable ways to introduce substitu-
tional dopants into 2D crystals are ex-situ molecular doping or in-situ direct growth.
Through adopting chloride-containing molecular dopants, a doping density of 1013 cm–2
can be achieved in MoS2 [12]. More interestingly, using chemical vapor transport
methods, substitutional niobium doping is achieved in intrinsic n-type MoS2, giving
rise to a p-type conductivity with degenerate hole density of 3  1019 cm3 (~0.01%)
[13]. When achieved in this way, control of asymmetric doping facilitates the electronic
and optoelectronic applications where a p–n junction, or bipolar transport, is required. It
also ensures that the spin- and valley-polarized valence bands are accessible, potentially
enabling further development of spintronics and valleytronic devices [14].

20.2.3
PD Optical Manifestations
In contrast to the graphene case, where atomic defects signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the Raman
peak (D peak), providing a measure for defectiveness of samples, the Raman spectra of
TMDCs is insensitive to point defects. On the other hand, the photoluminescence (PL)
shows a characteristic defect-bound neutral exciton peak located ~0.1 eV below the
A-exciton peak [15]. The intensity of the defect-induced PL peaks is enhanced when
materials become more defective. Such variation can provide a non-destructive way to
determine the quality of 2D sheets. The line width (~0.1 eV) of these bound excitons is
about one order of magnitude greater than for delocalized excitons, possibly because the
plasma-bombardment-induced defects are inhomogeneous [15]. Intriguingly, excitons
bound to some defects in WSe2, preferably near the edges or interfaces, give rise to
single photon emissions with a line width of only ~100 μeV and energy of about
20–100 meV lower than for free excitons [16–19]. The realization of single-photon
emitters in 2D materials and their feasible electrical control could further the develop-
ment of quantum photonics and quantum-information technologies.
20.2.4
Defects in h-BN
Compared to triple-decker 2D TMDCs, defects in plain-planar h-BN are structurally
simpler, but more difﬁcult to observe with atomic resolution, due to the small difference
in mass and thus weak imaging intensity contrast between B and N atoms. Nevertheless,
aberration corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (AC-HRTEM)
[20] and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) [21] have enabled unambiguous
identiﬁcation of defects, predominantly B vacancies. Also observed are larger voids with
notably identical orientation of their triangular shapes (Fig. 20.2(a)), displaying all zig-
zag-type edges, always N terminated. Theoretically, the formation energy of a B vacancy
in neutral charge state is lower than that of an N vacancy over almost the entire range of
chemical potential, limited by thermodynamic equilibrium with alpha-B phase on one
end or with N2 molecules on the other. Further, the formation of BN divacancy eliminates
the dangling bonds and thus is ~6 eV exothermic, VB + VN ! VBN + 6 eV, which is
close to that in graphene [22]. The abundance of B-centered point defects is believed to
originate from the knock-on effect of the electron beam, with the knock-on threshold for
B notably lower than that for N [23]. Similarly, other defects including substituting C for
either B or N and substituting O for N have been identiﬁed by annular dark-ﬁeld signal
intensity, Fig. 20.2(b) [24]. Electron beam irradiation not only provides an advanced
technique to characterize atom types, but can be adopted to induce C doping into BN
after synthesis [25]. It is shown that C atoms from adsorbed hydrocarbon molecules
generally prefer to occupy B sites, which is in line with the knock-on effect on BN,
Fig. 20.2(c). In addition, theoretical investigations also suggest lower formation energy
of C substitution for B, especially when charge doping is introduced [26]. However, the
elemental asymmetry of doping (preference of B sites) does not necessarily become an
issue, since B and N atoms can be nearly completely substituted by C, as achieved in
nanotubes [25]. Compared with conventional ion implantation and diffusion methods,

the electron–beam-induced doping can be controlled by a steering focused beam at room
temperature. With the potential advantage of overcoming the strong tendency of phase
segregation between C and BN, this provides a viable route to mixing structurally similar,
but electronically distinct, graphene and BN with intriguing electronic and magnetic
properties – a long-sought goal in the research community.

Topological Defects: Dislocations and Grain Boundaries
20.3.1
Dislocations in h-BN
Another class of defects ubiquitous in large-scale samples is topological defects, includ-
ing, but not limited to, dislocations and grain boundaries, and the latter can be viewed as
an array of the former. Dislocations can be classiﬁed into edge and screw types. It is well

documented that edge dislocation in carbon nanotubes or graphene can be represented by
a pentagon–heptagon pair (C-5|7) with two basic disclinations, 5–pentagon and
7–heptagon [27–29]. Since strain energy of dislocation is proportional to the square of
its Burgers vector |b|2, the 5|7 with smallest b = (1, 0) is dominant in graphene. Due to the
identical honeycomb lattice for both graphene and the monolayer h-BN, the smallest
dislocations in h-BN share the same topology as carbon 5|7, Fig. 20.3(a) [30]. However,
the heteroelemental composition of h-BN renders these 5|7s either B-rich or N-rich
(containing either B—B or N—N bonds, named B-5|7 or N-5|7, respectively), which
leads to an additional chemical energy cost. On the other hand, larger dislocation
composed of a fully heteroelemental square–octagon pair (4|8 with b = (1, 1)) suffers
from greater strain energy. Which dislocation is favorable depends on the balance
between chemical and strain energies. By comparing dislocations with the same ampli-
tude of |b|, 4|8 is predicted to be the favorable core. Partial stabilization of 4|8 originates
from the off-plane buckling of the 2D sheet, which effectively relaxes the strain energy.
Compared to graphene, the heteroelemental composition of BN makes it necessary to
classify the bisector GBs into two groups, based on mirror symmetry. The symmetric
and asymmetric GBs can be constructed by rotating (tilting) two grains from either pure
armchair or pure zig-zag directions, respectively, and thus named as A-GBs and Z-GBs.
While symmetric A-GBs would accommodate either B-5|7s or N-5|7s, asymmetric
Z-GBs can be composed of an equal number of B- and N-5|7s or merely 4|8s. The
asymmetric 4|8 GBs are more favorable than 5|7 GBs, especially for high tilt angles,
mainly due to the effective release of strain energy through the close packing of
compressive 4- and tensile 8-membered rings, as shown in Fig. 20.3(b) for the 60
case. It is interesting to note that 60 symmetric GBs consisting of a line of B—B or
N—N bonds are geometrically identical to the pristine lattice. The intrinsic polarity of
these symmetric 60 GBs, however, brings about additional charge localized along
GBs. The theoretical analysis shows that B—B and N—N bonds would introduce states
near the bottom of conduction bands and the top of valence bands, respectively, which
in turn reduces band gap signiﬁcantly. After theoretical prediction, B-5|7 and N-5|7 as
well as 4|8 GBs have been observed in experiments by ultra-high-resolution TEM
(Fig. 20.3(c))[31] and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) (Fig. 20.3(d)) [32].
20.3.2
Dislocation Diversity in MX2
Turning from monoatomic layer h-BN to three-atomic layer TMDCs (MX2 with M
and X representing metal and chalcogenide, respectively), not only their complex
structure makes the characterization of dislocation structures more challenging, but the
ﬂexible metal-chalcogenide ligand bonding brings about variability in stoichiometry
through the interaction between dislocations and point defects. For 2D TMDCs, the
structures of dislocations have been ﬁrst predicted theoretically by Zou et al. [33]. Akin to
h-BN, the smallest dislocations in MX2 can be classiﬁed into M- or X-rich ones (mutually
inverted orientations) with their frontal views resembling 5|7 or 7|5. Owing to the three-
atomic-layer structures of MX2, these dislocation cores are essentially 3D concave
polyhedra, as shown in the top and bottom panels of Fig. 20.4(a). Both the strong stress
ﬁeld around dislocation cores and the ﬂexible coordination number of X atoms render the
364

interaction between dislocations and point defects (interstitials, vacancies, or substitu-
tions) highly effective, endowing the core structures with rich chemical variability. Such
variability can be achieved by environmental control, as shown in the calculated forma-
tion energies as functions of chemical potential of S(μS), middle panel of Fig. 20.4(a). All
considered structures can become favorable under a certain range of μS, including two
particularly interesting dislocation cores with rhombs or octagons, labeled 4|6 or 6|8.
Similar to those in BN, bisector GBs in TMDCs can be divided into symmetric
A-GBs and asymmetric Z-GBs. In contrast to cases of point defects, where formation
energies can be used to compare thermodynamic preference, the stabilities of GBs can
only be compared at the same tilt (a topological invariant). From the growth point of
view, the tilt is preset during the non-equilibrium growth history, and only local
reconstruction could form a speciﬁc GB without changing the tilt. The likelihood of
such local reconstruction can be determined by the energy difference for various GBs
at the preset tilt. Figure 20.4(b) suggests that small and large tilt GBs show distinct
behaviors: for small-tilt GBs, their minor energy difference indicates that GBs with
different dislocation cores can form with nearly equal probability, while for large-tilt
GBs, the notable energy difference implies that only speciﬁc GBs will be dominate in
CVD samples – GBs with a line of rhombs or 4|8s for A-GBs and Z-GBs, respectively.
These theoretical predictions indeed have been corroborated by following independent
experiments, including various cases in small tilt GBs (Fig. 20.4(c)) and some speciﬁc
60 GBs (Fig. 20.4(d)) [1, 34, 35].

20.3.3
GB Formed by Electron Irradiation
Besides their formation duringcomplexCVD growth process, GBs, and especially the twin-
boundary types, could form under electron beam irradiation, which produces chalcogenide-
deﬁcient conditions. Taking MoSe2 as an example, Se vacancies induced by electron beam
irradiation tend to aggregate, forming vacancy lines, which would introduce signiﬁcant
strain into the lattice. As the number of Se vacancies increases, the growth of vacancy lines
is limited by enhanced strain energy. To effectively release the strain energy, vacancy lines
tend to transform into 60 Se-deﬁcient GBs through the movement of Mo atoms [36, 37].
These GBs include those featuring either a line of rhombs or 1Tʹ phase stripe embedded in
the 2H phase – the same structures as shown in Fig. 20.4(d). It is worth mentioning that the
formation of these 60 GBs does not necessarily require electron beam irradiation. They can
also emerge spontaneously during molecular beam epitaxy growth [36, 38]. Theoretical
analysis regarding the phase diagram of Mo/Se systems indicates that MoSex (x < 2) with
dense concentration of Se-deﬁcient GBs is favorable compared to the two other well-
known phases, MoSe2 and Mo3Se4 [36]. Since the nucleated phase (inverted domain) is
the same as the original one, it is probably the negative GB/interface energy under Se-
deﬁcient condition that induces the formation of these twin GBs.
Under electron beam irradiation, GB in WSe2 could develop another interesting
evolution pattern, with the formation of three-fold rotational defect resembling trefoil
as precursor [39]. Similar to the Stone–Wales (SW) rotation in graphene, trefoil defects
form through a 60 rotation of the WSe6 unit composed of three pairs of W–Se bonds.
The collective movement of several atoms renders the migration of these trefoil defects
slow; nevertheless, they can aggregate to form inverted domains following a series of
60 W–Se bond rotations. The resultant twin-boundary consists of an array of octagons
intermixed with the pentagon-pairs, forming an . . . 85/585/5 . . . chain (Fig. 20.4(e)). Its
planar (top) view is the same as that observed in graphene on Ni [40]. All these 60 GBs
have been systematically studied considering different combinations of edge fronts of
merging grains in a recent theoretical report [41].
To understand the inﬂuence of dislocations and GBs on material properties, espe-
cially the electronic, optical, and mechanical properties, is very important, due to the
anticipated applications of these 2D materials in electronics and optoelectronics.

20.3.4
GB in Electronic Transport and Metallicity
Dislocations and GBs usually act as scattering centers or sinks for carriers, reducing their
mobility. In a large sample (~ tens of μm), as the density of GBs with different types and
orientations increases, the electrical performance deteriorates progressively [42], consistent
with the observations in conventional semiconductors. The development of nanotechnology
nowadays allows for direct examination of the role of individual GBs. At the nanoscale,
distinctelectricalbehaviors are revealed fortwo different types of GBs, i.e., tilt and twin GBs
[34, 42]. The measurements on FET devices built on a single GB show that while tilt GBs
reduce the mobility by half compared to that of pristine MoS2, twin GBs could have even
higherconductivity alongGBs, Fig. 20.5(a) [34, 42].The highconductivity alongfew-atom-
wide 60 (inversion) twin GBs was initially predicted by ﬁrst-principles calculations for a
few selected GB structures [33]. Later, STM on MoSe2 clearly showed the midgap-state-
induced metallicity near 60 twin GBs, Fig. 20.5(b) [38]. Systematic theoretical analysis
reveals that the metallicity of twin GBs is an intrinsic property of 2D TMDCs, arising from
the polar discontinuity across GBs [41, 43]. Intriguingly, the transport properties of GBs
have been shown to depend on prior electrical signals [44], under which GBs probably
change their structures dueto themigration of S vacancies. This enables therealization of the
proof-of-concept non-volatile memory element – memristor – in 2D materials.
20.3.5
Magnetic Properties
Besides the above-mentioned detrimental roles in electronic transport, tilt GBs could act
as recombination centers for electrons and holes, which would harm optical applications,
for example, the photoelectrochemical and photovoltaic devices. Exceptionally, if the
localized states from tilt GBs are partially occupied through controlled gating or doping,
GBs become magnetic following the Stoner model. An example of magnetization density
for Mo- and S-rich 5|7s is shown in Fig. 20.5(c) [45]. As tilt angle increases, the overlap
between localized states, and thus the exchange splitting, becomes greater, which turns
the systems into half-metallic. Although magnetism can also appear in graphene, it
mainly results from dangling bonds of imperfections, such as vacancies, ad-atoms, or
edges, which can be easily annealed. In contrast, GBs as topological defects are robust
against local reconstructions, and thus the magnetism can be well preserved under
various disturbances, presenting considerable potential for spintronics applications.
20.3.6
Optical Manifestations
While studies on electrical transport of GBs reach consistent conclusions, optical
properties of GBs show varied behaviors from sample to sample, especially for twin
GBs. Both 50% quenching [34] and 250% enhancement [46] in PL intensity have been
observed for twin GBs. Since no accurate information on GB structures is available
along with these observations, it is difﬁcult to tell exactly what kinds of defects play a
role. It has been proposed that doping and strain effects could contribute to the observed
PL variance, however, further details remain to be unraveled.

20.3.7
Migration, Chemically Enhanced Plasticity
The mechanical properties of polycrystalline samples rely critically on the migration
behaviors of dislocations under external stress or other stimuli. The glide of B- or N-5|7
in h-BN driven by SW rotation [47] is only possible under electron beam irradiation,
due to the high activation barrier [31, 48]. In contrast, the migration mechanisms and
barriers for dislocations in TMDCs depend sensitively on speciﬁc core structures, which
may vary. While 4|6 and 6|8 cores migrate through a direct rebonding (RB) mechanism
involving mainly a single metal atom; other dislocations glide through generalized SW
(SWg) rotation. The single-atom movement through the RB mechanism has fairly low
barriers in the range of 0.5–0.7 eV, while the SWg process with concerted several-atoms
movement requires two to four times higher barriers, 1.1–2.4 eV. Since dislocation
structures can be controlled by chemical potential, this leads to an interesting and
unexpected phenomenon that most mobile dislocations (4|6 and 6|8) can be thermo-
dynamically favorable at the same time. With 4|6 or 4|8 dominantly presenting in the
samples and reaching a sufﬁcient concentration, the plastic deformation can be
macroscopically observable. The fast-moving individual 6|8s have been observed in
experiments under electron beam irradiation, see Fig. 20.5(d) [49]. Direct evidence of
entire GB migration has also been obtained in memristor devices, with GB moving by
3 μm within 1000 s [44].
20.3.8
Screw Dislocations as off-2D Helicoids
In contrast to edge dislocations, screw dislocations do not exist in truly monolayer
materials. However, they are very common in the growth of carbon nanotubes
[50], nanowires, and nanoplates. By introducing the supersaturation condition for
precursors, following the Burton–Cabrera–Frank theory [51], screw dislocation
driven growth has been achieved for both multilayer MoS2 (Fig. 20.6(a)) [52] and
WSe2 [53]. One important feature of the as-grown pyramids is that they take AA
stacking, which breaks the inversion symmetry and allows for intriguing applications
in valleytronics, non-linear optics, and piezoelectronics. Their helicoid geometry
also suggests the possibility of a large magnetic ﬁeld generated by a current through
such nanosolenoids, as explored in detail in the case of graphene “Riemann
surfaces” [54].

domains (AB and AC stackings) [55–57]. Its accommodation of strain induces
profound rippling of the bilayer graphene, which is revealed by TEM in combination
with atomistic simulations (Fig. 20.6(b)). Due to the identical structure factors (and
rocking curves) for both stacking variants, AB and AC in the f112 0g reﬂections, the
stacking faults bordered by the partials are invisible. In contrast, in f22 00g reﬂec-
tions, the local transition of the stacking sequence in the bilayer graphene from AB
to AC, and vice versa, is clearly visible as a real intensity variation. Such boundaries
are predicted to host novel topological electronic states protected by symmetry [58,
59], which may also provide an explanation of the puzzling subgap conductance in
gated bilayer graphene.
20.4.2
Ripplocations
Another recently discussed subclass of defects unique to van der Waals layers is
“ripplocation,” featuring the combined characteristics of surface ripple and dislocation,
Fig. 20.6(c) [60]. Their self-energy scales sublinearly as |b|q with q < 1, so that |b1 + b2|q
< |b1|q + |b2|q, and the same-sign ripplocations tend to attract each other and merge.
This behavior breaks the Frank’s rule (for q  2), and is in contrast to conventional
dislocations, where larger cores are prone to split into smaller ones. Controlled unit
ripplocations are proposed to be adopted as “exciton funnel” through the bending-
induced band-gap engineering [60].
20.5
Other 1D Defects – Edges, Interfaces, and Nanowires
20.5.1
Edges
Edges not only play an important role in determining the thermodynamic or kinetic
shapes of the samples, but they are also critical for understanding the growth process,
and thus the formation of GBs. Previous theoretical investigations have revealed various
edge structures in MoS2 with different S coverage [61]. A recent STEM study [1]
clearly shows some of these structures of metal-rich composition, including a bare Mo
edge and one with 50% S coverage (top left and right panels in Fig. 20.7(a)). In
addition, another S-poor reconstructed Mo edge has been observed, perhaps represent-
ing an intermediate state during the non-equilibrium growth process. This structure
(bottom left panel in Fig. 20.7(a)) can be constructed from the bare Mo edge by
introducing single S vacancy in every S2 site along the edge. The edge Mo atoms
become severely under-coordinated (only two Mo—S bonds compared with six in the
bulk), and their interaction with the inner row of Mo atoms is thus enhanced. Accord-
ingly, the edge Mo atoms pull the lattice inwards, leaving S atoms at the outmost row.
The continuous supply of S would transform the reconstructed edges back to bare Mo
edges, maintaining growth.
The edges of 2D TMDCs show certain interesting properties. First, these edges can
be viewed as interfaces between TMDCs and the vacuum, where polar discontinuity
372

occurs. The polarization charge and electric ﬁeld introduced by the polar continuity
apparently induce robust metallicity along the edges, no matter what kind of structure
they are [43]. Second, regarding the optical properties, the edges of WS2 display
extraordinary PL intensity, about 25 times enhancement compared to that at the pristine
lattice [62]. Third, for catalytic applications, the edges of MoS2 are known to act as an

20.5.2
Phase 1T–2H interfaces
One intriguing aspect of 2D TMDCs is that, as they have different properties, they can
adopt more than one phase. In contrast to the semiconducting 2H phase with trigonal
prismatic coordination, the octahedral 1T phase is metallic. Figure 20.7(b) shows a
TEM image for the interface between 2H and 1T phases in chemically exfoliated MoS2
[65]. The controlled phase engineering of 2D TMDCs adds another way to realize new
functionalities in these materials [66]. The combination of their hydrophilicity, high
conductivity, and the ability of the van der Waals layers to dynamically expand and
intercalate various ions gives 1T TMDCs high efﬁciency in an electrochemical setting
[67], enabling the applications of 2D TMDCs as supercapacitor electrodes [67] and
catalysts for HER [68]. For HER, promising results employing the metallic edges of 2H
TMDCs have been reported [63]. However, a greater challenge lies in increasing the
number of active sites, since edges are only 1D substructures of 2D materials. Recent
work on 1T TMDCs shows their enhanced catalytic activities, beneﬁting from both high
conductivity and active surface chemistry [68]. Besides electrochemical applications,
phase engineering signiﬁcantly reduces the contact resistance of ﬁeld-effect transistors
(FET) by locally inducing the 1T phase as electrode [69]. The contact resistance
decreases from 0.7–10 kΩ μm for FETs based on the 2H phase to 200–300 Ω μm after
the 1T phase is introduced. The atomically sharp interfaces between the two phases and
the similar values between the work function of the 1T phase and the electron afﬁnity of
the 2H phase lead to considerable decrease in contact resistance.
20.5.3
Nanowires
Besides chemical exfoliation, the 1T–2H interface can also be generated under electron
beam irradiation. Using STEM, Lin et al. show clearly the phase transition in MoS2
from 2H to 1T phases involving the glide of atomic planes of S and/or Mo [70].
Figure 20.7(c) shows three observed interface structures during transition: α, β, and γ
boundaries. The α boundary, formed by shrinking the Mo–Mo distance within three to
four zig-zag chains, is the precursor for phase transition. While the β boundary is similar
to one twin GB (GB with a line of rhombs, as in the left panel of Fig. 20.4D) with one
2H grain changed to 1T phase, the γ boundary can be viewed as the combination of a
bare S edge from the 2H phase and a bare Mo edge from the 1T phase. After the
formation of α boundary, the migration of the β and γ boundaries results in the growth
of the 1T phase. Although the migration of these boundaries and the growth of the 1T
phase have been unambiguously observed, the detailed atomic mechanisms still require
further theoretical effort. With delicate control of the electron beam, various nanodevice
components, including the Schottky diode, quantum lead, quantum dot, and nanoscale
transistor, could be fabricated [70].
If the electron beam is carefully focused, individual nanowires with controlled connec-
tions to the monolayer can be created. Two kinds of nanowires with different stoichiometry
have been fabricated this way: MX (M = Mo or W, X = S or Se) in Fig. 20.8(a) [71] and
Mo5S4 in Fig. 20.8(b) [72]. Although MX nanowires have been chemically synthesized

before and proven to be metallic [73–75], it is difﬁcult to integrate them seamlessly into a
corresponding semiconducting 2H lattice necessary for many electronics applications. The
designated connect points between nanowires and monolayer can be controllably formed
by steering focused electron beam irradiation. The fabricated MX nanowires shows robust
metallicity even under severe mechanical deformation, and thus can potentially serve as
interconnects in future ﬂexible electronics. On the other hand, Mo5S4 nanowire is predicted
to be a semiconductor with sizeable band gap, and shows robust mechanical strength as
well. The top-bottom electron–beam-based technique shows encouraging potential in
patterning the 1D-to-2D connection with sub-1 nm precision. Various nanostructures
derived from 2D TMDCs, as discussed above, provide versatile building blocks for
integrated circuits and forward the development of nanoelectronics.

Summary
In summary, defects in 2D materials are rich in variety, from point defects to disloca-
tions, grain boundaries, and linear interfaces. They have a profound impact on elec-
tronic and optical properties (often enhanced by the reduced screening [76] due to low
dimensionality and vacuum, non-dielectric environment). Openness of all 2D materials
makes the defect atomic structure highly dependent on the thermodynamics of the
environment [77], for instance the gas phase, when each defect makeup can respond
almost immediately to the partial gas pressures or temperature, or to the gate-potential
controlled Fermi level. This brings about the qualitatively new volatile nature of the

defects in comparison to the “claustrophobic” 3D bulk situation. Lastly, although all the
above-mentioned structures constitute a departure from the ideal crystalline order and
can justiﬁably be called defects, this does not necessarily always imply a detrimental
role. As we see, defects can also bring their own useful functionality, serving as
electrical channels, magnetic elements, catalytic centers, and more.

Theoretical Overview of Black
Phosphorus
Andrey Chaves, Wei Ji, Jesse Maassen, Traian Dumitrică and Tony Low
In this chapter, we discuss the electronic and optoelectronic properties of few-layer
BP, a layered semiconductor that can be exfoliated from bulk black phosphorus (BP),
the most stable allotrope of phosphorus [1, 2, 3]. Just like graphite, this elemental
layered material is composed of layers of atoms organized in a stable linked-rings
structure, where the layers are held together by weak van der Waals forces, which
facilitates its exfoliation into few-layers form from its bulk parent. However, the
atomic rings in black-phosphorus layers exhibit a puckered structure, resulting in
the opening of a gap in its electronic spectrum and yielding strongly anisotropic
in-plane properties, such as angle-dependent electrical and thermal conductivities,
as well as excitonic polarization. Moreover, the observed high carrier mobilities
of 1000 cm2=V s along its light effective mass direction makes it promising for
electronic applications [4, 5, 6, 8].
In fact, the unique crystal structure and anisotropic properties of bulk BP has drawn
attention to this material for decades, from the 1950s to the 1980s [2]. Interest on this
material has been renewed since 2014, when its exfoliation into few-layers was ﬁrst
demonstrated [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], allowing for its fabrication as an atomically thin semicon-
ductor, whose optical band gap and electronic properties are controllable by the number
of layers. For instance, the optical band gap of BP is found to range from 0.3 eV, in bulk
BP, to 1:6 eV, in monolayer BP [1, 2, 7, 9, 10], making it a promising material for
optoelectronics across a wide spectrum [11, 12, 13, 14, 15].
In what follows, we discuss the theory of the electronic band structure, the optical,
electronic, thermal and mechanical properties of monolayer to few-layer black-
phosphorus.
21.1
Crystal and Electronic Band Structures
The crystal structure of bulk BP is shown in Fig. 21.1(a) along with the ﬁrst Brillouin zone
schemes of bulk and monolayer BP in Fig. 21.1(b), where high-symmetry points
are highlighted. Their two main in-plane directions, namely, zig-zag and armchair,
are labeled. Bulk and monolayer BP have a base-centered orthorhombic [Cmce space group
(No. 64)] and simple orthorhombic [Pmna space group (No. 53)] crystal structures [16],
respectively, both with four P atoms per primitive cell. Their crystal structures are deﬁned

by DFT calculations [10], are a ¼ 4:47 Å, b ¼ 3:34 Å, and c ¼ 10:71 Å, for bulk BP,
and a ¼ 4:58 Åand b ¼ 3:32 Åfor monolayer BP.
The electronic band structure of bulk and few-layer BP has been investigated by
several groups, using ab initio techniques with different levels of approximation,
mostly using the Becke three parameters Lee–Yang–Par functional (B3LYP) [7],
the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) [10], and Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)
functionals [8, 10]. In general, due to the weak interlayer coupling, an appropriate
treatment of van der Waals interactions in the DFT calculations is required,
especially in the bulk and multi-layer cases. Particularly, monolayer BP has a
predicted direct band gap of ~1.5 eV with hybridized [10] or meta-GGA
functionals [10, 17], 0.7 eV to 1.0 eV with GGA functionals [7, 18, 19], 1.2 to 1.6
eV (optical gap) and 2.0 to 2.3 eV (fundamental gap) for GW methods [9, 20, 21], and
2.15 eV with the B3LYP functionals [7]. Among all these various methods, GW is
regarded as the most reliable one in obtaining electronic band gaps closer to experi-
mental values.
Figure 21.2 presents a general overview of the band structures of few-layer BP with
n ¼ 1, 2, and 3 layers, as well as of bulk BP, as obtained by GW calculations [22]. Dark
lines are results obtained by a tight-binding model, which agree with the GW results in
the vicinity of the Γ point. The band structure for any number of layers exhibits a direct
gap around the Γ point of the ﬁrst Brillouin zone. This gap decreases with the number
of layers n as Egap ¼ AeBn=nC þ D, with A ¼ 1:71 eV, B ¼ 0:17, C ¼ 0:73, and
D ¼ 0:4 eV [22]. Notice that, using this expression, the bulk limit n ! ∞leads to
Egap ! 0:4 eV, very close to the well-known 0.3 eV gap for bulk black phosphorus [2].
We will discuss in more detail the effect of interlayer coupling and stacking on the
electronic gap below.

band states are both even with respect to σh and, therefore, only kx terms appear in the
off-diagonal of the effective Hamiltonian matrix.
The second-order terms in the effective Hamiltonian come from remote band contri-
butions, within quasi-degenerate perturbation theory, also known as the Löwdin parti-
tion method. This method consists in ﬁnding an unitary transformation H ¼ eSHeS on

by DFT. Examples of values for these parameters are provided, e.g., in [11]. Notice that,
although the Hamiltonian Eq. (21.2) presents linear momentum terms in the off-
diagonals, they are complex, so that the ﬁnal energy spectrum presents no linear
momentum terms, thus preserving time-reversal symmetry [23].
In the following section, we will demonstrate that a similar low-energy Hamiltonian
can also be obtained from a tight-binding model.

the tight-binding Hamiltonian HTB with, for example, the matrix elements of the GW
Hamiltonian for the same system, written on the basis of localized Wannier functions, as
ﬁrst carried out in [9].

21.1.2
Interlayer Coupling and Stacking
The band gap of few-layer BP is of particular interest, since it is drastically reduced by
adding only one additional layer. In fact, few-layer BP has the strongest layer-
dependent modulation of the electronic band gap among all 2D materials being reported
so far. Figure 21.5 summarizes the predicted band gap as a function of the thickness of
BP layers, which, as previously discussed, shows exponential decay as the thickness
increases, regardless of which functional was used in the calculations. Interestingly
enough, the band gap numerically extrapolated to the case of an inﬁnite number of
layers is slightly larger than that calculated from a real bulk sample, which is a result of
the shortened lattice constant in the few-layers case.
Interlayer coupling plays a critical role in the resulting band-gap evolution of BP. Its
differential charge density (Fig. 21.6) explicitly shows a covalent-like characteristic in
the interlayer region of few-layer BP, in which charge reduction was found near the
P atoms and charge accumulation was observed in-between the interlayer P atoms. If we

adopt a molecular orbital language for a simple analysis, each P atom takes the sp3
hybridization, thus forming three covalent bonds and leaving one electron pair pointing
almost in the out-of-plane direction. The interlayer van der Waals attraction is so strong
that it brings the two BP layers close enough so that the two electron pairs of the two
P atoms from the approaching layers are forced to hybridize, thus showing a bonding
and an anti-bonding state. Such substantial electronic hybridization distinguishes the
interlayer coupling of BP from that of other 2D materials discussed in this book. In
order emphasize this specialty, the term “covalent-like BP quasi-bonding” has been
proposed to denote this vdW attraction-induced electronic hybridization [26].
Electronic band gaps of few-layer BP are largely determined by the interlayer
electronic hybridization, which can be affected by the interlayer distance and the
stacking order between the two layers. There are, at least, three types of stacking orders,
namely AA, AB, and AC, see Fig. 21.7(a). The AB-stacked BP is the most widely
investigated and has the lowest energy among the three [21, 27]. Results previously
presented in Fig. 21.2 were obtained assuming this type of stacking. If we laterally shift
one layer of a bilayer BP, the band gap varies by 0.2–0.4 eV due to the change in
Fig. 21.5 Electronic band gap of few-layer BP as a function of layer thickness, as predicted by DFT
calculations with different functionals [7, 10, 20, 21, 25].

density and ρ3LBPu and ρ3LBPd represent the total charge densities of the upper and lower halves
of the system, respectively. Light-color contours indicate charge accumulation, whereas
dark-color ones stand for charge reduction [26].

interlayer hybridization, as predicted by different methods and shown in Fig. 21.7(b).
The variation in optical band gaps become even larger if more layers are stacked on a
bilayer BP. For instance, a ~0.6 eV change in optical band gap has been reported for an
ACA stacked tri-layer BP with the G0W0 method. Nevertheless, the exciton binding
energy is almost unchanged among different stacked conﬁgurations [21].
21.2
Electronic Properties
In this section, we discuss some basic electronic properties of BP, highlighting its
highly anisotropic aspects, which make it uniquely different from conventional 2D
electron gas systems.
21.2.1
In-Plane Polarizability and Screening
It is well known that the polarizability of a conventional 2D electron gas is given by the
density of its states. The dielectric function of an electron gas in the random phase
approximation (RPA) can then be written in terms of its polarizability Π as [28]
ϵðq
!, ωÞ ¼ κ þ vc q
ð Þ Πðq
!, ωÞ,
(21.15)
where vc q
ð Þ ¼ e2=2ϵ0q is the 2D Coulomb interaction, q
! is the plasmon wavevector, ϵ0
is the permittivity of free space, and κ the effective dielectric constant of its environ-
ment. Πðq
!, ωÞ is the 2D dynamic polarizability, whose expression can be found in
standard textbooks on 2D electron gas systems [29]. In an anisotropic medium such as
BP, Πðq
!, ωÞ in general is also anisotropic and depends on the direction of q
!, a quantity
that has to be computed numerically [30].
In the static limit, however, it is possible to obtain a closed-form expression for the
BP polarizability. We generalize the well-known analytical form of the polarizability for
Fig. 21.7 Atomic conﬁguration and predicted band gap of three stacking orders for bilayer BP.

21.2.2
Plasmons
Plasmons in 2D materials have attracted signiﬁcant attention recently as they provide an
interesting platform for enhanced light–matter interactions [31, 32, 33, 34]. with an
isotropic media such as graphene, the in-plane plasmon dispersion just follows the simple

Here, we discuss the plasmon dispersion in an anisotropic media such as BP [30].
Consider a BP ﬁlm in the xy plane sandwiched between two dielectric media ϵ1 and ϵ2.
We are interested in the bound electromagnetic modes, characterized by an in-plane
wavevector q

equations, one can show that the bound mode has to satisfy the following equation:

the Drude weight is now directional dependent. Hence, Eq. (21.20) in conjunction with
Eq. (21.21) will provide the dispersion of the plasmon in an anisotropic media such
as BP.
21.2.3
Electrical Transport
As a consequence of its anisotropic electronic structures, the carrier mobility and
electronic transport properties in BP are highly directional. In general, the mobility
might be reduced by phonon, impurity, and interface scatterings. Among them, the
phonon scattering is intrinsic at room temperature, but the impurity scattering could be
largely suppressed by reducing defect concentration and an optimized metal–
semiconductor or semiconductor–insulator interface structure could highly improve
interface scattering. The phonon-limited mobility is determined by the scattering of
carriers, with both elastic acoustic and inelastic optical phonon scattering processes. At
room temperature the elastic acoustic scattering process is dominant, and, therefore,
the discussion in the rest of this section is focused on the elastic acoustic phonon-
carrier scattering process.
Theory predicts rather high hole mobilities in free-standing pristine mono- to ﬁve-
layer BP along the armchair x
ð Þ direction, while those along the zig-zag y
ð Þ direction are
several times smaller, and so is the electron mobility. The hole mobility increases from a
few hundred up to several thousands cm2=V s with respect to the enlarged thickness,
based on an elastic acoustic phonon-carrier scattering model [10]. The difference
between mobilities in different directions can be partially explained by the anisotropic
carrier effective masses: both hole and electron effective masses along the ΓX direc-
tion in the k space (associated to the x direction in real-space) are roughly ten times
smaller than those along the ΓY y
ð Þ direction, namely 0:15 m0 versus 1:0 m0 in the
monolayer case, as discussed in previous sections. At the extreme case, namely hole
effective masses of monolayer, the factor of difference is over 40, namely 0:15 m0
versus 6:35 m0, as calculated by DFT. One may notice, though, that these values are
several times larger than the experimentally measured mobility anisotropy ratio [4, 36].
As a matter of fact, the impurity scattering and the interfacial Coulomb scattering are,
most likely, sufﬁcient to reduce the mobility of BP by an order of magnitude, namely
down to hundreds of cm2=V s in few layers, consistent with experimental values.
The acoustic phonon-limited carrier mobility in 2D is given by the expression

Optical Properties
21.3.1
Optical Absorption
BP exhibits strong anisotropy for light absorption. Within a wide energy range, includ-
ing infrared light and part of visible light, few-layer black phosphorus absorbs light
polarized along the structures’ armchair direction and is transparent to light polarized
along the zig-zag direction. Such light-absorption anisotropy is a result of the under-
lying symmetries of wave functions for the valence and conduction bands, which
govern the dipole transitions and thus optical absorption. The dipole transition along
the y direction (ΓY in the k space) around the band gap, namely from VBM to CBM,
is largely suppressed because of the similarity of the shape of wave functions of the
valence and conduction bands along this direction. Figure 21.8 shows the absorption

tage of the observed highly polarized light absorption, a possible experimental setup for
determining the orientation of few-layer BP structures is proposed in Fig. 21.8(c) [11].
In addition to the polarization-dependent light absorption, the absorption spectra of
multilayer black phosphorus are shown to vary sensitively with thickness and doping.
As we discussed in earlier sections, the (direct) band gap decreases with the thickness.

towards lower energies and eventually reaches 0.3 eV (for bulk BP). It is interesting to
point out that the thicker the sample, the more peaky the spectra. These peaks are
ascribed to the band dispersion of valence and conduction bands and the intersubbands
transition from a certain valence subband to the associated conduction subband. Charge
doping, regarded as a shift in chemical potential μ, as shown in Fig. 21.8(f), can be
realized by either electrically gating or chemically introducing charge donor or acceptor
impurities. Extra electrons shift the band edge in the absorption spectra towards higher
energies, as veriﬁed in Fig. 21.8(g) because of the Pauli blocking by the extra charges of
the direct optical transition [11]. Ideally, this blue-shift is 2μ, but the peak is also
smeared out in energy due to ﬁnite-temperature effects.
In the above-mentioned, optical transitions are described within the single-particle
picture. However, many-body effects, such as excitons, usually dominate the optical
spectra, especially at low temperatures. In what follows, we will describe how to predict
the position of the lower energy peak in absorption spectrum, namely, the optical gap,
as well as other excited state peaks that would show up in low-temperature reﬂectance
measurements.
21.3.2
Excitons
In light mediated experiments in semiconductors, electrons are either excited from the
valence band to the conduction band, leaving a positively charged quasi-particle (hole)
in the former, as in absorption and reﬂectance measurements, or recombined with holes
in the valence band to produce photoluminescence. Either way, the energy involved in
these processes is easily detectable as peaks in the absorption and photoluminescence
spectra. The lowest energy peak is the so-called optical gap, which consists of the bare
quasi-particle gap between the top of the valence band and the bottom of the conduction
band, deduced by the binding energy between the electron and hole involved in the
process. Remarkably high electron–hole (exciton) binding energies is a feature shared
by all 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides and few-layer black
phosphorus [40, 47, 42]. For WS2, for example, a 320 meV exciton binding energy
has been experimentally observed by reﬂectance experiments, which also reveal a very
clear set of peaks that were interpreted as a Rydberg series of excited excitonic states, in
a clear analogy between the bound electron–hole pair and a planar hydrogen atom [41].
As for black phosphorus, photoluminescence measurements have consistently sug-
gested binding energies of the order of hundreds meV [1, 7], and even trions (charged
exciton complexes, i.e. with an extra electron or hole) with binding energies of tens of
meV [43].
Such high binding energies are due to the fact that, unlike in bulk semiconductors, the
electron–hole Coulomb interaction in these materials undergoes a much lower screening
by the vacuum surrounding the sample, or by the substrate below it. This situation is
illustrated in Fig. 21.9, where the different screening factors are represented by separ-
ations between electric-ﬁeld lines. Notice that the different dielectric media can only
play a role on the overall interaction potential for small electron–hole separations, when

electric-ﬁeld lines are distributed along both vacuum and the layer. However, as the
electron–hole separation increases in the quasi-two-dimensional (monolayer) case, most
of the electric-ﬁeld lines end up outside the semiconductor, so that the contribution of
the semiconductor layer is smeared out and the Coulomb interaction potential is
expected to be recovered. This suggests an effective dielectric constant that depends
on the electron–hole separation, which turns out to be the case, as we will demonstrate
in what follows.
Screened Electron–Hole Interaction Potential
The actual interaction potential for charged particles in a layer surrounded by different
dielectric constants media was ﬁrst derived by Keldysh in the 1970s [44], and recently
revisited by several papers in the literature in the context of 2D semiconductors [45]. In
other words, Poisson equation is solved to obtain the electrostatic potential Φðr!Þ

So far, the interaction potential has been developed for a suspended layer, i.e.
surrounded by vacuum both above and below the sample. Most of the 2D materials
investigated in the literature are however deposited on a substrate. In fact, the original
derivation of Eq. (21.28) by Keldysh [44] was done for a slab with ﬁnite thickness d and
dielectric constant ϵ, on top of a semi-inﬁnite medium of dielectric constant ϵ2.
Nevertheless, this derivation leads to the same potential as in Eq. (21.28), but slightly
modiﬁed, with r0 ! dϵ= 1 þ ϵ2

Wannier–Mott Exciton Hamiltonian
Once the interaction potential is known, the exciton binding energy can be calculated
within the Wannier–Mott model, where the exciton wave function is assumed to cover a
large region of the material, involving several atoms. In this case, one can treat electrons
and holes as effectively free quasi-particles in conduction and valence bands, respect-
ively, interacting via the screened Coulomb potential in Eq. (21.28). In this context, the

where the center of mass terms were dropped, since they commute with Hexc and thus
are constants of motion.
Exciton Eigenstates
By solving Eq. (21.30), one obtains the exciton spectrum in black phosphorus, which is
shown in Fig. 21.10(a) for n ¼ 1 (squares), 2 (triangles), 3 (circles), and 4 (stars)-layers
BP. The exciton eigenfunctions of the four lowest energy states of the monolayer case
are shown in Fig. 21.10(b), where the eigenfunctions symmetry is indicated. Although,
in general, the electron–hole pair resembles a hydrogen atom, three main differences are
observed as compared to the latter: (i) the Rydberg series of s states does not follow the
Eb ¼ Ry= n  1=2
ð
Þ2 rule, where Ry is the Rydberg energy, (ii) the s and p states are
not degenerate, and (iii) px and py states are also not degenerate. Differences (i) and (ii)
are ubiquitous of all 2D materials, as a consequence of the non-Coulombic electron–
hole interaction. The lift of s=p degeneracy is related to the break of the SO(3)
symmetry of the Coulomb potential, whereas the non-hydrogenic Rydberg series can
be explained by a energy-dependent dielectric constant, in accordance with Eq. (21.27).
As for (iii), the px=py degeneracy is left as a direct consequence of the effective mass
anisotropy of BP.

Results in Fig. 21.10(a) are calculated for a system deposited on a silica substrate,
with dielectric constant ϵ2 ¼ 3:9ϵ0. It is however important to investigate the depend-
ence of the exciton ground-state binding energy on the dielectric constant of the
substrate, in order to predict corrections on the observed optical gap due to different
substrates or even in the case of a suspended sample (i.e. ϵ2 ¼ ϵ0). This is shown in
Fig. 21.10(c) for n ¼ 1 to 4-layers BP, where we observe that as the dielectric constant
of the substrate increases, the binding energies decrease due to the stronger screening,
yielding a redshift of excitonic peaks. Results for the case of a suspended sample agree
well with those obtained by more sophisticated calculations involving GW approxima-
tion and Bethe–Salpeter equations [20].
From Fermi’s golden rule, one obtains the transitions between exciton levels that are
allowed to occur. Absorbed and emitted light in processes mediated by excitons is
shown to be polarized along the x (armchair) direction, which is consistent with
experimental results, as stated in previous sections. Moreover, in usual absorption
experiments, which involve one-photon processes, only s states are optically active.
The oscillator strength is then given by the square modulus of the exciton envelope
function at x ¼ 0; y ¼ 0
ð
Þ, which is non-zero for s states [47]. The oscillator strength of
the ground and second excited exciton states of few-layer BP, which are demonstrated
to be s states in Fig. 21.10(b), are shown in Fig. 21.11 as a function of the number of
layers. Notice the oscillator strength for the second excited state is almost two orders of
magnitude lower than that of the ground state, which makes this state much harder to
probed experimentally. Besides, as the number of layers increase, the electron–hole
interaction becomes weaker, leading to wider envelope functions and, consequently, to
lower oscillator strengths.

21.4
Thermal Properties
The thermal properties of black phosphorus (BP) are discussed in this section. As will
be shown, the particular puckered atomic structure of the P atoms in BP leads to unusual
thermal properties that are unique to this material and that can be beneﬁcial for certain
applications related to thermal management and thermoelectric conversion.
21.4.1
Phonons
Phonon dispersion
Phonons, the discrete quanta of atomic vibrational excitations, are dominantly respon-
sible for the thermal properties of BP. Using ﬁrst-principle modeling to extract the force
constants characterizing the interatomic potential, the dynamical matrix is diagonalized
to obtain the phonon energies [48], which are plotted for bulk and monolayer BP in
Figures 21.12(a) and (b), respectively, along the high-symmetry points in the Brillouin
zone previously shown in Fig. 21.1. Each atom in the primitive cell has three degrees of
freedom, leading to 12 phonon modes: three acoustic and nine optical. In bulk BP, the
three acoustic modes (one longitudinal and two transverse) have a linear dispersion in
the vicinity of the Brillouin zone center, while in monolayer BP, the cross-plane
polarized acoustic mode (ZA mode) has a quadratic dispersion, as is typical in 2D
materials [49]. Several theoretical reports have investigated the phonon properties of
black phosphorus [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54].
From the slopes of the longitudinal acoustic phonon dispersion, one can extract
the sound velocities along zig-zag direction and armchair direction, giving 8429 m/s
(zig-zag) and 4313 m/s (armchair) for bulk BP, and 7955 m/s (zig-zag) and 4037 m/s
(armchair) for monolayer BP. The anisotropic sound velocity is directly related to the
particular crystal structure of BP, and is similar for both bulk and monolayer. The
acoustic modes travel at higher speed along the zig-zag direction since all bonds are in
the same plane as the phonon motion, and thus “stiffer” than in the armchair direction
where half the atomic bonds are nearly perpendicular (cross-plane) to the direction of
phonon transport. The angle dependence in sound velocities suggests that the in-plane
thermal transport properties will also be anisotropic. Figure 21.12 also labels which

phonon modes at the G point are Raman active. Raman scattering experiments can be
used, for example, to determine the crystal orientation of BP samples, probe local
temperatures, and measure induced strains [53, 55].
Phonon Transport
To calculate the phonon transport properties of BP, the Landauer approach [56] is
employed. Within the Landauer formalism for solving the Boltzmann transport
equation, there are two main quantities of interest: the number of conducting phonon
modes (or channels), Mph, and the phonon mean-free-path for backscattering, λph: Mph
is proportional to the product of the average velocity in the direction of transport jvxj

where h is Planck’s constant. It depends only on the phonon dispersion of BP, and can
be efﬁciently computed using the so-called band counting algorithm [57] as imple-
mented in the LanTraP simulation tool [58]. λph is deﬁned as the average distance
travelled by a phonon along the transport direction before scattering from a forward-
moving state to a reverse-moving state, which depends on the phonon dispersion and
the scattering physics

Figure 21.13(a) shows the number of phonon modes per cross-section, Mph, versus
phonon energy, E, for bulk BP with transport along zig-zag and armchair directions.
Mph is larger along the zig-zag direction compared to the armchair direction, particularly
for the low-energy acoustic modes (less than 18 meV), which typically carry most of the
heat. The angle dependence in the phonon channels is related to the anisotropy in the
group velocities, which is larger along the zig-zag compared to the armchair direction.
Each phonon mode carries one quantum of thermal conductance, K0 ¼ πkB

corresponds to the thermal conductance of phonons in the ballistic transport limit
(a quantity that is independent of the length of the sample). Kball is roughly 1.5 larger
along the zig-zag versus the armchair direction and increases monotonically as more
phonon modes become thermally active at higher temperature.

Obtaining the phonon mean-free-path distribution requires knowing the dominant
scattering physics. Typically, in bulk materials, the dominant scattering mechanisms
for phonons are phonon–phonon (Umklapp) scattering, boundary scattering, and defect
scattering [56], while for thin ﬁlms surface scattering can become important [59]. First-
principle calculations of thermal conductivity in monolayer BP, obtained from solutions
of the Boltzmann transport equations including intrinsic three-phonon Umklapp scat-
tering rates, predict notable anisotropy, with κ in the range 30–110 W/m-K and 14–36
W/m-K for transport along the zig-zag and the armchair direction, respectively. To date,
there are no experimental results on the thermal transport properties of monolayer BP.
However, recent studies have probed the thermal transport properties of BP thin ﬁlms
[55, 60, 61] with submicron thicknesses down to 10 nm. The in-plane measured thermal
conductivities show anisotropic ratios in the range of 1.5–2.0, with zig-zag being the
preferential transport direction. In addition, κ is found to increase with increasing ﬁlm
thickness, a signature of surface scattering of phonons. To model the in-plane thermal

transport properties of the BP thin ﬁlms, Umklapp phonon–phonon scattering and
surface roughness scattering are included, both using phenomenological models and
parameters described in [55].
Figure 21.13(c) presents the in-plane ﬁlm thermal conductivity κfilm versus BP ﬁlm
thickness, t, as a function of transport direction (markers: experiment; lines: theory).
Theoretical modeling results are found to compare well with the measurements, captur-
ing both the anisotropy and the thickness dependence of κfilm. According to the model,
the observed anisotropy in κfilm originates from Mph (or Kball), as opposed to strong
angle-dependent phonon scattering. To understand how the different phonons contrib-
ute to the thermal conductivity, Fig. 21.13(d) shows the cumulative phonon thermal
conductivity as a function of the phonon mean-free-path for backscattering, λph. Com-
paring the case of bulk BP to that of a 10 nm-thick BP ﬁlm, we ﬁnd that surface
scattering signiﬁcantly reduces λph and, in particular, the phonons with the longest λph.
As an example, in a 10 nm-thick BP ﬁlm, roughly 90% of the heat is carried by phonons
with λph less than 100 nm, compared to only 10–20% in bulk BP. Such plots are also
useful for identifying the phonons that contribute most to κ (points of steepest slope),
which can be selectively scattered in cases where low κ is desired, for example in
thermoelectric applications [62, 63].
21.4.2
Thermoelectricity
By coupling the phonon transport properties – described in the previous section – with
the electronic transport properties, we can evaluate the thermoelectric (TE) performance
of BP. The unusual in-plane transport of BP is found to be beneﬁcial for TE conversion.
The efﬁciency of TE conversion, which uses a heat source to generate electrical power
or conversely uses an electrical current to achieve cooling, is characterized by the TE
ﬁgure-of-merit, ZT, which can span from zero to inﬁnity (the Carnot efﬁciency is
reached as ZT ! ∞). ZT is written as S2σT=κ, where S is the Seebeck coefﬁcient,
σ the electrical conductivity, T the temperature, and κ ¼ κel þ κph is the thermal
conductivity with contributions from both electrons and phonons. The goal is to
increase S2σ, also known as the power factor, PF (which has historically proven
difﬁcult), and to decrease κ (which has led to record ZT values in the past decade).
Several, mostly theoretical, studies have investigated the thermoelectric properties of
BP [37, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71], which shows an interesting anisotropic behavior, as we will
discuss below.
Using the Landauer approach, TE parameters can be calculated, allowing one to
assess the TE performance of BP [64]. Similarly to the phonon transport properties, the
electron transport properties depend on two main quantities: the number of conducting
electron modes (or channels), Mel, and the electron mean-free-path for backscattering,
λel: Mel depends only on the electron band structure, while λel depends on the particular
scattering physics, as well as on the electron dispersion. Note that the expressions for
the number of electron modes, Mel, and the electron mean-free-path for backscattering,
λel, are identical to those for phonons (i.e. Mph and λph). Figure 21.14(a) presents the
number of electron modes per cross-section, Mel, versus energy, E, for bulk BP with
402

transport along the zig-zag and the armchair direction. Mel is largest with transport
along the armchair direction, due to the larger effective mass along the zig-zag direc-
tion. BP possesses unusual in-plane anisotropy, where the preferential transport direc-
tions are orthogonal for electrons (armchair) and phonons (zig-zag). This orthogonal
anisotropy is beneﬁcial for TE operation since PF is maximized and κph is minimized
(κph is larger than κel in BP) with transport along the armchair direction. Each electron
mode carries one quantum of conductance, 2e2=h, where e is the electron charge. From
the number of modes Mel, the ballistic conductance, Gball, can be straightforwardly
calculated [65]. Figure 21.14(b) shows Gball versus carrier concentration, which corres-
ponds to the conductance of electrons in the ballistic transport limit (a quantity that is
independent of the length of the sample). Gball is signiﬁcantly larger, roughly 5, with
transport oriented along the armchair direction.
Electrical conductivity σ is obtained by multiplying Gball by the average electron
mean-free-path for backscattering [64]. Typically in bulk TE materials the dominant
scattering mechanisms for electrons are electron–phonon scattering and impurity
scattering, as well as surface roughness scattering for thin ﬁlms. First-principle calcula-
tions of electron–acoustic phonon scattering within the deformation potential approach
have predicted electron/hole mobilities as high as thousands to tens of thousands of
cm2 V1 s1 in few-layer BP, with anisotropy ratios greater than 30 in monolayer BP
[10]. Regarding the TE properties of bulk, monolayer, nanoribbon, alloyed, and strained
BP, theoretical calculations have predicted optimal ZT values over a wide range from
0.72 to 6.4 [37, 67, 68, 69, 70]. For comparison, state-of-the-art TE materials have ZT
greater than unity with record values in the range 2–3. Experimentally few works have
probed the TE characteristics of BP [71]. Here, the TE performance of few-layer BP is

assessed by calibrating our theoretical model to existing experimental data. Using the
measured angle-dependent electronic mobility of few-layer BP [4, 8], we ﬁnd λel is
equal to 38 nm (zig-zag) and 13 nm (armchair) for an 8 nm-thick BP ﬁlm, and 56 nm
(zig-zag) and 19 nm (armchair) for a 15 nm-thick BP ﬁlm [4]. Note that BP is experi-
mentally p-type, so that the present model is thus calibrated for hole conduction.
Figure 21.14(c) shows the electrical conductivity σ versus hole concentration for BP
ﬁlms of thickness 8 nm and 15 nm. The anisotropy ratio in σ is roughly 1.5–2.0, which
is less than that of Gball. The thicker ﬁlm has higher σ, due to reduced surface scattering.
Figure 21.14(d) presents the Seebeck coefﬁcient, S, as a function of carrier concen-
tration (with an energy-independent λel, S does not depend on λel or ﬁlm thickness). S is
found to be relatively insensitive to BP orientation. Interestingly, at high carrier concen-
tration there is a peak in S for n-type BP, and an associated increase in Gball, due to a
secondary band. This suggests that BP could potentially be a better n-type TE material,
as opposed to p-type.
Having calculated all the TE parameters (both electron and phonon), which are
calibrated to available experimental data, we can assess the TE potential of few-layer
BP. Figure 21.15(a) shows the power factor, PF ¼ S2σ, versus hole concentration for BP
ﬁlms of thickness 8 nm and 15 nm. PF reaches 20 μW=cm-K2, which is a respectable
value when compared to good TE materials such as Bi2Te3 30 μW=cm-K2


. The
anisotropy is similar to that in σ. The thicker ﬁlm achieves a larger PF due to reduced
surface roughness scattering. The TE ﬁgure-of-merit, ZT, is presented in Fig. 21.15(b)
as a function of hole concentration and BP ﬁlm thickness. The anisotropy ratio reaches 3
for ZT, with the highest ZT along the armchair direction, which results from the
orthogonal preferential transport directions for electrons and phonons. ZT is nearly
thickness insensitive, since the surface roughness scattering reduces both σ (numerator
of ZT) and κph (denominator of ZT). The maximum ZT at room temperature approaches
0.04 with a hole concentration of 5  1018 cm3. While good TE materials should have
ZT above unity, these results are calibrated to some of the ﬁrst experimental reports and
should improve as the approaches and material quality improves. By comparison, other
2D materials (monolayer and few-layer) have experimentally shown large PF values,
such as 85 μW=cm-K2 in few-layer MoS2 [72], but large thermal conductivities in the
range of 50 W/m-K [73] keep ZT low.

Mechanical Properties – Elasticity
The structural anisotropy of BP is also manifested in a highly directional-dependent
elastic behavior. The in-plane linear elastic behavior can be modeled with an orthotropic
continuum plate model, with the principal axes oriented along the armchair (A) and the
zig-zag (Z) direction. Figure 21.16(a) shows the deformation along one preferential
direction, such as the Z direction. Upon application of unit stress σZ,7 the plate elongates
along Z while shrinking in the A direction. We characterize this deformation by the
strains εZ ¼ 1=EZ and ϵA ¼ νZεZ. Here EZ and νZ are the Young’s modulus and
Poisson’s ratio associated with the Z direction, respectively. Figure 21.16(b) describes
the deformation in the general case, in which the stress is applied along the arbitrary
y direction, which makes an angle θ with the Z direction. The orthotropic plate captures
the shear-extension coupling, i.e. the applied σy leads not only to extension strain along
y εy

associated to the xy Cartesian system relate to the corresponding set of values along the
principal axis via closed-form expressions given elsewhere [74]. The shear-strain
coupling coefﬁcients ηx and ηy are directly proportional to sin θ, so that they vanish
when the xy Cartesian system coincides with the principal one.
The orthotropic model reduces to an isotropic plate model when EA ¼ EZ ¼ E,
νA ¼ νZ ¼ ν and the shear modulus writes G ¼ E=2 1 þ ν
ð
Þ. The coupling coefﬁcients
ηx and ηy vanish in this case, and rotation of Cartesian coordinates system yields no
change in the stress–strain relation. If we apply unit stress in the y-direction (i.e.
σy ¼ 1 and σx ¼ σyx ¼ 0), then consequent strains would be εx ¼ 1=E (extension),
εy ¼ νεx (compression), and εxy ¼ 0. The isotropic model is suitable for modeling,
e.g. the in-plane deformation of graphene [75, 76] and blue phosphorene [66].
The set of elastic constants along the principal axes can be calculated from atomistic-
level calculations. Ab initio calculations obtained that, for the monolayer BP, the
Young’s modulus of 166 GPa in the zig-zag direction is 3.8 times larger than its
counterpart in the armchair direction. For three-layer BP, its value in the Z direction,
160 GP, is 4.3 times larger than its counterpart in the armchair direction [77]. The shear
modulus for the monolayer GZA ¼ GAZ was found to be 41 GPa. We note that compared
to other 2D materials, such as graphene and MoS2, BP presents a smaller Young’s

From here onwards, the variable σi denotes stress in the i-direction.

modulus. For example, the reported Young’s moduli for graphene and MoS2 are 1.0
TPa [78] and 0.25 TPa [79], respectively. This smaller Young’s modulus in BP may be
the result of the weaker P—P bond strength and the signiﬁcant deformation of dihedral
angles rather than bond length stretch. For the same reason, the shear modulus of BP is
an order of magnitude smaller than the 472 GPa shear modulus of graphene [75].
As in the case of graphene, there is an uncertainty on the effective value of the layer
thickness. Thus, it is important to note that the Young’s modulus and shear modulus
values mentioned above incorporate a 5.5 Å thickness value for the monolayer and
16.65 Å for the three-layer BP [79].
Atomistic calculations also obtained that BP exhibits an anisotropic Poisson ratio. Its
value along the Z direction (0.62 from [77], 0.93 from [80]) is two to four times larger
than that in the A direction (0.17 from [77] 0.4 from [80]). Figure 21.17 presents the
directional dependence of the elastic constants and Poisson’s ratio as predicted with the
orthotropic model and the elastic constants obtained from a tight-binding potential [81].
Note that in order to avoid plate thickness ambiguity mentioned above, the theoretical
calculations summarized in Figs. 21.17(a)–(b) present the directional dependence of the
surface Young’s modulus Es
ð
Þ and surface shear modulus Gs
ð
Þ [66]. From these plots,
we observe that the relation Es ¼ Gs= 2 1 þ ν

½
 does not hold, meaning that an iso-
tropic membrane model cannot be associated to BP. The information summarized in
Fig. 21.17 can be used with Eq. (21.35) of the orthotropic plate model to describe the in-
plane deformation of BP along an arbitrary direction.
Black phosphorus presents anisotropic bending ﬂexibility, as illustrated in Fig. 21.18.
The bending constant along the Z direction, of 1,300 GPa Å3, is about 2.5 times larger
that along the A direction. These values are larger than the bending modulus of
graphene [76], of 230 GPa Å3. The anisotropic bending impacts the formation of out-
of-plane ripples under compressive strains. First-principles calculations demonstrated
that BP develops ripples along the Z direction [82], where the out-of-plane deformation
effectively releases the compressive strain energy, on the one hand. Compression-
induced deformation along the armchair direction is dominated by bond-angle distortion
without any appreciable ripple formation, on the other hand.
Moving beyond linear elasticity, theoretical ab initio calculations obtained that
BP can sustain tensile strains up to 27% and 30% in the zig-zag direction and
Fig. 21.16 Schematics of the deformation of an orthotropic material upon the application of stress
along (a) the zig-zag (Z) preferential and (b) an arbitrary (y) direction. The xy Cartesian system
associated with this direction makes an angle θ with the preferential AZ Cartesian system.

armchair direction, respectively [77]. A pronounced difference in the deformation
modes under different strain directions has been identiﬁed: while tensile strain in the
zig-zag direction induces a larger PP bond elongation, tensile strain applied in the
armchair direction stretches BP without signiﬁcantly extending the PP bond length.
Since ﬁrst-principle calculations are performed at 0 K, recent molecular dynamics
simulations examined phosphorene’s fracture behavior at ﬁnite temperatures. Tem-
perature plays a signiﬁcant role, with the fracture strength and strain diminishing by
more than 65% when increasing the temperature from absolute zero (0 K) to 450 K.
Thermal sensitivity also depends on the zig-zag direction or armchair direction [83].
At room temperature, the fracture strain of the defect-free BP in the zig-zag
(armchair) direction is 13% (6%).

Concluding Remarks
We have provided a general theoretical overview of the optical, electronic, thermoelec-
tric, and mechanical properties of bulk and few-layer black phosphorus. All these
properties show unusually large in-plane anisotropy that originates from BP’s particular
puckered atomic structure. These anisotropic properties makes BP an interesting mater-
ial in the 2D family.

Anisotropic Properties of Black
Phosphorus

The importance of discovering graphene has been not only to prove the existence of a
thermodynamically stable two-dimensional crystal, but also to exhibit a family of
materials with extremely high crystal quality [1–5]. The most exceptional electronic
quality in graphene is that the charge carriers can travel thousands of interatomic
distances without scattering. With this inherent advantage, the mobility of graphene
can approach 15,000 cm2/V s in ambient conditions, and even exceed 100,000 cm2/V s
at cryogenic temperature [5, 6]. Meanwhile, transfer characteristic of graphene also
stands out as it shows pronounced ambipolar behavior, where the charge carriers in
graphene can be tuned continuously between electrons and holes by applying an
external electric ﬁeld [7]. With such beneﬁts, the rise of graphene with one single
atomic layer thickness in the vertical direction, which is easily exfoliated owing to
the layer-to-layer van der Waals interaction, offers many new inroads into low-
dimensional physics that continues to surprise. One aspect of graphene that severely
limits its potential electronic application is the lack of band gap and the resulting large
off-state current during transistor operation [6, 7]. Various functionalized forms of
graphene can be generated, accompanied with certain values of energy gaps but with
the severe cost of the reduction in transport properties, such as degraded carrier
mobility [8, 9]. Alternatively, gapped semiconducting transition metal dichalcogen-
ides (TMDs) have been introduced into the 2D materials research in 2012. TMD
family materials are composed of strong X—M—X interlayer covalent bonds, where
M indicates the transition metal groups, and X represents chalcogenide atoms Se, S, or
Te. This family has been regarded as a promising candidate for a ﬁeld-effect transistor
(FET) with a relatively high on/off ratio and reasonable electron mobility [10–18]. In
addition to TMDs, it is interesting to explore new 2D semiconductors with much
higher carrier mobility and sizeable band-gap. Black phosphorus (BP), or phosphor-
ene, is one of the promising candidates, which has a narrow band-gap of 0.3 eV in
bulk form and 1.5–2.0 eV as a monolayer [19–23]. The discovery of BP can be
tracked back a century. It was ﬁrst accidentally synthesized from white phosphorus
under high temperature and high pressure [24]. Over the past century, the synthesis,
physical properties, and device applications of bulk BP have been investigated to
some extent [25–32]. The successful exfoliation of monolayer phosphorene and the
rediscovery of the superior transport properties of the ultra-thin BP ﬁlms have
generated a great deal of research interest in this nanomaterial [33–42]. BP does
bridge the gap between zero band-gap graphene and wide band-gap TMDs, thereby

providing a brand new venue to expand the scope of experimentally accessible 2D
crystals, and pursue a broad range of the transport studies.
This chapter summarizes the recent progress made in BP synthesis and the funda-
mental anisotropic properties from unique atomic structures. We will introduce BP
synthesis with respect to two different growth mechanisms: high hydrostatic pressure
synthesis and catalyst assisted synthesis. More importantly, this chapter will concentrate
on the puckered structure of the in-plane lattice, together with the coupled hinge-like
bonding conﬁgurations of BP. The intriguing crystal structure of BP has allowed us to
study its substantial anisotropic properties in terms of the electronic, photonic, thermal,
and mechanical behaviors. We will mostly focus on its electrical properties along with
its thermal and mechanical properties. Chapter 23 by Castellanos-Gomez et al. will
focus on the optical properties of BP and phosphorene.
22.1
Synthesis of Black Phosphorus
BP was ﬁrst discovered by Bridgman in 1914 [24] in an attempt to force ordinary white
phosphorus to change into red phosphorus by the application of high hydrostatic pressure
and high temperature. However, the transformation from white phosphorus to BP was not
quite completed in the early studies. There was a slight quantity of ordinary red phosphorus
formed, and throughout the mass of the BP there existed a few isolated patches in which
exceedingly minute traces of white phosphorus remained unchanged. In this section, we
will cover the brief history of BP synthesis, which was mainly achieved by engineering
through high hydrostatic pressure. In addition, we also include alternative techniques
without applying high pressure, especially catalyst developed synthesis techniques.
22.1.1
High Hydrostatic Pressure Synthesis
The mechanism of BP synthesis from white phosphorus or red phosphorus is directly
attributed to the phase transition process. Under high pressure, BP reversibly transits
from orthorhombic into rhombohedral at about 5 GPa, and then simple cubic at about
10 GPa. Notably, the above-mentioned phase transition process of BP is performed at
room temperature, indicating that BP synthesis heavily relies on pressure rather than
growth temperature. In 1914, Bridgman ﬁrst reported that white phosphorus can be
converted into BP under hydrostatic pressure of 1.2 GPa at 200 ºC within 5 to 30
minutes. With a further step of high pressure at 3.4 GPa, BP can also be prepared at
room temperature from white phosphorus. Next, Bridgman demonstrated that red
phosphorus can be converted into BP at room temperature, with ultra-high pressure of
8.5 GPa. In order to make the proof stronger, the substance formed from synthesis was
really a new modiﬁcation of phosphorus and not a compound. Preliminary character-
ization was conducted in BP, and it became evident that BP showed higher density of
2.69 g/cm3 compared to 1.83 g/cm3 for white phosphorus and 2.05–2.34 g/cm3 for red
phosphorus. Meanwhile, unlike white or red phosphorus, it did not catch ﬁre in air and
could not be ignited by ﬁre, and could sustain up to 400 ºC in air without spontaneous

ignition [43]. The same result was reproduced by Keyes under hydrostatic pressure of
1.3 GPa at 200 ºC [44]. The ingot achieved from this method was polycrystalline and
the grain size was roughly around 0.1 mm. It also became evident that BP was a good
conductor for both electrons and heat but less diamagnetic than white or red phos-
phorus. In 1981, large single crystals of BP were successfully synthesized from red
phosphorus melted at high temperatures under high pressure using a wedge-type cubic
high-pressure apparatus. Samples grown under 3.8 GPa higher than 270 ºC were
crystalized in a single crystal [45].
Recently, a scalable approach for the synthesis of large crystals was BP thin ﬁlms with
a thickness of around 40 nm, performed by Yale University [46]. Red phosphorus thin
ﬁlms were ﬁrst deposited on a ﬂexible substrate followed by conversion to BP thin ﬁlms
in a high-pressure multi-anvil cell at room temperature. This procedure follows the
Bridgman method; however, it allows fast and effective growth of the nanocrystalline
BP towards large-area synthesis on various substrates at high quality.
22.1.2
Catalyst Developed Synthesis
The solid structure of BP by the Bridgman method has been known to change from the
amorphous to polycrystalline form, depending on the applied pressure. However, we
should notice that such a method usually requires ultra-high pressure so as to make sure
the transformation from white/red phosphorus to BP is completed. In this section, we
will introduce the catalyst-based synthesis of BP, from the late 1950s, to the most recent
non-toxic reaction method. Brown and Rundqvist developed the mercury or bismuth-
ﬂux method to prepare BP. They revealed that BP starts to crystallize in orthorhombic
form and has an inﬁnite puckered layer structure [47–49]. White phosphorus was
puriﬁed with 15% HNO3 and then desolved in liquid bismuth. The mixture was heated
up to 400 ºC and kept for 20 hours and slowly cooled down to room temperature.
By dissolving liquid bismuth with 30% HNO3, needle or rod like black phosphorus
was achieved. The size of a typical crystal was 5 mm  0.1 mm  0.07 mm with
needles along the a-axis. Silicon or germanium doped BP can also be achieved by
bismuth-ﬂux method [50, 51]. It was not until very recently that BP could be prepared
under a non-toxic catalyst developed process. Lange and his colleagues reported a
low-pressure method to produce high-quality BP using a mineralizer as a reaction
promoter under non-toxic conditions. BP was prepared by the reaction of Au, Sn, red
phosphorus, and SnI4 in evacuated silica ampoules [52, 53]. The starting materials were
heated to 823, 873, or 923 K and kept at this temperature for 5–10 days. This reported
synthesis method represents a signiﬁcant improvement in achieving crystal size and
quality compared with traditional methods such as high pressure, mercury catalysis, and
bismuth-ﬂux methods, with, however, a sacriﬁce of growth time. This process was
further simpliﬁed by Nilges and Köpf [54]. In a speciﬁc case conducted by Köpf,
Sn/SnI4 was the only mineralization additive used in mineralizer-assisted short-way
transport reaction. Sizes of several millimeters can be realized with high crystal quality
and purity, making large-area preparation of single or multi-layer phosphorene
possible. A similar process was reproduced by Ye et al. at Purdue University recently.

As shown in Fig. 22.1(b), high-quality bulk BP can be synthesized from low-cost red
phosphorus as demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy and ﬁeld-effect transistors.
Another notable contribution in the ﬁeld is the work of the Hong Kong Polytechnic
University, reporting on the growth of amorphous BP thin ﬁlm with decent transport
properties by pulsed laser deposition [55]. A novel laser exfoliation technique was also
developed by Ye et al. at Purdue University which can deposit poly-crystalline ultra-
thin BP ﬁlms with designed patterns on arbitrary substrates by ultra-fast laser direct
writing [56].
22.2
Anisotropic Response of Black Phosphorus
In the unit cell of single-layer phosphorene, each phosphorus atom covalently bonds to
its three nearest neighbors, forming a warped hexagon conformation. As shown in
Fig. 22.1(a), this sp3-type bonding has introduced a distinctly anisotropic crystal
structure, resulting in two principal lattice axes, in which the x-direction perpendicular
to the pucker is an armchair axis, and the y-direction parallel to the pucker is deﬁned as
zig-zag [57]. The geometric anisotropy introduced by the pucker implies that BP would
exhibit signiﬁcant anisotropic properties, and that these unique responses would lead to
the emergence of a paradigm of ﬂatland semiconductor devices, where interesting and
unique phenomena could be explored intensively. In this section, we will review
anisotropic properties of BP, regarding its electronic, thermal, and mechanical behav-
iors, with the main focus on its electrical properties.

22.2.1
Electronic Anisotropic Behavior
The electronic structure of BP had been determined by various approaches, including
the tight-bonding method, the self-consistent pseudopotential method, and the local-
orbital method [58–60]. However, the basic discussion should start from an understand-
ing of the effective mass of BP, which represents the complex quantum mechanical
formulation for the carrier motion between collisions in a system where the dimensions
of the crystal are large compared to atomic dimensions. From a band structure
calculation, it can be seen that for both the electron and the hole, the effective mass
in the x–y plane is fairly large. The effective mass in the x-direction is the lightest, and
that in the layer-stacking z-direction is lighter than that in the in-plane y-direction due to
the van der Waals structure. An average effective mass of 0.22m0 for electrons and
0.24m0 for holes determined by (mxmymz)1/3 were achieved by the self-consistent
pseudopotential method. More detailed studies regarding various crystal orientations
have been performed recently by applying density function theory (DFT) calculations.
Speciﬁcally, for electrons, mx = 0.0826m0, my = 1.027m0, mz = 0.128m0, and for holes,
mx = 0.076m0, my = 0.648m0, mz = 0.28m0 [19, 57]. The foregoing discussion on the
effective mass of the BP carrier delineated certain important results, which allowed us to
conceive of electrons and holes as quasi-classical particles and to employ classical
particle relationships in most device analyses, and one of the most important component
of analyses is associated with carrier mobility. Mobility is obviously a central parameter
in characterizing electron and hole transport due to drifts, and it varies inversely with the
carrier effective mass – heavier carriers move more steadily in crystal. That being said
the smaller carrier effective mass of BP along the armchair direction yields higher
mobility within the 2D plane, as compared to the zig-zag axis. It is interesting to note
that the z-direction has the lowest mobility, but not the highest effective mass, which
does not strictly follow expectations from the perspective of effective mass. However,
as the smallest mobility occurs in the z-direction might be attributed to the fact that
interlayer transport is signiﬁcantly different from intralayer transport. The anisotropy is
also conﬁrmed in BP ﬁeld-effect transistors from experimental demonstrations [19].
Liu et al. performed an experiment by starting exfoliation of a 10 nm BP onto a 90 nm
SiO2-capped Si substrate [19]. Metal contacts were symmetrically deﬁned around the
crystal with 45 as the angular increment of the orientation. The schematic ﬁgure is
shown in Fig. 22.2(a). Four pairs of diametrically opposite bars as source and drain
contacts for a transistor geometry were engineered, and the transistor behavior for sets
of devices were systematically recorded. The maximum drain current at 30 V back-gate
bias and 0.5 V drain bias as a function of the orientation of the contact pair is displayed
in Fig. 22.2(b). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the angle-dependent
transport behavior of BP. The anisotropic behavior of the maximum drain current is
roughly sinusoidal, characterized by the minimum value of 85 mA/mm at 45 and
225, and the maximum value of 137 mA/mm at 135 and 315. In spite of the 45
angular resolution, the observed 50% anisotropy between the two orthogonal directions
is signiﬁcant. The same periodic trend can be found in the maximum value of the
transconductance, which could be partially related to a mobility variation in the x–y
417

plane of BP. This large mobility variation is rarely seen in other conventional layered
semiconductors, and it could be correlated to the unique pucker structure in the 2D
plane of BP.
BP research gets its renaissance following the trend of researches on device applica-
tions with TMD channel materials. Field-effect transistors have also been demonstrated
with BP channels [19–23]. The thickness of the BP crystal used as the channel material
ranges from 2 to 30 nm. Figure 22.3(a) shows a schematic image of a typical back-gated
BP transistor. Heavily doped silicon was used as the back-gate with 90 nm SiO2 on top
of that as the back-gate dielectric. Few nanometer thick BP crystals were split from bulk
ingots and are transferred onto the substrate. Source–drain contacts were lithographic-
ally deﬁned and followed by metallization and lift-off. Output and transfer characteris-
tics are shown in Figs. 22.3(b) and (c). A maximum drain current of 194 mA/mm was
achieved at a 2 V drain bias for the 1 μm channel length transistor. This is a signiﬁcant
improvement in drain current for transistors based on 2D semiconductor channel
materials, where the drain current is almost of an order of magnitude larger than the
most reported TMD channel transistors at a similar gate length. High ﬁeld-effect
mobility from several hundred up to 1000 cm2/Vs at room temperature is estimated
from maximum transconductance [20]. Both ﬁeld-effect mobility and Hall mobility
show temperature dependence behavior, as shown in Fig. 22.4. They decrease at
temperatures higher than ~100 K, and saturate at lower temperatures. It is attributed
to electron–phonon scattering a range between 100 K to 300 K and can be characterized
by the T –1/2 feature, and impurity scattering dominates in a range lower than 100 K.
One thing interesting to mention is, despite a prominent p-type conductivity described
in the previous section, n-type conductivity can also be observed in the ﬁeld effect [38].
Consistent with the positive Hall coefﬁcient with negative gate bias, a sign reversal
of the Hall coefﬁcient was observed at a high positive electrical ﬁeld (>6.6 MV/cm).

This is attributed to the narrow band-gap nature of BP, where the Fermi-level can be
tuned either near the valence band, leading to the hole conduction, or the conduction
band, leading to the electron conduction.
Many layered materials can be exfoliated from bulk down to one single atomic layer,
but only a small number of them are stable in an ambient atmosphere. The reduced
chemical stability of 2D materials is associated with the energy needed to maintain stable
bonding conﬁgurations, which is affected by electrostatics and structural buckling. Thus,
ambient stability is likely to be a big concern for BP since phosphorus atoms have free
lone pairs and valence bond angles of 102 [61]. The surface instability has been
observed in several studies regarding the isolation of BP thin layers [22, 23], but the
mechanism of surface degradation is not well understood. Researchers have suggested
that O2 saturated H2O irreversibly reacts with BP to form oxidized phosphorus species,
with a signiﬁcant cost of degraded electronic characteristics [62–64]. Certain passivation
techniques have been proposed recently, such as atomic layer deposited AlxOy [65–67],
hydrophobic polymer [68], and multi-layer h-BN [69–73]; thus the BP transistors can
sustain good electrical performance for weeks and months. Li et al. recently achieved
enhanced Hall mobility in BP at low temperatures [69]. The device is accomplished by
constructing a van der Waals heterostructure with few-layer BP sandwiched between two
h-BN ﬂakes, and being placed on the graphite back-gate. The top h-BN ﬂake not only
provides as effective passivation layer to avoid ﬂake degradation from ambient exposure
it also prevents surface scattering from neighboring adsorbates. More importantly, the
bottom h-BN allows the electrons in the graphite to screen the impurity potential at the
BP/h-BN interface, as the impurities at the interface are mainly responsible for limited
low-temperature Hall mobility of BP. High-quality h-BN-encapsulated BP has brought
arrier Hall mobility up to 6000 cm2/V s at low temperature. Shubnikov–de Haas
oscillations and quantum Hall effects are observed in BP [69–73].
Contact to 2D materials is another grand challenge in 2D electronics in general.
The demonstrated TMDs and BP transistors are Schottky-barrier transistors with sig-
niﬁcant large contact resistance due to metal/2D Schottky barriers. The contact resist-
ance on BP transistors is around 1.0–2.0 Ωmm [38], smaller than the contact resistance
in MoS2 in general, due to its narrower band-gap. Here, we discuss the anisotropic
contact resistance on BP due to its anisotropic atomic structures and electrical transport
properties. When current ﬂows from the semiconductor to the metal, it encounters the
resistances at the metal contacts. Contact resistance measurement determines the spe-
ciﬁc contact resistivity which is not the resistance of the metal-semiconductor interface
alone, but it is a practical quantity describing the total real contact [74]. Therefore, the
semiconductor/metal contact should be more fairly represented by the equivalent circuit
with the current choosing the path of least resistance, and the potential distribution
under the contact is determined by both resistors and can be written as follows [74]:

length and width, and I is the current ﬂowing into the contact. The voltage is highest
near the contact edge and drops nearly exponentially with distance. Usually, the “1/e”
distance of the voltage drop is deﬁned as the transfer length LT and can be expressed as
LT = (ρc/Rsh)1/2. In conventional Si MOSFETs, both ρc and Rsh are almost ﬁxed numbers
for implanted regions, while in BP transistors, they are modulated by gate voltage. In
the resistor network of the BP contact structure, as shown in Fig. 22.5, contact resist-
ance depends on the semiconductor/metal interface resistance ρc, as well as the sheet
resistance Rsh. More importantly, the anisotropic characteristic-induced deviation in
mobility would lead to different sheet resistances, such that the BP contact resistance
should experience anisotropic property as well. The interpretation is further supported
by the observation of anisotropic contact resistance in electric measurements. Through
studying transistor behaviors with various channel lengths, the contact resistance on BP
can be extracted from the transfer length method (TLM). Flakes with similar thicknesses
have been patterned upon the TLM structure with 3 μm, 2 μm, 1.5 μm, 1 μm, and
500 nm channel lengths, and source–drain metals are kept as Ni/Au. Contact resistance,
and corresponding ﬁeld-effect mobility at a channel length of 1 μm for each independ-
ent sets were summarized in Table 22.1. It is evident that the BP ﬂake with highest
mobility generates the lowest contact resistance, which successfully support our previ-
ous theoretical prediction about the anisotropic characteristic of BP contact resistance.
22.2.2
Thermal Anisotropic Behavior
In order to study the thermal anisotropic behavior, we need to identify the atomic
structure and crystal orientation of BP ﬁlms ﬁrst. It has been shown experimentally by
Fig. 22.5 Resistor network of BP contact structure, ρc is semiconductor/metal interface
resistance, Rsh is sheet resistance underneath the metal contact.

many groups that the photonic method could also examine the BP axes [21, 75–79]. In
fact, the polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy offers an important method to
accurately determine the crystalline orientation of thin ﬁlm BP, which is especially
useful for such a relatively small ﬂake due to the small laser spot size. In Raman
spectroscopy, the laser light interacts with molecular vibrations, phonons, or other
excitations in the system, resulting in the energy of the laser photons being shifted up
or down. The shift in energy gives sufﬁcient information about the vibrational modes in
the system, so as to examine the atomic bond structure. Previous studies of Raman
spectra have shown that there are three prominent active modes in BP, and they can be
observed at around 365, 440, and 470 cm–1, corresponding to three Ag
1, B2g, and Ag
2
vibration modes, respectively [19, 21, 77]. The out-of-plane Ag
1 mode occurs due to
opposing vibrations of top and bottom phosphorus atoms with respect to each other. The
B2g mode that describes the bond movement along the in-plane zig-zag direction is
associated with the Ag
2 mode, which has the dominate component along the in-plane
armchair vibration, as depicted in Fig. 22.6(a) [75]. To observe the polarized Raman
scattering, a linear polarizer is placed at the spectrometer entrance. With the detection
polarization perpendicular (VH conﬁguration) or parallel (VV conﬁguration) to the
incoming laser polarization, the optical phonon modes of different symmetries can be
selected or eliminated when lattice principal axes are aligned with the laser polarization.
Speciﬁcally in BP, the Ag modes and the B2g mode can be ﬁltered out in VH and VV
conﬁgurations, respectively, when either the armchair or zig-zag axis is aligned with the
laser polarization [75, 76]. An experimental demonstration of a polarization-resolved
Raman spectrum was conducted by Luo et al. [75], shown in Fig. 22.6(b). The solid
lines represent the two principal axes under the VV conﬁguration, where the B2g mode
is eliminated. Meanwhile, VH conﬁgurations of the zig-zag and the armchair axis are
elucidated in dashed lines with a single peak located at the B2g mode. To further
distinguish the two principal axes, we looked into the Ag
2/Ag
1 Raman intensity ratio
in the VV conﬁguration. The armchair-oriented atomic vibrations of Ag
2 phonons lead
to maximized Ag
2 Raman intensity when laser polarization is along the armchair
direction, while the Ag
1 Raman intensity remains unchanged because the Ag
1 phonon
vibrations are out-of-plane. Therefore, the Ag
2/Ag
1 intensity ratio becomes larger (~2)
with armchair-polarized laser excitation, and smaller (~1) with zig-zag-polarized laser
excitation, which serves as Raman signatures of armchair and zig-zag lattice axes. We
should notice that, it is insufﬁcient to claim BP Raman spectroscopy without under-
standing the angular-dependent Raman spectrum. In this case, the peak positions of
modes do not change as the excitation light polarization varies with ﬂake rotation;
however, the relative intensities of these three peaks do change signiﬁcantly with the
polarization direction. Mathematical calculation of Raman modes has been introduced
in the ﬁrst place to help us understand angular-dependent polarization-resolved Raman
measurement [75].
Even though the electronic and photonic anisotropic properties of BP have been
widely reported, thermal transport of BP is still in its infancy. Recently, the thermoelec-
tric power of bulk BP has been investigated, indicating BP as an efﬁcient thermoelectric
material with a relatively high temperature of 380 K [80]. First-principles calculations

showed that the existence of anisotropy was related to asymmetric phonon dispersion,
whereas the intrinsic phonon scattering rates were found to be similar along the
armchair and zig-zag directions. Surface scattering in the phosphorene thin ﬁlms was
shown to strongly suppress the contribution of long-mean-free-path acoustic phonons.
Moreover, calculations also raised interest in BP in thermoelectric applications,
claiming that because of the anisotropic lattice structure, the armchair direction of BP
possesses high electrical conductivity but low lattice thermal conductivity. On the other
hand, the zig-zag direction might not be a favorite choice for electronic transport of BP
due to relatively small carrier mobility; instead, it accelerated thermal transport in the
channel [81–84]. Experimental demonstration of anisotropic in-plane thermal conduct-
ivity of suspended BP measured by micro-Raman spectroscopy was reported recently
by Luo et al. at Purdue University [75]. The candidate BP ﬂakes were ﬁrstly transferred
onto 3 μm wide slits fabricated on 200 nm thick free-standing SiN membranes.
Meanwhile, two slits were patterned to be mutually perpendicular to form a “T” shape,
so as to investigate separately the armchair and zig-zag thermal transport on the same
ﬂake. It should be emphasized that the rectangular geometry along with a nearly
one-dimensional laser heater source in the center guarantees that the heat conduction
in the BP sample was most sensitive to the thermal conductivity perpendicular to the
slit. Raman thermometer calibration was ﬁrst conducted on a 9.5 nm-thick BP sample,

with laser temperature rises from a room temperature of 24 up to 72 C. As shown in
Fig. 22.7(a), the zig-zag-polarized excitation yielded temperature coefﬁcients of larger
absolute values, which might be caused by anisotropic thermal expansion during the
laser heating process. In the Raman spectroscopy, the Ag
2 mode was found to be the
most sensitive to temperature changing among a total of three modes, as well as
showing the highest Raman intensity. Therefore, Ag
2 mode has been selected and
plotted in Fig. 22.7(b) to evaluate anisotropic thermal expansion of BP, indicating a
signiﬁcant anisotropic thermometer along these two principle axes. Micro-Raman
thermal conductivity experiments were performed at room temperature to investigate
detailed anisotropic in-plane anisotropic behavior. To best achieve the desired one-
dimensional heat transfer, rectangular aperture was placed in front of the objective
lens to produce a laser focal line instead of a circular spot. In the direction where the
aperture cut the laser beam, the partially ﬁlled objective lens aperture produced a
larger width at the focal point, yielding a stretched line-shaped focal spot.
Figure 22.8(a) plots the Raman-measured temperature rise θRaman versus the
absorbed laser power PA for the suspended 9.5 nm thick BP ﬁlm in which the data
show a linear correlation similar to other micro-Raman experiments. The absorbed
laser power was determined by PA = AP = (1 – R – T)P, where P is the incident laser
power, A is the absorptivity, R is the reﬂectivity, and T is the transmissivity. The
reﬂectivity of BP ﬁlms was measured using a beam splitter in the incident laser path,
which deviated from the reﬂected light to a separate path where its intensity was
measured; by comparing the reﬂected light intensity of the BP ﬁlms and a silver-
coated mirror as a reference, the reﬂectivity of BP ﬁlms could be calculated. The
transmissivity of the BP ﬁlms was measured under the slit, by dividing the transmit-
ted laser intensity on the BP-covered slit by that at the adjacent empty slit. Note that

A, R, and T are all anisotropic quantities due to anisotropic optical conductivity, and the
measured absorptivity of the 9.5 nm-thick suspended ﬁlm (~12.0% for armchair
polarization and ~2.9% for zig-zag polarization) agrees well with the theoretical
predictions. Due to the much higher absorption of armchair-polarized light in BP ﬁlms,
all the thermal conductivity measurements were carried out with an armchair-polarized
laser beam in order to reduce the uncertainty of PA. The measured anisotropic in-plane
thermal conductivity values of BP are summarized in Fig. 22.8(b). As expected, the BP
has demonstrated signiﬁcant anisotropic thermal transport behavior in the channel,
where armchair and zig-zag thermal conductivities are ~20 and ~40 W m–1 K–1 for
BP ﬁlms thicker than 15 nm, respectively. In addition, how thermal conductivity varies
with ﬂake thickness is also included in the study and is shown in Fig. 22.8(c). The

thermal conductivity anisotropic ratio kzig-zag/karmchair, which drops from ~2 to ~1.5 as
BP thickness decreases to less than 10 nm.
Large anisotropy in-plane thermal conductivity of BP nanoribbons at temperatures
higher than 100 K was experimentally observed very recently [85]. It was evident that
zig-zag and armchair had similar thermal conductivity at lower temperatures between
30 and 100 K. However, zig-zag nanoribbon had a higher κ than armchair nanoribbon,
by as much as ~7 W m–1 K–1 at temperatures above ~100 K. Furthermore, the ratio of κ
along zig-zag and armchair directions, increased with temperature, reaching up to ~2 at
~300 K. The increasing anisotropy ratio was attributed to the increased contribution
from phonon–phonon scattering, which became the dominating scattering mechanism at
high temperatures. At a constant temperature of 300 K, the thermal conductivity
decreased as the nanoribbon thickness was reduced from ~300 nm to ~50 nm, but the
anisotropy ratio stayed around 2 within the thickness range. Similar results were also
obtained on 138–552 nm thick BP by the Northwestern group using conventional time-
domain thermos-reﬂectance and the beam-offset method [86].
22.2.3
Mechanical Anisotropic Behavior
Here, we focus on another property of BP: its unique puckered structure allows BP
to exhibit substantial anisotropy in the mechanical properties with respect to strains
[87–95]. In this study, Du et al. from Purdue University employed Raman spectroscopy
to experimentally demonstrate the strong anisotropic mechanical properties in BP [96].
The geometric anisotropy introduced by the pucker implies that BP would exhibit
signiﬁcant anisotropic lattice vibrations in response to uniaxial strain along armchair or
zig-zag directions, which can be observed directly from Raman spectroscopy. Previous
studies of Raman spectra have shown that there are three prominent active modes in BP.
The cross-plane Ag
1 mode occurs due to opposing vibrations of top and bottom phos-
phorus atoms with respect to each other. The B2g mode describes the bond movement
along the in-plane zig-zag direction. The Ag
2 mode has a dominate component along the
in-plane armchair direction. To start our experiment, few-layer BP was exfoliated from the
bulk crystal by the standard scotch tape method and transferred to a conducting Si
substrate with a 300 nm SiO2 capping layer. Polarized Raman spectroscopy was utilized
to determine the ﬂake orientation. With the detection polarization parallel to the incident
laser polarization, the active phonon mode of B2g is not detected due to matrix cancellation
when the two principle lattice axes are aligned with the laser polarization. The Ag
2/Ag
1
Raman intensity ratio can further be used to distinguish the speciﬁc armchair or zig-zag
axis. The armchair-oriented Ag
2 mode intensity is maximized and is about two times
higher than the intensity of the Ag
1 mode when the laser polarization is along the armchair
direction. The intensity of Ag
2 is comparable to Ag
1 when the laser is aligned along the zig-
zag direction. The candidate BP ﬂakes were all pre-characterized by the polarized Raman
system. A representative 7.3 nm-thick BP ﬂake was used in this study. The armchair and
zig-zag lattice axes were determined by the Ag
2/Ag
1 intensity ratio.
We ﬁrst investigate the evolution of the Raman spectra of BP with uniaxial tensile
and compressive strains, summarized in Fig. 22.9(a). The laser polarization is

aligned along the zig-zag axis of BP ﬂake, and the strain direction is along armchair
direction based on our apparatus set-up [96]. In our work, we used Lorentzian functions
to ﬁt the Raman spectra and obtained the peak frequency of each mode at different
strains. For unstrained BP, consistent with previous reports [19, 21, 75], we observe the
cross-plane vibration mode of Ag
1 at ~362 cm–1, and in-plane vibration modes of B2g
and Ag
2 at ~439 cm–1 and ~467 cm–1, respectively. The Ag
1 and B2g modes show the
same linear trend of Raman frequency shift with respect to the applied strain, while the
rate of frequency shift is different in these two modes. Both Ag
1 and B2g modes
experience a red-shift when BP is under tensile strain along the armchair direction,
with a slope of 1.37 cm–1 %–1 and 1.07 cm–1 %–1, respectively. On the other hand, Ag
1
and B2g have a blue-shift at a rate of 1.34 cm–1 %–1 and 0.70 cm–1 %–1 under uniaxial
compressive strain, as shown in Figs. 22.9(b) and (c). It is worth mentioning that we
did not observe a measurable Raman shift in the Ag
2 mode with various armchair
strains, and we believe this can be attributed to the fact that the BP structure is
anisotropic and is much softer along the armchair direction, compared to the zig-zag
direction. The strain sensitivity of BP from the Raman peak positions is greater than
that of molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2), but slightly smaller than those of carbon

nanotubes and graphene [97, 98]. The error bars in the ﬁgures are extracted from the
Lorentzian peak ﬁttings, which are signiﬁcantly smaller than the strain-induced
frequency shift. For the applied strain less than 0.2%, the Raman peak position
remains the same at each strain level after multiple loading and unloading cycles,
indicating our experiments are highly reliable. In addition, the absence of discrete
jumps of any of the three Raman modes under monotonically varied strains assures
that the BP ﬂake does not slip against the substrate during strain experiments.
To apply strain along the zig-zag direction, the BP sample substrate was rotated by
90, and the polarized Raman system was introduced again to verify the BP orientation.
The corresponding Raman spectra of zig-zag strained BP are presented in Fig. 22.10(a).
Figure 22.10(b) illustrates the Ag
1 peak position as a function of tensile and compres-
sive zig-zag strain. The dominate Ag
1 mode peak overlaps with another peak appearing
as a weak shoulder. In this case, we ﬁtted the data by two Lorentzian functions and
treated the main peak as the peak for the Ag
1 mode. This phenomenon only happens
along the armchair lattice of BP ﬂakes, and it has been observed in our previous studies
as well [75]. The Ag
1 mode shows monotonic behavior for the full range of zig-zag
strain with a slope of 0.56 cm–1 %–1 under tensile strain and 1.07 cm–1 %–1 under

compressive strain. The Ag
2 mode and B2g mode also show monotonic behavior for the
full range of zig-zag strain with a slope of 1.98 cm–1 %–1 and 4.69 cm–1 %–1 under
tensile strain, 2.73 cm–1 %–1 and 5.46 cm–1 %–1 under compressive strain. In general, the
Raman peak shifts are a factor of 5–7 more sensitive under zig-zag strains compared to
those under armchair strains. This strong anisotropic mechanical property can be
ascribed simply to the softer bonds in armchair direction in BP ﬁlms.
22.3
Conclusion
We have presented here an overview of BP synthesis and its anisotropic property
studies. Progress in BP science and technology have been built upon the success
in bulk crystal synthesis and layer exfoliation. It is demonstrated that both high
pressure and catalyst involved procedures are reliable; however, there still exists
an urgency to develop large-area wafer-scale BP thin ﬁlm synthesis to satisfy
future technology development. Moreover, in this chapter, we have carefully reviewed
anisotropic properties of BP with the focus on its electrical properties. The
anisotropic characteristics of BP, with respect to its electronic, thermal, and mechanic
behaviors, have distinguished BP as a unique 2D material among other layer structured
crystals.

Optical Properties and Optoelectronic
Applications of Black Phosphorus

23.1
Introduction
The recent isolation of black phosphorus (a layered material composed of phosphorus
atoms held together by strong in-plane bonds forming layers that interact between them
through weak van der Waals forces) has unleashed the interest of the community
working on 2D materials because of its interesting and attractive electronic properties
including: narrow intrinsic gap, ambipolar ﬁeld effect, and high carrier mobility [1–11].
The outstanding electrical properties of black phosphorus, discussed in detail in the
previous chapter, has already motivated the fabrication of black phosphorus-based
devices such as ﬁeld-effect transistors [1, 3, 4, 12–21], inverter ampliﬁers [22]. Apart
from its electrical properties, black phosphorus also displays remarkable optical
properties [23–27], unmatched by any other 2D materials that have been isolated to
date, further motivating the recent surge of works on this novel material.
This chapter reviews the main optical properties of black phosphorus, focusing on its
thickness-dependent band gap and its unusual in-plane anisotropy. Then, recent works
demonstrating black phosphorus optoelectronic devices (phototransistors, high-speed
photodetectors and solar) are summarized. Finally, the future perspectives of black
phosphorus’ application in optoelectronic are discussed.
23.2
Optical Properties
In this section, the main optical properties of black phosphorus will be reviewed,
stressing the thickness dependence of the band gap and the characteristic anisotropic
optical properties of black phosphorus.
23.2.1
Thickness-Dependent Band Gap
In spite of its morphological similarity to graphene, black phosphorus differs consider-
ably from graphene in its electronic properties. While graphene is a zero-gap semicon-
ductor, black phosphorus presents a sizeable gap which makes it attractive for
optoelectronic applications [28–30]. Moreover, similarly to other 2D semiconducting
materials, the band-gap value strongly depends on the number of layers due to the
quantum conﬁnement effect in the out-of-plane direction [31–33]. In order to illustrate

this effect, Fig. 23.1(a) compares the band structures of monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer
black phosphorus obtained through ab initio calculations with the GW approximations
[34]. A general feature of all the calculated band structures is that the band gap remains
direct at the Γ point of the Brillouin zone. In semiconducting transition, metal dichal-
cogenides, on the other hand, the gap is at the K point and it is only direct for single-
layers (becoming and an indirect gap semiconductor for multilayer samples) [31, 32].
Another feature, clearly visible in Fig. 23.1(a), is the strong dependence on the
number of layers (much stronger than that reported for other 2D semiconductor
materials). Figure 23.1(b) summarizes the thickness dependence of the black phos-
phorus band-gap value. The ﬁgure compares the values calculated through different ab
initio methods [3, 26, 35], and experimental values measured by photoluminescence
[2, 24, 36], infrared spectroscopy [21], and scanning tunneling spectroscopy [37, 38]
techniques. Although the magnitude of the theoretical band-gap value strongly depends
on the approximation employed to calculate the band structure, in all of the cases there
is a marked thickness dependence: from a large gap (close to 2 eV) for a single-layer
that monotonically decreases to a narrow band-gap value (about 0.3 eV) for bulk black
phosphorus. This thickness-dependent band gap, due to quantum conﬁnement of the
charge carriers in the out-of-plane direction, is much stronger that that observed in other
2D semiconductor materials [31, 32] and it provides a remarkable way of tuning the
optical and electrical properties of black phosphorus. Therefore, one can select the
thickness of black phosphorus material to design a nanodevice with a band-gap value
that is optimized for a certain application.
It is important to highlight that, due to the quantum conﬁnement effect, the black
phosphorus band-gap value spans over a wide energy range (0.3 eV to 2.0 eV) that was
not covered by any of the other 2D materials isolated to date. This range can be
increased even further by alloying black phosphorus with arsenic (b-AsxP1–x) covering
the range between 0.15 eV and 0.30 eV, as recently reported by Liu et al. [40].
Figure 23.2 compares the band-gap values spanned by black phosphorus and black
arsenic-phosphorus with other 2D materials. According to Fig. 23.2, graphene can cover

the range from 0 eV to 0.2 eV. In fact, although pristine graphene is a zero-gap
semiconductor, one can open a band gap in graphene using different methods such as
patterning graphene into nanoribbon shape or by applying a perpendicular electric ﬁeld
to bilayer graphene [41–43]. Other isolated 2D materials are semiconductors; they
present an intrinsic band gap. Among these materials transition metal dichalcogenides
are the most studied so far and they present a band gap in the range of 1.0–2.0 eV
[44, 45]. As illustrated in Fig. 23.2, each material covers a relatively wide range of band
gaps as the gap depends on the thickness of the material. The band gap can be tuned
further by applying strain or by alloying with other materials (e.g. MoS2xSex presents a
band-gap value in between those of MoS2 and MoSe2).
Interestingly, there is a big empty gap between the values covered by graphene and
those covered by other 2D materials. Black phosphorus bridges that gap between
graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, and most importantly a lot of applica-
tions require semiconductor materials with a band-gap value in that range of energies
Fig. 23.2 Comparison of the band-gap values for different 2D semiconductor materials.
The band-gap values for conventional semiconductors have been included also for comparison.
The horizontal bars spanning a range of band-gap values indicate that the band gap can be
tuned over that range by changing the number of layers, straining or alloying. In conventional
semiconductors, the bar indicates that the band gap can be continuously tuned by alloying the
semiconductors (e.g. Si1–xGex or In1–xGaxAs). The range of band-gap values required for certain
applications has been highlighted in the bottom part of the ﬁgure to illustrate the potential
applications of the different semiconductors. (Reproduced with permission from [39]. Copyright

(that have remained elusive so far). For example, although photovoltaic energy harvest-
ing and photocatalysis applications are optimized for semiconductors with a 1.2–1.6 eV
band gap [46], other applications such as ﬁber optic telecommunications [47], thermal
imaging, and thermoelectric power generation require semiconductors with band-gap
values in the range of 0.3 eV and 1.0 eV, and are thus out of reach of the two-
dimensional semiconductors isolated to date.
Figure 23.2 also displays the band-gap values for conventional semiconductors to
facilitate a direct comparison with 2D semiconductors. The horizontal bars spanning a
range of band-gap values indicate that the band gap can be continuously tuned by
alloying different semiconducting materials (e.g. Si1–xGex or In1–xGaxAs). By taking a
look at conventional semiconductors, black phosphorus has the potential to substitute
and/or complement Pb-chalcogenides, In1–xGaxAs, In1–xGaxSb and Si1–xGex semicon-
ductors, with the difference being that atomically thin black phosphorus is very
transparent and ﬂexible.
23.2.2
Anisotropic Optical Properties
Although, like graphite, black phosphorus is a single elemental material with a layered
honeycomb lattice structure, each layer of phosphorus is puckered along the armchair
directions due to sp3 hybridization. This broken crystalline symmetry leads to an
anisotropic band structure, which has been theoretically studied as early as 1950s
[28, 48] and reviewed by Morita in 1980s [30]. As a consequence of the anisotropic
band structure, black phosphorus has high anisotropy in its electrical, thermal, mechan-
ical, and optical properties which assume high variation between the two in-plane
crystallographic directions along the armchair (x-axis) and zig-zag (y-axis) lattice axes.
As the ﬁrst three anisotropic properties have been discussed in other chapters, here we
focus on black phosphorus anisotropic optical properties, including optical absorption
and photoluminescence.
In experiments, the crystalline orientation of black phosphorus can be determined
with polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy by comparing the relative intensity of
different modes. Because the A2
g and B2g modes in the Raman spectrum originate from
the in-plane vibrational mode along the armchair and zig-zag axes, respectively, their
intensity varies sinusoidally with the linear polarization of the normally incident
excitation light: the A2
g mode intensity reaches maximum when the light polarization
is aligned with the armchair axis [49, 50, 24].
23.2.3
Linear Dichroism
Linear dichroism is the difference in optical absorption for linearly polarized light with
the polarization direction aligned to different crystallographic axes in an anisotropic
material. Normally, for light incident to the layer plane of black phosphorus, the
dichroism is the different absorption for light polarized along the zig-zag or armchair
axes. The frequency-dependent dielectric function of black phosphorus was calculated
based, historically, on the interband transition matrix for bulk black phosphorus by

Morita [30] and more recently for few-layer black phosphorus by Low et al. [51] and
Qiao et al. [35]. The results indicate that in line with the calculated band structure, the
imaginary part of the complex dielectric function and correspondingly the absorption
coefﬁcient is highly different for light polarized along the armchair (x-polarized) and
zig-zag (y-polarized) directions, and therefore reveals large linear dichroism in black
phosphorus. Particularly, because of the forbidden dipole transition along directions
other than the Γ–Z direction in the k-space, x-polarized light shows a peak near the
absorption threshold that is absent for the y-polarized light.
The predicted linear dichroism property of black phosphorus has been measured and
conﬁrmed in cleaved bulk samples. In few-layer black phosphorus that was exfoliated
from bulk crystal, the infrared spectroscopy method was ﬁrst measured by Xia et al. to
determine anisotropy absorption [21]. The results (Fig. 23.4) showed a cos2(θ) depend-
ence of the extinction spectrum near the absorption threshold around a wavelength of 4.17
μm (wavenumber 2400 cm–1). Consistent with the result from bulk samples, an absorption
peak can be observed for x-polarized light but not for y-polarized light at a wavenumber of
2700 cm–1, where a maximal contrast ratio of 6.6 between the extinction coefﬁcients
(23.2% and 3.5%, respectively) for the two orthogonal polarization directions was meas-
ured. Xia et al. also measured the anisotropy of DC conductivity in their samples and
compared with optical absorption (i.e. AC conductivity); the two properties show the same
angular dependence with respect to the lattice axes. Similar measurements of the linear
dichroism were carried out by several other groups in optical spectrum spanning from
infrared to visible bands and the results show the anisotropy is also strongly dependent on
the optical wavelength, in agreement with band theory [52]. The linear dichroism gets
even stronger in monolayer black phosphorus due to the strong quantum conﬁnement and
very distinct energy dispersion for carriers along different lattice axes [24, 53].
The high dichroism in black phosphorus thin ﬁlms has important implications
for their optoelectronic applications. For photodetection, to optimize the detection

the A2g and B2g modes depends sinusoidally on the angle between excitation light polarization
and the armchair direction. (Adapted with permission from [50]. Copyright 2014 American

efﬁciency, it is important to align the input light polarization in the armchair direction to
maximize absorption.This was conﬁrmed in the results by Yuan et al. [52], showing that
the photoresponsivity at certain wavelengths can vary by a factor of 4 when the light
polarization is rotated by 90. The high linear dichroism of few-layer black phosphorus
can also possibly be utilized to implement an optical polarizer using a ﬁber or wave-
guide integrated conﬁguration similar to the graphene-based polarizer [54], while the
difference is that the polarizing effect of graphene is not due to dichroism but the
different dispersion of TE and TM modes. More interestingly, since dichroism is
strongest near the absorption threshold, which is tunable in black phosphorus by
modifying the Fermi level through electrostatic gating, it is thus possible to control
electrical optical polarization in black phosphorus integrated devices.
23.2.4
Linearly Polarized Photoluminescence (PL)
The asymmetric lattice structure also leads to anisotropic photoluminescence in black
phosphorus, which is found to be strong because of the direct band gap of black
phosphorus and because it mainly originates from the excitonic states. Photolumines-
cence (PL) measurement is a powerful tool to probe the band structure and excitonic
states in semiconductor materials. It has been used to study monolayer and few-layer
black phosphorus with varying thicknesses [2, 50] as shown in Figs. 23.5(a) and (b).
The measured energy spectrum of the emitted photons provides a lower bound estimate
of the band gap of black phosphorus, which corroborates the predicted value of the band
gap that is much larger in few-layer than in bulk black phosphorus.
The anisotropy in black phosphorus’ photoluminescence was ﬁrst revealed by Wang
et al. [24] in monolayer black phosphorus using a polarization resolved photolumi-
nescence measurement (Figs. 23.5(c) and (d)). Their results show that the PL intensity
is highly dependent on the polarization of excitation light and the emitted light is also
polarized highly linearly; the strongest photoluminescence intensity was measured
when both the polarization of the excitation light and the orientation of the polarizer
before the detector are aligned with the armchair direction (x-axis). The dependence of

the excitation light can be attributed to the linear dichroism of black phosphorus
discussed above, such that armchair direction polarized light is more strongly
absorbed, leading to more efﬁciently excitation. Remarkably, regardless of the excita-
tion polarization, the photoluminescent emission is highly polarized with a very high
extinction ratio: the intensity of the y-polarized emission is less than 3% that of the x-
polarized emission. The strongly polarized photoluminescent emission is consistent
with the anisotropic exciton states due to the asymmetric lattice. First-principles
calculation shows that the electron wave function of the exciton states extends along
the armchair direction, in which the photoexcited carriers are more mobile and less
bounded than in the zig-zag direction. This anisotropic exciton emission makes black
phosphorous unique compared to other two-dimensional materials. Its study can
provide important insights into carrier dynamics and band structures. Unlike transition
metal dichalcogenides, where the thickness is varied, the band gap in monolayer to
multilayer black phosphorus remains direct at the Γ point with varying band-gap sizes.
Thus, the anisotropic excitonic photoluminescence in black phosphorus with different
numbers of layers should have common features but also be tunable by the layer
number. It is also possible to electrically tune the excitonic states by electrostatic
gating as has been achieved in transition metal dichalcogenides monolayers
and junctions [55, 56]. Efﬁcient photoluminescence is often a prerequisite for

Optoelectronic Devices
In this section, the recent advances in applying black phosphorus in optoelectronic
devices will be reviewed. Special focus will be paid to photodetectors and solar cells
because of their potential impact on society and industry.
23.3.1
Phototransistors
The lack of an intrinsic band gap in graphene, which strongly reduces its applicability in
optoelectronic devices, motivated the research on other 2D materials with an intrinsic
band gap [44]. Although silicene, a 2D layer of silicon atoms [57], can be considered as
a semiconducting counterpart of graphene, its environmental instability hampers its
applicability and therefore further studies. Among the studied 2D semiconductors, the
transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show promising properties for optoelectro-
nic applications but they typically suffer from slow photoresponse, and they are only
suited for applications in part of the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum
(because of the large band gap of Mo- and W-based compounds) [44, 58–62]. Black
phosphorus owning a small direct band gap together with a fast photoresponse is a
promising alternative to other 2D semiconductor materials in photodetection [63].
After the ﬁrst works demonstrating the isolation of black phosphorus, simple
photodetector devices (based in the phototransistor geometry) were rapidly reported
[52, 64–67]. The simplest phototransistor device is based on a ﬁeld-effect transistor with
a back-gate electrode in which the semiconducting channel can be directly illuminated
(see Fig. 23.6(a)). Upon illumination with photons with energy higher than the band-
gap, electron–hole pairs are generated. When a voltage bias is applied across the device,
the electron–hole pairs can be separated, thus increasing the current ﬂowing through the
device. Therefore, the light can be detected by the difference between the current
ﬂowing through the device in the dark state and upon illumination. This would be the
simplest scenario where the photocurrent generation is only due to photoconductance
but other photocurrent generation mechanisms (photogating, photovoltaic, photother-
moelectric, or photobolometric) might also play a relevant role on black phosphorus
photodetectors (see [63] for further discussions about the differences between the
different photocurrent generation mechanisms).
Research on black phosphorus phototodetectors has been extensive since the ﬁrst works
isolating and characterizing black phosphorus nanosheets. Phototransistors based on ultra-
thin (3 to 8 nm thick) black phosphorus have been fabricated on SiO2/Si substrates [4].
In the dark state, black phosphorus phototransistors display ambipolar transport with hole
mobilities of the order of 100 cm2 V–1 s–1 and an ON/OFF ratio >1  103. Figure 23.6(e)
shows an example of photodetection in one of these ultra-thin black phosphorus phototran-
sistor devices with 940 nm, 640 nm, and 532 nm illumination wavelengths.

The phototransistor can detect excitation wavelengths up to 940 nm, demonstrating that
black phosphorus-based devices can be operated in the near-infrared (NIR) part of the
spectrum, unlike photodetectors based on other layered materials that are usually operated
in the visible or ultra-violet region due to their larger band gap. The responsivity of these
devices can reach 4.8 mA W–1, and the rise and fall times are 1 and 4 ms, respectively.
In the work by Hong et al., a deeper insight into the photocurrent generation mechan-
isms in black phosphorus phototransistors was achieved by scanning photocurrent micro-
scopy (SPCM) on a 8 nm thick black phosphorus transistor (see Figs. 23.6(c) and (f))
[67]. The authors found that both the photovoltaic effect (due to the presence of Schottky
barriers at the metal/semiconductor interfaces) and the photothermoelectric effect can
contribute to photocurrent generation. In the OFF state, the authors found that the
photocurrent generation is dominated by the electron–hole separation induced by the
electric ﬁeld at the Schottky barriers. In the ON state, the contact resistance is drastically
reduced (the Schottky barrier decreases and thus the photovoltaic effect weakens),
allowing the photothermoelectric effect to contribute to the photocurrent (in good agree-
ment with the analysis by Low et al. on doped black phosphorus phototransistors [65]).
Moreover Hong et al. also studied the role of the strong in-plane anisotropy of black
phosphorus in photocurrent generation. When the incident light is linearly polarized along
the armchair direction, the photocurrent is enhanced; conversely, when aligning the
polarization with the zig-zag direction the photocurrent is reduced. The polarization-
dependent photocurrent is a direct result of the strongly asymmetric band structure of few-
layer black phosphorus, highlighting the difference from other 2D semiconductors, such
as transition metal dichalcogenides, which are rather isotropic within the plane.

Table 23.1 summarizes the ﬁgures-of-merit reported for different black phosphorus
phototransistors and Fig. 23.7 visually compares the photoresponse and the response
time measured for photodetectors based on graphene (data extracted from [68–72]),
transition metal dichalcogenides (data extracted from [58, 60–62, 73–83]), and black
phosphorus (data from [4, 52, 64, 66, 84]). While graphene detectors typically display a
fast but rather weak photoresponse, transition metal dichalcogenides can have photo-
response values as high as 103 A/W (104 times larger than that of pristine graphene-based
photodetectors) but they typically suffer from very low response time, hampering their
use in applications such as video-rate imaging. The ﬁrst black phosphorus photodetec-
tors (mainly based on phototransistor geometry) showed photoresponse times faster than
most transition metal dichalcogenide-based photodetectors [4, 52, 64, 66]. Note that the

RC time of the experimental setup (~1 ms) is very close to the time response values
reported for these early black phosphorus photodetectors and thus it is very probable that
these values are limited by the experimental setup and that they should be considered as
lower bounds for the black phosphorus time response. In fact, more sophisticated device
engineering (integrating a black phosphorus detector on a silicon photonic waveguide to
overcome the RC time limitation in the photodetection setup) allowed for a time response
of a black phosphorus photodetector < 1 ns to be demonstrated [84]. The next section
gives further details on high-speed black phosphorus photodetectors.
23.3.2
High Speed Photodetectors
The narrow and direct band gap of black phosphorus, along with its excellent transport
performance, makes it particularly promising for the photodetection of infrared light,
especially for optical communication, which predominantly uses the near-infrared band
in ﬁber optics and silicon photonics. Compared with germanium and compound semi-
conductors such as indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), black phosphorus boasts the
potential of low-cost growth and epitaxy-free integration with silicon photonics. To
satisfy the bandwidth requirement of practical optical communication, however, the
photoresponse speed of black phosphorus photodetectors needs to be dramatically
improved to rival the state-of-the-art germanium photodetectors that can be monolithi-
cally integrated into silicon photonics, and have reached a speed beyond 40 GHz
[85, 86]. Therefore, to fulﬁll the potential of black phosphorus photodetectors in
Fig. 23.8 Waveguide integrated black phosphorus photodetector in near-infrared light. Low dark
current and high operation speed at 3 Gbits/sec are demonstrated.

optoelectronics, it is imperative to improve the response speed, together with the
responsivity and noise performance.
The ﬁrst GHz black phosphorus photodetector was demonstrated by Youngblood
et al. [84] by integration with a silicon photonic waveguide. In their device, 10 to
100 nm thick black phosphorus thin ﬁlm was exfoliated and transferred onto a single
mode waveguide with source and drain contacts. To investigate the photocurrent
generation mechanism and to optimize device performance, a graphene gate is also
fabricated on top of the black phosphorus to electrostatically tune the Fermi level. The
waveguide integrated conﬁguration is more advantageous than normal incident devices
in that the absorption length is determined by the width rather than the thickness of the
black phosphorus, and thus can be long enough to obtain nearly 100% absorption. In
contrast, for normal incident light, on average each layer of black phosphorus absorbs
less than 0.4% of light, with a factor of 8 less than graphene. In the device by Young-
blood et al., the black phosphorus channel is 6.5 μm wide, contributing 17.5% of the
total absorption of light in the waveguide. By measuring the photoresponsivity while
changing the applied gate voltage, it was found that the responsivity is maximized when
the black phosphorus channel is gated to be in the off-state with low carrier concen-
tration. More interestingly, when the black phosphorus channel is gated to be more n-
type doped, the sign of the photocurrent changes from positive to negative with a much
lower responsivity, indicating that the photocurrent generation mechanism has changed.
The generation of positive photocurrent when the black phosphorus channel has low
carrier concentration is attributed to the photovoltaic effect, while the negative photo-
current in the high carrier concentration regime is attributed to the bolometric effect.
The maximal responsivity obtained in devices using 11.5 nm thick black phosphorus is
135 mA/W under 0.4 V bias, and reaches more than 650 mA/W in 100 nm thick
phosphorus under 2.0 V bias. As stated, the responsivity varies with the gate voltage
and the photocurrent mechanism changes from photovoltaic to bolometric, but the
response speed is also strongly dependent on the generation mechanism. Because the
bolometric effect stems from optical heating of the waveguide, the thermal time
constant of the device limits the response speed, which was found to be less than
200 kHz. In stark contrast, in the photovoltaic regime, the response speed is measured to
approach 3 GHz. The authors further demonstrated digital communication at a date rate
of 3 Gbits/s with an open eye diagram. Therefore, with a high responsivity, high
response speed, and low dark current, the low doping regime should be the optimal
condition to operate the black phosphorus photodetector.
The response speed of a photodetector is intrinsically limited by the carrier recom-
bination time τr in the photosensitive material and the transit time τt for the photo-
carriers to travel out of the detection region, and externally by the RC time constant of
the whole device τRC in which the total capacitance and resistance of the contacting
leads and pads have to be accounted for. While measurement of the carrier recombin-
ation kinetics has not been reported, it can be expected from the 2D nature and high
trap state density in black phosphorus that the recombination rate is high and the
lifetime of carriers is very short. For reference, the recombination lifetime of carriers in
graphene is tens of picoseconds. Therefore, the response speed of a black phosphorus
446

www.ebook3000.com

photodetector is unlikely to be limited by the carrier recombination rate but more by
the transit time and RC time constant. The photodetectors as reviewed in this section all
use a lateral conﬁguration in which the carriers have to travel in the plane of black
phosphorus. For the generated photocarriers to be extracted by the source and drain
contacts, they must travel across the BP channel of width L. This channel transit time in
the drift-diffusion regime is given by τt = (L/2)2/μVb, where μ is the carrier mobility
and Vb is the bias voltage. For example, assuming L = 1 μm, typical carrier (mostly
holes) mobility of μ = 100 cm2/Vs and bias voltage Vb = 1 V, τt will be 0.1 ns. Such a
transport time will limit the response speed of the BP photodetector to <10 GHz. In the
waveguide integrated photodetector reported by Youngblood et al. [84], the channel
length is 1 μm but the carrier mobility is only ~10 cm2/Vs, limiting τt to be >0.6 ns;
therefore, the reported 3 GHz bandwidth is indeed limited by the transit time. Further-
more, in order to achieve high photodetection quantum efﬁciency, it is ideal to have τt
shorter than the carrier recombination time to reduce loss of photocarriers. The
recombination rate in BP has not been reported but can be expected to be high given
the narrow, direct gap of BP. Therefore, to further improve the performance of BP
photodetectors, in terms of internal quantum efﬁciency and response speed, it is critical
to reduce the transport time τt.
While increasing mobility μ is important, the channel length L plays a more important
role in τt because of the quadratic dependence. However, in a laterally conﬁgured
device, reducing τt simply by decreasing channel length L faces the trade-off of
diminishing active detector area. Particularly, in waveguide integrated devices, the
minimal channel length L is bounded by the waveguide width because the source and
drain contacts have to be placed far enough from the waveguide to reduce optical
absorption. This limitation becomes even more severe for mid-infrared devices because
the waveguide width increases proportionally with the operation wavelength so mid-
infrared waveguides are much larger than those for shorter wavelength operation.
Consequently, both the photodetection efﬁciency and photoresponse speed of laterally
conﬁgured BP photodetectors are limited by the channel width.
To overcome this limitation, the photodetector can be constructed using a vertical
conﬁguration with BP as the photoactive layer sandwiched vertically between two
contacts. In such a conﬁguration, the channel length is reduced to the thickness of the
BP layer, and the total active area is not reduced. Photocarriers generated in the middle
of the BP layers only need to travel through the layers to reach the contacts. Therefore,
the transport time τt is drastically reduced even accounting for the fact that the out-of-
plane mobility is likely much lower than in-plane mobility in BP. Even assuming a
through-layer mobility of μ = 1 cm2/Vs and bias voltage of 0.1 V, the transport time in
BP of 10 nm thick is only 10 ps.
However, for such a vertical device to work, the contacts must be made of
transparent material. For this purpose, graphene serves as an ideal material to be
used as the electrical contact because if affords both low optical absorption
and high electrical conductivity. Similar vertical heterostructures of monolayer
transition-metal dichalcogenides and graphene have already been reported by many
groups [59, 87–89] and picosecond photoresponse time has been demonstrated [90].

In a graphene–BP–graphene vertical heterostructure, a bias voltage is applied to
facilitate the separation and transport of electron and hole photocarriers to be col-
lected, respectively, by the top and bottom graphene contacts. They will then transport
in the graphene layers laterally with high mobility, for both electrons and holes, to
generate photocurrent. By optimizing the initial doping in the top and bottom gra-
phene contact, an ideal band alignment within the heterostructure can be achieved
with the Fermi levels of both layers of graphene lying within the band gap of BP. With
such a band alignment, the dark current associated with thermal injection carriers from
the graphene into the BP can be minimized. Additionally, the majority of photocar-
riers generated in the graphene layers have sufﬁcient energy to overcome the barrier to
enter the BP and be collected. Overall, the photodetection internal quantum efﬁciency
of such a vertical graphene–BP–graphene heterostructure will be very close to 100%,
and its response speed will reach above 100 GHz. The heterostructure is also suitable
for both normal incidence and waveguide integrated photodetectors based on different
application needs.
23.3.3
Solar cells
Electrostatically gated
Building on the ambipolar ﬁeld-effect of black phosphorus (described in detail in the
previous chapter, which focused on the electronic properties of black phosphorus),
Buscema and Groenendijk et al. have fabricated p–n junctions via local electrostatic
gating. The devices are based on two local split gates [64]. An h-BN layer, used as an
atomically ﬂat and disorder-free gate dielectric, is transferred on top of two electrodes
that will be used as local gates. Then a few-layer black phosphorus ﬂake is transferred
as the channel material. The devices have been fabricated by exploiting a recently
developed all-dry deterministic transfer method. Electrical contacts are deﬁned in a ﬁnal
step by e-beam lithography. Figure 23.9 shows one black phosphorus p–n junction
device based on this approach and an example of Ids–Vds characteristics of a locally
gated device in different gate conﬁgurations. When the two gates are biased with the
same polarity, the device shows an almost metallic behavior while for the PN or NP
conﬁguration, the Ids–Vds curves become rectifying.
Upon illumination, the Ids–Vds curves display a net current at zero-bias (so-called
short circuit current Isc) and the reverse current increases, as shown in Fig. 23.9. This is
a feature of the photovoltaic effect where the generated photocurrent adds to the
reverse-bias current. The inset in Fig. 23.9 shows the electrical power (Pel = VdsIds)
generated by the device, which reaches about 13 pW under the largest illumination
power. Even near-infrared (NIR) photons give rise to photocurrent, opening up the
possibility to harvest NIR photons in photovoltaic applications.
Compared to electrostatically gated solar cells realized with other layered materials
such as WSe2 [56, 73, 91, 92], the black phosphorus solar cells present a more extended
wavelength operation range, a similar external quantum efﬁcient EQE, but a lower
open-circuit voltage (Voc). The lower open-circuit voltage is consistent with the smaller
band gap of the black phosphorus compared with that of WSe2.

Van der Waals Heterostructures
Another concept of the black phosphorus-based solar cell device, alternative to the split-
gate architecture, relies on artiﬁcial vertical stacking of two nanosheets with n-type and
p-type doping to form a vertical p–n junction with a built-in electric ﬁeld due to the
difference in doping between the two stacked layers [93].
In [93], Deng et al. fabricated a black phosphorus-based solar cell by exploiting the
intrinsic p-type doping of exfoliated black phosphorus and the strong n-type behavior
of CVD grown MoS2 in a vertically stacked geometry (see Fig. 23.10(a) for a sketch
and an optical image of the fabricated device). Due to the different doping levels
of the two nanolayers, the device showed a strong rectifying (diode-like) behavior
(see Fig. 23.10(b)), and upon illumination the built-in electric ﬁeld at the interface
between the two materials was strong enough to separate the photogenerated
electron–hole pairs. Figure 23.10(c) shows the photogenerated electrical power in
the solar cell.
Similar concepts of p–n junction-based solar cells with black phosphorus have been
fabricated by combining black phosphorus with conventional n-type semiconductors.
Figure 23.10(d) shows a sketch illustrating the fabrication of a p–n junction based on
GaAs and black phosphorus reported by Gehring et al. [94] and an optical image of the
resulting device. Similar to the MoS2/black phosphorus p–n junction devices, these
GaAs/black phosphorus p–n junctions show marked rectifying behavior (due to the
difference in the doping level between the two materials), and upon illumination the

electric ﬁeld at the heterojunction also separates the photogenerated carriers, reaching
external quantum efﬁciencies (EQE) values of up to 10%.
23.4
Outlook and Remarks
The prospects for the applications of black phosphorus in optoelectronic devices are
very bright. Compared with other 2D materials, including graphene and transition metal
dichalcogenides, the direct and narrow band gap of black phosphorus is a signiﬁcant
advantage for infrared light detection and modulation. Its band gap ranges, from
~0.3 eV in many-layer ﬁlms to 1.5–1.8 eV in monolayers, cover the mid-infrared
spectral range up to ~4.1 μm in wavelength, where important applications, including
free-space and ﬁber optics-based communication and remote spectroscopic sensing, are
emerging, as mid-infrared laser sources are becoming more available [95, 96]. The
current technology of mid-infrared detection is based on mercury cadmium telluride
(MCT) and InSb photodetectors or quantum well infrared photodetectors (QWIP). Both
use expensive materials that have to be epitaxially grown and are not suitable for
integration with silicon technology. In contrast, 2D materials, such as black phosphorus,
can be directly transferred onto silicon and bonded with van der Waals force. Given the
already demonstrated performance in the near-infrared and the excellent transport
properties of black phosphorus devices, the development of black phosphorus

mid-infrared photodetectors is very promising, with high performance to be integrated
with silicon mid-infrared photonics [96]. To achieve performance rivaling the current
technology, black phosphorus can beneﬁt by forming heterostructures with other 2D
materials, such as graphene and boron nitride. Particularly, since the band-gap size is
determined by the number of layers in black phosphorus, it is desirable to control the
layer numbers in different regions of a device in order to obtain the desired band
alignment to facilitate the efﬁciency of, for example, photocarrier generation and
transportation.
Although black phosphorus photodetector devices have already been demonstrated,
only relatively simple architectures have been studied so far and more complex device
architectures and combinations of black phosphorus with other two-dimensional mater-
ials or other semiconductor materials need to be explored [93, 94, 97–99]. For example,
the combination of quantum dots with graphene have dramatically improved the
detectivity of graphene-based photodetectors (up to a 109 time improvement) [100].
Another topic that is attracting interest in the ﬁeld of optoelectronics, is the use of
two-dimensional semiconductors for light emission by exploiting the electrolumines-
cence [56, 91, 92, 101–103]. Black phosphorus light-emitting devices hold the promise
to emit photons in the NIR part of the spectrum while maintaining high ﬂexibility and
transparency.
Despite of all the promises, however, there are two major roadblocks that must be
solved before black phosphorus optoelectronic devices can achieve wide applications.
The ﬁrst is the lack of method to grow large-area black phosphorus ﬁlms. While other
2D materials, including graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, have been
successfully grown with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) methods in many areas,
with high-quality, black phosphorus, currently they can only be exfoliated from bulk
crystals in small ﬂakes. Although millimeter sized single crystals can now be grown of
high quality and purity [104], and larger ﬂakes can be exfoliated from those, it is still not
sufﬁcient for large-scale integration in black phosphorus devices. Therefore, develop-
ment of a large-area growth method is imperative for research into black phosphorus. So
far, there are preliminary results demonstrating large-area growth of nanocrystalline
[105] or amorphous black phosphorus [12]. It seems CVD methods, with the use of
proper precursors that inhibit 3D growth but promote 2D growth of thin ﬁlm on a
substrate, is one of the promising ways to get highly crystalline large-area ﬁlms.
The second roadblock is the chemical stability of black phosphorus. It is widely
known that after being exfoliated from bulk crystal, black phosphorus thin ﬁlm
degrades, if exposed in ambient air, within hours through photoassisted reaction with
water and oxygen to form oxidized phosphorus species [17, 106]. It was later found that
oxide overlayers, such as aluminum oxide and hafnium oxide, deposited by atomic
layer deposition (ALD) methods, provide an effective passivation layer that can pre-
serve encapsulated black phosphorus for weeks [107]. Sandwiching black phosphorus
between graphene or hexagonal boron nitride layers can also passivate black phos-
phorus [108]. However, if the fabrication process is not carried out in an oxygen and
water free environment, such as a dry glovebox, the black phosphorus can still be
contaminated. Many non-ideal performances reported in the literature were attributed to

contamination and degradation of black phosphorus. Therefore, methods providing
long-term and stable passivation of black phosphorus, and a fabrication process that
does not cause further exposure to oxygen and water are utterly important to achieve the
promised performance of black phosphorus devices.

Silicene, Germanene, and Stanene

Introduction
Recently, group IV honeycomb monolayer materials, that is, the silicon, germanium,
and tin-based analogues of graphene, namely, silicene, germanene, and stanene, have
attracted considerable interest. These novel synthetic two-dimensional (2D) Si, Ge, and
Sn allotropes are artiﬁcially created, since, at variance with graphene, which inherits
from graphite, they have no parent crystal in nature.
Due to the strong effective spin–orbit coupling, these analogues are predicted to be
robust two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators and ideal candidates for the
quantum spin Hall effect at accessible temperatures, even at room temperature (RT).
Exotic high temperature superconductivity is also theoretically suggested.
Furthermore, these emerging elemental 2D materials are expected to be directly
compatible with the current Si-based device technologies. In this respect, the ﬁrst
silicene ﬁeld-effect transistors operating at room temperature were fabricated in early
2015. This already demonstrates the potential of these novel materials for future
applications in nanoelectronics.
As we will see in this chapter, a cornucopia of unprecedented exotic properties,
which appear out of reach of graphene, are envisaged for silicene, graphene, stanene,
and their derivatives. Many of them are likely to be exploited in spintronics, valley-
tronics, or quantum computing.
24.2
The Advent of Silicene
Graphene (Part I of this book), which stems from graphite, its mother natural crystal,
came to the forefront of nanoscience in 2004 with its outstanding properties; it has
further initiated the search for other atom-thin 2D materials.
In the wake of graphene, researchers ﬁrst looked for existing semiconducting or
insulating layered crystals that could possibly be peeled down to single monolayer
ﬂakes using the now famous scotch tape method. Success came with transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), which could be easily exfoliated (see Part II of this book).
Typically, molybdenum disulﬁde, MoS2, permitted the fabrication of the ﬁrst TMD
single-layer transistor in 2011 [1]. More recently, the (re)-discovery in 2014 of black

phosphorous, an already existing elemental direct gap semiconductor, has led to the ﬁrst
few-layer phosphorene transistors [2].
In the realm of 2D materials, besides the ones initially peeled from lamellar crystals,
the synthetic emerging elemental ones appear as strong contenders to graphene in a
booming new ﬁeld. The main reason is that the opening of a sufﬁcient band gap for
current semiconductor electronic applications does not appear possible in practice for
graphene. As a consequence, the question raised by Ross Kozarsky, senior analyst at
Lux Research, at the Washington DC, Nanotech Conference and Expo 2013: “Is
Graphene the Next Silicon . . . Or Just the Next Carbon Nanotube?” was answered
without appeal last July: “Just don’t expect graphene to live up to the untenable hype, or
become the next silicon.”
The ﬁrst suggestion of a Si-based 2D material can be traced back to an article
published in 1994 [3], but essentially unnoticed for 17 years. Its two authors
K. Takeda and K. Shiraishi had theoretically predicted the possible existence of a novel
2D hexagonal silicon allotrope with a corrugated stage, i.e., a mixed sp2/sp3
hybridization of its Si atoms, yielding a ~0.4 nm buckling between the A and
B sublattices, as shown in Fig. 24.1, at variance with graphene, which is ﬂat because
of the pure sp2 hybridization of its C atoms.

Epitaxial Silicene
24.3.1
The Archetype Silicene Phase
In a creative endeavor, a few groups tried to synthesize silicene, as the hypothesized 2D
material was named in 2007 [4], and further conﬁrmed to be dynamically stable in a low
buckled conﬁguration with a lattice parameter of 0.383 nm, Si—Si bond distance of
0.225 nm, and buckling height of 0.044 nm in 2009 [5]. The ﬁrst compelling evidence
of the realization of silicene was published in 2012 [6]: graphene’s silicon cousin was
created in situ, under ultra-high vacuum (UHV), by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) as
an artiﬁcial atom-thin lattice of Si atoms epitaxially grown on top of the (111) surface of
a silver single crystal template held at ~200–220 C. This growth mirrored extensive
ones of silver onto the Si(111) surface, where an atomically abrupt interface was formed

with a magic coincidence between four Ag(111) unit vectors and three Si(111) ones
perfectly aligned in a parallel arrangement [7].
As seen in Fig. 24.2, the unique “ﬂower pattern” observed in scanning tunneling
microscopy (STM) imaging does not directly reveal the structure of the silicene
monolayer.
The characteristic underlying honeycomb arrangement of the Si atoms was inferred
from the Ag(111) 4  4 low-energy electron diffraction pattern pointing to the epitaxial
relationship mentioned above, the measurement of a new linear band at the common.
The KSi/KAg point of the surface Brillouin zone (non-dispersing with the k⊥vector
in angle-resolved photoemission measurements) and thorough density functional
theory calculations within the general gradient approximation (DFT-GGA calcula-
tions) enable the exact simulation of the STM images. All this conﬁrmed the initial
guess of a 3  3 reconstructed silicene sheet in perfect match with a 4  4 coincidence
supercell on Ag(111) yielding a nominal coverage of 18 Si atoms per 16 Ag surface
atoms, i.e., θSi = 1.125. The prototype 3  3 silicene phase was thus created but not a
primitive one that could have been expected from theoretical studies of standalone
silicene for a non-interacting couple. As a matter of fact, all silicene phases synthesized
until now on silver [8–12] or other metallic substrates, namely, ZrB2(0001) [13] and Ir
(111) [14] surfaces are reconstructed because the silicene/metal interaction is rather
strong. As demonstrated through fundamental surface crystallography arguments and
DFT calculations, a pristine, unreconstructed, silicene sheet on Ag(111) has not been
made [15].
The 3  3 silicene phase on Ag(111) is recognized as the archetype silicene phase by
all experimental and theoretical groups worldwide. It has passed crucial diffraction
tests, which have revealed its detailed atomic structure. Both reﬂection high-energy
positron diffraction (RHEPD) [16] and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) [17]
experiments have conﬁrmed that the “ﬂower pattern” seen in STM imaging originates
from Si atoms within the honeycomb array, which markedly protrude because they

from the protruding Si atoms within the 3  3 reconstructed silicene layer which coincides
with a 4  4 Ag(111) supercell; the 3  3Si/4  4Ag supercell is indicated. (b) Perspective view of

mainly sit on top of Ag atoms. The intrinsic buckling and inherent adaptability of
silicene facilitates the emergence of the 3  3 puckered structure which conforms to the
substrate in a compliant fashion and can cover 95% of the surface [16]. The puckering
of 0.083 nm derived from these RHEPD measurements and all other geometrical
quantities are in very good agreement with the values calculated previously [6].
24.3.2
Sister Silicene Phases
The adaptive character of silicene favors the appearance of other rotational epitaxial
phases on Ag(111), observed in LEED patterns. Differently buckled rotated phases in
coincidence with √13  √13R(13.9) Ag(111) supercells may cover large areas of the
substrate’s surface at slightly higher preparation temperatures (~250 C). We have
observed new STM structures in four different domains supporting an interpretation
in terms of √7  √7R(19.1) reconstructed silicene in small extension (by ~2%) with a
slightly reduced coverage of θSi = 1.077 [18, 15]. Instead, others favor a 3  3 silicene
reconstruction with a higher nominal coverage of θSi = 1.385 [19]; however, we note
that it could exist only in two different domains. As yet no structural determination has
solved the issue.
In STM imaging at 4.2 K, this phase reveals a surprising vortex-like arrangement as
shown in Fig. 24.3.
We assign this to compressive strain, a consequence of the negative thermal expan-
sion coefﬁcient of silicene [21]: when the silicene/Ag(111) system prepared at ~210 C
is cooled down, silicene expands, while silver shrinks. The stress is relieved through a
complex buckling re-arrangement into large triangular domains and vortices, which still
maintain, because of its adaptability, the continuity of the silicene layer, as shown in
Figs. 24.3(b) and (c).
A few other phases have also been described in the literature, e.g., by Arafune et al.
[22], but identiﬁcation as real silicene phases is not fully ascertained.

24.3.3
The Fate of the 2√3  2√3 Superstructure
A 2√3  2√3R(30) superstructure (noted in terms of Ag(111) basis vectors) was
initially claimed in 2010, just by observation of STM topographs, to reveal directly a
highly perfect, nearly ﬂat, honeycomb silicene arrangement with a very small in-plane
Si—Si distance of dSi–Si ~ 0.19 nm that would be formed only between 220 C and
250 C [23]. It turns out that this was just a false start: such data have never been
reproduced, and, actually, the apparent honeycomb structure was shown to be merely a
contrast reversed image of the bare Ag(111) surface [24].
Later some of the previous authors presented the 2√3  2√3R(30) superstructure
grown, instead, at 300 C; however, this superstructure had in this case a highly
defective appearance in STM imaging [25]. Further, the real nature of the corresponding
hypothetical √7  √7R(19.1) silicene structure was shown to be inherently defective
and inhomogeneous, a mere patchwork of fragmented pieces [10, 15, 26]. In addition,
several observations and measurements have revealed its sudden death, to end, in a
dynamic fading process at 300 C, on the one hand, in multilayer islands through a
dewetting mechanism [27, 28], and, on the other hand, in the burial of an alloy [29],
most probably conﬁned below the surface.

Electronic Structure of Silicene
24.4.1
Electronic Structure of Standalone Silicene and Germanene
Most studies of the electronic structure of silicene and germanene concern their free-
standing forms. As mentioned above and illustrated in Fig. 24.4, Cahangirov et al. [5]
demonstrated the existence of Dirac cones at the corners of the Brillouin zone (BZ),

as in in graphene and with comparable Fermi velocities for the so-called low-
buckled structures.
Silicene and germanene are thus analogues of graphene, keeping many of its
properties despite their intrinsic bucklings. However, the heavier Si and Ge elements
and the signiﬁcant bucklings confer to silicene and germanene speciﬁc key intrinsic
properties that are out of reach of graphene. Typically, application of an electric ﬁeld
perpendicular to the 2D lattices breaks the symmetry between the two A and B
sublattices, which can open a band gap [30]. Furthermore, the signiﬁcant non-trivial
band gaps related to a much stronger effective spin–orbital coupling than in graphene,
would make silicene and germanene potential 2D topological insulators (TIs), possibly
yielding a quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect at easily accessible temperatures [31, 32].
Such QSH states in TIs provide new opportunities for low-dissipation spintronic
devices due to the absence of backscattering and possible superconductivity, as
recalled by Kou et al. [33].
24.4.2
Electronic Structure of Epitaxial 3  3 Silicene on Ag(111)
Studies on the electronic structure of epitaxial monolayer silicene have mainly focused
on the archetype 3  3 phase, prompted by the initial observation of a new linearly
dispersing band, seemingly gapped by ~0.6 eV at the Ksilicene point of the 1  1 silicene
BZ, due to interaction with the Ag(111) surface [6]. The same gap was also measured at
the zone centre Γ00 and at the MAg points, which are Γ points of the 3  3 BZ of
reconstructed epitaxial silicene [34]. Interestingly, when extracted from the Ag(111)
surface, the 3  3 reconstructed silicene monolayer possesses a direct band gap, as
demonstrated in state-of-the-art ﬁrst-principles calculations, including many-body
effects by the GW approximation and also incorporating the van der Waals interaction
with the Ag substrate [35]. However, the assignment to pure silicene-related π bands
has been questioned [36]. Instead, the new band SP has been assigned to a strong
hybridization with the silver bands [37]. Nevertheless, Fig. 24.5 shows that silicene on
Ag(111) still forms graphene-like bands featuring a steep cone-like dispersion around
KAg with effective Fermi velocity 1.3  106 m s–1 and saddle points around MAg.
As underlined by Houssa et al., this could open new areas of research focusing on
new hybrid semiconductor-metallic systems with graphene-like electronic band struc-
tures [35]. The strong hybridization could also explain why Landau levels were not
measured in STS experiments under a high magnetic ﬁeld [38, 39].
24.5
Functionalization of Silicene
As opposed to graphene, which is essentially inert, silicene and germanene are chem-
ically reactive, thus enabling rather easy functionalization to tune their properties and
further expand their palette of applications. In the following, we will just consider
hydrogenation to illustrate promising possibilities.

24.5.1
Hydrogenation of Free-Standing Silicene: Theoretical Studies
Different hydrogenation adsorption conﬁgurations have been treated by several authors
and recently re-examined by Yu et al. [40]. To summarize, full hydrogenation on both
sides gives non-magnetic semiconductors, namely silicane and germanane, for which
the chair conﬁguration is found to have the lowest energy. For silicane, the gap of
~2.21 eV is indirect, while for germanane it is direct with a value of ~1.33 eV. One-side
fully hydrogenated silicene and germanene have indirect band gaps. Regardless of the
arrangement of hydrogen atoms, band-gap opening due to semihydrogenation is pre-
dicted both for silicene and germanene. Remarkably, chair conﬁgurations in this
semihydrogenation case are ferromagnetic, the spin moments being mainly carried by
the Si or Ge atoms that are not bonded with H.
24.5.2
Hydrogenation of 3  3 Epitaxial Silicene on Ag(111): Experimental Results
Wu’s group was the ﬁrst to report on the ordered and reversible partial hydrogenation of
the epitaxial 3  3 silicene phase [41]. Amazingly, the 3  3 supercell is maintained,

but, indeed, with a very different internal structure, as seen in the STM image of
Fig. 24.6 obtained in Marseille, where similar observations have been made [42]. Here,
the H atoms saturate the Si dangling bonds in a surprising manner: they favor one of the
sublattices (six H atoms on one sublattice on the right half of the supercell) over the other
(a single H atom on the other sublattice on the left half of the supercell). Obviously, this
imbalance is likely to favor magnetic ordering, if not weird topological properties.
At higher doses, H atoms may even bond below the silicene layer and full
hydrogenation may be reached, as strong resistance to oxygen, testiﬁed in high resolution
electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements, seem to indicate that
despite over night exposure in a poor vacuum no OH related vibration loss was detected
[42]. The strange aspect is the preservation of a 3  3 supercell, possibly pointing to
reconstructed epitaxial “silicane” on Ag(111), while, instead, H intercalation could have
been anticipated to favor lifting off from the Ag(111) surface, as in the case of graphene
on silicon carbide. Obviously, all these intriguing results require more work, especially
serious theoretical studies.
24.6
Multilayer Silicene
Upon continuing to deposit Si onto Ag(111) beyond the ﬁrst silicene monolayer,
multilayer silicene grows in a terrace fashion, like rice ﬁelds in mountainous regions
[43]. Multilayer silicene has just one unique structure: a √3  √3R(30) reconstruction
with respect to primitive silicene. However, depending on the ﬁrst silicene layer,
whether showing the sole 3  3 silicene phase on 4  4 domains or, instead,
also √13  √13R(13.9) reconstructed domains with respect to Ag(111), as discussed

indicated in top left corner); the protrusions correspond to H atoms bonded to Si atoms.

above in Section 24.3, the √3  √3 structure growing on top can have orientations,
respectively, at 30, 33 and 5.2 [18, 44], as illustrated in Fig. 24.7.
STS measurements showing linear dispersions [45] and synchrotron radiation photo-
emission measurements have demonstrated that √3  √3R(30) multilayer silicene hosts
massless Dirac fermions, evidenced in the cone sections recorded in ARPES around the
zone centre Γ (see Fig. 24.8), with a very high Fermi velocity of ~0.3  106 m s–1, about
one third of that of free-standing graphene [46]. The Dirac point is located at ~0.3 eV
below the Fermi level because of charge transfer from the metallic silver substrate
yielding partial ﬁlling of the π* upper cone.
Transport measurements performed in situ using a four-probe STM, free of short-
circuit paths through the Ag support, have revealed a sheet resistance of silicene, which
is comparable to the one found for graphite in nanograins [43]. Furthermore, multi-layer
silicene is self-protected for at least 24 hours in ambient air by an ultra-thin native oxide
skin, which preserves the integrity of the silicene sheets underneath [47]. Clearly, both
results are highly promising for electronic applications.
Nevertheless, the true nature of multilayer silicene is debated. Despite Raman
signatures differing from those of silicon [47, 48] and a measured in-plane lattice
parameter shrunk by ~4% with respect to that of the (111) plane of bulk silicon
[43, 49], several authors argue that it simply does not exist: it would be cubic diamond-
like silicon (111) layers either terminated by the Si(111)√3  √3R(30)-Ag reconstruc-
tion due to the one monolayer of silver segregating at the surface [50], or, instead,
having just an intrinsic weak buckling forming a honeycomb structure with Dirac
surface states without invoking Ag surfactants [51, 52].

We hope that such controversial issues will be solved soon and multilayer silicene
will be conﬁrmed with its anticipated outstanding properties. Typically, itinerant
ferromagnetism and p + ip0 superconductivity is predicted in doped bilayer silicene
[53]. As seen above, bilayers grown on Ag(111) are effectively doped due to charge
transfer from the substrate. This could be a reason of the indication, although not
presently conﬁrmed, for high-Tc superconductivity up to nearly 40 K for the silicene
√3  √3R(30) phase [54].
24.7
Germanene and Stanene
24.7.1 Single-layer and Multilayer Germanene
Single-layer germanene has been synthesized recently on gold (see Fig. 24.9) [55],
aluminum [56], and platinum [57] (111) surfaces (although this has been disputed in the
latter case because of the likely formation, instead, of a surface alloy [58]), as well as on
Ge2Pt clusters [59–61].
Just like silicene, free-standing germanene does not exist, but it is predicted to be a
buckled honeycomb 2D Dirac material [5] with extremely high mobilities of its charge
carriers [62]. The spin–orbit coupling along with the ~0.64 Å buckling opens up a
~24 meV band gap at the Dirac points signiﬁcantly higher than in silicene (1.55 meV);
this, together with the non-trivial topological properties, might result in a quantum spin

Hall effect detectable at RT [63]. Electrostatic ﬁelds externally applied can permit
tuning the band gap and can generate topological phase transitions and helical zero-
energy modes [32]. Proximity with an s-wave superconductor and photoirradiation
could create a photoinduced topological superconductor hosting controllable Majorana
fermions [64]. These fascinating properties offer tantalizing prospects for future appli-
cations in electronics, spintronics, and quantum computing. Since Ge is currently used
as a performance booster in thin FET channels, perspectives of using germanene for
scaling down beyond the 5 nm node while increasing the speed and lowering the energy
consumption of electronic devices are very promising.
However, single-layer germanene created directly on metal surfaces is likely to lose
the massless Dirac fermion character and other unique physical properties of free-
standing germanene because of the interfacial coupling. This issue has just been
overcome by synthesizing multilayer epitaxial germanene and demonstrating that it
possesses Dirac cones [65], as does its sibling, multilayer silicene [43, 46, 47]. Indeed,
this will facilitate transfer to semiconducting or insulating substrates and make germa-
nene more practical for use in devices.
24.7.2
Single-Layer Stanene
Stanene, sometimes written stannene (from stannum, latin) and also sometimes coined
tinene, has just been realized on Bi2Te3(111) substrates [66]. The sizeable spin–orbit
coupling in stanene could permit exploiting its topological insulator phases and lead to
the development of a new class of low-energy consumption nanoelectronic devices.
Especially, as theoretically described, but not yet realized, a germanium (111) substrate
could be very convenient to render stanene amenable for implementation in current
semiconductor technology as a topological transistor. The transistor channel would be
replaced by the 2D TI, the conductivity switched on and off at high speed by tuning the
gate voltage with low-energy consumption [67].

24.8
Summary
We have described the birth of single-layer silicene, germanene, and stanene, gra-
phene’s group IV elemental cousins, respectively, in 2012, 2014, and 2015, and,
further, the debut of multilayer silicene and germanene. These novel synthetic two-
dimensional Si, Ge, and Sn allotropes are artiﬁcially created in situ under ultra-high
vacuum, since, at variance with graphene, which descends from graphite, they have no
parent crystal in nature. Indeed, this is an extraordinary development.
We have also surveyed some of their fascinating properties, notably, their easy
functionalization, which make them promising candidates and rivals of graphene for
ultimate scaling of nanoelectronic devices. The recent fabrication of the ﬁrst silicene
ﬁeld-effect transistors with ambipolar characteristics operating at room temperature
demonstrates their potential as emerging 2D electronic materials. Since germanene
and stanene, with near room temperature 2D topological insulators, are also expected
to be easily incorporated into the existing silicon-based industry, their advent, which
could lead to the development of a new class of low-energy consumption nanoelectronic
devices, excites a rapidly expanding community.
Still, the properties and potential applications of these emerging 2D materials are far
from being fully explored, but prospects for nanoelectronics, spintronics, and quantum
computing are highly promising.

Predictions of Single-Layer
Honeycomb Structures from
First Principles
S. Ciraci and S. Cahangirov
25.1
Motivation and Methodology
Finding a contender for graphene in the ﬁeld of 2D electronics and in other possible
potential applications of nanotechnology has derived active search for graphene like
novel structures, which do not exist in nature. As a matter of fact, the types of 3D
layered materials, which make the exfoliation of their single-layer (SL) structures
possible, are limited only to graphite, 2h-BN, 2h-MoS2, 2h-WS2, black phosphorus
etc. However, most of desired electronic and magnetic properties demand materials that
do not have layered allotropes. In view of the location of C, B, and N elements in the
periodic table, which constitute SL graphene and BN, questions have been raised as to
whether other group IV elements, group III–V and II–VI compounds may also form SL
structures. The theoretical methods have provided for quick answers to guide further
experiments. These methods, based on the quantum theory, have now reached now a
level of providing accurate predictions for chemical, mechanical, electronic, magnetic,
and optical properties of matter.
In our group, we have carried out studies to explore novel materials in SL structure
constituted by group IV elements, group III–V and II–VI, group V elements, transition
metal oxides, and dichalcogenides, MX2 in h- and t-structures. We also consider their
functionalization by decoration of ad-atoms, by creation of the mesh of vacancies and
voids, by formation of nanoribbons or in-plane heterostructures. Most of the elements
which construct SL materials have valence orbitals similar to carbon. These are atoms
having s2 and pm valence orbitals, which can allow three folded, planar sp2 hybrid
orbitals to form σ-bonds between two atoms located at the corners of hexagons. This
way a three-fold coordinated honeycomb structure can be constructed. Remaining p
orbitals form bonding (antibonding) π- (π*-) bonds with nearest neighbors. While the
σ-bonds between atoms maintain the mechanical strength, π–π*-bonds assure the planar
geometry and dominate the electronic energy structure near the Fermi level. SL
structures including at least one element from the ﬁrst row of the periodic table, prefer
a planar structure such as graphene, h-BN and SiC, since the π-bond is strong enough to
maintain the planar geometry. However, the situation is different for SL structures
constructed by elements from rows lying below the ﬁrst one, where nearest-neighbor
distance is relatively longer and hence a weaker π-bond cannot maintain the planar
geometry. At the end, the structure is stabilized by dehybridization of planar sp2
472

orbitals, and eventually rehybridization of sp3-like orbitals. Accordingly, the structure is
buckled, where alternating atoms located at the corners of the hexagon are displaced in
opposite and perpendicular directions. In this structural transformation, the projection of
atoms continue to form again a honeycomb structure with a 2D hexagonal lattice.
Minimizing the calculated total energy and also atomic forces at each atomic site
attains a theoretical prediction of a structure or its functional form. Once the structure
optimization resulted in a new SL honeycomb structure, the main issue is whether this
structure is stable. Especially, the stability of a structure above room temperature is
necessary for technological applications. First, ab-initio phonon calculations are carried
out to check whether the SL structure remains stable after small displacements of atoms.
The structure is viewed as stable when all the frequencies of phonon modes are positive
and hence the SL structure corresponds to a local minimum on the Born–Oppenheimer
(BO) surface. Imaginary frequencies indicate that the displacements of corresponding
modes cannot be restored, and then the structure eventually dissassociates. Even if
positive phonon frequencies indicate stability, it cannot be assumed that the structure
corresponds to a deep local minimum on the BO surface and will remain stable under
thermal excitations at high temperature.
The stability at high temperatures is then investigated by performing ab-initio, ﬁnite
temperature molecular dynamics (MD) calculations using two different approaches.
Either the Nosè thermostat is used and Newton’s equations are integrated through the
Verlet algorithm with a time step of 1–2 femtoseconds, or the velocities of atoms were
scaled at each time step to keep the temperature constant. MD simulations carried out
for several picoseconds at temperatures as high as 1000 K to ensure that the SL structure
does not dissociate and hence can remain stable at least above room temperature.
Notably, some of the honeycomb structures deduced by the total energy and force
calculations were dissociated already at low temperatures after a few time steps, since
they were actually unstable.
In addition to phonon frequency and high temperature MD calculations, the stability
of optimized structures are subjected to further tests. For example, the possibility that
the optimized structure can undergo reconstruction covering several primitive unit cells
is tested by optimization in large n  n supercells. Another possibility that the
optimized structure may dissociate or change into clusters is examined by the adsorp-
tion of speciﬁc ad-atoms or by the formation of defects. Positive cohesive and forma-
tion energies are indicative of stability. High mechanical strength suggests robustness.
An optimized SL structure, which passes all these stringent tests, is then considered to
be stable in the freestanding state even if its parent 3D crystal is not layered like
graphite. It should be noted that the stability of an SL structure does not mean that it
can be synthesized; rather it means that this structure remains stable once it is
synthesized in freestanding form. Since certain SL structures can be synthesized only
by growing them on speciﬁc inert substrates, SL structure–substrate interaction may
modify the properties calculated for the freestanding form. Therefore, the properties of
the SL structure grown on substrates are calculated to see whether they are affected by
the substrate. Single-layer, bilayer, multilayer, and layered periodic structures derived
from freestanding SL structures may be stable and display properties gradually

changing with the number of layers. These multilayers can be considered as new
polymorphisms of a given SL structure.
The stable SL honeycomb structures are characterized by calculating their equilib-
rium optimized structural parameters: total energy ET; cohesive energy EC relative to
constituent free atoms; formation energy Ef relative to the allotrope having lowest total
energy (in the global minimum); elastic, electronic, magnetic, optical properties, etc.
In-plane stiffness, C = A1
o ∂2ET/∂ε2 (Ao being the equilibrium area of the unit cell) and
the Poisson’s ratio ν = –εy /εx are relevant quantities to quantify the strength and elastic
properties of an SL structure. Because of their dimensionality, these structures attain
high Poisson ratio and high uniaxial strain under uniaxial stress. In this respect,
monitoring of the electronic structure – in particular, of the fundamental band gap with
applied strain – is crucial for SL materials. The total charge density ρ(r), charge transfer
between constituent atoms are also calculated to provide further information about the
character of the binding and bond formation.
The total energies of structures and atomic forces are calculated from the ﬁrst-
principles pseudopotential calculations based on the spin-polarized density functional
theory (DFT) using the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP) [1]. Since the
fundamental band gaps are underestimated by standard DFT, calculations are carried
out using the HSE06 hybrid functional [2] and quasi-particle GWo corrections [3].
25.2
Group IV Elements: Silicene, Germanene
Even before synthesis of isolated graphene, theoretical studies based on the minimiza-
tion of the total energy have pointed out that the single layer of Si in a buckled
honeycomb structure can exists [4, 5]. However, freestanding silicene and germanene,
together with their signature of massless Dirac fermion, ambipolar effects and nano-
ribbons showing familiar behavior, were ﬁrst predicted after an extensive stability
analysis [6, 7]. The need to unravel the exotic electronic structure and its integrability
into the well-established silicon technology has placed silicene at the forefront of
intensive theoretical and experimental research. Since Si and Ge do not have any 3D
layered allotropes like graphite with weak interlayer van der Waals interaction, silicene
cannot be exfoliated and hence freestanding silicene cannot exist in nature.
The stable structure of silicene (germanene) has the following calculated values: the
2D hexagonal lattice constant is a = 3.83 Å (3.97 Å); the buckling height is Δ = 0.44 Å
(0.64 Å) [6]. The phonon dispersion curves of silicene and germanene calculated for
optimized buckled structures are shown in Fig. 25.1(c). Their stability continues to exist
even above room temperature as revealed from ab-initio MD calculations performed at
1000 K for 10 picoseconds; similar tests have been done for ﬁnite size ﬂakes, indicating
stability above room temperature. The electronic energy band structures of silicene and
germanene presented in Fig. 25.1(d) show the π- and π*-bands linearly crossing at the
Fermi level. Spin–orbit coupling included later brought about other features such as
topological insulator behavior [8]. Not only the physical properties of 2D periodically
repeating silicene and germanene are similar to graphene, but also those of their

nanoribbons are reminiscent of graphene nanoribbons. For example, the armchair
nanoribbons of silicene display the behavior similar to graphene, except that the edge
atoms of the former are 2  1 reconstructed [6, 7].
Prediction of SL silicene boosted efforts to grow silicene on a substrate. Silicene was
synthesized for the ﬁrst time on an Ag(111) substrate [9]. It was shown that silicene
acquires a 3  3 reconstruction, which is in perfect match with the 4  4 supercell of the
Ag(111) surface. Moreover, linear bands near the Fermi level revealed by ARPES
performed on the 3  3 silicene grown on Ag(111) are attributed to the signiﬁcant
hybridization between silicene and Ag sp bands [10].
The √3  √3 reconstruction is also frequently observed when silicene is deposited on
an Ag(111) surface. Here two bright spots are formed in each √3  √3 supercell of
silicone, making a honeycomb STM pattern [11, 12]. In contrast to 3  3 and √7  √7
reconstructions, the √3  √3 reconstruction in silicene is not matched by any lattice
vector on the Ag(111) surface. Furthermore, it was found that the in-plane lattice
constant of √3  √3 silicene is 5% smaller than the corresponding value in freestanding
silicene. A model was proposed to explain the spontaneous formation of these 5%
contracted √3  √3 silicene structures [13]. According to this model, adding more Si

atoms on top of already formed silicene creates so-called dumbbell units [14, 15]. As the
number of dumbbells increase, they organize themselves in such a way that there are
two dumbbell units in each √3  √3 supercell. The resulting structure is spontaneously
contracted to a lattice constant of 6.4 Å, which is what was measured in the experiments
[11,12]. Later it was shown that even more layers with the √3  √3 reconstruction grow
as silicon continues to be deposited [16]. Interestingly, the multilayer silicene grown in
this fashion was shown to have a metallic character. On the theoretical side, it has been
possible to extend the aforementioned √3  √3 dumbbell monolayer of silicene into a
layered dumbbell structure called silicite [17]. This new allotrope of silicon is only
0.17 eV/atom less favorable than cubic diamond silicon and has an enhanced absorption
in the visible range. However, it does not reproduce ~3.0 Å interlayer separation
observed in multilayer silicene experiments. Recently, multilayer silicene reaching
40 layers was reported [18]. This structure was exposed to ambient air for 24 hours
and survived by creating a thin oxide layer on the surface.
More recently, a transistor made of silicene was shown to operate at room tempera-
ture [19]. Ambipolar Dirac charge transport with a room temperature mobility of
100 cm2/V s was measured in this system. Germanene was also synthesized by deposit-
ing germanium atoms on an Au(111) substrate [20]. The resulting structure was
complex with coexisting phases, one of which was shown to be √3  √3 germanene
matched by √7  √7 Au(111). Notably, adsorption of additional Ge ad-atoms on
germanene creates dumbbell units such as silicene [21]. Germanene was also synthe-
sized on an Al(111) surface [22]. In this case, the observed structure was uniform
consisting of 2  2 germanene matched by a 3  3 Al(111) surface. Finally, stanene
was also synthesized by depositing tin atoms on Bi2Te3(111) surface [23].
25.2.1.
Silicon Carbide
Bulk SiC is a material, which is convenient for high temperature and high power devices.
One expects that SL SiC can be synthesized, since graphene and silicene are already
synthesized, and it may exhibit physical properties which are desired for speciﬁc
applications in 2D electronics. First-principles calculations have predicted that SL SiC
is stable in a honeycomb structure [24]. It is an ionic compound semiconductor with
signiﬁcant charge transfer from the Si to C atom and has a fundamental band gap of
EG = 2.53 eV obtained using GGA, which increases to 3.90 eV after GoWo corrections.
Other relevant properties, i.e. bond length, cohesive energy, and in-plane stiffness, are
calculated to be d = 1.79 Å, EC = 11.94 eV/per SiC and C = 166 J/m2, respectively. When
compared with the calculated values of 3D bulk SiC in zincblende or wurtzite structure
and 1D chain structures, those of SL SiC in a honeycomb structure display intermediate
values, except that the band gap is largest in the SL honeycomb structure [24].
25.2.2
Silicatene
None of the allotropes of silica (i.e. amorphous or crystalline quartz) is known to
have a graphite-like layered structure. Despite that, efforts have been devoted to

grow a 2D ultra-thin polymorph of silica on substrates [25]. Recently, stable SL
allotropes of silica, named as hα-silica and silicatene have been predicted [26]. The
optimized structure of hα-silica, which is derived from ideal hβ-silica by lowering
energy by 0.7 eV is described in Fig. 25.2(a). Remarkably, hα-silica is predicted to
have a negative Poisson’s ν = 0.21. That is, as hα-silica is stretched along the
x-direction, it also expands in the y-direction, owing to its squeezed structure
consisting of twisted and bent Si—O—Si bonds resulting in a reentrant structure
as described in Fig. 25.2(a). The negative Poisson’s ratio is a rare situation and
those extreme materials having this property are called auxetic or metamaterials.
The semiconductor hα-silica is non-magnetic with a direct band gap of 2.2 eV.
Moreover, it is a rather rare situation that the variation in the calculated band gap is
strain speciﬁc; it increases with increasing uniaxial strain εx, but it decreases with
increasing εy.
Owing to the dangling bonds oozing from Si atoms, hα-silica is rather reactive;
through the saturation of Si dangling bonds upon oxidation it transforms to Si2O5 and
the band gap of hα-silica increases from 2.2 eV to 6 eV, attributing a high insulating
character and inertness like 3D silica. While the hexagon-like 2D geometry in
Fig. 25.2(a) is maintained, sp2 bonded Si atoms change to sp3 bonded Si atoms and
hence restore the rotary reﬂection symmetry. This way, Si atoms acquire the fourfold
coordination of oxygen atoms as shown in Fig. 25.2(b) as in 3D silica. Upon heating,
Si2O5 undergoes a structural transformation by further lowering (i.e. becoming more
energetic) its total energy by 2.63 eV. In this transformation, the ﬁrst half of the
dangling Si—O bonds rotate from top to bottom so that all are relocated at the bottom
side. Eventually, they are paired to form O—O bonds. The optimized structure
predicted in Fig. 25.2(b) replicates the structure of the SL silica in a honeycomb
structure named silicatene, the growth of which was achieved recently on a Ru(0001)
surface [28].

Group III–V and II–VI Compounds
Groups III–V and II–VI compound semiconductors in zincblende or wurtzite struc-
tures dominate electronics, and optoelectronics. The question whether GaAs can form
single wall nanotubes and SL honeycomb structures like graphene was addressed in
2005 [5]. Motivated by these early results, a comprehensive study has been carried out
to explore SL structures of group IV elements and group III–V compounds [27].
Ab-initio phonon frequency calculations, which resulted in positive frequencies, have
demonstrated that 17 new group IV–IV and group III–V compounds can remain stable
in a SL honeycomb structure once they are synthesized. The equilibrium structure
parameters, cohesive energy, energy band gap, the ratio of effective charges, Poisson’s
ratio, and in-plane stiffness calculated using LDA approximation are presented in
Table 25.1.
Using the calculated values from Table 25.1, interesting correlations between
cohesive energy and the lattice constant, and between in-plane stiffness and cohesive
energy were deduced as shown in Fig. 25.3. For example, as EC decreases, the lattice
constant a increases with increasing average row number of constituents. Similarly,
C and EC are correlated and both increase with decreasing average row number of
constituent elements.
Additionally, the commensurate 1D heterostructures of these materials constructed
from their nanoribbons, such as GaN/AlN having multiple quantum well structures
with their band-lineups, have been proposed as an extension to 2D SL honeycomb
structures [27]. It should be noted that by increasing the widths of nanoribbons and
constructing these heterostructures, one can attain in-plane heterostructures or com-
posite structures [29].
25.3.1
Group II–VI Compound: ZnO
Bulk ZnO is an important optoelectronic material, because of its wide band gap of
3.3 eV and large exiton binding energy of 60 meV leading to LED and solar cell
applications. Two-monolayer-thick ZnO(0001) ﬁlms have been grown on an Ag(111)
surface [30]. Based on ﬁrst-principles calculations, an SL ZnO in planar honeycomb
structure has been found to be stable [31]. It is a non-magnetic semiconductor and has a
lattice constant of a = 1.89 Å and a direct band gap (calculated by GGA and corrected
by GoWo) EG = 5.64 eV. In the bilayer of ZnO, the band gap decreases to 5.10 eV and
saturates at 3.32 eV in the graphitic h-ZnO structure. Zig-zag nanoribbons of ZnO are
ferromagnetic metals due to spins localized in oxygen atoms at the edges. Whereas bare
and H saturated armchair nanoribbons of ZnO are a non-magnetic semiconductor,
energy band gap saturates at 1.75 eV as their widths increase.
25.3.2
α-Graphyne and α-BNyne
The stable SL structures α-graphyne and α-BNyne are derived from a honeycomb lattice
with additional n atoms between the atoms placed at the corners of hexagon [32]. The

SL structure α-graphyne is stable for n = even and exhibits Dirac cones similar to
graphene. However, for n = odd, it is unstable and undergoes a structural transformation
by breaking hexagonal symmetry and opening a band gap. The SL structure α-BNyne is
a semiconductor with the band gap decreasing with increasing n; EG = 4.13 eV for n = 2,
but it decreases to EG = 3.46 eV. Both α-graphyne and α-BNyne form stable bilayers
with AB stacking.
25.4
Group V Elements: Nitrogene and Antimonene
More recently, the fabrication of a ﬁeld-effect transistors, using micrometer sized ﬂakes
consisting of two to three layers of black phosphorus [33] and theoretical analysis [34],
revealing the stability of its single-layer allotropes, i.e. blue and black phospherenes,
brought group V elements into focus. Recent theoretical analysis exploring the idea of
whether Sb and N can form SL structures have concluded that these two elements can
also form stable, SL buckled honeycomb structures, called nitrogene and antimonene,
respectively [35, 36].
Notably, while strong the N2 molecule is triple bonded, nitrogene is constructed from
threefold coordinated and single-bonded N atoms similar to the 3D cg-N crystalline
phase. However, unlike semimetallic graphene or silicene which have perfect electron–
hole symmetry, nitrogene is a wide band-gap insulator with a DFT band gap of EG =
3.96 eV (EG = 5.96 eV after HSE correction). The buckling distance is Δ = 0.7 Å and
cohesive energy is EC = 3.67 eV/atom [35, 36]. Moreover, nitrogene can form stable
nanoribbons with band gaps in the range of 0.6 eV < EG < 2.2 eV, bilayer and 3D
graphitic structure named nitrogenite.
Antimonene has a stable SL buckled honeycomb (h-Sb) structure, as well as an
asymmetric washboard (aW-Sb) structure; the latter has slightly higher cohesive energy.

Here we consider only h-Sb, which has cohesive energy EC = 2.87 eV and is a non-
magnetic semiconductor with an indirect band gap of 1.04 eV, calculated within PBE
approximation, which occurs between the minimum of the conduction band along the
Γ–M direction and a maximum of the valance band at the Γ point. Upon HSE correction
the indirect band gap increases to 1.55 eV. Apparently, the band gap of h-Sb lies in the
range, which is convenient for several 2D electronic applications. Free-standing SL
antimonene is metallized when grown on substrates such as a Ge(111) surface or
germanene. Also interlayer coupling is signiﬁcant and attributes metallicity to bilayer
and multilayer antimonene [35, 36].
25.5
Transition Metal Oxides and Dichalcogenides
Three-dimensional transition metal oxides or dichacogenides MX2 (M, transition metal;
X, oxygen or chalcogen atoms) compounds constitute one of the most interesting
classes of crystals; their wide range of properties have been investigated since 1960.
Some of these compounds have D6h-point group symmetry and are layered structures
formed by the stacking of weakly (vdW) interacting 2D MX2 layers and are speciﬁed as
2h-MX2 like layered MoS2 crystals. Another type of layered structure is speciﬁed as a
2t-structure (centered honeycomb) and has D3d-point-group symmetry. Some 3D MX2
structures are known to be stable in rutile, 3R, marcasite, anatase, pyrite, and tetragonal
structures.
Interest in 2D materials has led to the synthesis of SL MoS2 (38), WS2 (39) with
honeycomb structure and NBSe2 only on SiO2. Coleman et al. reported liquid exfoli-
ation of MoS2, WS2, MoSe2, TaS2, NbS2, NiTe2, and MoTe2 (40). In both h and t
structures, instead of forming covalent sp2-bonding with three neighboring atoms as in
graphene, each M atom has the six nearest X atoms and each X atom has the three
nearest M atoms forming p–d hybridized ionic M-X bonds. These 2D materials have

shown exceptional physical and chemical properties. For example, transistors fabricated
from a SL MoS2 presented features, which are superior to those of graphene [41]. Also
SL MoS2 appears to be promising for optoelectronic devices, solar cells, LEDs, and
HER (hydrogen evaluation reactions).
In an extensive theoretical study exploring other possible SL structures, out of
88 different combinations (M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Nb, Mo, W and
X = O, S, Se, Te) 52 freestanding, stable h-MX2 and t-MX2 structures have been
predicted [37]. The optimized lattice constants and values calculated using LDA for
selected h-MX2 and t-MX2 are presented in Table 25.2.

Conclusions
Theoretical studies outlined in this chapter predicted 79 new stable, SL honeycomb
structures of different elements with electronic and magnetic properties, which may be
utilized in the emerging ﬁeld of nanotechnology. Some of these theoretical predictions
have been realized by synthesizing novel SL materials, which are now subjects of active
research.
