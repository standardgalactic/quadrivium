Why a New Edition?
Dear Colleagues and Friends,
The pace of change in the financial statement auditing environment continues to accelerate, even as the need for relia­
bile, high-quality assurance over financial reporting continues to intensify. The auditing environment is far more com­
plex and dynamic today than it was even 10 years ago. Today, for example, financial statement auditors practice in a 
regulated environment and must deal with three sets of auditing standards: the standards of the PCAOB for audits of 
U.S. public companies, the standards of the AICPA’s Auditing Standards Board for audits of essentially all other U.S. 
entities (e.g., private companies, government entities, universities), and the standards of the IFAC’s International Audit­
ing and Assurance Standards Board for audits of entities based outside of the United States. And those standards have 
undergone change at an unprecedented pace, with few signs of slowing. It is difficult enough for us as professors to stay 
abreast of the unprecedented change and complexity in the auditing environment; it is simply unrealistic to expect our 
students to be able to grasp all of this while they are working diligently just to learn the fundamentals of financial state­
ment auditing.
That is why we have focused our efforts in this new edition to present the fundamentals of auditing in a crisp, clear, 
and understandable way, helping students navigate the inherent complexity while gaining a deep, intuitive grasp of 
fundamental auditing concepts. We do this by using simple yet compelling illustrations, examples, and analogies, such 
as relating the demand for an audit to the desire of a prospective home buyer to hire a house inspector. Our hope is that 
students will not only understand the important standards and concepts underlying auditing but that they will gain an 
intuitive grasp of why it is important and how the underlying logic can inform their judgments not only as auditors but 
as business people. In terms of the three sets of extant auditing standards, we simplify the complexities involved by 
adopting an approach similar to that taken by all of the major international accounting firms: we start with a base set of 
standards (in our case, the AICPA’s new body of “clarity” standards, which are at this point very similar to the IAASB 
standards) and we build on that base by addressing any requirements in the PCAOB standards that require more from 
the auditor. The AICPA’s clarity standards are newly converged with international auditing standards, which means 
that by studying this book your students will learn the auditing concepts that underlie an audit performed under any of 
the three extant sets of standards. All of the major firms have adopted a similar approach because it allows their pro­
fessionals to practice effectively in any environment, domestic or international, using a single, merged set of auditing 
standards, rather than having to learn the specifics of three different sets. Your students will have that same advantage 
in learning auditing from this book.
Although the auditing environment has become even more complex and demanding, at the same time it is increasingly 
important that students gain a deep understanding and working knowledge of fundamental auditing concepts and how 
they are applied. From the beginning we have worked hard to make this book the most up-to-date, “student-friendly” 
introductory auditing book on the market, and this new edition continues that effort. Some of the ways this book 
encourages your students (and ours) to think more clearly and deeply about what they are studying are by
	
1.	 Expanding the use of “stop and think” phrases at key places throughout the chapters to encourage students to 
more fully internalize key concepts and facilitate deep learning by your students.
	
2.	 Clarifying explanations and adding easy-to-understand examples throughout the book.

viii	
Why a New Edition?
	
3.	 Making several chapters more concise and enhancing the focus on key concepts by deleting noncentral detail.
	
4.	 Improving end-of-chapter and supplementary materials throughout the book and on the website.
	
5.	 Adding a “Professional Judgment” module to the print copy of the book to accelerate the development of pro­
fessional judgment abilities in your students. This module is based on the 2013 AAA Wildman Award winning 
KPMG Professional Judgment monograph, authored by Steve Glover and Doug Prawitt, in collaboration with 
KPMG leaders and partners.
	
6.	 New discussion cases added to Chapters 3 and 6 relating to the misappropriations of assets at Koss Corporation 
and Dixon, Illinois.
This new edition also contains several important updates including the introduction of industry leader IDEA® software 
by CaseWare Analytics. IDEA is a powerful and user-friendly data analysis tool designed to help auditors perform data 
analysis, audit sampling, and other audit procedures efficiently and effectively. Students are introduced to IDEA in the 
text and through hands-on tutorials, exercises, and problems. This edition also has been updated to reflect changes in 
auditing standards, such as the PCAOB’s Risk Assessment standards and the AICPA’s newly revised body of “clar­
ity” standards, including the “principles underlying an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards.” The book also reflects new developments in how auditors assess materiality, based on research into major 
firms’ materiality policies by Aasmund Eilifsen and Bill Messier, and includes insights into audit sampling in practice 
based on research co-authored by Steve Glover. This edition also includes coverage of the newly revised COSO Internal 
Control-Integrated Framework. Because of their increasing complexity and importance to the audit process, this edi­
tion also includes discussions of auditing the tax liability and auditing fair value measurements. The book also includes 
coverage of professionalism and ethics consistent with the AICPA’s newly reorganized Code of Professional Conduct. 
Finally, the authors took a hands-on role in improving this edition’s test bank, online quizzes, instructor PowerPoint 
slides, and the instructor’s manual.
While we are very much aware of the extra investment required when a book rolls to a new edition, we believe that we 
owe it to our colleagues and students to provide the most up-to-date materials possible so their hard work and energy in 
teaching and studying represents an investment in the latest, most current concepts, delivered in the most understand­
able way possible. We are confident that the changes made in this edition will make it easier for you to teach effectively 
and for your students to learn more efficiently and more deeply.
Thank you for your support of this text and the many compliments we have received regarding past editions. We are 
gratified by the enthusiastic response the text has received as we have done our best to create a clear, easy-reading, 
student-friendly auditing textbook. As always, we welcome your feedback and suggestions, and we hope you will be 
pleased with the updates we have made in this new edition.
With warm regards,
William F. Messier, Jr.            Steven M. Glover            Douglas F. Prawitt

Assurance of Learning Ready
Many educational institutions today are focused on the notion of assurance of learning, an important ele­
ment of some accreditation standards. The Messier, Glover, and Prawitt Auditing and Assurance Services: 
A Systematic Approach book is designed specifically to support your assurance of learning initiatives with a 
simple, yet powerful, solution.
Each chapter in the book begins with a list of numbered learning objectives, which appear throughout the 
chapter as well as in the end-of-chapter assignments. Each test bank question for Auditing and Assurance 
Services: A Systematic Approach maps to a specific chapter learning outcome/objective listed in the text. 
Each test bank question also identifies topic area, level of difficulty, Bloom’s Taxonomy level, AACSB and 
AICPA skill areas. You can use Connect to easily query for learning outcomes/objectives that directly relate 
to the learning objectives for your course.

The continuing rapid pace of change in auditing standards and practices, together with the recent crises in the financial 
markets, has had a significant effect on the auditing profession. In this ever-changing environment, it is crucial that stu­
dents learn from the most up-to-date, student-friendly resources. As always, the author team of Auditing & Assurance 
Services: A Systematic Approach is dedicated to providing the most current professional content and real-world applica­
tion, as well as helping students develop professional judgment and prepare for the CPA exam.
In their 10th edition, authors Messier, Glover, and Prawitt continue to reinforce the fundamental values central to their 
past nine editions:
Student Engagement.  The authors believe students are best served by acquiring a strong understanding of the basic 
concepts that underlie the audit process and how to apply those concepts to various audit and assurance services. The 
primary purpose for an auditing text is not to serve as a reference manual but to facilitate student learning, and this text is 
written accordingly. The text is accessible to students through straightforward writing and the use of engaging, relevant 
real-world examples, illustrations, and analogies. The text explicitly encourages students to think through fundamental 
concepts and to avoid trying to learn auditing through rote memorization. Students are prompted by the text to “stop and 
think” at important points in the text, in order to help them apply the principles covered. Consistent with this aim, the 
text’s early chapters avoid immersing students in unnecessary detail such as the minutia relating to all the complexities 
of audit reporting, focusing instead on students’ intuition relating to the fundamental audit concepts of materiality, audit 
risk, and audit evidence relating to management assertions. The first chapter provides a high-level introduction to what an 
audit report looks like while avoiding immersion in unnecessary detail. It also lays out a clear explanation and illustration 
of the demand for assurance and provides an understandable overview of the auditing process from start to finish. A case 
involving EarthWear Clothiers, a mail-order retailer, is integrated throughout the book and additional student resources and 
includes free student access to several useful hands-on mini-cases, with full solutions available to the instructor. Finally, 
“practice insights” throughout the book engage students and help them see the application of concepts in a practical setting.
A Systematic Approach.  The text continues to take a systematic approach to the audit process by first introducing 
the three underlying concepts: audit risk, materiality, and evidence. This is followed by a discussion of audit planning, 
the assessment of control risk, and a discussion of the nature, timing, and extent of evidence necessary to reach the 
appropriate level of detection risk. These concepts are then applied to each major business process and related account 
balances using a risk-based approach. The text has been revised to include the risk assessment process included in the 
standards adopted by the Auditing Standards Board and the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board, as 
well as the PCAOB’s newly adopted Risk Assessment Standards.
Decision Making.  In covering these important concepts and their applications, the book focuses on critical judg­
ments and decision-making processes followed by auditors. Much of auditing practice involves the application of auditor 
judgment. If a student understands these basic concepts and how to apply them to an audit engagement, he or she will be 
more effective in today’s dynamic audit environment. Two of the authors of this textbook recently worked with KPMG to 
develop a monograph designed to accelerate the development of professional judgment in students. We are very excited 
to include in this edition a “professional judgment” module as part of the printed material in the text. This module is 
based on the KPMG Professional Judgment monograph, which was awarded the 2013 AAA Deloitte/Wildman award for 
the work published within the most recent five-year period that has had the most significant impact on the practice of 
professional accountancy. Access to additional directly related resources, including videos, mini-cases, and problems, are 
available on KPMG’s University Connection website for integration into the auditing course, as instructors see fit.

Practice  
INSIGHT
At the heart of a capital-market economy is the flow of reliable information, which investors, credi-
tors, and regulators use to make informed decisions. Chief Justice Warren Burger gave his view of 
the significance of the audit function in a 1984 Supreme Court decision:
By certifying the public reports that collectively depict a corporation’s financial status, the indepen-
dent auditor assumes a public responsibility transcending any employment relationship with the cli-
ent. The independent public accountant performing this special function owes ultimate allegiance to 
the corporation’s creditors and stockholders, as well as to the investing public.
More than 30 years later, the message is the same—users of financial statements rely on the external 
auditor to act with honor and integrity in protecting the public interest.

An Introduction to Assurance 
and Financial Statement Auditing
Y
ou will learn in this chapter that auditing consists of a set of practical 
conceptual tools that help accounting professionals to find, organize, 
and evaluate evidence about the assertions of another party. The 
demand for capable accountants and auditors of high integrity has never been 
greater. Opportunities for auditors are plentiful and rewarding and can lead to 
attractive career opportunities in other areas. Those who practice as auditors 
often later go into financial management, becoming controllers, chief financial 
officers (CFOs), and even chief executive officers (CEOs). But even those who 
do not plan to become an auditor can benefit greatly from an understanding of 
financial statement auditing and its underlying concepts. Learning these tools 
is valuable to any business decision maker.
The past decade has been challenging for the auditing profession. In the 
early 2000s, a series of high-profile accounting frauds began to cause inves­
tors to doubt the integrity of the nation’s financial reporting system, includ­
ing the role of the external auditor. To restore investor confidence, Congress 
passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor 
Protection Act in July 2002—the most significant legislation related to finan­
cial statement audits of public companies since the Securities Acts of 1933 and 
1934. The implications of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are discussed throughout 
the text in appropriate places. While the public scrutiny, government reforms, 
and establishment of a regulated process for creating auditing standards for 
public companies have been challenging for accountants and auditors, the 
events of the last several years have also served as powerful reminders of just 
how critical the roles of accounting and auditing are in our society.
We live in a time when the amount of information available for decision 
makers via electronic databases, the Internet, and other sources is rapidly 
expanding, and there is a great need for the information to be reliable, cred­
ible, relevant, and timely. High-quality information is necessary if managers, 
investors, creditors, and regulatory agencies are to make informed decisions. 
Auditing and assurance services play an important role in ensuring the reliabil­
ity, credibility, and relevance of business information.
The following examples present situations that illustrate how auditing 
increases the reliability and credibility of an entity’s financial statements:
Sara Thompson, a local community activist, has been operating a not-for-profit center that 
provides assistance to abused women and their children. She has financed most of her 
operations from private contributions. Ms. Thompson applied to the State Health and Human 
Services Department requesting a large grant to expand her two shelters to accommodate 
more women. In completing the grant application, Ms. Thompson discovered that the state’s 
laws for government grants require that recipients be audited to ensure that existing funds 
are being used appropriately. Ms. Thompson hired a CPA to audit the center’s financial state­
ments. Based on the center’s activities, the intended use of the funds, and the auditor’s clean 
report, the grant was approved.
Conway Computer Company is a wholesaler of computer products. The company was 
started by George and Jimmy Steinbuker five years ago. Two years ago, a venture capital 

Tips for Learning Auditing
You will find that the study of auditing is different from any of the other accounting courses 
you have taken in college, and for good reason. Most accounting courses focus on learning 
the rules, techniques, and computations required to prepare and analyze financial information. 
Auditing, on the other hand, focuses on learning the analytical and logical skills necessary 
to evaluate the relevance and reliability of financial information as well as of the systems 
and processes responsible for recording and summarizing that information. As such, you will 
find the study of auditing to be much more conceptual in nature than your other accounting 
courses. This is simply due to the nature of auditing. Thus, we will periodically prompt you 
to “stop and think” about the concepts being discussed throughout the book. Seeking to thor-
oughly understand and apply principles as you read them will greatly improve your success 
in studying auditing.
Learning auditing essentially helps you understand how to gather and assess evidence 
so you can evaluate assertions (or claims) made by others. This text is filled with the tools 
and techniques used by financial statement auditors in practice. You’ll find that the “tool kit” 
used by auditors consists of a coherent, logical framework, together with techniques useful 
for analyzing financial data and gathering evidence about others’ assertions. Acquiring this 
conceptual tool kit can be valuable in a variety of settings, including practicing as an auditor, 
running a small business, providing consulting services, and even making executive busi-
ness decisions. An important implication is that learning this framework makes the study of

firm acquired 40 percent of the company and thus provided capital for expansion. Conway Computer’s 
revenues and profits increased by 25 percent in each of the last two years, and the Steinbuker brothers and 
the venture capital firm decided to take the company public through a stock sale. However, they knew that 
the company’s financial statements needed to be audited by a reputable public accounting firm before a 
registration statement could be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in order for inves-
tors to trust the stock offering. The company hired a major public accounting firm to perform its audits and 
the company successfully sold stock to the public.
These situations show the importance of auditing to both private and public enter-
prise. By adding an audit to each situation, the users of the financial statements have addi-
tional assurance that the financial statements report honestly and accurately, and they will 
be more willing to rely on those statements. Auditors can also provide valuable assurance 
for operating information, information systems reliability and security, and the effective-
ness of an entity’s internal control. Consider the following example:
EarthWear Clothiers is a successful mail-order retailer of high-quality clothing for outdoor sports. 
Over the last few years the company has expanded sales through its Internet site. EarthWear’s 
common stock is listed and traded on NASDAQ. Securities laws require company officials to cer-
tify that they have properly designed, implemented, and tested internal control over their accounting and 
reporting information systems. EarthWear’s public accounting firm, Willis & Adams, examines the design 
and documentation of EarthWear’s internal control on a yearly basis and conducts independent tests to ver-
ify that EarthWear’s controls are operating effectively. Willis & Adams issues a report to the public express-
ing its opinion as to whether EarthWear’s internal control is well designed and operating effectively. Thus, 
stockholders, creditors, and other stakeholders can have greater confidence in the financial reports issued 
by EarthWear’s management.
Most readers of an introductory auditing text initially have little understanding of what 
auditing and assurance services entail. Thus, we start by helping you understand in gen-
eral terms why there is a demand for auditing and assurance services. We then compare 
auditing to other well-known forms of assurance to provide an intuitive understanding of 
the economic role auditing plays. Finally, we define auditing, attestation, and assurance 
services and give you an overview of the financial statement auditing process.

auditing valuable to you as a future accountant or business decision maker, whether or not you 
plan to become a financial statement auditor.
While the concepts and techniques you will learn in this book will be useful to you 
regardless of your career path, our experience is that students frequently fall into the trap of 
defining auditing in terms of memorized lists of rules, tools, and techniques. The study of 
auditing and the related concepts and techniques will make a lot more sense if you build your 
intuition of why audits are needed, if you understand the necessary characteristics of audits 
and auditors, and if you focus on what an auditor does, and why. Don’t fall into the trap of 
attempting to study auditing through rote memorization! Instead, pause frequently to be sure 
you understand both “what?” and “why?” as you study the concepts and techniques of audit­
ing, as well as “how” auditing is carried out.
As you saw in the introduction to this chapter, reliable information is important for man­
agers, investors, creditors, and regulatory agencies to make informed decisions. Auditing 
helps ensure that information is reliable, credible, and relevant. In fact, the assurance provided 
by auditing is vital to the proper functioning of our economic system!
The Demand for Auditing and Assurance
In view of the fact that many of the largest companies spend millions of dollars each year 
for their annual audit, it is worth asking why an entity would decide to spend so much 
money on an audit?1 Some might answer that audits are required by law. While true in cer­
tain circumstances, this answer is far too simplistic. Audits are often utilized in situations 
where they are not required by law, and audits were in demand long before securities laws 
required them. In fact, evidence shows that some forms of accounting and auditing existed in 
Greece as early as 500 BC.2 However, the development of the corporate form of business and 
the expanding world economy over the last 200 years have given rise to an explosion in the 
demand for the assurance provided by auditors. In 1926, several years prior to the Securities 
Acts of 1933 and 1934, which required audits for publicly traded companies in the United 
States, 82 percent of the companies on the New York Stock Exchange were audited by inde­
pendent auditors.3
Principals and Agents
The demand for auditing can be understood as the need for accountability when business 
owners hire others to manage their businesses, as is typical in modern corporations. Until the 
late 18th and early 19th centuries, most organizations were relatively small and were owned 
and operated as sole proprietorships or partnerships. Because businesses were generally run 
by their owners and borrowing was limited, accountability to outside parties often was mini­
mal. The birth of modern accounting and auditing occurred during the industrial revolution, 
when companies became larger and needed to raise capital to finance expansion.4 Over time, 
capital markets developed, enabling companies to raise the investment capital necessary to 
expand to new markets, finance expensive research and development, and fund the buildings, 
technology, and equipment needed to deliver products to market. A capital market allows a 
public company to sell small pieces of ownership (i.e., stocks) or to borrow money in the form

auditing in the United States.

of thousands of small loans (i.e., bonds) so that vast amounts of capital can be raised from a 
wide variety of investors and creditors. A public company is a company that sells its stocks 
or bonds to the public, giving the public a valid interest in the proper use of the company’s 
resources. Thus, the growth of the modern corporation led to diverse groups of owners who 
are not directly involved in running the business (stockholders) and the use of professional 
managers hired by the owners to run the corporation on a day-to-day basis. In this setting, the 
managers serve as agents for the owners (who are sometimes referred to as principals) and 
fulfill a stewardship function by managing the corporation’s assets.
Accounting and auditing play important roles in this principal–agent relationship. We 
first explain the roles of accounting and auditing from a conceptual perspective. Then we’ll 
use an analogy involving a house inspector to illustrate the concepts. First, it is important to 
understand that the relationship between an owner and manager often results in information 
asymmetry between the two parties. Information asymmetry means that the manager gener­
ally has more information about the “true” financial position and results of operations of the 
entity than does the absentee owner.
Stop and Think: What negative consequences could information asymmetry have for 
the absentee owner? How do the perspectives and motives of the manager and absentee 
owner differ?
Because their goals may not coincide, there is a natural conflict of interest between the 
manager and the absentee owner. If both parties seek to maximize their self-interest, the man­
ager may not always act in the best interests of the owner. For example, the risk exists that a 
manager may follow the example of Tyco Inc.’s former CEO Dennis Kozlowski, who spent 
Tyco funds on excessive personal benefits such as $6,000 shower curtains, or Andrew Fastow, 
the former CFO of Enron, who pleaded guilty to manipulating the reported earnings of Enron 
in order to inflate the price of the company’s stock so that he could earn larger bonuses and 
sell his stock holdings at artificially high prices. The owner can attempt to protect him or her­
self against the possibility of improper use of resources by reducing the manager’s compensa­
tion by the amount of company resources that the owner expects the manager to consume. But 
rather than accept reduced compensation, the manager may agree to some type of monitoring 
provisions in his or her employment contract, providing assurance to the owner that he or 
she will not misuse resources. For example, the two parties may agree that the manager will 
periodically report on how well he or she has managed the owner’s assets. Of course, a set 
of criteria is needed to govern the form and content of the manager’s reports. In other words, 
the reporting of this financial information to the owner must follow some set of agreed-upon 
principles in holding the manager accountable. As you can see, one primary role of account­
ing information is to hold the manager accountable to the owner—hence the word accounting.
The Role of Auditing
Of course, reporting in accordance with an agreed-upon set of accounting principles doesn’t 
solve the problem by itself. Because the manager is responsible for reporting on the results of 
his or her own actions, which the absentee owner cannot directly observe, the manager is in 
a position to manipulate the reports. Again, the owner adjusts for this possibility by assum­
ing that the manager will manipulate the reports to his or her benefit and by reducing the 
manager’s compensation accordingly. It is at this point that the demand for auditing arises. If 
the manager is honest, it may very well be in the manager’s self-interest to hire an auditor to 
monitor and report to the owner on his or her activities. The owner likely will be willing to 
invest more in the business and to pay the manager more if the manager can be held account­
able for how he or she uses the owner’s invested resources. As the amount of capital involved 
and the number of potential owners increase, the potential impact of accountability also 
increases. The auditor’s role is to determine whether the reports prepared by the manager con­
form to the contract’s provisions. Thus, the auditor’s verification of the financial information

adds credibility to the report and reduces information risk, or the risk that information cir­
culated by a company’s management will be false or misleading. Reducing information risk 
potentially benefits both the owner and the manager. Figure 1–1 provides an overview of this 
agency relationship.
While the setting we’ve outlined is very simple, understanding the basics of the owner–
manager relationship is helpful in understanding the demand for auditing. The principal–
agent model is a powerful conceptual tool that can be extrapolated to much more complex 
employment and other contractual arrangements. For example, how can a lender prevent 
management from taking the borrowed funds and using them inappropriately? One way is to 
place restrictive covenants in the debt agreement with which the entity and its management 
must comply. Again, this arrangement gives rise to a demand for the auditing of information 
reported by management to the lender.

INSIGHT
At the heart of a capital-market economy is the flow of reliable information, which investors, credi­
tors, and regulators use to make informed decisions. Chief Justice Warren Burger gave his view of 
the significance of the audit function in a 1984 Supreme Court decision:
By certifying the public reports that collectively depict a corporation’s financial status, the indepen­
dent auditor assumes a public responsibility transcending any employment relationship with the cli­
ent. The independent public accountant performing this special function owes ultimate allegiance to 
the corporation’s creditors and stockholders, as well as to the investing public.
More than 30 years later, the message is the same—users of financial statements rely on the external 
auditor to act with honor and integrity in protecting the public interest.

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
In summary, auditing is demanded because it plays a valuable role in monitoring the 
contractual relationships between the entity and its stockholders, managers, employees, and 
debt holders. Certified public accountants have been charged with providing audit services 
because of their traditional reputation of competence, independence, objectivity, and concern 
for the public interest. As a result, they are able to add credibility to information produced 
and reported by management to outside parties. The role of the Certified Public Accountant is 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 2.
Before we discuss financial statement auditors further, let’s illustrate the concepts we’ve just 
covered using an analogy: buying a home. In the purchase of an existing house, informa­
tion asymmetry usually is present because the seller typically has more information about the 
house than does the buyer. There is also a natural conflict of interest between the buyer and 
the seller. Sellers generally prefer a higher selling price and may be motivated to overstate the 
positive characteristics and understate or remain silent about the negative characteristics of 
the property they have for sale. In other words, there is information risk to the buyer.
Seller Assertions, Information Asymmetry, 
and Inspector Characteristics
To support the asking price, sellers typically make assertions about their property. For 
instance, the seller of an older home might declare that the roof doesn’t leak, that the founda­
tion is sound, that there is no rot or pest damage, and that the plumbing and electrical systems 
are in good working order. Fortunately, many sellers are honest and forthcoming, but this is 
not always the case. The problem is that the buyer often does not know if she or he is dealing 
with an honest seller or if the seller has the necessary expertise to evaluate all the structural 
or mechanical aspects of the property. Lacking the necessary expertise to validate the seller’s 
assertions, the buyer can logically reduce information risk by hiring a house inspector.
Stop and Think: Imagine for a moment that you are buying a house and are wisely 
considering hiring an inspector. Test your intuition—what characteristics would you 
like your inspector to possess?
Desired Characteristics of the House Inspection Service
Now that you have identified some of the characteristics of a good inspector, which likely 
included competence, honesty, and objectivity, consider the key characteristics of the service 
he or she will provide. Are some of the seller’s assertions more important than others? For 
instance, you are probably not equally concerned with the assertions that there is no structural 
rot and that the lightbulbs in the master bathroom are working. Depending on what you are 
willing to pay, the inspection could theoretically range from the extremes of driving past 
the house to taking the home entirely apart, board by board. How thorough do you want the 
inspector to be? Do you want the inspector to issue a “pass-fail” grade based on a quick walk-
through or would you like more details, such as careful examination of the furnace and air 
conditioner? As you can see, there are many factors to take into account in deciding on the 
nature and extent of the assurance service you want to buy. In Table 1–1 we have listed what 
we think are desirable characteristics of a house inspector and of the service provided by an 
inspector. Pause for a moment to compare your thinking with ours.
The concepts contained in Table 1–1 are in fact fundamental to most forms of inspec­
tion (including financial statement audits). Certainly home inspections and other assurance

services must focus on the assertions that are most important, and they must be conducted in 
a timely and cost-effective manner. Some assertions are more important than others because 
of their potential risk or cost. For example, a house inspector should recognize the signs that 
indicate an increased risk of a leaky roof. If those signs are present, he or she should investi­
gate further, because damage caused by a leaky roof can be very expensive to repair. At the 
same time, just because the seller asserts that he or she recently lubricated all the door and 
window hinges doesn’t mean it would be wise to pay the inspector to validate this assertion.
Stop and Think: How might a house inspection be similar to a financial statement audit?
Relating the House Inspection Analogy to Financial 
Statement Auditing
Now that we have discussed some of the basic characteristics of house inspectors and their 
services, let’s consider how these relate to financial statement auditors. As noted previously, 
the demand for the assurance provided by a house inspector comes from information asym­
metry and conflicts of interest between the buyer and the seller. Information asymmetry and 
conflicts of interest also exist between managers of companies and potential investors. For 
example, if managers are overly optimistic or if they wish to inflate their bonus compensa­
tion, they may unintentionally or intentionally overstate the company’s earnings and assets 
(e.g., by understating the allowance for doubtful accounts or by claiming to have more cash 
than they really have). One important difference between our house inspector example and 
financial statement auditing is that the buyer of a home typically hires the inspector. In other 
words, the buyer identifies and hires the inspector rather than hiring someone that the seller 
­recommends—presumably because by hiring an inspector directly, they increase the likeli­
hood that the inspector will be objective and independent.
However, as was discussed previously, the companies selling stocks or bonds to the pub­
lic typically hire and pay the auditor, rather than the other way around. To raise capital in the 
marketplace, companies often sell many small parcels of stocks and bonds to a large number 
of investors. Suppose a financial statement audit of a given company would cost $500,000. 
Under such circumstances, it obviously doesn’t make sense for each individual investor to pay 
for an audit. Instead, the company hires and pays for the auditor because a reputable indepen­
dent auditor’s opinion can provide assurance to thousands of potential investors. In addition, 
recall from our previous discussion that the initial demand for auditing comes not from the 
principal but from the agent. By purchasing the assurance provided by an audit, the company 
can sell its stocks and bonds to prospective owners and creditors at more favorable prices, 
Important Characteristics of House Inspectors and Inspections
Desirable Characteristics of House Inspectors
 • Competent—they possess the required training, expertise, and experience to evaluate the property for sale.
 • Objective—they have no reason to side with the seller; they are independent of the seller’s influence.
 • Honest—they will conduct themselves with integrity, and they will share all of their findings with the buyer.
 • Skeptical—they will not simply take the seller’s assertions at face value; they will conduct their own analysis and testing.
 • Responsible and/or liable—they should stand behind their assessment with a guarantee and/or be subject to litigation if they fail to act with due care.
Desirable Characteristics of a House Inspection Service
 • Timely—the results of the service are reported in time to benefit the decision maker.
 • Reasonably priced—the costs of the services must not exceed the benefits. For this to occur the service provider will likely need to focus attention on 
the most important and risky assertions and likely can’t provide absolute assurance, even with respect to important seller assertions.
 • Complete—the service addresses all of the most important and risky assertions made by the seller.
 • Effective—the service provides some degree of certainty that it will uncover significant risks or problems.
 • Systematic and reliable—the service is based on a systematic process, and the conclusions are based on reliable evidence. In other words, another 
comparable inspector would likely find similar issues and come to similar conclusions.
 • Informative—the service provides a sense for how likely mechanical or structural failure is in the near future and provides an estimate of the cost to 
repair known defects or failures.

significantly reducing the cost of capital. In fact, studies indicate that audits save companies 
billions of dollars in costs of obtaining capital; for example, by getting lower interest rates on 
loans and selling stock at higher prices.
Given that the seller of stocks and bonds typically hires the auditor, consider just how 
crucial a strong reputation is to an independent auditor. Four large, international accounting 
firms dominate the audits of large publicly traded companies, auditing over 95 percent of the 
revenue produced by all such companies in the United States. One reason these firms domi­
nate the audits of large companies is because they have well-known names and strong reputa­
tions. Entities who buy assurance from these firms know that potential investors and creditors 
will recognize the auditing firm’s name and reputation and feel assured that they therefore 
face reduced information risk.
The fact that the entity being audited typically hires and pays the auditor also highlights 
just how important auditor objectivity and independence are to the investing public. In fact, 
Arthur Andersen, the once highly regarded member of the former “Big 5” international 
accounting firms, failed in 2002 at least in part because the firm lost its reputation as a high-
quality, objective auditor whose opinion could be relied upon by investors and creditors. Later 
in the book we will discuss some changes enacted over the past several years to strengthen the 
independence of financial statement auditors, including prohibiting auditors from providing 
many kinds of consulting services to their public audit clients.
Management Assertions and Financial Statements
We’ve seen that home sellers make a number of different assertions about which a home 
buyer might want independent assurance. What assertions does a company that is selling its 
stocks or bonds make? Some of the most important assertions entities make to investors are 
implicit in the entities’ financial statements. Immediately after this chapter you will find a 
set of financial statements for EarthWear, a hypothetical seller of high-quality outdoor cloth­
ing. We’ll use EarthWear examples and exercises throughout the book to illustrate important 
audit concepts and techniques. Let’s consider what assertions EarthWear makes to potential 
investors when it publishes its financial statements. For example, EarthWear lists the asset 
account “Cash” on its balance sheet and indicates that the account’s year-end balance was 
$48.9 million.
Stop and Think: Consider for a moment what assertions the company is making 
about cash.
An obvious answer is that EarthWear’s management is asserting that the cash is really 
there—that it “exists.” They are also implicitly asserting that all the cash that the company 
owns is included in the records—in other words, the financial records are “complete” with 
respect to the company’s cash. Finally, management is asserting that the cash amount is fairly 
and accurately recorded, and that no other parties have valid claims to the cash. Such asser­
tions are implicit for each account in the financial statements.
Financial statement assertions are management’s expressed or implied claims about 
information reflected in the financial statements. Assertions are central to auditing because 
they are the focus of the auditor’s evidence collection efforts. In other words, much of what 
auditors do revolves around collecting and evaluating evidence about management’s financial 
statement assertions.
One of the main tasks of the auditor is to collect sufficient appropriate evidence that 
management’s assertions regarding the financial statements are correct. If you were to audit 
EarthWear, how would you go about collecting evidence for the cash account? The process is 
really quite logical and intuitive. First, you would carefully consider the most important asser­
tions the company is making about the account, and then you would decide what evidence 
you would need to substantiate the truthfulness of each important assertion. For example, 
to ensure the cash exists, you might examine bank statements or send a letter to the bank 

	
Chapter 1    An Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing	
11
requesting confirmation of the balance. To ensure the cash hasn’t been pledged or restricted, 
you might review the minutes of key management meetings to look for discussions or agree­
ments on this issue.
We will discuss management assertions in greater depth in Chapter 5, but for now take 
a look at Table 1–2, which lists all of the management assertions that auditors focus on in 
an audit. This presentation divides management assertions into three aspects of information 
reflected in the financial statements: transactions, account balances, and presentation and dis­
closure. For example, EarthWear’s management asserts, among other things, that ­transactions 
relating to inventory actually occurred, that they are complete (i.e., no valid transactions were 
left out), that they are classified properly (e.g., as an asset rather than an expense), and that 
they are recorded accurately and in the correct period. Similarly, management asserts that the 
inventory represented in the inventory account balance exists, that the entity owns the inven­
tory, that the balance is complete, and that the inventory is properly valued. Finally, manage­
ment asserts that the financial statements properly present the inventory (e.g., inventory is 
appropriately listed as a current asset on the balance sheet) and that all required disclosures 
having to do with inventory (e.g., a footnote indicating that the company uses the FIFO 
inventory method) are complete, accurate, and understandable. Understanding the assertions 
in terms of transactions, account balances, and presentation and disclosure is helpful because 
the three categories help the auditor focus on the different types of audit procedures needed 
to test the assertions in the three different categories. Chapter 5 discusses the types of proce­
dures available to the auditor in more detail.
Once you have finished auditing the important assertions relating to each account 
included in the company’s financial statements, you will need to report your findings to the 
company’s shareholders and to the investing public because EarthWear is publicly traded.
Now, instead of EarthWear’s auditor, imagine you are a prospective investor in Earth­
Wear. As an investor, would the reputation of the company’s auditor matter to you? Would 
you want to know that the audit firm used an appropriate, well-recognized audit approach to 
gather sufficient, appropriate evidence? What form of report would you expect? What if the 
lead partner on the audit were a close relative of EarthWear’s president? Considering these 
questions makes it easy to see that the desired characteristics of auditors and audit services 
are similar to those relating to house inspectors and house inspection services.
Summary of Management Assertions by Category
Assertions about classes of transactions and events for the period under audit:
	•	 Occurrence—transactions and events that have been recorded have occurred and pertain to the entity.
	•	 Completeness—all transactions and events that should have been recorded have been recorded.
	•	 Authorization—all transactions and events have been properly authorized.*
	•	 Accuracy—amounts and other data relating to recorded transactions and events have been recorded appropriately.
	•	 Cutoff—transactions and events have been recorded in the correct accounting period.
	•	 Classification—transactions and events have been recorded in the proper accounts.
Assertions about account balances at the period end:
	•	 Existence—assets, liabilities, and equity interests exist.
	•	 Rights and obligations—the entity holds or controls the rights to assets, and liabilities are the obligations of 
the entity.
	•	 Completeness—all assets, liabilities, and equity interests that should have been recorded have been recorded.
	•	 Valuation and allocation—assets, liabilities, and equity interests are included in the financial statements at 
appropriate amounts and any resulting valuation or allocation adjustments are appropriately recorded.
Assertions about presentation and disclosure:
	•	 Occurrence and rights and obligations—disclosed events, transactions, and other matters have occurred and 
pertain to the entity.
	•	 Completeness—all disclosures that should have been included in the financial statements have been included.
	•	 Classification and understandability—financial information is appropriately presented and described, and 
disclosures are clearly expressed.
	•	 Accuracy and valuation—financial and other information are disclosed fairly and at appropriate amounts.
*International and AICPA auditing standards consider Authorization to be a subset of the Occurrence assertion and thus do not list it 
separately. We list Authorization as a separate assertion about classes of transactions and events for instructional clarity.

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
We hope the analogy of house inspectors and auditors as assurance providers has helped 
you understand the basic intuition behind the necessary characteristics of auditors and audit­
ing and why auditing is in demand, even when it is not required by law. We will refer back to 
this analogy occasionally throughout the book to remind you of this basic intuition. As you 
study this book, we encourage you to keep in mind how the concepts you are learning relate 
to important characteristics of auditors and home inspectors and the services they offer. Keep 
the big picture in mind!
Auditing, Attest, and Assurance Services Defined
Accounting professionals can provide assurance about the reliability and relevance of infor­
mation given by one party to another. The broadest category of such services is simply called 
assurance services. Attest services are a subset of assurance services, and auditing is a type of 
attest service. Many times these terms are used interchangeably because they are related, and 
at a general level, they encompass the same process: the evaluation of evidence to determine 
whether information has been recorded and presented in accordance with a predetermined set 
of criteria, together with the issuance of a report that indicates the degree of correspondence.
Figure 1–2 illustrates the concept that attest services are a subset of the broader category 
of assurance services, and, in turn, auditing services are a specialized type of attest service. 
We’ll discuss each category in turn, from narrowest to broadest.
Auditing
Consider the following formal definition of auditing:
Auditing is a systematic process of objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence regarding asser­
tions about economic actions and events to ascertain the degree of correspondence between those 
assertions and established criteria and communicating the results to interested users.5
Let’s discuss this definition in plain English. The phrase “systematic process” implies 
that there should be a well-planned and thorough approach for conducting an audit. This 
approach involves “objectively obtaining and evaluating evidence.” In other words, the audi­
tor must objectively search for and evaluate the relevance and validity of evidence. The type, 
quantity, and reliability of evidence will vary between audits, but the process of obtaining and 
evaluating evidence makes up most of the auditor’s activities on any audit.
As our analogy between house inspection and auditing illustrates, the evidence gath­
ered by the auditor must relate to “assertions about economic actions and events.” The audi­
tor compares the evidence gathered to management’s financial statement assertions in order 
to assess “the degree of correspondence between those assertions and established criteria.”

While different types of “criteria” might be available in various settings, generally accepted 
accounting principles usually serve as the basis for evaluating management’s assertions in the 
context of a financial statement audit.
The last key phrase in the definition, “communicating the results to interested users,” 
relates to the report the auditor provides to the intended users of the reported information. The 
communication will vary depending on the type and purpose of the audit, and the nature of 
the auditor’s findings. In the case of financial statement audits, very specific types of reports 
are prescribed by auditing standards to communicate the auditor’s findings. We will show you 
what an audit report relating to financial statements looks like later in this chapter.
Attestation
Auditors have a reputation for independence and objectivity. As a result, it has always been 
common for various parties to request that auditors attest to information beyond historical 
financial information. However, professional standards did not allow for such services until 
the profession established a separate set of attestation standards in 1986. These standards pro­
vide the following definition for attest services:
Attest services occur when a practitioner is engaged to issue . . . a report on subject matter, or an 
assertion about subject matter, that is the responsibility of another party.
Notice that this definition is broader than the one previously discussed for auditing 
because it is not limited to economic events or actions. The subject matter of attest services 
can take many forms, including prospective information, analyses, systems and processes, 
and even the specific actions of specified parties. Note that financial statement auditing is a 
particular, specialized form of an attest service.
Assurance
In the late 1990s, the accounting profession expanded the potential breadth of auditors’ activi­
ties beyond auditing and attest services to include a broader set of assurance services. Extend­
ing auditors’ activities to assurance services allows reporting not only on the reliability and 
credibility of information but also on the relevance and timeliness of that information. Assur­
ance services are defined as follows:
Assurance services are independent professional services that improve the quality of information, 
or its context, for decision makers.
This definition captures some important concepts. First, the definition focuses on 
­decision making. Making good decisions requires quality information, which, in the context 
of the broad set of assurances services, can be financial or nonfinancial. Second, it relates 
to improving the quality of information or its context. An assurance service engagement can 
improve quality through increasing confidence in the information’s reliability and relevance. 
Context can be improved by clarifying the format and background with which the information 
is presented. Third, the definition includes “independence,” which relates to the objectiv­
ity of the service provider. Last, the definition includes the phrase “professional services,” 
which implies the application of professional judgment and due care by the provider. To sum­
marize, assurance services can include almost any service provided by accounting profession­
als that involves capturing information, improving its quality, or enhancing its usefulness for 
decision makers.
This text focuses primarily on financial statement auditing because it represents the 
major type of assurance service offered by most public accounting firms. In addition, in many 
instances, the approach, concepts, methods, and techniques used for financial statement audits 
also apply to other attest and assurance service engagements. While this text focuses primarily 
on financial statement auditing, Chapters 2 and 21 describe various examples of audit, attest, 
and assurance services commonly offered by different kinds of auditors, including internal 
auditors who are often directly employed by the company for which they provide services.

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
Figure 1–3 presents a simplified overview of the process for a financial statement audit. Take 
a moment to think through the steps in this figure. The auditor gathers evidence about the 
business transactions that have occurred and about the account balances into which the trans­
actions have been accumulated. The auditor uses this evidence to compare the assertions con­
tained in the financial statements to the criteria used by management in preparing them (i.e., 
GAAP). The auditor’s report communicates to the user the degree of correspondence between 
the assertions and the criteria. Be sure you understand Figure 1–3 before you continue read­
ing! Taking a moment to think through these concepts will help you make sense of the three 
fundamental concepts underlying a financial statement audit, which we will explain next.
The conceptual and procedural details of a financial statement audit build on three fun­
damental concepts: materiality, audit risk, and evidence relating to management’s financial 
statement assertions. The auditor’s assessments of audit risk and materiality influence the 
nature, timing, and extent of the audit evidence to be gathered. This section briefly discusses 
the concepts of materiality, audit risk, and audit evidence. Chapters 3 through 5 cover each 
of these concepts in greater depth, but your study of those chapters will be easier and more 
effective if you take the time now to understand the concepts of materiality, audit risk, and 
audit evidence at a general level.
Materiality
Materiality refers to the amount by which a set of financial statements could be misstated 
without affecting the judgment of reasonable people. For example, suppose a company’s 
earnings per share (EPS) is $4.50 but due to an unintentional error the company mistakenly

reports EPS of $4.52. This very small difference is unlikely to affect an investor’s decisions 
in any significant way. Thus, the auditor will likely consider the difference to be immaterial.
One of the auditor’s first tasks in planning an audit is to make a judgment about just how 
big a misstatement would have to be before it would significantly affect users’ judgments. 
The concept of materiality is important because it simply isn’t practical or cost beneficial for 
auditors to ensure that financial statements are completely free of any small misstatements.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has provided the following definition of 
materiality:
Information is material if omitting it or misstating it could influence decisions that users make on 
the basis of the financial information of a specific reporting entity.6
The focus of this definition is on the users of the financial statements. In planning the 
engagement, the auditor assesses the magnitude of a misstatement that may affect users’ deci­
sions. This materiality assessment helps the auditor determine the nature, timing, and extent 
of audit procedures used to collect audit evidence. Let’s relate the concept of materiality to 
our house inspector analogy—we would not be willing to pay a house inspector to validate 
the remaining life on lightbulbs or thoroughly test every cabinet hinge. These items are not 
material to the buyer’s decision.
While other factors must be considered in determining materiality, a common rule of 
thumb is that total (aggregated) misstatements of more than about 3 to 5 percent of income 
before tax would cause the financial statements to be materially misstated. Suppose the audi­
tor decides that the financial statements of a client with $8 million in net income would be 
materially misstated if total misstatements exceed 5 percent of income, or $400,000. The 
auditor would design audit procedures precise enough to detect misstatements that, either by 
themselves or in combination with other misstatements, might exceed the materiality thresh­
old of $400,000. When testing is complete for all accounts, the auditor will evaluate the audit 
results and ask the company to adjust its financial records for identified misstatements. The 
auditor will issue a clean audit opinion if the auditor’s estimate of remaining, unadjusted mis­
statements in all the accounts add up to less than overall materiality of $400,000. This is why 
the wording of the standard auditor’s report indicates that the financial statements “present 
fairly in all material respects . . .” As we will explain next, in connection with the concept of 
audit risk, there can be no guarantee that the auditor will uncover all material misstatements. 
In fact, the auditor provides no assurance that immaterial misstatements will be detected.
Audit Risk
The second major concept involved in auditing is audit risk, which is the risk that the auditor 
may mistakenly give a “clean” opinion on financial statements that are materially misstated.
Audit risk is the risk that the auditor mistakenly expresses a clean audit opinion when the financial 
statements are materially misstated.7
The auditor’s standard report states that the audit provides “reasonable assurance” 
that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements. The phrase “reasonable 
­assurance” implies that even when the auditor does a good job, there is some risk that a mate­
rial misstatement could be present in the financial statements and the auditor will fail to detect 
it. The auditor plans and conducts the audit to achieve an acceptably low level of audit risk. The 
auditor controls the level of audit risk through the effectiveness and extent of the audit work 
conducted. The more effective and extensive the audit work (and thus the type and amount 
of audit evidence collected), the lower the risk that a misstatement will go undetected and 
that the auditor will issue an inappropriate report. But it is important to understand that the 
concept of reasonable assurance means that an auditor could conduct an audit completely in 
accordance with professional auditing standards and fail to detect material misstatements. A

house inspector cannot absolutely guarantee the absence of any significant problems without 
taking apart a house board by board, which of course is simply not practical. Similarly, due to 
cost constraints and the sheer impossibility of investigating every item reflected in an entity’s 
financial statements, the risk that an auditor will mistakenly issue a clean opinion on materially 
misstated financial statements should be low, but it cannot be driven to zero. Even careful and 
competent auditors can only offer reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance.
Audit Evidence Regarding Management Assertions
The third major concept involved in auditing is evidence regarding management’s assertions, 
or, more simply, audit evidence. Most of the auditor’s work in arriving at an opinion on the 
financial statements consists of obtaining and evaluating audit evidence relating to manage­
ment’s assertions. Audit evidence consists of the underlying accounting data and any addi­
tional information available to the auditor, whether originating from the client or externally.
As illustrated earlier in our discussion about EarthWear, management’s assertions are 
used as a framework to guide the collection of audit evidence. The assertions, in conjunction 
with the assessment of materiality and audit risk, are used by the auditor to determine the 
nature, timing, and extent of evidence to be gathered. Once the auditor has obtained sufficient 
appropriate evidence that the management assertions can be relied upon for each significant 
account and disclosure, the auditor has reasonable assurance that the financial statements are 
fairly presented. Note the two key descriptors of audit evidence: sufficient and appropriate.
The sufficiency of audit evidence simply refers to the quantity of evidence the auditor 
obtains—does the auditor have enough evidence to justify a conclusion as to whether manage­
ment’s assertions are fairly stated? The appropriateness of audit evidence refers to whether 
the evidence is relevant and reliable. Relevance refers to whether the evidence relates to the 
specific management assertion being tested. Reliability refers to the diagnosticity of the evi­
dence. In other words, can a particular type of evidence be relied upon to signal the true state 
of the account balance or assertion being examined? Using the house inspection example, 
inspecting the foundation of a house may not give us relevant evidence about whether the roof 
leaks. Likewise, evidence about the roof that is obtained by standing on the ground and look­
ing up likely would not be as reliable as evidence obtained by climbing up on the roof or by 
inspecting the attic space.
While the auditor has a professional responsibility to obtain “sufficient appropriate evi­
dence,” the auditor seldom has the luxury of obtaining completely convincing evidence about 
the true state of a particular management assertion. In most situations, the auditor is able to 
obtain only persuasive evidence that the assertion is fairly stated.
You might ask why the auditor relies on concepts such as materiality and audit risk in design­
ing an audit. Why not test all account balances and all transactions that occurred during the 
period so that audit risk can be driven to zero, even for immaterial misstatements? The main 
reason is the cost and infeasibility of such an audit. In a very small business, the auditor might 
be able to examine all transactions that occurred during the period and all the accounts that 
exist at the end of the period and still issue the audit report in a reasonable amount of time. 
However, it is unlikely that the owner of the business could afford to pay for such an extensive 
audit. For a large organization, the sheer volume of transactions, which might well reach into 
the millions, prevents the auditor from examining every transaction. Similarly, ending account 
balances can reflect millions of individual items (e.g., individual inventory items making 
up the ending inventory account). Thus, just as with a house inspection, there is a trade-off 
between the exactness or precision of the audit and its cost.
To deal with the problem of not being able to examine every transaction and account, the 
auditor selects a subset of transactions and accounts to examine. Many times the auditor, based

on previous audits, understanding of the client’s internal control system, and knowledge of the 
client’s industry, is aware of items in an account balance that are more likely to contain mis­
statements. For example, the auditor’s prior knowledge may indicate that individual accounts 
receivable involving certain types of customers are more likely to contain misstatements. The 
auditor can use this knowledge to specifically select those particular accounts receivable for 
examination. When the auditor has no special knowledge about which particular transactions 
or items may be misstated, he or she uses random sampling procedures that increase the likeli­
hood of obtaining a sample that is representative of the population of transactions or account 
items. In such cases, the auditor uses the laws of probability to make inferences about poten­
tial misstatements based on examining a sample of transactions or items.
The size of the subset of items the auditor examines is primarily a function of materiality 
and the desired level of assurance for the account or assertion being examined. There is an 
inverse relation between sample size and materiality, and a direct relation between sample size 
and desired level of assurance. For example, if an auditor assesses a small materiality amount 
for an account, a larger sample will be needed than if materiality were a larger amount. This 
occurs because the auditor must gather more evidence (a larger sample) to have a reasonable 
likelihood of detecting smaller errors. You can think of materiality as the “fineness of the 
auditor’s filter.” A lower materiality amount requires the auditor to use a finer filter in order 
to detect smaller errors, and it takes more work to create a finer filter. Similarly, as the desired 
level of assurance increases for a given materiality amount, the sample size necessary to test 
an assertion becomes greater.
The Audit Process
Now that we have explained some of the fundamental concepts of auditing, let’s summarize 
the logical thought processes underlying a financial statement audit and then walk through the 
major phases of an audit. Be sure and take some time here—a thorough understanding of this 
section will be a great help to you in understanding subsequent chapters!
Overview of the Financial Statement Auditing Process
Consider the auditor’s task from a logical perspective. The end product of an auditor’s work is 
an opinion indicating whether or not the client’s financial statements are free of material mis­
statement. What might an auditor do to obtain the information needed to develop and support 
that opinion? The auditor must first obtain a thorough understanding of the client, its business 
and industry, and its information system. The auditor must understand the risks the client 
faces, how it deals with those risks, and what remaining risks are most likely to result in a 
material misstatement in the financial statements. Armed with this understanding, the auditor 
plans procedures that will produce evidence helpful in developing and supporting his or her 
opinion on the financial statements.
To understand this process intuitively, consider what financial statements are made of. 
From your financial accounting courses, you know that accounting systems capture, record, 
and summarize individual transactions. Entities must design and implement controls to 
ensure that those transactions are initiated, captured, recorded, and summarized appropriately. 
These individual transactions are grouped and summarized into various account balances, 
and finally, financial statements are formed by organizing meaningful collections of those 
account balances (e.g., current liabilities). We have just identified three stages in the account­
ing process that take place in the preparation of financial statements: internal controls are 
implemented to ensure that the client’s information system appropriately captures and records 
individual transactions, which are then collected into ending account balances. This sum­
mary might seem like an oversimplification, but it will help you understand the stages of a 
client’s accounting process on which auditors focus to collect evidence.
Keep in mind that the auditor’s job ultimately is to express an opinion on whether 
the financial statements are fairly stated. It makes sense, then, that the auditor can design 
LO 1-7

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
procedures to collect direct information about the ending account balances that make up the 
financial statements. For example, an auditor might confirm the ending balance of the cash 
account by contacting the client’s bank, or the auditor might verify the ending balance of 
the inventory account by physically examining individual inventory items that make up the 
ending balance. But remember—account balances are made up of transactions that occurred 
over the past year (or earlier). If the auditor designs procedures to test whether the transac­
tions were captured and handled properly, the auditor can obtain indirect information about 
whether the ending account balances are likely to be fairly stated. This information is clearly 
one step removed from the ending account balances themselves. But we can even back up 
one more step. If the auditor designs procedures to test whether the entity’s internal control 
over financial transactions is effective, the auditor can obtain additional indirect information 
regarding whether the account balances are fairly stated.
Carefully think through the logic in this last step: if controls are effective, then the trans­
actions will probably be captured and summarized properly, which means in turn that the 
account balances are likely to be free of material misstatement. Thus, information about inter­
nal control is even more indirect than information about transactions, but it is useful infor­
mation nonetheless! In fact, while it is indirect, evidence about internal control is often a 
relatively cost-effective form of audit evidence.
To summarize, the auditor can collect evidence in each of three different stages in a cli­
ent’s accounting system to help determine whether the financial statements are fairly stated: 
(1) the internal control put in place by the client to ensure proper handling of transactions 
(e.g., evaluate and test the controls); (2) the transactions that affect each account balance 
(e.g., examine a sample of the transactions that happened during the period); and (3) the end­
ing account balances themselves (e.g., examine a sample of the items that make up an ending 
account balance at year-end). Evidence that relates directly to ending account balances is 
usually the highest quality, but also the costliest, evidence. Thus, an auditor will usually rely 
on a combination of evidence from all three stages in forming an audit opinion regarding the 
fairness of the financial statements. On which of these three areas it is best to focus depends 
on the circumstances, and this is generally left to the auditor’s discretion. Chapters 3 and 5 
address the types of procedures and types of evidence available to the auditor in more detail.
Major Phases of the Audit
The audit process can be broken down into a number of audit phases (see Figure 1–4). While 
the figure suggests that these phases are sequential, they are actually quite iterative and inter­
related in nature. Phases often include audit procedures designed for one purpose that provide 
evidence for other purposes, and sometimes audit procedures accomplish purposes in more 
than one phase. Figure 1–4 shows the specific chapters where each of these phases is dis­
cussed in detail.
Client Acceptance/Continuance  Professional standards require that public account­
ing firms establish policies and procedures for deciding whether to accept new clients and 
to retain current clients. The purpose of such policies is to minimize the likelihood that an 
auditor will be associated with clients that lack integrity. If an auditor is associated with a 
client that lacks integrity, the risk increases that material misstatements may exist and not be 
detected by the auditor. For a prospective new client, the auditor is required to confer with 
the predecessor auditor and the auditor frequently conducts background checks on top man­
agement. The knowledge that the auditor gathers during the acceptance/continuance process 
provides valuable understanding of the entity and its environment, thus helping the auditor 
assess risk and plan the audit.
Preliminary Engagement Activities  There are generally three preliminary engagement 
activities: (1) determine the audit engagement team requirements; (2) ensure the indepen­
dence of the audit firm and audit team; and (3) establish an understanding with the client 
regarding the services to be performed and the other terms of the engagement.

	
Chapter 1    An Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing	
19
Once the decision has been made to accept an audit engagement, the auditor begins pre­
liminary engagement activities by updating his or her understanding of the entity and its envi­
ronment. This understanding includes the nature of the entity and the industry in which it 
operates, how it measures its own performance, the nature of its information system, and the 
quality of its internal control. The auditor’s understanding of the entity and its environment 
helps in assessing the risk of material misstatement and in setting the scope of the audit.
The engagement partner or manager forms an audit team composed of members who have 
the appropriate audit and industry experience for the engagement, determines whether special­
ists (e.g., tax specialists) are needed, and makes sure that the audit firm and individual team 
members are free from prohibited relationships that might threaten the auditor’s objectivity.

Finally, the auditor establishes an understanding with the client regarding the services to 
be performed and the terms of the engagement, including such considerations as timing of the 
audit and expected audit fees. Chapter 3 addresses the preliminary engagement activities of 
the audit process in more detail.
Plan the Audit  Proper planning is important to ensure that the audit is conducted in an 
effective and efficient manner. In order to plan the audit properly, the audit team must make 
a preliminary assessment of the client’s business risks and determine materiality. The audit 
team relies on these judgments to then assess risk relating to the likelihood of material mis­
statements in the financial statements. Audit planning should take into account the auditor’s 
understanding of the entity’s internal control system (discussed next). This assessment of 
internal control will be in greater depth if the client is a public company, because for public 
companies the auditor is required to report on both the company’s internal control over finan­
cial reporting and the company’s financial statements. The outcome of the auditor’s planning 
process is a written audit plan that sets forth the nature, extent, and timing of the audit proce­
dures to be performed. You will learn about the issues that are involved in this phase of the 
audit in Chapters 3, 4, and 5.
Consider and Audit Internal Control  A company’s system of internal control is put 
in place by the company’s board of directors and management to help the company achieve 
reliable financial reporting, effective and efficient operations, and consistent compliance 
with applicable laws and regulations. The quality of a company’s internal control over finan­
cial reporting is of direct relevance to auditors. As part of obtaining an understanding of the 
entity and its environment, the auditor obtains an understanding of internal control to help 
the auditor assess risk and identify areas where financial statements might be misstated. 
Chapter 6 covers the role of internal control in a financial statement audit, and Chapter 7 
specifically addresses the audit of internal control for public companies. Later chapters 
apply the process of considering and auditing internal control in the context of various busi­
ness processes.
Audit Business Processes and Related Accounts  Auditors usually organize audits 
by grouping financial statement accounts according to the business processes that primar­
ily affect those accounts. For example, sales revenue and accounts receivable are both part 
of a company’s sales and collection process and are audited together. The auditor applies 
audit procedures to the accounts in order to obtain audit evidence about management’s asser­
tions relating to each account and reduce the risk of undetected material misstatement to an 
appropriately low level. On most engagements, actually conducting the planned audit tests 
comprises most of the time spent on a financial statement audit or an audit of internal control 
over financial reporting. For public company clients, the audit of internal control is done in 
an integrated way with the financial statement audit. This topic is addressed in Chapter 7 and 
throughout the book where appropriate.
Complete the Audit  The auditor must obtain sufficient appropriate evidence in order to 
reach and justify a conclusion on the fairness of the financial statements. After the auditor has 
finished gathering reliable evidence relating to management’s financial statement assertions, 
the auditor assesses the sufficiency of the evidence and obtains additional evidence where 
deemed necessary. In this phase, the auditor also addresses a number of issues, including the 
possibility of undisclosed contingent liabilities, such as lawsuits, and searches for any events 
subsequent to the balance sheet date that may impact the financial statements. Chapter 17 
discusses the completion phase of the audit in detail.
Evaluate Results and Issue Audit Report  The final phase in the audit process is to 
evaluate results and choose the appropriate audit report to issue. The auditor’s report, also 
known as the audit opinion, is the main product or output of the audit. Just as the report of a

house inspector communicates the inspector’s findings to a prospective buyer, the audit report 
communicates the auditor’s findings to the users of the financial statements.
After completion of the audit work, the auditor determines if the preliminary assessments 
of risks were appropriate in light of the evidence collected and whether sufficient evidence 
was obtained. The auditor then aggregates the total known and estimated uncorrected mis­
statements and determines whether they cause the financial statements to be materially mis­
stated. If the uncorrected misstatements are judged to be material, the auditor will request that 
the client correct the misstatements. If the client refuses, the auditor issues an opinion that 
clearly indicates that the financial statements are materially misstated and explains the nature 
of the misstatement. If the uncorrected misstatements are insignificant enough that they do 
not cause the financial statements to be materially misstated, or if the client is willing to cor­
rect the misstatements, the auditor issues an unqualified (i.e., “clean”) report.
The Unqualified/Unmodified Audit Report
The unqualified audit report is by far the most common type of report issued.8 In this context, 
unqualified means that, because the financial statements are free of material misstatements, 
the auditor does not find it necessary to qualify (i.e. specify any exceptions to) his or her 
“clean” audit opinion. While it is fairly common for the auditor to find misstatements need­
ing correction, audit clients are almost always willing to make the adjustments necessary to 
receive a clean opinion. Exhibit 1–1 presents an audit report issued on EarthWear Clothier’s 
financial statements. This report covers financial statements that include balance sheets for 
two years and statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for three years. The 
audit report presented in Exhibit 1–1 is the standard type of unqualified audit opinion issued 
for publicly traded companies.
Take a moment to read through the report. You will see that the title refers to the “Inde­
pendent Registered Public Accounting Firm” issuing the audit report. The report is addressed 
to the individual or group that is the intended recipient of the report. The body of the report 
begins with an introductory paragraph indicating which financial statements are covered by 
the report, that the statements are the responsibility of management, and that the auditor has a 
responsibility to express an opinion.
The second, or scope, paragraph communicates to the users, in very general terms, what 
an audit entails. In addition to indicating that the audit was conducted in accordance with appli­
cable auditing standards, it emphasizes the fact that the audit provides only reasonable assur­
ance that the financial statements contain no material misstatements. The scope paragraph also 
discloses that an audit involves an examination of evidence on a test basis (i.e., using samples 
rather than examining entire populations), an assessment of accounting principles used and 
significant estimates, and an overall evaluation of financial statement presentation. Finally, the 
scope paragraph expresses the auditor’s judgment that the audit provides a reasonable basis for 
the opinion to be expressed in the report.
The third paragraph contains the auditor’s opinion concerning the fairness of the finan­
cial statements based on the audit evidence. Note two important phrases contained in this 
paragraph. First, the phrase “present fairly . . . in conformity with U.S. generally accepted 
accounting principles” indicates the criteria against which the auditor assesses management 
assertions. Second, the opinion paragraph contains the phrase “in all material respects,” 
emphasizing the concept of materiality. Note that the scope paragraph indicates how the audit 
was conducted—in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB—because EarthWear is a 
publicly traded company. Audit reports for nonpublic companies refer instead to “generally 
accepted auditing standards.”
The fourth paragraph contains explanatory language. As shown in Exhibit 1–1, when the 
auditor’s opinion on a public company’s financial statements is presented separately from the 
auditor’s report on the client’s internal control over financial reporting, as is the case here, the 
report must refer to the audit of internal control in an explanatory paragraph.
8A “clean” audit report is referred to as “unqualifed” by PCAOB auditing standards and as “unmodified” by AICPA 
and international auditing standards. See Chapters 2 and 18.

22	
Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
The financial statement audit report concludes with the manual or printed signature of 
the CPA firm providing the audit and with the date of the report. The audit report date indi­
cates the last day of the auditor’s responsibility for the review of significant events that have 
occurred after the date of the financial statements.
Other Types of Audit Reports
For an audit report to be unqualified, the audit must be done in accordance with applicable 
standards (e.g., the standards of the PCAOB), the auditor must be independent, there must be 
no significant limitations imposed on the auditor’s procedures, and the client’s financial state­
ments must be free of material departures from GAAP. If any one of these conditions is not 
met, the auditor issues a report that appropriately conveys to the reader the nature of the report 
and the reasons why the report is not unqualified.
For example, suppose a client’s financial statements contain a misstatement that the audi­
tor considers material and the client refuses to correct the misstatement. The auditor will likely 
qualify the report, explaining that the financial statements are fairly stated except for the misstate­
ment identified by the auditor. If the misstatement is considered so material that it pervasively 
affects the interpretation of the financial statements, the auditor will issue an adverse opinion, 
indicating that the financial statements are not fairly stated and should not be relied upon.
The Auditor’s Standard Unqualified Report–Comparative Financial 
Statements (with explanatory paragraph)
Title:
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Addressee:
To the Stockholders of EarthWear Clothiers
Introductory paragraph:
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of EarthWear Clothiers as of December 31, 2015 
and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements 
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on 
these financial statements based on our audits.
Scope paragraph:
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Over­
sight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An 
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. 
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Opinion paragraph:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of 
its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, 
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Explanatory paragraph 
referring to the audit of 
internal control:
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the effectiveness of EarthWear Clothiers’ internal control over financial report­
ing as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our 
report dated February 15, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion that EarthWear Clothiers main­
tained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting.

Other types of reports are available to the auditor as well, depending on the circum­
stances. For example, if the auditor is unable to obtain all the necessary information to con­
clude whether the inventory account is fairly stated (which is called a “scope limitation”), the 
auditor will qualify the report, indicating that the financial statements are fairly stated except 
for the fact that the auditor was unable to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about the 
inventory account. If the scope limitation is so pervasive that it limits the ability of the auditor 
to conclude on the financial statements as a whole (e.g., the client’s financial records were all 
destroyed in a fire), the auditor will issue a “disclaimer of opinion,” indicating that it is not 
possible to express an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements.
While it is important for you to be familiar with the basic components of the audit report 
as part of understanding an overview of the audit process, we cover the different types of 
financial statement audit reports in detail in Chapter 18. Our experience is that while it is 
helpful to get an idea of what an audit report looks like early on, students find it more intui­
tive to learn the fundamental concepts of auditing and how an audit is conducted before being 
immersed in the details of audit reporting.
The audit report represents the culmination of the audit process and is the way the auditor 
communicates his or her opinion about a client’s financial statements with outside parties. An 
example of an unqualified audit report is included in this chapter to give you a basic idea of 
what the most common type of audit report for a public company looks like and how auditors 
report their opinion to the public. Be aware that changes are coming for audit reporting—the 
biggest change perhaps being that the auditor will communicate “critical audit matters” in 
the audit report. Critical audit matters are those that involve difficult, subjective, or complex 
auditor judgments or pose significant difficulty to the auditor in completing the audit. We’ll 
discuss these coming changes further in Chapter 18.
Conclusion
You can see from this chapter that a good financial statement auditor needs to understand 
not only accounting but also the concepts and techniques of gathering and evaluating evi­
dence to assess management’s financial statement assertions. In addition, an auditor needs a 
deep understanding of business in general as well as of the specific industries in which his 
or her clients operate. This is why professionals with auditing experience frequently have 
attractive opportunities to move into other areas of business and management. Chief execu­
tive officers, business owners, chief financial officers, consultants, and controllers are often 
former auditors.
This chapter is designed to help you develop an intuitive understanding of basic auditing 
concepts. As you study auditing, you will need to commit some details to memory. But we 
can’t emphasize this enough: you will understand and appreciate the details of the auditing 
process much more fully if you make a serious effort to understand at an intuitive, common 
sense level why financial statement auditing is in demand, the fundamental concepts and 
logic underlying an audit, and the basic process by which it is carried out.
Keep in mind that auditing is a fundamentally logical process of thinking and 
­reasoning—don’t be hesitant to exercise your common sense and reasoning skills! You will 
benefit much more from your reading of this text (and likely do better on exams) if you 
study it with a reasoning, inquisitive approach, rather than merely attempting to memorize 
details. As you learn new auditing concepts, take some time to understand the underlying 
logic and how the concepts interrelate with other concepts. As you learn about auditing pro­
cedures, ask yourself how and why the procedure might yield relevant evidence, and think 
of other ways you might obtain useful evidence. Rote memorization alone is not a good way 
to study auditing!
Being a good auditor sometimes requires imagination and innovation. For example, a 
few years back an auditor was faced with figuring out how to verify a client’s assertion 
regarding the existence of inventory. The problem was that the “inventory” consisted of 
LO 1-9

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
thousands of head of cattle on a ranch covering dozens of square miles. There was no stan­
dard procedure manual for the auditor to refer to—he simply had to figure out an effective 
and efficient way to obtain persuasive evidence that the cattle existed in the numbers asserted 
by the ranch’s management.
In the end, the auditor decided to charter a small airplane to fly over the ranch and sys­
tematically take photos—1 per 50 square acres. The auditor was able to obtain a count of the 
cattle from the photos. He also evaluated veterinary records to see if the number of required 
annual vaccinations delivered by the vet approximated the number of cattle counted in the 
photos. Finally, he did some calculations based on average bovine birth and death rates, taking 
into account recorded purchases and sales of livestock during the year. Using this combina­
tion of procedures, the auditor was able to obtain persuasive evidence supporting manage­
ment’s assertion regarding inventory (and got an airplane ride in the process).
We hope this example helps illustrate why you will need to approach the study of audit­
ing differently from that of most other accounting courses, and how learning auditing con­
cepts can benefit you even if you do not plan to become a financial statement auditor. We 
can promise you this—in learning the concepts and techniques of auditing, you will not only 
acquire the tools to become an effective financial statement auditor, you will also learn new 
ways of reasoning and analyzing that will be highly useful to you in many different contexts 
and settings.

PROBLEMS
All applicable problems are available with Connect. 
	
LO 1-2	
1-24	 Greenbloom Garden Centers is a small, privately held corporation that has two 
stores in Orlando, Florida. The Greenbloom family owns 100 percent of the com­
pany’s stock, and family members manage the operations. Sales at the company’s 
stores have been growing rapidly, and there appears to be a market for the com­
pany’s sales concept—providing bulk garden equipment and supplies at low prices. 
The controller prepares the company’s financial statements, which are not audited. 
The company has no debt but is considering expanding to other cities in Florida. 
Such expansion may require long-term borrowings and is likely to reduce the fam­
ily’s day-to-day involvement in all of the company’s operations. The family does not 
intend to sell stock in the company.

1-26	 John Josephs, an audit manager for Tip, Acanoe & Tylerto, was asked to speak at a 
dinner meeting of the local Small Business Administration Association. The presi­
dent of the association has suggested that he talk about the various phases of the 
audit process to help small business owners better understand what auditors do. John 
has asked you, his trusted assistant, to prepare an outline for his speech. He suggests 
that you answer the following:
	
a.	 List and briefly describe the various phases of an audit.
	
b.	 Describe how audit procedures designed for one purpose might also provide evi­
dence for other purposes. Give an example.

and review their financial statements, including their auditors’ reports.
	
b.	 Search the web for the home page of a non-U.S. company and review its finan­
cial statements, including its auditor’s report. For example, BMW’s home page 
(www.bmwgroup.com, under Investor Relations) allows a visitor to download the 
financial statements and accompanying audit report as a .pdf file. Identify the 
auditing standards followed by the company’s auditors.
	
c.	 Compare the standard U.S. audit report with the audit report for the non-U.S.

Company History and Operations 
EarthWear Clothiers was founded in Boise, Idaho, by James Williams and Calvin Rogers 
in 1973 to make high-quality clothing for outdoor sports, such as hiking, skiing, fly-fishing, 
and white-water kayaking. Over the years, the Company’s product lines have grown 
to include casual clothing, accessories, shoes, and soft luggage. EarthWear offers its 
products through three retailing options: catalogs, retail outlets, and its website.
The Company strives to provide excellent, high-quality products at reasonable prices. 
EarthWear has a commitment to excellence in customer service and an unconditional 
guarantee. The Company is also conscious of its environmental responsibilities. 
All Company facilities are insulated, recycle, and conserve power. The Company 
continuously monitors the environmental impact of its products. The Company believes 
that many of its customers share this concern for the environment.
The Company offers its products principally through regular mailings of its monthly 
catalogs in the United States, Europe, and Japan. EarthWear has 10 U.S. outlet stores, 
four in the U.K., two in Germany, and two in Japan. The Company also offers its products 
over the Internet (www.mhhe.com/earthwear). During 2011, the Company expanded its 
global presence by launching sites in France, Italy, Ireland, and several eastern European 
countries.  Currently, revenue from catalog sales, retail outlets, and the website are 74 
percent, 5 percent, and 21 percent, respectively. Management expects that Internet sales 
will grow significantly in the future, perhaps replacing catalogs as the major source of 
sales. 
EarthWear was incorporated in Idaho in 1975 and became a Delaware corporation in 
1986 when it went public.

company growth strategy  EarthWear’s growth 
strategy has three elements. First, the Company attempts to 
increase sales by expanding its customer base and by increasing 
sales to existing customers through improved product offerings. 
Second, the Company seeks to generate additional sales by 
targeted mailings of special issues of its catalogs and by offering 
its products through its web site. Third, the Company is pursuing 
additional opportunities to expand its merchandising skills 
internationally.
catalogs and sales operations  During 
2015 the Company mailed 12 issues of its regular monthly catalog 
with an average of 75 pages per issue from its U.S. operations. 
Worldwide, the Company mailed approximately 160 million full-
price catalogs. EarthWear views each catalog issue as a unique 
opportunity to communicate with its customers. Products are 
described in visual and editorial detail, and the Company uses 
such techniques as background stories and distinctive covers to 
stimulate the readers’ interest.
Each issue of the regular catalog offers certain basic product 
lines for men and women. The regular catalog also offers 
seasonal merchandise. In addition, EarthWear mails two end-
of-season clearance catalogs. The Company mails its catalogs 
to prospective customers who are identified based on lists of 
magazine subscribers and lists of households meeting certain 
demographic criteria. In addition, the Company identifies 
prospective new customers through its national advertising 
campaign.
In 1991 the Company introduced its first business specialty catalog, 
which offered its products to groups and companies for corporate 
incentive programs. EarthWear’s embroidery capabilities allow for 
the design and monogram of unique logos or emblems for groups 
and companies. In 2015 the Company mailed five issues of its 
corporate sales catalogs.
The international business segment includes operations in 
Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom, and various Internet 
sites. Catalogs mailed in those countries are written in the local 
languages and denominated in local currencies. In the spring 
of 2011, EarthWear launched local websites in each of these 
countries in their respective languages and currencies.
customer database  A principal factor in the 
Company’s success has been the development of its own list of 
active customers. At the end of 2015 the Company’s mailing list 
consisted of about 21.1 million persons, approximately 7 million 
of whom were viewed as customers because they had made at 
least one purchase from the Company within the last 24 months. 
The Company routinely updates and refines the database 
before mailing catalogs to monitor customer interest as reflected 
in criteria such as the recency, frequency, dollar amount, and 
product type of purchases.
EarthWear believes that its customer database has desirable 
demographic characteristics and is well suited to the products 
offered in “the Company’s” catalogs. A survey conducted by 
the Company in the United States during 2014 indicated that 
approximately 50 percent of its customers were in the 35–54 
age group and had median incomes of $78,000.
The Company advertises nationally to build its reputation and 
to attract new customers. In 2014 an advertising campaign 
appeared in about 40 national magazines, as well as on five 
national cable television networks. In addition, the Company 
advertises in approximately 75 national, regional, and local 
publications in Canada, the United 
Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. EarthWear 
also advertises on a number of Internet 
search engines and websites.
product development 
EarthWear concentrates on clothing 
and other products that are aimed at 
customers interested in outdoor activities. 
The Company’s products are styled and 
quality crafted to meet the changing tastes 
of the Company’s customers rather than 
to mimic the changing fads of the fashion 
world. At the same time, the Company 
seeks to maintain customer interest by 
developing new products, improving 
existing core products, and reinforcing its 
value positioning.
The Company continues to incorporate 
innovations in fabric, construction, and 
detail that add value and excitement 
and differentiate EarthWear from the 
competition. In order to ensure that products are manufactured 
to the Company’s quality standards at reasonable prices, 
product managers, designers, and quality assurance specialists 
develop the Company’s own products.
EarthWear deals directly with its suppliers and seeks to avoid 
intermediaries. All goods are produced by independent 
manufacturers except for most of its soft luggage, which is 
assembled at the Company’s facilities. During 2015 the 
Company purchased merchandise from approximately 300 
domestic and foreign manufacturers. One manufacturer and 
one intermediary accounted for about 14 and 29 percent of 
the Company’s received merchandise, respectively, in 2015.  
In 2015 about 80 percent of the Company’s merchandise was 
imported, mainly from Asia, Central America, Mexico, and Central 
America. The Company will continue to take advantage of 
worldwide sourcing without sacrificing customer service or 
quality standards.

Order Entry, Fulfillment, and Delivery
EarthWear has toll-free telephone numbers that customers can call 24 hours a day, seven days a week (except Christmas 
Day) to place orders or to request a catalog. Approximately 90 percent of catalog orders are placed by telephone. 
Telephone calls are answered by the Company’s well-trained sales representatives, who utilize online computer terminals 
to enter customer orders and to retrieve information about product characteristics and availability. The Company’s three 
U.S. telephone centers are located in Boise, Idaho; Reston, Virginia; and Canton, Ohio. International telephone centers are 
located in London, England; Tokyo, Japan; and Mannheim, Germany.
The Company’s order entry and fulfillment system permits shipment of in-stock orders on the following day, but orders 
requiring monogramming or inseaming typically require one or two extra days. The Company’s” sales representatives enter 
orders into an online order entry and inventory control system. Customers using the Company’s Internet site see color 
photos of the products, their availability, and prices. When ordering a product over the Internet, the customer completes a 
computer screen that requests information on product code, size, color, and so on. When the customer finishes shopping 
for products, he or she enters delivery and credit card information into a computer-based form. EarthWear provides 
assurance through CPA WebTrust SM that the website has been evaluated and tested to meet WebTrust SM  principles and 
criteria. This assurance service is provided by the Company’s independent auditors, Willis & Adams, LLP.
Orders are generally shipped by United Parcel Service (UPS) at various tiered rates that depend on the total dollar value 
of each customer’s order. Other expedited delivery services are available at additional charge. Domestically, the Company 
utilizes two-day UPS service at standard rates, enhancing its customer service. Comparable services are offered in 
international markets.

merchandise liquidation  Liquidations (sales of 
overstock and end-of-season merchandise at reduced prices) 
were approximately 12 percent, 11 percent, and 8 percent of net 
sales in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Most liquidation sales 
were made through catalogs and other print media. The balance 
was sold principally through the Company’s outlet retail stores.
competition  The Company’s principal competitors are 
retail stores, including specialty shops, department stores, and 
other catalog companies. Direct competitors include Eddie 
Bauer, Land’s End, L. L. Bean, Patagonia, and Timberland. The 
Company may also face increased competition from other 
retailers as the number of television shopping channels and 
the variety of merchandise offered over the Internet increase. 
The apparel retail business in general is intensely competitive. 
EarthWear competes principally on the basis of merchandise 
value (quality and price), its established customer list, 
and customer service, including fast order fulfillment and its 
unqualified guarantee.
trademarks  The Company uses the trademarks of 
“EarthWear” and “EWC” on products and catalogs.
seasonality of business  The Company’s business 
is highly seasonal. Historically, a disproportionate amount of the 
Company’s net sales and most of its profits have been realized 
during the fourth quarter. If the Company’s sales were materially 
different from seasonal norms during the fourth quarter, the 
Company’s annual operating results could be materially 
affected. Accordingly, results for the individual quarters do not 
necessarily indicate results to be expected for the entire year. 
In 2015, 37 percent of the Company’s total revenue came in the 
fourth quarter.
employees  The Company believes that its skilled and 
dedicated workforce is one of its key resources. Employees 
are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the 
Company considers its employee relations to be excellent. As a 
result of the highly seasonal nature of the Company’s business, 
the size of the Company’s workforce varies, ranging from 
approximately 3,500 to 5,300 individuals in 2015. During the peak 
winter season of 2015, approximately 2,700 of the Company’s 
5,300 employees were temporary employees.
executive officers of the company 
James G. Williams, is chairman of the board and former chief 
executive officer. Mr. Williams was one of the two original 
founders of EarthWear. He stepped down as chief executive 
officer in December 1999.
Calvin J. Rogers, is president and chief executive officer of the 
Company. Mr. Rogers was one of the two original founders of the 
Company. He assumed his present position in December 1999.
Dominique DeSantiago, is executive vice president and 
chief operating officer. Mr. DeSantiago joined the Company 
as chief operating officer in June 1991. He was promoted to 
vice president in October 1994. Mr. DeSantiago was previously 
employed by Eddie Bauer in various capacities.
Linda S. McDaniel, is senior vice president of sales. She joined 
the Company in July 1996. Ms. McDaniel served as divisional 
vice president, merchandising, with Patagonia between 1986 and 
1990. Ms. McDaniel was the president and chief executive officer 
for Mountain Goat Sports from 1990 until 1996. She has been 
serving as a director of the Company since November 1997.
James C. ("JC") Watts, is senior vice president and chief 
financial officer. Mr. Watts joined the Company in May 1996, 
assuming his current position. He was previously employed by 
Federated Department Stores.
Mary Ellen Tornesello, is senior vice president of operations. Ms. 
Tornesello joined the Company in 1994 as operations manager. 
She served as vice president of operations from 1995 until 1997, 
at which time she assumed her present position.

note a: summary of significant 
accounting policies
NATURE OF BUSINESS  EarthWear markets high quality 
clothing for outdoor sports, casual clothing, accessories, 
shoes, and soft luggage. The Company manages its 
business in three operating segments consisting of 
core, business-to-business, and international. The 
Company’s primary market is the United States; other 
markets include Canada, Europe, and Japan.
PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  The consolidated 
statements include the accounts of the Company and its 
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts 
and transactions.
USE OF ESTIMATES  The preparations of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements and the reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
REVENUE RECOGNITION  The Company records 
revenue at the time of shipment for catalog and 
e-commerce sales and at the point of sale for stores. 
The Company provides a reserve for returns. 
RESERVE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER RETURNS  
At the time of sale, the Company provides a reserve 
equal to the gross profit on projected merchandise 
returns, based on prior returns experience.
INVENTORY  Inventory is stated at the last-in, first-out 
(LIFO) cost, which is lower than market. If the first-
in, first-out method of accounting for inventory had 
been used, inventory would have been approximately 
$10.8 million and $13.7 million higher than reported at 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
ADVERTISING The Company expenses the costs of 
advertising for magazines, television, radio, and other 
media the first time the advertising takes place, except 
for direct-response advertising, which is capitalized and 
amortized over its expected period of future benefits. 
Direct-response advertising consists primarily of catalog 
production and mailing costs, which are generally 
amortized within three months from the date catalogs 
are mailed.
DEPRECIATION  Depreciation expense is calculated 
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful 
lives of the assets, which are 20 to 30 years for buildings 
and land improvements and 5 to 10 years for leasehold 
improvements and furniture, fixtures, equipment, and 
software. The Company allocates one half year of 
depreciation to the year of addition or retirement.
INTANGIBLES Intangible assets consist primarily of 
goodwill, and is not amortized but is tested at least 
annually for impairment. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-
SHEET RISK The Company uses import letters of credit 
to purchase foreign-sourced merchandise. The letters 
of credit are primarily U.S. dollar-denominated and 
are issued through third-party financial institutions to 
guarantee payment for such merchandise within the 
agreed-upon time periods. At December 31, 2015, 
the Company had outstanding letters of credit of 
approximately $23 million, all of which had expiration 
dates of less than one year.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS AND 
TRANSACTIONS Financial statements of the 
foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars 
in accordance with ASC Topic 830. Translation 
adjustments are recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income, which is a component of 
stockholders’ equity.
note b: stockholders’ equity
COMMON STOCK  The Company currently is authorized 
to issue 70 million shares of $0.01 par value common 
stock.
TREASURY STOCK  The Company’s board of directors 
has authorized the purchase of a total of 12.7 million 
shares of the Company’s common stock. A total of 
6.5 million and 6.7 million had been purchased as of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
STOCK AWARDS AND GRANTS  The Company has a 
restricted stock award plan. Under the provisions of the 
plan, a committee of the Company’s board may award 
shares of the Company’s common stock to its officers 
and key employees. Such shares vest over a 10-year 
period on a straight-line basis.
The granting of these awards has been recorded as 
deferred compensation based on the fair market value 
of the shares at the date of the grant. Compensation 
expense under these plans is recorded as shares vest.
STOCK OPTIONS  The Company has 3.5 million shares 
of common stock that may be issued pursuant 
to the exercise of options granted under the 
Company’s stock option plan. Options 
are granted at the discretion of a 
committee of the Company’s 
board of directors to officers 
and key employees of the 
Company. No option may have 
an exercise price less than the 
fair market value per share of 
the common stock at the date 
of the grant.

subsidiaries. At December 31, 2015, $11 million was 
outstanding at interest rates averaging 4.6 percent, 
compared with $7.6 million at December 31, 2014.

note e: leases

equipment under various lease arrangements. The 
leases are accounted for as operating leases.
note f: retirement plans

most regular employees and provides for annual 
contributions at the discretion of the board of directors. 
Included in the plan is a 401(k) feature that allows 
employees to make contributions.
management’s discussion and  
analysis:
2015 was a year during which we’ve seen the results 
of our strategic initiatives of the last two years take 
hold. Sales momentum picked up toward the end 
of the third quarter and continued strongly through 
our all-important holiday season, and we reported a 
double-digit increase in both revenue and earnings 
for the fourth quarter. This success enabled us 
to complete the year with an annual 10.8 percent 
increase in total revenue, but a 27.8 percent decrease 
in earnings, mainly due to the weakness of the first 
nine months. Our strong finish for the year was 
gratifying in the face of a difficult economy.
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: 
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR 2015 COMPARED TO 
2014
TOTAL REVENUE INCREASED BY 10.8 PERCENT   
Total revenue for the year just ended was $950.5 
million, compared with $857.9 million in the prior year, 
an increase of 10.8 percent. Seasonally strong sales 
resulted in a higher level of backorders during the 
fourth quarter and a first-time fulfillment rate of 85 
percent for the year as a whole, slightly below the prior 
year’s rate. Overall merchandise sales growth was 
primarily attributable to changes in circulation, which 
included adding back our post-Thanksgiving catalog 
and our January full-price catalog, shifting the timing 
of our fall/winter mailings, increasing page circulation 
and improving merchandise selection and creative 
presentations.
NET INCOME DECREASED  Net income for 2015 was 
$22.5 million, down 27.8 percent from the $31.2 million 
earned in 2014. Diluted earnings per share for the 
year just ended were $1.14, compared with $1.56 per 
share for the prior year.  The diluted weighted average 
number of common shares outstanding was 19.8 million 
for 2015 and 20.0 million for 2014.
GROSS PROFIT MARGIN  Gross profit for the year 
just ended was $404 million, or 42.5 percent of total 
revenue, compared with $385 million, or 44.9 percent 
of total revenue, for the prior year. Liquidations were 
about 11 percent of net merchandise sales in 2015, 
compared with 12 percent in the prior year. In 2015, 
the cost of inventory purchases was down 2.0 percent, 
compared with deflation of 2.7 percent in 2014. This 
reduction was a result of improved sourcing. As a result, 
the LIFO inventory reserve was reduced by $2.8 million 
and $3.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE 
EXPENSES  Selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) 
expenses increased 9.0 percent to $364 million in 
2015, compared with $334 million in the prior year. As 
a percentage of sales, SG&A was 38.3 percent in 2015 
and 38.9 percent in the prior year. The decrease in the 
SG&A ratio was primarily the result of lower catalog 
costs associated with increased page circulation, as 
well as lower information services expenses as we 
continued to invest in the Internet and upgrade systems 
capabilities. The cost of producing and mailing catalogs 
represented about 39 percent and 38 percent of total 
SG&A in 2015 and 2014, respectively.
CREDIT LINES AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES   
Interest expense on lines of credit was down in 2015 
due to lower average borrowing levels. Interest 
expense decreased to $1.0 million in 2015, compared 
to $1.2 million in 2014. We spent $29 million in cash 
on capital expenditures, which included $20 million 
for computer hardware and software. In addition, the 
Company acquired a new airplane by exchanging 
two of its own aircraft in 2015. Also, we purchased 
about $18 million in treasury stock. No long-term 
debt was outstanding at year-end 
2015. Depreciation and amortization 
expense was $15.2 million, up 13.1 
percent from the prior year, mainly 
due to computer software. Rental 
expense was $10.4 million, up 3.4 
percent from 2014, primarily due 
to additional computer hardware.

MANAGEMENT’S  DECISION AND ANALYSIS
© Ingram Publishing/Alamy RF

To the Stockholders 
EarthWear Clothiers, Inc.
Management of EarthWear Clothiers, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for the preparation, 
consistency, integrity, and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements. The 
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on a consistent 
basis and, in management’s opinion, are fairly presented. The financial statements include 
amounts that are based on management’s informed judgments and best estimates.
Management has established and maintains comprehensive systems of internal control 
that provide reasonable assurance as to the consistency, integrity, and reliability of the 
preparation and presentation of financial statements; the safeguarding of assets; the 
effectiveness and efficiency of operations; and compliance with applicable laws and 
regulations. The concept of reasonable assurance is based upon the recognition that the 
cost of the controls should not exceed the benefit derived. Management monitors the 
systems of internal control and maintains an independent internal auditing program that 
assesses the effectiveness of internal control. Management assessed the Company’s internal 
control over financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. This assessment was based 
on criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in Internal 
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission (the COSO report). Based on this assessment, management believes 
that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting for financial 
presentations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America as of December 31, 2015.
The Board of Directors exercises its oversight role with respect to the Company’s systems of 
internal control primarily through its Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of outside 
directors. The Committee oversees the Company’s systems of internal control and financial 
reporting to assess whether their quality, integrity, and objectivity are sufficient to protect 
shareholders’ investments.
The Company’s consolidated financial statements have been audited by Willis & Adams LLP 
(“Willis & Adams”), independent auditors. As part of its audit, Willis & Adams considers the 
Company’s internal control to plan the audit and determine the nature, timing, and extent of 
auditing procedures considered necessary to render its opinion as to the fair presentation, 
in all material respects, of the consolidated financial statements, which is based on 
independent audits made accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting 
Oversight Board (United States).  Management has made available to Willis & Adams all the 
Company’s financial records and related data, and information concerning the Company’s 
internal control over financial reporting, and believes that all representations made to Willis & 
Adams during its audits were valid and appropriate.

AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

To the Stockholders
EarthWear Clothiers, Inc.
We have audited EarthWear Clothiers’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). EarthWear Clothiers’ management is 
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management 
Report on the Financial Statements and Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable 
assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material 
respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of 
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing 
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our 
audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable 
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal 
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the 
assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, 
and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations 
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention 
or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect  
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedure may deteriorate.
In our opinion, EarthWear Clothiers maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2015, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated 
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements of EarthWear Clothiers and our report dated 
February 15, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion.

To the Stockholders
EarthWear Clothiers, Inc.
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of EarthWear Clothiers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 
and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the 
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on 
our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board 
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on 
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also 
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations 
and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. 
generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight 
Board (United States), the effectiveness of EarthWear Clothiers' internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and our report dated  
February 15, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion. EarthWear Clothiers maintained, in all material respects, 
effective internal control over financial reporting.

his chapter is designed to give you an overview of the auditing pro­
fession and to help you understand the environment in which auditors 
function. The chapter begins by briefly introducing the various types of 
auditors and the types of audit, attest, and assurance services that auditors 
offer. This is followed by a description of public accounting firms and a dis­
cussion of the far-reaching changes in the public accounting profession over 
the past several years. One of the most important and useful skills auditors 
develop is the ability to quickly understand and analyze various business mod­
els, strategies, and processes and to identify key risks relevant to a particular 
entity—these elements largely shape the immediate context in which audit­
ing is performed. Accordingly, the chapter introduces a high-level model of 
business that is useful for organizing an audit. The chapter then discusses the 
major professional and regulatory organizations that affect the public account­
ing profession and explains how auditing standards are established in today’s 
rather messy professional and regulatory environment. Because ethical behav­
ior and reputation play key roles in shaping the public accounting profession 
and its environment, the chapter provides a brief overview of the profession’s 
Code of Professional Conduct.
The book also includes a module on professional judgment in auditing, 
which your instructor may assign you to read. The module is based on the 
award-winning KPMG Professional Judgment Framework, which two of the 
authors of this book helped KPMG, LLP to create and implement in its U.S. 
audit practice. The module, found immediately after Chapter 21, will help you 
begin to develop your own professional judgment by learning what a good 
audit judgment process looks like and how to avoid common judgment traps 
and biases.
The Financial Statement 
Auditing Environment

38	
Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
This book focuses primarily on external auditors and how they provide assurance on the 
financial statements they audit. However, before moving ahead to help you understand the 
environment in which external auditors work, let’s briefly discuss exactly what an external 
auditor is and introduce you to some other types of auditors, including internal auditors, gov­
ernment auditors, and forensic auditors. One important requirement for each type of auditor 
is independence in some form from the entity being audited. As described below, each dif­
ferent type of auditor usually specializes in a particular type of audit work. However, each 
type of auditor often provides more than one of the various types of audit and other services 
described in the next section.
External Auditors
External auditors are often referred to as independent auditors. An external auditor may prac­
tice as a sole proprietor or as a member of a CPA firm, as discussed later in the chapter. 
Such auditors are called “external” or “independent” because they are not employees of the 
entity being audited. The terms external auditor and independent auditor are generally used 
interchangeably. External auditors audit financial statements for publicly traded and private 
companies, partnerships, municipalities, individuals, and other types of entities. They may 
also conduct compliance, operational, and forensic audits for such entities (see next section).
To sign an audit opinion on an entity’s financial statements in the United States, an exter­
nal auditor must be a certified public accountant (CPA). The CPA certificate is regulated by 
state law through licensing departments in each state.1 State requirements for CPA certifica­
tion can be summed up as the “Three Es”—Education, Examination, and Experience. The 
education requirements for becoming a CPA vary among the states, with a minimum certifi­
cation requirement of a four-year college degree with selected courses in business and 
accounting. In addition, the District of Columbia and 46 states require 150 semester credit 
hours of education at an accredited college or university, and some states require professional 
experience before the CPA certificate is granted. All states require that an individual pass the 
Uniform CPA Examination, administered by the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants (AICPA) (see Exhibit 2–1).
Internal Auditors
Auditors who are employees of individual companies, government agencies, and other enti­
ties are called internal auditors. In major corporations, internal audit staffs are often quite 
large, and the director of internal auditing (sometimes called the chief audit executive, or 
CAE) is usually a major job title within the entity.
The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) is the primary organization supporting internal audi­
tors. Its mission is to “provide dynamic leadership for the global profession of internal auditing.” 
The IIA has developed a set of professional standards to be followed by internal auditors and has 
established a certification program. An individual who meets the certification requirements 
established by the IIA, including passing a uniform written examination, can become a certified 
internal auditor (CIA).2 Many internal auditors also have a CPA certificate.
The IIA defines internal auditing as “an independent, objective assurance and consulting 
activity designed to add value and improve an organization’s operations. It helps an organiza­
tion accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and 
improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes.”
Internal auditors often conduct financial, internal control, compliance, operational, and 
forensic audits within their organizations (see next section). In some cases they may assist the

external auditors with the annual financial statement audit. Internal auditors also often are 
involved in assurance and consulting engagements for their entities. Chapter 21 offers more 
detail on the IIA and the internal auditing profession.
Government Auditors
Government auditors are employed by federal, state, and local agencies. Government auditors 
are usually considered to be a type of internal auditor. At the federal level, two agencies use 
auditors extensively: the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS). The GAO is under the direction of the comptroller general of the United States 
and is responsible to Congress. GAO auditors conduct audits of activities, financial transac­
tions, and accounts of the federal government. They also assist Congress by performing spe­
cial audits, surveys, and investigations. The majority of the audits conducted by GAO auditors 
are compliance and operational audits (see next section).
The IRS is part of the U.S. Treasury Department. The main activity of IRS auditors 
is examining and auditing the books and records of organizations and individuals to deter­
mine their federal tax liability. IRS audits are compliance audits, ensuring that individuals and 
organizations are complying with federal tax laws.
Three other federal agencies that conduct audits are the Army Audit Agency, the Defense 
Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). FBI auditors, 
The Computer-Based Uniform CPA Examination
The Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination is delivered in a computer-based format at test cen­
ters across the United States. An individual must pass the examination in order to qualify for licensure as 
a CPA in the U.S. CPAs are the only licensed accounting professionals in the U.S. There is no national CPA 
licensure process in the U.S.—CPA licenses are issued by each state’s Board of Accountancy. According to 
the AICPA, “the purpose of the Uniform CPA Examination is to provide reasonable assurance to Boards of 
Accountancy that those who pass the CPA Examination possess the level of technical knowledge and the 
skills necessary for initial licensure in protection of the public interest.”
Examination Content
The CPA examination has a total length of 14 hours and has four sections: Auditing and Attestation (AUD), 
Financial Accounting and Reporting (FAR), Regulation (REG), and Business Environment and Concepts (BEC).
The AUD, FAR, and REG sections contain three sets (or “testlets”) of 24–30 multiple choice questions 
each, and one set of six or seven short “task-based simulations.” The simulations provide a set of facts 
and require candidates to access authoritative literature and complete related tasks. The BEC section 
contains three multiple choice testlets and three “written communication tasks” on BEC topics.
Sections
 • Auditing and Attestation (4 hours). Covers knowledge of auditing procedures, generally accepted 
auditing standards, and other standards related to attest engagements, ethics, and the skills 
needed to apply that knowledge.
 • Financial Accounting and Reporting (4 hours). Covers knowledge of generally accepted accounting 
principles for business enterprises, not-for-profit organizations, and governmental entities and the 
skills needed to apply that knowledge.
 • Regulation (3 hours). Covers knowledge of federal taxation, ethics in tax practice, professional and 
legal responsibilities, and business law and the skills needed to apply that knowledge.
 • Business Environment and Concepts (3 hours). Covers knowledge of general business environ­
ment and business concepts that candidates need to know in order to understand the underlying 
business reasons for and accounting implications of business transactions and the skills needed to 
apply that knowledge.
As of January 1, 2011, the CPA exam began to include questions on international accounting and audit­
ing standards.

for example, frequently investigate for fraud in government agencies and other organizations 
subject to federal laws. Last, most state and local governments have agencies that perform 
functions similar to the GAO and IRS but at the state or local level.
Forensic Auditors
Forensic auditors are employed by corporations, government agencies, public accounting 
firms, and consulting and investigative services firms. They are specially trained in detect­
ing, investigating, and deterring fraud and white-collar crime (see the discussion of forensic 
auditing later in this chapter). Some examples of situations where forensic auditors are often 
involved include
	
∙	 Reconstructing incomplete or damaged accounting records to settle an insurance 
claim over inventory valuation.
	
∙	 Probing money-laundering activities by tracking and reconstructing cash transactions.
	
∙	 Identifying and investigating transactions and assets in business or marital disputes.
	
∙	 Investigating and documenting embezzlement allegations and negotiating insurance 
settlements.
The Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) is the primary organization support­
ing forensic auditors. The ACFE is a 75,000-member professional organization dedicated to 
reducing the incidence of fraud and white-collar crime and assisting its members in fraud 
detection and deterrence.
The ACFE offers a certification program for individuals wanting to become CFEs. An 
individual interested in becoming a CFE must pass the Uniform CFE Examination.3 CFEs 
have various professional backgrounds, including auditors, accountants, fraud investigators, 
loss prevention specialists, attorneys, educators, and criminologists. CFEs gather evidence, 
take statements, write reports, and assist in investigating fraud in its varied forms. They some­
times act as expert witnesses in court cases.
3See the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners’ home page (www.acfe.com) for more information on the associa-
tion and the CFE program.
Opportunities where auditors can provide audit, attest, or assurance services arise from the 
need for management to be accountable to employees, shareholders, customers, and commu­
nities. In this section, examples of these types of services are briefly discussed.
Other Audit Services
In addition to the financial statement audit, there are four major types of audits: internal con­
trol audits, compliance audits, operational audits, and forensic audits. These audits are often 
performed by auditors employed by public accounting firms, but similar services may be 
performed by internal, forensic, or governmental auditors.
Internal Control Audits  Financial statement auditors have always had the option of test­
ing controls to obtain indirect evidence about the fairness of the financial statements. How­
ever, until recently, auditors were generally neither required nor allowed to express an opinion 
on an entity’s system of internal control as part of a financial statement audit.4 This changed 
LO 2-2
4Exceptions include audits of government agencies and audits of large banks complying with the Federal Deposi-
tory Institution Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) of 1991, which, similar to the Sarbanes-Oxley requirement 
for all public companies, requires an independent audit of the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control over 
financial reporting.
Types of Other Audit, Attest, and Assurance 
Services

	
Chapter 2    The Financial Statement Auditing Environment	
41
when the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required public companies to engage an external auditor to 
provide an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. An audit of internal control is 
available but not required for private entities.
Because the objectives and work involved in performing an audit of internal control and 
an audit of financial statements are closely interrelated, auditing standards for public compa­
nies require an integrated audit of internal control and financial statements. We provide more 
detail about the audit of internal control for public companies in Chapter 7.
Compliance Audits  A compliance audit determines the extent to which rules, policies, 
laws, covenants, or government regulations are followed by the entity being audited. For 
example, a university may ask auditors to determine whether applicable rules and policies are 
being followed with respect to the granting of student loans. Another example is the examina­
tion of tax returns of individuals and companies by the Internal Revenue Service for compli­
ance with the tax laws.
Operational Audits  An operational audit involves a systematic review of part or all of 
an organization’s activities to evaluate whether resources are being used effectively and 
efficiently. The purpose of an operational audit is to assess performance, identify areas for 
improvement, and develop recommendations. Sometimes this type of audit is referred to as a 
performance audit or management audit. Operational audits present different challenges than 
financial statement audits or compliance audits because operational audits often require the 
auditor to identify or create objective, measurable criteria against which to assess effective­
ness and efficiency. Operational auditing has increased in importance in recent years, and this 
trend will likely continue. An example of an operational audit is when an entity employs audi­
tors to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of its use of information technology resources.
Forensic Audits  The purpose of a forensic audit is to detect or deter fraudulent activi­
ties. Forensic auditing has increased significantly in recent years. As we mentioned above in 
discussing forensic auditors, some examples of where a forensic audit might be conducted 
include business or employee fraud, various other types of criminal investigations where 
money or other assets are involved, and matrimonial disputes involving division of assets.
Attest Services
Auditors can provide numerous types of attest services regarding almost any subject matter. 
For example, an auditor might be asked to attest to the nature and quantity of inventory stored 
in an entity’s warehouse so that the entity can obtain a bank loan with the inventory as collat­
eral. A promising new area of attestation services relates to assertions companies make about 
sustainability–claimed reductions in carbon emissions or appropriate handling of hazardous 
waste, for example. Chapter 21 presents more detailed information about attest services.
Assurance Services
As we discussed in Chapter 1, auditing and attestation are specialized forms of the more gen­
eral category of assurance services. Thus, CPAs can offer a variety of services that provide 
assurance but that do not qualify as auditing or attestation. These nonattest services can be 
Practice 
INSIGHT
Occupational fraud is a widespread problem that affects practically every organization. Occupa­
tional frauds fall into one of three major categories: asset misappropriations (e.g., stealing inventory), 
corruption (e.g., bribing government officials), and fraudulent financial statements (e.g., intentionally 
overstating assets in order to receive a bank loan). All three types of potential fraud are of concern to 
auditors but financial statement fraud typically represents the gravest concern because the amounts 
involved are often highly material.

42	
Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
considered as a form of consulting services. One example of this type of service is PrimePlus©, 
which involves CPAs providing assurance to family members that elderly parents or other fam­
ily members are being cared for properly, their assets and expenses are being managed appro­
priately, and financial predators are not taking advantage of them. Assurance services provided 
by CPAs are governed by either the attest or consulting standards. Chapter 21 provides more 
detailed information on assurance services.
Other Nonaudit Services
In addition to audit, attest, and assurance services, many public accounting firms perform three 
other broad categories of nonaudit services. Note that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act prohibits exter­
nal auditors from providing many forms of nonaudit assurance and consulting work to public 
companies for which the auditor also provides a financial statement audit (see Chapter 19).
Tax Preparation and Planning Services  Many public accounting firms have tax profes­
sionals that assist clients with preparing and filing tax returns, provide advice on tax and estate 
planning, and represent clients on tax issues before the Internal Revenue Service or tax courts.
Management Advisory Services  Management advisory services (MAS) involve provid­
ing advice and assistance concerning an entity’s organization, human resources, finances, 
operations, IT systems, or other activities. Due to independence requirements, CPA firms 
perform MAS primarily for private entities or for public companies for whom they do not 
provide a financial statement audit. Due to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, accounting and consult­
ing firms have experienced significant growth in the area of internal control consulting for 
nonaudit clients.
Compilation and Review Services  Public accounting firms perform a number of 
accounting-related services for their nonpublic or nonaudit clients. These services include 
bookkeeping, payroll processing, and preparing financial statements. When a public account­
ing firm provides nonaudit accounting services relating directly to the financial statements 
of companies, the services are known as compilations or reviews. These forms of services 
provide less assurance than a financial statement audit. Compilation and review services are 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 21.
Public Accounting Firms
Small organizations can be audited by a single auditor operating as the sole owner of a pub­
lic accounting firm. However, larger businesses and other organizations require significantly 
more resources than a single auditor can provide. Thus, public accounting firms range in size 
from a single proprietor to thousands of owners (or “partners”) together with tens of thou­
sands of professional and administrative staff employees. In addition to financial statement 
audits, public accounting firms typically offer a wide variety of professional services, includ­
ing many of those already discussed in this chapter.
Organization and Composition
Public accounting firms are organized as proprietorships, general or limited liability partner­
ships, or corporations. Typically, relatively small, local public accounting firms are organized 
as proprietorships, general partnerships, or corporations. Regional, national, and international 
accounting firms are normally structured as limited liability partnerships (LLPs). Structuring 
public accounting firms as proprietorships and ordinary general partnerships does not provide 
limited liability for the owners (known as partners). In such cases, aggrieved parties can seek 
recourse not only against the CPA firm’s assets but also against the personal assets of indi­
vidual partners.
LO 2-3

	
Chapter 2    The Financial Statement Auditing Environment	
43
Because of the risk of litigation against CPAs, public accounting firms typically organize 
as corporations when possible. However, corporations are created and governed by individ­
ual states, and some states do not allow accounting firms to organize as corporations. Thus, 
because they span state boundaries, it is generally not possible for larger firms to structure 
themselves as corporations. This is why large national and international public accounting 
firms have structured themselves as limited liability partnerships (LLPs). An LLP is gener­
ally governed by the laws applicable to general partnerships. However, this organizational 
structure provides greater personal protection against lawsuits. Under an LLP, partners are 
not personally responsible for liabilities arising from other partners’ and most employees’ 
negligent acts. However, the personal assets of the responsible partner(s) and the assets of the 
partnership itself are vulnerable to lawsuits resulting from partners’ or employees’ acts.
Public accounting firms are often categorized by size. For example, the largest firms are 
the “Big 4” public accounting firms: Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG, and PwC. These large 
international organizations have annual global revenues ranging from about $25 billion to 
over $34 billion. U.S. revenues for these firms range from $7 billion to over $14 billion. As a 
group, the Big 4 audit about 90 percent of publicly traded companies in the United States that 
have revenues between $500 million and $1 billion, and about 98 percent of public companies 
with annual sales greater than $1 billion.5
Following the Big 4 in size are several national firms with international affiliations. This 
“mid-tier” includes such firms as Grant Thornton, McGladrey, and BDO. The total global 
annual revenues for each of these firms are in the range of over $4 billion to about $7 billion. 
Last, there are thousands of regional and local CPA firms that have one or a few offices. These 
CPA firms provide audit, tax, accounting, and other services, generally to smaller entities.
Audits are usually conducted by teams of auditors. The typical audit team is composed 
of, in order of authority, a partner, a manager, one or two seniors, and several staff mem­
bers. Audit teams for large international entities are typically made up of several partners 
and managers and many seniors and staff. The lead engagement partner has the authority and 
decision-making responsibility for auditing matters, including the issuance of the audit report. 
Table 2–1 summarizes the duties performed by each member of the audit team.

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
Events taking place in the business world during the past decade have dramatically reshaped 
the environment in which external auditors work.
During the economic boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s, accounting firms aggres­
sively sought opportunities to market a variety of high-margin nonaudit services to the enti­
ties they audited. Independence standards in force at the time allowed auditors to perform 
many such services, including information systems design and implementation and internal 
audit services, even for public company auditees. The consulting revenue of the largest public 
accounting firms grew very rapidly, until in many instances consulting revenues from audi­
tees far exceeded the fee for the external audit.
In October 2001, Enron, one of the largest public companies in the United States, became 
the subject of an SEC investigation into its accounting practices. The investigation quickly 
uncovered massive financial deception that had been going on for several years. Arthur 
Andersen, the then “Big 5” public accounting firm that audited Enron’s financial statements, 
immediately became embroiled in the controversy, because the firm had failed to report the 
vast extent of Enron’s improper accounting. Many argued that this failure came about at least 
in part because Andersen was paid tens of millions of dollars in separate fees for consulting 
and internal auditing services, which amounted to significantly more than the fee for the exter­
nal audit. Andersen stopped providing audits of public companies and began to dismantle its 
business in August 2002, after the firm was federally indicted and subsequently convicted on 
charges of obstruction of justice relating to the Enron situation. Though the conviction was 
later overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, it was too late—the fatal damage had been done.
Shortly after the Enron incident, numerous other scandals involving corporate giants, 
brokerage firms, stock exchanges, mutual fund managers, and several of the large public 
accounting firms were uncovered. The Enron scandal alone weakened investor confidence 
in the stock market, but the subsequent series of scandals caused a crisis of confidence in the 
integrity of the entire system of public ownership and accountability in the United States.

Under pressure to restore public confidence, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Public 
Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act in July 2002. Similar to the impact 
of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (commonly known as SOX) 
started a process of broad reform in corporate governance practices that would affect the 
duties and practices of public companies, financial analysts, external auditors, and securities 
exchange markets.6
With respect to the accounting profession, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act effectively trans­
ferred authority to set and enforce auditing standards for public company audits to the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board (discussed in more detail below). In addition, the Act 
mandated that the SEC impose strict independence rules, prohibiting auditors from provid­
ing many types of nonaudit services to public company auditees. The Act imposed several 
other important mandates, including that audit firms rotate audit partners on audit engage­
ments every five years, and that public companies obtain an integrated audit (including 
audits of both financial statements and internal control over financial reporting). The Act is 
extremely important in its implications for boards and managements of public companies, for 
the accounting profession, and for the capital markets system in the United States. Chapter 20 
provides further discussion of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
More recently, the international financial crisis of 2007–2009 resulted in the passage 
of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Act

of the developments that gave rise to government regulation over the auditing profession.

Statement Auditors

significantly changed government regulation of many types of financial services compa­
nies, especially banks and other deposit-taking institutions. Dodd-Frank also amended the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act by granting authority to the PCAOB to inspect foreign audit firms that 
practice in the United States or that have U.S. auditees and by exempting public companies 
with under $75 million market capitalization from the requirement to submit to an audit of 
internal control over financial reporting (see Chapter 7 for more detail).
It would be difficult to overemphasize the impact of the events of the past 10 to 15 years 
on the auditing profession. While these changes caused pain and turmoil, they served to high­
light and reaffirm the essential importance of auditing in our economic system, as well as the 
importance of integrity and professionalism in protecting the public interest.
The Context of Financial Statement Auditing
The first chapter explained why assurance is in demand, defined what auditing is, and laid out 
the phases through which financial statement auditing is carried out. This chapter is designed 
to help you understand how business and professional contexts shape the environment in 
which external auditors operate. You’ve already learned about different kinds of auditors and 
audit services, public accounting firms, and the auditor’s role in society. Now let’s turn our 
attention to the primary context that shapes the external auditor’s environment: the business 
or entity being audited.
The Business Entity as the Primary Context of Auditing
In studying subsequent chapters, you will be building your auditing tool kit. How you apply 
auditing tools on any particular engagement will depend greatly on the nature of the entity’s 
business. For example, if you are auditing an Alaskan salmon farm, some of your concerns 
will be whether the entity’s inventories have been counted properly (which can be a real 
LO 2-6
Because financial statement audits play an important role in the functioning of our economy, 
society expects auditors to exercise due care in their work. Due professional care requires that 
the auditor exercise professional skepticism, which is an attitude that includes a questioning 
mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence.7 If the auditor fails to exercise due profes­
sional care, he or she can be held liable for civil damages or even criminal penalties.
Many readers of financial statements believe that auditors are ultimately responsible for 
the financial statements or at least that they have a responsibility to detect all errors, fraud, 
and illegal acts. This is simply not true. While auditors must exercise professional skepti­
cism and due care in their work, the financial statements ultimately are the responsibility of 
management. In fact, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that CEOs and CFOs of public 
companies take explicit responsibility for their company’s financial statements by “certify­
ing,” among other things, that they are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal 
control, and that the financial statements fairly present the entity’s financial conditions and 
operations. It is important to remember that while auditors have important responsibilities, 
management is primarily responsible for maintaining effective internal control and for ensur­
ing the fairness of the company’s financial statements.
The auditor’s responsibility to provide reasonable assurance with respect to errors, fraud, 
and illegal acts clearly shapes the auditor’s environment and the work that he or she performs. 
We will share more information on auditors’ responsibility for errors, fraud, and illegal acts 
in Chapters 3 and 4, and we provide details on auditors’ potential legal liability in Chapter 20.

challenge when the inventory consists of live fish in multiple large ocean pens!) and whether 
they are free of disease. Such inventory might not be properly valued on the entity’s financial 
records. If you are auditing an NBA team on the other hand, inventories won’t be a major 
issue. But you would certainly want to keep up on the ins-and-outs of player negotiations and 
contracts, and the dynamics of the free agent market! The point is that the context provided by 
the entity’s business greatly impacts the auditor and the audit and is thus a primary aspect of 
the environment in which financial statement auditing is conducted.
Practice 
INSIGHT
It has been said that no man can serve two masters. In some respects, this saying reflects the deli­
cate balance that the external auditor must achieve—working in close contact with and being paid 
by the entity while protecting the public. Prior to 2002, the external auditor often was engaged by 
and reported directly to the entity’s senior management, which was also responsible for the finan­
cial statements being audited. Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 mandates that the 
entity’s audit committee be directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of 
the work of the auditor. In addition, the auditor now reports directly to the audit committee. Further, 
Section 303 makes it unlawful for an officer or director to take any action to fraudulently influence, 
coerce, or manipulate the work or conclusions of the auditor.
A Model of Business
While businesses in different industries can have strikingly different characteristics, most have 
some fundamental conceptual characteristics in common. These commonalities provide a way 
for auditors to organize how they approach financial statement audits, regardless of the type 
of entity they are auditing. Figure 2–1 presents a fundamental, widely accepted model of busi­
ness, representing the central context in which auditors operate. The components of the model 
are governance, objectives, strategies, business processes, risks, controls, and reporting.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The nature of an auditee’s business can have a dramatic effect on the nature of the auditor’s work and 
work environment. For example, an auditor working at a meat-packing company will have very different 
experiences (with very different sights, sounds, and smells!) from an auditor working at a banking entity. 
Further, many auditors eventually specialize in certain industries and acquire significant expertise in 
those industries. This expertise and specialization often leads to attractive employment opportunities 
in industry, for example as a controller or CFO. Thus, in choosing which firm (or which office of a large 
firm) at which to seek a job, new auditors are well advised to carefully consider whether the firm (or 
office) has a significant presence in the industries in which the prospective auditor is most interested.
Corporate Governance
To form a business enterprise, entrepreneurs decide on an appropriate organizational form (e.g., 
corporation or partnership) and hire managers to manage the resources that have been made 
available to the enterprise through investment or lending. Due to the way resources are invested 
and managed in the modern business world, a system of corporate governance is necessary, 
through which managers are overseen and supervised. Simply defined, corporate governance 
consists of all the people, processes, and activities in place to help ensure proper stewardship 
over an entity’s assets. This is why in Figure 2–1 corporate governance runs along the entire 
right-hand side of the model. Strong corporate governance ensures that those managing an entity 
properly utilize their time, talents, and the entity’s resources in the best interest of absentee own­
ers, and that they faithfully report the economic condition and performance of the enterprise. The 
body primarily responsible for management oversight in U.S. corporations is the board of direc­
tors. The audit committee, consisting of a subset of the board, oversees the internal and external 
auditing work done for the organization. Through this link, and through the audit of financial 
statements, auditors play an important role in facilitating effective corporate governance.

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
Objectives, Strategies, Processes, Controls, Transactions, 
and Reports
As depicted at the center-top of Figure 2–1 and running down through the model, manage­
ment, with guidance and direction from the board of directors, decides on a set of objectives, 
along with strategies designed to achieve those objectives. The organization then undertakes 
certain processes in order to implement its strategies. The organization must also assess and 
manage risks that may threaten the achievement of its objectives. While the processes imple­
mented in business organizations are as varied as the different types of businesses themselves, 
most business enterprises establish processes that fit in five broad business process catego­
ries, sometimes known as business cycles. The five categories that characterize the processes 
of most businesses are the financing process, the purchasing process, the human resource 
management process, the inventory management process, and the revenue process. Each busi­
ness process involves a variety of important transactions.
As depicted around the inside edge of the circle in Figure 2–1, the enterprise designs 
and implements accounting information systems to capture the details of those transactions. 
It also designs and implements a system of internal control to ensure that the transactions are 
handled and recorded appropriately and that its resources are protected. The accounting infor­
mation system must be capable of producing financial reports, which summarize the effects 
of the organization’s transactions on its account balances and which are used to establish 
management accountability to outside owners (see bottom of Figure 2–1). The next section 
provides a brief overview of the five business process categories listed above. Auditors often 
rely on this process model to divide the audit of a business’s financial statements into manage­
able pieces. Chapters 10 through 16 go into considerable detail regarding how these business 
processes typically function and how they are used to organize an audit.
A Model of Business Processes: Five Components
At the center of Figure 2–1 are the five basic business processes into which auditors typically 
organize a financial statement audit. Let’s briefly discuss each of the five business processes.
The Financing Process  Businesses obtain capital through borrowing or soliciting invest­
ments from owners and typically invest in assets such as land, buildings, and equipment in 
accordance with their strategies. As part of this process, businesses also need to repay lenders 
and provide a return on owners’ investments. These types of transactions are all part of the 
financing process. Let’s illustrate using our example company, EarthWear Clothiers. Earth­
Wear tends not to rely on long-term debt financing. Instead, it primarily uses capital provided 
by shareholders to invest in long-term assets, such as its headquarters building, retail stores, 
and various order and distribution centers across the United States and in Japan, Germany, 
and the United Kingdom.
The Purchasing Process  Businesses must acquire goods and services to support their 
operations. For example, EarthWear purchases clothing from various wholesale suppliers to 
sell to its customers. The company must also purchase electrical power, office supplies, cus­
todial services, and other items to support its activities.
The Human Resource Management Process  Business organizations hire personnel 
to perform various functions in accordance with the enterprise’s mission and strategy. At 
EarthWear this process starts with the establishment of sound policies for hiring, training, 
evaluating, compensating, terminating, and promoting employees. The main transaction in 
this process that affects the financial statement accounts is a payroll transaction, which 
usually begins with an employee performing a job and ends with payment being made to 
the employee.
LO 2-7

	
Chapter 2    The Financial Statement Auditing Environment	
49
The Inventory Management Process  This process varies widely between different 
types of businesses. Manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers, including EarthWear, all typi­
cally have significant, numerous, and often complex transactions belonging to the inventory 
management process. While the transactions to purchase finished goods or raw materials 
inventories are included in the purchasing process, the inventory management process for 
a manufacturer includes such transactions as accumulating and allocating costs to inventory 
and making adjustments to record inventory at the lower of cost or market. Service providers 
(such as auditors, lawyers, or advertising agencies) rarely have significant inventories to man­
age, since their primary resources typically consist of information, knowledge, and the time 
and effort of people.
The Revenue Process  Businesses generate revenue through sales of goods or services 
to customers. They collect the proceeds of those sales in cash, either immediately or through 
collections on receivables. For example, EarthWear Inc. retails high-quality clothing for out­
door activities. To be successful, EarthWear must successfully process orders for, and deliver 
its clothing to, customers. It must also collect cash on those sales, either at the point of sale or 
through later billing and collection of receivables. Management establishes controls to ensure 
that sales and collection transactions are appropriately handled and recorded.
Relating the Process Components to the Business Model 
Stop and Think: Take another look at Figure 2–1. How might the components of our 
model differ for an entity in automobile manufacturing versus banking, and how might 
those differences affect the auditor’s work? How might differences in these components 
affect the risk of material misstatement in the financial statements?
Management engages in the five business processes discussed above to implement the 
organization’s strategies and achieve its objectives. Management then identifies risks, or pos­
sible threats to the achievement of its objectives (including compliance with applicable laws 
and regulations and reliable external reporting), and ensures that the organization’s system 
of internal control mitigates those risks to acceptable levels. The organization’s accounting 
information system must be capable of reliably measuring the performance of the business 
to assess whether objectives are being met and to comply with external reporting require­
ments. Financial statements, which are affected by all the different components of our busi­
ness model, represent an important output of the entity’s efforts to measure the organization’s 
performance and an important form of external reporting and accountability.
This discussion illustrates how important an entity’s business environment is to the work 
of a financial statement auditor. That’s why auditors must become expert not only in account­
ing and auditing but also in the businesses and industries in which their auditees operate. Next 
we’ll discuss the professional and regulatory organizations that play key roles in shaping the 
external auditing environment.
Organizations That Affect the Public Accounting 
Profession
A chapter on the environment of auditing wouldn’t be complete without a discussion of the 
professional and regulatory organizations that affect the practice of auditing by independent 
auditors. Figure 2–2 provides a representation of the relationship of these organizations to a 
financial statement audit conducted in the United States. The following subsections discuss 
the activities of four of these organizations plus two international standard-setting bodies.

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
The SEC is a federal government agency that administers the Securities Act of 1933, the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, among others. The 
Securities Act of 1933 regulates disclosure of material information in a registration statement 
for an initial public offering of securities. S forms, which are used for issuing the securities, 
contain the audited financial statements of the registrant. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 
regulates ongoing reporting by companies whose securities are listed and traded on a stock 
exchange or that possess assets greater than $10 million and its equity securities are held by 
500 or more persons. The most common documents encountered by auditors under the Secu­
rities Exchange Act of 1934 are the 10K, 10Q, and 8K. The 10K and 10Q are, respectively, 
annual and quarterly reports, which include the financial statements that are filed with the 
SEC by a publicly traded company. An 8K is filed whenever a significant event occurs that 
may be of interest to investors (such as the sale of a division or a change of auditor).
Because the SEC has responsibility and authority to oversee the establishment of account­
ing and auditing standards, the FASB, ASB, and PCAOB work closely with the SEC when 
formulating such standards.
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB)
The PCAOB describes itself as “a nonprofit corporation established by Congress to oversee 
the audits of public companies in order to protect the interests of investors and further the 
public interest in the preparation of informative, accurate and independent audit reports.” 
While the board is a nonprofit corporation, it is in reality a quasi-governmental regulatory 
agency overseen by the SEC. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 essentially transferred author­
ity for standard setting, inspection, investigation, and enforcement for public company audits 
from the profession (as represented by the AICPA) to the PCAOB. All public accounting 
firms providing audits for public companies are required to register with, pay fees to, and fol­
low the rules and standards of the PCAOB. As of March 2015, over 2,100 public accounting 
firms were registered with the PCAOB.
The PCAOB conducts a program of regular inspections to assess the degree of compli­
ance of registered public accounting firms with SOX, PCAOB, and SEC rules and profes­
sional standards. The PCAOB also has broad investigative and disciplinary authority over 
registered audit firms. However, the PCAOB does not have authority to set standards relating 
to the audits of entities that are not broker-dealers or publicly traded companies.
The PCAOB can impose sanctions on registered firms to deter possible recurrence of 
rule violations and to enhance the quality and reliability of future audits. The sanctions can 
range from revoking a firm’s registration or barring a particular individual from participating 
in audits of public companies to monetary penalties and requirements for remedial measures.
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA)
The AICPA is a private professional association of over 400,000 CPAs in 145 different coun­
tries. It performs a number of functions that directly bear on the activities of member CPAs. The 
most important of these functions is the promulgation of rules and standards that guide audit 
and related services provided to nonpublic companies; governmental entities such as states, 
counties, municipalities and school districts; and other entities such as universities and charities.
In addition to the Auditing Standards Board (ASB), which we’ll discuss later in this 
chapter, the AICPA houses several standing committees that issue professional rules and stan­
dards relevant to assurance providers. We list the most important of the standards here but 
we’ll discuss them in other chapters:
	
∙	 The Code of Professional Conduct (Chapter 19).
	
∙	 Quality control and peer review standards (Chapter 19).
	
∙	 Attestation standards (Chapter 21).
	
∙	 Compilation and review standards (Chapter 21).

52	
Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
In addition to its standard-setting role, the AICPA supports accounting and auditing 
research, produces a number of important publications, and provides a wide range of continu­
ing education programs. For example, the AICPA publishes the Journal of Accountancy, The 
Tax Advisor, various Auditing Research Monographs, Auditing Practice Releases, and Indus­
try Audit and Accounting Guides. The AICPA is responsible for preparing and grading the 
Uniform CPA Examination and plays an important role in administering the CPA certification 
in conjunction with the individual State Boards of Accountancy.
International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (IAASB)
The IAASB is sponsored and funded by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), 
which describes itself as “the global organization for the accountancy profession dedicated to 
serving the public interest by strengthening the profession and contributing to the develop­
ment of strong international economies.” IFAC was founded in 1977 and is based in New 
York City. In addition to the IAASB, IFAC houses independent standard-setting boards that 
develop international standards on ethics, education, and public sector accounting standards. 
The IAASB, whose predecessor organization was established in 1978, was reorganized and 
renamed to its current form in 2002, at about the time the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was passed 
in the United States. The IAASB issues International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and is 
the predominantly recognized international auditing standard setter outside the United States. 
The AICPA’s Auditing Standards Board recently completed a major project to converge its 
auditing standards with the IAASB’s standards to the extent possible, and these two sets of 
standards are largely similar.
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
The FASB is a privately funded body whose mission is to establish standards for financial 
accounting and reporting. You should already be familiar with the FASB from your financial 
accounting classes. The FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (or ASC) is recognized 
as the source of U.S. GAAP by the SEC, the PCAOB, and the AICPA.
An important group within the FASB is the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF). The 
EITF was established by the FASB to meet accountants’ needs for timely guidance on 
accounting practices and methods and to limit the number of issues requiring formal pro­
nouncements from the FASB. See the FASB’s website (www.fasb.org) for more information 
on the FASB’s activities.
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)
The IASB is the international counterpart to the FASB. The IASB’s standards are the predom­
inantly recognized accounting standards outside of the United States. The IASB is responsible 
for the development and publication of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), 
and for approving interpretations of IFRS. The IASB is sponsored and funded by the IFRS 
foundation, which is an independent, not-for-profit, private sector organization.
We won’t go into more detail here, but you should be aware that you are living in momen­
tous times in the history of the accounting profession, as the IASB and FASB engage in the 
complex and difficult task of attempting to converge international and U.S. financial account­
ing standards. This, of course, is highly relevant to auditors because these accounting stan­
dards serve as the criteria against which an entity’s financial statements are audited.
Auditing Standards
Auditing standards help to ensure that financial statement audits are conducted in a consistent 
and thorough manner to produce reliable opinions and serve as an important set of criteria 
for evaluating the quality of the auditor’s performance. As discussed earlier, three different 
LO 2-9, 2-10

	
Chapter 2    The Financial Statement Auditing Environment	
53
organizations set auditing standards that are relevant for financial statement auditors in the 
U.S. and internationally: the AICPA’s ASB, the U.S. PCAOB, and the IFAC’s IAASB.
Three Sets of Auditing Standards: The Roles of the ASB, PCAOB, 
and IAASB
Until 2003, the ASB was responsible for establishing all auditing standards in the United 
States. However, when the U.S. Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, it gave the 
PCAOB the authority to either set auditing standards for U.S. public company audits or to dele­
gate that role to another party. The PCAOB chose to take on the standard-setting role in-house. 
However, because it initially had no auditing standards of its own, the PCAOB adopted the 
ASB’s standards that existed as of April 2003 and labeled them “the interim standards of the 
PCAOB.” Since that time, the ASB has largely converged its auditing standards with interna­
tional standards but many of these changes have not been reflected in the PCAOB’s standards.
Accounting firms that audit the financial statements of nonpublic entities in the United 
States are required to comply with the auditing standards established by the ASB. Firms that 
audit the financial statements of public companies registered by the SEC in the United States 
are required to follow the auditing and related professional practice standards established by 
the PCAOB.
About the same time the PCAOB was created, the previous international auditing 
standard-setting body was reorganized and renamed as the International Auditing and Assur­
ance Standards Board. Over 100 countries now use the IAASB’s standards.
Let’s summarize the overall standard-setting picture from the perspective of various sized 
accounting firms operating in the United States. Smaller accounting firms that focus on audits 
of nonpublic company entities (including private businesses, universities, charities, city 
and county governments, and other governmental entities) adhere to ASB standards. Larger 
accounting firms in the Unites States that audit both nonpublic and public companies must 
ensure that they follow both ASB and PCAOB standards. Global accounting firms, which 
provide financial statement audits for nonpublic U.S. entities, U.S. public companies, and 
international companies around the world, must ensure that their audit approaches and meth­
odologies meet the requirements of all three standard setters.
Fortunately, the ASB and IAASB work closely together. In fact, the ASB recently com­
pleted a major effort to converge its standards to those of the IAASB, and thus the ASB and 
IAASB standards are now very similar. Firms that must apply ASB, IAASB, and PCAOB 
standards formulate their global audit methodologies and policies starting with IAASB stan­
dards and add specific requirements from the ASB and PCAOB standards as necessary. In this 
way, the global firms are able to apply a single audit methodology that is generally the same 
for audits of all entities around the world while ensuring that the additional requirements of 
the U.S. standard setters are met.
At this point you may be wondering which set of standards you will be learning in this 
book or whether, heaven forbid, you might have to learn all three. Not to worry—similar to 
the approach taken by the large, international accounting firms, you will learn a single set 
of foundational auditing concepts that apply to any type of entity. In this book we use the 
U.S. ASB standards as a foundation and build in any requirements from PCAOB standards 
that are more stringent than ASB requirements. Because the IAASB and ASB standards are 
largely converged, you will also be acquiring a solid understanding of auditing concepts and 
standards used internationally. The bottom line is that the concepts you will learn in this book 
encompass the requirements of all three standard setters and are consistent with the audit poli­
cies and methodologies of the world’s leading accounting firms.
The 10 Generally Accepted Auditing Standards
The ASB first issued what are known as the 10 generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS) 
in 1947 and periodically modified them to reflect changes in the auditor’s environment. The 
PCAOB adopted these standards in 2003, and refers to them, together with its own standards, 

54	
Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
as “the standards of the PCAOB.” The 10 generally accepted auditing standards are composed 
of three categories of standards: general standards (three), standards of field work (three), and 
standards of reporting (four). Exhibit 2–2 contains the 10 generally accepted auditing stan­
dards as they currently appear in PCAOB standards.
Three General Standards  The three general standards deal with the auditor’s qualifica­
tions and the quality of his or her work. These standards will remind you of the characteristics 
of a reliable house inspector listed in Chapter 1. The first general standard recognizes that an 
auditor must have adequate training and proficiency. This is gained through formal education, 
continuing education programs, and experience. Auditors should stay current with the latest 
accounting and auditing pronouncements and with developments in the business world that 
may affect the entities that they audit.
The second general standard requires that the auditor maintain an attitude of indepen­
dence on an engagement. Independence precludes relationships that may impair the audi­
tor’s objectivity. An auditor must not only be independent in fact (i.e., actually be objective) 
but also avoid actions or relationships that may appear to affect independence. If an auditor 
is perceived as lacking independence, users may lose confidence in the auditor’s ability to 
report truthfully on financial statements. The AICPA’s Code of Professional Conduct and the 
SEC’s independence regulations identify a number of relationships (such as having business 
or financial interests in entities that they audit or providing certain types of consulting ser­
vices) that are believed to impair the auditor’s appearance of independence and that are thus 
prohibited.
Due professional care is the focus of the third general standard. In simple terms, due care 
means that the auditor plans and performs his or her duties with the skill and care that is com­
monly expected of accounting professionals.
Three Standards of Field Work  The standards of field work relate to the actual conduct 
of the audit. These three standards provide the conceptual background for the audit process 
(and will remind you of some of the desirable characteristics of a house inspection service). 
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (PCAOB)
General Standards
	1.	 The audit is to be performed by a person or persons having adequate technical training and proficiency as an auditor.
	2.	 In all matters relating to the assignment, an independence in mental attitude is to be maintained by the auditor or auditors.
	3.	 Due professional care is to be exercised in the performance of the audit and the preparation of the report.
Standards of Field Work
	1.	 The work is to be adequately planned and assistants, if any, are to be properly supervised.
	2.	 A sufficient understanding of internal control is to be obtained to plan the audit and to determine the nature, timing, and extent of tests 
to be performed.
	3.	 Sufficient appropriate evidential matter is to be obtained through inspection, observation, inquiries, and confirmations to afford a rea­
sonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements under audit.
Standards of Reporting
	1.	 The report shall state whether the financial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
(GAAP).
	2.	 The report shall identify those circumstances in which such principles have not been consistently observed in the current period in rela­
tion to the preceding period.
	3.	 Informative disclosures in the financial statements are to be regarded as reasonably adequate unless otherwise stated in the report.
	4.	 The report shall contain either an expression of opinion regarding the financial statements, taken as a whole, or an assertion to the 
effect that an opinion cannot be expressed. When an overall opinion cannot be expressed, the reasons therefore should be stated. In 
all cases where an auditor’s name is associated with financial statements, the report should contain a clear-cut indication of the char­
acter of the auditor’s work, if any, and the degree of responsibility the auditor is taking.

The first standard of field work deals with planning and supervision. Proper planning leads 
to a more effective audit that is more likely to detect material misstatements and facilitates 
completing the engagement in a reasonable amount of time. This standard also requires that 
assistants on the engagement be properly supervised.
The second standard of field work requires that the auditor gain a sufficient understand­
ing of the entity’s internal control to effectively plan the nature, timing, and extent of fur­
ther audit procedures. In this context, nature refers to what procedures are performed, timing 
refers to when the audit work is done (whether at interim or at period-end), and extent refers 
to how much work is done. Taken together, the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures 
are referred to in practice as the “scope” of the audit procedures. If the auditor identifies areas 
of weakness in an entity’s internal control, this information can help the auditor focus on areas 
where misstatements may be more likely to occur.
Sufficient, appropriate evidence is the focus of the third field work standard. Most of the 
auditor’s work involves the search for and evaluation of evidence regarding management’s 
assertions in the financial statements. The auditor uses various audit procedures to gather this 
evidence. You should be aware that auditing standards typically give general guidance; the 
point at which the evidence for a particular management assertion is sufficient and appropri­
ate generally is a matter of professional judgment.
Four Standards of Reporting  The four standards of reporting require that the auditor 
consider each of the following issues before rendering an audit report: (1) whether the finan­
cial statements are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
(2) whether those principles are consistently applied; (3) whether all appropriate disclosures 
have been made; and (4) what degree of responsibility the auditor is taking, as well as the 
character of the auditor’s work. We gave an overview of the nature of the auditor’s report in 
Chapter 1, and will offer further detail in Chapter 18.
Principles Underlying an Audit Conducted in Accordance with 
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards
The 10 GAAS were originally developed by the ASB and for decades served as the frame­
work for codifying (i.e., organizing) the SASs into AU sections. However, as part of improv­
ing clarity and converging with international standards, the ASB replaced the 10 GAAS 
with a more comprehensive and coherent description of “the principles underlying an audit 
conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.” These principles are 
grouped into four categories: the purpose and premise of an audit, personal responsibilities of 
the auditor, auditor actions in performing the audit, and reporting. Thus, while the PCAOB 
at least for now retains the 10 GAAS as part of its standards, the 10 GAAS are included in 
neither the international standards issued by the IAASB nor the newly converged and clarified 
ASB standards.
Exhibit 2–3 contains the full text of the principles underlying an audit. Take a few 
moments to familiarize yourself with this new conceptualization of generally accepted audit­
ing standards. You will note that the principles underlying an audit include all of the key con­
cepts conveyed in the 10 GAAS, but do so in a more organized and coherent manner. They also 
address other key concepts that are not addressed in the 10 GAAS, such as explicitly identify­
ing the fundamental purpose of an audit and management’s responsibilities.
Statements on Auditing Standards and the AU Codification
Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS) are issued by the ASB. The SAS are considered to 
be minimum standards of performance for auditors. Standards issued by the PCAOB, on the 
other hand, are called “Auditing Standards” (AS). The AS issued by the PCAOB add to or 
modify the existing body of standards that the PCAOB adopted from the ASB in April 2003. 
As mentioned previously, standards issued by the IAASB are called International Standards 
on Auditing (ISA). The ASB’s newly rewritten SAS are very similar to the ISA as a result of 
the ASB’s clarity and convergence project.

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
Principles Underlying an Audit Conducted in Accordance with Generally 
Accepted Auditing Standards
Purpose of an Audit and Premise upon which an Audit is Conducted
	1.	 The purpose of an audit is to provide financial statement users with an opinion by the auditor on 
whether the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with the 
applicable financial reporting framework. An auditor’s opinion enhances the degree of confidence that 
intended users can place in the financial statements.
	2.	 An audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards is conducted on the premise that 
management and, where appropriate, those charged with governance, have responsibility
	
a.	 for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordance with the appli­
cable financial reporting framework; this includes the design, implementation, and maintenance 
of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements that are 
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; and
	
b.	 to provide the auditor with
	
i.	 all information, such as records, documentation, and other matters that are relevant to the 
preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements;
	
ii.	 any additional information that the auditor may request from management and, where appro­
priate, those charged with governance; and
	
iii.	 unrestricted access to those within the entity from whom the auditor determines it necessary to 
obtain audit evidence.
Responsibilities
	3.	 Auditors are responsible for having appropriate competence and capabilities to perform the audit; 
complying with relevant ethical requirements; and maintaining professional skepticism and exercising 
professional judgment, throughout the planning and performance of the audit.
Performance
	4.	 To express an opinion, the auditor obtains reasonable assurance about whether the financial state­
ments as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
	5.	 To obtain reasonable assurance, which is a high, but not absolute, level of assurance, the auditor
 
• plans the work and properly supervises any assistants.
 
• determines and applies appropriate materiality level or levels throughout the audit.
 
• identifies and assesses risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, based on an 
understanding of the entity and its environment, including the entity’s internal control.
 
• obtains sufficient appropriate audit evidence about whether material misstatements exist, through 
designing and implementing appropriate responses to the assessed risks.
	6.	 The auditor is unable to obtain absolute assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement because of inherent limitations, which arise from
 
• the nature of financial reporting;
 
• the nature of audit procedures; and
 
• the need for the audit to be conducted within a reasonable period of time and so as to achieve a 
balance between benefit and cost.
Reporting
	7.	 Based on an evaluation of the audit evidence obtained, the auditor expresses, in the form of a writ­
ten report, an opinion in accordance with the auditor’s findings, or states that an opinion cannot be 
expressed. The opinion states whether the financial statements are presented fairly, in all material 
respects, in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework.

Unlike financial accounting pronouncements, which usually provide very specific 
rules, the SAS and the AS tend to be relatively general in nature. The auditor must apply 
due diligence and sound professional judgment given the particular circumstances of the 
engagement in conducting an audit. Keep in mind that the auditor never has sufficient evi­
dence to “guarantee” that the financial statements do not contain material misstatements 
and must use judgment to determine when he or she has sufficient appropriate evidence to 
reach a justified conclusion.

	
Chapter 2    The Financial Statement Auditing Environment	
57
Each SAS specifies one or more objectives that provide a link between the specific 
requirements of the SAS and the overall objectives of the auditor, as laid out in the Principles 
Underlying an Audit. ASB and PCAOB auditing standards include requirements that convey 
varying levels of auditor responsibility. The words “must,” “shall,” and “is required” indi­
cate unconditional responsibilities with which the auditor must comply. The word “should” 
indicates a responsibility to comply unless the auditor decides on alternative actions that are 
sufficient to achieve the objectives of the requirement. Finally, the words “may,” “might,” and 
“could” describe actions and procedures that auditors have a responsibility to consider.
SAS are classified by two numbering categories: SAS and AU numbers (“AU” for Audit­
ing Standards). The SAS numbering applies to the order in which the standards are issued by 
the ASB and are thus chronological. The SAS are then reorganized or “codified” by topical 
content, closely following the structure of the Principles Underlying an Audit Performed in 
Accordance with GAAS. The summary below shows how the SAS are reorganized into the 
ASB’s new “clarity standard” AU codification scheme:

Special Considerations
A major complication for auditors going forward is the development of two different 
sets of U.S. auditing standards as the PCAOB standards diverge from those it adopted from 
the ASB and as the ASB converges its own standards with those of the IAASB. While ASB 
and PCAOB standards are still reasonably similar in most respects, their standards continue 
to diverge and their AU codification schemes are not consistent with each other. We believe 
such a development greatly and unnecessarily complicates the auditing standards environ­
ment. The widespread use of international auditing standards in countries outside the United 
States further complicates the environment for large public accounting firms that practice 
internationally.8
8See S. Glover, D. Prawitt, and M. Taylor, “Audit Standard Setting and Inspection for U.S. Public Companies:  
A Critical Assessment and Recommendations for Fundamental Change,” Accounting Horizons, vol. 23, no. 2, 2009.
Ethics, Independence, and the Code of Professional 
Conduct
As indicated by the second general standard and item number 3 of the Principles Underlying 
an Audit Performed in Accordance with GAAS, ethical behavior and independence on the part 
of the auditor are vital to the audit function. The demand for auditing arises from the need for 
a competent, independent person to monitor the contractual arrangements between principal 
and agent. If an auditor is incompetent or lacks independence, the parties to the contract will 
place little or no value on the audit.
Ethics refers to a system or code of conduct based on moral duties and obligations that 
indicate how we should behave. Professionalism refers to the conduct, aims, or qualities that 
characterize a profession or professional person.9 All professions (e.g., medicine, law, and 
accounting) operate under some type of code of ethics or code of conduct. The AICPA’s 
Code of Professional Conduct establishes guidance for acceptable behavior for auditors. 
The Code of Professional Conduct contains principles, rules of conduct, and interpretations 
of the rules of conduct. A major portion of the Code identifies actions that may impair audi­
tors’ independence.

Part 1    Introduction to Assurance and Financial Statement Auditing
The AICPA’s Code of Professional Conduct applies to all auditors, including those audit­
ing public companies. Why? Because the SEC requires that the auditor signing an audit report 
for a public company be a CPA, and the courts have consistently held CPAs to the standards of 
conduct established by the Code. Further, the Code of Professional Conduct has been adopted 
into the laws of many of the individual states and was also adopted by the PCAOB in 2003. 
Thus, the Code is an important element of the environment in which auditors work.
Auditors are frequently faced with situations that may test their professionalism, ethical 
character, and independence. For example, auditors’ independence is tested when auditees 
engage in opinion shopping—that is, when an auditee seeks the views of other CPAs, hoping 
to find an auditor who will agree with the entity’s desired accounting treatment. Chapter 19 
contains an in-depth discussion of professional ethics and the Code of Professional Conduct.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Auditor independence was emphasized in the 1933 Senate Banking Hearings on proposed secu­
rities laws when, like in 2002, social responsibility and public confidence were on the minds of 
the members of Congress. Colonel Arthur Carter, then managing partner of Haskins & Sells (now 
Deloitte & Touche LLP) and president of the New York State Society of CPAs, appeared before the 
Senate Banking Committee and emphasized that the accountants that audit the financial statements 
of public companies should be independent (U.S. Congress, Senate Banking Hearings, 1933).
Conclusion
Chapter 1 introduced the concept of assurance and discussed the basics of financial statement 
auditing. This chapter explains the broader context in which financial statement auditing takes 
place. To fully understand auditing, you must be aware of the factors that shape the auditing 
environment, including the general economic and business environment, the characteristics 
of the entity’s particular business and industry, and the standards, social responsibilities, and 
codes of conduct that guide the financial statement auditor’s work. You must also understand 
the nature of public accounting firms within which auditors conduct audits of businesses and 
other entities of various sizes, and you should be aware of the outside professional, regulatory, 
and standard-setting bodies that directly impact how auditing is done. This chapter provides 
an introduction to these elements of the complex and ever-changing environment in which 
financial statement auditing is performed.
As you can see from reading the first two chapters of this book, the tasks, assessments, 
and evaluations that auditors perform require a great deal of professional judgment. In fact, 
judgment is so important, you may often find your instructor very correctly answering ques­
tions in class with “it depends” or “that is a matter of professional judgment.” The good news 
is that professional judgment is a skill that can be learned and improved with knowledge and 
practice. To help you learn what good professional judgment looks like, as well as how to rec­
ognize and avoid common threats to good judgment, we have provided an advanced module 
at the end of this book titled “Professional Judgment Framework.” This framework is adapted 
from the award-winning framework that two of the authors of this book helped KPMG, LLP 
to formulate and implement in its U.S. audit practice.
KEY TERMS
Audit committee. A committee consisting of members of the board of directors, charged 
with overseeing the entity’s system of internal control over financial reporting, internal and 
external auditors, and the financial reporting process. Members typically must be independent 
of management.

	
Chapter 2    The Financial Statement Auditing Environment	
59
Board of directors. Persons elected by the stockholders of a corporation to oversee manage­
ment and to direct the affairs of the corporation.
Business processes. Processes implemented by management to achieve entity objectives. 
Business processes are typically organized into the following categories: financing processes, 
purchasing, human resource management, inventory management, and revenue.
Code of Professional Conduct. A set of principles, rules, and interpretations that establish 
guidance for acceptable behavior for accountants and auditors.
Corporate governance. The oversight mechanisms in place to help ensure the proper stew­
ardship over an entity’s assets. Management and the board of directors play primary roles, and 
the independent auditor plays a key facilitating role.
Ethics. A system or code of conduct based on moral duties and obligations that indicates how 
an individual should behave.
Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Accounting principles that are gener­
ally accepted for the preparation of financial statements in the United States. GAAP stan­
dards are currently issued primarily by the FASB, with oversight and influence by the SEC. 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) are set by the International Accounting 
Standards Board.
Generally accepted auditing standards (GAAS). Ten broad statements guiding the conduct 
of financial statement auditing. The 10 GAAS are still found in PCAOB standards but they 
have been replaced in the ASB standards by the “Principles Underlying an Audit Conducted 
in Accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards.”
Illegal acts. Violations of laws or government regulations.
Independence. A state of objectivity in fact and in appearance, including the absence of any 
significant conflicts of interest.
Integrated audit. An audit of both financial statements and internal control over financial 
reporting, provided by the external auditor. Required for public companies.
International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Statements issued by IFAC’s International 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.
Management advisory services. Consulting services that may provide advice and assis­
tance concerning an entity’s organization, personnel, finances, operations, systems, or other 
activities.
Principles Underlying an Audit Performed in Accordance with GAAS. The ASB replaced 
the 10 Generally Accepted Auditing Standards with these Principles, organized into four 
parts: Purpose of an Audit and Premise upon which an Audit is Conducted, Auditor Respon­
sibilities, Audit Performance, and Audit Reporting.
Public accounting firm. An organization created to provide professional accounting-related 
services, including auditing. Usually formed as a proprietorship or as a form of partnership.
Standards (AS) of the PCAOB. Standards regarding the conduct of financial statement 
audits for public companies. Currently consist of a mix of standards and statements estab­
lished by the ASB, as these statements and standards were adopted by the PCAOB in 2003 
on an interim basis, together with Auditing Standards (AS) issued by the PCAOB since 2003.
Statements on Auditing Standards (SAS). Statements issued by the AICPA’s Auditing 
Standards Board.

application. Jones immediately accepted the engagement and agreed to provide an 
auditor’s report within one month. Boucher agreed to pay Jones her normal audit fee 
plus a percentage of the loan if it was granted.
	
	
	 	
Jones hired two recent accounting graduates to conduct the audit and spent sev­
eral hours telling them exactly what to do. She told the new hires not to spend time 
reviewing the entity’s system of internal control but to concentrate on proving 
the mathematical accuracy of the general and subsidiary ledgers and summarizing 
the data in the accounting records that supported Boucher’s financial statements. 
The new hires followed Jones’s instructions and after two weeks gave Jones the 
financial statements excluding footnotes. Jones reviewed the statements and pre­
pared an unqualified auditor’s report. The report did not refer to generally accepted 
accounting principles, and no audit procedures were conducted to verify the year-
to-year application of such principles.
Required:
	
a.	 Briefly describe each of the generally accepted auditing standards and indicate 
how the action(s) of Jones resulted in a failure to comply with each of the 10 gen­
erally accepted auditing standards.
	
b.	 Briefly describe the four categories of Principles Underlying an Audit Conducted

2-26	 Terri Harrison, CPA, has discussed various reporting considerations with CFOs 
from three of the entities she audits. The three CFOs presented the following situa­
tions and asked how they would affect the audit report.
	
a.	 One of the entities has changed its depreciation method on its machinery from 
straight line to double declining balance. Both Harrison and the entity agree 
that the new depreciation method better reflects the usage of the machinery in 
the manufacturing process. The entity agrees with Harrison that the change is 
material but claims that it needs disclosure only in the “Summary of Signifi­
cant Accounting Policies” footnote to the financial statements, not in Harrison’s 
report.
	
b.	 The second entity has a loan agreement that restricts the amount of cash divi­
dends that can be paid and requires the maintenance of a particular current ratio. 
The entity is in compliance with the terms of the agreement, and it is not likely 
that there will be a violation in the foreseeable future. The entity believes there is 
no need to mention the restriction in the financial statements because such men­
tion might mislead the readers.
	
c.	 The third entity correctly accounted for the acquisition of a majority-owned 
domestic subsidiary when that transaction occurred but did not properly pres­
ent the minority interest in retained earnings or net income of the subsidiary in 
the consolidated financial statements. The entity agrees with Harrison that the 
minority interest presented in the consolidated financial statements is materially 
misstated but takes the position that the minority shareholders of the subsidiary 
should look to that subsidiary’s financial statements for information concerning 
their interest therein.
Required:
Each of the situations presented relates to one of the four generally accepted auditing 
standards of reporting. Identify and describe the applicable generally accepted audit­
ing standard of reporting in each situation, and discuss how the particular entity’s 
situation relates to the standard.

DISCUSSION CASES
	
LO 2-2, 2-10, 2-12	
2-27	 Part I: Merry-Go-Round (MGR), a clothing retailer located primarily in shopping 
malls, was founded in 1968.10 By the early 1990s, the company had gone public and 
had expanded to approximately 1,500 stores, 15,000 employees, and $1 billion in 
annual sales. The company’s locations in malls targeted the youth and teen market. 
The company was listed by Forbes magazine as one of the top 25 companies in the 
late 1980s. However, in the early 1990s, the company faced many challenges. One of 
its cofounders died, and the other left to pursue unrelated business interests. The 
company faced stiff competition from other retailers (e.g., The Gap and Banana 
Republic), fashion trends changed, and mall traffic declined. Sales fell, and experts 
speculated that MGR failed to anticipate key industry trends and lost sight of its cus­
tomer market. To try to regain its strong position, the company acquired Chess King, 
Inc., a struggling chain of men’s clothing stores located in malls, in 1993.
	
	
	 	
The company’s sales continued to fall, and later in 1993 the company brought 
back one of its cofounders to manage the company and wrote down a significant 
amount of inventory. However, this inventory write-down caused the company 
to violate loan covenants. Facing bankruptcy, the company, based on the advice 
of its newly hired law firm Swidler and Berlin, hired turnaround specialists from 
Ernst and Young (E&Y) to help overcome the financial crisis and develop a long-
term business plan. However, the company’s decline continued, and it filed for 
Chapter 11 reorganization in 1994. In 1996, the remaining assets were sold for pen­
nies on the dollar.
	
	
	 	
Subsequently, a group of 9,000 creditors (including former employees and stock­
holders) began litigation against parties it deemed responsible for their losses. These 
parties included E&Y, which the creditors sued for $4 billion in punitive and com­
pensatory damages (E&Y’s fees from MGR totaled $4.5 million).
	
	
	 	
The lawsuit alleged that E&Y’s incompetence was the main cause of MGR’s 
decline and demise. The lawsuit alleged in part that
	
∙	 The turnaround team did not act quickly enough.
	
∙	 The leader of the team took an eight-day vacation at a critical point during the 
engagement.
	
∙	 The cost-cutting strategy called for only $11 million in annual savings, despite the 
fact that the company was projected to lose up to $200 million in 1994.
	
∙	 While closing unprofitable stores was key to MGR’s survival, by 1995 only 230 
of 1,434 stores had been closed and MGR still operated two stores in some malls.
	
∙	 The turnaround team included inexperienced personnel—a retired consultant, a 
partner with little experience in the United States or with retail firms in general, 
and two recent college graduates.
	
∙	 E&Y charged exorbitant hourly rates and charged unreasonable expenses (e.g., 
charges included reimbursement for a dinner for three of the consultants totaling 
in excess of $200).
	
	
	 	
E&Y denied any wrongdoing but in April 1999 agreed to pay $185 million to 
settle with the injured parties.
Required:
	
a.	 Although this was not an audit engagement for E&Y, some of the allegations 
against the firm can be framed in terms of the 10 generally accepted auditing 
standards. Which of the 10 GAAS was E&Y alleged to have violated?
10The following articles were sources for the information in the case: E. MacDonald, “Ernst & Young Will Pay  
$185 Million to Settle Claims of Merry-Go-Round,” The Wall Street Journal, April 29, 1999, and E. McDonald and 
S. J. Paltrow, “Merry-Go-Round: Ernst & Young Advised the Client, but Not about Everything—It Didn’t Reveal 
Business Ties Alleged to Pose Conflict with Its Consulting Job—Settlement for $185 Million,” The Wall Street  
Journal, August 8, 1999, p. A1.

b.	 Although this was not an audit engagement for E&Y, some of the allegations 
against the firm can be framed in terms of the Principles Underlying an Audit 
Conducted in Accordance with Generally Accepted Auditing Standards. Which 
of the Principles was E&Y alleged to have violated?
	
c.	 Should there be specific professional standards for CPAs who consult? Given 
that non-CPAs who consult do not have formal professional standards, describe 
the advantages and disadvantages that result from CPAs being subject to such 
standards.
	
LO 2-12	
2-28	 Part II: Merry-Go-Round. Additional charges made against E&Y included the fol­
lowing (recall that MGR hired E&Y for turnaround consulting services):
	
∙	 E&Y had a close relationship with Rouse Co., one of MGR’s primary landlords 
(E&Y was soliciting business from Rouse and provided significant tax services).
	
∙	 Swidler (the law firm that recommended E&Y to MGR) and E&Y had partici­
pated in at least 12 different business arrangements, some of which resulted in 
Swidler receiving significant fees from E&Y.
	
∙	 E&Y did not disclose either of these relationships to MGR.
Required:
	
a.	 Do you think that E&Y acted unethically, given that it had these relationships?
	
b.	 How could these relationships have affected E&Y’s advice to MGR? In other 
words, refer to the charges above and speculate as to whether any of the alleged 
wrong-doings by E&Y may have stemmed from the relationships described above.

Audit Planning, Types of Audit 
Tests, and Materiality
P
lanning an audit includes establishing the overall audit strategy for the 
engagement and developing an audit plan, which includes risk assess­
ment procedures and planned audit responses to the risks of material 
misstatement. If the audit is not properly planned, the auditor may issue an 
incorrect audit report or conduct an inefficient audit. The audit starts with the 
initial appointment or reappointment of the auditor by the entity or audit com­
mittee. Next, the auditor performs a number of activities that go into develop­
ing an overall audit strategy.
This chapter covers the following phases of the audit identified in 
Chapter 1, Figure 1–4:
•  Client acceptance and continuance.
•  Preliminary engagement activities.
•  Planning the audit.
It then covers the major types of audit tests and the concept of materiality.

Major Phases of an Audit

70	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
The first phase of the audit process that relates to audit planning is client acceptance and 
continuance (see Figure 3–1). The extent of effort that goes into evaluating a new client is 
normally much greater than the decision to continue with an existing client. With a continuing 
client the auditor possesses extensive knowledge about the entity and its environment.
Prospective Client Acceptance
A public accounting firm should investigate a prospective client prior to accepting the engage­
ment. Table 3–1 lists procedures that a firm might conduct to evaluate a prospective client. 
Performance of such procedures would normally be documented in a memo or by completion 
of an entity acceptance questionnaire or checklist.
When the prospective client has previously been audited, the successor auditor makes 
certain inquiries of the predecessor auditor before accepting the engagement. The successor 
auditor should request permission of the prospective client before contacting the predecessor 
auditor. Because the Code of Professional Conduct does not allow an auditor to disclose con­
fidential client information without the entity’s consent, the prospective client must authorize 
the predecessor auditor to respond to the successor’s requests for information. The successor 
auditor should make the following inquiries of the predecessor auditor:
	
∙	 Information that might bear on the integrity of management.
	
∙	 Disagreements with management about accounting policies, auditing procedures, 
or other similarly significant matters.
	
∙	 Communications to those charged with governance regarding fraud and 
noncompliance with laws or regulations by the entity.
	
∙	 Communications to management and those charged with governance regarding 
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in internal control.
	
∙	 The predecessor auditor’s understanding about the reasons for the change of 
auditors.
Such inquiries of the predecessor auditor may help the successor auditor determine 
whether to accept the engagement. The predecessor auditor should respond fully to the

successor’s requests unless an unusual circumstance (such as a lawsuit) exists. If the predeces­
sor’s response is limited, the successor auditor must be informed that the response is limited.
In the unusual case where the prospective client refuses to permit the predecessor to 
respond, the successor auditor should have reservations about accepting the entity. Such a 
situation raises serious questions about management’s motivations and integrity. In addition, 
if the entity has unusual business risks such as possible going concern issues, the auditor is 
not likely to accept the prospective client because the engagement risk may be too high.
After accepting the engagement, the successor auditor may need information on begin­
ning balances and consistent application of GAAP in order to issue an unqualified report. The 
successor auditor should request that the entity authorize the predecessor auditor to permit a 
review of his or her working papers. In most instances, the predecessor auditor will allow the 
successor auditor to make copies of any working papers of continuing interest (for example, 
details of selected balance sheet accounts).
If the entity has not previously been audited, the public accounting firm should com­
plete all the procedures listed in Table 3–1. The auditor should review the prospective client’s 
financial information and carefully assess management integrity by communicating with the 
entity’s bankers and attorneys, as well as other members of the business community. Many 
public accounting firms have full-time staff that complete background checks and monitor 
news of public clients.
Client Continuance
Public accounting firms should evaluate periodically whether to continue their relationship 
with current clients. This evaluation may take place at or near the completion of an audit or 
when some significant event occurs. Conflicts over accounting and auditing issues or disputes 
over fees may lead a public accounting firm to disassociate itself from the entity. See Internet 
Assignment 3-34.
Procedures for Evaluating a Prospective Client
	1.	 Obtain and review available financial information (annual reports, interim financial statements, income tax returns, etc.).
	2.	Inquire of third parties about any information concerning the integrity of the prospective client and its management. (Such inquiries should be directed 
to the prospective client’s bankers and attorneys, credit agencies, and other members of the business community who may have such knowledge.)
	3.	Consider whether the prospective client has any circumstances that will require special attention or that may represent unusual business or audit risks, 
such as litigation or going concern issues.
	4.	Determine if the firm is independent of the entity and able to provide the desired service.
	5.	Determine if the firm has the necessary technical skills and knowledge of the industry to complete the engagement.
	6.	Determine if acceptance of the entity would violate any applicable regulatory agency requirements or the Code of Professional Conduct.
T A B L E  3 – 1
Preliminary Engagement Activities
There are generally three preliminary engagement activities: (1) determining the audit 
engagement team requirements, (2) ensuring that the audit team and audit firm are in compli­
ance with ethical and independence requirements, and (3) establishing an understanding with 
the entity.
Determine the Audit Engagement Team Requirements
Public accounting firms need to ensure that their engagements are completed by auditors 
having the proper degree of technical training and proficiency given the circumstances of 
the entity. Factors that should be considered in determining staffing requirements include 
engagement size and complexity, level of risk, any special expertise, personnel availability, 
and timing of the work to be performed. For example, if the engagement involves a high 
LO 3-2

72	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
level of risk, the firm should staff the engagement with more experienced auditors. Simi­
larly, if the audit involves a specialized industry (banking, insurance, and so on) or if the 
entity uses sophisticated IT processing or holds financial instruments, the firm must ensure 
that members of the audit team possess the requisite expertise. Generally, a time budget for 
planned work is prepared in order to assist with the staffing requirements and to schedule 
the fieldwork.
Stop and Think: Suppose an entity held financial instruments (i.e., derivatives) that 
are accounted for using fair value accounting. What type of expertise would the audit 
team need?
Assess Compliance with Ethical and Independence 
Requirements
A public accounting firm should establish policies and procedures to ensure that persons at 
all organizational levels within the firm meet the profession’s ethical requirements (QC 10), 
including maintaining independence in accordance with the Code of Professional Conduct 
(see Chapter 19). A firm should document compliance with this policy by having all per­
sonnel complete an annual independence questionnaire. This questionnaire requests infor­
mation about the auditor’s financial or business relationships with the firm’s clients. Under 
certain circumstances, family members’ financial or business relationships are attributable to 
the auditor. For example, if the spouse of an auditor participating in an engagement were an 
accounting supervisor for the entity, independence would be considered impaired.
At the engagement level, the partner-in-charge should ensure that all individuals assigned 
to the engagement are independent of the entity. This can be accomplished by reviewing the 
annual independence reports for each member of the audit team or through the firm’s inde­
pendent database.
Another area of concern related to independence is unpaid client fees. If an account 
receivable from an entity takes on the characteristics of a loan, the auditor’s independence 
may be impaired. Many public accounting firms adopt a policy of not completing the current 
audit until all of the prior year’s fees have been paid.
Finally, the CPA firm must be concerned when it also provides consulting services for 
an audit client. While the performance of consulting services does not, in and of itself, impair 
independence, the audit team must remain objective when evaluating client activities that 
were developed by its firm’s consultants. For companies currently subject to the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act, the auditor is not permitted to provide certain types of consulting services for audit 
clients. See Chapter 19 for a list of these services.
Establish an Understanding with the Entity
The auditor should establish an understanding with the entity about the terms of the engage­
ment. This understanding reduces the risk that either party may misinterpret what is expected 
or required of the other party. The terms of the engagement, which are documented in the 
engagement letter, should include the objectives of the engagement, management’s responsi­
bilities, the auditor’s responsibilities, and the limitations of the engagement. In establishing 
an understanding with the client, three topics should be discussed: (1) the engagement letter, 
(2) using the work of the internal auditors, and (3) the role of the audit committee.
The Engagement Letter  Auditing standards state that the auditor should document the 
understanding through a written communication with the entity. An engagement letter is used 
to formalize the arrangements reached between the auditor and the entity. This letter serves 
as a contract, outlining the responsibilities of both parties and preventing misunderstandings 
between the two parties. Exhibit 3–1 shows a sample engagement letter for EarthWear.

Dear Mr. Simon:
The purpose of this letter is to confirm our understanding of the terms of our engagement as independent accountants of EarthWear 
Clothiers (the “Company”).
Integrated Audit of the Financial Statements and Internal Control Over 
Financial Reporting—Services and Related Report
We will perform an integrated audit of the consolidated financial statements of the Company at December 31, 2015, and for the year then 
ending and of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. Upon completion of 
our audits, we will provide you with our audit report on the audit work referred to above. If for any reason we are unable to complete our 
integrated audit or are unable to form or have not formed an opinion, we may decline to express an opinion or decline to issue a report as 
a result of this engagement.
In conjunction with the financial statement audit, we will perform reviews of the Company’s unaudited consolidated quarterly financial 
statements for each of the first three quarters in the year ending December 31, 2015, before the Form 10-Q is filed. These reviews will be 
conducted in accordance with standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and are substantially 
less in scope than an audit. Accordingly, a review may not reveal material modifications necessary to make the quarterly financial informa­
tion conform with generally accepted accounting principles. We will communicate to the audit committee and management any matters 
that come to our attention as a result of the review that we believe may require material modifications to the quarterly financial information 
to make it conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. If for any reason relating to the affairs or manage­
ment of the Company we are unable to complete our review, we will notify the audit committee and management.
Our Responsibilities and Limitations
The objective of a financial statement audit is the expression of an opinion on the financial statements. We will be responsible for perform­
ing the audit in accordance with the standards established by the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud. 
The audit will include examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing 
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presenta­
tion. We will consider the Company’s internal control over financial reporting in determining the nature, timing, and extent of auditing 
procedures necessary for expressing our opinion on the financial statements.
The objective of an audit of internal control over financial reporting is the expression of an opinion on the effectiveness of the Com­
pany’s internal control over financial reporting. We will be responsible for performing the audit in accordance with the standards estab­
lished by the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective 
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. The audit will include obtaining an understanding of 
internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating 
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we consider 
necessary in the circumstances.
Under the standards established by the PCAOB, the existence of one or more material weaknesses will require us to issue an adverse 
opinion regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses relating to internal control over financial reporting identified while performing our 
work will be communicated in writing to management and the audit committee. All deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting 
(i.e., those deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that are of a lesser magnitude than significant deficiencies) identified while 
performing our work will be communicated in writing to management of the Company, and the Audit Committee will be informed when such 
a communication has been made. We will communicate in writing to the Board of Directors of the Company if we conclude that the oversight 
of the Company’s external financial reporting and internal control over financial reporting by the Company’s audit committee is ineffective.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projec­
tions of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting from December 31, 2015, the date of our audit of the

Company’s internal control over financial reporting, to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because 
of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
We will design our audit to obtain reasonable, but not absolute, assurance of detecting errors or fraud that would have a material effect 
on the financial statements as well as other illegal acts having a direct and material effect on financial statement amounts, and of identify­
ing material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Absolute assurance is not attainable due to the nature of audit evi­
dence and the characteristics of fraud. Also, an audit is not designed to detect errors or fraud that are immaterial to the financial statements 
or other illegal acts having an indirect or immaterial financial statement impact or deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting 
that, individually or in combination, are less severe than a material weakness. It is important to recognize that there are inherent limitations 
in the auditing process. An audit is based on the concept of selective testing of the data underlying the financial statements, which involves 
judgment regarding the areas to be tested and the nature, timing, extent and results of the tests to be performed. Accordingly, there is 
some risk that a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting would 
remain undetected. Because of the characteristics of fraud, an audit designed and executed in accordance with the standards established 
by the PCAOB may not detect a material misstatement due to fraud. Characteristics of fraud include (i) concealment through collusion 
among management, employees, or third parties; (ii) withheld, misrepresented, or falsified documentation; and (iii) the ability of manage­
ment to override or instruct others to override what otherwise appears to be effective controls. Further, while effective internal control over 
financial reporting reduces the likelihood that errors, fraud, or other illegal acts will occur and remain undetected, it does not eliminate that 
possibility. For these reasons we cannot ensure that errors, fraud, or other illegal acts, if present, will be detected. However, we will com­
municate to the audit committee and management of the Company, as appropriate, any such matters identified during our audit.
We also are responsible for determining that the audit committee is informed about certain other matters related to the conduct of 
our audit, including (i) any disagreements with management about matters that could be significant to the Company’s financial statements 
or our report thereon; (ii) any serious difficulties encountered in performing the audit; (iii) information relating to our independence with 
respect to the Company; and (iv) other matters related to the Company’s financial statements including its significant accounting policies 
and practices, including critical accounting policies and alternative treatments within accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States. Lastly, we are responsible for ensuring that the audit committee receives copies of certain written communications between 
us and management, including management representation letters and written communications on accounting, auditing, internal control, 
or operational matters.
The financial statement audit and the audit of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting will not be planned or conducted 
in contemplation of reliance by any specific third party or with respect to any specific transaction. Therefore, items of possible interest to a 
third party will not be specifically addressed and matters may exist that would be assessed differently by a third party, possibly in connec­
tion with a specific transaction.
Management’s Responsibilities
The Company’s management is responsible for the financial statements, including disclosures, and information referred to above and for 
establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting. In this regard, management is responsible for establish­
ing policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of accounting records, the authorization of receipts and disbursements, the 
safeguarding of assets, the proper recording of transactions in the accounting records, and for reporting financial information in conformity 
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Management also is responsible for the design and implementation of 
programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud, and for informing us (i) about all known or suspected fraud affecting the entity involv­
ing (a) management, (b) employees who have significant roles in internal control over financial reporting, and (c) others where the fraud 
could have a material effect on the financial statements; and (ii) of its knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting 
the entity received in communications from employees, former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others. Management is 
responsible for (i) adjusting the financial statements to correct material misstatements relating to accounts or disclosures and for affirming 
to us in the representation letter that the effects of any uncorrected misstatements aggregated by us are immaterial, both individually and 
in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole; and (ii) notifying us of all deficiencies in the design or operation of internal 
control over financial reporting identified as part of management’s assessment, including separately disclosing to us all such deficien­
cies that it believes to be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Management also is 
responsible for identifying and ensuring that the Company complies with the laws and regulations applicable to its activities. Furthermore, 
management of the Company is responsible for:
	 •	 Establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting;
	 •	 Evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting using suitable control criteria;
	 •	 Supporting its evaluation with sufficient evidential matter, including documentation; and
	 •	 Presenting a written assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the 
Company’s most recent fiscal year.
As part of management’s responsibility for the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, 
management is responsible for making available to us, on a timely basis, all of the Company’s financial records and relevant information

and company personnel to whom we may direct inquiries. Management is responsible for maintaining evidential matter, including docu­
mentation of the design of controls to provide reasonable support for management’s assessment of the operating effectiveness of internal 
control over financial reporting.
As required by the standards of the PCAOB, we will make specific inquiries of management and others about the representations 
embodied in the financial statements and the internal control over financial reporting. Standards of the PCAOB also require that at the 
conclusion of the engagement we obtain a letter from management that confirms certain representations made during the audit of the 
financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The results of our tests, the responses to our inquiries and the written 
representations comprise the evidential matter we intend to rely upon in forming our opinion on the financial statements and the effective­
ness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Similarly, the results of our analytical procedures, the responses to our 
inquiries, and the written representations obtained comprise the basis for our review on the unaudited quarterly financial information.
Document Retention
The Company agrees to maintain documentation sufficient to support its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2015, for a period of seven years from the date of our audit report.
Other Documents
Standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) require that we read any annual report that con­
tains our audit report. The purpose of this procedure is to consider whether other information in the annual report, including the manner 
of its presentation, is materially inconsistent with information appearing in the financial statements. We assume no obligation to perform 
procedures to corroborate such other information as part of our audit.
With regard to electronic filings, such as in connection with the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) 
system, you agree that, before filing any document in electronic format with the SEC with which we are associated, you will advise us of the 
proposed filing on a timely basis. We will provide you with a signed copy of our report(s) and consent(s). These manually signed documents 
will serve to authorize the use of our name prior to any electronic transmission by you. For our files, you will provide us with a complete 
copy of the document as accepted by EDGAR.
The Company may wish to include our report on these financial statements in a registration statement to be filed under the Securi­
ties Act of 1933 or in some other securities offering. You agree that the aforementioned audit report, or reference to our Firm, will not be 
included in any such offering without our prior permission or consent. Any agreement to perform work in connection with an offering, 
including an agreement to provide permission or consent, will be a separate engagement.
Timing and Fees
Completion of our work is subject to, among other things, (1) appropriate cooperation from the Company’s personnel, including timely 
preparation of necessary schedules; (2) timely responses to our inquiries; and (3) timely communication of all significant accounting and 
financial reporting matters. When and if for any reason the Company is unable to provide such schedules, information, and assistance, 
­Willis & Adams and the Company will mutually revise the fee to reflect additional services, if any, required of us to complete the audit.
Our fee estimates are based on the time required by the individuals assigned to the engagement. Individual hourly rates vary according 
to the degree of responsibility involved and experience and skill required. We estimate our fees for this integrated audit of internal control 
and financial statements will be $2,250,000, exclusive of out-of-pocket expenses. This estimate takes into account the agreed-upon level 
of preparation and assistance from company personnel; we will advise management should this not be provided or should any other cir­
cumstances arise which may cause actual time to exceed that estimate. Invoices rendered are due and payable upon receipt.
This engagement letter reflects the entire agreement between us relating to the services covered by this letter. It replaces and super­
sedes any previous proposals, correspondence, and understandings, whether written or oral. The agreements of the Company and Willis & 
Adams contained in this engagement letter shall survive the completion or termination of this engagement.
If you have any questions, please contact us. If the services outlined herein are in accordance with your requirements and if the above 
terms are acceptable to you, please have one copy of this letter signed in the space provided below and return it to us.
Very truly yours,
Willis & Adams

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
In addition to the items mentioned in the sample engagement letter in Exhibit 3–1, the 
engagement letter may include:
	
∙	 Arrangements involving the use of specialists or internal auditors.
	
∙	 Any limitation of the liability of the auditor or client, such as indemnification 
to the auditor for liability arising from knowing misrepresentations to the 
auditor by management or alternative dispute resolution procedures. (Note that 
regulatory bodies, such as the SEC, may restrict or prohibit such liability-limiting 
arrangements.)
	
∙	 Additional services to be provided relating to regulatory requirements.
	
∙	 Arrangements regarding other services (e.g., assurance, tax, or consulting services).
Using the Work of the Internal Audit Function  When the entity has an internal audit 
function (IAF), the auditor may use the work of the IAF as evidence and request the IAF 
provide direct assistance in conducting the audit. The auditor first needs to obtain an under­
standing of the IAF, including information about the activities that it performs. The auditor 
next must determine whether any of these activities are relevant to the audit of the financial 
statements. If the auditor determines that the work of the IAF can be used for purposes of the 
audit, the auditor must evaluate:
	
∙	 The extent to which the IAF’s organizational status and relevant policies and 
procedures support the objectivity of the internal auditors;
	
∙	 The level of competence of the IAF; and
	
∙	 The application by the IAF of a systematic and disciplined approach, including 
quality control.
Table 3–2 presents factors that the auditor should consider when assessing the IAF. In 
Chapter 7, we discuss the effect the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has had on the use and assessment of 
the IAF for the audit of internal control over financial reporting.
The IAF’s work may affect the nature, timing, and extent of the audit procedures per­
formed by the auditor. For example, as part of their regular work, the IAF may review, assess, 
and monitor the entity’s controls that are included in the accounting system. Similarly, part 
of the IAF work may include confirming accounts receivables or observing certain physi­
cal inventories. If the IAF is reliable, the auditor may use the IAF’s work in these areas to 
reduce the scope of audit work. The materiality of the account balance and its related audit 
risk may also determine how much the auditor can rely on the IAF’s work. When internal 
auditors work directly for the auditor, the auditor should supervise, review, evaluate, and test 
their work.
The Role of the Audit Committee  An audit committee is a subcommittee of the board 
of directors that is responsible for the financial reporting and disclosure process.1 For public 
LO 3-5
LO 3-6
1Some privately held companies may not have an audit committee. In those circumstances the auditor should com­
municate with those charged with governance. Those charged with governance are persons with the responsibility for 
overseeing the strategic direction of the entity and obligations related to the accountability of the entity.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The Securities and Exchange Commission has a long-standing view on matters of auditor indem­
nification: when an accountant and an entity enter into an agreement of indemnity which seeks to 
provide the accountant immunity from liability for his or her own negligent acts, whether of omis­
sion or commission, the accountant is not independent. Furthermore, inclusion of such a clause in 
an engagement letter that a registrant would release, indemnify, or hold harmless from any liability 
and costs resulting from knowing misrepresentations by management would also impair the firm’s 
independence (SEC, Financial Reporting Polices, Section 600-602.02.f.i. Indemnification by Client).

	
Chapter 3    Audit Planning, Types of Audit Tests, and Materiality

companies, the auditor is required to establish an understanding of the terms of the audit 
engagement with the audit committee and to record that understanding in an engagement 
letter (AS16). Under Section 301 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the audit committee of a public 
company has the following requirements:
	
∙	 Each member of the audit committee must be a member of the board of directors and 
shall be independent.
	
∙	 The audit committee is directly responsible for the appointment, compensation, and 
oversight of the work of any registered public accounting firm employed by the 
company.
	
∙	 The audit committee must preapprove all audit and nonaudit services provided by its 
auditor.
	
∙	 The audit committee must establish procedures for the receipt, retention, and 
treatment of complaints received by the company regarding accounting, internal 
control, and auditing.
	
∙	 Each audit committee member must have the authority to engage independent counsel 
or other advisors, as it determines necessary to carry out its duties.
The audit committee should meet with the external auditor before the engagement starts to 
discuss the auditor’s responsibilities and significant accounting policies. It may also provide 
limited input into the scope of the auditor’s work, such as requesting that the external auditor 
visit certain locations. The audit committee may also engage the external or internal audi­
tors to conduct special investigations. The external auditor is required to make a number of 
important communications to the audit committee during or at the end of the engagement. 
Chapter 17 covers them in detail.
The audit committee should also interact with the internal audit function. An ideal 
arrangement for establishing the independence of the internal audit function is for the head 
of internal auditing (chief audit executive) to report functionally to the audit committee and 
administratively to senior management (i.e., CEO and CFO).
Factors for Evaluating the Reliability of the Internal Audit Function
Objectivity
 • Whether the organizational status of the IAF, including the function’s authority and accountability, supports the ability of the function to be free from 
bias, conflict of interest, or undue influence of others to override professional judgments (e.g., the IAF reports to audit committee or an officer with 
appropriate authority, or if the function reports to management, whether it has direct access to audit committee).
 • Whether the IAF is free of any conflicting responsibilities (e.g., having managerial or operational duties or responsibilities that are outside of the IAF).
 • Whether audit committee oversees employment decisions related to the IAF.
 • Whether any constraints or restrictions placed on the IAF by management or audit committee exist (e.g., in communicating the IAF’s findings to the 
external auditor).
 • Whether the internal auditors are members of relevant professional bodies and their memberships obligate their compliance with relevant professional 
standards relating to objectivity or whether their internal policies achieve the same objectives.
Competence
 • Whether the IAF is adequately and appropriately resourced relative to the size of the entity and the nature of its operations.
 • Whether established policies for hiring, training, and assigning internal auditors to internal audit engagements exist.
 • Whether the internal auditors have adequate technical training and proficiency in auditing (e.g., the internal auditors’ possession of a relevant profes­
sional designation and experience).
 • Whether the internal auditors possess the required knowledge relating to the entity’s financial reporting and the applicable financial reporting frame­
work and whether the IAF possesses the necessary skills to perform work related to the entity’s financial statements.
 • Whether the internal auditors are members of relevant professional bodies that oblige them to comply with the relevant professional standards, includ­
ing continuing professional development requirements.
Systematic and Disciplined Approach
 • The existence, adequacy, and use of documented internal audit procedures or guidance covering such areas as risk assessments, work programs, 
documentation, and reporting, the nature and extent of which is commensurate with the size and circumstances of an entity.
 • Whether the IAF has appropriate quality control policies and procedures or quality control requirements in standards set by relevant professional bodies 
for internal auditors. Such bodies may also establish other appropriate requirements such as conducting periodic external quality assessments.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Audit Strategy and Plan
Engagement planning involves all the issues the auditor should consider in developing an 
overall audit strategy for conducting the audit. In establishing the audit strategy, the auditor 
should determine the scope of the engagement, ascertain the reporting objectives to plan the 
timing of the audit, and consider the factors that will determine the focus of the audit team’s 
efforts. Developing the audit strategy helps the auditor determine what resources are needed 
to perform the engagement.
Once the overall audit strategy has been established, the auditor develops an audit plan. 
The audit plan is more detailed than the audit strategy. In the audit plan, the auditor docu­
ments a description of the nature, timing, and extent of the planned audit procedures to be 
used in order to comply with auditing standards. Basically, the audit plan should consider how 
to conduct the audit in an effective and efficient manner.
The nature and extent of planning activities that are necessary depend on the size and 
complexity of the entity and the auditor’s previous experience with the entity. The auditor 
should be guided by the results of the entity acceptance/continuance process, procedures per­
formed to gain the understanding of the entity, and preliminary engagement activities. The 
auditor should modify the overall audit strategy and the audit plan as necessary if circum­
stances change significantly during the course of the audit. Additional steps that should be 
performed include:
	
∙	 Assess business risks.
	
∙	 Establish materiality.
	
∙	 Consider multilocations.
	
∙	 Assess the need for specialists.
	
∙	 Consider violations of laws and regulations.
	
∙	 Identify related parties.
	
∙	 Consider additional value-added services.
	
∙	 Document the overall audit strategy, audit plan, and prepare audit programs.
Assess Business Risks
In Chapter 1, audit risk was defined as the risk that the auditor expresses an inappropriate 
audit report when the financial statements are materially misstated. One way that the auditor 
reduces audit risk to an acceptably low level is by obtaining an understanding of the entity 
and its environment. Based on this understanding, the auditor identifies those business risks 
that may result in material misstatements. The auditor then evaluates how the entity responds 
to those business risks and ensures that those responses have been adequately implemented. 
Based on this information, the auditor assesses the level of risk of material misstatement in 
the financial statement accounts. The risk of material misstatement is used to plan the audit­
ing procedures to be performed. Chapter 4 provides a detailed discussion of the auditor’s risk 
assessment process.
Establish Materiality
As discussed in Chapter 1, it is too costly for auditors to audit all transactions that occur 
within the entity. Thus, auditors consider materiality from a reasonable user perspec­
tive and communicate to users that “the financial statements present fairly in all mate­
rial respects.” The consideration of materiality is a matter of professional judgment and 
will vary across entities. During the planning of the audit, the auditor establishes a level 
of overall materiality for evaluating the financial statements as a whole. The auditor also 
LO 3-7
Planning the Audit

	
Chapter 3    Audit Planning, Types of Audit Tests, and Materiality	
79
establishes tolerable misstatement—the amount of overall materiality used to plan and per­
form audit procedures at the account or disclosure level.2 The last section in this chapter 
provides a comprehensive discussion of the process followed by the auditor in establishing 
materiality for the overall financial statements and tolerable misstatement for significant 
accounts or disclosures.
Consider Multilocations or Business Units
Many entities have operations in multiple locations or operate many business units. As part 
of the planning process, the auditor determines which locations or business units are to be 
audited and the extent of audit procedures to be performed at the selected locations or busi­
ness units. The auditor then assesses the risks of material misstatement to the consolidated 
financial statements associated with the location or business unit and correlates the amount of 
audit attention devoted to the location or business unit with the level of risk present. In audit­
ing a company with operations in multiple locations or business units, the auditor needs to 
determine the extent to which audit procedures should be performed at selected locations or 
business units. See AS9 and AU-C 600 for more guidance on auditing an entity with multilo­
cations and business units.
Assess the Need for Specialists
A major consideration in planning the audit is the need for specialists. Auditing standards 
define an auditor’s specialist as an individual or organization possessing expertise in a field 
other than accounting or auditing, whose work in that field is used by the auditor to assist 
the auditor in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence. Examples include specialists 
in finance, tax, valuation, pension, and information technology (IT). Such specialists may 
assist the auditor with valuing financial instruments, determining physical quantities, valuing 
environmental liabilities, or interpreting regulations or contracts. The use of an IT specialist 
is a significant aspect of most audit engagements. In deciding whether an IT specialist is to be 
used, a primary concern is the extent to which IT is used in processing accounting informa­
tion. The presence of complex information technology may require the use of an IT specialist. 
Chapter 6 covers these IT issues in more detail.
The auditor is still ultimately responsible for work performed by the specialist. In relying 
on the specialist, the auditor should evaluate the competence and objectivity of the specialist, 
audit the inputs used by the specialist (e.g., census data for actuaries) and reconcile the output 
(e.g., an estimate should be found in the financial statements or disclosures), and review the 
specialist’s work for reasonableness, including the reasonableness of assumptions.
Consider Violations of Laws and Regulations
Violations of laws or regulations are referred to as illegal acts. The effect on the financial 
statements of laws and regulations varies considerably. In some instances, fraud may also 
consist of illegal acts (see Chapter 4). Auditing standards distinguish between illegal acts 
that have direct and material effects on the financial statements and those that have mate­
rial but indirect effects. The auditor should consider laws and regulations that are generally 
recognized as having a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement 
amounts. For example, tax laws and laws and regulations that may affect the amount of rev­
enue recognized under a government contract fall into this category. Auditing standards state 
that the auditor’s responsibility for detecting illegal acts having a direct and material effect on 
the financial statements is the same as that for errors or fraud.
Other illegal acts, such as violations of the securities acts, environmental protection, 
equal employment regulations, and price-fixing or other antitrust violations, may materially 
2Overall materiality is also referred to as planning materiality. The ASB’s standards refer to tolerable misstatement 
as performance materiality.

80	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
but indirectly affect the financial statements. The auditor should be aware that such illegal 
acts may have occurred. If specific information comes to the auditor’s attention that pro­
vides evidence concerning the existence of such material but indirect illegal acts, the auditor 
should apply audit procedures specifically directed at determining whether illegal acts have 
occurred. However, an audit conducted in accordance with auditing standards provides no 
assurance that illegal acts will be detected or that any contingent liability that may result will 
be disclosed.
Stop and Think: Suppose your client was involved in mining coal. What laws or regu­
lations might be applicable?
When an entity’s business has direct impacts on the environment (e.g., mining, forestry, 
nuclear power) certainly the auditor would want to understand the potential implication on the 
audit of state and federal environmental regulations.
Table 3–3 presents some examples of specific information or circumstances that indi­
cate the possibility of an illegal act. For example, the business world has seen a number of 
instances where payments of sales commissions or agent’s fees were really bribes to secure 
contracts. When the auditor becomes aware of such a possible illegal act, he or she should 
obtain an understanding of the nature of the act, the circumstances in which it occurred, and 
sufficient other information to evaluate its effects on the financial statements. The auditor 
should then discuss the matter with the appropriate level of management. If management does 
not provide satisfactory information, the auditor should consult with the entity’s legal counsel 
and apply additional audit procedures, if necessary.
If an illegal act has occurred or is likely to have occurred, the auditor should consider its 
implications for other aspects of the audit, particularly the reliability of management represen­
tations. The auditor should ensure that the audit committee or those charged with governance 
are adequately informed about significant illegal acts. The auditor should also recognize that, 
under the circumstances noted previously, he or she may have a duty to notify parties outside 
the entity.
Identify Related Parties3
It is important for the auditor to evaluate the entity’s identification of, accounting for, and 
disclosure of transactions with related parties.4 Auditors should attempt to identify all related 
parties during the planning phase of the audit. It is important to identify related party trans­
actions because the transaction may not be “at arm’s length.” For example, the entity may 
3See E. A. Gordon, E. Henry, T. J. Louwers, and B. J. Reed, “Auditing Related Party Transactions: A Literature 
Overview and Research Synthesis,” Accounting Horizons (March 2007), pp. 81–102 for a review of research on 
related parties.
4See FASB ASC Topic 850, “Related Party Disclosures,” for a detailed definition of related parties.
Information or Circumstances That May Indicate an Illegal Act
Unauthorized transactions, improperly recorded transactions, or transactions not recorded in a complete or timely 
manner.
An investigation by a government agency, an enforcement proceeding, or payment of unusual fines or penalties.
Violations of laws or regulations cited in reports of examinations by regulatory agencies.
Large payments for unspecified services to consultants, affiliates, or employees.
Sales commissions or agents’ fees that appear excessive.
Large payments in cash or bank cashiers’ checks.
Unexplained payments to government officials.
Failure to file tax returns or pay government duties.
T A B L E  3 – 3

	
Chapter 3    Audit Planning, Types of Audit Tests, and Materiality	
81
buy or sell goods or services at prices that differ significantly from prevailing market prices. 
The auditor should understand the entity’s controls for identifying related parties, authoriz­
ing and approving related party transactions, and accounting for and disclosing related party 
transactions. The auditor also needs to inquire of management about the names of related 
parties, the nature of the relationships, the types of transactions, and the reasons for entering 
into the transactions with the related parties. Some other sources of information on related 
parties include
	
∙	 Minutes of the board of directors meetings.
	
∙	 Conflict-of-interest statements from management and others.
	
∙	 Financial and reporting information provided to creditors, investors, and regulators.
	
∙	 Contracts or other agreements (including side agreements that may not be formally 
documented between customers and vendors, and management).
	
∙	 Contracts and other agreements representing significant unusual transactions.
Once related parties have been identified, audit personnel should be provided with their names 
so that transactions with such parties are identified and investigated.
Stop and Think: What are examples of additional related parties and how might the 
auditor identify them?
An example might be a partnership composed of management who own a building leased by 
the entity. The auditor might detect such a related party transaction by examining the lease 
agreement.
Consider Additional Value-Added Services
As part of the planning process, the auditor should look for opportunities to recommend 
additional value-added services. Traditionally, value-added services have included tax 
planning, system design and integration, and internal reporting processes. With auditors 
taking a more global view of the entity and its environment, there are opportunities to 
provide valuable services for the entity. For example, the assurance services (introduced 
in Chapter 2 and discussed in more detail in Chapter 21) include risk assessment, busi­
ness performance measurement (benchmarking), and electronic commerce. The auditor 
also can provide recommendations based on the assessment of the entity’s business risks. 
With the knowledge gathered through assessing business risks, the auditor can provide 
important feedback to management and the board of directors on the strengths and weak­
nesses of business processes, strategic planning, and emerging trends. Proper consideration 
of value-added services during the planning process should alert the audit team to proac­
tively identify opportunities to improve client service. Of course, auditors who audit public 
companies are limited in the types of consulting services they can offer their audit clients 
(see Chapter 19).
Document the Overall Audit Strategy, Audit Plan, 
and Prepare Audit Programs
The auditor should document the audit strategy and audit plan. This involves documenting the 
decisions about the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests. At this stage, the auditor compiles 
his or her knowledge about the entity’s business objectives, strategies, and related business 
and audit risks. The auditor records how the entity is managing its risks (i.e., through internal 
control processes) and then documents the effect of the risks and controls on the planned audit 
procedures. Auditors ensure they have addressed the risks they identified in their understand­
ing of the risk assessment process by documenting the linkage from the entity’s business

Chapter 3    Audit Planning, Types of Audit Tests, and Materiality	
83
There are three general types of audit tests:
	
∙	 Risk assessment procedures.
	
∙	 Tests of controls.
	
∙	 Substantive procedures.
Risk Assessment Procedures
Auditor risk assessment procedures are used to obtain an understanding of the entity and its 
environment, including its internal control. Risk assessment procedures include inquiries of 
management and others, preliminary analytical procedures, and observation and inspection. 
Such procedures are used to assess the risks of material misstatement at the financial state­
ment and assertion levels. Risk assessment procedures are covered in depth in Chapter 4.
Tests of Controls
Tests of controls are audit procedures performed to test the operating effectiveness of controls 
in preventing, or detecting and correcting, material misstatements at the relevant assertion 
level. The following audit procedures are examples of tests of controls:
	
∙	 Inquiries of appropriate management, supervisory, and staff personnel.
	
∙	 Inspection of documents, reports, and electronic files.
	
∙	 Observation of the application of specific controls.
	
∙	 Walkthroughs, which involve tracing a transaction from its origination to its inclusion 
in the financial statements through a combination of audit procedures, including 
inquiry, observation, and inspection.
	
∙	 Reperformance of the application of the control by the auditor.
LO 3-9
Supervision of the Audit
An important part of the planning and conduct of the audit is appropriate supervision of audit 
personnel. The engagement partner has the overall responsibility for the engagement and its 
performance and should supervise the audit engagement team so that the work is performed 
as directed and supports the conclusions reached. The engagement partner and other engage­
ment team members performing supervisory activities should
	
∙	 Inform engagement team members of their responsibilities, including
	
∙	 the objectives of the procedures that they are to perform;
	
∙	 the nature, timing, and extent of procedures they are to perform; and
	
∙	 matters that could affect the procedures to be performed or the evaluation of the 
results of those procedures.
	
∙	 Direct engagement team members to bring any significant accounting and auditing 
issues they identify to the attention of the engagement partner or other engagement 
team members performing supervisory activities so they can evaluate those issues and 
determine appropriate actions.
	
∙	 Review the work of engagement team members to evaluate whether
	
∙	 the work was performed and documented;
	
∙	 the objectives of the procedures were achieved; and
	
∙	 the results of the work support the conclusions reached.
Proper supervision should help ensure that the audit is conducted in accordance with audit­
ing standards.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
For example, in evaluating the design of an IT application control and determining 
whether it has been implemented, the auditor may make inquiries of entity personnel and 
inspect relevant systems documentation, reports, or other documents. Table 3–4 provides 
examples of controls that are normally present in the processing of revenue transactions and 
tests of controls that the auditor might use to test the operating effectiveness of the controls. 
Tests of controls are covered in more depth in Chapter 6.
Substantive Procedures
Substantive procedures are designed to detect material misstatements (that is, monetary 
errors) in a class of transactions, account balance, and disclosure component of the finan­
cial statements. There are two categories of substantive procedures: (1) tests of details and 
(2) substantive analytical procedures.
Tests of Details  Tests of details are usually categorized into two types: (1) substantive 
tests of transactions and (2) tests of details of account balances and disclosures. Substantive 
tests of transactions test for errors or fraud in individual transactions. For example, an auditor 
may examine a large purchase of inventory by testing that the cost of the goods included on 
the vendor’s invoice for that purchase is properly recorded in the inventory and accounts pay­
able accounts. Tests of details of account balances and disclosures focus on the items that are 
contained in the ending financial statement account balances and disclosures. For example, 
the auditor may want to test accounts receivable. To test the details of the balance of accounts 
receivable, the auditor will likely send confirmations to a sample of customers.
Substantive Analytical Procedures  The term analytical procedures means evalua­
tions of financial information through analysis of plausible relationships (e.g., examination 
of trends and ratios) among both financial and nonfinancial data. Analytical procedures also 
encompass the investigation, if necessary, of identified fluctuations or relationships that are 
inconsistent with other relevant information or that differ from expected values by a signifi­
cant amount. Substantive analytical procedures are discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Dual-Purpose Tests
Tests of controls check the operating effectiveness of controls, while substantive tests of 
transactions are concerned with monetary misstatements. However, it often makes sense to 
design audit procedures to conduct both a test of controls and a substantive test of transactions 
simultaneously on the same document. For example, in Table 3–4, the last control procedure 
shown is agreement of sales invoices to shipping documents and customer orders for product 
type, price, and quantity. The test of controls shown is to recompute the information on a sam­
ple of sales invoices. While this test primarily checks the effectiveness of the control, it also 
provides evidence on whether the sales invoice contains the wrong quantity, product type, or 
price. Dual-purpose tests can also improve the efficiency of the audit.
Examples of Internal Controls and Tests of Controls

This text discusses tests of controls within each business process. We discuss substantive 
tests of transactions along with other substantive tests pertaining to each business process. 
You should remember, however, that in most audit situations substantive tests of transactions 
are conducted at the same time as tests of controls.

ity: Two Decades Later,” Auditing: A Journal of Theory & Practice (November 2005), pp. 153–87, for a discussion 
of materiality research.
Materiality5
An important part of audit planning is to determine overall materiality for the financial state­
ments (also referred to as planning materiality) and to decide on tolerable misstatement (also 
referred to as performance materiality) for significant accounts or disclosures. These deter­
minations are an important aspect of developing an overall audit strategy and a detailed audit 
plan. As mentioned in Chapter 1, it is not cost-efficient to perform an audit that catches every 
misstatement no matter how small. Thus, the auditor designs the audit to provide reasonable 
assurance of detecting misstatements that are of sufficient magnitude to affect the judgment 
of reasonable financial statement users.
The auditor’s consideration of materiality on an audit is a matter of professional judgment. 
Materiality is assessed in terms of the potential effect of a misstatement on decisions made by 
a reasonable user of the financial statements. Both the PCAOB and ASB follow a user per­
spective in considering what is material. The PCAOB focuses mainly on protecting investors 
and uses the Supreme Court of the United States interpretation of the federal securities laws, 
which state that a fact is material if there is “a substantial likelihood that the . . . fact would 
have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the ‘total mix’ of 
information made available.” The PCAOB further notes that the Supreme Court has stated that 
the determination of materiality requires “delicate assessments of the inferences a ‘reasonable 
shareholder’ would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to 
him . . .” (AS11 ¶ 2).”6 Both the PCAOB and ASB perspectives require that the auditor assess 
the amount of misstatement that could affect a reasonable user’s decisions. The ASB auditing 
standard on materiality (AU-C 320.04) provides further guidance to auditors in assessing the 
effects of a misstatement on the economic decisions of users. Users are assumed to
	
∙	 Have a reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and accounting and 
a willingness to study the information in the financial statements with a reasonable 
diligence.
	
∙	 Understand that financial statements are prepared and audited to levels of materiality.
	
∙	 Recognize the uncertainties inherent in the measurement of amounts based on the use 
of estimates, judgment, and the consideration of future events.
	
∙	 Make appropriate economic decisions on the basis of the information in the financial 
statements.
The determination of materiality, therefore, takes into account how users with such charac­
teristics could reasonably be expected to be influenced in making economic decisions. It is 
important to note that the opinion paragraph of the auditor’s report states that the financial 
statements present fairly, “in all material respects.” This phrase communicates to third parties 
that the audit report is limited to material information.
The following sections present an approach to assessing materiality that is based on 
auditing standards and current audit practice.7 The approach provides the reader with a basic 
framework for understanding the consideration of materiality in an audit.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Steps in Applying Materiality
Figure 3–2 presents the three major steps in the application of materiality to an audit. Steps 1 
and 2 are normally performed early in the engagement as part of planning the audit (see 
­Figure 1–4 in Chapter 1). Step 3 is performed usually just prior to, or when the auditor evalu­
ates the evidence at the completion of the audit to determine if it supports the fair presentation 
of the financial statements (again, refer to Figure 1–4).
Step 1: Determine Overall Materiality  Auditing standards require the auditor to estab­
lish a materiality amount for the financial statements as a whole, but they do not provide spe­
cific guidance on how to determine overall materiality. The PCAOB’s guidance states that the 
auditor should consider “the company’s earnings and other relevant factors,” while the ASB 
provides additional benchmarks. Overall materiality is the maximum amount by which the 
auditor believes the financial statements could be misstated and still not affect the decisions of 
users. Materiality, however, is a relative, not an absolute, concept. For example, $5,000 might 
be considered highly material for a small sole proprietorship, but this amount would clearly be 
immaterial for a large multinational corporation. Thus, the relative size of the company being 
audited affects overall materiality.
Table 3–5 provides examples of benchmarks and relevant percentages to apply to those 
benchmarks based on current practice.
For public companies, firms typically use 2–5 percent of income before taxes. For non-
public companies, income before taxes is also used for profit-oriented entities with stable

earnings, but other benchmarks might be appropriate. A common rule of thumb in practice is 
to use 5 percent of income before taxes. However, if current year pretax income is not stable, 
auditors might use “normalized earnings”—an average of the previous three years’ pretax 
income, or another benchmark (e.g., total assets or total revenues). Difficulties also arise in 
using income as a benchmark when the entity is close to breaking even or experiencing a loss. 
For example, suppose that an entity has income before taxes of $3,000,000 one year and the 
auditor decides that 5 percent of that amount, $150,000, would be material. The scope of the 
audit in that year would be based on a overall materiality of $150,000. Suppose, in the follow­
ing year, the entity’s income before taxes falls to $250,000 due to a temporary decrease in sales 
prices for its products. If the auditor uses the 5 percent factor, the overall materiality would be 
$12,500 ($250,000 × .05), and a much more extensive audit would be required. Thus, with 
fluctuating net income, using an average of the prior three years’ income or another base such 
as total assets or total revenues may provide a more stable benchmark from year to year.
For not-for-profit entities, total revenues or total assets might be more appropriate bench­
marks. Last, for asset-based entities (e.g., investment funds), the auditor might use net assets 
as a benchmark.
In deciding the appropriate percentage to apply to a selected benchmark, the auditor 
would chose a lower percentage within the range for qualitative factors such as:
	
∙	 Material misstatements in prior years;
	
∙	 High risk of fraud;
	
∙	 The entity is close to violating a covenant in a loan agreement;
	
∙	 Small amounts may cause the entity to miss forecasted revenues or earnings, or affect 
the trend in earnings;
	
∙	 The entity operates in a volatile business environment, has complex operations 
(multilocations), or operates in a highly regulated industry.
Step 2: Determine Tolerable Misstatement  The auditor should determine tolerable 
misstatement at an amount or amounts that reduce to an appropriately low level the prob­
ability that the total of uncorrected and undetected misstatements would result in material 
misstatement of the financial statements. The purpose of setting tolerable misstatement is to 
establish a scope for the audit procedures for the individual account balance or disclosures. 
Because of the many factors involved, there is no required or optimal method for establishing 
materiality for an account balance or class of transactions.
In practice, auditors commonly set tolerable misstatement for each account at between 50 
and 75 percent of overall materiality. The firms also provide guidance to assist their auditors in 
determining the appropriate percentage to use within the range. In addition to the factors men­
tioned above for setting the percentage for overall materiality, firm guidance includes the fol­
lowing factors that would cause the auditor to use a lower percentage for tolerable misstatement:
	
∙	 High risk of misstatement within the account balance, class of transaction, or disclosure;
	
∙	 Increased number of accounting issues that require significant judgment and/or more 
estimates with high estimation uncertainty;
	
∙	 A history of material weaknesses, significant deficiencies, and/or a high number of 
deficiencies in internal control;
	
∙	 High turnover of senior management or key financial reporting personnel.
Obviously, using 50 to 75 percent of overall materiality results in an amount of total com­
bined tolerable misstatement that is greater than overall materiality. Some firms cap the size of 
combined or aggregated tolerable misstatement to a multiple of overall materiality. For exam­
ple, combined tolerable misstatement can be up to a multiple of four times overall materiality.
There are a number of reasons why an amount of combined tolerable misstatement 
greater than materiality makes sense from an audit planning perspective:
	
∙	 Not all accounts will be misstated by the full amount of their tolerable misstatement 
allocation.

88	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
	
∙	 Audits of the individual accounts are conducted simultaneously (typically by 
different members of the audit team). If accounts were audited sequentially, 
unadjusted misstatements observed during testing would count against materiality 
and theoretically the auditor could carry the unused portion of materiality to the next 
account and so forth.
	
∙	 Materiality as a percentage of large accounts, such as inventory; accounts receivable; 
revenues; or plant, property, and equipment, is often a very small fraction of the 
account (less than 2 percent), and the scope of planned auditor procedures will be 
sufficiently precise to identify significant misstatements.
	
∙	 When errors are identified, the auditors typically perform additional procedures in 
that, and related, accounts.
	
∙	 Overall financial statement materiality serves as a “safety net.” If individual 
unadjusted misstatements are less than tolerable misstatement, but aggregate to 
an amount greater than materiality, then (1) the audit client will need to make 
adjustments to decrease the unadjusted misstatements below materiality; (2) the 
auditor will need to perform more testing; and/or (3) the auditor will issue a qualified 
or adverse opinion.
Taken together, these points suggest that it would be inefficient for the auditor to simply 
subdivide materiality proportionally to each account. This would result in unnecessarily low 
tolerable misstatement levels. The lower the tolerable misstatement is, the more extensive is 
the required audit testing. In the extreme, if tolerable misstatement were very small or zero, 
the auditor would have to test every transaction making up an account. Imagine how a house 
inspector’s investigation and related costs would differ if she or he were asked to identify all 
potential problems greater than $2 versus a “tolerable damage” threshold of $2,000. Similarly, 
auditing standards recognize that an auditor works within economic limits, and for the audit 
opinion to be economically useful it must be completed in a reasonable length of time at rea­
sonable costs.
Step 3: Evaluate Audit Findings  Step 3 is completed near the end of the audit, when the 
auditor evaluates all the evidence that has been gathered. Based on the results of the audit pro­
cedures conducted, the auditor aggregates misstatements from each account or disclosure. If 
the auditor’s judgment about materiality at the planning stage (Step 1) was based on the same 
information available at the evaluation stage (Step 3), materiality for both purposes would be 
the same. However, the auditor may identify factors or items during the course of the audit that 
cause a revision to the overall materiality. Thus, the overall materiality used to plan audit pro­
cedures may differ from the materiality used in evaluating the audit findings. When this occurs, 
the auditor should carefully document the reasons for using a different materiality level.
When the aggregated misstatements are less than the overall materiality, the auditor can 
conclude that the financial statements are fairly presented. Conversely, when the aggregated 
misstatements are greater than overall materiality, the auditor should request that the entity 
adjust the financial statements. If the entity refuses to adjust the financial statements for the 
misstatements, the auditor should issue a qualified or adverse opinion because the financial 
statements do not present fairly in conformity with GAAP.
An Example
In this example, the three steps for applying materiality are discussed using financial informa­
tion for EarthWear Clothiers for the year ended December 31, 2015. This financial information 
is taken from the case illustration included in Chapter 1.
Step 1: Determine the Overall Materiality  EarthWear Clothiers’ income before taxes is 
$36 million (rounded). Assume that the auditors, Willis & Adams, have decided that 5 percent 
of this benchmark is appropriate for overall materiality. Thus, they determine overall materi­
ality to be $1,800,000 ($36,000,000 × .05). To determine the final amount for materiality, the 
LO 3-12

	
Chapter 3    Audit Planning, Types of Audit Tests, and Materiality	
89
auditors should consider whether any qualitative factors (i.e., close to violating a covenant in 
a loan agreement) are relevant for the engagement. In our example, assume that the auditors 
have determined that no qualitative factors are relevant and that the $1,800,000 will be used 
for overall materiality. This is the amount that is used for determining tolerable misstatement 
for specific accounts or disclosures in Step 2.
Step 2: Determine Tolerable Misstatement  We assume that EarthWear’s auditors 
determine tolerable misstatement by using 50 percent of overall materiality. Therefore, toler­
able misstatement is $900,000 ($1,800,000 × .50).
Step 3: Evaluate Audit Findings  Tolerable misstatement can be used for determining the 
fair presentation of the individual accounts after completion of the audit work. Assume that 
during the course of the audit the auditor identified four misstatements. The misstatements are 
compared to the tolerable misstatement allocated to each account. For example, the first mis­
statement indicates a factual misstatement in the accrual of payroll expense and bonuses. The 
total misstatement of accrued payroll is $215,000. The second entry is based on the results 
of a statistical sampling application for inventory. The statistical results indicated there is a 
misstatement of $312,500. In this example, no error is larger than the tolerable misstatement 
amount of $900,000, and the total of the misstatements is also less than overall materiality. 
Before making a final decision, the auditor should consider the possibility of undetected mis­
statements, further possible misstatements that may be due to sampling, and misstatements 
that carry forward from the prior year. The auditor should document his or her conclusion as 
to whether the aggregated misstatements cause the financial statements to be materially mis­
stated (see Exhibit 3–3). If one of the entries were in excess of the tolerable misstatement for 
an account balance, or if the aggregated misstatements were greater than overall materiality, 
the entity would have to adjust the financial statements or the auditor would have to issue a 
qualified or adverse opinion.

hapter 1 discussed three fundamental concepts in conducting a finan­
cial statement audit. Chapter 3 further explored the first important con­
cept: materiality. This chapter goes into more depth with respect to 
the second concept: audit risk. Chapter 5 will cover the third: audit evidence. 
Materiality and audit risk significantly impact the auditor’s evidence decisions. 
The auditor considers both concepts in planning the nature, timing, and extent 
of audit procedures and in evaluating the results of those procedures.
This chapter will help you understand the audit risk model and the audi­
tor’s risk assessment process. The audit risk model serves as a framework for 
assessing audit risk. The auditor follows a risk assessment process to iden­
tify the risk of material misstatement in the financial statement accounts. The 
risk of material misstatement is composed of two components of the audit risk 
model: inherent risk and control risk. The risk of material misstatement is used 
to determine the acceptable level of detection risk and to plan the auditing 
procedures to be performed. The auditor restricts audit risk at the account bal­
ance or assertion level in such a way that, at the end of the engagement, he or 
she can express an opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, at an 
acceptably low level of audit risk.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Audit risk is a fundamental concept that underlies the audit process. Because of the nature of 
audit evidence and the characteristics of management fraud, an auditor can only provide rea­
sonable assurance, as opposed to absolute assurance, that the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. Audit risk is defined as follows:
Audit risk is the risk that the auditor expresses an inappropriate audit opinion when the financial 
statements are materially misstated.
In simple terms, audit risk is the risk that an auditor will issue an unqualified opinion on 
materially misstated financial statements. The auditor should perform the audit to reduce audit 
risk to a sufficiently low level before expressing an opinion on the overall financial statements.
While the auditor is ultimately concerned with audit risk at the financial statement level, 
as a practical matter audit risk must be considered at the account balance and disclosure lev­
els. We will use the term assertion to refer to consideration of audit risk at even lower levels. 
LO 4-1
Audit Risk
Consideration of audit risk at the assertion level means that the auditor must consider 
the risk that he or she will conclude that an assertion for a particular account balance (e.g., 
existence of accounts receivable or inventory) or a particular disclosure (e.g., valuation of 
amounts disclosed in a footnote dealing with stock compensation) is fairly stated, when in fact 
it is materially misstated.
Thus, at the assertion level, audit risk consists of
	
1.	 The risk that the relevant assertions related to the account balances or disclosures 
contain misstatements that could be material to the financial statements (inherent risk 
and control risk).
	
2.	 The risk that the auditor will not detect such misstatements (detection risk).
In other words, audit risk is the combination of these components—that the entity’s finan­
cial statements contain material misstatements and that the auditor fails to detect any such 
misstatements.
Achieved audit risk can be directly controlled by manipulating detection risk. The auditor 
manipulates detection risk by changing the scope (see Practice Insight) of the auditor’s test 
procedures. As the next section demonstrates, the audit risk model provides a framework for 
auditors to follow in planning audit procedures and evaluating audit results.
The Audit Risk Model
The auditor considers audit risk at the relevant assertion level because this directly assists the 
auditor to plan the appropriate audit procedures for the accounts, transactions, or disclosures. 
The risk that the relevant assertions are misstated consists of two components:
	
∙	 Inherent risk (IR). The susceptibility of an assertion in an account or disclosure to a 
misstatement due to error or fraud that could be material, either individually or when 
aggregated with other misstatements, before consideration of any related controls.
LO 4-2
Practice 
INSIGHT
Assertions are expressed or implied representations by management regarding the recognition, 
measurement, presentation, and disclosure of information in the financial statements and related 
disclosures. For example, when the financial statements contain an account balance of $30 million 
for inventory, management is representing that the inventory exists and is properly valued
Practice 
INSIGHT
When auditors use the term “scope” they are referring to the nature, timing, and extent of audit pro­
cedures, where “nature” refers to the type of evidence; “timing” refers to when the evidence will be 
examined; and “extent” refers to how much of the type of evidence will be gathered.

	
Chapter 4    Risk Assessment	
101
	
∙	 Control risk (CR). The risk that a misstatement that could occur in an assertion 
about an account or disclosure and that could be material, either individually or 
when aggregated with other misstatements, will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected, on a timely basis by the entity’s internal control.
The levels of inherent risk and control risk are functions of the entity and its environment. 
The auditor has little or no control over these risks. Auditing standards refer to the combina­
tion of IR and CR as the risk of material misstatement (RMM). Some auditors refer to this 
combination as “client risk” because it stems from decisions made by the entity (e.g., what 
kinds of business transactions to engage in, how much to invest in internal controls, etc.).
	
∙	 Detection risk (DR) is the risk that the procedures performed by the auditor to reduce 
audit risk to an acceptably low level will not detect a misstatement that exists and that 
could be material, either individually or when aggregated with other misstatements.
Detection risk is determined by the effectiveness of the audit procedures and how well 
the procedures are applied by the auditor. Detection risk is not reduced to zero because the 
auditor seldom examines 100 percent of the transactions in an account. As we discussed in 
Chapter 1 with the house inspector example, the auditor will examine a subset or sample of 
transactions. Furthermore, audit evidence is a collection of audit procedures, analysis, assess­
ments, and professional judgment and such processes are subject to human error (sometimes 
referred to as nonsampling risk). In other words the auditor could reach an erroneous conclu­
sion. Such professional judgment errors could be caused by the use of inappropriate audit 
procedures or misinterpretation of audit evidence and failure to recognize a misstatement or 
deviation. Of course, judgment errors can be reduced through adequate planning, proper 
assignment of audit staff to the engagement team, the application of professional skepticism, 
supervision and review of the audit work performed, and supervision and conduct of a firm’s 
audit practice in accordance with appropriate quality control standards.1
Stop and Think: How is detection risk related to inherent risk and control risk?
Detection risk has an inverse relationship to inherent risk and control risk. For example, 
if an auditor judges an entity’s inherent risk and control risk to be high, the auditor would 
accept a lower level of detection risk in order to achieve the planned level of audit risk. In 
the next section, you will learn that the auditor lowers achieved detection risk by performing 
additional audit procedures. Conversely, if inherent risk and control risk are low, the auditor 
can accept higher detection risk because there is a low likelihood that a material misstatement 
exists.
The audit risk model can be specified as
AR = RMM × DR
This model expresses the general relationship of audit risk to the auditor’s assessments of 
risk of material misstatement (inherent risk and control risk) and the risks that the auditor’s 
procedures will fail to detect a material misstatement in a relevant assertion (detection risk).
The determination of audit risk and the use of the audit risk model involve considerable 
judgment on the part of the auditor. The audit risk model assists the auditor in determining the 
scope of auditing procedures for an assertion in an account or disclosure. Auditing standards 
do not provide specific guidance on what is an acceptable level of audit risk.
At the completion of the audit, the actual or achieved level of audit risk is not known with 
certainty by the auditor. If the auditor assesses the achieved audit risk as being less than or 
equal to the planned level of audit risk, an unqualified report can be issued. If the assessment 
of the achieved level of audit risk is greater than the planned level, the auditor should either 
1See T. B. Bell, M. E. Peecher, and I. Solomon, The 21st Century Public Company Audit: Conceptual Elements of 
KPMG's Global Audit Methodology (KPMG 2005) for a detailed discussion of the importance of recognizing the 
potential for such issues when conducting an audit.

102	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
conduct additional audit work or qualify/modify the audit report. In either case, the judgments 
involved are often highly subjective.
In addition to audit risk, an auditor is subject to engagement risk. Engagement risk is the 
risk that the auditor is exposed to financial loss or damage to his or her professional reputa­
tion from litigation, adverse publicity, or other events arising in connection with the audited 
financial statements. For example, an auditor may conduct an audit in accordance with audit­
ing standards and still be sued by the entity or a third party. Although the auditor has complied 
with professional standards and may ultimately win the lawsuit, his or her professional repu­
tation may be damaged in the process by the negative publicity. Engagement risk cannot be 
directly controlled by the auditor, although some control can be exercised through the careful 
acceptance and continuance of clients.
Use of the Audit Risk Model
The audit risk model is not intended to be a precise formula that includes all factors influenc­
ing the assessment of audit risk. However, auditors find the logic that underlies the model 
useful when planning scoping decisions for audit procedures. The discussion that follows 
concerning the audit risk model is limited to its use as an audit planning tool. Three steps are 
involved in the auditor’s use of the audit risk model at the assertion level:
	
1.	 Setting a planned level of audit risk.
	
2.	 Assessing the risk of material misstatement.
	
3.	 Solving the audit risk equation for the appropriate level of detection risk.
In applying the audit risk model in this manner, the auditor assesses each component of 
the model using either quantitative or qualitative terms. In step 1, the auditor sets audit risk for 
each account balance or disclosure in such a way that, at the completion of the engagement, 
an opinion can be issued on the financial statements with an acceptably low level of audit risk. 
For publicly traded companies, auditors typically set planned audit risk at 5 percent or less. 
Step 2 requires that the auditor assess the risk of material misstatement (see Practice Insight 
above). To assess the risk of material misstatement, the auditor evaluates the entity’s business 
risks and how those business risks could lead to material misstatements. Figure 4–1 shows the 
relationship of the assessment of the entity’s business risks and risk of material misstatement 
to the audit risk model. The assessment of business risks is described in detail in the next two 
sections of the chapter. In step 3, the auditor determines the appropriate level of detection risk 
by solving the audit risk model as follows:
AR = RMM × DR
DR = AR/RMM
The auditor uses the planned level of detection risk to design the substantive audit 
procedures that will reduce audit risk to an acceptably low level. Consider the following 
numerical example:
Suppose that the auditor has determined that the planned audit risk for the accounts receivable bal­
ance should be set at .05 based on the significance of the account to the financial statements. By 
establishing a relatively low level of audit risk, the auditor is minimizing the possibility that the 
account may contain a material misstatement. Assume further that the auditor assesses the risk of 
material misstatement for accounts receivable to be .60. Substituting the values for AR and RMM 
LO 4-3
Practice 
INSIGHT
Auditing standards allow the auditor to directly assess the risk of material misstatement (RMM) or to 
separately assess inherent risk (IR) and control risk (CR). This choice is typically built into each audit 
firm’s methodology.

	
Chapter 4    Risk Assessment	
103
into the equation indicates that the auditor should set DR at approximately .08 (DR = .05/.60) for 
testing the accounts receivable balance. Thus, the auditor establishes the scope of the substantive 
audit procedures for accounts receivable so that there is only an 8 percent chance that a material 
misstatement, if present, is not detected.
Due to the subjectivity involved in judging the audit risk model’s components, many pub­
lic accounting firms find it more appropriate to use qualitative terms, rather than percentages, 
in the model. For example, planned audit risk might be classified into two categories, very 
low and low. Auditing standards state that audit risk must be reduced to at least a low level. 
Likewise, the risk of material misstatement and detection risk might be classified into three 
categories (e.g., low, moderate, or high). The logic behind the audit risk model is the same 
whether the auditor uses percentages or qualitative terms. When using qualitative terms, audit 
risk is set using one of the category choices. Similarly, the auditor selects the category for the 
risk of material misstatement that is most appropriate under the circumstances. The specified 
combination of audit risk and risk of material misstatement is then used to determine the 
appropriate level of detection risk. Following are three examples of the use of a qualitative 
approach to the audit risk model.

In Example 1, the auditor has determined that a very low level of audit risk is appropriate 
for this account because of its importance to the financial statements. The auditor has assessed 
the risk of material misstatement as high, indicating that there is a high risk of a material mis­
statement that was not prevented, or detected and corrected, by the internal control system. 
The auditor would then set detection risk as low. A low assessment for detection risk implies 
that the auditor will conduct a more careful or thorough investigation of this account than if 
the assessment of detection risk were high.

104	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Stop and Think: For Example 3 in the table above, why is the auditor setting DR at 
high? What does a high assessment of DR mean in terms of the level of audit testing? 
DR is set high because there is a low risk that a material misstatement is present in the 
financial statements and, as a result, the auditor needs to gather less evidence. 
Standard setters developed the audit risk model as a planning and evaluation tool. How­
ever, the model is only as good as the judgments and assessments used as inputs. In other 
words, when the model is used to revise an audit plan or to evaluate audit results, the actual 
or achieved level of audit risk may be smaller or larger than the audit risk indicated by the 
formula. This can occur because the auditor assesses the risk of material misstatement and 
such an assessment may be higher or lower than the actual risk of material misstatement that 
exists. Thus, the desired level of audit risk may not actually be achieved. While the audit risk 
model has limitations, it serves as an important tool that auditors can use for planning and 
evaluating an audit engagement.
The Auditor’s Risk Assessment Process
The auditor’s objective is to identify and assess the risks of material misstatement, whether 
due to fraud or error, at the financial statement and relevant assertion levels through under­
standing the entity and its environment, including the entity’s internal control. To properly 
assess the risk of material misstatement and engagement risk, the auditor performs risk 
assessment procedures. The auditor needs to understand management’s objectives and strate­
gies and the related business risks that may result in material misstatements. The following 
section discusses management’s strategies, objectives, and business risks. We then discuss the 
details of the auditor’s risk assessment process.
Management’s Strategies, Objectives, and Business Risks
Strategies are the operational approaches used by management to achieve objectives. To 
achieve their business objectives, managers pursue strategies, such as being the low-cost 
or high-quality provider of a product. Typical business objectives include growth in market 
share, first-rate reputation, and excellent service. Business risks are threats from significant 
conditions, events, circumstances, actions, or inactions that could adversely affect the entity’s 
ability to achieve its objectives and execute its strategies. For example, risks arise from the 
development of a new product because the product may fail or because flaws in the product 
may result in lawsuits or damage to the company’s reputation. Management is responsible for 
identifying such risks and responding to them. Usually, management addresses business risks 
by implementing a risk assessment process.
Business risk is a broader concept than the risk of material misstatement. However, most 
business risks have the potential to affect the financial statements either immediately or in the 
long run. Auditors need to identify business risks and understand the potential misstatements 
that may result.
Stop and Think: Consider an entity that sells goods to a declining customer base. What 
risks does this entity face? How will these risks impact the audit?
If the entity faces pressure to maintain historical profit margins, this may increase the 
risk of misstatement associated with the valuation of assets such as receivables and inven­
tory. A declining customer base may also have longer-term implications to the company’s 
overall health.

Auditor’s Risk Assessment Procedures
The auditor obtains an understanding of the entity and its environment by performing the 
following risk assessment procedures: inquiries of management, other entity personnel, and 
others outside the entity; analytical procedures; and observation and inspection.
Inquiries of Management, Other Entity Personnel, and Others Outside the Entity 
The auditor obtains information about the entity and its environment through inquiry of man­
agement, individuals responsible for financial reporting, and other personnel within the entity. 
Making inquiries of others within the entity may be useful in providing the auditor with a 
perspective different from that of management and those responsible for financial reporting. 
The auditor might make inquiries of
	
∙	 Those charged with governance (e.g., board of directors or audit committee).
	
∙	 Internal audit function.
	
∙	 Employees involved in initiating, authorizing, processing, or recording complex or 
unusual transactions.
	
∙	 In-house legal counsel.
	
∙	 Production, marketing, sales, and other personnel.
For example, inquiries directed to the internal audit function might relate to their activi­
ties concerning the design and operating effectiveness of the entity’s internal controls. The 
auditor might also inquire of the in-house legal counsel about issues such as litigation, com­
pliance with laws and regulations, and the meaning of contract terms.
Stop and Think: What information might be obtained from marketing or sales personnel? 
The auditor might learn about changes in the entity’s marketing strategies, sales trends, or 
contractual arrangements with its customers.
The auditor might inquire of others outside the entity. For example, the auditor may 
consider it is appropriate to make inquiries of customers, suppliers, or valuation specialists. 
Such discussions may provide information that will assist the auditor in uncovering fraud. For 
example, customers may report that they received large quantities of unordered products from 
the audit client just before year-end. This would be an indicator of overstated revenues.
Analytical Procedures  Analytical procedures are evaluations of financial information 
made through analysis of plausible relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data. 
Auditing standards require that the auditor perform analytical procedures as risk assessment 
procedures (sometimes referred to as planning or preliminary analytical procedures). Such 
procedures assist the auditor in understanding the entity and its environment and in identify­
ing areas that may represent specific risks relevant to the audit. Analytical procedures can be 
helpful in identifying the existence of unusual transactions or events and amounts, ratios, and 
trends that might have implications for audit planning. In performing analytical procedures, 
the auditor should develop expectations about plausible relationships that are expected to 
exist, based on the understanding of the entity and its environment. Analytical procedures are 
discussed in more detail in Chapter 5.
Observation and Inspection  Observation and inspection may support inquiries of man­
agement and others and also may provide information about the entity and its environment. 
Examples of such audit procedures include
	
∙	 Observation of entity activities and operations.
	
∙	 Inspection of documents, records, and internal control manuals.
	
∙	 Reading reports prepared by management, the audit committee or those charged with 
governance, and the internal audit function.

106	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
	
∙	 Visits to the entity’s premises and plant facilities.
	
∙	 Tracing transactions through the information system relevant to financial reporting, 
which may be performed as part of a walkthrough.
The auditor may also read about industry developments and trends, read the current 
year’s interim financial statements, and review regulatory or financial publications.
Stop and Think: What are some other sources of information that the auditor might 
examine to obtain a better understanding of the entity and it environment? 
Examples include knowledge from previous audits, consulting and tax engagements performed 
for the entity, reports prepared by analysts and rating agencies, and other external sources.
Assessing Business Risks
Obtaining an understanding of the entity and its environment is a continuous, dynamic pro­
cess of gathering, updating, and analyzing information throughout the audit. The goal of this 
process is to assess the business risks faced by the entity and how those risks are controlled or 
not controlled by the entity. Based on this knowledge, the auditor assesses the risk of material 
misstatement at the assertion level. Figure 4–2 provides an overview of the auditor’s assess­
ments of business risks and the risk of material misstatement (i.e., the auditor’s risk assessment 
process). Unless otherwise stated in the text, the risk of material misstatement refers to mis­
statements caused by errors or fraud.
The auditor’s understanding of the entity and its environment includes knowledge about 
the following categories:
	
∙	 Nature of the entity.
	
∙	 Industry, regulatory, and other external factors.
	
∙	 Objectives, strategies, and related business risks.
	
∙	 Entity performance measures.
	
∙	 Internal control.
In obtaining knowledge about each of these categories, the auditor should be particularly 
alert for the conditions and events that may indicate the existence of business risks.
Stop and Think: What are some conditions and events that might indicate that business 
risks exist? 
Some examples include significant changes in the entity caused by large acquisitions or reor­
ganizations, significant changes in the entity’s industry, new products or services, and opera­
tions in unstable countries.
Nature of the Entity  To understand the nature of the entity, the auditor should obtain 
information about the entity’s
	
∙	 business operations (e.g., the nature of revenue sources, products or services, 
and markets; the conduct of operations; alliances, joint ventures, and outsourcing 
activities; location of production facilities, warehouses, and offices; and key 
customers and important suppliers of goods and services).
	
∙	 investments and investment activities (e.g., planned or recent acquisitions or 
divestitures; investments and dispositions of securities and loans; capital investment 
activities; and investments in partnerships and joint ventures).
	
∙	 financing and financing activities (e.g., major subsidiaries and associated entities; 
debt structure; leasing arrangements; related parties; and the use of derivative 
financial instruments).

	
Chapter 4    Risk Assessment	
107
	
∙	 financial reporting (e.g., accounting principles and industry-specific practices; 
revenue recognition practices; accounting for fair values; and accounting for unusual 
or complex transactions).
An understanding of the nature of an entity gives the auditor a better idea of what poten­
tial misstatements might be found in the financial statements. For example, an entity with a 
complex structure may give rise to a risk of material misstatement as a result of the accounting 
for investments in joint ventures, subsidiaries, equity investments, or variable interest entities.
For public entities, the PCAOB states that the auditor should consider performing the 
following additional procedures as part of understanding the entity:
	
∙	 Reading public information about the company relevant to the evaluation of the 
likelihood of material financial statement and the effectiveness of the company’s 
internal control over financial reporting.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
	
∙	 Observing or reading transcripts of earnings calls conducted by management.
	
∙	 Obtaining information about significant unusual developments regarding trading 
activity in the company’s securities.
	
∙	 Obtaining an understanding of compensation arrangements with senior management, 
including incentive compensation arrangements, changes or adjustments to those 
arrangements, and special bonuses.
Industry, Regulatory, and Other External Factors  Industry, regulatory, and other 
external factors are relevant to the auditor’s understanding of the entity and in identifying 
risks of material misstatements. Some industries are subject to risks of material misstatement 
as a result of unique accounting estimates. For example, a property and casualty insurance 
company needs to establish loss reserves based on historical data that may be subject to mis­
statement. Table 4–1 presents examples of industry, regulatory, and other external factors that 
should be considered by the auditor.
Objectives, Strategies, and Related Business Risks  As discussed previously, the 
auditor must identify and understand the entity’s objectives and strategies used to achieve its 
objectives and the business risks associated with those objectives and strategies. Examples of 
business risks the auditor considers when developing an understanding of the entity’s objec­
tives and strategies include industry developments, new products, expansion of the business, 
and current and prospective financing arrangements.
Entity Performance Measures  Internally generated information used by management 
to measure and review the entity’s financial performance may include key performance indi­
cators, both financial and nonfinancial; budgets; variance analysis; subsidiary information 
and divisional, departmental, or other level performance reports; and comparisons of an enti­
ty’s performance with that of competitors. External parties (e.g., analysts and credit rating 
agencies) may also measure and review the entity’s financial performance. Internal measures 
provide management with information about progress toward meeting the entity’s objec­
tives. Thus, a deviation in the entity’s performance measures may indicate a risk of misstate­
ment in the related financial statement information. When the auditor intends to make use of 
the entity’s performance measures for the purpose of the audit, the auditor should consider 
whether the information provided is reliable and trustworthy and whether it is sufficiently 
detailed or precise.
Industry, Regulatory, and Other External Factors
Industry conditions:
 • The market and competition, including demand, capacity, and price competition
 • Cyclical or seasonal activity
 • Product technology relating to the entity’s products
 • Energy supply cost
Regulatory environment:
 • Accounting principles and industry specific practices
 • Regulatory framework for a regulated industry
 • Legislation and regulation that significantly affect the entity’s operations
 • Taxation (corporate and other)
 • Government policies currently affecting the conduct of the entity’s business
 • Environmental requirements affecting the industry and the entity’s business
Other external factors:
 • General economic conditions (e.g., recession, growth)
 • Interest rates and availability of financing
 • Inflation and currency revaluation

Chapter 4    Risk Assessment	
109
Internal Control  Internal control is the label given to the entity’s policies and procedures 
designed to provide reasonable assurance about the achievement of the entity’s objectives. 
Internal control is implemented by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other 
personnel. Because of the significance of internal control to the financial statement audit, we 
cover it in great detail in Chapter 6. To provide you with an introduction to the concept of 
internal control, here are several examples of policies and procedures that may be a part of an 
entity’s internal control:
	
∙	 Active and qualified board of directors and independent audit committee members.
	
∙	 Effective risk assessment process.
	
∙	 Competent and objective internal audit function.
	
∙	 Proper authorization of transactions (e.g., a supervisor must approve all purchases 
over $5,000).
	
∙	 Procedures to ensure assets exist (e.g., inventory counts).
	
∙	 Monitoring of controls (e.g., higher level supervisor reviews purchases over $5,000 to 
ensure all such transactions were properly authorized).
The auditor needs to understand and assess the effectiveness of internal control in order to 
identify the types of potential misstatements and factors that affect the risks of material mis­
statement. It also assists in designing appropriate audit procedures.
Evaluate the Entity’s Risk Assessment Process
Management has a responsibility to identify, control, and mitigate business risks that may 
affect the entity’s ability to achieve its objectives. The auditor should obtain information on 
the entity’s risk assessment process and whether it is operating effectively. If the entity’s 
response to the identified risk is adequate, the risk of material misstatement may be reduced. 
However, if the entity’s response to the identified risk is inadequate, the auditor’s assessment 
of the risk of material misstatement may increase. If the entity does not respond adequately 
to business risks, the auditor will have to develop tests to determine if any misstatements are 
present in the related account balances and disclosures. Chapter 6 provides coverage of the 
entity’s risk assessment process.
Assessing the Risk of Material Misstatement2
Based on knowledge of the entity and its environment, the auditor assesses the risk of material 
misstatement at the assertion level and determines the audit procedures that are necessary 
based on that risk assessment (see Figure 4–2). At this point in the risk assessment process, 
the auditor has identified the entity’s business risks. To assess the risk of material misstate­
ment, the auditor considers how the identified risks could result in a material misstatement in 
the financial statements. This includes considering how the entity’s risk assessment process 
may affect the likelihood and magnitude of potential misstatements. For example, the entity’s 
risk assessment process may have identified product obsolescence as a business risk that 
could result in a material misstatement to the inventory and cost-of-goods accounts. However, 
the entity’s response to the assessed risk was such that the auditor has determined that there is 
a low likelihood that such a misstatement could occur because the entity has installed strong 
controls that track inventory levels and market pricing.
This section will first review the types and causes of misstatements, and then focuses 
primarily on assessing the risk of material misstatement due to fraud, sometimes referred to 
as the fraud risk assessment.

Crime Survey, 2011: www.pwc.com) for information on the incidence of fraud.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Causes and Types of Misstatements3
Misstatements can result from errors or fraud. The term errors refers to unintentional mis­
statements of amounts or disclosures in financial statements. The term fraud refers to an 
intentional act by one or more among management, those charged with governance, employ­
ees, or third parties, involving the use of deception that results in a misstatement in the 
financial statements. Thus, the primary distinction between errors and fraud is whether the 
misstatement was intentional or unintentional. Unfortunately, it is often difficult to deter­
mine intent. For example, the auditor detects a misstatement in an account that requires an 
estimate, such as bad debt expense; it may be difficult to determine whether the misstatement 
was intentional.
Misstatements due to errors or fraud include
	
∙	 An inaccuracy in gathering or processing data from which financial statements are 
prepared.
	
∙	 An omission of an amount or disclosure.
	
∙	 A financial statement disclosure that is not presented in accordance with GAAP.
	
∙	 An incorrect accounting estimate arising from overlooking or clear misinterpretation 
of facts.
	
∙	 Judgments of management concerning accounting estimates that the auditor considers 
unreasonable or the selection or application of accounting policies that the auditor 
considers inappropriate.
Fraud can be classified into two types: (1) misstatements resulting from fraudulent finan­
cial reporting and (2) misstatements resulting from misappropriation of assets. The previ­
ous list of misstatements deals with fraudulent financial reporting. Misstatements arising 
from misappropriation of assets (sometimes referred to as defalcation) involve the theft of an 
entity’s assets where the theft causes the financial statements to be misstated. Examples of 
misappropriation include
	
∙	 Embezzling cash received.
	
∙	 Stealing physical assets and intellectual property.
	
∙	 Causing the entity to pay for goods or services not received.
	
∙	 Using an entity’s assets for personal use.
Stop and Think: What are some examples of intellectual property that might be stolen 
by a fraudster and how would it affect the value of the intellectual property?
Intellectual property includes intangible assets such as musical, literary, and artistic works. It 
also includes copyrights, trademarks, and patents. “Pirating” of music and movies results in 
lost revenues to entertainment companies.
3See A. Eilifsen and W. F. Messier, Jr., “Auditor Detection of Misstatements: A Review and Integration of Empirical 
Research,” Journal of Accounting Literature 2000 (19), pp. 1–43, for a detailed review of research studies that have 
examined auditor-detected misstatements.
Practice 
INSIGHT
In a study conducted by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, Report to the Nations (2014), 
financial statements accounted for some 9 percent of fraud cases but they had the highest median 
loss, at $1 million. The CFE Study found that financial statement fraud generally involves the inten­
tional misstatement or omission of material information from the organization’s financial reports. Asset 
misappropriation accounted for 85 percent with a median loss of $130,000. The major schemes that 
were used included check tampering, billing, and non-cash misappropriation.

	
Chapter 4    Risk Assessment	
111
Auditors find it useful to distinguish between factual misstatements, judgmental mis­
statements, and projected misstatements, described as follows:
	
∙	 Factual Misstatements These are misstatements about which there is no doubt. For 
example, an auditor may test a sales invoice and determine that the prices applied to 
the products ordered are incorrect. Once the products are correctly priced, the amount 
of misstatement is known. In such cases, the auditor knows the exact amount of the 
misstatement.
	
∙	 Judgmental Misstatements These are misstatements that arise from the judgments 
of management concerning accounting estimates that the auditor considers 
unreasonable or the selection or application of accounting policies that the auditor 
considers inappropriate.
	
∙	 Projected Misstatements These are the auditor’s best estimate of misstatements in 
populations, involving the projection of misstatements identified in an audit sample to 
the entire population from which the sample was drawn.
The Fraud Risk Assessment Process
As part of planning the audit, the auditor performs the following steps to assess fraud risks:
	
∙	 Discussion among the audit team members regarding the risks of material 
misstatement due to fraud.
	
∙	 Inquiries of management, audit committee, and others about their views on the risks 
of fraud and how it is addressed.
	
∙	 Consideration of any unusual or unexpected relationships that have been identified in 
performing analytical procedures in planning the audit.
	
∙	 Understanding of the entity’s period-end closing process and investigate unexpected 
period-end adjustments.
	
∙	 Identification and assessment of fraud risk factors.
The following three sections address the first, second, and last bulleted items.
Discussion among the Audit Team4   The audit team is required to hold discussions 
(referred to as brainstorming sessions) about the entity’s financial statements’ susceptibility 
to fraud. The engagement partner or manager should communicate with members of the audit 
team regarding the potential for material misstatement due to fraud. This brainstorming ses­
sion can be held separately, or concurrently, with the discussion required as part of under­
standing the entity and its environment. The engagement partner or manager should determine 
which audit team members to include in the communication, how it should occur, and the 
extent of the communication. The objectives of the brainstorming meeting are to
	
∙	 Share insights about the entity and its environment and the entity’s business risks.
	
∙	 Provide an opportunity for the team members to discuss how and where the entity 
might be susceptible to fraud.
	
∙	 Emphasize the importance of maintaining professional skepticism throughout the 
audit regarding the potential for material misstatement due to fraud.
Engagement team members should be encouraged to communicate and share information 
obtained throughout the audit that may affect the assessment of risks of material misstatement 
or the auditor’s responses to those risks.
LO 4-6

Reports from the Field,” The Accounting Review (July 2010), pp. 1273–1301, for information on the conduct of 
brainstorming meetings in real settings.

112	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
The auditor should conduct the engagement assuming there is a possibility that a mate­
rial misstatement due to fraud could be present, regardless of any prior beliefs or past expe­
rience with the entity and regardless of the auditor’s belief about management’s honesty 
and integrity.
Inquiries of Management, Audit Committee, and Others  The auditor should inquire 
about management’s knowledge of fraud within the entity. The auditor should also understand 
the programs and controls that management has established to mitigate specific risk factors 
and how well management monitors those programs and controls. Some of the inquiry would 
take place when the auditor obtains an understanding of the entity and its environment.
The entity’s audit committee should assume an active role in oversight of the assessment 
of the risk of fraud. The auditor should obtain an understanding of how the audit committee 
exercises its oversight activities, including direct inquiry of audit committee members. The 
auditor also should inquire of the internal audit function about its assessment of the risk of 
fraud, including whether management has satisfactorily responded to internal audit findings 
during the year.
The auditor should consider inquiries from others within the entity and third parties (e.g., 
vendors, customers, or regulators). It can be uncomfortable to inquire about potentially fraud­
ulent activities; however, it is much more uncomfortable to fail to detect a material fraud.
Identification and Assessment of Fraud Risk Factors  Three conditions are generally 
present when material misstatements due to fraud occur:
	
1.	 Management or other employees have an incentive or are under pressure that 
provides a reason to commit fraud.
	
2.	 Circumstances exist that provide an opportunity for a fraud to be carried out.
	
3.	 Those involved are able to rationalize committing a fraudulent act. Some individuals 
possess an attitude, character, or set of ethical values that allow them to knowingly 
and intentionally commit a dishonest act.
These three conditions are sometimes referred to as the fraud risk triangle.
Even honest individuals can commit fraud in an environment where sufficient pressure 
is being exerted on them. The greater the incentive or pressure, the more likely an individual 
will be able to rationalize the acceptability of committing fraud. Withholding evidence or 
misrepresenting information through falsified documentation, including forgery, may conceal 
fraud. Fraud also may be concealed through collusion among management, employees, or 
third parties.
Management has the ability to perpetrate fraud because it is in a position to directly or 
indirectly manipulate the accounting records and prepare fraudulent financial reports. In most 
cases, fraudulent financial reporting also involves some management override of controls.
Because of the characteristics of fraud, particularly those involving concealment through 
collusion; withheld, misrepresented, or falsified documentation; and the ability of manage­
ment to override or instruct others to override controls, an auditor may unknowingly rely 
on audit evidence that appears to be valid but in fact is false and fraudulent. Fraud risk fac­
tors related to fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets can be classified 
among the three conditions listed above.
Tables 4–2 through 4–4 present the risk factors related to each category of conditions for 
the potential for fraudulent financial reporting. Table 4–2 contains numerous risk factors that, 
if present, may suggest that management and others have incentives to manipulate financial 
reporting. For example, the entity may be facing increased competition that results in declin­
ing profit margins. Similarly, in the high-technology sector, rapid changes in technology can 
affect the profitability and the fair market value of products. Entities that have recurring oper­
ating losses and negative cash flow from operations may face bankruptcy, foreclosure, or 
takeover. In each of these situations, management may have incentives to manipulate reported 
earnings. Management (or the board of directors) may also be facing pressures to maintain the 

	
Chapter 4    Risk Assessment	
113
Risk Factors Relating to Incentives/Pressures to Report Fraudulently
 • Financial stability or profitability is threatened by economic, industry, or entity operating conditions, such as
	 —	 High degree of competition or market saturation, accompanied by declining margins.
	 —	 High vulnerability to rapid changes, such as changes in technology, product obsolescence, or interest rates.
	 —	 Significant declines in customer demand and increasing business failures in either the industry or overall economy.
	 —	 Operating losses making the threat of bankruptcy, foreclosure, or hostile takeover imminent.
	 —	 Rapid growth or unusual profitability, especially compared with that of other companies in the same industry.
	 —	 New accounting, statutory, or regulatory requirements.
 • Excessive pressure exists for management to meet requirements or expectations of third parties due to
	 —	 Profitability or trend-level expectations of investment analysts, institutional investors, significant creditors, or 
other external parties.
	 —	 Need to obtain additional debt or equity financing to stay competitive.
	 —	 Adverse effects of reporting poor financial results on significant pending transactions.
 • Management or the board of directors’ personal financial situations are threatened by the entity’s financial 
performance.
T A B L E  4 – 2
Risk Factors Relating to Opportunities to Report Fraudulently
 • The nature of the industry or the entity’s operations provide opportunities to engage in fraudulent financial report­
ing due to
	 —	 Significant related party transactions.
	 —	 Assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses based on significant estimates that involve subjective judgments or 
uncertainties that are difficult to corroborate.
	 —	 Significant, unusual, or highly complex transactions.
 • There is ineffective monitoring of management.
 • There is a complex or unstable organizational structure.
 • Internal control components are deficient.
T A B L E  4 – 3
Risk Factors Relating to Attitudes/Rationalizations to Report Fraudulently
 • Ineffective communication implementation, support, and enforcement of the entity’s values or ethical standards by 
management, or the communication of inappropriate values or ethical standards.
 • Nonfinancial management’s excessive participation in, or preoccupation with, the selection of accounting principles 
or the determination of significant estimates.
 • Known history of violations of securities laws or other laws and regulations, or claims against the entity, its senior 
management, or board members alleging fraud or violations of laws and regulations.
 • Excessive interest by management in maintaining or increasing the entity’s stock price or earnings trend.
 • A practice by management of committing to analysts, creditors, and other third parties to achieve aggressive or 
unrealistic forecasts.
 • Recurring attempts by management to justify marginal or inappropriate accounting on the basis of materiality.
T A B L E  4 – 4
entity’s reported earnings to meet analysts’ forecasts because bonuses or personal wealth is 
tied to the entity’s stock price (see Exhibit 4–1).
Stop and Think: Suppose that you are a member of the audit team assigned to the 
EarthWear audit participating in the fraud brainstorming session. What are one or two 
of the external/internal factors that might create pressure for EarthWear to commit 
fraud? (See Table 4–2.)
Management must also have the opportunity to commit the fraud. Table 4–3 lists the 
opportunities that may be available to management or the board of directors to perpetuate 
fraudulent financial reporting. For example, assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses may be 
based on subjective estimates that may be difficult for the auditor to corroborate. Two exam­
ples of such situations are the recognizing income on long-term contracts when the percent­
age of completion method is used and establishing the amount of loan loss reserves for a 
financial institution. Another opportunity for fraudulent financial reporting is when a single 

114	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
person or small group dominates management. Dominance by one individual may lead to pro­
cessing accounting transactions that are not consistent with the entity’s controls.
Risk factors reflective of attitudes/rationalizations by board members, management, 
or employees may allow them to engage in and/or justify fraudulent financial reporting. 
Table 4–4 lists a number of attitudes or rationalizations that may be used to justify fraudulent 
financial reporting. For example, the entity may have weak ethical standards for management 
behavior or poor communication channels for reporting such behavior. Management may fail 
to correct weaknesses in internal control or use inappropriate accounting. Last, management 
may have strained relationships with its predecessor and current auditors.
Misappropriation of Assets  Risk factors that relate to misstatements arising from mis­
appropriation of assets also are classified along the three conditions generally present when 
fraud exists. Some of the risk factors related to misstatements arising from fraudulent finan­
cial reporting also may be present when misstatements arising from misappropriation of assets 
exist (see Exhibit 4–2). Table 4–5 presents risk factors related to each category of conditions 
for the potential of misappropriation of assets. For example, an employee may have financial 
problems that create an incentive to misappropriate the cash.
Similarly, in order for the employee who has financial problems to misappropriate cash, 
he or she must have access to the cash. This is likely to occur only when there is inadequate 
segregation of duties or poor oversight by personnel responsible for the asset. Finally, an 
employee who has access to assets susceptible to misappropriation may have a change in 
behavior or lifestyle that may indicate he or she has misappropriated assets. See Koss Corpo­
ration discussion case for an example of such activities.
Olympus Corporation—Hiding Investment Losses
Olympus Corporation is a major Japanese manufacturer of optical and reprography products listed on the 
Tokyo Stock Exchange. Olympus employs close to 40,000 people around the world. At March 31, 2011, 
Olympus had $13.3 billion in assets, including $2.2 billion of goodwill. The Olympus scandal was precipi­
tated on October 14, 2011, when British-born Michael Woodford was suddenly ousted as chief executive 
after 2 weeks when he exposed “one of the biggest and longest-running loss-hiding arrangements in 
Japanese corporate history.”
Woodford alleged that his removal was related to several prior acquisitions he had been seek­
ing answers to, particularly the $2.2 billion deal in 2008 to acquire British medical equipment maker 
Gyrus Group. The merger and acquisition (M&A) fee for this transaction was $687 million paid to a 
middleman as a fee (approximately 31 percent of the purchase price) and ranks as the highest ever 
M&A fee.
On November 8, 2011, the company admitted that the company’s accounting practice was “inappropri­
ate” and that money had been used to cover losses on investments dating to the 1990s. The company 
blamed the inappropriate accounting on former senior management.
The loss scheme involved Olympus selling assets that incurred a loss to funds set up by Olympus itself. 
The Company later provided the financing needed to settle the loss under the cover of the Company’s 
acquisitions. More specifically, Olympus placed money into the funds by acquiring the entrepreneurial 
ventures owned by the funds at the substantially higher price than the real values, or by paying substan­
tially high fees to a third party who acted as the intermediary in the acquisition. This resulted in recogni­
tion of a large amount of goodwill, which later led to a goodwill impairment loss.
Since those losses were primarily hidden in goodwill according to the report, the loss constitutes 
approximately $1.8 billion of goodwill. Olympus stock incurred a significant drop in value.

Madoff’s $50 Billion Ponzi Scheme
In early December 2008, Bernie Madoff told his two sons that his investment advisory business, Bernard 
Madoff Investment Securities (BMIS), was basically a giant Ponzi scheme. Madoff had falsely represented 
to investors that returns were being earned on their accounts at BMIS and that he was investing their 
money in securities. Authorities believe that the fraud may date back at least three decades and estimated 
the losses at $17.3 billion. Madoff’s investors included many famous individuals and charities, some of 
whom lost their entire savings.
Epilogue: Madoff was found guilty and sentenced to 150 years in prison. Irving Pickard, the bank­
ruptcy trustee, has made payments so far of $7.2 billion to individuals who were defrauded. Madoff’s son, 
Mark, committed suicide 2 years to the day after his father turned himself in. In 2014, Madoff’s other son, 
Andrew, died of cancer.

Risk Factors Relating to the Misappropriation of Assets
Incentives/pressures:
 • Personal financial obligations may create pressure for management or employees with access to cash or other 
assets susceptible to theft to misappropriate those assets.
 • Adverse relationships between the entity and employees with access to cash or other assets susceptible to theft 
may motivate those employees to misappropriate those assets.
Opportunities:
 • Certain characteristics or circumstances may increase the susceptibility of assets to misappropriation (for example, 
large amounts of cash on hand or processed).
 • Inadequate internal control over assets may increase the susceptibility of misappropriation of those assets. For 
example, misappropriation of assets may exist because there is inadequate management oversight of employees 
responsible for assets (for example, inadequate supervision or monitoring of remote locations).
Attitudes/rationalizations:
 • Disregard for the need for monitoring or reducing risks related to misappropriations of assets.
 • Disregard for internal control over misappropriation of assets by overriding existing controls or by failing to correct 
known internal control deficiencies.
 • Changes in behavior or lifestyle that may indicate assets have been misappropriated.

The Auditor’s Response to the Results 
of the Risk Assessments
Figure 4–3 provides an overview of the process the auditor follows to respond to the results of 
the risk assessments. Once the risks of material misstatement have been identified, the auditor 
determines whether they relate more pervasively to the overall financial statements and poten­
tially affect many relevant assertions or whether the identified risks relate to specific relevant 
assertions related to accounts and disclosures.
Financial statement level risks are pervasive risks; that is, they apply to multiple compo­
nents on the financial statements. The auditor’s response to such risks may include
	
∙	 Assigning more experienced personnel or those with specialized knowledge to assess 
the risks of material misstatement due to fraud.
	
∙	 Evaluating whether the selection and application of accounting policies by the entity, 
particularly those related to subjective measurements and complex transactions, may 
be indicative of fraudulent financial reporting resulting from management’s effort to 
manage earnings, or a bias that may create a material misstatement.
	
∙	 Incorporating an element of unpredictability in the selection of the nature, timing, 
and extent of audit procedures.

No
Assess the risk of material misstatement at
the ﬁnancial statement and assertion levels.
As part of the risk assessment process, the auditor should determine if any of the risks 
identified require special audit consideration. If the auditor determines that any of the risks 
are significant, the auditor must determine the nature of the risk, the likely magnitude of the 
potential misstatement, and the likelihood of the risk occurring. Examples of the types of 
items that may result in significant risks include
	
∙	 Assertions identified with fraud risk factors.
	
∙	 Nonroutine or unsystematically processed transactions.
	
∙	 Significant accounting estimates and judgments.
	
∙	 Highly complex transactions.
	
∙	 Application of new accounting standards.
	
∙	 Revenue recognition (see Practice Insight below).
	
∙	 Industry specific issues.
When the auditor has determined that an assessed risk of material misstatement at a 
relevant assertion level is a significant risk, the auditor should perform tests of controls that 
mitigate the significant risk or substantive procedures that directly respond to the signifi­
cant risk.

Figure 4–4 provides a detailed overview of the audit risk model and the relationships of 
its components. It shows how planned levels for the components of the audit risk model (AR, 
IR, CR, and DR) relate to the assessed level of each component.
Evaluation of Audit Test Results
At the completion of the audit, the auditor should consider whether the accumulated results 
of audit procedures cause the financial statements to be materially misstated. If the auditor 
concludes that the total misstatements cause the financial statements to be materially mis­
stated, the auditor should request that management eliminate the material misstatement. If 
management does not eliminate the material misstatement, the auditor should issue a quali­
fied/modified or adverse opinion. On the other hand, if the uncorrected total misstatements 
do not cause the financial statements to be materially misstated, the auditor should issue an 
unqualified opinion.
If the auditor has determined that the misstatement is or may be the result of fraud, and 
either has determined that the effect could be material to the financial statements or has been 
unable to evaluate whether the effect is material, the auditor should
	
∙	 Attempt to obtain audit evidence to determine whether, in fact, material fraud has 
occurred and, if so, its effect.
LO 4-8
Practice 
INSIGHT
Auditing standards state that the auditor should presume that there is a fraud risk involving improper 
revenue recognition on every audit engagement. The auditor must evaluate the types of revenue or 
revenue transactions that are subject to such a risk.

118	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
	
∙	 Consider the implications for other aspects of the audit.
	
∙	 Discuss the matter and the approach to further investigation with an appropriate level 
of management that is at least one level above those involved in committing the fraud 
and with senior management.
	
∙	 Suggest that the appropriate level of management consult with legal counsel.
If the results of the audit tests indicate a significant risk of fraud, the auditor should con­
sider withdrawing from the engagement and communicating the reasons for withdrawal to the 
audit committee or others with equivalent authority and responsibility.
Documentation of the Auditor’s Risk Assessment 
and Response
Standards require extensive documentation of the auditor’s risk assessment procedures (includ­
ing fraud risk assessment) and audit responses to identified risks. For example, the auditor 
should document the risk of material misstatement for all material accounts and disclosures in 
terms of the related assertions. Other areas that require documentation include the following:
	
∙	 The discussion among the engagement team, the significant decisions reached, how 
and when the discussion occurred, and the audit team members who participated.
	
∙	 The steps performed in obtaining knowledge about the entity’s business and its 
environment, including documentation of
  —  The risks identified.
  —  An evaluation of management’s response to such risks.
  —  The auditor’s assessment of the risk of error or fraud after considering the entity’s 
response.
	
∙	 Fraud risks or other conditions that caused the auditor to believe that additional audit 
procedures or other responses were required to address such risks or other conditions.
	
∙	 The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures performed in response to the risks of 
material misstatement due to fraud and the results of that work.
	
∙	 The nature of the communications about error or fraud made to management, the 
audit committee, and others.

Stop and Think: Briefly review this exhibit. After considering the responses listed on 
the document, how would this information guide the planning of your audit?
LO 4-9
Communications about Fraud to Management, 
the Audit Committee, and Others
Whenever the auditor has found evidence that a fraud may exist, that matter should be brought 
to the attention of an appropriate level of management. Fraud involving senior management 
and fraud that causes a material misstatement of the financial statements should be reported 
directly to the audit committee. In addition, the auditor should reach an understanding with 
the audit committee regarding the expected nature and extent of communications about mis­
appropriations perpetrated by lower-level employees.
The disclosure of fraud to parties other than the entity’s senior management and its 
audit committee ordinarily is not part of the auditor’s responsibility and ordinarily would be

Risk Factors
Description/Response
Any Remaining Risk
What are the entity’s major sources of 
revenue, including the nature of its 
products and/or services?
EarthWear Clothiers generates revenue mainly through 
the sale of high-quality clothing for outdoor sports, such 
as hiking, skiing, fly-fishing, and white-water 
kayaking. The company’s product lines also include 
casual clothes, accessories, shoes, and soft luggage.
These sales are made mainly through the company’s toll-
free number and over its Internet websites. In 2015, 
Internet sales accounted for 21 percent of total revenue.
No. The company uses conservative 
methods to record revenue and 
provides an adequate reserve for 
returned merchandise.
Who are the entity’s key customers?
The company’s key customers are the 21.5 million persons 
on its mailing list, approximately 7 million of whom are 
viewed as “current customers” because they have 
purchased from the company in the last 24 months.
Market research as of January 2015 indicates that 
approximately 50 percent of customers are in the 
35–54 age group and had a median income of 
$62,000. Almost two-thirds are in professional or 
managerial positions.
No.
Who are the entity’s key suppliers?
During 2015, the company had purchase orders for 
merchandise from about 300 domestic and foreign 
manufacturers, including intermediaries (agents). One 
manufacturer and one intermediary accounted for 
about 14 and 29 percent of the company’s received 
merchandise dollars, respectively, in 2015. In 2015, 
about 80 percent of the merchandise was imported, 
mainly from Asia, Central America, Mexico, 
South America, and Europe. The remaining 20 percent 
was made in the United States. The company will con­
tinue to take advantage of worldwide sourcing without 
sacrificing customer service or quality standards.
Yes. The company would be subject to 
some risk in finding alternative sourcing 
if this manufacturer and/or intermediary 
experiences prolonged work stoppages 
or economic problems. The availability 
and cost of certain foreign products may 
be affected by United States and other 
countries’ trade policies, economic 
events, and the value of the U.S. dollar 
relative to foreign currencies.
What is the entity’s organizational structure?
The company has a well-developed organizational 
structure with clear lines of authority among the 
various operating departments and staff functions. The 
organizational structure is appropriate for EarthWear’s 
activities.
No.
Where are its major locations?
Boise, Idaho, is the main corporate location. EarthWear 
also has phone and distribution centers in the United 
Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. During 2015, Earth­
Wear expanded its global Internet presence by launch­
ing sites in France, Italy, Ireland, and several eastern 
European countries.
Yes. France and Italy have restrictive trade 
laws where local companies get a 
certain degree of protection from the 
government when their markets are 
threatened. Political instability in the 
eastern European countries could affect 
EarthWear’s sales activities in these 
countries.
What are the entity’s major assets?
The major assets of the company are inventory; property, 
plant, and equipment; and its customer mailing list.
No.
What are the entity’s major liabilities?
The company has no long-term debt. However, it 
maintains a line of credit for financing purchases during 
the peak purchasing season.
No. The company has adequate cash flow 
to meet its current obligations.
What are the entity’s financial characteristics 
including financing sources and current 
and prospective financial condition?
The company uses its line of credit to meet its normal 
financing activities. Overall the company’s financial 
condition is good.
No.
Are there any potential related parties?
No.
No.
Are there any individually significant events 
and transactions such as acquisitions or 
disposals of subsidiaries, businesses, or 
product lines during the year?
The expansion of the company’s Internet presence to 
France, Italy, Ireland, and several eastern European 
countries.
Yes. Restrictive trade laws and the potential 
for political instability in the eastern 
European countries.
Does the entity have any major uncertainties 
or contingencies?
No.
No.

precluded by the auditor’s ethical or legal obligations of confidentiality. The auditor should 
recognize, however, that in the following circumstances a duty to disclose outside the entity 
may exist:
	
∙	 To comply with certain legal and regulatory requirements.
	
∙	 To a successor auditor when the successor makes inquiries of the predecessor auditor 
about the client.
	
∙	 In response to a subpoena.
	
∙	 To a funding agency or other specified agency in accordance with requirements for 
the audits of entities that receive governmental financial assistance.
KEY TERMS
Analytical procedures. Evaluations of financial information made through analysis of plau­
sible relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data.
Audit procedures. Specific acts performed by the auditor in gathering evidence to determine 
if specific assertions are being met.
Audit risk. The risk that the auditor expresses an inappropriate audit opinion when the finan­
cial statements are materially misstated.
Business risks. Risks resulting from significant conditions, events, circumstances, and 
actions or inactions that could adversely affect management’s ability to execute its strategies 
and to achieve its objectives, or through the setting of inappropriate objectives or strategies.
Control risk. The risk that a misstatement that could occur in an assertion about an account 
or disclosure and that could be material, either individually or when aggregated with other 
misstatements, will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis by the 
entity’s internal control.
Detection risk. The risk that the procedures performed by the auditor will not detect a mis­
statement that exists and that could be material, either individually or when aggregated with 
other misstatements.
Engagement risk. The risk that the auditor is exposed to financial loss or damage to his or 
her professional reputation from litigation, adverse publicity, or other events arising in con­
nection with financial statements audited and reported on.
Errors. Unintentional misstatements or omissions of amounts or disclosures. 
Factual misstatements. These are misstatements about which there is no doubt. For exam­
ple, an auditor may test a sales invoice and determine that the prices applied to the products 
ordered are incorrect. Once the products are correctly priced, the amount of misstatement is 
known. In such cases, the auditor knows the exact amount of the misstatement.
Fraud. An intentional act by one or more among management, those charged with gover­
nance, employees, or third parties, involving the use of deception that results in a misstate­
ment in the financial statements.
Inherent risk. The susceptibility of an assertion in an account or disclosure to a misstatement 
due to error or fraud that could be material, either individually or when aggregated with other 
misstatements, before consideration of any related controls.
Judgmental misstatements. These are misstatements that arise from the judgments of man­
agement concerning accounting estimates that the auditor considers unreasonable or the 
selection or application of accounting policies that the auditor considers inappropriate.
Nonsampling risk. The risk that auditors will make judgment errors caused by the use of 
inappropriate audit procedures or misinterpretation of audit evidence and failure to recognize 
a misstatement or deviation.
Projected misstatements. These are the auditor’s best estimate of misstatements in popula­
tions, involving the projection of misstatements identified in an audit sample to the entire 
population from which the sample was drawn.

	
Chapter 4    Risk Assessment	
121
Risk assessment. The identification, analysis, and management of risks relevant to the prepa­
ration of financial statements that are fairly presented in conformity with GAAP.
Risk of material misstatement. The risk that the financial statements are materially mis­
stated prior to the audit. It represents the combination of inherent risk and control risk.
Scope of the audit. Refers to the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures, where nature 
refers to the type of evidence; timing refers to when the evidence will be gathered; and extent 
refers to how much of the type of evidence will be evaluated.
Significant risk. A risk of material misstatement that is important enough to require special 
audit consideration.

should be assessed and what effect that assessment will have on detection risk.
	
a.	 Johnson, Inc., is a fast-growing trucking company operating in the southeastern 
part of the United States. The company is publicly held, but Ivan Johnson and 
his sons control 55 percent of the stock. Ivan Johnson is chairman of the board 
and CEO. He personally makes all major decisions with little consultation with 
the board of directors. Most of the directors, however, are either members of the 
Johnson family or long-standing friends. The board basically rubber-stamps Ivan 
Johnson’s decisions.
	
b.	 MaxiWrite Corporation is one of several companies engaged in the manufacture 
of high-speed, high-capacity data storage devices. The industry is very competi­
tive and subject to quick changes in technology. MaxiWrite’s operating results 
would place the company in the second quartile in terms of profitability and 
financial position. The company has never been the leader in the industry, with its 
products typically slightly behind the industry leader’s in terms of performance.

DISCUSSION CASE
	
LO 4-4, 4-5	
4-33	 Koss Corporation: How $34 Million Disappeared. Koss Corporation is a pub­
licly traded company that designs and sells stereo headphones. The Koss family 
controls a majority of the Company’s stock. On November 17, 2010, Sujata “Sue” 
Sachdeva, the former Vice-President of Finance was sentenced to 11 years in prison 
for embezzling $34 million from the Company. Her attorney claimed that she was 
a shopaholic. From 1992 to 2009, Sachdeva was the Principal Accounting Officer, 
Secretary, and Vice-President of Finance at Koss. As a result of the embezzlement, 
Koss Corporation was required to restate its financial statements for 2008, 2009, and 
the first quarter of 2010.
	
	
	 	
Sachdeva used the embezzled funds to sustain a lavish lifestyle including pur­
chasing a vacation ownership interest in Hawaii, a Mercedes Benz, and other auto­
mobiles. She also used the proceeds to pay for luxury travel and numerous personal 
items, including luxury clothing, furs, designer shoes, jewelry, and art. One neighbor 

126	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
stated that packages delivered to her front porch would sometimes reach 6 feet high! 
Sachdeva also maintained a large household staff. Such purchases were well beyond 
her Koss salary (approximately $175,000). She explained her life style by stating that 
her husband earned a couple of million dollars a year and that they both came from 
wealthy families.
	
	
	 	
The massive misappropriation was ultimately discovered when American Express 
notified the Company that funds were being wired from a Company bank account to 
pay for expenses on Sachdeva’s personal credit card. According to the SEC, Sachdeva 
authorized at least 206 wire transfers of funds from Koss bank accounts to pay for her 
American Express credit card bills and issued more than 500 cashier’s checks from 
company accounts to pay for personal expenses. Sachdeva used the cashier’s checks 
to make direct payments to retailers, such as Neiman Marcus and Saks Fifth Avenue. 
Sachdeva attempted to conceal the identities of the recipients of the checks by using 
acronyms on the checks such as “S.F.A. Inc.” for Saks Fifth Avenue, “N.M. Inc.” 
for Neiman Marcus, and others. Sachdeva was able to conceal the fraud by direct­
ing other Koss employees to make numerous fraudulent entries in Koss’s books and 
records. Julie Mulvaney, the Company’s senior accountant who was responsible for 
making journal entries, reconciling accounts receivable, reconciling the Company’s 
bank statements, ordering cashier’s checks, processing wire transfers, and checking 
the daily bank account balances assisted Sachdeva in covering up the fraud.
	
	
	 	
Other information about the Company:
	
∙	 Michael Koss simultaneously held 5 senior management positions: Vice 
Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Operating Officer, President, and Chief Finan­
cial Officer. Koss had little or no educational background or experience in the 
areas of accounting or finance and allegedly delegated important responsibilities 
typically performed by the CFO to Sachdeva on a regular basis.
	
∙	 Koss did not have an internal audit function.
	
∙	 Koss Corporation’s control environment appears to have been remarkably relaxed 
and its corporate board rarely changed. Excluding a member added in 2006 and 
founder John Koss, board members had an average tenure of 27 years.
	
∙	 Unlike the proxy statements of typical public companies, Koss made no mention 
of any accounting expertise among audit committee members.
	
∙	 Because it was a small company, Koss was not subject to a section of the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires outside auditors to evaluate a company’s inter­
nal controls over financial reporting.
	
∙	 During the embezzlement, Koss’s audit fees were reduced by half from $114,900 
in 2007 to $63,600 in 2008.
	
∙	 In 2006, Sachdeva co-chaired a fundraising gala for Big Brothers Big Sisters with 
one of Koss’s outside auditors.

his chapter discusses in depth the third of the three fundamental audit 
concepts introduced in Chapter 1: audit evidence. Audit evidence is the 
information used by the auditor in arriving at the conclusions on which 
the audit opinion is based, including the information contained in the account­
ing records underlying the financial statements and other sources. In Chapter 
1, we indicated that auditing is essentially a set of conceptual tools that guide 
an auditor in collecting and evaluating evidence regarding others’ assertions, 
and we assured you that these conceptual tools are extremely useful in a vari­
ety of settings. We encourage you to keep this perspective in mind as you 
study Chapter 5. While this chapter does contain some lists you will likely want 
to commit to memory (e.g., management assertions and characteristics of audit 
evidence), remember that these are not just lists—they constitute powerful 
conceptual tools that can help you in almost any setting that requires you to 
collect and evaluate evidence. Understanding the nature and characteristics of 
evidence is fundamental to effective auditing and is a key part of the concep­
tual tool kit we hope to help you acquire as you go through this book.
On a typical audit most of the auditor’s work involves obtaining and eval­
uating evidence using procedures such as inspection of records and exter­
nal confirmations to test the fair presentation of the financial statements. To 
perform this task effectively and efficiently, an auditor must thoroughly under­
stand the important aspects of audit evidence. This includes understanding 
how audit evidence relates to financial statement assertions and the auditor’s 
report, the sufficiency and appropriateness of evidence, types of audit pro­
cedures, and the documentation of evidence in the working papers. Each of 
these topics is covered in this chapter. In addition, this chapter contains two 
Advanced ­Modules that discuss the proper use of analytical procedures.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
The Relationship of Audit Evidence  
to the Audit Report
Auditing standards provide the basic framework for the auditor’s understanding of audit evi­
dence and its use in supporting his or her opinion on the financial statements. The auditor 
gathers evidence by conducting audit procedures to test management assertions. Chapter 3 
covers the types of audit procedures used to gather evidence. This evidence serves as the 
support for the auditor’s opinion about whether the financial statements are fairly presented. 
Figure 5–1 presents an overview of the relationships among the financial statements, manage­
ment assertions about components of the financial statements, audit procedures, and the audit 
report. More specifically, the financial statements reflect management’s assertions about the 
various financial statement components. The auditor tests management’s assertions by con­
ducting audit procedures that provide evidence on whether each relevant management asser­
tion is supported. When the evidence supports management’s assertions, the auditor can issue 
an unqualified audit report.
Auditors typically divide financial statements into components or segments in order to 
manage the audit. A component can be a financial statement account (e.g., accounts receiv­
able) or a business process (e.g., the revenue process). Sometimes business processes are 
referred to as transaction cycles. Business processes support functions such as sales and 
services, materials acquisition, production and distribution, human resource manage­
ment, and treasury management. This text focuses on how auditors examine business 
processes and related transactions, and financial statement accounts. Examining business pro­
cesses and their related accounts allows the auditor to gather evidence by understanding the 
processing of related transactions through the information system from their origin to their 
ultimate disposition in the accounting journals and ledgers. Later chapters in this text will 
help you understand each of the major business processes that auditors typically encounter on 
an engagement.

Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation

Management is responsible for the fair presentation of the financial statements. Assertions 
are expressed or implied representations by management regarding the recognition, measure­
ment, presentation, and disclosure of information in the financial statements and related dis­
closures. For example, when the balance sheet contains a line item for accounts receivable of 
$5 million, management asserts that those receivables exist and have a net realizable value of 
$5 million. Management also asserts that the accounts receivable balance arose from selling 
goods or services on credit in the normal course of business.
Stop and Think: Take a moment and consider what the relevant management ­assertions 
are when the financial statements show a net sales amount of $100 million.
Under current auditing standards, management assertions fall into the following 
categories:
	
∙	 Assertions about classes of transactions and events for the period under audit
	
∙	 Assertions about account balances at the period end
	
∙	 Assertions about presentation and disclosure
Management Assertions
LO 5-2
Practice 
INSIGHT
Auditing standards allow the auditor to use the categories of assertions as shown here or to express 
them differently. For example, the PCAOB standards do not separate the assertions into the three 
categories presented here. Instead they just list five assertions (existence/occurrence, complete­
ness, valuation/allocation, rights and obligations, and presentation and disclosure). We use the three 
categories presented here (consistent with ASB and IAASB standards) because we believe that 
tests of assertions are more easily understood when considered separately in terms of transactions, 
account balances, and disclosures.
Table 5–1 presents the definitions of each assertion by category, while Table 5–2 shows 
how the assertions are related across categories.
Pay close attention to the wording of the assertions as defined and described below. 
The way auditors use certain words as they relate to assertions may differ somewhat from 
your everyday usage of the terms, and part of mastering auditing is learning the language of 
auditors.
Assertions about Classes of Transactions 
and Events during the Period
Assertions about classes of transactions and events relate to the transactions that flow through 
a particular business process and accumulate in one or more financial statement accounts. 
Transaction-related assertions help the auditor conceptualize, plan, and perform audit 
procedures.
Occurrence  The occurrence assertion relates to whether all recorded transactions and 
events have occurred and pertain to the entity. For example, management asserts that all rev­
enue transactions recorded during the period were valid transactions. The occurrence asser­
tion is relevant for revenue transactions because the entity’s personnel might have incentives 
to record fictitious transactions. Occurrence is sometimes also referred to as validity.
Completeness  The completeness assertion relates to whether all transactions and events 
that occurred during the period have been recorded. For example, if an entity fails to record 

132	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Definitions of Management Assertions by Category
Assertions about classes of transactions and events for the period under audit:
 • Occurrence—transactions and events that have been recorded have occurred and pertain to the entity (sometimes referred to as validity).
 • Completeness—all transactions and events that should have been recorded have been recorded.
 • Authorization—all transactions and events have been properly authorized.
 • Accuracy—amounts and other data relating to recorded transactions and events have been recorded appropriately.
 • Cutoff—transactions and events have been recorded in the correct accounting period.
 • Classification—transactions and events have been recorded in the proper accounts.
Assertions about account balances at the period end:
 • Existence—assets, liabilities, and equity interests exist.
 • Rights and obligations—the entity holds or controls the rights to assets, and liabilities are the obligations of the entity.
 • Completeness—all assets, liabilities, and equity interests that should have been recorded have been recorded.
 • Valuation and allocation—assets, liabilities, and equity interests are included in the financial statements at appropriate amounts, and any resulting valu­
ation or allocation adjustments are appropriately recorded.
Assertions about presentation and disclosure:
 • Occurrence and rights and obligations—disclosed events, transactions, and other matters have occurred and pertain to the entity.
 • Completeness—all disclosures that should have been included in the financial statements have been included.
 • Classification and understandability—financial information is appropriately presented and described, and disclosures are clearly expressed.
 • Accuracy and valuation—financial and other information is disclosed fairly and in appropriate amounts.

a valid revenue transaction, the revenue account will be understated. Note that the auditor’s 
concern with the completeness assertion is opposite the concern for occurrence. Failure to 
meet the completeness assertion results in an understatement in the related account, while 
failure to meet the occurrence assertion results in an overstatement in the account.
Authorization  The authorization assertion relates to whether all transactions have been 
properly authorized. For example, the purchase of a new manufacturing facility should be 
approved by the board of directors. Auditing standards use the word “accuracy” to reflect that 

	
Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
133
transactions and events have been both recorded accurately and properly authorized. Since an 
unauthorized transaction could be accurately recorded, we have found that it is easier to think 
of proper authorization and accurate recording as separate assertions.
Accuracy  The accuracy assertion addresses whether amounts and other data relating to 
recorded transactions and events have been recorded appropriately. Generally accepted 
accounting principles establish the appropriate method for recording a transaction or event. 
For example, the amount recorded for the cost of a new machine includes its purchase price 
plus all reasonable costs to install it.
Cutoff  The cutoff assertion relates to whether transactions and events have been recorded 
in the correct accounting period. For example, the auditor may want to test proper cutoff of 
revenue transactions at December 31, 2015. The auditor can examine a sample of shipping 
documents and sales invoices for a few days before and after year-end to test whether the sales 
transactions are recorded in the proper period. The objective is to determine that all 2015 
sales and no 2016 sales have been recorded in 2015. Thus, the auditor examines the shipping 
documents to ensure that no 2016 sales have been recorded in 2015 and that no 2015 sales are 
recorded in 2016.
Classification  The classification assertion is concerned with whether transactions and 
events have been recorded in the proper accounts. For example, management asserts that 
maintenance costs to repair a machine that do not add to its usefulness are properly charged to 
the repairs and maintenance expense account and not to the machine asset account.
Assertions about Account Balances at the Period End
Assertions about account balances relate directly to the ending balances of the accounts 
included in the financial statements. Balance-related assertions help the auditor conceptual­
ize, plan, and perform audit procedures.
Existence  The assertion about existence addresses whether ending balances of assets, lia­
bilities, and equity interests included in the financial statements actually exist at the date of 
the financial statements. For example, management asserts that inventory shown on the bal­
ance sheet exists and is available for sale.
Rights and Obligations  The assertions about rights and obligations address whether the 
entity holds or controls the rights to assets included on the financial statements, and that 
liabilities are the obligations of the entity. For example, amounts capitalized for leases reflect 
assertions that the entity has rights to leased property and that the corresponding lease liabil­
ity represents an obligation of the entity.
Completeness  The assertion about completeness addresses whether all assets, liabilities, 
and equity interests that should have been included as ending balances on the financial state­
ments have been included. For example, management implicitly asserts that the ending bal­
ance shown for accounts payable on the balance sheet includes all such liabilities as of the 
balance sheet date.
Valuation and Allocation  Assertions about valuation or allocation address whether 
assets, liabilities, and equity interests included in the financial statements are at appropriate 
amounts and any resulting valuation or allocation adjustments are appropriately recorded. For 
example, management asserts that inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value on 
the balance sheet. Similarly, management asserts that the cost of property, plant, and equip­
ment is systematically allocated to appropriate accounting periods by recognizing deprecia­
tion expense.

134	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Assertions about Presentation and Disclosure
This category of assertions relates to presentation of information in the financial statements 
and disclosures in the footnotes that are directly related to a specific transaction or account bal­
ance (e.g., disclosures related to property and equipment) and those that apply to the financial 
statements in general (e.g., the footnote for the summary of significant accounting policies).
Occurrence and Rights and Obligations  The assertions about occurrence and rights 
and obligations address whether disclosed events, transactions, and other matters have 
occurred and pertain to the entity. For example, when management presents capitalized lease 
transactions on the balance sheet as leased assets, the related liabilities as long-term debt, and 
the related footnote, it is asserting that a lease transaction occurred, it has a right to the leased 
asset, and it owes the related lease obligation to the lessor.
Completeness  The completeness assertion in this category relates to whether all disclo­
sures that should have been included in the financial statements have been included. There­
fore, management asserts that no material disclosures have been omitted from the footnotes 
and other disclosures accompanying the financial statements.
Classification and Understandability  The assertions related to classification and 
understandability address whether the financial information is appropriately presented and 
described, and disclosures are clearly expressed. For example, management asserts that the 
portion of long-term debt shown as a current liability will mature in the current year. Similarly, 
management asserts that all major restrictions on the entity resulting from debt covenants are 
disclosed in footnotes and are able to be understood by the users of the financial statements.
Accuracy and Valuation  The accuracy and valuation assertions address whether finan­
cial and other information is disclosed fairly and in appropriate amounts. For example, when 
management discloses the fair value of stock or bond investments, it is asserting that these 
financial instruments are properly valued in accordance with GAAP. In addition, management 
may disclose in a footnote other information related to financial instruments.
Stop and Think: Consider how auditors use the sets of management assertions we have 
just discussed.
The assertions collectively provide a road map for the auditor in determining what evi­
dence to collect regarding various transactions, account balances, and required financial 
statement disclosures. The auditor determines the type of evidence to gather by considering 
what possible misstatements could occur. Table 5–3 shows the management assertions for

the accounts receivable balance. It also shows some of the misstatements that might occur if 
management’s assertions are not correct. For example, the existence assertion might not be 
met if the accounts receivable balance includes fictitious customers. Management assertions 
also guide the auditor in designing audit procedures to collect the needed evidence, as well 
as assisting the auditor in evaluating the appropriateness and sufficiency of the evidence. 
For example, the management assertions help the auditor focus his or her attention on all the 
various aspects of transactions, account balances, and required disclosures that need to be 
considered—they help the auditor ensure that “all the bases are covered.” As such, the three 
sets of management assertions constitute a powerful conceptual tool in the auditor’s toolbox.
The Concepts of Audit Evidence
Audit evidence is the information used by the auditor in arriving at the conclusions on which 
the audit opinion is based, and it includes the information contained in the accounting records 
underlying the financial statements and other information. A solid understanding of the char­
acteristics of evidence is obviously an important conceptual tool for auditors as well as for 
professionals in a variety of other settings. The following concepts of audit evidence are 
important to understanding the conduct of the audit:
	
∙	 The nature of audit evidence.
	
∙	 The sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence.
	
∙	 The evaluation of audit evidence.
The Nature of Audit Evidence
The nature of the evidence refers to the form or type of information, which includes account­
ing records and other available information. Accounting records include the records of ini­
tial entries and supporting records, such as checks and records of electronic fund transfers; 
invoices; contracts; the general and subsidiary ledgers, journal entries, and other adjustments 
to the financial statements that are not reflected in formal journal entries; and records such as 
work sheets and spreadsheets supporting cost allocations, computations, reconciliations, and 
disclosures. Other information that the auditor may use as audit evidence includes minutes 
of meetings; confirmations from third parties; industry analysts’ reports; comparable data 
about competitors (benchmarking); controls manuals; information obtained by the auditor 
from such audit procedures as inquiry, observation, and inspection; and other information 
developed by, or available to, the auditor that permits the auditor to reach conclusions through 
valid reasoning.
For some entities, accounting records and other information may be available only in 
electronic form. Thus, source documents such as purchase orders, bills of lading, invoices, and 
checks are replaced with electronic messages or electronic images. In such cases, electronic 
evidence may exist at only a certain point in time and may not be retrievable later. This may 
require the auditor to select sample items several times during the year rather than at year-end.
The Sufficiency and Appropriateness of Audit Evidence
Sufficiency is the measure of the quantity of audit evidence. Appropriateness is a measure 
of the quality of audit evidence. Sufficiency and appropriateness of audit evidence are inter­
related. The auditor must consider both concepts when assessing risks and designing audit 
procedures.
The quantity of audit evidence needed is affected by the risk of material misstatement 
and by the quality of the audit evidence gathered. Thus, the greater the risk of material mis­
statement, the more audit evidence is likely to be required to meet the audit test. And the 
higher the quality of the evidence, the less evidence that may be required to meet the audit 
test. Accordingly, there is an inverse relationship between the sufficiency and appropriateness 
of audit evidence.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
In most instances, the auditor relies on evidence that is persuasive rather than convinc­
ing in forming an opinion on a set of financial statements. This occurs for two reasons. First, 
because an audit must be completed in a reasonable amount of time and at a reasonable cost, 
the auditor examines only a sample of the transactions that compose the account balance. 
Thus, the auditor reaches a conclusion about the account based on a subset of the available 
evidence.
Second, due to the nature of evidence, auditors must often rely on evidence that is not 
perfectly reliable. As discussed in the next section, the types of audit evidence have differ­
ent degrees of reliability, and even highly reliable evidence has weaknesses. For example, an 
auditor can physically examine inventory, but such evidence will not ensure that obsolescence 
is not a problem. Therefore, the nature of the evidence obtained by the auditor seldom pro­
vides absolute assurance about an assertion.
Evidence is considered appropriate when it provides information that is both relevant and 
reliable.
Relevance  The relevance of audit evidence refers to its relationship to the assertion being 
tested. If the auditor relies on evidence that is unrelated to the assertion, he or she may reach 
an incorrect conclusion about the assertion. For example, suppose the auditor wants to check 
the completeness assertion for recording sales transactions; that is, all goods shipped to cus­
tomers are recorded in the sales journal. A normal audit procedure for testing this assertion is 
to trace a sample of shipping documents (such as bills of lading) to the related sales invoices 
and entries in the sales journal. If the auditor samples the population of sales invoices issued 
during the period, the evidence would not relate to the completeness assertion (that is, the 
auditor would not detect shipments made that are not billed or recorded). Any conclusion 
based on the population of sales invoices would not be based on evidence relevant to testing 
the completeness assertion.
Reliability  The reliability of evidence refers to whether a particular type of evidence can 
be relied upon to signal the true state of an assertion. The reliability of evidence is influenced 
by its source and by its nature and is dependent on the individual circumstances under which 
it is obtained.
	
∙	 Independent source outside the entity. Evidence obtained by the auditor from an 
independent source outside the entity is usually viewed as more reliable than evidence 
obtained solely from within the entity. Thus, an external confirmation of the entity’s 
bank balance received directly by the auditor would be viewed as more reliable than 
examination of the cash balance as recorded in the general ledger. Additionally, 
evidence that is obtained from the entity, but that has been subjected to verification 
by an independent source, is viewed as more reliable than evidence obtained solely 
from within the entity. For example, a check written by the entity that has cleared the 
bank and been returned (referred to as a “cancelled check”) would be more reliable 
than a duplicate copy of the check because the cancelled check would be endorsed by 
the payee and cleared through an independent source (the bank).
	
∙	 Effectiveness of internal control. A major objective of an entity’s system of internal 
control is to generate reliable information to assist management decision making. 
As part of the audit, the effectiveness of internal control is assessed. When the 
auditor assesses internal control as effective (that is, low control risk), evidence 
generated by that accounting system is viewed as reliable. Conversely, if internal 
control is assessed as ineffective (that is, high control risk), the evidence from the 
accounting system would not be considered reliable. Thus, the more effective the 
entity’s internal control, the more assurance it provides about the reliability of audit 
evidence.
	
∙	 Auditor’s direct personal knowledge. Evidence obtained directly by the auditor 
is generally considered to be more reliable. For example, an auditor’s physical 
inspection of the entity’s inventory is considered to be relatively reliable because the 

	
Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
137
auditor has direct personal knowledge regarding the inventory. There are, of course, 
exceptions to this general rule. For example, if an auditor examined an inventory 
composed of diamonds or specialty computer chips, the auditor may lack the 
expertise to appropriately assess the validity and valuation of such inventory items. 
In such cases, the auditor may need the skill and knowledge of a specialist to assist 
with the inventory audit.
	
∙	 Documentary evidence. Audit evidence is more reliable when it exists in 
documentary form, whether paper, electronic, or other medium. Thus, a written 
record of a board of directors meeting is more reliable than a subsequent oral 
representation of the matters discussed.
	
∙	 Original documents. Audit evidence provided by original documents is more 
reliable than audit evidence provided by photocopies or facsimiles. An auditor’s 
examination of an original, signed copy of a lease agreement is more reliable than a 
photocopy.
Practice 
INSIGHT
If audit evidence obtained from one source is inconsistent with that obtained from another, or if 
the auditor has doubts about the reliability of information to be used as audit evidence, the auditor 
should perform the audit procedures necessary to resolve the matter and should determine the 
possible effect on other aspects of the audit (AS15, ¶29). For example, if responses to inquiries of 
management, internal audit, and others are inconsistent, the auditor must take steps to resolve such 
inconsistencies.
Determining the sufficiency and appropriateness of evidence are two of the more critical 
decisions the auditor faces on an engagement.
Stop and Think: Which of the following sources of evidence are more reliable?
	
∙	 Inquiry of an accounts receivable clerk regarding the accounts receivable balance or 
accounts receivable confirmations sent to a sample of customers.
	
∙	 Physical examination of lumber inventory performed by the external auditor or 
physical examination of inventory performed by internal auditors.
The Evaluation of Audit Evidence
The ability to evaluate evidence appropriately is another important skill an auditor must 
develop. Proper evaluation of evidence requires that the auditor understand the types of evi­
dence that are available and their relative reliability or diagnosticity. The auditor must be 
capable of assessing when a sufficient amount of appropriate evidence has been obtained in 
order to determine the fairness of management’s assertions.
In evaluating evidence, an auditor should be thorough in searching for evidence and 
unbiased in its evaluation. For example, suppose an auditor decides to mail accounts 
receivable confirmations to 50 of the largest customers of an entity that has a total of 
5,000 customer accounts receivable. Even if some of the 50 customers do not respond 
directly to the auditor, the auditor must gather sufficient evidence on each of the 50 
accounts, which could include searching for subsequent cash receipts, shipping docu­
ments, invoices, and so forth. In evaluating evidence, the auditor must remain objective 
and must not allow the evaluation of the evidence to be biased by other considerations. To 
illustrate, in evaluating a credit manager’s response to an audit inquiry, the auditor must 
not allow any personal factors (e.g., the credit manager is likeable and friendly) to influ­
ence the evaluation of the response.

138	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Audit Procedures for Obtaining Audit Evidence
Audit procedures are specific acts performed by the auditor to gather evidence about whether 
specific assertions are being met. As discussed in Chapter 3, there are three categories of 
audit procedures. Each serves the following purposes:
	
∙	 Risk assessment procedures. Used to obtain an understanding of the entity and 
its environment, including its internal control, to assess the risks of material 
misstatement at the financial statement and relevant assertion levels.
	
∙	 Tests of controls. Used to test the operating effectiveness of controls in preventing, or 
detecting and correcting, material misstatements at the relevant assertion level. Tests 
of controls are discussed in more detail in Chapter 6.
	
∙	 Substantive procedures. Used to detect material misstatements at the relevant 
assertion level. Substantive procedures include tests of details and substantive 
analytical procedures.
A set of audit procedures prepared to test assertions for a component of the financial state­
ments is usually referred to as an audit program. Table 5–3 illustrates an audit procedure for 
each assertion related to the audit of accounts receivable. The reader should note that there 
is not a one-to-one relationship between assertions and audit procedures. In some instances 
more than one audit procedure is required to test an assertion. Conversely, in some cases an 
audit procedure provides evidence for more than one assertion.
The following types of evidence may be gathered during the application of risk assess­
ment procedures, tests of controls, or substantive procedures, depending on the context in 
which the auditor applies them.
	
∙	 Inspection of records or documents.
	
∙	 Inspection of tangible assets.
	
∙	 Observation.
	
∙	 Inquiry.
	
∙	 Confirmation.
	
∙	 Recalculation.
	
∙	 Reperformance.
	
∙	 Analytical procedures.
	
∙	 Scanning.
Inspection of Records or Documents
Inspection consists of examining internal or external records or documents that are in paper 
form, electronic form, or other media. On most audit engagements, inspection of records or 
documents makes up the bulk of the evidence gathered by the auditor. Two issues are impor­
tant in discussing inspection of records or documents: the reliability of such evidence and its 
relationship to specific assertions.
Reliability of Records or Documents  A previous section noted the independence of 
the source of evidence as a factor that affects the reliability of audit evidence. In particu­
lar, evidence obtained from a source outside the entity is generally considered more reliable 
than evidence obtained solely from within the entity. Typically, a distinction is made between 
internal and external documents. Internal documents are generated and maintained within the 
entity; that is, these documents have not been seen by any party outside the entity’s organiza­
tion. Examples include duplicate copies of sales invoices and shipping documents. External 
documents are of two forms: documents originating within the entity but circulated to inde­
pendent sources outside the entity and documents generated outside the entity but included 
LO 5-4

	
Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
139
in the entity’s accounting records. Examples of the first include remittance advices returned 
with cash receipts from customers and payroll checks, while examples of the second include 
bank statements and vendors’ invoices.
In general, external documentary evidence is viewed as more reliable than internal evi­
dence because a third party either initiated or reviewed it. However, the difference in reliabil­
ity between internal and external documents depends on a number of factors, including the 
reliability of controls over preparation and storage of internal documents, and various factors 
affecting the reliability of external documents.
Relationship of Documentary Evidence to Assertions  The second issue concerning 
records or documents relates directly to the occurrence and completeness assertions and to the 
direction of testing taken when documentary evidence is examined. Figure 5–2 presents an 
overview of this relationship.
The direction of testing between the accounting records and source documents (such as 
sales invoices or shipping documents) is important when testing the occurrence and complete­
ness assertions. Vouching refers to selecting an item for testing from the accounting journals 
or ledgers and then examining the underlying source document. Thus, the direction of testing 
is from the journals or ledgers back to the source documents. This approach provides evidence 
that items included in the accounting records have occurred (or are valid transactions). For 
example, an auditor may want to examine a sample of sales transactions from the sales journal 
to ensure that sales are not fictitious. If adequate source documents exist for each sales trans­
action selected from the sales journal, the auditor can conclude that each sale was valid. Trac­
ing refers to first selecting a source document and then following it into the journal or ledger. 
The direction of testing in this case is from the source documents to the journals or ledgers. 
Testing in this direction ensures that transactions that occurred are recorded (completeness) 
in the accounting records. For example, if the auditor selects a sample of shipping documents 
and traces them to the related sales invoices and then to the sales journal, he or she would have 
evidence on the completeness of sales.
Stop and Think: Think about how the direction of testing relates to the completeness 
and occurrence assertions and why this is an important concept for auditors to under­
stand. Review the following two examples and determine (1) if you are vouching or 
tracing and (2) if the test relates to either the occurrence or completeness assertion:
	
∙	 Select a sample of purchase transactions included in the purchases journal and ensure 
that they are supported by receiving documents.
	
∙	 Select a sample of receiving documents for inventory received and ensure that the 
inventory is recorded in the perpetual inventory records.
Inspection of Tangible Assets
Inspection of tangible assets consists of physical examination of the assets. Inspection is a 
relatively reliable type of evidence that involves the auditor inspecting or counting a tangible 
asset. An audit engagement includes many situations in which the auditor physically examines

an entity’s assets. Some examples might be counting cash on hand, examining inventory or 
marketable securities, and examining tangible fixed assets. This type of evidence primarily 
provides assurance that the asset exists. In some instances, such as examining inventory, phys­
ical examination may provide evidence on valuation by identifying items that are obsolete or 
slow-moving. However, physical examination provides little or no assurance for the rights and 
obligations assertion.
Observation
Observation consists of looking at a process or procedure being performed by others. The 
actions being observed typically do not leave an audit trail that can be tested by examining 
records or documents. Examples include observation of the performance of control activi­
ties and the observation of the counting of inventories by the entity’s personnel. Observation 
provides audit evidence about the performance of a process or procedure but is limited to the 
point in time at which the observation takes place. It is also limited by the fact that the entity’s 
personnel may act differently when the auditor is not observing them. Observation is useful in 
helping auditors understand the entity’s processes but is generally not considered very reliable 
and thus generally requires additional corroboration by the auditor. Corroborating evidence 
includes data or documents from the accounting records and other documentary information 
(e.g., contracts and written confirmations).
Practice 
INSIGHT
Do not confuse the technical auditing definition of the term observation with the common usage of 
the word. Students often use the term observation to describe such audit procedures as inspection 
of tangible assets or documents and records. However, “observation” in the auditing sense con­
sists of looking at a process or procedure being performed by others. Technical terms, or jargon, 
serve an important role in efficient professional communication, and you will want to develop the 
proper vocabulary. Just as technical accounting terms such as revenue and income are not used 
interchangeably by professional accountants, professional auditors do not use observation and 
­inspection interchangeably.
Inquiry
Inquiry consists of seeking information of knowledgeable persons (both financial and nonfi­
nancial) within the entity or outside the entity. Inquiry is an important audit procedure that is 
used extensively throughout the audit and often is complementary to performing other audit 
procedures. For example, much of the audit work conducted to understand the entity and its 
environment including internal control involves inquiry.
Inquiries may range from formal written inquiries to informal oral inquiries. Evaluating 
responses to inquiries is an integral part of the inquiry process. Table 5–4 provides guidance 
for conducting and evaluating inquiries.
Responses to inquiries may provide the auditor with information not previously possessed 
or with corroborative audit evidence. Alternatively, responses might provide information that 
differs significantly from other information that the auditor has obtained, for example, infor­
mation regarding the possibility of management override of controls. The reliability of audit 
evidence obtained from responses to inquiries is also affected by the training, knowledge, and 
Techniques for Conducting and Evaluating Inquiries
In conducting inquiry, the auditor should:
 • Consider the knowledge, objectivity, experience, responsibility, and qualifications of the individual to be questioned.
 • Ask clear, concise, and relevant questions.
 • Use open or closed questions appropriately.
 • Listen actively and effectively.
 • Consider the reactions and responses and ask follow-up questions.
 • Evaluate the response.

Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
141
experience of the auditor performing the inquiry, because the auditor analyzes and assesses 
responses while performing the inquiry and refines subsequent inquiries according to the cir­
cumstances. In some cases, the nature of the response may be so significant that the auditor 
requests a written representation from the source.
Inquiry alone ordinarily does not provide sufficient audit evidence, and the auditor will 
gather additional corroborative evidence to support the response.
Confirmation
A confirmation represents audit evidence obtained by the auditor as a direct written response 
to the auditor from a third party (the confirming party) in paper form or by electronic or other 
medium. Confirmations also are used to obtain audit evidence about the absence of certain 
conditions, for example, the absence of a “side agreement” that may influence revenue rec­
ognition. Auditors usually use the term inquiry to refer to unwritten questions asked of the 
entity’s personnel or of a third party, and the term confirmation to refer to written requests for 
a written response from a third party.
The reliability of evidence obtained through external confirmations may be affected by 
factors such as
	
∙	 The form of the confirmation.
	
∙	 Prior experience with the entity.
	
∙	 The nature of the information being confirmed.
	
∙	 The intended respondent.
Confirmations are used extensively on audits; they generally provide reliable evidence 
for the existence assertion and, in testing certain financial statement components (such as 
accounts payable), can provide evidence about the completeness assertion. Evidence about 
other assertions can also be obtained through the use of confirmations. For example, an audi­
tor can send a confirmation to a consignee to verify that an entity’s inventory has been con­
signed. The returned confirmation provides evidence that the entity owns the inventory (rights 
and obligations assertion). Table 5–5 lists selected amounts and information confirmed by 
auditors. Accounts receivable, accounts payable, and bank confirmations are discussed in 
more detail in later chapters.
Recalculation
Recalculation consists of checking the mathematical accuracy of documents or records. 
Recalculation can be performed manually or through the use of information technology (e.g., 
by obtaining an electronic file from the entity and using computer-assisted audit techniques, 
or CAATs, to check the accuracy of the summarization of the file). Specific examples of this 
type of procedure include recalculation of depreciation expense on fixed assets and recalcula­
tion of accrued interest. Recalculation also includes footing, crossfooting, reconciling subsid­
iary ledgers to account balances, and testing postings from journals to ledgers. Because the 
auditor creates this type of evidence, it is normally viewed as highly reliable.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Reperformance
Reperformance involves the independent execution by the auditor of procedures or controls 
that were originally performed by company personnel. For example, the auditor may reper­
form the aging of accounts receivable. Again, because the auditor creates this type of evi­
dence, it is normally viewed as highly reliable.
Analytical Procedures
Analytical procedures are an important type of evidence. They consist of evaluations of finan­
cial information through analysis of plausible relationships among both financial and non­
financial data. For example, the current-year accounts receivable balance can be compared 
to the prior-years’ balances after adjusting for any increase or decrease in sales and other 
economic factors. Similarly, the auditor might compare the current-year gross margin per­
centage to the gross margin percentage for the previous five years. The auditor makes such 
comparisons either to identify accounts that may contain material misstatements and require 
more investigation or as a reasonableness test of the account balance. Analytical procedures 
are an effective and efficient form of evidence.
Analytical procedures can be used by an auditor to accomplish three purposes:
	
1.	 Risk assessment procedures to assist the auditor to better understand the business and 
to plan the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures (sometimes referred to as 
planning or preliminary analytical procedures).
	
2.	 Substantive analytical procedures are used as a substantive procedure to obtain 
evidential matter about particular assertions related to account balances or classes of 
transactions.
	
3.	 Final analytical procedures are used as an overall review of the financial information 
in the final review stage of the audit.
The reliability of analytical procedures is a function of (1) the availability and reliability 
of the data used in the calculations, (2) the plausibility and predictability of the relation­
ship being tested, and (3) the precision of the expectation and the rigor of the investigation. 
Because of the importance of this type of evidence in auditing, analytical procedures are cov­
ered in greater detail in Advanced Module 1.
Scanning
Scanning is the auditor’s exercise of professional judgment to review accounting data to iden­
tify significant or unusual items to test. This includes searching for large and unusual items 
in the accounting records (e.g., nonstandard journal entries), as well as reviewing transaction 
data (e.g., expense accounts, adjusting journal entries) for indications of errors that have 
occurred. It might be used in conjunction with analytical procedures but also as a stand-alone 
procedure. Scanning can be performed either manually or through the use of CAATs.
Reliability of the Types of Evidence
Table 5–6 presents a hierarchy of the reliability of the types of evidence. Refer to the earlier 
discussion about the relevance and reliability of evidence to help you understand the distinc­
tions being made here. Inspection of tangible assets, reperformance, and recalculation are 
generally considered of high reliability because the auditor has direct knowledge about them. 
Inspection of records and documents, confirmation, analytical procedures, and scanning are 
generally considered to be of medium reliability. The reliability of inspection of records and 
documents depends primarily on whether a document is internal or external, and the reliabil­
ity of confirmation is affected by the four factors listed previously. The reliability of analytical 
procedures may be affected by the availability and reliability of the data. Finally, observation 
and inquiry are generally low-reliability types of evidence because both require further cor­
roboration by the auditor.

T A B L E  5 – 6
The reader should understand, however, that the levels of reliability shown in Table 5–6 
are general guidelines. The reliability of the types of evidence may vary considerably across 
entities, and it may be subject to a number of exceptions. For example, in some circumstances, 
confirmations may be viewed as a highly reliable source of evidence. This may be true when 
a confirmation is sent to an independent third party who is highly qualified to respond to 
the auditor’s request for information. Inquiries of entity personnel or management provide 
another example.
The Audit Testing Hierarchy
Now that we’ve introduced you to the types of audit procedures and the types of evidence 
that these procedures are used to gather, you are ready to be introduced to the thought process 
auditors use in choosing audit tests and the order in which they are to be performed. The over­
all decision approach used to gather evidence is depicted in Figure 5–3 and is referred to in 
later chapters as the audit testing hierarchy.
After the auditor has gathered sufficient evidence about the entity and its environment 
using risk assessment procedures, the audit testing hierarchy starts with tests of controls 
and substantive analytical procedures. Starting with tests of controls and substantive ana­
lytical procedures is generally both more effective and more efficient than starting with tests 
of details.
	
∙	 Applying the audit testing hierarchy is more effective. The auditor’s understanding 
and testing of controls influence the scope (nature, timing, and extent) of substantive 
testing and enhance the auditor’s ability to hone in on areas where misstatements are 
more likely to be found. If controls are highly effective, less extensive substantive 
procedures (i.e., substantive analytical procedures and tests of details) will need to be 
performed. Similarly, substantive analytical procedures can direct attention to higher-
risk areas where the auditor can design and conduct focused tests of details.
	
∙	 Applying the audit testing hierarchy is more efficient. Generally, tests of controls and 
substantive analytical procedures are less costly to perform than are tests of details. 
This is usually because tests of controls and substantive analytical procedures provide 
assurance on multiple transactions. In other words, by testing controls and related 
processes, the auditor generally gains a degree of assurance over thousands or even 
millions of transactions. Furthermore, substantive analytical procedures often provide 
evidence related to more than one assertion and often more than one balance or 
class of transactions. On the other hand, tests of details often only obtain assurance 
related to one or two specific assertions pertaining to the specific transaction(s) or 
balance tested.
Auditing standards require that auditors perform substantive procedures for significant 
account balances and classes of transactions regardless of the assessed risk of material mis­
statement. In other words, assurance obtained solely from testing controls is not sufficient 
for significant balances and classes of transactions. For high-risk areas or highly material

accounts, the auditors will almost always perform some tests of details in addition to tests of 
controls and substantive analytical procedures.
The decision process depicted in Figure 5–3 recognizes that, for some assertions, tests 
of details may be the only form of substantive evidence used because in some cases it may be 
more efficient and effective to move directly to tests of details. Examples of situations where 
the auditor might move directly to tests of details include a low volume of large transactions 
(e.g., two large notes payable issued) and poor controls resulting in entity data that are unreli­
able for use in substantive analytical procedures.
An “Assurance Bucket” Analogy
We have found that an analogy often helps students understand and visualize how an audi­
tor decides on the proper mix of testing and evidence. Figure 5–4 illustrates what we call the 
“assurance bucket.” The assurance bucket must be filled with sufficient appropriate evidence 
to obtain the level of assurance necessary to support the auditor’s opinion. Following the 
top-down audit testing hierarchy means that the auditor first begins to fill the bucket with evi­
dence from the risk assessment procedures. In Figure 5–4, after completing risk assessment 
procedures, the auditor sees that the assurance bucket for a particular account and assertion is 
about 20 percent full. The auditor would next conduct control testing. In our example, control 
testing might add about another 30 percent to the bucket. How would the auditor know just 
how full the bucket is after testing controls? This is clearly a very subjective evaluation, and it 
is a matter of professional judgment.
The auditor next performs substantive analytical procedures and adds the assurance 
gained from these procedures to the bucket. In Figure 5–4 the bucket is now about 70 percent 
full. In this illustration, the auditor would need to top off the assurance bucket with evidence 
obtained through tests of details.
For lower-risk, well-controlled accounts, the assurance bucket may be entirely filled with 
tests of controls and substantive analytical procedures. For other accounts or assertions, the 
bucket may be filled primarily with tests of details.
The size of the assurance bucket can vary, depending on the auditor’s risk assessment 
and the assertion being tested. Obviously, certain assertions will be more important or present

bigger risks for some accounts than for others. For instance, existence (or validity) is typi­
cally more important for accounts receivable than it is for accounts payable. After the auditor 
has determined the risks associated with the assertions for an account balance, she or he can 
determine the size of the assurance buckets (i.e., how much assurance is needed) and then 
begin filling the buckets by applying the audit testing hierarchy. Figure 5–5 illustrates these 
concepts for accounts payable. Note that the largest bucket is for the completeness assertion, 
because with liability accounts the auditor is primarily concerned with potential understate­
ment errors; that is, unrecorded liabilities. The example in Figure 5–5 also illustrates that 
some assertions may be filled entirely with tests of details (e.g., rights and obligations) and 
that others may not require any tests of details (e.g., existence). Again, these are subjective 
matters that require considerable professional judgment.
Audit Documentation
Functions of Audit Documentation
Now that we have covered evidence and the audit hierarchy, we discuss important issues 
related to audit documentation. Audit documentation is the record of audit procedures per­
formed, relevant audit evidence obtained, and conclusions the auditor reached. Audit doc­
umentation is also referred to as working papers or the audit file. You can think of audit 
documentation as the “story” of the audit.
Audit documentation has three functions: (1) to provide principal support for the rep­
resentation in the auditor’s report that the audit was conducted in accordance with GAAS; 
(2) to aid in the planning, performance, and supervision of the audit; and (3) to provide the 
basis for the review of the quality of the work by providing a written documentation of the 
evidence supporting the auditor’s significant conclusions. The form and content of the audit 
documentation are a function of the circumstances of the specific engagement.
LO 5-7

	
Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
147
Support for the Audit Report  When the engagement is complete, the auditor must decide on 
the appropriate type of report to issue. The basis for this decision rests in the audit evidence gath­
ered and the conclusions reached and documented in the working papers. The working papers 
also document that the scope of the audit was adequate for the report issued. Information on the 
correspondence of the financial statements with GAAP is also included in the working papers.
Planning, Performance, and Supervision of the Audit  The working papers document 
the auditor’s compliance with auditing standards. In particular, working papers document the 
auditor’s compliance with the standards of fieldwork. The planning of the engagement, along 
with the execution of the audit plan, is contained in the working papers.
Working Paper Review  The working papers are also the focal point for reviewing the 
work of subordinates and for quality control reviewers.
Content of Audit Documentation
Audit documentation is the principal record of the audit. Because audit documentation pro­
vides the principal support for the representations in the auditor’s report, it should
	
∙	 Demonstrate how the audit complied with auditing and related professional practice 
standards.
	
∙	 Support the basis for the auditor’s conclusions concerning each material financial 
statement assertion.
	
∙	 Demonstrate that the underlying accounting records agreed or reconciled with the 
financial statements.
Audit documentation should include an audit program (or set of audit programs) for the 
engagement. The audit program should set forth in reasonable detail the auditing procedures 
that the auditor believed necessary to accomplish the objectives of the audit. Audit documen­
tation should be sufficient to show that standards of fieldwork have been followed.
Audit documentation should enable a reviewer with relevant knowledge and experience to
	
∙	 Understand the nature, timing, extent, and results of the procedures performed, 
evidence obtained, and conclusions reached.
	
∙	 Determine who performed the work and the date such work was completed, as well as 
the person who reviewed the work and the date of such review.
The form, content, and extent of audit documentation depend on factors such as the size 
and complexity of the entity, the identified risks of material misstatement, the nature of the 
audit procedures to be performed, and other factors.
For audits of public companies, the PCAOB adds additional documentation requirements 
for “significant findings or issues,” actions taken to address them, and the basis for the con­
clusions reached. Examples of significant findings or issues are shown in Table 5–7. The 
PCAOB also requires the auditor to identify all significant findings or issues in an engage­
ment completion memorandum. This memorandum should be specific enough for a reviewer 
to gain a thorough understanding of the significant findings or issues.
When documenting the quantity of evidence gathered through inspection of documents 
or confirmation of balances, the auditor should identify the items tested. Where appropri­
ate, the audit files should contain abstracts or copies of documents such as significant con­
tracts or agreements. Table 5–8 presents the documentation requirements for items tested by 
the auditor.
LO 5-8
Practice 
INSIGHT
Most firms use standard templates (e.g., for sampling applications) to record the results of their 
audit procedures, thus providing consistency in the manner in which evidence is recorded in the 
working papers.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Examples of Significant Findings or Issues That Require Documentation 
under PCAOB Auditing Standard No. 3
 • Significant matters involving the selection, application, and consistency of accounting principles, including related 
disclosures (e.g., accounting for complex or unusual transactions and accounting estimates).
 • Results of auditing procedures that indicate a need for significant modification of planned auditing procedures.
 • Audit adjustments and the ultimate resolution of these items.
 • Disagreements among members of the engagement team or with others consulted on the engagement about con­
clusions reached on significant accounting or auditing matters.
 • Significant changes in the assessed level of audit risk for particular audit areas and the auditor’s response to those 
changes.
T A B L E  5 – 7
Documentation Requirements for Items Tested
The identification of the items tested may be satisfied by indicating the source from which the items were selected 
and the specific selection criteria:
 • If an audit sample is selected from a population of documents, the documentation should include identifying char­
acteristics (e.g., the specific check numbers of the items included in the sample).
 • If all items over a specific dollar amount are selected from a population of documents, the documentation need 
describe only the scope and the identification of the population (e.g., all checks over $10,000 from the July cash 
disbursements journal).
 • If a systematic sample is selected from a population of documents, the documentation need only provide an iden­
tification of the source of the documents and an indication of the starting point and the sampling interval (e.g., a 
systematic sample of sales invoices was selected from the sales journal for the period from January 1 to October 1, 
starting with invoice number 375 and selecting every 50th invoice).

T A B L E  5 – 9
Most public accounting firms maintain audit documentation in two types of files: perma­
nent and current. Permanent files contain historical data about the entity that are of continuing 
relevance to the audit. Current files, on the other hand, include information and data related 
specifically to the current year’s engagement. Table 5–9 contains examples of the types of 
information included in each type of file.
Examples of Audit Documentation
Audit documentation comes in a variety of types. The more common audit documentation 
includes the audit plan and programs, working trial balance, account analysis and listings, 
audit memoranda, and adjusting and reclassification entries.
LO 5-8

	
Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
149
Audit Plan and Programs  The audit plan contains the strategy to be followed by the audi­
tor in conducting the audit. This document outlines the auditor’s understanding of the entity 
and the potential audit risks. It contains the basic framework for how the audit resources (bud­
geted audit hours) are to be allocated to various parts of the engagement. The audit programs 
contain the audit procedures that will be conducted by the auditor. Generally, each business 
process and account balance has a separate audit program.
Working Trial Balance  The working trial balance links the amounts in the financial state­
ments to the audit working papers. Exhibit 5–1 illustrates a partial working trial balance for 
EarthWear Clothiers. In addition to a column for account name, the trial balance contains 
columns for working paper references, the prior-year balances, the unadjusted current-year 
balances, and columns for adjusting and reclassification entries. The last column would agree 
to the amounts contained in the financial statements after combining common account bal­
ances. A lead schedule is then used to show the detailed general ledger accounts that make up 
a financial statement category (cash, accounts receivable, and so on). For example, the trial 
balance would contain only one line for “cash and cash equivalents” and the “C lead” sched­
ule would list all general ledger cash accounts. This approach is described in more detail later 
in the chapter.
Account Analysis and Listings  Account analysis working papers generally include the 
activity in a particular account for the period. For example, Exhibit 5–2 shows the analysis 
of legal and audit expense for EarthWear Clothiers for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
Listings represent a schedule of items remaining in the ending balance of an account and are 
often called trial balances. For example, the auditor may obtain a listing of all amounts owed 
to vendors that make up the accounts payable balance as of the end of the year. This listing 
would represent a trial balance of unpaid vendors’ invoices.
Audit Memoranda  Much of the auditor’s work is documented in written memoranda. 
These include discussions of items such as internal controls, inventory observation, errors 
identified, and problems encountered during the audit.
Adjusting and Reclassification Entries  The audit documentation should also include 
the adjusting and reclassification entries identified by the auditor or the entity. Adjusting 
entries are made to correct misstatements in the entity’s records. For example, if the auditor 
discovered that certain inventory items were improperly valued, an adjusting entry would be 
proposed to correct the dollar misstatement. Adjusting entries are posted in both the entity’s 
records and the working trial balance.
Reclassification entries are made to properly present information on the financial state­
ments. A reclassification entry affects income statement accounts or balance sheet accounts, 
but not both. For example, a reclassification entry might be necessary to present as a current 
liability the current portion of long-term debt.

Format of Audit Documentation
Audit documentation may be prepared in both hard copy and electronically. Whether the doc­
umentation is prepared manually or electronically, the manner in which it is formatted usually 
contains three general characteristics.
Heading  All audit documentation should have a proper heading. The heading should 
include the name of the entity, the title of the working paper, and the entity’s year-end date. 
Exhibit 5–2 shows a working paper with a proper heading.
Indexing and Cross-Referencing  The audit documents must be organized so that mem­
bers of the audit team or firm can find relevant audit evidence. Some firms use a lettering sys­
tem; other firms use some type of numbering system. For example, the general working papers 
may be labeled “A,” internal control systems working papers “B,” cash working papers “C,” and 
so on. When the auditor performs audit work on one working paper and supporting information 
is obtained from another working paper, the auditor cross-references (it can be “linked” in audit 
software) the information on each working paper. This process of indexing and cross-referencing 
provides a trail from the financial statements to the individual audit documents that a reviewer 
can easily follow. Indexing and cross-referencing are discussed further in the next section.
Tick Marks  Auditors use tick marks to document work performed. Tick marks are simply 
notations that are made by the auditor near, or next to, an item or amount on an audit docu­
ment. The tick mark symbol is typically explained or defined at the bottom of the audit docu­
ment, although many firms use a standard set of tick marks. Exhibit 5–2 shows some examples 
of tick marks. In this example of documentation, the tick mark “V” indicates that the auditor 
examined the bills sent to the entity by the payee for proper amount and description.
Many public accounting firms document their conclusions about individual accounts or 
components of the financial statements. Exhibit 5–2 shows an example of how an auditor 
might document a conclusion about an individual account.
LO 5-8

	
Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
151
Organization of Audit Documentation
The audit documentation needs to be organized so that any member of the audit team (and 
reviewers) can find the audit evidence that supports each financial statement account. While 
auditing standards do not dictate how this should be accomplished, the following discussion 
presents a general approach that is commonly used.
The financial statements contain the accounts and amounts covered by the auditor’s 
report. These accounts come from the working trial balance, which summarizes the general 
ledger accounts contained on each lead schedule. Each lead schedule includes the general 
ledger accounts that make up the financial statement account. Different types of audit docu­
mentation (account analysis, listings, confirmations, and so on) are then used to support each 
of the general ledger accounts. Each of these audit documents is indexed, and all important 
amounts are cross-referenced between audit documents.
Figure 5–6 presents an example of how audit documents could be organized to support 
the cash account. Note that the $15,000 shown on the balance sheet agrees to the working 
trial balance. The “A lead” schedule in turn contains the three general ledger accounts that 
are included in the $15,000 balance. Audit documents then support each of the general ledger 
accounts. For example, the audit documents indexed “A2” provide the audit evidence sup­
porting the general cash balance of $12,000. Also note that each important amount is cross-
referenced. For example, the balance per bank of $14,000 on “A2” is referenced to “A2.1” and 
the cash balance on “A2.1” is referenced back to “A2.”
LO 5-8
Practice 
INSIGHT
Whether hard copy or electronic, never leave an unanswered question in the working papers. Con­
sider the third general auditing standard, due professional care: could the auditor claim that due care 
was exercised if the auditor had a question but did not exercise sufficient due diligence to answer 
the question? Probably not, so it’s important to answer all questions and document all conclusions.
Ownership of Audit Documentation
Audit documentation is the property of the auditor. This includes not only audit documents 
prepared by the auditor but also documents prepared by the entity at the request of the auditor. 
The auditor should retain audit documents for a reasonable period of time in order to meet the 
needs of his or her practice and legal record retention requirements.
Although the auditor owns the audit documents, they cannot be shown, except under cer­
tain circumstances, to outside parties without the entity’s consent. Chapter 19 discusses the 
confidentiality of audit documentation.
Audit Document Archiving and Retention
Legal and auditing standards have long required auditors to retain their audit files for a number 
of years after an audit report is filed. However, the events leading up to the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act focused the spotlight on the practice of archiving and retaining audit documentation. 
Exhibit 5–3 describes Arthur Andersen’s federal indictment and conviction on obstruction of 
justice charges for deletions and alterations of audit documentation related to the Enron audit. 
The indictment and conviction ultimately led to the failure of Arthur Andersen. In the wake 
of the Enron-Andersen scandal, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposed new guidelines for audit file 
archiving and retention.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the PCAOB standards require that audit documentation be 
retained for seven years from the date of completion of the engagement, as indicated by the 
date of the auditor’s report (or the date that fieldwork is substantially completed), unless a 
longer period of time is required by law (e.g., in cases involving pending or threatened law­
suit, investigation, or subpoena). All documents that “form the basis of the audit or review” 
are required to be retained. Prior to Sarbanes, public accounting firms would not typically 
include in their working papers documentation that was inconsistent with the final conclu­
sion of the audit team regarding a matter, nor would they include all internal correspondence

leading up to a final decision. PCAOB standards also require that any document created, sent,

Some states (e.g., New York and California) have adopted similar archiving and retention 
policies for all audits, including audits of nonpublic companies.

Advanced Module 1: Analytical Procedures1
Auditing standards define analytical procedures as evaluations of financial information through 
analysis of plausible relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data. Analytical pro­
cedures can facilitate an effective audit by helping the auditor understand the entity’s busi­
ness, directing attention to high-risk areas, identifying audit issues that might not be otherwise 
apparent, providing audit evidence, and assisting in the evaluation of audit results. Analytical 
procedures are also commonly used to gather substantive evidence because they are effective at 
detecting misstatements.2 Analytical procedures are also relatively inexpensive tests to perform.
The objectives of the analytical procedures and the facts and circumstances will dictate 
the type of analytical procedure used to form an expectation and the techniques involved in 
investigating a significant difference. Analytical procedures may range from the use of simple 
trend analysis to the use of complex regression models. The discussion of analytical proce­
dures in this module is limited to the following three types of analytical procedures:
	
1.	 Trend analysis.
	
2.	 Ratio analysis.
	
3.	 Reasonableness analysis.
Table 5–10 provides definitions of the types of analytical procedures.

discussion of current research on analytical procedures and for PCAOB criticisms of firms’ application of the various 
steps in the analytical review process.

The Wholesale Destruction of Documents and the Indictment 
of Arthur Andersen
On March 14, 2002, a federal grand jury indicted Arthur Andersen, initiating the first criminal charge in the 
Enron bankruptcy. The one-count indictment, alleging obstruction of justice, read that for a one-month 
span in October and early November 2001, “Andersen . . . did knowingly, intentionally, and corruptly per­
suade” employees to “alter, destroy, mutilate, and conceal.” The indictment charged that Arthur ­Andersen 
employees “were instructed by Andersen partners and others to destroy immediately documentation 
relating to Enron and told to work overtime if necessary to accomplish the destruction.” The indictment 
also called the destruction an “unparalleled initiative to shred physical documentation and delete com­
puter files. Tons of paper relating to the Enron audit was promptly shredded as part of the orchestrated 
document destruction. The shredder at the Andersen office at the Enron building was used virtually con­
stantly and, to handle the overload, dozens of large trunks filled with Enron documents were sent to 
Andersen’s main Houston office to be shredded.”
In November 2001, the SEC served Andersen with the anticipated subpoena relating to its work for 
Enron. In response, members of the Andersen team on the Enron audit were alerted finally that there 
could be “no more shredding” because the firm had been “officially served” for documents. During the 
trial, the only major issue of dispute between the government and defense was whether anyone at Arthur 
Andersen acted with intent to impede the regulatory proceeding prior to being “officially served.” The 
fate of Arthur Andersen hung on this single issue. Arthur Andersen’s specialists on securities regulation 
maintained that the firm never considered the possibility of a federal inquiry in fall 2001 at a time others in 
the firm were destroying documents related to Enron.
In June 2002, the federal jury convicted Arthur Andersen of obstruction of justice after 10 days of 
deliberation. Ironically, in interviews, jurors said that they reached their decision because an Arthur 
­Andersen lawyer had ordered critical deletions to an internal memorandum, rather than because of the 
firm’s wholesale destruction of Enron-related documents (The New York Times, June 15, 2002).
On May 31, 2005, the Supreme Court overturned Arthur Andersen’s conviction. The court ruled unani­
mously that the Houston jury that found Arthur Andersen LLP guilty of obstruction of justice was given 
overly broad instructions by the federal judge who presided at the trial. However, this ruling came too late 
to save Arthur Andersen.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Definitions of the Types of Analytical Procedures Used 
to Form Expectations*
Trend analysis is the analysis of changes in an account over time. Simple trend analyses compare last year’s account balance (the “expectation”) with the 
current balance. Trend analysis can also encompass multiple time periods and includes comparing recorded trends with budget amounts and with com­
petitor and industry information. The number of time periods used is a function of predictability and desired precision.
Ratio analysis is the comparison, across time or to a benchmark, of relationships between financial statement accounts (e.g., return on equity) or between 
an account and nonfinancial data (e.g., cost per square foot or sales per item). Ratio analysis also includes “common-size” analysis, which is the conver­
sion of financial statement amounts to percentages. Industry or competitor ratios are often used to benchmark the entity’s performance. Ratio analysis 
is often more effective at identifying risks and potential misstatements than trend analysis because comparisons of relationships between accounts and 
operating data are more likely to identify unusual patterns than is an analysis only focused on an individual account.
Reasonableness analysis involves forming an expectation using a model. For example, ticket revenue can be modeled by taking average attendance by 
average ticket price. Similarly, depreciation expense can be modeled by taking book value divided by average useful life for a class of assets. Because it 
forms an explicit expectation, reasonableness analysis typically forms a more precise expectation than trend or ratio analysis.
*Regression analysis is another type of analytical procedure. Because it involves relatively complex statistical modeling in audit settings, we do not discuss it in this text.
T A B L E  5 – 1 0
Substantive Analytical Procedures
Figure 5–7 presents an overview of the auditor’s decision process when using substantive 
analytical procedures to collect audit evidence.
Develop an Expectation  The first step in the decision process is to develop an expecta­
tion for the amount or account balance. This is the most important step in performing ana­
lytical procedures. Auditing standards require the auditor to have an expectation whenever 
analytical procedures are used. An expectation can be developed for an analytical procedure 
from a variety of sources, such as
	
∙	 Financial and operating data
	
∙	 Budgets and forecasts.
	
∙	 Industry publications.
	
∙	 Competitor information.
	
∙	 Management’s analyses.
	
∙	 Analysts’ reports.
The quality of an expectation is referred to as the precision of the expectation. Preci­
sion is a measure of the potential effectiveness of an analytical procedure; it represents the 
degree of reliance that can be placed on the procedure. Precision is a measure of how closely 
the expectation approximates the “correct” but unknown amount. The degree of desired 
precision will differ with the specific purpose of the analytical procedure. The precision of 
the expectation is a function of the materiality and required detection risk for the assertion 
being tested. If the assertion being tested requires a low level of detection risk, the expecta­
tion needs to be very precise. However, the more precise the expectation, the more extensive 
and expensive the audit procedures used to develop the expectation, which results in a cost-
benefit trade-off.
Four factors (Disaggregation, The Plausibility and Predictability of the Relationship 
Being Studied, Data Reliability, and Type of Analytical Procedure Used to Form an Expecta­
tion) affect the precision of analytical procedures.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The PCAOB inspection teams have identified audit deficiencies, many of which had to do with ana­
lytical procedures. In one audit, the firm failed to develop expectations that were precise enough to 
identify material misstatements, whether individually or in the aggregate. In another audit, the firm 
developed its expectation using the same data from which the actual account balance was formed. 
The firm failed to test the data before using these data to create its expectation (PCAOB Release 
104-2009-064, 104-2008-069, and 104-2008-146).

Disaggregation
The more detailed the level at which an expectation is formed, the greater the precision. For 
example, expectations formed using monthly data will be more precise than expectations formed 
using annual data. Analytical procedures conducted to provide substantive evidence normally 
cannot be performed at aggregated levels (e.g., annual data, total revenues). Misstatements are 
difficult to detect when analyzing data at aggregate levels, due to offsetting trends or activities 
that can mask risks and misstatements. Examples later in the chapter illustrate this concept.
The Plausibility and Predictability of the Relationship Being Studied
The primary concern with plausibility is simply whether the relationship used to test the asser­
tion makes sense. For example, it is usually plausible to expect that an increase in sales should 
lead to an increase in accounts receivable. Many factors, including changes in the business or 
industry, influence the predictability of relationships among financial and nonfinancial data. 

156	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Income statement items tend to be more predictable than balance sheet items because income 
statement accounts involve transactions over a period of time, whereas balance sheet accounts 
represent amounts at a specific point in time. The more plausible and predictable the relation­
ship, the more precise the expectation.
Data Reliability
The ability to develop precise expectations is influenced by the reliability of the available 
data. The reliability of data for developing expectations depends on the independence of the 
source of the evidence, the effectiveness of internal controls, and the auditor’s direct personal 
knowledge. In addition, data for analytical procedures are more reliable when the data are 
subjected to audit in the current or prior periods and when the expectation is developed from 
multiple sources of data.
Type of Analytical Procedure Used to Form an Expectation
The three types of analytical procedures discussed earlier (trend, ratio, and reasonableness 
analysis) represent different ways to form an expectation. In general, trend analysis is the least 
precise method used and reasonableness analysis is the most precise. All three types are used 
for substantive analytical procedures, but reasonableness analysis is not commonly used for 
preliminary or final analytical procedures.
Examples of Expectations Formed by Analytical Procedures  Proper application of 
analytical procedures requires that the auditor have knowledge of the entity’s business and 
industry. Without such knowledge, the auditor may be unable to develop appropriate expecta­
tions or properly evaluate the results of the procedures. The auditor can use a number of differ­
ent analytical procedures to form expectations. Some common examples include the following:
Comparison of Current-Year Financial Information with Comparable Prior Period(s) after 
Consideration of Known Changes.  This is perhaps the most commonly used analytical pro­
cedure. The comparison of financial statement amounts can be done using absolute amounts 
(i.e., trend analysis) or by converting the financial statement amounts to “common-size” 
financial statements (ratio analysis). Exhibit 5–4 presents an example of a common-size 
income statement for EarthWear for 2015–2013. An auditor may compare the amounts shown 
for the three years and investigate those amounts that are out of line by some predetermined 
cutoff percentage or absolute amount.
Stop and Think: Examine the financial data presented in Exhibit 5–4. Using your 
developing skills as an auditor, consider one or two trends or ratios that would cause 
you as an auditor to pause and want to investigate further.
For example, the auditor can compare the current-year gross profit balance with the 
prior year’s balance. Referring to Exhibit 5–4, we see that gross profit has increased in abso­
lute amounts from $385.1 million to $404.1 million but decreased in percentage terms from 
44.89 to 42.51 percent. Because this type of analytical procedure is typically performed on 
the aggregated companywide financial statements, the expectation that the current-year gross 
profit percentage will be the same as the prior year is relatively imprecise. Thus, it is typi­
cally not considered particularly useful for providing substantive evidence about a particular 
account balance or class of transactions. To illustrate the effect of conducting analytical pro­
cedures at aggregated companywide levels, consider what effect this decline in gross profit 
percentage has on income from operations. Recall from Chapter 3 that planning materiality 
for EarthWear was set at $1,800,000 and tolerable misstatement was set at $900,000. Income 
from operations declined from $51.3 million to $40.1 million. The 2.38 percentage point 
(44.89 to 42.51) decrease in gross profit resulted in income from operations being approxi­
mately $22.62 million lower than expected (sales = $950.4 × .0238). However, this analysis 
does not provide appropriate evidence to explain the increase in cost of sales. The auditor

157
would have to perform additional procedures to corroborate the increase in cost of sales. This 
simple example highlights that it is difficult to obtain useful audit evidence from high-level 
companywide analytical procedures because the expectations are typically not sufficiently 
precise. In other words, whether or not the auditor observes a significant difference using a 
year-to-year comparison may be useful for planning purposes, but it would provide little or no 
audit evidence because of the imprecision of the expectation.
Comparison of Current-Year Financial Information with Budgets, Projections, and 
­Forecasts.  This technique is usually performed using trend analysis and is similar to the 
previous example except that the current-year budget, projection, or forecast represents the 
expectation (rather than the expectation being provided by prior-year data). For example, the 
auditor can test the fairness of advertising expense by comparing the current-year amount to 
the entity’s budget and investigating differences.
Relationships among Elements of Financial Information within the Current Period.  There 
are many examples of one element in the financial statements directly relating to another ele­
ment. This is particularly true for the association between certain balance sheet accounts and 
their related income or expense accounts. In these situations, reasonableness analysis is typi­
cally used to model the association.
Stop and Think: Taking this information into account, consider some of the relation­
ships between income statement and balance sheet accounts you would expect to see 
in a growing company. Ask yourself what the relationship would normally be between 
sales and accounts receivable. What about the relationship between the balance for 
long-term debt and interest expense?
Later in the module we present a comprehensive example of an interest expense reason­
ableness test for EarthWear Clothiers.
Comparison of the Entity’s Financial Information with Industry Data.  The auditor can

to industry averages. The industry information can serve as a benchmark for assessing 
how well the entity’s financial position and performance compare with other companies 
in the industry. Advanced Module 2 in this chapter illustrates several ratios used in ratio 
analysis.
Relationships of Financial Information to Nonfinancial Information.  The auditor may 
have relevant nonfinancial information available for comparison purposes or for develop­
ing estimates of the entity’s financial information. This might include such items as cost per 
employee, sales per square foot, utility expense per hour, and so on. For example, in a telecom 
company, the auditor can multiply the number of cell phone subscribers by the average billing 
rate to test an entity’s total revenue. Other examples include computing the average number 
of days a product is in inventory or developing an expectation for commission expense by 
multiplying commissioned sales by the average commission rate and comparing this estimate 
to the entity’s recorded commission expense.

INSIGHT
Using nonfinancial information in analytical procedures can be an effective way to identify potential 
frauds because, while perpetrators of fraud can manage financial numbers, it is difficult or impossible 
to manage nonfinancial data (e.g., square feet, days in the calendar year, number of employees). 
For example, auditors could compare an entity’s actual square footage of warehouse space with 
the amount of square footage that would be required to store the inventory as listed on the books.
Plotting Trends over Multiple Periods.  It can be very beneficial to plot or graph trends 
over several periods. Figure 5–8 provides a monthly plot of ending inventory for a three-year 
period. Suppose the auditor is auditing year-ending inventory for year 3 and that years 1 
and 2 have been previously audited. The pattern of previously audited financial information 
suggests some inventory “spikes” every six months. These spikes may be due to inventory 
buildup around busy seasons (e.g., holidays). The star at the end of year 3 indicates the audi­
tor’s expectation based on the past trends. The auditor would investigate the cause of the large 
increase in ending inventory at the end of year 3. Note that the potentially problematic spikes 
would not have shown up at all if the auditor had just plotted year-end inventory balances 
rather than monthly balances!

The foregoing discussion and examples have all related to the first step in the analytical 
procedures decision process (see Figure 5–7). The first step is the most important step in per­
forming effective substantive analytical procedures.
Define a Tolerable Difference  The second step in the analytical procedures decision 
process (see Figure 5–7) is to define a tolerable difference. The size of the tolerable dif­
ference depends on the significance of the account, the desired degree of reliance on the 
substantive analytical procedure, the level of disaggregation in the amount being tested, and 
the precision of the expectation. The amount of difference that can be tolerated will gener­
ally always be lower than tolerable misstatement, and when testing an entire account with a 
substantive analytical procedure, tolerable difference will usually be equal to the account’s 
tolerable misstatement. Sometimes, to achieve the desired level of assurance with a substan­
tive analytical procedure, the auditor will use a tolerable difference that is less than tolerable 
misstatement for the account. In these instances, the auditor may use a rule of thumb such as 
“tolerable difference is 5 percent of the entity’s recorded amount, but not to exceed tolerable 
misstatement.”
Practice 
INSIGHT
The PCAOB inspection team identified audit deficiencies that had to do with the tolerable difference 
used in analytical procedures. In one audit, the firm used analytical procedures as the primary sub­
stantive test of the existence of revenue, but the tolerable difference set by the firm allowed some 
differences to go uninvestigated even though they exceeded materiality as set by the firm during the 
planning stage (PCAOB Release 104-2009-064).
Compare the Expectation to the Recorded Amount  The next step in the analytical 
procedures decision process (Figure 5–7) is to determine if the amount of difference between 
the auditor’s expectation and the recorded amount exceeds the auditor’s tolerable difference. 
If the observed difference is less than the tolerable difference, the auditor accepts the account. 
If not, the auditor must investigate the difference using other audit procedures.
Investigate Differences Greater Than the Tolerable Difference  The fourth step in 
the analytical procedures decision process (Figure 5–7) is the investigation of significant dif­
ferences. Differences identified by substantive analytical procedures indicate an increased 
likelihood of misstatements. The more precise the expectation, the greater the likelihood that 
the difference is actually a misstatement. Inquiry of the entity’s personnel is frequently an 
important aspect of the investigation of differences. Nevertheless, inquiry of the entity’s per­
sonnel should not be the sole support for an explanation without quantification and corrobora­
tion (discussed below). There are four possible causes of significant differences—accounting 
changes, economic conditions or events, error, and fraud. In most instances, the cause of 
an identified difference involves a legitimate accounting change or an economic condition 
or event. However, even when a significant difference is due to error or fraud, the entity’s 
personnel may provide a plausible, yet ultimately untrue, business explanation. Thus, the 
effectiveness of substantive analytical procedures in identifying material misstatements is 
enhanced when auditors develop potential explanations before obtaining the entity person­
nel’s explanation. By doing this, the auditor is better able to exercise appropriate professional 
skepticism and challenge the entity personnel’s explanation, if necessary.
The development of potential explanations need not be time-consuming. Auditors typi­
cally reexamine and understand the various relationships in the financial and nonfinancial 
data. Then, based on their previous experience with the entity, other audit work performed, 
and discussions with other members of the audit team, they develop potential explanations 
for the observed difference. The independent consideration of potential explanations is more 
important for more significant accounts and when a higher degree of assurance is desired 
from substantive analytical procedures.

160	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Explanations for significant differences observed for substantive analytical procedures 
must be followed up and resolved through quantification, corroboration, and evaluation.
Quantification.  Quantification involves determining whether the explanation or error can 
explain the observed difference. While it may not be possible to quantify the exact amount of a 
difference between an analytical procedure’s expectation and the entity’s recorded amount, the 
auditor should quantify the portion of the difference that can be explained. This may require 
the recalculation of the expectation after considering the additional information. For example, 
an entity employee may offer the explanation that the significant increase in inventory over the 
prior year is due to a 12 percent increase in raw materials prices. The auditor should compute 
the effects of the raw materials price increase and determine the extent to which the price 
increase explains (or does not explain) the increase in the overall inventory account.
Corroboration.  Auditors must corroborate explanations for unexpected differences by 
obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence linking the explanation to the difference 
and substantiating that the information supporting the explanation is reliable. This evidence 
should be of the same quality as the evidence obtained to support tests of details. Such evi­
dence could vary from simply comparing the explanation to the auditor’s knowledge from 
other areas, to employing other detailed tests to confirm or refute the explanation. Common 
corroborating procedures include examination of supporting evidence, inquiries of indepen­
dent persons, and evaluating evidence obtained from other auditing procedures.
Practice 
INSIGHT
During an inspection, a PCAOB inspection team identified audit deficiencies, one of which had to do 
with the lack of corroboration when investigating differences found through analytical procedures. 
In one audit, the firm failed to test almost half of the issuer’s total revenue beyond confirming certain 
accounts receivable and performing analytical procedures. In some cases, the firm failed to corrobo­
rate management’s explanations of significant differences observed by these analytical procedures 
(PCAOB Release 104-2008-069).
Evaluation.  The key mind-set behind effectively performing substantive analytical pro­
cedures is one of appropriate professional skepticism, and obtaining a sufficient amount of 
appropriate audit evidence. The auditor should evaluate the results of the substantive analyti­
cal procedures to conclude whether the desired level of assurance has been achieved. If the 
auditor obtains evidence that a misstatement exists and can be sufficiently quantified, the 
auditor makes note of his or her proposed adjustment to the entity’s financial statements.
If the auditor concludes that the substantive analytical procedure performed did not pro­
vide the desired level of assurance, tests of details should be performed to achieve the desired 
assurance.
The Investigation of Differences for Analytical Procedures Used as Risk Assess­
ment Procedures (Planning) and as Final Analytical Procedures  The way in which 
differences are investigated diverges in important ways for planning and final analytical pro­
cedures. At planning, the auditor is not required to obtain corroborative evidence because 
planning analytical procedures are not intended to provide substantive audit evidence regard­
ing specific assertions. Rather, the auditor normally determines whether the planned audit 
procedures need to be revised in light of the results of preliminary analytical procedures. For 
example, to address the increased risk posed by the spike in inventory, the auditor may decide 
to expand the number of items tested during the observation of the year-end physical inven­
tory count (see Figure 5–3).
When conducting final analytical procedures, the auditor investigates unexpected differ­
ences by first going to the working papers to determine if sufficient appropriate evidence has 
already been gathered to explain the difference (rather than going to the entity’s personnel for 
an explanation). If the auditor cannot find sufficient evidence within the working papers, then 
the auditor would formulate possible explanations, conduct additional testing, and seek an 
explanation from the entity’s personnel.

Comprehensive EarthWear Example  Suppose we want to use substantive analytical 
procedures to test the reasonableness of interest expense reported by EarthWear Clothiers 
(i.e., a “reasonableness test”). Consider the following example:
EarthWear’s 2015 income statement shows $983,000 of interest expense. To conduct a sub­
stantive analytical procedure on this account, the auditor could develop an expectation using 
reasonableness analysis by building a model in the following manner. Obtain the ending monthly 
balance for the short-term line of credit from the monthly bank loan statement and calculate the 
average monthly ending balance. Trace the monthly loan balances to the general ledger. Determine 
the average interest rate for the year for the short-term line of credit based on the bank’s published 
rate in the monthly bank loan statement. Multiply the average monthly balance previously calcu­
lated by the average interest rate, and compare the result to the recorded interest expense. Suppose 
that the auditor obtained the following information from EarthWear’s general ledger:

     11,000
$230,900
$  19,242
Further, assume that interest rates recorded on the loan statements have remained stable over the 
year, fluctuating between 5 and 5.5 percent. If the auditor uses 5.25 percent as the average interest 
rate, the expectation for interest expense is $1,010,000 ($19,242,000 × 0.0525).
As shown in Figure 5–7, once an expectation is developed, the next step is to determine the 
tolerable difference. Because interest expense is a predictable account, the information used 
to form the expectation is deemed reliable, and the substantive analytical procedure will be 
the primary substantive test. Assume the auditor has set tolerable difference at 5 percent of 
recorded interest expense, or $49,150 (.05 × $983,000). The next step is to compare the expec­
tation of $1,010,000 to the recorded value of $983,000. Because the difference between the 
auditor’s expectation and the recorded amount, $27,000, is less than the tolerable difference, 
the auditor would accept the interest expense account as fairly stated. However, if the differ­
ence between the recorded amount and the expectation is greater than the tolerable difference, 
the auditor will need to investigate the difference. In the example above, the auditor would 
likely examine loan activity within each month to determine if there was significant variation 
in the balance that was not accounted for by the month-end model used to form the expecta­
tion. If the difference could still not be explained, the auditor would inquire of management 
about the cause of the difference. If the entity’s personnel provide a plausible explanation (e.g., 
interest expense reported in the financial statements also includes interest paid for other short-
term loans that were only outstanding for a few days at a time), auditing standards require the 
auditor to obtain corroborating evidence. If the entity personnel’s explanation and the corrobo­
rating evidence are not adequate, or if no corroborative evidence is available, the auditor will 
need to conduct additional audit procedures. If the explanation and evidence are adequate for 
resolving the difference, the auditor can accept the amount as being fairly presented.
Substantive analytical procedures can be used to test all transactions and balance asser­
tions except rights and obligations. However, they may be more effective at identifying certain 
types of misstatements than testing individual transactions. For example, they may be more 

162	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
effective at detecting omissions (completeness assertion) than providing detailed documen­
tary evidence. The key points are that (1) some assertions are more amenable to examination 
through analytical procedures than others, and (2) the auditor must ensure that the analytical 
procedure performed is appropriate for the assertion being examined.
Documentation Requirements  When a substantive analytical procedure is used as the 
principal substantive procedure for a significant financial statement assertion, the auditor 
should document all of the following:
	
∙	 The expectation and how it was developed.
	
∙	 Results of the comparison of the expectation to the recorded amounts or ratios 
developed from recorded amounts.
	
∙	 Any additional auditing procedures performed in response to any significant 
differences identified.
Final Analytical Procedures
The objective of analytical procedures at the overall review stage of an audit is to assist the 
auditor in assessing the conclusions reached and evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation. This requires reviewing the trial balance, financial statements, and footnotes in 
order to (1) judge the adequacy of the evidence gathered to support any unusual or unexpected 
balances investigated during the audit and (2) determine if any other unusual balances or rela­
tionships have not been investigated.
In the first instance, appropriate evidence in the working papers should support any dif­
ferences from the auditor’s expectations. For example, the auditor can compare the audited 
balances from the current year with the audited balances from the prior year. If there is a 
material difference, the auditor’s working papers should explain the difference. In the second 
instance, this comparison of audited values may reveal some unusual items that have not been 
investigated and explained. Assuming that the difference between the auditor’s expectation 
and the recorded amount is material, the auditor will have to perform additional audit work 
before an audit report can be issued.
Advanced Module 2: Selected Financial Ratios 
Useful as Analytical Procedures
A number of financial ratios are used by auditors as analytical procedures. These ratios are 
broken down into four categories: short-term liquidity, activity, profitability, and cover­
age ratios. Although the ratios discussed apply to most entities, auditors may also use other 
­industry-specific ratios. As follows, each ratio is calculated for EarthWear Clothiers for the 
year ended December 31, 2015.
A few points are worth mentioning before the financial ratios are discussed. First, in 
many instances, the auditor may compare the entity’s ratios with industry averages. While 
the industry averages serve as useful benchmarks, certain limitations should be recognized. 
Because the industry ratios are averages, they may not capture operating or geographical fac­
tors that may be specific to the entity. The use of different accounting principles for valuing 
inventory or calculating depreciation may also result in differences from industry averages for 
certain ratios. Finally, the industry data may not be available in sufficient detail for a particu­
lar entity. For example, if the auditor is looking for industry information on a company that 
solely operates in the wireless industry, such industry ratio data might be combined with other 
companies within the telecommunications industry.
Second, audit research has shown that material misstatements may not significantly 
affect certain ratios.3 This is particularly true for activity ratios. Third, the auditor must be 
LO 5-10

Journal of Practice and Theory (Spring 1987), pp. 59–73, for a discussion of this limitation of analytical procedures.

	
Chapter 5    Evidence and Documentation	
163
careful not to evaluate a financial ratio in isolation. In certain cases, a ratio may be favor­
able because its components are unfavorable. If related ratios are not examined, the auditor 
may draw an incorrect conclusion. For example, suppose that an entity’s days outstanding 
in accounts receivable is getting larger and the inventory turnover ratio is getting 
smaller. The negative trend in these ratios may indicate that accounts receivable are 
getting older and that some inventory may be obsolete. However, both of these 
factors positively affect the current ratio. If the auditor calculates only the current ratio, he 
or she may reach  an incorrect conclusion about the entity’s ability to meet current 
obligations.
Short-Term Liquidity Ratios
Short-term liquidity ratios indicate the entity’s ability to meet its current obligations. Three 
ratios commonly used for this purpose are the current ratio, the quick ratio, and the operating 
cash flow ratio.
Current Ratio  The current ratio is calculated as follows:
​Current ratio  =  ​  Current assets 
 
_______________ 
 
Current liabilities  ​  =   ​ 209, 095 
________ 
116, 268  ​  =  1.80​
It includes all current assets and current liabilities and is usually considered acceptable if it 
is 2 to 1 or better. Generally, a high current ratio indicates an entity’s ability to pay current 
obligations. However, if current assets include old accounts receivable or obsolete inventory, 
this ratio can be distorted.
Quick Ratio  The quick ratio includes only assets that are most readily convertible to cash 
and is calculated as follows:
​Quick ratio  =  ​  Liquid assets 
 
_______________ 
 
Current liabilities  ​  =  ​ 48, 978  +  12, 875 
 
_______________ 
 
116, 268  
​  =  .53​
Thus, inventories and prepaid items are not included in the numerator of the quick ratio. The 
quick ratio may provide a better picture of the entity’s liquidity position if inventory contains 
obsolete or slow-moving items. A ratio greater than 1 generally indicates that the entity’s liq­
uid assets are sufficient to meet the cash requirements for paying current liabilities.
Operating Cash Flow Ratio  The operating cash flow ratio measures the entity’s abil­
ity to cover its current liabilities with cash generated from operations and is calculated as 
follows:
​Operating cash flow ratio  =  ​ Cash flow from operations 
 
 
______________________ 
 
Current liabilities   
​  =  ​ 39, 367 
_______ 
116, 268 ​  =  .34 ​
The operating cash flow ratio uses the cash flows as opposed to assets to measure short-
term liquidity. It provides a longer-term measure of the entity’s ability to meet its current 
liabilities. If cash flow from operations is small or negative, the entity will likely need 
alternative sources of cash, such as additional borrowings or sales of assets, to meet its 
obligations.
Activity Ratios
Activity ratios indicate how effectively the entity’s assets are managed. Only ratios related 
to accounts receivable and inventory are discussed here because for most wholesale, retail, 
or manufacturing companies these two accounts represent the assets that have high activity. 
Activity ratios may also be effective in helping the auditor determine if these accounts contain 
material misstatements.

164	
Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Receivables Turnover and Days Outstanding in Accounts Receivable  These two 
ratios provide information on the activity and age of accounts receivable. The receivables 
turnover ratio and days outstanding in accounts receivable are calculated as follows:
​Receivables turnover  =  ​ Credit  sales 
___________ 
Receivables ​   =   ​ 950, 484 
_______ 
12, 875 ​   =  73.8
Days outstanding in accounts receivable  =  ​ 
365 days 
 
__________________ 
 
Receivables turnover ​   =  4.94 days​
The receivables turnover ratio indicates how many times accounts receivable are turned over 
during a year. However, the days outstanding in accounts receivable may be easier to interpret 
because this ratio can be compared to the entity’s terms of trade. For example, if an entity’s 
terms of trade are 2/10, net/30, the auditor would expect that if management were doing a 
good job of managing receivables, the value for this ratio would be 30 days or less. If the 
auditor calculates the days outstanding to be 43 days, he or she might suspect that the account 
contains a material amount of bad debts. Comparing the days outstanding to industry data 
may be helpful in detecting a slowdown in payments by customers that is affecting the entire 
industry. EarthWear’s ratio is 4.94 days because most sales are paid by credit card.
Inventory Turnover and Days of Inventory on Hand  These activity ratios provide 
information on the inventory and are calculated as follows:
​Inventory turnover  =  ​ Cost of goods sold 
 
________________ 
 
Inventory 
​   =   ​ 546, 398 
_______ 
122, 337 ​   =  4.47
Days of inventory on hand  =   ​ 
365 days 
 
________________ 
 
Inventory turnover ​   =  81.7 days​
Inventory turnover indicates the frequency with which inventory is consumed in a year. The 
higher the ratio, the better the entity is at liquidating inventory. This ratio can be easily com­
pared to industry standards. Suppose that the auditor calculates the inventory turnover to be 
4.7 times a year. If the industry average is 8.2 times a year, the auditor might suspect that 
inventory contains obsolete or slow-moving goods. The days of inventory on hand measures 
how much inventory the entity has available for sale to customers.
Profitability Ratios
Profitability ratios indicate the entity’s success or failure for a given period. A number of 
ratios measure the profitability of an entity, and each ratio should be interpreted by compari­
son to industry data.
Gross Profit Percentage  The gross margin percentage ratio is generally a good indicator 
of potential misstatements and is calculated as follows:
​Gross profit percentage  =  ​ Gross profit 
__________ 
Net sales  ​   =   ​ 404, 091 
________ 
950, 484  ​  =  42.5%​
If this ratio varies significantly from previous years or differs significantly from industry 
data, the entity’s financial data may contain errors. Numerous errors can affect this ratio. For 
example, if the entity has failed to record sales, the gross profit percentage will be less than in 
previous years. Similarly, any errors that affect the inventory account can distort this ratio. For 
example, if the entity has omitted goods from the ending inventory, this ratio will be smaller 
than in previous years.
Profit Margin  The profit margin ratio is calculated as follows:
​Profit margin  =  ​ Net in come 
__________ 
Net sales  ​   =   ​ 22, 257 
_______ 
950, 484 ​   =  2.4%​
While the gross profit percentage ratio measures profitability after cost of goods sold is 
deducted, the profit margin ratio measures the entity’s profitability after all expenses are

considered. Significant fluctuations in this ratio may indicate that misstatements exist in the 
selling, general, or administrative expense accounts.
Return on Assets  This ratio is calculated as follows:
​Return on assets  =   ​ Net income 
__________ 
Total assets ​   =   ​ 22, 527 
________ 
329, 959  ​  =  6.8%​
This ratio indicates the return earned on the resources invested by both the stockholders and 
the creditors.
Return on Equity  The return on equity ratio is calculated as follows:
​Return on equity  =   ​ 
Net income 
 
_________________ 
 
Stockholders’equity ​   =   ​ 22, 527 
_______ 
204, 222 ​   =  11.0%​
This ratio is similar to the return on assets ratio except that it shows only the return on the 
resources contributed by the stockholders.
Coverage Ratios
Coverage ratios provide information on the long-term solvency of the entity. These ratios give 
the auditor important information on the ability of the entity to continue as a going concern.
Debt to Equity  This ratio is calculated as follows:
​Debt to equity  =   ​ Short-term debt  +  Long-term debt 
 
 
_____________________________ 
 
 
Stockholders’ equity 
​   =   ​ (116, 668  +  0) 
 
_____________ 
204, 222  
​  =  .571​
This ratio indicates what portion of the entity’s capital comes from debt. The lower the ratio, 
the less debt pressure on the entity. If the entity’s debt to equity ratio is large relative to the 
industry’s, it may indicate that the entity is too highly leveraged and may not be able to meet 
its debt obligations on a long-term basis.
Times Interest Earned  This ratio is calculated as follows:
​Times interest earned = ​ Net income  +  Interest expense 
 
 
__________________________ 
 
Interest expense 
​
= ​ (22, 527  +  983) 
 
______________ 
983 
​   =  23.9​
The times interest earned ratio indicates the ability of current operations to pay the interest 
that is due on the entity’s debt obligations. The more times that interest is earned, the better 
the entity’s ability to service the interest on long-term debt.

Part 2    Audit Planning and Basic Auditing Concepts
Audit documentation (working papers). The auditor’s principal record of the work per­
formed and the basis for the conclusions in the auditor’s report. It also facilitates the planning, 
performance, and supervision of the engagement and provides the basis for the review of the 
quality of the work by providing the reviewer with written documentation of the evidence 
supporting the auditor’s significant conclusions.
Audit evidence. Information used by the auditor in arriving at the conclusions on which 
the auditor’s opinion is based. Audit evidence includes both information contained in the 
accounting records underlying the financial statements and other information.
Audit procedures. Specific acts performed by the auditor in gathering evidence to determine 
if specific assertions are being met.
Confirmation. A confirmation represents audit evidence obtained by the auditor as a direct 
written response to the auditor from a third party (the confirming party) in paper form or by 
electronic or other media.
Inquiry. Seeking information of knowledgeable persons, both financial and nonfinancial, 
within the entity or outside the entity.
Inspection of records and documents. Examination of internal or external records or docu­
ments that are in paper form, electronic form, or other media.
Inspection of tangible assets. Physical examination of the tangible assets.
Observation. Watching a process or procedure being performed by others.
Other information. Audit evidence that includes minutes of meetings; confirmations from 
third parties; industry analysts’ reports; comparable data about competitors (benchmarking); 
controls manuals; information obtained by the auditor from such audit procedures as inquiry, 
observation, and inspection; and other information developed by, or available to, the auditor 
that permits the auditor to reach conclusions through valid reasoning.
Recalculation. The auditor’s checking the mathematical accuracy of documents or records 
either manually or electronically.
Relevance of evidence. The relevance of audit evidence refers to its relationship to the asser­
tion or to the objective of the control being tested.
Reliability of evidence. The diagnosticity of evidence—that is, whether the type of evidence 
can be relied on to signal the true state of the assertion.
Reperformance. The auditor’s independent execution of procedures or controls that were 
originally performed as part of the entity’s internal control, either manually or through the use 
of computer-assisted audit techniques.
Scanning. The auditor’s exercise of professional judgment to review accounting data to iden­
tify significant or unusual items to test.

Required:
For each situation, indicate whether the first or second type of evidence is more reli­
able. Provide a rationale for your choice.
	
LO 5-4, 5-5	
5-35	 Inspection of records and documents relates to the auditor’s examination of entity 
accounting records and other information. One issue that affects the reliability of 
documentary evidence is whether the documents are internal or external. Following

direct communication from a third party in response to a request for information 
about a particular item affecting financial statement assertions.
Required:
	
a.	 List the factors that affect the reliability of confirmations.
	
b.	 One of the allegations in a recent fraud was that confirmations of account bal­
ances to various banks were determined to be forgeries. Auditing standards 
state that “an audit rarely involves the authentication of documentation, nor is 
the auditor trained as or expected to be an expert in such authentication.” What 
steps could the auditors have taken to ensure that bank confirmations were 
reliable?

audit documentation for a particular engagement?
	
LO 5-9	
5-38	 At December 31, 2015, EarthWear has $5,890,000 in a liability account labeled 
“Reserve for returns.” The footnotes to the financial statements contain the following 
policy: “At the time of sale, the company provides a reserve equal to the gross profit 
on projected merchandise returns, based on prior returns experience.” The entity has 
indicated that returns for sales that are six months old are negligible, and gross profit 
percentage for the year is 42.5 percent. The entity has also provided the following 
information on sales for the last six months of the year:

Required:
	
a.	 Using the information given, develop an expectation for the reserve for returns 
account. Because the rate of return varies based on the time that has passed since 
the date of sale, do not use an average historical return rate.
	
b.	 Determine a tolerable difference for your analytical procedure.
	
c.	 Compare your expectation to the book value and determine if it is greater than 
tolerable difference.
	
d.	 Independent of your answer in part (c), what procedures should the auditor per­

DISCUSSION CASES
	
LO 5-3, 5-4, 5-5	
5-40	 Part I. Lernout & Hauspie (L&H) was the world’s leading provider of speech and 
language technology products, solutions, and services to businesses and individuals 
worldwide. Both Microsoft and Intel invested millions in L&H. However, account­
ing scandals and fraud allegations sent the company’s stock crashing and forced the 
firm to seek bankruptcy protection in Belgium and the United States. The following 
selected information pertains to L&H’s sales and accounts receivable:
	
∙	 Consolidated revenue increased 184 percent from the 1997 fiscal year to the 1998 
fiscal year.
	
∙	 Revenue in South Korea, which has a reputation as a difficult market for foreign 
companies to enter, increased from $97,000 in the first quarter of 1999 to approx­
imately $59 million in the first quarter of 2000.
	
∙	 In the second quarter of 2000, sales grew by 104 percent but accounts receivable 
grew by 128 percent.
	
∙	 Average days outstanding increased from 138 days in 1998 to 160 days for the 
six-month period ended June 30, 2000.
Required:
	
a.	 Based on the above information, which assertion(s) for sales should the auditor be 
most concerned with? Why?
	
b.	 Based on the above information, which assertion(s) for accounts receivable 
should the auditor be most concerned with? Why?
	
c.	 What audit evidence should the auditor gather to verify the assertion(s) for sales 
and accounts receivable? Be specific as to how each type of evidence relates to 
the assertions you mentioned in parts (a) and (b) of this question.
	
	
	 Part II. L&H’s auditor did not confirm accounts receivable from customers in South 
Korea. However, The Wall Street Journal contacted 18 of L&H’s South Korean cus­
tomers and learned the following:
	
∙	 Three out of 18 customers listed by L&H stated that they were not L&H customers.
	
∙	 Three others indicated that their purchases from L&H were smaller than those 
reported by L&H.
Required:
	
a.	 If L&H’s auditor had confirmed these receivables and received such responses, 
what additional evidence could he or she have gathered to try to obtain an accu­
rate figure for sales to and accounts receivable from customers in South Korea?
	
b.	 If you were L&H’s auditor and you had received such responses from South 
Korean customers, how likely would you be to use inquiry of the entity’s person­
nel as an audit procedure? Why?

5-41	 The auditors for Weston University are conducting their audit for the fiscal year 
ended December 31, 2015. Specifically, the audit firm is now focusing on the audit 
of revenue from this season’s home football games. While planning the audit of sales 
of football tickets, one of their newer staff people observed that, in prior years, many 
hours were spent auditing revenue. This staff associate pointed out that perhaps the 
firm could apply analytical procedures to evaluate whether it appears that the rev­
enue account is properly stated.
	
	
	 	
The staff associate noted that information for a typical home game could be used 
to estimate revenues for the entire season. The home football season consisted of 
seven home games—one against a nationally ranked powerhouse, Bloomington

University, and six games against conference opponents. One of these conference 
games is Weston’s in-state archrival, Norwalk University. All of these games were 
day games except for the game against a conference opponent, Westport University.
	
	
	 	
The auditors will base their estimate on the game played against Kramer College, 
a conference opponent. This game is considered to be an average home game for 
Weston University. The following information concerning that game is available:

	 Based on information obtained in prior year audits, the following assumptions are 
made to assist in estimating revenue for all other games:
	
∙	 Attendance for the Bloomington University game was expected to be 30 per­
cent higher than total attendance for an average game, with the mix of seats pur­
chased expected to be the same as for a regular game; however, tickets are priced 
20 percent higher than for a normal game.
	
∙	 The game against Norwalk University was expected to draw 20 percent more fans 
than a normal game, with 75 percent of these extra fans buying box seats and the 
other 25 percent purchasing upper-deck seats.
	
∙	 To make up for extra costs associated with the night game, ticket prices were 
increased by 10 percent each; however, attendance was also expected to be 5 percent 
lower than for a normal game, with each type of seating suffering a 5 percent decline.
	
∙	 At every game, 500 box seats are given away free to players’ family and friends. 
This number is expected to be the same for all home games.

and reported ticket revenue large enough to prompt further consideration? Why 
or why not? If further consideration is warranted, provide possible explanations 
for the difference between estimated and actual football ticket revenue. What evi­
dence could you gather to verify each of your explanations?

Your preliminary review of the company’s financial statements indicates that the 
allowance for return of unsold books represents an important account (that is, high 
risk) because it may contain material misstatements. Consistent with industry prac­
tice, retailers are allowed to return unsold books for full credit. You know from your 
prior experience with other book publishers that the return rate for individual book 
titles can range from 30 to 50 percent. The entity develops its allowance for return 
of unsold books based on internally generated records; that is, it maintains detailed 
records of all book returns by title.
Required:
	
a.	 Discuss how you would assess the reliability of the entity’s records for developing 
the allowance for return of unsold books.
	
b.	 Discuss how you would determine the return rate for relatively new titles.

I
n Chapter 4, we noted that a major part of the auditor’s understanding of the 
entity and its environment involves knowledge about the entity’s internal con­
trol. In Chapter 5, we introduced you to the concepts of the assurance testing 
hierarchy and the “assurance bucket,” which indicate that the auditor typically 
obtains assurance from tests of controls before performing substantive pro­
cedures. This chapter provides detailed coverage of the auditor’s assessment 
of control risk. It addresses the importance of internal control and its compo­
nents, as well as how evaluating internal control relates to substantive testing. 
This chapter covers the COSO framework, basic concepts that apply to audit­
ing internal control, and how the auditor’s consideration of an entity’s internal 
control impacts the financial statement audit. The approach and techniques 
discussed in this chapter are equally applicable for an audit of internal control 
over financial reporting as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and 
discussed in Chapter 7. This chapter also discusses the timing of audit pro­
cedures, service organizations, and the required communications of internal 
control–related matters. Advanced Modules cover the types of controls in an 
IT environment and flowcharting techniques.

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Introduction
Internal control plays an important role in how management meets its stewardship or agency 
responsibilities. Management has the responsibility to design and maintain a system of 
internal control that provides reasonable assurance that assets and records are properly safe­
guarded, and that the entity’s information system generates information that is reliable for 
decision making. If the information system does not generate reliable information, manage­
ment may be unable to make informed decisions about issues such as product pricing, cost 
of production, and profit information, and external reports may not be useful to investors and 
other stakeholders.
An entity’s system of internal control is management’s responsibility but it is important to 
the auditor because the auditor needs assurance about how well the assets and records of the 
entity are safeguarded and about the reliability of the data generated by the information system. 
The auditor uses risk assessment procedures to obtain an understanding of the entity’s inter­
nal control. These procedures help the auditor to identify key controls, recognize the types of 
potential misstatements that are relatively likely to arise, and design tests of controls and sub­
stantive procedures. As we discussed previously, there is an inverse relationship between the 
reliability of internal control and the amount of substantive evidence required of the auditor. In 
other words, when filling the assurance bucket for an assertion (see Figure 5–4), if the auditor 
obtains more controls evidence, then less substantive evidence is needed to top off the bucket.
As we shall see in this chapter, the auditor’s understanding and assessment of internal 
control is a major factor in determining the overall audit strategy. After providing an overview 
of internal control and the COSO Internal Control—Integrated Framework, we discuss the 
auditor’s responsibilities for internal control under two major topics: (1) obtaining an under­
standing of internal control and (2) assessing control risk.
Definition of Internal Control
According to COSO’s Internal Control—Integrated Framework, a system of internal control 
is designed and carried out by an entity’s board of directors, management, and other per­
sonnel to provide reasonable assurance about the achievement of the entity’s objectives in 
the following categories: (1) reliability, timeliness, and transparency of internal and external, 
nonfinancial and financial reporting; (2) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including 
safeguarding of assets; and (3) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. According 
to COSO, the purpose of its Framework is to help management better control the organization 
and to provide boards of directors an added ability to oversee internal control. An effective 
system of internal control allows management to focus on operations and financial perfor­
mance goals while maintaining compliance with relevant laws and minimizing surprises.
Controls Relevant to the Audit
The controls that are of most direct relevance to a financial statement audit are those that con­
tribute to the reliability, timeliness, and transparency of external financial reporting. These 
controls are relevant to an audit because they help to prevent, or detect and correct, material 
misstatements in the entity’s financial statements. In addition, larger public companies are 
required to engage an external auditor to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of their 
systems of internal control over financial reporting. Controls relating to operations, compli­
ance, and other types of reporting may be relevant when they have an impact on data the audi­
tor uses to apply audit procedures. For example, the internal controls that relate to operating 
statistics may be important because such data may be utilized by the auditor for performing 
analytical procedures. However, many controls that relate to management’s planning or oper­
ating decisions may not be relevant to the auditor.

Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
181
The Effect of Information Technology on Internal Control
The extent of an entity’s use of information technology (IT) can affect internal control because 
IT affects the way transactions are initiated, authorized, recorded, processed, and reported.
Controls in most information systems consist of a combination of sometimes interdepen­
dent automated and manual controls. Manual controls often use information produced by IT, 
and they are often used to monitor the functioning of, and errors and exceptions identified by, 
automated controls. An entity’s mix of manual and automated controls varies with the nature 
and complexity of the entity’s use of IT. For example, “cloud computing” and storage of data 
in the “cloud” bring specific risks and the need for corresponding controls.
Table 6–1 lists some of the benefits and risks of using IT for an entity’s internal control. The 
risks to internal control vary depending on the nature and characteristics of the entity’s infor­
mation system. For example, where multiple users may access a common database, a lack of 
control at a single user entry point may compromise the security of the entire database. This may 
result in improper changes to or destruction of data. When IT personnel or users can gain access 
to privileges beyond those necessary to perform their assigned duties, a breakdown in segrega­
tion of duties can occur, resulting in unauthorized transactions or changes to programs or data.
The COSO Framework
Components of Internal Control
Internal control as defined by the COSO Framework consists of five components:
	
∙	 Control Environment.
	
∙	 Entity’s Risk Assessment.
	
∙	 Control Activities.
	
∙	 Information and Communication.
	
∙	 Monitoring Activities.
Table 6–2 defines each of the components, while Figure 6–1 shows how the categories of 
objectives of internal control, including safeguarding of assets, relate to the five components. 
A direct relationship exists between objectives (which reflect what an entity is striving to 
achieve), components (which represent what the entity needs to do in order to achieve the 
objectives), and the structure of the entity (the operating units, legal entities, and other). The 
relationship can be depicted in the form of a cube, as illustrated in Figure 6–1. As mentioned 
previously, the auditor is mainly concerned with how the five components, evaluated individu­
ally and in terms of how they operate together, affect the external financial reporting objective.

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Components of Internal Control
Control environment The control environment is the set of standards, processes, and structures that provide the basis for carrying out internal control 
across the organization. The board of directors and senior management establish the tone at the top regarding the importance of internal control and 
expected standards of conduct.
The entity’s risk assessment process Risk assessment involves a dynamic and iterative process for identifying and analyzing risks to achieving the 
entity’s objectives, thereby forming a basis for determining how risks should be managed. Management considers possible changes in the external 
environment and within its own business model that may impede its ability to achieve its objectives.
Information and communication Information is necessary for the entity to carry out internal control responsibilities in support of achievement of its objec­
tives. Communication occurs both internally and externally and provides the organization with the information needed to carry out day-to-day internal con­
trol activities. Communication enables personnel to understand internal control responsibilities and their importance to the achievement of objectives.
Control activities Control activities are the actions established by policies and procedures to help ensure that management directives to mitigate risks to 
the achievement of objectives are carried out. Control activities are performed at all levels of the entity and at various stages within business processes, 
and over the technology environment.
Monitoring of controls Ongoing evaluations, separate evaluations, or some combination of the two are used to ascertain whether each of the five com­
ponents of internal control, including controls to effect the principles within each component, are present and functioning. Findings are evaluated and 
deficiencies are communicated in a timely manner, with serious matters reported to senior management and to the board.

The Relationship of the Objectives of Internal Control to the Five 
­Components of Internal Control
F I G U R E  6 – 1
In the new COSO Framework (revised in 2013), each component includes principles that 
represent fundamental concepts underlying the effectiveness of each component. An entity 
can achieve effective internal control by applying all 17 principles. The principles are sum­
marized in Table 6–3, grouped by component.
The Framework sets forth the requirements for an effective system of internal control. An 
effective system provides reasonable assurance that the risk of not achieving an entity objec­
tive is reduced to an acceptable level. For a control system to be considered effective, each 
of the five components and relevant principles must be present and functioning, and the five 
components must operate together in an integrated manner.
Control Environment
The control environment sets the tone of an organization, influencing the control conscious­
ness of its people. The importance of control to an entity is reflected in the overall attitude, 
awareness, and actions of the board of directors, management, and owners regarding internal 
control. The control environment establishes the foundation for implementing the entity’s 
system of internal control.

The 17 Principles Underlying the Components of Internal Control
Control Environment
	 1.	The organization demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical values.
	2.	The board of directors demonstrates independence from management and exercises oversight of the develop­
ment and performance of internal control.
	3.	Management establishes, with board oversight, structures, reporting lines, and appropriate authorities and 
responsibilities in the pursuit of objectives.
	4.	The organization demonstrates a commitment to attract, develop, and retain competent individuals in alignment 
with objectives.

	6.	The organization specifies objectives with sufficient clarity to enable the identification and assessment of risks 
relating to objectives.
	 7.	The organization identifies risks to the achievement of its objectives across the entity and analyzes risks as a basis 
for determining how the risks should be managed.
	8.	The organization considers the potential for fraud in assessing risks to the achievement of objectives.
	9.	The organization identifies and assesses changes that could significantly impact the system of internal control.
Control Activities
	10.	The organization selects and develops control activities that contribute to the mitigation of risks to the achieve­
ment of objectives to acceptable levels.
	11.	 The organization selects and develops general control activities over technology to support the achievement of 
objectives.
	12.	The organization deploys control activities through policies that establish what is expected and procedures that 
put policies into action.
Information and Communication
	13.	The organization obtains or generates and uses relevant, quality information to support the functioning of other 
components of internal control.
	14.	The organization internally communicates information, including objectives and responsibilities for internal control, 
necessary to support the functioning of other components of internal control.
	15.	The organization communicates with external parties regarding matters affecting the functioning of other compo­
nents of internal control.
Monitoring Activities
	16.	The organization selects, develops, and performs ongoing and/or separate evaluations to ascertain whether the 
components of internal control are present and functioning.
	17.	The organization evaluates and communicates internal control deficiencies in a timely manner to those parties 
responsible for taking corrective action, including senior management and the board of directors, as appropriate.
T A B L E  6 – 3
Principle 1: The organization demonstrates a commitment to integrity and ethical 
values.  The effectiveness of an entity’s internal controls is heavily influenced by the integ­
rity and ethical values of management personnel, who are responsible to create, administer, 
and monitor the entity’s system of controls. Management’s philosophy and operating style can 
significantly affect the quality of internal control through the establishment of an appropriate 
“tone at the top.”
A well-controlled entity establishes and evaluates adherence to ethical and behavioral 
standards that are communicated to employees and reinforced by day-to-day practice. For 
example, management should remove incentives and opportunities that might lead personnel 
to engage in dishonest, illegal, or unethical acts. Examples of such incentives are pressures 
to meet unrealistic performance targets and performance-dependent rewards. Examples of 
opportunities include an ineffective board of directors, a weak internal audit function, and 
lack of control activities that might detect improper behavior. Management can best commu­
nicate integrity and ethical behavior within an entity by example and through the use of policy 
statements, codes of conduct, and training. Management must promptly address deviations 
from standards of conduct.
Characteristics that may signal important information to the auditor about management’s 
integrity and ethical values include management’s approach to taking and monitoring busi­
ness risks and management’s attitudes and actions toward financial reporting—for example, 
whether management tends to be conservative or aggressive when selecting from alternative 
accounting principles.

184	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Principle 2: The board of directors demonstrates independence from manage­
ment and exercises oversight of the development and performance of internal 
control.1  The board of directors and the audit committee significantly influence the control 
consciousness of the entity. The board of directors and the audit committee must take their 
fiduciary responsibilities seriously and actively oversee the entity’s accounting and reporting 
policies and procedures. Factors that can impact the effectiveness of the board or audit com­
mittee include the following:
	
∙	 Experience and stature of members and independence from management.
	
∙	 Extent of involvement with and scrutiny of the entity’s activities.
	
∙	 Information availability and willingness/ability to act on information.
	
∙	 Extent to which difficult questions are raised and pursued with management.
	
∙	 Nature and extent of interactions with internal and external auditors.
Principle 3: Management establishes, with board oversight, structures, report­
ing lines, and appropriate authorities and responsibilities in the pursuit of 
­objectives.  An entity’s organizational structure defines how authority and responsibility 
are delegated and monitored. It provides the framework within which the entity’s activities for 
achieving entity-wide objectives are planned, executed, controlled, and reviewed. The appro­
priateness of an entity’s organizational structure depends on its size and the nature of its 
activities, as well as such external influences as regulation.
This control environment principle includes assignment of authority and responsibility 
for operating activities and establishment of reporting relationships and authorization hierar­
chies, as well as setting of policies regarding acceptable business practices, knowledge and 
experience of key personnel, and resources provided for carrying out duties. It also includes 
policies and communications directed at ensuring that all personnel understand the entity’s 
objectives, know how their individual actions interrelate with and contribute to those objec­
tives, and recognize how and for what they will be held accountable.
An entity can use a number of controls to meet the requirements of this control environ­
ment principle. For example, the entity can have a well-specified organizational chart that 
indicates lines of authority and responsibility. Further, management and supervisory person­
nel should have job descriptions that include their control-related responsibilities.
Principle 4: The organization demonstrates a commitment to attract, develop, and 
retain competent individuals in alignment with objectives.  The quality of internal 
control is directly related to the quality of the personnel operating the system. The entity should 
have sound personnel policies for hiring, orienting, training, evaluating, counseling, promot­
ing, compensating, planning for succession, and taking remedial action. For example, an entity 
can demonstrate its commitment to hiring competent and trustworthy people by establishing 
standards that emphasize seeking the most qualified individuals, with emphasis on educational 
background, prior work experience, and evidence of integrity and ethical behavior. Compe­
tence relates to the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish the tasks that define an indi­
vidual’s job. Management should specify the competence level for a particular job and translate 
it into a job description that details the specific knowledge and skills required. Research has 
shown personnel-related issues to be a major cause of accounting error.2
1See PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2012 Current Developments for Directors (New York: PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
2012), for a discussion of audit committees and corporate governance. Also see information published by KPMG’s 
Audit Committee Institute (www.kpmginstitutes.com/aci).
2A. Eilifsen and W. F. Messier, Jr., “Auditor Detection of Misstatements: A Review and Integration of Empirical 
Research,” Journal of Accounting Literature 2000 (19), pp. 1–43, reviews research studies that have examined the 
causes of auditor-detected misstatements. For example, A. Wright and R. H. Ashton, “Identifying Audit Adjustments 
with Attention-Directing Procedures,” The Accounting Review (October 1989), pp. 710–28, find that approximately 
55 percent of the errors detected by auditors resulted from personnel problems, insufficient accounting knowledge, 
and judgment errors.

	
Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
185
Principle 5: The organization holds individuals accountable for their internal 
control responsibilities in the pursuit of objectives.  Management and the board of 
directors are responsible for establishing mechanisms to communicate and hold individuals 
accountable for performance of internal control responsibilities across the organization and 
for implementing corrective action as necessary. Management and the board of directors also 
establish performance measures, incentives, and rewards appropriate for responsibilities at all 
levels of the entity, reflecting reasonable expectations for performance and standards of con­
duct in light of both short-term and longer-term objectives. It is also important that incentives 
and rewards be aligned with the fulfillment of internal control responsibilities. Finally, man­
agement and the board of directors should evaluate performance of internal control responsi­
bilities, including adherence to standards of conduct and expected levels of competence, and 
provide rewards or exercise disciplinary action as appropriate.
The Entity’s Risk Assessment Process3
An entity’s risk assessment process identifies and responds to business risks in relation to 
achieving business objectives. Thus, a precondition to risk assessment is the establishment 
of objectives. The aspect of an entity’s risk assessment process that is most directly rele­
vant to auditors is how management identifies risks relevant to the preparation of financial 
statements, and then estimates their significance, assesses the likelihood of their occurrence, 
and decides on how to manage them. For example, the entity’s risk assessment process may 
address risks involved in significant estimates recorded in the financial statements.
The risk assessment process, as it relates to the external financial reporting objective, 
should consider external and internal events and circumstances that may arise and adversely 
affect the entity’s ability to initiate, authorize, record, process, and report financial data con­
sistent with management’s financial statement assertions. Once risks have been identified, 
management should consider their significance, the likelihood of their occurrence, and how 
they should be managed. In some instances, management may decide to accept the conse­
quences of a possible risk because the costs to remediate may exceed the benefit.
Principle 6: The organization specifies objectives with sufficient clarity to enable 
the identification and assessment of risks relating to objectives.  As discussed 
above, internal control objectives are organized into three categories in the COSO Framework: 
operations, compliance, and reporting. Objectives specific to external financial reporting 
include the preparation of financial statements for external purposes. In the area of external 
financial reporting, management must ensure that specified objectives include reporting that 
is consistent with generally accepted accounting principles that are appropriate in the circum­
stances. Management establishes external financial reporting objectives in light of material­
ity considerations. Finally, external financial reporting objectives include faithful reflection 
of underlying transactions and events, including important qualitative characteristics. Fun­
damental qualitative characteristics include (a) relevance—information that is capable of 
making a difference in user decisions—and (b) faithful representation—­information that is 
complete, neutral, and free from error. Other important qualitative characteristics include 
comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability.
Principle 7: The organization identifies risks to the achievement of its objectives 
across the entity and analyzes risks as a basis for determining how the risks 
should be managed.  An entity’s risk assessment process should consider the possibility 
of events that threaten the achievement of objectives. This process is supported by a variety 
of activities, techniques, and mechanisms. As part of its system of internal control, manage­
ment develops and implements controls relating to the conduct of risk identification activities. 
3In recent years, COSO has provided a significant amount of guidance in the area of enterprise risk management 
(ERM). For example, see COSO, Enterprise Risk Management—Integrated Framework (New York: AICPA, 2004) 
and COSO, Strengthening Enterprise Risk Management for Strategic Advantage (www.coso.org).

respond. An entity’s risk assessment considers factors that influence the severity, velocity, 
and persistence of the risk; likelihood of the loss of assets; and related impacts on opera­
tions, reporting, and compliance activities. The entity also needs to establish its tolerance for 
accepting risks and its ability to operate within those risk levels.
Principle 8: The organization considers the potential for fraud in assessing risks 
to the achievement of objectives.  The assessment of fraud risk considers the possibility 
of fraudulent reporting, loss of assets, and corruption resulting from various types of fraud 
and misconduct. The assessment of fraud risk includes consideration of incentives and pres­
sures; opportunities for unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposal of assets, altering of the 
entity’s reporting records, or other inappropriate acts; and how management and other person­
nel might rationalize or justify inappropriate actions.
Principle 9: The organization identifies and assesses changes that could signifi­
cantly impact the system of internal control.  The risk identification process includes 
consideration of possible changes in the internal or external environment because changes can 
introduce or change the risks to the entity’s objectives. Thus, the entity considers the impact 
of changes to the regulatory, economic, and physical environment in which the entity oper­
ates, as well as new or dramatically altered business lines, rapid growth, changing reliance 
on foreign geographies, and new technologies. The organization also considers changes in 
management and resulting changes in attitudes and philosophies with respect to the system of 
internal control.
Control Activities
Control activities are the policies and procedures that help ensure that management’s direc­
tives are carried out and implemented to address risks identified in the risk assessment 
process. Control activities include a range of activities, such as approvals, authorizations, 
verifications, reconciliations, reviews of operating performance, and segregation of duties. 
They occur throughout the organization, at all levels and in all functions.
Principle 10: The organization selects and develops control activities that con­
tribute to the mitigation of risks to the achievement of objectives to acceptable 
levels.  Control activities help ensure that risk responses that are intended to address and 
mitigate risks are carried out. Management considers how the environment, complexity, 
nature, and scope of its operations, as well as the specific characteristics of its organiza­
tion, affect the selection and development of control activities. Based on its risk assessment, 
management determines which relevant business processes require control activities. Control 
activities may include a mix of manual and automated controls, as well as a mix of preven­
tive and detective controls. Management considers control activities at various levels in the 
entity and segregates incompatible duties. Where such segregation is not practical, alternative 
control activities are implemented to compensate to the extent possible. Control activities are 
commonly categorized into the following four types:
	
∙	 Performance reviews (sometimes called “independent checks”).
	
∙	 Physical controls.
	
∙	 Segregation of duties.
	
∙	 Information processing controls, including authorization and document-based 
controls.
Performance Reviews  A strong accounting system should have controls that independently 
check the performance of the individuals or processes in the system. For example, senior 
management should review actual performance versus budgets, forecasts, prior periods, and 
competitors. Similarly, managers running functions or activities should periodically check the 

	
Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
187
quality of subordinates’ work and review performance reports for units and personnel under 
their supervision. A manager might periodically review or reperform a subordinate’s account 
reconciliation. Lastly, personnel with management or oversight responsibility should review 
and analyze relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data (e.g., key performance 
indicators), investigate any unusual items, and take corrective actions when necessary.
Physical Controls  These controls include
	
∙	 Physical security of assets, including adequate safeguards, such as secure facilities to 
protect against theft of assets or records.
	
∙	 Authorization requirements for access to computer programs and data files.
	
∙	 Periodic counting and comparison with amounts shown on control records (e.g., 
comparing the results of cash, security, and inventory counts with accounting records).
Stop and Think: Why are the physical controls listed above relevant from an auditor’s 
perspective, especially with respect to access to records and data?
If physical controls over access to records and data are weak or suspect, this has a direct 
impact on the auditor’s assessment of control risk. The implications of an increased control 
risk assessment on the financial statement audit are discussed later in this chapter.
Segregation of Duties  It is important for an entity to segregate the custody of assets, 
authorization of transactions, and recording of transactions. (Tip: To help you remember 
the important aspects of segregation of duties, use the acronym CAR—C for Custody, A 
for Authorization, and R for Recording). Performance of each of these functions by differ­
ent people reduces the opportunity for any one person to be in a position to perpetrate and 
conceal errors or fraud in the normal course of his or her duties, and at the same time benefit 
by obtaining an asset. For example, if an employee receives cash payments on account from 
customers and has access to the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger, it is possible for that 
employee to misappropriate the cash and cover the shortage in the accounting records.
Stop and Think: Why is it important that different individuals perform the duties of 
custody, authorization, and recording? What could happen, for example, if an individ­
ual were responsible for authorizing sales returns and for recording the receipt of the 
returned inventory?
Such a situation would clearly violate segregation of duties principles. An employee with 
both duties could, for example, issue a sales return memorandum to a friend or relative and 
then write off the receivable balance and record receipt of the inventory, even if the inventory 
were never returned.
Information Processing Controls  The two broad categories of information systems controls 
are general controls and application controls. Note that general IT controls are addressed in 
the second control principle of the control activities component, which reads as follows:
Principle 11: The organization selects and develops general control activities over 
technology to support the achievement of objectives.  General controls relate to the 
overall information processing environment and include controls over data center and network 
operations; system software acquisition, change, and maintenance; access security; and appli­
cation system acquisition, development, and maintenance. For example, an entity’s controls 
for developing new programs for existing accounting systems should include adequate docu­
mentation and testing before implementation. In addition, development of new systems and 
changes to existing ones are controlled, as is access to data, files, and programs.

188	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Application controls apply to the processing of individual applications and help ensure 
the occurrence (validity), completeness, and accuracy of transaction processing. Data entered 
are subject to online edit checks or matching to approved control files. For example, a cus­
tomer’s order is accepted only after reference to an approved customer file and credit limit. 
General and application controls are covered in more detail in Advanced Module 1 at the end 
of this chapter.
Control activities involve policies and procedures that help mitigate risks that endanger 
the achievement of objectives. This concept is articulated in the third principle underlying the 
Control Activities component of the COSO cube:
Principle 12: The organization deploys control activities through policies that 
establish what is expected and procedures that put policies into action.  A policy 
is a rule or guideline that calls for certain activities to take place in certain circumstances. For 
instance, a policy might call for a manager to review all purchases over $1,500. The procedure 
is the review itself, performed in a timely manner and with attention given to factors set forth 
in the policy, such as the nature and volume of purchases, and their relation to furthering the 
entity’s objectives.
Information and Communication
Information is necessary for the entity to carry out internal control responsibilities that support 
the achievement of its objectives. The acquisition, use, and sharing of relevant, high-quality 
information from both internal and external sources is necessary to support the functioning of 
internal control. Thus, the Information and Communication component of the COSO Frame­
work supports the functioning of the other four components of internal control.
Principle 13: The organization obtains or generates and uses relevant, quality 
information to support the functioning of internal control.  An information system 
consists of infrastructure (physical and hardware components), software, people, procedures 
(manual and automated), and data. The information system relevant to the financial reporting 
objective includes the accounting system and consists of the procedures (automated or manual) 
and records established to initiate, authorize, record, process, and report an entity’s transac­
tions and to maintain accountability for the related assets and liabilities. An effective account­
ing system gives appropriate consideration to establishing methods and records that will
	
∙	 Identify and record all valid transactions.
	
∙	 Describe on a timely basis the transactions in sufficient detail to permit proper 
classification for financial reporting.
	
∙	 Measure the value of transactions in a manner that permits recording their proper 
monetary value in the financial statements.
	
∙	 Determine the time period in which transactions occurred to permit recording of 
transactions in the proper accounting period.
	
∙	 Properly present the transactions and related disclosures in the financial statements.
Principle 14: The organization internally communicates information, including 
objectives and responsibilities for internal control, necessary to support the func­
tioning of internal control.  Internal communication enables personnel to receive clear 
messages from senior management about the importance of control responsibilities and how 
they are to be performed. Communication involves providing an understanding of individual 
roles and responsibilities pertaining to internal control over financial reporting. It includes the 
extent to which personnel understand how their activities in the financial reporting informa­
tion system relate to the work of others and the means of reporting exceptions to an appro­
priate higher level within the entity. Policy manuals, accounting and reporting manuals, and 
memoranda communicate policies and procedures to the entity’s personnel. Communications 
can also be made electronically, orally, or through the actions of management.

	
Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
189
Principle 15: The organization communicates with external parties regarding 
matters affecting the functioning of internal control.  External communication both 
enables inbound receipt of relevant information and provides internal control–related infor­
mation to external parties in response to outside requirements and expectations.
Monitoring of Controls
The monitoring component has received increased attention in recent years. In 2009, COSO 
issued a document titled Guidance on Monitoring Internal Control Systems. Monitoring of 
controls is intended to assess the quality of internal control performance over time. To provide 
reasonable assurance that an entity’s objectives will be achieved, management should monitor 
controls to determine whether they are operating effectively. Since risks change over time, 
management should monitor whether controls need to be redesigned when risks change.
Principle 16: The organization selects, develops, and performs ongoing and/or 
separate evaluations to ascertain whether the components of internal control are 
present and functioning.  Monitoring can be done through ongoing activities or separate 
evaluations. Ongoing monitoring procedures are built into the normal, recurring activities of 
the entity and include regular management and supervisory activities. Management can use 
internal auditors or personnel performing similar functions in other areas to monitor the oper­
ating effectiveness of internal control. For example, management might review whether bank 
reconciliations are being prepared on a timely basis and are reviewed by internal auditors.
Principle 17: The organization evaluates and communicates internal control defi­
ciencies in a timely manner to those parties responsible for taking ­corrective action, 
including senior management and the board of directors, as ­appropriate.  In 
many entities, the information system produces much of the information used in monitoring. 
If management assumes that data used for monitoring are accurate, errors may exist in the 
information, potentially leading management to incorrect conclusions. Further, monitoring 
is unlikely to be effective if identified control deficiencies are not communicated in a timely 
way to those with management or oversight responsibilities.
Planning an Audit Strategy
The audit risk model states that AR = RMM × DR where RMM = IR × CR. In this defini­
tion, the auditor’s assessment of RMM must consider the level of CR in applying the audit risk 
model. How the auditor determines the appropriate level of CR is described in the remainder 
of this chapter. Figure 6–2 presents a flowchart of the auditor’s decision process when con­
sidering internal control. As we discussed in Chapter 4, the auditor must assess the risk of 
material misstatement (refer to Figure 4–1). The information gathered by performing risk 
assessment procedures is used to evaluate the design of controls and to determine whether the 
controls have been implemented. This is the first step in Figure 6–2. The auditor then docu­
ments this understanding of the entity’s internal controls. With a recurring engagement, the 
auditor is likely to possess substantial knowledge about the entity’s internal controls and may 
be able to choose an audit strategy after only updating the understanding of the entity’s inter­
nal control. For a first-year audit, the auditor may delay making a judgment about an audit 
strategy until a more detailed understanding of internal control is obtained.
LO 6-6
Practice 
INSIGHT
A common challenge that increases control risk is the fact that many entities have a large variety of 
technological platforms, software, and hardware. Companies that have grown through merger and 
acquisition frequently band the legacy systems together rather than replace one or both systems. 
The resulting montage of servers, computers, off-the-shelf and custom-programmed software, and 
so on creates a complex and potentially risk-prone IT environment.

Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
191
The next step for the auditor is to decide whether or not to rely on the entity’s controls for 
assurance about management’s financial statement assertions. When the auditor’s risk assess­
ment procedures indicate that the controls are not properly designed or not implemented, the 
auditor will not rely on the controls. In this instance, the auditor will set control risk at high 
and use substantive procedures to reduce the risk of material misstatement to an acceptably 
low level (i.e., the assurance bucket is filled almost entirely with substantive evidence). When 
the auditor’s risk assessment procedures suggest that the controls are properly designed and 
implemented, the auditor will likely rely on the controls. If the auditor intends to rely on the 
controls, tests of controls are required to be performed to obtain audit evidence that the con­
trols are operating effectively. The auditor will make an assessment of control risk based on 
the results of the tests of controls.
To assist your comprehension of how the auditor uses the understanding and assessment 
of internal control to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures, we describe 
only two audit strategies: a substantive strategy and a reliance strategy. However, keep in mind 
that there is no single strategy for the entire audit; rather, the auditor establishes a strategy for 
individual business processes (such as revenue or purchasing) or by specific assertion (occur­
rence, completeness, and so on) within a business process. Furthermore, even when auditors 
follow a reliance strategy, the amount of assurance obtained by controls testing will vary 
from assertion to assertion. In other words, a reliance strategy just means the auditor intends 
to begin filling the assurance bucket with tests of controls evidence, but the percentage of 
the bucket filled with controls evidence will differ between assertions and across accounts in 
the various business processes. Finally, it is important to understand that auditing standards 
require some substantive evidence for all significant accounts and assertions. Thus, a reliance 
strategy reduces but does not eliminate the need to gather substantive evidence.
Practice 
INSIGHT
In some situations, the auditor may find it necessary to rely on evidence stored by the entity in elec­
tronic form. In such situations, a reliance strategy may be required due to the importance of controls 
in maintaining the integrity of the electronic evidence. For example, suppose an entity that provides 
electronic services to customers, such as an Internet service provider, uses IT to log services pro­
vided to users, initiate bills for the services, process the billing transactions, and automatically record 
such amounts in electronic accounting records. The auditor’s substantive tests will rely on the integ­
rity of the stored data, and tests of controls over data integrity may be the only way for the auditor to 
rely on subsequent substantive tests.
As we discuss in more detail in the next chapter, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 as 
implemented by AS5 requires public company auditors to test and report on the design and 
effectiveness of most public companies’ internal control over financial reporting. Thus, it 
is expected that every public company audit will follow a reliance strategy for significant 
account balances or assertions.
Substantive Strategy
A substantive audit strategy means that the auditor has decided not to rely on the entity’s 
controls and instead use substantive procedures as the main source of evidence about the 
assertions in the financial statements. However, as Figure 6–2 shows, a substantive strategy 
still requires the auditor to have a sufficient understanding of the entity’s internal controls 
to know whether they are properly designed and implemented. This knowledge includes an 
understanding of the five components of internal control (discussed previously).
The auditor may decide to follow a substantive strategy for some or all assertions because 
of one or all of the following factors:
	
∙	 The implemented controls do not pertain to the assertion the auditor is considering.
	
∙	 The implemented controls are assessed as ineffective.
	
∙	 Testing the operating effectiveness of the controls would be inefficient.

192	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
The auditor next documents the level of control risk as being set at high, and finally, 
substantive procedures are designed and performed based on the assessment of a high level of 
control risk. Therefore, when the auditor follows a substantive strategy, the assurance bucket 
(refer to Figure 5–4) is filled with some evidence from the risk assessment procedures and an 
extensive amount of evidence from substantive procedures (i.e., substantive analytical proce­
dures and tests of details).
Auditing standards point out that the auditor needs to be satisfied that performing only 
substantive procedures would be effective in restricting detection risk to an acceptable level. 
For example, the auditor may determine that performing only substantive procedures would 
be effective and more efficient than performing tests of controls for an entity that has a limited 
number of long-term debt transactions because corroborating substantive evidence can easily 
be obtained by examining the loan agreements and confirming relevant information.
Reliance Strategy
A reliance strategy means that the auditor intends to rely on the entity’s controls. If a reli­
ance strategy is followed, the auditor may need a more detailed understanding of inter­
nal control to develop a preliminary or “planned” assessment of control risk. The auditor 
will then plan and perform tests of controls. The auditor uses the test results to assess the 
“achieved” level of control risk. If the test results indicate that achieved control risk is 
higher than planned, the auditor will normally increase the planned substantive procedures 
and document the revised control risk assessment. If tests of controls support the planned 
level of control risk, no revisions of the planned substantive procedures are required. The 
level of control risk is documented, and substantive procedures are then performed. Keep in 
mind that there may be different degrees of control reliance for different business processes 
or assertions within a process.
From a practical standpoint, the level of control risk is normally set in terms of the assertions 
about classes of transactions and events for the period under audit. Table 6–4 presents the asser­
tions related to transactions and events that were discussed in Chapter 5 and control activities that 
are normally in place for each assertion to protect against material misstatements. For example, 
the use and tracking of prenumbered documents is a control procedure typically found in each 
business process to ensure occurrence and completeness. In a revenue process, accounting for 
prenumbered shipping documents provides reasonable assurance that all revenue is recorded 
(completeness). Similarly, reconciliation of the accounts receivable subledger to the general led­
ger accounts receivable account provides a control to help ensure that the occurrence assertion is 
met. Later chapters show relevant control activities in detail for each business process.

Obtain an Understanding of Internal Control
Overview
Auditing standards require the auditor to obtain an understanding of each of the five compo­
nents of internal control in order to plan the audit. This understanding includes knowledge 
about the design of relevant controls and whether they have been placed in operation by the 
entity. The auditor uses this knowledge to
	
∙	 Identify the types of potential misstatement.
	
∙	 Pinpoint the factors that affect the risk of material misstatement.
	
∙	 Design tests of controls and substantive procedures.
In deciding on the nature and extent of the understanding of internal control needed for the 
audit, the auditor should consider the complexity and sophistication of the entity’s operations 
and systems, including the extent to which the entity relies on manual controls or on auto­
mated controls. The auditor may determine that the engagement team needs an IT specialist. 
In determining whether an IT specialist is needed, the following factors should be considered:
	
∙	 The complexity of the entity’s IT systems and controls and the manner in which they 
are used in conducting the entity’s business.
	
∙	 The significance of changes made to existing systems, or the implementation of new 
systems.
	
∙	 The extent to which data are shared among systems.
	
∙	 The extent of the entity’s participation in electronic commerce.
	
∙	 The entity’s use of emerging technologies.
	
∙	 The significance of audit evidence that is available only in electronic form.
The IT specialist can be used to assist the engagement team in a number of ways. For exam­
ple, the IT specialist can inquire of the entity’s IT personnel about how data and transac­
tions are initiated, authorized, recorded, processed, and reported, and how IT controls are 
designed; inspect the system’s documentation; observe the operation of IT controls; and plan 
and perform tests of IT controls. The auditor should have sufficient IT-related knowledge to 
communicate the assertions to the IT specialist, to evaluate whether the specified procedures 
meet the auditor’s objectives, and to evaluate the results of the audit procedures completed by 
the IT specialist.
To properly understand an entity’s internal control, an auditor must understand the five 
components of internal control. The auditor may use the following audit procedures to obtain 
an understanding of an entity’s internal control:
	
∙	 Inquiry of appropriate management, supervisory, and staff personnel.
	
∙	 Inspection of entity documents and reports.
	
∙	 Observation of entity activities and operations.
Understanding the Control Environment
The auditor should gain sufficient knowledge about the control environment to understand 
management’s and the board of directors’ attitudes, awareness, and actions concerning the 
control environment. This includes knowledge of the factors contained in Table 6–3. 
Exhibit 6–1 presents a questionnaire that includes the type of information the auditor would 
document about EarthWear’s control environment (see the EarthWear online case at the end 
of this chapter for additional information).4
LO 6-7
4Exhibit 6–1 shows how the understanding of internal control can be developed and documented using a separate 
internal control questionnaire. Some or all of the information on the components of the entity’s internal control may 
be captured as part of the auditor’s understanding of the entity and its environment (see Chapter 3).

COMMUNICATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTEGRITY AND ETHICAL VALUES
The effectiveness of controls cannot rise above the integrity and ethical values of the people who create, adminis­
ter, and monitor them. Integrity and ethical values are essential elements of the control environment, affecting the 
design, administration, and monitoring of other components. Integrity and ethical behavior are the product of the 
entity’s ethical and behavioral standards, how they are communicated, and how they are reinforced in practice.
Yes, No, 
N/A
Comments
Have appropriate entity policies regarding 
matters such as acceptable business practices, 
conflicts of interest, and codes of conduct 
been established, and are they adequately 
communicated?
Yes
The permanent work papers contain a copy of 
EarthWear’s conflict-of-interest policy.
Does management demonstrate the appropriate 
“tone at the top,” including explicit moral guid­
ance about what is right or wrong?
Yes
EarthWear’s management maintains high moral 
and ethical standards and expects employees to 
act accordingly.
Are everyday dealings with customers, sup­
pliers, employees, and other parties based on 
honesty and fairness?
Yes
EarthWear’s management maintains a high 
degree of integrity in dealing with custom­
ers, suppliers, employees, and other parties; 
it requires employees and agents to act 
accordingly.
Does management document or investigate 
deviations from established controls? 
Yes
To our knowledge, management has not 
attempted to override controls. Employees 
are encouraged to report attempts to bypass 
controls to appropriate individuals within the 
organization.
COMMITMENT TO COMPETENCE
Competence is the knowledge and skills necessary to accomplish tasks that define the individual’s job. Commit­
ment to competence includes management’s consideration of the competence levels for particular jobs and how 
those levels translate into requisite skills and knowledge.
Does the company maintain formal or informal 
job descriptions or other means of defining 
tasks that comprise particular jobs?
Yes
EarthWear has formal written job descriptions 
for all supervisory personnel, and job duties 
for nonsupervisory personnel are clearly 
communicated.
Does management determine to an adequate 
extent the knowledge and skills needed to per­
form particular jobs?
Yes
The job descriptions specify the knowledge 
and skills needed. The Human Resources 
­Department uses this information in hiring, 
­training, and promotion decisions.
Does evidence exist that employees have 
the requisite knowledge and skills to perform 
their job?
Yes
Our prior experiences with EarthWear 
­personnel indicate that they have the 
­necessary knowledge and skills.
Understanding the Entity’s Risk Assessment Process
The auditor should obtain sufficient information about the entity’s risk assessment process 
to understand how management considers risks relevant to financial reporting objectives and 
decides on appropriate actions to address those risks. For example, suppose an entity operates 
in the oil industry, where there is always some risk of environmental damage. The auditor 
should obtain sufficient knowledge about how the entity manages its environmental risks, 
because environmental accidents can result in costly litigation against the entity, as illustrated 
by the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

	
Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
195
Understanding the Information System and Communications
The auditor should obtain sufficient knowledge of the information system to understand the 
following:
	
∙	 The classes of transactions in the entity’s operations that are significant to the 
financial statements.
	
∙	 The control procedures by which transactions are initiated, authorized, recorded, 
processed, and reported, from their occurrence to their inclusion in the financial 
statements.
	
∙	 The related accounting records, whether electronic or manual, supporting 
information, and specific accounts in the financial statements that are involved in 
initiating, recording, processing, and reporting transactions.
	
∙	 How the information system captures other events and conditions that are significant 
to the financial statements.
	
∙	 The financial reporting process used to prepare the entity’s financial statements, 
including significant accounting estimates and disclosures.
The auditor must learn about each business process that affects significant account balances 
in the financial statements. This includes understanding how transactions are initiated and 
authorized, how documents and records are generated, and how the documents and records 
flow to the general ledger and financial statements. Understanding the information system 
also requires knowing how IT is involved in data processing.
The auditor should understand the control procedures used by the entity to provide assur­
ance that financial statements and related disclosures are properly prepared and presented. 
Such procedures include
	
∙	 The procedures used to enter transaction totals into the general ledger.
	
∙	 The procedures used to initiate, authorize, record, and process journal entries in the 
general ledger.
	
∙	 Other procedures used to record recurring and nonrecurring adjustments to the 
financial statements.
Understanding Control Activities
As the auditor learns about the other components of internal control, he or she is also likely to 
obtain information about control activities. For example, in examining the information system 
that pertains to accounts receivable, the auditor is likely to see how the entity grants credit to 
customers. The extent of the auditor’s understanding of control activities is a function of the 
audit strategy adopted. When the auditor decides to follow a substantive strategy, little work 
is done on understanding specific control activities. When a reliance strategy is followed, the 
auditor has to understand the control activities that relate to assertions for which a lower level 
of control risk is expected. Auditors normally use walkthroughs to develop an understanding 
of control activities.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Auditors use walkthroughs extensively to review a business process or activity. The purpose of 
the walkthrough is to confirm if a documented process is in use and is accurately reflecting cur­
rent workflow. The walkthrough can also be used to test the accuracy of current or previously used 
control activities.
Understanding Monitoring of Controls
The auditor should obtain an understanding of the major types of activities that the entity uses 
to monitor internal control, including the sources of the information related to those activities, 
and how those activities are used to initiate corrective actions to its controls.

196	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Documenting the Understanding of Internal Control
Auditing standards require that the auditor document his or her understanding of the entity’s 
internal control components. A number of tools are available to the auditor for documenting 
the understanding of internal control. These include
	
∙	 The entity’s procedures manuals and organizational charts.
	
∙	 Internal control questionnaires.
	
∙	 Flowcharts.
	
∙	 Narrative description.
Procedures Manuals and Organizational Charts  Many organizations prepare proce­
dures manuals that document the entity’s policies and procedures. Portions of such manu­
als may include documentation of the accounting systems and related control activities. The 
entity’s organizational chart presents the designated lines of authority and responsibility. Cop­
ies of both of these documents can help the auditor document his or her understanding of the 
internal control system.
Internal Control Questionnaires  Internal control questionnaires are one of many types of 
questionnaires used by auditors. Questionnaires provide a systematic means for the auditor to 
investigate various areas such as internal control. An internal control questionnaire is generally 
used for entities with a relatively complex internal control structure. It contains questions about 
the important factors or characteristics of the five internal control components. Such question­
naires are often embedded as templates within a firm’s audit software. Exhibit 6–1 provides an 
example of the use of such questionnaires. The auditor’s responses to the questions included 
in the internal control questionnaire provide the documentation for his or her understanding.
Flowcharts  Flowcharts provide a diagrammatic representation, or “picture,” of the entity’s 
accounting system. The flowchart outlines the configuration of the system in terms of func­
tions, documents, processes, and reports. This documentation facilitates an auditor’s analysis 
of the system’s strengths and weaknesses. Figure 6–3 presents a simple example of a flow­
chart for the order entry portion of a revenue process. Flowcharts are also used to document 
the auditor’s understanding of an entity’s internal control over financial reporting. Subsequent 
chapters go into more depth on the processes, controls, and documentation of business pro­
cesses, such as the revenue process, the acquisition and payment process, and so on. Module 2 
to this chapter provides detailed coverage of flowcharting techniques. Flowcharts are used 
extensively in this book to represent accounting systems.
On many engagements, auditors use a combination of these tools to document their 
understanding of the components of internal control, depending on the complexity of the 
entity’s internal control system. For example, in a complex information system where a large 
volume of transactions occur electronically, the auditor may document the control environ­
ment, the entity’s risk assessment process, and monitoring activities using a memorandum 
and internal control questionnaire. Documentation of the information system and communi­
cation component, as well as control activities, may be accomplished through the use of an 
internal control questionnaire and a flowchart.
Narrative Description  The understanding of internal control may be documented in a 
memorandum. This documentation approach is most appropriate when the entity has a simple 
internal control system.
The Effect of Entity Size on Internal Control
The size of an entity may affect how the various components of internal control are imple­
mented. While large entities may be able to implement the components in the fashion just 
described, small to midsize entities sometimes use alternative approaches and still achieve 
effective internal control. For example, a large entity may have a written code of conduct,

while a small or midsize entity may not. However, a small entity may achieve a similar objec­
tive by developing a culture that emphasizes integrity and ethical behavior through oral com­
munication and the example of the owner-manager.
While the basic concepts of the five components should be present in all entities, they 
are likely to be less formal in a small or midsize entity than in a large entity. For example, in 
a small entity, the owner-manager’s involvement in day-to-day activities can provide a highly 
effective control that identifies and monitors risks that may affect the entity. A small entity 
can also have effective communication channels due to its size, the fact that there are fewer 
levels in the organizational hierarchy, and management’s greater visibility. The monitoring 
component can also be effective in a small to midsize entity as a result of management’s close 
involvement in operations. For example, the owner may review all daily cash disbursements 
to ensure that only authorized payments are made to vendors. By being involved in day-to-day 
operations, management may be better able to identify variances from expectations and inac­
curacies in financial data. See the Koss Corporation and Dixon Illinois discussion cases for 
issues related to smaller organizations.
The Limitations of an Entity’s Internal Control
An internal control system should be designed and operated to provide reasonable assurance 
that an entity’s objectives are being achieved. The concept of reasonable assurance recognizes 
that the cost of an entity’s internal control system should not exceed the benefits that are 
expected to be derived. Balancing the cost of controls with the related benefits requires con­
siderable estimation and judgment on the part of management. The effectiveness of any inter­
nal control system is subject to certain inherent limitations, including management override 
of internal control, personnel errors or mistakes, and collusion. For example, a recent survey 
by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (Figure 6–4) shows that a “lack of internal 
controls,” “lack of management review,” and “override of existing internal controls” are some 
of the primary sources of internal control weaknesses related to fraud.

Management Override of Internal Control  In some cases, an entity’s controls may be 
overridden by management. For example, a senior-level manager can require a lower-level 
employee to record entries in the accounting records that are not consistent with the substance 
of the transactions and that violate the entity’s controls. The lower-level employee may record 
the transaction, even though it violates the entity’s control policies, out of fear of losing his 
or her job. In another example, management may enter into concealed side agreements with 
customers that alter the terms and conditions of the entity’s standard sales contract in ways 
that should preclude revenue recognition.
The auditor is particularly concerned when senior management is involved in such activi­
ties because it raises serious questions about management’s integrity. Violations of control 
activities by senior management, however, are often particularly difficult to detect with nor­
mal audit procedures.
Human Errors or Mistakes  The internal control system is only as effective as the per­
sonnel who implement and perform the controls. Breakdowns in internal control can occur 
because of human failures such as simple errors or mistakes. For example, errors may occur in 
designing, maintaining, or monitoring automated controls. If IT personnel do not completely 
understand how a revenue system should process sales transactions, they may make software 
programming errors in modifying or updating the system.
Collusion  The effectiveness of segregation of duties lies in individuals’ performing only 
their assigned tasks or in the performance of one person being checked by another. There is 

	
Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
199
always a risk that collusion between individuals will destroy the effectiveness of segregation 
of duties. Collusion is cited many times as a source of fraud within companies. For exam­
ple, an individual who receives cash receipts from customers can collude with the one who 
records those receipts in the customers’ records to steal cash from the entity.
Assessing Control Risk
Assessing control risk is the process of evaluating the effectiveness of an entity’s internal 
control in preventing, or detecting and correcting, material misstatements in the financial 
statements. As discussed earlier, the auditor can set control risk at high (a substantive strat­
egy) or at a lower level (a reliance strategy). As shown in Figure 6–2, when the auditor sets 
control risk at high, he or she documents that control risk assessment and performs substan­
tive procedures. The discussion in this section focuses on the situation where the auditor 
plans to follow a reliance strategy. To set control risk below high (e.g., at moderate or low), 
the auditor must
	
∙	 Identify specific controls that will be relied upon.
	
∙	 Perform tests of the identified controls.
	
∙	 Conclude on the achieved level of control risk given results of testing.
Identifying Specific Controls That Will Be Relied Upon
The auditor’s understanding of internal control is used to identify the controls that are likely 
to prevent, or detect and correct, material misstatement in specific assertions. Some of the 
controls the auditor will rely on can have a pervasive effect on many assertions. For example, 
the conclusion that an entity’s control environment is highly effective may influence the audi­
tor’s decision about the number of an entity’s locations at which auditing procedures are to 
be performed. Alternatively, some controls only affect an individual assertion contained in a 
single financial statement account. For example, a credit check might be performed on a cus­
tomer’s order. Such a control is specifically related to the valuation assertion for the accounts 
receivable balance.
Performing Tests of Controls
Tests of controls are performed in order to provide evidence to support the lower level of 
control risk when using a relaince strategy. Tests of controls directed toward the effective­
ness of the design of a control are concerned with evaluating whether that control is suitably 
designed to prevent, or detect and correct, material misstatements. Tests of controls directed 
toward operating effectiveness are concerned with assessing how the control was applied, the 
consistency with which it was applied during the audit period, and by whom it was applied. 
Procedures that are used for tests of controls are listed below with examples of how the audi­
tor might apply each. These four categories represent the four types of tests of controls that 
auditors choose from in designing a program for testing controls—you would be wise to com­
mit them to memory.
Types of Tests of Controls
Examples
Inquiry of appropriate entity personnel.
Inquiry of credit manager about the policies for writing off 
uncollectible accounts.
Inspection of documents, reports, or electronic files 
­indicating the performance of the control.
Inspect bank reconciliations prepared by the internal 
auditors.
Observation of the application of the control.
Observe how controls are applied to the handling of cash to 
ensure that there is proper segregation of duties.
Reperformance of the application of the control by the 
auditor.
Reperform the authorization control used for granting 
credit.

LO 6-10

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
A combination of these procedures may be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of 
the design or operation of a control. For example, auditors perform walkthroughs of an enti­
ty’s business process (e.g., revenue) where they “walk” a sales transaction from its origi­
nation (customer order) to its inclusion in the financial statements. While performing the 
walkthrough, the auditor will inquire of, and observe, entity personnel and inspect relevant 
documents.
The operating effectiveness of the control can be affected by whether the control is per­
formed manually or is automated. If the control is performed manually, it may be subject to 
human errors or mistakes in its application. If properly designed, automated controls should 
operate more consistently, and the auditor usually does not need to test as many instances 
of an automated control’s operation because automated application controls should function 
consistently unless the program is changed. To test automated controls, the auditor may need 
to use techniques that are different from those used to test manual controls. For example, 
computer-assisted audit techniques may be used to test automated controls. The Advanced 
Module in Chapter 7 discusses computer-assisted audit techniques.
Concluding on the Achieved Level of Control Risk
After the planned tests of controls have been completed, the auditor should reach a conclusion 
on the achieved level of control risk. The auditor uses the combination of the achieved level of 
control risk and the assessed level of inherent risk to determine the level of detection risk that 
is needed in order to bring audit risk to an acceptably low level. In turn, the level of detection 
risk is used to determine the nature, timing, and extent of substantive tests.
Figure 6–2 shows the decision process followed by the auditor upon completing the 
planned tests of controls. If the tests of controls are consistent with the auditor’s planned 
assessment of control risk, no revision in the nature, timing, or extent of substantive proce­
dures is necessary. On the other hand, if the tests of controls indicate that the controls are not 
operating as preliminarily assessed, this means that the achieved level of control risk is higher 
than the planned level and that thus the nature, timing, and extent of planned substantive pro­
cedures will have to be modified.
Documenting the Achieved Level of Control Risk
The auditor should document the achieved level of control risk for the controls evaluated. The 
auditor’s assessment of the level of control risk can be documented using a structured working 
paper, an internal control questionnaire, or a memorandum.
An Example
Table 6–5 presents two account balances from EarthWear Clothiers’ financial statements that 
differ in terms of their nature, size, and complexity. The differences in these characteris­
tics result in different levels of understanding of internal control and different control risk 
assessments.
Stop and Think: Review Table 6–5 and its information. Why would an auditor decide 
to follow a substantive strategy for the Prepaid Advertising account but a reliance strat­
egy for the Inventory account?
In this example, inventory is a material account balance that is composed of numerous 
products. This account also contains significant inherent risk, and the data for this account are 
generated by a complex computer system. For inventory, the auditor must understand the con­
trol environment factors, risk assessment factors, monitoring activities, significant classes of 
transactions, inventory pricing policies, the flow of transactions, and what control activities will 
be relied upon. The auditor will use the audit procedures discussed earlier in the chapter to 
obtain an understanding of internal control for inventory. In contrast, while Prepaid Advertising

is a significant account, it contains few transactions. There is little or no inherent risk and the 
accounting records are simple, so the knowledge needed about the entity’s risk assessment pro­
cess, information system and communication, and monitoring regarding this account is minimal. 
In this instance, the auditor only needs to understand the control environment factors, the nature 
of the account balance, and the entity’s monitoring activities. Audit procedures for the Prepaid 
Advertising account would likely be limited to recalculation of amortization of the account.
Substantive Procedures
The last step in the decision process under either strategy is performing substantive proce­
dures. Note that auditing standards require some substantive testing for all significant account 
balances or classes of transactions. As discussed in Chapter 5, substantive procedures include 
substantive analytical procedures and tests of details.
Table 6–6 presents two examples of how the nature, timing, and extent of substantive 
procedures may vary for two different entities as a function of the detection risk level for the 
inventory account, which is part of the purchasing process. Assume that audit risk is set low 
for both entities but that entity 1 has a high level of risk of material misstatement (inherent 
risk and control risk), while entity 2 has a low level of risk of material misstatement. The use 
of the audit risk model results in setting detection risk at low for entity 1 and high for entity 
2. For entity 1, to achieve a low detection risk the auditor must (1) obtain more reliable types 
of substantive evidence, such as confirmation and reperformance; (2) conduct most of the 
substantive audit work at year-end (as such tests are usually considered to be stronger than 
tests done at an interim date); and (3) make the tests more extensive (larger sample size). 
This is because the auditor must fill the assurance bucket almost entirely with substantive 
evidence. In contrast, entity 2 has a high detection risk, which means that (1) less reliable 
types of evidence, such as analytical procedures, can be obtained; (2) most of the audit work 
can be conducted at an interim date; and (3) tests of the inventory account would involve a 
smaller sample size. Another major difference between the two strategies involves the physi­
cal examination of the inventory on hand. For the low-detection-risk strategy, physical inven­
tory would be examined at year-end because the control risk was assessed to be high. For the 
high-detection-risk strategy, the auditor can examine the physical inventory at an interim date 
because the control risk assessment indicates little risk of material misstatement.

Timing of Audit Procedures
Audit procedures may be conducted at an interim date or at year-end. Figure 6–5 presents a 
timeline for planning and performing a midsize to large audit for an entity such as EarthWear 
Clothiers with a 12/31/15 year-end. In this example, the auditor develops an understanding 
of the entity and its environment and plans the audit around 5/31/15. The interim tests of 
controls are conducted sometime during the time frame 7/31/15 to 11/30/15. Substantive pro­
cedures are planned for the time frame 11/30/15 to 2/15/16, after which the audit report is to 
be issued. The auditor’s considerations of conducting tests of controls and substantive tests at 
an interim date are discussed in turn.
Interim Tests of Controls
An auditor might test controls at an interim date because the assertion being tested may not 
be significant, the control has been effective in prior audits, or it may be more efficient to 
conduct the tests at that time. A reason why it may be more efficient to conduct interim tests 
of controls is that staff accountants may be less busy than at year-end. Additionally, if the con­
trols are found not to be operating effectively, testing them at an interim date gives the auditor 
more time to reassess the control risk and modify the audit plan. It also gives the auditor time 
to inform management so that likely misstatements can be located and corrected before the 
rest of the audit is performed, and so that deficiencies in the controls can be identified and 
remediated before year-end.
An important question the auditor must address is the need for additional audit work in 
the period following the interim testing period. For example, suppose the auditor examines

controls over a sample of sales transactions for the period 1/1/15 to 8/31/15. What testing, if 
any, should the auditor conduct for the period 9/1/15 to 12/31/15? In determining the nature and 
extent of audit work for the remaining period, the auditor should consider factors such as the 
significance of the assertion, the evaluation of the design and operation of the relevant controls, 
the results of tests of controls, the length of the remaining period, and the planned substantive 
procedures. At a minimum, the auditor would inquire about the nature and extent of changes in 
policies, procedures, or personnel that occurred subsequent to the interim period. An audit of 
internal control over financial reporting is required if the entity is a public company. Significant 
testing of controls around year-end is necessary in such circumstances (see Chapter 7).
Interim Substantive Procedures
Conducting substantive procedures only at an interim date may increase the risk that material 
misstatements are present in the financial statements. The auditor can control for this potential 
problem by considering when it is appropriate to examine an account at an interim date and 
by performing selected audit procedures for the period between the interim date and year-end.
The auditor should consider the following factors when deciding whether substantive 
procedures are to be performed at an interim date:
	
∙	 The control environment and other relevant controls.
	
∙	 The availability of information at a later date that is necessary for the auditor’s 
procedures (e.g., information stored electronically for a limited period of time).
	
∙	 The purpose of the substantive procedure.
	
∙	 The assessed risk of material misstatement.
	
∙	 The nature of the class of transactions or account balance and relevant assertions.
	
∙	 The ability of the auditor to perform appropriate substantive procedures or 
substantive procedures combined with tests of controls to cover the remaining period 
in order to reduce the risk that misstatement that may exist at the period-end will not 
be detected.
For example, if the entity’s accounting system has control weaknesses that result in a high 
level of assessed control risk, it is unlikely that the auditor would conduct substantive proce­
dures at an interim date. In this instance, the auditor has little assurance that the accounting 
system will generate accurate information during the remaining period.
When the auditor conducts substantive procedures of an account at an interim date, some 
additional substantive procedures are ordinarily conducted in the remaining period. Gener­
ally, this would include comparing the year-end account balance with the interim account 
balance. It might also involve conducting analytical procedures or reviewing related journals 
and ledgers for large or unusual transactions during the remaining period. If misstatements are 
detected during interim testing, the auditor will have to revise the planned substantive proce­
dures for the remaining period or perform some additional substantive procedures at year-end.
In some instances, an entity may contract to have some or all of its accounting transactions 
processed by an outside service organization. Examples of such service organizations include 
mortgage bankers that service mortgages for others and trust departments that invest or hold 
assets for employee benefit plans. More commonly, however, service organizations are IT 
service centers that process transactions such as payroll and the related accounting reports. 
Auditing standards provide guidance to the auditor when an entity uses a service organization 
to process certain transactions.
When a service organization provides accounting services to an entity, those services are 
considered part of the entity’s information system and relevant to financial reporting if these

204	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
services affect the entity’s accounting records. The significance of the controls of the service 
organization to those of the entity depends primarily on the nature and materiality of the 
transactions it processes for the entity and the degree of interaction between its activities and 
those of the entity. For example, if the entity initiates transactions and the service organization 
executes and does the accounting processing of those transactions, there is a high degree of 
interaction.
Because the entity’s transactions are subjected to the controls of the service organiza­
tion, one of the auditor’s concerns is the internal control system in place at the service orga­
nization. Thus, the auditor’s understanding of the entity’s internal control components may 
include controls placed in operation by the entity and the service organization.
After obtaining an understanding of internal control, the auditor identifies controls that 
are applied by the entity or the service organization that might allow an assessment of reduced 
control risk. The auditor may obtain evidence to support the lower assessment of control risk 
by testing the entity’s controls over the activities performed by the service organization or by 
testing controls at the service organization.
Because service organizations process data for many customers, they commonly engage 
an auditor to issue an attestation report regarding the controls they have in place over transac­
tions that might materially impact their customers’ financial reports. Such a report is called a 
Service Organization Controls 1 (or “SOC 1”) report.5 The SOC 1 report can be relied on by 
the auditors of all of the service organization’s customers, making a separate audit by each of 
those auditors unnecessary.
A service organization’s auditor can issue one of two types of SOC 1 reports. The first is 
a report on management’s description of a service organization’s system and the suitability of 
the design of controls (referred to as a Type 1 report). Such a report includes management’s 
description of the service organization’s system, a written assertion by management stating that 
the description fairly presents the system, and the auditor’s opinion as to whether the service 
organization’s controls are suitably designed to achieve management’s control objectives as of 
the end of the period. A Type 2 report includes not only the auditor’s opinion on the suitability 
of the design of the service organization’s controls, but also on the operating effectiveness of 
those controls. Thus, a Type 2 report includes all of the requirements of a Type 1 report and 
provides assurance on the operating effectiveness of the service organization’s controls based 
on the auditor’s tests of those controls. An auditor may reduce control risk below high for a 
client that uses a service organization on the basis of a service auditor’s SOC 1, Type 2 report.
5SOC 1 reports on controls at a service organization used to be known as “SAS 70 Reports.” SOC 1 reports are now 
issued under the standards for attestation engagements, AT 801, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization. See 
Chapter 21 for a discussion of the attestation standards and also of SOC 2 and SOC 3 reports. These latter reports 
involve a much broader range of controls than does a SOC 1 report, which focuses only on service organizations’ 
controls over financial reporting.
Practice 
INSIGHT
During an inspection of one of the Big 4 firms, the PCAOB inspection team identified matters that 
it considered to be audit deficiencies, one of which had to do with using information provided by 
a service organization to estimate a significant contingency. In this audit, the firm failed to test the 
completeness of information provided by a service organization used to calculate this contingent 
liability. The firm also failed to test controls regarding this information and thus failed to obtain suf­
ficient evidence to support the firm’s opinion on the issuer’s internal control over financial reporting.
Communication of Internal Control–Related Matters
Standards for reporting internal control deficiencies differ for public versus private entities 
(referred to as “nonissuers”). Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management of public 
companies must prepare an assertion on internal control effectiveness and their registered 
auditors must issue an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. These requirements are 
covered in Chapter 7.
LO 6-14

	
Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
205
Although a financial statement audit for private companies does not include an audit 
of the entity’s system of internal control, the auditor may discover deficiencies in the 
entity’s internal controls during the audit. A control deficiency in internal control exists 
when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the 
normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent, or detect and correct, 
misstatements on a timely basis. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material 
misstatement of the entity’s financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and 
corrected, on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of 
deficiencies, in internal control that is less severe than a material weakness yet important 
enough to merit attention by those charged with governance. Significant deficiencies and 
material weaknesses may be identified as part of the auditor’s consideration of the five 
components of internal control or through a root cause analysis of accounting misstate­
ments discovered by the auditor’s substantive procedures. Table 6–7 presents examples of 
circumstances that might indicate a control deficiency, significant deficiency, or material 
weakness.
The auditor must communicate, in writing, any discovered significant deficiencies and 
material weaknesses to management and those charged with governance.
Advanced Module 1: Types of Controls in an IT Environment
As discussed in the chapter, there are two broad categories of information systems control 
activities: general controls and application controls. General controls relate to the overall 
information processing environment and have a pervasive effect on the entity’s computer 
operations. General controls are sometimes referred to as supervisory, management, or infor­
mation technology controls. Application controls apply to the processing of specific com­
puter applications and are part of the computer programs used in the accounting system (for 
example, revenues or purchasing).
LO 6-15
Examples of Circumstances That May Be Control Deficiencies, Significant 
Deficiencies, or Material Weaknesses
Deficiencies in the Design of Controls
 • Inadequate design of internal control over the preparation of the financial statements being audited.
 • Inadequate design of internal control over a significant account or process.
 • Inadequate documentation of the components of internal control.
 • Insufficient control consciousness within the organization, for example, the tone at the top and the control environment.
 • Absent or inadequate segregation of duties within a significant account or process.
 • Absent or inadequate controls over the safeguarding of assets.
 • Inadequate design of information technology (IT) general and application controls.
 • Employees or management who lack the qualifications and training to fulfill their assigned functions.
 • Inadequate design of monitoring controls.
 • The absence of an internal process to report deficiencies in internal control to management on a timely basis.
Failures in the Operation of Internal Control
 • Failure in the operation of effectively designed controls over a significant account or process.
 • Failure of the information and communication component of internal control to provide complete and accurate output because of deficiencies in timeli­
ness, completeness, or accuracy.
 • Failure of controls designed to safeguard assets from loss, damage, or misappropriation.
 • Failure to perform reconciliations of significant accounts.
 • Undue bias or lack of objectivity by those responsible for accounting decisions.
 • Misrepresentation by entity personnel to the auditor (an indicator of fraud).
 • Management override of controls.
 • Failure of an application control caused by a deficiency in the design or operation of an IT general control.
 • An observed deviation rate that exceeds the number of deviations expected by the auditor in a test of operating effectiveness of a control.

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
General Controls
General controls include controls over
	
∙	 Data center and network operations.
	
∙	 System software acquisition, change, and maintenance.
	
∙	 Access security.
	
∙	 Application system acquisition, development, and maintenance.
Data Center and Network Operations Controls  Data center and network operations 
controls include controls over computer and network operations, data preparation, work flow 
control, and library functions. Important controls over computer and network operations 
should prevent unauthorized access to the network programs, files, and systems documenta­
tion by computer operators. In IT systems, traditional controls such as rotation of operator 
duties and mandatory vacations should be implemented. The operating systems log, which 
documents all program and operator activities, should be regularly reviewed to ensure that 
operators have not performed any unauthorized activities.
Controls over data preparation include proper entry of data into an application system 
and proper oversight of error correction. Controls over work flow include scheduling of appli­
cation programs, proper setup for programs, and use of the correct data files. The library func­
tion needs controls to ensure that (1) the correct files are provided for specific applications, 
(2) files are properly maintained, and (3) backup and recovery procedures exist.
Systems Software Acquisition, Change, and Maintenance Controls  Systems soft­
ware are computer programs that control the computer functions and allow the application 
programs to run. These programs include operating systems, library and security packages, 
and database management systems. For example, the operating system controls the operations 
of the computer and allocates computer resources among the application programs. The oper­
ating system also detects and corrects processing errors. The entity should have strong con­
trols that ensure proper approval for purchases of new system software and adequate controls 
over changes and maintenance of existing systems software. Generally, an approval process 
similar to the one described below for application systems can accomplish this.
Access and Security Controls  These general controls are concerned with (1) physical 
protection of computer equipment, software, and data and (2) loss of assets and information 
through theft or unauthorized use. Security controls include locating the computer facilities in 
a separate building or in a secure part of a building. They also include limiting access to the 
computer facilities through the use of locked doors with authorized personnel being admitted 
through use of a conventional key, an authorization card, or physical recognition. Security 
must also be maintained within the computer facility. For example, programmers must not be 
allowed access to the computer room; this restriction will prevent them from making unau­
thorized modifications to systems and application programs.
There must also be adequate protection against events such as fire and water damage, 
electrical problems, and sabotage. Proper construction of computer facilities can minimize 
the damage from such events. In order to ensure that the entity’s operations are not inter­
rupted by such events, the entity should have an operational disaster recovery plan, which may 
include an off-site backup location for processing critical applications.
Unauthorized access to programs or data can cause loss of assets and information. Physi­
cal control over programs and data can be maintained by a separate library function that 
controls access and use of files. In IT systems with online, real-time database systems and 
telecommunications technologies, programs and data can be accessed from outside the com­
puter facility. Access controls in IT systems should thus include physical security over remote 
terminals, authorization controls that limit access to only authorized information, firewalls, 
user identification controls such as passwords, and data communication controls such as 
encryption of data. Without such controls, an unauthorized user could access the system, with 
a resulting loss of assets or a decrease in the reliability of data.

	
Chapter 6    Internal Control in a Financial Statement Audit	
207
Application Systems Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance Controls  These 
controls are critical for ensuring the reliability of information processing. The ability to audit 
accounting systems is greatly improved if (1) the entity follows common policies and proce­
dures for systems acquisition or development; (2) the internal and/or external auditors are 
involved in the acquisition or development process; and (3) proper user, system operator, and 
program documentation is provided for each application.6 For example, having internal or 
external auditors involved early in the design of the system can ensure that proper controls are 
built into the system.
The entity should establish written policies and procedures for planning, acquiring or devel­
oping, and implementing new systems. Normally, a request for a new system is submitted by the 
user department to the IT department or an information services committee. A feasibility study 
may be conducted that includes cost-benefit analysis, hardware and software needs, and the sys­
tem’s impact on current applications and operations. Next, the system is acquired or designed, 
programmed, tested, and implemented. Last, the entity should prepare good documentation, 
including flowcharts, file layouts, source code listings, and operator instructions. This level of 
documentation is necessary not only for the entity’s ability to manage its system and controls 
but also for the auditors to understand the accounting systems, including application controls, so 
that tests of controls and substantive testing can be properly planned and conducted.
The entity must also have strong controls to ensure that once programs are placed into 
operation, all authorized changes are properly made and unauthorized changes are prevented. 
Although not as detailed, the controls for program changes are similar to those followed for 
new systems development. From the auditor’s perspective, the important issue here is whether 
changes to programs are properly authorized, tested, and implemented.
Application Controls
Application controls apply to the processing of individual accounting applications, such as 
sales or payroll, and help ensure the completeness and accuracy of transaction processing, 
authorization, and validity. Although application controls are typically discussed under the 
categories of input, processing, and output controls, changes in technology have blurred the 
distinctions among input, processing, and output. For example, many of the data validation 
checks that were once performed as part of production programs are now accomplished with 
sophisticated editing routines and intelligent data-entry equipment. As a result, application 
controls are discussed under the following categories:
	
∙	 Data capture controls.
	
∙	 Data validation controls.
	
∙	 Processing controls.
	
∙	 Output controls.
	
∙	 Error controls.
Data Capture Controls  Data capture controls must ensure that (1) all transactions are 
recorded in the application system; (2) transactions are recorded only once; and (3) rejected 
transactions are identified, controlled, corrected, and reentered into the system. Thus, data 
capture controls are concerned primarily with occurrence, completeness, and accuracy asser­
tions. For example, checking that all transactions are recorded in the system relates to the 
completeness objective.
There are three ways of capturing data in an information system: (1) source documenta­
tion, (2) direct data entry, or (3) a combination of the two. When source documents are pres­
ent, batch processing is an effective way of controlling data capture. Batching is simply the 
process of grouping similar transactions for data entry. It is important that each batch be well 
controlled. This can be accomplished by assigning each batch a unique number and recording 
6Note that external auditor involvement in the information systems acquisition and development process is severely 
limited when the entity is a public company. See Chapter 19 for further details.

208	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
it in a batch register or log. A cover sheet should also be attached to each batch with spaces 
for recording the batch number, the date, the signatures of various persons who processed the 
batch, and information on errors detected. To ensure complete processing of all transactions 
in a batch, some type of batch total should be used.
Direct data entry, on the other hand, involves online processing of the data with no source 
documents. The combination method may involve entry of the data from source documents 
directly through online processing. If direct data entry or a combination of source documents 
and direct data entry is used, the system should create a transaction log. The log should con­
tain a detailed record of each transaction, including date and time of entry, terminal and oper­
ator identification, and a unique number (such as customer order number).
Data Validation Controls  These controls can be applied at various stages, depending 
on the entity’s IT capabilities, and are mainly concerned with the accuracy assertion. When 
source documents are batch-processed, the data are taken from source documents and tran­
scribed to tape or disk. The data are then validated by an edit program or by routines that 
are part of the production programs. When the data are entered directly into offline storage 
through an intelligent terminal or directly into a validation program with subsequent (delayed 
or real-time) processing into the application system, each individual transaction should be 
subjected to a number of programmed edit checks. Table 6–8 lists common validation tests. 
For example, a payroll application program may have a limit test that subjects any employee 
payroll transaction involving more than 80 hours worked to review before processing.
Some entities use turnaround documents to improve data accuracy. Turnaround docu­
ments are output documents from the application that are used as source documents in later 
processing. For example, a monthly statement sent to a customer may contain two parts; one 
part of the monthly statement is kept by the customer, while the other part is returned with the 
payment. The latter part of the statement contains encoded information that can be processed 
using various input devices. By using a turnaround document, the entity does not have to 
reenter the data, thus avoiding data capture and data validation errors.
With direct data (online) entry, accuracy can be improved by special validation routines 
that may be programmed to prompt the data entry personnel. Here the system requests the 
desired input data and then waits for an acceptable response before requesting the next piece 
of input data. In many cases, the screen displays the document format with blanks that are 
completed by data entry personnel. The validation routine can include a completeness test to 
ensure that all data items are completed before processing. Airline reservation systems and 
catalog retailers (like EarthWear ) that take phone orders use this type of entry system. Enter­
ing data over an entity’s website can be controlled in a similar manner.
Processing Controls  These are controls that ensure proper processing of transactions. In some 
information systems, many of the controls discussed under data validation may be performed as 
part of data processing. General controls play an important role in providing assurance about the

quality of processing controls. If the entity has strong general controls (such as application sys­
tems acquisition, development, and maintenance controls; library controls; personnel practices; 
and separation of duties), it is likely that programs will be properly written and tested, correct files 
will be used for processing, and unauthorized access to the system will be limited.
Output Controls  Output includes reports, checks, documents, and other printed or dis­
played (on terminal screens) information. Controls over output from computer systems are 
important application controls. The main concern here is that computer output may be dis­
tributed or displayed to unauthorized users. A number of controls should be present to mini­
mize the unauthorized use of output. A report distribution log should contain a schedule 
of when reports are prepared, the names of individuals who are to receive the report, and 
the date of distribution. Some type of transmittal sheet indicating the intended recipients’ 
names and addresses should be attached to each copy of the output. A release form may be 
part of the transmittal sheet and should be signed by the individual acknowledging receipt 
of the report.
The data control group should be responsible for reviewing the output for reasonableness 
and reconciling the control or batch totals to the output. The user departments should also 
review the output for completeness and accuracy because they may be the only ones with suf­
ficient knowledge to recognize certain types of errors.
Error Controls  Errors can be identified at any point in the system. While most transaction 
errors should be identified by data capture and data validation controls, some errors may be 
identified by processing controls or output controls. After identification, errors must be cor­
rected and resubmitted to the application system at the correct point in processing. Error con­
trols help ensure that errors are handled appropriately. For example, if a transaction is entered 
with an incorrect customer number, it should be rejected by a validity test. After the customer 
number is corrected, it should be resubmitted into the system. Errors that result from process­
ing transactions (such as data entry errors) should be corrected and resubmitted by the data 
center control group. Errors that occur outside the IT department (such as omitted or invalid 
data) should be corrected by the appropriate user department and resubmitted. This segrega­
tion of duties prevents the data center control group from processing invalid transactions.
Advanced Module 2: Flowcharting Techniques
From the auditor’s perspective, a flowchart is a diagrammatic representation of the entity’s 
accounting system. The information systems literature typically discusses three types of flow­
charts: document flowcharts, systems flowcharts, and program flowcharts. A document flow­
chart (or data flow diagramming) represents the flow of documents among departments in the 
entity. A systems flowchart extends this approach by including the processing steps, including 
computer processing, in the flowchart. A program flowchart illustrates the operations per­
formed by the computer in executing a program. Flowcharts that are typically used by public 
accounting firms combine document and systems flowcharting techniques. Such flowcharts 
show the path from the origination of the transactions to their recording in the accounting jour­
nals and ledgers. While there are some general guidelines on preparing flowcharts for docu­
menting accounting systems, the reader should understand that public accounting firms often 
modify these techniques to correspond with their firm’s audit approaches and technologies.
Following are a number of common guidelines that are used in preparing flowcharts.
Symbols
A standard set of symbols is used to represent documents and processes. Figure 6–6 presents 
examples of the more commonly used symbols. Note that the symbols are divided into three 
groups: input/output symbols, processing symbols, and data flow and storage symbols.

Organization and Flow
A well-designed flowchart typically starts in the upper left part of the page and proceeds 
to the lower right part of the page. When it is necessary to show the movement of a docu­
ment or report back to a previous function, an on-page connector should be used. When the 
flowchart continues to a subsequent page, the movement of documents or reports can be 
handled by using an off-page connector. Flow arrows show the movement of documents, 
records, or information. When processes or activities cannot be fully represented by flow­
chart symbols, the auditor should supplement the flowchart with written comments. This 
can be accomplished by using the annotation symbol or just writing the comment directly 
on the flowchart.
A flowchart is typically designed along the lines of the entity’s departments or 
­functions. It is thus important to indicate the delineation of activities between the depart­
ments or functions. As shown in Figure 6–3, this can be accomplished by using a vertical 
dashed line.

Control environment. The tone of an organization, which reflects the overall attitude, aware­
ness, and actions of the board of directors, management, and owners influencing the control 
consciousness of its people.
Control risk. The risk that a misstatement that could occur in an assertion about an account

Monitoring of controls. A process that assesses the quality of internal control performance 
over time.
Reliance strategy. The auditor’s decision to rely on the entity’s controls, test those controls, 
and reduce the direct tests of the financial statement accounts.
Significant deficiency. A deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control 
that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those 
charged with governance.

LO 6-5, 6-6	
6-32	 Koss Corporation: Where were the internal controls? (Refer back to Problem 4-33 
for the basic facts on the Koss Corporation embezzlement.) On ­September 2, 2010, 
the Securities & Exchange Commission brought an action against Sujata Sachdeva, 
vice president of finance, and Koss senior accountant and subordinate, Julie 
­Mulvaney, who allegedly helped her cover up the fraudulent scheme. The SEC 
alleged that Sachdeva and Mulvaney caused Koss to submit false and misleading 
financial statements. Sachdeva regularly relied on Mulvaney to reconcile the cash 
shortfalls and to balance the books.
	
	
	 	
Sachdeva and Mulvaney primarily hid the embezzlement by making false entries 
on the Company’s general journal. For example, the false journal entries disguised 
the theft by overstating assets, expenses, and cost of sales, and understating liabili­
ties and sales. Mulvaney maintained binders that detailed numerous false journal 
entries that were made to the Company’s accounting books and records. With those 
entries, Mulvaney reclassified Company funds—with no supporting documentation 
and no legitimate explanation. Mulvaney also maintained a series of folders that 
included documentation of over 100 fraudulent transactions that were included in the 
Company’s accounting books and records.
	
	
	 	
Sachdeva and Mulvaney were able to hide the substantial embezzlements in part 
because the Company did not adequately maintain internal controls to reasonably 
assure the accuracy and reliability of financial reporting. Koss’s internal controls 
policy required Michael Koss to approve invoices of $5,000 or more for payment. 
However, Koss allegedly delegated duties typically done by the CFO to Sachdeva 
on a regular basis. Koss also had little or no educational background or experience 
in accounting or finance. Many of the cashier’s checks exceeded $5,000, and some 
exceeded $100,000. However, its controls did not prevent Sachdeva and Mulvaney 
from processing large wire transfers and cashier’s checks outside of the accounts 
payable system to pay for Sachdeva’s personal purchases without seeking or obtain­
ing Michael Koss’s approval. In addition, many account reconciliations were not 
prepared, maintained, or reviewed as part of Koss’s accounting records. Koss’s com­
puterized accounting system was almost 30 years old.

6-33	 Dixon, Illinois: Using Public Funds to Support a Show Horse Operation. 
On February 14, 2013, former city comptroller and treasurer of Dixon, IL, Rita 
Crundwell was sentenced to 191 ̸2 years in prison for diverting $53 million from city 
funds for her own benefit. It appears that the fraud began in 1990 at a relatively small 
amount, but the level of her embezzlements increased significantly in the last years 
of the embezzlement (e.g., in 2008 she embezzled $5.8 million). Crundwell used the

proceeds to finance her horse breeding business and her lavish lifestyle. She pur­
chased 400 horses, farms, trucks, a $2 million RV, and jewelry. Her position as city 
treasurer paid about $80,000 a year at the time of her arrest.
	
	
	 	
Rita Crundwell was one of the most trusted people in Dixon, IL’s city govern­
ment. She started working for the finance department for the city while still in high 
school in 1970. In 1983, she was appointed as the comptroller/treasurer. As comp­
troller, Crundwell handled all of the finances for the city of Dixon. Crundwell par­
ticipated in budget meetings for the city with other city council members and voiced 
a need for Dixon to make spending cuts due to a lack of sufficient funds. Many of the 
city officials who held elected position were not full-time employees of the city.
	
	
	 	
The process by which Crundwell was able to obtain the funds was not extremely 
complicated. According to the indictment, Crundwell opened a bank account at Fifth 
Third Bank in 1990 in the name of the city of Dixon and RSCDA (Reserve Sewer 
Development Account). That account appeared to be for the benefit of the city of 
Dixon, but Crundwell was the only signatory and the only person who wrote checks 
from that account. Crundwell was able to deposit city funds from other sources into 
the Capital Development Fund account. After she created false invoices, Crundwell 
would write checks from that fund payable to “Treasurer.” She then deposited those 
checks directly into the RSCDA account. The Fifth Third Bank assumed the money 
in the RSCDA account was for the city. Crundwell repeatedly transferred city funds 
into the RSCDA account and used the money to pay for her own personal and private 
business expenses.
	
	
	 	
In October 2011, when Crundwell was away from work, another individual 
employed by the city of Dixon, requested Fifth Third Bank to forward all of the city’s 
bank statements. This employee realized that the account appeared to be inappro­
priate and informed Mayor James Burke of the account. Burke determined that the 
account did not relate to any legitimate business of the city. Burke then notified the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
	
	
	 	
In September 2013, the city announced it settled its lawsuit against the auditors 
and bank for $40 million. During the time of the fraud, Dixon’s financial statements 
were audited by CliftonLarsonAllen (formerly Clifton Gunderson LLP). The firm 
agreed to pay $35.15 million and Fifth Third Bank agreed to pay $3.85 million. Clif­
tonLarsonAllen conceded it shared in the “responsibility for the fact that the fraud 
was not detected.” The attorney for the city stated Mayor Bruce also faulted Fifth 
Third Bank for violating banking standards by allowing Crundwell to open a city 
account in 1990 without proper documentation, even if employees knew she worked 
for the city.

Auditing Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting
T
he Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed significant requirements on 
both management and auditors of public companies. In particular, Sec­
tion 404 of the Act requires that management report on the effective­
ness of its internal control over financial reporting (ICFR) and that the auditor 
also provide an attestation on the effectiveness of ICFR based on standards 
issued by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB).
In 2007, the SEC issued guidance for management and the PCAOB issued 
Auditing Standard No. 5, An Audit of Internal Control over Financial Report­
ing That Is Integrated with an Audit of Financial Statements (AS5), for auditors. 
These documents require that management and the auditor follow a top-down, 
risk-based approach to evaluating ICFR. While the cost of compliance has 
been high, evidence suggests that the audit of ICFR has produced significant 
benefits. These include a reemphasis on corporate governance and controls 
and higher-quality financial reporting.
This chapter covers what management must do in order to issue a report 
that the entity’s ICFR is effective and how the auditor performs an audit regard­
ing the effectiveness of ICFR.1 The material covered in this chapter applies to 
companies subject to the reporting requirements of Section 404 of the 
­Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 amended Section 
404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by exempting certain smaller companies, known 
as “non-accelerated filers,” from the requirement for an external audit of inter­
nal control over financial reporting. However, these smaller companies, which 
typically have common equity held by noninsiders of less than $75 million, 
must still provide management’s annual assessment of internal controls.
1As of the writing of this edition of the textbook, the AICPA’s Auditing Standards Board is drafting a proposed audit-
ing standard entitled, “An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That is Integrated With an Audit of 
Financial Statements,” to establish requirements and provide guidance that applies only when an auditor is engaged 
to perform an audit of ICFR that is integrated with an audit of financial statements. Integrated audits are required by 
certain regulatory bodies. The new standard may be effective as soon as December 2016.

222	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Management Responsibilities under Section 404
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires managements of publicly traded companies 
to issue a report that accepts responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate ICFR 
and to assert whether ICFR is effective as of the end of the fiscal year. This assessment is to 
be made as of a specific point in time—that is, “as of” the end of the fiscal year. Thus, man­
agement’s assessment does not cover the entire year. This has implications for any control 
deficiencies discovered during the year. The “as-of” nature of the assessment in many cases 
allows management to remediate deficiencies discovered prior to year-end and still receive an 
unqualified opinion on ICFR.
Management must comply with the following requirements in order for the external audi­
tor to complete an audit of ICFR:
	
∙	 Accept responsibility for the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR.
	
∙	 Evaluate the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR using suitable control criteria.
	
∙	 Support the evaluation with sufficient evidence, including documentation.
	
∙	 Present a written assessment regarding the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR as of the 
end of the entity’s most recent fiscal year.
Each of these steps is discussed below. Recognize, however, that the second and third bullets 
require a substantial investment of time, energy, and money on the part of the entity.
Auditor Responsibilities under Section 404 and AS5
Section 404 requires the auditor to audit management’s assertion about the effectiveness 
of ICFR. AS5 states that the auditor must conduct the audits of financial statements and 
ICFR in an integrated way because each audit provides the auditor with information relevant 
to the evaluation of the results of the other. The auditor’s objective in an audit of ICFR is 
“to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial 
reporting” (AS5, ¶3), while the objective in a financial statement audit is to express an opin­
ion on whether the financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles (GAAP).
To form a basis for expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of ICFR, the auditor 
must plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the entity 
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control as of the date specified in 
management’s assessment. Reasonable assurance in this context recognizes that no system 
of internal control is perfect and that there is a remote likelihood that material misstate­
ments will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis, even if controls are, in fact, 
effective. Like the financial statement audit, reasonable assurance indicates a high level 
of assurance.
Internal Control over Financial Reporting Defined
Chapter 6 presented the COSO definition of internal control. For purposes of both manage­
ment’s assessment and the audit of internal control, the PCAOB defines ICFR as
A process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and prin­
cipal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s 
board of directors, management, and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding 
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external pur­
poses in accordance with GAAP, and includes those policies and procedures that
(1)  Pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
LO 7-1
LO 7-2
LO 7-3

	
Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
223
(2)  Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation 
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that 
receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authoriza­
tions of management and directors of the company; and
(3)  Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acqui­
sition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the finan­
cial statements (AS5, ¶A5).
This definition makes it clear that the CEO and CFO are responsible for the reliability of 
ICFR and the preparation of the financial statements. It is the responsibility of the board of 
directors and management to implement an effective internal control system. You will note 
that the objectives of internal control in the PCAOB’s definition are more specific than the 
objectives listed in the COSO definition. Items (1) and (2) relate directly to controls for initi­
ating, authorizing, recording, processing, and reporting significant accounts and disclosures 
and related assertions embodied in the financial statements. Item (3) concerns controls over 
safeguarding of assets.
Internal Control Deficiencies Defined
Control Deficiency
For management and the auditor to assess whether ICFR is effective, it is necessary to define 
what constitutes a control deficiency and to define different levels of severity. While the 
PCAOB’s definitions in this area are somewhat technical, it is important that you invest the 
time and energy to understand them.
A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow 
management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, 
to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A design deficiency exists when 
(1) a control necessary to meet the relevant control objective is missing or (2) an exist­
ing control is not properly designed so that, even if the control operates as designed, the 
control objective would not be met. A deficiency in operation exists when a properly 
designed control does not operate as designed or when the person performing the con­
trol does not possess  the necessary authority or qualifications to perform the control 
­effectively (AS5, ¶A3).
Material Weakness
The focus of the audit of ICFR is on deficiencies that are serious enough that there is a 
reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the financial statements could result. 
Accordingly, the PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or combination of defi­
ciencies, in ICFR, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of 
the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
(AS5, ¶A7).
Significant Deficiency
A significant deficiency is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in 
ICFR that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by 
those responsible for oversight of the entity’s financial reporting (AS5, ¶A11).
Likelihood and Magnitude
According to the above definitions, in judging the significance of a control deficiency, man­
agement and the auditor must consider two dimensions of the control deficiency: likelihood 
and magnitude of misstatements that could result from the control deficiency. The definition 
of material weakness includes the phrase “reasonable possibility” and is to be interpreted 
using the guidance in FASB ASC Topic 450, “Contingencies.” Accordingly, the likelihood 
LO 7-4

224	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
of an event is a “reasonable possibility” if it is either reasonably possible or probable. While 
this guidance is helpful, these concepts are clearly subjective and require the application of 
considerable professional judgment.
Determining the magnitude of a financial statement misstatement that might result from 
a control deficiency also requires a great deal of professional judgment. In making such judg­
ments, the auditor should be satisfied that a “prudent official” would be likely to concur. In 
determining whether it is reasonably possible that a financial statement misstatement result­
ing from a control deficiency is material, the auditor relies on the same concept of materiality 
as is used in determining financial statement materiality.
Note that if likelihood is assessed as “remote,” an identified control issue does not even 
rise to the level of control deficiency. However, if likelihood is assessed as more than remote, 
the control issue will be considered a deficiency, a significant deficiency, or a material weak­
ness depending on the magnitude of the deficiency. Thus, the difference between a control 
deficiency and a significant deficiency, and between a significant deficiency and a material 
weakness, is determined solely by magnitude. Figure 7–1 represents how likelihood and mag­
nitude relate to each other in the determination of whether a control deficiency rises to the 
level of a significant deficiency or a material weakness.
Later in the chapter we discuss how the auditor applies the concepts of likelihood and 
materiality in an audit of ICFR as well as the auditor’s reporting responsibilities described in 
Figure 7–1.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Before deciding whether a significant deficiency or material weakness exists, AS5 requires the 
­auditor to evaluate the effectiveness of any compensating controls. To have a mitigating effect, the 
compensating control should operate at a level of precision that would prevent or detect a misstate­
ment that could be material (AS5, ¶68).

225
Management’s Assessment Process
In order to issue a report on the effectiveness of internal control, management needs to 
first design and implement an effective system of ICFR and then develop an ongoing 
assessment process. To assist management, the SEC issued guidance for evaluating and 
assessing ICFR that provides for a top-down, risk-based approach for management to fol­
low in evaluating and assessing ICFR. The purpose of management’s evaluation of ICFR 
is to provide management with a reasonable basis for its assessment as to whether any 
material weaknesses in ICFR exist as of the end of the period. The evaluation process has 
three steps:
	
1.	 Identify financial reporting risks and related controls.
	
2.	 Consider which locations to include in the evaluation.
	
3.	 Evaluate evidence about the operating effectiveness of ICFR.
Once the evaluation process is complete, management must address its reporting 
responsibilities.
Management is required to base its assessment of the entity’s ICFR on a suitable, rec­
ognized control framework established by a body of experts that follows due-process pro­
cedures. In the United States, most entities use the framework developed by COSO (COSO, 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework). Other suitable frameworks have been published in 
other countries. Review Chapter 6 for a discussion of the COSO framework.
Identify Financial Reporting Risks and Related Controls
Management must first identify and assess financial reporting risks— that is, the risk that a 
misstatement could result in a material misstatement of the financial statements. How man­
agement identifies financial reporting risks will vary based on the characteristics of the entity 
such as the size, complexity, and organizational structure of the entity and its processes and 
financial reporting environment.
Management then identifies controls that are in place to address the financial report­
ing risks. In addition to specific controls that address financial reporting risks, manage­
ment also evaluates whether there are controls in place to address entity-level controls and 
other pervasive elements of ICFR. Entity-level controls can have a pervasive effect on the 
entity’s ability to meet the COSO control criteria. Table 7–1 presents examples of entity-
level controls.
Management should then consider the effect of information technology (IT) general con­
trols that are necessary for proper and consistent operation of other technology-based controls 
designed to address financial reporting risks. Lastly, management must obtain and document 
reasonable evidential support for its assessment.
LO 7-5
Examples of Entity-Level Controls
 • Controls within the control environment (e.g., tone at the top, assignment of authority and responsibility, consistent 
policies and procedures, and entitywide programs, such as codes of conduct and fraud prevention, that apply to all 
locations and business units).
 • Controls over management override.
 • The entity’s risk assessment process.
 • Centralized processing and controls, including shared service environments.
 • Controls to monitor results of operations.
 • Controls to monitor other controls, including activities of the internal audit function, the audit committee, 
and self-assessment programs.
 • Controls over period-end financial reporting process.
 • Policies that address significant business control and risk management practices.

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Consider Which Locations to Include in the Evaluation
Management should generally include all of its locations and business units when consider­
ing financial reporting risks. However, the approach followed by management in choosing 
which locations to include in its assessment of internal control is a function of the presence 
of entity-level controls and the financial reporting risk at the individual locations or business 
units. If financial reporting risks are adequately addressed by entity-level controls, then the 
evaluation approach for the locations and business units would focus on those entity-level 
controls. When controls that are necessary to address financial reporting risks operate at more 
than one location or business unit, management needs to evaluate evidence of the operation of 
the controls at the individual locations or business units.
If management determines that financial reporting risks for the controls that operate at indi­
vidual locations or business units are low, management may rely on self-assessment processes 
in conjunction with entity-level controls for their assessment. When management determines 
that the financial reporting risks for the controls at an individual location are high, management 
will normally need to directly test the design and operation of the controls at that location.
Stop and Think: Take a moment and think about how a large, multinational corpora­
tion such as IBM or Coca-Cola would accomplish such a task. Later in the chapter we 
will present an approach to selecting locations.
Evaluate Evidence about the Operating Effectiveness of ICFR
The evaluation of the operating effectiveness of a control considers whether the control is 
operating as designed and whether the person performing the control possesses the necessary 
authority and competence to perform the control effectively. Management should focus its 
evaluation on areas that pose the highest risk to ICFR. As the risk of control failure increases, 
management will need more evidence to support its conclusion about the operating effective­
ness of the control. Table 7–2 shows controls that are typically included for testing.
Evidence on the operating effectiveness of a control may be obtained from direct testing 
of the control, ongoing monitoring, or both. Direct tests of controls are usually performed on 
a periodic basis by individuals with a high degree of objectivity (e.g., internal auditors) with 
respect to the control being tested. Ongoing monitoring includes self-assessment procedures 
and procedures to analyze performance measures (key performance indicators) designed to 
track the performance of the control.
Management’s assessment must be supported by evidence that provides reasonable sup­
port for its assessment. The nature and extent of this evidence will vary based on the assessed 
level of ICFR risk for controls over each of its financial reporting elements.
Reporting Considerations
In determining its reporting responsibilities, management first evaluates the severity of the con­
trol deficiencies identified. Similar to the approach taken by the auditor, management considers 
the likelihood of and magnitude to which the financial statements could be misstated by the 
control failure. If management determines that no material weaknesses exist, they can conclude 
that the entity’s ICFR was effective. Exhibit 7–1 provides an example management report.
Controls Typically Included for Testing
 • Entity-level controls (see Table 7–1).
 • Controls over initiating, authorizing, recording, processing, and reporting significant accounts and disclosures and 
related assertions embodied in the financial statements.
 • Controls over the selection and application of accounting policies that are in conformity with GAAP.
 • Antifraud programs and controls.
 • Controls, including IT general controls, on which other controls are dependent.
 • Controls over significant nonroutine and nonsystematic transactions, such as accounts involving judgments and 
estimates.

An Example of Management’s Report on Internal Control over 
Financial Reporting
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial report­
ing of the entity. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assur­
ance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external 
purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
The entity’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) per­
tain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions 
and dispositions of the assets of the entity; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded 
as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles gener­
ally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the entity are being 
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the entity; and (iii) provide 
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposi­
tion of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect 
misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance 
with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
based on the framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of 
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on this evaluation, management 
concluded that the entity’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2014.

If a control deficiency is determined to be a material weakness, management must dis­
close the material weakness in its assessment of the effectiveness of ICFR on an annual basis. 
The disclosure about the material weakness(es) should include the following:
	
∙	 The nature of the material weakness(es).
	
∙	 Its impact on the entity’s financial reporting and its ICFR.
	
∙	 Management’s current plans, if any, for remediating the material weakness.
Exhibit 7–2 presents an example of management’s disclosure of a material weakness. Any 
control deficiency that is considered a significant deficiency or material weakness should be 
reported to the audit committee and the external auditor.
Management’s assessment process involves special consideration of two topics: (1) ser­
vice organizations and (2) safeguarding assets. These topics must also be considered by the 
auditor during the audit of ICFR. Advanced Module 1 at the end of the chapter discusses each 
of these topics.
Management’s Documentation
The SEC’s guidance allows considerable flexibility to management in how it documents rea­
sonable support for its assessment. However, reasonable support should include the basis for 
management’s assessment and conclusion. Such documentation should include the design of

Disclosure and Remediation of a Material Weakness by 
Groupon Inc.’s Management
In connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, 
we concluded there is a material weakness in the design and operating effectiveness of our internal 
control over financial reporting as defined in SEC Regulation S-X. A material weakness is a deficiency, or 
a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable 
possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented 
or detected on a timely basis. The primary factors contributing to the material weakness, which relates to 
our financial statement close process, were:
 • We did not maintain financial close process and procedures that were adequately designed, docu­
mented and executed to support the accurate and timely reporting of our financial results. As a 
result, we made a number of manual post-close adjustments necessary in order to prepare the 
financial statements included in this Form 10-K.
 • We did not maintain effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that accounts were com­
plete and accurate and agreed to detailed support, and that account reconciliations were prop­
erly performed, reviewed and approved. While these activities should be performed in the ordinary 
course of our preparing our financial statements, we instead needed to undertake significant efforts 
to complete reconciliations and investigate items identified in those reconciliations during the 
course of our financial statement audit.
 • We did not have adequate policies and procedures in place to ensure the timely, effective review 
of estimates, assumptions and related reconciliations and analyses, including those related to cus­
tomer refund reserves. As noted previously, our original estimate disclosed on February 8 of the 
reserve for customer refunds proved to be inadequate after we performed additional analysis.
Groupon reported the following information at December 31, 2012, on the remediation of these mate­
rial weaknesses:
During the year ended December 31, 2012, we implemented internal control procedures to address 
a previously identified material weakness related to our financial statement close process. These internal 
controls included (a) procedures required to be performed during the financial close process that support 
the accurate and timely reporting of our financial results, (b) the preparation of timely account reconcilia­
tions that agree to detailed support and are properly reviewed and approved, and (c) the timely and effec­
tive review of estimates, assumptions and related reconciliations and analyses, including those related to 
the customer refund reserve and non-routine transactions, by appropriate levels of management. After 
completing our testing of the design and operating effectiveness of these new procedures, we concluded 
that we have remediated the previously identified material weakness as of December 31, 2012.

the controls management has placed in operation to adequately address identified financial 
reporting risks, including the entity-level controls and other pervasive elements necessary for 
effective ICFR. The guidance does not require management to identify and document every 
control in a process or to document the business processes impacting ICFR. Instead, docu­
mentation should focus on those controls management concludes are adequate to address the 
entity’s financial reporting risks.
Documentation of ICFR may take many forms, such as paper, electronic files, or other 
media. It also includes a variety of information, such as policy manuals, process models, 
flowcharts, job descriptions, documents, and forms.
Performing an Audit of ICFR
While the audit of ICFR and the audit of financial statements have different objectives, the 
auditor must plan and perform the audit work to achieve the objectives of both audits as an 
integrated audit. In planning the integrated audit, the auditor should design tests of controls to 
accomplish the objectives of both audits simultaneously. The auditor should incorporate the 
results of tests of controls from the audit of ICFR to support the control risk assessment for

the audit of the financial statements and should use those results for determining the nature, 
timing, and extent of substantive procedures. Similarly, the auditor should consider the results 
of substantive procedures on the conclusions about the effectiveness of ICFR. For example, 
if a misstatement is detected by substantive procedures, the auditor should consider how and 
why (i.e., root cause analysis) the controls failed to detect the misstatement and whether the 
control deficiency might affect the opinion on the audit of ICFR.
Figure 7–2 shows the steps involved in performing an audit of ICFR. We have placed 
key terms in parentheses to help you remember the process. While Figure 7–2 suggests a 
sequential process, the audit of ICFR involves an iterative process of gathering, updating, and 
analyzing information.
Plan the Audit of ICFR
Planning for the audit of ICFR typically is performed in conjunction with the financial state­
ment audit as discussed in Chapter 3. Table 7–3 contains some of the factors that are relevant 
to planning an audit of ICFR. 
In planning an audit of ICFR, the auditor considers the following activities:
	
∙	 The role of risk assessment and the risk of fraud.
	
∙	 Scaling the audit.
	
∙	 Using the work of others.
The Role of Risk Assessment and the Risk of Fraud
A major premise of AS5 is that risk assessment underlies the entire audit of ICFR. In other 
words, there should be a direct relationship between the risk that a material weakness could 
exist in a particular area of the internal controls of the entity and the amount of audit work that 
LO 7-7

230	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
is devoted to that area. Thus, the auditor should devote more attention to areas that have a high 
risk of a material weakness. 
A major part of risk assessment is assessing the risk of fraud. The auditor should evaluate 
the risk of material misstatement due to fraud and the risk of management override of con­
trols. The following controls should also be considered:
	
∙	 Controls over significant, unusual transactions, particularly those that result in late or 
unusual journal entries.
	
∙	 Controls over journal entries and adjustments made in the period-end financial 
reporting process.
	
∙	 Controls over related party transactions.
	
∙	 Controls related to significant management estimates.
	
∙	 Controls that mitigate incentives for, and pressures on, management to falsify or 
inappropriately manage financial results.
Scaling the Audit
AS5 (¶13) specifies that the “size and complexity of the company, its business processes, and 
business units, may affect the way in which the company achieves many of its control objec­
tives.” The auditor should recognize that the concepts behind achieving effective internal 
control can be scaled for companies of different size and complexity consistent with the risk-
based approach. AS5 explicitly recognizes and allows for the idea that a small, less-complex 
entity might achieve its control objectives differently from a large, complex entity.
Using the Work of Others
AS5 allows the auditor to use the work performed by, or receive direct assistance from, inter­
nal auditors, entity personnel, and third parties hired by management or the audit committee.
If the work of others is to be used, the auditor should assess the objectivity and com­
petence of the persons whose work will be used. AS5 refers to the relevant guidance for 
assessing competence and objectivity that was previously discussed in Chapter 3. Table 3–2 
provides the factors for assessing competence and objectivity.
The risk associated with the control being tested also plays a role in using the work of 
others. As the risk associated with the control increases, the auditor should perform more of 
the work. For example, the auditor will rely less on the work of others for a control relating to 
transactions that involve subjective judgments or that are highly susceptible to manipulation 
than for a control that relates to routine, objective transactions.
Factors That May Affect Planning an Audit of ICFR
 • Knowledge of the entity’s ICFR obtained during other engagements.
 • Matters affecting the industry in which the entity operates, such as financial reporting practices, economic 
­conditions, laws and regulations, and technological changes.
 • Matters relating to the entity’s business, including its organization, operating characteristics, and capital structure.
 • The extent of recent changes in the entity, its operations, or its ICFR.
 • Preliminary judgments about materiality, risk, and other factors relating to the determination of material 
weaknesses.
 • Control deficiencies previously communicated to the audit committee or management.
 • Legal or regulatory matters of which the entity is aware.
 • The type and extent of available evidence related to the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR.
 • Preliminary judgments about the effectiveness of ICFR.
 • Public information about the entity relevant to the evaluation of the likelihood of material financial statement 
­misstatements and the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR.
 • Knowledge about risks related to the entity evaluated as part of the auditor’s client acceptance and retention 
evaluation.
 • The relative complexity of the entity’s operations.

231
Identify Controls to Test
The next step in the process is to identify the controls to be tested. The auditor should use a 
top-down, risk-based approach to accomplish this step. As outlined in Figure 7–3, the auditor 
first identifies the entity-level controls. Next the auditor identifies the significant accounts 
and disclosures and understands where the likely sources of misstatements occur. Based on 
this information, the auditor selects which controls to test. 
Identify Entity-Level Controls
Table 7–1 contains a list of entity-level controls. Entity-level controls can have a pervasive 
effect on the entity’s ability to meet the COSO control criteria, and thus the auditor must test 
their effectiveness. The auditor’s evaluation of the entity-level controls can affect the extent of 
testing performed on other controls.
Two entity-level controls require specific evaluation by the auditor: (1) the control envi­
ronment and (2) the period-end financial reporting process.
Control Environment  Because of its importance to effective ICFR, the auditor must eval­
uate the control environment. In particular, the auditor should assess whether
	
∙	 Management’s philosophy and operating style promote effective ICFR.
	
∙	 Sound integrity and ethical values, particularly of top management, are developed and 
understood.
	
∙	 The Board or audit committee understands and exercises oversight responsibility over 
financial reporting and internal control.
Chapter 6 discusses how the auditor evaluates the control environment.
Period-End Financial Reporting Process  The period-end financial reporting process is 
important to the auditor’s opinion on ICFR and to financial statement reporting. The period-
end financial reporting process controls include procedures used to enter transaction totals into

the general ledger; select and apply accounting policies; initiate, authorize, record, and process 
period-end journal entries in the general ledger; record recurring and nonrecurring adjustments 
to the annual and quarterly financial statements; and prepare annual and quarterly financial 
statements and related disclosures. Even though these controls operate after the “as of” year-
end reporting date, they are used to support the auditor’s “as of” date opinion (see Exhibit 7–2).
The auditor’s evaluation of the period-end financial reporting process includes the inputs, 
procedures performed, and outputs of the processes the entity uses to produce its annual and 
quarterly financial statements. The auditor should also consider the extent of IT involvement 
in each period-end financial reporting process, who participates from management, the num­
ber of locations involved, the types of adjusting and consolidating entries, and the nature and 
extent of the oversight of the process by management, the board of directors, and the audit 
committee. The auditor’s understanding of the entity’s period-end financial reporting process 
and how it interrelates with the entity’s other significant processes helps the auditor identify 
and test controls that are most relevant to financial statement risks. For example, sometimes 
entities compile summary information for financial reporting purposes based on detailed 
financial information taken from separate accounting information systems used in different 
parts of the entity. In some cases, entities use dozens or even hundreds of electronic spread­
sheets to summarize and consolidate detailed data into financial statement accounts. Due to 
the nature of spreadsheets, there is a heightened risk that controls over spreadsheets will not 
be effective. The external auditor should determine the risks associated with the entity’s use 
of spreadsheets. Spreadsheets are subject to increased inherent risk (input errors, logic errors, 
interface errors, etc.). The level of control over a spreadsheet should be relative to its use, 
complexity, and required reliability of the information.
Identifying Significant Accounts and Disclosures 
and Their Relevant Assertions
The auditor should identify significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions. 
Relevant assertions are financial statement assertions (see Chapter 5) that have a reasonable 
possibility of containing a misstatement that would cause the financial statements to be mate­
rially misstated. To identify significant accounts and disclosures and their relevant assertions, 
the auditor assesses the following risk factors:
	
∙	 Size and composition of the account.
	
∙	 Susceptibility to misstatement due to errors or fraud.
	
∙	 Volume of activity, complexity, and homogeneity of the individual transactions 
processed through the account or reflected in the disclosure.
	
∙	 Nature of the account or disclosure.
	
∙	 Accounting and reporting complexities associated with the account or disclosure.
	
∙	 Exposure to losses in the account.
	
∙	 Possibility of significant contingent liabilities arising from the activities reflected in 
the account or disclosure.
	
∙	 Existence of related party transactions in the account.
	
∙	 Changes from the prior period in account or disclosure characteristics.
The risk factors that the auditor evaluates for an audit of ICFR are essentially the same as 
those used in the audit of financial statements.
Understanding Likely Sources of Misstatements
To understand the likely sources of potential misstatements, the auditor needs to do the 
following:
	
∙	 Understand the flow of transactions related to the relevant assertions.
	
∙	 Identify the points within the entity’s processes at which a misstatement—including a 
misstatement due to fraud—could arise that would be material.

	
Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
233
	
∙	 Identify the controls that management has implemented to address these potential 
misstatements.
	
∙	 Identify the controls that management has implemented over the prevention or timely 
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that 
could result in a material misstatement of the financial statements.
Performing walkthroughs is often the best way to identify potential sources of misstate­
ments. To perform a walkthrough, the auditor traces a transaction from origination through the 
entity’s processes and information system until it is reflected in the entity’s financial reports.
Stop and Think: How do walkthroughs help the auditor in confirming his or her under­
standing of control design and transaction process flow?
In performing the walkthrough, the auditor should make inquiries of relevant personnel 
involved in significant aspects of the process or controls. The auditor should use probing 
questions to determine entity personnel’s understanding of what is required by the controls 
and determine whether the processing procedures are performed as understood and on a 
timely basis. These questions typically include inquiries on how exceptions are handled, how 
“hand-offs” are properly accomplished between previous and succeeding processes, and who 
performs the control when an employee is sick or absent. These questions help corroborate 
the entity’s design and transaction flow documentation. Walkthrough inquiries should include 
questions designed to identify abuse of controls (i.e., inappropriate management override) or 
indicators of fraud.
Select Controls to Test
The auditor does not need to test all controls—only those controls that are important to the 
auditor’s conclusion about whether the entity’s controls sufficiently address the assessed risk 
of misstatement to each relevant assertion, often referred to as “key” controls. Identifying 
the controls to be tested is a subjective task that requires professional judgment. Table 7–4 
provides a list of factors that the auditor considers when deciding which controls to test. 
The auditor should evaluate whether to test preventive controls, detective controls, or a com­
bination of both. For example, a monthly reconciliation (a detective control) might detect 
an out-of-balance situation resulting from an unauthorized transaction being initiated due to 
an ineffective authorization procedure (a preventive control). When determining whether the 
detective control is effective, the auditor should evaluate whether the detective control is suf­
ficient to achieve the control objective to which the preventive control relates.
The auditor must make decisions similar to management in deciding which locations 
or business units to include for testing based on the presence of entity-level controls and the 
financial reporting risk at each individual location or business unit.
Factors to Consider When Identifying Controls to Test
 • Points at which errors or fraud could occur.
 • The nature of the controls implemented by management.
 • The significance of each control in achieving the objectives of the control criteria and whether more than one con­
trol achieves a particular objective or whether more than one control is necessary to achieve a particular objective.
 • The risk that the controls might not be operating effectively. Factors that affect whether the control might not be 
operating effectively include the following:
		 –  Whether there have been changes in the volume or nature of transactions that might adversely affect control 
design or operating effectiveness;
		 –  Whether there have been changes in the design of controls;
		 –  The degree to which the control relies on the effectiveness of other controls (e.g., the control environment or IT 
general controls);
		 –  Whether there have been changes in key personnel who perform the control or monitor its performance;
		 –  Whether the control relies on performance by an individual or is automated; and
		 –  The complexity of the control.

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Evaluate the Design and Test the Operating  
Effectiveness of Controls
Evaluating Design Effectiveness of Controls
Controls are effectively designed when they prevent or detect errors or fraud that could result 
in material misstatements in the financial statements. Once key controls are identified, the 
auditor evaluates design effectiveness through inquiry, observation, walkthroughs, inspection 
of relevant documentation, and subjective evaluations of whether the controls are likely to 
prevent or detect errors or fraud that could result in misstatements assuming they are oper­
ated as prescribed by qualified persons. The procedures performed by the auditor to test and 
evaluate design effectiveness might in some cases also provide some evidence about operat­
ing effectiveness.
Testing and Evaluating Operating Effectiveness of Controls
An auditor evaluates the operating effectiveness of a control by determining whether the con­
trol is operating as designed and whether the person performing the control possesses the nec­
essary authority and competence to perform the control effectively. In testing the operating 
effectiveness of controls, the auditor needs to consider the scope (nature, timing, and extent) 
of testing. For each control selected for testing, the evidence necessary to persuade the auditor 
that the control is effective depends on the risk that a material weakness would result. As the 
risk associated with the control being tested increases, the quality and/or quantity of the evi­
dence that the auditor should obtain also increases. Table 7–5 presents the factors that affect 
the risk associated with a control.
Nature of Testing  Tests of controls for operating effectiveness include such procedures 
as inquiry of appropriate personnel, inspection of relevant documentation, observation of the 
entity’s operations, and reperformance of the application of the control. In many instances, a 
combination of these procedures is necessary to ensure that a control is operating effectively.
Inquiry is used extensively throughout the audit of internal control. Because inquiry 
alone does not provide sufficient evidence to support the operating effectiveness of a control, 
the auditor should perform additional tests of controls.
Stop and Think: Suppose an entity implements a control whereby its sales manager 
reviews and investigates a report listing sales invoices with unusually high or low gross 
margins. Would inquiry of the sales manager as to whether he or she investigates dis­
crepancies be sufficient evidence to ensure that the control is working effectively?
LO 7-9
Factors That Affect the Risk Associated with a Control
 • The nature and materiality of misstatements that the control is intended to prevent or detect.
 • The inherent risk associated with the related account(s) and assertion(s).
 • Whether there have been changes in the volume or nature of transactions that might adversely affect control 
design or operating effectiveness.
 • Whether the account has a history of errors.
 • The effectiveness of entity-level controls, especially controls that monitor other controls.
 • The nature of the control and the frequency with which it operates.
 • The degree to which the control relies on the effectiveness of other controls.
 • The competence of the personnel who perform the control or monitor its performance and whether there have 
been changes in key personnel who perform the control or monitor its performance.
 • Whether the control relies on performance by an individual or is automated.
 • The complexity of the control and the significance of the judgments that must be made in connection with its 
operation.

Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
235
No. The auditor should corroborate the sales manager’s responses by performing other 
procedures, such as inspecting reports generated by the performance of the control and evalu­
ating whether appropriate actions were taken.
The type of control often affects the nature of control testing the auditor can perform. For 
example, an entity may have a control that requires a signature (manual or digital) on a voucher 
package to indicate that the signer approved it. However, the presence of a signature does not 
necessarily mean that the person carefully reviewed the package before signing. As a result, the 
quality of the evidence regarding the effective operation of the control might not be sufficiently 
persuasive. In order to gain more persuasive evidence, the auditor could reperform the control 
by checking the voucher package for accuracy and completeness, essentially repeating the steps 
taken to initially perform the control. The auditor might also inquire of the person responsible 
for approving voucher packages regarding what he or she looks for when approving packages 
and ask to see documentation of the errors that have been found and rectified in the recent past.
Timing of Tests of Controls  The auditor must perform tests of controls over a period of 
time that is adequate to determine whether the significant controls were operating effectively 
as of the date indicated in management’s report. The period of time over which the auditor 
performs tests of controls will vary with the nature of the controls and the frequency with 
which they are applied. Some controls operate continuously (e.g., controls over the processing 
of routine sales transactions), while other controls operate only occasionally (e.g., monthly 
bank reconciliations). Routine transactions typically involve routine processing controls, such 
as verification of data entry, edit checks and validation controls, completeness controls, and so 
forth. For nonroutine transactions, especially those involving estimation, review and approval 
controls are usually considered more critical. In some cases, controls may operate after the 
“as of” date specified in management’s report. For example, controls over a December 31 
period-end financial reporting process normally operate in January of the following year.
In many instances, the auditor obtains evidence about the operating effectiveness of con­
trols at an interim date for reporting on internal control even though the auditor’s report on 
the effectiveness of internal control is for an “as of” date. For example, the auditor might test 
controls over the revenue process for the first nine months of the year. The auditor will then 
need to determine what additional evidence is needed concerning the operating effectiveness 
of the controls for the remaining three-month period. In deciding what additional evidence 
is needed, the auditor considers the specific controls tested prior to the “as of” date and the 
results of those tests, the sufficiency of the evidence of effectiveness obtained, the length of 
the remaining period, and the possibility that there have been significant changes in internal 
control subsequent to the interim date. For controls over significant nonroutine transactions, 
controls over accounts or processes with a high degree of subjectivity or judgment in mea­
surement, or controls over the recording of period-end adjustments, the auditor should per­
form tests closer to the “as of” date.
If management implements changes to the entity’s controls to make them more effective 
or efficient prior to the date specified in management’s report, the auditor might not need to 
evaluate the superseded controls for purposes of the audit of ICFR.
Extent of Tests of Controls  AS5 does not provide any detailed guidance on what consti­
tutes a sufficient sample for testing the operating effectiveness of the control. This is left to 
the auditor as a matter of professional judgment.
The auditor should consider the following factors when deciding on the extent of testing:
	
∙	 Nature of the control. Manual controls should be subjected to more extensive 
testing than automated controls in view of the greater variability inherent in controls 
involving people.
	
∙	 Frequency of operation. Generally, the more frequently a manual control operates, the 
greater the number of operations of the control the auditor should test.
	
∙	 Importance of the control. The more important the control, the more extensively it 
should be tested.

236	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Most public accounting firms have developed firm-wide guidance for the sample sizes 
used to test for various types of controls. Chapter 8 provides guidance on using statistical and 
nonstatistical sampling for tests of controls.
AS5 provides guidance on incorporating knowledge obtained from prior years’ audits into 
the decision-making process for determining the nature, timing, and extent of testing for the 
current year audit. For example, if the results for testing a particular control were favorable in 
the prior year, and no changes were made to the control, the auditor might assess the risk for 
the control lower and reduce the extent of testing in the current year. If the controls are auto­
mated, the auditor might consider using a benchmarking strategy.2 A benchmarking strategy is 
an approach that allows the auditor to conclude that a previously tested automated control 
continues to be effective based on indicators of whether there has been any change in the 
operation of the control rather than on repeating the full extent of the prior detail-testing work.
Advanced Module 2 offers a brief discussion of computer-assisted audit techniques avail­
able to the auditor in testing the operating effectiveness of controls.

INSIGHT
The PCAOB issued a report about the nature and frequency of deficiencies in firms’ audits of ICFR 
detected during the 2010 inspections of eight domestic registered firms. Some of the deficiencies 
identified include
 • Failure to identify and sufficiently test controls that are intended to address the risks of material 
misstatement.
 • Insufficient tests of the design and operating effectiveness of management review controls that 
are used to monitor the results of operations.
 • Failure to obtain sufficient evidence to update the results of testing of controls from an interim 
date to the entity’s year-end (i.e., the roll-forward period).

Evaluating Identified Control Deficiencies
The auditor is required to evaluate the severity of each control deficiency. The assessment of 
the significance of a control deficiency depends on the potential for a misstatement, not on 
whether a misstatement actually has occurred. As discussed earlier, the severity of a control 
deficiency depends on two factors:
	
∙	 Whether there is a reasonable possibility that the company’s controls will fail to 
prevent or detect a misstatement of an account balance or disclosure (Likelihood).
	
∙	 The magnitude of the potential misstatement resulting from the deficiency or 
deficiencies (Magnitude).
Table 7–6 presents the risk factors that affect whether there is a reasonable possibility that a 
control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, will result in a misstatement of 
an account balance or disclosure.
Factors that affect whether the magnitude of the misstatement might result in a material 
weakness include (1) the financial statement amounts or total of transactions exposed to the 
deficiency and (2) the volume of activity in the account balance or class of transactions exposed 
to the deficiency that has occurred in the current period or that is expected in future periods.
Table 7–7 presents indicators of material weaknesses in ICFR. AS5 (¶70) provides the 
following guidance on assessing the severity of a control deficiency:
When evaluating the severity of a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, the auditor also should 
determine the level of detail and degree of assurance that would satisfy prudent officials in the 
conduct of their own affairs that they have reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as 
necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
LO 7-10

	
Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
237
accounting principles. If the auditor determines that a deficiency, or combination of deficien­
cies, might prevent prudent officials in the conduct of their own affairs from concluding that they 
have reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of 
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, then the auditor 
should treat the deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, as an indicator of a material weakness.
You will note that applying this guidance requires a good deal of judgment on the part of 
the auditor.
Examples of Control Deficiency Evaluation
Exhibit 7–3 presents a detailed example of an auditor’s test of the design and operating effec­
tiveness for a daily IT-dependent manual control. This example explains the nature, timing, 
and extent of procedures and the auditor's conclusion on effectiveness of the control.
These are important and complex concepts—let’s practice. Following are examples of 
control deficiencies that may represent significant deficiencies or material weaknesses. For 
each control deficiency, indicate whether it is a significant deficiency or material weakness. 
Justify your decision.3 After you have tried on your own to assess the scenario, look at the 
solution to see how well you did!
Scenario 1  Murray Company processes a significant number of routine intercompany 
transactions on a monthly basis. Individual intercompany transactions are not material and 
primarily relate to balance sheet activity; for example, cash transfers between business units 
to finance normal operations.
A formal management policy requires monthly reconciliation of intercompany accounts and 
confirmation of balances between business units. However, there is no process in place to ensure 
performance of these procedures. As a result, detailed reconciliations of intercompany accounts 
are not performed on a timely basis. Management does perform monthly procedures to investi­
gate selected large-dollar intercompany account differences. In addition, management prepares a 
detailed monthly variance analysis of operating expenses to assess their reasonableness.
3See the Willis & Adams Policy Statement on Evaluating Control Deficiencies (located in Connect) for more detailed 
guidance on evaluating deficiencies.
Risk Factors That Affect the Likelihood That a Control Deficiency Will Result 
in a Misstatement of an Account Balance or Disclosure
 • The nature of the financial statement accounts, disclosures, and assertions involved.
 • The susceptibility of the related asset or liability to loss or fraud.
 • The subjectivity, complexity, or extent of judgment required to determine the amount involved.
 • The interaction or relationship of the control with other controls, including whether they are interdependent or 
redundant.
 • The interaction of the deficiencies.
 • The possible future consequences of the deficiency.

Indicators of Material Weaknesses
 • Identification of fraud, whether or not material, committed by senior management.
 • Restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of a material misstatement.
 • Identification by the auditor of a material misstatement of financial statements in the current period in circum­
stances that indicate that the misstatement would not have been detected by the entity’s ICFR.
 • Ineffective oversight of the entity’s external financial reporting and ICFR by the entity’s audit committee.

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
An Example of an Auditor’s Tests of a Daily Information 
Technology–Dependent Manual Control
E X H I B I T  7 – 3
Bill Boyd is manager for Emets & Shinn, the independent registered public accounting firm for Petheridge Packing Company (PPC). Based 
on discussions with PPC personnel and review of entity documentation, the auditor learns that PPC had the following procedures in place 
over the entire period to account for cash received in the bank lockbox:
 • The entity receives from the bank an electronic file listing cash received from customers.
 • The IT system applies cash received in the lockbox to individual customer accounts.
 • Any cash received in the lockbox and not applied to a customer’s account is listed on an exception report called the “unapplied cash 
exception report.”
The application of cash to a customer’s account is a programmed application control, while the review and follow-up of unapplied cash 
from the exception report is a manual control.
Boyd wants to determine whether misstatements in cash (primarily relating to the existence assertion) and accounts receivable (exis­
tence, valuation, and completeness) would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In order to test these objectives, Boyd decides to 
test the manual control.
Nature, Timing, and Extent of Procedures
Objective of Test  To determine whether there is a listing of nonmatching cash items on the exception report.
Boyd decides to perform the following tests of controls to ensure the operating effectiveness of the control for the review and follow-
up on the daily unapplied cash exception report.
	
1.	 Inquired of entity personnel about the procedures in place to ensure that all unapplied items are resolved, the time frame in which 
such resolution takes place, and whether unapplied items are handled properly within the system.
	
	 Findings: Boyd discussed these matters with the employee responsible for reviewing and resolving the daily unapplied cash excep­
tion reports. Boyd learned that items appearing on the daily unapplied cash exception report must be manually entered into the 
system. The employee typically performs the resolution procedures the next business day. In most cases, items that appear on 
the daily unapplied cash exception report relate to payments made by a customer who failed to reference an invoice number or 
purchase order number, or to underpayments of an invoice due to quantity or pricing discrepancies.
	
2.	 Reperformed the control.
	
	 Findings: Boyd selected 25 daily unapplied cash exception reports from the period January to September and reperformed the 
follow-up procedures that the employee performed. Boyd inspected the documents and sources of information used in the follow-
up and determined that the transaction was properly corrected in the system. He also scanned other daily unapplied cash excep­
tion reports to determine that the control was performed throughout the period of intended reliance.
	
3.	 Follow-up tests: Because the tests were performed at an interim date, Boyd asked entity personnel about the procedures in place 
at year-end. The procedures had not changed from the interim period; therefore, Boyd observed that the controls were still in place 
by scanning daily unapplied cash exception reports to determine the control was performed on a timely basis during the period 
from September to year-end. No exceptions were noted.
Based on the audit procedures, Boyd concluded that the employee was clearing exceptions in a timely manner and that the control was 
operating effectively as of year-end.
Scenario 2  Ragunandan Company processes a significant number of intercompany trans­
actions on a monthly basis. Intercompany transactions relate to a wide range of activities, 
including transfers of inventory with intercompany profit between business units, allocation 
of research and development costs to business units, and corporate charges. Individual inter­
company transactions are frequently material.
A formal management policy requires monthly reconciliation of intercompany accounts 
and confirmation of balances between business units. However, there is no process in place to 
ensure that these procedures are performed on a consistent basis. As a result, reconciliations 
of intercompany accounts are not performed on a timely basis, and differences in intercom­
pany accounts are frequent and significant. Management does not perform any alternative 
controls to investigate significant intercompany account differences.
Solution: Scenario 1  Based only on these facts, the auditor should determine that this 
control deficiency represents a significant deficiency. The magnitude of a financial statement 
misstatement resulting from this deficiency would reasonably be expected to be significant, 
though not material because individual intercompany transactions are not material, and the 
compensating controls operating monthly should detect a material misstatement. However, 

	
Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
239
the compensating detective controls are designed only to detect material misstatements. The 
controls do not address the detection of misstatements that are significant but not material. 
Furthermore, the transactions are primarily restricted to balance sheet accounts. Therefore, it 
is reasonably possible that a misstatement could occur.
Solution: Scenario 2  Based only on these facts, the auditor should determine that this 
deficiency represents a material weakness. The magnitude of a financial statement misstate­
ment resulting from this deficiency would reasonably be expected to be material, because 
individual intercompany transactions are frequently material and relate to a wide range of 
activities. Additionally, actual unreconciled differences in intercompany accounts have been, 
and are, material. The likelihood of such a misstatement is reasonably possible because such 
misstatements have frequently occurred and compensating controls are not effective, either 
because they are not properly designed or because they are not operating effectively. Taken 
together, the magnitude and likelihood of misstatement of the financial statements resulting 
from this internal control deficiency meet the definition of a material weakness.
Remediation of a Material Weakness
When an entity determines that it has a material weakness, it should take steps to correct it. 
This is referred to as remediation. If the material weakness cannot be corrected and/or prop­
erly tested before the “as of” date, management and the auditor should each issue a report that 
the ICFR is not operating effectively. If management corrects a material weakness before the 
“as of” date, there must be sufficient time for both management and the auditor to adequately 
test the operating effectiveness of the control. If there is not sufficient time, then neither 
management nor the auditor can conclude that ICFR is effective. If there is sufficient time to 
remediate the material weakness and test the operating effectiveness of the remediated con­
trol, the testing shows that the new control is operating effectively, management and the audi­
tor can issue a report that ICFR is operating effectively. See the last paragraph of Exhibit 7–2 
to see how Groupon reported the remediation of its material weaknesses.
Written Representations
In addition to the management representations obtained as part of a financial statement audit 
(see Chapter 17), the auditor obtains written representations from management related to the 
audit of ICFR. Table 7–8 presents a typical set of management representations made to the 
auditor related to the audit of internal control. Failure to obtain written representations from 
management, including management’s refusal to furnish them, constitutes a limitation on the 
LO 7-11
LO 7-12
Written Representations Made by Management to the Auditor
 • Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective ICFR.
 • Management has performed an evaluation and made an assessment of the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR and 
specifying the control criteria.
 • Management did not rely on work performed by the auditor in forming its assessment of the effectiveness of ICFR.
 • Management’s conclusion about the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR based on the control criteria as of a specified date.
 • Management has disclosed to the auditor all deficiencies in the design or operation of ICFR identified as part of 
management’s evaluation and has identified all such deficiencies that it believes to be significant deficiencies or 
material weaknesses.
 • Descriptions of any material fraud and any other fraud that, although not material, involves senior management or 
management or other employees who have a significant role in the entity’s ICFR.
 • Control deficiencies identified and communicated to the audit committee during previous engagements have (or 
have not) been resolved (and specifically identifying any that have not).
 • Descriptions of any changes in ICFR or other factors that might significantly affect ICFR, including any corrective 
actions taken by management with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses.

scope of the audit sufficient to preclude an unqualified opinion on ICFR. While the required 
representations are typically drafted by the auditor, they are addressed to the auditor and are 
signed (and worded as if written) by the CEO and CFO.
Auditor Documentation Requirements
The auditor should document the processes, procedures, judgments, and results relating to the 
audit of internal control consistent with the PCAOB's documentation standards. The auditor’s 
documentation must include the auditor’s understanding and evaluation of the design of each 
of the components of the entity’s ICFR, documentation of the process used to determine the 
points at which misstatements could occur within significant accounts and disclosures, the 
extent to which he or she relied on work performed by others, and the scope of testing. Finally, 
the auditor must describe the evaluation of any deficiencies discovered, as well as any other 
findings, that could result in a modification to the auditor’s report.
Auditor Reporting on ICFR
After auditing the effectiveness of an entity’s internal control, an auditor issues an unquali­
fied opinion if the entity’s internal control is designed and operating effectively in all mate­
rial respects. Significant deficiencies do not require a departure from an unqualified opinion 
because, though they are deemed to be significant enough to be brought to the attention of the 
audit committee, they relate to possible financial statement misstatements that are less than 
material. Figure 7–1 shows the auditor’s reporting responsibilities for deficiencies, significant 
deficiencies, and material weaknesses. Figure 7–4 gives an overview of the types of audit 
reports relating to the effectiveness of ICFR. If the scope of the auditor’s work is limited, a 
disclaimer of opinion is issued on the effectiveness of ICFR. If one or more unremediated 
material weaknesses is identified, the auditor issues an adverse opinion.

Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
241
Elements of the Auditor’s Report
The auditor’s report on the effectiveness of internal control has a number of required ele­
ments. The report identifies management’s conclusion about the effectiveness of the enti­
ty’s ICFR and states that the assessment on which management’s conclusion is based is the 
responsibility of management. The report defines ICFR and indicates that the standards of 
the PCAOB require that the auditor plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur­
ance about whether effective ICFR was maintained in all material respects. The report goes 
on to explain in general terms what an audit of ICFR entails and explicitly addresses the fact 
that even effective internal control cannot guarantee that misstatements will be prevented, or 
detected and corrected. Finally, the report concludes with the auditor’s opinion on whether 
the company maintained, in all material respects, effective ICFR as of the end of the period.
The auditor may choose to issue separate reports on the entity’s financial statements and 
ICFR or may issue a combined report. Under either approach, the date of the two reports 
should be the same. The following sections explain the unqualified report, the adverse report 
for material weaknesses, and the disclaimer of opinion for a scope limitation.
Unqualified Report
An unqualified opinion regarding the effectiveness of the entity’s ICFR provides reason­
able assurance that the entity’s controls are designed and operating effectively in all mate­
rial respects as of the balance sheet date. The phrase “all material respects” means that the 
entity’s ICFR is free of any material weakness. Exhibit 7–4 presents an example of an audi­
tor’s unqualified report that is presented separately from the auditor’s report on the financial 
statements for EarthWear Clothiers. Note that the report includes an explanatory paragraph 
referring to the financial statement audit report. Exhibit 1–1 in Chapter 1 presents a separate 
report on the financial statement audit for EarthWear Clothiers. Note that the last paragraph 
of that report refers to the audit of ICFR and indicates that an unqualified opinion was issued 
with respect to the effectiveness of internal control.
Exhibit 7–5 presents an example of a combined report for EarthWear Clothiers that gives 
an unqualified opinion on both the financial statement audit and the audit of ICFR. When the 
auditor elects to issue a combined report, the report may address multiple reporting periods 
for the financial statements presented but will address only the end of the most recent fiscal 
year for the effectiveness of internal control.
Adverse Report for a Material Weakness
The presence of a material weakness at the end of the period necessitates an adverse assess­
ment by management and an adverse opinion by the auditor. An adverse report includes the 
definition of a material weakness and a description of the particular material weakness iden­
tified in the entity’s system of internal control, along with the auditor’s opinion that the entity 
has not maintained effective ICFR as of the report date. See Exhibit 7–6 for an example of an 
adverse report.
It is possible for the auditor to issue an adverse opinion on internal control while at the 
same time issuing an unqualified opinion on the financial statement audit. Such a conclusion 
is reached when an entity’s internal control is not effective at preventing or detecting material 
errors, but the auditor concludes (based on substantive procedures) that the entity’s finan­
cial statements do not contain material misstatements. Such circumstances can arise when 
an identified material weakness does not actually result in a misstatement in the financial 
statements or when a material weakness does result in a material misstatement but the entity 
corrects the misstatement prior to issuing the financial statements.
Disclosure is also important when the auditor’s opinion on the financial statements is 
affected by the adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal control. In such a circum­
stance, the report on ICFR (or the combined report) should similarly indicate that the mate­
rial weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of procedures 
performed as part of the financial statement audit. Such disclosure is important to ensure that

An Example of a Separate Report Giving an Unqualified 
Opinion on the Effectiveness of ICFR
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
[Introductory Paragraph]
We have audited EarthWear Clothiers’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in 
Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 
EarthWear Clothiers’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of 
the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control 
over financial reporting based on our audit.
[Scope Paragraph]
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those stan­
dards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial 
reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial report­
ing, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consid­
ered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
[Definition Paragraph]
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance 
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) pro­
vide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with 
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detec­
tion of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
[Inherent Limitations Paragraph]
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in condi­
tions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
[Opinion Paragraph]
In our opinion, EarthWear Clothiers maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 
31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations 
of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
[Explanatory Paragraph]
We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consoli­
dated financial statements of EarthWear Clothiers, and our report dated February 15, 2016, expressed an unqualified opinion.

users of the auditor’s report on the financial statements understand why the auditor issued an 
unqualified opinion on those statements.
Disclaimer for Scope Limitation
The auditor can express an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of ICFR only if the audi­
tor has been able to apply all the procedures necessary in the circumstances. If the scope of 
the auditor’s work is limited because of circumstances beyond the control of management or 
the auditor, the auditor should disclaim an opinion or withdraw from the engagement. The 
auditor’s decision depends on an assessment of the importance of the omitted procedure(s) to 
his or her ability to form an opinion.

INSIGHT
In 2004, the first year of compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, auditors reported 
some 629 material weaknesses (15.9 percent). According to Audit Analytics, that figure has declined 
every year since, and only 141 were reported in 2011. One SEC official has questioned the low level 
of reported material weaknesses.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of EarthWear Clothiers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements 
of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 
31, 2015. We also have audited EarthWear Clothiers’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria 
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO). EarthWear Clothiers’ management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over 
financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying 
Management Report on the Financial Statements and Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial state­
ments and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
[Scope paragraph]
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those 
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit 
of financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial 
reporting, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we 
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
[Definition paragraph]
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of

[Opinion paragraph]
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of EarthWear Cloth­
iers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period 
ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opin­
ion, EarthWear Clothiers maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the

Other Reporting Issues
Management’s Report Incomplete or Improperly Presented
If the auditor determines that elements of management’s annual report on ICFR are incom­
plete or improperly presented, the auditor should modify his or her report to include an 
explanatory paragraph describing the reasons for this determination.
The Auditor Decides to Refer to the Report of Other Auditors
As discussed in Chapter 18 in connection with the financial statement audit, on some engage­
ments, parts of the audit may be completed by another public accounting firm. In such cir­
cumstances, the auditor must decide whether to refer to work performed by the other auditor. 
The decision is based on factors similar to those considered by the auditor who uses the work 
and reports of other independent auditors when reporting on a company’s financial state­
ments. If the auditor decides to make reference to the report of the other auditor as a basis, 
in part, for his or her opinion, the auditor should refer to the report of the other auditor in 
describing the scope of the audit and in expressing the opinion.
Practice 
INSIGHT
In the first several years of Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, approximately 75 percent of the material 
weaknesses reported were identified when the auditor discovered a material misstatement while 
conducting substantive audit procedures. When a material misstatement is discovered, the auditor 
does a “root cause analysis” to find out why the entity’s internal control over financial reporting failed 
to prevent or detect the misstatement. Such an analysis usually leads to the identification of a mate­
rial weakness.
An Example of an Adverse Opinion on the Effectiveness of ICFR 
Because of the Existence of a Material Weakness
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
 [Standard Wording for the Introductory, Scope, Definition, and Inherent Limitations Paragraphs]
 [Explanatory Paragraph]
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a rea­
sonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. Treadron Company had 
an inadequate system for recording cash receipts, which could have prevented the Company from recording cash receipts on accounts 
receivable completely and properly. Therefore, cash received could have been diverted for unauthorized use, lost, or otherwise not prop­
erly recorded to accounts receivable. This material weakness was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests 
applied in our audit of the 2015 financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 15, 2016, on those financial 
statements.
[Opinion Paragraph]
In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, 
Treadron Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria estab­
lished in Internal Control—Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 
(COSO).

Subsequent Events
The auditor has a responsibility to report on any changes in internal control that might affect 
financial reporting between the end of the reporting period and the date of the auditor’s report. 
Chapter 17 describes the types of procedures the auditor undertakes to search for subsequent 
events affecting an entity’s financial statements and affecting the entity’s ICFR. As noted 
in Chapter 17, the auditor’s treatment of a subsequent event depends on whether the event 
reveals information about a material weakness that existed as of the end of the reporting 
period or whether the event creates or reveals information about a new condition that did not 
exist as of the end of the reporting period.
Management’s Report Contains Additional Information
Management may include additional information in its report on ICFR. For example, manage­
ment may include disclosures about corrective actions taken by the entity after the date of 
management’s assessment, the entity’s plans to implement new controls, or a statement that 
management believes the cost of correcting a material weakness would exceed the benefits to 
be derived from implementing new controls. The auditor should disclaim an opinion on such 
information and include the following language as the last paragraph of the report:
We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on management’s statement referring 
to the costs and related benefits of implementing new controls.
If the auditor believes that the additional information contains a material misstatement 
of fact, he or she should discuss the matter with management. If the auditor concludes that a 
material misstatement of fact remains after discussing it with management, he or she should 
notify the audit committee in writing. The auditor also should consider consulting the audi­
tor’s legal counsel about further actions to be taken, including the auditor’s responsibility 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (AS5, ¶C14).
Reporting on a Remediated Material Weakness 
at an Interim Date
If management remediates a material weakness after the “as of ” date, the auditor can provide 
an interim opinion rather than making the entity wait 12 months to receive a clean opinion 
regarding its ICFR in the next year-end report. Thus, the auditor can attest on a timely basis as 
to whether an entity has eliminated the cause of a previously issued adverse opinion regarding 
its ICFR.
Additional Required Communications  
in an Audit of ICFR
The auditor has a number of communication responsibilities under AS5. As shown in 
­Figure 7–1, the auditor must communicate in writing to management and the audit com­
mittee all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses identified during the audit. The 
written communication should be made prior to the issuance of the auditor’s report on ICFR. 
The auditor’s communication should distinguish clearly between those matters considered to 
be significant deficiencies and those considered to be material weaknesses. If a significant 
deficiency or material weakness exists because the oversight by the entity’s audit committee 
is ineffective, the auditor must communicate that specific significant deficiency or material 
weakness in writing to the board of directors.
In addition, the auditor should communicate to management, in writing, all control defi­
ciencies (deficiencies in internal control that are not material or significant) identified during the 
audit and inform the audit committee when such a communication has been made. Keep in mind 
that the auditor’s role is to identify material weaknesses. The auditor is not required to perform 
procedures to identify control deficiencies that do not rise to the level of a material weakness.
LO 7-15

246	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
The auditor’s written communication about control deficiencies states that the communi­
cation is intended solely for the information and use of the board of directors, audit commit­
tee, management, and others within the organization. When governmental authorities require 
the entity to furnish such a report, a specific reference to such regulatory agencies may be 
made in the report. These written communications also include the definitions of control defi­
ciencies, significant deficiencies, and material weaknesses and clearly identify the types of 
deficiencies being communicated. The auditor’s communication may indicate that no mate­
rial weaknesses were identified if none were found. However, because the auditor’s proce­
dures were geared toward detecting material weaknesses, the auditor may not represent that 
no significant deficiencies were noted during an audit of internal control.
When auditing ICFR, the auditor may become aware of fraud or other possible illegal 
acts. If the matter involves fraud, it must be brought to the attention of the appropriate level 
of management. If the fraud involves senior management, the auditor must communicate the 
matter directly to the audit committee. If the matter involves other possible illegal acts, the 
auditor must be assured that the audit committee is adequately informed, unless the matter is 
clearly inconsequential. When timely communication is important, the auditor communicates 
such matters during the course of the audit rather than at the end of the engagement.
Advanced Module 1: Special Considerations for an Audit of 
Internal Control 
The PCAOB specifies two areas that require special consideration by management and the 
auditor during an audit of ICFR:
	
∙	 Service organizations.
	
∙	 Safeguarding assets.
Use of Service Organizations
Many companies use service organizations to process transactions. If the service organiza­
tion’s services make up part of an entity’s information system, then they are considered part of 
the information and communication component of the entity’s ICFR. Thus, both management 
and the auditor must consider the activities of the service organization.
Management and the auditor should perform the following procedures with respect to 
the activities performed by the service organization: (1) obtain an understanding of the nature 
and significance of the services provided by the service organization and their effect on the 
user entity’s internal control relevant to the audit, sufficient to identify and assess the risks of 
material misstatement and (2) design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks.
Evidence about the operating effectiveness of controls that are relevant to management’s 
assessment and the auditor’s opinion may be obtained by performing tests of the user orga­
nization’s controls over the activities of the service organization, performing tests of con­
trols at the service organization, or obtaining a service auditor’s report on the design and 
operating effectiveness of controls placed in operation at the service organization (referred 
to as a Service Organization Control 1 “Type 2” report discussed in Chapter 6). If a service 
auditor’s report on controls placed in operation and tests of operating effectiveness is avail­
able, management and the auditor separately evaluate whether this report provides sufficient 
evidence to support the assessment and opinion. Important factors that management and the 
auditor should consider include the scope of the examination, the controls tested, the results 
of those tests of controls, and the service auditor’s opinion on the operating effectiveness of 
the controls. Management and the auditor should also make inquiries concerning the service 
auditor’s reputation, competence, and independence.
When a significant period of time has elapsed between the time period covered by the 
tests of controls in the service auditor’s report and the date of management’s assessment, 
additional procedures should be performed.
LO 7-16

	
Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
247
If the auditor concludes that additional evidence about the operating effectiveness of 
controls at the service organization is required, the auditor should perform additional proce­
dures. For example, the auditor might investigate whether management has taken actions to 
monitor or evaluate the quality of the service provider and evaluate the results of such actions. 
The auditor might also contact the service organization to obtain specific information, or 
request that a service auditor be engaged to perform procedures that will supply the necessary 
information. Finally, the auditor might even visit the service organization and perform such 
procedures firsthand. Based on the evidence obtained, management and the auditor should 
determine whether they have obtained sufficient evidence to obtain the reasonable assurance 
necessary for their assessment and opinion, respectively.
Safeguarding of Assets
Safeguarding of assets is defined in AS5 as policies and procedures that “provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or dispo­
sition of the entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.” This 
definition is consistent with the definition in the COSO Framework. For example, an entity 
could have safeguarding controls over inventory tags (preventive controls) and perform timely 
periodic physical inventory counts (detective control) for its quarterly and annual financial 
reporting dates. Given that the definitions of material weakness and significant deficiency 
relate to the likelihood of misstatement of the financial statements, the failure of the inven­
tory tag control will not result in a significant deficiency or material weakness if the physical 
inventory count prevents a misstatement of the financial statements. Therefore, the COSO 
definition indicates that although losses might occur, controls over financial reporting are 
effective if they provide reasonable assurance that those losses are properly reflected in the 
financial statements.
Advanced Module 2: Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques 
Major accounting firms have IT specialists who often use computer-assisted audit techniques 
(CAATs) to assist the auditor in testing application controls, transactions, and account bal­
ances. Many of these controls are embedded into the entity’s computer programs and can 
thus be tested via CAATs. Additionally, the auditor may also gain great efficiencies by using 
CAATs to execute substantive procedures when the information is maintained in machine-
readable form. The following types of CAATs are discussed:
	
∙	 Generalized audit software.
	
∙	 Custom audit software.
	
∙	 Test data.
Other techniques are discussed in advanced IT auditing books.4
Generalized Audit Software
Generalized audit software (GAS) includes programs that allow the auditor to perform tests 
on computer files and databases. IDEA is an example of a GAS program that is widely used in 
practice. GAS was developed so that auditors would be able to conduct similar CAATs in dif­
ferent IT environments. For example, GAS permits an auditor to select and prepare accounts 
receivable confirmations from a variety of computer systems. This type of software provides 
a high-level computer language that allows the auditor to easily perform various functions 
on an entity’s computer files and databases. A sample of functions that can be performed by 
GAS is shown in Table 7–9.
LO 7-17
LO 7-18

Press, 2012).

248	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
GAS offers several advantages: (1) it is easy to use; (2) limited IT expertise or program­
ming skills are required; (3) the time required to develop the application is usually short; 
and (4) an entire population can be examined, eliminating the need for sampling in some 
instances. Among the disadvantages of GAS are that (1) it involves auditing after the entity 
has processed the data rather than while the data are being processed, (2) it provides a limited 
ability to verify programming logic because its application is usually directed to testing entity 
files or databases, and (3) it is limited to audit procedures that can be conducted on data avail­
able in electronic form. Your instructor may assign you to use IDEA to work some problems 
during your study of this text. Becoming familiar with IDEA is a great opportunity to get a 
head start on others entering the profession because it is a widely used and very useful tool.
Custom Audit Software
Custom audit software is generally written by auditors for specific audit tasks. Such programs 
are necessary when the entity’s computer system is not compatible with the auditor’s GAS or 
when the auditor wants to conduct some testing that may not be possible with the GAS. It may 
also be more efficient to prepare custom programs if they will be used in future audits of the 
entity or if they may be used on similar engagements. The major disadvantages of custom soft­
ware are that (1) it is expensive to develop, (2) it may require a long development time, and (3) 
it may require extensive modification if the entity changes its accounting application programs.
Practice 
INSIGHT
When using IDEA or any other auditing tool, remember to examine the underlying source docu­
ments. According to the PCAOB, one firm used a computer-assisted auditing procedure to identify 
potentially fraudulent journal entries, but the firm failed to examine the underlying documentation to 
determine whether any of the journal entries were in fact fraudulent (PCAOB Release 104-2005-120).
Functions Performed by Generalized Audit Software
Function
Description
File or database access
Reads and extracts data from an entity’s computer files or databases for further 
audit testing.
Selection operators
Select from files or databases transactions that meet certain criteria.
Arithmetic functions
Perform a variety of arithmetic calculations (addition, subtraction, and so on) on 
transactions, files, and databases.
Statistical analyses
Provide functions supporting various types of audit sampling.
Report generation
Prepares various types of documents and reports.
T A B L E  7 – 9
Inventory observation and testing provide a good example of where such a program 
might be useful. Suppose an entity maintains computerized perpetual inventory records that 
are updated by the sales and purchasing systems. Further assume that the entity conducts a 
physical inventory count once a year, at which time the perpetual records are corrected. At 
the time of the physical inventory count, the entity’s employees record the physical counts 
on special computer forms that are optically scanned to create a physical inventory file. The 
quantities on hand are priced using an approved price file. What results from this analysis is 
the inventory balance used for updating the perpetual records and the financial statements.
The auditors who observe the entity’s physical inventory count record the results on special 
computer forms that are optically scanned and used as input to the custom program. The cus­
tom program performs the following audit procedures: (1) traces the test counts into the entity’s 
perpetual inventory file and prints out any exceptions; (2) performs a complete mathematical 
test, including extensions, footings, crossfootings, and use of approved prices; (3) summarizes 
the inventory by type; and (4) prints out items in excess of a predetermined amount for review.

KEY TERMS
Computer-assisted audit techniques (CAATs). Computer programs that allow auditors to 
test computer files and databases.
Control deficiency. A weakness in the design or operation of a control such that management 
or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, fail to prevent or 
detect misstatements on a timely basis.
Entity-level controls. Controls that have a pervasive effect on the entity’s system of inter­
nal control such as controls related to the control environment; controls over management 
override; the entity’s risk assessment process; centralized processing and controls, including 
shared service environments; controls to monitor results of operations; controls to monitor 
other controls, including activities of the internal audit function, the audit committee, and 
self-assessment programs; controls over the period-end financial reporting process; and poli­
cies that address significant business control and risk management practices.
Internal control over financial reporting. A process designed by, or under the supervision 
of, the entity’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing 
similar functions, and effected by the entity’s board of directors, management, and other per­
sonnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.
Material weakness. A deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in ICFR, such that there 
is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the entity’s annual or interim finan­
cial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Relevant assertion. A financial statement assertion that has a reasonable possibility of con­
taining a misstatement or misstatements that would cause the financial statements to be mate­
rially misstated.
Remediation. The process of correcting a material weakness as part of management’s assess­
ment of the effectiveness of ICFR.
	
Chapter 7    Auditing Internal Control over Financial Reporting	
249
Test Data
The auditor uses test data for testing the application controls in the entity’s computer pro­
grams. In using this method, the auditor first creates a set of simulated data (that is, test data) 
for processing. The data should include both valid and invalid data. After calculating the 
expected results of processing the test data, the auditor uses the entity’s computer and appli­
cation programs to process the data. The valid data should be properly processed, while the 
invalid data should be identified as errors. The results of this processing are compared to the 
auditor’s predetermined results. This technique can be used to check
	
∙	 Data validation controls and error detection routines.
	
∙	 Processing-logic controls.
	
∙	 Arithmetic calculations.
	
∙	 The inclusion of transactions in records, files, and reports.
The objective of using the test data method is to ensure the accuracy of the computer 
processing of transactions.
The main advantage of the test data method is that it provides direct evidence on the 
effectiveness of the controls included in the entity’s application programs. However, the test 
data method has a number of potential disadvantages. First, it can be very time-consuming to 
create the test data. Second, the auditor may not be certain that all relevant conditions or con­
trols are tested. The use of special computer programs called test data generators may help 
alleviate these potential disadvantages. Third, the auditor must be certain that the test data are 
processed using the entity’s regular production programs. This concern can be alleviated if 
the entity’s general controls for program changes, access, and library functions are reliable. 
Last, the auditor must be sure to remove the valid test data from the entity’s files.

250	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
Safeguarding of assets. Those policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance 
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the 
entity’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Significant account or disclosure. An account or disclosure is significant if there is a reason­
able possibility that the account or disclosure could contain a misstatement that, individually 
or when aggregated with others, has a material effect on the financial statements, considering 
the risks of both overstatement and understatement.
Significant deficiency. A deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in ICFR that is less 
severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible 
for oversight of the entity’s financial reporting.
Walkthrough. A transaction being traced by an auditor from origination through the entity’s 
information system until it is reflected in the entity’s financial reports. It encompasses the 
entire process of initiating, authorizing, recording, processing, and reporting individual trans­
actions and controls for each of the significant processes identified.

7-34	 Following are three examples of controls for accounts that you have determined are 
significant for the audit of ICFR. For each control, determine the nature, timing, 
and extent of testing of the control's design and operating effectiveness. Refer to 
Exhibit 7–3 for an example of how to format your answer.
	
	
	 	
Control 1. Monthly Manual Reconciliation: Through discussions with entity 
personnel and review of entity documentation, you find that entity personnel rec­
oncile the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger to the general ledger on a monthly 
basis. To determine whether misstatements in accounts receivable (existence, valu­
ation, and completeness) would be detected on a timely basis, you decide to test the 
control provided by the monthly reconciliation process.
	
	
	 	
Control 2. Daily Manual Preventive Control: Through discussions with entity 
personnel, you learn that entity personnel make a cash disbursement only after they 
have matched the vendor invoice to the receiving report and purchase order. To deter­
mine whether misstatements in cash (existence) and accounts payable (existence, 
valuation, and completeness) would be prevented on a timely basis, you decide to 
test the control over making a cash disbursement only after matching the invoice 
with the receiving report and purchase order.

Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
	
	
	 	
Control 3. Programmed Preventive Control and Weekly Information 
­Technology–Dependent Manual Detective Control: Through discussions with 
entity personnel, you learn that the entity’s computer system performs a three-way 
match of the receiving report, purchase order, and invoice. If there are any excep-
tions, the system produces a list of unmatched items that employees review and fol-
low up on weekly. The computer match is a programmed application control, and the 
review and follow-up of the unmatched items report is a manual detective control. To 
determine whether misstatements in cash (existence) and accounts payable–inven-
tory (existence, valuation, and completeness) would be prevented or detected on a 
timely basis, you decide to test the programmed application control of matching the 
receiving report, purchase order, and invoice, as well as the review and follow-up 
control over unmatched items.

LO 7-4, 7-6, 7-10	
7-35	 Following are examples of control deficiencies that may represent significant defi-
ciencies or material weaknesses. For each control deficiency, indicate whether it is a 
significant deficiency or material weakness. Justify your decision.
	
a.	 The entity uses a standard sales contract for most transactions. Individual sales 
transactions are not material to the entity. Sales personnel are allowed to mod-
ify sales contract terms. The entity’s accounting function reviews significant or 
unusual modifications to the sales contract terms but does not review changes in 
the standard shipping terms. The changes in the standard shipping terms could 
require a delay in the timing of revenue recognition. Management reviews gross 
margins on a monthly basis and investigates any significant or unusual relation-
ships. In addition, management reviews the reasonableness of inventory levels at 
the end of each accounting period. The entity has experienced limited situations 
in which revenue has been inappropriately recorded in advance of shipment, but 
amounts have not been material.
	
b.	 The entity has a standard sales contract, but sales personnel frequently modify the 
terms of the contract. The nature of the modifications can affect the timing and 
amount of revenue recognized. Individual sales transactions are frequently mate-
rial to the entity, and the gross margin can vary significantly for each transaction. 
The entity does not have procedures in place for the accounting function to regu-
larly review modifications to sales contract terms. Although management reviews 
gross margins on a monthly basis, the significant differences in gross margins 
on individual transactions make it difficult for management to identify potential 
misstatements. Improper revenue recognition has occurred, and the amounts have 
been material.
	
c.	 The entity has a standard sales contract, but sales personnel frequently modify 
the terms of the contract. Sales personnel frequently grant unauthorized and unre-
corded sales discounts to customers without the knowledge of the accounting 
department. These amounts are deducted by customers in paying their invoices 
and are recorded as outstanding balances on the accounts receivable–aging. 
Although these amounts are individually insignificant, when added up they are 
material and have occurred regularly over the past few years.

a.	 During its assessment of ICFR, the management of Lorenz Corporation and its 
auditors identified the following control deficiencies that individually represent 
significant deficiencies:
	
	 ∙  Inadequate segregation of duties over certain information system access controls.
	
	 ∙  Several instances of transactions that were not properly recorded in subsidiary 
ledgers. While the transactions that weren’t recorded properly were not mate­
rial, the gross amount of the transactions of that type totaled up to an amount 
several times materiality.
	
	 ∙  A lack of timely reconciliations of the account balances affected by the improp­
erly recorded transactions.
	
b.	 During its assessment of ICFR, management of First Coast BankCorp and its 
auditors identified the following deficiencies that individually represent signifi­
cant deficiencies: the design of controls over the estimation of credit losses (a 
critical accounting estimate); the operating effectiveness of controls for initiating, 
processing, and reviewing adjustments to the allowance for credit losses; and the 
operating effectiveness of controls designed to prevent and detect the improper 
recognition of interest income. In addition, during the past year, First Coast expe­
rienced a significant level of growth in the loan balances that were subjected to 
the controls governing credit loss estimation and revenue recognition, and further 
growth is expected in the upcoming year.
	
LO 7-4, 7-5, 7-10	
7-37	 For each of the following cases, indicate why management and the auditors deter­
mined that the control deficiency was a material weakness.
	
	
	 	
Case 1: In our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over finan­
cial reporting as of December 31, 2015, we identified a material weakness over the 
accounting for and disclosure of derivatives associated with warrant instruments pri­
marily because we lacked technical expertise and adequate procedures to develop 
and document our common stock warrant analysis on the applicability of ASC 815 
“Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity” to our warrant instru­
ments. Because of the lack of technical expertise and adequate procedures to develop 
and document our analysis of the applicability of ASC 815, which was characterized 
as a material weakness with regard to accounting for warrants, management has con­
cluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of 
December 31, 2015, based on the criteria in Internal Control—Integrated Framework.
	
	
	 	
Case 2: In the course of making our assessment of the effectiveness of internal 
control over financial reporting, we identified a material weakness in our internal 
control over financial reporting. The preparation and review process for the calcula­
tion of the tax provision was inadequate, which led to errors in the computation of 
deferred tax assets and related income tax benefit.
	
	
	 	
Case 3: Management identified a material weakness in First Bank Company’s 
system of internal control over financial reporting with respect to ensuring the 
appropriate calculation of its allowance for loan losses. Specifically, during a pro­
cess enhancement to the model that calculates the allowance for loan losses, the 
quarterly average loss rate was not annualized due to a computational error. Control 
procedures in place for reviewing the quantitative model for calculating the allow­
ance for loan losses did not identify this error in a timely manner, and, as such, the 
Company did not have adequately designed procedures.

monitoring component.
	
e.	 The auditors of Benron identified significant financial statement fraud by the

cate the reason for and the type of audit report you would issue.
	
a.	 During the audit of Wood Pharmaceuticals, you are surprised to find several con­
trol deficiencies in the entity’s internal control. You determine that there is a rea­
sonable possibility that any one of them could result in a misstatement that is 
significant. Although the odds are extremely low that the deficiencies, singly or 
taken together, will result in a material misstatement of the entity’s financial state­
ments, the large number of problems causes you concern. Management’s written 
assessment concludes that the entity’s ICFR was effective as of the report date.
	
b.	 You agreed to perform an audit for Rodriguez & Co., after the entity’s year-end. 
Due to time constraints, your audit firm could not complete a full audit of ICFR. 
However, the evidence you did collect suggests that the entity has exceptionally 
strong ICFR. You seriously doubt that a material weakness would have been 
found if time had permitted a more thorough audit. Management’s written assess­
ment concludes that the entity’s ICFR was effective as of the report date.
	
c.	 George & Diana Company’s internal audit function identified a material weakness 
in the entity’s ICFR. The entity corrected this weakness about four months prior 
to the end of the annual reporting period. Management reassessed controls in the 
area and found them effective. After reevaluating and retesting the relevant con­
trols, you believe the controls to have been effective for a sufficient period of time 
to provide adequate evidence that they were designed and operating effectively 
as of the end of the entity’s reporting period. Management’s written assessment 
concludes that the entity’s internal control was effective as of the report date.
	
d.	 Reynolds’ Distilleries identified what you agree is a material weakness and made 
an adverse assessment in its report on ICFR. The entity had not corrected the 
material weakness as of the end of the reporting period.
	
e.	 Cindy & David Company’s management identified a material weakness in the enti­
ty’s ICFR during its assessment process. The entity corrected this weakness about 
a month prior to the end of the annual reporting period. Management reassessed 
controls in the area and believes they were effective as of the end of the reporting 
period. After reevaluating and retesting the relevant controls, you agree that the 
new controls are well designed, but since the controls over this particular area are 
applied only once at the end of each month (i.e., the controls have only operated 
two times since being corrected), you do not believe you have sufficient audit evi­
dence to assess their operating effectiveness. Management’s written assessment 
concludes that the entity’s internal control was effective as of the report date.
	
f.	 During the audit of ICFR for Big Al & Larry Industries, you discover several con­
trol deficiencies. You determine that there is more than a reasonable possibility 
that any one of them could result in a financial statement misstatement. Although 
you do not believe that any of the deficiencies taken individually will result in 
a material misstatement, you believe there is a moderately low likelihood that, 
taken together, the deficiencies could produce a material misstatement. Manage­
ment’s written assessment concludes that the entity’s internal control was effec­
tive as of the report date.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
[Introductory paragraph]
We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management Report on the Financial Statements and Internal 
Control, that Douglas did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria estab­
lished in Enterprise Risk Management—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (COSO). Douglas’ management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its 
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s 
assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.
[Scope paragraph]
We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards (United States). Those standards require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain assurance about whether effective internal control was maintained. Our audit included obtaining an 
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the operating 
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that 
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
[Definition paragraph]
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide assurance regarding the reliability of financial 
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted auditing principles. A 
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records 
that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide assurance 

258	
Part 3    Understanding and Auditing Internal Control
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and 
directors of the company; and (3) provide assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposi­
tion of the company’s assets that could have an inconsequential effect on the financial statements.
[Inherent limitations paragraph]
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any 
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in condi­
tions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
[Opinion paragraph]
In our opinion, management’s assessment that Douglas maintained ineffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 
2015, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established in Enterprise Risk Management—Integrated Framework issued 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). We therefore express an adverse opinion on man­
agement’s assessment. Also in our opinion, Douglas maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting 
as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Enterprise Risk Management—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee 
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), except for one material weakness, which results in our issuing a quali­
fied opinion on Douglas’ internal control over financial reporting.
[Explanatory paragraph]
We have also audited, in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards (United States), the consolidated financial statements 
of Douglas, and our report dated February 15, 2015, expressed a qualified opinion.

Audit Sampling: An Overview and 
Application to Tests of Controls
I
n the next two chapters we examine how auditors use audit sampling to 
gather evidence to evaluate management’s assertions. Sampling and statis­
tics in general are topics that make many people feel uncomfortable. Before 
getting into technical audit sampling and statistical terms, we have found that 
it is useful for students to consider some of the basic concepts of sampling in 
a nontechnical context.
What If You Were an Apple Inspector?
Please imagine that you have just taken a job as an apple inspector for Best 
Apples, Inc.—a large apple grower. You are replacing a previous inspector who 
was recently fired for lack of due care, and your new employer has made it 
clear that you must meet high performance standards. Best Apples owns and 
operates many apple orchards and sells its apples to major fruit processors 
(hereafter “buyers”) whose products include fresh apples, applesauce, and 
apple juice. Best Apples makes large shipments of apples to buyers on a daily 
basis during harvest season; each shipment contains approximately 1,500 
bushels from various orchards. Each bushel contains 100 to 150 apples. The 
bushel indicates which orchard the apples come from. Your job is to manually 
inspect the quality of apples just prior to shipment. Obviously, there is neither 
the time nor the need to inspect every apple, so you will examine a sample of 
apples to draw conclusions about the quality of apples in the whole shipment.
Stop and Think: Imagine it is your first day on the job; consider for a 
moment what information about the apples your employer or the buyer you 
would like to know before you begin your inspections.
Before beginning inspections, it would be useful to know the answers to 
the following questions:
∙  For what purpose will the current shipment be used (e.g., fresh apples, sauce, 
or juice)?
∙  The definition of a defect—what constitutes a bad apple?
∙  Tolerable defect percentage—what percentage of defective apples will the 
buyers accept in a shipment?
∙  What has Best Apples’ historical defect percentage been?
∙  Have growing conditions (e.g., weather, pests) been normal this year?
∙  What happens if we send a shipment that contains an unacceptably high 
percentage of defects?
∙  Level of assurance or confidence—how confident do I need to be in my test­
ing results?
∙  What quality controls and processes does Best Apples have in place?
∙  Are the defect percentages the same for all orchards?

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
Suppose you receive satisfactory answers to these questions and you begin your test-
ing. The primary purpose of sampling is to draw inferences about the whole population 
based on the results of testing only a subset of the population. You examine a sample of 
20 apples and find 1 defective apple. Projecting your sample defect rate to the total popu-
lation suggests a shipment defect rate of 5 percent (1/20).
Stop and Think: While 5 percent is your best estimate based on your sample results, will 
you be positive that you have determined the correct defect rate for the entire shipment?
While 5 percent is the projected defect rate, there is a chance the shipment defect rate 
could be higher or lower than your sample rate of 5 percent. The uncertainty associated 
with sampling is known as sampling risk. Whenever inspectors or auditors test less than 
the entire population, there is a risk that the sample results will not be similar to what the 
results would be if the inspector were to test the entire population. In other words, sam-
pling risk is the risk that the results of a sample are not representative of the population.
Sampling theory allows us to measure the risk associated with sampling. For example, 
if we knew a buyer would accept up to 10 percent defective apples in a shipment, we can 
compute the risk that the actual shipment defect rate is higher than 10 percent (you will 
learn how to make such evaluations in this chapter). Inspectors and auditors can reduce 
sampling risk by taking larger samples. In the extreme, if you tested 100 percent of the 
apples in the shipment, then there would be no sampling risk because you would know 
with certainty the true shipment defect rate. While it would not be economical for you to 
inspect every apple, you could increase your sample size to reduce the risk that the ship-
ment will contain an unacceptably high rate of defects. So an important concept in audit 
sampling is that by increasing sample size, you can reduce uncertainty and risk.
The converse of sampling risk is confidence level. In other words, while two samples 
of different sizes might yield a similar defect rate of 5 percent (1/20 and 5/100), the larger 
sample will produce more confidence that the shipment has an acceptably low defect rate 
(relative to the buyer’s acceptable rate of say 10 percent). We can also say that the larger 
sample is associated with less risk and that the shipment actually has an unacceptably 
high defect rate (i.e., less sampling risk). We will continue to refer to this apple inspector 
example as we introduce sampling terms and concepts in this chapter.
This chapter has two overall objectives: (1) to provide an introduction and overview of 
audit sampling and (2) to apply statistical attribute sampling and nonstatistical sampling 
techniques to tests of controls. The sampling techniques covered in this chapter are appli-
cable for testing conducted for both an audit of internal controls over financial reporting 
and a financial statement audit. In Chapter 9 we cover statistical and nonstatistical sam-
pling techniques for substantive tests of account balances.
Overview of Audit Sampling
The fundamental concepts of audit sampling apply to sampling applied to both tests of con-
trols (Chapter 8) and tests of balances (Chapter 9). For a very small entity, it may be possible 
for the independent auditor to examine all of the records during the period. However, given 
the size and complexity of most entities needing a financial statement audit, it is not economi-
cal to examine all the accounting records and supporting documents. Auditors therefore often 
find it necessary to draw conclusions about the fairness of financial statement assertions 
based on examinations of samples of the records and transactions.1 As a result, the auditor

Guide) (New York: AICPA, 2012) for a discussion of the development of sampling in auditing.

provides reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the financial statements are fairly presented. 
Accepting some uncertainty is the trade-off between the cost of examining all the data and the 
cost of making an incorrect decision based on a sample of the data.
Auditing standards recognize and permit both statistical and nonstatistical methods of 
audit sampling. With nonstatistical sampling the auditor does not strictly apply statistical tech­
niques and has the ability to apply some judgment to evaluate the results.Research suggests that 
both methods are common in practice.2 Both nonstatistical and statistical methods are based on 
the same fundamental sampling theories. In fact, the steps and techniques used for these two 
sampling approaches are far more similar than they are different, and auditing standards indi­
cate the sample sizes for the two approaches should be approximately the same. To properly 
apply a nonstatistical sampling approach, it is necessary to understand the underlying statistical 
principles; thus, we cover statistical sampling before we discuss nonstatistical sampling.
Occasionally, students will ask if recent advances in computer-assisted audit techniques and 
big data analysis have, or will have, eliminated the need for audit sampling. Two advances have 
reduced the number of times auditors need to apply sampling techniques to gather audit evi­
dence. First, many companies have developed well-controlled, automated accounting systems 
that can process routine transactions with no or very few errors. Rather than rely on audit sam­
pling to test routine transactions processed by these automated information systems, auditors test 
the processing software control configurations and general computer controls (e.g., restricted 
access, program change management) associated with the automated controls. Second, the 
advent of powerful audit software such as IDEA allows auditors, in some situations, to download 
and examine entire populations of data rather than rely on a sample from the population.
While technology has reduced the number of situations where audit sampling is neces­
sary, technology will never totally eliminate the need for auditors to rely on sampling to some 
degree because (1) many control processes and data input procedures require human involve­
ment (e.g., reconciliations, review, and resolution of a system’s generated exception reports); 
(2) many testing procedures require the auditor to physically inspect an asset (e.g., inventory) 
or inspect characteristics of a transaction or balance (e.g., terms in a contract); (3) in many 
cases auditors are required to obtain and evaluate evidence from third parties (e.g., letters 
confirming accounts receivable balances from the entity’s customers); and (4) data analysis is 
only as good as the quality of the underlying data and often the completeness, accuracy, and 
validity of the underlying data need to be tested and sampling can be an effective and efficient 
technique. These situations require the auditor’s “hands-on” attention. When the number of 
items or transactions in these populations is large, it is not economical for auditors to test 
100 percent of the population; instead they use sampling to gather sufficient audit evidence.

Audit sampling is defined as the selection and evaluation of less than 100 percent of the items 
in a population of audit relevance selected in such a way that the auditor expects the sample 
to be representative of the population and thus likely to provide a reasonable basis for conclu­
sions about the population.
Sampling Risk
When sampling is used by an auditor, an element of uncertainty enters into the auditor’s con­
clusions. This element of uncertainty, referred to as sampling risk, was discussed briefly in the 
apple inspector example at the beginning of this chapter. Sampling risk refers to the possibility 
that the sample drawn is not representative of the population and that, as a result, the auditor

will reach an incorrect conclusion about the account balance or class of transactions based on 
the sample. Thus, a representative sample is one where the evaluation of the sample results 
leads to the same conclusions that would be drawn if the same audit procedures were applied to 
the entire population. When using audit sampling to obtain evidence, the auditor must always 
accept some sampling risk simply because he or she is not examining all items in a popula­
tion. Sampling risk is one reason why auditors must accept some detection and audit risk, as 
discussed in Chapter 4.
Due to sampling risk, the auditor faces the chance that the evaluation of a sample may 
lead to one of two possible types of decision errors: (1) deciding that the population tested 
is not acceptable when in reality it is and (2) deciding that the population tested is accept­
able when in reality it is not. In statistical terms, these errors are known as Type I and Type 
II errors, respectively. More formally, Type I and Type II errors are defined as follows:
	
∙	 Risk of incorrect rejection (Type I). In testing an internal control, this is the risk that 
the sample supports a conclusion that the control is not operating effectively when, 
in truth, the control is operating effectively. When an auditor is evaluating the level 
of reliance that can be placed on a control in the context of a financial statement 
audit, this risk is also commonly referred to as the risk of underreliance or the risk of 
assessing control risk too high.
	
	 	 In substantive testing, this is the risk that the sample supports the conclusion that 
the recorded account balance is materially misstated when it is actually not materially 
misstated.
	
∙	 Risk of incorrect acceptance (Type II). In testing a control, this is the risk that the 
sample supports a conclusion that the control is operating effectively when, in truth, it is 
not operating effectively. When an auditor is evaluating the level of reliance that can be 
placed on a control in the context of a financial statement audit, this risk is also commonly 
referred to as the risk of overreliance, or the risk of assessing control risk too low.
	
	 	 In substantive testing, this is the risk that the sample supports the conclusion that 
the recorded account balance is not materially misstated when it is actually materially 
misstated.
Stop and Think: Which of the above risks relates primarily to audit efficiency and 
which relates primarily to audit effectiveness?
The risk of incorrect rejection (a Type I decision error) relates to the efficiency of the 
audit. This type of decision error can result in the auditor conducting more audit work than 
necessary in order to reach the correct conclusion. The risk of incorrect acceptance (a Type II 
decision error) relates to the effectiveness of the audit. This type of decision error can result 
in the auditor failing to detect a material misstatement in the financial statements, which can 
lead to litigation against the auditor by parties that rely on the financial statements. Because of 
the potentially severe consequences of a Type II decision error, auditors design their sampling 
applications to keep this risk to an acceptably low level. Auditors typically focus only on Type 
II decision errors in determining their sample sizes, because Type I decision errors affect effi­
ciency and not effectiveness. For these reasons, in this chapter we do not address the potential 
implications on sampling applications of Type I errors.
Audit procedures can also involve nonsampling risk. Nonsampling risk is the risk that the 
auditor reaches an erroneous conclusion for any reason that is not related to sampling risk; 
that auditors will make judgment errors caused by the use of inappropriate audit procedures 
or misinterpretation of audit evidence and failure to recognize a misstatement or deviation. 
When applying audit sampling to substantive tests of details, both sampling and nonsam­
pling risk make up the auditor’s detection risk. While statistical sampling allows the auditor 
to quantify and control sampling risk, no sampling method allows the auditor to measure 
nonsampling risk. The uncertainty related to nonsampling risk can be controlled by adequate 
training, proper planning, and effective supervision.

Three Important Factors  In the preface to the chapter, we asked you to imagine that 
you were an apple inspector and we asked you to consider what information you would like 
to have before you began testing apples. While you would want answers to all the questions 
listed in the preface, you will find that three of the factors listed there are the most impor­
tant inputs to determine sample sizes for all types of audit sampling. These three inputs are 
(1) desired level of assurance in the results of the sample (or confidence level), (2) acceptable 
defect rate (or tolerable error), and (3) historical defect rate (or expected error).
Confidence Level
The first input, confidence level, is the complement of sampling risk. For example, as an apple 
inspector you have to accept some risk that the shipment defect percentage is higher than your 
sample defect percentage, and higher than the defect rate the buyer will tolerate. You would 
determine your acceptable level of sampling risk by considering the amount of reliance to be 
placed on your tests and the consequences of a decision error. The more the reliance placed 
on your inspection (versus other testing or quality control measures) and the more severe the 
consequences of an error, the less risk you will want to accept and the more confident you 
will want to be in your testing. For example, if the consequence of a failed shipment is that 
the apple buyer will stop doing business with your company, you will want to accept little risk 
and be highly confident in your sample results. Auditors, like inspectors, focus on both risk 
and confidence level. In statistical terminology, a confidence level represents the probability 
that a given interval includes the true, but unknown, measure of the characteristic of interest. 
For example, to place reliance on a control, an auditor may want to be 95 percent confident 
that the control operates effectively at least 97 percent of the time (or fails to operate no more 
than 3 percent of the time). Because risk is the complement of confidence level, auditors 
can set either confidence level or sampling risk. For example, the auditor may set sampling 
risk for a particular sampling application at 5 percent, which results in a confidence level of 
95 percent. Confidence level and sampling risk are related to sample size: the larger the sam­
ple, the higher the confidence level and the lower the sampling risk.
Tolerable and Expected Error
Once the desired confidence level is established, the appropriate sample size is determined 
largely by how much tolerable error exceeds expected error. The smaller the difference 
between these two variables, the more precise the sampling results must be, and therefore the 
larger the sample size needed. For example, assume that during your interview for the apple 
inspector position you were told that the historical shipment defect rate has averaged 3 percent 
±2 percent and the buyers typically can accept up to 10 percent defective apples. However, as 
you are planning your sample on the first day of work, you learn that poor weather this year 
has resulted in an expected defect rate of 7 percent ±3 percent. All else equal, the new infor­
mation will require a larger sample size because now there is a smaller margin for error or 
smaller difference between tolerable and expected error. This is because there is less room to 
accommodate sampling risk in the interval between 7 and 10 percent than there is in the inter­
val between 3 and 10 percent. Similarly, even assuming the historical rate stayed at 3 percent, 
if a customer reduced their acceptance defect level from 10 percent to 6 percent the margin for 
error would be smaller. It doesn’t matter which of the two factors, tolerable or expected error, 
causes a change in the difference between them to be smaller; the critical factor is how large 
the difference is between the defect rate (or misstatement) that is expected and the defect rate 
(or misstatement) that can be tolerated.
In typical statistical sampling terminology, the term precision relates to how close a 
sample estimate is to the population characteristic being estimated, given a specified sam­
pling risk. Thus, precision at the planning stage of an audit sampling application is the 
difference between the expected and the tolerable deviation rate or misstatement. Audit­
ing standards use the term allowance for sampling risk to reflect the concept of preci­
sion in a sampling application. For example, if an auditor expected that a control would 
have a 2 percent deviation (failure) rate and he or she were willing to tolerate a deviation 

268	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
rate of 5 percent, the allowance for sampling risk would be 3 percent. Remember that in 
order to use audit sampling to gather audit evidence, auditors must be able to “tolerate” 
some ­deviations (for controls testing) or misstatement (for substantive testing) to provide an 
allowance for sampling risk. The only way to completely remove this risk is to test all the 
items in a population.
Audit Evidence Choices That Do and Do Not Involve Sampling
In assessing the risk of material misstatement, or in auditing an account balance or a class of 
transactions, the auditor seldom relies on a single test. Generally, the auditor applies a number 
of audit procedures in order to reach a conclusion. Some audit procedures involve sampling 
as defined by auditing standards, while others do not involve sampling. Table 8–1 indicates 
the types of evidence that are commonly gathered using audit sampling as well as types where 
sampling is generally not used.
We have already covered the types of evidence in earlier chapters, but here are some 
examples of typical sampling applications.
	
∙	 Inspection of tangible assets. An auditor typically attends an entity’s year-end 
inventory count. Because the number of inventory items can be very large, the auditor 
may use audit sampling to select inventory items to physically inspect and count.
	
∙	 Inspection of records or documents. A control may require that before a check is 
written to a vendor, the payables clerk must match an approved purchase order to 
an approved receiving report and vendor invoice and indicate an acceptable match 
by initialing a copy of the check stapled to the other three documents. For large 
companies, this sort of control would be performed many times a day. The auditors 
can gather evidence on the effectiveness of the control by testing a sample of the 
documentation packages.
	
∙	 Reperformance. As discussed in Chapter 7, to comply with PCAOB standards, 
publicly traded entities must document and test controls over important assertions for 
significant accounts. In assessing the competence and objectivity of the entity’s work, 
the auditor may reperform a sample of the tests performed by the entity.
	
∙	 Confirmation. A common technique to gather evidence that accounts receivable 
balances exist and are accurately recorded is to send letters to customers asking them 
to confirm their balance. Rather than send a letter to all customers, the auditor can 
select a sample of customers.
Testing All Items with a Particular Characteristic  Table 8–1 indicates that sampling 
is commonly used to gather evidence of the first five types. It is also common for auditors to 
use other testing approaches instead of sampling or in combination with sampling to gather 
evidence. For example, when an account or class of transactions is made up of a few large 
items, the auditor can easily test all the items in the account or class of transactions. Because

the entire class or balance is subjected to a 100 percent examination, such an audit procedure 
does not involve sampling. More common than testing 100 percent of the items in an account 
balance or class of transactions is a technique in which the auditor tests all items with a par­
ticular characteristic of interest based on risk or monetary value. For example, if the auditor is 
aware of certain transactions that look unusual or present greater risk, the auditor should test 
all these items rather than applying audit sampling.
Similarly, if a relatively small number of large transactions make up a relatively large per­
centage of an account or class of transactions, auditors will typically test all the transactions 
greater than a particular dollar amount. As an illustration, an auditor may decide to audit all 15 
individual accounts receivable balances greater than $100,000, because these large custom­
ers make up 70 percent of the total account balance. For the remaining 30 percent of the total 
account balance consisting of individual customer account balances less than $100,000, the 
auditor could apply audit sampling. Alternatively, the auditor could decide to apply substan­
tive analytical procedures to the part of the total receivables balance consisting of individual 
customer accounts under $100,000, or may even decide to apply no audit procedures to this 
part of the total account because he or she deems that an acceptably low risk of material mis­
statement exists in this group. In these last two instances, the auditor is not using sampling.
Testing Only One or a Few Items  Automated information systems process transactions 
consistently unless the system or programs are changed. When testing automated IT controls, 
the auditor may decide to test one or a few of each type of transactions at a point in time. In 
conjunction with that test of the automated controls, the auditor may test general controls over 
changes to the system and program in order to provide evidence that the automated controls 
have been operating over the audit period. This type of test of automated IT control does not 
involve audit sampling.
Types of Audit Sampling
Nonstatistical versus Statistical Sampling
There are two general approaches to audit sampling: nonstatistical and statistical. In nonstatis­
tical sampling, the auditor does not strictly follow statistical techniques to determine the sample 
size, select the sample, and/or measure sampling risk when evaluating results. Statistical sam­
pling, on the other hand, uses the laws of probability to compute sample size and evaluate the 
sample results. Statistical sampling permits the auditor to use the most efficient sample size 
and to quantify the sampling risk for the purpose of reaching a statistical conclusion about the 
population. As noted earlier in the chapter, auditing standards require that both methods lead to 
comparable sample sizes and evaluations. Both approaches require the use of the auditor’s pro­
fessional judgment to plan, perform, and evaluate the sample evidence. The major advantages 
of statistical sampling are that it helps the auditor (1) design an efficient sample, (2) measure 
the sufficiency of evidence obtained, and (3) quantify sampling risk. The disadvantages of sta­
tistical sampling include additional costs of (1) training auditors in the proper use of sampling 
techniques, (2) designing and conducting the sampling application, and (3) lacking consistent 
application across audit teams due to the complexity of the underlying concepts.
With a nonstatistical sampling application, the auditor must rely on his or her profes­
sional judgment, in combination with audit firm guidance and knowledge of the underlying 
statistical sampling theories, to reach a conclusion about the audit test. Therefore, to prop­
erly apply nonstatistical sampling, auditors’ judgment and their firm’s sampling guidance 
must be grounded in statistical sampling theory. Thus, a disadvantage of nonstatistical sam­
pling is that auditor judgment may diverge significantly from sampling theory, resulting in 
testing that is not as effective as statistical sampling. Audit firms that use nonstatistical 
sampling address this concern by providing their auditors with nonstatistical sampling guid­
ance and procedures that are easy to use, encourage consistency in sampling applications 
across engagement teams, and are grounded in sampling theory. Firms that use

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
nonstatistical audit sampling approaches build in their sampling experts’ decisions into 
sampling tools and templates, which can simplify the application of audit sampling, reduce 
mistakes than can occur in applying statistical sampling, and foster consistency in applica­
tion across audit teams. Recent research finds that the use of templates can increase the 
proper application of audit sampling in practice.3
This chapter and Chapter 9 provide detailed coverage of both statistical and nonstatis­
tical sampling. Even though nonstatistical sampling is very common in practice, we cover 
statistical sampling first because statistical theory provides the foundation for both sampling 
approaches.

Practice 
INSIGHT
Whether nonstatistical or statistical sampling is used, the sample size must be sufficient to support 
reliance on the type of controls and assertions being tested. PCAOB inspection teams have found 
instances of auditors using sample sizes that were smaller than required to support their conclusions 
regarding the effectiveness of controls tested (e.g., PCAOB Release No. 104-2012-271).
Types of Statistical Sampling Techniques
Auditors use three major types of statistical sampling techniques: attribute sampling, 
­monetary-unit sampling, and classical variables sampling.
Attribute Sampling  Attribute sampling is used to estimate the proportion of a population 
that possesses a specified characteristic. The most common use of attribute sampling is for 
tests of controls. In the case of controls testing, the auditor wants to determine the deviation 
rate for a control implemented within the entity’s accounting system. For example, the auditor 
may want to gather evidence that a credit check is performed on customer orders before ship­
ment. Measurement of the deviation rate provides evidence about whether the control is oper­
ating effectively to process accounting transactions properly and therefore provides support for 
the auditor’s set level of control risk. Attribute sampling may also be used with a substantive 
test of transactions when such a test is conducted with a test of controls as a dual-purpose test.
Monetary-Unit Sampling  Monetary-unit sampling uses attribute-sampling theory and 
techniques to estimate the monetary amount of misstatement for a class of transactions or an 
account balance.4 Auditors use this sampling technique because it has a number of advantages 
over classical variables sampling. Monetary-unit sampling builds upon attribute-sampling 
theory to express a conclusion regarding the monetary amount of estimated misstatement in 
an account. You will learn about monetary-unit sampling in Chapter 9.
Classical Variables Sampling  Classical variables sampling in auditing utilizes the tech­
niques typically taught in an undergraduate statistics class. While auditors sometimes use 
variables sampling to estimate the dollar value of a class of transactions or account balance, 
it is more frequently used to determine whether an account is materially misstated. Classical 
variables sampling is covered in Advanced Module 1 in Chapter 9.
Regardless of the approach or type of sampling, auditing standards contain requirements 
that auditors must follow when planning, selecting a sample for, and performing and evalu­
ating the audit sampling applications. We will refer to these requirements as we discuss the 
different approaches and types of audit sampling.
The remainder of this chapter presents an application of statistical attribute sampling to 
tests of controls, followed by a discussion of nonstatistical sampling applied to tests of controls.

Attribute Sampling Applied to Tests of Controls
Attribute sampling is a statistical sampling method used to estimate the proportion of a char­
acteristic in a population. In applying this technique to tests of controls, the auditor normally 
attempts to determine the operating effectiveness of a control in terms of deviations from a 
prescribed internal control.
In conducting a statistical sample for a test of controls, auditing standards require the 
auditor to properly plan, perform, and evaluate the sampling application and adequately doc­
ument each phase of the sampling application in the working papers. The following sections 
discuss the steps that are included in the three phases of an attribute-sampling application. 
Table 8–2 lists the steps involved in the three phases of an attribute-sampling application.
Calabro Wireless, Inc., Illustration  Audit tests for the audit of Calabro Wireless Ser­
vices, Inc., will be used to demonstrate an attribute-sampling application. Calabro is a busi­
ness services company that uses wireless communications technology to develop solutions for 
businesses. The company emphasizes its systems, reliability, solution-oriented marketing, and 
high level of customer service. The company provides high-quality, low-cost service to the 
marketplace. In recent years, the company has experienced annual growth of about 20 percent 
per year. Andrew Judd is the audit senior on the Calabro audit and his firm has audited Cal­
abro for 10 years. The auditors have developed an understanding of Calabro’s revenue process 
and have decided to rely on selected controls to reduce control risk below the maximum for 
the current year financial statement audit.

Given the integrated audit of internal control and the financial statements for public companies, 
the auditor often performs tests of controls that simultaneously satisfy the objectives of both audits 
(AS5).
Planning
Proper planning of attribute sampling involves completing a number of important steps. Each 
of these steps, in turn, requires the use of professional judgment on the part of the auditor. The 
following subsections document Judd’s sampling plan on the Calabro Wireless Services audit. 
Typically, a public accounting firm uses a formal working paper or template to document the 
steps in the sampling plan.

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
Step 1: Determine the Test Objectives  Auditing standards require that sampling appli­
cations be well planned and take into consideration the relationship of the sample to the 
objective(s) of the test. The objective of attribute sampling when used for tests of controls is 
to evaluate the operating effectiveness of the internal control for purposes of the internal con­
trol audit for public companies (see Chapter 7) or to determine the degree of reliance that can 
be placed on controls for a financial statement audit. Thus, the auditor assesses the deviation 
or error rate that exists for each control selected for testing. Audit sampling for tests of con­
trols is generally appropriate when the completion of a control procedure leaves documentary 
evidence (e.g., initials or electronic signature of approval).
In the Calabro audit, the objective of the test is to determine if Calabro’s revenue pro­
cess is functioning as documented. Judd, the audit senior, wants to determine if the controls 
identified concerning credit authorization, contract approval, and proper pricing are operating 
effectively and thus allow control risk to be set below the maximum.
Calabro’s revenue transactions arise in the following manner:
Customers may lease a wireless device from the company or purchase a wireless device and pay 
only a monthly fee for the use of the company’s software and system. Each customer enters into 
a service contract with the company, which provides for the payment of the access fee and the 
purchase or lease of one or more wireless devices. Contracts with customers with large numbers 
of devices are typically for three- to five-year terms, while contracts for smaller quantities are typi­
cally for one-year terms with renewal options at the end of the terms.
For this sampling application, Judd has decided to rely on three controls in Calabro’s 
revenue process. The three control procedures and their definitions are as follows:
	
1.	 Sales and service contracts are properly authorized for credit approval. Calabro’s 
credit department personnel check the creditworthiness of new customers and 
establish a credit limit based on that evaluation. For existing customers, the amount 
of the new sale or lease is added to the existing accounts receivable balance, and 
the total is compared to the customer’s credit limit. If the amount is less than the 
credit limit, the transaction is processed. If the total is more than the credit limit, the 
transaction is subjected to review by the credit manager before the sale is approved.
	
2.	 Sales are not recorded without an approved sales and lease contract. Calabro’s 
revenue process contains a control that no revenue transactions are to be recorded 
unless an approved sales or lease contract is sent to the billing department.
	
3.	 Sales and lease contracts are properly priced. Calabro’s revenue process also 
includes a control that requires billing department personnel to use an authorized 
price list for the sale of wireless devices. Access and lease fees are determined based 
on a fee structure that includes volume discounts for large-unit customers.
Step 2: Define the Population Characteristics  To achieve the test objectives, the audi­
tor must carefully consider the characteristics of the sampling population.
Define the Sampling Population.  All or a subset of the items that constitute the class of 
transactions (or account balance when not testing controls) make up the sampling popula­
tion. The auditor must determine that the population from which the sample is selected is 
appropriate for the specific assertion, because sample results can be projected only to the 
population from which the sample was selected. For example, suppose the auditor is inter­
ested in examining the effectiveness of a control designed to ensure that all shipments to 
customers are billed by testing whether all shipments were, in fact, billed. If the auditor uses 
the population of sales invoices as the sampling population, he or she is not likely to detect 
goods shipped but not billed, because the population of sales invoices includes only sales 
that were billed. In this example, the correct sampling population for testing the complete­
ness assertion would be the population of all shipped goods as documented by shipping 
records such as bills of lading.

	
Chapter 8    Audit Sampling: An Overview and Application to Tests of Controls	
273
There is a natural tendency to designate an entire class of transactions (or all the items in 
an account balance) as the population. However, the sample population should be restricted 
to the transactions and time period under the same system of controls that are relevant to the 
assertions being tested. For example, if interim testing will be conducted in October for a 
calendar year-end entity, the sampling population can be defined as all transactions in the first 
nine months of the year. The results of the sampling application in this case would apply only 
to the nine-month period tested. However, the auditor must also consider whether to conduct 
additional tests in the remaining period under audit through year-end (see Chapters 6 and 7 for 
discussions of what auditors do to “roll forward” testing between an interim date and year-end).
Once the population has been defined, the auditor must determine that the physical rep­
resentation (referred to as the frame) of the population is complete. This determination is 
typically made by comparing the frame—for example, an accounts receivable listing—to the 
general ledger or by examining and accounting for the numerical sequence of prenumbered 
sales invoice documents. Because the auditor selects the sample from the frame, any conclu­
sions relate only to that physical representation of the population. If the frame and the popula­
tion differ, the auditor might draw the wrong conclusion about the population. In the example 
above, if the frame and the population differ, the sales journal (the frame) would not include 
all sales transactions during the period of interest (the population).
For the audit of Calabro’s revenue process, Judd has decided the population will include 
all sales and leases recorded in the entire year. The physical representation of the population is 
the file of sales and lease contracts maintained in the sales department. Based on a review of 
the entity’s procedures for completeness, which includes accounting for prenumbered docu­
ments, Judd has determined that the frame is complete. The population of sales and lease 
transactions for the year contains 125,000 items that are numbered from 1 to 125,000.
Define the Sampling Unit.  The individual members of the sampling population are called 
the sampling units. In the apple inspector example, the sampling unit is an individual apple. 
In auditing, a sampling unit may be a document, an entry, or a line item. Each sampling unit 
makes up one item in the population. The sampling unit should be defined in relation to the 
control being tested.
The sampling unit for the test of controls in the Calabro audit is defined as the sales or 
lease contract. Judd can perform all tests for the controls selected by examining this set of 
documents.
Define Control Deviation Conditions.  For tests of controls, a deviation is a departure from 
adequate performance of the internal control. It is important for the auditor to define carefully 
what is considered a deviation. Thinking back to the apple inspector example, before you 
begin your inspection, you need to know what constitutes a “bad” apple–does it take a minor 
blemish or significant damage to conclude that an apple is defective?
Judd has defined control deviations for each of the internal controls being assessed as 
follows:
	
1.	 Sales and service contracts are properly authorized for credit approval. A deviation 
in this test is defined as the failure of Calabro’s credit department personnel to follow 
proper credit approval procedures for new and existing customers.
	
2.	 Sales are not recorded without an approved sales and lease contract. For this 
control, a deviation is defined as the absence of an approved sales or lease contract.
	
3.	 Sales and lease contracts are properly priced. A deviation in this case is the use of 
an unauthorized price for a wireless device or an incorrect access or lease fee.
Step 3: Determine the Sample Size  Considerable judgment is required in determining 
the appropriate values for the inputs that are used to compute sample size.5 The three key

Error Rates and Audit Sampling,” Auditing: A Journal of Practice and Theory (2014).

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
inputs to determining the sample are the same as those discussed earlier: the desired confi­
dence level, tolerable deviation rate, and expected population deviation rate. Auditing stan­
dards require that auditors give adequate consideration to the appropriate value of these 
inputs. Because of the difficulty of making these input judgments, determining the sample 
size is typically the most difficult step of an audit sampling application.
Desired Confidence Level.  As discussed earlier in the chapter, the complement of the confi­
dence level is the risk that the sample results will support a conclusion that the control is func­
tioning effectively when in truth it is not (i.e., the risk of incorrect acceptance). In a financial 
statement audit, this can result in assessing control risk too low. This risk influences the effec­
tiveness of the audit. If the auditor sets control risk too low and overrelies on the controls, the 
level of substantive procedures may be too low to detect material misstatements that may be 
present in the financial statement account. This is because when control risk inappropriately 
decreases, the auditor increases the acceptable level of detection risk associated with sub­
stantive testing to compensate (see discussion of the audit risk model in Chapter 4). Thus, if 
control risk is mistakenly set at a low level, detection risk will be set too high. This increases 
the risk that the auditor will fail to detect a material misstatement if one exists in the account.
In setting the desired confidence level and acceptable level of risk, the auditor considers 
the significance of the account, the importance of the assertion on which the control provides 
assurance, as well as the difficulty or complexity in applying the control. The more significant 
the account and the more complex, the higher the “what could go wrong” risk and the higher 
the desired confidence. The other important factor in determining the desired confidence level 
is the degree of reliance to be placed on the control. Generally, when the auditor has decided 
to rely on controls, the confidence level is set at 90 or 95 percent, meaning that the auditor is 
willing to accept a 10 or 5 percent risk of accepting the control as effective when in fact it is 
not. However, the auditor must remember that there is a direct relationship between the confi­
dence level and sample size: the more confident the auditor would like to be (and the less risk 
he or she is willing to accept), the larger the sample size must be, all else equal. For example, 
in the illustration below the effect on the sample size is substantial (a 21 percent increase) 
when the desired confidence level increases from 90 to 95 percent.

6The sample sizes assume a tolerable deviation rate of 5 percent, an expected population deviation rate of 1 percent, 
and a large population.
Thus, the auditor must balance effectiveness concerns with efficiency concerns when set­
ting the desired confidence level and acceptable risk of incorrect acceptance.
Tolerable Deviation Rate.  The tolerable deviation rate is the maximum deviation rate from 
a prescribed control that the auditor is willing to accept and still consider the control effective 
(i.e., the control procedure would be relied on).
Stop and Think: Why would an auditor “tolerate” any deviations in a control and still 
consider it effective?
There are two reasons auditors will tolerate deviations and still consider a control to be 
effective. The first reason is technical and relates to sampling risk. Remember that for an audi­
tor (or an apple inspector) to use sampling to gather evidence there must be some margin for 
error, because there is a risk that the sample deviation rate differs from the population deviation

rate. Even if there are no deviations in a sample, there must still be an allowance (or upper con­
fidence limit) for sampling risk. Just as in the apple inspector example, the only way to know 
with certainty what the shipment defect rate actually is would be to inspect all the apples.
The second reason auditors are willing to tolerate some control deviations relates to the 
purpose and application of controls. To be effective, most controls do not need to operate 
100 percent of the time so long as the times the control fails to operate are not predictable 
and the person(s) performing the control investigate(s) processing exceptions observed during 
the proper application of the control. By way of analogy, suppose you have battery-operated 
smoke detectors in your apartment or house and one of the alarms starts to signal a low bat­
tery. The fact that a day or two passes between the removal of the old battery and installation 
of a new one doesn’t render the system of controls ineffective for the entire period you have 
lived in the apartment or house. The risk of being harmed in a fire is pretty remote, even if 
there were no smoke detectors at all. Also, if one detector isn’t working, you have other smoke 
detectors that will sound if smoke appears. Obviously, if all the smoke detectors are disabled 
for long periods of time, the system of fire detection is not effective and the risk of injury due 
to fire increases. Similarly, when a control fails to operate, it usually does not result in a mon­
etary misstatement to the financial statements, because most transactions are properly input 
and processed (i.e., actual inherent risk is less than 100 percent) and there are other compen­
sating controls or processes that might detect a misstatement should one occur. Furthermore, 
if the operator of the control investigates processing exceptions that are discovered, he or 
she can research the cause and potential implications of the exception(s) and take corrective 
actions if necessary.
To be effective, a control does need to operate effectively for a reasonably high percent­
age of the time. Table 8–3 provides some examples of the relationship between the assessed 
importance of a control and the tolerable deviation rate.
A low tolerable deviation rate (such as 3 to 5 percent) is used when the auditor plans 
to test the effectiveness of a highly important control. A higher tolerable deviation rate 
(6 to 10 percent) is used when the auditor plans to test the effectiveness of a moderately 
important control.
The sample size is inversely related to the tolerable deviation rate. The lower the tolerable 
deviation rate, the larger the sample size. Recall that in testing controls, the key determinant 
of sample size is the amount by which tolerable deviation rate exceeds the expected deviation 
rate. For example, assuming a desired confidence level of 95 percent, an expected population 
deviation rate of 0 percent, and a large population, the effect of tolerable deviation rate on 
sample size is

Expected Population Deviation Rate.  The expected population deviation rate is the rate the 
auditor expects to exist in the population. Some level of deviation may be expected because 
the controls that auditors typically use sampling to test will be dependent on some human 
involvement (e.g., matching documents, credit approval, following up on system-generated 
exception reports), and humans are not perfect. The auditor can develop this expectation 

276	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
based on prior years’ results or on a pilot sample. If the auditor believes that the expected 
population deviation rate exceeds the tolerable deviation rate, the statistical testing should not 
be performed, because in such a situation no amount of sampling can reduce the population 
deviation rate below the tolerable rate. Instead, the auditor should perform additional substan­
tive procedures rather than relying on the control.
The sample size has a direct relationship to the expected population deviation rate; the 
larger the expected population deviation rate, the larger the sample size, all else equal. For 
example, assuming a desired confidence level of 95 percent, a tolerable deviation rate of 5 
percent, and a large population, the effect of the expected population deviation rate on sample 
size is

The dramatic effect of expected population deviation rate on sample size highlights the 
importance of a good estimate of the expected deviation rate.
Stop and Think: It is perplexing to some that an estimate of the expected population 
deviation rate is required as an input to determine sample size—after all, isn’t the pur­
pose of testing a sample to estimate the deviation rate in the population?
The reason an estimate of expected deviation rate is necessary relates back to the notion 
of precision, or by how much the tolerable deviation rate exceeds the estimated deviation rate, 
as discussed earlier in the chapter. Recall the apple inspector illustration where the buyer’s 
tolerable defect rate was 10 percent and poor weather increased the expected defect rate from 
a historical rate of 3 percent ±2 percent to 7 percent ±3 percent. All else equal, the increase in 
expected defect rate will require a larger sample size, because there is now less room for sam­
pling risk to be accommodated, and thus the sampling conclusion needs to be more precise. 
Just as the historical defect rate is an important input for apple inspection, a good estimate of 
the expected population deviation rate is very important for attribute sampling because the 
statistical sample size will be just large enough such that if the auditor observes the deviation 
rate she or he expects or lower, the sampling application will support a conclusion that the 
control is operating effectively. Similarly, if the auditor observes a higher deviation rate than 
the expected rate used in the sample size calculation, this usually means the sample results are 
unacceptable. As such, it is wise to be somewhat conservative when estimating the expected 
population deviation rate so that the sample size will be adequate even if the population devia­
tion rate is slightly larger than the auditor initially thought it would be.
Table 8–4 shows Judd’s decision for each of the parameters required to determine sample 
size. Judd decides to set the desired confidence level at 95 percent (i.e., the risk of incorrect 
acceptance is 5 percent), the tolerable deviation rate at 6 percent, and the expected population 
deviation rate at 1 percent for control 1. In other words Judd is willing to conclude that the 
controls are effective if he can be at least 95 percent confident that control 1 does not have a 
deviation rate greater than 6 percent. For control 1, Judd has planned a high confidence level 
(see Table 8–3). A similar strategy is followed for control 3. For control 2, Judd has planned 
a moderate confidence level because he plans to place less reliance on the control. In this 
sampling plan, the effect of the population size can be ignored because the population is very 
large. The effect of population size on attribute sampling is discussed below.
Tables 8-5 and 8-6 are used to determine the sample size for each of the controls. For 
control 1, Judd uses Table 8–5 to determine the sample size because the desired confidence 
level is 95 percent. Judd identifies the column for a 6 percent tolerable deviation rate and 

	
Chapter 8    Audit Sampling: An Overview and Application to Tests of Controls	
277
reads down that column until the row for a 1 percent expected population deviation rate is 
found. The sample size for control 1 is 78 items. For control 2, Judd uses Table 8–6 because 
the desired confidence level is 90 percent. Reading down the 8 percent tolerable deviation 
rate column until the 2 percent expected population deviation rate is found, Judd determines 
that the sample size is 48. Finally, the sample size for control 3 is 93. This is found by using 
Table 8–5 and reading down the 5 percent tolerable deviation rate column until the 1 percent 
expected deviation rate row is reached.
Significant areas of Tables 8-5 and 8-6 are covered by asterisks. Another way to explain 
the cause of the asterisks is insufficient precision. Recall that to apply sampling there must 
be sufficient margin for error. When tolerable and estimated deviation rates are too close 
together, sample sizes will become too large to be practical or are simply not computable 
because there is insufficient allowance for sampling risk. Furthermore, in some instances 
where an asterisk appears in the tables, the expected population deviation rate is greater than

the tolerable deviation rate; audit sampling obviously is not appropriate in such situations 
because there is no allowance for sampling risk.
Auditors often establish one sample size for all controls tested within a business process; 
this is particularly true when all the tests of controls are to be conducted on the same sampling 
units. This is an acceptable practice because the auditor would use the largest of the computed 
sample sizes. Therefore, in this example, the auditor may decide to use a sample size of 93 to 
test the three controls. However, we will assume that the auditor in the Calabro example used 
the sample sizes shown in Table 8–4.
Computing Sample Size with IDEA Software
Exhibit 8–1 shows the screen display from IDEA software for determining the sample size for 
control 3.7 The auditor opens a workbook, chooses the “Analysis” tab and within the “Sam­
ple” group the auditor clicks on “Attribute.” The attribute sampling window is then displayed 
and the auditor enters the relevant data. The auditor enters “125000” for “Population size” 
(commas are not included when entering values in IDEA), “5” for “% Tolerable deviation 
rate,” “1” for “% Expected deviation rate” (i.e., expected population deviation rate), “95” for 
“Confidence level,” and clicks the “Compute” button at the bottom of the window. This pro­
duces a sample size of 93, the same as the sample size determined using the tables. Advanced 
Module 2 in this chapter provides a chart comparing the terminology used by IDEA to the 
terminology used in the attribute sampling tables.
Population Size.  Students and auditors are often surprised that the size of the popula­
tion is not an important factor in determining sample size for attribute sampling. Due to the

properties of the underlying sampling distribution, the population size has little or no effect 
on the attribute sampling sample size, unless the population is relatively small (e.g., less 
than 1,000 items). In fact, so long as the population is made up of similar items under the 
same system of controls, it doesn’t matter if the population is 100,000 items, 1 million items, 
100 million items, or more; the sample size is the same. If you use the IDEA software that 
accompanies or is available with this book, you can verify that the sample size computed in 
Exhibit 8–1 doesn’t change if you keep entering larger population sizes. Some audit sampling 
software programs do not consider population size when computing sample size for attribute 
sampling and other programs, like IDEA, do consider the effects of population size. See what 
happens when you recompute the sample size in Exhibit 8–1 with smaller population sizes 
such as 1,000 or 100. Because most of the populations that auditors test are larger than several 
hundred items, and because assuming large population sample size does not reduce the effec­
tiveness of the sampling application, the sample size tables ignore the effects of population, 
as does the remainder of this chapter. However, in Advanced Module 1 in this chapter, we 
include a brief discussion of how sample sizes can be manually adjusted for smaller popula­
tions and a small population sample size table is provided for testing controls that operate 
infrequently (i.e., quarterly, monthly, weekly).
Table 8–7 summarizes the effects of the four factors on the size of the sample to be 
selected.
Performance
After the sampling application has been planned, an auditor performs each of the following 
steps.
Step 4: Select Sample Items  Auditing standards require that the sample items be 
selected in such a way that the sample can be expected to represent the population. Thus, all 
items must have an equal opportunity to be selected. The following two selection methods are 
acceptable for attributes sampling.

280	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
Random-Number Selection.  The auditor may select a random sample using random num­
bers generated by a spreadsheet application or audit sampling software. Using this method 
of selection, every item in the population (such as a document or customer account) has the 
same probability of being selected as every other sampling unit in the population. Statis­
tical sampling requires that the auditor be able to measure the probability of selecting the 
sampling units selected. Thus, random-number selection is used in many statistical sampling 
applications. Auditors typically use unrestricted random sampling without replacement for 
sampling applications. This means that once an item is selected, it is removed from the frame 
and cannot be selected a second time. Given the auditor’s objectives, it seems sensible for an 
auditor to include an item only once in the sample. Random numbers can be obtained from 
random-number tables or software such as MS Excel or IDEA. For the Calabro audit, Judd 
used MS Excel to generate 93 (the sample size determined by using the tables) random num­
bers between 1 and 125,000 and collected sales and lease contracts corresponding to those 
random numbers for testing.
Obtaining Random Numbers from IDEA Software
Exhibit 8–2 shows an example of the output from the random-number generator in IDEA. On 
the “Analysis” tab, in the “Sample” group, in the “Other” folder, the auditor clicks on “Generate 
Random Numbers.” The Generate Random Numbers window is then displayed and the auditor 
enters the relevant data. The sample size of 93 is entered for “Generate how many random num­
bers.” The “Seed” is used to start the random-number process. IDEA automatically creates a 
random seed or the auditor can enter a random number seed. The auditor then enters the range 
of the invoice number sequence (1 to 125,001).8 Accept the defaults (unchecked boxes) for 
“Include detailed calculations” and “Allow duplicate numbers” so that each random number is 
unique. If the population data are available in electronic format, IDEA or spreadsheet programs 
like MS Excel can randomly select the sample records directly from the population.9
Systematic Selection.  When using a systematic selection approach to select a sample, the 
auditor determines a sampling interval by dividing the sampling population by the sample 
size. A starting number is selected in the first interval, and then every nth item is selected. 
When a random starting point is used, systematic selection provides a sample where every 
sampling unit has an equal chance of being selected. For example, suppose the auditor wishes 
to select 100 items from a population of 15,000 items numbered 1 to 15,000. The sampling 
interval in this case is 150 (15,000 ÷ 100). The auditor chooses a random number in the first 
8Each random number generated by IDEA will be greater than or equal to the minimum value and less than the maxi-
mum value you specify. Notice the box in Exhibit 1 says, “Up to but not including:”. No random number will be equal 
to the maximum value. For this reason, the maximum is input as 125,001.
9An example of sampling population data in an electronic format is provided in the IDEA end-of-chapter problems 
for Chapter 9, available from Connect.

interval (i.e., between 1 and 150), say 125, and that item is selected for testing. The second 
item is 275 (125 + 150), the third item is 425, and so on. To avoid the possibility that a 
systematic sample will miss systematic deviations in the population (e.g., control deviations 
occurring every 300th unit or every Friday afternoon), the auditor can use several random 
starting points. In our example, after selecting 10 items, the auditor could use a new random 
start between the 10th and 11th interval to select the 11th item.
Step 5: Perform the Audit Procedures  After the sample items have been selected, the 
auditor conducts the planned audit procedures. In conducting the audit procedures for tests of 
controls, the auditor may encounter the following situations:
	
∙	 Voided documents. The auditor may occasionally select a voided document in a 
sample. If the transaction has been properly voided, it does not represent a deviation. 
The item should be replaced with a new sample item.

282	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
	
∙	 Unused or inapplicable documents. Sometimes a selected item is not appropriate 
for the definition of the control. For example, the auditor may define a deviation 
for a purchase transaction as a vendor’s bill not supported by a receiving report. If 
the auditor selects a telephone or utility bill, there will not be a receiving report to 
examine. In such a case, the absence of the receiving report would not be a deviation. 
The auditor would simply replace the item with another purchase transaction.
	
∙	 Inability to examine a sample item. Auditing standards require that the auditor 
consider the effect of not being able to apply a planned audit procedure to a sample 
item. For most tests of controls, the auditor examines documents for evidence of the 
performance of the control. If the auditor is unable to examine a document or to use 
an alternative procedure to test whether the control was adequately performed, the 
sample item is a deviation for purposes of evaluating the sample results.
	
∙	 Stopping the test before completion. If a large number of deviations are detected 
early in the tests of controls, the auditor should consider stopping the test as soon 
as it is clear that the results of the test will not support the planned assessed level of 
control risk. If such a case occurred in the context of an audit of internal controls 
for a public company, the entity would be informed, and the exceptions would be 
considered a control deficiency unless remediation and retesting are successful or 
there are other controls that adequately address the increased risk of misstatement. 
In the context of a financial statement audit, the auditor would rely on other internal 
controls or set control risk at the maximum for the audit assertion affected, and 
appropriately enhance the related substantive tests.
Whenever a deviation is observed in controls, the auditor should investigate the nature, 
cause, and consequence of the deviation.
Understand and Analyze Deviations Observed.  The auditor should evaluate the qualitative 
aspects of the deviations identified. This involves two considerations. First, the nature of each 
deviation and its cause and consequences should be considered. For example, the auditor 
should determine if a deviation represents an unintentional error or a fraud and whether the 
deviation actually resulted in a monetary misstatement to the financial statements. The audi­
tor should also attempt to determine whether a deviation resulted from a cause such as misun­
derstanding of instructions or carelessness. Understanding the nature and cause of a deviation 
helps the auditor better assess control risk and evaluate whether the deviation(s) represent(s) 
control deficiencies. In Chapter 7, Table 7–7 lists specific deficiencies that are indicative 
of material weaknesses (e.g., deviations that indicate management fraud, deviation(s) that 
resulted in monetary misstatements that are significant). Second, the auditor should con­
sider how the deviations may impact the other phases of the audit. For example, suppose that 
deviations found in a test of the revenue process resulted from improper granting of credit. 
As a result, the risk that the valuation assertion was not met for accounts receivable would 
increase, and the auditor would therefore increase substantive procedures for the allowance 
for uncollectible accounts.
In the Calabro example, Judd examines each of the sample items for the presence of a 
deviation. Thus, for control 1, Judd tests the 78 sales and lease contracts (sample size from the 
table) for proper credit authorization procedures by credit department personnel. The results 
of the audit procedures can be documented in a working paper similar to the example shown 
in Exhibit 8–3. As noted earlier, when multiple controls are tested on one sampling unit, audi­
tors often decide to test all controls for the full sample when such testing can be efficiently 
conducted. The choice of whether to test all controls for the full sample is a matter of risk 
management. The argument supporting this approach is that since the auditor is physically 
inspecting the documentation in the full sample, the auditor may want to reduce the risk that 
deficiencies go undetected in the documents examined for the full sample. The concern is 
that at some future date a litigation event may identify deviations in sample items 79 to 93 for 
control 1, and those deviations seem readily apparent to the courts based only on a cursory 
review of the documents. In legal terms, if the auditor failed to detect a deviation that a jury

Before calculating the sample results and drawing final conclusions on the sampling 
plan, Judd investigates the nature and cause of the exceptions. Judd also considers whether the 
deviations may impact the other phases of the audit. In the current example, two deviations 
were detected for control 1, which relates to proper authorization of credit. Judd’s investiga­
tion indicates that both deviations had occurred when sales in excess of credit limits were 
made to existing customers. Further investigation disclosed that the sales manager instead of 
the credit manager had approved the sale. Judd now knows the nature and cause of the errors. 
The effect of the control deviations is likely to be an increase in the amount of audit work 
conducted on the allowance for uncollectible accounts.
After the audit procedures have been completed, the auditor proceeds with his or her 
evaluation of the sample results.
Evaluation
Step 6: Calculate the Sample Deviation and Computed Upper Deviation Rates 
After completing the audit procedures, the auditor summarizes the deviations for each con­
trol tested and evaluates the results. Determining the sample results for an attribute-sampling 
application can be accomplished by the use of a computer program or attribute-sampling tables. 
The auditor calculates the sample deviation rate and the computed upper deviation rate. The 

284	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
sample deviation rate is simply the number of deviations found in the sample divided by the 
number of items in the sample. This calculation projects the sample results to the population 
and is required by auditing standards. For example, if 2 deviations were found in a sample of 
50, the sample deviation rate would be 4 percent (2 ÷ 50). In attribute sampling, the sample 
deviation rate represents the auditor’s best estimate of the population deviation rate. However, 
because this result is based on a sample, the auditor does not know the true population devia­
tion rate and must consider an allowance for sampling risk.
In evaluating the results of testing a control, the auditor is normally concerned only with 
whether the true deviation rate exceeds the tolerable deviation rate. Because the auditor does 
not know the true deviation rate, he or she calculates a computed upper deviation rate. The 
computed upper deviation rate is the sum of the sample deviation rate and an appropriate 
allowance for sampling risk. This sum represents an upper limit on how high the population 
deviation rate might actually be, at a controlled level of sampling risk (e.g., 5 or 10 percent). 
In other words, at the 95 percent confidence level, there is only a 5 percent chance that the 
true population deviation rate exceeds the computed upper deviation rate. This is sometimes 
referred to as the upper-limit approach.
Exhibit 8–3 shows the results of the tests of the three controls for the Calabro audit. 
Judd calculates the sample deviation rate and the computed upper deviation rate for each 
control tested. To determine the computed upper deviation rate, Judd uses either Table 8–8 or 
Table 8–9, depending on the desired confidence level for the test. A 95 percent confidence 
level is desired for control 1; thus, Judd uses Table 8–8 in the following way. The column for 
the actual number of deviations found (2 deviations) is read down until the appropriate row 
for sample size is found. If the exact sample size is not found, the closest smaller sample size 
is used. This approach provides a conservative (larger) computed upper deviation rate. For 
control 1, the row for a sample size of 75 is used. The computed upper deviation rate for con­
trol 1 is 8.2 percent. Thus, for control 1, the sample deviation rate is 2.6 percent and the allow­
ance for sampling risk is 5.6 percent (8.2 - 2.6). For control 2, Table 8–9 is used because 
the desired confidence level is 90 percent. In this case, no deviations were found, so the 
sample deviation rate is 0 percent and the upper computed deviation rate is 5 percent (round­
ing the sample size down to 45). No control deviations were found for control 3; therefore,

the sample deviation rate is 0 percent. Table 8–9 shows a computed upper deviation rate of 
3.3 percent (rounding the sample size down to 90). In other words, even though the auditor’s 
best estimate based on the results of the testing is that the population contains no deviations, 
the allowance for sampling risk associated with the sample tested is 3.3 percent.
The upper limit represents the upper one-sided confidence limit for the population 
deviation rate based on the sample size, the number of deviations, and the planned level of 
confidence. In evaluating the results of testing a control, the auditor is normally concerned 
only with whether the true deviation rate exceeds the tolerable deviation rate. Therefore, the 
auditor is generally concerned only with how high the population deviation rate might be; it 
doesn’t matter how low the population deviation rate might be.
Computing Upper Deviation Rate with IDEA Software
Exhibit 8–4 shows the output from IDEA for control 3. The auditor opens a database and 
on the “Analysis” tab, in the “Sample” group, the auditor clicks on “Attribute.” The Attri­
bute Sampling window is then displayed and the auditor chooses the “Sample Evaluation” 
tab at the top of the window and enters the relevant data. The auditor enters “125000” for 
“Population size,” “93”for “Sample size,” “0” for “Number of deviations in sample,” “95” for 
“Desired confidence level,” and hits the “Compute” button at the bottom of the window. The 
estimated 1-sided upper limit (i.e., computed upper deviation rate) is 3.17 percent. Advanced 
Module 2 in this chapter provides a chart comparing the terminology used by IDEA to the 
terminology used in the attribute sampling tables.
Step 7: Draw Final Conclusions  In drawing a conclusion about the statistical sampling 
application for tests of controls, the auditor compares the tolerable deviation rate to the com­
puted upper deviation rate. If the computed upper deviation rate is less than or equal to the tol­
erable deviation rate, the auditor can conclude that the control tested can be relied upon. If the 
computed upper deviation rate exceeds the tolerable deviation rate, the auditor will normally 
conclude that the control is not operating at an acceptable level. For an audit of internal con­
trol over financial reporting, the ineffective control would be considered a control deficiency 
unless the entity remediates the control and both the entity and the auditor retest to support 
the remediated control’s effectiveness. For purposes of an audit of internal control, the auditor

must evaluate the likelihood and magnitude of a potential misstatement arising as a result of 
control deficiencies (see Chapter 7).
For a financial statement audit, the final conclusion about control risk for the accounting 
system being tested is based on the auditor’s professional judgment of the sample results and 
other relevant tests of controls such as inquiry and observation. If the auditor concludes that the 
evidence supports the planned level of control risk, no modifications of the planned substantive 
procedures are necessary. On the other hand, if the planned level of control risk is not supported 
by the sample results and other tests of controls, the auditor should either (1) test other control 
procedures that could support the planned level of control risk or (2) increase the assessed level 
of control risk and modify the nature, extent, or timing of substantive procedures.
Table 8–10 shows the auditor’s risks when evaluating sample evidence on the planned 
level of control risk. If the evidence supports the planned level of control risk and the internal 
control is reliable, the auditor has made a correct decision. Similarly, if the evidence does not 
support the planned level of control risk and the internal control is not reliable, a correct deci­
sion has been made. The other two combinations result in decision errors by the auditor. If 
the evidence supports the planned level of control risk and the internal control is not reliable, 
the auditor will have incorrectly accepted the control as effective and overrelied on internal 
control (Type II error). This results in the auditor establishing detection risk too high and 
leads to a lower level of evidence being gathered through substantive procedures. Thus, the

auditor’s risk of not detecting material misstatement is increased. This can lead to a lawsuit 
against the auditor. If the evidence does not support the planned level of control risk and the 
internal control is reliable (Type I error), the auditor will have incorrectly rejected the control 
and detection risk will have been set too low. Thus, a higher level of evidence will be gathered 
by substantive procedures, leading to overauditing and an inefficient audit.
For the Calabro audit, Exhibit 8–3 shows that the sample evidence does not support the 
operating effectiveness of control 1 (credit authorization) because the computed upper devi­
ation rate (8.2 percent) exceeds the tolerable deviation rate (6 percent). For control 1, the 
sample deviation rate was 2.6 percent and the allowance for sampling risk was 5.6 percent. In 
this example, there appear to be no other controls or other evidence to support the operating 
effectiveness of control 1. Thus, Judd increases both the assessed level of control risk and the 
substantive procedures related to the valuation assertion.
Judd’s sample evidence supports the reliability of controls 2 and 3 because the computed 
upper deviation rates are less than the tolerable deviation rates. If Judd were performing tests 
of controls for the audit of internal control over financial reporting for a public company, he 
would conclude that controls 2 and 3 operate effectively and that the exceptions in control 1 
represent a control deficiency. Judd would then need to evaluate the likelihood and magnitude 
of a potential misstatement arising as a result of the valuation-related control deficiency.
Nonstatistical Sampling for Tests of Controls
When conducting a nonstatistical sampling application for tests of controls, the auditor con­
siders each of the steps shown in Table 8–2. The differences between nonstatistical and statis­
tical sampling occur in any or all of the following steps:
	
∙	 Determining the sample size.
	
∙	 Selecting the sample items.
	
∙	 Calculating the computed upper deviation rate.
Determining the Sample Size
When a nonstatistical sampling application is used in determining sample size, the auditor 
should consider the desired confidence, the tolerable deviation rate, and the expected population 
deviation rate. While the auditor is not required to use a statistical formula or table to determine 
sample size, professional standards indicate that sample sizes for nonstatistical and statistical 
applications should be comparable. In other words, “nonstatistical” does not justify an auditor in 
using sample sizes that are too small to provide sufficient evidence. Nonstatistical sample sizes 
are determined by applying professional judgment and guidance in audit firm policy.
A number of public accounting firms establish guidelines for nonstatistical sample sizes 
for tests of controls. Typically, accounting firms’ nonstatistical guidelines are consistent with 
sampling theory and are designed to provide two primary benefits: (1) to simplify the judg­
ments required by field auditors by having experts at firm headquarters make firmwide judg­
ments and (2) to improve consistency in sampling applications within and across engagement 
teams. For example, a firm might establish guidelines as follows for populations greater than 
250 (see Advanced Module 1 for sample sizes related to small populations):
LO 8-8
Desired Level of Controls Reliance
Sample Size
Low
10–15
Moderate
20–30
High
40–60
In developing nonstatistical sampling guidelines like those above, the firms’ experts 
have decided what confidence levels achieve low, moderate, and high assurance (say, 60–65, 
75–80, and 90–95 percent confidence, respectively). The experts have decided reasonable 

288	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
levels of tolerable deviation rates (say, between 5 and 10 percent), and they have decided to 
base an initial sample on zero expected deviations. Following this guidance, if one or more 
deviations are found in the sample, the auditor needs to expand the sample or increase the 
assessed level of control risk.
Selecting the Sample Items
While random-sample or systematic-sample (with a random start) selection is required for sta­
tistical sampling, nonstatistical sampling allows the use of those selection methods as well as 
other selection methods such as haphazard sampling. When a haphazard selection approach 
is used, sampling units are selected without any conscious bias—that is, without a special 
reason for including or omitting items from the sample. This does not imply that the items are 
selected in a careless manner; rather, the sampling units are selected to represent the popula­
tion. Haphazard selection may be useful for nonstatistical sampling, but it should not be used 
for statistical sampling because the auditor cannot measure the probability of an item being 
selected. When using audit sampling, the auditor should avoid distorting the sample by select­
ing only items that are unusual or large or items that are the first or last items in the frame, 
because the auditor needs a sample that represents the population in order to draw inferences 
about the population from the sample. This is not to say that selection of unusual, large, or 
risky events, transactions, or balances should be avoided in other audit procedures that do not 
involve audit sampling. To the contrary, the auditor should focus specific audit procedures on 
all such items, using 100 percent testing rather than audit sampling, which requires selection 
of items in a population using chance (i.e., random or haphazard selection).
Calculating the Computed Upper Deviation Rate
With a nonstatistical sample, the auditor can calculate the sample deviation rate but cannot 
quantify the computed upper deviation rate and the sampling risk associated with the test. The 
AICPA Audit Guide Audit Sampling provides the following advice for considering sampling 
risk in a nonstatistical test of controls:
If the auditor is performing a nonstatistical sampling application, sampling risk . . . cannot be 
­measured directly; however, it is generally appropriate for the auditor to conclude that the sample 
results do not support the planned assessed level of control risk if the rate of deviation identified in 
the sample exceeds the expected population deviation rate used when designing the sample.10
Suppose an auditor planned a nonstatistical sampling application by setting the desired 
confidence level at “high” (i.e., 90 to 95 percent), the expected population deviation rate at 
.5 percent, and the tolerable deviation rate at 8 percent. Assume the auditor judgmentally 
determines to select a sample size of 50 items and makes the selections haphazardly. If the 
auditor detects no control deviations, the sample deviation rate is 0 percent. In this instance, 
the sample deviation rate, 0 percent, is less than the expected population deviation rate, 
.5 percent, and there is an acceptable risk that the true population deviation rate exceeds the 
tolerable deviation rate.
Now assume that one control deviation had been detected. The sample deviation rate is 2 
percent, which is greater than the expected population deviation rate (.5 percent). Now there 
is an unacceptably high risk that the true population deviation rate exceeds the tolerable devi­
ation rate. Referring to the statistical evaluation table illustrates why the results of the non­
statistical sample are not likely to support the effectiveness of the control. Table 8–8 shows 
that if one deviation is found in a sample of 50 items, the computed upper deviation rate is 
9.2 percent. This exceeds the tolerable deviation rate of 8 percent.
Stop and Think:What factors would cause an audit sampling approach to be consid­
ered a “nonstatistical” approach?

An approach is nonstatistical if (1) judgment is used to determine the sample size, 
(2) a haphazard sample selection technique is used, and/or (3) the sample results are evaluated 
judgmentally. A nonstatistical approach can involve random selection and a judgmental eval­
uation. Haphazardly selected samples should not be evaluated statistically in a formal way 
(although such an evaluation could be used to inform an auditor’s judgment). However, it is 
important to note that any randomly drawn sample can be statistically evaluated—even if the 
auditor labels the approach “nonstatistical” and even if the sample size was not statistically 
derived. This is an important point because it highlights the need for auditors to understand 
the key concepts of sampling theory even if they are using a nonstatistical approach. Remem­
ber, if an auditor randomly selects a sample and then evaluates the results judgmentally, the 
quality of his or her judgment can be evaluated against statistical theory by outside experts.
Conclusion
The use of sampling is common in auditing because of the need to gather evidence over large 
populations of entity data in a cost-effective manner. In this chapter we discussed the basic 
concepts that are relevant to all forms of audit sampling, such as sampling risk. Whenever 
auditors use sampling techniques, they face the risk that their sample is not representative 
of the population, which could lead them to draw the wrong conclusions. Statistical theory 
allows auditors to measure this risk and manage it by taking the appropriate sample size. In 
this chapter we focused primarily on statistical attributes sampling for tests of controls and 
we provided a step-by-step approach to planning a sample, executing the sample testing, and 
evaluating the results from the sample. The steps were illustrated using both statistical tables 
and the audit software IDEA. Nonstatistical sampling is commonly used in practice, but it is 
important to remember nonstatistical approaches must be firmly grounded in statistical theory.
This chapter covered sampling for tests of controls and in Chapter 9 you will learn about 
statistical and nonstatistical sampling techniques auditors use when testing monetary balances 
(i.e., substantive testing).
Advanced Module 1: Considering the Effect on Sample 
Size of a Small Population
As noted in the chapter, due to the properties of the underlying sampling distribution, popula­
tion size had little or no effect on attribute sampling sample sizes for populations containing 
more than 1,000 items.
The attribute sampling tables presented earlier in this chapter assume a large population. 
When the population size is smaller than 1,000, the sample size taken from the tables can be 
adjusted by using the finite population correction factor as follows:
​Finite population correction factor  =   ​√ 
_______ 
1 − ​(​n / N​)​ ​
where
n = the sample size from the tables.
N = the number of units in the population.
For example, the sample size for a desired confidence of 90 percent, a tolerable deviation 
rate of 10 percent, and an expected population deviation rate of 1 percent is 39 when popula­
tion size is 10,000. If the population size was 100, the sample size of 39 could be adjusted as 
follows:
​Sample size  =  n ​√ 
_______ 
1 − ​(​n / N​)​ ​ 
 =  39 ​√ 
__________ 
1 − ​(​39 / 100​)​ ​  =  31​

KEY TERMS
Allowance for sampling risk. The uncertainty that results from sampling; the difference 
between the expected mean of the population and the tolerable deviation or misstatement.
Attribute sampling. Sampling used to estimate the proportion of a population that possesses 
a specified characteristic.
Audit sampling. The selection and evaluation of less than 100 percent of the population of 
audit relevance such that the auditor expects the items selected to be representative of the pop­
ulation and, thus, likely to provide a reasonable basis for conclusions about the population.
Classical variables sampling. The use of normal distribution theory to estimate the dollar 
amount of misstatement for a class of transactions or an account balance.
Desired confidence level. The probability that the true but unknown measure of the charac­
teristic of interest is within specified limits.
Expected population deviation rate. The deviation rate that the auditor expects to exist in 
the population.
Monetary-unit sampling. Attribute-sampling techniques used to estimate the dollar amount 
of misstatement for a class of transactions or an account balance.
Nonsampling risk. The risk that auditors will make judgment errors caused by the use of 
inappropriate audit procedures or misinterpretation of audit evidence and failure to recognize 
a misstatement or deviation.
Nonstatistical sampling. Audit sampling that relies on the auditor’s judgment to determine 
sample size (typically of comparable size to a statistically based sampling approach), select 
the sample, and/or evaluate the results for the purpose of reaching a conclusion about the 
population.

Advanced Module 2: Comparing Terminology for Attribute 
Sampling between IDEA and Sampling Tables
Some controls may operate only weekly, monthly, or quarterly. For infrequent controls 
some auditors use sample sizes provided in the following table:

	
Chapter 8    Audit Sampling: An Overview and Application to Tests of Controls	
291
Representative sample. The evaluation of the sample will result in conclusions that are simi­
lar to those that would be drawn if the same procedures were applied to the entire population.
Risk of incorrect acceptance. The risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the con­
trol is operating effectively when it is not or that the recorded account balance is not materi­
ally misstated when it is materially misstated.
Risk of incorrect rejection. The risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the control 
is not operating effectively when it actually is or that the recorded account balance is materi­
ally misstated when it is not materially misstated.
Sampling risk. The possibility that the sample drawn is not representative of the population 
and that, as a result, the auditor reaches an incorrect conclusion about the reliability of the 
control, the account balance, or class of transactions based on the sample.
Sampling unit. The individual items constituting a population being sampled.
Statistical sampling. Sampling that uses the laws of probability to select and evaluate the 
results of an audit sample, thereby permitting the auditor to quantify the sampling risk for the 
purpose of reaching a conclusion about the population.
Tolerable deviation rate. The maximum deviation rate from a prescribed control that the 
auditor is willing to accept without altering the planned assessed level of control risk.

LO 8-4	
8-11	 An advantage of statistical sampling over nonstatistical sampling is that statistical 
sampling helps an auditor to
	
a.	 Eliminate the risk of nonsampling errors.
	
b.	 Reduce audit risk and materiality to a relatively low level.
	
c.	 Measure the sufficiency of the evidential matter obtained.
	
d.	 Minimize the failure to detect errors and fraud.

8-12	 Samples to test internal controls are intended to provide a basis for an auditor to 
conclude whether
	
a.	 The controls are operating effectively.
	
b.	 The financial statements are materially misstated.

d.	 Materiality for planning purposes is at a sufficiently low level.
	
LO 8-6, 8-7

nevertheless be a transaction that is properly authorized and recorded.
	
b.	 Deviations would result in errors in the accounting records only if the deviations 
and the misstatements occurred on different transactions.
	
c.	 Deviations from pertinent control procedures at a given rate ordinarily would be 
expected to result in misstatements at a higher rate.

	 Questions 8–15 and 8–16 are based on the following information:
	
	
	 An auditor desired to test credit approval on 10,000 sales invoices processed during 
the year. The auditor designed a statistical sample that would provide 1 percent risk 
of assessing control risk too low for the assertion that not more than 7 percent of the 
sales invoices lacked approval. The auditor estimated from previous experience that 
about 2½ percent of the sales invoices lacked approval. A sample of 200 invoices 
was examined, and 7 of them were lacking approval. The auditor then determined the 
computed upper deviation rate to be 8 percent.
	
LO 8-6, 8-7	
8-15	 In the evaluation of this sample, the auditor decided to increase the level of the 
preliminary assessment of control risk because the
	
a.	 Tolerable deviation rate (7 percent) was less than the computed upper deviation 
rate (8 percent).
	
b.	 Expected population deviation rate (7 percent) was more than the percentage of 
errors in the sample (3½ percent).

	
Chapter 8    Audit Sampling: An Overview and Application to Tests of Controls

c.	 Computed upper deviation rate (8 percent) was more than the percentage of errors 
in the sample (3½ percent).
	
d.	 Expected population deviation rate (2½ percent) was less than the tolerable devia­
tion rate (7 percent).
	
LO 8-6, 8-7	
8-16	 Based on the information above, the planned allowance for sampling risk was

	 Suppose as a result of sample testing of controls, an auditor assesses control risk 
higher than necessary given the actual (but unknown) population deviation rate and

LO 8-6	
8-18	 Which of the following statements is correct concerning statistical sampling in tests 
of controls?
	
a.	 Deviations from controls at a given rate usually result in misstatements at a 
higher rate.
	
b.	 As the population size doubles, the sample size should also double.
	
c.	 The qualitative aspects of deviations are not considered by the auditor.

tion rate.
	
LO 8-2, 8-6	
8-19	 Assume an auditor is evaluating a statistical attribute sample of 50 items that resulted 
in three deviations. What should the auditor conclude if the tolerable deviation rate is 
7 percent, the expected population deviation rate is 5 percent, and the allowance for 
sampling risk is 2 percent?
	
a.	 The planned assessed level of control risk should be modified because the tol­
erable deviation rate plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the expected 
population deviation rate.
	
b.	 The sample results should be accepted as support for the planned assessed level 
of control risk because the sample deviation rate plus the allowance for sampling 
risk exceeds the tolerable deviation rate.

294	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
	
c.	 The sample results should be accepted as support for the planned assessed level 
of control risk because the tolerable deviation rate less the allowance for sampling 
risk equals the expected population deviation rate.
	
d.	 The planned assessed level of control risk should be modified because the sample 
deviation rate plus the allowance for sampling risk exceeds the tolerable deviation 
rate.
	
LO 8-2, 8-6	
8-20	 As a result of sampling procedures applied as tests of controls, an auditor incorrectly 
assesses control risk lower than appropriate. The most likely explanation for this 
situation is that
	
a.	 The deviation rates of both the auditor’s sample and the population exceed the 
tolerable deviation rate.
	
b.	 The deviation rates of both the auditor’s sample and the population are less than 
the tolerable deviation rate.
	
c.	 The deviation rate in the auditor’s sample is less than the tolerable deviation rate, 
but the deviation rate in the population exceeds the tolerable deviation rate.
	
d.	 The deviation rate in the auditor’s sample exceeds the tolerable deviation rate, but 
the deviation rate in the population is less than the tolerable deviation rate.

DISCUSSION CASE
	
LO 8-2, 8-5, 8-6	
8-32	 Baker, CPA, was engaged to audit Mill Company’s financial statements for the year 
ended September 30. After studying Mill’s internal control, Baker decided to obtain 
evidence about the effectiveness of both the design and the operation of the controls 
that may support a low assessed level of control risk concerning Mill’s shipping and 
billing functions. During the prior years’ audits, Baker had used nonstatistical sam­
pling, but for the current year Baker used a statistical sample in the tests of controls 
to eliminate the need for judgment.
	
	
	 	
Baker wanted to assess control risk at a low level, so a tolerable deviation rate of 
20 percent was established. To estimate the population deviation rate and the computed 
upper deviation rate, Baker decided to apply an attribute sampling technique that would 
use an expected population deviation rate of 3 percent for the 8,000 shipping documents 
and to defer consideration of the allowable risk of assessing control risk too low until 
the sample results were evaluated. Baker used the tolerable deviation rate, the popula­
tion size, and the expected population deviation rate to determine that a sample size of 

298	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
80 would be sufficient. When it was subsequently determined that the actual population 
was about 10,000 shipping documents, Baker increased the sample size to 100.
	
	
	 	
Baker’s objective was to ascertain whether Mill’s shipments had been properly 
billed. Baker took a sample of 100 invoices by selecting the first 25 invoices from the 
first month of each quarter. Baker then compared the invoices to the corresponding 
prenumbered shipping documents.
	
	
	 	
When Baker tested the sample, eight deviations were discovered. Additionally, 
one shipment that should have been billed at $10,443 was actually billed at $10,434. 
Baker considered this $9 to be immaterial and did not count it as an error.
	
	
	 	
In evaluating the sample results, Baker made the initial determination that a 
5 percent risk of assessing control risk too low was desired and, using the appropri­
ate statistical sampling table, determined that for eight observed deviations from a 
sample size of 100, the computed upper deviation rate was 14 percent. Baker then 
calculated the allowance for sampling risk to be 5 percent, the difference between 
the actual sample deviation rate (8 percent) and the expected error rate (3 percent). 
Baker reasoned that the actual sample deviation rate (8 percent) plus the allow­
ance for sampling risk (5 percent) was less than the computed upper deviation rate 
(14 percent); therefore, the sample supported a low level of control risk.
Required:
	
	
	 Describe each incorrect assumption, statement, and inappropriate application of 
attribute sampling in Baker’s procedures.

Audit Sampling: An Application to 
Substantive Tests of Account Balances
T
his chapter demonstrates the application of audit sampling to substan­
tive tests of details of account balances. In Chapter 8, attribute sampling 
was used to determine whether controls were operating effectively and 
could therefore be relied on by the auditor to generate accurate accounting 
information. Thus, the objective of attribute sampling was to determine the reli­
ability of the entity’s controls. In this chapter, the purpose of the sampling appli­
cation is to determine if a financial statement account is fairly stated.
Two statistical sampling techniques, monetary-unit sampling and classical 
variables sampling, and a nonstatistical sampling technique are demonstrated 
in this chapter. While both statistical sampling methods can provide sufficient, 
appropriate evidence, a monetary-unit sample may be more practical for most 
audit applications. The chapter starts with an introduction of monetary-unit 
sampling and an extended example. Nonstatistical sampling is then covered. 
Advanced Module 1 contains a discussion and example of classical variables 
sampling.

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
Sampling for Substantive Tests of Details  
of Account Balances
The basic statistical concepts discussed in Chapter 8 are also applicable for sampling 
approaches used to test account balances. As with attribute sampling, three important deter­
minants of sample size for testing account balances are desired confidence level, tolerable 
misstatement, and estimated misstatement. Unlike attribute sampling in Chapter 8, population 
size does influence sampling computations when testing monetary account balances. Mis­
statements discovered in the audit sample testing an account balance must be projected to the 
population, and there must be an allowance for sampling risk.
In the preface to Chapter 8, we asked you to imagine that you were an apple inspector. We 
did this to illustrate some of the basic concepts of audit sampling before covering the techni­
cal details. Before we get into the details of audit sampling for substantive tests, we want you 
to use your developing professional judgment and understanding of sampling to evaluate the 
sampling results related to a test of the inventory balance provided below. Suppose the mis­
statement of $2,000 represents differences between the auditor’s inventory test count and the 
amount in the entity’s records based on the entity’s inventory counting procedures:
LO 9-1
Book value of the inventory account balance
$3,000,000
Book value of items sampled
$    100,000
Audited value of items sampled
$     98,000
  Total amount of misstatement observed in audit sample
$       2,000
The purpose of audit sampling is to draw inferences about the entire population (the reported 
inventory account balance in the example above) from the results of a sample.
Stop and Think: Using just the information provided above, what is your best estimate 
of the misstatement in the inventory account balance?
In Chapter 8 our best estimate of the population deviation rate for control testing was the sam­
ple deviation rate. Similarly, when using audit sampling to test account balances, we will want 
to project the misstatement observed in the sample to the population. In the example above, 
the observed misstatement could be projected to the population by computing the ratio of mis­
statement to the total dollars sampled: 2 percent ($2,000 ÷ $100,000). Applying this ratio to 
the entire account balance produces a best estimate or projected misstatement in the inventory 
account of $60,000 (2% × $3,000,000). If your best estimate is that the account is overstated 
by $60,000, do you believe the account is fairly stated? The answer to this question, like many 
questions in auditing, is “it depends.” It depends in part on the amount of misstatement that 
can be tolerated for the inventory account. If the amount of misstatement that can be tolerated 
for this account is $50,000, then we cannot conclude that the account is fairly stated because 
our best estimate (or projected misstatement) is higher than the amount we can tolerate. What 
if tolerable misstatement were $110,000; would you conclude that the account is fairly stated? 
The answer is again, “it depends.” Whenever sampling is used, the evaluation must include 
an allowance for sampling risk. When sampling is used to estimate monetary misstatement, a 
confidence bound or limit must be established as an allowance for sampling risk. In the above 
example, the misstatement in the population could be $60,000, but it also might be higher or 
lower because the estimate is based on a sample. If tolerable misstatement is $110,000, and 
the upper limit on the account’s possible misstatement is less than $110,000, then the account 
is considered fairly stated. The size of the upper limit on misstatement is largely dependent 
on the sample size, which is also directly related to the desired confidence level. This is 
an important concept—the uncertainty inherent in sampling, sampling risk, decreases as the 
sample size increases.

303
You may remember from your statistics courses using concepts such as a “standard devi­
ation” and a “normal distribution” (i.e., Z scores or confidence coefficients) to compute con­
fidence limits and intervals. This traditional statistical approach is used for classical variables 
sampling, which is covered in Advanced Module 1. In response to the difficult mathematical 
calculations involved in classical variable sampling and due to other limitations discussed 
later, auditors developed an audit sampling approach for testing balances called monetary-unit 
sampling. Monetary-unit sampling is based on attribute-sampling concepts. While the compu­
tations involved in classical variables sampling can now easily be performed with a personal 
computer or handheld calculator, auditors have found that monetary-unit sampling provides 
other important advantages. However, monetary-unit sampling is not the best approach for all 
substantive tests of details; therefore, in this chapter we also cover nonstatistical sampling and 
classical variables sampling.
Monetary-Unit Sampling
Monetary-unit sampling (MUS) is based on attribute-sampling theory modified to express a 
monetary conclusion rather than a rate of occurrence. MUS was developed by auditors to over­
come the computational complexity of other statistical sampling techniques and because most 
accounting populations contain relatively little misstatement. Classical variables sampling is 
not very effective in dealing with populations with little or no misstatement (see Advanced 
Module 1). Recent research indicates that account balances sampled by auditors typically do 
have low error rates.1 MUS is commonly used by auditors to test accounts such as accounts 
receivable, loans receivable, investment securities, and inventory. While MUS is based on 
­attribute-sampling theory, the fact that MUS is designed to test monetary amounts (e.g., dol­
lars, yen, pesos) rather than internal control effectiveness causes important differences in these 
techniques. The differences are driven by the characteristics of control deviations and monetary 
misstatements. In attribute sampling, the control either works or it does not. Thus, all items 
sampled either do or do not represent a deviation. Attribute sampling provides an estimate and 
upper limit on the percentage of the time that a control is failing. With MUS, the sampling item 
tested may be valid and posted to the correct account in the correct period, but the dollar 
amount may not be accurately recorded. For instance, an invoice for $2,565 might be entered 
into the accounting system as $2,655. In this case there is a misstatement, but the misstatement 
is only about 3.5 percent of the transaction. A direct application of attribute sampling to mon­
etary items would treat all misstatements as deviations, or 100 percent misstatements. How­
ever, doing so would not result in a useful estimate of the monetary misstatement in the 
population. MUS begins with attribute-sampling concepts as a foundation but takes into con­
sideration misstatement amounts observed in each sampling unit when computing the best esti­
mate of the population misstatement and formulating the confidence limits around this 
estimated misstatement. Over the years academics, audit firms, and software programmers 
(e.g., IDEA) have developed slightly different MUS approaches and enhancements. However, 
the underlying concepts in all MUS approaches are similar to those discussed in this chapter.
To summarize, the basic underlying concepts of MUS are straightforward. MUS uses 
attribute-sampling theory to estimate the percentage of monetary units in a population that 
might be misstated (like a sample deviation rate) and then multiplies this percentage by an 
estimate of how much the dollars are misstated. Keep these basic concepts in mind as you 
study MUS in this chapter.
MUS is designed primarily to test for overstatement errors. However, it can accommo­
date understatement errors if special considerations are made during the evaluation of the 
sample results. MUS is most appropriate for low-error-rate populations because it provides as 
effective a test as classical variables sampling does but has a more efficient sample size. Fol­
lowing are some advantages and disadvantages of MUS.

Advantages
	
∙	 MUS does not require the user to make any assumptions about the distribution of 
misstatements, whereas classical variables sampling (see Advanced Module 1) relies 
on normal distribution theory and requires an estimate of the variation (or standard 
deviation) of misstatements in the population.
	
∙	 When the auditor expects little to no misstatements, it is more difficult to determine 
sample size using classical variables sampling given the need to assume a distribution 
of misstatements. In the absence of misstatements, a conservative surrogate is used 
in classical variable sampling (see Advanced Module 1). In situations with little or no 
misstatement, MUS usually results in a smaller sample size than classical variables 
sampling.
	
∙	 When applied using a probability-proportional-to-size sample selection procedure 
as outlined in this text, MUS automatically results in a stratified sample because 
sampled items are selected in proportion to their dollar amounts. Thus, larger dollar 
items have a higher probability of being selected. With classical variables sampling, 
the population must be stratified in order to focus on larger items.
Disadvantages
	
∙	 The selection of zero or negative balances generally requires special design 
consideration. For example, if examining zero balances is important (searching for 
unrecorded liabilities in accounts payable), the auditor must test those items separately 
because such items will not be selected using a probability-proportional-to-size 
selection method. Alternatively, if an account such as accounts receivable contains 
credit balances, the auditor should segregate those items and test them separately.
	
∙	 When more than a few misstatements are detected using an MUS approach, the 
sample results calculations as shown in the textbook may overstate the allowance for 
sampling risk. This occurs because the methods used to determine the amount of 
misstatement are conservative. Thus, an auditor is more likely to reject an acceptable 
recorded book value and overaudit.2
Applying Monetary-Unit Sampling
In Chapter 8 the general considerations when using sampling for substantive tests were 
discussed along with the steps in a sampling application. In conducting MUS for substan­
tive tests of details of account balances, the auditor follows the same basic steps outlined in 
­Chapter 8 for attribute sampling. Table 9–1 lists each step by the three phases in the sampling 
application. Again, the auditor is required to use substantial judgment and should adequately 
document the sampling application in the audit working papers.
Planning
Step 1: Determine the Test Objectives  Audit sampling is most often used in substantive 
testing to test the hypothesis that a financial statement account is fairly stated.3 The objective 
of MUS for substantive tests of details is to test the assertion that no material misstatements 
exist in an account balance, a class of transactions, or a disclosure component of the financial 
statements.
2There are alternative methods that overcome this disadvantage. However, these methods are more complex. See D. 
A. Leslie, A. D. Teitlebaum, and R. J. Anderson, Dollar Unit Sampling: A Practical Guide for Auditors (Toronto: 
Copp, Clark and Pitman, 1979), and W. L. Felix, Jr., R. A. Grimlund, F. J. Koster, and R. S. Roussey, Arthur Ander-
sen’s New Monetary-Unit Sampling Approach, Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory (Fall 1990), pp. 116, for a 
discussion of alternative approaches.
3A less common use for sampling is to estimate the size of the misstatement in an account that is known to contain a 
substantial misstatement. The development of such an estimate may be part of a consulting engagement or to provide 
supporting evidence related to an entity’s misstatement estimate. The discussion in this chapter is limited to using 
audit sampling to test the assertion that an account or monetary population is fairly stated.

	
Chapter 9    Audit Sampling: An Application to Substantive Tests of Account Balances	
305
Step 2: Define the Population Characteristics  To achieve the test objectives, the audi­
tor must carefully consider the characteristics of the sampling population.
Define the Population.  The auditor must define the population so that the selected sample 
is appropriate for the assertions being tested, because sample results can be projected only to 
the population from which the sample was selected. For example, if the auditor is concerned 
about goods shipped but not billed, the population of shipping documents rather than sales 
invoices is the appropriate population for drawing the sample.
For MUS, the population is defined as the monetary value of an account balance, such 
as accounts receivable, investment securities, or inventory. As with attribute sampling, once 
the population has been defined, the auditor must determine that the physical representation, 
or frame, of the population is complete. For example, if the auditor is testing the accounts 
receivable account, he or she would foot the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger and agree 
the total to the general ledger account to verify the completeness of the frame. Because the 
auditor selects the sample from the frame, any conclusions about the population relate only 
to that frame, which is the physical representation of the population. If the frame and the 
intended sampling population differ, the auditor might very well draw an incorrect conclusion 
about the population.
Practice 
INSIGHT
When applying audit sampling as a detailed test, it is important to properly link the desired level of 
assurance or confidence from the sample to the achieved level of controls reliance for the related 
account and assertion. Inspectors find that audit samples used as substantive tests are sometimes 
designed based on the planned level of reliance on controls; however, inspectors sometimes find 
evidence of control deficiencies in the audit working papers and in such cases the planned level of 
reliance would not be supported. As a result, inspectors may conclude that the audit sample used 
for the substantive test was too small and resulted in insufficient audit evidence being gathered (see, 
for example, PCAOB Release 104-201-273).

Define the Sampling Unit.  With MUS, an individual dollar represents the sampling unit. In 
fact, this is where monetary-unit (or dollar-unit) sampling gets its name. For example, if the 
population to be sampled is the accounts receivable balance of $2.5 million, then there are 
2.5 million sampling units in the population. However, because the accounts receivable bal­
ance is organized by customer or transaction (e.g., customer account or invoice number) and 
not by individual dollars, the auditor does not audit the individual dollar but rather the customer 
account or transaction that contains the selected dollar. In other words, while the sampling unit 

306	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
is an individual dollar in a customer account (or invoice), the auditor can’t very well audit a 
single dollar; instead, the auditor will audit the entire customer account (or transaction) that 
contains the selected dollar. The customer account or transaction that contains the selected dol­
lar is called the logical unit. In essence, by selecting a dollar contained in a customer account 
(or transaction), the auditor by extension selects the logical unit that contains the selected mon­
etary unit to audit. If the difference between a sampling unit and a logical unit is not entirely 
clear to you, don’t worry, we illustrate these concepts in the extended example below.
Define a Misstatement.  For MUS, a misstatement is defined as the difference between mon­
etary amounts in the entity’s records and amounts supported by audit evidence. A clear mis­
statement definition is important because definitions that are too narrow or too broad may 
result in inefficient or ineffective testing. For example, if an accounts receivable ­confirmation 
letter from a customer reports a difference between the customer records and the entity’s 
records, it would not be considered a misstatement if the difference is explainable and support­
able by the circumstances, such as timing differences (e.g., the customer mistakenly confirms 
a balance as of January 31 when the confirmation letter requests the customer’s balance as 
of the December 31 year-end) and other documentation supports the entity’s recorded value.
Step 3: Determine the Sample Size  Considerable judgment is required in determining 
the appropriate values for the inputs used to compute an MUS sample size. The following four 
factors must be considered.
Desired Confidence Level or Acceptable Risk of Incorrect Acceptance.  There is a direct 
relationship between the confidence level and sample size. The basic idea is fairly simple: to 
increase confidence, more work is required, which is reflected in a larger sample size. Confi­
dence level and the risk of incorrect acceptance are complements. If the auditor wants to be 
95 percent confident in the sampling conclusion, then he or she must be willing to accept a 
5 percent risk of incorrect acceptance. The risk of incorrect acceptance is the risk that the 
sample supports the conclusion that the recorded account balance is fairly stated when in fact 
it is not (a Type II error). This risk relates to the effectiveness of the audit. In determining an 
acceptable risk of incorrect acceptance, the auditor should consider the components of the 
audit risk model: the acceptable level of audit risk and risk of material misstatement. For prac­
tical purposes, the acceptable risk of incorrect acceptance is the same as detection risk (DR) 
after considering the assessed level of detection risk based on other substantive procedures 
such as substantive analytical procedures. If the auditor incorrectly accepts an account balance 
as being fairly stated when it is actually materially misstated, he or she will allow the issuance 
of financial statements that are not fairly presented. The users of those financial statements 
may then sue the auditor for damages that result from relying on those financial statements. 
There is an inverse relationship between the risk of incorrect acceptance and sample size. The 
lower the acceptable risk of incorrect acceptance, the larger the sample size must be.
Tolerable Misstatement.  Tolerable misstatement is the maximum amount by which the 
account can be misstated and still be acceptable to the auditor as being fairly presented. It 
will always be less than overall materiality. In Chapter 3 we illustrated how overall material­
ity and tolerable misstatement are determined. Remember from Chapter 3 that for an audit to 
be economically feasible, the auditor and users of the financial statements must tolerate some 
margin for misstatement (i.e., the auditor provides reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are fair, not absolute assurance that the financial statements are error-free).
Audit sampling techniques designed to test the assertion that an account is fairly stated 
cannot be performed unless tolerable misstatement exceeds expected misstatement by a suffi­
cient amount, because there must always be room for an allowance for sampling risk between 
the two measures. Tolerable misstatement is also inversely related to sample size—the lower 
the amount of tolerable misstatement, the more precise the test the auditor needs, and the 
larger the sample size must be.

	
Chapter 9    Audit Sampling: An Application to Substantive Tests of Account Balances	
307
Expected Misstatement.  The expected misstatement is the dollar amount of misstatement 
that the auditor believes exists in the population. The auditor can develop this expectation 
based on the assessment of inherent risk, prior years’ results, a pilot sample, the results of 
related substantive procedures, or the results of tests of controls. As the expected misstate­
ment approaches the tolerable misstatement, the auditor needs more precise information from 
the sample. Therefore, there is a direct relationship to sample size: the larger the expected 
misstatement, the larger the sample size must be.
Population Size.  Population size is directly related to sample size. Because MUS popula­
tions are made up of individual dollars, populations tested with MUS are usually large. As 
such, some MUS approaches, like the one we demonstrate below using the attributes tables in 
Chapter 8, do not use population size directly as an input for sample size determination, but 
population size is used in the conversion of tolerable and expected misstatements to percent­
ages, which does influence sample size. However, for approaches like the one used in IDEA, 
population size is a direct input to determine sample size.
Table 9–2 summarizes the effects of the four factors on sample size.
Computing Sample Sizes Using the Attribute-Sampling Tables
A monetary-unit sample size can be determined by using the attribute sample size tables shown 
in Chapter 8. The auditor first determines the desired confidence level and then converts the 
tolerable misstatement and the expected misstatement to percentages of the book value of the 
balance tested. For example, suppose the auditor has established a tolerable misstatement of 
$125,000 and an expected misstatement of $25,000 for an accounts receivable account with 
a book value of $2,500,000. The tolerable misstatement would be 5 percent ($125,000 ÷ 
$2,500,000), and the expected misstatement would be 1 percent ($25,000 ÷ $2,500,000). If 
the desired confidence level is 95 percent (or a risk of incorrect acceptance of 5 percent), the 
auditor would use Table 8–5 in Chapter 8. In this example, the sample size is 93. Be sure you 
can identify how the sample size was determined using Table 8–5 before moving on.
Computing Sample Sizes Using IDEA
Software programs like IDEA can also be used to determine sample size. Exhibit 9–1 shows 
the computation of sample size for the previous example using IDEA. To compute sample 
size with IDEA, the auditor opens a database (for sample size calculations, it can be any data­
base file) and on the “Analysis” tab, in the “Sample” group the auditor clicks on “Monetary 
Unit,” and then on “Plan.” The Monetary Unit Sampling - Plan window is displayed and the 
auditor enters the relevant data. The auditor unchecks the box “Use values from database 
field” and enters “2500000” for “Value of the sampled population,” “95” for “Confidence

mate” button at the top of the window. Note that with IDEA the auditor can enter tolerable 
and expected misstatement in either dollars or percentage terms. The result is a sample size of 
90, which is a slightly smaller sample than the size determined using the tables.4 Advanced 
Module 2 in this chapter provides a chart comparing the terminology used by IDEA to com­
pute sample size and the terminology using the manual approach.
Performance
Step 4: Select Sample Items  In drawing the sample items, the auditor attempts to select the 
sample in such a way that it accurately represents the population. The auditor selects a sample 
for MUS by using a systematic selection approach called probability-proportional-to-size selec­
tion, often with the help of a computer program such as IDEA. Probability-proportional-to-size 
sample selection uses a sampling interval to select sample items. In other words, after a ran­
dom start, subsequent items are selected by adding the interval as illustrated below. By using 
the interval value in the sample selection process, larger logical units have a higher probability 
of being selected. The sampling interval can be determined by dividing the book value of the 
population by the sample size. Keep in mind that MUS defines an individual dollar (or other 
monetary unit) as the sampling unit. Because the first sampling item is randomly selected within 
the first interval, each individual dollar in the population has an equal chance of being selected. 
Figure 9–1 provides an example of how probability-proportional-to-size selection is applied.
In Figure 9–1, the total book value of the entity’s accounts receivable balance is 
$2,500,000, and the auditor determined a sample size of 93. The sampling interval will be 
$26,882 ($2,500,000 ÷ 93). To select a probability-proportional-to-size sample, the auditor 
arranges the entity’s accounts receivable records in some order (e.g., by customer number or 
alphabetically) and then creates a column of cumulative dollars. In Figure 9–1, the customer 
records are arranged by customer number. The auditor obtains a random number between 1

in a slightly smaller sample size from IDEA (see footnote 6).

and the size of the sampling interval ($26,882) by using computer software such as IDEA or 
MS Excel. The random number becomes the first sample item selected, and then the sampling 
interval is added to determine the second sampling item and so on for every 26,882nd dollar 
in the population. In the example illustrated in Figure 9–1, the random start is $3,977, and the 
customer account that contains the 3,977th dollar is selected for testing. In this case, Admin­
gton Hospital, with a balance of $15,495, is selected for testing. The auditor then adds the 
sampling interval, either manually or with the aid of a computer program, through the popula­
tion and selects each logical unit that contains the computed amount.5 Following this process, 
the second customer account selected would be Good Hospital Corp., which contains the 
30,859th dollar ($3,977 + 26,882) and has a balance of $21,893. The third account would be 
Axa Corporation, which contains the 57,741st dollar ($30,859 + 26,882), and so on until the 
entire population has been subjected to sampling and 93 units have been selected.
The advantage of using this approach to select the sample is that while each dollar in the 
population has an equal chance of being selected, logical units containing more dollars have 
a higher chance of being selected, hence the name “probability-proportional-to-size” sample 
selection. Note that all logical units with a book value larger than the sampling interval (such 
as Axa Corporation and Lilly Health, Inc.) are certain to be selected using this method. From 
an audit perspective, this approach guarantees that all individually significant accounts are 
examined and that, in general, the sample will be made up of larger accounts. This approach 
is particularly appropriate when the auditor is primarily concerned about overstatements and 
larger overstatements are expected to be found in larger logical units (such as with accounts 
receivable). If the auditor is primarily concerned about understatements or unrecorded 
amounts, other selection techniques (e.g., random or specific identification) should be used.
Stop and Think: In the example in Figure 9–1, what is the probability that customer 
1213, Andrew Call Medical (with a zero balance), will be selected?
The probability that a customer with a zero balance will be selected using systematic selection 
of monetary values is zero because there are no monetary units to select.
When the logical unit, a customer account in this example, exceeds the sampling interval, 
more than one sampling unit may be selected from the same logical unit. If this happens, the

to-size sample.

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
logical unit is included only once when the sample results are evaluated. Thus, the number of 
logical units examined may be less than the computed sample size, which is another advan­
tage of this selection technique. In fact, once the auditor has used the computed sample size 
to determine an interval, the computed sample size is not used again in an MUS application. 
As you will see later, rather than use the computed sample size in the evaluation of results, the 
auditor uses the sampling interval.
Step 5: Perform the Audit Procedures  After the sample items have been selected, the 
auditor conducts the planned audit procedures on the logical units containing the selected sam­
pling units. In some instances, the auditor may not be able to conduct the planned procedures 
on a particular logical unit (e.g., customer account). This may occur, for example, because a 
supporting document is missing. Unless other evidence is available, such items should be con­
sidered misstatements. The auditor must also be careful to conduct the audit procedures so as 
to avoid nonsampling errors caused by carelessness, poor supervision, or mistaken judgment. 
After all the audit procedures have been completed, the auditor evaluates the sample results.
Evaluation
Step 6: Calculate the Projected Misstatement and the Upper Limit on Misstate­
ment  The misstatements detected in the sample must be projected to the population. As 
mentioned earlier, an MUS application is designed primarily to test for overstatement errors. 
The projection of the errors to the population is referred to as the projected misstatement 
(IDEA refers to this as the most likely error); it is comparable to the sample deviation rate or 
best estimate in Chapter 8. The auditor calculates an allowance for sampling risk and adds it to 
the projected misstatement. The total of the projected misstatement and the allowance for sam­
pling risk is referred to as the upper misstatement limit (IDEA refers to this as the upper error 
limit; see Advanced Module 2 for IDEA terminology). These computations are somewhat 
involved, so rather than talk about them in abstract terms, we explain them using an example.
An Extended Example  An example is used to demonstrate the computation and ­evaluation 
of projected and upper misstatement limit (UML) of a monetary-unit sampling application. 
The following information relates to the audit of an entity’s accounts receivable balance:
LO 9-3
Example Information
 • Book value = $2,500,000
 • Tolerable misstatement = $125,000
 • Sample size = 93
 • Desired confidence level = 95%
 • Expected amount of misstatement = $25,000
 • Sampling interval = $26,882
The calculations of sample size and sampling interval using the attribute sampling 
tables were shown previously. Assume that, based on the auditor’s understanding of the busi­
ness and previous experience auditing this account, the auditor is primarily concerned with 
overstatements.
Basic Precision  As you learned in Chapter 8 with attribute sampling, even when the audi­
tor observes no control deviations, the allowance for sampling risk still results in a computed 
upper deviation limit. The same is true for MUS; if no misstatements are found in the sample, 
the projection or best estimate of the population misstatement would be zero dollars. However, 
even with zero projected misstatements, an allowance for sampling risk must be computed, 
which will result in an upper misstatement limit that is greater than zero. This allowance for 
sampling risk when no misstatements are observed is referred to as the basic precision. If the 
appropriate sample size was computed and was then used to derive the sampling interval and 
no misstatements were found in the logical units tested, then the upper misstatement limit will 
be less than or equal to the tolerable misstatement used to compute the sample size.

In evaluating MUS results, the sampling interval and the desired level of confidence are 
two of the important factors, along with the MUS misstatement factors in Table 9–3 (see foot­
note 4). In the example, the sampling interval is $26,882 and the desired level of confidence 
is 95 percent. For basic precision, use the factor associated with zero misstatements in Table 
9–3. The misstatement factor is 3.0. The upper misstatement limit (and basic precision) is 
thus $80,646 (3.0 × $26,882). The basic precision essentially assumes any undetected mis­
statements in the population are misstated by 100 percent. This is a conservative assumption, 
but it is justified because the potential cost of underestimating the amount of misstatement in 
an entity’s financial statements is very high.
In practice, auditors use firm-specific MUS guidance or software programs like IDEA to 
determine MUS sample sizes and to evaluate MUS results. Although firms and software devel­
opers use different algorithms and assumptions in computing MUS misstatement limits, the 
underlying theory and ultimate conclusions are similar. We demonstrate how to manually com­
plete the calculations, which will help you better understand output from packages like IDEA.
Misstatements Detected  Assume that the auditor sent confirmations to the customers 
selected from the entity’s accounts receivable account using a sampling interval of $26,882 
as illustrated in Figure 9–1 and that all but four customers returned confirmations indicating 
the entity’s records are correct. Based on document inspection and inquiry of management, 
the four detected misstatements appear to be unintentional processing errors. For example, 
discounts granted were not recorded or in the case of Learn Heart Centers the merchandise 
was returned prior to year-end, but the credit was not processed until the subsequent period. 
The following table lists the misstatements detected:

6The misstatement factors in Table 9–3 are based on computed upper deviation rate factors used in attribute sampling 
(based on the binomial distribution). In MUS, the sampling interval and the tainting factor are used in the evalua­
tion, and as later illustrated, the original computed sample size is not used in the evaluation approach when using 
the attribute sampling tables. When the population is large and the misstatement rate is low (both common for MUS 
applications using accounting data), the limiting form of the binomial distribution is the Poisson distribution, which 
only requires the level of confidence to determine the appropriate misstatement factor to compute the upper misstate­
ment limit (see Leslie et al., 1979, Dollar Unit Sampling). The Poisson distribution factors are nearly identical to the 
misstatement factors in Table 9–3.

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
Overstatement Misstatements Detected  If misstatements are found in the sample, the 
auditor needs to calculate a projected or likely misstatement and an allowance for sampling 
risk. Because in an MUS sample each selected dollar “represents” a group of dollars in the 
population, the percentage of misstatement in the logical unit represents the percentage of 
misstatement in the sampling interval from which the dollar was selected. Three types of situ­
ations can occur with detected misstatements.
	
1.	 The logical unit is equal to or greater than the sampling interval. In this situation, 
the projected misstatement is equal to the actual misstatement detected in the 
logical unit. For example, the Axa Corporation account in Figure 9–1 contained 
a balance of $32,549, which is larger than the sampling interval of $26,882. In 
the example, the projected misstatement associated with this account would be 
$2,500, and no sampling risk is added. No allowance for sampling risk is necessary 
for these large accounts because all accounts larger than the sampling interval 
will automatically be selected by an MUS sampling approach using probability-
proportional-to-size selection. Since all the dollars in the large accounts are audited, 
there is no risk of additional potential misstatement associated with large accounts 
(logical units).
	
2.	 The logical unit’s book value is less than the sampling interval, and it is misstated 
by less than 100 percent. This is the most common situation. The percentage of 
misstatement in the logical unit is referred to as the tainting factor. The tainting 
factor is calculated using the following formula:
Tainting factor  =  ​ Book value − Audit value 
 
_____________________ 
 
Book value 
​
	
	 For example, the Good Hospital Corp. account is overstated by $3,284. Thus, the 
tainting factor for the account would be .15 [(21,893 - 18,609) ÷ 21,893]. The 
projected misstatement for the interval containing this logical unit would be $4,032 
(.15 × $26,882). The tainting factor associated with the interval containing the Marva 
Medical Supply account is .40 ($2,682 ÷ $6,705), and the projected misstatement 
for the interval is $10,753 (.40 × $26,882). An allowance for sampling risk would be 
added to these projected misstatements as illustrated below.
	
3.	 The book value of the logical unit is less than the sampling interval, and it is 
100 percent misstated. Because the logical unit represents the group of dollars in 
the sampling interval, the sampling interval is assumed to be 100 percent in error. 
In the above example, the audited value for Learn Heart Centers is $0. The projected 
error for the interval containing this logical unit is $26,882, which is determined 
by multiplying the percentage misstated (100 percent) by the size of the sampling 
interval ($26,882). An allowance for sampling risk would be added to this amount as 
illustrated below.
Computing Upper Misstatement Limit Manually
To compute the upper misstatement limit (UML), the auditor first computes basic pre­
cision and then ranks the detected misstatements based on the size of the tainting factor 
from the largest tainting factor to the smallest. Projected and upper misstatement limits are 
computed using the computed tainting factor and the appropriate misstatement factor from 
Table 9–3. Finally, misstatements detected in logical units greater than the sampling interval 
are added.
The UML in this case is $150,621 and is calculated as follows. First, basic precision, 
$80,646, is computed by multiplying the sampling interval by the misstatement factor from 
Table 9–3, ($26,882 × 3.0). The $80,646 represents the sampling risk that exists even if no 
misstatements are observed in the sample. Remember, because we are basing our conclusions 
on a sample, we cannot be sure there are no misstatements in the population even if we find 
none in the sample.

	
Chapter 9    Audit Sampling: An Application to Substantive Tests of Account Balances	
313
Second, logical units smaller than the interval where misstatements are detected, Learn 
Heart Centers, Marva Medical, and Good Hospital, are ranked according to the size of their 
tainting factor from largest to smallest.
Third, the projected misstatements for Learn Heart Centers, Marva Medical, and Good 
Hospital are calculated. Projected misstatement is computed by multiplying the sampling 
interval by the tainting factor (column 2 × column 3). This calculation is based on the assump­
tion that the dollar selected for testing represents the sampling interval. In turn, it is assumed 
that the extent of misstatement in the logical unit that contains the sampled dollar represents 
the amount of misstatement in the sampling interval.
Next, for the intervals containing the Learn Heart Centers, Marva Medical, and Good 
Hospital accounts, an allowance for sampling risk is added to the projected misstatement by 
multiplying the projected misstatement by the incremental change in the misstatement factor 
for the desired confidence level. In this example, the desired confidence is 95 percent, so the 
misstatement factors are taken from the appropriate column in Table 9–3. For basic precision, 
the factor, 3.0, is taken from the “Misstatement Factor” column of Table 9–3 (95 percent con­
fidence) because it is the first “layer” of the UML calculation.
For the first misstatement observed, Learn Heart Centers, the misstatement factor from 
Table 9–3 (95 percent confidence) is 4.7. However, the misstatement factors in Table 9–3 are 
cumulative. In other words, the factor for 1 misstatement, 4.7, includes the sampling risk asso­
ciated with zero misstatements (i.e., it includes the misstatement factor 3.0). Since basic preci­
sion already includes the factor for zero misstatements, only the increase or increment is used 
for the first misstatement, and likewise for subsequent misstatements. The incremental change 
is calculated by simply subtracting the misstatement factor for the current number of misstate­
ments from the factor for the previous number of misstatements (i.e., 4.7 - 3.0 = 1.7). Thus, for 
Good Hospital, the projected misstatement is $4,032, and the UML is $5,645 (1.4 × $4,032) 
as illustrated in the table above. The difference between the projected misstatement and the 
UML is the allowance for sampling risk. Thus, the allowance for sampling risk for Good Hos­
pital is $1,613 ($5,645 - $4,032).
Ranking the logical units by their tainting factors leads to a UML that is conservative 
because the largest tainting factor is multiplied by the largest incremental change in the mis­
statement factor. This conservative approach means there is a higher risk that an acceptable 
account balance will be rejected by the auditor.
Finally, misstatements detected in logical units that are greater than the sampling inter­
val are added to the upper limit. As noted earlier, the reason misstatements from logical 
units greater than the sampling interval do not require projection or the consideration of 
sampling risk is because all accounts larger than the sampling interval will automatically be 
selected by a probability-proportional-to-size sampling approach. Since all the dollars in the 
large accounts are audited, there is no sampling risk associated with large accounts (logical 
units). Thus, in the example above, the misstatement detected in Axa Corp.’s balance, $2,500

($32,549 - $30,049), is simply added to the upper misstatement. Similarly, the misstatement 
in Axa Corp is added to the other projected error amounts to come up with total projected 
misstatement of $44,167.
Step 7: Draw Final Conclusions  For this example, the final decision on whether the 
accounts receivable balance is materially misstated is made by comparing the tolerable mis­
statement to the UML. If the UML is less than or equal to the tolerable misstatement, the 
evidence supports the conclusion that the account balance is not materially misstated. In this 
case the UML of $150,621 is more than the tolerable misstatement of $125,000. Because the 
UML exceeds the tolerable misstatement of $125,000, the auditor has evidence that there is 
an unacceptably high risk that accounts receivable is materially misstated.
The auditor now has four options. First, the sample size can be increased. While this 
approach is possible in theory, it is not practical in many audit settings. Second, other substan­
tive procedures can be performed. This approach might be followed if the auditor’s qualitative 
analysis of the detected misstatements indicates that there is a systematic problem with the 
population. For example, the auditor might determine that three of the misstatements occurred 
in the pricing of one particular product line sold by the entity. In this instance, he or she might 
design a substantive procedure that examines the pricing of all sales in that product line. Third, 
the auditor can request that management adjust the accounts receivable balance. In our exam­
ple, the minimum adjustment would be $25,621 ($150,621 - $125,000). If the entity adjusts 
the account by $25,621, the UML will be equal to or less than the tolerable misstatement at a 
5 percent risk of incorrect acceptance. Finally, if the entity refuses to adjust the account, the 
auditor would issue a qualified or adverse opinion (this situation would be extremely rare).
Table 9–4 illustrates the risks auditors face when evaluating an account balance based 
on sample evidence. If the evidence supports the fairness of the account balance based on the 
sample evidence and the account is not materially misstated, the auditor has made a correct 
decision. If the evidence does not support the fairness of the account based on the sample 
evidence and the account is materially misstated, a correct decision has also been made. The 
other two combinations result in decision errors by the auditor. If the evidence does not sup­
port the fairness of the account when it is in reality not materially misstated (Type I error), the 
auditor will have incorrectly rejected the account. This can lead to overauditing and an inef­
ficient audit. If the evidence supports the account as fairly stated when the account actually 
contains a material misstatement, the auditor will have incorrectly accepted the account (Type 
II error). Keep in mind, however, that the auditor almost never finds out the “true” account 
balance unless later events, such as lawsuits against the auditor for issuing a report on mis­
leading financial statements, require an examination of the entire population.
Computing Projected Misstatement and Upper Error Limit Using IDEA
Exhibit 9–2 shows the evaluation of the sample results using IDEA software and the sample 
size computed in Exhibit 9–1. The Upper Error Limit is $146,473 and the Most Likely Error 
is $45,189. To use IDEA to evaluate sample results the auditor must have the underlying 
IDEA data file open containing the book value and audit value of the sampled items. The 
IDEA evaluation interface is somewhat complex and is not illustrated here; however,

opportunities to evaluate MUS sample results using IDEA are included in the IDEA problems 
available on Connect. In comparing the manually computed projected error, $44,167, and the 
manually computed UML, $150,621 (illustrated earlier using the attribute sampling tables), to 
IDEA’s projected error and upper error limit, we see the values are similar but not identical.

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
As illustrated in the bottom of Exhibit 9–2, IDEA uses a different underlying statistical distri­
bution to estimate misstatement factors than does the manual approach illustrated earlier. 
Advanced Module 2 in this chapter provides a chart comparing the terminology used by IDEA 
and the terminology used when using the tables to evaluate MUS test results.7
7The warning at the bottom of the IDEA output screen refers to how “High Value” items are handled in the evalua-
tion. When there are very large items that may be selected multiple times by using the sampling interval and system-
atic selection, IDEA’s technical literature provides alternative approaches to handle such cases.
8See Leslie et al., 1979, Dollar Unit Sampling. Alternative approaches are also used in practice. For example, if the 
direction of the errors in the population is unknown, a two-sided confidence interval can be constructed by separat-
ing the understatements and calculating a lower limit on misstatements. See A. D. Bailey, Jr., Statistical Auditing: 
Review, Concepts, and Problems (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1981), for a discussion of this approach.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Audit firms typically develop standardized documentation templates for audit sampling applications 
to ensure all steps in the process are completed and documented in a consistent manner. You 
should be aware that alternative methods of calculating the upper limit on misstatement are avail­
able and used by some public accounting firms. These alternative methods will produce UMLs that 
are somewhat different from those shown here. While there are minor differences in how MUS is car­
ried out, the foundational concepts are the same so your understanding of the techniques illustrated 
in this chapter will carry over to other approaches.
The Effect of Understatement Misstatements  The methodology used earlier for 
computing the UML is based on the auditor’s assumption, at the time of planning the sam­
pling application, that all errors in the population are overstatements. Recall that MUS is 
not particularly effective at detecting understatements because under an MUS approach 
the probability of selecting a smaller account is proportionately lower than the probability 
of selecting a larger account. Thus, an understated account is, by definition, less likely to 
be selected than an overstated account. In the extreme, an account could be missing from 
the records or it could be 100 percent understated and recorded at a value of $0; in either 
case the probability of the account being selected for audit will be zero. When understate­
ment errors are detected, different approaches can be used. Some approaches adjust the 
total “most likely error” downward but do not adjust the “upper-error limit.” To demon­
strate this approach, assume that the auditor detected the four overstatement misstatements 
shown in the previous example and that the following understatement misstatement was 
also detected.

The computations below show the evaluation of the sample results including the under­
statement misstatement. Note that the UML is still $150,621 but that projected misstate­
ment is now reduced by the projected understatement $2,688 (.10 × $26,882). Because 
this approach for including understatements in the evaluation does not influence the UML, 
understatements are always added to the evaluation table after the overstatement errors. In 
other words, even if the understatement tainting factor had been larger than tainting factors 
of overstatement errors, the understatement would still be placed in the table after the ranked 
overstatement taints.
Some auditors also adjust down the UML by the projected understatement to obtain 
a net upper misstatement limit,which in our example would reduce the UML to $147,933 
($150,056 – $2,688).8 Using the previous decision rule, the auditor would still conclude that 

	
Chapter 9    Audit Sampling: An Application to Substantive Tests of Account Balances	
317
the account was materially misstated because the net UML of $147,933 is more than the toler­
able misstatement of $125,000.
IDEA adjusts down both the most likely error and the upper error limit and reports a 
“Gross upper error limit” and a “Net upper error limit.” Exhibit 9–3 shows the evaluation 
of the sample results, including the understatement misstatement, using IDEA software and 
sample size computed in Exhibit 9–1. The most likely or projected understatement is $2,778. 
Note that the “Gross upper error limit” is still $146,473 but that the “Net upper error limit” 
is now reduced by the projected understatement $143,695 ($146,473 – 2,778). Similarly, the 
“Net most likely error” is reduced by the same projected understatement.

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
Nonstatistical Sampling for Tests of Account Balances9
Nonstatistical audit sampling is commonly used in practice.10 Remember from our discussion 
of nonstatistical sampling in Chapter 8 that “nonstatistical” sampling is not “bad” sampling 
and that auditing standards require that nonstatistical approaches yield sample sizes and eval­
uations comparable to statistical sampling. As discussed in Chapter 8, audit firms find that 
there are some advantages to using a tailored nonstatistical sampling approach (e.g., firms’ 
expert judgments are built into templates and guidance such as the confidence levels defined 
as high, moderate, and low assurance; more consistent application of sampling; and allowance 
of appropriate auditor judgment during the final evaluation). When conducting a nonstatisti­
cal sampling application for testing an account balance, the auditor considers each of the steps 
shown in Table 9–1. The sampling unit for nonstatistical sampling is normally a customer 
account, an individual transaction, or a line item on a transaction. When a nonstatistical sam­
pling application is used, the following items need further explanation:
	
∙	 Identifying individually significant items.
	
∙	 Determining the sample size.
	
∙	 Selecting sample items.
	
∙	 Calculating the sample results.
Identifying Individually Significant Items
In many nonstatistical sampling applications, the auditor determines which items should be 
tested individually and which items should be subjected to sampling. The items that will 
be tested individually are items that may contain potential misstatements that individually 
exceed tolerable misstatement. These items are tested 100 percent because the auditor is not 
willing to accept any sampling risk. For example, an auditor using nonstatistical sampling 
may be examining an entity’s accounts receivable balance in which 10 customer account bal­
ances are greater than tolerable misstatement. The auditor would test all 10 large accounts, 
and supposing that those 10 made up 40 percent of the total account balance, the auditor 
would apply nonstatistical audit sampling to the remaining customer accounts making up 
the other 60 percent of the total balance. Testing all individually significant items produces 
an emphasis on large items similar to probability-proportional-to-size selection. Recall that 
probability-proportional-to-size selection guarantees that all items greater than the sampling 
interval will be included in the sample.
Determining the Sample Size
When determining the sample size, the auditor should consider the level of desired confi­
dence, the risk of material misstatement, the tolerable and expected misstatements, and the 
population size. While an auditor may determine a nonstatistical sample size by using profes­
sional judgment, auditing standards indicate that the sample sizes for statistical and nonsta­
tistical sampling should be similar (AU-C 530.A14). Thus, it is common for firms to develop 
guidance for nonstatistical sampling based on statistical theory such as the formula provided 
below, which was adapted from the AICPA Audit Guide Audit Sampling:11

Accountants, Audit Sampling (Audit Guide) (New York: AICPA, 2012).

S. Glover, “Behind the Numbers: Insights into Large Audit Firm Sampling Approaches,” Accounting Horizons (2015).
11This formula is based on the statistical theory underlying monetary-unit sampling. This approach will yield lower 
confidence levels as expected misstatement becomes larger relative to tolerable misstatement.

The “sampling population book value” excludes the amount of items to be individually 
audited. The confidence factor is identified by determining the level of desired confidence 
(largely driven by the amount of other relevant audit evidence in the “assurance bucket”; see 
Chapter 5) and the risk of material misstatement (i.e., inherent and control risk). Table 9–5 con­
tains the confidence factors for various combinations of desired confidence and risk assessment.
Selecting Sample Items
When any form of audit sampling is used to gather evidence, auditing standards require that 
the sample items be selected in such a way that the sample can be expected to represent the 
population. While some form of random sample or systematic selection (e.g., probability pro­
portional to size) is required for statistical sampling, auditing standards allow the use of these 
selection methods, as well as other selection methods including haphazard sampling when 
using nonstatistical sampling. As discussed in Chapter 8, haphazard selection allows the audi­
tor to “randomly” select items judgmentally (i.e., with no conscious biases or reasons for 
including or omitting items from the sample). This does not imply that the items are selected 
in a careless manner; rather, the sampling units are selected such that they will be representa­
tive of the population. Research indicates that haphazard selection is commonly used in prac­
tice.12 The reason haphazard selection is not appropriate for statistical sampling is because 
people are not very good at being truly random, no matter how hard we may try. For example, 
the first item on a report or computer screen may never be selected by the auditor because it 
doesn’t feel “random” to the auditor to select the very first item. Such biases mean that each 
item in the population did not have an equal chance of being selected.
Calculating the Sample Results
Auditing standards require that the auditor project the amount of misstatement found in the 
sample to the population. There are two common methods of projecting the amount of mis­
statement found in a nonstatistical sample.
The first method of projecting the sample results to the population is to apply the mis­
statement ratio observed in the sample to the population. For example, if the auditor finds 
misstatements of $1,500 in a sample totaling $15,000, the misstatement ratio in the sample 
is 10 percent (1,500 ÷ 15,000), and that ratio is applied to the population. If the total pop­
ulation is $200,000, then projected misstatement using the ratio approach will be $20,000 
(10% × $200,000). This method of projection is often referred to as ratio projection, and 
it is used with both nonstatistical sampling and classical variables statistical sampling (see 
Advanced Module 1 in this chapter). Ratio projection is used when the dollar amount of mis­
statement is expected to relate to the dollar amount of items tested.
The second method, referred to as difference projection, projects the average misstate­
ment of each item in the sample to all items in the population and is used when the misstate­
ment is expected to be relatively constant for all items in the population regardless of their 
dollar size. Difference estimation is the name of a sampling technique that uses information 
12See B. Christensen, R. Elder and S. Glover, Behind the Numbers: Insights into Large Audit Firm Sampling 
Approaches, Accounting Horizons (2015).

about misstatements to determine sample size, projected misstatement, and confidence 
bounds. Difference estimation is illustrated in Advanced Module 1.
In evaluating the results of a nonstatistical sample, the auditor uses professional judgment 
and experience to draw a conclusion. If the sample is drawn haphazardly (versus randomly), 
the allowance for sampling risk cannot be statistically quantified within a specified level of 
confidence. The Audit Sampling guide provides the following direction:
If the total factual and projected misstatement is less than the tolerable misstatement for the account 
balance or class of transactions, the auditor then should consider the risk that such a result might 
be obtained even though the true monetary misstatement for the population exceeds tolerable mis­
statement. Alternatively, the auditor may compare the projected misstatement to the expected mis­
statement used in determining the sample size. When projected misstatement exceeds the expected 
misstatement, the sample may not be large enough to provide the planned risk of incorrect accep­
tance (that is, results in an inadequate allowance for sampling risk).
Stop and Think: What factors would cause a sampling approach to be labeled 
“nonstatistical”?
An approach is considered nonstatistical if (1) judgment, rather than a statistical table or 
formula, is used to determine the sample size, (2) a haphazard sample selection technique is 
used, and/or (3) the sample results are evaluated judgmentally. A nonstatistical approach can 
involve random selection and a judgmental evaluation. Haphazardly selected samples should not 
be formally evaluated statistically (although such an evaluation could be used to inform an audi­
tor’s judgment). However, it is important to note that any randomly drawn sample can be statisti­
cally evaluated—even if the auditor labels the approach “nonstatistical” and even if the sample 
size was not statistically derived. This is an important point because it highlights the need for 
auditors to understand the key concepts of sampling theory even if they are using a nonstatistical 
approach. If an auditor randomly selects a sample and evaluates the results judgmentally, the 
quality of his or her judgment can be compared to statistical theory by an outside expert.
An Example of Nonstatistical Sampling
This example extends the example shown in Chapter 8 for the tests of controls of the revenue 
process for Calabro Wireless Services, Inc. The audit senior, Andrew Judd, has decided to 
design a nonstatistical sampling application to examine the accounts receivable balance of 
Calabro Wireless Services at December 31, 2013. As of December 31, there were 11,800 
accounts receivable accounts with a balance of $3,717,900, and the population is composed 
of the following strata:
Number and Size of Accounts
Book Value of Stratum
15 accounts > $25,000
$    550,000
250 accounts > $3,000
850,500
11,535 accounts < $3,000
2,317,400
Judd has made the following decisions:
	
∙	 Based on the results of the tests of controls, the risk of material misstatement is 
assessed as low.
	
∙	 The tolerable misstatement allocated to accounts receivable is $55,000, and the 
expected misstatement is $15,000.
	
∙	 The desired level of confidence is moderate based on the other audit evidence already 
gathered.
	
∙	 All customer account balances greater than $25,000 will be audited.

	
Chapter 9    Audit Sampling: An Application to Substantive Tests of Account Balances	
321
Based on these decisions, the sample size is determined as follows. First, individually 
significant items are deducted from the account balance, leaving a balance of $3,167,900 
($3,717,900 - $550,000) to be sampled. Second, the sample size for the remaining balance is 
determined using the nonstatistical sample size formula:
​Sample size  =  ​(​ 
$3, 167, 900 
 
_________________ 
 
$55, 000  −  $15, 000 ​)​  ×  1.2  =  95​
The confidence factor of 1.2 is determined by using Table 9–5 and a “Low” assessment 
for risk of material misstatement and “Moderate” level of desired confidence. The 95 sample 
items are divided between the two strata based on the recorded amount for each stratum. 
Accordingly, 26 [($850,500 ÷ $3,167,900) × 95] of the 95 are allocated to the stratum of 
accounts greater than $3,000 and 69 to the stratum of accounts less than $3,000. The total 
number of items tested is 110, composed of 15 individually significant accounts and a sample 
of 95 items.
Judd mailed positive confirmations to each of the 110 accounts selected for testing. 
Either the confirmations were returned to Judd or he was able to use alternative procedures to 
determine that the receivables were valid. Four customers indicated that their accounts were 
overstated, and Judd determined that the misstatements had resulted from unintentional errors 
by entity personnel. The results of the sample are summarized as follows:

Based on analysis of the misstatements found, Judd concluded that the amount of mis­
statement in the population was likely to correlate to the total dollar amount of the items in 
the population and not to the number of items in the population. Thus, he decided to use ratio 
projection (applying the ratio of misstatement in the sampling strata) to compute the projected 
misstatement. His projection of the misstatements follows:
The total projected or likely misstatement is $10,800. Judd should conclude that there is 
an acceptably low risk that the true misstatement exceeds the tolerable misstatement because 
the projected misstatement of $10,800 is less than the expected misstatement of $15,000.
Before reaching a final conclusion on the fair presentation of Calabro’s accounts receiv­
able balance, Judd would consider the qualitative characteristics of the misstatements 
detected and the results of other auditing procedures. If these steps are successfully com­
pleted, Judd can conclude that the accounts receivable balance is fairly presented in confor­
mity with GAAP.
Advanced Module 1: Classical Variables Sampling
Classical variables sampling uses normal distribution theory to evaluate the characteristics 
of a population based on sample data. This approach to audit sampling is similar to the tech­
niques taught in college introductory statistics courses. While this is not a statistics book, we 
do want to discuss briefly how distribution theory is helpful for audit sampling. In Figure 9–2 
LO 9-5

322	
Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
you will see two normally distributed, bell-shaped curves that depict sampling distributions. 
The mean, or average, of the distributions is $10,000. Auditors most commonly use classi­
cal variables sampling to estimate the size of misstatement, so in our example let’s say the 
$10,000 represents the size of the total misstatement in an account or population. The flatter, 
wider distribution in Figure 9–2 is based on a sample size of 50, and the taller, thinner distri­
bution is based on a sample size of 200. Both sampling distributions are taken from the same 
underlying population.
The sampling distributions are formed by plotting the projected misstatements yielded by 
an infinite number of audit samples of the same size taken from the same underlying popula­
tion. For example, the height of the flatter distribution at $9,000 represents the number (or 
percent) of times a sample size of 50 would return a projected misstatement of $9,000.
Rather than actually take an infinite number of samples of the same size to form a picture 
of the distribution, the distribution is modeled using the mathematical properties of the nor­
mal distribution. Thus, a sampling distribution is really a theoretical distribution that models 
how the means of an infinite number of hypothetical samples of a given sample size would be 
distributed. A sampling distribution is useful because it allows us to estimate the probability 
of observing any single sample result. Two important features of sampling distributions are 
very useful for auditors:
	
∙	 The mean of the sampling distribution will be equal to the true mean of the 
underlying population. Thus, Figure 9–2 tells us that the true misstatement in the 
population is $10,000.
	
∙	 The area under the curve can be used to quantify likelihoods. For example, the 
standard error for the flatter curve is $1,000. If we look at the area covered by 2 
standard errors above and 2 standard errors below the mean (i.e., the area under the 
curve between $8,000 and $12,000), we know that the area captures about 95 percent 
of all observed sample results. This is simply a mathematical property of a bell-
shaped distribution.
Considering the first feature listed above, if auditors did actually take an infinite or even 
a very large number of samples of, say, size 50, they could determine with near certainty the 
amount of misstatement in an account. That seems easy enough—except that taking an infi­
nite number or even 500 samples of size 50 is not economically practical. Instead, the auditor

will only take one sample of size 50 and will use the results of that single sample to estimate 
the actual misstatement in the population.
Stop and Think: What information does distribution theory provide to an auditor that 
only takes one sample?
Distribution theory can be very useful even when the auditor is only drawing one sample 
because the theory allows for an uncertain, but informed, prediction to be made about the 
underlying population.
Referring to the flatter distribution in Figure 9–2, which sampling outcome is more likely, 
a projected sample misstatement result of $10,000 or $12,000? The height of the curve in the 
middle indicates values around the mean of the distribution will be more commonly observed 
than values in the tails of the distribution. Because the most likely projected misstatement is 
one that is near the true misstatement, the auditor considers the observed projected sample 
misstatement as the best estimate of the true misstatement in the population. While the sample 
projection is the best estimate, the auditor understands there is uncertainty or sampling risk. 
Referring again to Figure 9–2, the most likely sample result is a projected misstatement at or 
near $10,000, but is it possible the auditor could draw a random sample of 50 that yields a 
projected misstatement of $8,000? Yes, due to sampling risk, it is possible to draw a nonrepre­
sentative sample. However, observing a projected misstatement of $8,000 from a sample of 50 
is not very likely, given that the “true” population misstatement is $10,000. Now, consider the 
same question but with a sample size of 200 instead of 50. Could a sample of 200 produce a 
projected misstatement of $8,000? Again it is possible, but because the distribution for a sam­
ple of 200 is taller and tighter than the distribution for a sample of 50, it is much less likely that 
the auditor will get a projected misstatement result of $8,000 from a sample size of 200. The 
basic idea is simple: as the sample size increases, the results from the sample are increasingly 
likely to approximate the true population mean. In the extreme, if the sample size equaled the 
size of the population, the sample mean would exactly equal the true population mean.
Distribution theory allows auditors to quantify sampling risk through the use of confi­
dence bounds, which are used to form what is commonly called a confidence interval. Refer­
ring to the flatter distribution in Figure 9–2, if the auditor wants to be 95 percent confident 
that his or her sample results include the true population misstatement, he or she would add 
and subtract 2 standard errors to and from the sample projected misstatement. For example, if 
the auditor takes a sample of 50 and computes a projected misstatement of $11,250, the audi­
tor can be 95 percent confident that the interval between $9,250 and $13,250 ($11,250 ± 
$2,000) contains the true population misstatement. Thus, even though auditors do not know 
for sure which part of the actual sampling distribution their sample results come from (because 
they do not actually take an infinite number of samples to form the distribution), they use 
normal distribution theory to compute an interval of values that is likely to contain the true 
population value. The computational complexity of calculating classical variables sampling 
results, in particular computing the standard deviation, made it a difficult technique for audi­
tors to use before electronic calculators and personal computers were common on audit 
engagements. This complexity was one of the factors that led to the development of MUS. 
Another important reason MUS was developed is that most accounting populations contain 
relatively little misstatement, and the estimators used to compute sample size and potential 
misstatement for some classical variables sampling techniques (e.g., difference estimation) 
are not effective in populations with little or no misstatement.13 Therefore, MUS is used in 
practice because of the advantages discussed earlier in the chapter.
Classical variables sampling can easily handle both overstatement and understate­
ment errors. It is most appropriate for populations that contain a moderate-to-high rate 
of misstatement. Some applications of this sampling approach include auditing accounts

receivable in which unapplied credits exist or a relatively large amount of misstatement 
is expected, and inventory in which significant audit differences are expected between 
test counts and pricing tests. Following are some of the advantages and disadvantages of 
­classical variables sampling.
Advantages
	
∙	 When the auditor expects a relatively large number of differences between book and 
audited values, classical variables sampling will normally result in a smaller sample 
size than monetary-unit sampling.
	
∙	 Classical variables sampling techniques are effective for both overstatements and 
understatements. No special evaluation considerations are necessary if the sample 
data include both types of misstatements.
	
∙	 The selection of zero balances generally does not require special sample design 
considerations because the sampling unit will not be an individual dollar, as it is in 
MUS, but rather a customer account, a transaction, or a line item.
Disadvantages
	
∙	 When using the approach to evaluate likely misstatement in an account or population, 
some classical variables sampling techniques (e.g., difference estimation) do not work 
well when little or no misstatement is expected.
	
∙	 In order to determine the sample size for the technique illustrated in this text, the 
auditor must estimate the standard deviation of the audit differences. Since this 
value is unknown, auditors often use a surrogate such as the standard deviation of 
the recorded values in the population. However, this approach tends to overstate 
the standard deviation of the differences because recorded values tend to be more 
variable than audit differences in most accounting populations.
	
∙	 If few misstatements are detected in the sample data, the estimated variance used for 
evaluation purposes may underestimate the true variance, and the resulting projection 
of the misstatements and the related confidence limits may be unreliable.
A number of classical variables sampling techniques are available to the auditor for pro­
jecting the sample results to the population. These include mean per unit, difference, ratio, 
and regression techniques. These techniques differ basically on the assumed relationship 
between the book value and the audit value. We demonstrated ratio projection in the prior sec­
tion on nonstatistical sampling. In this section we illustrate how the classical variables sam­
pling technique known as difference estimation is used to determine sample size, project 
misstatement, and compute confidence bounds.14
Applying Classical Variables Sampling
The discussion in this section focuses on the special features that apply to classical variables 
sampling. A detailed example is included to demonstrate the application of classical variables 
sampling.
Defining the Sampling Unit  When an auditor uses classical variables sampling tech­
niques, the sampling unit can be a customer account, an individual transaction, or a line 
item. For example, in auditing accounts receivable, the auditor can define the sampling unit 
to be a customer’s account balance or an individual sales invoice included in the account 
balance.
14See D. M. Roberts, Statistical Auditing (New York: AICPA, 1978), or see A. D. Bailey, Jr., Statistical Auditing: 
Review, Concepts, and Problems (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1981), for a discussion of the other classi-
cal variables sampling techniques.

Determining the Sample Size  The following formula can be used to determine the 
­sample size for a classical variables sample:
​Sample size  =  ​[​  Population size (in sampling units)  ×  CC  ×  SD 
 
 
 
__________________________________________ 
 
 
 
Tolerable misstatement  −  Estimated misstatement ​ ]​ 
2
​
where
CC = Confidence coefficient
SD = Estimated standard deviation of audit differences
Table 9–6 shows the confidence coefficient values for various levels of desired confidence. 
The risk of incorrect acceptance is the risk that the auditor will mistakenly accept a popula­
tion as fairly stated when the true population misstatement is greater than tolerable misstate­
ment and is the complement of the level of confidence. For example, at a confidence level of 
95 percent, the risk of incorrect acceptance is 5 percent (1 - .95).15
The following example demonstrates how to determine sample size using this formula. 
Assume that the auditor has decided to apply classical variables sampling to an entity’s 
accounts receivable account. Based on the results of testing internal controls over the rev­
enue process, the auditor expects to find a moderate level of misstatement in accounts receiv­
able due mainly to improper pricing of products on sales invoices. The year-end balance for 
accounts receivable contains 5,500 customer accounts and has a book value of $5,500,000. 
The tolerable misstatement for accounts receivable has been established at $50,000, and the 
expected misstatement has been estimated at $20,000. The auditor would like a high level 
of assurance from the test and has set the desired confidence level at 95 percent (risk of 
incorrect rejection of 5 percent). Based on the results of last year’s audit work, the standard 
deviation of audit differences is set at $31. Using these parameters, a sample size of 125 is 
calculated (rounding up):
​Sample size  =  ​[​ 5, 500  ×  1 . 96  ×  $31 
 
___________________ 
 
$50, 000  −  $20, 000 ​]​ 
2 
​  =  125​
In calculating the sample size, the confidence coefficient value (CC) for the desired level of 
confidence is taken from Table 9–6. The CC for a 95 percent confidence level is 1.96.
Selecting the Sample  Sample selection for classical variables sampling normally relies 
on random-selection techniques. If the sampling unit is defined to be a customer account, the 
accounts to be examined can be selected randomly from the aged trial balance of accounts 
receivable. In this example, a random sample of 125 customer accounts is selected.
15Because an account can only be over- or understated, but not both, the risk of incorrect acceptance is commonly 
referred to in the technical literature as a one-tailed test. However, when an auditor uses a sample to evaluate the fair-
ness of an account, she or he does not know with certainty the size or direction of the actual misstatement; therefore, 
it is appropriate to use the traditional two-tailed values of the confidence coefficient as shown in Table 9–6. The 
confidence coefficient associated with the risk of incorrect rejection can also be included in the sample size computa-
tion. If this risk is included in the formula, the sample size will be larger. In practice, the risk of incorrect rejection 
is typically not considered because it deals with efficiency and not effectiveness. When an account is incorrectly 
rejected due to a nonrepresentative sample, the auditor typically performs more work, which will provide evidence 
that the account is fairly stated. Auditors have determined that it is more costly to increase all sample sizes to control 
for the risk of incorrect rejection than it is to simply perform additional procedures when they believe an account is 
rejected incorrectly.

Part 4    Statistical and Nonstatistical Sampling Tools for Auditing
Calculating the Sample Results  Difference projection computes the projected or likely 
misstatement in the population by projecting the average misstatement of each item in the 
sample to all items in the population. Continuing with the prior example, assume that the 
auditor has confirmed 125 individual customer accounts receivable, and that confirmation 
evidence and alternative procedures, performed for customers who did not reply, results in 
the determination that 30 customer accounts contain misstatements. Table 9–7 presents the 
details of the 30 misstatements and the data necessary for evaluating the sample results. The 
known or factual difference between the book value and the audited value is shown in the fifth 
column. The sixth column contains the square of each difference. The sum of these squared 
differences is needed to calculate the standard deviation.
The first calculation is the mean misstatement per sampling item, which is calculated 
by dividing the known or factual audit differences in the sample by the sample size as 
follows:
​

The mean misstatement must then be projected to the population. The projected mean 
misstatement for the population is an overstatement of $14,575, which is determined as

The projected population misstatement is the auditor’s “best estimate” of the likely 
misstatement present in the account. However, the auditor is relying on a sample, and the 
resulting uncertainty must be recognized by calculating an allowance for sampling risk. The 
allowance for sampling risk is represented by the confidence bound. To calculate the confi­
dence bound, the auditor first calculates the standard deviation of audit differences (SD), by 
using the following formula:
​SD  =   ​√ 
_____________________________________________________________ 
 
 
 
 
 
​ 
Total squared audit differences  −  ​(​Sample size  ×  Mean difference per sampling  ​item​ 2​)​

lated using the following formula:

​
In calculating the confidence bound, the auditor uses the confidence coefficient (CC) 
value for the desired level of confidence.16 In our example, the confidence bound is $16,228. 
The auditor then calculates a confidence interval as follows:
​Confidence interval  =  Projected population misstatement  ±  Confidence bound 
Confidence interval  =  $14,575  ±  $16,228​
where $30,803 is the upper limit and -$1,653 is the lower limit. The auditor can be 95 per­
cent confident that the actual misstatement in the population is between the upper and lower 
limits. Since the auditor can tolerate $50,000 misstatement (either under- or overstatement), 
the auditor can accept the population as fairly stated.
The auditor decides that the evidence supports or does not support the account bal­
ance by determining whether the upper and lower limits are within tolerable misstatement. 
If both limits are within the bounds of tolerable misstatement, the evidence supports the 
conclusion that the account is not materially misstated. If either limit is outside the bounds 
of tolerable misstatement, the evidence does not support the conclusion that the account 
is materially correct. In our example, the upper and lower limits are within the bounds of 
tolerable misstatement and the auditor can conclude the account is fairly stated. Figure 9–3 
displays this result.
When the evidence indicates that the account may be materially misstated, the auditor 
must consider the same four options discussed under monetary-unit sampling: (1) increase 
sample size, (2) perform additional substantive procedures, (3) adjust the account, or (4) issue 
a qualified or adverse opinion.
16Note that the CC value simply represents the number of standard errors the auditor would like to use in establish-
ing the confidence bounds around the sample result. The sample mean 1 standard error results in about a 65 percent 
confidence interval, ±2 standard errors results in about a 95 percent confidence interval, and 3 standard errors results 
in about a 99 percent confidence interval.

KEY TERMS
Allowance for sampling risk. The uncertainty that results from sampling; the difference 
between the expected mean of the population and the tolerable deviation or misstatement.
Audit sampling. The selection and evaluation of less than 100 percent of the population of 
audit relevance such that the auditor expects the items selected to be representative of the pop­
ulation and, thus, likely to provide a reasonable basis for conclusions about the population.
Classical variables sampling. The use of normal distribution theory to estimate the dollar 
amount of misstatement for a class of transactions or an account balance.
Confidence bound. A measure of sampling risk added and subtracted to the projected mis­
statement to form a confidence interval.
Expected misstatement. The amount of misstatement that the auditor believes exists in the 
population.
Factual misstatements. These are misstatements about which there is no doubt. For exam­
ple, an auditor may test a sales invoice and determine that the prices applied to the products 
ordered are incorrect. Once the products are correctly priced, the amount of misstatement is 
known. In such cases, the auditor knows the exact amount of the misstatement.

	
Chapter 9    Audit Sampling: An Application to Substantive Tests of Account Balances	
329
Monetary-unit sampling (MUS). Attribute-sampling techniques used to estimate the dollar 
amount of misstatement for a class of transactions or an account balance.
Nonsampling risk. The risk that the auditor reaches an erroneous conclusion for any reason 
not related to sampling risk (e.g., judgment error, inappropriate procedures, failing to detect a 
misstatement when applying an audit procedure).
Nonstatistical sampling. Audit sampling that relies on the auditor’s judgment to determine 
the sample size, select the sample, and/or evaluate the results for the purpose of reaching a 
conclusion about the population.
Projected misstatements. These are the auditor’s best estimate of misstatements in popula­
tions, involving the projection of misstatements identified in an audit sample to the entire 
population from which the sample was drawn.
Risk of incorrect acceptance. The risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the 
recorded account balance is not materially misstated when it is materially misstated.
Risk of incorrect rejection. The risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded 
account balance is materially misstated when it is not materially misstated.
Sampling risk. The possibility that the sample drawn is not representative of the population 
and that, as a result, the auditor reaches an incorrect conclusion about the account balance or 
class of transactions based on the sample.
Sampling unit. The individual item constituting a population being sampled.
Statistical sampling. Sampling that uses the laws of probability to select and evaluate the 
results of an audit sample, thereby permitting the auditor to quantify the sampling risk for the 
purpose of reaching a conclusion about the population.
Tolerable misstatement. The amount of planning materiality that is allocated to a financial 
statement account.
Upper misstatement limit. The total of the projected misstatement plus the allowance for 
sampling risk.

9-25	 World-famous mining mogul Steve Wilsey hired the public accounting firm of Joe 
Wang Associates, PC, to conduct an audit of his new acquisition, Cougar Goldust, 
Inc. The gold inventory was scheduled to be taken on November 30. The perpet­
ual records show only the weight of the gold in various inventory bins. Wang has 
decided to use a variables sampling approach (difference estimation) to determine 
the correct weight of the gold on hand. (Note that the pricing of the inventory is 
straightforward because the market value on November 30 determines the price for 
balance sheet purposes.) There are 4,000 bins in the Cougar warehouse. The bins 
will serve as the sampling units. Wang’s desired level of confidence is 90 percent.

of the inventory is usually tested.
	
	
	 	
This year you have established the tolerable misstatement to be $5,000. The enti­
ty’s book value is $97,500. The entity has 960 inventory items, the number of which 
has been determined by examining inventory codes. Each item will be tagged with a 
prenumbered inventory tag numbered from 1 to 960. You plan to evaluate the results 
using classical variables sampling (difference estimation).
	
	
	 	
Assume you have selected a sample of 100 items randomly. For each sample item, 
audit tests are performed to make sure that the physical count is correct, the pricing

DISCUSSION CASES
	
LO 9-1, 9-2, 9-5	
9-27	 Mead, CPA, was engaged to audit Jiffy Company’s financial statements for the year 
ended August 31. Mead is applying sampling procedures.
	
	
	 	
During the prior years’ audits Mead used classical variables sampling in per­
forming tests of controls on Jiffy’s accounts receivable. For the current year Mead 
decided to use monetary-unit sampling in confirming accounts receivable because 
MUS uses each account in the population as a separate sampling unit. Mead expected 
to discover many overstatements but presumed that the MUS sample would still be 
smaller than the corresponding size for classical variables sampling.
	
	
	 	
Mead reasoned that the MUS sample would automatically result in a stratified 
sample because each account would have an equal chance of being selected for con­
firmation. Additionally, the selection of negative (credit) balances would be facili­
tated without special considerations.
	
	
	 	
Mead computed the sample size using the risk of incorrect acceptance, the total 
recorded book amount of the receivables, and the number of misstated accounts 
allowed. Mead divided the total recorded book amount of the receivables by the 
sample size to determine the sampling interval. Mead then calculated the stan­
dard deviation of the dollar amounts of the accounts selected for evaluation of the 
receivables.
	
	
	 	
Mead’s calculated sample size was 60, and the sampling interval was determined 
to be $10,000. However, only 58 different accounts were selected because two 
accounts were so large that the sampling interval caused each of them to be selected 
twice. Mead proceeded to send confirmation requests to 55 of the 58 customers. 
Three selected accounts each had insignificant recorded balances under $20. Mead 
ignored these three small accounts and substituted the three largest accounts that had 
not been selected in the sample. Each of these accounts had a balance in excess of 
$7,000, so Mead sent confirmation requests to those customers.
	
	
	 	
The confirmation process revealed two differences. One account with an audited 
amount of $3,000 had been recorded at $4,000. Mead projected this to be a $1,000 
misstatement. Another account with an audited amount of $2,000 had been recorded 
at $1,900. Mead did not count the $100 difference because the purpose of the test 
was to detect overstatements.
	
	
	 	
In evaluating the sample results, Mead determined that the accounts receivable 
balance was not overstated because the projected misstatement was less than the 
allowance for sampling risk.
Required:
	
	
	 Describe each incorrect assumption, statement, and inappropriate application of 
sampling in Mead’s procedures.

9-28	 Doug Stevens, CPA, is interested in testing the fairness of the ending inventory bal­
ance during the audit of Morris Co. Doug has relatively little experience using sta­
tistical sampling methods and, quite frankly, doesn’t like to turn anything over to 
random chance—especially the selection of items to test. Doug used a judgmental 
method of selecting items for testing. The method involves testing the inventory-item 
balances that he deems most risky or most likely to be misstated. Doug identified 
items to test based on size of balance, findings from prior years, age of inventory, 
description, and professional judgment.

He selected 26 items with a total book value of $720,000. In his “sample,” he 
found a combined $80,000 in overstatement errors. The book value of inventory 
on the entity’s records is $1,090,000. Overall materiality for the engagement is 
$500,000. Doug’s policy is to use 50 percent or less of overall materiality as toler­
able misstatement for any one account.
Required:
	
a.	 What is your opinion of Doug’s method of selecting his “sample”?
	
b.	 Evaluate Doug’s results. Does he have sufficient evidence to conclude the bal­
ance is fairly stated?

Major Phases of an Audit
339
Auditing the Revenue Process
A
uditors generally divide an entity’s information system into business 
processes or transaction cycles. Using this approach, the auditor is able 
to gather evidence by examining the processing of related transactions 
from their origin to their ultimate disposition in accounting journals and led­
gers. We first introduced the concept of viewing a business from a process 
perspective in Chapter 2. Figure 10–1 summarizes a model of business center­
ing on business processes or transaction cycles. As the figure shows, the five 
basic processes are (1) the revenue process, (2) the purchasing process, (3) the 
human resource management process, (4) the inventory management process, 
and (5) the financing process. Auditors divide the financial statement compo­
nents into business processes or cycles in order to manage the audit better.
In this chapter, the concepts and techniques learned in the previous chap­
ters are applied to determine the risk of material misstatement (i.e., setting 
the level of inherent risk and control risk) for the revenue process and related 
accounts. The revenue process focuses on the sale of goods and services to 
customers. For virtually all entities, the revenue and purchasing processes rep­
resent the two major business processes that affect the financial statements.
The chapter starts by reviewing the basic concepts related to revenue rec­
ognition. An overview of the revenue process is then presented as an aid in 
providing you with an understanding of the process. This is followed by a dis­
cussion of the specific factors that affect the assessment of inherent risk for the 
revenue process and the auditor’s assessment of control risk. While the main 
focus of this chapter is auditing the revenue process for a financial statement 
audit, the concepts covered for setting control risk are applicable to an audit 
of internal control over financial reporting for public companies. The remain­
der of the chapter discusses the substantive procedures the auditor conducts 
to reach the appropriate level of detection risk for the accounts affected by 
the revenue process. While the main emphasis is on accounts receivable, the 
discussion also covers the allowance for uncollectible accounts, bad-debt 
expense, and sales returns and allowances. Because the cash account is 
affected by other business processes, it is covered separately in Chapter 16.

Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
341
Revenue Recognition
Revenue recognition is reviewed at the beginning of this chapter because knowledge of this 
underlying concept is fundamental to auditing the revenue process. Additionally, revenue 
must be recognized in conformity with GAAP in order for an auditor to issue an unqualified 
opinion. FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6, “Elements of Financial 
Statements,” defines revenues as
inflows or other enhancements of assets of an entity or settlements of its liabilities (or a combina­
tion of both) from delivery or producing goods, rendering services, or other activities that consti­
tute the entity’s major or central operations (¶78).
Revenues are measured by the exchange value of the goods and services provided. 
In general, the entity receives cash or claims to cash for the goods or services provided. 
Claims to cash are usually referred to as trade accounts receivable. FASB Statement 
of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5, “Recognition and Measurement in Financial 
Statements of Business Enterprises” (¶83), requires that before revenue is recognized 
(recorded), it must be (1) realized or realizable and (2) earned. Revenue is realized when 
a product or service is exchanged for cash, a promise to pay cash, or other assets that can 
be converted into cash. Revenue is earned when an entity has substantially completed 
the earning process, which generally means a product has been delivered or a service has 
been provided.
The SEC in SAB No. 101 provides the following criteria for revenue recognition:
	
∙	 Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists.
	
∙	 Delivery has occurred or services have been rendered.
	
∙	 The seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable.
	
∙	 Collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenue recognition continues to pose a significant audit risk to auditors and has resulted 
in questions about the integrity of the financial reporting process (see Exhibit 10–1). As we 
noted in Chapter 4, the auditor should presume that there is a risk of material misstatement 
due to fraud relating to revenue recognition.
LO 10-1
Practice 
INSIGHT
According to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, there are eight common methods for 
committing financial statement fraud. These include
	1.	 early revenue recognition;
	2.	 holding the books open past the accounting period;
	3.	 fictitious sales;
	4.	 failure to record returns;
	5.	 fraud in the percentage of completion method;
	6.	 related-party transactions;
	7.	 overstating receivables and inventory; and
	8.	 liability and expense omissions.
The auditor should be alert for the following activities that are fraud risks related to rev­
enue recognition:
	
∙	 Side agreements are arrangements that are used to alter the terms and conditions 
of recorded sales in order to entice customers to accept delivery of goods and services.
	
∙	 Channel stuffing (also known as trade loading) is a marketing practice that suppliers 
sometimes use to boost sales by inducing distributors to buy substantially more 
inventory than they can promptly resell.

342	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
	
∙	 Related-party transactions require special consideration because related parties 
may be difficult to identify. Related-party transactions also may pose significant 
“substance over form” issues.
	
∙	 Bill and hold sales (also called parked inventory schemes) are sales where the 
customer agrees to purchase the goods but the seller retains physical possession 
until the customer requests shipments. Unless certain conditions are met, such an 
arrangement does not qualify as a sale because delivery has not occurred.
For most entities, the revenue recognition process occurs over a short period of time 
(days or weeks), but in certain industries, such as construction or defense, the revenue recog­
nition process may extend over a period of years.
An entity’s revenue recognition policies affect how transactions are processed and how 
they are accounted for in the financial statements. Thus, an auditor must understand an enti­
ty’s revenue recognition policies in order to audit the revenue process.
Practice 
INSIGHT
In 2014, the IASB and the FASB published a proposed joint standard on revenue recognition. This 
standard would replace most of the guidance on revenue recognition that currently exists under 
IFRS and U.S. GAAP. If implemented, this guidance will have a significant effect on how many com­
panies recognize revenue. While the effective date for the standard has not been finalized, students 
should be aware of the potential implications if this standard is finalized.
Hewlett-Packard Has No Autonomy!
In October 2011 Hewlett-Packard (HP) acquired Autonomy Corporation, Britain’s biggest software com­
pany and second largest in Europe, for approximately $11 billion. A year later, HP took an impairment 
charge related to its acquisition of Autonomy for $8.8 billion. HP claimed it had been duped into over­
paying for Autonomy. An internal investigation had revealed “serious accounting improprieties” and 
“outright misrepresentations” in connection with the acquisition. Apparently, the investigation team 
found that for at least two years, “Autonomy booked sales of low-margin hardware products as software 
and would label the cost of that hardware as marketing or other expenses, which made products appear 
faster growing and more profitable than they really were.” In addition, there are reports that at least one 
year before the HP acquisition, an Autonomy executive brought forth concerns about the company’s 
accounting practices.
Sales personnel at Autonomy used a Dotcom tactic for increasing revenues by offering to buy custom­
ers’ products in return for purchasing Autonomy’s software. Mr. Michael Lynch (the former founder and 
CEO of Autonomy) defended Autonomy’s accounting practices and stated that Autonomy’s accounting 
was consistent with International Accounting Standards.
Litigation against HP, its executives, and Autonomy’s former executives continues. In December 
2014, U.S. District Judge Charles Beyer rejected a proposed settlement between HP and the Company’s 
shareholders.

Overview of the Revenue Process
In this section, we present an overview of the revenue process for EarthWear Clothiers, Inc., 
beginning with an order from a customer, proceeding to the exchange of goods or services 
for a promise to pay, and ending with the receipt of cash. Exhibit 10–2 describes EarthWear’s 
revenue process.
LO 10-2

	
Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
343
Stop and Think: Before proceeding, take a moment and review Exhibit 10–2. Do any 
risks seem especially apparent? If so, how might these risks impact the nature, timing, 
and extent of your audit procedures?
Figure 10–2 presents the flowchart of EarthWear’s revenue process (excluding sales from 
company stores), which will provide a framework for discussing controls and tests of controls 
in more detail. The discussion of the revenue process in this chapter can be applied equally 
well to manufacturing, wholesale, and service organizations. It should be kept in mind, how­
ever, that an accounting system must be tailored to meet the specific needs of an entity. There­
fore, you should concentrate on understanding the basic concepts presented so that they can 
be applied to specific revenue systems.
You should also notice that the revenue process shown in Figure 10–2 interacts with the 
inventory management process. Many accounting systems integrate the revenue, purchasing, 
human resources, and inventory processes. The flowcharts used in this text to represent those 
processes show the points where the processes interact with one another. As entities use more 
IT, it is easier to integrate the information flow among the various business processes.
We will now discuss the following topics related to the revenue process:
	
∙	 Types of transactions and financial statement accounts affected.
	
∙	 Types of documents and records.
	
∙	 Major functions.
	
∙	 Key segregation of duties.
Types of Transactions and Financial Statement Accounts Affected
Three types of transactions are typically processed through the revenue process:
	
∙	 The sale of goods or rendering of a service for cash or credit.
	
∙	 The receipt of cash from the customer in payment for the goods or services.
	
∙	 The return of goods by the customer for credit or cash.
LO 10-3
Description of EarthWear’s Revenue Process
EarthWear provides 24-hour toll-free telephone numbers that may be called seven days a week 
(except Christmas Day) to place orders. Telephone calls are answered by the company’s sales 
representatives, who use online computer terminals to enter customer orders and to retrieve 
information about product characteristics and availability. The company’s sales representatives enter 
orders into an online order entry and inventory control system. Customers using the company’s Internet 
site complete a computer screen template that requests information on product code, size, color, and so 
forth. When the customer finishes shopping for products, he or she enters delivery and credit card infor­
mation into a computer-based form. EarthWear provides assurance through CPA WebTrust that the web­
site has been evaluated and tested to meet WebTrust Principles and Criteria.
Computer order processing is performed each night on a batch basis, at which time shipping tickets are 
printed with bar codes for optical scanning. Inventory is picked based on the location of individual products 
rather than orders, followed by computerized sorting and transporting of goods to multiple packing stations 
and shipping zones. The computerized inventory control system also handles items that customers return. 
Orders are generally shipped by United Parcel Service (UPS) at various tiered rates, depending upon the total 
dollar value of each customer’s order. Other expedited delivery services are available for additional charges.
With the exception of sales to groups and companies for corporate incentive programs, customers pay 
in cash (in stores) or with credit cards. EarthWear’s major bank is reimbursed directly by credit card com­
panies, usually within three days. Group and corporate accounts are granted credit by the credit depart­
ment. When group or corporate orders are received from new customers, the credit department performs 
a credit check following corporate policies. A credit authorization form is completed with the credit limit 
entered into the customer database. When a group or corporate order is received from an existing cus­
tomer, the order is entered, and the data validation program performs a credit check by comparing the 
sum of the existing order and the customer’s balance to the customer’s credit limit.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The key controls involved in each of these transactions are discussed later in the chapter. 
For some entities, other types of transactions that may occur as part of the revenue process 
include scrap sales, intercompany sales, and related-party sales. The auditor should be aware 
of how these transactions are processed and their related controls when they represent mate­
rial amounts in the financial statements.
The revenue process affects numerous accounts in the financial statements. The most 
significant accounts affected by each type of transaction are as follows:

information from customer sales orders into the revenue system. Phone or Internet sales are 
entered directly into the data validation program.
Credit Approval Form  When a customer purchases products on credit from the entity for 
the first time, the entity should have a formal procedure for investigating the creditworthiness 
of the customer. The result of this procedure should be documented on some type of credit 
approval form. When the customer plans to purchase additional products in the future, this 
procedure should be used to establish the customer’s credit limit. The amount of the credit 
limit should be documented on the approval form. When credit limits are included in the 
entity’s customer files, the approval forms represent the source documents authorizing the 
amounts contained in the information system. EarthWear follows such a policy for its group 
and corporate customers (see Exhibit 10–2).
Open-Order Report  This is a report of all customer orders for which processing has not been 
completed, perhaps because items ordered are out of stock and on backorder. In the typical reve­
nue process, once a customer’s order has been accepted, the order is entered into the system. After 
the goods have been shipped and billed, the order should be noted as filled. This report should 
be reviewed daily or weekly, and old orders should be investigated to determine if any goods 
have been shipped but not billed or to determine why orders have not been filled. Figure 10–2 
shows that EarthWear has an open-order file. Note C indicates that an open-order report is pre­
pared weekly and reviewed by billing department personnel for long overdue orders.
Shipping Document  A shipping document should be prepared anytime goods are shipped 
to a customer. This document generally serves as a bill of lading and contains information on 
the type of product shipped, the quantity shipped, and other relevant information. In some 
revenue systems, the shipping document and bill of lading are separate documents. A copy of 
the shipping document is sent to the customer, while another copy of the shipping document 
is used to initiate the billing process. Figure 10–2 shows that EarthWear follows a similar 
process using a shipping ticket.
Sales Invoice  This document is used to bill the customer. The sales invoice contains infor­
mation on the type of product or service, the quantity, the price, and the terms of trade. The 
original sales invoice is usually forwarded to the customer, and copies are distributed to other 
departments within the organization. The sales invoice is typically the source document that 
signals the recognition of revenue. The majority of EarthWear’s sales are made to customers 
using credit cards, and they receive an acknowledgement of the sale, usually by email, directly 
from the company. However, the shipping ticket that accompanies the goods contains the 
quantity and prices for products purchased. That amount shows up on the customer’s credit 
card statement.
Sales Journal  Once a sales invoice has been issued, the sale needs to be recorded in the 
accounting records. The sales journal is used to record the necessary information for each 
sales transaction. Depending on the complexity of the entity’s operation, the sales journal may 
contain information classified by type of sale (for example, product line, intercompany sales, 
related parties). The sales journal contains columns for debiting accounts receivable and cred­
iting the various sales accounts. EarthWear maintains such a journal.
Customer Statement  This document is usually mailed to a customer monthly. It contains 
the details of all sales, cash receipts, and credit memorandum transactions processed through 
the customer’s account for the period. EarthWear prepares monthly statements only for group 
and corporate customers who have accounts receivable with the company.
Accounts Receivable Subsidiary Ledger  The accounts receivable subsidiary ledger 
contains an account and the details of transactions with each customer. A transaction recorded 

348	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
in the sales journal and cash receipts journal is posted to the appropriate customer’s account 
in the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger. For IT systems such as EarthWear’s, this infor­
mation is maintained in the accounts receivable file (see Figure 10–2).
Aged Trial Balance of Accounts Receivable  This report, which is normally pre­
pared weekly or monthly, summarizes all the customer balances in the accounts receiv­
able subsidiary ledger. Customers’ balances are reported in aging categories (such as 30 
days or less, 31–60 days, 61–90 days, more than 90 days old) based on the time expired 
since the date of the sales invoice. The aged trial balance of accounts receivable is used 
to monitor the collection of receivables and to ensure that the details of the accounts 
receivable subsidiary ledger agree with the general ledger control account. The auditor 
uses this report for conducting much of the substantive audit work in accounts receivable. 
EarthWear ­prepares an aged trial balance of accounts receivable for group and corporate 
customers.
Remittance Advice  This document is usually mailed with the customer’s bill and returned 
with the customer’s payment for goods or services. A remittance advice contains informa­
tion regarding which invoices are being paid by the customer. Many entities use turnaround 
documents, where a portion of the sales invoice serves as a remittance advice that is returned 
with the customer’s payment. EarthWear receives remittance advices from group and corpo­
rate customers after the payment has been processed by the company’s bank. Payments from 
credit card companies are also made directly to the bank, and a remittance advice listing is 
forwarded to EarthWear.
Cash Receipts Journal  This journal is used to record the entity’s cash receipts. The cash 
receipts journal contains columns for debiting cash, crediting accounts receivable, and credit­
ing other accounts such as scrap sales or interest income. EarthWear maintains such a journal.
Credit Memorandum  This document is used to record credits for the return of goods in 
a customer’s account or to record allowances that will be issued to the customer. Its form is 
generally similar to that of a sales invoice, and it may be processed through the system in the 
same way as a sales invoice. Exhibit 10–3 describes how EarthWear handles goods returned 
from customers. The process of customer returns is not shown in the revenue flowchart 
(Figure 10–2).
Write-Off Authorization  This document authorizes the write-off of an uncollectible 
account. It is normally initiated in the credit department, with final approval for the write-off 
coming from the treasurer. Depending on the entity’s accounting system, this type of transac­
tion may be processed separately or as part of the normal stream of sales transactions. Earth­
Wear has negligible bad debts because most sales are made by credit card. Any bad debts 
related to group or corporate sales are written off by the credit department after approval by 
the treasurer.
Description of EarthWear Clothiers’ Process for Handling Customer Returns
In order to receive credit for returned goods, customers must mail the goods to EarthWear’s receiving 
department. There the goods are inspected, and a receiving document, which also serves as a credit 
memorandum, is prepared. Credit memoranda are entered into the revenue process along with the nor­
mal batching of customer orders. The customer receives either a replacement product, a cash refund, or 
a credit to his or her credit card.
The returned goods are placed back into inventory if they are not defective or damaged. If the goods 
are defective or damaged they are listed as “seconds” and sold at reduced prices. The inventory records 
are updated to reflect either the original cost or the reduced price.

The Major Functions
The principal objective of the revenue process is selling the entity’s goods or services at 
prices and terms that are consistent with management’s policies. Table 10–2 summarizes the 
functions that normally take place in a typical revenue process.
Order Entry  The initial function in the revenue process is the entry of new sales orders into 
the system. It is important that sales or services be consistent with management’s authoriza­
tion criteria before entry into the revenue process. In most entities, there is a separate order 
entry department (see Figure 10–2).
Credit Authorization  The credit authorization function must determine that the customer 
is able to pay for the goods or services. Failure to perform this function properly may result in 
bad-debt losses. In many entities, customers have preset credit limits. The credit authorization 
function must ensure that the credit limit is not exceeded without additional authorization. 
Where credit limits are programmed into the information system, a sale that causes a custom­
er’s balance to exceed the authorized credit limit should not be processed. The system should 
also generate an exception report or review by the credit function prior to further processing. 
Periodically, each customer’s credit limit should be reviewed to ensure that the amount is con­
sistent with the customer’s ability to pay.
The credit authorization function also has responsibility for monitoring customer pay­
ments. An aged trial balance of accounts receivable should be prepared and reviewed by the 
credit function. Payment should be requested from customers who are delinquent in paying for 
goods or services. The credit function is usually responsible for preparing a report of customer 
accounts that may require write-off as bad debts. However, the final approval for writing off an 
account should come from an officer of the company who is not responsible for credit or col­
lections. If the authorization for bad-debt write-off is part of the credit function, it is possible 
for credit personnel who have access to cash receipts to conceal misappropriation of cash by 
writing off customers’ balances. In many organizations, the treasurer approves the write-off of 
customer accounts because this individual is responsible for cash management activities and 
the treasurer’s department is usually separate from the credit function. In some entities, the 
accounts written off are turned over to a collection agency for continuing collection efforts. 
By following this procedure, an entity discourages the use of fictitious bad-debt write-offs to 
conceal the misappropriation of cash. Most entities have a separate credit department.
Shipping  Goods should not be shipped, nor should services be provided, without proper 
authorization. The main control that authorizes shipment of goods or performance of ser­
vices is payment or proper credit approval for the transaction. The shipping function must 
also ensure that customer orders are filled with the correct product and quantities. To ensure 
timely billing of customers, completed orders must be promptly forwarded to the billing func­
tion. The shipping function is normally completed within a separate shipping department.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Billing  The main responsibility of the billing function is to ensure that all goods shipped 
and all services provided are billed at authorized prices and terms. The entity’s controls 
should prevent goods from being shipped to customers who are not being billed. In an IT sys­
tem, an open-order report should be prepared and reviewed for orders that have not been filled 
on a timely basis. In other systems, all prenumbered shipping documents should be accounted 
for and matched to their related sales invoices. Any open or unmatched transactions should be 
investigated by billing department or sales department personnel.
The billing function is also responsible for handling goods returned for credit. The key 
control here is that a credit memorandum should not be issued unless the goods have been 
returned. A receiving document should first be issued by the receiving department to acknowl­
edge receipt of the returned goods.
Cash Receipts  The collection function must ensure that all cash collections are properly 
identified and promptly deposited intact at the bank. Many companies use a lockbox system, 
in which customers’ payments are sent directly to the entity’s bank. The bank then forwards a 
file of cash receipts transactions and remittance advices to the entity. In situations where pay­
ments are sent directly to the entity, the checks should be restrictively endorsed and a “prelist­
ing” or control listing prepared. All checks should be deposited daily.
Accounts Receivable  The accounts receivable function is responsible for ensuring that 
all billings, adjustments, and cash collections are properly recorded in customers’ accounts 
receivable records. Any entries in customers’ accounts should be made from authorized 
source documents such as sales invoices, remittance advices, and credit memoranda. In an 
IT system, the entries to the customers’ accounts receivable records may be made directly as 
part of the normal processing of these transactions. The use of control totals and daily activ­
ity reports provides the control for ensuring that all transactions are properly recorded. The 
accounts receivable function is normally performed within the billing department or a sepa­
rate accounts receivable department.
General Ledger  The main objective of the general ledger function in terms of a revenue 
process is to ensure that all revenues, collections, and receivables are properly accumulated, 
classified, and summarized in the accounts. In an IT system, the use of control or summary 
totals ensures that this function is performed correctly. One important function is the recon­
ciliation of the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger to the general ledger control account. 
The general ledger function is also normally responsible for mailing the monthly customer 
account statements.
Key Segregation of Duties
One of the most important controls in any accounting system is proper segregation of duties. 
This is particularly important in the revenue process because of the potential for theft and 
fraud. Therefore, individuals involved in the order entry, credit, shipping, or billing functions 
should not have access to the accounts receivable records, the general ledger, or any cash 
receipts activities. If IT is used extensively in the revenue process, there should be proper 
segregation of duties in the IT department. Table 10–3 contains some of the key segregation 
of duties for the revenue process, as well as examples of possible errors or fraud that can result 
from conflicts in duties.
Table 10–4 shows the proper segregation of duties for individual revenue functions across 
the various departments that process revenue transactions.
Stop and Think: Using this table, briefly analyze EarthWear’s flowchart as shown in 
Figure 10–2. Evaluate whether EarthWear has sufficient segregation of duties. If not, 
what could happen as a result?

Inherent Risk Assessment
In examining the revenue process, the auditor should consider the inherent risk factors that 
may affect both the revenue and cash receipts transactions and the financial statement accounts 
affected by those transactions. Many business risks are also inherent risks. The assessment 
of the potential effects of inherent risk factors is one of the inputs for the assessment of the 
risk of material misstatement. Chapter 4 pointed out the three conditions (incentive/pressure, 
opportunity, and attitude) that are generally present when fraud occurs. Four specific inherent 
risk factors that may affect the revenue process are the following:
	
∙	 Industry-related factors.
	
∙	 The complexity and contentiousness of revenue recognition issues.
	
∙	 The difficulty of auditing transactions and account balances.
	
∙	 Misstatements detected in prior audits.
Industry-Related Factors
Factors such as the profitability and health of the industry in which an entity operates, the 
level of competition within the industry, and the industry’s rate of technological change 
affect the potential for misstatements in the revenue process. For example, if the industry is 
LO 10-7
Key Segregation of Duties in the Revenue Process and Possible 
Errors or Fraud
Segregation of Duties
Possible Errors or Fraud Resulting from Conflicts of Duties
The credit function should be segregated from the ­billing 
function.
If one individual has the ability to grant credit to a customer and also has responsibility 
for billing that customer, it is possible for sales to be made to customers who are not 
creditworthy. This can result in bad debts.
The accounts receivable function should be segregated 
from the general ledger function.
If one individual is responsible for the accounts receivable records and also for the general ledger, 
it is possible for that individual to conceal unauthorized shipments. This can result in unrecorded 
sales transactions and theft of goods.
The shipping function should be segregated from the 
billing function.
If one individual who is responsible for shipping goods is also involved in the billing function, 
it is possible for unauthorized shipments to be made and for the usual billing procedures to 
be circumvented. This can result in unrecorded sales transactions and theft of goods.
The cash receipts function should be segregated from the 
accounts receivable function.
If one individual has access to both the cash receipts and the accounts receivable records, it 
is possible for cash to be diverted and the shortage of cash in the accounting records to be 
covered. This can result in theft of the entity’s cash.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
experiencing a lack of demand for its products, the entity may be faced with a declining sales 
volume, which can lead to operating losses and poor cash flow. Similarly, competition within 
the industry can affect the entity’s pricing policies, credit terms, and product warranties. If 
such industry-related factors are present, management may engage in activities that can result 
in misstatements.
The level of government regulation within the industry may also affect sales activity. 
While all industries are regulated by legislation restricting unfair trade practices such as price 
fixing, a number of industries are more highly regulated. For example, banks and insurance 
companies are subject to both state and federal laws that may limit an entity’s operations. 
The products developed and sold by pharmaceutical companies are regulated by the Food 
and Drug Administration. Finally, most states have consumer protection legislation that may 
affect product warranties, returns, financing, and product liability. Industry-related factors 
directly impact the auditor’s assessment of inherent risk for assertions such as authorization 
and accuracy.
The Complexity and Contentiousness of 
Revenue Recognition Issues
For most entities the recognition of revenue is not a major problem because revenue is recog­
nized when a product is shipped or a service is provided. However, for some entities the rec­
ognition of revenue may involve complex calculations.1 Examples include recognition of 
revenue on long-term construction contracts, long-term service contracts, lease contracts, and 
installment sales.
Stop and Think: Briefly consider EarthWear and its revenue process. Does Earth­
Wear’s typical revenue process indicate a higher or lower risk of material misstatement 
due to improper revenue recognition?
In some cases, there may be disputes between the auditor and management over when rev­
enue, expenses, and related profits should be recognized. In such circumstances, the auditor 
should assess the risk of material misstatement to be high. Revenue recognition may also have 
a significant impact on the cutoff and accuracy assertions.
The Difficulty of Auditing Transactions and Account Balances
Accounts that are difficult to audit can pose inherent risk problems for the auditor. For exam­
ple, management’s estimate for the allowance for uncollectible accounts and sales returns can 
be difficult to audit because of the subjectivity that may be involved in determining proper 
value. The risk of a material misstatement for these estimates is a function of factors such 
as the complexity of the customer base and the reliability of the data available to test the 
accounts. For example, the only evidence available to determine the collectibility of a cus­
tomer’s account may be past payment history or a credit agency report. Such evidence is not 
as reliable as payments by the customer.
Misstatements Detected in Prior Audits
The presence of misstatements in previous audits is a good indicator that misstatements are 
likely to be present during the current audit. With a continuing engagement, the auditor has 
the results of prior years’ audits to help in assessing the potential for misstatements in the 
revenue process.
1See American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Auditing Revenue in Certain Industries, Audit Guide (New 
York: AICPA, 2012), for an overall discussion of the complexities of revenue recognition and, in particular, of the 
software and high-technology industries.

	
Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
353
Control Risk Assessment
The concepts involved in control risk assessment were discussed in Chapter 6. The follow­
ing sections apply the approach outlined there to the revenue process. For discussion pur­
poses, it is assumed that the auditor has decided to follow a reliance strategy for the revenue 
process. ­Figure 10–3 summarizes the three steps for setting control risk when a reliance 
strategy is being followed. Each of these steps is briefly reviewed within the context of the 
revenue process.
Understand and Document Internal Control
In order to assess the control risk for the revenue process, the auditor must understand the five 
components of internal control.
Control Environment  Table 6–3 in Chapter 6 listed the factors that are important in under­
standing the control environment (e.g., integrity and ethical values, commitment to compe­
tence). Because these factors have a pervasive effect on all business processes, understanding 
the control environment is generally completed on an overall entity basis. The auditor should, 
however, consider how the various control environment factors may affect the individual busi­
ness processes. In the remaining discussion of the revenue process, it is assumed that the 
control environment factors, including general IT controls, are reliable.
The Entity’s Risk Assessment Process  The auditor must understand how management 
considers risks that are relevant to the revenue process, estimates their significance, assesses 
the likelihood of their occurrence, and decides what actions to take to address those risks. 
Some of these risks include competition, rapid growth, and new technology. Each of these 
factors can represent a serious risk to an entity’s internal controls over the revenue process.
Control Activities  When a reliance strategy is adopted for the revenue process, the auditor 
needs to understand the controls that exist to ensure that management’s objectives are being

met. More specifically, the auditor identifies what controls ensure that the assertions for trans­
actions and events are being met.
Information Systems and Communication  For each major class of transactions in the 
revenue process, the auditor needs to obtain the following knowledge:
	
∙	 The process by which sales, cash receipts, and sales returns and allowances 
transactions are initiated.
	
∙	 The accounting records, supporting documents, and accounts that are involved in 
processing sales, cash receipts, and sales returns and allowances transactions.
	
∙	 The flow of each type of transaction from initiation to inclusion in the financial 
statements, including computer processing of the data.
	
∙	 The process used to prepare estimates for accounts such as the allowance for 
uncollectible accounts and sales returns.
The auditor can develop an understanding of the revenue process by conducting a walk­
through. This involves the auditor’s “walking” a transaction through the accounting system 
and documenting the various functions that process it. In the case of a continuing audit, the 
auditor has the prior years’ systems documentation to assist in the walkthrough, although 
the possibility of changes in the system must be considered. If the system has been changed 
substantially, or the audit is for a new client, the auditor should prepare new documentation 
of the system.
Monitoring of Controls  The auditor needs to understand the entity’s monitoring of 
controls in the revenue process. This includes understanding how management assesses 
the design and operation of controls in the revenue process. It also involves understanding 
how supervisory personnel within the system review the personnel who perform the con­
trols and evaluate the performance of the entity’s IT function, as well as the effectiveness 
of controls.
Plan and Perform Tests of Controls
The auditor should systematically examine the entity’s revenue process to identify relevant 
controls that help to prevent, or detect and correct, material misstatements. Because these 
controls are relied upon, the auditor conducts tests of controls to ensure that the controls in 
the revenue process operate effectively. Audit procedures used to test controls in the revenue 
process include inquiry of client personnel, inspection of documents and records, observation 
of the operation of the control, walkthroughs, and reperformance by the auditor of the control 
activities.
Subsequent sections examine tests of controls for each major type of transaction in the 
revenue process. Chapter 8 presented sampling approaches to conducting tests of controls.
Set and Document Control Risk
Once the tests of controls in the revenue process have been completed, the auditor sets the 
achieved level of control risk. If the results of the tests of controls support the planned level 
of control risk, the auditor conducts the planned level of substantive procedures for the related 
account balances. If the results of the tests of controls do not support the planned level of 
control risk, the auditor sets control risk at a level higher than planned. Additional substantive 
procedures in the accounts affected by the revenue process must then be conducted.
The auditor should document the achieved level of control risk for the revenue process 
using either quantitative amounts or qualitative terms such as “low,” “medium,” and “high.” 
The documentation of the achieved level of control risk for the revenue process would include 
documentation of the accounting system such as the flowchart included in Figure 10–2, the 
results of the tests of controls, and a memorandum indicating the overall conclusions about 
control risk.

	
Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
355
Control Activities and Tests of Controls— Revenue 
Transactions
Table 10–5 presents the assertions about transactions and events that were discussed in Chap­
ters 2, 5, and 6. Table 10–6 summarizes the assertions for revenue transactions along with 
some examples of possible misstatements. For each of these misstatements we have included 
one or two possible control activities that management could implement to mitigate the risk 
as well as some example tests of controls that the auditor could use to test those controls. 
This table (and similar tables in later chapters) is not an exhaustive list of misstatements, 
control activities, or tests of controls for revenue transactions; rather, it provides some specific 
examples by assertion to help you understand the underlying concepts. Most of these controls 
exist within EarthWear’s revenue process (Figure 10–2).
The auditor’s decision process for planning and performing tests of controls involves con­
sidering the assertions and the possible misstatements that can occur if internal control does 
not operate effectively. The auditor evaluates the entity’s accounting system to determine the 
controls that will prevent, or detect and correct, such misstatements. When controls are pres­
ent and the auditor decides to rely on them, they must be tested to evaluate their effectiveness. 
For example, suppose the auditor’s evaluation of the entity’s revenue process indicates that 
monthly statements are mailed to customers by the accounts receivable department with com­
plaints being handled by the billing department. This control is intended to prevent the record­
ing of fictitious sales transactions. The auditor can review and test the entity’s procedures 
for mailing customer statements and handling complaints. If no exceptions or an immaterial 
number are noted, the auditor has evidence that the control is operating effectively.
Each of the assertions shown in Table 10–6 for revenue transactions is discussed mainly 
in terms of control activities and tests of controls. The column for test of controls includes 
both manual tests and computer-assisted audit techniques (CAATs). The choice of which type 
of test of controls is appropriate for a particular assertion will be a function of the following:
	
∙	 The volume of transactions or data.
	
∙	 The nature and complexity of the systems by which the entity processes and controls 
information.
	
∙	 The nature of the available evidence, including audit evidence in electronic form.
The following sections also include a discussion of control activities and tests of controls 
that are relevant for EarthWear’s revenue process.
Occurrence of Revenue Transactions
Auditors are concerned about the occurrence assertion for revenue transactions because clients 
are more likely to overstate sales than to understate them. The auditor is concerned about two 
major types of material misstatements: sales to fictitious customers and recording of revenue 
when goods have not been shipped or services have not been performed. In other words, the

auditor needs assurance that all recorded revenue transactions are valid. The controls shown in 
Table 10–6 are designed to reduce the risk that revenue is recorded before goods are shipped or 
services are performed. The major control for preventing fictitious sales is proper segregation 
of duties between the shipping function and the order entry and billing functions. If these func­
tions are not properly segregated, unauthorized shipments can be made to fictitious customers 
by circumventing normal billing control activities. Requiring an approved customer sales order 
and shipping document before revenue is recognized also minimizes the recording of fictitious

sales in an entity’s records. Accounting for the numerical sequence of sales invoices can be 
accomplished manually or by computer. The use of monthly customer statements also reduces 
the risk of revenue being recorded before goods are shipped or services are performed because 
customers are unlikely to recognize an obligation to pay in such a circumstance. Figure 10–2 
shows that EarthWear’s revenue process includes these control activities where applicable.
For each of the controls shown, a corresponding test of control is indicated. For example, 
the auditor can observe and evaluate the segregation of duties. The auditor can also examine 
a sample of sales invoices for the presence of an authorized customer order and shipping 
document for each one. In an IT environment, such as EarthWear’s revenue process, the audi­
tor can test the application controls to ensure that revenue is recorded only after an approved 
customer order has been entered and the goods shipped.
Completeness of Revenue Transactions
The major misstatement that concerns both management and the auditor is that goods are 
shipped or services are performed and no revenue is recognized. Failure to recognize rev­
enue means that the customer may not be billed for goods or services and the entity does not 
receive payment. Control activities that ensure that the completeness assertion is being met 
include accounting for the numerical sequence of shipping documents and sales invoices, 
matching shipping documents with sales invoices, reconciling the sales invoices to the daily 
sales report, and maintaining and reviewing the open-order file. For example, EarthWear rec­
onciles the batch totals of orders entered and provides a reconciliation of the daily shipping 
listing and the daily sales report. Additionally, the open-order file is reviewed periodically 
with follow-up on any order older than some predetermined date.
Tests of controls for these control activities are listed in Table 10–6. For example, to test 
the control that shipping documents are matched to sales invoices, the auditor could select a 
sample of bills of lading and trace each one to its respective sales invoice and to the sales jour­
nal. If all bills of lading in the sample were matched to sales invoices and included in the sales 
journal, the auditor would have evidence that all goods shipped are being billed. The auditor 
could also use a generalized audit software package to print the items in the open-order file that 
are older than the entity’s predetermined time frame for completing a transaction. These trans­
actions would then be investigated to determine why the sales were not completed.
Authorization of Revenue Transactions
Possible misstatements due to improper authorization include shipping goods to or perform­
ing services for customers who are bad credit risks and making sales at unauthorized prices 
or terms. As discussed earlier in this chapter, management should establish procedures for 
authorizing credit, prices, and terms. Additionally, no goods should be shipped without a 
properly authorized sales order. Table 10–6 lists a number of tests of controls for this asser­
tion. In an IT revenue process such as EarthWear’s, the auditor may need to review the appli­
cation controls and use CAATs to test the proper authorization of revenue transactions.
Accuracy of Revenue Transactions
Accuracy is an important assertion because revenue transactions that are not processed accu­
rately result in misstatements that directly affect the amounts reported in the financial state­
ments. Again, the presence of an authorized price list and terms of trade reduces the risk of 
inaccuracies. There should also be controls that ensure proper verification of the information 
contained on the sales invoice, including type of goods and quantities shipped, prices, and 
terms. If the controls are manual, the sales invoice may contain the initials of the entity per­
sonnel who verified the mathematical accuracy. In an IT application such as EarthWear’s, 
most of these controls would be programmed. For example, the price list is maintained in a 
master file. However, the entity still needs controls to ensure that the authorized price list is 
updated promptly and that only authorized changes are made to the master file. The auditor 
can verify the application controls by using CAATs.

358	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The accuracy assertion also includes the possibility that transactions are not posted cor­
rectly to the sales journal, customers’ accounts in accounts receivable subsidiary ledger, or 
the general ledger. In the revenue process, control totals should be utilized to reconcile sales 
invoices to the daily sales report, and the daily recordings in the sales journal should be rec­
onciled with the posting to the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger. The accounts receivable 
subsidiary ledger should periodically be reconciled to the general ledger control account. In a 
properly designed revenue system, such controls are programmed and reconciled by the con­
trol groups in the IT department and the user departments. The auditor can examine and test 
the application controls and various reconciliations.
Cutoff of Revenue Transactions
If the entity does not have adequate controls to ensure that revenue transactions are recorded 
on a timely basis, sales may be recorded in the wrong accounting period. The entity should 
require that all shipping documents be forwarded to the billing function daily. The auditor 
can test this control by comparing the date on a bill of lading with the date on the respective 
sales invoice and the date the sales invoice was recorded in the sales journal. In EarthWear’s 
revenue process, the shipping department forwards the approved shipping order to the billing 
department for entry into the billing program. In such a system, sales should be billed and 
recorded within one or two days of shipment.
Classification of Revenue Transactions
The use of a chart of accounts and proper codes for recording revenue transactions should ­provide 
adequate assurance about this assertion. The auditor can review the sales journal and general 
ledger for proper classification and can test sales invoices for proper classification by examining 
programmed controls to ensure that sales invoices are coded by type of product or service.
Control Activities and Tests of Controls—Cash  
Receipts Transactions
Table 10–7 summarizes the assertions for cash receipts transactions along with some exam­
ples of possible misstatements. For each of these misstatements we have included one or two 
possible control activities that management could implement to mitigate the risk as well as 
some example tests of controls that the auditor could use to test those controls. This table is 
not an exhaustive list of misstatements, control activities, or tests of controls for cash receipts 
transactions; rather, it provides some specific examples by assertion to help you understand 
the underlying concepts. In assessing the control risk for cash receipts transactions, the audi­
tor follows the same decision process as described for revenue transactions. Each of the asser­
tions shown in Table 10–7 is discussed with an emphasis on the control activities and tests of 
controls. The substantive audit procedures for cash are covered in Chapter 16.
LO 10-9
Practice 
INSIGHT
The risk of misappropriation of funds may be greatly reduced by implementing a central lockbox at 
a bank to receive payments instead of receiving customer payments directly at the organization’s 
location.
Occurrence of Cash Receipts Transactions
The possible misstatement that concerns the auditor when considering the occurrence asser­
tion is that cash receipts are recorded but not deposited in the entity’s bank account. In order 
to commit such a fraud, an employee needs access to both the cash receipts and the accounts 
receivable records; segregation of duties normally prevents this type of defalcation. Thus, 
proper segregation of duties between the cash receipts function and the accounts receivable

function is one control procedure that can prevent such misstatements. Another very strong 
control that prevents such misstatements is the use of a lockbox system, such as the system 
used by EarthWear (Figure 10–2). With a lockbox system, the customers’ cash receipts are 
mailed directly to the entity’s bank, thereby preventing the entity’s employees from having 
access to cash. The cash is deposited in the entity’s account, and the bank forwards the remit­
tance advices and a file of the cash receipts transactions to the entity for processing. Finally, 
preparation of monthly bank reconciliations that are independently reviewed reduces the pos­
sibility that cash receipts will be recorded but not deposited.
Completeness of Cash Receipts Transactions
A major misstatement related to the completeness assertion is that cash or checks are stolen 
or lost before being recorded in the cash receipts records. Proper segregation of duties and 

360	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
a lockbox system are strong controls for ensuring that this assertion is met. When a lockbox 
system is not used, checks should be restrictively endorsed when received, and a daily cash 
listing should be prepared. An additional control is reconciliation of the daily cash receipts 
with the amounts posted to customers’ accounts in the accounts receivable subsidiary led­
ger. An example of this control is shown in EarthWear’s system, where the total of the remit­
tance advices is reconciled with the daily remittance report by the cash receipts department.
In terms of tests of controls, the controls conducted for the occurrence assertion also 
provide some evidence about completeness. In addition, the auditor can observe the entity’s 
personnel endorsing the checks and preparing the cash listing. The reconciliation of the daily 
cash receipts with the postings to the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger can be tested by 
the auditor on a sample basis.
When the entity does not have adequate segregation of duties or if collusion is sus­
pected, an employee has the ability to steal cash and manipulate the accounting records to 
hide the misstatement. This is sometimes referred to as lapping. When lapping is used, the 
perpetrator covers the cash shortage by applying cash from one customer’s account against 
another customer’s account. For example, suppose customer 1 has a balance of $5,000 and 
mails a check for $3,000 as payment on the account. An entity’s employee who has access 
to both the cash receipts and the accounts receivable records can convert the $3,000 pay­
ment to his or her personal use. The theft of the cash can be covered in the following way: 
The $3,000 payment is not reflected in the customer’s account. When a payment is subse­
quently received from customer 2, the payment is deposited in the entity’s cash account but 
applied to customer 1’s accounts receivable account. Now the shortage of cash is reflected 
in customer 2’s accounts receivable account. The entity employee who stole the cash keeps 
hiding the theft by shifting the $3,000 difference from one customer’s accounts receivable 
account to another’s.
If cash is stolen before it is recorded as just described, the fraud is difficult and time-­
consuming for the auditor to detect. If the auditor suspects that this has occurred, the individ­
ual cash receipts have to be traced to the customers’ accounts receivable accounts to ensure 
that each cash receipt has been posted to the correct account. If a cash receipt is posted to 
a different account, this may indicate that someone is applying cash to different accounts to 
cover a cash shortage. However, if duties are not properly segregated, that person may also be 
able to hide the theft through use of a credit memorandum, bad-debt write-off, or no recogni­
tion of the revenue transaction. For example, the employee could issue a credit memorandum 
for $3,000 against the customer’s accounts receivable account to cover the $3,000 difference.
Stop and Think: Suppose that you were auditing an entity (e.g., a restaurant or bar) 
where a large portion of the payments are made in cash. How would an auditor deter­
mine if all the cash was being recorded and not stolen by employees?
In this situation, there is no accounts receivable. The owner could analyze typical cash 
receipts for dips in trends and could also compare daily and weekly revenue to reductions in 
inventory. Also the owner could use other types of activities such as the use of an “informant” 
to observe bar employees and activity at the cash registers.
Authorization of Cash Discounts
Terms of trade generally include discounts for payment within a specified period as a way 
of encouraging customers to pay on time. Controls in the accounting system should ensure 
that management’s policies concerning cash discounts are followed. For example, the entity 
may establish terms of trade of 2/10, net/30 days. Customers paying within 10 days are then 
entitled to a 2-percent discount. When the cash is received, client personnel should check 
to be sure that the customer is complying with the payment terms. The auditor can test this 
control by examining a sample of cash receipts transactions to determine if the entity’s cash 
discount policies are being followed.

	
Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
361
Accuracy of Cash Receipts Transactions
There are several potential reasons that could lead cash receipts to be recorded at an incor­
rect amount. For example, the wrong amount of cash received could be recorded from the 
remittance advice or the receipt could be incorrectly processed during data entry. One control 
activity that provides reasonable assurance that such errors would be detected and corrected 
is to reconcile the daily remittance report to control listing of remittance advices. The corre­
sponding tests of controls involve examining and testing the various reconciliations that take 
place in this part of the revenue process. The use of monthly customer statements also pro­
vides a check on posting to the correct customer account because a customer who has made a 
payment and whose monthly statement does not reflect it will complain to the entity. It is also 
possible that a customer’s payment gets posted to the wrong customer account. One control 
activity that can provide assurance for this classification assertion is that the daily remittance 
report is reconciled daily with postings to the cash receipts journal and accounts receivable 
subsidiary ledger. Tests of controls would include review and testing of reconciliations.
Cutoff of Cash Receipts Transactions
If the entity uses a lockbox system or if cash is deposited daily in the entity’s bank, there is a 
small possibility of cash being recorded in the wrong period. Generally, the auditor has little 
concern with this type of misstatement because most entities use such control activities.
Classification of Cash Receipts
The auditor seldom has major concerns about cash receipts being recorded in the wrong 
financial statement account. The major control for preventing cash from being recorded in 
the wrong account is a chart of accounts. The auditor’s concern is with applying appropriate 
account codes to the individual cash receipts, especially cash receipts from unusual sources 
such as scrap sales, notes receivable, and proceeds from sales of equipment. The auditor can 
trace a sample of remittance advices to the cash receipts journal to ensure proper classifica­
tion. The cash receipts journal can also be reviewed for unusual items.
Control Activities and Tests of Controls—Sales  
Returns and Allowances Transactions
For most entities, sales returns and allowances transactions are few and do not represent a 
material amount in the financial statements. As a result, this text does not cover them in as 
much detail as revenue or cash receipts transactions. However, credit memoranda that are 
used to process sales returns and allowances transactions can also be used to cover an unau­
thorized shipment of goods or conceal a misappropriation of cash.
Two important controls should be present regarding the processing of credit memoranda. 
First, each credit memorandum should be approved by someone other than the individual 
who initiated it. This provides proper segregation of duties between access to the customer’s 
record and authorization for issuing a credit memorandum. Second, a credit for returned goods 
should be supported by a receiving document indicating that the goods have been returned. 
The auditor can perform tests of controls on credit memoranda by examining a sample of 
credit memoranda for proper approval and the presence of the respective receiving docu­
ments. For a credit memorandum issued for a reason other than a return of goods, approval 
by an appropriate individual is the critical control. See Exhibit 10–3 for a discussion of the 
control activities used by EarthWear to control sales returns.
For entities with few or immaterial sales returns and allowances transactions, the auditor 
may decide only to gain an understanding of how such transactions are processed and not to con­
duct tests of controls. Substantive analytical procedures (discussed later in this chapter) can then 
be used to provide sufficient evidence on the fairness of the sales returns and allowances account.
LO 10-9

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Relating the Assessed Level of Control Risk to  
Substantive Procedures
The results of the auditor’s testing of internal control for the revenue process directly impact 
detection risk and therefore the level of substantive procedures that will be required for the 
accounts affected by this process. This includes balance sheet accounts such as accounts 
receivable, allowance for uncollectible accounts, and cash, as well as income statement 
accounts such as sales, bad-debt expense, and sales returns and allowances.
When the results of testing controls support the planned level of control risk, the auditor 
can conduct substantive procedures of these accounts at the planned level. However, if the 
results of the tests of controls do not support the planned level of control risk, the detection 
risk will have to be set lower. This normally leads to an increase in the amount of substantive 
procedures. For example, if controls for the occurrence assertion are weaker than planned for 
revenue transactions, the auditor might increase the number of accounts receivable confirma­
tions mailed to customers.
Auditing Revenue-Related Accounts
The auditor uses substantive procedures to detect material misstatements in revenue-related 
accounts (e.g., sales, accounts receivable, bad-debt expense).
As discussed in Chapter 5, there are two categories of substantive procedures: (1) substan­
tive analytical procedures and (2) tests of details of classes of transactions, account balances, and 
disclosures. Substantive analytical procedures are used to examine plausible relationships among 
related accounts. This should include disaggregated analytical procedures for revenue. In the rev­
enue process, substantive tests of transactions focus mainly on the sales and cash receipts trans­
actions. Tests of details of account balances concentrate on the detailed amounts or estimates that 
make up the ending balance for revenue-related accounts. Tests of details of disclosures are con­
cerned with the presentation and disclosures related to accounts receivable and related accounts.
Table 10–5 presented the assertions for revenue and cash receipts transactions and events. 
Table 10–8 lists the assertions for account balances and disclosures as they apply to revenue-
related accounts. You should note that the auditor may test assertions related to transactions 
(substantive tests of transactions) in conjunction with testing internal controls.
We discuss substantive analytical procedures first because, after control testing, the 
assurance “bucket” is usually filled with evidence from substantive analytical procedures 
before tests of details.
LO 10-10
Management Assertions about Account Balances and Disclosures for 
Revenue-Related Accounts
Assertions about account balances at the period end:
 • Existence. Recorded accounts receivable and related accounts exist.
 • Rights and obligations. The entity holds or controls the rights to accounts receivable and related accounts, and 
any liabilities related to those accounts are the obligations of the entity.
 • Completeness. All accounts receivable and related accounts that should have been recorded have been recorded.
 • Valuation and allocation. Accounts receivable and related accounts are included in the financial statements at 
appropriate amounts, and any resulting valuation or allocation adjustments are appropriately recorded.
Assertions about presentation and disclosure:
 • Occurrence and rights and obligations. All disclosed events, transactions, and other matters relating to accounts 
receivable and related accounts have occurred and pertain to the entity.
 • Completeness. All disclosures relating to accounts receivable and related accounts that should have been 
included in the financial statements have been included.
 • Classification and understandability. Financial information relating to accounts receivable and related accounts is 
appropriately presented and described, and disclosures are clearly expressed.
 • Accuracy and valuation. Financial and other information relating to accounts receivable and related accounts are 
disclosed fairly and in appropriate amounts.

Substantive Analytical Procedures
Substantive analytical procedures are useful audit tests for examining the fairness of revenue-
related accounts because such tests provide sufficient evidence at low cost. Table 10–9 lists 
examples of substantive analytical procedures that are useful in auditing such accounts. Many of 
the analytical procedures listed in Table 10–9 could also be used for risk assessment procedures 
at the planning stage or as a final analytical procedure at the completion of the audit. Table 10–9 
is not an exhaustive list of substantive analytical procedures for revenue-related accounts; rather, 
it provides some specific examples by account to help you understand the underlying concepts.
Stop and Think: What evidence might be provided by comparing this year’s gross profit 
percentage with that of previous years? Further, what might it mean if this year’s percent­
age is significantly less than last year’s? What if it is significantly more than last year’s?
Comparison of gross profit percentage to previous years’ or industry data may provide valu­
able evidence on unrecorded revenue (an understatement) or fictitious revenue (an overstate­
ment) and related accounts receivable when this ratio is significantly higher or lower than 
previous years’ or industry data. This ratio may also provide information on changes in pric­
ing policies.
The five ratios shown under the “Accounts Receivable” subheading in Table 10–9 ­provide 
evidence on whether accounts receivable properly reflect net realizable value. Each ratio aids 
the auditor in assessing the fairness of the allowance for uncollectible accounts, which in 
turn affects the fairness of accounts receivable and bad-debt expense. The days outstanding

in accounts receivable ratio for EarthWear provides a good example of a substantive ana­
lytical procedure that provides strong audit evidence support for the accurate valuation of 
accounts receivable. The days outstanding in accounts receivable ratio is 4.91 and 4.94 days 
for 2014 and 2015; respectively, suggesting that EarthWear collects its accounts receivable 
quickly. This result is consistent with the majority of the company’s sales being made with 
credit cards. EarthWear is reimbursed in three to five days by its credit card providers. Given 
the relative size of accounts receivable and this result indicating that receivables are col­
lected quickly, EarthWear’s auditors may do no further audit work on accounts receivable and 
instead rely on evidence gathered regarding cash receipts and the ending cash balance.
Stop and Think: Suppose that 2015’s days outstanding in accounts receivable ratio 
increased substantially. How might this impact the nature, timing, and extent of your 
audit procedures? What types of EarthWear’s customers would be the source of such 
bad-debt problems?
Last, comparing the ratio of sales returns or sales discounts to revenue with previous 
years and industry data provides the auditor with evidence on whether all sales returns or 
sales discounts have been recorded. The auditor can also estimate sales commission expense 
by multiplying the average commission rate by net sales and comparing that amount with 
recorded commission expense. In many situations, the auditor may be able to accept the sales 
returns, sales discounts, and sales commission expense as fairly presented without conducting 
any additional substantive tests if such substantive analytical procedures produce results that 
are consistent with the auditor’s expectations.
Tests of Details of Classes of Transactions, Account 
­Balances, and Disclosures
Table 10–10 presents the assertions for accounts receivable, allowance for uncollectible 
accounts, and bad-debt expense along with related tests of transactions, account balances, 
and disclosures. This table should not be construed as an exhaustive list of substantive audit 
procedures for revenue-related accounts. For each assertion, one or more tests of details are 
presented. In the following subsection, we discuss how the auditor approaches the audit of 
each important assertion for revenue-related accounts. We begin with the completeness asser­
tion for the accounts receivable balance because the auditor must establish that the detailed 
records that support the account to be audited agree with the general ledger account. Note that 
we do not cover each assertion, because they are not applicable to EarthWear or they would 
have been conducted as tests of controls.
Completeness
The auditor’s concern with completeness is whether all accounts receivable have been 
included in the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger and the general ledger accounts receiv­
able account. The reconciliation of the aged trial balance to the general ledger account should 
detect an omission of a receivable from either the accounts receivable subsidiary ledger or the 
general ledger account. If the entity’s accounting system contains proper control totals and 
reconciliations, such errors should be detected and corrected by the relevant control activities 
for accuracy and completeness. For example, in EarthWear’s revenue process (Figure 10–2), 
control totals exist for daily shipping and billing. Personnel in the billing department would be 
responsible for reconciling the two totals. If such control activities do not exist in an entity’s 
accounting system, or if they are not operating effectively, the auditor will have to trace a 
sample of shipping documents to sales invoices, the sales journal, and the accounts receivable 
subsidiary ledger to ensure that the transactions were included in the accounting records.

*Each of these substantive tests of transactions could be conducted as a test of controls or a dual-purpose test. Of these six assertions, the cutoff assertion is the one that is 
most often conducted as a substantive test of transactions.
T A B L E  1 0 – 1 0
The process followed by the auditor is to agree the accounts receivable subsidiary led­
ger of customer accounts to the general ledger accounts receivable (control) account. This is 
typically accomplished by obtaining a copy of the aged trial balance of accounts receivable 
and comparing the total balance with the general ledger accounts receivable account balance. 
Exhibit 10–4 presents an aged trial balance of accounts receivable working paper for a wire­
less services company: Calabro Wireless Services. An aged trial balance of the subsidiary 
ledger is used because the auditor will need this type of data to examine the allowance for 
uncollectible accounts.
The auditor must also have assurance that the detail making up the aged trial balance 
is correct. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. One approach involves mainly 
manual audit procedures. First, the aged trial balance is footed and crossfooted. Footing and 
crossfooting mean that each column of the trial balance is added, and the column totals are 
then added to ensure that they agree with the total balance for the account. Then a sample of 
customer accounts included in the aged trial balance is selected for testing. For each selected 
customer account, the auditor traces the customer’s balance back to the subsidiary ledger 
detail and verifies the total amount and the amounts included in each column for proper aging. 

366	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
A second approach involves the use of CAATs. If the general controls over IT are adequate, 
the auditor can use a generalized audit software package such as ACL to examine the accu­
racy of the aged trial balance generated by the entity’s accounting system.
Cutoff
The cutoff assertion attempts to determine whether all revenue transactions and related 
accounts receivable are recorded in the proper period. While the auditor can obtain assurance 
about the cutoff assertion for sales by conducting tests of controls, in most cases, cutoff tests 
are conducted as substantive tests of transactions or as a dual-purpose test. Additionally, sales 
cutoff is usually coordinated with inventory cutoff because the shipment of goods normally 
indicates that the earnings process is complete. The auditor wants assurance that if goods 
have been shipped in the current period, the resulting sale has been recorded, and that if the 
sales have been recorded, the corresponding inventory has been removed from the accounting 
records. In addition, the auditor needs to determine if there is proper cutoff for sales returns.
If there is not a proper cutoff of revenue transactions, both the revenue and accounts 
receivable accounts will be misstated for the current and following years. In most instances, 
errors related to sales cutoff are unintentional and are due to delays in recognizing the ship­
ment of goods or the recognition of the sale. In other instances, the entity may intentionally 
fail to recognize revenue transactions in the current period or may recognize sales from the 
next period in the current period (see Exhibit 10–5). The first situation can occur by the rev­
enue transactions not being recorded in the sales journal until the next period. For example, 
sales that take place on the last two days of the current year are recorded as sales in the next 
year by delaying entry until the current-year sales journal is closed. The second situation is 
generally accomplished by leaving the sales journal “open” and recognizing sales from the 
first few days of the next period as current-period sales.
The entity’s accounting system should have controls that ensure timely recording of rev­
enue transactions. The results of tests of controls, if performed, should provide evidence of 
the cutoff assertion. Additionally, the entity should have end-of-period control activities for 
ensuring a proper sales cutoff between accounting periods.
The test of sales cutoff is straightforward. The auditor first identifies the number of the 
last shipping document issued in the current period. Then a sample of sales invoices and their 
related shipping documents is selected for a few days just prior to, and subsequent to, the 
end of the period. Assuming that sales are recorded at the time of shipment (FOB–shipping 
point), sales invoices representing goods shipped prior to year-end should be recorded in the

current period, and invoices for goods shipped subsequent to year-end should be recorded as 
sales in the next period. Any transaction recorded in the wrong period should be corrected by 
the entity. For example, suppose the last shipping document issued in the current period was 
numbered 10,540. None of the recorded revenue transactions sampled from a few days prior 
to year-end should have related shipping document numbers higher than 10,540, and none 
of the sampled revenue transactions recorded in the first few days of the subsequent period 
should have related shipping document numbers lower than 10,540. In an IT system such tests 
are still necessary because a delay in entering data may occur, or management may manipu­
late the recognition of the transactions.
The processing of sales returns may differ across entities. When sales returns are not mate­
rial, or if they occur irregularly, the entity may recognize a sales return at the time the goods are 
returned. However, for entities like EarthWear, sales returns may represent a material amount 
or may occur regularly. In this instance, the entity may estimate an allowance for sales returns. 
When sales returns represent a material amount, the auditor needs to test for proper cutoff. If 
the auditor decides to conduct more detailed tests, the receiving documents used to acknowl­
edge receipt of the returned goods must be examined. Using procedures similar to those for 
testing sales cutoff, the auditor selects a sample of receiving documents for a few days prior 
to and subsequent to the end of the period. The receiving documents are traced to the related 
credit memoranda. Sales returns recorded in the wrong period should be corrected, if material.
Existence
The existence of accounts receivable is one of the more important assertions because the 
auditor wants assurance that this account balance is not overstated through the inclusion of 
fictitious customer accounts or amounts. The major audit procedures for testing the existence 
assertion for accounts receivable are confirmation of customers’ account balances and exami­
nation of subsequent cash receipts. If a customer does not respond to the auditor’s confir­
mation request, additional audit procedures may be necessary. The confirmation process is 
discussed later in this chapter.
Rights and Obligations
The auditor must determine whether the accounts receivable are owned by the entity because 
accounts receivable that have been sold should not be included in the entity’s financial state­
ments. For most audit engagements, this does not represent a problem because the entity owns 
Sunbeam Corporation Restates Financial Results
Sunbeam Corporation restated its financial results for 1996, 1997, and the first quarter of 1998 based on an 
extensive audit by its audit committee and two public accounting firms. The special audit found that the pre­
viously issued financial statements overstated the loss for 1996, overstated profits for 1997, and understated 
the loss for the first quarter of 1998. Sunbeam reported that, for certain periods, revenue was incorrectly rec­
ognized in the wrong period, partly because of the company’s “bill and hold” practice of billing customers in 
the current period for products that were delivered in a later period. The company also booked a significant 
amount of sales that were made to customers under such liberal terms that they did not constitute valid 
sales at all, but rather appeared to be consignments or guaranteed sales. In 1997 revenue was restated from 
$1,186 million to $1,073 million, and earnings were reduced from $123.1 million to $52.3 million. The report­
ing of these financial irregularities led to the resignation of Sunbeam’s CEO, Al Dunlap.
In 2001, the SEC sued five ex-executives of Sunbeam and Arthur Andersen. Andersen agreed to pay 
$110 million to settle an accounting-fraud lawsuit over its audit work for Sunbeam.

all the receivables. However, in some instances an entity may sell its accounts receivable. The 
auditor can detect such an action by reviewing bank confirmations, cash receipts for payments 
from organizations that factor accounts receivable, or corporate minutes for authorization of 
the sale or assignment of receivables.
Valuation and Allocation
The major valuation issue related to accounts receivable is concerned with the net realiz­
able value of accounts receivable. The auditor is concerned with determining that the allow­
ance for uncollectible accounts, and thus bad-debt expense, is fairly stated. The allowance for 
uncollectible accounts is affected by internal factors such as the entity’s credit-granting and 
cash collection policies and external factors such as the state of the economy, conditions in the 
entity’s industry, and the financial strength of the entity’s customers.
In verifying the adequacy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts, the auditor starts by 
assessing the entity’s policies for granting credit and collecting cash. If the entity establishes 
strict standards for granting credit, the likelihood of a large number of bad debts is reduced. 
Generally, the auditor assesses the adequacy of the allowance account by first examining the 
aged trial balance for amounts that have been outstanding for a long time. The probability 
of collecting these accounts can be assessed by discussing them with the credit manager, 
examining the customers’ financial statements, obtaining credit reports (such as from Dun & 
Bradstreet), or reviewing the customers’ communications with the entity related to payment.
The second step in assessing the adequacy of the allowance account involves examining 
the entity’s prior experience with bad debts. The problem with examining only delinquent 
accounts is that no consideration is given to accounts that are current but that may result in 
bad debts. By maintaining good historical data on bad debts, the entity can determine what 
percentage of each aging category will become uncollectible. The auditor can test these 
percentages for reasonableness. Following is an example of how this approach would work.
Suppose Calabro Wireless Services developed the following historical data on bad debts:
Aging Category
Percentage as Bad Debts
<30 days
.001
31–60 days
.025
61–90 days

>90 days
.55
The allowance for uncollectible accounts can be determined in the following manner, 
using the data from Exhibit 10–4:
<30 days
31–60 days
61–90 days
>90 days

Suppose that the balance in the allowance for doubtful accounts on Calabro’s general 
ledger is $135,300. This general ledger balance appears reasonable, given the auditor’s calcu­
lation of $132,355.
Stop and Think: Suppose the percentage for bad debts in the 31–60 days column 
was 5 percent instead of 2.5 percent; would your conclusion change? What if it were 
7.5 percent?
While determining the proper amount for the allowance for uncollectible accounts may 
seem relatively straightforward, considerable judgment on the part of the auditor is involved. 

	
Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
369
As mentioned, the auditor must evaluate the collectibility of individual problem accounts and 
consider whether the historically derived percentages are reasonable, given the current eco­
nomic and industry conditions.
Classification
The major issues related to the presentation and disclosure assertion about classification 
are (1) identifying and reclassifying any material credits contained in accounts receivable, 
(2) segregating short-term and long-term receivables, and (3) ensuring that different types 
of receivables are properly classified. In many entities, when a customer pays in advance or 
a credit is issued, the amount is credited to the customer’s accounts receivable account. The 
auditor should determine the amount of such credits and, if material, reclassify them as either 
a deposit or another type of liability. The second issue requires that the auditor identify and 
separate short-term receivables from long-term receivables. Long-term receivables should 
not be included with trade accounts receivable. The auditor must also ensure that nontrade 
receivables are properly separated from trade accounts receivable. For example, receivables 
from officers, employees, or related parties should not be included with trade accounts receiv­
able because users might be misled if such receivables are combined.
Other Presentation and Disclosure Assertions
Disclosure is important for accounts receivable and related accounts. While management is 
responsible for the financial statements, the auditor must ensure that all necessary disclo­
sures are made. Most public accounting firms use some type of financial statement reporting 
checklist to ensure that all necessary disclosures are made for each account (completeness). 
Table 10–11 presents examples of disclosure items for the revenue process and related finan­
cial statement accounts. Exhibit 10–6 presents two examples of common disclosures for 
revenue-related accounts. The first disclosure relates to the basis for recognizing revenue. 
This disclosure is normally included in a footnote that describes significant accounting poli­
cies. The second example presents disclosure of related-party transactions. Disclosures about 
related-party transactions normally discuss the nature of the transactions, the amounts, and 
whether the transactions were similar in terms to those for unrelated parties.

Sales are recognized when the company’s products are shipped. Sales to customers with whom the com­
pany has reciprocal purchase agreements are accounted for in the same manner as intercompany transac­
tions and are eliminated in the financial statements.

were $990,000 and $1,244,000 for the two years ended 2015 and 2014. Accounts receivable from Dayco 
were $243,000 and $489,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The company believes that 
the terms of sale were substantially the same as those available to unrelated parties for similar products.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The Confirmation Process—Accounts Receivable
Confirmation is audit evidence that is a direct written response from a third party (the con­
firming party) to the auditor, in paper form or by electronic or other medium. There is a pre­
sumption in auditing standards that auditors will request confirmation of accounts receivable 
during an audit. However, auditing standards allow the auditor to omit confirming accounts 
receivable in the following circumstances:
	
∙	 The accounts receivable balance is immaterial.
	
∙	 External confirmations would be ineffective. (This might occur if, based on prior 
experience, the auditor determines that the response rate might be low or the 
responses might not be reliable.)
	
∙	 The auditor’s assessed level of risk of material misstatement at the relevant assertion 
level is low, and the other planned substantive procedures address the assessed risk.
Because of the importance of accounts receivable confirmations, the auditor should doc­
ument completely the decision not to gather such evidence.
LO 10-13
Practice 
INSIGHT
Audit deficiencies identified in PCAOB inspections include auditors not documenting how they over­
came the presumption that the auditor will request the confirmation of accounts receivable and 
­documenting reasons that are not among the acceptable conditions for not requesting confirmations.
Confirmations can address more than one assertion. However, confirmations normally 
provide different levels of assurance for different assertions. Accounts receivable confirma­
tions are generally a good source of evidence for testing the existence assertion. If the cus­
tomer confirms the amount owed to the entity, the auditor has appropriate evidence that the 
account receivable is valid.2 Accounts receivable confirmations may also provide evidence on 
the cutoff, completeness, and valuation assertions. For example, a customer’s confirmation of 
the dollar amount owed provides some evidence on the valuation assertion.
A number of factors affect the reliability of accounts receivable confirmations. The audi­
tor should consider each of the following factors when using confirmations to test accounts 
receivable:
	
∙	 The type of confirmation request.
	
∙	 Prior experience with the client or similar engagements.
	
∙	 The intended respondent.
The types of confirmations are discussed in the next section. The auditor should consider 
prior experience with the client in terms of confirmation response rates, misstatements identi­
fied, and the accuracy of returned confirmations when assessing the reliability of accounts 
receivable confirmations. For example, if response rates were low in prior audits, the auditor 
might consider obtaining evidence using alternative procedures. The auditor should consider 
each respondent’s competence, knowledge, ability, and objectivity when assessing the reli­
ability of confirmation requests. For example, if an auditor is confirming accounts receivable 
for a small retail organization, it is possible that the respondents may not have the knowledge 
or ability to respond appropriately to the confirmation request. In addition, some large organi­
zations and government agencies do not respond to confirmations because it may be difficult 
to accumulate the necessary data, since they are on a voucher system. Such nonresponses 
must be tested using procedures discussed later in the chapter.
2Research has shown that accounts receivable confirmations are not always a reliable source of evidence. See  
P. Caster, R. J. Elder, and D. J. Janvrin, “A Summary of Research and Enforcement Release Evidence on Confirma-
tion Use and Effectiveness,” Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory (November 2008), pp. 253–280, for a discus-
sion of these findings.

	
Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
371
Types of Confirmations
There are two types of confirmations: positive and negative. A positive accounts receiv­
able confirmation requests that customers indicate whether they agree with the amount due 
to the client stated in the confirmation. Thus, a response is required regardless of whether 
the customer believes the amount is correct or incorrect. Sometimes an auditor will use a 
“blank” form of positive confirmation, in which the request requires the customer to provide 
the amount owed to the client. Positive confirmations are generally used when an account’s 
individual balances are large or if errors are anticipated because the risk of material misstate­
ments has been judged to be high. Exhibit 10–7 presents an example of a positive confirma­
tion request.
A negative confirmation requests that customers respond only when they disagree with 
the amount due to the client. An example of a negative confirmation request is shown in 
Exhibit 10–8. The auditor should not use negative confirmation requests as the sole substan­
tive audit procedure to address an assessed risk of material misstatement at the assertion level, 
unless all of the following are present:
	
∙	 The auditor has assessed the risk of material misstatement as low and has obtained 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the operating effectiveness of controls 
relevant to the assertion.

∙	 The population of items subject to negative confirmation procedures comprises a 
large number of small, homogeneous account balances, transactions, or conditions.
	
∙	 A very low exception rate is expected.
	
∙	 The auditor is not aware of circumstances or conditions that would cause recipients of 
negative confirmation requests to disregard such requests.
On some audit engagements, a combination of positive and negative confirmations is 
used to test accounts receivable because of materiality considerations and a mix of customers. 
For example, positive confirmations may be sent to selected large-dollar customer accounts 
and negative confirmations sent to a sample of small-dollar customer accounts.
Because positive accounts receivable confirmations require that customers respond 
to the auditor, any amounts for which responses are not received must be verified by the 
auditor using alternative procedures. Negative accounts receivable confirmations require a 
response only when the information about the customer’s balance is incorrect. Therefore, 
a nonresponse to a negative confirmation request is generally assumed to represent a valid 
account receivable. This can be a major drawback to the use of negative confirmations 
because a nonresponse may just mean the confirmation was simply ignored and discarded. 
For this reason, negative confirmations generally provide little assurance, that is, they may 
help “top off” an assurance bucket that is nearly full from other forms of audit evidence.
The accuracy of the accounts receivable confirmation request can generally be improved 
if a copy of the customer’s monthly statement is enclosed with the confirmation request.
Timing
Accounts receivable may be confirmed at an interim date or at year-end. Such considerations 
were discussed in Chapter 6. The confirmation request should be sent soon after the end of the 
accounting period in order to maximize the response rate. Sending the confirmations at the 
end of the accounting period reduces the chance of timing differences arising due to process­
ing of purchases and cash disbursements by the customers.

Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
373
Confirmation Procedures
The auditor must maintain control over the accounts receivable confirmations so as to 
minimize the possibility that direct communication between the customers and the audi­
tor is biased by interception or alteration of the receivable confirmation by the entity. This 
includes determining the information to be confirmed; selecting the appropriate confirm­
ing parties; designing the confirmation requests, including determining that requests are 
properly directed to the appropriate confirming parties and provide for being responded 
to directly to the auditor; and sending the requests, including follow-up requests to any 
nonresponding confirming parties. For control purposes, the auditor should mail the con­
firmations outside the entity’s facilities. Direct mailing from the public accounting firm’s 
office generally provides the best control. To ensure that any confirmations that are unde­
liverable by the post office are returned to the auditors and not the entity, the confirmations 
should be mailed in envelopes with the public accounting firm’s address listed as the return 
address. The envelope used by customers for returning the confirmation response should 
also be addressed to the public accounting firm. The fact that undeliverable confirmations 
are returned directly to the auditor also provides some assurance that fictitious customers 
are identified.
The auditor should maintain a record of the confirmations mailed and those returned. 
When positive confirmations are used, the auditor generally follows up with second, and pos­
sibly third, requests to customers who do not reply, in an attempt to increase the response rate 
to the confirmation requests. In some cases, a customer may respond using electronic media 
(such as e-mail or fax) or orally. In such situations the auditor should verify the source and 
contents of the communication. For example, a fax response may be verified by a telephone 
call to the respondent, and an oral response can be verified by requesting a written communi­
cation from the respondent.
Each confirmation exception (that is, difference between the recorded balance and the 
balance confirmed by the customer) should be carefully examined by the auditor to determine 
the reason for the difference. In many cases, exceptions result from what are referred to as tim­
ing differences. Such differences occur because of delays in recording transactions in either 
the client’s or the customer’s records. For example, the client may ship goods to a customer 
on the last day of the period and record it as a current-period sale. The customer will probably 
receive and record the goods as a purchase in the next period. Such situations are not errors 
and result only because of a delay in recording the transaction. Payment for goods by a cus­
tomer at the end of the period can result in a timing difference if the customer prepares and 
records the payment in the current period but the client receives and records the receipt in the 
following period. Again, the difference in the confirmed amount results from a timing differ­
ence. Table 10–12 presents some examples of exceptions and their potential causes.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Alternative Procedures
When the auditor does not receive responses to positive confirmations, he or she must apply 
alternative procedures to determine the existence and valuation of the accounts receivable. 
Auditors normally send second and third requests; and if necessary, they perform the follow­
ing alternative audit procedures:
	
∙	 Examination of specific subsequent cash receipts.
	
∙	 Examination of shipping documentation.
	
∙	 Examination of other client documentation.
Examination of subsequent cash receipts involves checking the accounts receivable sub­
sidiary ledger for payments of the specific sales invoices included in the customers’ accounts 
receivable balances that were outstanding at the date of the confirmation. If the auditor has 
obtained evidence that the client’s controls are strong for recording cash receipts and the 
amount collected is a significant portion of the accounts receivable balance, the auditor may 
stop at this point. If the client’s controls are weak, the auditor may extend the testing by trac­
ing the payment in the subsidiary ledger to the cash receipts journal and to the bank statement. 
If the customer has paid for the goods, the auditor has strong evidence concerning the exis­
tence and valuation of the accounts receivable.
If a customer has not paid the accounts receivable, the auditor can examine the underly­
ing documentation that supports the revenue transaction. This documentation includes the 
original customer order or shipping document. If this documentation indicates that the cus­
tomer ordered the goods and the goods were shipped, then the auditor would have evidence 
supporting the validity of the accounts receivable. Last, the auditor may need to examine 
other correspondence between the client and the customer to obtain adequate evidence on the 
validity and valuation of the accounts receivable.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Properly controlled electronic confirmations may be considered to be reliable audit evidence. If the 
auditor is satisfied that the electronic confirmation process is secure and properly controlled and the 
confirmation is directly from a third party who is a bona fide authorized respondent, electronic confir­
mations may be considered as an appropriate, valid confirmation response. Various means might be 
used to validate the sender of electronic information and the respondent’s authorization to confirm the 
requested information. For example, the use of encryption and electronic digital signatures may improve 
the security of the electronic confirmation process. Capital Confirmation Inc. has created CONFIRM™, a 
secure electronic audit confirmation clearinghouse (see http://www.confirmation.com). With this service, 
auditors can send and receive confirmations in as little as 24 hours with a very high response rate.

During an inspection, the PCAOB inspection team found that a regional accounting firm sent 
accounts receivable confirmations to selected accounts to test existence. For unreturned confirma­
tions, the firm tested for subsequent cash receipts. However, many of those accounts had not been 
paid and the firm did not perform any additional procedures. (PCAOB Release 104-2009-053).
Auditing Other Receivables
Up to this point the discussion has concentrated on trade accounts receivable. Most enti­
ties, however, have other types of receivables that are reported on the balance sheet. Some 
examples include
	
∙	 Receivables from officers and employees.
	
∙	 Receivables from related parties.
	
∙	 Notes receivable.
LO 10-14

	
Chapter 10    Auditing the Revenue Process	
375
The auditor’s concern with satisfying the assertions for these receivables is similar to that 
for trade accounts receivable. Typically, each of these types of receivables is confirmed and 
evaluated for collectibility. The transactions that result in receivables from related parties are 
examined to determine if they were at “arm’s length.” Notes receivable would also be confirmed 
and examined for repayment terms and whether interest income has been properly recognized.
Evaluating the Audit Findings— 
Revenue-Related Accounts
When the auditor has completed the planned substantive procedures, the aggregate misstate­
ment for accounts receivable is determined. The aggregate misstatement is then compared to the 
tolerable misstatement. If the aggregate misstatement is less than the tolerable misstatement, 
the auditor may accept the account as fairly presented. Conversely, if the aggregate misstate­
ment exceeds the tolerable misstatement, the auditor may conclude that the account is not fairly 
presented. For example, in Chapter 3, a tolerable misstatement for EarthWear was $900,000. 
Suppose that, after completing the substantive procedures, EarthWear’s auditor determines that 
the aggregate misstatement is $250,000. In this case, the auditor may conclude that Earth­
Wear’s accounts receivable are not materially misstated. However, if the aggregate misstate­
ment is $975,000, the auditor’s conclusion will be that the account is materially misstated.
The auditor should also analyze the misstatements discovered through substantive pro­
cedures. In some instances, these misstatements may provide additional evidence on con­
trol risk. By identifying the causes of the misstatements, the auditor may determine that the 
original assessment of control risk was too low. For example, the auditor may lower his or her 
evaluation of the effectiveness of the control for granting credit (that is, may increase control 
risk) based on a large number of misstatements detected during tests of the allowance for 
uncollectible accounts. This may impact the auditor’s assessment of audit risk.
If the auditor concludes that audit risk is unacceptably high, additional audit procedures 
should be performed, the client should adjust the related financial statement accounts to an 
acceptable level, or a qualified report should be issued. In the previous example, in which 
EarthWear’s auditor determined that the aggregate misstatement was $975,000, additional 
audit procedures might be required. Such audit procedures would typically be directed at the 
systematic errors detected by the substantive procedures. For example, if the substantive tests of 
transactions indicated that sales invoices were priced incorrectly, the auditor’s additional audit 
procedures would focus on determining the extent of pricing misstatements. Alternatively, the 
auditor could conclude that accounts receivable are fairly presented if EarthWear’s manage­
ment adjusts the financial statements by $75,000 or more ($975,000 - $900,000). While clients 
will typically make the full adjustment, an adjustment of at least $75,000 would result in the 
aggregate misstatement being equal to or less than the tolerable misstatement of $900,000.
In summary, the final decision about accounts receivable and the related accounts is 
based on whether sufficient appropriate evidence has been obtained from the substantive tests 
conducted.

PROBLEMS
All applicable problems are available with Connect.
	
LO 10-1	
10-24	 For each of the following situations based on SAB No. 101, indicate the audit evi­
dence that should be obtained to determine whether revenue should be recognized or 
not in the current period.
	
1.	 Your client, Thomson Telecom, maintains an inventory of telecommunications 
equipment. Bayone Telephone Company placed an order for 10 new transform­
ers valued at $5 million, and Thomson delivered them just prior to December 31. 
Thomson’s normal business practice for this class of customer is to enter into a 
written sales agreement that requires the signatures of all the authorized repre­
sentatives of Thomson and its customer before the contract is binding. However, 
Bayone has not signed the sales agreement because it is awaiting the requisite 
approval by the legal department. Bayone’s purchasing department has orally 
agreed to the contract, and the purchasing manager has assured you that the con­
tract will be approved the first week of next year.
	
2.	 Best Products is a retailer of appliances that offers “layaway” sales to its customers 
twice a year. Best retains the merchandise, sets it aside in its inventory, and collects 
a cash deposit from the customer. The customer signs an installment note at the time 
the initial deposit is received, but no payments are due until 30 days after delivery.
	
3.	 Dave’s Discount Stores is a discount retailer that generates revenue from the sale 
of membership fees it charges customers to shop at its stores. The membership 
arrangement requires the customer to pay the entire membership fee (usually 
$48) at the beginning of the arrangement. However, the customer can unilaterally 
cancel the membership arrangement and receive a refund of the unused portion. 
Based on past experiences, Dave’s estimates that 35 percent of the customers will 
cancel their memberships before the end of the contract.
	
LO 10-2, 10-5, 	
10-25	 The Art Appreciation Society operates a museum for the benefit and enjoyment of
	
10-6, 10-9	
	 the community. During the hours the museum is open to the public, two clerks who 
are positioned at the entrance collect a five-dollar admission fee from each nonmem­
ber patron. Members of the Art Appreciation Society are permitted to enter free of 
charge upon presentation of their membership cards.
	
	
	 	
At the end of each day one of the clerks delivers the proceeds to the treasurer. The 
treasurer counts the cash in the presence of the clerk and places it in a safe. Each 
Friday afternoon the treasurer and one of the clerks deliver all cash held in the safe 
to the bank and receive an authenticated deposit slip, which provides the basis for the 
weekly entry in the cash receipts journal.
	
	
	 	
The board of directors of the Art Appreciation Society has identified a need to 
improve the internal control system over cash admission fees. The board has deter­
mined that the cost of installing turnstiles or sales booths or otherwise altering the 
physical layout of the museum would greatly exceed any benefits that might be 
derived. However, the board has agreed that the sale of admission tickets must be an 
integral part of its improvement efforts.
	
	
	 	
Smith has been asked by the board of directors of the Art Appreciation Society to 
review the internal control over cash admission fees and suggest improvements.
Required:
Indicate weaknesses in the existing internal control system over cash admission 
fees, which Smith should identify, and recommend one improvement for each of the 
weaknesses identified. Organize your answer as indicated in the following example:
Weakness
Recommendation
1. There is no basis for establishing the documentation 
of the number of paying patrons.
1. Prenumbered admission tickets should be issued 
upon payment of the admission fee.

10-29	 During the year, Strang Corporation began to encounter cash-flow difficulties, and 
	
10-15	
	 a cursory review by management revealed receivable collection problems. Strang’s 
management engaged Stanley, CPA, to perform a special investigation. Stanley stud­
ied the billing and collection process and noted the following:
	
	
	 ∙	 The accounting department employs one bookkeeper, who receives and opens 
all incoming mail. This bookkeeper is also responsible for depositing receipts, 
filing remittance advices on a daily basis, recording receipts in the cash receipts 
journal, and posting receipts in the individual customer accounts and the general 
ledger accounts. There are no cash sales. The bookkeeper prepares and controls 
the mailing of monthly statements to customers.
	
	
	 ∙	 The concentration of functions and the receivable collection problems caused 
Stanley to suspect that a systematic defalcation of customers’ payments through a 
delayed posting of remittances (lapping of accounts receivable) is present. Stan­
ley was surprised to find that no customers complained about receiving erroneous 
monthly statements.
Required:
Identify the procedures Stanley should perform to determine whether lapping exists. 
Do not discuss deficiencies in the internal control system.

DISCUSSION CASES
	
LO 10-1	
10-31	 SEC Accounting and Auditing Enforcement Release (AAER) No. 108 specifies cer­
tain conditions or criteria that a bill and hold transaction of a public company should 
meet in order to qualify for revenue recognition. The AAER also specifies certain 
factors that should be considered in evaluating whether a bill and hold transaction 
meets the requirements for revenue recognition. AAER No. 108 states that a “bill 
and hold” transaction should meet the following conditions:
	
∙	 The risks of ownership must have passed to the buyer.
	
∙	 The customer must have made a fixed commitment to purchase the goods, prefer­
ably reflected in written documentation.
	
∙	 The buyer, not the seller, must request that the transaction be on a bill and hold 
basis. The buyer must have a substantial business purpose for ordering the goods 
on a bill and hold basis.
	
∙	 There must be a fixed schedule for delivery of the goods. The date for deliv­
ery must be reasonable and must be consistent with the buyer’s business purpose 
(e.g., storage periods are customary in the industry).
	
∙	 The seller must not have retained any specific performance obligations such that 
the earning process is not complete.
	
∙	 The ordered goods must have been segregated from the seller’s inventory and not 
be subject to being used to fill other orders.
	
∙	 The equipment must be complete and ready for shipment.

	 Identify and discuss the reliability of the types of evidence an auditor would need to 
determine whether each condition cited above was met for a bill and hold transaction.
	
LO 10-14, 10-15	
10-32	 Friendly Furniture, Inc., a manufacturer of fine hardwood furniture, is a publicly 
held SEC-registered company with a December 31 year-end. During May, Friendly 
had a flood due to heavy rains at its major manufacturing facility that damaged about 
$525,000 of furniture. Friendly is insured for the property loss at replacement value 
and carries business interruption insurance for lost production. The company antici­
pates that the total insurance proceeds will exceed the carrying value of the destroyed 
furniture and the cost of repairing the facility will be in the range of $700,000 to 
$1.75 million. The company believes that the insurance carrier will advance approxi­
mately 50 percent of the expected proceeds sometime during July. The company has 
resumed its operations to about one-half of normal capacity and expects to operate at 
full capacity by September. The company does not expect to file a formal insurance 
claim until then because it expects that the entire cost of the business interruption 
will not be known until September. Friendly expects to receive the proceeds of the 
settlement from the insurance carrier during its fourth quarter.
	
	
	 	
The company is in the process of making a stock offering and will file a reg­
istration statement with the SEC at the end of July, in which it will present stub 
period financial statements covering the six-month period through June 30. Based 
on the minimum amount of the expected proceeds, Friendly would like to recognize 
a receivable for the insurance proceeds and to report a gain in its financial statements 
for the period ended June 30. The company would also like to allocate a portion of 
the expected proceeds to cost of products sold.
Required:
	
a.	 How much of the expected proceeds from insurance coverage, if any, should 
Friendly include in its June 30 financial statements? Justify your answer with 
relevant accounting pronouncements.
	
b.	 Assuming that Friendly records a receivable from the insurance company at June 
30 for the proceeds, what type of audit evidence would the auditor gather to sup­
port the amount recorded?

Auditing the Purchasing Process
T
he second major business process focuses on the purchase of and pay­
ment for goods and services from outside vendors. The acquisition of 
goods and services includes the purchase of raw materials, supplies, 
manufacturing equipment, furniture, and fixtures and payment for repairs and 
maintenance, utilities, and professional services. This process does not include 
hiring and paying employees or the internal allocation of costs within an entity. 
Chapter 12 covers the human resource management process.
This chapter begins by reviewing expense and liability recognition con­
cepts with particular emphasis on the categories of expenses. The framework 
developed in Chapter 10 on the revenue process is used to present the audi­
tor’s consideration of internal control. This framework starts with an overview 
of the purchasing process, including the types of transactions, the documents 
and records involved, and the functions included in the process. Inherent risk 
factors that relate directly to the purchasing process are covered next. Assess­
ment of control risk is then presented, followed by a discussion of control activ­
ities and tests of controls. The last sections of the chapter cover the audit of 
accounts payable and accrued expenses, the major liability accounts affected 
by the process. Auditing the expense accounts affected by the purchasing pro­
cess is covered in Chapter 15. While the main focus of this chapter is auditing 
the purchasing process for a financial statement audit, the concepts covered 
for setting control risk are applicable to an audit of internal control over finan­
cial reporting for public companies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. An 
Advanced Module discusses the audit issues related to auditing the tax provi­
sion and related balance sheet accounts.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Expense and Liability Recognition
Many transactions processed through a typical purchasing process involve the recognition of 
an expense and its corresponding liability. As a result, the auditor should understand the basic 
underlying concepts of expense and liability recognition in order to audit the purchasing pro­
cess. FASB Concept Statement No. 6, “Elements of Financial Statements,” defines expenses 
and liabilities as follows:
Expenses are outflows or other using up of assets or incurrences of liabilities (or a combination of 
both) from delivering or producing goods, rendering services, or carrying out other activities that 
constitute the entity’s ongoing major or central operations. (¶80)
Liabilities are probable future sacrifices of economic benefits arising from present obligations 
of a particular entity to transfer assets or provide services to other entities in the future as a result 
of past transactions or events. (¶35)
An entity’s expense recognition policies and the type of expenses involved affect how 
the transactions are recorded and accounted for in the financial statements. FASB State­
ment of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5, “Recognition and Measurement in Financial 
Statements of Business Enterprises,” indicates that expenses can be classified into three 
categories.
	
1.	 Certain expenses can be matched directly with specific transactions or events and are 
recognized upon recognition of revenue. These types of expenses are referred to as 
product costs and include expenses such as cost of goods sold.
	
2.	 Many expenses are recognized during the period in which cash is spent or liabilities 
incurred for goods and services that are used up at that time or shortly thereafter. 
Such expenses cannot be directly related to specific transactions and are assumed to 
provide no future benefit. These expenses are referred to as period costs. Examples 
of such expenses include administrative salaries and rent expense.
	
3.	 Some expenses are allocated by systematic and rational procedures to the periods 
during which the related assets are expected to provide benefits. Depreciation of 
plant and equipment is an example of such an expense.
In general, the liabilities normally incurred as part of the purchasing process are trade 
accounts payable. Other incurred expenses are accrued as liabilities at the end of each account­
ing period. Most expenses recognized are product or period costs.
Overview of the Purchasing Process
A purchase transaction usually begins with a purchase requisition being generated by a depart­
ment or support function. The purchasing department prepares a purchase order for the pur­
chase of goods or services from a vendor. When the goods are received or the services have 
been rendered, the entity records a liability to the vendor. Finally, the entity pays the vendor. 
Exhibit 11–1 describes EarthWear’s purchasing system.

INSIGHT
The WorldCom fraud illustrates how expenses may be improperly capitalized as assets to inflate net 
income. WorldCom inappropriately capitalized telephone line maintenance cost as assets instead of 
recording them as period expenses. Some common examples of fraudulent capitalization schemes 
include software development costs, research and development and start-up costs, interest and 
advertising costs, recording fictitious fixed assets, and depreciation and amortization schemes.

Stop and Think: Review Exhibit 11–1. Do any risks seem especially apparent? 
If so, how might these risks impact the nature, timing, and extent of your audit 
procedures?
Figure 11–1 presents the flowchart for EarthWear’s purchasing system, which serves as 
a framework for discussing control activities and tests of controls. As mentioned pre­
viously, accounting applications are tailored to meet the specific needs of the entity. 
You should focus on the basic concepts so that they can be applied to the specific 
purchasing ­processes encountered. The following topics related to the purchasing process 
are covered:
	
∙	 Types of transactions and financial statement accounts affected.
	
∙	 Types of documents and records.
	
∙	 The major functions.
	
∙	 The key segregation of duties.
Types of Transactions and Financial Statement 
Accounts Affected
Three types of transactions are processed through the purchasing process:
	
∙	 Purchase of goods and services for cash or credit.
	
∙	 Payment of the liabilities arising from such purchases.
	
∙	 Return of goods to suppliers for cash or credit.
The first type is a purchase transaction that includes acquiring goods and services. The 
second type is a cash disbursement transaction that involves paying the liabilities that result 
from purchasing goods and services. The final type is a purchase return transaction, in which 
goods previously purchased are returned to a supplier for cash or credit.
LO 11-3
Description of EarthWear’s Purchasing System
The major purchasing activity for EarthWear involves the purchase of clothing and other products 
that are styled and quality crafted by the entity’s design department. All goods are produced by 
independent manufacturers, except for most of EarthWear’s soft luggage. The entity purchases 
merchandise from more than 200 domestic and foreign manufacturers. For many major suppliers, goods 
are ordered and paid for through the entity’s electronic data interchange (EDI) system. The computerized 
inventory control system handles the receipt of shipments from manufacturers, permitting faster access to 
newly arrived merchandise.
Purchases of other goods and services are made in accordance with EarthWear’s purchasing autho­
rization policies. Entity personnel complete a purchase requisition, which is forwarded to the purchasing 
department for processing. Purchasing agents obtain competitive bids and enter the information into the 
purchase order program. A copy of the purchase order is sent to the vendor. Goods are received at the 
receiving department, where the information is agreed to the purchase order. The receiving report is 
forwarded to the accounts payable department, which matches the receiving report to the purchase order 
and vendor invoice. The accounts payable department prepares a voucher packet and enters the informa­
tion into the accounts payable program.
When payment is due on a vendor invoice, the accounts payable program generates a cash disburse­
ment report that is reviewed by the accounts payable department. Items approved for payment are 
entered into the cash disbursement program, and a check is printed or an electronic funds transfer (EFT) 
is approved. The checks are sent to the cashier’s department for mailing.

Purchase Requisition  This document requests goods or services for an authorized indi­
vidual or department within the entity. Examples of such requests include an order for sup­
plies from an office supervisor and an order for newspaper advertising space from a marketing 
manager. In EarthWear’s purchasing system, the design department would generate purchase 
requisitions to acquire goods for sale.

392	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Purchase Order  This document includes the description, quality, and quantity of, and 
other information on, the goods or services being purchased. The purchase order also indi­
cates who approved the acquisition and represents the authorization to purchase the goods or 
services. The purchase order may be mailed, faxed, or placed by telephone with the supplier 
or vendor. At EarthWear some purchase orders may be generated by the design department, 
reviewed by a purchasing agent, and then sent to a vendor using the entity’s EDI system.
Receiving Report  This document records the receipt of goods. Normally, the receiving 
report is a copy of the purchase order with the quantities omitted. This procedure encour­
ages receiving department personnel to make an adequate, independent count of the goods 
received. Receiving department personnel record the date, description, quantity, and other 
information on this document. In some instances, the quality of the goods is determined by 
receiving department personnel. In other cases, an inspection department determines whether 
the goods meet the required specifications. The receiving report is important because receiv­
ing goods is generally the event that leads to recognition of the liability by the entity.
Vendor Invoice  This document is the bill from the vendor. The vendor invoice includes 
the description and quantity of the goods shipped or services provided, the price including 
freight, the terms of trade including cash discounts, and the date billed.
Voucher  This document is frequently used by entities to control payment for acquired 
goods and services. This document serves as the basis for recording a vendor’s invoice in the 
voucher register or purchases journal. In many purchasing systems, such as EarthWear’s, the 
voucher is attached to the purchase requisition, purchase order, receiving report, and vendor 
invoice to create a voucher packet. The voucher packet thus contains all the relevant documen­
tation supporting a purchase transaction.
Voucher Register/Purchases Journal  A voucher register is used to record the vouchers 
for goods and services. The voucher register contains numerous columns for recording the 
account classifications for the goods or services, including a column for recording credits 
to accounts payable, and columns for recording debits to asset accounts such as inventory 
and expense accounts such as repairs and maintenance. The voucher register also contains 
columns for miscellaneous debits and credits. Some entities use a purchases journal instead 
of a voucher register. With a purchases journal, either vouchers or vendors’ invoices may be 
used to record the liability. The major difference between a voucher register and a purchases 
journal is in the way individual vouchers or vendor invoices are summarized. When a voucher 
register is used, the details of accounts payable are normally represented by a list of unpaid 
vouchers. With a purchases journal, subsidiary records are normally maintained by the vendor 
in much the same manner as an accounts receivable subsidiary ledger. However, in a com­
puterized environment, a vendor number can be assigned to each voucher and the voucher 
register can be sorted by vendor to produce a subsidiary ledger for accounts payable.
Accounts Payable Subsidiary Ledger  When a purchases journal is utilized, this subsid­
iary ledger records the transactions with, and the balance owed to, a vendor. When a voucher 
register system is used, the subsidiary ledger is a listing of the unpaid vouchers. The total in 
the subsidiary ledger should equal the balance in the general ledger accounts payable account.
Vendor Statement  This statement is sent monthly by the vendor to indicate the beginning 
balance, current-period purchases and payments, and ending balance. The vendor’s state­
ment represents the purchase activity recorded on the vendor’s records. It may differ from the 
entity’s records because of errors or, more often, timing differences due to delays in shipping 
goods or recording cash receipts. The entity verifies the accuracy of its records by comparing 
vendor statements with the accounts payable records.

	
Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
393
Check or Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)  These disbursements, approved by an autho­
rized individual, pay for goods or services.
Cash Disbursements Journal/Check Register  This journal records disbursements made 
by check and electronic funds transfer. It is sometimes referred to as a check register. The cash 
disbursements journal contains columns for recording credits to cash and debits to accounts 
payable and cash discounts. Columns may also record miscellaneous debits and credits. Pay­
ments recorded in the cash disbursements journal are also recorded in the voucher register or 
in the accounts payable subsidiary ledger, depending on which system is used by the entity.
The Major Functions
The principal business objectives of the purchasing process are acquiring goods and services 
at the lowest cost consistent with quality and service requirements and effectively using cash 
resources to pay for those goods and services. Table 11–2 lists the functions that are normally 
part of the purchasing process.
Requisitioning  The initial function in the purchasing process is a request for goods or 
services by an authorized individual from any department or functional area within the entity 
(see Figure 11–1). The important issue is that the request meets the authorization procedures 
implemented by the entity. One frequent organizational control is the establishment of autho­
rization dollar limits for different levels of employees and executives. For example, depart­
ment supervisors may be authorized to acquire goods or services up to $1,000, department 
managers up to $5,000, and divisional heads up to $25,000, while any expenditure greater 
than $100,000 requires approval by the board of directors.

INSIGHT
Electronic forms, stored in digital format databases, allow for automatic information routing and inte­
gration into other information systems applications. The use of electronic forms is ideal for track­
ing and managing processes when human oversight, approvals, or information input needs to be 
combined with standard elements of information. For example, supplies may be requisitioned by 
an employee and automatically forwarded to a manager for approval. Once approved, the order 
may then be input into an EDI translator and forwarded to the appropriate vendor by means of a 
structured XML EDI transaction. Electronic forms add value to the organization, but the auditor must 
understand these IT systems and test the e-commerce, general, and application controls.

Requisitioning
Initiation and approval of requests for goods and services by authorized individuals 
consistent with management criteria.
Purchasing

Purchasing  The purchasing function executes properly authorized purchase orders. This 
function is normally performed by a purchasing department (see Figure 11–1), which is 
headed by a purchasing manager (or agent) and has one or more buyers responsible for spe­
cific goods or services. The purchasing function ensures that goods and services are acquired 
in appropriate quantities and at the lowest price consistent with quality standards and delivery 

394	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
schedules. Using multiple vendors and requiring competitive bidding are two ways the pur­
chasing function can achieve its objectives.
Receiving  The receiving function is responsible for receiving, counting, and inspecting 
goods received from vendors. The personnel in the receiving department complete a receiving 
report that is forwarded to the accounts payable function.
Invoice Processing  The accounts payable department (see Figure 11–1) processes 
invoices to ensure that all goods and services received are recorded as assets or expenses 
and that the corresponding liability is recognized. This function involves matching purchase 
orders to receiving reports and vendor invoices as to terms, quantities, prices, and extensions. 
The invoice-processing function also compares the account distributions with established 
account classifications.
The invoice-processing function is also responsible for purchased goods returned to ven­
dors. Appropriate records and control activities must document the return of the goods and 
initiate any charges back to the vendor.
Disbursements  The disbursement function is responsible for preparing and signing 
checks for paying vendors and authorizing electronic funds transfers. Adequate supporting 
documentation must verify that the disbursement is for a legitimate business purpose, that 
the transaction was properly authorized, and that the account distribution is appropriate. To 
reduce the possibility that the invoice will be paid twice, all documentation (such as purchase 
order, receiving report, and vendor invoice) should be marked “CANCELED” or “PAID” by 
the cashier’s department. Finally, if checks are used, they should be mailed to the vendor by 
the cashier’s department or treasurer.
If IT is used to prepare checks and EFTs, adequate user controls must ensure that only 
authorized transactions are submitted for payment. Adequate control totals should also be used 
to agree the amount of payables submitted with the amount of cash disbursed. Checks over 
a specified limit should be reviewed. For example, in EarthWear’s system (see Figure 11–1), 
the accounts payable department matches the purchase order to the receiving report and the 
vendor’s invoice. The voucher is then input into the accounts payable program. When the 
vouchers are due for payment, they are printed out on a cash disbursement report. Accounts 
payable personnel review the items to be paid and input them into the cash disbursement 
program. The checks are forwarded to the cashier’s department for review and mailing to ven­
dors. If a signature plate is used for signing checks, it must be properly controlled within the 
cashier’s department or by the treasurer.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Fraudulent disbursements may include payments made to shell companies or ghost vendors, com­
mission expense schemes, purchases made by employees for personal benefit, duplicate expense 
reimbursements, and other fictitious expenses.
Accounts Payable  The accounts payable department (see Figure 11–1) is also responsible 
for ensuring that all vendor invoices, cash disbursements, and adjustments are recorded in 
the accounts payable records. In IT systems, these entries may be made directly as part of the 
normal processing of purchase, cash disbursement, or returns and allowances transactions. 
Proper use of control totals and daily activity reports provides controls for proper recording.
General Ledger  The main objective of the general ledger function for the purchasing pro­
cess is to ensure that all purchases, cash disbursements, and payables are properly accumu­
lated, classified, and summarized in the accounts. In an IT system, such as at EarthWear, 
the use of control or summary totals ensures that this function is performed correctly. The 
accounting department is normally responsible for this function.

	
Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
395
The Key Segregation of Duties
As discussed in previous chapters, proper segregation of duties is one of the most impor­
tant control activities in any accounting system. Duties should be assigned so that no one 
individual can control all phases of processing a transaction in a way that permits errors or 
fraud to go undetected. Because of the potential for theft and fraud in the purchasing process, 
individuals responsible for requisitioning, purchasing, and receiving should be segregated 
from the invoice-processing, accounts payable, and general ledger functions. If IT is used in 
the purchasing process, there should be proper segregation of duties in the IT department. 
Table 11–3 shows the key segregation of duties for the purchasing process and examples of 
possible errors or fraud that can result from conflicts in duties.
Table 11–4 shows the proper segregation of duties for purchasing and accounts payable 
functions across the various departments that process purchase transactions.
Stop and Think: Using Tables 11–3 and 11–4, briefly analyze EarthWear’s flowchart 
as shown in Figure 11–1. Evaluate whether EarthWear has sufficient segregation of 
duties and, if not, what errors or fraud could occur because of those conflicts of duties.
LO 11-6
Key Segregation of Duties in the Purchasing Process and Possible 
Errors or Fraud
Segregation of Duties
Possible Errors or Fraud Resulting from Conflicts of Duties
The purchasing function should be 
segregated from the requisitioning and 
receiving functions.
If one individual is responsible for the requisition, purchasing, and 
receiving functions, fictitious or unauthorized purchases can be 
made. This can result in the theft of goods and, possibly, payment for 
unauthorized purchases.
The invoice-processing function should 
be segregated from the accounts 
payable function.
If one individual is responsible for the invoice-processing and 
the accounts payable functions, purchase transactions can be 
processed at the wrong price or terms, or a cash disbursement can 
be processed for goods or services not received. This can result in 
overpayment for goods and services or the theft of cash.
The disbursement function should be 
segregated from the accounts payable 
function.
If one individual is responsible for the disbursement function and has 
access to the accounts payable records, unauthorized checks supported 
by fictitious documents can be issued, and unauthorized transactions 
can be recorded. This can result in theft of the entity’s cash.
The accounts payable function should be 
segregated from the general ledger 
function.
If one individual is responsible for the accounts payable records and for 
the general ledger, that individual can conceal any defalcation that 
would normally be detected by reconciling subsidiary records with 
the general ledger control account.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Inherent Risk Assessment
At the beginning of the audit of the purchasing process and its related accounts, the audi­
tor should consider the relevant inherent risk factors that may impact the transactions pro­
cessed and the financial statement accounts. As mentioned previously, most business risks are 
viewed as inherent risks. The following factors taken from Chapter 4 should be considered by 
the auditor in assessing the inherent risk for the purchasing process.
Industry-Related Factors
When auditing the purchasing process, the auditor should consider two important industry-
related factors in assessing inherent risk: whether the supply of raw materials is adequate and 
how volatile raw material prices are. If the entity deals with many vendors and prices tend to 
be relatively stable, there is less risk that the entity’s operations will be affected by raw mate­
rial shortages or that production costs will be difficult to control.
Some industries, however, are subject to such industry-related factors. For example, in 
the high-technology sector, there have been situations in which an entity was dependent on 
a single vendor to supply a critical component, such as a specialized computer chip. When 
the vendor has been unable to provide the component, the entity suffered production short­
ages and shipping delays that significantly affected financial performance. Other industries 
that produce basic commodities such as oil, coal, and precious metals can find their financial 
results significantly affected by swings in the prices and availability of their products. The 
auditor needs to assess the effects of such industry-related inherent risk factors in terms of 
assertions such as valuation.
Misstatements Detected in Prior Audits
Generally, the purchasing process and its related accounts are not difficult to audit and do not 
result in contentious accounting issues. However, auditing research has shown that the pur­
chasing process and its related accounts are likely to contain material misstatements.1 The 
auditor’s previous experience with the entity’s purchasing process should be reviewed as a 
starting point for determining inherent risk.
Control Risk Assessment
The discussion of control risk assessment follows the framework outlined in Chapter 6 on 
internal control and Chapter 10 on the revenue process. Again it is assumed that the auditor 
has decided to rely on controls (follow a reliance strategy). Figure 11–2 summarizes the major 
steps involved in setting control risk for the purchasing cycle.
Understand and Document Internal Control
In order to set control risk for the purchasing process, the auditor must understand the five 
components of internal control.
Control Environment  Table 6–3 in Chapter 6 lists factors that affect the control environ­
ment. Two factors are particularly important when the auditor considers the control envi­
ronment and the purchasing process: the entity’s organizational structure and its methods of 
assigning authority and responsibility. The entity’s organizational structure for purchasing 
may impact the auditor’s assessment of control risk because control activities are implemented

of Empirical Research,” Journal of Accounting Literature 2000 (19), pp. 1–43, for a detailed review of audit research 
studies that have examined sources of accounting errors.

within an organizational structure. Authority and responsibility for purchasing are usually 
granted via procedures that limit the amount of purchases that can be made by various levels 
of authority within the entity. The remaining discussions of the purchasing process assume 
that the control environment factors are reliable.
The Entity’s Risk Assessment Process  The auditor must understand how manage­
ment weighs the risks that are relevant to the purchasing process, estimates their significance, 
assesses the likelihood of their occurrence, and decides what actions to take to address those 
risks. Some of these risks include a new or revamped information system, rapid growth, and 
new technology. Each of these factors can represent a serious risk to an entity’s internal con­
trol system over purchases.
Control Activities  When a reliance strategy is adopted for the purchasing process, the 
auditor needs to understand the controls that exist to ensure that management’s objectives are 
being met. More specifically, the auditor identifies the controls that assure the auditor that the 
assertions are being met.
Information Systems and Communication  For each major class of transactions in the 
purchasing process, the auditor again needs to obtain the following information:
	
∙	 How purchases, cash disbursements, and purchase return transactions are initiated.
	
∙	 The accounting records, supporting documents, and accounts that are involved in 
processing purchases, cash disbursements, and purchase return transactions.
	
∙	 The flow of each type of transaction from initiation to inclusion in the financial 
statements, including computer processing of the data.
	
∙	 The process used to estimate accrued liabilities.
The auditor develops an understanding of the purchasing process by conducting a walk­
through. In the case of a continuing audit, the auditor has the prior years’ documentation of 
the process to assist in the walkthrough, although the possibility of changes in the system 
must be considered. If the system has been changed substantially or the audit is for a new 
entity, the auditor should document the system.
Monitoring of Controls  The auditor needs to understand the entity’s monitoring processes 
over the purchasing process, including how management assesses the design and operation of

controls. It also involves understanding how supervisory personnel within the process review the 
personnel who perform the controls and evaluating the performance of the entity’s IT system.
The auditor can document the purchasing process using procedures manuals, narrative 
descriptions, an internal control questionnaire, and a flowchart. For example, the following 
partial questionnaire (template) could be used to record the auditor’s documentation of the 
information about the controls in the purchasing process. A “Yes” response would indicate 
that the control was present.
Question
Yes
No
1. Are there written purchasing policies and procedures?
2. Are purchase requisitions approved in accordance with management’s authorization?
3. Are purchases made from approved vendors?
4. Are price quotations requested for purchases over an established amount?
5. Do purchase orders include adequate descriptions, terms, and instructions?
6. Are purchase orders approved by authorized personnel before issuance?
Plan and Perform Tests of Controls
The auditor systematically analyzes the purchasing process in order to identify controls that 
ensure that material misstatements are prevented or are detected and corrected. Such controls 
can be relied upon by the auditor to reduce control risk. For example, the entity may have for­
mal procedures for authorizing the acquisition of goods and services. The auditor may decide 
to rely on these controls to reduce control risk for the authorization assertion. Tests of controls 
would then be necessary to verify that this control is operating effectively. The auditor would 
examine a sample of purchase transactions to determine if the acquisition of the goods or ser­
vices is consistent with the entity’s authorization policy.
Set and Document Control Risk
After the controls are tested, the auditor sets the achieved level of control risk. When tests of 
controls support the planned level of control risk, no modifications are normally necessary to 
the planned level of detection risk, and the auditor may proceed with the planned substantive 
procedures. When the tests of controls do not support the planned level of control risk, the 
auditor must set a higher level of control risk. This results in a lower level of detection risk 
and leads to more substantive procedures than originally planned.
As discussed earlier, the auditor should document the achieved level of control risk. 
Documentation of the control risk for the purchasing process might include a flowchart, the 
results of tests of controls, and a memorandum indicating the auditor’s overall conclusion 
about the control risk.
Control Activities and Tests of Controls—Purchase 
Transactions
Table 11–5 presents the assertions about transactions and events, while Table 11–6 sum­
marizes the assertions for purchase transactions along with some examples of possible mis­
statements. For each of these misstatements we have included one or two possible control 
activities that management could implement to mitigate the risk as well as some example tests 
of controls that the auditor could use to test those controls. This table is not an exhaustive list 
of misstatements, control activities, or tests of controls for purchase transactions; rather, it 
provides some specific examples by assertion to help you understand the underlying concepts. 
Most of these controls exist within EarthWear’s purchasing process (see Figure 11–1). The 
following sections also discuss control activities and tests of controls that are relevant for 
EarthWear’s purchasing process.

T A B L E  1 1 – 5
Occurrence of Purchase Transactions
The auditor’s concern in testing the occurrence of purchase transactions is that fictitious or 
nonexistent purchases may have been recorded in the entity’s records. If fraudulent transac­
tions are recorded, assets or expenses will be overstated. A liability will also be recorded and 
a resulting payment made, usually to the individual who initiated the fictitious purchase trans­
actions. Proper segregation of duties is the major control for preventing fictitious purchases. 
The critical segregation of duties is the separation of the requisitioning and purchasing func­
tions from the accounts payable and disbursement functions.
The risk of purchase transactions being recorded without the goods or services being 
received can also be reduced if purchase transactions are not recorded without an approved 
purchase order and a receiving report. The presence of an approved purchase order ensures 
that the purchase was authorized, and the presence of a receiving report indicates that the 
goods were received. In an IT environment, such as EarthWear’s, the auditor can test the 
application controls to ensure that purchases are recorded only after an approved purchase 
order has been entered and the goods received. Accounting for the numerical sequence of 
receiving reports and vouchers can be accomplished either manually or by the computer. 
This control prevents the recording of fictitious purchase transactions through the use of 
receiving documents or vouchers that are numbered outside the sequence of properly autho­
rized documents. You should keep in mind that there are some types of transactions that 
are processed through the purchasing process that will not be accompanied by a purchase 
requisition and receiving report. For example, services for utilities and advertising would 
not use a receiving report.
Completeness of Purchase Transactions
If the entity fails to record a purchase that has been made, assets or expenses will be under­
stated, and the corresponding accounts payable will also be understated. Controls that ensure 
that the completeness assertion is being met include accounting for the numerical sequences 
of purchase orders, receiving reports, and vouchers and matching receiving reports with ven­
dor invoices.
Tests of controls for these control activities are listed in Table 11–6. For example, 
the auditor can trace a sample of receiving reports to their corresponding vendor invoices 
and vouchers. The vouchers can then be traced to the voucher register to ensure that each 
voucher was recorded. Again, these tests can be performed either manually or with CAATs. 
If each receiving report is matched to a vendor invoice and voucher, and the voucher was 
included in the voucher register, the auditor has a high level of assurance as to the com­
pleteness assertion.
The auditor’s concern with the completeness assertion also arises when the accounts pay­
able and accrued expenses accounts are audited at year-end. If the entity has strong controls 
for the completeness assertion, the auditor can reduce the scope of the search for unrecorded 
liabilities at year-end. This issue is discussed in more detail later in this chapter.

T A B L E  1 1 – 6
Authorization of Purchase Transactions
Possible misstatements due to improper authorization include the purchase of unauthor­
ized goods and services and the purchase of goods or services at unauthorized prices or 
terms. The primary control to prevent these misstatements is the use of an authoriza­
tion schedule or table that stipulates the amount that different levels of employees are 
authorized to purchase. Tests of controls include examination of purchase requisitions 
and purchase orders for proper approval consistent with the authorization table. If the 

	
Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
401
entity uses a sophisticated production system that reorders goods automatically, the audi­
tor should examine and test the programmed controls. Competitive bidding procedures 
should be followed to ensure that goods and services are acquired at competitive prices 
and on ­competitive terms.
Accuracy of Purchase Transactions
A possible misstatement for the accuracy assertion is that purchase transactions may be 
recorded at incorrect amounts due to improper pricing or erroneous calculations. The pur­
chase order should contain the expected price for the goods or services being purchased, 
based on price quotes obtained by the purchasing agents or prices contained in catalogs or 
published price lists. If the goods or services are purchased under a contract, the price should 
be stipulated in the contract. For example, an accounts payable clerk should compare the 
purchase order with the receiving report and vendor invoice (see Figure 11–1) and investigate 
significant differences in quantities, prices, and freight charges. The accounts payable clerk 
also checks the mathematical accuracy of the vendor invoice. The auditor’s test of controls 
for this assertion involves reperforming the accounts payable clerk’s duties on a sample of 
voucher packets.
The accuracy assertion is also concerned with proper posting of information to the pur­
chases journal, accounts payable subsidiary records, and general ledger. Control totals should 
be used to reconcile vouchers to the daily accounts payable listing, or else the daily postings 
to the purchases journal should be reconciled to the accounts payable subsidiary records. In 
addition, the voucher register or accounts payable subsidiary ledger should be reconciled to 
the general ledger control account. If these control activities are performed manually, the 
auditor can review and examine the reconciliations prepared by the entity’s personnel. In an 
IT application, such controls would be programmed and reconciled by the control groups in 
the IT and accounts payable departments. The auditor can examine the programmed controls 
and review the reconciliations.
Cutoff of Purchase Transactions
The entity should have controls to ensure that purchase transactions are recorded promptly 
and in the proper period. For example, the entity’s procedures should require that all receiv­
ing reports be forwarded to the accounts payable department daily. There should also be 
a requirement in the accounts payable department that receiving reports be matched on a 
timely basis with the original purchase order and the related vendor invoice. In EarthWear’s 
system, the receiving department forwards the receiving report to the accounts payable 
department daily. Within the accounts payable department, the vendor invoices are matched 
immediately with the original purchase orders and the receiving reports. The auditor can 
test these control activities by comparing the date on the receiving report with the date 
on the voucher. There should seldom be a long period between the two dates. The auditor 
also wants to ensure that the vouchers are recorded in the accounting records in the correct 
period. This can be tested by comparing the dates on vouchers with the dates the vouchers 
were recorded in the voucher register.
Classification of Purchase Transactions
Proper classification of purchase transactions is an important assertion for the purchasing 
process. If purchase transactions are not properly classified, asset and expense accounts 
will be misstated. Two main controls are used for ensuring that purchase transactions are 
properly classified. First, the entity should use a chart of accounts. Second, there should be 
independent approval and review of the general ledger accounts charged for the acquisition. 
A typical procedure is for the department or function that orders the goods or services to 
indicate which general ledger account to charge. Accounts payable department personnel 
then review the account distribution for reasonableness (see Figure 11–1). A test of controls 
for this assertion involves examining a sample of voucher packets for proper classification.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Control Activities and Tests of Controls—Cash  
Disbursement Transactions
Table 11–7 summarizes the assertions for cash disbursement transactions along with some 
examples of possible misstatements. For each of these misstatements we have included one 
or two possible control activities that management could implement to mitigate the risk as 
well as some example tests of controls that the auditor could use to test those controls. This 
table is not an exhaustive list of misstatements, control activities, or tests of controls for cash 
disbursement transactions; rather, it provides some specific examples by assertion to help you 
understand the underlying concepts.
Occurrence of Cash Disbursement Transactions
For the occurrence assertion, the auditor is concerned with a misstatement caused by a cash 
disbursement being recorded in the entity’s records when no payment has actually been made. 
A number of possibilities exist for the cause of this misstatement. For example, a check may 
be lost or stolen before it is mailed. The primary control activities used to prevent such mis­
statements include proper segregation of duties, independent reconciliation and review of 
vendor statements, and monthly bank reconciliations. In the purchasing system shown in 
­Figure 11–1, checks are distributed by the cashier’s department, which is independent of the 
accounts payable department (the department authorizing the payment).
Table 11–7 lists tests of controls that the auditor can use to verify the effectiveness of the 
entity’s controls. For example, the auditor can observe and evaluate the entity’s segregation 
of duties and review the entity’s procedures for reconciling vendor statements and monthly 
bank statements.
Completeness of Cash Disbursement Transactions
The major misstatement related to the completeness assertion is that a cash disbursement is 
made but not recorded in the entity’s records. In addition to the control activities used for 
the occurrence assertion, accounting for the numerical sequence of checks and reconcilia­
tion of the daily cash disbursements with postings to the accounts payable subsidiary records 
(see Figure 11–1) helps ensure that all cash disbursements are recorded. The auditor’s tests 
of controls may include reviewing and testing the entity’s procedures for accounting for the 
sequence of cash disbursements and reviewing the entity’s reconciliation procedures.
Authorization of Cash Disbursement Transactions
Proper segregation of duties reduces the likelihood that unauthorized cash disbursements are 
made. It is important that an individual who approves a purchase not have direct access to the 
cash disbursement for it. Additionally, the individuals in the accounts payable department 
who initiate payment should not have access to the checks after they are prepared. In Earth­
Wear’s purchasing process, the purchasing department functions are segregated from those of 
the accounts payable and cashier’s departments. Checks are forwarded directly from the IT 
department to the cashier’s department for mailing to the vendors.
The other major control over unauthorized cash disbursements is that checks or EFTs 
are not prepared unless all source documents (purchase requisition, purchase order, receiving 
report, and vendor’s invoice) are included in the voucher packet and approved. For Earth­
Wear’s purchasing process, a complete voucher packet must be present in order to record the 
liability and authorize payment.
Accuracy of Cash Disbursement Transactions
The potential misstatement related to the accuracy assertion is that the payment amount is 
recorded incorrectly. To detect such errors, the entity’s personnel should reconcile the total 
LO 11-9

	
Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
403
of the checks and EFTs issued on a particular day with the daily cash disbursements report. 
The entity’s control activities should require monthly reconciliation of vendor statements to the 
accounts payable records. Each of these reconciliations should be independently reviewed by the 
entity’s personnel. The auditor’s test of controls involves reviewing the various reconciliations.
Another possible misstatement is that cash disbursements are not properly posted to 
the cash disbursement journal, accounts payable subsidiary records, or general ledger. The 
reconciliation of vendors’ monthly statements is an effective control procedure for detecting 
payments posted to the wrong vendor accounts. Agreement of the monthly cash disburse­
ments journal to general ledger postings and reconciliation of the accounts payable subsidiary 
records to the general ledger control account are effective control activities for preventing 
summarization and posting errors (see Figure 11–1). The auditor’s tests of controls would 
include checking postings to the general ledger and reviewing the various reconciliations.
Cutoff of Cash Disbursement Transactions
The entity should establish procedures to ensure that when a cash disbursement is prepared, 
it is recorded on a timely basis in the cash disbursements journal and the accounts payable

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
subsidiary records. As shown in Figure 11–1, when a cash disbursement is prepared, it is 
simultaneously recorded in the accounting records by the application programs that control 
transaction processing. The auditor’s tests of controls include reviewing the reconciliation 
of cash disbursements with postings to the cash disbursements journal and accounts payable 
subsidiary records. The auditor also tests cash disbursements before and after year-end to 
ensure transactions are recorded in the proper period.
Classification of Cash Disbursement Transactions
The auditor’s concern with proper classification is that a cash disbursement may be charged to 
the wrong general ledger account. In most purchasing systems, purchases are usually recorded 
through the voucher register or purchases journal. Thus, the only entries into the cash dis­
bursements journal are debits to accounts payable and credits to cash. If these procedures are 
followed, proper classification of cash disbursements is not a major concern.
Sometimes an entity pays for goods and services directly from the cash disbursements 
journal without recording the purchase transaction in the purchases journal. If an entity pays 
for goods and services directly from the cash disbursements journal, controls must be present 
to ensure proper classification. The use of a chart of accounts, as well as independent approval 
and review of the account code on the voucher packet, should provide an adequate control. 
The auditor can review the cash disbursements journal for reasonableness of account distribu­
tion as well as the account codes on a sample of voucher packets.
Control Activities and Tests of Controls—Purchase  
Return Transactions
The number and magnitude of purchase return transactions are not material for most entities. 
However, because of the possibility of manipulation the auditor should, at a minimum, inquire 
about how the entity controls purchase return transactions. When goods are returned to a ven­
dor, the entity usually prepares a document (sometimes called a debit memo) that reduces the 
amount of the vendor’s accounts payable. This document is processed through the purchasing 
process in a manner similar to the processing of a vendor invoice.
Because purchase returns are often few in number and not material, the auditor normally 
does not test controls of these transactions. Substantive analytical procedures are usually per­
formed to test the reasonableness of purchase returns. For example, comparison of purchase 
returns as a percentage of revenue to prior years’ and industry data may disclose any material 
misstatement in this account.
Relating the Assessed Level of Control  
Risk to Substantive Procedures
The decision process followed by the auditor is similar to that discussed in Chapter 10 for the 
revenue process. If the results of the tests of controls support the planned level of control risk, 
the auditor conducts substantive procedures at the planned level. However, if the results of the 
tests of controls do not support the planned level of control risk, detection risk has to be set 
lower and substantive procedures increased.
The main accounts affected by the auditor’s achieved control risk for the purchasing pro­
cess include accounts payable, accrued expenses, and most of the expense accounts in the 
income statement. Additionally, the tests of controls over purchase transactions affect the 
assessment of detection risk for other business processes. For example, purchase transactions 
for the acquisition of inventory and property, plant, and equipment are subject to the controls 
included in the purchasing process. If those controls are reliable, the auditor may be able to 
increase the detection risk for the affected financial statement accounts and therefore reduce 
the number of substantive procedures needed.

Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
405
Auditing Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
The assessment of the risk of material misstatement (inherent risk and control risk) for 
the purchasing process is used to determine the level of detection risk for conducting sub­
stantive procedures for accounts payable and accrued expenses. Accounts payable gener­
ally represent normal recurring trade obligations. Accrued expenses represent expenses 
that have been incurred during the period but that have not been billed or paid for as of the 
end of the period. These include accruals for taxes, interest, royalties, and professional 
fees. A number of accrued expenses are also related to payroll. Because there is ­little 
­difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses, they are covered together in 
this section.
Substantive analytical procedures and tests of details of account balances and disclosures 
are used to test accounts payable and accrued expenses. Substantive analytical procedures are 
used to examine plausible relationships among accounts payable and accrued expenses. In the 
purchasing process, substantive tests of transactions focus mainly on the purchases and cash 
disbursement transactions. Tests of details of account balances concentrate on the detailed 
amounts or estimates that make up the ending balance for accounts payable and accrued 
expenses. Tests of details of disclosures are concerned with the presentation and disclosures 
related to accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Table 11–8 lists the assertions for account balances and disclosures as they apply to 
accounts payable and accrued expenses. You should note that the auditor may test assertions 
related to transactions (substantive tests of transactions) in conjunction with testing internal 
controls. If the tests of controls indicate that the controls are not operating effectively, the 
auditor may need to test transactions at the date the account balance is tested.
Substantive Analytical Procedures
Substantive analytical procedures can be useful substantive procedures for examin­
ing the reasonableness of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Substantive analyti­
cal procedures can effectively identify accounts payable and accrual accounts that are 
misstated, as well as provide evidence regarding the fairness of the recorded accounts. 
Table 11–9 contains some examples of substantive analytical procedures that can be used 
in the auditing of accounts payable and accrued expenses. Table 11–9 is not an exhaus­
tive list; rather, it ­provides some specific examples by account to help you understand the 
underlying concepts.

Management Assertions about Account Balances, and Disclosures 
for Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses
Assertions about account balances at the period end:
 • Existence. Accounts payable and accrued expenses are valid liabilities.
 • Rights and obligations. Accounts payable and accrued expenses are the obligations of the entity.
 • Completeness. All accounts payable and accrued expenses have been recorded.

payable and accrued expenses have occurred and pertain to the entity.
 • Completeness. All disclosures relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses that should have been included 
in the financial statements have been included.
 • Classification and understandability. Financial information relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses is 
appropriately presented and described, and disclosures are clearly expressed.
 • Accuracy and valuation. Financial and other information relating to accounts payable and accrued expenses are

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Stop and Think: Calculate the payables turnover (cost of goods sold ÷ accounts pay­
able) and days outstanding in accounts payable (365 days ÷ payables turnover) using 
EarthWear’s financial statements as presented earlier in the book. Do your findings 
provide evidence in support of the fair statement of accounts payable or suggest that 
additional audit work is necessary? 
For 2015, payables turnover is 8.74 times and days outstanding in accounts payable are 
41.8 days. For 2014, comparable ratios are 9.76 and 37.4 days. Both ratios indicate EarthWear 
is reducing payables at a slower rate over time. The auditor should determine the cause of the 
change in the ratios (e.g., entity may be slowing down payments because of decline in profits 
and cash flow from operations) and compare these ratios to industry data.
Tests of Details of Classes of Transactions, Account  
Balances, and Disclosures
Table 11–10 presents examples of tests of details of transactions, account balances, and dis­
closures for assertions related to accounts payable and accrued expenses. This table should 
not be construed as an exhaustive list of substantive audit procedures for accounts payable 
and accrued expenses. As discussed previously, substantive tests of transactions are tests 
conducted to detect monetary misstatements in the individual transactions processed through 
all accounting applications, are often conducted at the same time as tests of controls, and 
are often difficult to distinguish from a test of controls because the specific audit proce­
dure may both test the operation of a control procedure and test for monetary misstatement. 
Table 11–10 presents a substantive test of transactions for each assertion for purchase trans­
actions. Normally, most of these tests are conducted as tests of controls. However, if the con­
trols are not operating effectively or if the auditor did not rely on those controls, substantive 
tests of transactions may be necessary for the auditor to reach an appropriate level of evi­
dence. The cutoff assertion is the one that is most often conducted as a substantive procedure.
The discussion that follows focuses on tests of details of account balances of accounts 
payable and accrued expenses. We begin with the completeness assertion for the accounts 
payable balance because the auditor must establish that the detailed records agree to the gen­
eral ledger. Note that we do not cover all the assertions listed in Table 11–10 because they are 
not applicable to EarthWear Clothiers or they would have been conducted as tests of controls.
Completeness
The completeness of accounts payable is first determined by obtaining a listing of accounts 
payable, footing the listing, and agreeing it to the general ledger control account. The items 
included on this listing are the unpaid individual vouchers (when a voucher system is used)

or the balance in the individual vendor accounts in the subsidiary records (when a purchases 
journal is used). Exhibit 11–2 presents an example of the accounts payable listing for Earth­
Wear in which the information is summarized by vendor from the accounts payable subsidiary 
ledger. Selected vouchers or vendor accounts are traced to the supporting documents or sub­
sidiary accounts payable records to verify the accuracy of the details making up the listing. 
For example, the tick mark next to the balance for Aarhus Industries indicates that the auditor 
has verified the account by tracing the balance to the accounts payable subsidiary records.
For accrued expense accounts, the auditor obtains a detailed account analysis schedule. 
For example, Exhibit 11–3 shows an account analysis schedule for accrued real estate taxes. 
The credits to the accrual account represent the recognition of real estate taxes owed at the 
end of each month. This amount should agree to the amount of real estate taxes expense 
shown in the income statement. The debits to the account are payments. This schedule is 
footed and agreed to the accrued real estate taxes account in the general ledger.

Analysis of Accrued Real Estate Taxes 
12/31/15
The second major test of the completeness assertion for accounts payable and accruals is 
concerned with unrecorded liabilities. Auditors frequently conduct extensive tests to ensure 
that all liabilities are recorded. Such tests are commonly referred to as a search for unrecorded 
liabilities. The following audit procedures may be used as part of the search for unrecorded 
liabilities:
	
1.	 Ask management about control activities used to identify unrecorded liabilities and 
accruals at the end of an accounting period. These controls should be part of the 
closing process.
	
2.	 Vouch large-dollar items from the purchases journal and cash disbursements journal 
for a limited time after year-end; examine the date on each receiving report or vendor 
invoice to determine if the liability relates to the current audit period.
	
3.	 Examine the files of unmatched purchase orders, receiving reports, and vendor 
invoices for any unrecorded liabilities.

	
Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
409
Other audit procedures the auditor might perform for testing completeness include con­
firming vendor accounts including accounts with small or zero balances and reconciling cop­
ies of vendors’ monthly statements to the entity’s accounts payable records.
Existence
The auditor’s major concern with the existence assertion is whether the recorded liabilities 
are valid obligations of the entity. To verify the validity of liabilities, the auditor can vouch a 
sample of the items included on the listing of accounts payable, or the accrued account analy­
sis, to voucher packets or other supporting documents. If adequate source documents are pres­
ent, the auditor has evidence that the amounts represent valid liabilities (see Exhibit 11–2). 
In some circumstances, the auditor may obtain copies of the monthly vendor statements or 
send confirmation requests to vendors to test the validity of the liabilities. Confirmation of 
accounts payable is discussed later in this chapter.
Cutoff
The cutoff assertion attempts to determine whether all purchase transactions and related 
accounts payable are recorded in the proper period. While the auditor can obtain assurance 
about the cutoff assertion for purchases by conducting tests of controls, in most cases cutoff 
tests are conducted as substantive tests of transactions or as a dual-purpose test. On most 
audits, purchase cutoff is coordinated with the entity’s physical inventory count. Proper cutoff 
should also be determined for purchase return transactions.
The entity should have control activities to ensure that a proper purchase cutoff takes 
place. The auditor can test purchase cutoff by first obtaining the number of the last receiving 
report issued in the current period. A sample of voucher packets is selected for a few days 
before and after year-end. The receiving reports contained in the voucher packets are exam­
ined to determine if the receipt of the goods is consistent with the recording of the liability. 
For example, suppose that the last receiving report issued by EarthWear in 2015 was number 
15,755. A voucher packet recorded in the voucher register or accounts payable in 2015 should 
have a receiving report numbered 15,755 or less. If the auditor finds a voucher packet recorded 
in 2015 with a receiving report number higher than 15,755, the liability has been recorded in 
the wrong period. Accounts payable for 2015 should be adjusted and the amount included as a 
liability in the next period. For voucher packets recorded in 2016, the receiving reports should 
be numbered 15,756 or higher. If the auditor finds a voucher packet with a receiving report 
with a number less than 15,756, the liability belongs in the 2015 accounts payable.
Purchase returns seldom represent a material amount in the financial statements. If the 
entity has adequate control activities for processing purchase return transactions, the auditor 
can use substantive analytical procedures to satisfy the cutoff assertion for purchase returns. 
For example, the prior-year and current-year amounts for purchase returns as a percentage of 
revenue or cost of sales can be compared. If the results of the substantive analytical proce­
dures are consistent with the auditor’s expectation, no further audit work may be necessary.
Rights and Obligations
Generally, there is little risk related to this assertion because entities seldom have an incentive 
to record liabilities that are not obligations of the entity. Review of the voucher packets for 
adequate supporting documents relating liabilities to the entity provides sufficient evidence to 
support this assertion.
Valuation
The valuation of individual accounts payable is generally not a difficult assertion to test. 
Accounts payable are recorded at either the gross amount of the invoice or the net of the 
cash discount if the entity normally takes a cash discount. The tests of details of account bal­
ances noted in Table 11–10 normally provide sufficient evidence as to the proper valuation of 
accounts payable.

410	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The valuation of accruals depends on the type and nature of the accrued expenses. Most 
accruals are relatively easy to value, and proper valuation can be tested by examining the 
underlying source documents. Real estate taxes and interest are examples of accruals that 
are generally easy to value. In the first case, real estate appraisals or bills usually serve as the 
basis for the accrual amount (see Exhibit 11–3). In the second case, the amount of interest 
accrued relates directly to the amount of debt and the interest rate stipulated in the loan agree­
ment. Other accruals, however, may require the auditor to verify the entity’s estimates. Audit­
ing standards provide the auditor with guidance in auditing an entity’s estimates. Examples 
of such estimates include accruals for vacation pay, pension expense, warranty expense, and 
income taxes. The Advanced Module in this chapter provides a discussion of auditing the 
income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts.
Classification and Understandability
The major issues related to the presentation and disclosure assertion about classification are 
(1) identifying and reclassifying any material debits contained in accounts payable, (2) seg­
regating short-term and long-term payables, and (3) ensuring that different types of payables 
are properly classified. Proper classification can usually be verified by reviewing the accounts 
payable listing and the general ledger accounts payable account. If material debits are present, 
they should be reclassified as receivables or as deposits if the amount will be used for future 
purchases. Any long-term payables should be identified and reclassified to the long-term lia­
bility section of the balance sheet. Also, if payables to officers, employees, or related parties 
are material, they should not be included with the trade accounts payable. The auditor should 
also ensure that accrued expenses are properly classified.
Other Presentation Disclosure Assertions
Even though management is responsible for the financial statements, the auditor must ensure 
that all necessary financial statement disclosures are made for accounts payable and accrued 
expenses. Again, a reporting checklist is a useful tool. Table 11–11 presents examples of 
items that should be disclosed for accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Two disclosures are particularly important. The auditor must ensure that all related-party 
purchase transactions have been identified. If material, such related-party purchase transac­
tions should be disclosed. The other major disclosure issue is purchase commitments. When 
the entity has entered into a formal long-term purchase contract, adequate disclosure of the 
terms of the contract should be provided in a footnote. Exhibit 11–4 provides a sample disclo­
sure for a purchase commitment.
Examples of Disclosure Items for Purchasing Process and Related Accounts
Payables by type (trade, officers, employees, affiliates, and so on).
Short- and long-term payables.
Long-term purchase contracts, including any unusual or adverse purchase commitments.
Purchases from and payables to related parties.
Dependence on a single vendor or a small number of vendors.
Costs by reportable segment of the business.

The company has various agreements that provide for the purchase at market prices of wood chips, bark, and other 
residual fiber from trees.
The company also has an agreement to purchase at market prices through 2019 the entire production of an 
unbleached kraft paper–making machine at Johnson Forest Products Company. The capacity of this machine is 
estimated to be 30,000 tons a year.

Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process

Accounts Payable Confirmations
Chapter 10 discussed the confirmation process in general and accounts receivable confirmations 
specifically. This section expands that discussion to include confirmation of accounts payable. 
Accounts payable confirmations are used less frequently by auditors than accounts receivable con­
firmations because the auditor can test accounts payable by examining vendor invoices, monthly 
vendor statements, and payments made by the entity subsequent to year-end. Because vendor 
invoices and statements originate from sources external to the entity, this evidence is viewed as 
reliable. However, if the entity has weak internal control, vendor statements may not be available 
to examine. In such a case, confirmations may be used as an important source of evidence.
While accounts payable confirmations provide evidence on a number of assertions, the asser­
tion of primary interest with liabilities is the completeness assertion. If the entity has strong control 
activities for ensuring that liabilities are recorded and the auditor has tested those controls, the audi­
tor may be able to focus on confirmation of large-dollar accounts. However, because the possibility 
of unrecorded liabilities is usually considered an important concern, the auditor often also confirms 
balances with regular vendors that have small or zero balances because the entity may owe such 
vendors for purchases but the amounts may not be recorded in the entity’s accounting records.
When confirming accounts payable, auditors generally use a form of positive confirma­
tion referred to as a blank or zero-balance confirmation. This type of positive confirmation 
does not state the balance owed. Instead, the confirmation requests that the recipient fill in 
the amount or furnish other information. Exhibit 11–5 presents an example of an accounts

payable confirmation request. Note that the confirmation requests the balance owed and a 
detailed statement of the account. The confirmation also requests additional information on 
notes payable and consigned inventory.
If vendors do not respond to the accounts payable confirmation, the auditor should exam­
ine subsequent cash disbursements, or correspondence from third parties and other records, 
such as receiving reports and statements that the entity receives from vendors providing evi­
dence for the completeness assertion.
Generally, accounts payable confirmations are mailed at year-end rather than at an 
interim date because of the auditor’s concerns about unrecorded liabilities. The selection and 
mailing of accounts payable confirmations should be controlled using the procedures outlined 
in Chapter 10. When accounts payable confirmations are received, the amounts provided by 
the vendors must be reconciled with the entity’s records. Differences are often due to the same 
types of timing differences noted in Chapter 10 for accounts receivable confirmations. The 
two major timing differences are due to inventory in transit to the entity and cash paid by the 
entity but not yet received by the vendor. Any inconsistencies not due to timing differences 
normally result in adjustments to the entity’s records.
Evaluating the Audit Findings—Accounts Payable  
and Related
As discussed in previous chapters, when the auditor has completed the planned substantive 
procedures, all identified misstatements should be aggregated, including factual misstatement 
detected by the auditor and projected misstatements plus an allowance for sampling risk. The 
aggregate misstatement is then compared to tolerable misstatement. If the aggregate misstate­
ment is less than the tolerable misstatement, the auditor has evidence that the account is fairly 
presented. Conversely, if the aggregate misstatement exceeds the tolerable misstatement, the 
auditor should conclude that the account is not fairly presented.
For example, in Chapter 3, EarthWear’s tolerable misstatement was $900,000. Exhibit 3–3 
showed that Willis & Adams detected a misstatement in recording inventory that amounted 
to a $227,450 understatement of accounts payable. Because this misstatement of $227,450 
is less than the tolerable misstatement of $900,000, Willis & Adams can conclude that the 
audit evidence supports fair presentation. However, if the misstatement were greater than the 
tolerable misstatement, the evidence would not support fair presentation. If the misstatement 
were greater than the tolerable misstatement, the auditor would have two choices: adjust the 
accounts to reduce the misstatement to an amount less than the tolerable misstatement or 
qualify the audit report.
The auditor should again analyze the misstatements discovered through the application 
of substantive procedures because these misstatements may provide additional evidence as to 
the control risk. For example, if most misstatements identified indicate that accounts payable 
are not properly valued, the auditor may reassess the control activities used by the entity for 
ensuring proper valuation. If the auditor concludes that the audit risk is unacceptably high, 
additional audit procedures should be performed, or the auditor must be satisfied that the 
entity has adjusted the related financial statement accounts to an acceptable level. If the entity 
does not adjust the accounts, the auditor should qualify the audit report.
Advanced Module: Auditing the Tax Provision 
and Related Balance Sheet Accounts
The tax provision and related balance sheet accounts are usually material elements in the 
financial statements. The income tax provision (the amount that shows up on the income 
statement) is an estimate of the taxes that will ultimately be paid to the government on the 
current-year financial income reported in the financial statements. The income tax payable is 
LO 11-14
LO 11-15

	
Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
413
the estimate of the taxes that the entity will actually pay the government based on the taxable 
income reported in the current-year tax return less any estimated tax payment made during 
the year. Because there are significant differences between how revenue and expenses are 
treated for financial statements prepared according to GAAP and tax returns prepared accord­
ing to IRS guidelines, there are significant differences between the current year tax provision 
and the current year income tax liability on the tax return. These differences are categorized 
as either temporary or permanent.
Temporary differences are simply timing differences between the recognition of revenue or 
expense under GAAP and tax and are ultimately expected to reverse. For example, the tax code 
and GAAP often depreciate capital assets over different time periods. Permanent differences are 
fundamental differences in what constitutes revenue or expense for GAAP and tax purposes. 
For example, interest on municipal bonds is income for GAAP purposes, but the interest is non­
taxable income, so this represents a permanent difference between GAAP and tax accounting. 
Deferred taxes recorded on the balance sheet are the estimate of the tax to be paid or recovered 
in future periods as a result of reversals of existing temporary book/tax differences.
Another important area in the accounting for income taxes is the consideration of uncer­
tain tax positions that have been taken by the entity on its tax return. For example, an entity 
may choose to take a research and development credit on its tax return, but uncertainty exists 
as to whether the project costs qualify for the credit. FASB ASC Topic 740, “Income Taxes,” 
provides guidance on accounting for uncertain tax positions and requires that the entity 
determine the likelihood that an aggressive tax position would be sustained if specifically 
investigated by the Internal Revenue Service. If there is considerable doubt that the IRS will 
agree with the entity’s position, the entity is not allowed to recognize the related tax benefit 
(through lower income tax expense) in its financial statements. When it is determined that the 
benefit of an uncertain tax position should not be recognized, the entity records a liability in 
the financial statements for the amount of the uncertain tax benefit included in the tax return.
Properly accounting for the income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts is a 
complex area as evidenced by the large number of public companies reporting material weak­
nesses in internal control over financial reporting and financial statement restatements that 
occurred in the mid 2000s related to the accounting for income taxes.
Multinational corporations face additional complexities in accounting for income taxes 
such as varying tax rates in different countries, determination of where the taxes will be paid, 
and the recording of and control over intercompany transactions that affect transfer pricing 
and effective tax rates. In order to properly audit the tax provision and related balance sheet 
accounts, the auditor must be familiar with both the GAAP and tax accounting for revenue 
and expense items. Because of the technical complexities and ever-changing nature of the 
guidance in both accounting standards and the tax code, auditors are typically not capable of 
being expert in both areas simultaneously. In addition, auditors need to stay current in audit­
ing methodology, auditing standards, and changes in information technology. Nonetheless, 
the auditor is ultimately responsible for opining on the fairness of the financial statements, 
including the tax provision.
For smaller entities with straightforward tax provisions, the auditor often can obtain suf­
ficient appropriate evidence without the assistance of a tax specialist. However, for most large 
entities or for entities with complicated tax strategies, the auditor will seek the help of a tax 
specialist to gather sufficient appropriate audit evidence that the tax provision and related bal­
ance sheet accounts are fairly stated.
Examples of indicators suggesting the auditor should involve a tax specialist include
	
∙	 Multiple locations with significant foreign operations and related foreign tax credits/
deductions.
	
∙	 Business combinations and/or subsidiary dispositions.
	
∙	 Material uncertain income tax positions with a governmental authority.
	
∙	 Significant changes in ownership, business operations, or tax status.
	
∙	 Significant deferred tax assets for which the future realization of the recorded value is 
in question.

414	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The involvement of tax specialists in the audit should take into consideration the com­
plexity of the audit, the experience of both the audit and tax personnel, the size of the entity, 
the sensitivity of historical and current tax issues, and the level of recurring tax involvement 
with the entity. When the auditor determines that a tax specialist should be involved, the spe­
cialist will typically help gather evidence relating to the entity’s controls and processes in the 
tax accounting area as well as evidence to support the tax accounts reported in the financial 
statements. The tax provision process is normally a significant process because of its com­
plexity and importance to external financial reporting. The auditor and tax specialist need 
to understand the entity’s tax provision process in order to identify and test controls that are 
most relevant to financial statement risks.
While the auditor will not possess as much tax accounting expertise as the tax specialist, 
the auditor must have enough knowledge of tax accounting and the entity’s specific tax issues 
to adequately supervise the work performed by the tax specialist. See additional discussion of 
the use of specialists in Chapter 3.
Some of the typical procedures that might be applied to the audit of the tax provision by 
the auditors and/or tax specialist include
	
∙	 Compare the size and trend in the tax provision and related balance sheet accounts 
over time.
	
∙	 Perform walkthroughs and test the design and operating effectiveness of internal 
controls over the income tax provision (required for an integrated audit). Identify 
issues that should be given particular attention in substantive testing and evaluate the 
entity’s documentation.
	
∙	 Document the testing performed to evaluate the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal controls over the income tax process (primarily integrated audits).
	
∙	 Test the mathematical accuracy of the computations supporting the tax provision 
and related balance sheet accounts and vouch underlying data to supporting 
documentation.
	
∙	 Identify and test significant permanent and temporary differences in the tax provision 
calculation.
	
∙	 Review and evaluate management’s position on significant uncertain tax positions for 
appropriate disclosure and accounting under FASB ASC Topic 740.
	
∙	 Consider the realizability of net deferred tax assets and adequacy of related valuation 
allowances.
	
∙	 Test the reconciliation of income taxes payable, deferred income tax assets/liabilities 
(including any related valuation allowances), and tax liabilities to supporting 
documentation, including the general ledger, financial statements, and related 
footnote disclosure.
	
∙	 Ensure proper documentation in the audit working papers to allow for reperformance 
of the audit procedures applied to the tax accounts.

LO 11-2, 11-5, 	
11-26	 In 2015 Kida Company purchased more than $10 million worth of office equipment
	
11-6, 11-9	
 	 under its “special” ordering system, with individual orders ranging from $5,000 to 
$30,000. “Special” orders entail low-volume items that have been included in an 
authorized user’s budget. Department heads include in their annual budget requests 
for the types of equipment and their estimated cost. The budget, which limits the 
types and dollar amounts of office equipment a department head can requisition, is 
approved at the beginning of the year by the board of directors. Department heads 
prepare purchase requisition forms for equipment and forward them to the purchas­
ing department. Kida’s “special” ordering system functions as follows:
	
	
	 ∙	 Purchasing: Upon receiving a purchase requisition, one of five buyers verifies 
that the person requesting the equipment is a department head. The buyer selects 
the appropriate vendor by searching the various vendor catalogs on file. The 
buyer then phones the vendor, requests a price quotation, and gives the vendor a 
verbal order. A prenumbered purchase order is processed with the original sent to 

	
Chapter 11    Auditing the Purchasing Process	
419
the vendor, a copy to the department head, a copy to receiving, a copy to accounts 
payable, and a copy filed in the open requisition file. When the buyer is orally 
informed by the receiving department that the item has been received, the buyer 
transfers the purchase order from the unfilled file to the filled file. Once a month 
the buyer reviews the unfilled file to follow up on and expedite open orders.
	
	
	 ∙	 Receiving: The receiving department receives a copy of the purchase order. When 
equipment is received, the receiving clerk stamps the purchase order with the date 
received and, if applicable, in red pen prints any differences between the quan­
tity shown on the purchase order and the quantity received. The receiving clerk 
forwards the stamped purchase order and equipment to the requisitioning depart­
ment head and orally notifies the purchasing department.
	
	
	 ∙	 Accounts payable: Upon receiving a purchase order, the accounts payable clerk 
files it in the open purchase order file. When a vendor invoice is received, the 
invoice is matched with the applicable purchase order, and a payable is set up by 
debiting the equipment account of the department requesting the items. Unpaid 
invoices are filed by due date, and at the due date a check is prepared. The invoice 
and purchase order are filed by purchase order number in a paid invoice file, and 
the check is then forwarded to the treasurer for signature.
	
	
	 ∙	 Treasurer: Checks received daily from the accounts payable department are 
sorted into two groups: those over $10,000 and those $10,000 and less. Checks 
for $10,000 and less are machine-signed. The cashier keeps the key and signa­
ture plate to the check-signing machine and records all use of the check-signing 
machine. All checks over $10,000 are signed by the treasurer or the controller.
Required:
	
a.	 Prepare a flowchart of Kida Company’s purchasing and cash disbursements 
system.
	
b.	 Describe the internal control weaknesses relating to purchases of and payments 
for “special” orders of Kida Company for the purchasing, receiving, accounts 
payable, and treasurer functions.

DISCUSSION CASE
	
LO 11-12, 11-13	
11-31	 Mincin, CPA, is the auditor of the Raleigh Corporation. Mincin is considering 
the audit work to be performed in the accounts payable area for the current year’s 
engagement. The prior year’s working papers show that confirmation requests were 
mailed to 100 of Raleigh’s 1,000 suppliers. The selected suppliers were based on 
Mincin’s sample, which was designed to select accounts with large-dollar balances. 
A substantial number of hours was spent by Raleigh and Mincin in resolving rela­
tively minor differences between the confirmation replies and Raleigh’s accounting 
records. Alternative audit procedures were used for suppliers who did not respond to 
the confirmation requests.
Required:
	
a.	 Discuss the accounts payable assertions that Mincin must consider in determining 
the audit procedures to be followed.
	
b.	 Discuss situations in which Mincin should use accounts payable confirmations, 
and discuss whether Mincin is required to use them.
	
c.	 Discuss why the use of large-dollar balances as the basis for selecting accounts 
payable for confirmation might not be the most efficient approach, and indicate 
what more efficient procedures could select accounts payable for confirmation.

Auditing the Human Resource 
Management Process
C
ompensation and related employee benefit costs represent major 
expenses for most entities. As a result, organizations tend to have 
strong control activities for processing payroll transactions. Additionally, 
because of the routine nature of these transactions, an entity’s payroll is nor­
mally maintained on an IT system, or an outside service bureau is contracted 
to process the payroll.
This chapter starts with an overview of the human resource management 
process and then discusses the components of the audit risk model. Specifi­
cally, the inherent risks that affect the human resource management process 
are addressed followed by a discussion of the auditor’s control risk assess­
ment. While the main focus of this chapter is auditing the human resource 
management process for a financial statement audit, the concepts covered for 
setting control risk are applicable to an audit of internal control over finan­
cial reporting for public companies under Auditing Standard No. 5 (AS5). Last, 
the chapter covers substantive procedures for detection risk for payroll and 
related accounts. The Advanced Module contains a discussion of accounting 
for and auditing share-based compensation.

Overview of the Human Resource  
Management Process
The human resource process starts with the establishment of sound policies for hiring, training, 
evaluating, counseling, promoting, compensating, and taking remedial actions for employees. 
Once an individual has been hired as an employee, the main transaction that affects the financial 
statement accounts is a payroll (payment) transaction. A payroll transaction usually begins with an 
employee performing some job and recording the time spent on a time card or time sheet (often in 
electronic form). The time card or time sheet is approved by a supervisor before being forwarded 
to the payroll department. The data are then reviewed and sent to the IT department for processing. 
Finally, payment is made directly to the employee or deposited in the employee’s bank account.
Figure 12–1 presents a flowchart of EarthWear’s payroll system that serves as a frame­
work for discussing control activities and tests of controls. Although the description of Earth­
Wear’s payroll system is fairly typical, the reader should focus on the basic concepts so that 
they can be applied to the specific payroll systems encountered. The following topics related 
to the human resource management process are covered:
	
∙	 Types of transactions and financial statement accounts affected.
	
∙	 Types of documents and records.
	
∙	 The major functions.
	
∙	 The key segregation of duties.

Chapter 12    Auditing the Human Resource Management Process	
425
Types of Transactions and Financial Statement Accounts Affected
Two main types of transactions processed through the human resource management 
process are
	
∙	 Payments to employees for services rendered.
	
∙	 Accrual and payment of payroll-related liabilities arising from employees’ services, 
including liabilities for Social Security and unemployment taxes.
The discussion of internal control focuses on payments to employees, including a descrip­
tion of how such transactions are processed and the key control activities that should be pres­
ent to ensure that no material misstatements occur. The audit of payroll-related accruals is 
discussed later in the chapter.
The financial statement accounts that are generally affected by the two types of payroll-
related transactions are provided in the table below:

Types of Documents and Records
Table 12–1 lists the important documents and records that are normally involved in the pay­
roll application. Each of these items is briefly discussed here. The use of IT systems may 
affect the form of the documents and the auditor’s approach to testing the payroll application.
Personnel Records, Including Wage-Rate or Salary Authorizations  Personnel 
records contain information on each employee’s work history, including hiring date, salary or 
wage rate, payroll deduction authorization forms, salary and wage-rate adjustment authoriza­
tions, performance evaluations, and termination notice, if applicable. Personnel records are 
normally maintained in the human resource department.
W-4 and Other Deduction Authorization Forms  The employee must authorize deduc­
tions from his or her pay. The organization should therefore use authorization forms to docu­
ment such deductions. For example, the employee must complete a W-4 form to authorize the 
withholding of federal and state income tax. Similar forms should be used for deductions for 
medical insurance, retirement contributions, and other benefits.
Time Card/Time Sheet  Such documents record the hours worked by the employee, includ­
ing the time the employee has started and stopped work. In some cases the employee fills in 
the time worked (typically in an electronic database); in other cases, the employee swipes

an employee identification card, or enters an employee identification number into an elec­
tronic keypad when he or she arrives and leaves work, and the time-tracking system records 
and accumulates the hours worked.
Payroll Check/Direct Deposit Records  These records indicate the amount paid to the 
employee for services rendered. The amount paid is the gross pay less any deductions. In 
many cases, the employee’s pay is directly deposited into the individual’s bank account, and 
the company produces a listing of employees’ payments that were sent to their bank accounts.
Payroll Register  This document, which is also referred to as the payroll journal, summa­
rizes all payroll payments issued to employees. A payroll register normally indicates employ­
ees’ gross pay, deductions, and net pay. In an IT environment, the details for this document are 
maintained in the payroll master file.
Payroll Master File  This computer file maintains all the entity’s records related to payroll, 
including information on each employee such as name, Social Security number, pay rate, and 
authorized deductions.
Payroll Master File Changes Report  This report contains a record of the changes made 
to the payroll master file. The human resource department reviews this report to ensure that 
all authorized changes have been properly made.
Periodic Payroll Reports  At the end of each week or month, a number of summary pay­
roll reports may be prepared. The type of reports prepared depends on the type of organiza­
tion. A manufacturing entity might have a payroll expense report that showed the allocation 
of direct labor to various products. EarthWear Clothiers reports a summary of payroll by vari­
ous job classifications and departments. Department heads use this report to monitor payroll 
expense variances.
Various Tax Reports and Forms  Most companies are required to prepare various payroll 
tax reports for both the federal and state governments. Unemployment compensation forms 
must also be completed periodically. Additionally, an entity must provide each employee with 
a W-2 form at the end of the year. Compensation paid to a consultant or an independent con­
tractor must be reported on an IRS 1099 form.
The Major Functions
The principal objectives of the human resource management process are to (1) record pro­
duction and other types of payroll costs in the accounts; (2) ensure that payroll costs are for 
legitimate entity activities; and (3) accrue liabilities for salaries and wages, payroll taxes, and 
various employee benefit programs. Table 12–2 lists the functions that are normally part of 
the payroll application.
Human Resources  The human resources function is responsible for managing the per­
sonnel needs of the organization. This includes hiring and terminating employees, setting 
wage rates and salaries, and establishing and monitoring employee benefit programs. Most 
large organizations centralize these activities in a human resource department. However, in 
a small organization, these activities may be combined with the duties of selected operating 
and administrative personnel. In such organizations, control over human resource activities 
may not be as strong as when such activities are centralized. The human resource depart­
ment maintains employees’ personnel records. The human resource department may also be 
responsible for defining job requirements and descriptions, administering union contracts, 
and developing performance criteria and employee evaluation procedures.

Supervision  Supervisors within operating and supporting departments are responsible for 
reviewing and approving employees’ attendance and time information. When time sheets or 
other documents are used to record an employee’s time worked and job classification, the 
supervisor approves this information before processing by the payroll function. Additionally, 
supervisors should monitor labor productivity and labor cost variances. Standardized labor 
performance measures, such as standard productivity and wage rates, improve the monitoring 
of payroll costs. Labor cost variances should be investigated by supervisory personnel and 
communicated to upper-level management. When employees are not required to complete 
time cards/sheets or job classification documents, the entity needs to have control activities to 
notify the timekeeping or payroll-processing function about employees’ absences and changes 
in employees’ job classifications. This might be accomplished by having the supervisor sub­
mit a periodic attendance and job classification report.
Timekeeping  The timekeeping function prepares employees’ time information for payroll 
processing. When payroll cost distribution is determined at the operating department level, 
the timekeeping function reviews this information before processing. Otherwise, the time­
keeping function should be responsible for coding the payroll costs to appropriate accounts. 
In some organizations, a separate timekeeping department handles these functions. At Earth­
Wear (see Figure 12–1), the operating and supporting departments are responsible for the 
timekeeping function.
Payroll Processing  The payroll-processing function is responsible for computing gross 
pay, deductions, and net pay. This function is also responsible for recording and summarizing 
payments and verifying account distribution. When IT is used to process payroll, as at Earth­
Wear, the entity must have strong application controls to ensure proper payroll processing.
Some entities outsource their payroll processing to a third-party provider such as ADP™. 
These third-party providers can provide a range of services from basic payroll processing to 
full human resources services from employee hire to retirement. When an entity uses a third 
party to process payroll, the auditor will obtain evidence for important assertions associated 
with the data transferred to the service provider. The auditor must also consider the third-
party services as part of the entity’s information system. Because the third-party provider 
provides services to many entities, the third-party provider will obtain a Type 1 or Type 2 
Service Organization Controls 1 (or SOC1) attestation report on the controls at the service 
organization that the other entity’s auditors can rely on.1 See Chapter 6 for a discussion of 
SOC1 reports and auditing accounting applications processed by service organizations.
Disbursement  The disbursement function is responsible for paying employees for ser­
vices and benefits. In particular, this function oversees the preparation and distribution of 
payroll checks. Check preparation normally occurs in the IT department. Therefore, it is 
1Type 1 and Type 2 SOC1 reports on controls at a service organization used to be known as “SAS 70 Reports.” Such 
reports are now issued under the standards for attestation engagements, AT 801, Reporting on Controls at a Service 
Organization. See Chapter 21 for a discussion of the attestation standards.

necessary to have control activities over access to blank checks and check signature plates. 
Checks are normally distributed by a paymaster, who is typically a member of the treasurer’s 
department. When payments are directly deposited into employees’ bank accounts, strong 
IT application controls are necessary. If payroll disbursements are handled by a third-party 
service provider, assurance over IT controls is provided in the Type 1 or Type 2 attestation 
report (see Chapter 6).
General Ledger  The general ledger function for the human resource management process 
is responsible for properly accumulating, classifying, and summarizing payroll and benefit 
transactions in the general ledger. When IT is used to process payroll transactions, control 
totals can help ensure that this function is performed properly. This function is normally per­
formed by the general accounting department.
The Key Segregation of Duties
As discussed in prior chapters, proper segregation of duties is one of the most important 
control activities in any accounting system. Duties should be assigned to individuals in such a 
way that no one individual can control all phases of processing a transaction, thus permitting 
misstatements to go undetected.
Stop and Think: Please look back at EarthWear’s flowchart in Figure 12–1 in order to 
identify one or two duties that EarthWear segregates. What could happen if the duties 
you identified were not segregated?
Individuals responsible for supervision and timekeeping should be segregated from the 
personnel, payroll-processing, and general ledger functions. If IT is used extensively in the 
payroll application, duties should be properly segregated in the IT department. Table 12–3 
contains some of the key segregation of duties for the human resource management process 
and examples of possible errors or fraud that can result from conflicts in duties.
Table 12–4 shows more detailed segregation of duties for individual payroll functions 
across the various departments that are involved in processing payroll transactions.
Returning to EarthWear’s flowchart (Figure 12–1), we see EarthWear has separated, for 
example, the supervising function performed by each operating department from the person­
nel records and the payroll-processing functions, which are performed by the human resources 
and IT departments, respectively. For checks, EarthWear has also separated processing and 
preparation of the checks and distribution. However for direct deposit, IT both prepares and 
distributes the checks. Although not uncommon, the auditor would want to examine and test 
controls around the payroll preparation and direct deposit processes, particularly controls 
designed to ensure distributions are made only to valid employees.
LO 12-5
Key Segregation of Duties in the Human Resource Management Process 
and Possible Errors or Fraud
Segregation of Duties
Possible Errors or Fraud Resulting from Conflicts of Duties
The supervision function should be segregated from the 
personnel records and payroll-processing functions.
If one individual is responsible for the supervision, personnel records, and ­payroll-
processing functions, fictitious employees can appear on the payroll records or 
unauthorized payments can be made. This can result in unauthorized payments to 
existing employees or payments to fictitious employees.
The disbursement function should be segregated from the 
personnel records, supervision, and payroll-processing 
functions.
If one individual is responsible for the disbursement function and has the authority 
to hire and fire employees, approve time reports, or prepare payroll checks, 
unauthorized payroll checks can be issued.
The payroll-processing function should be segregated from 
the general ledger function.
If one individual is responsible for processing payroll transactions and for the general 
ledger, that individual can conceal any defalcation that would normally be detected 
by independent review of accounting entries made to the general ledger.

Inherent Risk Assessment
With the exception of executive and share-based compensation (see Exhibit 12–1 and the 
Advanced Module), few inherent risk factors directly affect the human resource management 
process and its related accounts for nonofficers. Some factors the auditor might consider are 
the effect of economic conditions on payroll costs and the supply of skilled workers. Earth­
Wear is a seasonal business and experiences relatively high turnover in its seasonal employees 
with a workforce that fluctuates between 3,500 and 5,300 employees.
Stop and Think: How might seasonal employee turnover impact the inherent risk 
assessment for payroll?
High turnover increases the inherent risk assessment due to the level of employee additions and 
terminations and the risk associated with processing. For example, there is a greater risk that pay 
will be inappropriately dispersed to terminated or fictitious employees. Additionally, the presence 
of labor contracts and legislation such as the Occupational Safety and Health Act may also affect 
the auditor’s assessment of inherent risk. Because the payroll system and its related accounts 
generally contain few inherent risks, the auditor is normally able to set the inherent risk as low.
The inherent risk associated with executive compensation is frequently not set at low 
because, as illustrated in Exhibit 12–1, officers may have motive and opportunity to take 
advantage of their high-ranking offices in the form of excessive compensation. Due to the 
complexity of accounting and disclosures associated with stock-based compensation (e.g., 
stock options, stock appreciation rights), combined with the degree of judgment and estima­
tion involved in option-valuation models, there can also be substantial inherent risk associ­
ated with stock-based or share-based compensation. The Advanced Module in this chapter 
discusses share-based compensation.

INSIGHT
It is not uncommon for executives of large public companies to be paid tens of millions of dollars 
each year which can be over 300 times the average worker’s salary. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 
included a provision requiring the SEC to rule that public companies disclose the level of CEO total 
compensation relative to a typical employee. The pay-ratio proposal led to heated debates. The SEC 
received over 287,000 comment letters on the proposal. In 2015, the SEC implemented a rule requir­
ing companies to disclose the median of the total annual compensation of all their employees except 
the CEO; the annual total compensation of the CEO; and the ratio of the two amounts. The rule takes 
effect in 2017. Two of the five SEC commissioners voted against the rule and in their dissenting opin­
ions they called the pay-ratio rule a political ploy to shame companies into lowering CEO pay.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Control Risk Assessment
The discussion of control risk assessment follows the framework outlined in previous chapters. 
However, the discussion is not as in depth as the discussion of the revenue or purchasing pro­
cesses because it is assumed that the reader has now developed a reasonable understanding of the 
decision process followed by the auditor when setting control risk. Figure 12–2 summarizes the 
three major steps involved in setting control risk for the human resource management process.
Understand and Document Internal Control
The level of understanding of the internal control components should be similar to that obtained 
for the other processes. The auditor’s understanding of the human resource management process 
is normally gained by conducting a walkthrough of the system to gather evidence about the vari­
ous functions that are involved in processing the transactions through the system. For an ongoing 
audit, this process merely involves updating prior years’ documentation of the payroll system 
by noting any changes that have occurred. For a new engagement, or if the system has under­
gone major changes, more time and effort are needed to document the understanding of internal 
control. The auditor’s understanding of internal control for the payroll system should be docu­
mented in the working papers using flowcharts, internal control questionnaires, and memoranda.
Because the control environment pervasively affects all accounting applications, includ­
ing the payroll system, two factors in particular should be considered. First, the entity’s 
LO 12-7
Executive Compensation Abuses at Tyco
Tyco International Ltd.’s Dennis Kozlowski looms large as a rogue CEO for the ages. His $6,000 shower 
curtain and vodka-spewing, full-size ice replica of Michelangelo’s David were symbols of excess and 
greed. In essence, prosecutors accused Kozlowski and former Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz of run­
ning a criminal enterprise within Tyco’s executive suite. The two were hit with 38 felony counts for pilfer­
ing $170 million directly from the company and for pocketing an additional $430 million through tainted 
sales of stock. Ironically, both Kozlowski and Swartz were former auditors; Kozlowski has become the 
personification of the widespread irrational exuberance of the late 1990s. Kozlowski handpicked some of 
the members of the compensation committee, and the changes worked to his benefit as his total compen­
sation rose from $8.8 million in 1995 to $67 million in 1998 to $170 million in 1999. The more he was paid 
as a reward for Tyco’s soaring stock price, the more he spent on luxuries—and the more he stole.
Kozlowski also ran up a $242 million tab at Tyco under a loan program designed to finance the pur­
chase of company stock. Rather than use the money to buy Tyco stock, he used it to purchase fine art and 
antiques, a yacht, and a Nantucket estate. The loans were forms of compensation, but characterizing the 
compensation as a loan provided significant tax and accounting benefits to the executive and the corpora­
tion. Tyco’s board approved some, but not all, of the forms of compensation Kozlowski had tapped into.
When Congress learned of the level of abuse in corporate loans, it was shocked. In the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002, Congress forbids public companies to make or even arrange new loans to executives 
or to modify or renew old ones. The penalties for a violation are up to 20 years in jail and fines reaching 
$5 million for executives and $25 million for companies.
In June 2005, Kozlowski and Swartz were each convicted on 22 criminal charges relating to their mis­
deeds at Tyco. Both were sentenced to serve up to 25 years in prison and pay fines and restitution totaling 
$240 million. Kozlowski served over 6 years in prison and 3 years in work release on parole. After serving 
his time Kozlowski said, “I was piggy, but I’m not that person anymore.”
As a result of abuses, public companies are now required to provide a “readable” explanation of how 
executive compensation was determined in the “Executive Compensation Discussion & Analysis” section 
in SEC filings. There are also tools online that pull executive compensation numbers from SEC filings in 
order for investors to make comparisons between companies.

organizational structure, its personnel practices, and its methods of assigning authority and 
responsibility must be examined. The proper organizational structure for processing payroll 
transactions was discussed in the previous section. Second, the entity should have sound 
policies for hiring, training, promoting, and compensating employees. These policies should 
include specific authority and responsibility for hiring and firing employees, for setting wage 
rates and making salary changes, and for establishing benefits.
Plan and Perform Tests of Controls
For audits of public companies subject to AS5 or when a reliance strategy is followed, the auditor 
must identify the control activities that ensure that material misstatements are either prevented 
or detected and corrected. For example, the entity may have formal procedures for classifying 
payroll costs in appropriate accounts. The auditor may decide to rely on this control activity to 
reduce the control risk for the classification assertion. In this case, the entity’s procedures for 
classifying payroll transactions by types of payroll costs should be examined by the auditor.
Set and Document the Control Risk
After the tests of controls are completed, the auditor sets the level of control risk and docu­
ments that assessment. The documentation supporting the achieved level of control risk for 
the payroll system might include a flowchart, the results of tests of controls, and a memoran­
dum indicating the overall conclusion about control risk. If control deficiencies are detected 
at a public company, the auditor would need to evaluate the likelihood and magnitude of the 
potential weakness (see Chapter 7).
Table 12–5 summarizes the assertions and possible misstatements for payroll transactions. 
The table also includes examples of control activities for each assertion and examples of tests 
of controls that can test the effectiveness of the control activities. The discussion that follows 
focuses only on the most important assertions for the payroll system. EarthWear’s payroll 
system contains all of the relevant control activities.

Chapter 12    Auditing the Human Resource Management Process	
433
Occurrence of Payroll Transactions
The auditor wants assurance that payments for payroll-related services are being made to 
valid employees for time actually worked. Thus, the entity needs control activities that prevent 
payments to fictitious employees and to valid employees who have not worked. Controls must 
also ensure that payroll payments stop once an employee is terminated.
Stop and Think: Using your developing auditor expertise, what controls would you 
expect to see at a company like EarthWear to ensure payments are not made to termi­
nated or fictitious employees?
Proper segregation of duties provides the main control against payments to fictitious 
employees. As noted in Table 12–4, proper segregation of duties among operating and sup­
porting departments, the human resource department, and the payroll department minimizes 
the possibility of fictitious employees existing within the system. The maintenance of ade­
quate personnel files should also prevent such misstatements. For example, a listing of termi­
nated employees could be used to verify that no terminated employees are still listed in the 
active payroll master file.
The human resource department approves the termination of an employee and ensures 
that he or she is removed from the master payroll file. Required completion and approval of 
a time card/time sheet also prevent payments to terminated employees. Proper review and 
approval of time cards/sheets by supervisors should prevent valid employees from being paid 
for work not performed.
Practice 
INSIGHT
When an external payroll service provider is used to process the audit entity’s payroll, the controls 
of the provider must be understood and tested by the audit firm, or by the service provider’s auditor 
in accordance with attestation standard AT 801 (see Chapter 21), before the controls of the payroll 
service provider can be relied on.
Finally, when payroll transactions are processed by an IT system, a payroll check should 
not be prepared unless the employee transaction has a valid employee number. Review and 
observation are the main tests of controls the auditor uses to examine the control activities 
shown in Table 12–5.
Authorization of Payroll Transactions
As in the discussion of the authorization assertion for other accounting applications, there 
are key authorization points within the payroll system. The entity should have authorization 
procedures for hiring and terminating employees, setting pay rates, making withholdings, 
awarding benefits, and issuing payroll checks. For example, the department supervisor should 
approve the amount of time reported by an employee on his or her time card/sheet. Similarly, 
hiring and termination of employees and changes in pay rates should be authorized by the 
human resource department consistent with union contracts or corporate policies. Last, a pay­
roll check should not be issued unless an employee’s time card/sheet has been approved and 
that employee has a valid employee number on the payroll master file.
Accuracy of Payroll Transactions
The main concern related to the accuracy assertion is that an employee’s gross pay and pay­
roll deductions may be incorrectly computed. For example, an employee may be paid at an 
improper rate or payroll deductions may be incorrectly computed. The entity should maintain 
verification procedures to ensure correct payroll and benefit calculations. The auditor can 
review the entity’s verification procedures as a test of control. When IT is used to prepare the 
payroll, the auditor can use computer-assisted audit techniques (CAATs) to test the program 
logic for proper calculations. In a manual system, or if a service bureau is used, the auditor 
can recompute the payroll calculations for a sample of payroll transactions.

434	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Classification of Payroll Transactions
Because classification is an important assertion for payroll transactions, control activities must 
ensure that the appropriate payroll accounts are charged. If payroll expense is charged to the 
wrong accounts, the financial statements may be misstated. For example, if payroll expense is not 
properly classified between direct and indirect labor, inventory and cost of goods sold may not be 
valued properly. The use of an adequate chart of accounts is one control activity that helps prevent 
misclassification. Additionally, the timekeeping function should review the payroll ­categories 
assigned by the operating departments. Budgets that compare actual payroll costs to budgeted 
payroll costs by each category of labor also provide a control over proper classification of payroll. 
The auditor can review and test the entity’s control activities for classifying payroll costs.
Relating the Assessed Level of Control Risk  
to Substantive Procedures
If the results of the tests of controls for the payroll system support the planned level of control 
risk, the auditor conducts substantive procedures of payroll-related accounts at the assessed 
level. EarthWear, for example, has a strong set of control procedures for processing payroll 
transactions. If the auditor’s tests of EarthWear’s controls indicate that the controls are operat­
ing effectively, then no adjustment of detection risk is necessary. However, if the results of the 
control tests do not support the planned level of control risk for EarthWear’s payroll system, 
the detection risk will have to be set lower. This would require that the nature and extent of 
substantive testing of payroll-related accounts be increased.
Auditing Payroll-Related Accounts
Two categories of substantive procedures for auditing payroll expense and payroll-related 
liabilities are discussed here: (1) substantive analytical procedures and (2) tests of details 
of account balances and disclosures. Table 12–6 presents the assertions for classes of trans­
actions and events, account balances, and disclosures as they apply to payroll expense and 
payroll-related liabilities, which are often called accrued payroll expenses. You should note 
that the auditor may obtain assurance for assertions related to transactions (substantive tests 
of transactions) in conjunction with testing the internal controls. If the tests of controls indi­
cate that the controls are not operating effectively, the auditor may need to test transactions at 
the date the account balance is tested.
Substantive Analytical Procedures
Substantive analytical procedures can be useful substantive tests for examining the reason­
ableness of payroll expenses and payroll-related accrual accounts. When utilized as part of 
planning, preliminary analytical procedures can effectively identify payroll expense accounts 
and accrual accounts that may be misstated.
Stop and Think: What comparisons and reasonableness tests could you develop to 
obtain assurance that payroll expense appears reasonable and that wages payable at the 
end of the year is accurately stated?
Table 12–7 shows examples of substantive analytical procedures that can be used for 
auditing payroll. Two examples will help demonstrate their application in practice. First, the 
auditor can compare budgeted payroll costs with actual payroll costs. Variances due to quan­
tity and wage differences should show up in the entity’s cost-accounting system (on weekly or 
monthly reports). If the variances are immaterial, the auditor has some evidence that payroll 
LO 12-9
LO 12-10

	
Chapter 12    Auditing the Human Resource Management Process	
435
costs are reasonable. If the variances are material, the auditor should investigate the poten­
tial causes of the differences. This substantive analytical procedure also helps the auditor 
determine the proper valuation of inventory when standard costs are used to value inventory. 
Second, the auditor can test the reasonableness of certain accrual balances. For example, if 
accrued wages represent payroll for two days, the auditor can multiply the total weekly payroll 
by 40 percent (2 days ÷ 5 days). If the auditor’s calculation is close to the accrued amount, no 
further audit work may be required on the accrued wages account.
Tests of Details of Classes of Transactions, Account 
­Balances, and Disclosures
Table 12–6 presents the assertions for payroll expense and payroll-related liabilities. The 
intended purpose of substantive tests of transactions is to detect monetary misstatements in the 
individual transactions processed through the payroll application. As previously mentioned, 
tests of transactions are often conducted in conjunction with tests of controls. Table 12–8

presents examples of substantive tests of transactions, account balances, and disclosures for 
assertions related to payroll. The discussion that follows focuses on tests of details of account 
balances of payroll expense and accrued payroll liabilities.
Payroll Expense Accounts
Payroll transactions affect many expense accounts, including direct and indirect manufactur­
ing expense, general and administrative salaries, sales salaries, commissions, and payroll tax 
expenses. Some companies account for such expenses by product line or division. In addition, 
fringe benefits such as medical and life insurance may be paid at least partly by the organization. If 
the entity’s internal control is reliable, the auditor generally does not need to conduct detailed tests 
of these payroll expense accounts. On such audits, sufficient evidence can be gathered through an 
understanding of internal control, tests of controls, substantive tests of transactions, and substan­
tive analytical procedures. Additional detail testing is necessary only when control weaknesses 
exist or when the other types of audit tests indicate that material misstatements may be present.
Several payroll expense accounts may still be examined even when control risk is low. 
For example, it is common to verify the compensation paid to officers of the company 
because information on executive salaries and bonuses is needed for the SEC Form 10-K, 
Examples of Payroll Tests of Transactions, Account Balances, 
and Disclosures
Assertions about Classes of Transactions
Example Substantive Tests of Transactions
Occurrence
Trace a sample of payroll checks to the master employee list to verify validity.*
Completeness
Tracing of a sample of time cards/sheets to the payroll register.*
Authorization
Test a sample of payroll checks for the presence of an authorized time card/sheet.*
Accuracy
Recompute the mathematical accuracy of a sample of payroll checks: CAATs may be 
used to test the logic of the computer programs for proper calculation of gross pay, 
deductions, and net pay.
Cutoff
Trace a sample of time cards/sheets before and after period end to the appropriate 
weekly payroll report, and trace the weekly payroll report to the general ledger to 
verify payroll transactions are recorded in the proper period.*
Classification
Examine a sample of payroll checks for proper classification into expense accounts.*
Assertions about Account Balances at Period End
Example Tests of Details of Account Balances
Existence
Vouch selected amounts from the account analysis schedules for the accruals to 
supporting documentation (payroll tax returns, corporate benefit policies, etc.).
Rights and obligations
Review supporting documentation to determine that the entity is legally obligated to 
pay the liability.
Test a sample of bank reconciliations for the payroll bank account (see Chapter 16).
Completeness
Search for unrecorded liabilities (see Chapter 11).

(payroll expense and related accruals).
Valuation and allocation
Obtain an account analysis schedule for accrued payroll liabilities; foot schedules and 
agree total to general ledger.
Compare amounts accrued to supporting documentation, such as payroll tax returns.
Assertions about Presentation and Disclosure

proxy statements, and the federal tax return. Limits may also be placed on officers’ salaries 
and bonuses as part of lending agreements. If such limits are exceeded, the entity may be in 
default on the debt. Officers’ compensation is also examined because, as noted earlier, offi­
cers are in a position to override the control activities and pay themselves more than they are 
authorized to receive (see Exhibit 12–2). Officers’ compensation expense can be verified by 
comparing the amounts shown in the payroll records with the amounts authorized in either 
board of directors’ minutes or employment contracts and by searching for other cash pay­
ments made to the officer, his or her family, or related parties.
Accrued Payroll Liabilities
An entity incurs a number of payroll-related liabilities. In addition to these accrued expenses, 
the entity also withholds various amounts from an employee’s pay. These withholdings 
include payroll taxes (federal and state income taxes and FICA), medical and life insurance 
premiums, pension, and other miscellaneous deductions. Some examples of accrued payroll 
liabilities include
	
∙	 Accrued wages and salaries.
	
∙	 Accrued payroll taxes.
	
∙	 Accrued commissions.
	
∙	 Accrued bonuses.
	
∙	 Accrued benefits such as vacation and sick pay.
In auditing accrued payroll liabilities, the auditor is concerned mainly with five audit 
assertions: existence, completeness, valuation, cutoff, and presentation and disclosure asser­
tion of completeness. When control risk is low or the amounts in the accounts are relatively 
small, the auditor can verify accrued payroll liabilities using substantive analytical proce­
dures. For example, the auditor can compare the prior year’s balance in each accrual with the 
current year’s balance after considering changing conditions.
For accrued payroll liability accounts for which the control risk is high or whose amounts are 
material, the auditor can obtain a detailed account analysis schedule. For example, Exhibit 12-3 
shows an account analysis schedule for EarthWear’s accrued payroll taxes. The credits to the 
account represent the recognition of payroll tax expense at the end of each pay period. These 
amounts can be traced to the various payroll tax returns or other documentation filed by the 
entity and should agree with the amount of payroll tax expense included in the income state­
ment. The debits to the account represent payments made to relevant government agencies. 
These payments can be verified by tracing the amounts to the cash disbursements journal.
Executive Compensation at Embattled MF Global
Shortly after MF Global filed for bankruptcy in October 2011, Jon S. Corzine, former governor of New 
Jersey, resigned as chairman and chief executive. At the time of his resignation, MF Global faced federal 
investigations into $630 million in missing customer money. Corzine had been with the firm less than 
2 years, but during that time he transformed the sleepy brokerage firm by aggressively buying up Euro­
pean sovereign debt, betting that the troubled countries would not default. During his short time at MF 
Global he was paid more than $4 million. At the time of his resignation, Corzine said he would not seek the 
$12.1 million in severance compensation MF Global owed him. Later, forensic accountants found that the 
amount of customer money that could not be accounted for was closer to $1.2 billion, which was believed 
to be inappropriately used to prop up the company. Investors say Corzine should face criminal charges, 
though his role in the lost funds is unclear. Corzine has denied wrongdoing. Federal lawsuits claiming 
Corzine illegally transferred funds continue. As of 2014, former executives had spent over $47 million on 
their legal defense.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
An interesting aspect of this type of accrual account is that it periodically “clears out” 
the accrued amount. For example, if the entity has to make payments for payroll taxes to the 
government on the 15th of each month, the accrued payroll taxes account will have a zero 
balance after the payment. Thus, at the end of any month, the accrued payroll taxes account 
should contain only an accrual for payroll taxes since the last payment (approximately two 
weeks). In many organizations, these costs are broken down into the various types of payroll 
taxes (employer’s FICA and federal and state unemployment taxes).
Cutoff  The auditor also wants to determine whether all payroll-related liabilities are 
recorded in the proper period. An examination of supporting documentation for the accruals 
provides evidence on the proper period for recording the expense or liability. For example, an 
examination of the entity’s unemployment tax invoices should allow the auditor to determine 
if a proper accrual for unemployment tax has been made in the current period.
Existence and Valuation  The existence and valuation assertions can generally be tested 
at the same time. The auditor’s concerns are whether the recorded liabilities are valid obliga­
tions of the entity and whether they are included in the financial statements at the appropriate 
amount. To verify the existence and valuation of an accrued payroll liability, the auditor can 
generally trace the amounts included on the account analysis working paper to supporting 
documentation such as payroll tax reports. If adequate documentation is present, the auditor 
has evidence that the amount represents a valid liability. The auditor can usually verify the 
accuracy of the amounts by recalculating the figures.
Completeness  The auditor wants to make sure that all payroll-related liabilities are 
recorded. The auditor should be aware of the normal payroll-related taxes that are paid by the 
entity and therefore should be able to determine if accruals have been made for payroll taxes 
such as Social Security taxes and unemployment insurance. In some instances, the auditor’s 
search for unrecorded liabilities, which was discussed in Chapter 11, may provide evidence 
that all payroll-related liabilities are recorded.
Presentation and Disclosure: Completeness  The auditor must ensure that all neces­
sary financial statement disclosures for the human resource management process are made. 
Table 12–9 presents examples of items that should be disclosed.
Accounting standards require substantial disclosure. FASB ASC Topic 718 requires 
detailed disclosures of pension costs, postretirement benefits, and share-based compensation 
(see the Advanced Module in this chapter for a discussion of share-based compensation).

Although a thorough discussion of the audit of these items is beyond the scope of this text, 
the reader should be aware that such disclosures are important to the fairness of the financial 
statements. Profit-sharing plans and deferred compensation arrangements also require disclo­
sure in the footnotes.
Practice 
INSIGHT
In early 2006 the SEC began a probe to detect possible stock-option abuses, particularly the impec­
cable timing of granting stock options to corporate executives. Analysis of stock price patterns and 
grant dates suggested that companies were backdating the grant date of stock options to a low 
in the stock price so that executives and employees could benefit from sharp stock appreciation. 
One popular technology company involved in backdating was Apple Inc. In 2006, Apple disclosed 
that thousands of option grants between 1997 and 2002, including those to CEO Steve Jobs, were 
improperly dated. The SEC sued Apple’s former CFO and general counsel alleging involvement in 
backdating; the lawsuits were settled out of court for $5.7 million. In a related shareholder lawsuit, 
Steve Jobs and other Apple executives agreed to settle claims about their alleged participation for 
$14 million. In July 2006, the SEC adopted new rules requiring detailed disclosure of stock-option 
grants. For a summary of the new disclosure requirements see www.sec.gov.

Evaluating the Audit Findings—  
Payroll-Related Accounts
When the auditor has completed the planned substantive procedures of the payroll-related 
accounts, all the identified misstatements should be aggregated. The likely misstatement is 
compared to the tolerable misstatement allocated to the payroll-related accounts. If the likely 
misstatement is less than the tolerable misstatement, the auditor may accept the accounts as 
fairly presented. Conversely, if the likely misstatement exceeds the tolerable misstatement, the 
auditor should conclude that the accounts are not fairly presented.
For example, in Chapter 3 the tolerable misstatement for EarthWear was set at $900,000. 
Exhibit 3–3 showed that Willis & Adams detected a misstatement in recording payroll expense 
and bonuses that amounted to a $215,000 understatement of accrued liabilities. Because this 
misstatement is less than the tolerable misstatement of $900,000, Willis & Adams can con­
clude that the audit evidence supports fair presentation. However, if the misstatement were 
greater than the tolerable misstatement, the evidence would not support fair presentation. In 
this case the auditor would have two choices: adjust the accounts to reduce the misstatement 
to an amount less than the tolerable misstatement or qualify the audit report.
The auditor should again analyze the misstatements discovered through the application 
of substantive procedures because these misstatements may provide additional evidence on 
the control risk for the payroll system. If the auditor concludes that the audit risk is unaccept­
ably high, additional audit procedures should be performed, or the auditor must be satisfied 
that the entity has adjusted the payroll-related financial statement accounts to an acceptable 
level. For example, suppose the auditor’s substantive analytical procedures indicate that 
commissions expense is overstated. The auditor might perform detailed computations of

commissions expense or request that the entity adjust the account by the amount of the esti­
mated misstatement.
Advanced Module: Share-Based Compensation
Accounting for stock options and similar compensation has been a controversial area for many 
years. In 1995 the FASB issued Statement No. 123, “Share-Based Compensation,” which 
encouraged but did not mandate the use of the fair value method to determine compensation 
expense on the income statement. Initially, nearly all companies continued to use the intrinsic 
value method to report compensation expense, which typically resulted in zero compensation 
expense. After the accounting scandals of the early 2000s, some companies (e.g., Amazon, 
Coca-Cola) decided voluntarily to use the fair value method to determine share-based com­
pensation expense as a way of signaling the high quality of their financial reporting to the 
capital markets. Within a few years, over 700 companies in the United States voluntarily 
applied the fair value method. The FASB revisited the issue of share-based compensation, and 
in December 2004 the FASB issued Statement No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment,” requiring 
the expensing of the fair value of stock options granted and other share-based payments as 
compensation. Statement No. 123R (now found in FASB ASC Topic 718) became effective in 
2006 for most public companies.
The determination of the fair value for share-based payments will require the use of an 
option-pricing model for most companies. The most common models are the Black-­Scholes-
Merton model and the binomial model. These models incorporate a variety of factors, 
including
	
∙	 The exercise price of the option.
	
∙	 The term of the option.
	
∙	 The current market price of the underlying stock.
	
∙	 Expected volatility.
	
∙	 Expected dividends.
	
∙	 Expected risk-free rate.
Many of these factors are complex and involve forward-looking information. In addi­
tion to FASB ASC Topic 718, entities and auditors must also consider guidance found in 
FASB ASC Subtopic 505-50, “Equity Based Payments to Non-employees.” As noted in the 
chapter, accounting for share-based payments often presents high inherent risk because of the 
complexity of the accounting rules and the degree of judgment and estimation that must go 
into the fair value determination. Audit firms develop extensive audit programs to help audit 
teams ensure that an entity is appropriately accounting for stock-based compensation. While 
detailed coverage of auditing for share-based compensation is beyond the scope of this book, 
we provide a brief overview of issues and procedures.
Once the auditor has a general sense for the extent to which share-based compensation is 
used by the company, he or she would normally perform procedures such as
	
∙	 Read all applicable share-based plans and inquire of management whether other 
documents (e.g., employment agreements) contain relevant information.
	
∙	 Understand policies, processes, and controls around share-based compensation.
	
∙	 Test design and operating effectiveness of controls, including a determination that the 
transactions have been properly authorized.
	
∙	 Obtain and verify the accuracy of schedules supporting the granting of share-based 
compensation awards.
	
∙	 Review board of directors’ minutes to ensure completeness of the supporting 
schedules and to identify modifications to the terms of outstanding awards or existing 
plans (e.g., exercise price or date).

	
Chapter 12    Auditing the Human Resource Management Process	
441
	
∙	 Perform analytical procedures to identify unusual fluctuations in compensation 
expense as well as related income/expense accounts.
	
∙	 Determine if any awards were exercised for other than cash (e.g., loans) or if 
employees were offered the opportunity to replace an out-of-the-money award for 
another award.
In addition to these procedures the auditor would obtain evidence to support the fair value 
measurements or option pricing. With the movement in accounting standards toward more 
fair value accounting, auditors will need improved understanding of valuation issues. Because 
auditing fair value is further addressed in the Advanced Module in Chapter 16, “Auditing 
Fair Value Measurements,” the discussion here will be brief. To obtain sufficient appropriate 
evidence on the fair value of options, the auditor is not required to become an option-pricing 
expert. If the entity is using an approved model (e.g., Black-Scholes-Merton or binomial), 
the auditor would verify the mathematical accuracy of the entity’s calculations, tie the output 
of the model to the financial statements, and tie the known inputs (e.g., term, stock price) to 
relevant source documents. For forward-looking inputs (e.g., expected volatility, dividends, 
interest rate), the auditor would perform procedures to test the reasonableness of these inputs. 
The entity should have a verifiable and consistent method to estimate these parameters.
Often the auditor will use the work of a valuation specialist to obtain evidence regarding 
fair value measurements. When specialists are used, the auditor is required to evaluate the 
specialist’s qualifications and objectivity. The auditor also must determine if the valuation 
model used by the specialist is appropriate and consistent with GAAP, and the auditor must 
understand and agree with the reasonableness of the underlying assumptions.

statement of payroll expense is high. In addition, McCarthy obtained an understand­
ing of internal control and set the control risk for payroll-related assertions at the 
maximum level.

12-27	 James, who was engaged to examine the financial statements of Talbert Corporation, 
is about to audit payroll. Talbert uses a computer service center to process weekly 
payroll as follows.
	
	
	 	
Each Monday Talbert’s payroll clerk inserts data in appropriate spaces on the pre­
printed service center–prepared input form and sends it to the service center via mes­
senger. The service center extracts new permanent data from the input form and updates 
its master files. The weekly payroll data are then processed. The weekly payroll register 
and payroll checks are printed and delivered by messenger to Talbert on Thursday.
	
	
	 	
Part of the sample selected for audit by James includes the data from the “payroll 
input” table and payroll register, which are provided below followed by the Talbert 
payroll register.
Required:
	
a.	 Describe how James should verify the information in the payroll input form 
shown.
	
b.	 Describe (but do not perform) the procedures that James should follow in examin­
ing the November payroll register shown below.

Executive compensation ballooned in the 1990s, and as highlighted in 
Exhibit 12-1, there were notable compensation abuses. The most popular form of 
executive compensation in the 1990s was company stock (or options to purchase 
stock). Designers of these compensation plans argue that by compensating officers 
with stock, the officers will take actions in the best interest of the shareholders. ­Critics 
claim executive compensation is often too high in proportion to average salaries at 
companies and that the compensation levels motivate officers to take selfish actions.
Required:
	
a.	 Research executive compensation of some well-known companies. (You can find 
executive compensation in SEC filings on EDGAR at www.sec.gov or on a vari­
ety of Internet sites, such as www.aflcio.org/corporatewatch.) Use your best judg­
ment to compute the proportion of executive compensation to average employee 
salary (i.e., are executives earning 5 times, or 10 times, or 100 times the average 
employee). In your opinion, are the executives worth it?
	
b.	 In your opinion, what are the costs and benefits associated with compensating 
executives with stock or options to purchase stock?
	
c.	 What do you believe are the most effective audit procedures to use to identify 
executive compensation abuse or fraud? Please explain why.

Auditing the Inventory 
Management Process
F
or most manufacturing, wholesale, and merchandising (retail) entities, 
inventory is a major component of the balance sheet. The complex­
ity of auditing inventory may be affected by the degree of processing 
required to manufacture products. In a merchandising business, products are 
purchased directly from vendors with little or no additional processing by the 
entity before sale. In such cases, verifying inventory is relatively straightfor­
ward. On the other hand, determining a proper inventory value may be more 
difficult when the production process involves numerous steps. The presen­
tation in this chapter mainly discusses inventory in terms of a merchandising 
company. However, the audit approach followed for merchandising entities is 
easily adapted to other types of inventory processes.
The coverage of the inventory management process follows the com­
ponents of the audit risk model. An overview of the inventory management 
process is presented first, followed by discussion of the risk of material mis­
statement, specifically inherent risk factors and control risk assessment. While 
the main focus of this chapter is auditing the inventory management process 
for a financial statement audit, the concepts covered for setting control risk 
are applicable to an audit of internal control over financial reporting for public 
companies. The last part of the chapter discusses the substantive procedures 
for inventory with particular emphasis on auditing standard costs and observ­
ing physical inventory.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The inventory management process is affected by the control activities previously discussed for 
the revenue, purchasing, and payroll processes. Figure 13–1 shows how each of these processes 
interacts with the inventory management process. The acquisition of and payment for inventory 
are controlled via the purchasing process. The cost of both direct and indirect labor assigned to 
inventory is controlled through the payroll process. Last, finished goods are sold and accounted 
for as part of the revenue process. Thus, the “cradle-to-grave” cycle for inventory begins when 
goods are purchased and stored and ends when the finished goods are shipped to customers.
Inventory can represent one of the most complex parts of the audit. For example, while 
determining the quantity of inventory on hand is usually an easy audit step to complete, 
assigning costs to value those quantities is more difficult. Additionally, there may be other 
troublesome valuation issues related to inventory such as obsolescence and lower-of-cost-or-
market value.

Description of EarthWear’s Inventory System* 
Clothing and other products sold by EarthWear are developed by the company’s design department. All 
goods are produced by independent manufacturers, except for most of EarthWear’s soft luggage. The 
company purchases merchandise from more than 200 domestic and foreign manufacturers. For many 
major suppliers, goods are ordered and paid for through the company’s electronic data interchange (EDI) 
system. The computerized inventory control system handles the receipt of shipments from manufacturers. 
Goods are received at the receiving department, where the information is agreed to the purchase order 
(receiving report) and entered into the inventory control system.
The company’s sales representatives enter orders into an online order entry and inventory control 
system; customers using the company’s Internet site complete a computer screen that enters the orders. 
Computer processing of orders is performed each night on a batch basis, at which time shipping tickets 
are printed with bar codes for optical scanning. Inventory is picked based on the location of individual 
products rather than orders, followed by computerized sorting and transporting of goods to multiple pack­
ing stations and shipping zones.
*For simplicity of presentation, we have not included inventory processes at EarthWear’s outlet stores.

activities and tests of controls for the inventory management process in more detail. However, 
because of differences in products and their subsequent processing, the inventory system usu­
ally differs from one entity to the next. The reader should concentrate on understanding the 
basic concepts of internal control. The following topics related to the inventory management 
process are discussed:
	
∙	 Types of documents and records.
	
∙	 The major functions.
	
∙	 The key segregation of duties.
Types of Documents and Records
Table 13–1 lists the more important documents and records that are normally involved in 
the inventory system. Not all of these documents are presented in Figure 13–2. They are dis­
cussed here to give the reader information on documents and records that might exist in an 
inventory management process of a manufacturing company. The reader should keep in mind 
that in an IT system some of these documents and records may exist for only a short time or 
only in digital form.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Production Schedule  A production schedule is normally prepared periodically based on 
the expected demand for the entity’s products. The expected demand may be based on the 
current backlog of orders or on sales forecasts from the sales or marketing department. In 
EarthWear’s system, this schedule is prepared by the design department. Production sched­
ules determine the quantity of goods needed and the time at which goods must be ready in 
order to meet demand. Many organizations use material requirements planning or just-in-time 
inventory programs to assist with production planning. Production schedules give the auditor 
information on the planned level of operating activity.
Receiving Report  The receiving report records the receipt of goods from vendors. This 
document was discussed as part of the purchasing process. It is reconsidered in the inventory 
management process because a copy of this document accompanies the goods to the inventory 
department and is used to update the entity’s perpetual inventory records. Note in Figure 13–2 
that the data from the receiving report are input into the inventory program to update the inven­
tory master file, which contains the information on the entity’s perpetual records.
Materials Requisition  Materials requisitions are normally used to track materials during 
the production process. Materials requisitions are normally prepared by department personnel 
as needed for production purposes. For example, the materials requisition is the document 
that authorizes the release of raw materials from the raw materials department. A copy of the 
materials requisition may be maintained in the raw materials department, and another copy 
may accompany the goods to the production departments.
Inventory Master File  The inventory master file contains all the important information 
related to the entity’s inventory, including the perpetual inventory records. In sophisticated 
inventory systems such as EarthWear’s, the inventory master file also contains information 
on the costs used to value inventory. In a manufacturing company, it would not be unusual for 
the inventory master file to contain the standard costs used to value the inventory at various 
stages of production.
Production Data Information  In a manufacturing company, production information 
about the transfer of goods and related cost accumulation at each stage of production should 
be reported. This information updates the entity’s perpetual inventory system. It is also used 
as input to generate the cost accumulation and variance report that is produced by the inven­
tory system.
Cost Accumulation and Variance Report  Most inventory control systems in a manu­
facturing setting produce reports similar to a cost accumulation and variance report. Material, 
labor, and overhead costs are charged to inventory as part of the manufacturing process. The 
cost accumulation aspect of the report summarizes the various costs charged to departments 
and products. The variance aspect of the report presents the results of inventory processing in 
terms of actual costs versus standard or budgeted costs. The cost accounting and manufactur­
ing departments review the report for appropriate charges.
Inventory Status Report  The inventory status report shows the type and amount of prod­
ucts on hand. Such a report is basically a summary of the perpetual inventory records. This 
report can also be used to determine the status of goods in process. 
Shipping Order  This document was discussed as part of the revenue process. It is recon­
sidered here because a copy of this document is used to remove goods from the entity’s per­
petual inventory records. Note in Figure 13–2 that the inventory master file is updated when a 
receiving report is processed or when a shipping order is generated.

The Major Functions
Table 13–2 summarizes the functions that normally take place in a typical inventory manage­
ment process.
Inventory Management  In a manufacturing company, a production management depart­
ment would be responsible for managing inventory through planning and scheduling manu­
facturing activities. At EarthWear, the inventory management function is performed by the 
design department. This department is responsible for maintaining inventory at appropriate 
levels. It issues purchase requisitions to the purchasing department and thus represents the 
point at which the inventory management process integrates with the purchasing process. 
Raw Materials Stores  The raw material stores function is responsible for the receipt, cus­
tody, and issuance of raw materials. When goods are received from vendors, they are trans­
ferred from the receiving department to the raw materials stores department. Once goods 
arrive in the raw materials storage area, they must be safeguarded against pilferage or unau­
thorized use. Finally, when goods are requested for production through the issuance of a mate­
rials requisition, this function issues the goods to the appropriate manufacturing department.
Manufacturing  The main objective of the manufacturing function is to produce the prod­
uct. From an auditing perspective, there must be adequate control over the physical flow of 
the goods and proper accumulation of the costs attached to inventory. The manner in which 
costs are accumulated varies substantially from one entity to another. Entities may produce 
goods using a job order cost system, a process cost system, or some combination of both.
Finished Goods Stores  The finished goods stores function is responsible for the storage 
of and control over finished goods. When goods are completed by the manufacturing function, 
they are transferred to finished goods stores. Again, there must be adequate safeguards against 
pilferage or unauthorized use. When goods are ordered by a customer, a shipping order is 
produced by the revenue process and forwarded to the finished goods stores department. The 
goods are then transferred to the shipping department for shipment to the customer. Because 
EarthWear  is a merchandising company, it maintains only finished goods (see Figure 13–2).
Cost Accounting  Cost accounting is responsible for ensuring that costs are properly 
attached to inventory as goods are processed through the manufacturing function. Cost 
accounting reviews the cost accumulation and variance reports after such data are processed 
into the accounting records.
General Ledger  The main objective of the general ledger function is to ensure that all 
inventory and costs of production are properly accumulated, classified, and summarized in 
the general ledger accounts. In an IT system, control or summary totals ensure that this func­
tion is performed correctly. One important control performed by the general ledger function is 
the reconciliation of the perpetual inventory records to the general ledger inventory accounts.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The Key Segregation of Duties
Segregation of duties is a particularly important control in the inventory management process 
because of the potential for theft and fraud. Therefore, individuals involved in the inventory 
management and inventory stores functions should not have access to the inventory records, 
the cost-accounting records, or the general ledger. When the inventory accounting records are 
maintained in an IT environment, there should be proper segregation of duties within the IT 
department. Table 13–3 shows the key segregation of duties for the inventory management 
process and examples of possible errors or fraud that can result from conflicts in duties. 
Table 13–4 shows the proper segregation of duties for individual inventory functions across 
the various departments that control inventory processing.
Stop and Think: Before reading further, take a look at EarthWear’s  flowchart in

Key Segregation of Duties in the Inventory Management Process 
and Possible Errors or Fraud
Segregation of Duties
Possible Errors or Fraud Resulting from Conflicts of Duties
The inventory management function should be seg­
regated from the cost-accounting function.
If the individual responsible for inventory management also has access to the cost- accounting 
records, production and inventory costs can be manipulated. This may lead to an over- or 
understatement of inventory and net income.
The inventory stores function should be segregated 
from the cost-accounting function.
If one individual is responsible for both controlling and accounting for inventory, unauthorized 
shipments can be made or theft of goods can be covered up.
The cost-accounting function should be segregated 
from the general ledger function.
If one individual is responsible for the inventory records and for the general ledger, it is pos­
sible for that individual to conceal unauthorized shipments. This can result in the theft of 
goods, leading to an overstatement of inventory.
The responsibility for supervising physical inventory 
should be separated from the inventory manage­
ment and inventory stores functions.
If the individual responsible for production management or inventory stores function is also 
responsible for the physical inventory, it is possible that inventory shortages can be covered 
up through the adjustment of the inventory records to the physical inventory, resulting in an 
overstatement of inventory.

Inherent Risk Assessment
In examining the inventory management process, the auditor needs to consider the inherent 
risk factors that may affect the transactions processed by the system and the financial state­
ment accounts affected by those transactions. The auditor should consider industry-related 
factors and operating and engagement characteristics (see Chapter 4) when assessing the pos­
sibility of a material misstatement.
LO 13-5

	
Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process	
457
Industry-Related Factors
A number of industry factors may indicate the presence of material misstatements in inven­
tory. For example, if industry competition is intense, there may be problems with the proper 
valuation of inventory in terms of lower-of-cost-or-market values. Changes in technology or a 
drop in customer demand may also result in a material misstatement due to obsolescence (see 
Exhibit 13–2).
Engagement and Operating Characteristics
A number of engagement and operating characteristics are important to the assessment of 
inherent risk for inventory. First, the type of product sold by the entity can increase the poten­
tial for defalcation. For example, products that are small and of high value, such as jewelry, 
are more susceptible to theft than large products are. Second, inventory is often difficult to 
audit, and its valuation may result in disagreements with the entity. Finally, the auditor must 
be alert to possible related-party transactions for acquiring raw materials and selling the fin­
ished product. For example, the entity may purchase raw materials from a company controlled 
by the chief executive officer at prices in excess of market value. In such a case, the value of 
inventory will be overstated, and cash will have been misappropriated from the entity.
Audit research has also shown that there is a relatively high risk that inventory contains 
material misstatements.1 In fact, some of the most notorious accounting frauds in history have 
involved inventory manipulations. For example, in the 1990s management of Phar-Mor, a dis­
count store retail chain, committed a $500 million fraud and much of it had to do with inven­
tory accounting. For example, the fraudsters recorded a debit to a fraudulent holding account 
rather than to cost of goods sold when inventory was sold. Then just before year-end, Phar-Mor 
accountants emptied the contents of the fraudulent holding account and allocated it to stores as 
fictitious inventory (see a detailed description of the Phar-Mor fraud and related trial on 
Connect). Exhibit 13–3 describes the inventory fraud at Centennial Technologies, Inc.
Prior-year misstatements are good indicators of potential misstatements in the current 
year; thus, auditors should carefully consider if misstatements found in the prior years’ audit 
may be present in the current inventory and plan the audit accordingly.

Huge Surface Write-Down
In 2013 Microsoft shares dropped 11 percent on the news that the company was taking an inventory write-
down of nearly $1 billion due to poor adoption of the Microsoft Surface RT tablet; Microsoft’s first PC. The 
write-down was triggered when Microsoft announced it was knocking $150 off the $500 sales price of the 
tablet only months after it’s debut. By the 3rd quarter of 2014, Microsoft’s Surface did finally turn a profit, 
after two years and nearly $2 billion in losses.

Inventory Scams at Centennial Technologies
Background
Centennial Technologies designed, manufactured, and marketed an extensive line of PC cards: rugged, lightweight, credit card–sized 
devices inserted into a dedicated slot in a broad range of electronic equipment that contain microprocessors, such as portable computers, 
telecommunications equipment, and manufacturing equipment. The company’s customer list included companies such as Philips Electron­
ics, Sharp Electronics Corporation, and Xerox Corporation.
Emanuel Pinez was the CEO of technology highflier Centennial Technologies, Inc., in the mid-1990s. In 1996, Centennial’s surging stock 
graduated to the New York Stock Exchange just two years after going public. It finished 1996 as the best-performing stock on the big board, 
up a stunning 451 percent. Just before the fraud was uncovered, analysts still had “strong buy” recommendations outstanding.
Pinez had an impressive résumé, but it turns out much of it was false. After the scandal broke, investors and the auditors learned what 
Pinez’s wife knew, that he was a “pathological liar.” For example, as a young man he claimed to have set a world record in an international 
swimming competition across the English Channel. The reports were published, and Pinez was hailed briefly as a national hero—until the 
truth came out that there was no such competition or record. Pinez constantly made aggressive estimates regarding Centennial’s growth, 
and in 1996 he began telling investors that Centennial was negotiating an order worth more than $300 million with AT&T (no such deal ever 
took place or apparently even existed).
Card Scam
Centennial’s growth attracted several sophisticated institutional investors, such as Oppenheimer Funds Inc. and Fidelity Investments. 
Some investors started to crave a firsthand look at Centennial’s operations. One investor sent an analyst to meet with Pinez and tour 
the headquarters in Billerica, Massachusetts. Although the analyst noticed some computer equipment in the administrative offices, 
he was somewhat surprised that there was none in Pinez’s office. During a tour of Centennial’s manufacturing facilities, he saw “a 
room full of people banging on cards with rubber mallets. I had a bad feeling.” He returned to his firm and “dumped the Centennial 
shares immediately.”
In truth, Pinez had enlisted a handful of employees in the company’s Billerica manufacturing plant to assemble fake memory cards 
by simply welding the casings together and leaving out a critical silicon computer chip. These fake cards made their way into inventory 
and sales.
Flash 98 Scam
In the fourth quarter of 1996 Centennial began shipping a new product called “Flash 1998.” It was a miniature memory card for notebook 
computers. Sales for fiscal year 1996 amounted to about $2 million. The company told the auditors that it wanted to keep the details of 
the card relatively quiet for a few more months for competitive reasons. Pinez indicated that due to design advances developed by Cen­
tennial’s research and development team, these new cards had an extremely low production cost, about 10 cents, with a sales price of a 
whopping $500. It turns out there was no such product. All sales were to one company, BBC. The company was run by a close personal 
friend of Pinez. To fool the auditors into thinking an actual sale took place, Pinez wired $1 million of his own personal funds to a third com­
pany, St. Jude Management Corp., which then paid Centennial on behalf of BBC for its Flash 98 purchases. After the fraud was uncovered, 
the auditors, Coopers & Lybrand, claimed that the Flash 98 scam was a “unique” fraud because it appeared that a product was going out 
and cash was coming in.
Aftermath
From his prison cell, Pinez denied any wrongdoing and indicated that his actions were undertaken to benefit the company. Pinez attributed 
his problems to the scrutiny that inevitably comes with success: “You get lightning when you’re very high.”

relies on substantive procedures to determine the fairness of inventory. Such a strategy may be 
appropriate when internal control is not adequate.
In many cases, however, the auditor can rely on internal control for inventory. This 
normally occurs when the entity has an integrated cost-accounting/inventory management 
system. For discussion purposes, we will walk through the major steps in setting control 
risk assuming that the auditor has decided to follow a reliance strategy. Figure 13–3 sum­
marizes the three steps for setting the control risk following this strategy. Each of these 
steps is only briefly reviewed within the context of the inventory management process 
because the reader should thoroughly understand the control risk setting process followed 
by auditors.

	
Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process	
459
Understand and Document Internal Control
In order to set the control risk for the inventory management process, the auditor must under­
stand the internal control components. Two points should be mentioned. First, if the entity 
uses IT for monitoring the flow of goods and accumulating costs, the auditor will need to 
evaluate both the general IT controls and the inventory application controls. Second, the audi­
tor will need a thorough understanding of the process used by the entity to value inventory.
Plan and Perform Tests of Controls
In performing this step, the auditor again must identify the relevant control activities within 
the entity’s inventory system that ensure that material misstatements are either prevented or 
detected and corrected. Audit procedures used to test the entity’s control activities in the 
inventory management process are discussed in subsequent sections.
Set and Document the Control Risk
Once the controls in the inventory system have been tested, the auditor sets the level of control 
risk. The auditor should document the achieved level of control risk using either quantitative 
amounts or qualitative terms. The documentation supporting the achieved level of control risk 
for the inventory management process might include a flowchart (such as the one shown in 
Figure 13–2), the results of the tests of controls, and a memorandum indicating the overall 
conclusions about control risk.

Occurrence of Inventory Transactions
The auditor’s main concern is that all recorded inventory transactions actually occurred. The 
major control activity for preventing fictitious inventory transactions from being recorded 
is proper segregation of duties, in which the inventory management and inventory stores 
functions are separated from the departments responsible for inventory and cost-accounting 
records. This control prevents operating personnel from having access to both inventory and 

	
Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process	
461
the perpetual inventory records. Additionally, prenumbered documents to handle the receipt, 
transfer, and withdrawal of inventory may prevent the recording of fictitious inventory in the 
accounting records.
The auditor should also be concerned that goods may be stolen. The auditor’s concern 
about theft of goods varies, depending upon the type of product sold or manufactured by the 
entity. Products that are large or cumbersome may be difficult to steal. However, products that 
are small and of high value, such as jewelry or computer memory chips, are more susceptible 
to theft. The entity should maintain physical safeguards over inventory that are consistent 
with the susceptibility and value of the goods.
Stop and Think: What controls does EarthWear  have in place to address the occur­
rence assertion? How would you gather audit evidence regarding the effectiveness of 
these controls?
Review and observation are the main tests of controls used by the auditor to test the 
control activities shown in Table 13–5. For example, the auditor can observe and evaluate the 
employees’ segregation of duties. The auditor can also review and test the entity’s procedures 
for the transfer of raw materials from the receiving department and their issuance to the manu­
facturing departments.
Completeness of Inventory Transactions
The control activities for the completeness assertion relate to recording inventory that has 
been received. Typically, the control activities for this assertion are contained within the 
purchasing process. These control activities and the related tests of controls were presented 
in Table 11–6 in Chapter 11. For example, in some instances, additional control activities 
may be used in the raw materials stores department to ensure that the goods are recorded in 
the perpetual inventory records. This might include comparing a summary of the receiving 
reports to the inventory status report.
If goods are consigned, the entity must have control activities to ensure that goods held 
on consignment by other parties are included in inventory and goods held on consignment for 
others are excluded from inventory. The auditor can review the entity’s procedures for includ­
ing or excluding consigned goods.
Authorization of Inventory Transactions
The control activities for the purchase of materials were discussed in Chapter 11 on the pur­
chasing process. The auditor’s concern with authorization in the inventory system is with 
unauthorized purchase or production activity that may lead to excess levels of certain types 
of finished goods. If such goods can quickly become obsolete, ending inventory may be over­
stated. The preparation and review of authorized purchase schedules by EarthWear’s  design 
department should prevent such misstatements. The use of some type of inventory-planning 
system, such as a material requirements planning system or a just-in-time inventory system, 
may also limit unauthorized production.
Accuracy of Inventory Transactions
Accuracy is an important assertion because inventory transactions that are not properly 
recorded result in misstatements that directly affect the amounts reported in the financial 
statements for cost of goods sold and inventory. The accurate processing of inventory pur­
chase transactions involves applying the correct price to the actual quantity received. Simi­
larly, when inventory is shipped, accurate processing requires that the actual number of items 
shipped be removed from inventory and that the proper cost be recorded to cost of goods 
sold. The use of a perpetual inventory system in conjunction with a periodic or annual physi­
cal inventory count should result in the proper quantities of inventory being shown in the 
entity’s perpetual inventory records. EarthWear  maintains the purchase cost of its products 

462	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
in its master inventory file. Many manufacturing companies use standard cost systems to 
value their inventory. Standard costs should approximate actual costs, and the presence of 
large variances is one signal that the inventory may not be valued appropriately. Auditing the 
entity’s physical inventory and standard costs is discussed in more detail later in the chapter.
Management should also have controls in place to consider inventory obsolescence. 
Inventory management personnel should periodically review inventory on hand for obsolete, 
slow-moving, or excess inventory. Such inventory should be written down to its fair market 
value. The auditor can review the entity’s procedures for identifying obsolete, slow-moving, 
or excess inventory. EarthWear’s  design department closely monitors its products to iden­
tify any end-of-season merchandise or overstocks, which are then sold at liquidation prices 
through special catalog inserts.
Cutoff of Inventory Transactions
Inventory transactions recorded in the improper period could affect a number of accounts, as 
illustrated by this simple inventory computation:
Beginning inventory + Purchases – Cost of goods sold = Ending inventory
The cutoff risks, control activities, and tests of controls associated with inventory transac­
tions were already addressed in Chapters 10 and 11, since the sale of inventory involves the rev­
enue process and purchase of inventory involves the purchasing process. For sold (purchased) 
inventory, a common test of the entity’s controls to ensure transactions are recorded in a timely 
manner is to compare the date on the shipping document (receiving report) with the date in the 
sales journal (payment voucher). There should not be a long period between these two dates. 
As discussed later, auditors also often focus tests of details on transactions near year-end.
It is important to understand that failure to record inventory in the proper period can 
result in misstatements on both the balance sheet and income statement. For example, if items 
shipped FOB–destination point are recorded as sold before they are received by the customer, 
then revenue, costs of goods sold, and receivables will be overstated and inventory will be 
understated.
Stop and Think: Considering what you know about EarthWear’s  business, how impor­
tant do you think the classification assertion is for EarthWear’s inventory compared to 
inventory at a typical manufacturing company?
Classification of Inventory Transactions
Classification is not an important assertion for EarthWear’s  inventory because all goods are 
finished and ready for sale. However, in a manufacturing company, the entity must have con­
trol activities to ensure that inventory is properly classified as raw materials, work in process, 
or finished goods. This can usually be accomplished by determining which departments in 
the manufacturing process are included in raw materials, work in process, and finished goods 
inventory. Thus, by knowing which manufacturing department holds the inventory, the entity 
is able to classify it by type.
Relating the Assessed Level of Control Risk 
to Substantive Procedures
The same judgment process is followed in setting control risk in the inventory management 
process that was used with other processes. For example, EarthWear  has strong controls 
over the processing of inventory transactions. The auditor can rely on those controls if tests 
LO 13-8

	
Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process	
463
of controls indicate that the controls are operating effectively. If the results of the tests of 
controls for the inventory system do not support the planned level of control risk, the auditor 
would set control risk higher and set detection risk lower. This would lead to increased sub­
stantive procedures.
Auditing Inventory
The discussion of the audit of inventory follows the process outlined in prior chapters. Two 
categories of substantive procedures are discussed: substantive analytical procedures and tests 
of details of account balances and disclosures. Table 13–6 presents the assertions for classes 
of transactions, events, account balances, and disclosures as they apply to inventory. You 
should note that the auditor may gather evidence about assertions related to transactions (sub­
stantive tests of transactions) in conjunction with testing the internal controls. If the tests of 
controls indicate that the controls are not operating effectively, the auditor may need to test 
transactions at the date the account balance is tested.
Assertions about Classes of Transactions, Events, Account Balances, 
and Disclosures for Inventory
Assertions about Classes of Transactions and Events:
 • Occurrence. Inventory transactions and events are valid.
 • Completeness. All inventory transactions and events have been recorded.
 • Authorization. All inventory transactions and events are properly authorized.
 • Accuracy. Inventory transactions have been properly computed and recorded.
 • Cutoff. Inventory receipts and shipments are recorded in the correct accounting period.
 • Classification. Inventory is recorded in the proper accounts (e.g., raw materials, work in process, or finished goods).
Assertions about Account Balances at the Period End:
 • Existence. Inventory recorded on the books and records actually exists.
 • Rights and obligations. The entity has the legal right (i.e., ownership) to the recorded inventory.
 • Completeness. All inventory is recorded.
 • Valuation and allocation. Inventory is properly recorded in accordance with GAAP (e.g., lower of cost or market).
Assertions about Presentation and Disclosure:
 • Occurrence and rights and obligations. All disclosed events, transactions, and other matters relating to inventory 
have occurred and pertain to the entity.
 • Completeness. All disclosures relating to inventory that should have been included in the financial statements have 
been included.
 • Classification and understandability. Financial information relating to inventory is appropriately presented and 
described, and disclosures are clearly expressed.
 • Accuracy and valuation. Financial and other information relating to inventory are disclosed fairly and in 
appropriate amounts.

Practice 
INSIGHT
Many companies rely on spreadsheets to reconcile accounts and to derive and support final inven­
tory balances that are recorded in the general ledger and financial statements. Companies indicate 
that they are reluctant to automate processes because they are not convinced that software exists to 
meet their company’s specific needs. Spreadsheets may include complex calculations with multiple-
linked supporting spreadsheets. The importance of the integrity and reliability of the information 
generated by such spreadsheets increases as the complexity increases from low to high and as 
usage increases. Every year it seems there is a news article about large spreadsheet errors. The 
auditor should evaluate the controls over the inventory spreadsheets. Because spreadsheets can be 
generated by multiple users, can be easily changed, and may lack appropriate controls, the use of 
spreadsheets can increase inherent risk of misstatement.

464	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Substantive analytical procedures are useful audit tests for examining the reasonableness of 
inventory and cost of goods sold. When performed as part of audit planning, preliminary 
analytical procedures can effectively identify whether the inventory and cost of goods sold 
accounts contain material misstatements. Final analytical procedures are useful as an over­
all review for inventory and related accounts to identify obsolete, slow-moving, and excess 
inventory. Substantive analytical procedures are useful for obtaining assurance on the valua­
tion assertion for inventory. Such procedures can also identify problems with improper inclu­
sion or exclusion of costs in overhead.
For example, inventory turnover (cost of goods sold ÷ inventory) can be compared over 
time or to the industry average.

The pattern above of a significant increase in inventory coupled with substantially slower 
inventory turnover may indicate the presence of slow-moving or obsolete inventory. The 
auditor would seek an explanation for the pattern from the entity and the auditor may need 
to revise the audit plan for the physical inventory observation and detail testing over the 
inventory valuation assertion (inventory observation and detail testing are discussed later in 
the chapter).
Another common analytical procedure involves the gross profit percentages. The gross 
profit percentage can also be compared to previous years’ or industry data and may provide 
valuable evidence on unrecorded inventory (an understatement) or fictitious inventory (an 
overstatement). This ratio may also provide information on the proper valuation of inventory. 
For example, a small or negative gross profit margin may indicate issues related to the lower-
of-cost-or-market valuation of inventory. It is important that the auditor use sufficiently dis­
aggregated analytical procedures in order to identify unusual patterns like the one illustrated 
in Figure 5–8, in Chapter 5. Table 13–7 lists examples of substantive analytical procedures 
that are useful in auditing inventory and related accounts at either the planning stage or as an 
overall review.
Prior to presenting the tests of account balances for inventory, this chapter discusses two 
significant audit procedures: auditing standard costs and observing physical inventory.

Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process	
465
Many manufacturing entities use a standard cost system to measure performance and to value 
inventory. If a standard cost system is integrated with the general accounting records, cost 
accumulation and variance reports are direct outputs of the entity’s inventory-accounting 
system.
For accuracy and proper valuation, standard costs should approximate actual costs. To 
test the standard costs, the auditor should first review the entity’s policies and procedures 
for constructing standard costs. Once the policies and procedures are understood, the audi­
tor normally tests the component cost buildup for a representative sample of standard prod­
uct costs.
Three components make up the cost of producing a product: materials, labor, and over­
head. For discussion purposes, suppose that Calabro Wireless Services assembles five types 
of wireless devices. Recall that Calabro is a business services company that uses wireless 
communications technology to develop solutions for businesses (Calabro company back­
ground is provided in Chapter 8). Assume further that all parts used in the devices are pur­
chased from outside vendors. The process followed in auditing the three components that 
make up the standard costs for a type of device follows. (Similar auditing techniques would be 
used for other entities with production processes.)
Materials
Determining the materials costs requires examining the quantity and type of materials 
included in the product and the price of the materials. The quantity and type of materials are 
tested by reviewing the engineering specifications for the product. For example, in the case 
of wireless devices, the auditor can obtain a set of engineering specifications that includes a 
blueprint and a list of materials needed to manufacture a particular device. The auditor can 
compare the list of materials with the standard cost documentation used to support the cost 
accumulation. The prices used on the standard cost documentation can be traced to vendors’ 
invoices as a test of actual costs.
Labor
The determination of labor costs requires evidence about the type and amount of labor needed 
for production and the labor rate. Following our example, the amount of labor necessary to 
assemble a wireless device can be determined by reviewing engineering estimates, which 
may be based on time-and-motion studies or on historical information. The labor rates for 
each type of labor necessary to assemble a device can be tested by examining a schedule 
of authorized wages. Labor costs included in inventory are often tested in conjunction with 
payroll expense.
Overhead
The auditor gathers evidence regarding overhead costs by reviewing the entity’s method of 
overhead allocation for reasonableness, compliance with GAAP, and consistency. The audi­
tor can examine the costs included in overhead to be sure that such costs can appropriately be 
assigned to the product. The inclusion or exclusion of such costs should be consistent from 
one period to the next. Using the wireless device example, the auditor would obtain a listing 
of expense accounts used to make up the overhead pool of costs. The auditor can compare 
the actual costs for the period to the budgeted costs. The auditor can also compare the costs 
included in the current year’s listing with those in the prior year’s listing.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The auditor’s observation of inventory is a generally accepted auditing procedure. However, 
the auditor is not required to observe all inventory, but only inventory that is material. Inter­
nal auditors may also observe the physical inventory. The primary reason for observing the 
entity’s physical inventory is to establish the existence of the inventory. The observation of 
the physical inventory also provides evidence on the accuracy, rights and obligations, and 
valuation assertions. Based on the physical inventory count, the entity compiles the physical 
inventory. While the form of compilation may differ among entities, it normally contains a list 
of the items by type and quantity, the assigned cost for each item, the inventory value for each 
item, and a total for the inventory.
Prior to the physical count of inventory, the auditor should be familiar with the inventory 
locations, the major items in inventory, and the entity’s inventory management processes and 
instructions for counting inventory. During the observation of the physical inventory count, 
the auditor should do the following:
	
∙	 Ensure that no production is scheduled. If production is scheduled, ensure that proper 
controls are established for movement between departments in order to prevent 
double counting.
	
∙	 Ensure that there is no movement of goods during the inventory count. If movement 
is necessary, the auditor and entity personnel must ensure that the goods are not 
double counted and that all goods are counted.
	
∙	 Make sure that the entity’s count teams are following the inventory count instructions. 
If the count teams are not following the instructions, the auditor should notify the 
entity representative in charge of the area.
	
∙	 Ensure that inventory tags are issued sequentially to individual departments. For many 
inventory counts, the goods are marked with multicopy inventory tags. The count 
teams record the type and quantity of inventory on each tag, and one copy of each tag 
is then used to compile the inventory. If the entity uses another method of counting 
inventory, such as detailed inventory listings or handheld computers, the auditor 
should obtain copies of the listings or files prior to the start of the inventory count.
	
∙	 Perform test counts and record a sample of counts in the working papers. This 
information will be used to evaluate the accuracy and completeness of the entity’s 
inventory compilation.
	
∙	 Obtain tag control information for testing the entity’s inventory compilation. Tag 
control information includes documentation of the numerical sequence of all 
inventory tags and accounting for all used and unused inventory tags. If inventory 
listings are used by the entity, copies of the listings will accomplish the objective of 
documenting the entire inventory count.
	
∙	 Obtain cutoff information, including the number of the last shipping and receiving 
documents issued on the date of the physical inventory count.
	
∙	 Observe the condition of the inventory for items that may be obsolete, slow-moving, 
or carried in excess quantities.
	
∙	 Inquire about goods held on consignment for others or held on a “bill-and-hold” 
basis. The auditor must inquire about goods held on consignment (for sale by others) 
on behalf of the entity. These goods should be included in the inventory count. In 
some industries, goods are sold on a “bill-and-hold” basis. In cases where revenue 
recognition requirements are properly met for bill-and-hold sales (i.e., there is a 
substantial and legitimate business purpose), the goods are treated as a sale, but the 
entity holds the goods until the customer needs them. The bill-and-hold items should 
be segregated and not included in the entity’s inventory. 
If these audit procedures are followed, the auditor has reasonable assurance that a proper 
inventory count has been taken.

Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process

Some companies choose to count their inventory on a cyclical basis throughout the year 
instead of just once at the end of the year. They may choose to only count part of the ware­
house each cycle and ensure that the entire warehouse is counted at least once each year. If 
the auditor observes one or more of these interim cycle counts, the entity must have a reliable 
perpetual inventory system so that the auditor can examine activity (on a test basis) between 
the count date(s) and year-end in order to obtain appropriate evidence about the year-end 
inventory balance.
Practice 
INSIGHT
One of the most effective ways for the auditor to evaluate the possibility of inventory fraud is to 
physically examine the entity’s inventory when an inventory count is being performed. But even 
physical examination procedures do not eliminate the risk of misstatement due to fraud, since the 
entity can perpetrate fraud such as
 • obtaining advance notice of the timing and location of the count, which can permit the entity to 
conceal fictitious inventory at locations not visited;
 • stacking empty containers at a warehouse where container contents are not checked during the 
count;
 • falsifying shipping documents to show that inventory is in transit from one company location to 
another; and
 • falsifying documents to show that inventory is located at a public warehouse or other location not 
controlled by the company.
If the auditor does not properly maintain control of a copy of the entity’s final count sheets to tie into 
final inventory records, the entity can also fraudulently overstate inventory by
 • following the auditor during the count and adding fictitious inventory to items not tested by the 
auditor or
 • entering additional quantities on manual and/or electronic inventory sheets that do not exist or 
adding a digit in front of the actual count.
Tests of Details of Classes of Transactions, 
Account Balances, and Disclosures
Table 13–6 presents the assertions for inventory. The intended purpose of substantive tests 
of transactions is to detect monetary misstatements in the inventory account. The auditor 
may conduct substantive tests of transactions specifically for inventory. However, because the 
inventory management process interacts with the revenue, purchasing, and human resource 
management processes, transactions involving the receipt of goods, shipment of goods, and 
assignment of labor costs are normally tested as part of those processes. For example, receiv­
ing department personnel prepare a receiving report that includes the quantity and type of 
goods received. The receiving report and vendor invoice are then used to record the accounts 
payable. If the auditor intends to obtain substantive evidence on the perpetual inventory 
records, the tests of receipt and shipment of goods can be extended by tracing the transactions 
into the perpetual inventory records. For example, the receiving report is generally used by 
the entity to record the goods in the perpetual inventory records or inventory master file (see 
Figure 13–2). The auditor can perform a substantive test of transactions by tracing a sample 
of receiving reports into the perpetual inventory records. Labor costs can also be traced to 
individual inventory transactions and into the cost-accounting records.
As previously mentioned, substantive tests of transactions are often conducted in con­
junction with tests of controls. Table 13–8 presents examples of tests of transactions, account 
balances, and disclosures for assertions related to inventory. The discussion that follows 
focuses primarily on tests of details of account balances of inventory. Accuracy is the first 
assertion discussed because the auditor must establish that the detailed records that support 
the inventory account agree with the general ledger account.

*Many of these substantive tests of transactions are commonly conducted as dual-purpose tests (i.e., in conjunction with tests of controls).
T A B L E  1 3 – 8 
Accuracy
Gathering evidence on the accuracy of inventory requires obtaining a copy of the compilation 
of the physical inventory that shows inventory quantities and prices.
The inventory compilation is footed, and the mathematical extensions of quantity multi­
plied by price are verified. Additionally, test counts made by the auditor during the physical 
inventory and tag control information are traced into the compilation.
Many times the entity has adjusted the general ledger inventory balance to agree to the 
physical inventory amounts (referred to as book-to-physical adjustment) before the auditor 
begins the substantive tests of account balances. If the entity has made the book-to-physical 
adjustment, the totals from the compilation for inventory should agree with the general ledger.
When the entity maintains a perpetual inventory system, the totals from the inventory 
compilation should also be agreed to these records. The auditor can use computer-assisted 
audit techniques to accomplish these audit steps. For example, the auditor can use a generalized 

	
Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process	
469
or custom audit software package to trace costs used to price goods in the inventory compila­
tion to standard cost files. The extensions and footing can also be tested at the same time.
Cutoff
In gathering evidence on the cutoff assertion for inventory, the auditor attempts to determine 
whether all sales of finished goods and purchases of raw materials are recorded in the proper 
period. For sales cutoff, the auditor can examine a sample of shipping documents for a few 
days before and after year-end for recording of inventory shipments in the proper period. For 
purchases cutoff, the auditor can examine a sample of receiving documents for a few days 
before and after year-end for recording of inventory purchases in the proper period. Chapters 10 
and 11 discuss sales and purchases cutoff.
Existence
Existence is one of the more important assertions for the inventory account. The observation 
of the physical inventory is the primary audit step used to verify this assertion. The auditor 
obtains information regarding existence by observing inventory items in the entity’s ware­
house and understanding and testing the entity’s count procedures addressing validity, and 
through the auditor’s test counts. If the auditor is satisfied with the entity’s physical inventory 
count, the auditor has sufficient, appropriate evidence on the existence of recorded inventory.
Completeness
The auditor must determine whether all inventory has been included in the inventory com­
pilation and the general ledger inventory account. The tests related to the observation of the 
physical inventory count provide assurance that all goods on hand are included in inventory. 
Observing that count teams have placed count tags on all inventory items provides evidence 
regarding completeness of the count. Tracing test counts and tag control information into the 
inventory compilation provide assurance that the inventory counted during the physical inven­
tory observation is included in the compilation. In some cases, inventory is held on consign­
ment by others or is stored in public warehouses. The auditor normally confirms or physically 
observes such inventory.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Auditors should investigate significant differences between the physical count and detailed per­
petual inventory records before the accounting and inventory records are adjusted to match the 
physical count. Understanding the nature of the significant difference may indicate problems with 
either the physical count, the perpetual system, or shrinkage (unaccounted reduction in inventory 
due to theft or damage).
Rights and Obligations
The auditor must determine whether the recorded inventory is actually owned by the entity. 
Two issues related to ownership can arise. First, the auditor must be sure that the inventory 
on hand belongs to the entity. If the entity holds inventory on consignment, such inventory 
should not be included in the physical inventory. Second, for goods sold on a “bill-and-hold” 
basis, the auditor must be certain that such goods are segregated and not counted at the time 
of the physical inventory (again assuming revenue recognition requirements are properly met 
for bill-and-hold sales).
Valuation and Allocation
A number of important valuation issues are related to inventory. The first issue relates to the 
costs used to value the inventory items included in the compilation. When an entity, such as 
EarthWear, purchases inventory, valuation of the inventory can normally be accomplished 

470	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
by vouching the costs to vendors’ invoices. When the entity uses standard costs, the audi­
tor audits the standard costs as discussed previously. The second valuation issue relates to 
the lower-of-cost-or-market tests for inventory. The auditor normally performs such tests on 
large-dollar items or on the entity’s various product lines. At EarthWear, the auditors would 
likely perform the lower-of-cost-or-market test on merchandise noted by management for liq­
uidation. A third valuation issue relates to obsolete, slow-moving, or excess inventory. Inven­
tory management personnel should periodically review inventory on hand for slow-moving, 
excess inventory or inventory that is obsolete. Such inventory should be written down to its 
fair market value. The auditor can review the entity’s procedures for identifying obsolete, 
slow-moving, or excess inventory. EarthWear’s design department closely monitors its prod­
ucts to identify any end-of-season merchandise or overstocks, which are then sold at liquida­
tion prices through special catalog inserts. The auditor should ask management about their 
procedures to identify obsolete, slow-moving, or excess inventory, and if it is determined 
that such inventory exists the auditor should determine whether the inventory has been prop­
erly written down. Finally, the auditor should investigate any large adjustments between the 
amount of inventory shown in the general ledger account and the amount determined from the 
physical inventory count (book-to-physical adjustments) for possible misstatements. Potential 
reasons for book-to-physical differences include unreported spoilage, cutoff errors, and theft.
Classification and Understandability
The presentation and disclosure assertion of classification of inventory for EarthWear  is not an 
issue because the company sells only finished products. However, in a manufacturing company, 
the auditor must determine that inventory is properly classified as raw materials, work in pro­
cess, or finished goods. In most manufacturing companies, proper classification can be achieved 
by determining which manufacturing processing department has control of the inventory on the 
date of the physical count. For example, if inventory tags are used to count inventory and they 
are assigned numerically to departments, classification can be verified at the physical inventory. 
The auditor can ensure that each department is using the assigned tags. The tag control informa­
tion by department can be compared to the information on the inventory compilation to ensure 
that it is properly classified among raw materials, work in process, and finished goods.
Other Presentation and Disclosure Assertions
Several important disclosure issues are related to inventory. Table 13–9 presents some exam­
ples of disclosure items for inventory and related accounts. For example, management must 
disclose the cost method, such as LIFO or FIFO, used to value inventory. Management must 
also disclose the components (raw materials, work in process, and finished goods) of inven­
tory either on the face of the balance sheet or in the footnotes. Finally, if the entity uses LIFO 
to value inventory and there is a material LIFO liquidation, footnote disclosure is normally 
required (FASB ASC 330).
Exhibit 13–4 presents EarthWear’s financial statement disclosure for inventory. Note that 
the company uses LIFO to value inventory, and it discloses the approximate inventory value 
if FIFO had been used.
Examples of Disclosure Items for Inventory and Related Accounts

Long-term purchase contracts
Consigned inventory
Purchases from related parties
LIFO liquidations

Chapter 13    Auditing the Inventory Management Process

When the auditor has completed the planned substantive tests of the inventory account, all the 
identified misstatements should be aggregated. The likely misstatement is compared to the 
tolerable misstatement allocated to the inventory account. If the likely misstatement is less 
than the tolerable misstatement, the auditor may accept the inventory account as fairly pre­
sented. Conversely, if the likely misstatement exceeds the tolerable misstatement, the auditor 
should conclude that the inventory account is not fairly presented.
For example, in Chapter 3, tolerable misstatement was $900,000. Exhibit 3–3 showed 
that Willis & Adams detected two misstatements in inventory: one that resulted in an over­
statement of inventory by $312,500 based on a projection of a sample and one misstate­
ment that understated inventory by $227,450 due to inventory in transit. Because neither of 
these misstatements is greater than the tolerable misstatement, Willis & Adams can conclude 
that the audit evidence supports fair presentation. However, if these misstatements, either 
individually or in aggregate, had been greater than the tolerable misstatement, the evidence 
would not support fair presentation. In this case the auditor would have two choices: adjust 
the accounts to reduce the misstatement to an amount less than the tolerable misstatement or 
qualify the audit report.
The auditor should again analyze the misstatements discovered through the application 
of substantive procedures, because these misstatements may provide additional evidence on 
the control risk for the inventory management process. If the auditor concludes that the audit 
risk is unacceptably high, additional audit procedures should be performed, or the auditor 
must be satisfied that the entity has adjusted the related financial statement accounts to an 
acceptable level.
LO 13-13
EarthWear’s Financial Statement Disclosure for Inventory
Inventory is stated at the last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost, which is lower than market. If the first-in, first-
out method of accounting for inventory had been used, inventory would have been approximately 
$10.8 million and $13.6 million higher than reported at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

A large firm PCAOB inspection report identified audit deficiencies in the work performed on inven­
tory. The auditor failed to sufficiently test the valuation and existence assertions related to the issuer’s 
inventory balance. The audit deficiency included failing to test key inputs used in calculating LIFO, 
failing to perform inventory price testing, and failing to test key assumptions used to calculate the 
inventory obsolescence reserve (www.pcaob.org).

13-28	 Rasch is the partner-in-charge of the audit of Bonner Distributing Corporation, a 
	
13-11, 13-12	
	 wholesaler that owns one warehouse containing 80 percent of its inventory. Rasch 
is reviewing the working papers that were prepared to support the firm’s opinion on 
Bonner’s financial statements, and Rasch wants to be certain that essential audit tests 
are well documented.
Required:
	
1.	 What evidence should Rasch find in the working papers to support the fact that the 
audit was adequately planned and the assistants were properly supervised?
	
2.	 What substantive tests should Rasch expect to find in the working papers to docu­
ment management’s assertion about completeness as it relates to the inventory 
quantities at the end of the year?

LO 13-11	
13-29	 Abbott Corporation does not conduct a complete annual physical count of purchased 
parts and supplies in its principal warehouse but instead uses statistical sampling to 
estimate the year-end inventory. Abbott maintains a perpetual inventory record of 
parts and supplies and believes that statistical sampling is highly effective in deter­
mining inventory values and is sufficiently reliable to make a physical count of each 
item of inventory unnecessary.
Required:
	
a.	 Identify the audit procedures that should be used by the independent auditor that 
change, or are in addition to, normal required audit procedures when an entity 
utilizes statistical sampling to determine inventory value and does not conduct a 
100 percent annual physical count of inventory items.
	
b.	 List at least 10 normal audit procedures that should be performed to verify physi­
cal quantities whenever an entity conducts a periodic physical count of all, or 
part, of its inventory.

DISCUSSION CASE
	
LO 13-9, 13-11, 	
13-33	 Ando Company, a diversified manufacturer, has six divisions that operate throughout 
	
13-12, 13-13 	
	 the United States and Puerto Rico. Ando has historically allowed its divisions to 
operate autonomously. Ando does not have an internal audit department and cor­
porate intervention occurs only when planned results were not obtained. Ando has 
a policy of hiring competent people. Management is fairly conservative in terms of 
accounting principles and practices, but employee compensation depends on in large 
part on performance.
	
	
	 	
JP Kumar is the general manager of the Appliance Division that produces a vari­
ety of appliances. Kumar has been able to improve profitability of the division each 
of the prior 5 years. Much of the improvement came through cost cutting, including 
a substantial reduction in control activities over inventory. Recently a new competi­
tor has entered the market and has offered substantial price discounts in an effort to 
grab market share. Kumar is concerned because if profitability is not maintained, his 
bonus will be reduced.
	
	
	 	
Kumar decided that the easiest way to make the Appliance Division appear more 
profitable was through manipulating the inventory, which was the largest asset on 
the books. Kumar found that by increasing inventory by 4 percent, income could be 
increased by 8 percent. With the weakness in inventory control, he felt it would be easy 
to overstate inventory. Employees count the goods using count sheets, and Kumar was 
able to add two fictitious sheets during the physical inventory, even though the audi­
tors were present and were observing the inventory. A significant amount of inventory 
was stored in racks that filled the warehouse. Because of their height and the diffi­
culty of test-counting them, Kumar was able to cover an overstatement of inventory in 
the upper racks.
	
	
	 	
After the count was completed, Kumar added four additional count sheets that 
added $950,000, or 8.6 percent, to the stated inventory. Kumar notified the auditors 
of the “omission” of the sheets and convinced them that they represented overlooked 
legitimate inventory.
	
	
	 	
The auditors traced the items on these additional sheets to purchase invoices 
to verify their existence and approved the addition of the $950,000 to the inven­
tory. They did not notify management about the added sheets. In addition, Kumar

his chapter examines the audit of selected asset accounts. Three cat­
egories of asset accounts—prepaid expenses, intangibles, and property, 
plant, and equipment—are used as examples. While the audit approach 
taken for each category is similar, differences exist between these three cat­
egories of asset accounts. For example, while transactions for all three catego­
ries are subject to the control activities in the purchasing process, transactions 
involving intangible assets or property, plant, and equipment are likely to be 
subject to additional control activities because of their complexity or material­
ity. Additionally, prepaid expenses are normally classified as current assets, 
while intangibles and property, plant, and equipment are classified as noncur­
rent assets.

Major Phases of an Audit

482	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
For many entities, accounts receivable and inventory represent the major current assets 
included in the financial statements. Also included in most financial statements are accounts 
that are referred to as other assets. When such assets provide economic benefit for less than a 
year, they are classified as current assets. A common type of other asset is a prepaid expense. 
Examples of prepaid expenses include
	
∙	 Prepaid insurance.
	
∙	 Prepaid rent.
	
∙	 Prepaid interest.
One major difference between asset accounts such as accounts receivable or inventory 
and prepaid expenses is the materiality of the account balances. On many engagements, pre­
paid expenses, deferred charges, and intangible assets are not highly material. As a result, 
substantive analytical procedures are often used to verify these account balances.
LO 14-1
Auditing Prepaid Expenses
Inherent Risk Assessment—Prepaid Expenses
The inherent risk for prepaid expenses such as prepaid insurance would generally be assessed 
as low because these accounts do not involve any complex or contentious accounting issues. 
Moreover, misstatements that may have been detected in prior audits would generally be 
immaterial in amount.
Control Risk Assessment—Prepaid Expenses
Prepaid expenses are typically processed through the purchasing process. Common prepaid 
expenses include prepaid insurance, prepaid rent, prepaid maintenance or other service, and 
prepaid interest. The remaining discussion focuses on the prepaid insurance account as an 
illustration of auditing prepaid expenses because it is encountered on virtually all engage­
ments. Prepaid insurance may relate to an insurance policy on a building or equipment. If, for 
example, the entity borrowed money to purchase equipment, the creditor may have a lien on 
the equipment (i.e., the equipment is used as collateral for the loan). A lien gives the credi­
tor the right to sell the equipment if the entity fails to meet the obligations of a loan contract. 
When there is a lien on an entity’s building or equipment, the creditor typically requires the 
entity to carry an insurance policy listing the creditor as the beneficiary (i.e., rightful recipient 
of insurance proceeds).
Part of the auditor’s assessment of control risk for prepaid insurance transactions is based 
on the effectiveness of the control activities in the purchasing process. For example, the con­
trol activities in the purchasing process should ensure that new insurance policies are properly 
authorized and recorded.
Additional control activities may be used to control insurance transactions and informa­
tion. For example, an insurance register may be maintained as a separate record of all insur­
ance policies in force. The insurance register contains important information such as the 
coverage and expiration date of each policy. This register should be reviewed periodically 
by an independent person to verify that the entity has insurance coverage consistent with 
its needs.
The entity also needs to maintain controls over the systematic allocation of prepaid insur­
ance to insurance expense. At the end of each month, entity personnel should prepare a journal 
entry to recognize the expired portion of prepaid insurance. In some cases, entities use esti­
mated amounts when recording these journal entries during the year. At the end of the year, 
the prepaid insurance account is adjusted to reflect the actual amount of unexpired insurance.

	
Chapter 14    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Various Asset Accounts	
483
On many audits the auditor can gather sufficient, appropriate evidence on prepaid insur­
ance by performing substantive analytical procedures. Substantive tests of transactions, if 
performed at all, are conducted as part of testing the purchasing process. Detailed tests of 
balances of the prepaid insurance balance are typically necessary only when misstatements 
are expected.
Substantive Analytical Procedures for Prepaid Insurance
Because there are generally few transactions in the prepaid insurance account and because the 
amount reported in the financial statements for prepaid insurance is usually immaterial, sub­
stantive analytical procedures are effective for verifying the account balance. The following 
substantive analytical procedures are commonly used to test prepaid insurance:
	
∙	 Compare the current-year balance in prepaid insurance and insurance expense with 
the prior years’ balances, taking into account any changes in operations.
	
∙	 Compute the ratio of insurance expense to assets or sales and compare it with the 
prior years’ ratios.
	
∙	 Compute an estimate of the ending prepaid account balance(s) using the current 
premium and the amount of time remaining on the policy at the end of the period.
Stop and Think: Using the third technique above, do the ending balances in Exhibit 14–1 
appear reasonable?
Applying the third substantive analytical technique listed above to the Fire & Casualty 
policy, the ending balance of $8,400 appears reasonable ($8,400 = $33,600 × 3/12).

Analysis of Prepaid Insurance
12/31/15

484	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Tests of Details of the Prepaid Insurance
Tests of details of balances for prepaid insurance and insurance expense may be necessary 
when the auditor suspects misstatements based on prior years’ audits or when substantive 
analytical procedures indicate that the account balance may be misstated. The auditor begins 
testing the prepaid insurance account balance by obtaining a schedule from the entity that 
contains a detailed analysis of the policies included in the prepaid insurance account.
Exhibit 14–1 presents a prepaid insurance schedule for EarthWear Clothiers. The accu­
racy and completeness of this schedule are tested by footing it and tracing the ending bal­
ance to the prepaid insurance account in the general ledger. The auditor’s work then focuses 
on testing the existence, completeness, rights and obligations, valuation, and disclosure-
classification assertions. No footnote disclosures are generally necessary for prepaid insur­
ance. These steps, along with other audit work, are documented in Exhibit 14–1.
Existence and Completeness
The auditor can test the existence and completeness of insurance policies included in the 
account analysis by sending a confirmation to the entity’s insurance brokers, requesting infor­
mation on each policy’s number, coverage, expiration date, and premiums. This is an effective 
and efficient way of obtaining evidence on these two assertions. An alternative approach is 
examination of the underlying supporting documents such as the insurance bills and poli­
cies. The auditor can also obtain evidence regarding completeness by comparing the detailed 
policies in the current year’s insurance register with the policies included in the prior year’s 
insurance register.
Rights and Obligations
The beneficiary of the policy can be identified by requesting such information on the con­
firmations sent to the insurance brokers or by examining the insurance policies. If the ben­
eficiary is someone other than the entity, this could indicate an unrecorded liability or that 
another party has a claim against the insured assets.
Valuation
The auditor is concerned with whether the unexpired portion of prepaid insurance, and thus 
insurance expense, is properly valued. Evidence regarding proper valuation can be easily 
obtained by recomputing the unexpired portion of insurance after considering the premium 
paid and the term of the policy. By verifying the unexpired portion of prepaid insurance, the 
auditor also verifies the total amount of insurance expense. This is shown in Exhibit 14–1.
Classification
The auditor’s concern with classification is that the different types of insurance are properly 
allocated to the various insurance expense accounts. Normally, an examination of the insurance 
policy’s coverage indicates the nature of the insurance. For example, a fire insurance policy on 
the main manufacturing and administrative facilities should be charged both to the manufactur­
ing overhead insurance expense account and to the general and administrative insurance expense 
account. Note in Exhibit 14–1 that the various insurance accounts included in the general ledger 
are reconciled to total insurance expense. One final procedure that the auditor should perform 
is to ask the entity or its insurance broker about the adequacy of the entity’s insurance coverage.
Auditing Intangible Assets
Intangible assets are assets that provide economic benefit for longer than a year but lack physical 
substance. The following list includes examples of six general categories of intangible assets:
	
1.	 Marketing— trademark, brand name, and Internet domain names.
LO 14-3

	
Chapter 14    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Various Asset Accounts	
485
Inherent Risk Assessment—Intangible Assets
The nature of the judgments involved in accounting for intangible assets raises serious inherent 
risk considerations. The accounting rules are complex and the transactions are difficult to audit.
Stop and Think: If EarthWear were to acquire another successful clothing company and 
record goodwill as part of the purchase, how would this change your audit plan and why?
Judgment is required to initially value assets such as trademarks, customer relations, copy­
rights, customer order backlogs (i.e., backlogs represent expected future revenue), and good­
will when one company acquires another. Both the entity and the auditor often use valuation 
specialists to assist in determining fair values. Considerable judgment is also required to deter­
mine useful lives for patents, copyrights, and order backlogs. Finally, testing asset impairment 
and determining the amount of impairment loss are complex procedures that involve judg­
ment and estimation. Accounting standards (FASB ASC Topic 350) provide the option of 
using a quantitative or qualitative impairment test annually. The quantitative test involves 
similar computations as those used to determine fair value. However, the quantitative assess­
ment is not necessary unless a qualitative assessment indicates that an asset is more likely 
than not impaired. In doing the qualitative assessment, the entity considers factors such as
	
∙	 Declining trends in revenues, earnings, or cash flows used to value the intangible asset.
	
∙	 Cost increases that could negatively affect future cash flows used to value the asset.
	
∙	 Legal, regulatory, political, business, industry, competition, demand or other factors 
that could negatively affect inputs used to value the asset.
	
∙	 Other events such as general economic downturns or changes in management, 
contemplation of bankruptcy, or litigation that could negatively affect inputs used to 
value the asset.
	
2.	 Customer—customer lists, order backlogs, and customer relationships.
	
3.	 Artistic—items protected by copyright.
	
4.	 Contract—licenses, franchises, and broadcast rights.
	
5.	 Technology—patented and unpatented technology.
	
6.	 Goodwill—the difference between the acquisition price for a company and the fair 
values of the identified tangible and intangible assets.
Accounting standards do not allow companies to record internally generated intangibles as 
assets on the balance sheet. Rather, intangibles are recorded when the assets are acquired 
through a purchase or acquisition (FASB ASC Topic 350).1
Some intangible assets are amortized over time, while others like broadcast licenses, 
trademarks, and goodwill are considered to have indefinite lives and are not amortized. How­
ever, all intangibles must be tested for impairment at least annually, as well as on an interim 
basis. If the test indicates that there has been a decline in the remaining market value of an 
intangible asset below its net recorded or carrying amount, the asset has been impaired and an 
impairment expense is recognized in the current period.
1There are some notable exceptions to the general rule that internally generated intangibles are expensed. For exam-
ple, once internally developed software has reached the technological feasibility stage, FASB ASC Topic 985 pro-
vides separate and specific accounting provisions that allow capitalization of further development costs. Also, legal 
and administrative fees associated with obtaining a trademark, copyright, or patent can be capitalized. Further discus-
sion of these exceptions is beyond the scope of this book.

operations to be reported as a separate line item before income from continuing operations. Notice 
that in order to properly audit an entity’s impairment testing, the auditor needs expertise in both evi­
dence evaluation and in financial reporting requirements.
Control Risk Assessment—Intangible Assets
Management is responsible for making the fair value measurements and disclosures and 
therefore must establish an accounting and reporting process for determining the fair value 
measures, selecting the appropriate valuation methods, identifying and supporting significant 
assumptions used, and preparing the valuation and disclosures in accordance with GAAP.
Intangible asset transactions and initial valuation are typically processed through the 
entity’s business acquisition processes. To rely on controls in this process, the auditor needs 
to understand, document, and test the design and operating effectiveness of key controls. For 
public companies that are actively acquiring other companies or that engage in large-scale 
acquisitions, the business acquisition process would be considered a significant process for 
the audit of internal controls over financial reporting (see Chapter 7). For example, the control 
activities in the business acquisition process should ensure that all identifiable asset catego­
ries are separately valued and that any valuation specialists used are qualified and objective.
Additional control activities are required for impairment testing. For example, the enti­
ty’s policies and procedures should properly capture and evaluate potential events that may 
trigger impairment (e.g., significant change in market price or in the way the asset is being 
used), ensure that all intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, and verify 
that the impairment-testing policies and procedures are in compliance with GAAP.
In assessing control risk, the auditor considers factors such as
	
∙	 The expertise and experience of those determining the fair value of the asset.
	
∙	 Controls over the process used to determine fair value measurements, including 
controls over data and segregation of duties between those committing the entity to 
the purchase and those undertaking the valuation.
	
∙	 The extent to which the entity engages or employs valuation specialists.
	
∙	 The significant management assumptions used in determining fair value.
	
∙	 The integrity of change controls and security procedures for valuation models and 
relevant information systems, including approval processes.
Substantive Procedures—Intangible Assets
Substantive Analytical Procedures for Intangible Assets
While analytical procedures help direct the auditor’s attention to situations needing additional 
investigation (e.g., potential asset impairment), unlike with prepaids, the principal substan­
tive evidence regarding intangible assets is typically obtained via tests of details. Substantive 
analytical procedures generally are not useful in gathering sufficient, appropriate evidence 
regarding the assertions of primary interest for intangibles (valuation, existence, complete­
ness, rights and obligations, and classification). As such, the discussion below is limited to 
substantive tests of details.
LO 14-4
Accounting standards require different asset impairment tests for different classes of intan­
gible assets (FASB ASC Topic 350). With the judgment and complexity associated with valu­
ation and impairment testing of intangible assets, the auditor is likely to assess the inherent 
risk of significant intangibles as high, particularly if the assets might be impaired.

	
Chapter 14    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Various Asset Accounts

Tests of Details of Intangible Assets
Tests of details associated with valuation and impairment of intangible assets are often nec­
essary because the complexity and degree of judgment increase the risk of material mis­
statement. Further, auditing standards require some substantive evidence for all significant 
accounts, and, as noted above, substantive analytical procedures are not likely to provide suf­
ficient, appropriate evidence for significant transactions involving intangible assets.
Existence and Completeness  The auditor normally tests for the existence of intangible 
assets at the time they are acquired. For assets such as patents, copyrights, licenses, broadcast 
rights, and trademarks, the auditor would examine legal documentation supporting the validity 
of the asset. Similarly, customer backlogs can be validated by examining customer order infor­
mation or by sending confirmations to customers requesting information on their order status.
The auditor’s primary concern relative to the completeness assertion for intangible assets 
is to ensure that the entity’s impairment-testing procedures include all intangible assets. To test 
this assertion, the auditor would obtain a copy of the entity’s detail listing of intangible assets, 
which should agree with the total amount of intangible assets reported on the entity’s balance 
sheet. The auditor would also examine the entity’s impairment documentation to ensure that 
each asset is subject to the appropriate impairment testing in accordance with GAAP.
Valuation2  It should be no surprise that valuation is the most important assertion associated 
with intangible assets. The initial valuation of assets typically involves an allocation of pur­
chase price in proportion to fair values. Once an intangible asset is determined to be impaired, 
the current fair value must be determined to compute the impairment loss. When there is a 
market price for the intangible assets, the valuation issues are relatively straightforward. How­
ever, in the majority of the situations involving valuation of intangible assets, a readily deter­
mined market price is not available. The Advanced Module to Chapter 16 covers four important 
areas in the auditing of fair value measurements provided in AU-C 540, Auditing Accounting 
Estimates, Including Fair Value Accounting Estimates and Related Disclosures.
Accounting standards describe different acceptable valuation methods, but if a market 
price is not available, all remaining methods rely heavily on assumptions, likelihood assess­
ments, and estimation. With the movement toward more fair value accounting, auditors need 
improved understanding of valuation issues. However, to obtain sufficient appropriate evi­
dence on the valuation of intangible assets (either for initial valuation or after an impairment), 
the auditor is not required to become an expert in valuation. Rather, the auditor will typically 
rely on the help of a valuation specialist. When specialists are used to obtain audit evidence, 
the auditor is required to evaluate the specialist’s qualifications and objectivity. The auditor 
also must determine if the valuation model used by the specialist is appropriate and consistent 
with GAAP, and the auditor must understand and verify the reasonableness of the underlying 
data and assumptions.
In addition to initial valuation and impairment testing, the auditor would also test the rea­
sonableness of the useful lives used for amortizing intangible assets that have definite lives. 
For example, even though a patent may have a legal life of 20 years, if the competitive advan­
tages associated with the patent are expected to last only five years, the patent cost should be 
amortized over a shorter useful life.

kit for Auditors, for detailed guidance on auditing fair value measurements required by FASB ASC Topic 350, 360.

INSIGHT
During a recent inspection of one of the Big 4 firms, the PCAOB identified deficiencies in the audit 
of intangible assets. There was no evidence that the audit firm evaluated whether goodwill should 
have been recorded. In this audit, the entity acquired another company and recorded substantial 
goodwill despite the fact that it discontinued the established business of the acquired company to 
start a new, unproven business (www.pcaob.org).

488	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Rights and Obligations  Litigation regarding the rights associated with intangible assets 
such as trademarks, patents, copyrights, licenses, and Internet domains is relatively common. 
The auditor normally examines supporting legal and contractual documentation to verify the 
entity’s legal rights to these assets. The auditor also reads the minutes of board of directors 
meetings and communicates with the entity’s counsel to determine if there is pending liti­
gation regarding legal rights (attorney’s letters are discussed in Chapter 17). As mentioned 
above, the auditor needs to understand and test the entity’s business acquisition processes as 
well as the entity’s allocation of purchase price to various intangible assets.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Recent examples of impairment losses recorded by public companies include:
 • Research In Motion, maker of the Blackberry phone, recognized an impairment of $335 million 
to write-down the entire carrying value of its goodwill in 2013 due to the competitive challenges 
to the company’s business and decline in the Company’s market value (Research In Motion 
Limited’s Form 40-F filed with the SEC March 2013).
 • Eastman Kodak Company reported a goodwill impairment of $626 million associated with its 
Film, Photofinishing, and Entertainment Group (Eastman Kodak’s Form 8-K filed with the SEC 
February 2011).
Classification  The auditor’s concern with classification is that the different types of intan­
gible assets are properly identified and are accounted for separately. As with the initial valua­
tion, the identification of intangible assets is typically performed at the time an entity acquires 
another business interest. Multiple intangible assets are typically acquired simultaneously in 
one purchase.
Auditing the Property Management Process
For most entities, property, plant, and equipment represent a material amount in the finan­
cial statements. When the audit is an ongoing engagement, the auditor is able to focus his 
or her efforts on the current year’s activity because the assets acquired in earlier years were 
subjected to audit procedures at the time of acquisition. However, on a new engagement the 
auditor has to verify the assets that make up the beginning balances in the entity’s property, 
plant, and equipment accounts.
The size of the entity may also affect the auditor’s approach. If the entity is relatively 
small with few asset purchases during the period, it is generally more cost-effective for the 
auditor to follow a substantive strategy. Following this strategy, the auditor conducts substan­
tive analytical procedures and direct tests of the account balances. Large entities, on the other 
hand, are likely to have formal procedures for budgeting for and purchasing capital assets. 
While routine purchases might be processed through the purchasing process, as described 
in Chapter 11, acquisition or construction of specialized assets may be subject to different 
requisition and authorization procedures. When a private entity has a formal control system 
over the property management process, the auditor may choose to follow a reliance strategy 
and test controls. When the entity is a public company, the entity should have a formal control 
system and the auditor will test the design and operating effectiveness of key controls as part 
of the integrated audit.
Types of Transactions
Four types of property, plant, and equipment transactions may occur:
	
∙	 Acquisition of capital assets for cash or nonmonetary considerations.
	
∙	 Disposition of capital assets through sale, exchange, retirement, or abandonment.
	
∙	 Depreciation of capital assets over their useful economic life.
	
∙	 Leasing of capital assets.

Overview of the Property Management Process
Larger entities generally use IT systems to process property, plant, and equipment transactions, 
maintain subsidiary records, and produce required reports. Figure 14–1 presents a flowchart 
of EarthWear’s accounting system for the property management process. Transactions are 
periodically entered both from the purchasing process and through direct input into the sys­
tem. The property, plant, and equipment master file is then updated, and a number of reports 
are produced. The periodic report for property, plant, and equipment transactions is reviewed 
for proper recording by the physical plant department. The property, plant, and equipment 
subsidiary ledger is a record of all capital assets owned by the entity. It contains information 
on the cost of the asset, the date acquired, the method of depreciation, and accumulated depre­
ciation. The subsidiary ledger also includes the calculation of depreciation expense for both 
financial statement and income tax purposes. The general ledger is posted to reflect the new 
property, plant, and equipment transactions and depreciation expense. The subsidiary ledger 
is reconciled to the general ledger control account monthly.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Misstatements Detected in Prior Audits
If the auditor has detected misstatements in prior audits, the assessment of inherent risk 
should be set higher than if few or no misstatements had been found in the past.3 For example, 
in prior years the auditor may have found numerous misstatements in the entity’s accumulat­
ing costs for valuing self-constructed capital assets. Unless the entity has established new 
control activities over cost accumulation, the auditor should also expect to find misstatements 
during the current year’s audit and therefore set inherent risk as high.
3Research has shown that property, plant, and equipment accounts frequently contain misstatements. See A. Eilifsen 
and W. F. Messier, Jr., “Auditor Detection of Misstatements: A Review and Integration of Empirical Research,”  
Journal of Accounting Literature 2000 (19), pp. 1–43, for a review of the audit research studies that have indicated 
that property, plant, and equipment accounts are likely to contain misstatements.
The assessment of inherent risk for the purchasing process provides a starting point for assess­
ing inherent risk for property, plant, and equipment. The following three inherent risk factors 
classified as operating characteristics require consideration by the auditor:
	
∙	 Complex accounting issues.
	
∙	 Difficult-to-audit transactions.
	
∙	 Misstatements detected in prior audits.
Complex Accounting Issues
A number of different types of property, plant, and equipment transactions involve com­
plex accounting issues. Lease accounting, self-constructed assets, and capitalized interest 
are examples of such issues. For example, in the case of a lease transaction the auditor must 
evaluate the entity’s decision either to capitalize the lease or to treat it as an operating lease. 
Because of the complexity of the capitalization decision and the subjectivity involved in 
assessing the capitalization criteria, it is not uncommon for such transactions to be accounted 
for incorrectly by the entity. For example, EarthWear leases store and office space accounted 
for as operating leases. Willis & Adams must be sure that these leases do not qualify as 
capital leases.
Difficult-to-Audit Transactions
The majority of additions to property, plant, and equipment are relatively easy to audit 
because they are purchased directly from vendors. For such purchases the auditor is able to 
obtain evidence for most assertions by examining the source documents. However, transac­
tions involving donated assets, nonmonetary exchanges, and self-constructed assets are often 
difficult to audit. For example, it may be difficult to verify the trade-in value of an asset 
exchanged or to properly audit the cost accumulation of self-constructed assets. The presence 
of these types of transactions should lead to a higher inherent risk assessment. It is certainly 
worth noting that one of the largest accounting frauds in history, WorldCom, involved the 
improper capitalization of operating expenses as property, plant, and equipment to overstate 
income. See Exhibit 14–2 for a more detailed description of the company, the fraud, and how 
the fraud was uncovered.
LO 14-7
Practice 
INSIGHT
One way to overstate the net carrying value of plant or equipment is to inappropriately extend the 
assets’ depreciable life. Waste Management used such an approach to fraudulently boost profits. 
Management has considerable latitude in choosing a depreciation method. Changes to either the 
useful lives or depreciation methods should be scrutinized for both their purpose and financial effect.

WorldCom Overstates PP&E and Net Income
WorldCom started as a mom-and-pop long-distance company in 1983. But in the 1990s, it matured into 
a powerhouse. In 1997 it shocked the industry with an unsolicited bid to take over MCI, a company more 
than three times its size. In 1998 CFO Magazine named WorldCom’s CFO, Scott Sullivan, one of the coun­
try’s best CFOs. At age 37 he was earning $19.3 million a year. In 1999 WorldCom founder Bernie Ebbers 
moved the company to Clinton, Mississippi, his old college town. The stock price went through the roof. 
However, by early 2001, overexuberance for the telecom market had created a glut of companies like 
WorldCom, and earnings started to fall.
In March 2002, Cynthia Cooper, a WorldCom vice president and head of internal audit, was informed 
by a worried executive in the wireless division that corporate accounting had taken $400 million out of 
his reserve account and used it to boost WorldCom’s income. When Cooper went to WorldCom’s external 
auditors, Arthur Andersen, to inquire about the maneuver, she was told matter-of-factly that it was not a 
problem. When she didn’t relent, Sullivan angrily told Cooper that everything was fine and she should 
back off. He was furious at her, according to a person involved in the matter. Says Cooper, “When some­
one is hostile, my instinct is to find out why.”
As the weeks went on, Cooper directed her team members to widen their net. Having watched the 
Enron implosion and Andersen’s role in it, she was worried they could not necessarily rely on the account­
ing firm’s audits. So the internal auditors decided to reaudit some areas. She and her team began working 
late into the night, keeping their project secret. In late May, Cooper and her group discovered a gaping 
hole in the books. In public reports, the company had classified billions of dollars as property, plant, and 
equipment in 2001, meaning the costs could be stretched out over a number of years into the future. How­
ever, these expenditures were for regular fees WorldCom paid to local telephone companies to complete 
calls and therefore were operating costs, which should be expensed in full each year. It was as if an ordi­
nary person had paid his or her phone bills but written down the payments as if he or she were building a 
long-term asset, like a phone tower, in his or her backyard. The trick allowed WorldCom to turn a loss into 
a $2.4 billion profit in 2001.
Internal audit began looking for ways to somehow justify what it had found in the books. Finally, the 
internal auditors confronted WorldCom’s controller, David Myers, who admitted the accounting could not 
be justified. Within days, the company fired its famed chief financial officer, Scott Sullivan, and told the 
world that it had inflated its profits by $3.8 billion. After additional investigation, the number grew to over 
$9 billion, the largest accounting fraud ever up to that date.

Control Risk Assessment—Property 
Management Process
Although auditors typically follow a substantive strategy when auditing the property manage­
ment process, an understanding of internal control is still required on all audits, and obviously 
AS5 also requires design evaluation and testing of operating effectiveness of key controls for 
significant account balances and processes for public companies. The presentation that fol­
lows focuses on the major assertions, key control activities, and tests of controls that relate 
directly to the property management process. Other control activities related to the property 
management process were discussed as part of the purchasing process. Important examples of 
segregation of duties are also presented.
Occurrence and Authorization
The control activities for the occurrence and authorization assertions are normally part of the 
purchasing process. Purchase requisitions are initiated in relevant departments and autho­
rized at the appropriate level within the entity. However, large capital asset transactions may 
be subject to control activities outside the purchasing process. For example, highly spe­
cialized technical equipment is likely to be purchased only after passing through a specific 
LO 14-8

492	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
capital-budgeting process, which might require that purchase of equipment meet predefined 
internal rate-of-return criteria. The purchase of equipment may also require that highly skilled 
engineers approve the technical specifications for the equipment. For such transactions, the 
auditor may need to examine more than the vendor’s invoice to test validity. A review of addi­
tional documentation, such as capital-budgeting documents and engineering specifications, 
may be needed.
Most entities have some type of authorization table based on the size of capital asset 
transactions. The entity should have control activities to ensure that the authorization to 
purchase capital assets is consistent with the authorization table. For example, the con­
trol activities should specify dollar limits at each managerial level to ensure that larger 
projects are brought to the attention of higher levels of management for approval before 
commitments are made. Lease transactions should be subject to similar control activities. 
The entity also needs to have control activities for authorizing the sale or other disposition 
of capital assets. This should include a level of authorization above the department initiat­
ing the disposition. Control activities should also identify assets that are no longer used 
in operations because they may require different accounting treatment. Finally, all major 
maintenance or improvement transactions should be properly authorized by an appropriate 
level of management.
Completeness
Most entities use software to maintain detailed electronic property records (see Figure 14–1). 
The property, plant, and equipment subsidiary ledger usually includes the following informa­
tion for each capital asset:
	
∙	 Description, location, and ID number.
	
∙	 Date of acquisition and installed cost.
	
∙	 Depreciation methods for book and tax purposes, salvage value, and estimated 
useful life.
The control activities used in the purchasing process for ensuring completeness provide 
some assurance that all capital asset transactions are recorded in the property, plant, and 
equipment subsidiary ledger and general ledger. One procedure that helps to ensure that this 
assertion is met is periodic reconciliation of the property, plant, and equipment subsidiary 
ledger to the general ledger control accounts. Figure 14–1 shows this control activity as it is 
performed by EarthWear’s physical plant department.
Another control activity that an entity may use to ensure that all capital assets are recorded 
is periodic comparison of the detailed records in the subsidiary ledger with the existing capi­
tal assets. This may be done in a number of ways. The entity may make a complete physical 
examination of property, plant, and equipment on a periodic or rotating basis and compare 
the physical assets to the property, plant, and equipment subsidiary ledger. Alternatively, the 
physical examination may be limited to major capital assets or assets that are subject to loss. 
In both instances the entity’s internal auditors may test the reliability of the subsidiary ledger. 
Larger entities sometimes employ outside specialists to physically examine property, plant, 
and equipment.
Segregation of Duties
The existence of adequate segregation of duties for the property management process depends 
on the volume and significance of the transactions processed. For example, if an entity pur­
chases large quantities of machinery and equipment, or if it has large capital projects under 
construction, it will likely have a formal control process. On the other hand, if an entity has 
few capital asset purchases, it will generally not have a formal control system over such trans­
actions. Table 14–1 shows the key segregation of duties for the property management process 
and examples of possible errors or fraud that can result from conflicts in duties.
LO 14-9

	
Chapter 14    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Various Asset Accounts	
493
As mentioned earlier, when the number of transactions is small, auditors often follow a sub­
stantive strategy when auditing property, plant, and equipment. Therefore, a detailed discus­
sion of the substantive procedures for property, plant, and equipment is provided next. The 
discussion focuses on substantive analytical procedures and tests of details of transactions, 
account balances, and disclosures.
Substantive Analytical Procedures—Property, Plant, 
and Equipment
The following list provides examples of substantive analytical procedures that can be used in 
the audit of property, plant, and equipment:
	
∙	 Compare prior-periods’ balances in property, plant, and equipment and depreciation 
expense with current-period balances, taking into account any changes in conditions 
or asset composition.
	
∙	 Compute the ratio of depreciation expense to the related property, plant, and 
equipment accounts and compare to prior years’ ratios.
	
∙	 Compute the ratio of repairs and maintenance expense to the related property, plant, 
and equipment accounts and compare to prior years’ ratios.
	
∙	 Compute the ratio of insurance expense to the related property, plant, and equipment 
accounts and compare to prior years’ ratios.
	
∙	 Review capital budgets and compare the amounts spent with amounts budgeted.
Stop and Think: For the first two procedures listed above, pause and consider what 
potential misstatements these procedures may help identify. 
In thinking of possible misstatements that substantive analytical procedures could detect, if, 
for example, the ratio of depreciation expense to the related property, plant, and equipment 
accounts is less than prior years’ and few assets have been disposed of, the auditor might be 
concerned that depreciation has not been taken on some assets included in the account and 
additional audit procedures would be performed.
LO 14-10
Key Segregation of Duties and Possible Errors or Fraud—Property 
Management Process
Segregation of Duties
Possible Errors or Fraud Resulting from Conflicts of Duties
The function of initiating a capital asset acquisition 
should be segregated from the final approval 
function.
If one individual is responsible for initiating a capital asset transaction and has final approval, 
fictitious or unauthorized purchases of assets can occur. This can result in purchases of 
unnecessary assets, assets that do not meet the company’s quality control standards, or 
illegal payments to suppliers or contractors.
The property, plant, and equipment records function 
should be segregated from the general ledger 
function.
If one individual is responsible for the property, plant, and equipment records and for the 
general ledger functions, that individual can conceal any defalcation that would normally 
be detected by reconciling subsidiary records with the general ledger control account.
The property, plant, and equipment records function 
should be segregated from the custodial or safe­
guarding function.
If one individual is responsible for the property, plant, and equipment records and has custo­
dial responsibility for the related assets, tools and equipment can be stolen, and the theft 
can be concealed by adjustment of the accounting records.
If a periodic physical inventory of property, plant, 
and equipment is taken, the individual respon­
sible for the inventory should be independent of 
the custodial and record-keeping functions.
If the individual who is responsible for the periodic physical inventory of property, plant, and 
equipment is also responsible for the custodial and record-keeping functions, theft of the 
entity’s capital assets can be concealed.

Tests of Details of Transactions, Account Balances, 
and Disclosures—Property, Plant, and Equipment
Table 14–2 summarizes examples of substantive tests for the property, plant, and equipment 
accounts for each assertion relating to transactions and balances. The discussion that follows 
focuses on the major audit procedures conducted by the auditor. Completeness and accuracy 
are discussed first because the auditor must establish that the detailed property, plant, and 
equipment records are accurate and agree with the general ledger account.
Completeness and Accuracy  The auditor verifies the accuracy of property, plant, and 
equipment by obtaining a lead schedule and detailed schedules for additions and dispositions 
of assets. The lead schedule is footed, and the individual accounts are agreed to the general 
ledger. The detailed schedules are also tested for accuracy. Exhibit 14–3 presents a lead sched­
ule for EarthWear’s property, plant, and equipment.
Stop and Think: Take a look at Exhibit 14–3 and ask yourself, “If I were EarthWear’s 
auditor, where would I focus my tests of details?”
The auditor has some assurance about the completeness assertion from the control activi­
ties in the purchasing process and, if present, the additional control activities discussed pre­
viously in this chapter. If the auditor still has concerns about the completeness assertion, he 
or she can physically examine a sample of assets and trace them into the property, plant, and 
equipment subsidiary ledger. If the assets are included in the subsidiary ledger, the auditor has 
sufficient evidence supporting the completeness assertion.
A common cause of an understated property, plant, and equipment account is the incor­
rect classification of plant and equipment additions as repairs and maintenance (see the Clas­
sification assertion in Table 14–2).

Valuation and allocation
Evaluate fixed assets for significant write-offs or impairments by performing procedures such as
 • Identify the event or change in circumstance indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be 
recoverable.
 • Verify impairment loss by determining the sum of expected future cash flows and comparing that sum to the car­
rying value.
 • Examine the entity’s documentation supporting impairment of write-off.
Test depreciation calculations for a sample of capital assets.
*These tests of details of transactions are commonly conducted as dual-purpose tests (i.e., in conjunction with tests of controls).

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Cutoff  On most engagements, cutoff is tested as part of the audit work in accounts pay­
able and accrued expenses. By examining a sample of vendor invoices from a few days 
before and after year-end, the auditor can determine if capital asset transactions are recorded 
in the proper period. Inquiry of entity personnel and a review of lease transactions for the 
same period can provide evidence on proper cutoff for leases.
Classification  First, the classification of a transaction into the correct property, plant, and 
equipment account is normally examined as part of the testing of the purchasing process. 
The auditor’s tests of controls and substantive tests of transactions provide evidence as to the 
effectiveness of the control activities for this assertion.
Second, the auditor should examine selected expense accounts such as repairs and main­
tenance to determine if any capital assets have been incorrectly recorded in these accounts. An 
account analysis of transactions included in the repairs and maintenance account is obtained, 
and selected transactions are vouched to supporting documents. In examining the supporting 
documents, the auditor must determine if the transactions are truly expense items or whether 
it would be more appropriate to capitalize the costs. For example, the auditor may examine an 
invoice from a plumbing contractor that shows that the water pipe system for a building has 
been replaced during the current period. If the amount of this transaction was material and 
improved the building, it should not be expensed as a repair but rather should be capitalized 
as a building improvement.
Last, the auditor should examine each material lease agreement to verify that the lease is 
properly classified as an operating or capital lease.
Stop and Think: Before continuing to read, use your developing audit knowledge to 
think of ways, beyond physical inspection, to obtain evidence on the existence of prop­
erty, plant, and equipment.
Existence  To test existence, the auditor obtains a listing of all major additions and vouches 
them to supporting documents such as vendors’ invoices. If the purchase was properly autho­
rized and the asset has been received and placed in service, the transaction is valid. In addi­
tion, the auditor may want to verify that assets recorded as capital assets actually exist. For 
major acquisitions, the auditor may physically examine the capital asset.
Similarly, disposition of assets must be properly authorized, and the supporting docu­
mentation such as sales receipts should indicate how the disposal took place. Generally, the 
auditor obtains a schedule of all major dispositions and verifies that the asset was removed 
from the property, plant, and equipment records. If the disposition is the result of a sale or 
exchange, the auditor would verify the cash receipt for the sale of the asset or documentation 
that another asset was received in exchange.
The auditor must also ascertain the validity of lease transactions by examining the lease 
agreements entered into by the entity. If the lease agreement is properly authorized and the 
asset is placed in service, the evidence supports the validity of the recorded asset.
Rights and Obligations  The auditor can test for rights or ownership by examining the 
vendor invoices or other supporting documents. In some instances, the auditor may examine 
or confirm property deeds or title documents for proof of ownership.
Valuation and Allocation  Capital assets are valued at acquisition cost plus any costs nec­
essary to make the asset operational. The auditor tests the recorded cost of new assets by 
examining the vendor invoices and other supporting documents used by the entity to establish 
the recorded value of the assets. If the entity has material self-constructed assets, the auditor 
conducts detailed audit work on the construction-in-process account. This includes ensuring 
that interest is properly capitalized as a cost of the asset.

	
Chapter 14    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Various Asset Accounts	
497
FASB ASC Topic 360, “Property, Plant, and Equipment,” requires that long-lived assets 
be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
assets’ carrying amount may not be recoverable. In reviewing for recoverability, the entity 
should estimate future (undiscounted) cash flows from use and eventual disposition of the 
assets. If the sum of those future cash flows is less than the assets’ carrying amount, the assets 
should be written down to their fair value and a loss recognized. The standards provide guid­
ance and illustrations on how to estimate future cash flows, but obviously this area requires 
substantial judgment and expertise. Typically, the auditor gathers evidence on the valuation 
of property, plant, and equipment through a variety of procedures (e.g., understanding of the 
business and industry and current events that may lead to impairment, tests of controls over the 
entity’s impairment evaluation, inquiry and observation regarding the condition and usefulness 
of long-lived assets, and tests of details of balances, such as those described in Table 14–2).
The other valuation issue the auditor must address is the recognition of depreciation 
expense. If the entity uses IT to process and account for capital assets, the auditor may be 
able to use CAATs to verify the calculation of depreciation for various assets. Alternatively, 
the auditor may recompute the depreciation expense for a sample of capital assets. In making 
this calculation, the auditor considers the reasonableness of the estimated life of the asset, the 
depreciation methods used for book and tax purposes, and any expected salvage value.
Disclosure Issues  Table 14–3 shows a number of important items that may require dis­
closure as part of the audit of property, plant, and equipment. Some of these disclosures are 
made in the “summary of significant accounting policies” footnote, while other items may be 
disclosed in separate footnotes. Exhibit 14–4 is a sample disclosure for an entity’s decision to 
discontinue operations at one of its operating facilities.
Examples of Items Requiring Disclosure—Property, Plant, and Equipment
Classes of capital assets and valuation bases
Depreciation methods and useful lives for financial reporting and tax purposes
Nonoperating assets
Construction or purchase commitments
Liens and mortgages
Acquisition or disposal of major operating facilities
Capitalized and other lease arrangements
T A B L E  1 4 – 3
Sample Disclosure of Nonoperating Property
In March 2015 the company decided to temporarily idle the Southern Alabama Mill. The decision was 
made in response to adverse industry conditions, mainly reduced selling prices and increased raw mate­
rial costs. In September 2015 it was further determined that because of continued deterioration of selling 
prices and the level of expenditures required to meet environmental restrictions, the Southern Alabama 
Mill would not resume operations. The assets of the mill cannot be sold for their historical cost, and in the 
third quarter the company recorded a $15.6 million loss on the mill.
E X H I B I T  1 4 – 4
Evaluating the Audit Findings—Property, Plant, 
and Equipment
The process for evaluating the audit findings for property, plant, and equipment is the same 
as was discussed in previous chapters. The auditor aggregates the likely misstatements and 
compares this amount to the tolerable misstatement. If the likely misstatement is less than 
the tolerable misstatement, the evidence indicates that the property, plant, and equipment 
accounts are not materially misstated. This is the case with EarthWear, as no misstatements 
were detected for property, plant, and equipment (see Exhibit 3–3).

KEY TERMS
Analytical procedures. Evaluations of financial information made through analysis of plau­
sible relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data.
Auditor specialist. An individual or organization possessing expertise in a field other than 
accounting or auditing, whose work in that field is used by the auditor to assist the auditor in 
obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence. An auditor’s specialist may be either an audi­
tor’s internal specialist (who is a partner or staff, including temporary staff, of the auditor’s 
firm or a network firm) or an auditor’s external specialist.
Intangible asset. An asset that is not physical in nature. Corporate intellectual property 
(items such as patents, trademarks, copyrights), goodwill, and brand recognition are common 
intangible assets.
Lien. When a creditor or bank has the right to sell the mortgaged or collateral property of 
those who fail to meet the obligations of a loan contract.
Prepaid expense. A type of asset that arises on a balance sheet as a result of a business mak­
ing payments for goods and services to be received in the near future. While prepaid expenses 
are initially recorded as assets, their value is expensed over time as the benefit is received.
Property, plant, and equipment (PP&E). An asset that is vital to business operations but 
cannot be easily liquidated (e.g., warehouse, manufacturing equipment).
Substantive tests of transactions. Tests to detect errors or fraud in individual transactions.
Tests of controls. Audit procedures performed to test the operating effectiveness of con­
trols in preventing, or detecting and correcting, material misstatements at the relevant asser­
tion level.
Tests of details of account balances and disclosures. Substantive tests that concentrate on 
the details of items contained in the account balance and disclosure.

DISCUSSION CASE
	
LO 14-11, 14-12	
14-29	 On January 15, 2015, Leno, Inc., which has a March 31 year-end, entered into a 
transaction to sell the land and building that contained its manufacturing operations 
for a total selling price of $19,750,000. The book value of the land and the building 
was $3,420,000. The final closing was not expected to occur until sometime between 
July 2016 and March 2017.
	
	
	 	
On March 16, 2015, Leno, Inc., received an irrevocable letter of credit, issued by 
a major bank, for $5,000,000, which represented more than 25 percent of the sales 
price. Leno, Inc., would collect the $5,000,000 and would keep the money even if 
the buyer decided not to complete the transaction. The letter of credit had an option 
for an extension for up to one year for a total period of two years. At closing, the 
entire selling price was to be paid in cash.
	
	
	 	
Leno, Inc., was going to continue its manufacturing operations in the building and 
would continue to be responsible for all normal occupancy costs until final closing, 
when it would move to another location. After the sale, the building would be torn 
down and replaced by a large office building complex.
Required:
	
a.	 Based on relevant accounting pronouncements for the sale of real estate, how 
should Leno, Inc., account for the transaction at March 31, 2015?
	
b.	 What additional types of evidence should the auditor examine prior to recogniz­
ing any gain on the transaction?

Stockholders’ Equity, and Income 
Statement Accounts
T
his chapter presents the audit of long-term liabilities, stockholders’ 
equity, and income statement accounts. Long-term debt and equity are 
the major sources of financing for most entities. A substantive audit strat­
egy is normally followed when long-term liabilities and stockholders’ equity 
accounts are audited, because although the number of transactions is small, 
each transaction is often highly material. For public companies required to 
have an audit of internal control over financial reporting, the auditor would also 
obtain evidence from tests of controls.
While the main focus of this chapter is auditing the long-term liabilities, 
stockholders’ equity, and income statement accounts for a financial state­
ment audit, the concepts covered for setting control risk are applicable to 
an audit of internal control over financial reporting. This chapter also covers 
the audit of selected income statement accounts. The discussion of auditing 
the income statement focuses on how the auditor’s work on internal control 
and substantive analytical procedures provide evidence on income statement 
accounts and how many income statement accounts are audited at the same 
time as their related balance sheet accounts are audited.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Common types of long-term debt financing include notes, bonds, and mortgages. Capital­
ized lease obligations also represent a form of long-term debt. More sophisticated types of 
debt financing include collateralized mortgage obligations, repurchase and reverse repurchase 
agreements, interest-rate swaps, financial futures, and a myriad of other financial instru­
ments and derivatives (see Exhibit 15–1). Accounting for and auditing such sophisticated debt 
instruments and financial instruments that have characteristics of both debt and equity can be 
complex and is beyond the scope of this text. While the concepts relating to the audit of most 
types of debt are similar, to simplify our discussion we focus on notes and bonds, including 
the audit of interest payable and interest expense.
Long-term debt may have a number of features that can affect the audit procedures 
used. For example, debt may be convertible into stock, or it may be combined with warrants, 
options, or rights that can be exchanged for equity. Debt may be callable under certain con­
ditions, or it may require the establishment of a sinking fund, which is a pool of money set 
aside for repaying the debt or to repurchase a portion of the existing bonds every year. The 
sinking fund is often held by a bond trustee to ensure that the funds are only used for bond 
retirement. Finally, debt may be either unsecured or secured by assets of the entity.
The auditor’s consideration of long-term debt, however, is no different from that of any 
other financial statement account. The auditor must be assured that the amounts shown on 
the balance sheet for the various types of long-term debt are not materially misstated. This 
assurance extends to the proper recognition of interest expense relating to long-term debt in 
the financial statements.
LO 15-1
Auditing Long-Term Debt
Derivatives Lead to Losses at American International Group, Inc.
Derivatives are contracts that are written between two parties. The value of a derivative contract to one 
of the parties and the cost or obligation to the other is derived from the value of an underlying asset, such 
as currencies, equities, commodities, mortgages, interest rates, or from stock market or other indicators. 
While derivatives can be used wisely by management to hedge risk, they can also be used to create lever­
age and thereby greatly increase risk.
American International Group, Inc. (AIG) identified a seemingly low-risk method of capitalizing on the 
housing boom in the mid-2000s. As the boom grew, fresh capital was needed to provide for the increased 
demand for home mortgages. A significant source of capital was obtained through the selling of pools of 
mortgages as bonds to investors (mortgages that are grouped and securitized are known as mortgage-
backed securities or asset-backed securities). The mortgage holders selling the securitized bonds wanted 
a form of insurance that would cover their losses in case homeowners were to default on the underlying 
mortgages. This “insurance” was provided in the form of credit-default swaps (CDSs), which is a derivative 
contract, consisting basically of a promise to pay the value of the mortgage to the holder of the CDS in 
case of mortgage default. Many banks and institutions sold and purchased CDSs to hedge their exposure 
to potential losses on their investments in mortgage-backed securities. However, AIG only sold CDSs, 
which generated significant fee revenue at seemingly little risk . . . because everyone knows that housing 
prices always go up . . . well, not quite always, as AIG found out.
AIG’s CDS strategy initially paid off handsomely because mortgage defaults are uncommon when 
home prices are rapidly appreciating. The problem was that the rapid appreciation in home prices actually 
represented a speculative “bubble.” When the housing bubble burst and the subprime mortgage mar­
ket collapsed, homeowners began defaulting on their mortgages in large numbers, and the value of the 
mortgage-backed securities plummeted. As the value of the bonds dropped, CDS holders demanded that 
AIG pay up in accordance with the contract. Because AIG had entered the CDS market in such an aggres­
sive manner, the company’s exposure to CDS claims was huge. In 2007 and 2008, AIG recognized $11.47 
and $28.6 billion, respectively, in charges related to its CDS portfolio and has survived with the help of a 
massive cash infusion from the federal government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).

Stop and Think: Which assertions will be more important in the audit of long-term debt?
The approach to the audit of long-term debt varies depending on the frequency of the 
entity’s financing activities. For entities that engage in frequent financing activities, the audi­
tor may follow a reliance strategy under which internal control is formally evaluated and tests 
of controls are performed in order to set control risk. However, for the vast majority of entities 
where the auditor is not required to test internal controls over financial reporting, it is more 
efficient for the auditor to follow a substantive strategy and perform a detailed audit of long-
term debt and the related interest accounts.
Practice 
INSIGHT
It’s important for auditors to consider possible off-balance sheet financing. Such financing contrib­
uted to the Enron Corporation accounting fraud. The fraud was revealed in October 2001 and led 
to the bankruptcy of Enron, a Houston-based energy company, and contributed to the ultimate 
dissolution of then Big 5 accounting firm Arthur Andersen. Enron had off-balance sheet financing 
through transactions with “Special Purpose Entities” (now known as Variable Interest Entities, or 
VIEs). There were legitimate situations for off-balance sheet financing. Enron did not consolidate 
these companies because the company claimed that the transactions with these VIEs were arm’s-
length and complied with the accounting standards at the time. However, in Enron’s case some of 
the transactions involving VIEs were not arm’s-length because Enron was the underlying guarantor 
of the debt. In effect, by not consolidating the VIEs, Enron failed to report hundreds of millions in 
debt. The determination of whether an investment or entity should be consolidated with its parent 
company should be evaluated and special attention should be given to these inherently complex 
classes of transactions.
Inherent Risk Assessment—Long-Term Debt
Inherent risk for notes and bonds would normally be assessed as low to moderate because 
the volume of transactions is low, the accounting is usually not complex, and the entity often 
receives third-party statements or amortization schedules. However, the amounts involved 
are usually large, and, as noted in the chapter introduction, the financial markets have devel­
oped very sophisticated instruments that can introduce an enormous amount of leverage 
and that can have characteristics of both debt and equity. The inherent risk associated with 
these sophisticated instruments is normally high. However, in this chapter we focus on notes 
and bonds.
Control Risk Assessment—Long-Term Debt
When a substantive strategy is followed, the auditor needs a sufficient understanding of the 
entity’s internal control system over debt transactions to be able to anticipate the types of mis­
statements that may occur. The following discussion of control risk assessment for long-term 
debt focuses on the general types of control activities that should be present to minimize the 
likelihood of material misstatement. The assertions that are of primary concern to the auditor 
are occurrence, authorization, completeness, valuation, and disclosure-classification.
Assertions and Related Control Activities
Following are some of the more common controls that should be present for the important 
assertions for long-term debt.
LO 15-2
LO 15-3

510	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Occurrence and Authorization  The entity should have controls to ensure that any 
transactions involving long-term financing are properly initiated by authorized individuals. 
First, adequate documentation must be developed and kept to verify that a note or bond was 
properly authorized. The presence of adequate documentation, such as a properly signed 
lending agreement, allows the auditor to determine if the transaction was properly executed. 
Second, any significant debt commitments should be approved by the board of directors 
or by executives who have been delegated this authority. Entities that engage in recurring 
borrowing activities should have both general and specific controls. The board of direc­
tors should establish general controls to guide the entity’s financing activities. The specific 
controls for borrowing and repayment may be delegated to an executive, such as the chief 
financial officer. When the chief financial officer or similar executive is responsible for both 
executing and accounting for long-term debt transactions, another executive body, such as 
the finance committee of the board of directors, should provide overall review and approval 
in the minutes. If the entity has proper controls and documentation for debt transactions, it 
is generally easy for the auditor to obtain evidence on occurrence and authorization at the 
end of the period.
Completeness  The entity should maintain detailed records of long-term debt transac­
tions to ensure that all borrowings and repayments of principal and interest are recorded. One 
approach to handling detailed debt transactions is to maintain a subsidiary ledger that con­
tains information about all the long-term debt owed by the entity. The debt amount recorded 
in the subsidiary ledger should be reconciled to the general ledger control account regularly.
Valuation  Note and bond transactions are recorded in the accounting records at their face 
value plus or minus any premium or discount. Premiums or discounts should be amortized 
using the effective interest method1 to calculate interest expense. Sometimes an entity incurs 
“issuing costs” such as underwriter’s fees, legal fees, and accounting fees. Such costs should 
be recorded as deferred charges and amortized over the life of the debt. Valuation issues for 
sophisticated financial instruments are far more complex. Although the entity should have 
control activities to ensure that long-term debt is properly valued, outside specialists are 
often consulted.
Disclosure-Classification  Controls should ensure that the proper disclosures are pro­
vided for long-term debt. Common disclosures involve related-party transactions, restrictive 
debt covenants, and revolving lines of credit. Controls should also ensure that notes and bonds 
are properly classified in the financial statements. The major issue is that controls are in place 
to ensure that the portion of long-term debt that is due within the next year is properly classi­
fied as a short-term liability.
One final issue related to control risk for long-term debt is that the entity should have 
adequate custodial procedures for any unissued notes or bonds to safeguard against loss from 
theft. Procedures should provide for periodic inspections by an individual who is independent 
of both the custodial and accounting responsibilities for long-term debt.
1The effective interest rate method amortizes the bond discount as interest expense each period over the life of the 
bond. The discount and additional interest expense are computed based on the market rate when the bond is issued.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The completeness assertion can be difficult to test because it is inherently difficult to answer the 
question “what hasn’t been recorded?” Thus, it is particularly important that the auditor use a top-
down approach when obtaining evidence on the completeness assertion for liabilities. The auditor 
must evaluate the incentives, pressures, and tone at the top to assess the potential threat for omitted 
liabilities. Too much focus on transaction-level control activities, to the exclusion of assessing the 
bigger picture, increases the risk that the auditor will get an inflated sense of comfort and assurance 
regarding the completeness of the reported liabilities.

	
Chapter 15    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Liabilities, Equity, Income Statement	
511
A substantive strategy for auditing long-term debt involves examining any new debt agreements, 
determining the status of prior debt agreements, and confirming balances and other relevant 
information with outside parties (debt agreements for bonds are called bond or trust indentures).
Substantive analytical procedures are useful in auditing interest expense because of the 
direct relationship between long-term debt and interest expense. For example, the auditor 
could estimate interest expense by multiplying the 12 monthly balances for long-term debt by 
the average monthly interest rate. The reasonableness of recorded interest expense could then 
be assessed by comparing this estimate to the interest expense amount recorded in the general 
ledger. If the two amounts are not materially different, the auditor can conclude that interest 
expense is fairly stated. If the estimated amount of interest expense is materially higher than 
the recorded amount, the auditor might conclude that the entity has failed to record a portion 
of interest expense. On the other hand, if the recorded amount of interest expense is materially 
higher than the estimated amount, the entity may have failed to record debt. Refer to Chapter 5 
for an example of the use of a substantive analytical procedure to test the relationship between 
EarthWear’s  short-term line of credit and related interest expense.
Table 15–1 provides examples of tests of transactions and account balances for the key 
assertions of long-term debt. The following discussion will help you understand the general 
approach to auditing long-term debt.

Review interest expense for payments to debt holders not listed on the debt analysis schedule.
Review notes paid or renewed after the balance sheet date to determine if there are unrecorded 
liabilities at year-end.
Evaluate lease contracts to determine if leases are properly accounted for as an operating or capital 
lease (i.e., if a lease should be a capital lease, it would likely require recognition of long-term debt).
Authorization
Examine board minutes for evidence of proper authorization of notes or bonds.
Accuracy
Test a sample of receipts and payments.
Cutoff
Review debt activity for a few days before and after year-end to determine if the transactions are 
included in the proper period.
Classification
Examine the due dates on notes or bonds for proper classification between current and 
long-term debt.
Assertions about Account Balances

Confirm notes or bonds directly with creditors (in many instances, creditors are banks, insurance 
companies, or trustees representing the creditors).
Rights and obligations
Examine copies of note and bond agreements.
Completeness
Obtain an analysis of notes payable, bonds payable, and accrued interest payable; foot schedule 
and agree totals to the general ledger.
Obtain a standard bank confirmation that requests specific information on notes from banks (see 
Chapter 16 for further discussion of bank confirmations).
Confirm notes or bonds with creditors.
Inquire of management regarding the existence of off-balance sheet activities.
Review board meeting minutes for debt-related activity.
Valuation and allocation
Examine new debt agreements (e.g., bond indentures) to ensure that they were recorded at the 
proper value.
Confirm the outstanding balance for notes or bonds and the last date on which interest has 
been paid.
Recompute accrued interest payable.
Verify computation of the amortization of premium or discount.
*These substantive tests of transactions are commonly conducted as dual-purpose tests (i.e., in conjunction with tests of controls).

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
The auditor generally begins the audit of long-term debt by obtaining an analysis sched­
ule for notes payable, bonds payable, and accrued interest payable. Exhibit 15–2 presents an 
example of such a schedule. Because EarthWear  does not have long-term debt, the example 
in Exhibit 15–2 is based on Calabro Wireless Services. If there are numerous transactions 
during the year, this schedule may include only the debt outstanding at the end of the period. 
Note that this schedule includes a considerable amount of information on each debt transac­
tion, including the payee, date due, interest rate, original amount, collateral, and paid and 
accrued interest.
Exhibit 15–2 also indicates the audit procedures performed on the details of the debt 
schedule.
Stop and Think: Take a break from reading for a moment and look at the tick mark 
descriptions in Exhibit 15–2 and see if you can identify the assertion each procedure is 
addressing.
Evidence is gathered for the most important assertions as follows. Each debt instrument 
is confirmed with the debt holders and includes a request to verify the amount owed and last 
date on which interest has been paid.2 Confirmation of the debt and accrued interest provides 
evidence on the existence, completeness, and valuation assertions. If the entity’s debt is guar­
anteed by another party, a confirmation should be sent to the guarantor to confirm the 
guarantee.
The auditor also examines the due dates for the debt to ensure proper classification 
between current and long-term liabilities. Last, the auditor examines the debt agreements for 
any restrictive covenants that require disclosure in the footnotes. Examples of such covenants 
include restrictions on the payment of dividends or the issuance of additional debt or equity, 
and the maintenance of certain financial ratios. Exhibit 15–3 provides an example of the dis­
closure of restrictive covenants.
2The debt instrument can also be confirmed with the bond trustee, which is a financial institution given fiduciary 
powers by the debt holder to enforce the terms of the debt instrument. The trustee ensures that interest payments are 
made on time.
Auditing Stockholders’ Equity
For most entities, stockholders’ equity includes common stock, preferred stock, paid-in 
capital, and retained earnings. In recent years, numerous financial instruments have been 
developed that contain both debt and equity characteristics and that affect the audit of stock­
holders’ equity. A host of stock option and compensation plans also impact the audit of 
stockholders’ equity. A discussion of these complex equity instruments and stock option 
plans is beyond the scope of this text (share-based compensation is discussed in the Advanced 
Module to Chapter 12).
Following are the three major types of transactions that occur in stockholders’ equity:
	
∙	 Issuance of stock. This includes transactions such as sale of stock for cash; the 
exchange of stock for assets, services, or convertible debt; and issuance of stock in 
stock splits.
	
∙	 Repurchase of stock. This includes the reacquisition of stock (referred to as treasury 
stock) and the retirement of stock.
	
∙	 Payment of dividends. This includes the payment of cash dividends or issuance of 
stock dividends.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Control Risk Assessment—Stockholders’ Equity
A substantive strategy is most often used to audit stockholders’ equity because the number of 
transactions is usually small and often the value is large. Although control risk can then be 
set at the maximum, the auditor must still understand the types of controls that are in place 
to prevent the misstatement of equity transactions. Further, the auditor must test the design 
and operating effectiveness of key controls over stockholders’ equity if the entity is a public 
company required to have an audit of internal controls over financial reporting.
Many large entities, such as publicly traded companies, use an independent registrar, 
transfer agent, and dividend-disbursing agent to process and record equity transactions. The 
registrar is responsible for ensuring that all stock issued complies with the corporate char­
ter and for maintaining the control totals for total shares outstanding. The transfer agent is 
responsible for preparing stock certificates and maintaining adequate stockholders’ records. 
The dividend-disbursing agent prepares and mails dividend checks to the stockholders of 
record. When an entity uses an independent registrar, transfer agent, and dividend-disbursing 
agent, the auditor may be able to obtain sufficient evidence about stockholders’ equity by 
confirming the relevant information with those parties.
If an entity uses its own employees to perform the stock transfer and dividend disburse­
ment functions, the auditor will need to understand and may test internal controls over stock 
and dividend transactions and the auditor will likely perform more detailed testing of the 
stock and dividend-related records and transactions. Next we’ll discuss the assertions, control 
activities, and segregation of duties that are relevant when entity personnel transfer stock and 
disburse dividends.
Assertions and Related Control Activities
Following are the major evidence-gathering procedures and assertions for stockholders’ equity:
	
∙	 Verify that stock and dividend transactions are valid and comply with the corporate 
charter (occurrence).
	
∙	 Verify that all stock and dividend transactions have been properly posted and 
summarized in the accounting records (accuracy).
	
∙	 Verify that stock and dividend transactions have been properly approved 
(authorization).
	
∙	 Verify that stock and dividend transactions have been properly valued (valuation).
Occurrence  One of the entity’s officers, such as the corporate secretary or legal counsel, 
should ensure that every stock or dividend transaction complies with the corporate charter or 
any regulatory requirement that affects the entity. This individual should also maintain the 
stockholders’ ledger, which contains the name of each stockholder and the number of shares 
held by that shareholder.
LO 15-6
LO 15-7
Sample Disclosure of Restrictive Loan Covenants
Our Credit Agreement with the bank contains customary negative covenants and financial covenants, 
including negative covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to: incur additional indebtedness, includ­
ing guarantees; create, incur, assume or permit to exist liens on property and assets; declare or pay divi­
dends and make distributions; enter into mergers and acquisitions; enter into sale-leaseback transactions; 
make optional prepayments of certain indebtedness; or, execute modifications to material contracts. The 
financial covenants include maintaining a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio, as defined, not less than 
1 to 1 as of December 31, 2015. Management believes that the Company is in compliance with all cov­
enants at December 31, 2015.
E X H I B I T  1 5 – 3

	
Chapter 15    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Liabilities, Equity, Income Statement	
515
Accuracy  The control activities for this assertion include reconciliation of the stockhold­
ers’ records with the number of shares outstanding and reconciliation of dividends paid with 
the total shares outstanding on the dividend record date.
Authorization  For most entities, the board of directors or stockholders approve stock and 
dividend transactions. The authorization is normally documented in the minutes of the board 
of directors’ meetings. The auditor can examine the board of directors’ minutes for proper 
authorization.
Valuation  Stock issuances, stock repurchases, and dividends should be recorded by the 
treasurer’s department at an amount that conforms to GAAP. The auditor can recompute the 
recording of the stock and dividend transactions.
Segregation of Duties
If the entity has enough personnel, the following segregation of duties should be maintained:
	
∙	 The individuals responsible for issuing, transferring, and canceling stock certificates 
should not have any accounting responsibilities.
	
∙	 The individual responsible for maintaining the detailed stockholders’ records should 
be independent of the maintenance of the general ledger control accounts.
	
∙	 The individual responsible for maintaining the detailed stockholders’ records should 
not also process cash receipts or disbursements.
	
∙	 Appropriate segregation of duties should be established among the preparation, 
recording, signing, and mailing of dividend checks.
If the entity doesn’t have enough personnel to fully segregate all the duties, there should 
be compensating management review controls in place.
Stop and Think: Pause for a moment and consider what types of problems could occur 
if there were inadequate segregation of duties in each of the areas listed above.
LO 15-8
Auditing Capital-Stock Accounts
The capital-stock accounts include common stock, preferred stock, and paid-in capital. When 
auditing the capital-stock accounts, the auditor is normally concerned with the occurrence, 
completeness, valuation, and completeness of disclosures assertions. The auditor begins the 
audit of capital stock by obtaining a schedule of all activity in the accounts for the current 
period. The beginning balance is agreed to the prior year’s working papers, and the ending 
balance is agreed to the general ledger. The majority of the auditor’s work then focuses on the 
current-period activity in each account.
Occurrence and Completeness
All valid capital-stock transactions must be approved by the board of directors. Therefore, the 
auditor can obtain assurance on the occurrence of capital-stock transactions by tracing the 
transactions recorded in the current year to the board of directors’ minutes. When an indepen­
dent registrar and transfer agent are used by the entity, the auditor confirms the total number 
of shares outstanding at the end of the period. If the amount of shares listed as outstanding 
on the confirmation reconciles to the general ledger capital-stock accounts, the auditor has 
evidence that the total number of shares outstanding at the end of the year is correct.
LO 15-9

516	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
If the entity does not use outside agents, it will maintain a stock register and/or a stock 
certificate book. The auditor may perform the following procedures:
	
∙	 Trace the transfers of shares between stockholders to the stock register and/or stock 
certificate book (accuracy and completeness).
	
∙	 Foot the shares outstanding in the stock register and/or stock certificate book and 
agree them to total shares outstanding in the general ledger capital-stock accounts 
(completeness).
	
∙	 Examine any canceled stock certificates (occurrence).
	
∙	 Account for and inspect any unissued stock certificates in the stock certificate book 
(completeness).
Valuation
When capital stock is issued for cash, the assessment of proper valuation is straightforward. 
The par, or stated, value for the shares issued is assigned to the respective capital-stock 
account, while the difference between the price and par value is allocated to paid-in capital. 
The auditor can recompute the values assigned to each transaction. The proceeds from the 
sale of stock are normally traced to the cash receipts records.
The valuation issue is more complex when capital stock is issued in exchange for assets 
or services, for a merger or acquisition, for convertible securities, or for a stock dividend. For 
example, for small stock dividends where less than 20 to 25 percent of the shares outstanding 
will be issued, the dividend is recorded at the market value of the shares on the declaration 
date. The fair market value of the stock dividend is charged to retained earnings and credited 
to common stock and paid-in capital in excess of par. To obtain evidence on valuation, the 
auditor can recompute the stock dividend and trace the entries into the general ledger. Large 
stock dividends are recorded at par value.
Completeness of Disclosures
A number of important disclosures are necessary for stockholders’ equity. Table 15–2 contains 
examples of stockholders’ equity disclosures. The normal sources of this information include 
the corporate charter, minutes of the board of directors’ meetings, and contractual agreements.
Examples of Disclosure Items for Stockholders’ Equity
Number of shares authorized, issued, and outstanding for each class of stock.
Call privileges, prices, and dates for preferred stock.
Preferred-stock sinking funds.
Stock option or purchase plans.
Restrictions on retained earnings and dividends.
Any completed or pending transactions (such as stock dividends or splits) that may affect stockholders’ equity.
T A B L E  1 5 – 2
Auditing Dividends
Generally, all dividends that are declared and paid will be audited because of concerns 
with violations of corporate bylaws or debt covenants. When the entity uses an independent 
dividend-disbursing agent, the auditor can confirm the amount disbursed to the agent by the 
entity. This amount is agreed with the amount authorized by the board of directors. The audi­
tor can recompute the dividend amount by multiplying the number of shares outstanding on 
the record date by the amount of the per-share dividend approved by the board of directors. 
This amount should agree to the amount disbursed to shareholders and accrued at year-end. 
If the auditor is concerned about the entity’s controls over dividend disbursements, he or she

may compare the payee names and amounts on the individual canceled checks with the stock 
register or stock certificate book. The auditor also reviews the entity’s compliance with any 
agreements that restrict the payments of dividends.
Practice 
INSIGHT
A substantive approach is appropriate when auditing the retained earnings account for an entity not 
required to have an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Each transaction is often tested 
because there are relatively few transactions recorded in the retained earnings account. Because 
retained earnings is a “residual” account, auditors typically do not allocate materiality or tolerable 
misstatement to retained earnings.
Auditing Retained Earnings
Under normal circumstances, retained earnings are affected by the current year’s income 
or loss, as well as cash or stock dividends paid. However, certain accounting standards 
require that some transactions be recorded directly to retained earnings. Thus, additional 
audit procedures are sometimes required. Prior-period adjustments, correction of errors, 
stock retirements, and changes in appropriations of retained earnings are examples of such 
transactions.
The auditor begins the audit of retained earnings by obtaining a schedule of the account 
activity for the period. The beginning balance is agreed to the prior year’s working papers and 
financial statements. Net income or loss can be traced to the income statement. The amounts 
for any cash or stock dividends can be verified as described earlier. If there are any prior-
period adjustments, the auditor must be certain that the transactions satisfy the requirements 
of the relevant accounting standards. Any new appropriations or changes in existing appro­
priations should be traced to the relevant contractual agreements. Last, the auditor must make 
sure that all necessary disclosures related to retained earnings are made in the footnotes. For 
example, many debt agreements restrict the amount of retained earnings that is available for 
payment as dividends (see Exhibit 15–3).
LO 15-11
Auditing Income Statement Accounts
In auditing income statement accounts, the auditor must be satisfied that the revenue and 
expense accounts are not materially misstated and that they are accounted for in accordance 
with GAAP. For many companies, revenue is one of the largest accounts in the financial state­
ments and it is an important driver of a company’s operating results. Revenue is typically 
deemed to be a significant account and due to complex accounting standards and the need for 
estimation, improper revenue recognition is an important fraud risk that auditors need to con­
sider. The income statement is viewed as an important source of information by various users 
of the financial statements. For example, creditors or potential creditors look to an entity’s 
profitability as one indicator of the entity’s ability to repay debt. Potential investors look to the 
income statement when deciding whether to purchase the entity’s stock. Finally, vendors may 
examine the entity’s earnings potential in order to assess whether the entity will be able to pay 
for goods or services purchased on credit.
The audit of the revenue and expense accounts depends on the extent of work conducted 
by the auditor on the entity’s control system and on the entity’s balance sheet accounts. For 
example, the likelihood of material misstatement in the various revenue and expense accounts 
is a function of the entity’s controls. The level of control risk established for the different 
business processes directly affects the extent of testing that the auditor requires to audit the 
income statement accounts.
LO 15-12

518	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Auditing the income statement includes consideration of the results of audit work con­
ducted in other parts of the audit and completion of additional substantive procedures on 
selected income statement accounts, including the following:
	
∙	 The results of testing controls for the various business processes.
	
∙	 The results of the detailed tests of balance sheet accounts and the related income 
statement accounts.
	
∙	 Performance of substantive analytical procedures on income statement accounts.
	
∙	 Detailed tests of selected income statement accounts.
Assessing Control Risk for Business Processes—Income 
Statement Accounts
In previous chapters, the auditor’s approach to setting the control risk for various business 
processes was discussed. To better understand the effect of a reduced control risk assessment 
on the audit of the revenue and expense accounts, consider the income statement accounts 
affected by the revenue and purchasing business processes. For example, a justifiably reduced 
control risk assessment for the revenue process provides evidence that the sales, accounts 
receivable, allowance for uncollectible accounts, and sales returns and allowances accounts 
are not materially misstated. Similarly, a reduced control risk assessment for the purchasing 
process provides evidence that financial statement accounts such as inventory; property, plant, 
and equipment; accounts payable; and most expense accounts are not materially misstated. 
The important point here is that the auditor already has reliable evidence on the accounts 
included in the income statement. Audit findings related to the purchasing process are par­
ticularly relevant, since proper controls over that process provide evidence on most of the 
expense accounts. This allows the auditor to do considerably fewer substantive procedures for 
these income statement accounts.
Substantive Procedures—Income Statement Accounts
Direct Tests of Balance Sheet Accounts
Income statement accounts are normally audited in the course of auditing the related balance 
sheet accounts. Table 15–3 lists balance sheet accounts and the related income statement 
accounts that are verified in this manner. For example, when the allowance for uncollectible 
accounts is audited, bad-debt expense is also tested. Similarly, when auditing notes receiv­
able, the auditor can test interest income.
Substantive Analytical Procedures for Income Statement Accounts
Substantive analytical procedures can be used extensively to provide assurance on the revenue 
and expense accounts. The auditing standard on the consideration of fraud risk indicates that 
the auditor should ordinarily presume that there is a risk of material misstatement due to fraud

relating to revenue recognition. Disaggregated analytical procedures are typically conducted 
on the revenue account to identify unusual or unexpected relationships that may be indicative 
of fraud.
One type of substantive analytical procedure involves comparing the current year’s dollar 
amount for each revenue and expense account (e.g., by product, business segment, or geo­
graphic region) with the prior years’ balances. Any account that deviates from the prior years’ 
trend by more than a predetermined amount should be investigated. An alternative to this type 
of substantive analytical procedure involves calculating the ratio of individual expense 
accounts to net sales and comparing these percentages across years. The auditor can also com­
pare these percentages to industry averages. Individual expense accounts that are judged by 
the auditor to be out of line are investigated further. While these types of substantive analyti­
cal procedures are common, it is important that substantive analytical procedures designed to 
provide evidence regarding the fairness of revenue or other income statement accounts be 
conducted at a sufficiently disaggregated (i.e., monthly or weekly data versus annual data, by 
business segment or product) level to detect potential misstatements. As noted in Chapter 5, 
even relatively small percentage misstatements in large income statement accounts are often 
material, thus the need for precise substantive analytical procedures.3
Substantive analytical procedures can also be used to provide evidence of specific rev­
enue or expense accounts. For example, the auditor can evaluate the reasonableness of sales 
commissions by using the entity’s commission schedule and multiplying commission rates 
by eligible sales. This estimate can be compared to the recorded commission expense. Other 
examples might include overall reasonableness tests for interest and depreciation expense.
3In recent years, the PCAOB has been critical of substantive analytical procedures applied to large income state-
ment accounts. For a discussion of the issues and a potential path forward see, S. Glover, D. Prawitt, and M. Drake, 
“Between a Rock and a Hard Place: A Path Forward for Using Substantive Analytical Procedures in Auditing Large 
P&L Accounts,” Auditing: A Journal of Practice and Theory, vol. 34, 2015
Practice 
INSIGHT
A review of actual audit working papers found that auditors often over-rely on weak analytical pro­
cedures when a substantive analytical procedure is used as the primary substantive evidence for an 
income statement account. Research conducted to understand this finding suggests that auditors 
overestimate the quality and strength of evidence provided by a weak (i.e., highly aggregated) sub­
stantive analytical procedure if the procedure yields a “favorable” result (i.e., if it indicates that there 
is no material misstatement). However, keep in mind that the quality and strength of the evidence 
provided by a substantive analytical procedure can and should be measured before the procedure 
is performed and are not affected by whether or not the procedure yields a favorable or an unfavor­
able outcome. A weak analytical procedure is weak no matter the outcome of the test. See S. Glover, 
D. Prawitt, and J. Wilks, “Why Do Auditors Over-Rely on Weak Analytical Procedures? The Role of 
Outcome and Precision,” Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory, vol. 25, 2005.
Tests of Selected Account Balances
Even though the auditor will have gathered considerable evidence about revenue and expense 
accounts based on the audit procedures just discussed, the auditor may want to examine some 
accounts further. For these accounts, the auditor typically analyzes in detail the transactions 
included in each account. The auditor verifies the transactions by examining (vouching) the 
supporting documentation. Accounts examined in this manner are generally accounts that are 
not directly affected by a business process, accounts that may contain sensitive information or 
unusual transactions, or accounts for which detailed information is needed for the tax return 
or other schedules included with the financial statements. Some examples of such accounts 
include legal and audit expense, travel and entertainment, charity expense, other income and 
expenses, and any account containing related-party transactions. Exhibit 15–4 presents an 
account analysis for EarthWear’s  legal and audit expense. In auditing this account, the auditor 
vouches the transactions to the attorneys’ invoices. The auditor should examine the invoice 
not only for the amount but also for information on potential uncertainties, such as lawsuits 
against the entity.

DISCUSSION CASE
	
LO 15-4	
15-25	 On September 10, Melinda Johnson was auditing the financial statements of a new 
audit client, Mother Earth Foods, a health-food chain that has a June 30 year-end. 
The company is privately held and has just gone through a leveraged buyout with 
long-term financing that includes various restrictive covenants.
	
	
	 	
In order to obtain debt financing, companies often have to agree to certain condi­
tions, some of which may restrict the way in which they conduct their business. If the 
borrower fails to comply with the stated conditions, it may be considered in default, 
which would give the lender the right to accelerate the due date of the debt, add other 
restrictions, waive the default for a stated period, or revise the covenants. Usually 
there is a grace period during which the borrower can cure the default.
	
	
	 	
Johnson believes that it is possible that at August 31 Mother Earth was in violation 
of the debt covenant restrictions, which became effective on that date. The debt cov­
enants require the company to maintain a certain receivable turnover rate. Johnson is 
not certain, however, because the accounting records, including period-end cutoffs 
for sales and purchases, have not been well maintained. Nevertheless, Mother Earth’s 
executives assure Johnson that if they were in violation, the company will be able to 
obtain a waiver or modification of the covenant.
Required:
	
a.	 Discuss the audit procedures that Johnson would conduct to determine if Mother 
Earth violated the debt covenants. How would Johnson determine whether 
Mother Earth would be able to obtain a waiver, assuming that the company was in

Auditing the Financing/Investing 
Process: Cash and Investments
T
his chapter covers the audit of cash and investments. These are the last 
accounts studied in our coverage of auditing business processes and 
related accounts because each of the other business processes inter­
acts with cash. Thus, the evidence gathered during the audit of other business 
processes affects the type and amount of evidence required to audit cash.
Proper management of cash and investments is essential to every entity. 
The principal goal of cash management is to ensure that sufficient cash is avail­
able to meet the entity’s needs. Achieving this goal requires good forecasting 
of cash receipts and disbursements. By using sound cash-forecasting tech­
niques, management can plan to invest excess cash and borrow at favorable 
interest rates when cash is required. Because cash and investments are so 
liquid, they normally represent critical audit areas. The Advanced Module dis­
cusses auditing fair value measurements.
While the audit of cash is typically uneventful, certainly it wasn’t in the 
Parmalat audit you will read about in this chapter and it wasn’t for a former audi­
tor we know who, many years ago, arrived at an entity’s location a day early to 
audit cash. The surprised CFO, who had been stealing funds from the entity, 
had the company’s accounting records for the cash accounts on his desk and 
he was working on hiding his fraud. When he saw the auditor, he stood up and 
jumped out the window.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Auditing Cash
The line item “cash” reported in the financial statements represents currency on hand and 
cash on deposit in bank accounts, including certificates of deposit, time deposits, and savings 
accounts. Frequently, certain “cash equivalents” are combined with cash for presentation in 
the financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 230, “Statement of Cash Flows,” defines cash 
equivalents as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and so 
near their maturity that there is little risk of change in their value. Examples of such financial 
instruments include Treasury bills and money market funds.
Because virtually all accounting transactions pass through the cash account as part of 
their “cradle-to-grave” cycle, cash is affected in one way or another by all of the entity’s busi­
ness processes. Figure 16–1 shows the effect each major business process has on the cash 
account. Although the main source of cash receipts is the revenue process, other sources of 
cash include the sale of property, plant, and equipment and the proceeds from issuing long-
term debt or capital stock. The main sources of disbursements from cash are the purchasing 
and human resource management processes. Generally, large payments initiated in the pur­
chasing process are for acquisitions of inventory and property, plant, and equipment. Pay­
ments on long-term debt and repurchase of stock are other types of cash disbursements.
Because of the close relationship of cash to the revenue and purchasing processes, issues 
relating to the inherent and control risks for cash were discussed in Chapters 10 and 11, 
respectively. Specifically regarding control risk, Table 10–7 summarized the assertions, pos­
sible misstatements, control activities, and tests of controls for cash receipt transactions. A 
similar summary was provided for cash disbursement transactions in Table 11–7. Therefore, 
we will not repeat the discussion of inherent or control risk for cash receipt and disbursement 
transactions in this chapter. However, the auditor’s assessment of inherent risk and control 
risk for transactions processed through the revenue and purchasing processes strongly affects 
the nature and extent of testing for the ending cash balance.
Stop and Think: Considering the inherent and control risk assessments for cash 
receipts and disbursements, what characteristics of cash increase inherent risk and how 
would this impact the substantive procedures? What effect does the control risk assess­
ment have on substantive testing for cash?

If the control risk assessment is below the maximum for both cash receipts and dis­
bursements, the auditor can reduce the extent of substantive evidence gathered for the cash 
balances.
Types of Bank Accounts
Cash management is an important function in all organizations. In order to optimize its cash 
flow, an entity implements procedures for accelerating the collection of cash receipts and 
delaying the payment of cash disbursements, to the extent delay is appropriate. Such proce­
dures allow the entity to earn interest on excess cash or to reduce the cost of cash borrowings.
Management must also be concerned with the control and safekeeping of cash. The use 
of different types of bank accounts aids in controlling the entity’s cash. The following types of 
bank accounts are typically used:
	
∙	 General cash account.
	
∙	 Imprest cash accounts.
	
∙	 Branch accounts.
It is important to understand each of the different types of bank accounts used. While the 
audit approach to each type of account is similar, the extent of testing varies from one account 
to the next. Each type of bank account is briefly discussed.
General Cash Account
The general cash account is the main cash account for most entities. The major source of cash 
receipts for this account is the revenue process, and the major sources of cash disbursements 
are the purchasing and human resource management processes. This cash account may also 
be used for receipts and disbursements from other bank accounts maintained by the entity. For 
many small entities, this is the only cash account maintained.
Imprest Cash Accounts
An imprest bank account contains a stipulated amount of money to be used for a specific pur­
pose. For example, separate imprest accounts are frequently used for disbursing payroll and 
dividend checks. In the case of payroll, a separate bank account is established for disbursing 
payroll. Prior to the disbursement of payroll to employees through check or direct deposit, 
funds sufficient to cover payroll are transferred from the general cash account to the payroll 
imprest account. The payroll is then drawn on this imprest account, which reduces the imprest 
account balance back to a specified minimum amount required to keep the account open and 
active with the bank. Thus, the payroll account serves as a clearing account for payroll pay­
ments and facilitates the disbursement of cash while also helping to maintain adequate control 
over cash.
Use of imprest accounts also minimizes the time required to reconcile the general cash 
account.
Branch Accounts
Companies that operate branches in multiple locations may maintain separate accounts at 
local banks. This allows each branch to pay local expenses and to maintain a banking relation­
ship in the local community. Branch cash accounts can be operated in a number of ways. In 
some cases, the branch accounts are nothing more than imprest accounts for branch payments 
in which a minimum balance is maintained. The branch submits periodic cash reports to head­
quarters, and the branch account receives a check or transfer from the general cash account. 
In other cases, the branch account functions as a general cash account by recording both cash 
receipts and cash disbursements.
LO 16-2

532	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
For proper control, the branch should be required to submit periodic cash reports to head­
quarters, and the entity’s management should carefully monitor the branch cash requests and 
account balances.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Management ordinarily uses a “sweep account” cash management strategy to transfer, on a nightly 
basis, any surplus cash in noninterest bearing commercial checking accounts to savings or money 
market accounts in order to earn higher returns on bank accounts.
Control Risk Assessment—Cash
The reliability of the entity’s controls over cash receipts and cash disbursements affects the 
nature and extent of the auditor’s tests of details. The preceding chapters discussed a number 
of important controls for both cash receipts and disbursements. For example, incoming checks 
are to be restrictively endorsed (stamped “For deposit only” to the company’s bank account), 
and daily cash receipts from customers are to be reconciled with postings to the accounts 
receivable subsidiary ledger. The effective operation of these controls provides strong evi­
dence that the completeness assertion is being met. Similarly, outgoing checks are to be 
signed only by authorized signers and only after all documents included in the voucher packet 
have been independently approved. The effective operation of this control activity provides 
the auditor with evidence on the authorization assertion.
A major control that directly affects the audit of cash is the completion of a monthly bank 
reconciliation by entity personnel who are independent of the handling and recording of cash 
receipts and cash disbursements. Such bank reconciliations ensure that the entity’s books 
reflect the same balance as the bank’s after reconciling items have been considered. Control 
can be improved further if an independent party such as the internal auditor reviews the bank 
reconciliation.
If the entity has good bank reconciliation procedures that are promptly performed, the 
auditor may choose to test the entity’s reconciliation procedures as part of testing controls and 
thereby reduce the audit work on the ending cash balance.
Substantive Procedures—Cash
Substantive Analytical Procedures—Cash
Because of its residual nature, cash does not have a predictable relationship with other finan­
cial statement accounts. As a result, the auditor’s use of substantive analytical procedures for 
auditing cash is typically limited to comparisons with prior years’ cash balances and to bud­
geted amounts. This limited applicability of substantive analytical procedures is normally off­
set by (1) extensive tests of controls and/or substantive tests of transactions for cash receipts 
and cash disbursements or (2) extensive tests of the entity’s bank reconciliations.
Substantive Tests of Details of Transactions and Balances—Cash
Table 16–1 contains examples of substantive tests of transactions for both cash receipts and 
cash disbursements. By testing both cash receipts and disbursements, the auditor obtains 
important evidence about the relevant assertions for the cash account. On most audits, the sub­
stantive tests of transactions for cash receipts and cash disbursements are conducted together 
with the tests of controls for the revenue and purchasing processes, respectively.
Balance-Related Assertions  Table 16–2 summarizes the assertions and tests of details 
of account balances for cash accounts. The rights and obligations assertion is not included in 
Table 16–2 because it is seldom important to the audit of the cash balance. The major audit

Chapter 16    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Cash and Investments	
533
procedures for each cash account involve tests of the bank reconciliation. The approach to 
auditing a bank reconciliation is basically the same regardless of the type of bank account 
being examined. However, the type and extent of the audit work are more detailed for the gen­
eral cash account because it normally represents a material amount and because of the large 
amount of activity in the account.
Auditing the General Cash Account
Table 16–2 shows that the main source of evidence for the existence, completeness, and val­
uation assertions is the audit work completed on the bank reconciliation. To audit a cash 
account, the auditor should obtain the following documents:
	
∙	 A copy of the bank reconciliation.
	
∙	 A standard form to confirm account balance information with financial institutions 
(referred to as a standard bank confirmation).
	
∙	 A cutoff bank statement.

Bank Reconciliation Working Paper  Exhibit 16–1 provides an example of a bank rec­
onciliation working paper for EarthWear’s general cash account. Note that the difference 
between the cash balance showed in Exhibit 16–1 and the balance in cash on the financial 
statements is represented by cash equivalents (Treasury bills and commercial paper). On most 
audits, the auditor obtains a copy of the bank reconciliation prepared by the entity’s person­
nel. The working paper reconciles the balance per the bank with the balance per the books. 
The major reconciling items are deposits in transit, outstanding checks, bank service charges, 
and a check returned because the customer did not have sufficient cash (i.e., an NSF check) in 
its account to cover payment of the check.
Standard Bank Confirmation Form  The auditor generally confirms account balance 
information with every bank or financial institution that maintains an account for the entity. 
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, American Bankers Association, and 
Bank Administration Institute have agreed on a standard format for confirming such infor­
mation. Exhibit 16–2 contains a completed copy of the confirmation form, which is titled 
“Standard Form to Confirm Account Balance Information with Financial Institutions.” This 
form is also used to obtain information about any loans the entity may have with the bank.
Bank confirmations provide third-party written evidence on bank account bal­
ances and other relevant information such as loans, lines of credit, security arrangements

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
about an entity’s arrangements with a financial institution, a separate confirmation letter 
signed by the entity should be sent to the official at the financial institution responsible 
for the entity’s accounts. Details regarding lines of credit and compensating balances are 
examples of information that might be confirmed in this manner. This issue is discussed 
later in this chapter.
Bank confirmation requests should be sent and received under the auditor’s control. The 
notorious and massive Parmalat fraud (see  Exhibit 16–3) perpetrated through a fictitious 
$4.9 billion bank confirmation highlights the importance of auditors properly controlling the 
confirmation process and applying a healthy dose of professional skepticism when evaluating 
audit evidence, even for large and seemingly reputable clients.
Rather than mailing standard bank confirmations, when auditing larger entities audi­
tors often work with a third-party provider of electronic confirmation services. These pro­
viders have direct and secure relationships with the banks and for a fee auditors are able to 
obtain the bank confirmation information they need. These confirmation services address 
many of the problems with paper-based bank confirmations, which include inefficiency 
in preparing, mailing, and remailing the request and more importantly the risk of fraud. 
Exhibit 16–4 outlines how electronic confirmations uncovered a fraud that had been going 
on for over 20 years.
Cutoff Bank Statement  A major step in auditing a bank reconciliation is verifying the 
propriety of the reconciling items such as deposits in transit and outstanding checks. The 
auditor obtains a cutoff bank statement to test the reconciling items included in the bank rec­
onciliation. A cutoff bank statement normally covers the 7- to 10-day period after the date on 
which the bank account is reconciled. Any reconciling item should have cleared the entity’s 
bank account during the 7- to 10-day period. The auditor obtains this cutoff bank statement 
by having the entity request that the bank send the statement, including canceled or electronic 
check images, directly to the auditor.
Parmalat’s $4.9 Billion Fictitious Bank Confirmation
After taking over his father’s food distribution business, Calisto Tanzi founded a small milk pasteurization 
company near Parma, Italy. Later named Parmalat Finanziaria S.p.A., the company gained notoriety by 
acquiring a Swedish pasteurization technology called ultra-high temperature (UHT). This process created 
the long-life milk product for which the company is best known.
Parmalat expanded its operations through acquisitions and, by the end of the 1990s, was the fourth 
largest food company in Europe, employing over 36,000 people in 30 countries; however, company 
expansion through acquisitions meant that Parmalat assumed a heavy debt burden.
Although Parmalat had a strong credit rating entering the 2000s, the business community began to 
question Parmalat’s decision not to pay down acquisition debt with the large amount of cash it had on 
hand. Suspicions increased when Parmalat was unable to make a £108 million bond payment. Parmalat 
officials claimed that the delay was caused by a temporary liquidity problem.
Shortly thereafter, Calisto Tanzi resigned as chairman and CEO. Following his resignation, allega­
tions arose that Parmalat had forged a Bank of America confirmation for $4.9 billion and sent it to the 
company’s auditors to corroborate the existence of cash. However, the cash did not exist. The forged 
confirmation was fuzzy and of poor quality because it is alleged that Parmalat officials ran the fake con­
firmation through the fax machine several times as part of its efforts to hide the fact that the document 
was a forgery.
Before the end of 2003, Parmalat had filed for bankruptcy and investigations began uncovering what 
appeared to be a large and intricate accounting fraud, which in the end was hidden by the company’s 
false cash deposits. Investors, creditors, and legal authorities immediately questioned the work per­
formed by the auditors.
The Parmalat case is a high-profile and painful example of a failure in the audit of cash and how impor­
tant it is to correctly verify cash balances. The Parmalat case demonstrates the importance of auditing 
standards regarding evidence and proper auditing procedures. The SEC’s Accounting and Auditing Enforce­
ment Release No. 1936, charging Parmalat with fraud, is available on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov.

Tests of the Bank Reconciliation  The auditor typically uses the following audit proce­
dures to test the bank reconciliation:
	
1.	 Verify the mathematical accuracy of the bank reconciliation working paper and 
agree the balance per the books to the general ledger. In Exhibit 16–1, the working 
paper has been footed and the balance per the books as shown on the reconciliation 
has been agreed to the general ledger.
	
2.	 Agree the bank balance on the bank reconciliation with the balance shown on the 
standard bank confirmation. The bank confirmation shown in Exhibit 16–2 has 
been prepared so that it corresponds to the bank reconciliation in Exhibit 16–1. The 
$1,854,890 shown on the bank reconciliation has been agreed to the $1,854,890 
balance shown on the bank confirmation in Exhibit 16–2.
	
3.	 Trace the deposits in transit on the bank reconciliation to the cutoff bank statement. 
Any deposit in transit shown on the bank reconciliation should be listed as a deposit 
shortly after the end of the period. The tick mark next to the deposits in transit shown 
in Exhibit 16–1 indicates that the deposits were traced by the auditor to the cutoff 
bank statement.
	
4.	 Compare the outstanding checks on the bank reconciliation working paper with the 
canceled (or substitute) checks contained in the cutoff bank statement for proper

included as outstanding checks on the bank reconciliation. The tick mark next to the 
outstanding checks shown in Exhibit 16–1 indicates that the checks were traced by 
the auditor to the cutoff bank statement and that the canceled (or substitute) checks 
were examined for propriety.

Newly hired auditors are often assigned to audit cash accounts because cash is typically consid­
ered a lower-risk audit area. However, similar to the fraud at Parmalat (see Exhibit 16–3), a mas­
sive accounting fraud involving fictitious cash deposits at Satyam Computer Systems, New Delhi, 
India, was concealed because the auditors did not properly control the bank confirmation process. 
For noncompliance with PCAOB auditing standards, the Indian affiliate to PricewaterhouseCoopers 
International Limited was sanctioned and fined $1.5 million by the PCAOB and $6.0 million by the 
SEC (see Chapter 20 for additional discussion on the Satyam case).
Electronic Bank Confirmation Uncovers $215 Million Fraud
Within 24 hours of a regulatory mandate to use an electronic confirmation service, PFGBest, a commodity 
brokerage unit of Peregrine Financial Group, Inc., was exposed as a multi-year $215 million fraud. Brian 
Fox, founder of Confirmation.com, said, “PFGBest is a sadly common example of how easily bank and 
account information can be falsified to evade detection of accounting frauds. This is a textbook case of 
how easy it is to use false mailing addresses and fax machines to conceal massive theft and fraud.” The 
CEO of PFGBest, Russell Wasendorf, admitted to committing fraud and embezzling the funds. He created 
false bank statements and maintained a post office box that he used to receive the auditor’s standard 
bank confirmation, which he then returned with forged official bank signatures. To conceal the fraud, 
Wasendorf insisted that all bank mailings and correspondence come directly to him unopened, and only 
he had access to the actual account information online. When the fraud was revealed, Wasendorf unsuc­
cessfully attempted suicide and PFGBest filed for bankruptcy.

Fraud-Related Audit Procedures
If the entity does not have adequate controls over cash or the auditor suspects that some type 
of fraud or defalcation involving cash has occurred, it may be necessary to extend the normal 
cash audit procedures. Although many types of fraud, such as forgery or collusion, are dif­
ficult to detect, auditing standards indicate that the auditor has a responsibility to plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are 
free of material misstatement, whether caused by error or fraud.
Three audit procedures that auditors typically use to detect fraudulent activities in the 
cash accounts are
	
∙	 Extended bank reconciliation procedures.
	
∙	 Proof of cash.
	
∙	 Tests for kiting.
Extended Bank Reconciliation Procedures  In some instances, an unscrupulous client 
might use the year-end bank reconciliation to cover cash defalcations. This is usually accom­
plished by manipulating the reconciling items in the bank reconciliation. For example, sup­
pose an entity employee stole $5,000 from the entity. The entity’s cash balance at the bank 
would then be $5,000 less than reported on the entity’s books. The employee could hide the 
$5,000 shortage in the bank reconciliation by including a fictitious deposit in transit. Thus, 
the typical approach to searching for possible fraud is to extend the bank reconciliation pro­
cedures to examine the disposition of the reconciling items included on the prior months’ 
reconciliations and the reconciling items included in the current bank reconciliation.
For example, assume that the auditor suspected that some type of fraud had been com­
mitted. The auditor would examine the November and December bank reconciliations by 
ensuring that all reconciling items had been properly handled. For deposits in transit on the 
November bank reconciliation, the auditor would trace the deposits to the November cash 
receipts journal to verify that they were recorded. The deposits would also be traced to the 
December bank statement to verify that they were deposited in the bank. Checks listed as 
outstanding on the November bank reconciliation would be traced to the November cash dis­
bursements journal, and the canceled or substitute checks returned with the December bank 
statement would be examined for propriety. Other reconciling items such as bank charges, 
NSF checks, and collections of notes by the bank similarly would be traced to the accounting 
records for proper treatment. The auditor would examine the reconciling items included on 
the December bank reconciliation in a similar fashion to ensure that such items were not being 
used to cover a cash defalcation. Further investigation would be required for any reconciling 
items not properly accounted for. The entity’s management should be informed if the auditor 
detects any fraudulent transactions.
Proof of Cash  A proof of cash is used to reconcile the cash receipts and disbursements 
recorded on the entity’s books with the cash deposited into and disbursed from the entity’s 
bank account for a specific time period. Exhibit 16–5 presents an example of a proof of cash 
for Calabro Wireless Services for one month, although on some audits a proof of cash is per­
formed for the entire period under audit. Because the proof contains four columns, a proof of 
cash is commonly referred to as a four-column proof of cash. The four columns include
	
∙	 A bank reconciliation for the beginning of the period.
	
∙	 A reconciliation of the cash deposited in the bank with the cash receipts recorded in 
the cash receipts journal.
LO 16-6

	
Chapter 16    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Cash and Investments	
539
	
∙	 A reconciliation of the cash disbursed through the bank account with the cash 
disbursements recorded in the cash disbursements journal.
	
∙	 A bank reconciliation for the end of the period.
The primary purposes of the proof of cash are (1) to ensure that all cash receipts recorded 
in the entity’s cash receipts journal were deposited in the entity’s bank account, (2) to ensure 
that all cash disbursements recorded in the entity’s cash disbursements journal have cleared 
the entity’s bank account, and (3) to ensure that no bank transactions have been omitted 
from the entity’s accounting records. The reader should note that a proof of cash will not 
detect a theft of cash when the cash was stolen before it was recorded in the entity’s books. 
If the auditor suspects that cash was stolen without being recorded in the entity’s books, the 
audit procedures discussed under the completeness assertion for cash receipt transactions in 
Chapter 10 should be performed.

INSIGHT
Skimming is the removal of cash from an organization prior to its entry in an accounting system. 
Lapping is one of the most common forms of concealing a skimming scheme. As discussed in 
Chapter 10, lapping occurs when the perpetrator covers the cash shortage by applying cash from 
one customer’s account against another customer’s account. The perpetrator then eliminates the 
shortage in the accounting records by recording credit memos or write-offs. Thus, to detect lap­
ping, auditors would review the journal entries involving write-offs and credit memos as well as any 
irregular entries to the cash accounts.
Tests for Kiting  When cash has been stolen by an employee, sometimes the employee will 
attempt to cover the cash shortage by following a practice known as kiting. This involves an 
employee covering the cash shortage by transferring money from one bank account to another 
and recording the transactions improperly on the entity’s books. The employee does this by

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
preparing a check on one account before year-end but not recording it as a cash disbursement 
in the account until the next period (paper checks are still commonly used, particularly by 
small businesses). The check is deposited and recorded as a cash receipt in a second account 
before year-end. The employee makes this deposit close enough to year-end that the check 
will not clear the first bank account before the end of the year. While electronic wire transfers 
are recorded more rapidly than paper transactions, there is often still a one-day delay, which 
makes kiting possible even without the use of paper checks.
One approach that auditors commonly use to test for kiting is the preparation of an inter­
bank transfer schedule such as the one shown in Exhibit 16–6. This exhibit provides six exam­
ples of the types of cash transfers an auditor might encounter. For example, transfer 2 is an 
example of a proper cash transfer. A check was drawn on the disbursing bank account and 
recorded as a cash disbursement on December 30. It was recorded as a cash receipt in the 
receiving bank account on December 30 and deposited in that account on December 31. The 
check cleared the disbursing account on January 2. The auditor would examine this transfer 
by tracing the check to the December cash disbursements and cash receipts journals and to the 
December 31 bank reconciliation. Because the check cleared the bank on January 2, it should 
be listed as an outstanding check on the December 31 bank reconciliation for the disbursing 
bank account.
Stop and Think: Referring to Exhibit 16–6, which transfers appear to be proper? Do 
you see any that represent an example of kiting?
You will notice that transfers 1, 3, and 6 are proper cash transfers and transfer 4 repre­
sents an example of kiting. A check was written on the disbursing bank account before year-
end, but the disbursement was not recorded in the disbursements journal until after year-end 
(January 2). The check was deposited in the receiving bank account and recorded as a cash 
receipt before year-end. Thus, the cash shortage in the receiving bank account is covered by 
a cash deposit from the disbursing bank account, and the net effect is that cash is overstated 
by $10,000. As noted in Exhibit 16–6, transfer 5 is also improper in that a deposit was made

* Explanation for each transfer in determining proper cash cutoff at 12/31:
1.  The transfer was made on December 28 and recorded on the books as both a receipt and a disbursement on the same date. The check written was 
deposited on December 28 in the receiving bank account and credited on the bank statement the next day. The check cleared the disbursing bank 
account on December 30. All dates are in the same accounting period, so there are no questions as to the propriety of the cutoff.
2.  This transfer is proper. However, the transfer check should appear as an outstanding check on the reconciliation of the disbursing bank account.
3.  Transfer 3 is also proper. In this example, the transfer should appear as a deposit in transit on the reconciliation of the receiving bank account and as an 
outstanding check on the reconciliation of the disbursing bank account.
4.  This transfer represents kiting because the receipt was recorded on the books in the period prior to that in which the corresponding disbursement was 
recorded. Cash is overstated by $10,000.
5.  Transfer 5 is also improper. In this case a deposit was made in the receiving bank in one period without the receipt being made in the books until the 
subsequent period. Unless this matter is explained on the reconciliation for the receiving bank, the transfer was apparently made to temporarily cover a 
shortage in that account. While the shortage will become apparent in the accounts as soon as the transfer is recorded in the following period, it will be 
covered by an unrecorded deposit on the balance sheet date.

INSIGHT
According to a recent report produced by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners 
(www.acfe.com), fraudulent cash disbursements can be divided into five distinct subcategories:
 • Billing schemes, where an individual causes the organization to issue a payment by submitting 
invoices for fictitious goods or services, inflated invoices, or invoices for personal purchases.
 • Payroll schemes, where an employee causes the organization to issue a payment by making 
false claims for compensation.
 • Expense reimbursement scheme, where an employee makes a claim for reimbursement of ficti­
tious or inflated business expenses.
 • Check tampering, where the perpetrator converts an organization’s funds by forging or altering 
a check on one of the organization’s bank accounts or steals a check the organization has legiti­
mately issued to another payee.
 • Register disbursement schemes, where an employee makes false entries on a cash register to 
conceal the fraudulent removal of currency.
In some instances an interbank transfer schedule is used even though control activities 
are adequate and no fraud is suspected. When an entity maintains many cash accounts, cash 
transfers may be inadvertently mishandled. The use of an interbank transfer schedule provides 
the auditor with evidence on the proper cutoff for cash transactions.
Auditing a Payroll or Branch Imprest Account
The audit of any imprest cash account such as payroll or a branch account follows the same 
basic audit steps discussed under the audit of the general cash account. The auditor obtains 
a bank reconciliation, along with a standard bank confirmation and a cutoff bank statement. 
However, the audit testing is less extensive for two reasons. First, the imprest balance in the 
account is generally not material. For example, an imprest payroll or branch account may 
contain a minimum balance, of say $100, required by the bank to keep the account open and 
active except for the short time after a payroll deposit and before the related payroll disburse­
ments have cleared. Second, the types of disbursements from the account are homogeneous. 
The checks are for similar types of transactions and for relatively small amounts. For example, 
there are often limits on the size of an individual payroll check.
Auditing a Petty Cash Fund
Most entities maintain a petty cash fund for paying certain types of expenses or transactions. 
Although the balance in the fund is not material (hence the word “petty”), there is a potential 
for defalcation because an entity’s employee may be able to process numerous fraudulent 
transactions through the fund over the course of a year. External auditors seldom perform sub­
stantive procedures on the petty cash fund, except when fraud is suspected. Internal auditors 
(see Chapter 21) often do document and perform testing of the controls over the petty cash 
fund. For smaller entities without an internal audit function, the external auditors may also 
perform limited testing of controls over petty cash.
Common controls over petty cash involve the use of prenumbered petty cash vouchers for 
withdrawing cash from the fund, and a limit should be placed on the size of reimbursements 
made from petty cash. Periodically, the petty cash fund is reimbursed from the general cash 
account. Accounts payable clerks should review the vouchers for propriety before replenish­
ing the petty cash fund. Finally, someone independent of the cash function should conduct 
surprise counts of the petty cash fund.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Disclosure Issues for Cash
The auditor must consider a number of important financial statement disclosures when audit­
ing cash. Some of the more common disclosure issues are shown in Table 16–3. The audi­
tor’s review of the minutes of board of directors’ meetings, line-of-credit arrangements, loan 
agreements, and similar documents is the primary source of the information for the financial 
statement disclosures. In addition, the auditor typically confirms items such as compensating 
balances required under a bank line of credit.
Exhibit 16–7 illustrates a letter for confirmation of compensating balances, while 
Exhibit 16–8 presents an example of footnote disclosures for compensating balances.

In connection with an audit of the financial statements of Calabro Wireless Services as of December 31, 2015, and for the year then ended, 
we have advised our independent auditors that as of the close of business on December 31, 2015, there were compensating balance 
arrangements as described in our agreement dated June 30, 2011. Withdrawal by Calabro Wireless Services of the compensating balance 
was not legally restricted as of December 31, 2015. The terms of the compensating balance arrangements at December 31, 2015, were:
The company has been expected to maintain a compensating balance, as determined from your bank’s ledger records without adjust­
ment for estimated average uncollected funds, of 15% of its outstanding loans plus 10% of its unused line of credit.
The company was in compliance with, and there have been no changes in, the compensating balance arrangements during the year 
ended December 31, 2015, and subsequently through the date of this letter.
During the year ended December 31, 2015, and subsequently through the date of this letter, no compensating balances were main­
tained by the company at your bank on behalf of an affiliate, director, officer, or any other third party, and no third party maintained com­
pensating balances at the bank on behalf of the company.
Please confirm whether the information about compensating balances presented above is correct by signing below and returning this

Chapter 16    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Cash and Investments	
543
Entities frequently invest in securities of other entities. Such investments might include equity 
securities such as common and preferred stock, debt securities such as notes and bonds, and 
hybrid securities such as convertible bonds and stocks. The accounting for such instruments 
is affected by factors such as the percentage of the other entity owned, the degree of influence 
exercised over the entity, the classification of the investment as a current or noncurrent asset, 
fair-value considerations, and a myriad of other factors. For example, FASB ASC Topic 320, 
“Investments—Debt and Equity Securities,” provides detailed guidance on how to account 
for investments in certain debt and equity securities. The Advanced Module at the end of this 
chapter discusses auditing fair value measurements.
On a general level, the auditor’s consideration of investments is no different than for any 
other financial statement account. That is, the auditor must be assured that the amounts shown 
on the balance sheet for the various types of investments are not materially misstated. This 
includes the proper recognition of interest income, dividends, and changes in value that must 
be included in the financial statements.
The inherent risks associated with investments vary with the amount of activity, the com­
plexity, and valuation considerations. For example, an investment in stock of a publicly traded 
company is relatively easy to account for and audit. However, more complex financial instru­
ments, such as derivatives and asset-backed securities, have become increasingly common 
holdings in investment portfolios. These complex financial instruments require substantial 
subjective judgments by management in the value of inputs used to determine fair values as of 
the reporting dates. It is not uncommon for the reasonable range of estimation uncertainty to 
be very large.1 Due to the judgment and complexity associated with these types of financial 
instruments, the auditor is likely to assess the inherent risk as high.
For an entity that has a large investment portfolio, the auditor is likely to follow a reliance 
strategy in which internal control is formally evaluated and tests of controls are performed in 
order to set control risk below the maximum. However, for the vast majority of entities that 
do not require an audit of internal control over financial reporting, it is more efficient for the 
auditor to follow a substantive strategy and perform a detailed audit of the investment securi­
ties at year-end.
LO 16-7
1Academic research has demonstrated that the range of irreducible uncertainty can be many times larger than overall 
materiality. See B. Christensen, S. Glover, and D. Wood, “Extreme Estimation Uncertainty in Fair Value and Other 
Estimates: The Implications for Audit Assurance,” Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory, 2012, Vol. 31, No. 1.

Control Risk Assessment—Investments
The discussion of investments that follows focuses on the general types of control activities

On December 31, 2011, the company established a line of credit with a bank that provides for unsecured 
borrowings of $7,000,000 at the bank’s prime rate (7% at December 31, 2015). At December 31, 2014 
and 2015, $200,000 and $800,000, respectively, had been borrowed under this arrangement. Under the 
credit arrangement, the company is expected to maintain compensating balances equal to 5 percent of 
the borrowings in excess of $500,000. This requirement is generally met through normal operating cash 
balances, which are not restricted as to withdrawal.

procedures. The main assertions that concern the auditor are occurrence, authorization, com­
pleteness, accuracy, and classification. Proper segregation of duties is important in ensuring 
the propriety of investments and will be discussed briefly.
Assertions and Related Control Activities
Following are some of the more common controls that should be present for each of the 
important assertions for investments.
Occurrence and Authorization  Controls must ensure that the purchase or sale of any 
investment is properly initiated by authorized individuals. First, the entity should have ade­
quate documents to verify that a particular purchase or sale of a security was properly initi­
ated and approved. The presence of adequate documentation allows the auditor to determine 
the validity of the transaction. Second, the commitment of resources to investment activities 
should be approved by the board of directors or by an executive who has been delegated this 
authority. An entity engaging in recurring investment activities should have an entity-wide 
general investment policy as well as specific procedures and control activities around indi­
vidual investment transactions. The board of directors should establish general policies to 
guide the entity’s investment activities, while the specific procedures for the purchase and 
sale of securities may be delegated to an individual executive, an investment committee, or 
outside investment advisers. If the entity has proper controls for initiating and authorizing 
securities transactions, it is generally easy for the auditor to verify security transactions at the 
end of the period.
Completeness  The entity should maintain adequate controls to ensure that all securities 
transactions are recorded, and the auditor should evaluate the design and operating effective­
ness of the entity’s controls. One control for handling the detailed securities transactions is 
maintenance of a securities ledger that records all securities owned by the entity. The entity 
should reconcile the subsidiary ledger to the general ledger control account regularly. Person­
nel responsible for investment activities should periodically review the securities owned to 
ensure that all dividends and interest have been received and recorded in the entity’s records.
Accuracy and Classification  Some important accuracy and classification issues are 
related to investment securities. As mentioned previously, ASC Topic 320 addresses account­
ing and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair val­
ues and for all investments in debt securities. The standard requires that those investments be 
classified in three categories and accounted for as follows:
	
∙	 Debt securities that the entity has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity 
are classified as held-to-maturity securities and reported at amortized cost.
	
∙	 Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of 
selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair 
value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.
	
∙	 Debt or equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity or trading 
securities are classified as available-for-sale securities and are reported at fair 
value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other 
comprehensive income until realized.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Scholars examining public company financial statements have found evidence suggesting that com­
panies realize gains and losses on available-for-sale securities to smooth earnings. A company can 
also manipulate financial statements by intentionally misclassifying securities or transferring securi­
ties to a different class of investment. For example, a company might transfer a security from held-to-
maturity to trading, which would trigger the recognition of a gain or a loss.

	
Chapter 16    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Cash and Investments	
545
The entity’s controls should ensure that securities are properly classified and that appro­
priate prices are used to accurately value investments for financial statement purposes.
One final issue related to the control risk for investments is that the entity should have 
adequate custodial procedures to safeguard against theft. When securities are held by the 
entity, they should be stored in a safe or safe-deposit box. Procedures should provide for peri­
odic inspections by an individual independent of both the custodial and accounting respon­
sibilities for securities. If an independent custodian such as a broker maintains securities, the 
entity needs to establish procedures for authorizing the transfer of securities. For example, 
one approach would require dual authorization by appropriate management personnel.
Segregation of Duties
Table 16–4 contains some key segregation of duties for investments and examples of possible 
errors or fraud that can result from conflicts in duties. However, only entities that engage in 
a significant number of investment activities are likely to have adequate segregation of duties 
for all investment activities. When some of the duties noted in Table 16–4 are not segregated, 
the entity should have other compensating controls such as a regular review by a person in a 
higher level of management of the performance of the duty not segregated.
LO 16-9
Key Segregation of Duties for Investments and Possible Errors or Fraud
Segregation of Duties
Possible Errors or Fraud Resulting from Conflicts of Duties
The initiation function should be segregated 
from the final approval function.
If one individual is responsible for both the initiating and approving of securities transactions, 
fictitious transactions can be made or securities can be stolen.
The valuation-monitoring function should be 
segregated from the acquisition function.
If one individual is responsible for both acquiring securities and monitoring their valuation, 
securities values can be improperly recorded or not reported to management.
Responsibility for maintaining the securities 
ledger should be separate from that of 
making entries in the general ledger.
If one individual is responsible for both the securities ledger and the general ledger entries, 
that individual can conceal any defalcation that would normally be detected by reconciliation 
of subsidiary records with general ledger control accounts.
Responsibility for custody of the securities 
should be separate from that of accounting 
for the securities.
If one individual has access both to securities and to the supporting accounting records, a theft 
of the securities can be concealed.
T A B L E  1 6 – 4
Substantive Procedures—Investments
As discussed earlier, it is generally more efficient to follow a substantive strategy for auditing 
investments. When the control risk is set at the maximum, the auditor conducts extensive sub­
stantive procedures to reach the planned level of detection risk. Additionally, because of the 
nature of the audit work due to relatively few transactions and/or the availability of third party 
investment records, tests of details of transactions are seldom used as a source of evidence.
Substantive Analytical Procedures—Investments
Substantive analytical procedures such as the following can be used to evaluate the overall 
reasonableness of investments and related income statement accounts:
	
∙	 Comparison of the balances in the current year’s investment accounts with prior

Tests of Details—Investments
Auditing standards provide guidance concerning substantive auditing procedures the auditor 
can perform when gathering evidence related to assertions for investments. Table 16–5 sum­
marizes the audit procedures performed on the investment account for balance and presenta­
tion and disclosure assertions. The discussion of the investment account audit procedures 
focuses on the more important assertions. The procedures shown for the other assertions 
should be familiar to you.
Existence  Auditing standards state that the auditor should perform one or more of the fol­
lowing audit procedures when gathering evidence for existence:
	
∙	 Physical examination.
	
∙	 Confirmation with the issuer.
	
∙	 Confirmation with the custodian.
	
∙	 Confirmation of unsettled transactions with the broker-dealer.
	
∙	 Confirmation with the counterparty.
	
∙	 Reading executed partnership or similar agreements.
If the entity maintains custody of the securities, the auditor normally examines the securi­
ties. During the physical count, the auditor should note the name, class and description, serial 
number, maturity date, registration in the name of the entity, interest rates or dividend pay­
ment dates, and other relevant information about the various securities. The auditor should 
insist that a representative of the entity be present during the physical inspection of securities 
in order to acknowledge that all securities inspected are returned. If the securities are held in 
a safe-deposit box and the auditor is unable to inspect and count the securities on the balance 
sheet date, the auditor should consider having the bank seal the safe-deposit box until the 
auditor can count the securities at a later date. When the securities are held by an issuer or a 
custodian such as a broker or investment adviser, the auditor gathers sufficient, appropriate 
evidence for the existence assertion by confirming the existence of the securities. The informa­
tion contained in the confirmation needs to be reconciled with the entity’s investment records.

Valuation and Allocation  When securities are initially purchased, they are recorded at 
their acquisition cost. The auditor can verify the purchase price of a security by examining a 
broker’s invoice or similar document. Debt securities that are to be held to maturity should be 
valued at their amortized cost. The auditor should have verified the purchase price of the debt 
at the time of purchase, and the effective interest rate should be used to recognize the interest 
income, which the auditor can recompute. The fair value of most equity securities is available 
from securities exchanges registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or on the 
over-the-counter market. The auditor can verify these values by tracing them to sources such 
as brokers, The Wall Street Journal, or other reliable financial publications.
Some investments do not have fair values that can be readily obtained from market data 
and thus require substantial judgment on the part of management. Auditing of fair value mea­
surement is covered in the Advanced Module at the end of this chapter.
The auditor must also determine if there has been any other than temporary changes to 
the fair value of the investment security. The following factors are indicators that the value 
decline of the investment may be other than temporary.
	
∙	 Fair value is significantly below cost.
	
∙	 The decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting a 
particular investment.
	
∙	 The decline in fair value is attributable to specific conditions, such as conditions in an 
industry or in a geographic area.
	
∙	 Management does not possess both the intent and the ability to hold the investment 
long enough to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
	
∙	 The decline in fair value has existed for an extended period.
	
∙	 A debt security has been downgraded by a rating agency.
	
∙	 The financial condition of the issuer has deteriorated.
	
∙	 Dividends have been reduced or eliminated, or scheduled interest payments on debt 
securities have not been made.
If the investment value is determined to be other than temporarily impaired, the secu­
rity should be written down and a new carrying amount established. Last, the auditor should 
examine the sale of any security to ensure that proper values were used to record the sale and 
any realized gain or loss.
Disclosure Assertions  Two issues are important when the auditor examines the proper 
classification of investments. First, marketable securities need to be properly classified as 
held-to-maturity, trading, or available-for-sale because both the balance sheet and income 
statement are affected by misclassification. Second, the financial statement classification 
requires that all trading securities be reported as current assets. Held-to-maturity securities 
and individual available-for-sale securities should be classified as current or noncurrent assets 
based on whether management expects to convert them to cash within the next 12 months. If 
the security is expected to be converted to cash within 12 months, it should be classified as a 
current asset. The auditor should ask management about its plans to sell securities.
Auditing standards also guide auditors in evaluating both management’s intent with 
regard to an investment and the entity’s ability to hold a debt security to maturity. In evaluat­
ing management’s intent, the auditor should consider whether investment activities corrobo­
rate or conflict with management’s stated intent. The auditor should examine evidence such 
as written and approved records of investment strategies, records of investment activities, 
instructions to portfolio managers, and minutes of meetings of the board of directors or the 
investment committee. In evaluating an entity’s ability to hold a debt security to maturity, 
the auditor should consider factors such as the entity’s financial position, working capital 
needs, operating results, debt agreements, guarantees, and other relevant contractual obliga­
tions, as well as laws and regulations. The auditor should also consider operating and cash 
flow projections or forecasts when considering the entity’s ability to hold the debt security 
to maturity.

548	
Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
ASC Topic 320 requires specific disclosures for securities. For example, the aggregate 
fair value and gross unrealized holding gains or losses on securities should be presented for 
available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities.
Most of the information necessary for such disclosures is developed as the other asser­
tions are being tested. In addition, the amount of any securities pledged as collateral should 
be disclosed. To collect such information, the auditor might inquire of management, review 
the board of directors’ minutes, and examine loan agreements and other relevant documents.
Advanced Module: Auditing Fair Value Measurements
FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with 
GAAP. It defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement 
date. Because orderly transactions between market participants may or may not be observable 
at the measurement date, FASB ASC Topic 820 provides a hierarchy with three levels that 
distinguish the types of inputs used to value different types of assets and liabilities at their 
appropriate fair values:
	
∙	 Level 1: Valuations are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets 
or liabilities. Sometimes called “marking to market,” valuations in this category 
typically apply to assets such as publicly traded stocks, options, bonds, and 
mutual funds.
	
∙	 Level 2: Valuations are based on directly or indirectly observable market data for 
similar or comparable assets or liabilities. Sometimes called “marking to matrix,” 
Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets 
or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (interest 
rates, standard deviation, default rates, etc.). Examples of assets in this category 
include infrequently traded bonds and some mortgage and asset-based securities.
	
∙	 Level 3: Valuations are based on management’s best judgment and involve 
management’s assumptions about how the market would price an asset or liability 
where the inputs are unobservable because there is little or no active market for the 
asset or liability being valued. Sometimes called “marking to model,” valuation in 
this category may include assets such as long-term options, real estate, and private-
equity investments.
An individual fair value measurement, such as an employee stock option, may contain 
inputs from one or all of the three levels, but the measurement in its entirety is categorized 
based on the lowest level of its significant inputs. For example, the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model requires the exercise price, stock price, length of time until option expires, 
stock price volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free rate as inputs. Some of these inputs, such 
as stock price, may be quoted in active markets and would be Level 1 inputs. However, other 
inputs, such as stock price volatility, are not likely Level 1 inputs as the volatility requires an 
estimate based on historical data over a period of time, which may or may not be expected to 
be representative of the future. Therefore, stock price volatility would likely be categorized as 
either a Level 2 or Level 3 input, depending on the availability of similar or comparable vola­
tility data and estimates. Thus, the employee stock options as a whole would be categorized 
as either a Level 2 or Level 3 fair value measurement, consistent with the lowest level of input 
in categorizing the asset.
Stop and Think: How would the different fair value levels affect planned audit 
procedures? How would an audit plan for an entity whose financial instruments are 
mostly Level 1 be different from that for an entity whose financial instruments are mostly 
Level 2 or Level 3?
LO 16-11

	
Chapter 16    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Cash and Investments	
549
As preparers and auditors consider the implications of using the different fair value levels 
to value assets and liabilities, moving from Level 1’s objective market-driven inputs to 
Level 2 or 3 inputs means objective measures are replaced with increasingly subjective inputs, 
some based on management’s assumptions. Complicated financial instruments, such as credit 
default swaps, asset-backed securities, and collateralized debt obligations, among others, 
often are not traded on active markets, making accurate valuation of such instruments diffi­
cult. The valuation of assets and liabilities, and the related income statement effect of reduc­
tions in fair value, can have material implications for amounts reported in the financial 
statements.2 As a result, gathering sufficient, appropriate evidence to support the entity’s fair 
value measurements and related disclosures is an increasingly important—and risky—area of 
many audits.
As an example of how fair value measurements can materially impact an audit, let’s return 
to our example of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Assume the following information 
concerning the audit of a successful entity in the computer and technology sector:
	
∙	 Income before tax: $700 million.
	
∙	 Overall materiality at 5 percent of net income before taxes: $35 million.
	
∙	 Tolerable misstatement applied to stock compensation expense: $26.25 million.
	
∙	 The company has 7 million options outstanding at the end of the year.
ASC Topic 718 requires that the expense for employee stock options be reported at fair 
value. One way to estimate the fair value of the expense is to use the Black-Scholes option-
pricing model. Continuing our example, the following values have been determined for the 
model’s inputs:
	
∙	 Stock price at valuation date: $130.
	
∙	 Exercise price: $140.
	
∙	 Dividend yield: 0.00 percent.
	
∙	 Time until expiration: 10 years.
	
∙	 Risk-free rate: 3.8 percent.
	
∙	 Volatility of stock price: between 36 and 40 percent.
If management decides to calculate stock compensation expense based on the lower 
stock-price volatility, the model provides an expense equal to $471.1 million. However, if 
management were to use the higher range of volatility, the model provides an expense equal 
to $502.9 million. The difference between the two estimates is $31.8 million, which is greater 
than the tolerable misstatement applied to the account and almost as large as overall material­
ity for the entire engagement. This example demonstrates the significant impact that small 
changes in assumptions in fair value–measurement models can have on the financial state­
ments. It also highlights the difficulty preparers and auditors are in when evaluating the fair­
ness of the reported amount of option expense.
In this module, we briefly cover four important areas in the auditing of fair value mea­
surements from the more complete guidance provided AU-C 540, Auditing Accounting Esti­
mates, Including Fair Value Accounting Estimates and Related Disclosures.
	
∙	 Obtaining an understanding of how management makes fair value measurements.
	
∙	 Considering whether specialized skills or knowledge are required.
	
∙	 Testing the entity’s fair value measurements.
	
∙	 Evaluating the reasonableness of the fair value measurements.
2For example, the reasonable range of estimation uncertainty associated with some estimates can be larger than 
overall materiality. See B. Christensen, S. Glover, and D. Wood, “Extreme Estimation Uncertainty in Fair Value 
and Other Estimates: The Implications for Audit Assurance,” Auditing: A Journal of Practice & Theory, 2012,  
Vol. 31, No. 1.

Part 5    Auditing Business Processes
Understanding How Management Makes Fair Value Measurements
In order to plan the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures associated with auditing 
fair value measurements, the auditor gains an understanding of the entity’s process for deter­
mining fair value measurements and disclosures and of the relevant controls by considering 
factors such as
	
∙	 The types of accounts or transactions requiring fair value measurements.
	
∙	 The nature of the assumptions, including which of the assumptions are likely to be 
significant assumptions.
	
∙	 How management considered the nature of the asset or liability being valued, 
including how and why they selected a particular valuation method or model.
	
∙	 Whether the entity operates in a particular industry where specific models are 
commonly used for fair value measurement.
	
∙	 The extent to which the entity’s process relies on a service organization to provide 
fair value measurements.
	
∙	 The nature and extent of documentation, if any, supporting management’s assumptions.
	
∙	 The controls related to the review and approval of accounting estimates (including 
the assumptions or inputs used in their development) by appropriate levels of 
management and, where appropriate, those charged with governance.
	
∙	 The controls over how management determines the completeness, relevance, and 
accuracy of the data used to develop accounting estimates.
As the risk and complexity of the fair value measurements increase, so also does the 
extent of the audit procedures.
Considering Whether Specialized Skills or Knowledge Is Required
Auditors must have a good understanding of the accounting and auditing frameworks associ­
ated with fair value measurements, but it is not realistic to expect all auditors to be experts 
in the area of valuation. A valuation specialist is often engaged to help obtain audit evidence 
when the valuation model used by management is complex, the markets for the asset or liabil­
ity are not currently active, or a high degree of estimation uncertainty exists. We discussed 
the use of specialists in Chapter 3, and auditing standards address the use of specialists in 
AU-C 620, Using the Work of an Auditor’s Specialist.
Testing the Entity’s Fair Value Measurements
Based on the understanding of management’s processes and the risk assessment, auditors 
plan the nature, timing, and extent of the testing. Substantive tests of fair value measure­
ments for Level 1 assets or liabilities, such as publicly traded stocks and bonds, is relatively 
straightforward, as market pricing can be easily verified by the auditor by, for example, 
corroborating closing stock prices with prices published in The Wall Street Journal. Sub­
stantive audit procedures for Level 2 or Level 3 valuations, such as complicated derivatives, 
may include
	
∙	 Testing whether the assumptions appropriately reflect observable market assumptions.
	
∙	 Testing management’s assumptions for bias.
	
∙	 Performing sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of changes in the assumptions 
on a fair value estimate.
	
∙	 Testing whether management’s rationale for the method selected is reasonable.
	
∙	 Testing that the underlying data used in the valuation model are accurate, complete, 
and relevant.
	
∙	 Developing an independent point estimate or range for corroborative purposes.
	
∙	 Reviewing subsequent events and transactions.

	
Chapter 16    Auditing the Financing/Investing Process: Cash and Investments	
551
In testing the models used by management, it is important for auditors to understand the 
inherent weaknesses of valuation models. As opposed to active markets, valuation models do 
not take qualitative factors into account when creating a fair value.
Qualitative factors include an assessment of how active the market is and whether current 
exit prices should be used to value a security an entity intends to hold. Models are tools used 
to capture and evaluate complex and uncertain inputs to derive estimated fair values, but they 
have limitations. Uncertainty arises for a variety of reasons, including the length of forecast 
and the subjectivity and complexity associated with the factors in the model. Given the inher­
ent uncertainty in the inputs, valuation models rarely provide the “correct” or exact value and 
should be viewed as providing a range of reasonable values, all of which should be considered 
in light of other industry and market information.
Stop and Think: What do you think are some qualitative factors that would impact the 
valuation of an asset-backed security (such as a bundle of home mortgages discussed in 
Exhibit 15–1)?
Further, auditors must test management’s assumptions for bias, which can be difficult to 
detect at the account level. Such bias may be identified only by considering management’s 
accounting estimates in aggregate or the accuracy of past estimates over a number of account­
ing periods. Although some degree of management bias is inherent in subjective decisions, 
in making such judgments there may be no intention by management to mislead the users of 
financial statements. However, where the intent to mislead is present, management bias can 
be considered fraudulent in nature.
Evidence obtained from audit procedures performed for other purposes also may provide 
evidence relevant to the measurement and disclosure of fair values. For example, inspection 
procedures to verify existence of an asset measured at fair value also may provide relevant 
evidence about its valuation, such as the physical condition of the asset.
Evaluating the Reasonableness of the Fair Value Measurements
After obtaining sufficient appropriate evidence through substantive tests, the auditor then eval­
uates whether management’s measurements and disclosures are in accordance with GAAP.
As capital markets continue to increase the complexity of financial instruments, it will be 
increasingly important for auditors to be proficient in understanding how fair value estimates 
are created and the impact they have on the overall audit plan.
Practice 
INSIGHT
During the recent PCAOB inspections of two of the Big 4 firms, the PCAOB inspection team identified 
deficiencies having to do with auditing fair value estimates. For example, one auditor failed to evalu­
ate the reasonableness of some of the assumptions used to support the estimated fair values of cer­
tain illiquid securities. Another auditor failed to obtain an understanding of the methodologies used 
to develop the fair value measurement for securities that were not actively traded (www.pcaob.org).
KEY TERMS
Analytical procedures. Evaluations of financial information made through analysis of plau­
sible relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data.
Assertions. Expressed or implied representations by management regarding the recognition,

16-24	 Cassandra Corporation, a manufacturing company, periodically invests large sums 
in investment (debt and equity) securities. The investment policy is established by 
the investment committee of the board of directors, and the treasurer is responsible 
for carrying out the investment committee’s directives. All securities are stored in a 
bank safe-deposit vault.
	
	
	 	
The independent auditor’s internal control questionnaire with respect to Cassan­
dra’s investments in debt and equity securities contains the following three questions:
	
	
	 ∙	 Is investment policy established by the investment committee of the board of 
directors?
	
	
	 ∙	 Is the treasurer solely responsible for carrying out the investment committee’s 
directives?
	
	
	 ∙	 Are all securities stored in a bank safe-deposit vault?

nce the financial statement accounts and related controls in each of 
the various business processes have been audited, the auditor sum­
marizes and evaluates the evidence. Before determining the appropri­
ate audit report, the auditor evaluates the results of audit tests and considers 
a number of possible additional issues that could impact the entity’s internal 
control over financial reporting and its financial statements. This chapter dis­
cusses the following areas in which the auditor has responsibilities in complet­
ing the audit:
•  Review for contingent liabilities
•  Review for commitments
•  Review for subsequent events

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
A contingent liability is an existing condition or set of circumstances involving uncertainty 
about a possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when some future event occurs or fails 
to occur. For example, if an oil refining company experiences an explosion and some of its 
workers are hurt or killed, lawsuits will likely result. Until the lawsuits are settled or resolved 
in court, there is uncertainty about the amount of the loss the company will face. When the 
uncertainty about the loss exists as of the balance sheet date, the company must decide how 
to account for the contingent liability in its financial statements. FASB ASC Topic 450, 
“Contingencies,” states that when a contingent liability exists, the likelihood that the future 
event will result in a loss is to be assessed using three categories:
	
1.	 Probable: The future event is likely to occur.
	
2.	 Reasonably possible: The chance of the future event occurring is more than remote 
but less than likely.
	
3.	 Remote: The chance of the future event occurring is slight.
As you have learned in your financial accounting courses, if the event is probable and 
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the loss associated with the contingency 
is accrued by a charge to income. When the outcome of the event is judged to be reason­
ably possible or the amount cannot be estimated, a disclosure of the contingency is made 
in the footnotes to the financial statements. Exhibit 17–1 presents an example of such dis­
closure taken from a recent annual report. In general, loss contingencies that are judged to 
be remote are neither accrued in the financial statements nor disclosed in the footnotes. In 
reading Exhibit 17–1, consider the judgment involved on the part of management and the 
auditor in making and assessing the reasonableness of this type of disclosure. This is just 
one example of how both accounting and auditing involve a great deal of subjectivity and 
require the application of sound professional judgment.
Examples of contingent liabilities include the following:
	
∙	 pending or threatened litigation.
	
∙	 actual or possible claims and assessments.
	
∙	 income tax disputes.
	
∙	 product warranties or defects.
	
∙	 guarantees of obligations to others.
	
∙	 agreements to repurchase receivables that have been sold.
LO 17-1
Example of Footnote Disclosure for a Contingency
On October 31, 2014, a class action complaint was filed by a stockholder against the company and cer­
tain of its officers and directors in the United States District Court (“the court”). Shortly thereafter, other 
stockholders filed similar class action complaints. On February 1, 2015, a consolidated amended class 
action complaint against the company and certain of its officers and directors was filed in the court. In 
their consolidated complaint, the plaintiffs seek to represent a class consisting generally of persons who 
purchased or otherwise acquired the company’s common stock in the period from March 5, 2014, through 
August 14, 2014. These actions claim damages related to alleged material misstatements and omissions of 
fact and manipulative and deceptive acts in violation of federal securities laws and common-law fraud. In 
December 2015, a motion filed by the plaintiffs to certify a class of purchasers of the company’s common 
stock was approved with limited exceptions, and a class period for certain claims was established from 
March 5, 2014, to August 14, 2014. Also in December 2015, in response to a motion by the company and 
individual defendants, claims of common-law fraud, deceit, negligence, misrepresentation, and certain of 
the violations of the federal securities laws against certain of the individual defendants were dismissed. At 
this time, it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending lawsuit or the potential financial impact 
on the company of an adverse decision.

Review for Contingent Liabilities

	
Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
565
Audit Procedures for Identifying Contingent Liabilities
Examples of procedures that can help the auditor identify contingent liabilities include
	
1.	 Reading the minutes of meetings of the board of directors, committees of the board, 
and stockholders.
	
2.	 Reviewing contracts, loan agreements, leases, and correspondence from government 
agencies.
	
3.	 Reviewing tax returns, IRS reports, and schedules supporting the entity’s income 
tax liability.
	
4.	 Confirming or otherwise documenting guarantees and letters of credit obtained from 
financial institutions or other lending agencies.
	
5.	 Inspecting other documents for possible guarantees or other similar arrangements.
For example, the auditor usually reads the minutes of the board of directors’ meetings for 
identification of major events and approval of significant transactions. Normally, the board 
of directors would discuss any material uncertainty that might exist for the entity, and such 
discussions should be noted in the minutes. Similarly, the auditor examines the entity’s cal­
culations for its income tax expense and accrued tax liability. The audit procedures for these 
accounts include determining if the IRS has audited the entity’s prior year’s tax returns. If so, 
the auditor should examine the IRS agents’ report for any additional taxes assessed and deter­
mine whether the entity will contest the additional assessment.
In addition, near the completion of the engagement the auditor takes specific additional 
steps to identify contingent liabilities. Such procedures include
	
1.	 Inquiry of and discussion with management regarding the entity’s policies and 
procedures for identifying, evaluating, and accounting for contingent liabilities. 
Management has the responsibility for establishing policies and procedures to 
identify, evaluate, and account for contingencies. Large entities may implement such 
policies and procedures as part of their risk assessment process. Smaller private 
entities, however, sometimes rely on legal counsel or other parties to help them 
identify and account for contingencies.
	
2.	 Examining documents in the entity’s records such as correspondence and invoices 
from attorneys for pending or threatened lawsuits. Even though the amount of 
the legal expense account may be immaterial, the auditor normally examines the 
transactions in the account (see Chapter 15). One purpose of this examination is to 
identify actual or potential litigation against the entity. The account analysis can also 
be used to develop a list of attorneys who have been consulted by the entity.
	
3.	 Obtaining a legal letter that describes and evaluates any litigation, claims, or 
assessments. Legal letters are discussed in the next section.
	
4.	 Obtaining a written representation from management that all litigation, asserted 
and unasserted claims, and assessments have been disclosed in accordance with 
FASB ASC Topic 450. This information is obtained in a representation letter 
furnished by the entity. Management representation letters are discussed later in 
this chapter.
Legal Letters
A letter of audit inquiry (often referred to as a legal letter) sent to the entity’s attorneys is the 
primary means of corroborating information provided by management to the auditor about 
litigation, claims, and assessments. Auditors typically analyze legal expense for the entire 
period and then ask management to send a letter to in-house attorneys (often referred to as 
general counsel) and to external attorneys who have been consulted by management. Audi­
tors should be particularly vigilant with responses from the entity’s general counsel and from 
attorneys specializing in patent law or securities laws. General counsel will likely be aware 
LO 17-2
LO 17-3

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
of any major litigation involving the entity, and patent infringement and securities laws are 
major sources of litigation. Table 17–1 provides examples of types of litigation that the audi-
tor may encounter. Chapter 20 covers issues relating to auditor liability and litigation in detail. 
Management should request that the attorneys provide information about a number of items, 
including the following:
	
∙	 A list of any pending or threatened litigation or any probable but as yet unasserted 
claims to which the attorney has devoted substantial attention or for which an

∙	 A request that the attorney describe and evaluate each pending or threatened litigation; 
this should include the progress of the case, the action the entity plans to take, the 
likelihood of an unfavorable outcome, and the amount or range of the potential loss
	
∙	 A request that the attorney identify any pending or threatened litigation or claims not 
included in management’s list or a statement that the list is complete
	
∙	 A request that the attorney comment on unasserted claims where his or her views 
differ from management’s evaluation
	
∙	 A request that the attorney indicate if his or her response is limited in any way and the 
reasons for such limitations
Exhibit 17–2 presents an example of a legal letter relating to EarthWear. Attorneys are gener-
ally willing to provide evidence on actual or pending litigation. However, they are often reluc-
tant to provide information on situations in which the injured party or potential claimant has 
not yet notified the entity of a claim. For example, suppose there is a cave-in at one of a coal 
mining entity’s mines and a number of miners are killed. Suppose further that a subsequent 
investigation shows that the entity had failed to install proper safety equipment. Although the 
families of the employees may not yet have initiated or threatened litigation at the end of the 
entity’s fiscal period, an unasserted claim likely exists at the financial statement date. In this 
case, the entity’s attorneys may be reluctant to provide the auditor with information about 
the unasserted claims because the attorneys may be concerned that disclosing the unasserted 
claim in the financial statements may actually encourage a lawsuit or make it more difficult 
for the entity to defend itself. This type of situation is generally resolved by having the attor-
neys corroborate management’s understanding of their professional responsibility involving 
unasserted claims and assessments. Refer to the third paragraph in the legal letter shown in 
Exhibit 17–2 for the manner in which the entity requests the attorneys to communicate to the 
auditor. In general, disclosing an unasserted claim is not required unless it is probable that 
the claim will be asserted and there is a reasonable possibility that the outcome will prove to 
be unfavorable.
Attorneys may be unable to respond to the outcome of a matter because the factors in the 
case do not allow them to reasonably estimate the likelihood of the outcome or to estimate 
the possible loss. However, refusal by an entity’s attorney to furnish information in a legal 
letter is a limitation on the scope of the audit that is potentially sufficient to preclude an 
unqualified opinion.

Companies often enter long-term commitments to purchase raw materials or to sell products 
at a fixed price. For example, an airline might commit to purchasing its jet fuel from a sup­
plier at a predetermined price over a given future time period. The main purpose of entering 
into such a purchase or sales contract is to obtain a favorable or predictable pricing arrange­
ment or to secure the availability of raw materials.
Stop and Think: Why might an auditor be concerned with commitments made by 
an entity?
Accounting standards on derivatives and hedging require such commitments to be dis­
closed in a footnote to the financial statements with an adjustment to Other Comprehensive

Dear Legal Counsel:
In connection with an audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, please fur­
nish our auditors, Willis & Adams, P.O. Box 4080, Boise, Idaho 79443-4080, with the information requested 
below concerning contingencies involving matters with respect to which you have devoted substantial 
attention on behalf of the company in the form of legal consultation or representation. For the purposes of 
your response to this letter, we believe that as to each contingency an amount in excess of $25,000 would 
be material, and in the aggregate, $150,000. However, determination of materiality with respect to the 
overall financial statements cannot be made until our auditors complete their examination. Your response 
should include matters that existed at December 31, 2015, and during the period from that date to the date 
of completion of their examination, which is anticipated to be on or about February 15, 2016.
Regarding pending or threatened litigations, claims, and assessments, please include in your response 
(1) the nature of each matter; (2) the progress of each matter to date; (3) how the company is responding 
or intends to respond (for example, to contest the case vigorously or seek an out-of-court settlement); 
(4) an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome; and (5) an estimate, if one can be made, 
of the amount or range of potential loss. Please furnish to our auditors such explanation, if any, that you 
consider necessary to supplement the foregoing information, including an explanation of the matters as to 
which your views may differ from those we have stated.
We understand that in the course of performing legal services for us with respect to a matter rec­
ognized to involve an unasserted possible claim or assessment that may call for financial statement 
disclosure, if you have formed a professional conclusion that we should disclose or consider disclosure 
concerning such possible claim or assessment, as a matter of professional responsibility to us, you will so 
advise us and will consult with us concerning the question of such disclosure and the applicable require­
ments of FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450, “Contingencies.” Please specifically confirm 
to our auditors that our understanding is correct.
Please specifically identify the nature of and reasons for any limitation in your response.

Income (OCI) for any gains or losses. For example, suppose a client produces woolen cloth 
for use in women’s suits and that the company has a December 31 year-end. Suppose fur­
ther that the client enters a noncancelable contract on September 30, 2015, to purchase 
1 million pounds of wool at $1.00 per pound with delivery on March 31, 2016. At year-end 
(December 31, 2015), the auditor compares the current market price of wool with the contract 
price. If the current price of wool is $1.00, only a footnote disclosure is required. However, 
if the price of wool is less than $1.00, a decrease would also be recognized at December 31, 
2015. For example, if the current market price of wool is $.75 per pound, the client would 
recognize a $250,000 decrease in OCI (1,000,000 pounds × $.25 per pound) at year-end. 
Likewise, if the price was $1.15 per pound, the client would again disclose the agreement and 
recognize an increase of $150,000 in OCI (1,000,000 pounds × .15).
Long-term commitments are usually identified through inquiry of entity personnel dur­
ing the audit of the revenue and purchasing processes and through review of the minutes of 
board meetings. In fact, the audit procedures relating to commitments are often very similar to 
those we discussed above for contingent liabilities. The auditor should ensure that appropriate 
disclosures and accruals are made in the financial statements.
Sometimes events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before the issu­
ance of the financial statements materially affect the financial statements. These events or 
transactions are referred to as subsequent events and require recognition or disclosure in the 
financial statements. Management is required to disclose the date through which the entity 
has considered subsequent events (ASC 855). Auditors are responsible for evaluating the enti­
ty’s handling of subsequent events in the financial statements.
Two types of subsequent events require consideration by management and evaluation by 
the auditor:
	
1.	 Type I (Recognized Events): Events that provide additional evidence about 
conditions that existed at the date of the balance sheet and that affect the amounts 
or estimates involved in the financial statement preparation process. Type I events 
require adjustment of the numbers in the financial statements.
	
2.	 Type II (Unrecognized Events): Events that provide evidence about conditions that 
did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but that arose subsequent to that date. 
Type II events usually require disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. In 
some instances where the effect of the Type II event or transaction is very significant, 
pro forma financial statements may be required in order to prevent the financial 
statements from being misleading.
The following are examples of Type I events or conditions:
	
∙	 An uncollectible account receivable resulting from deterioration in a customer’s 
financial condition prior to year end, about which the holder of the receivable is 
unaware. The customer declares bankruptcy after the balance sheet date but prior to 
the issuance of the financial statements.
	
∙	 The settlement of a lawsuit after the balance sheet date but prior to issuance of the 
financial statements for an amount different from the amount recorded in the year-end 
financial statements as a contingent liability.
Note that in both of these examples, additional evidence that shed light on estimates pre­
viously made in the financial statements became available after the balance sheet date but 
before the financial statements were issued. In other words, the “events” that occurred in both 
examples shed additional light on conditions that already existed as of the balance sheet date.

Review of Subsequent Events for Audit 
of Financial Statements

	
Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
569
Subsequent events such as these that affect the realization of assets or the settlement of esti­
mated liabilities normally require adjustment of the financial statements.
Examples of Type II events that result in disclosure include the following:
	
∙	 Loss of the entity’s manufacturing facility or assets resulting from a casualty such as 
a fire or flood that occurred after the balance sheet date but prior to issuance of the 
financial statements
	
∙	 Purchase or disposal of a business by the entity after the balance sheet date but prior 
to issuance of the financial statements
	
∙	 A capital stock or bond issuance by the entity after the balance sheet date but prior to 
issuance of the financial statements
	
∙	 Losses on receivables caused by conditions such as a business failure arising 
subsequent to the balance sheet date
Stop and Think: You’ll recall that EarthWear has a December 31 year-end. Suppose 
the IRS notified EarthWear on January 5, 2016, that the company had made an error in 
its 2014 tax return, submitted on April 15, 2015, and as a result had underpaid its 2014 
income taxes. If EarthWear settles the claim on February 27, 2016 (before issuing its 
2015 financial statements), should the payment be classified as a Type I (Recognized) 
or Type II (Unrecognized) event? Now suppose that on February 20, 2016, EarthWear 
learned that a large wholesale customer, from whom EarthWear had a material receiv­
able, had filed for bankruptcy. The customer’s business had been destroyed by an earth­
quake on January 5, 2016, and was uninsured. Would the bankruptcy constitute a Type I 
or Type II event? Once you’ve articulated your answers, read on.
The IRS payment would be classified as a Type I event because it provides evidence 
about the underpayment of prior-year taxes, a condition that clearly existed prior to the bal­
ance sheet date. This subsequent event would lead to an adjustment of the numbers in the 
financial statements. On the other hand, the bankruptcy would be a considered a Type II event 
because it resulted from the earthquake, which occurred on January 6, and thus was not a con­
dition that existed as of the balance sheet date. The loss of the receivable would be disclosed 
in the notes but would not require an adjustment to the 2015 financial statements.
Figure 17–1 presents a diagram of the subsequent-events period for EarthWear. The 
period from the date of the financial statements (December 31, 2015) to the date of the audi­
tor’s report (February 15, 2016) is sometimes referred to as the formal subsequent-events 
period. During this time frame, the auditor actively conducts audit procedures related to the

current-year audit. The period from the date of the auditor’s report to the issuance of the 
financial statements (March 5, 2016) is also part of the subsequent-events period, but the 
auditor is not responsible for making any inquiries or conducting any audit procedures after 
the date of the audit report. However, subsequent events may come to the auditor’s atten­
tion during this period. If the subsequent event is Type I, the financial statements should be 
adjusted. Depending on the event and its circumstances, additional disclosure may need to be 
made in the footnotes. When the subsequent event is Type II, a footnote describing the event 
should be included with the financial statements.
Figure 17–1 also refers to the possibility that the auditor will discover additional facts 
after the issuance of the financial statements to the public (i.e., after March 5, 2016). We dis­
cuss this postissuance time period later in the chapter after covering the other steps the audi­
tor takes to complete the audit. First, however, we need to address the typically brief time 
period between the date of the auditor’s report and the issuance of the financial statements 
(between February 15, 2016, and March 5, 2016, in this example), because this time period 
gives rise to a potential “dual dating” of the auditor’s report.
Dual Dating
The date of the auditor’s report is significant because it relates to certain auditor responsibili­
ties. Auditing standards indicate that the auditor’s report should be dated no earlier than the 
date on which the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence on which to base 
an opinion on the financial statements. To meet this criterion, by the date of the audit report 
all significant audit documentation must have been reviewed and approved, all of the financial 
statements, including related notes, must have been prepared; and management must have 
explicitly taken responsibility for the financial statements.
When a subsequent event is recorded or disclosed in the financial statements after the 
date on which the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence but before the 
issuance of the financial statements, the auditor must consider what date to put on the audi­
tor’s report. For example, suppose that prior to issuance of the financial statements EarthWear 
notifies Willis & Adams that on March 1, 2016, the company had entered an agreement to 
purchase another catalog retailer. Such an event is not indicative of conditions that existed 
at the balance sheet date and therefore would require only disclosure in the footnotes to the 
December 31, 2015, financial statements, but the question arises as to what date the auditor 
should put on the audit report. Two methods are available for dating the audit report in such 
a situation: Willis & Adams may (1) “dual date” the report, using wording such as “February 
15, 2016, except for Note 10, which is as of March 1, 2016” or (2) use the date of the sub­
sequent event (March 1). Dual dating limits the auditor’s responsibility for events occurring 
subsequent to the date on which the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence 
to only the specific subsequent event referred to in the footnote. If the audit report uses the 
March 1, 2016. subsequent event date rather than dual dating the report, the auditor’s respon­
sibility for identifying any material subsequent events extends to that later date. 
Stop and Think: For this example, how do you think most auditors would choose to 
date the audit report and why?
In this instance, due to the desire to not extend their responsibility for other events that 
might have occurred between February 15 and March 1 besides the one noted, Willis & 
Adams would most likely dual date the report.1
LO 17-6
1Until 2009, the date on which the auditors completed fieldwork usually coincided with the auditor’s report date. 
However, this reporting convention has changed in practice in response to Statement of Financial Accounting Stan­
dards (SFAS) No. 165 (issued in 2009 and now codified as ASC Topic 855). SFAS No. 165 requires companies to 
perform their own evaluation of subsequent events through the date on which the financial statements are filed with 
the SEC. In response to this change in GAAP, auditors now usually delay the dating of the auditor’s report to coincide 
with the filing of the financial statements with the SEC. Thus, dual-dating has become quite rare in practice.

Audit Procedures for Subsequent Events
As you learned in previous chapters, some audit procedures are conducted before year-end 
(these are called “interim procedures”), while others are conducted after the balance sheet 
date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Some of these latter audit pro­
cedures, such as testing proper sales and purchases cutoff, are applied to transactions that 
occurred after the balance sheet date. Such audit procedures may detect subsequent events. In 
addition, the auditor conducts audit procedures specifically to detect any subsequent events 
that might have occurred during the period between the balance sheet date and the date of the 
audit report. Examples of these audit procedures include the following:
	
∙	 Asking management about the following matters: (a) whether there were or are any 
substantial contingent liabilities or commitments existing at the balance sheet date or 
at the date of inquiry; (b) whether there have been any significant changes in capital 
stock, long-term debt, or working capital; (c) the current status of any items in the 
financial statements that were accounted for based on preliminary or inconclusive 
data; and (d) whether any unusual adjustments have been made during the subsequent-
events period
	
∙	 Reading any interim financial statements that are available for the period after year-
end (e.g., monthly financial statements for January 2016) and comparing them to the 
prior-period statements; any unusual fluctuations are investigated
	
∙	 Examining the books of original entry (such as sales journal, purchases journal, cash 
receipts and cash disbursements journals, and general ledger) for the subsequent-
events period and investigating any unusual transactions or information that shed 
additional light on conditions existing at the balance sheet date or that give rise to 
conditions subsequent to the balance sheet date
	
∙	 Reading the available minutes of meetings of stockholders, directors, or other 
committees for the subsequent-events period
	
∙	 Asking legal counsel about any developments relating to litigation, claims, or 
assessments against the company
LO 17-7
Review of Subsequent Events for the Audit of Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting
In addition to reporting subsequent events that have implications for the financial statement 
account balances, auditors of public companies are responsible for reporting any changes in inter­
nal control that might adversely affect financial reporting between the end of the reporting period 
and the date of the auditor’s report (AS5). The auditor’s treatment of subsequent events relating 
to internal control is similar to the Type I and Type II treatments discussed above. In other words, 
the treatment depends on whether the change in control reveals information about a material 
weakness that existed as of the end of the reporting period or whether the event creates or reveals 
information about a new condition that did not exist as of the end of the reporting period.
If the event reveals information about a material weakness that existed as of the end 
of the reporting period, the auditor should issue an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of 
internal control over financial reporting (see Chapter 7). If the auditor is unable to determine 
the effect of the subsequent event on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control, the 
auditor should disclaim any opinion with respect to the entity’s ICFR. If the event creates or 
reveals adverse information about an internal control condition that did not exist as of the 
end of the reporting period and the information has a material effect, the auditor includes an 
explanatory paragraph that describes the event and its effects.
Auditors of public companies are required to inquire of management whether there were 
any changes in internal control between the end of the reporting period and the date of the 
auditor’s report that might adversely affect financial reporting, and should obtain written rep­
resentations regarding any such changes. The public company auditor should also inquire 
about and examine, for this subsequent period, the following (AS5):

∙	 Relevant internal audit reports (or similar functions, such as loan review in a financial 
institution) issued during the subsequent period
	
∙	 Independent auditor reports (if other than the primary auditor’s) of significant 
deficiencies or material weaknesses
	
∙	 Regulatory agency reports on the company’s internal control over financial reporting, 
if any
	
∙	 Information about the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial 
reporting obtained through other engagements
Practice 
INSIGHT
Each year the PCAOB reviews the documentation for several audit engagements conducted during 
the prior year. The Board recently concluded that in several engagements it has reviewed, auditors 
appeared to take an unjustifiably uniform approach to their testing across processes, accounts, and 
assertions. Such an approach can result in auditors expending more effort than necessary in lower-
risk areas and not enough effort in higher-risk areas.
Final Steps and Evidence Evaluation
In addition to the search for unrecorded contingent liabilities and the review for subsequent 
events, the auditor conducts a number of audit steps before deciding on the appropriate audit 
report for the entity. These include the following:
	
∙	 Performance of final analytical procedures
	
∙	 Obtaining a management representation letter
	
∙	 Review of working papers
	
∙	 Final evaluation of audit results
	
∙	 Evaluation of financial statement presentation and disclosure
	
∙	 Obtaining an independent review of the engagement
	
∙	 Evaluation of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern
Final Analytical Procedures
Auditing standards require that the auditor perform analytical procedures both in planning 
and at the final review stage of the audit. The objective of conducting analytical procedures 
near the end of the engagement is to help the auditor assess the conclusions reached on the 
financial statement components and evaluate the overall financial statement presentation. 
These final analytical procedures may include recalculating some of the ratios discussed in 
an Advanced Module in Chapter 5 that were used in planning the audit to evaluate how these 
ratios may have been affected by audit adjustments. They may also involve the use of addi­
tional ratios or trends that help the auditor evaluate the adequacy of the evidence gathered in 
response to unexpected fluctuations in the account balances identified during the planning 
of the audit. These final analytical procedures may indicate that more evidence is needed for 
certain account balances.
The auditor performs final analytical procedures to consider the overall reasonableness 
of the financial statement amounts. In other words, final analytical procedures provide a sort 
of final, overall “smell test” by the auditor. In doing this analysis, the auditor reexamines the 
entity’s business risks (refer to Chapter 4). For example, the auditor considers the critical 
issues and significant industry business risks and whether such risks might impact the finan­
cial statements. The auditor also assesses the structure and profitability of the industry and 
how the entity fits within the industry in terms of its profitability and solvency. In other words, 
the auditor considers whether the financial statement amounts make sense given the auditor’s 
knowledge of the entity’s business risks. Much of this same kind of analysis is completed dur­
ing the planning phase, but final analytical procedures allow the auditor to reevaluate these big 
picture issues after auditor-proposed adjustments to the financial statements have been made.

Representation Letter
During the course of a financial statement audit or an integrated audit, management makes a 
number of representations in response to auditor inquiries. Auditing standards require that the 
auditor obtain a representation letter from management. The purpose of this letter is to docu­
ment, in writing, significant oral representations made to the auditor by management. The 
representation letter also reduces the possibility of misunderstanding between management 
and the auditor.
For example, during the audit, the auditor may inquire about related parties and conduct 
specific audit procedures to identify related-party transactions. Even if the results of these 
audit procedures indicate that such transactions have been properly disclosed, the auditor 
obtains written representations indicating that management is not aware of any undisclosed 
related-party transactions. In other instances, evidence simply may not be available to corrob­
orate management’s representations. For example, suppose management indicates an intent to 
refinance a short-term obligation in the next period and reclassifies it as a long-term liabil­
ity in the current financial statements. The auditor would obtain written representation from 
management to confirm that the obligations will be refinanced in the next period. The auditor 
may also seek written confirmation of such financing arrangements from the entity’s lender.
Exhibit 17–3 presents an example of a representation letter. Note the types of important 
information management is asked to represent to the auditor. Note also that the representation 
letter is addressed to the auditor and is typically signed by the chief executive officer (CEO) 
and the chief financial officer (CFO). It generally bears the same date as the auditor’s report. 
Management’s refusal to provide a representation letter would result in a scope limitation that 
is sufficient to preclude an unqualified opinion and, in fact, is ordinarily sufficient to cause an 
auditor to disclaim an opinion or withdraw from the engagement. For public companies, some 
of these management representations are required to be made public. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
of 2002, Section 302, “Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports,” requires the CEO and 
CFO of publicly traded companies to certify the appropriateness of their financial statements 
and related disclosures and to certify that they fairly present, in all material respects, the oper­
ations and financial condition of the company. These certifications required under Section 
302 are included with each quarterly and annual filing of financial statements with the SEC.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The management representation letter, although it is written as a letter addressed to the auditor and 
signed by management, is typically drafted by the auditor and is then presented to management for 
appropriate signatures. Auditors often refer to a letter of representations as a “rep letter.”
Practice 
INSIGHT
Auditors must be careful not to leave “loose ends” in the working papers. Consider the third general 
auditing standard, relating to due professional care: will a regulator or a jury believe that the auditor 
exercised due care if a question is left unanswered or an audit step undocumented? There’s a com­
mon saying in audit practice: “If you didn’t document it, you didn’t do it.”
Working Paper Review
All audit work should be reviewed by an audit team member who is senior to the person 
preparing the working papers. Thus, the senior-in-charge should conduct a detailed review 
of the working papers prepared by staff auditors and follow up on any unresolved problems 
or issues. In turn, the manager should review all working papers. The engagement partner 
normally reviews working papers related to critical audit areas as well as working papers 
prepared by the manager. In reviewing the working papers, the reviewers evaluate whether 
the work was performed and documented, the objectives of the procedures were achieved, and 
the results of the work support the conclusions reached. Ultimately, the engagement partner 
is responsible to ensure that the body of evidence gathered fully justifies and supports the 
auditor’s opinion.

Willis & Adams
P.O. Box 4080
Boise, Idaho 79443-4080
Dear Willis & Adams, CPAs:
We are providing this letter in connection with your audits of our assertion about the effectiveness of internal control over financial 
reporting at December 31, 2015, and of the consolidated financial statements of EarthWear Clothiers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, 
for the years then ended. These audits were conducted for the purpose of expressing opinions on the effectiveness of EarthWear Cloth­
iers’ internal control over financial reporting, and whether our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of EarthWear Clothiers in conformity with accounting principles accepted in 
the United States of America. We confirm that we are responsible for the fair presentation in the consolidated financial statements of 
financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, for establishing and 
maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for performing an assessment of the effectiveness of internal control 
over financial reporting.
Certain representations in this letter are described as being limited to matters that are material. Items are considered material, regard-
less of size, if they involve an omission or misstatement of accounting information that, in the light of surrounding circumstances, makes 
it probable that the judgment of a reasonable person relying on the information would have been changed or influenced by the omission 
or misstatement.
We confirm, to the best of our knowledge and belief, as of February 15, 2016, the following representations made to you during 
your audits:
	
1.	 The consolidated financial statements referred to above are fairly presented in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America, and include all disclosures necessary for such fair presentation and disclosures other­
wise required to be included therein by laws and regulations to which the Company is subject.
	
2.	 We have made available to you all
	a.	Financial records and related data.
	b.	Minutes of the meetings of stockholders, directors, and committees of directors, or summaries of actions of recent meetings for 
which minutes have not yet been prepared.
	
3.	 There have been no communications from regulatory agencies concerning noncompliance with or deficiencies in financial report­
ing practices.
	
4.	 There are no material transactions, agreements, or accounts that have not been properly recorded in the accounting records 
underlying the financial statements.
	
5.	 The effects of the uncorrected financial statements misstatements summarized in the accompanying schedule are immaterial, both 
individually and in the aggregate, to the financial statements taken as a whole.
	
6.	 Receivables recorded in the financial statements represent valid claims against debtors for sales or other charges arising on or 
before the balance sheet date and have been appropriately reduced to their estimated net realizable value. Receivables classified 
as current do not include any material amounts which are collectible after one year.
	
7.	 Inventories recorded in the consolidated financial statements are stated at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on 
the basis of LIFO, and due provision was made to reduce all slow-moving, obsolete, or unusable inventories to their estimated use­
ful values. Inventory quantities at the balance sheet dates were determined from physical counts taken by competent employees 
at various times during the year. Liabilities for amounts unpaid are recorded for all items included in inventories at balance sheet 
dates and all quantities billed to customers at those dates are excluded from the inventory balances.
	
8.	 All liabilities of the Company of which we are aware are included in the financial statements at the balance sheet date. There are 
no other liabilities or gain or loss contingencies that are required to be accrued or disclosed by FASB ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, 
and no unasserted claims or assessments of which our legal counsel has advised us are probable of assertion and required to be 
disclosed in accordance with that Statement.

11.	 We assessed the Company’s internal control over financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with accounting prin­
ciples generally accepted in the United States of America. This assessment was based on criteria for effective internal control over 
financial reporting established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of 
the Treadway Commission (the COSO Report). Based on this assessment, we believe that the Company maintained effective inter­
nal control over financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America as of December 31, 2015.
	 12.	 There are no significant deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the design or operation of internal controls that could 
adversely affect the Company’s ability to record, process, summarize, and report financial data.
	 13.	 We acknowledge our responsibility for the design and implementation of programs and controls to prevent and detect fraud.
	 14.	 We have no knowledge of any fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity involving
	a.	Management.
	b.	Employees who have significant roles in internal control.
	c.	 Others that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
	 15.	 We have no knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting the entity received in communications from 
employees, former employees, analysts, regulators, short sellers, or others.
	 16.	 There have been no violations or possible violations of laws or regulations whose effects should be considered for disclosure in the 
consolidated financial statements or as a basis for recording a loss contingency.
	 17.	 The Company has no plans or intentions that may materially affect the carrying value or classification of assets and liabilities.
	 18.	 There have not been any changes, subsequent to the date being reported on, in internal control over financial reporting or other 
factors that might significantly affect internal control over financial reporting, including corrective actions with regard to significant 
deficiencies and material weaknesses.
	 19.	 All control deficiencies communicated to the audit committee during previous engagements have been resolved.
	 20.	 The following, if material, have been properly recorded or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements:
	a.	Related-party transactions, including sales, purchases, loans, transfers, leasing arrangements, and guarantees, and amounts 
receivable from or payable to related parties.
	b.	Guarantees, whether written or oral, under which the company is contingently liable.
	c.	 Significant estimates and material concentrations known to management that are required to be disclosed in accordance with 
the FASB ASC Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties. (Significant estimates are estimates at the balance sheet date that could 
change materially within the next year. Concentrations refer to volumes of business, revenues, available sources of supply, or 
markets or geographic areas for which events could occur that would significantly disrupt normal finances within the next year.)
	 21.	 The Company has satisfactory title to all owned assets, and there are no liens or encumbrances on such assets, nor has any asset 
been pledged as collateral, except as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
	 22.	 The Company has complied with all aspects of contractual agreements that would have a material effect on the financial state­
ments in the event of noncompliance.
	 23.	 The unaudited interim financial information has been prepared and presented in conformity with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America applicable to interim financial information and with Item 302(a) of Regulation S-K. The unau­
dited quarterly financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015, also has been prepared on a basis consistent with the 
corresponding interim periods in the year ended December 31, 2014, and, to the degree appropriate, with the consolidated financial 
statements for the years ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014. The unaudited interim financial information for the three 
months ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, does not include any material amount of year-end adjustments that have 
not been disclosed or any material amounts that should have been included in earlier interim periods of the respective fiscal years.
	 24.	 Arrangements with financial institutions involving compensating balances or other arrangements involving restrictions on cash bal­
ances, line of credit, or similar arrangements have been properly disclosed.
	 25.	 We have fully disclosed to you all sales terms, including all rights of return of price adjustments and all warranty provisions.
	 26.	 The company has appropriately reconciled its books and records underlying the consolidated financial statements to their related 
supporting information. All related reconciling items considered to be material were identified and included on the reconciliations 
and were appropriately adjusted in the consolidated financial statements. There were no material unreconciled differences or 
material general ledger suspense account items. All intracompany and intercompany accounts have been eliminated or appropri­
ately measured and considered for disclosure in the consolidated financial statements.
To the best of our knowledge and belief, no events have occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and through the date of this letter 
that would require adjustment to or disclosure in the aforementioned financial statements or that would significantly alter the fairness of 
the representations we have made herein.

Final Evaluation of Audit Results
In conjunction with the review of the working papers, the auditor must evaluate the results 
of the audit tests. In Chapter 7 we discussed evaluating the results of the audit of internal 
control over financial reporting, including taking into account whether misstatements identi­
fied in the financial statement audit might affect the auditor’s conclusions about the entity’s 
internal control. 
The final evaluation of evidence from the financial statement audit is concerned primar­
ily with two issues: (1) the sufficiency of the audit evidence and (2) the effects of detected 
misstatements in the financial statements. 
In terms of the first issue, evaluating the audit evidence, the auditor determines whether 
there is sufficient evidence to support each relevant assertion. This evaluation considers 
evidence obtained to support the assessment of the risk of material misstatement, as well 
as the evidence gathered to reach the planned level of detection risk (i.e., the auditor’s sub­
stantive procedures). If this evaluation indicates that the evidence, taken as a whole, is not 
sufficient to meet the planned level of audit risk, the auditor may need to gather additional 
evidence. For example, if the final analytical procedures indicate that inventory may still 
contain material misstatements, the auditor should gather additional audit evidence on the 
inventory account balance.
In terms of the second issue, any misstatements detected during the audit process must 
be considered in terms of the materiality of their effects on the financial statements. This 
involves performing the third step in applying materiality (refer to Chapter 3). In particular, 
the auditor must estimate the total likely misstatements in each financial statement component 
and compare the amount arrived at to the amount of materiality allocated to that component. 
The auditor should also consider sampling risk, the possibility of undetected misstatements, 
and the effects of unadjusted misstatements on aggregated components of the financial state­
ments such as assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, and expenses.
In evaluating whether a misstatement is material, the auditor should also consider both 
quantitative and qualitative aspects of the account and transactions involved. Although mate­
riality may be planned and implemented using a quantitative approach, qualitative aspects of 
small misstatements may also materially affect the users of financial statements.
Stop and Think: Consider for a moment the impact of a very small misstatement on 
earnings per share, let’s say two cents per share. In what situations might this two cent 
misstatement be material?
A two-cent misstatement in earnings per share might be material under a variety of cir­
cumstances. For example, it might be material if those two cents meant the company was 
able to just meet analysts’ earnings expectations, or if they made it so that the company could 
report a one cent per share profit instead of a one cent per share loss. A very small misstate­
ment might also be considered material if it resulted from management fraud or if it allowed 
management to claim a larger bonus, among other factors. Table 17–2 presents some of the 
factors that auditors should consider in determining whether a misstatement that is quantita­
tively immaterial might be considered material from a qualitative perspective.
Exhibit 17–4 shows a working paper that was first introduced in Chapter 3. As indicated 
there, none of the errors detected is material in terms of tolerable misstatement ($900,000). 
Additionally, the overall effect of the misstatements is not material in terms of aggregated 
components of the financial statements. Even though the misstatements shown in Exhibit 17–4 
are not material either quantitatively or qualitatively, it is common practice for the auditor to 
communicate any such adjustments to the entity to correct the books. It is normally expected 
that known misstatements will be corrected. However, the auditor would not necessarily 
require all proposed adjustments to be booked. For example, suppose the auditor identifies 
a misstatement in an account receivable for a particular customer in confirming a sample 
of accounts receivable. She or he will likely calculate an estimated or projected error in the

Some Factors That May Lead to a Conclusion That a Quantitatively 
Immaterial Misstatement is Material from a Qualitative Perspective*
	 1.	 The potential effect of the misstatement on trends, especially trends in profitability.
	2.	 A misstatement that changes a loss into income or vice versa.
	3.	 The potential effect of the misstatement on the company’s compliance with loan covenants, other contractual agreements, and regulatory provisions.
	4.	 A misstatement that has the effect of increasing management’s compensation, for example, by satisfying the requirements for the award of bonuses 
or other forms of incentive compensation.
	5.	 The sensitivity of the circumstances surrounding the misstatement, for example, the implications of misstatements involving fraud and possible illegal 
acts, violations of contractual provisions, and conflicts of interest.
	6.	 The effects of misclassifications, for example, misclassification between operating and non-operating income or recurring and non-recurring 
income items.
	 7.	 The significance of the misstatement or disclosures relative to known user needs for example:
	 	 a.  The significance of earnings and earnings per share to public company investors.
	 	 b.  The magnifying effects of a misstatement on the calculation of purchase price in a transfer of interests (buy/sell agreement).
	 	 c.  The effect of misstatements of earnings when contrasted with expectations.
	8.	 The definitive character of the misstatement, for example, the precision of an error that is objectively determinable as contrasted with a misstatement 
that unavoidably involves a degree of subjectivity through estimation, allocation, or uncertainty.
	9.	 The motivation of management with respect to the misstatement, for example, (i) an indication of a possible pattern of bias by management when 
developing and accumulating accounting estimates or (ii) a misstatement precipitated by management’s continued unwillingness to correct weak­
nesses in the financial reporting process.
	10.	 The cost of making the correction. If management has developed a system to calculate an amount that represents an immaterial misstatement, not 
correcting such a difference may reflect a possible bias or motivation on the part of management.

population of accounts receivable based on the sample results (see Chapter 9). The auditor 
will normally expect the entity to correct the specific customer account found to be in error 
but may not require the entity to book the full amount of the projected error in receivables if 
the amount is immaterial. If the likely misstatement for a particular account is greater than the 
tolerable misstatement, the account will require adjustment at least to the point at which the 
likely error remaining is less than tolerable misstatement.
In evaluating misstatements relating to accounting estimates, the auditor should be 
very careful in considering the risk of material misstatement in accounts that are subject to 
estimation. Examples of such estimates include inventory obsolescence, loan loss reserves, 
uncollectible receivables, and warranty obligations. Seldom can accounting estimates be con­
sidered accurate with certainty. If, based on the best audit evidence, the auditor believes the 
estimated amount included in the financial statements is unreasonable, the difference between 
that estimate and the closest reasonable estimate should be treated as a misstatement. The 
closest reasonable estimate may be a range of acceptable amounts or a precisely determined 
point estimate, if that is a better estimate than any other amount (AS14 ¶13). For example, 
suppose that the auditor concludes based on the evidence that the allowance for doubtful 
accounts should be between $210,000 and $270,000. If management’s recorded estimate falls 
within this range (say $250,000), the auditor will likely conclude that the recorded amount is 
reasonable and no difference would be aggregated. If the recorded estimate falls outside this 
range (say $190,000), the difference between the recorded amount and the amount at the clos­
est end of the auditor’s range ($20,000) would be aggregated as a likely misstatement. The 
auditor compares this aggregate misstatement to the overall materiality.
The process of determining whether misstatements are material can become somewhat 
more complicated when misstatements that occurred in prior years were left uncorrected 
because they were deemed immaterial. SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Consider­
ing the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year 
Financial Statements (SAB 108) stipulates that a registrant should evaluate a current year 
misstatement using both of two different methods—the “iron curtain” approach and the “roll­
over” approach. The iron curtain method quantifies the misstatement based on the amount 
required to correct the misstatement in the balance sheet at the period end, regardless of the 
misstatement’s year of origination. Thus, under the iron curtain approach, if a misstatement 
accumulates to a material amount over two or more periods, the entire accumulated misstate­
ment must be corrected. The rollover method, on the other hand, quantifies the misstatement 
based only on the amount of the error that originates in the current year income statement. 
Thus, the rollover approach ignores the effects of uncorrected misstatements that originated 
in prior years that have accumulated on the balance sheet. In other words, the rollover method 
ignores the “carryover effects” of uncorrected prior year misstatements. If a misstatement is 
considered material to the financial statements under either the iron curtain or the rollover 
approach, the registrant’s financial statements would need to be adjusted so that any remain­
ing misstatement would be considered immaterial under either approach.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Qualitative factors can be more important than dollar amount in determining whether a misstatement 
is material. Auditors are particularly sensitive to misstatements that are intentional regardless of their 
size. If the auditor learns of an intentional misstatement introduced by management, even when the 
misstatement is relatively small, he or she may be required to (1) reevaluate the degree of audit risk 
involved in the audit engagement; (2) determine whether to revise the nature, timing, and extent of 
audit procedures; and (3) consider whether to resign from the engagement.
Evaluating Financial Statement Presentation and Disclosure
The entity normally drafts the financial statements, including footnotes. The auditor reviews 
the financial statements to ensure compliance with GAAP, proper presentation of accounts, 
and inclusion of all necessary disclosures. Most public accounting firms use some type of 
financial statement disclosure checklist to assist the auditor in ensuring that all required 

	
Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
579
footnotes have been properly included. In addition, the auditor ensures that numbers and repre­
sentations made in financial statement disclosures are fairly presented in all material respects.
Independent Engagement Quality Review
Most firms have a policy requiring an engagement quality review for publicly traded compa­
nies and for privately held companies whose financial statements are expected to be widely 
distributed.2 The engagement quality reviewer is a partner who is not associated with the 
details of the engagement and is expected to provide an independent, objective review. The 
engagement quality control reviewer performs an objective evaluation of the significant judg­
ments made by the engagement team and the conclusions reached in formulating the auditor’s 
report. She or he discusses significant findings or issues with the engagement partner and 
reads the financial statements and the proposed auditor’s report. The engagement quality 
reviewer reviews selected audit documentation relating to the significant judgments the 
engagement team made and the related conclusions it reached, and evaluates the conclusions 
reached in formulating the auditor’s report. Finally, she or he considers whether the proposed 
auditor’s report is appropriate.
Archiving and Retention
As discussed in Chapter 5, the events leading up to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 focused 
a spotlight on the practice of archiving and retaining audit files. The PCAOB’s “Audit Doc­
umentation” (AS3), requires that firms archive their public company audit files (working 
papers and other documentation) for retention within 45 days following the time the auditor 
grants permission to use the auditor’s report in connection with the issuance of the company’s 
financial statements. The PCAOB’s requires that audit documentation be retained for seven 
years from the date of completion of the engagement, as indicated by the date of the auditor’s 
report, unless a longer period of time is required by law (e.g., pending or threatened lawsuit, 
investigation, or subpoena). Some states (e.g., New York and California) have adopted similar 
(or in some cases even more stringent) archiving and retention policies for all audits, includ­
ing audits of nonpublic companies.
All documents that “form the basis of the audit or review” must be retained. The PCAOB 
requires that any document created, sent, or received, including documents that are incon­
sistent with a final conclusion, be included in the audit files for all significant matters. This 
includes any correspondence between engagement teams and national technical accounting or 
auditing experts in a public accounting firm’s national office. Also, when significant changes 
are made to the planned audit approach at any point during the audit, the final documentation 
should indicate the original plan, modifications to the plan, and the rationale for the change. 
Such document retention is intended to facilitate any subsequent investigations, proceedings, 
and litigation.
Going Concern Considerations
The auditor has a responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an enti­
ty’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. “Going concern” 
in this context means that the “concern” (i.e., entity) is likely to keep “going” (i.e., it is likely 
to be able to keep doing business). In other words, it is a good thing when a company is con­
sidered to be a “going concern.” The issue here is whether the auditor has “substantial doubt” 
about the company’s ability to continue as such for a reasonable period of time. While this 
assessment is made during the planning of the engagement, the auditor must consider this 
issue again near the end of the engagement.

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
Until recently, accounting standards did not require an entity to evaluate its own ability 
to continue in existence as a going concern. This set of circumstances represented a depar­
ture from the standard role of auditors, which is to evaluate and report on management’s 
assertions. However, the FASB recently rectified this situation by issuing Accounting Stan­
dards Update 2014–15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to Continue 
as a Going Concern. With this new accounting standard, an entity’s management must first 
evaluate the entity’s ability to continue in existence as a going concern, and auditors then 
make an independent assessment in order to evaluate the adequacy of management’s going 
concern disclosures.
The new FASB standard requires an entity to evaluate its ability to meet its obligations 
for a “look-forward” period of one year from the financial statement issuance date. In some 
cases, management initially may conclude it is probable the entity will be unable to meet its 
obligations within the look-forward period but develops plans to mitigate that risk. In such 
situations, management can consider its plans as being sufficient to overcome a substantial 
doubt conclusion only if it is probable the plans can be effectively implemented.
If management determines that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its 
obligations within the look-forward period, management is required to make disclosures. If 
management determines that its plans successfully reduce the doubt to less than probable, 
management discloses the principal conditions or events that gave rise to the doubt, its evalu­
ation of the significance of those conditions or events, and an analysis of how its plans will 
successfully reduce the doubt to be less than probable. If management determines that the 
initial substantial doubt has not been sufficiently reduced by its plans, management must 
disclose the same information listed above and in addition must disclose in the footnotes that 
there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern within one year from 
the financial statement issuance date. 
The FASB’s going concern guidance for management is quite consistent with existing 
auditing standards that guide auditors’ going concern evaluations, except that the FASB stan­
dard begins the one-year look-forward period at the financial statement issuance date while 
the auditing literature refers to a one-year look-forward period from the balance sheet date. 
It is likely that auditing standards will be revised to eliminate this inconsistency before the 
FASB standard’s effective date of December 15, 2016. For example, the PCAOB is already 
evaluating potential revisions to its going concern auditing standard and will continue to mon­
itor the activities of the FASB and other standard setters.
Steps in the Auditor’s Going Concern Evaluation
The auditor follows three overall steps in making the going concern evaluation:
	
1.	 Consider whether the results of audit procedures performed during the planning, 
performance, and completion of the audit indicate whether there is substantial doubt 
about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of 
time (one year).
	
2.	 If there is substantial doubt, obtain information about management’s plans to 
mitigate the going concern problem and assess the likelihood that such plans can be 
successfully implemented.
	
3.	 Conclude, in light of management’s plans, whether there is substantial doubt about 
the ability of the entity to continue as a going concern; if substantial doubt exists, 
consider the adequacy of the disclosures about the entity’s ability to continue and 
include an explanatory paragraph in the audit report.
Let’s discuss each of these steps in turn.
Identifying and Assessing Going Concern Problems. Standard audit procedures are 
normally sufficient to identify conditions and events that indicate going concern problems. 
Examples of audit procedures that are likely to identify these kinds of conditions and events 
include risk assessment and analytical procedures, review of subsequent events, tests for com­
pliance with debt agreements, reading the minutes of board of directors’ meetings, inquiry of 

	
Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
581
legal counsel, and confirmations with lenders or investors regarding financial arrangements. 
Auditing standards identify four major categories of such conditions or events: negative finan­
cial trends, other financial difficulties, internal problems, and external matters.
Negative financial trends consist of poor results from operations and adverse financial 
ratios. Analytical procedures performed as part of the auditor’s risk assessment procedures 
during the planning phase of the audit are often particularly helpful in identifying negative 
financial trends. Table 17–3 lists a number of important financial conditions and ratios that 
prior audit research has shown to be good indicators of financial distress that can lead to a 
going concern report. If the entity being evaluated meets a number of these financial condi­
tions and has adverse ratios, the auditor may conclude that there is substantial doubt about the 
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Conditions or events that may occur in the other three categories are shown in Table 17–4. 
Other financial difficulties are particularly important for the going concern assessment. For 
example, if an entity has violated certain debt covenants or is in default on its debt, the debt 
holders may call for immediate payment. In such circumstances, the entity may be unable to 
meet its cash requirements and may have to seek bankruptcy protection or liquidation. Simi­
larly, internal matters such as work stoppages may have severe consequences on the entity. 
Finally, external matters may cause an entity to be unable to continue as a going concern. 
For example, macroeconomic downturns or the loss of even one or two major customers have 
been known to cause companies to face severe financial difficulties.

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
Consideration of Management’s Plans. Once conditions have been identified that indicate 
substantial doubt about the ability of the entity to continue, the auditor considers manage­
ment’s plans for dealing with the adverse effects of the conditions or events. Potential man­
agement responses include the following:
	
∙	 Plans to dispose of assets
	
∙	 Plans to borrow money or restructure debt
	
∙	 Plans to reduce or delay expenditures
	
∙	 Plans to increase ownership equity
For example, management may attempt to sell assets to pay off debt or dispose of 
operations that are losing money. Management may negotiate with creditors in order to 
restructure debt or seek additional financing. Frequently, management will develop plans 
to reduce wages or cut back the workforce. When evaluating management’s plans, the audi­
tor should obtain evidence about the elements of the plans and their likelihood of success. 
This requires examining the assumptions used by management in developing such plans. If 
the auditor concludes that there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue 
as a going concern even after considering management’s plans, the auditor will normally 
issue a modified audit report describing the going concern issue similar to the one shown 
in Chapter 18.
Deciding whether to issue an opinion with a going concern paragraph is a complex pro­
cess and can involve significant difficulty and even conflict with the entity’s management. 
As you might imagine, management can be overconfident about the entity’s prospects and 
sometimes will not agree with the auditor about whether a going concern opinion should 
be issued. The decision is a particularly difficult one because it involves making subjective 
judgments and estimates about future events. Further, a going concern opinion can be a “self-
fulfilling prophecy” in that it can interfere with a company’s ability to obtain capital through 
additional issuances of equity or debt, or even to acquire needed inventory or supplies except 
on a “COD” (cash on delivery) basis. The decision to issue a going concern opinion is one 
that heavily involves the engagement senior manager and partner, often in consultation with 
the accounting firm’s head office.
Now that an accounting standard is in place requiring management to first evaluate the 
likelihood of the entity continuing in existence as a going concern and disclose its conclusions 
in the financial statements, the auditor can use the results of her or his independent evaluation 
to assess the adequacy of management’s assessment and related disclosures.
Communications with Those Charged with Governance 
and Management
Auditing standards require that the auditor communicate certain matters related to the conduct 
of the audit to those individuals responsible for oversight of the entity’s strategic direction and 
its financial reporting process, sometimes referred to as “those charged with governance.” 
For publicly traded companies, “those charged with governance” would typically refer to the 
board of directors, and the audit committee in particular. The intent of this communication 
is to encourage a healthy, two-way dialogue about financial reporting matters and to ensure 
that those charged with governance receive adequate information on significant audit-related 
issues. The objectives of communication with the audit committee are to (1) communicate the 
auditor’s responsibilities and establish an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement 
with the audit committee; (2) obtain information from the audit committee that is relevant to 
the audit; (3) communicate an overview of the overall audit strategy and timing; and (4) pro­
vide timely observations arising from the audit that are significant to the financial reporting 
process. As shown in Table 17–5, there are several important topics organized into three cate­
gories that the auditor should discuss with the audit committee or other responsible body. The 
LO 17-10

	
Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
583
three categories are appointment and retention of the auditor, obtaining information relevant 
to the audit and communicating the audit strategy, and communicating the results of the audit.
All audit committee communications required by auditing standards should be made in 
a timely manner and prior to the issuance of the auditor’s report. Communication regarding 
significant findings from the audit should be in writing when the auditor deems oral com­
munication to be inadequate. Other parts of the communication may be oral or in writing but 
should be documented.
Communications Regarding the Audit of Internal Control 
over Financial Reporting
The auditor also has a number of communication responsibilities with respect to the audit of 
internal control over financial reporting (AS5). The auditor must communicate in writing to 
management and the audit committee all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses 
identified during the audit. The written communication should be made prior to the issuance 
of the auditor’s report on internal control over financial reporting. If a significant deficiency 
or material weakness exists because the oversight of external financial reporting and internal 
control over financial reporting by the company’s audit committee is ineffective, the auditor 
must communicate that specific significant deficiency or material weakness in writing to the 
board of directors. The auditor also must communicate to management, in writing, all control 
deficiencies identified (including deficiencies in internal control that are of a lesser magni­
tude than significant deficiencies—see Chapter 7 for additional details regarding communica­
tion about matters relating to internal control).3
3Auditing Standards also require the auditor to communicate fraud or illegal acts to the appropriate level of manage-
ment, or the audit committee if senior management is involved.
Examples of Communication with Those Charged with Governance
Appointment and Retention of the Auditor
 • Discuss any significant issues that were discussed with management in connection with the initial appointment or retention of the auditor, including any 
significant discussions about applying accounting principles and auditing standards.
 • Establish an understanding of the terms of the audit engagement with the audit committee, which includes communicating the objective of the audit, 
the responsibilities of the auditor, and the responsibilities of management in an engagement letter.
Obtaining Information Relevant to the Audit and Communicating the Audit Strategy
 • Inquire if the audit committee is aware of matters that may be relevant to the audit, including, but not limited to, violations or possible violations of laws 
or regulations.
 • Provide an overview of the overall audit strategy, including the timing of the audit and a discussion of the significant risks identified by the auditor during 
its risk assessment procedures, and communicate the nature and extent of specialized skill or knowledge needed to perform the planned audit procedures 
or evaluate the audit results related to significant risks, the extent to which the auditor plans to use the work of the company’s internal audit function, and 
the basis for the auditor’s determination that it can serve as principal auditor, if significant parts of the audit are to be performed by other auditors.
 • Discuss how the auditor proposes to address the significant risks of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Communicating Results of the Audit
 • Share the auditor’s views about qualitative aspects of the entity’s significant and critical accounting practices, including accounting policies, estimates, 
and financial statement disclosures, and communicate the auditor’s conclusions about the quality of accounting policies and practices.
 • Discuss critical estimates and significant unusual transactions, and considerations relating to assessment of going concern.
 • Disclose disagreements with management, if any.
 • Provide a summary of uncorrected misstatements unless deemed by the auditor to be clearly trivial in nature, and corrected misstatements that were 
brought to management’s attention by the auditor, including whether detected misstatements (whether or not material) may indicate a particular bias in 
the preparation of the financial statements.
 • Summarize representations the auditor is requesting from management.
 • Discuss management’s consultations with other accountants, as well as matters for which the auditor consulted outside the engagement team.
 • Communicate other findings or issues arising from the audit that are, in the auditor’s professional judgment, significant and relevant to those charged 
with governance.

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
Management Letter
In addition to the communications discussed above, the auditor normally prepares a manage­
ment letter. Be sure not to confuse the management letter with the management representation 
letter discussed previously in this chapter. The auditor uses the management letter to make 
recommendations to the entity based on observations during the audit; the letter may include 
suggested improvements in various areas, such as organizational structure and efficiency issues.
Earlier in this chapter we discussed procedures conducted as part of the audit to identify rel­
evant events occurring after the date of the financial statements but before the statements and 
the accompanying audit report are issued. Although an auditor has no obligation to conduct 
any audit procedures after the financial statements and accompanying audit report have been 
issued, facts may come to the auditor’s attention after issuance that might have affected the 
report, had he or she known about them. In Figure 17–1, this would include events occurring 
after March 5, 2016. The most common situation is where the auditor becomes aware that pre­
viously issued financial statements contain material misstatements due to either unintentional 
or intentional actions by management. For example, the auditor may learn that a material 
amount of inventory was not included in the financial statements because of a computer error. 
Alternatively, the auditor may learn that management fraudulently inflated inventory quanti­
ties and prices in an effort to increase reported profits. A number of such situations have 
arisen in recent years (e.g., see Exhibit 17–5). Keep in mind that here we are discussing events 
occurring after the issuance of the financial statements and that would have changed the state­
ments or the auditor’s opinion, had the facts been known prior to issuance. Events that have 
no bearing on the prior period’s financial statements will appropriately be recognized in the 
period in which they occur.
When facts are encountered that may affect the auditor’s previously issued report, the 
auditor should consult with his or her attorney because legal implications may be involved 
and actions taken by the auditor may involve confidential entity–auditor communications. 
The auditor should determine whether the facts are reliable and whether they existed at the 
date of the audit report. The auditor should also discuss the matter with an appropriate level 
of management and, when appropriate, those charged with governance. Finally, the auditor 
should determine whether the financial statements need revision and, if so, inquire how man­
agement intends to address the matter.

New Century Announces Financial Statements Should Not 
Be Relied Upon, Goes Bankrupt
New Century Financial Corporation was, at one point, the second largest originator of subprime loans in 
the United States. New Century’s loan originations had risen from $14 billion in 2002 to about $60 billion 
in 2006. However, on February 7, 2007, New Century began to crumble as it restated its interim earnings 
for the first three quarters of 2006. A combination of allegedly shady accounting, insufficient loan loss 
reserves, and the collapse of the subprime mortgage market eventually led New Century to declare bank­
ruptcy in 2007. In April 2007, KPMG, New Century’s auditor, terminated its relationship with New Century. 
In May, New Century announced that the December 2005 financial statements should no longer be relied 
upon. Litigation against KPMG by New Century’s bankruptcy trustee was settled in August 2010 for nearly 
$45 million.

Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
585
If the auditor determines that the previously issued financial statements are in error and 
the audit report is affected, he or she should request that the entity issue an immediate revision 
to the financial statements. The reasons for the revisions should be described in the footnotes 
to the revised financial statements. If the effect on the financial statements cannot immedi­
ately be determined, the entity should notify persons known to be relying on the financial 
statements and the accompanying auditor’s report. If the stock is publicly traded or subject to 
regulatory jurisdiction, the entity should contact the SEC, stock exchanges, and other regula­
tory agencies as appropriate.
If the entity refuses to cooperate and make the necessary disclosures, the auditor should 
notify the board of directors and take the following steps, if possible:
	
1.	 Notify the entity that the auditor’s report must no longer be associated with the 
financial statements.
	
2.	 Notify any regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the entity that the auditor’s 
report can no longer be relied upon.
	
3.	 Notify each person known to the auditor to be relying on the financial statements. 
(Notifying a regulatory agency such as the SEC is often the only practical way of 
providing appropriate disclosure.)
The practical outcome of these procedures is that the auditor has withdrawn his or her 
report on the previously issued financial statements. In notifying the entity, regulatory agen­
cies, and other persons relying on the auditor’s report, the auditor should disclose the effect 
the information would have had on the auditor’s report, had the information been known to 
the auditor prior to issuance of the report.
KEY TERMS
Analytical procedures. Evaluations of financial information made by an analysis of plausible 
relationships among both financial and nonfinancial data.

estimate for an estimate (e.g., uncollectible receivables), if that is a better estimate than any 
other amount.
Dual dating. The auditor’s report is dual dated when a subsequent event occurs after the date 
on which the auditor has obtained sufficient appropriate audit evidence but before the finan­
cial statements are issued.
Engagement quality review. A review by a quality review partner of the financial statements 
and audit report to ensure the audit was properly conducted and an appropriate report issued.
Legal letter. An audit inquiry sent to the entity’s attorneys in order to obtain or corroborate 
information about litigation, claims, and assessments.
Management letter. A letter from the auditor to management making recommendations to 
the entity based on observations during the audit; the letter may include topics relating to 
organizational structure and efficiency issues.
Representation letter. A letter that corroborates oral representations made to the auditor 
by management or by other auditors and documents the continued appropriateness of such 
representations.
Subsequent event. An event or transaction that occurs after the balance sheet date but prior 
to the issuance of the financial statements and the auditor’s reports that may materially affect 
the financial statements.
Working papers. The auditor’s record of the work performed and the conclusions reached 
on the audit.

J. J. Young, Attorney at Law
123 Main Street
Anytown, USA
Dear J. J. Young:
	
	
	
	
In connection with an audit of our financial statements at December 31, 2015, and for the 
year then ended, management of the company has prepared, and furnished to our auditors, 
Cole & Cole, CPAs, 456 Broadway, Anytown, USA, a description and evaluation of cer­
tain contingencies, including those set forth below involving matters with respect to which 
you have been engaged and to which you have devoted substantive attention on behalf of 
the company in the form of legal consultation or representation. Your response should 
include matters that existed at December 31, 2015. Because of the confidentiality of all 
these matters, your response may be limited.
	
	
	
	
  In November 2015, an action was brought against the company by an outside salesman 
alleging breach of contract for sales commissions and pleading a second cause of action 
for an accounting with respect to claims for fees and commissions. The salesman’s 
action claims damages of $300,000, but the company believes it has meritorious defenses 
to the claims. The possible exposure of the company to a successful judgment on behalf of 
the plaintiff is slight.
	
	
	
	
  In July 2015, an action was brought against the company by Industrial Manufacturing 
Company (“Industrial”) alleging patent infringement and seeking damages of $20 million. 
The action in U.S. District Court resulted in a decision on October 16, 2015, holding that 

	
Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
589
the company had infringed seven Industrial patents and awarding damages of $14 million. 
The company vigorously denies these allegations and has filed an appeal with the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeal process is expected to take 
approximately two years, but there is some chance that Industrial may ultimately prevail.
	
	
	
	
  Please furnish to our auditors such explanation, if any, that you consider necessary to 
supplement the foregoing information, including an explanation of those matters as to 
which your views may differ from those stated and an identification of the omission of any 
pending or threatened litigation, claims, and assessments or a statement that the list of such 
matters is complete. Your response may be quoted or referred to in the financial statements 
without further correspondence with you.
	
	
	
	
  You also consulted on various other matters considered pending or threatened litiga­
tion. However, you may not comment on these matters because publicizing them may alert 
potential plaintiffs to the strengths of their cases. In addition, various other matters prob­
able of assertion that have some chance of an unfavorable outcome, as of December 31, 
2015, are unasserted claims and assessments.

his opinion to accompany the financial statements. In each item a subsequent event is 
described. This event was disclosed to the CPA either in connection with his review 
of subsequent events or after the date on which the auditor has obtained sufficient 
appropriate audit evidence. Describe the financial statement effects, if any, of each 
of the following subsequent events. Each of the five items is independent of the other 
four and is to be considered separately.
	
1.	 A large account receivable from Agronowitz Company (material to financial 
statement presentation) was considered fully collectible at December 31, 2015. 
Agronowitz suffered a plant explosion on January 25, 2016. Because Agronowitz 
was uninsured, it is unlikely that the account will be paid.
	
2.	 The tax court ruled in favor of the company on January 25, 2016. Litigation 
involved deductions claimed on the 2012 and 2013 tax returns. In accrued taxes 
payable, Scornick had provided for the full amount of the potential disallowances. 
The Internal Revenue Service will not appeal the tax court’s ruling.
	
3.	 Scornick’s Manufacturing Division, whose assets constituted 45 percent of 
Scornick’s total assets at December 31, 2015, was sold on February 1, 2016. The 
new owner assumed the bonded indebtedness associated with this property.

	 comments taken from various parts of an auditor’s working paper file. Below items 
1 through 16 is a list of the likely sources of the statements, questions, excerpts, and 
comments. Select, as the best answer for each item, the most likely source. Select 
only one source for each item. A source may be selected once, more than once, or not

1.	 During our audit we discovered evidence of the company’s failure to safeguard 
inventory from loss, damage, and misappropriation.
	
2.	 The company considers the decline in value of equity securities classified as 
available-for-sale to be temporary.
	
3.	 There have been no communications from regulatory agencies concerning non­
compliance with or deficiencies in financial reporting practices.
	
4.	 It is our opinion that the possible liability to the company in this proceeding is 
nominal in amount.
	
5.	 As discussed in Note 4 to the financial statements, the company experienced a net 
loss for the year ended July 31, 2015, and is currently in default under substan­
tially all of its debt agreements. In addition, on September 25, 2015, the company 
filed a prenegotiated voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code. These matters raise substantial doubt about the company’s abil­
ity to continue as a going concern.
	
6.	 During the year under audit, we were advised that management consulted with 
Gonzales & Ramirez, CPAs. The purpose of this consultation was to obtain 
another CPA firm’s opinion concerning the company’s recognition of certain rev­
enue that we believe should be deferred to future periods. Gonzales & Ramirez’s 
opinion was consistent with our opinion, so management did not recognize the 
revenue in the current year.
	
7.	 The company believes that all material expenditures that have been deferred to 
future periods will be recoverable.
	
8.	 Our use of professional judgment and the assessment of audit risk and materiality 
for the purpose of our audit mean that matters may have existed that would have 
been assessed differently by you. We make no representation as to the sufficiency 
or appropriateness of the information in our working papers for your purposes.
	
9.	 Indicate in the space provided below whether this information agrees with your 
records. If there are exceptions, please provide any information that will assist the 
auditor in reconciling the difference.
	
10.	 Blank checks are maintained in an unlocked cabinet along with the check-signing 
machine. Blank checks and the check-signing machine should be locked in sepa­
rate locations to prevent the embezzlement of funds.
	
11.	 The company has insufficient expertise and controls over the selection and appli­
cation of accounting policies that are in conformity with GAAP.
	
12.	 The timetable set by management to complete our audit was unreasonable con­
sidering the failure of the company’s personnel to complete schedules on a timely 
basis and delays in providing necessary information.
	
13.	 Several employees have disabled the antivirus detection software on their PCs 
because the software slows the processing of data and occasionally rings false 
alarms. The company should obtain antivirus software that runs continuously at 
all system entry points and that cannot be disabled by unauthorized personnel.
	
14.	 In connection with an audit of our financial statements, please furnish to our audi­
tors a description and evaluation of any pending or probable litigation against our 
company of which you are aware.
	
15.	 The company has no plans or intentions that may materially affect the carrying 
value or classification of assets and liabilities.
	
16.	 In planning the sampling application, was appropriate consideration given to the 
relationship of the sample to the assertion and to planning materiality?

DISCUSSION CASES
	
LO 17-1, LO 17-2, 	
17-29	 In February 2016, Ceramic Crucibles of America was notified by the state of 
	
17-3	
	 Colorado that the state was investigating the company’s Durango facility to deter­
mine if there were any violations of federal or state environmental laws. In formulat­
ing your opinion on Ceramic Crucibles’ 2015 financial statements, you determine 
that, based primarily on management’s representations, the investigation did not 
pose a serious threat to the company’s financial well-being.
	
	
	 	
The company subsequently retained a local law firm to represent it in dealing 
with the state commission. At the end of 2015, you concluded that the action did 
not represent a severe threat. However, it is now 2016 and you have just received the 
attorney’s letter, which you find a little unsettling. It states:
On January 31, 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) listed the 
Durango site in Durango, Colorado, on the National Priorities List under the Compre­
hensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (Superfund). The 
site includes property adjoining the western boundary of Ceramic Crucibles’ plant 
in Durango and includes parts of Ceramic Crucibles’ property. The EPA has listed 
Ceramic Crucibles as one of the three “potentially responsible parties” (“PRPs”) that 
may be liable for the costs of investigating and cleaning up the site. The EPA has autho­
rized $400,000 for a “Remedial Investigation and Feasibility Study” of the site, but that 
study will not begin until sometime later in 2016. Thus, we do not deem it possible or 
appropriate at this time to evaluate this matter with regard to potential liability or cost 
to the company.
	
	
	 	
You immediately set up a meeting with Dave Buff, Ceramic Crucibles’ vice presi­
dent; Ron Bonner, the company’s attorney; and Margaret Osmond, an attorney who 
specializes in EPA-related issues. At the meeting you ascertain that
	
∙	 Ceramic Crucibles bought the Durango facility from TW Industries in 2005.
	
∙	 TW Industries had operated the facility as a manufacturer of ceramic tiles, and it 
had used lead extensively in incorporating color into the tile.
	
∙	 The site has been placed on the National Priorities List (“the List”) apparently 
because each state must have at least one site on the List. All sites on the List 
are rated on a composite score that reflects the relative extent of pollution. The 
Durango site has a rating of 8.3 compared to a rating of no less than 25 for the 
other sites on the List.

	
Chapter 17    Completing the Audit Engagement	
593
	
∙	 The most severe lead pollution (based on toxicity) is in an area located on the 
other side of a levee behind Ceramic Crucibles’ facilities. Although the area close 
to the building contains traces of lead pollution, the toxicity in this area is about 
50 parts per million (ppm), compared to 19,000 ppm beyond the levee.
	
∙	 Although Ceramic Crucibles used lead in coloring its crucibles until about 2007, 
the lead was locked into a ceramic glaze that met FDA requirements for appli­
ances used in the preparation of food. Apparently, the acids used in determining 
the leaching properties of lead for EPA tests are stronger than that used by the 
FDA. Since 2007, Ceramic Crucibles has used lead-free mud in its crucibles.
	
∙	 Affidavits taken from present and former employees of Ceramic Crucibles indi­
cate that no wastewater has been discharged though the levee since Ceramic Cru­
cibles acquired the property in 2005.
	
∙	 The other PRPs and TW Industries are viable companies that should be in a posi­
tion to meet their responsibilities resulting from any possible EPA action.
	
	
	 	
Materiality for purposes of evaluating a potential loss is $10 million to $13 mil­
lion. This is based on the assumption that the loss would be deductible for income tax 
purposes. In that case, the loss would represent a reduction in stockholders’ equity of 
4.5 percent to 7.0 percent. Your best guess is that the company’s exposure does not 
exceed that amount. Further, based on the financial strength of the company and its 
available lines of credit, you believe such an assessment would not result in financial 
distress to the company.
	
	
	 	
The creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and that of the Com­
prehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act is a result 
of the increasing concern of Americans about pollution. An amendment to the act 
permits the EPA to perform the cleanup. The EPA has a national priorities list of 
several thousand sites thought to be severely damaged. The average cost of con­
ducting remedial investigation and feasibility studies ranges from $750,000 to over 
$1 million, and such studies may take as long as three years. Cleanup costs can often 
exceed $10 million to $12 million. It is said that the current estimates of $100 billion 
to clean up nonfederal hazardous waste sites may be conservative.
	
	
	 	
The law requires the EPA to identify toxic waste sites and request records from 
PRPs. The PRPs are responsible for the cost of cleanup, but if they lack the funds, the 
EPA uses its funds for the cleanup. The EPA has spent $3.3 billion from its trust fund 
and collected only $65 million from polluters since the passage of the legislation.
Required:
	
a.	 How would this type of contingency be classified in the accounting literature, and 
how should it be accounted for?
	
b.	 Would the amount be material to the financial statements?
	
c.	 What additional evidence would you gather, and what kinds of representations 
should you require from the entity?
	
d.	 Should the investigation affect your opinion on those financial statements?
	
LO 17-8	
17-30	 Medical Products, Inc. (MPI) was created in 2013 and entered the optical equipment 
industry. Its made-to-order optical equipment requires large investments in research 
and development. To fund these needs, MPI made a public stock offering, which 
was completed in 2014. Although the offering was moderately successful, MPI’s 
ambitious management is convinced that it must report a good profit this year (2015) 
to maintain the current market price of the stock. MPI’s president recently stressed 
this point when he told his controller, Pam Adams, “If we don’t make $1.25 million 
pretax this year, our stock will tank.”
	
	
	 	
Adams was pleased that even after adjustments for accrued vacation pay, 2015 
pretax profit was $1.35 million. However, MPI’s auditors, Hammer & Bammer 
(HB), proposed an additional adjustment for inventory valuation that would reduce 
this profit to $900,000. HB’s proposed adjustment had been discussed during the 
2014 audit.

594	
Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
	
	
	 	
An additional issue discussed in 2014 was MPI’s failure to accrue executive 
vacation pay. At that time HB did not insist on the adjustment because the amount 
($20,000) was not material to the 2014 results and because MPI agreed to begin 
accruing vacation pay in future years. The cumulative accrued executive vacation 
pay amounts to $300,000 and has been accrued at the end of 2015.
	
	
	 	
The inventory issue arose in 2013 when MPI purchased $450,000 of specialized 
computer components to be used with its optical scanners for a special order. The 
order was subsequently canceled, and HB proposed to write down this inventory in 
2014. MPI explained, however, that the components could easily be sold without a 
loss during 2015, and no adjustment was made. However, the equipment was not 
sold by the end of 2015, and prospects for future sales were considered nonexistent. 
HB proposed a write-off of the entire $450,000 in 2015.
	
	
	 	
The audit partner, Johanna Schmidt, insisted that Adams make the inventory 
adjustment. Adams tried to convince her that there were other alternatives, but 
Schmidt was adamant. Adams knew the inventory was worthless, but she reminded 
Schmidt of the importance of this year’s reported income. Adams continued her 
argument, “You can’t make us take both the write-down and the vacation accrual 
in one year; it doesn’t fairly present our performance this year. If you insist on 
making us take that write-down, I’m taking back the accrual. Actually, that’s a 
good idea because the executives are such workaholics, they don’t take their vaca­
tions anyway.”
	
	
	 	
As Adams calmed down, she said, “Johanna, let’s be reasonable; we want to con­
tinue our good working relationship with your firm into the future. But we won’t 
have a future unless we put off this accrual for another year.”
Required:
	
a.	 Should the auditor insist that the inventory adjustment be made despite the impact 
on MPI’s pre-tax profits?
	
b.	 Irrespective of your decision regarding the inventory adjustment, what is your 
reaction to Adams’ suggestion to release the vacation accrual? Should the auditor 
insist on keeping the accrual of the executives’ vacation pay?
	
c.	 Consider the conflict between Adams and Schmidt. Assuming that Schmidt 
believes the inventory adjustment and vacation pay accrual must be made and that 
she does not want to lose the audit fee from the MPI audit. What should she do?

17-31	 Wyly Waste Management. Wyly Waste Management (“WWM”) is an SEC reg­
istrant and your firm is its auditor. Overall materiality for the audit is $100,000. 
Shortly after the end of the year, WWM’s CFO is meeting with your audit partner 
to review the preliminary results of the audit. The engagement partner presents a 
copy of the draft unadjusted error summary to the CFO, which contains only one 
error. During the year, WWM did not capitalize individual expenditures of less 
than $10,000, which is in accordance with its company policy. In the past, WWM’s 
capital expenditures have been relatively constant each period and the expensing of 
the items has not caused any material errors. In the prior two years, the expensed 
items totaled $7,500 and $5,000, respectively. However, in the current year, WWM 
undertook significant development of a new waste disposal plant. As a result, WWM 
incurred eight capital expenditures of less than $10,000 each that were not capital­
ized. These purchases totaled $75,000.
Required:
	
a.	 Should your partner require WWM to record an adjustment for the expensed 
items in the current year?
	
b.	 Suppose the facts were changed and the expensed items for the prior two years 
totaled $22,500 and $15,000, respectively. Should your partner require WWM to 
record an adjustment for the expensed items in the current year?

Reports on Audited Financial 
Statements
T
his chapter discusses the auditor’s report for audits of financial state­
ments. The audit report is the most important “deliverable” on an audit 
engagement. Whenever an auditor is associated with an entity’s financial 
statements, the auditor must issue a report that contains an opinion regarding 
the financial statements taken as a whole or the reasons why an opinion can­
not be issued. An auditor is associated with financial statements when he or 
she has consented to the use of his or her firm’s name in a document such as 
an annual report.
The purpose of the fourth standard of reporting is to enable shareholders, 
bondholders, bankers, and other third parties who rely on the financial state­
ments to understand the degree of responsibility taken by the auditor. To assist 
in accomplishing this goal, the auditing profession has adopted standardized 
wording for audit reports. As a result, you will notice that most audit reports 
look very much alike. This approach helps prevent misunderstandings in the 
message being communicated by the auditor to the users of the financial state­
ments. At the same time, some argue that the “boilerplate” nature of the audit 
report prevents the auditor from conveying subjective information that could 
be useful to users of the financial statements.
In addition to reporting on financial statements, auditors must also perform 
and report on an audit of internal control over financial reporting for public 
company entities. Chapter 7 discusses the nature of the audit of internal con­
trol over financial reporting and presents the auditor’s reporting requirements 
specific to the audit of internal control.

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
Chapter 1 briefly introduced the standard unqualified financial statement audit report. Such 
a report is issued when the audit has been performed in accordance with applicable auditing 
standards, the auditor has gathered sufficient evidence, and the auditor believes that the finan­
cial statements conform to GAAP in all material respects. In this first section of the chapter, 
we’ll help you understand the auditor’s standard unqualified report, after which we will 
explain and illustrate how the auditor’s report changes when one (or all) of the above require­
ments for issuing a standard unqualified report are not met. However, you should know that 
big changes are in the works for auditor reporting! We will briefly discuss the main elements 
of the coming changes later in the chapter.
The Standard Unqualified Audit Report for Public Companies
Exhibit 18–1 shows the auditor’s standard unqualified audit report for a public company. This 
report contains eight elements: (1) the report title, (2) the addressee, (3) the introductory 
paragraph, (4) the scope paragraph, (5) the opinion paragraph, (6) an explanatory paragraph 
referring to the audit of internal control over financial reporting, (7) the name of the auditor, 
and (8) the audit report date. The EarthWear report shown here refers to the audit of internal 
control and to the PCAOB’s auditing standards because EarthWear is a publicly traded entity 
and is subject to public company auditing and reporting requirements. The report presented 
in Exhibit 18–1 is a separate report on the financial statement audit, but as noted, in addition 
to giving the auditor’s opinion on EarthWear’s financial statements, the report refers to the 
LO 18-1
Reporting on the Financial Statement Audit: 
The Standard Unqualified/Unmodified Audit Report

Title:
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
Addressee:
To the Stockholders of EarthWear Clothiers:
Introductory paragraph:
We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of EarthWear Clothiers as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the 
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended December 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.
Scope paragraph:
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the 
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting 
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used 
and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We 
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Opinion paragraph:
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of the Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of 
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
Explanatory paragraph 
referring to the audit of 
internal control:
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United 
States), the effectiveness of EarthWear Clothiers’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, 
based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 15, 2016, expressed an unqualified 
opinion that EarthWear Clothiers maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting.

auditor’s opinion relating to the audit of internal control over financial reporting. Instead of 
separate reports, the auditor’s opinions on the financial statements and on the effectiveness 
of internal control may be presented together, in a combined report format. However, when 
the two opinions are presented separately, as in Exhibit 18–1, the reports must have the same 
date and each must include an explanatory paragraph referring to the opinion expressed in the 
other report. Chapter 7 addresses reporting on the audit of internal control.
The Standard Unmodified Audit Report for All Entities 
Other Than Public Companies
The ASB’s clarity standards require a different format and some differences in content for audit 
reports relating to non-public companies. While the content of the ASB and PCAOB reports is 
essentially the same, their organization and terminology differ somewhat. Exhibit 18–2 pres­
ents the ASB “unmodified” report. The term “unmodified” in the ASB report is the equivalent 
of the term “unqualified” in the PCAOB report—they both refer to a “clean” opinion. We will 
use these two terms interchangeably throughout the rest of the chapter.
Stop and Think: Take a moment to scan the ASB report and compare it to the PCAOB 
report shown in Exhibit 18–1.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Ekins Cycling, which comprise the consolidated 
balance sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in 
stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.
Management’s responsibility 
paragraph:
Management’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of these consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America; this includes the design, 
implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated 
financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
Auditor’s responsibility 
paragraph:
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We conducted 
our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards 
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial 
statements are free from material misstatement.
Scope paragraph:
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated 
financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the 
risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those 
risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation and fair presentation of 
the consolidated financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, 
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. Accordingly, we 
express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation 
of the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion paragraph:
Opinion
In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial 
position of Ekins Cycling as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the 
years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
As you can see, one of the most noticeable differences is the use of headings for each 
section of the ASB report. Two of these sections clearly delineate management’s and the audi­
tor’s responsibilities. You will note that the content of these paragraphs is nearly identical to 
the introductory and scope paragraphs of the standard unqualified PCAOB report, with the 
exception that the ASB report adds a phrase emphasizing management’s responsibility for the 
design, implementation, and maintenance of internal control relevant to financial statement 
preparation and reporting.
You will also note that the ASB report indicates that the audit was conducted “in accor­
dance with generally accepted auditing standards” and is titled “Independent Auditor’s 
Report.” By comparison, the public company audit report is titled “Report of Independent 
Registered Public Accounting Firm” and indicates that the audit was conducted “in accor­
dance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).” 
Also, as noted earlier, the PCAOB report addresses the audit of internal control over financial 
reporting, which is required for public companies. By contrast, the ASB report indicates that 
while internal control was considered for the purpose of planning the financial statement 
audit, no opinion is expressed on the effectiveness of internal control over financial report­
ing. Private companies can opt to have their audits performed in accordance with PCAOB 
standards, in which case their audit reports must conform to PCAOB standards. Except where 
otherwise noted, we use the ASB’s report in illustrations throughout the rest of this chapter. 
Fortunately, most of the variations from the standard unqualified/unmodified report that are 
covered in this chapter are very similar for public company and non-public company audits. 
However, we highlight notable differences between PCAOB and ASB reporting standards 
where appropriate.
The standard unqualified/unmodified audit report, which we just illustrated and dis­
cussed, is fairly straightforward. Most of the rest of this chapter is devoted to explaining 
various circumstances that require modification of the standard report. We begin with circum­
stances requiring the addition of explanatory language to the standard report either through 
changes in the wording of the existing paragraphs of the report or through the insertion of 
an additional paragraph. We then discuss conditions requiring audit reports other than the 
standard report, including qualified and adverse opinions and the disclaimer of opinion. We 
conclude the chapter by discussing various other “special reporting” issues.
Explanatory Language Added to the Standard 
Unqualified/Unmodified Financial Statement Audit Report
Sometimes circumstances arise that require the auditor to add explanatory language to the 
standard unqualified report. This is accomplished either by adding explanatory language to 
the existing paragraphs of the report (referred to as “modified wording”) or by inserting an 
additional explanatory paragraph, depending on the circumstances.
Modified Wording for Opinion Based in Part on the Report 
of Another Auditor
Explanatory language is added to the auditor’s responsibility and opinion paragraphs of the 
report when an auditor’s opinion is based in part on the report of another auditor. On some 
audit engagements, parts of the audit may be completed by a separate, unaffiliated public 
accounting firm. For example, in reporting on consolidated financial statements, one of the 
entity’s subsidiaries might be located in a foreign country where the auditor of the parent 
company does not have a strong presence and thus may request that another firm audit these 
subsidiaries. In such cases, the auditor for the parent company must be satisfied that he or 
she is the “principal auditor.” This is normally determined by the portion of the consolidated 
financial statements audited by the parent-company auditor in relation to the portion of the 
consolidated financial statements audited by the other independent auditors.

The principal auditor at this point must decide whether or not to refer to the other auditors 
in the report. The principal auditor first assesses the professional reputation and independence 
of the other auditors. If the principal auditor is satisfied as to the professional reputation and 
independence of the other auditors and the quality of their audit work, an opinion may be 
expressed without referring to the work of the other auditors in the audit report. In so doing, 
the principal auditor accepts full responsibility for the work done and conclusions drawn by 
the other auditors.
However, in most situations where the subsidiary represents a material amount in the 
consolidated financial statements, the principal auditor refers to the other auditors. In refer-
encing the other auditors, the principal auditor is sharing responsibility for the audit report 
with the other auditors.
The portion of the consolidated financial statements audited by the other auditors is dis-
closed in the report. Exhibit 18–3 shows excerpts of a report in which the principal auditor has 
referred to the other auditors (only the affected parts of the report are shown and the modified 
wording is shown in italics so you can easily see what the differences are). Generally, even 
though the other auditors are referenced in the report, the name of the other firm is not stated 
in the audit report. You’ll note in Exhibit 18–3 that the auditor’s responsibilities and opinion 
paragraphs contain additional explanatory wording, but no additional explanatory paragraph 
is necessary. When this situation arises in an audit conducted under PCAOB standards, the 
introductory and opinion paragraphs are modified in a similar fashion.
If the other auditor’s report is not a standard unqualified audit report, the principal audi-
tor needs to determine the nature of the departure and its significance in relation to the overall 
financial statements. If the departure is not material to the financial statements of the overall 
entity, the principal auditor need not refer to the departure in his or her report. If the principal 
auditor assesses that the departure is material to the overall financial statements, it may be 
necessary to refer to the issue giving rise to the other auditor’s qualified opinion and how the 
departure affects the overall audit opinion.
Opinion Based in Part on the Report of Another Auditor
[Standard title, addressee, introductory, and management’s responsibility paragraphs wording.]
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We did not 
audit the financial statements of Furillo Company, a wholly owned subsidiary, whose statements reflect 
total assets of $25,450,000 and $23,750,000 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and total 
revenues of $42,781,000 and $40,553,000 for the years then ended. Those statements were audited 
by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the 
amounts included for Furillo Company, is based solely on the report of the other auditors.
[Standard scope paragraph.]
Opinion
In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, the consolidated financial state-
ments referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, 
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Circumstances Requiring Explanatory Language  
in an Additional Paragraph
There are four situations that require the auditor to add an explanatory paragraph to a standard 
unqualified report on an entity’s financial statements. They are as follows:
	
1.	 Reference to the report on the audit of internal control for public companies.
	
2.	 Substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern.

602	
Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
	
3.	 Lack of consistency in the application of accounting principles due to accounting 
changes.
	
4.	 The need for additional emphasis.
These four situations all lead to the addition of an explanatory paragraph following the 
opinion paragraph.1 Note that no modification to the wording of the introductory, scope, or 
opinion paragraphs is necessary. The audit reports that are issued in these situations are con­
sidered unqualified opinions despite the addition of an explanatory paragraph. We’ve already 
discussed the need for the financial statement audit report for a public company to include a 
paragraph referring to the audit of ICFR when the report on the audit of ICFR is presented 
separately from the financial statement audit report. We’ll discuss each of the other three situ­
ations in turn, but first we’ll discuss some differences in terminology between PCAOB and 
ASB standards relating to these additional paragraphs.
While the PCAOB standards refer to all such paragraphs simply as “explanatory para­
graphs,” the ASB’s standards, which apply to audits of all entities except for public com­
panies, refer to explanatory paragraphs as either “emphasis-of-matter” or “other-matter” 
paragraphs. An emphasis-of-matter paragraph refers to a matter that has been appropriately 
presented or disclosed in the financial statements. An emphasis-of-matter paragraph is used 
when the auditor has substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, 
when there is a lack of consistency in the financial statements, or when the auditor wishes to 
emphasize a particular matter, if such items have been appropriately disclosed in the financial 
statements. An emphasis-of-matter paragraph would also be used under ASB standards when 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with a special purpose framework 
other that GAAP. An other-matter paragraph refers to a matter other than those presented or 
disclosed in the financial statements but that, in the auditor’s judgment, is relevant to users’ 
understanding of the audit, the auditor’s responsibilities, or the auditor’s report. For exam­
ple, an other-matter paragraph is used when the auditor’s opinion on prior period financial 
statements differs from the opinion the auditor previously expressed (for example, a previ­
ously qualified opinion on prior period financial statements has been changed to unqualified 
because the financial statements have been restated) or when the distribution of the auditor’s 
report is to be restricted to particular users. Like the explanatory paragraph in a report for a 
public company, emphasis-of-matter or other-matter paragraphs are placed after the opinion 
paragraph, but under the section heading “Emphasis of Matter” or “Other Matter.” While the 
term explanatory paragraph has a slightly more general meaning than the term emphasis-of-
matter paragraph, we use these terms interchangeably throughout the text for simplicity.
Going Concern  A basic assumption that underlies financial reporting is that an entity will 
continue as a going concern (i.e., that it will stay in business). As discussed in Chapter 17, 
auditing standards state that the auditor has a responsibility to independently evaluate whether 
there is substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern for a reason­
able period of time, not to exceed one year beyond the date of the financial statements being 
audited. The auditor uses this independent assessment to ensure that management’s going 
concern assessment has been adequately conducted and disclosed.
When the auditor concludes that there is substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to 
continue as a going concern, the auditor should consider the possible effects on the financial 
statements and the related disclosures. If management has adequately disclosed the entity’s 
financial problems, the audit report typically will express an unqualified opinion but will 
include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph to emphasize the auditor’s doubt about the enti­
ty’s ability to continue as a going concern (see Exhibit 18–4). In rare cases of extreme and 
1Until 2009, another condition existed that could result in the addition of explanatory language to an unqualified 
auditor’s report. In certain circumstances, if the auditor agreed with the entity that following GAAP would mislead 
financial statement users, the auditor could issue an unqualified opinion on financial statements that were not in 
accordance with GAAP and add an explanatory paragraph to describe the situation. The exception was very rarely 
invoked and was essentially eliminated with the FASB’s adoption of the Accounting Standards Codification in  
September 2009.

immediate financial distress (e.g., impending bankruptcy), the auditor may disclaim an opin­
ion on the entity. If the entity’s disclosures with respect to its ability to continue as a going 
concern are inadequate, a departure from GAAP exists, resulting in a qualified or an adverse 
opinion (discussed later in this chapter).
Stop and Think: Suppose that the conditions that raised substantial doubt about the 
entity’s ability to continue as a going concern in the prior period, and thus resulted in 
the prior period auditor report to include an emphasis-of-matter paragraph, were recti­
fied in the current period. How do you think the current period’s auditor report on the 
comparative financial statements would be affected?
If an entity received a going concern report in the prior period and the substantial doubt 
regarding going concern is removed in the current period, the emphasis-of-matter paragraph 
included with the prior year’s audit report is not included with the auditor’s report covering 
the comparative financial statements.
Lack of Consistency  A fundamental principle of accounting is that financial statements 
should be consistent and comparable across periods. Accordingly, the auditor’s standard 
unqualified audit report implies that the comparability of the financial statements is not mate­
rially affected by inconsistent use of accounting principles. When such an implication is not 
valid, under some circumstances the auditor must add an explanatory paragraph to the report. 
FASB ASC Topic 250, “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections,” governs the accounting 
for changes in accounting principles. From the auditor’s perspective, accounting changes can 
be categorized into (1) changes that affect both comparability and consistency in the applica­
tion of accounting principles and (2) changes that affect comparability but that do involve 
inconsistency in the application of accounting principles.
Changes Affecting Comparability and Consistency  If an entity makes a change in an 
accounting principle or in the method of its application that materially affects the comparabil­
ity and the consistency of the financial statements, the auditor must decide whether she or he 
concurs with the change. If the auditor concurs, she or he will issue an unqualified opinion 
but would add a discussion of the change in an explanatory or emphasis-of-matter paragraph 
to highlight the lack of consistency. Auditing standards (AU-C 708) refer to the following 
accounting changes as affecting both comparability and consistency and requiring an explana­
tory or emphasis-of-matter paragraph:
	
1.	 Change in accounting principle. An example is a change from straight-line 
depreciation to an accelerated method for depreciating equipment.
	
2.	 Change in reporting entity. An example is the consolidation of a major subsidiary’s 
financial statements with the parent company’s financial statements in the previous 
year and accounting for the subsidiary on a cost or equity basis in the current year.
Unqualified/Unmodified Financial Statement Audit Report with an 
Emphasis-of-Matter Paragraph for Going-Concern Problems
[Standard introductory, management’s responsibility, auditor’s responsibility, scope, and opinion paragraphs]
Emphasis of Matter
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as 
a going concern. As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring 
losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to con­
tinue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 6. The 
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
E X H I B I T  1 8 – 4 

604	
Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
While the vast majority of audit opinions issued to entities are unqualified/unmodified, the 
auditor has the option to issue opinions that depart from the unqualified report when circum­
stances indicate a need. Three such types of audit reports are available to the auditor. We’ll 
first discuss the conditions that indicate a need for audit reports that depart from the unquali­
fied report, and then we’ll explain the nature of these reports.
	
3.	 Correction of a misstatement in previously issued financial statements. This 
includes two situations: first, a change in the use of an accounting principle in prior 
years (for example, replacement cost for inventory) to an acceptable accounting 
principle (such as FIFO) in the current year and, second, adjustments to correct a 
material misstatement in previously issued financial statements.
An explanatory or emphasis-of-matter paragraph highlighting an accounting change that 
results in a lack of consistency would contain wording such as the following: “As discussed in 
Note 7 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of computing deprecia­
tion on fixed assets from the straight-line to the double-declining balance method in 2015.” 
Note that adding an explanatory or emphasis-of-matter paragraph does not eliminate the audi­
tor’s responsibility to evaluate the adequacy of the required financial statement disclosures 
relating to accounting changes and corrections of errors.
Some changes in accounting principles might have no material effect in the current year 
but are expected to have a material effect in future years. In such circumstances, the change 
in principles should be included in the footnotes to the financial statements, but the auditor’s 
report does not need to include an explanatory paragraph in the current year.
Changes Affecting Comparability but Not Consistency  Other changes may affect compara­
bility but not consistency in the use of accounting principles. These include:
	
1.	 Change in accounting estimate. A change in an accounting estimate, such as 
reducing the expected service life of a garbage truck from 7 to 5 years, can affect the 
comparability of financial statements with no change in accounting principles.
	
2.	 Change in classification and reclassification. A change in classification but not in 
accounting principle occurs when a balance is classified differently from one period 
to the next, such as when an item that was included in operating expenses last year is 
included in administrative expenses in the current year.
Changes that affect comparability but not consistency in the application of accounting 
principles are normally disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Such changes do not 
require an explanatory/emphasis-of-matter paragraph in the auditor’s report.
Additional Emphasis  Under certain circumstances an auditor may want to emphasize a 
specific matter regarding the financial statements even though he or she intends to express 
an unqualified or unmodified opinion. Such information is presented in an explanatory/
emphasis-of-matter paragraph. Two examples of situations that might cause the auditor to 
add explanatory language in an emphasis-of-matter paragraph are significant related-party 
transactions that are appropriately disclosed by the entity and important events occurring after 
the balance sheet date.
Practice 
INSIGHT
FASB ASC Topic 250 requires “retrospective application” for accounting changes and corrections of 
errors. Retrospective application is the application of a different accounting principle to one or more 
previously issued financial statements, or to the statement of financial position at the beginning of 
the current period as if that principle had always been used.
Departures from an Unqualified/Unmodified Financial 
Statement Audit Report

	
Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements	
605
Practice 
INSIGHT
Keep in mind that an unqualified opinion on the financial statement audit does not necessarily 
mean that the opinion on the audit of internal control over financial reporting will be unqualified. 
In fact, an auditor can issue an adverse opinion on the audit of internal control, and still issue an 
unqualified opinion on the financial statement audit if the audit evidence supports the conclusion 
that the financial statements are fairly presented. This often occurs because misstatements existing 
in the financial statements at year-end can be corrected prior to issuance, allowing for a “clean” 
financial statement audit opinion. However, a material weakness in internal control that exists at 
year-end necessitates an adverse opinion on the entity’s internal control.
Types of Financial Statement Audit Reports Other Than 
Unqualified/Unmodified
The three types of reports available to the auditor other than unqualified are2
	
1.	 Qualified. The auditor qualifies his or her opinion when either a scope limitation or 
a specific departure from GAAP exists, but overall the financial statements present 
fairly in conformity with GAAP. If the auditor decides to qualify a report for a 
scope limitation, the report describes why the limitation arose and indicates that the 
financial statements present fairly except for the possible effects of the limitation. If 
the auditor qualifies a report for a GAAP departure, the report describes the nature 
and impact of the faulty accounting and indicates that the financial statements 
present fairly except for the effects of the departure. Note that a qualified report 
always uses the words “except for.”
	
2.	 Disclaimer. The auditor disclaims an opinion on the financial statements either 
because there is insufficient appropriate evidence to form an opinion on the overall 
financial statements or because there is a lack of independence. In a disclaimer the 
auditor explains the reasons for withholding an opinion and explicitly indicates that 
no opinion is expressed.
	
3.	 Adverse. The auditor issues an adverse opinion when the financial statements do 
not present fairly due to a GAAP departure that materially affects the financial 
statements overall. In an adverse report the auditor explains the nature and size of the 
misstatement and states the opinion that the financial statements do not present fairly 
in accordance with GAAP.
LO 18-4
2Note that PCAOB and ASB terms are the same for the following list of reports other than unqualified/unmodified.
Conditions for Departure
To this point we have been discussing the unqualified audit report, with or without additional 
modified wording or explanatory paragraphs. Let’s now take a look at the circumstances in 
which an audit report might depart from an unqualified opinion. An auditor may be unable to 
express such an opinion in three situations:
	
1.	 Scope limitation. A scope limitation results from an inability to collect sufficient 
appropriate evidence, such as when management or some set of circumstances 
prevents the auditor from conducting an audit procedure that the auditor considers 
necessary.
	
2.	 Departure from GAAP. A departure from GAAP exists when the financial 
statements are prepared or presented in a manner that conflicts with GAAP, whether 
due to error or fraud.
	
3.	 Lack of independence of the auditor. A lack of independence arises when the 
auditor and the entity have any financial, business, or personal relationship prohibited 
by professional standards. The auditor must comply with the second general 
standard and Section 1.200 of the Code of Professional Conduct in order to issue an 
unqualified opinion.
LO 18-3

606	
Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
The choice of audit report depends on both the nature and the materiality of the condition 
giving rise to the departure from the unqualified report. Figure 18–1 presents an overview of 
the auditor’s reporting options, including the type of report to be issued under various condi­
tions, together with the effect of materiality. We believe you will find Figure 18–1 to be very 
helpful to your understanding of auditor reporting—study it carefully!
The Effect of Materiality on Financial Statement Reporting
The concept of materiality plays a major role in the auditor’s choice of audit reports. If the 
auditor judges a departure from GAAP to be immaterial, a standard unqualified audit report 
can be issued. As the materiality of the condition increases, the auditor must judge the effect 
of the item on the financial statements overall. Auditing standards (AU-C 705) use the term 
pervasive to describe the potential effect of a scope limitation or departure from GAAP on the 
auditor’s report. Pervasive effects on the financial statements are those that
	
∙	 are not confined to specific elements, accounts, or items of the financial statements;
	
∙	 if so confined, represent or could represent a substantial proportion of the financial 
statements; or
	
∙	 with regard to disclosures, are fundamental to users’ understanding of the financial 
statements (¶ 6).

Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements	
607
As you can clearly see, applying this guidance requires a great deal of professional judg­
ment by the auditor, and these issues can be topics of intense and sometimes even contentious 
discussion between management and the auditor.
Stop and Think: Using Figure 18–1, think through the logical process of how an audi­
tor would decide on the appropriate report to give when there is a scope limitation?
When the auditor is faced with a scope limitation, the assessment of the omitted 
procedure(s) should include the nature and magnitude of the potential effects of the financial 
statement area that the auditor was unable to examine and its significance to the overall finan­
cial statements. If the potential effects relate to many items in the financial statements or if 
the effect of the item is so significant that the auditor considers the financial statements taken 
as a whole to be unreliable, the auditor will likely issue a disclaimer rather than a qualified 
report. For example, suppose an auditor is unable to perform certain audit procedures consid­
ered necessary in determining the fairness of an entity’s inventory balance, which represents 
approximately 10 percent of total assets. In such a situation, the auditor would probably con­
sider the item material but not pervasive, and thus would most likely issue a qualified opin­
ion. However, if inventory represented a larger percentage of total assets (e.g., 30 percent), 
the effect likely would be considered material and pervasive and would lead the auditor to 
disclaim an opinion on the financial statements. Where to draw the line is a matter of profes­
sional judgment on the part of the auditor.
Judgments concerning the effects of a departure from GAAP are handled similarly. If the 
departure from GAAP is judged to be immaterial, the auditor issues an unqualified opinion. 
If the auditor considers the departure from GAAP to be material but not pervasive, the audi­
tor will issue a qualified opinion. If the departure is seen by the auditor as material and perva­
sive, the auditor will issue an adverse opinion. For example, suppose that an entity accounts 
for leased assets as operating leases despite the fact that proper accounting requires that the 
leases be capitalized. If an entity has only one small piece of equipment that is accounted 
for inappropriately, the auditor will probably issue an unqualified opinion because the item 
is not material. However, if the entity has many significant leased assets that are accounted 
for as operating leases instead of capitalized leases, the auditor will normally issue either a 
qualified or adverse opinion, depending on the magnitude of the problem and its effect on the 
reliability of the financial statements overall.
In some cases, an issue can be considered material even if the magnitude does not reach 
conventional materiality levels in terms of magnitude. For example, if the auditor discovers 
that management has intentionally introduced an otherwise immaterial error into the financial 
statements in order to meet analysts’ earnings forecasts, auditing standards indicate that the 
auditor is to consider this departure to be material in view of its nature, even if it does not rise 
to conventional levels of materiality in quantitative terms.
Although materiality is important in considering scope limitations and departures from 
GAAP, note that materiality is not a factor in considering an auditor’s independence. When 
according to the Code of Professional Conduct or other rules an auditor is not independent, the 
auditor must disclaim an opinion regardless of the significance of the condition that resulted 
in the lack of independence!
Discussion of Conditions Requiring Other Types 
of Financial Statement Audit Reports
Scope Limitation
A scope limitation results from an inability to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence about 
some component of the financial statements. This occurs because the auditor is unable to 
apply all the audit procedures considered necessary either because of restrictions on the scope 

608	
Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
of the audit imposed by the client or by the circumstances of the engagement. Auditors should 
be particularly cautious when a client restricts the scope of the engagement, because in such 
a situation the client may be trying to prevent the auditor from discovering material misstate­
ments. Auditing standards suggest that when restrictions imposed by the client significantly 
limit the scope of the engagement, the auditor should consider disclaiming an opinion on the 
financial statements. However, some scope limitations arise due to reasons beyond the control 
of the client, such as a fire that destroys accounting records. If the auditor can overcome such 
a scope limitation by acquiring sufficient, appropriate evidence about the area in question 
through alternative procedures, a standard unqualified/unmodified audit report can be issued.
A number of these types of situations can occur on audit engagements. For example, 
circumstances may prevent the auditor from observing the period-end physical inventory 
count. This could be the case if the auditor is not engaged to conduct the audit until after the 
end of the period. If such deficiencies in audit evidence cannot be overcome by employing 
other auditing procedures, the auditor will have to issue a qualified opinion or a disclaimer, 
depending on the materiality of the inventory account. Exhibit 18–5 shows an example of a 
disclaimer of opinion due to a scope limitation.
Another example occurs when a client requests that the auditor not confirm accounts 
receivable because of concerns over customer relations. If the auditor is satisfied that the cli­
ent’s reasons for not confirming are legitimate and is unable to apply alternative audit proce­
dures to determine fairness of the receivables, he or she would qualify the opinion or disclaim 
an opinion depending on the materiality of accounts receivable in the context of the financial 
statements. Exhibit 18–6 presents an example of a qualified report for a scope limitation.
Note that in both examples the paragraph that explains the scope limitation is presented 
before the opinion or disclaimer paragraph. As illustrated in Figure 18–1, the reporting 
options for a scope limitation are to qualify the opinion or to disclaim an opinion, depending 
on the materiality of the limitation.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The SEC does not accept filings of public company registrants that include qualified or adverse audit 
opinions resulting from a departure from GAAP or qualified or disclaimers of opinions resulting from 
a management-imposed scope limitation. Thus, management must make whatever adjustments are 
necessary to receive a clean audit opinion before filing audited financial statements with the SEC.
Disclaimer of Financial Statement Audit Opinion—Scope Limitation
[Standard wording for introductory and management’s responsibility paragraphs.]
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on conducting the audit in accordance with auditing stan­
dards generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of the matters described in the Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion para­
graph, however, we were not able to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion.
[Scope paragraph of standard report is omitted]
Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion
The Company’s investment in XYZ Company, a joint venture, is carried at $25,000,000 on the Company’s balance sheet, which repre­
sents over 90 percent of the Company’s net assets as of December 31, 2015. We were not allowed access to the management and the 
auditors of XYZ Company. As a result, we were unable to determine whether any adjustments were necessary relating to the Company’s 
proportional share of XYZ Company’s assets that it controls jointly, its proportional share of XYZ Company’s liabilities for which it is jointly 
responsible, its proportional share of XYZ Company’s income and expenses for the year, and the elements making up the statements of 
changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows.
Disclaimer of Opinion
Because of the significance of the matter described in the Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion paragraph, we have not been able to obtain 
sufficient appropriate audit evidence to provide a basis for an audit opinion. Accordingly, we do not express an opinion on these finan­
cial statements.

Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements	
609
Statements Not in Conformity with GAAP
If the financial statements are materially affected by a departure from GAAP, the auditor 
should express a qualified or adverse opinion, depending on the pervasiveness of the misstate­
ment. Examples of these types of departures include the use of an accounting principle that is 
not acceptable, inadequate disclosure, or an unjustified change in accounting principle.
When the financial statements include the use of an accounting principle that is not 
acceptable, the auditor should issue a qualified or adverse opinion, depending on materiality. 
When the auditor expresses a qualified opinion, a separate paragraph is added to the report 
before the opinion paragraph. The paragraph discloses the effects of the departure on the 
financial statements. Note that whenever a qualified opinion is issued, the opinion paragraph 
will include the words “except for.” Exhibit 18–7 is an example of a report that is qualified 
because of the use of an accounting principle that is not in accordance with GAAP.
If the departure’s effect is so pervasive that the financial statements taken as a whole do 
not fairly present the entity’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in accor­
dance with GAAP, the auditor should issue an adverse opinion. When an adverse opinion is 
issued, the auditor should add a paragraph just before the opinion paragraph discussing the 
reasons for the adverse opinion and the effects of the departure on the financial statements. 
The opinion paragraph is modified to state that the financial statements do not present fairly 
in conformity with GAAP. Exhibit 18–8 is an example of an adverse report.

is included in net income for the years then ended as described in Note 10 to the financial statements; nor were we able to satisfy ourselves 
as to the carrying value of the investment in the foreign affiliate or the equity in its earnings by other auditing procedures.

Basis for Qualified Opinion
The Company has excluded, from property and debt in the accompanying balance sheets, certain lease obligations that, in our opin­
ion, should be capitalized in order to conform with generally accepted accounting principles. If these lease obligations were capitalized, 
property would be increased by $7,500,000 and $7,200,000, long-term debt by $6,900,000 and $6,600,000, and retained earnings by

$220,000 and earnings per share would be increased by $.25 and $.22, respectively, for the years then ended.
Qualified Opinion
In our opinion, except for the effects of not capitalizing certain lease obligations as discussed in the preceding paragraph, the financial 
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company as of December 31, 2015 and 
2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.

As illustrated in Figure 18–1, a disclaimer of opinion is not an option when there is a 
known departure from GAAP. In such a case, the auditor’s opinion will either be qualified or 
adverse, depending on the level of materiality of the GAAP departure.
Practice 
INSIGHT
An explanatory or emphasis-of-matter/other-matter paragraph used to call attention to a specific 
matter that does not affect the audit opinion follows the opinion paragraph, while a paragraph that 
discusses the basis for a qualified or adverse opinion is placed before the opinion paragraph.
Adverse Financial Statement Audit Opinion—Not in Conformity with Gener­
ally Accepted Accounting Principles
[Standard wording for the introductory, management’s responsibility, auditor’s responsibility, and scope paragraphs]
Basis for Adverse Opinion
As discussed in Note 6 to the financial statements, the Company carries its property, plant, and equipment accounts at appraisal values and 
determines depreciation on the basis of such values. Generally accepted accounting principles require that property, plant, and equipment 
be stated at an amount not in excess of cost, reduced by depreciation based on such amount. Because of the departures from gener­
ally accepted accounting principles identified above, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, inventories have been increased 
$1,500,000 and $1,340,000 by inclusion in manufacturing overhead of depreciation in excess of that based on cost; property, plant, and 
equipment, less accumulated depreciation, is carried at $13,475,000 and $12,950,000 in excess of an amount based on the cost to the 
Company. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, cost of goods sold has been increased $4,200,000 and $3,600,000, respec­
tively, because of the effects of the depreciation accounting referred to above, resulting in a decrease in net income of $2,520,000 and 
$2,160,000, respectively.
Adverse Opinion
In our opinion, because of the effects of the matters discussed in the preceding paragraph, the financial statements referred to above do 
not present fairly, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, the financial position of 
Morton Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, or the results of its operation or its cash flows for the years then ended.
E X H I B I T  1 8 – 8
If an entity fails to disclose information in the financial statements or footnotes as required 
by GAAP (e.g., significant related-party transactions), the auditor should issue a qualified or 
adverse report, depending on the materiality of the omission. The auditor should provide the 
omitted information in the report, if practicable, unless the auditor is specifically not required 
by auditing standards to do so. For example, one situation in which the auditor would modify 
the opinion but would not have to provide the missing information is where the client has 
declined to include a statement of cash flows. Auditing standards do not require that the audi­
tor prepare a statement of cash flows when one has been omitted by the client.
As a practical matter, qualified and adverse reports are quite rare because most clients are 
willing to make the financial statement adjustments needed in order to obtain a clean opinion. 
This is especially true for public companies, because the SEC does not accept qualified or 
adverse opinions in filings from registrants. Thus, the option to issue such opinions provides 
great leverage to the auditor.
Auditor Not Independent
Much of the value that users of financial statements place on the auditor’s report is based 
on the assumption of an unbiased relationship between the auditor and the entity (see 
Chapter 19). It is extremely unlikely that an auditor would knowingly agree to audit an entity’s 
financial statements where independence between the two parties did not exist. However, it is 
possible, for example, that an auditor could enter an engagement believing that all members 
of the audit team were independent of the entity only to find later that a member of the audit 
team had a prohibited financial interest in the entity. When the audit firm’s independence is 
jeopardized in this manner, the audit report consists only of two sentences such as these: “We 
are not independent with respect to Jordan Company, Inc. Accordingly, we do not express an 

	
Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements	
611
opinion on the accompanying balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and the related state­
ments of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended.”
In other words, if it is found that the auditor is not independent, a disclaimer of opinion 
must be issued. In the disclaimer, the auditor should not state the reasons for the lack of inde­
pendence or describe any audit procedures performed. This requirement is intended to prevent 
the auditor from attempting to minimize or explain away the circumstances.
Special Reporting Issues
In addition to the types of audit reports just discussed, auditors often encounter a number of 
special reporting issues that affect the financial statement audit report. Three topics are cov­
ered in the remainder of this section of the chapter:
	
∙	 Reports on comparative financial statements.
	
∙	 Other information in documents containing audited financial statements.
	
∙	 Special reports.
Reports on Comparative Financial Statements
When an entity presents financial statements for the current period together with those for 
one or more prior periods, the auditor’s report refers to the prior-period financial statements 
presented on a comparative basis. Exhibit 18–1 shows an unqualified standard audit report 
on EarthWear’s comparative financial statements covering the balance sheets for two years 
and statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for three years. Normally, 
the date of the auditor’s report on the comparative statements is the date of the most recently 
completed audit.
During the current-year audit, the auditor should be alert for events that may affect prior-
period financial statements. We’ll discuss three relatively common situations involving com­
parative financial statements.
Different Reports on Comparative Financial Statements
A number of situations may cause the auditor to express different reports on comparative 
financial statements. One example is when the auditor previously expressed a standard 
unmodified opinion on prior years’ financial statements but qualifies the current-year opinion.
Stop and Think: Suppose that an entity inappropriately decides not to capitalize cer­
tain lease obligations in the current year. In prior years, the entity did not have capital­
ized lease obligations, so the financial statements for those years conformed to GAAP. 
How would the auditor’s report be affected by this decision?
In this situation the auditor would issue a report similar to a qualified report for a depar­
ture from GAAP but would clarify that the departure only affects the current year’s financial 
statements. For example, the opinion paragraph could read “In our opinion, except for the 
effects on the 2015 financial statements of not capitalizing certain lease obligations as dis­
cussed in the preceding paragraph, the financial statements referred to . . . [same wording as 
for the remainder of the standard opinion paragraph].”
Another situation occurs when the report on the current year is unmodified but prior-
period financial statements were qualified or were disclaimed. Exhibit 18–9  presents an 
example of a report issued when an auditor was hired after the observation of the physical 
inventory in the prior year, which resulted in a disclaimer of opinion on results of operations 
LO 18-6

612	
Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
and cash flows for the next period (note: this is because ending inventory for one year enters 
into the determination of results of operations and cash flows of the following year). At the 
end of the prior year and in the current year, the auditor was able to conduct the audit without 
any scope limitation and thus issues an unmodified opinion on the prior year’s balance sheet 
and on all of the current year’s financial statements.
A Change in Report on the Prior-Period Financial Statements
During the course of the current year’s audit, the auditor may encounter circumstances or 
events that require updating the report issued on the prior-period financial statements. For 
example, the auditor may have issued a qualified or adverse opinion in the prior year because 
the entity had not followed GAAP. If the entity conforms to GAAP in the current year and 
appropriately restates the prior-period results, the auditor should express an unmodified opin­
ion on the restated prior-period financial statements if they are presented along with the cur­
rent period statements as comparatives. Exhibit 18–10 is an example of such a report. Note 
that the other-matter paragraph comes after the opinion paragraph and contains the date of 
the previous report, the type of opinion previously issued, the reasons for the previous report 
being issued, and mention of the fact that the current report differs from the previously issued 
Comparative Report When the Prior Year Was Disclaimed for a Scope 
Limitation and the Current Year Received an Unmodified Opinion
[Standard wording for the introductory, management’s responsibility, and auditor’s responsibility paragraphs]
Except as explained in the following paragraph, we conducted our audits in accordance with . . . [same wording as for the remainder of the 
standard scope paragraph].
Basis for Disclaimer of Opinion on 2014 Operations and Cash Flows
We did not observe the taking of the physical inventory as of December 31, 2013, since that date was prior to our appointment as auditors 
for the Company, and we were unable to satisfy ourselves regarding inventory quantities by means of other auditing procedures. Inven­
tory amounts as of December 31, 2013, enter into the determination of net income and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Disclaimer of Opinion on 2014 Operations and Cash Flows
Because of the matter discussed in the preceding paragraph, the scope of our work was not sufficient to enable us to express, and we do 
not express, an opinion on the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Opinion
In our opinion, the balance sheets of RUUD Rubber Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of income, 
retained earnings, and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2015, present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position 
of RUUD Rubber Company as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended 
December 31, 2015 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
E X H I B I T  1 8 – 9
Change in the Report on the Prior-Period Financial Statements
[Standard wording for the introductory, management’s responsibility, auditor’s responsibility, scope, and opinion paragraphs]
Other Matter
In our report dated March 1, 2015, we expressed an opinion that the 2014 financial statements did not fairly present financial position, 
results of operations, and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America because 
of two departures from such principles: (1) the Company carried its property, plant, and equipment at appraisal values and provided for 
depreciation on the basis of such values; and (2) the Company did not provide for deferred income taxes with respect to differences 
between income for financial reporting purposes and taxable income. As described in Note 8, the Company has changed its method of 
accounting for these items and restated its 2014 financial statements to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America. Accordingly, our present opinion on the 2014 financial statements, as presented herein for comparative pur­
poses, is different from that expressed in our previous report.

report. In this example, after the entity conformed to GAAP in accounting for property, plant, 
and equipment and for deferred taxes and restated the prior-period financial statements, the 
auditor issued an unmodified report for both the current and prior years.
Report by a Predecessor Auditor
When an entity has changed auditors, the predecessor auditor can reissue, at the request of 
the entity, his or her report on the financial statements of prior periods when those prior state­
ments are presented for comparative purposes. In such a situation, the predecessor auditor 
must determine if the previously issued reports are still appropriate, given the current circum­
stances. The predecessor auditor should do the following before reissuing the report:
	
1.	 Read the financial statements of the current period.
	
2.	 Compare the prior-period financial statements on which the predecessor previously 
reported with the current-year financial statements on which the successor will report.
	
3.	 Obtain a letter of representations from the current-year, successor auditor.
The letter of representations from the successor auditor should indicate whether the suc­
cessor auditor discovered any material items that might affect, or require disclosure in, the 
financial statements reported on by the predecessor auditor. If the predecessor auditor is satis­
fied that the financial statements previously reported on should not be revised, he or she reis­
sues the audit report using the date of the previous report.
In the event that the predecessor auditor becomes aware of circumstances or events that 
may affect the previously issued financial statements, he or she should make inquiries and 
perform any procedures considered necessary. For example, the successor auditor may dis­
cover errors indicating that the prior year’s financial statements were materially misstated. If 
the prior-period financial statements are restated, the predecessor auditor should revise the 
report as necessary and dual date the reissued report.
If the prior-period financial statements have been audited but the predecessor auditor’s 
report will not be included, the successor auditor indicates in the report’s introductory para­
graph that the financial statements for the prior period were audited by other auditors and 
mentions the date and the type of report issued by the predecessor auditor. If the predeces­
sor’s report was not standard (i.e., unqualified), the successor auditor should describe the 
nature of and reasons for the departure from the standard report as laid out in the predeces­
sor’s report.
Other Information in Documents Containing Audited 
Financial Statements
An entity may publish documents, such as annual reports and registration statements, that 
contain other information in addition to the audited financial statements and the audit report. 
Auditing standards provide guidance for the auditor’s consideration of other information con­
tained in (1) annual reports of entities and (2) other documents to which the auditor devotes 
attention at the entity’s request.
The auditor is required to read the other information and consider whether such informa­
tion is consistent with the information contained in the audited financial statements. However, 
the auditor has no obligation to perform any audit procedures to corroborate the other infor­
mation contained in the report and has no responsibility for information that is not financial in 
nature. For example, the audited financial statements may show a 10 percent increase in sales 
and a 5 percent increase in net income. If the president’s letter that is included in the annual 
report stated that sales were up 15 percent and net income increased by 12 percent, a material 
inconsistency would exist. The auditor would then have to determine whether the financial 
statements or the president’s letter required revision. If the financial statements were correct, 
LO 18-7

614	
Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
the auditor would request that the president change the other information. If the president 
refused to change the other information that is inconsistent with the financial statements, the 
auditor should include an explanatory or other-matter paragraph in the audit report, withhold 
the report, or withdraw from the engagement depending on the severity of the circumstances.
Special Reports Relating to Financial Statements
Auditing standards require the auditor to report on whether the financial statements conform 
to GAAP. Auditors, however, are sometimes engaged to report on financial statements that 
are not prepared on the basis of GAAP. Auditors also may be engaged to report on specific 
parts of the financial statements or on an entity’s compliance with contractual agreements 
or regulatory requirements relating to audited financial statements. Special reports are more 
common for private entities than for public companies. Auditing standards provide the auditor 
with specific guidance for such engagements and cover the auditor’s reporting responsibilities 
for the following situations:
	
∙	 Financial statements prepared on a basis of accounting other than GAAP (e.g., the 
cash basis of accounting).
	
∙	 Specified elements, accounts, or items of a financial statement.
	
∙	 Compliance with aspects of contractual agreements or regulatory requirements 
related to audited financial statements.
Financial Statements Prepared According to a Special 
Purpose Framework
One type of special report is employed when an entity has prepared its financial statements 
on a basis other than GAAP, or in other words, a “special purpose framework.” Auditing stan­
dards define special purpose financial statements as those prepared under the following bases:
	
∙	 Regulatory basis. The basis used to comply with the requirements or financial 
reporting provisions of a governmental regulatory agency. An example would be 
when an insurance company reports in compliance with the rules of a state insurance 
commission.
	
∙	 Tax basis. The basis the entity uses to file its income tax return. Real estate 
partnerships frequently use this basis for reporting to partners.
	
∙	 Cash (or modified cash) basis. The entity reports on revenues when received and 
expenses when paid. The cash basis may be modified to record depreciation or to 
accrue income taxes.
	
∙	 Contractual basis. The basis the entity uses to comply with an agreement between 
the entity and one or more third parties other than the auditor.
The introductory paragraph identifies the financial statements on which a report is being 
issued. It is important that these financial statements be titled so that they are not confused 
with financial statements prepared on a GAAP basis. For example, if the financial statements 
are prepared on a tax basis, the report uses the terms statement of assets, liabilities, and 
capital–income tax basis instead of balance sheet, and statement of revenues and expenses–
income tax basis instead of statement of income or operations.
The management’s responsibility, auditor’s responsibility, and scope paragraphs are basi­
cally identical to those included in the standard unmodified audit report. The opinion para­
graph is a positive statement about the fairness of presentation in conformity with the special 
purpose framework being used, similar to the opinion paragraph in the standard unmodified 
report. The report also includes an emphasis-of-matter paragraph after the opinion paragraph 
that describes the special purpose framework being used.
LO 18-8

	
Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements	
615
If the financial statements are prepared on a regulatory basis, a paragraph such as the fol­
lowing is added to restrict the distribution of the report to those parties within the entity and 
those involved in filing with the regulatory agency:
Our report is intended solely for the information and use of Great Atlantic Insurance Company and 
for filing with the Excelsior State Insurance Agency and is not intended to be and should not be 
used by anyone other than these specified parties.
Specified Elements, Accounts, or Items of a Financial Statement
In some situations an auditor may be engaged to report on only specific parts of the financial 
statements. Examples include a report on rentals, royalties, or profit participation, or on the 
provision for income taxes. The basis of accounting for the elements, accounts, or items may 
be GAAP or a special purpose framework.
An engagement to express an opinion on one or more specified elements, accounts, or 
items of a financial statement may be performed as a separate engagement or as part of an 
audit of financial statements. The only exception is when the auditor is engaged to report on 
the entity’s net income or stockholders’ equity. In this case, the auditor must audit the entire 
set of financial statements.
Generally, the procedures applied in an audit of an element, account, or item are more 
extensive than if the same information were considered as part of an audit of the overall finan­
cial statements. Thus, materiality needs to be set in relation to the individual element, account, 
or item and the auditor should consider how the item relates to other parts of the financial 
statements. For example, if the auditor is engaged to audit the entity’s accounts receivable, 
other accounts such as sales and allowance for bad debts should also be considered.
Suppose an auditor is engaged to issue a special report on gross sales for an entity whose 
building lease payment is contingent on the total amount of sales for the period, such as might 
be the case with a department store that rents space in a shopping mall. The audit report’s 
introductory paragraph states that only this specific account was audited. Similar to the stan­
dard unmodified audit report, the management’s responsibility and auditor’s responsibility 
paragraphs state management’s and the auditor’s responsibilities with respect to that specific 
account. The scope paragraph differs from the scope paragraph in the standard report only in 
that it references the specific account being audited rather than the financial statements. The 
opinion paragraph expresses the auditor’s opinion on the specified account. Finally, in the 
case when the specified element, account, or item is audited in compliance with the provi­
sions of a contract or agreement, the auditor includes a paragraph limiting distribution of the 
report to the parties who are part of the contract.
Rather than auditing specified elements, accounts, or items, an auditor may be engaged 
to perform only a set of agreed-upon procedures, as specified by the entity hiring the audi­
tor. Chapter 21 provides more information on agreed-upon procedures engagements and the 
associated report.
Compliance Reports Related to Audited Financial Statements
An auditor may be asked to report on an entity’s compliance with certain contractual agree­
ments or regulatory requirements that are related to audited financial statements. For exam­
ple, loan agreements may include covenants such as restrictions on dividends or maintenance 
of certain levels for selected financial ratios (for example, maintaining a current ratio of 
2 to 1). Exhibit 18–11 is an example of a special report related to compliance with contractual 
provisions. Note that the auditor provides negative assurance as to the entity’s compliance 
with the provisions of the loan agreement. Negative assurance consists of a statement that 
in applying the specified procedures nothing came to the auditor’s attention that indicated 
that the provisions of the loan agreement had not been complied with. Note that in express­
ing negative assurance the auditor does not express an affirmative opinion about the client’s 
compliance with the loan provisions. In other words, the auditor does not use the words “In 
our opinion. . . .”

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
A Demand for More Information and Insight from Auditors  The auditor’s report is 
the key deliverable that communicates the results of the audit process. This chapter offers a 
fairly in-depth introduction to the current audit reporting model in the United States for public 
companies and non-public entities. But your understanding would be incomplete if we didn’t 
clue you in on the fact that big changes are coming to the audit reporting model!
At the beginning of this chapter we told you that some stakeholders in the financial 
reporting process have argued that the “boilerplate” nature of the current audit reporting 
model precludes the auditor from conveying subjective information and insights that could be 
useful to users of the financial statements. While financial statement users have signaled that 
they value the current auditor’s report, many have called for the auditor’s report to be more 
informative and relevant. Some have even argued that the current pass/fail model of audit 
reporting should give way to a more subjective, nuanced audit opinion, indicating gradations 
in entities’ financial reporting quality and reliability.
Although the coming changes will retain the binary, pass/fail reporting model, the IAASB 
has adopted new standards that will increase the amount of subjective information conveyed 
by the auditor to financial statement users. These standards are effective for audits of financial 
statements relating to periods ending after December 15, 2016. The PCAOB and the ASB 
have active projects on their standard-setting agendas that will bring similar changes to audits 
of U.S. public and non-public entities
An Overview of Reporting Changes Coming to IAASB Standards  For purposes of 
alerting you to the coming changes, for two reasons we offer an overview of the IAASB stan­
dards that have already been adopted for use in countries that follow international auditing 
standards. First, PCAOB and ASB standards have not been finalized as of the writing of this 
edition, and second, at this point it appears that the substance of the U.S. audit reporting stan­
dards currently under development likely will be very similar to those adopted by the IAASB.
Key Enhancements in the New IAASB Reporting Standards
The new IAASB reporting standards require two key enhancements in the audit reports for 
“listed” (i.e., public) entities, which are available for voluntary adoption by non-listed entities:
	
1.	 A new section in the report to communicate key audit matters (KAM—currently 
referred to as critical audit matters, or CAM in proposed PCAOB standards). KAM 
are those matters that, in the auditor’s judgment, were of most significance in the 
audit of the current-period financial statements. The process for identifying KAM to 
include in the audit report begins with auditor communications with those charged 
with governance (usually the audit committee in the United States). From the 
LO 18-11
Report on Compliance with Contractual Provisions Given in a Separate Report
We have audited, in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of 
America, the balance sheet of Lynch Lumber Company as of December 31, 2015, and the related state­
ment of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended, and have issued our report 
thereon dated February 16, 2016.
In connection with our audit, nothing came to our attention that caused us to believe that the Company 
failed to comply with the terms, covenants, provisions, or conditions of sections 6.1 to 6.14, inclusive, of the 
indenture dated July 21, 2014, with First State Bank insofar as they relate to accounting matters. However, 
our audit was not directed primarily toward obtaining knowledge of such noncompliance.
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the board of directors and management of 
Lynch Lumber Company and First State Bank and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone 
other than these specified parties.
E X H I B I T  1 8 – 1 1
Big Changes Coming to Audit Reporting

	
Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements	
617
matters communicated with those charged with governance, the auditor selects those 
matters that required significant auditor attention during the course of the audit. In 
identifying matters that require significant auditor attention, the auditor explicitly 
considers the following:
	
∙	 Areas of higher assessed risks of material misstatement
	
∙	 Significant auditor judgments relating to areas in the financial statements that 
involved significant management judgment
	
∙	 The effect on the audit of significant events or transactions that occurred during 
the year
	
	
Finally, from the matters that required significant auditor attention, the auditor 
uses judgment to select those matters that were of the most significance in the audit 
of the financial statements of the current period. These matters are considered 
key audit matters. In reporting KAM in the audit report, the auditor explains why 
each matter was considered to be of significance, describes how each matter was 
addressed in the audit, and refers readers to the financial statement disclosures 
relevant to each matter.
	
2.	 Disclosure of the name of the engagement partner in the audit report. This item 
is a more controversial issue in the United States, where auditor litigation is more 
prevalent. The PCAOB is exploring ways to implement a similar requirement but 
is meeting considerable resistance from both auditors and audited entities. Thus, it 
remains to be seen if this requirement will be included in U.S. standards, and if so, 
what form it will take.
In addition to these two major changes in audit reporting requirements for listed entities (i.e., 
public companies), the new IAASB reporting standards will require four key audit report 
enhancements for all audits:
	
∙	 The Opinion section of the report will be presented first, followed by a Basis for 
Opinion section, explaining the rationale for the opinion.
	
∙	 Auditor reporting on going concern will be enhanced, with the audit report including 
a description of the respective responsibilities of management and the auditor, and a 
separate section or paragraph titled “Material Uncertainty Related to Going Concern” 
when a material uncertainty exists and is adequately disclosed.
	
∙	 The audit report will include a statement that the auditor is independent and that the 
auditor has fulfilled all relevant ethical responsibilities as defined by the principles and 
rules of professional conduct under which the auditor operates (see Chapter 19 to learn 
about the Code of Professional Conduct applicable to auditors in the United States).
	
∙	 The audit report will include an enhanced description of the responsibilities of the 
auditor and the key features of an audit.
Anticipated Benefits of the New IAASB Reporting Standards
The IAASB believes that the new auditor’s report will be more transparent and will provide 
more information and insight to stakeholders in the financial reporting process. In addition, 
the board hopes that the report’s new emphasis on key audit matters will enhance communica­
tion between auditors and investors and between auditors and those charged with governance 
and thus improve the quality of financial reporting. Finally, a requirement for the auditor to 
report on key (or critical) audit matters could sharpen auditors’ sense of professional skepti­
cism in dealing with these matters during the audit.
The current model for the auditor’s report has been in place for several decades with very 
little change but as you can see, significant changes are coming. We believe these changes, 
if planned and implemented carefully, will enhance the value of the audit report. We also 
believe these changes are likely just the beginning of what will prove to be a long and interest­
ing process of experimentation and change for the auditor’s report—stay tuned!

KEY TERMS
Adverse opinion. The auditor’s opinion that the financial statements do not present fairly in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or other basis of accounting) due 
to a pervasively material misstatement.
Disclaimer of opinion. The auditor’s indication that no opinion is expressed on the financial 
statements. The auditor will disclaim an opinion if a pervasive scope limitation arises or if it 
is determined that the auditor lacks independence.
Explanatory paragraph. A paragraph that is used under certain circumstances to provide 
additional explanation to users of the financial statements. Explanatory paragraphs do not 
affect the auditor’s unqualified/unmodified opinion. Under GAAS, an explanatory paragraph 
that refers to a matter appropriately presented or disclosed in the financial statements is known 
as an emphasis-of-matter paragraph, while a paragraph that refers to matters other than those 
presented or disclosed in the financial statements is known as an other-matter paragraph.
Generally accepted auditing standards. Standards against which the quality of the auditor’s 
performance is measured.
Materiality. The maximum amount by which the auditor believes the financial statements 
could be misstated and still not affect the decisions of users.
Qualified opinion. The auditor’s opinion that the financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or other basis 
of accounting), except for a material misstatement that does not, however, pervasively affect 
users’ ability to rely on the financial statements. Can also be issued for a scope limitation that 
is of limited significance.
Reasonable assurance. A term that implies some risk that a material misstatement could be 
present in the financial statements without the auditor detecting it, even when the auditor has 
exercised due care.
Representation letter. A letter that corroborates oral representations made to the auditor 
by management or by other auditors and documents the continued appropriateness of such 
representations.
Scope limitation. A lack of evidence that may preclude the auditor from issuing a clean opin­
ion, usually resulting from an inability to conduct an audit procedure considered necessary.
Special purpose financial statements. Financial statements prepared under cash basis, tax 
basis, regulatory basis, or contractual basis (formerly referred to as “other comprehensive 
basis of accounting”).
Unqualified/Unmodified opinion. The auditor’s opinion that the financial statements pres­
ent fairly, in all material respects, the client’s financial position, results of operations, and 
cash flows in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or other basis of 
accounting)—i.e., a “clean” opinion.

MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTIONS
All applicable questions are available with Connect. 
	
LO 18-1, 18-2	
18-10	 In which of the following situations would an auditor ordinarily issue an unqualified/
unmodified financial statement audit opinion with no explanatory (or emphasis-of-
matter/other-matter) paragraph?
	
a.	 The auditor wishes to emphasize that the entity had significant related-party 
transactions.
	
b.	 The auditor decides to refer to the report of another auditor as a basis, in part, for 
the auditor’s opinion.
	
c.	 The entity issues financial statements that present financial position and results of 
operations but omits the statement of cash flows.
	
d.	 The auditor has substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a going 
concern, but the circumstances are fully disclosed in the financial statements.
	
LO 18-1, 18-2	
18-11	 A public entity changed from the straight-line method to the declining balance 
method of depreciation for all newly acquired assets. This change has no material 
effect on the current year’s financial statements but is reasonably certain to have a 
substantial effect in later years. The client’s financial statements contain no material 
misstatements and the auditor concurs with this change. If the change is disclosed in 
the notes to the financial statements, the auditor should issue a report with a(n)
	
a.	 “Except for,” qualified opinion.
	
b.	 Explanatory paragraph.
	
c.	 Unqualified opinion.
	
d.	 Consistency modification.
	
LO 18-1, 18-2	
18-12	 An auditor includes a separate paragraph in an otherwise unmodified financial state­
ment audit report to emphasize that the entity being reported upon had significant 
transactions with related parties. The inclusion of this separate paragraph
	
a.	 Is appropriate and would not negate the unmodified opinion.
	
b.	 Is considered an “except for” qualification of the opinion.
	
c.	 Violates generally accepted auditing standards if this information is already dis­
closed in footnotes to the financial statements.
	
d.	 Necessitates a revision of the opinion paragraph to include the phrase “with the 
foregoing explanation.”

dures. King’s financial statement audit report most likely contained a(n)
	
a.	 Qualified opinion.
	
b.	 Disclaimer of opinion.
	
c.	 Unmodified opinion.
	
d.	 Unmodified opinion with an emphasis-of-matter paragraph.
	
LO 18-6	
18-17	 Comparative financial statements for a public company include the prior year’s state­
ments, which were audited by a predecessor auditor. The predecessor’s report is 
not presented along with the comparative financial statements. If the predecessor’s 
report was unqualified, the successor should
	
a.	 Express an opinion on the current year’s statements alone and make no reference 
to the prior year’s statements.
	
b.	 Indicate in the auditor’s report that the predecessor auditor expressed an unquali­
fied opinion.
	
c.	 Obtain a letter of representations from the predecessor concerning any matters 
that might affect the successor’s opinion.

18-19	 Which of the following best describes the auditor’s responsibility for “other informa­
tion” included in the annual report to stockholders that contains financial statements 
and the auditor’s report?
	
a.	 The auditor has no obligation to read the “other information.”
	
b.	 The auditor has no obligation to corroborate the “other information” but should 
read the “other information” to determine whether it is materially inconsistent 
with the financial statements.
	
c.	 The auditor should extend the examination to the extent necessary to verify the 
“other information.”
	
d.	 The auditor must modify the auditor’s report to state that the other information “is 
unaudited” or “is not covered by the auditor’s report.”
	
LO 18-8	
18-20	 When reporting on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting used for

	 LO 18-1, 18-2, 18-3, 	
18-22	 For each of the following independent situations, indicate the type of financial 
	
18-4, 18-8 	
	 statement audit report that you would issue and briefly explain your reasoning. 
Assume that all companies mentioned are private companies and that each item is at 
least material.
	
a.	 Barefield Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sandy, Inc., is audited by 
another CPA firm. As the auditor of Sandy, Inc., you have assured yourself of the 
other CPA firm’s independence and professional reputation. However, you are 
unwilling to take complete responsibility for its audit work.
	
b.	 The management of Bonner Corporation has decided to exclude the statement of 
cash flows from its financial statements because it believes that its bankers do not 
find the statement to be very useful.
	
c.	 You are auditing Diverse Carbon, a manufacturer of nerve gas for the military, 
for the year ended September 30. On September 1, one of its manufacturing 
plants caught fire, releasing nerve gas into the surrounding area. Two thousand 
people were killed and numerous others paralyzed. The company’s legal counsel 
indicates that the company is liable and that the amount of the liability can be

Part 6    Completing the Audit and Reporting Responsibilities
reasonably estimated, but the company refuses to disclose this information in the 
financial statements.
	
d.	 During your audit of Cuccia Coal Company, the controller, Tracy Tricks, refuses 
to allow you to confirm accounts receivable because she is concerned about com­
plaints from her customers. You are unable to satisfy yourself about accounts 
receivable by other audit procedures and you are concerned about Tracy’s true 
motives.
	
e.	 On January 31, Asare Toy Manufacturing hired your firm to audit the company’s 
financial statements for the prior year. You were unable to observe the client’s 
inventory on December 31. However, you were able to satisfy yourself about the 
inventory balance using other auditing procedures.
	
f.	 Gelato Bros., Inc., leases its manufacturing facility from a partnership controlled 
by the chief executive officer and major shareholder of Gelato. Your review of the 
lease indicates that the rental terms are in excess of rental terms for similar build­
ings in the area. The company refuses to disclose this related-party transaction in 
the footnotes.
	
g.	 Johnstone Manufacturing Company has used the double-declining balance method 
to depreciate its machinery. During the current year, management switched to the 
straight-line method because it felt that it better represented the utilization of the 
assets. You concur with its decision. All information is adequately disclosed in 
the financial statements.
	 LO 18-1, 18-2, 18-3, 	
18-23	 For each of the following independent situations, indicate the reason for and the type 
	
18-4, 18-8 	
	 of financial statement audit report that you would issue. Assume that all companies 
mentioned are private companies and that each item is at least material.
	
a.	 Thibodeau Mines, Inc., uses LIFO for valuing inventories held in the United 
States and FIFO for inventories produced and held in its foreign operations.
	
b.	 Walker Computers is suing your client, Super Software, for royalties over patent 
infringement. Super Software’s outside legal counsel assures you that Walker’s 
case is completely without merit.
	
c.	 In previous years, your client, Merc International, has consolidated its Panama­
nian subsidiary. Because of restrictions on repatriation of earnings placed on 
all foreign-owned corporations in Panama, Merc International has decided to 
account for the subsidiary on the equity basis in the current year. You concur with 
the change.
	
d.	 In prior years, Worcester Wool Mills has used current market prices to value its 
inventory of raw wool. During the current year, Worcester changed to FIFO for 
valuing raw wool.
	
e.	 Upon review of the recent history of the lives of its specialized automobiles, Gas 
Leak Technology justifiably changed the service lives for depreciation purposes 
on its autos from five years to three years. This change resulted in a material 
amount of additional depreciation expense.
	
f.	 During the audit of Brannon Bakery Equipment, you found that a material amount 
of inventory had been excluded from the company’s financial statements. After 
discussing this problem with management, you become convinced that it was an 
unintentional oversight. Management appropriately corrected the error prior to 
your finalization of field work.
	
g.	 Jay Rich, CPA, holds 10 percent of the stock in Rothenburg Construction Com­
pany. The board of directors of Rothenburg asks Rich to conduct its audit. Rich 
completes the audit and determines that the financial statements present fairly in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.
	
h.	 Ramamoorthi Savings and Loan’s financial condition has been deteriorating for 
the last five years. Most of its problems result from loans made to real estate devel­
opers in Saint Johns County. Your review of the loan portfolio indicates that there 
should be a major increase in the loan-loss reserve. Based on your calculations, 

	
Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements

the proposed writedown of the loans will put Ramamoorthi into violation of the 
state’s capital requirements. The client refuses to make the adjustment or to dis­
close the possible going concern issue in the notes to the financial statements.

18-25	 Devon, Inc., a private company, engaged Rao to examine its financial statements for 
	
18-4, 18-6 	
	 the year ended December 31, 2015. The financial statements of Devon, Inc., for the 
year ended December 31, 2014, were examined by Jones, whose March 30, 2015, 
auditor’s report expressed an unqualified opinion. The report of Jones is not pre­
sented with the 2015–2014 comparative financial statements.
	
	
	 	
Rao’s working papers contain the following information that is not reflected in 
footnotes to the 2015 financial statements as prepared by Devon, Inc.:
	
	∙	 One member of Devon’s board of directors, who was appointed in 2015, was for­
merly a partner in Jones’ accounting firm. Jones’ firm provided financial consult­
ing services to Devon during 2013 and 2012, for which Devon paid approximately 
$1,600 and $9,000, respectively.
	
	∙	 Devon refused to capitalize certain lease obligations for equipment acquired in 
2015. Capitalization of the leases in conformity with generally accepted account­
ing principles would have increased assets and liabilities by $312,000 and 
$387,000, respectively; decreased retained earnings as of December 31, 2015, by 
$75,000; and decreased net income and earnings per share by $75,000 and $.75, 
respectively, for the year then ended. Rao has concluded that the leases should 
have been capitalized.
	
	∙	 During the year, Devon changed its method of valuing inventory from the first-in, 
first-out method to the last-in, first-out method. This change was made because 
management believes LIFO more clearly reflects net income by providing a closer 
matching of current costs and current revenues. The change had the effect of reduc­
ing inventory at December 31, 2015, by $65,000 and net income and earnings per 
share by $38,000 and $.38, respectively, for the year then ended. The effect of the 
change on prior years was immaterial; accordingly, the change had no cumulative 
effect. Rao supports the company’s position, agreeing that it is justified.
	
	
	 After completing the fieldwork on February 28, 2016, Rao concludes that the expres­
sion of an adverse opinion is not warranted.
Required:
	
	
	 Prepare the body of Rao’s report, addressed to the board of directors, dated 
February 28, 2016, to accompany the 2015–2014 comparative financial statements.

Modern includes a provision for depreciation of buildings and equipment. Kristen &

of December 31, 2013, because that date was prior to its appointment as auditor. 
Friday was unable to satisfy itself regarding inventory by means of other auditing 
procedures, so it did not express an opinion on the other basic financial statements 
that year.
	
	
	 	
For the year ended December 31, 2015, Friday expressed an unqualified opinion 
on all the basic financial statements and satisfied itself as to the consistent applica­
tion of generally accepted accounting principles. The fieldwork was completed on 
March 12, 2016; the partner-in-charge reviewed the working papers and signed the

terey is a privately held company that prepares its financial statements on the income 
tax basis of accounting. The report was submitted to the engagement partner, who 
reviewed matters thoroughly and properly concluded that an unmodified opinion 
should be expressed. The draft of the report prepared by an inexperienced staff audi­
tor is as follows:
Auditor’s Report
	
	
	 We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Monterey Partnership, 
which comprise the statements of assets, liabilities, and capital–income tax basis as 
of December 31, 2015, and the related statements of revenue and expenses–income 
tax basis and of changes in partners’ capital accounts–income tax basis for the year 
then ended, and the related notes to the financial statements.

	
Chapter 18    Reports on Audited Financial Statements	
625
Auditor’s Responsibility
	
	
	 We conducted our audit in accordance with standards established by the AICPA. 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assur­
ance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.
	
	
	 	
An audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend 
on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material mis­
statement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. An audit also 
includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used as well as evalu­
ating the overall presentation of the financial statements.
	
	
	 	
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate 
to provide a basis for our audit opinion.
Opinion
	
	
	 In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all 
material respects, the assets, liabilities, and capital of Monterey Partnership as of 
December 31, 2015, and its revenue and expenses and changes in partners’ capital 
accounts for the year then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles applied on a consistent basis.
Basis of Accounting
	
	
	 We draw attention to Note 2 of the financial statements, which describes the basis 
of accounting. The financial statements are prepared on the basis of accounting the 
Partnership uses for income tax purposes. Accordingly, these financial statements 
are not designed for those who do not have access to the Partnership’s tax returns. 
Our opinion is not modified with respect to this matter.

DISCUSSION CASE
	
LO 18-2	
18-29	 You are auditing the financial statements for your new client, Paper Packaging Cor­
poration, a manufacturer of paper containers, for the year ended March 31, 2016. 
Paper Packaging’s previous auditors had issued a going concern opinion on the 
March 31, 2015, financial statements for the following reasons:
	
	
	 ∙	 Paper Packaging had defaulted on $10 million of unregistered debentures sold to 
three insurance companies, which were due in 2015, and the default constituted a 
possible violation of other debt agreements.
	
	
	 ∙	 The interest and principal payments due on the remainder of a 10-year credit 
agreement, which began in 2011, would exceed the cash flows generated from 
operations in recent years.
	
	
	 ∙	 The company had disposed of certain operating units. The proceeds from the sale 
were subject to possible adjustment through arbitration proceedings, the outcome 
of which was uncertain at year-end.
	
	
	 ∙	 Various lawsuits were pending against the company.
	
	
	 ∙	 The company was in the midst of tax proceedings as a result of an examination of 
the company’s federal income tax returns for a period of 12 years.

	 You find that the status of the above matters is as follows at year-end, March 31, 
2016:
	
	
	 ∙	 The company is still in default on $4.6 million of the debentures due in 2015 but 
is trying to negotiate a settlement with remaining bondholders. A large number of 
bondholders have settled their claims at significantly less than par.
	
	
	 ∙	 The company has renegotiated the 2011 credit agreement, which provides for 
a two-year moratorium on principal payments and interest at 8 percent. It also 
limits net losses ($2.25 million for 2016) and requires a certain level of defined 
cumulative quarterly operating income to be maintained.
	
	
	 ∙	 The arbitration proceedings were resolved in 2016.
	
	
	 ∙	 The legal actions were settled in 2014.
	
	
	 ∙	 Most of the tax issues have been resolved, and, according to the company’s out­
side legal counsel, those remaining will result in a net cash inflow to the company.
	
	
	 At year-end, Paper Packaging had a cash balance of $5.5 million and expects to gen­
erate a net cash flow of $3.2 million in the upcoming fiscal year.

Professional Conduct, Independence, 
and Quality Control
A
fter 29 years of working his way up within the firm, Scott London had 
risen to serve as KPMG’s senior partner for the firm’s Pacific Southwest 
audit practice. While he served as the managing partner for Herbalife 
and Skechers, London began passing inside information from the companies 
to his friend, Bryan Shaw, who used the tips to trade stocks. This transfer of 
information represented a serious violation not only of KPMG’s policies but 
also of professional ethics rules and insider trading laws. After authorities con­
fronted him about his activities, London notified KPMG of his actions in April 
2013, resulting in his immediate termination.
Between 2010 and 2012, London discussed insider information with Shaw, 
who bought shares and options in anticipation of increased stock prices. In 
turn, Shaw paid London $50,000 cash and provided him with expensive jew­
elry, meals, and tickets to entertainment events, as well as other benefits. 
Although London’s personal gain from sharing inside information amounted to 
only about $70,000 (a small amount relative to his annual $900,000 salary), he 
facilitated the reaping of $1.27 million in illegal profits by Shaw. When asked if 
he could give an explanation for his actions, London responded, “To be honest, 
I can’t. I knew the rules and followed them for 26 years. I take full responsibility 
for what I did, but I am at a loss to say exactly why I allowed myself to break my 
moral and ethical code.”1
The insider trading began to come to light when Shaw’s abnormal trad­
ing behavior caught the attention of authorities. When confronted, he fully 
confessed and agreed to record incriminating conversations with London in 
exchange for leniency. After the sentencing, KPMG issued a statement saying 
that “it was appropriate that Scott London was held accountable today for the 
consequences of his illegal and unethical actions.” In the end, London lost his 
job, paid over $100,000 in civil penalties, and in April 2014 was sentenced to 
14 months in federal prison. In June of that same year, Shaw was sentenced to 
5 months in prison and paid back nearly $2 million in illegally gained profits 
and fines.
The judge in the London/Shaw case wrote: “As a partner at KPMG, London 
owed a fiduciary duty of trust and confidence to KPMG. As a fiduciary, he was 
obligated to keep his firm’s client information confidential and not to misappro­
priate it for his own financial or personal benefit.” Similarly, a federal court 
judge presiding over a 2004 case involving independence violations by EY 
emphasized the importance of auditor independence:2
Auditors have been characterized as “gatekeepers” to the public securities markets that are 
crucial for capital formation. The independent public accountant performing this special 
function owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation’s creditors and stockholders, as well as

to the investing public. This “public watchdog” function demands that the accountant maintain total inde-
pendence from the client at all times and requires complete fidelity to the public trust.3
In this chapter, we discuss the importance of ethical and professional conduct by audi-
tors. We begin by defining ethics and professionalism and by offering a general frame-
work within which ethical issues can be evaluated. We then provide an overview of the 
nature of the principles, rules, and regulations governing public accountants’ conduct, fol-
lowed by a discussion of the specific rules and regulations that accountants, and auditors 
in particular, must follow. We highlight independence rules, which arguably constitute the 
most complicated and controversial aspect of auditor professionalism. Finally, we discuss 
how public accounting firms are monitored and inspected to help ensure quality audits 
and compliance with professional standards, regulations, and codes of conduct. Note that 
the AICPA recently reorganized the Code of Professional Conduct; this chapter reflects 
that reorganization.

Ethics and Professional Conduct
Ethics and Professionalism Defined
Ethical conduct is the bedrock of modern civilization—it underpins the successful function-
ing of nearly every aspect of society, from daily family life to law, medicine, business, and 
government. Ethics refers to a system or code of conduct based on moral duties and obliga-
tions that indicate how an individual should interact with others in society. A sense for ethics 
guides individuals to value more than their own self-interest and to recognize and respect 
the interests of others. Our society would fall into chaos if people were devoid of ethics and 
moral sentiments. Imagine what it would be like if everyone completely ignored rules of the 
road, moral standards, obligations, and the rights and interests of others! Life in such a society 
would be, as the philosopher Hobbes said, “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”
Ethical conduct is also the bedrock of modern professionalism. Professionalism, broadly 
defined, refers to the conduct, aims, or qualities that characterize a profession or professional 
person.4 All professions establish rules or codes of conduct that define ethical behavior for 
members of the profession. These rules are established so that (1) users of the professional 
services know what to expect when they purchase such services, (2) members of the profes-
sion know what behavior is acceptable, and (3) the profession can use the rules to monitor the 
actions of its members and apply discipline where appropriate. Consider the medical profes-
sion. When you see a doctor for a potentially serious medical condition, you as a user of this 
professional service have a valid and vital interest in expecting competent and honest behavior 
that is free from conflicts of interest. You expect, for example, that the doctor will prescribe 
the best medication for your condition, rather than one for which the doctor receives a kick-
back. To better meet these expectations, the medical profession requires particular training 
and certifications, and it has a code of professional conduct, one of the earliest forms of which 
is the Hippocratic oath, written in about 400 BC. An essential distinguishing mark of a profes-
sion is that it recognizes the responsibility of its members to place the interests of the public 
above their own when the two are in conflict.
Recall that in Chapter 1 we discussed the desired characteristics of a house inspector 
and concluded that competence, objectivity, and integrity are critical. We also discussed the 
role that auditors, as “information inspectors,” play in reducing information risk through

independent verification of management assertions. To be a credible source of objective, 
independent assurance, the professional must have a solid reputation for competence and for 
unquestioned character and integrity. The concepts of ethical behavior and professional con­
duct are clearly central to the success of the accounting profession. In fact, those who enter 
the accounting profession and engage in unethical conduct will inevitably harm themselves, 
others, and the profession. The most important concept you will read in this chapter is that of 
personal responsibility and integrity. As an accountant, auditor, manager, or businessperson, 
you will face numerous difficult ethical issues, and you will experience temptations and pres­
sures to act in ways that are not aligned with ethical principles or the public interest. Never 
forget that your most valuable assets as a professional and as a person are unquestioned integ­
rity and a solid reputation. We encourage you to continually evaluate your choices and behav­
ior and commit to a high level of integrity and ethical behavior as a student, professional, and 
member of society.
Given the importance of ethical behavior, reputation, and professionalism, the accounting 
profession has developed a Code of Professional Conduct that guides the conduct of account­
ing professionals. The profession’s Code of Professional Conduct (which was recently revised 
and codified), together with related rules, interpretations, and regulations, is discussed later in 
this chapter, after we discuss a general framework for considering ethical issues.
Theories of Ethical Behavior
When individuals are confronted with situations that have moral and ethical implications, 
they do not always agree on the issues at hand, which individuals or groups will be affected, 
or what solutions or courses of action are available or appropriate for dealing with the situa­
tion. Such differences may be caused by differences in the individuals’ concepts of fairness 
and different opinions about the right action to take in a particular situation. Some ethical 
choices are difficult simply due to the temptation or pressure to pursue one’s self-interest, 
which can cloud judgment regarding what is right or wrong. Other choices are complicated 
by the sheer difficulty of sorting out the issues and deciphering what might be appropriate or 
inappropriate actions to take.
S. M. Mintz has suggested that there are three overlapping methods or theories of ethical 
behavior that can guide the analysis of ethical issues in accounting.5 These theories are (1) utili­
tarianism, (2) a rights-based approach, and (3) a justice-based approach. No single approach 
is necessarily better than another. In fact, the theories overlap with one another, and elements of 
each theory may be appropriate for resolving ethical dilemmas in different circumstances.
Utilitarian theory recognizes that decision making involves trade-offs between the ben­
efits and burdens of alternative actions, and it focuses on the consequences of a particular 
action on the individuals affected. The theory proposes that the interests of all parties affected, 
not just one’s self-interest, should be considered. From this perspective, an action conforms to 
the principle of utility only if that action will produce more pleasure or happiness (or prevent 
more pain or unhappiness) for the greatest number of people than any other possible action. 
The value of an action is determined solely by the consequences of the action on the welfare 
of individuals. This is why utilitarianism is sometimes also described as a “consequentialist” 
theory. One form of utilitarianism holds that rules have a central position in moral judgment 
due to the adverse consequences that would likely arise if everyone chose to break them. This 
approach has significance for auditors, who are expected to follow the Code of Professional 
Conduct in carrying out their responsibilities. One disadvantage in applying the utilitarian 
theory to ethical dilemmas is that it is often difficult to measure the potential costs and ben­
efits of the actions to be taken. It may also be difficult to balance the interests of all parties 
involved when those interests conflict with one another.
The rights-based approach assumes that individuals have certain rights and other indi­
viduals have a duty to respect those rights. Thus, a decision maker who follows a theory of 
LO 19-2

McGraw-Hill/Irwin, 2011), for a more detailed discussion of each of these models.

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
rights should undertake an action only if it does not violate the rights of any individual. An 
obvious disadvantage of the theory of rights is that it may be difficult or impossible to satisfy 
all rights of all affected parties, especially when those rights conflict. The theory of rights is 
important to auditors because of their public-interest responsibility. As the judge’s ruling in 
this chapter’s preface indicates, in conflicting situations, the right of the public to have objec­
tive and clear information from the auditor takes precedence over any right the auditor might 
have to enter into relationships with the audited entity that might cloud the auditor’s judg­
ment. According to the concept known as the “moral point of view,” auditors must be willing 
to see issues through others’ eyes and put the interests of other stakeholders, such as investors 
and creditors, ahead of their own self-interests and those of the CPA firm. For example, if a 
difference of opinion with top management exists over an accounting or reporting issue, the 
auditor should emphasize the interests of the investors and creditors in deciding what action to 
take, even if it means displeasing management and even losing the audit engagement.
The justice-based approach is concerned with issues such as equity, fairness, and impar­
tiality. The theory of justice involves two basic principles.6 The first principle posits that each 
person has a right to have the maximum degree of personal freedom that is still compatible 
with the liberty of others. The second principle asserts that social and economic actions 
should be to everyone’s advantage and the benefits available to all. For example, someone in 
a position to accumulate wealth has a moral obligation to make sure that others are not treated 
unfairly as a result of his or her gains. Decisions made within this theory should fairly and 
equitably distribute resources among those individuals or groups affected. There may be dif­
ficulty in trying to apply this theory in practice because the rights of one or more individuals 
or groups may be affected when a better distribution of benefits is provided to others. Under 
this approach, the auditor considers what would be the most just decision in terms of alloca­
tion of resources among interested parties.
While none of these theories by itself can provide a perfect ethical framework, note that 
each emphasizes the need to consider more than one’s self-interest, and each can be useful in 
helping an auditor to solve dilemmas by providing an ethical perspective.

Sun City Savings and Loan Company
Pina, Johnson & Associates has recently been awarded the audit of Sun City Savings and Loan Company 
for the year just ended. Sun City Savings and Loan is now the largest client of the firm, and the fees 
from this engagement represent a significant portion of the firm’s revenues. Upon accepting the Sun City 
engagement, the firm incurred additional costs by hiring several new employees and a new manager 
from a larger firm. In bidding on the engagement, Sam Johnson knew that the first-year fees would be just 
enough to cover the actual cost of the first year’s audit, but he hoped that future audit fee increases might 
lead to a long-term, profitable engagement. Based on his discussions with the predecessor auditors, 
Johnson knew that there were possible problems with Sun City’s loans because of the collateral used for 
security. Johnson was also concerned that there might be problems with loan-loss reserves due to the 
effects of the economic slowdown on the tourist industry in Sun City over the last two years. However, 
Johnson felt that these problems were manageable.
During the current year, the amount included in the loan-loss reserves account was $675,000, approx­
imately the same as the figure for the prior year. The state’s banking regulations require that an amount 
equal to 1.5 percent of the loans outstanding be included as a reserve against losses. The $675,000 was 
slightly above the statutory requirement. However, the audit staff identified two large loans, aggregating 
to $15 million, that appeared not to be collectible in full. The working papers disclosed that each loan had 
originated during the current year and that both had been in default for four months. Additionally, the 
collateral used to secure the loans was worth considerably less than the amount of the loans and was not 
in accordance with Sun City’s loan policy procedures. Based on this information, the staff estimated that

Stop and Think: What ethical and professional concerns should Johnson consider 
in deciding on a course of action? How would Johnson’s views differ if the dilemma 
were viewed with a utilitarian perspective as compared to a rights-based or a justice-
based approach?
In situations such as this one, an auditor is well advised to think about the ethical issues 
carefully and from several different perspectives. According to the utilitarian perspective, 
Johnson should consider the consequences of his actions on all affected parties and whether 
any rules exist that might require a particular action. He should think not only about the 
consequences of breaking any applicable rule in the current situation but also what the conse­
quences would be if everyone else also broke the rule. Costs and benefits need to be assessed 
in terms of the public, Sun City’s stockholders, Cabot’s reputation, and the situation of the 
public accounting firm.
Using a rights-based approach, Johnson should consider the rights of the involved par­
ties. If he does so, he will realize that the stockholders’ right to fair and accurate information 
for decision-making purposes would clearly be violated if he did not require an increase in 
the loan-loss reserves. If Cabot has entered into inappropriate loans at the expense of the 
stockholders, they will not have received accurate information about Sun City’s profitability, 
liquidity, and so on. Cabot, of course, has no defensible right to misappropriate funds or to 
report account balances incorrectly.
Finally, from a justice-based perspective, Johnson should think about whether his deci­
sion might yield advantages for some at the expense of others, focusing on the protection of 
those who may otherwise be at a disadvantage. Johnson should avoid favoring the interests 
of any individual or group and should not select an action that will confer unfair advantages 
on some (e.g., the management of the S&L) at the expense of others (e.g., the public). Integ­
rity and objectivity require that Johnson not place his self-interest or that of the entity ahead 
of the public interest. Instead, he must focus on Sun City’s shareholders as members of the 
investing public.
If he does not allow his self-interest to cloud his judgment, Johnson will require the entity 
to book the $6 million adjustment for the delinquent loans, regardless of the consequences to 
himself or to his firm. But, realistically, Johnson’s professionalism is likely to be tested in this 
situation. While he realizes that the loan-loss reserves probably should be increased, he is also 
likely to be concerned about the possibility of losing this valuable engagement and the sig­
nificant investment in new personnel that the firm has made. After all, he could easily ratio­
nalize that there is a good chance the economy will turn around and the loans will be repaid, 
as promised by Cabot. While it seems fairly clear what action should be taken, the question 
becomes—as it so often does—does the auditor have the courage to do the right thing?
Auditors frequently face ethical pressures, and the issues are often not quite as clear-cut 
as in the above example. It is important that auditors develop sound moral character and act 
with courage and integrity so that they can respond appropriately in such situations. Mintz 
about 40 percent of the $15 million, or $6 million, will not be collected. The staff has also determined that 
these loans are to entities owned by Patricia Cabot, Sun City’s CEO, and some of her business associates.
When Johnson met with Cabot to discuss the two delinquent loans, Cabot assured Johnson that the 
loans would be paid in full. She told Johnson that the loans had been properly made and that as soon as 
the economy picked up, payments would be made on the loans. She indicated that no additional reserves 
were needed and that if Johnson requires such adjustments, his firm might be replaced.
Johnson is concerned that if the loan-loss reserves are increased, Sun City Savings & Loan’s owners 
and investors might be hurt financially. Further, if Johnson requires the adjustment, Pina, Johnson & Asso­
ciates may lose Sun City as a client, his own career goals may be damaged, and the firm may have to lay 
off professional and staff employees. Johnson believes there could be serious consequences to several 
different parties whatever decision he makes.

points out that auditors who possess certain “virtues” or traits of character are more capable 
of adhering to a moral point of view.7 Examples of such virtues include honesty, integrity, 
impartiality, faithfulness, and trustworthiness. These characteristics are embodied in the pro­
fession’s Principles of Professional Conduct, discussed later in the chapter, and are vital to the 
continued health of the profession.8

In the final analysis, individual morality is the basis for effectively dealing with ethical challenges. 
Moral virtues, such as honesty and fairness, are essential characteristics for members of the account­
ing profession. Accountants who do not possess these foundational characteristics are likely to do 
great harm to themselves, the profession, and others.
An Overview of Ethics and Professionalism 
in Public Accounting
A Tale of Two Companies
A couple of true stories about two business organizations will help illustrate the importance 
of ethics and professionalism in accounting and auditing. The first Kmart store opened in 
Garden City, Michigan, in March 1962. Kmart Corp. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protec­
tion in January 2002, representing the largest retail bankruptcy ever in the United States up to 
that time. In May 2002, Kmart announced that it was restating its earnings for the first three 
quarters of the preceding fiscal year to reflect an additional $554 million in losses for a 2001 
loss of $2.4 billion. In January 2003, Kmart fired the last of 25 executives who had pocketed 
a total of $28 million in loans that were forgiven before the company filed for bankruptcy. 
A month later, two former Kmart vice presidents, Enio Montini, Jr., and Joseph Hofmeister, 
were indicted for alleged crimes involving Kmart’s accounting. In May 2003, Kmart emerged 
from bankruptcy and continued to operate independently for several years. The company now 
operates more than 1,000 stores as a wholly owned subsidiary of Sears Holding Company.
Arthur Andersen, originally founded in 1913 as Andersen, Delaney & Co., grew to 
become one of the five largest and most respected accounting firms in the world by the late 
1990s, with about 85,000 employees. In fall 2001, it became clear that issues were arising in 
connection with the firm’s audits of Enron Corp., and Andersen’s Houston office undertook 
a massive shredding operation to destroy Enron-related documents in October and November 
2001. The U.S. Justice Department indicted the firm in March 2002 on obstruction of justice 
charges related to the shredding. Despite the fact that the Enron scandal was primarily cen­
tered in Texas, Andersen began to unravel quickly across the country, losing over 400 of its 
publicly traded entities from all over the country by June 2002. The firm was convicted on a 
single count of obstruction of justice in June 2002, and the firm ceased to audit publicly held 
companies shortly thereafter. Ironically, the obstruction of justice charge was overturned by 
the U.S. Supreme Court in 2005, but this was a hollow victory for Andersen, as all of the 
firm’s clients and audit staff had fled by that time to other firms and in all practical respects 
Andersen ceased to exist.
Stop and Think: Why was financially feeble Kmart able to continue its operations 
despite questionable accounting practices and federal indictments, while Arthur 
Andersen was not able to survive even though it was financially strong?

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
635
Kmart had physical assets and traded in physical goods, while Andersen’s primary asset 
was its reputation for competence, professionalism, and integrity. That reputation was dam­
aged prior to the Enron scandal by a string of questionable practices and audit failures (involv­
ing Sunbeam, Waste Management, the Baptist Foundation of Arizona, and others) and was 
finished off by the Enron scandal and the firm’s subsequent indictment. The sudden death of 
one of the largest and formerly most respected public accounting firms was a serious wake-up 
call for the profession, and the collapse underscored the vital importance of ethical conduct 
and professionalism on the part of auditors.
Standards for Auditor Professionalism
This section provides an overview of the principles, rules, and regulations governing ethics 
and professionalism in public accounting. The topic is complicated by the fact that these rules 
and regulations were established over time by different professional and regulatory bodies and 
in some cases by legislation. Early in the history of the public accounting profession in the 
United States, nongovernmental associations took charge of setting standards and establishing 
codes of conduct for practicing accountants. In particular, the AICPA (and its predecessor, 
the American Association of Public Accountants) established auditing standards and a Code 
of Professional Conduct, mapping out the primary areas in which ethical conduct is expected 
of public accountants. The AICPA, being a private, nongovernmental association, has the 
authority only to require its members to comply with the Code as a condition of continued 
membership. However, state and federal courts have consistently held that all practicing 
CPAs, whether in public or private practice and whether or not a member of the AICPA, must 
follow professional ethical standards as laid out in the Code of Professional Conduct. Further, 
most state boards of accountancy have adopted the Code, thus integrating it into state-level 
regulation of the practice of accountancy.

INSIGHT
It is important to understand that the U.S. capital markets system is based on public confidence. Pub­
lic accountants play a central role in the public’s ability to place confidence in companies’ financial 
reports, and thus greatly influence how efficiently and effectively our capital markets work. Integrity 
and independence in fact and in appearance are cornerstones of the auditor’s social responsibility 
and are critical to public confidence and to the proper functioning of our economic system.
The SEC has legal authority to oversee the public accounting profession. Through much 
of its history, the SEC has allowed private-sector entities such as the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board and the Auditing Standards Board (or ASB, a standing senior technical com­
mittee within the AICPA) to set accounting and auditing standards, respectively. However, the 
SEC exercises considerable influence in the standard-setting process and has established stan­
dards of its own from time to time, some of which differ from those established by private-
sector bodies.
The PCAOB, upon taking authority for establishing auditing standards for public com­
pany audits, adopted in 2003 (on an interim basis) the professional standards established by 
the AICPA, including the AICPA’s Code of Professional Conduct. However, the PCAOB 
and the SEC have additional, more stringent standards of professional conduct, mostly in the 
key area of auditor independence, which must be followed by auditors of public companies. 
Because the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct provides the broadest map of the areas in 
which professionalism is expected from auditors, the newly revised Code serves as the orga­
nizing framework for the discussion of auditor ethical and professional responsibilities in this 
chapter. However, we also highlight the more stringent independence requirements the SEC 
and PCAOB impose on public company auditors.
Figure 19–1 summarizes the auditor’s responsibilities with respect to auditing standards 
and standards of professional conduct for the audits of private and public companies. As the 
figure illustrates, in auditing a privately held entity a CPA must follow the auditing standards 
established by the ASB, as well as the independence and other standards of professional

conduct established by the Code of Professional Conduct. In addition, the three standards and 
the three interpretations issued by the Independence Standards Board (ISB) during its short 
existence from 1997 to 2001 generally must be followed.9
In auditing a publicly held company, a CPA must follow the auditing standards of the 
PCAOB, the Code of Professional Conduct, and also the more stringent independence require­
ments established by the SEC, ISB, and PCAOB.
9The committee within the AICPA that is charged with setting, deleting, or modifying rules and interpretations  
and delivering ethics rulings in response to specific questions is known as the Professional Ethics Executive Com-
mittee (PEEC).

The Newly Revised AICPA Code of Professional 
Conduct: A Comprehensive Framework for Auditors
The newly reorganized AICPA Code of Professional Conduct is organized into a preface that 
is applicable to all CPAs, and three “Parts.” Part 1 applies to CPAs in public practice; in other 
words, CPAs who provide assurance and conduct financial statement audits and issue reports 
stemming from those services on which the public will rely. This includes auditors practicing 
LO 19-4

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
637
in public accounting firms and government auditors who issue audit and other assurance 
reports on government entities. Part 1 requires the CPA to be independent of the entities on 
which she or he is providing assurance. Part 2 applies to CPAs who are working in business 
but who are not working as auditors that issue assurance reports on which the public will rely. 
Part 2 of the Code does not require independence but does require integrity and objectivity on 
the part of CPAs working in any business capacity. For example, if a CPA works for a com­
pany as a controller or CFO but not as an auditor, Part 2 of the Code of Professional Conduct 
applies but Part 1 does not. If a CPA works both as an auditor and in another business capac­
ity, both Part 1 and Part 2 apply to her or his conduct. Part 3 of the Code applies to CPAs 
who are neither functioning as an auditor nor in business. Even in such cases the profession 
expects that CPAs will behave in certain ways; for example, that the CPA will not engage in 
any act that would be discreditable to the profession. Note, therefore, that if your instructor 
is a CPA, the profession expects certain behavior of him or her even in the capacity of an 
accounting or auditing instructor!
The Preface of the Code of Professional Conduct, which applies to all CPAs, defines 
ideal Principles of Professional Conduct that are expected of all CPAs. The separate “Parts” 
of the Code then set out specific, mandatory Rules of Conduct describing minimum levels of 
conduct a CPA must maintain, depending on whether the CPA is in public practice (Part 1), 
working in some business capacity (Part 2), or other capacity (Part 3).
The Principles of Professional Conduct provide the framework for the Rules of Conduct 
within each part of the Code (Parts 1–3). Additional guidance for applying the Rules of Con­
duct is provided by Interpretations of Rules of Conduct by the AICPA Professional Ethics 
Executive Committee (PEEC). (The prior version of the Code also included “rulings” on indi­
vidual questions submitted to the PEEC, listed in question and answer format. These rulings 
have been redrafted and codified as Interpretations of Rules of Conduct in the newly revised 
Code of Professional Conduct.)
The Interpretations of Rules of Conduct are promulgated by the AICPA’s PEEC to pro­
vide guidelines as to the scope and application of the Rules of Conduct. Unlike the Rules of 
Conduct, interpretations are not specifically enforceable, but an auditor who departs from 
them has the burden of justifying such departures.
The guidance provided by the Code of Professional Conduct starts at a conceptual level 
with the principles and progressively moves to general rules and then to detailed interpreta­
tions. Figure 19–2 illustrates how the principles, rules, and interpretations of the Code of 
Professional Conduct fit in the context of the Code.

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Principles of Professional Conduct
The framework for the Code of Professional Conduct is provided by six fundamental ethical 
principles in the Preface to the Code. The preamble to the Principles of Professional Conduct 
states the following:
They [the principles] guide members in the performance of their professional responsibilities and 
express the basic tenets of ethical and professional conduct. The principles call for an unswerv­
ing commitment to honorable behavior, even at the sacrifice of personal advantage. (Code 
Section 0.300.010.02)
Table 19–1 presents the definition of each of the six principles. Please take a moment to 
read these vital precepts—they represent the ideals of the profession you are preparing to enter!
Stop and Think: Why do you think the profession has adopted these high ideals for 
accountants and auditors?
The first two principles address a CPA’s responsibilities to exercise professional and 
moral judgment in a manner that serves the public interest. These principles reinforce the 
conviction that a CPA’s role in society is to serve the public.
As indicated by the third and fourth principles, the public relies on a CPA’s integrity, 
objectivity, and independence in providing high-quality services. Integrity requires that a 
CPA be honest and candid and honor both the form and the spirit of ethical standards. 
Thus, a CPA should make judgments that are consistent with the theories of rights and 
justice. When faced with an ethical challenge, the CPA should ask, “What actions would an 
individual with integrity take, given these facts and circumstances?” Objectivity and inde­
pendence are hallmarks of the public accounting profession. The principle of objectivity 
requires the CPA to be impartial and free of conflicts of interest. Independence requires that 
the CPA avoid relationships that would impair his or her objectivity. When a CPA provides 
auditing- or attestation-related services, independence in both fact and appearance must 
be maintained.
The fifth principle, due care, requires that the CPA perform his or her professional 
responsibilities with competence and diligence. While the performance of professional ser­
vices must take into account the interests of the entity, the public’s interest must be con­
sidered more important when the two interests conflict. The last principle requires that the 
CPA determine that the services to be rendered are consistent with acceptable professional 
behavior for CPAs. This principle also requires that the CPA’s firm maintain internal quality 
control activities to ensure that services are delivered competently and that no conflict of 
interest exists.
LO 19-4
Principles of Professional Conduct
Responsibilities: In carrying out their responsibilities as professionals, members should exercise sensitive professional 
and moral judgments in all their activities.
The public interest: Members should accept the obligation to act in a way that will serve the public interest, honor the 
public trust, and demonstrate a commitment to professionalism.
Integrity: To maintain and broaden public confidence, members should perform all professional responsibilities with 
the highest sense of integrity.
Objectivity and independence: A member should maintain objectivity and be free of conflicts of interest in discharg­
ing professional responsibilities. A member in public practice should be independent in fact and appearance when 
providing auditing and other attestation services.
Due care: A member should observe the profession’s technical and ethical standards, strive continually to improve 
competence and the quality of services, and discharge professional responsibility to the best of the member’s 
ability.
Scope and nature of services: A member in public practice should observe the Principles of the Code of Professional 
Conduct in determining the scope and nature of services to be provided.

Rules of Conduct
The bylaws of the AICPA specifically require that members adhere to the Rules of Conduct 
of the Code of Professional Conduct. The PCAOB also requires auditors of public companies 
to adhere to the Rules of Conduct. Table 19–2 provides an overview of the existing Rules of 
Conduct. Take a few minutes to read through these rules. As you can see, the Rules of Con­
duct cover much of the same ground as the Principles of Professional Conduct but are some­
what more specific. The rules are grouped and numbered differently, depending on which 
Part of the Code applies to the CPA. Because this book is primarily about financial statement 
auditing, this chapter focuses on Part 1 of the Code. Part 1 has the most stringent requirements 
of the three Parts because it applies to CPAs who provide assurance to the broader public, 
which in turn relies on the work of those CPAs in making financial and investing decisions.
Much of the original text of the rules in Part 1 of the Code of Professional Conduct is 
included in Table 19–2. The “nitty-gritty” details in implementing the rules are found in the 
interpretations of each rule. For example, while the rule relating to independence is comprised 
of only one brief sentence, the in-force interpretations of the Independence Rule comprise 
many pages of detail relating to financial or business interests that are, or are not, considered

to compromise independence. Interpretations of the other rules tend to be significantly shorter 
and less involved than those relating to independence. This is because independence has 
become the most complex and controversial area of auditor ethics and professionalism—not 
only has the AICPA established multiple pages of rules and interpretations regarding indepen­
dence, but the SEC and the now defunct ISB also weighed in heavily on the independence 
issue.10 Differences between AICPA independence standards and the SEC independence regu­
lations, which apply only to the audits of public companies, are discussed in the context of the 
AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, which we’ll now explore in more depth.
10The ISB was created in 1997 as a joint effort of the AICPA and the SEC to address important issues relating to 
audits of public companies. The board was housed within the SEC Practice Section of the AICPA. In 2000 the SEC 
issued its own comprehensive rules on auditor independence for the audits of public companies, and the ISB was dis-
banded in July 2001, when the SEC concluded that “the board’s mission had been substantially fulfilled.” During its 
brief tenure, the ISB issued three standards and three interpretations. Although the ISB is now defunct, its standards 
are recognized by the SEC and the AICPA, and they currently remain in effect for public company audits. However, 
the most important aspects of the ISB’s standards have been incorporated into the SEC’s independence rules and the 
Code of Professional Conduct and are therefore not discussed separately in this chapter.
Integrity, Objectivity, and Independence
Integrity and Objectivity—Framework, Rule, and Interpretations
The first section in Part 1 of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct, Section 1.100, con­
tains the Code’s Integrity and Objectivity Rule. This is no accident—integrity and objectivity 
are the bedrock of the profession of public accountancy.  They are essential to the value that 
CPAs can provide as providers of assurance and as auditors of financial statements that are 
used by the general public in making financial and investment decisions. 
Integrity and Objectivity Rule (1.100.001): In the performance of any professional service, a 
member shall maintain objectivity and integrity, shall be free of conflicts of interest, and shall not 
knowingly misrepresent facts or subordinate his or her judgment to others.
The Integrity and Objectivity Rule expands slightly on the principle from which it was 
developed and requires that a member maintain integrity and objectivity. Before we address 
specific interpretations of this rule, it is important to note that the Code of Professional Con­
duct recognizes that there may be situations where the CPA’s integrity and objectivity are 
threatened in ways that are not specifically addressed in the Code. When no interpretation 
exists to address a particular relationship or circumstance, the CPA should evaluate whether 
that relationship or circumstance would lead a reasonable and informed third party to conclude 
that there is a threat to the member’s compliance with the rules that is not at an acceptable 
level. In such cases the CPA would apply the Code’s “Integrity and Objectivity Framework,” 
identifying threats to integrity and objectivity, evaluating the significance of those threats, 
and then applying appropriate safeguards to bring the threat to an acceptable level. Obviously, 
the professional must apply considerable professional judgment in such situations.
Threats to a CPA’s integrity and objectivity can take several forms, with many falling 
into one or more of the following seven categories: adverse interest threats, where the CPA’s 
interest runs contrary to those of the client; self-interest threats, where a CPA may be forced 
to choose between actions that further her or his own interests and actions that serve the 
investing public’s interests; advocacy threats, where a CPA might feel inclined to advocate 
for the client’s preferred outcomes; familiarity threats, where a CPA might have such a close, 
long-standing relationship with a client that it becomes difficult to maintain objectivity; man­
agement participation threats, where a CPA who becomes involved in management decisions 
is unable to be completely objective; self-review threats, where a CPA is in a position that 
involves evaluating his or her own judgments; and finally, undue influence threats, when a 
CPA’s integrity or objectivity is pressured due to another involved party’s aggressiveness or 
dominant personality. (See Code of Conduct 1.210.010.)
Safeguards to identified threats to a CPA’s integrity and objectivity will be highly 
dependent on the specific circumstances but should be adequate to bring the threat to the 
LO 19-5

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
641
professional’s integrity and objectivity to an acceptable level, based on professional judg­
ment. Examples of safeguards might include additional training, involvement of an other­
wise uninvolved third party, and the availability of hotlines and direct consultation on ethical 
and other matters.
As you can see, the Code of Professional Conduct places the responsibility for ethical 
behavior squarely on the professional, regardless of whether there are specific interpretations 
in place to address the myriad situations that might arise to challenge or threaten the CPA’s 
integrity or objectivity. That said, there are a number of important interpretations of this rule. 
For example, Interpretation 1.110 states that a conflict of interest may occur if a CPA per­
forms a professional service for an entity or employer and the CPA or the CPA’s firm has a 
relationship with another person, entity, product, or service that could be viewed as impair­
ing the CPA’s objectivity. For example, a CPA might be hired to provide recommendations 
to an entity on which commercially available software package the entity should select for 
managing inventory. A conflict of interest would exist if the CPA had a substantial business 
or financial interest in one of the potential software providers. Interpretation 1.130 indicates 
that a member who knowingly makes, permits or directs another to make, materially false 
and misleading entries in an entity’s financial statements or records violates the Integrity and 
Objectivity Rule. 
Two other interpretations relate mainly to members employed in industry but have a bear­
ing on the work of auditors. Interpretation 2.130.010 states that, in dealing with his or her 
employer’s external accountants, a member must be candid and not knowingly misrepresent 
facts or knowingly fail to disclose material facts. Interpretation 2.130.020 indicates that, if a 
CPA working in industry (e.g., as an accountant in a company) has a disagreement or dispute 
with his or her supervisor relating to the preparation of financial statements or the recording 
of transactions, the member must take steps to ensure that the situation does not result in a 
subordination of judgment. If the member concludes that the financial statements or records 
could be materially misstated, he or she should communicate those concerns to a higher level 
of management within the organization. If appropriate action is not taken, the member should 
consider whether to continue the relationship with the employer. The member should also 
consider whether any responsibility exists to communicate the problem to third parties, such 
as regulatory agencies or the employer’s external accountants.
You might be interested to know that educational services are considered by the Code to 
be professional services and therefore are subject to the Integrity and Objectivity Rule (Inter­
pretation 2.160.010). Thus, a CPA who is an accounting instructor must maintain objectivity 
and integrity when performing such services according to the Code. A complete coverage 
of the Code of Professional Conduct in this chapter isn’t practical, so be aware that there are 
other important interpretations in the Code relating to Integrity and Objectivity that we don’t 
discuss here, such as those relating to “Offering or Accepting Gifts or Entertainment,” and 
“Use of a Third-Party Service Provider.”
Independence
The second section in Part 1 of the Code, Section 1.200, relates to the independence of assur­
ance providers. Independence, both in fact and in appearance, is very important to the assur­
ance that CPAs provide: if the auditor is not perceived to be independent of the audited entity, 
it is unlikely that a user of financial statements will place much reliance on the CPA’s work. 
In addition to the Code of Professional Conduct, SEC and PCAOB rules and standards relat­
ing to auditor independence are discussed in this section to the extent that they add to the 
AICPA’s requirements. While we cover minimum guidelines required by the profession, it is 
important to note that firms often require their employees to comply with rules and guidelines 
that are even stricter than those imposed on them by outside bodies. 
The Code’s Independence Rule is a very general statement concerning auditor indepen­
dence and relates only to attestation-related services, including audits.
Independence Rule (1.200.001): A member in public practice shall be independent in the per­
formance of professional services as required by standards promulgated by bodies designated 
by Council.

642	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
AICPA professional standards require a public accounting firm, including the firm’s 
partners and professional employees, to be independent in accordance with the Code’s Inde­
pendence Rule whenever the firm performs an attest service for an entity. Attest services 
include the following:
	
∙	 Financial statement audits
	
∙	 Financial statement reviews (see Chapter 21)
	
∙	 Other attest services as defined in the Statements on Standards for Attestation 
Engagements (SSAEs)
Performing a compilation of an entity’s financial statements (see Chapter 21) does not 
require independence, but an accountant or a firm that lacks independence must explicitly 
indicate this fact in the compilation report. Likewise, independence is not required to perform 
other nonattest services (e.g., tax preparation, financial planning, or consulting services) if 
those services are the only services provided to a particular entity. 
Because of the difficulties that sometimes arise in defining independent relationships in 
providing attest services, numerous interpretations of the Independence Rule have been issued. 
However, as with the Integrity and Objectivity Rule, the Code of Professional Conduct offers 
a conceptual framework for evaluating and safeguarding against threats to independence that 
might not be specifically addressed by the Code’s independence interpretations. The frame­
work is very similar to that introduced earlier in the chapter in conjunction with Integrity and 
Objectivity—threats to the appearance of independence are identified, the significance of the 
threats is evaluated, and safeguards are implemented to bring the threats to an acceptable level, 
as defined by the likely judgment of a reasonable, informed third party. The Code specifies 
that for certain threats, either no safeguards can eliminate or reduce the threat to an accept­
able level, or a member must apply specific safeguards to eliminate or reduce an independence 
threat to an acceptable level.  The same seven categories of threats are used in the Independence 
Framework as in the Integrity and Objectivity Framework—adverse interest, advocacy, famil­
iarity, management participation, self-interest, self-review, and undue influence. Under this 
conceptual framework approach, a CPA is required to identify and assess the extent to which a 
threat to independence exists. If such a threat does exist, the CPA considers whether the threat 
might reasonably be considered to compromise the member’s professional judgment. If so, the 
CPA evaluates whether the threat can be effectively mitigated or eliminated using various safe­
guards. Depending on the evaluation, the CPA implements safeguards to eliminate or reduce 
the threats to an acceptable level or concludes that independence is impaired. However, keep in 
mind that the risk-based conceptual framework for considering independence threats cannot be 
used to justify departures from specific independence interpretations!
Table 19–3 presents several of the most important interpretations of the Independence 
Rule. In reading these interpretations, it is important to consider the definition of a “covered 
member,” or in other words, those who are bound by the independence requirements. The 
AICPA uses an engagement team approach to determine independence (see Code Section 
0.400.012). Under this approach, a covered member includes the following:
	
∙	 An individual on the attest engagement team
	
∙	 An individual in a position to influence the attest engagement
	
∙	 A partner, partner equivalent, or manager who provides more than 10 hours of 
nonattest services to the attest client within any fiscal year. Designation as a covered 
member ends on the later of (i) the date that the firm signs the report on the financial 
statements for the fiscal year during which those services were provided or (ii) the 
date he or she no longer expects to provide 10 or more hours of nonattest services to 
the attest client on a recurring basis
	
∙	 A partner or partner equivalent in the office in which the lead attest engagement partner 
or partner equivalent primarily practices in connection with the attest engagement
	
∙	 The firm, including the firm’s employee benefits plans
	
∙	 An entity whose operating, financial, or accounting policies can be controlled by any 
of the individuals or entities described above or by two or more such individuals or 
entities if they act together

Some Key Interpretations of Independence Rule (Code Section 1.200)*
1.230—Unpaid Fees:
Threats to the covered member’s compliance with the “Independence Rule” [1.200.001] would not be at an acceptable level and could not be reduced to 
an acceptable level by the application of safeguards if a covered member has unpaid fees from an attest client for any previously rendered professional 
service provided more than one year prior to the date of the current-year report. Accordingly, independence would be impaired. Unpaid fees include fees 
that are unbilled or a note receivable arising from such fees.
1.240—Financial Interests:
Direct Financial Interests: If a covered member had or was committed to acquire any direct financial interest in an attest client during the period of the 
professional engagement, the self-interest threat to the covered member’s compliance with the “Independence Rule” would not be at an acceptable level 
and could not be reduced to an acceptable level by the application of safeguards. Accordingly, independence would be impaired.
Material Indirect Financial Interests: If a covered member had or was committed to acquire any material indirect financial interest in an attest client 
during the period of the professional engagement, the self-interest threat to the covered member’s compliance with the “Independence Rule” would not 
be at an acceptable level and could not be reduced to an acceptable level by the application of safeguards. Accordingly, independence would be impaired.
Ownership Interests: If a partner or professional employee of the firm, his or her immediate family, or any group of such persons acting together 
owned more than 5 percent of an attest client’s outstanding equity securities or other ownership interests during the period of the professional engage­
ment, the self-interest threat to compliance with the “Independence Rule” would not be at an acceptable level and could not be reduced to an acceptable 
level by the application of safeguards. Accordingly, independence would be impaired.
1.250—Participation in Employee Benefit Plans:
When a covered member participates in an employee benefit plan that is an attest client or is sponsored by an attest client, during the period of the profes­
sional engagement or during the period covered by the financial statements, the self-interest threat to compliance with the “Independence Rule” would not 
be at an acceptable level. Independence with respect to the employee benefit plan and the sponsor would be impaired except in . . . specific situations.
1.260—Loans, Leases, and Guarantees:
If a covered member has a loan to or from an attest client, any officer or director of the attest client, or any individual owning 10 percent or more of the 
attest client’s outstanding equity securities or other ownership interests, a self-interest threat to the covered member’s compliance with the “Indepen­
dence Rule” may exist. Threats would not be at an acceptable level and independence would be impaired if the loan exists during the period of the profes­
sional engagement, except as provided for in the “Loans and Leases With Lending Institutions” interpretation [1.260.020] of the “Independence Rule.”
1.270—Immediate Family and Close Relative Relationships With Attest Clients:
Immediate Family Relationships: A covered member’s immediate family is subject to the “Independence Rule” and its interpretations. However, the 
following exceptions address some of the situations in which independence will not be considered impaired:
 • An individual in a covered member’s immediate family may be employed by an attest client in a position other than a key position.
 • In certain situations, an immediate family member of a covered member may participate in a benefit plan that is an attest client or that is sponsored by 
an attest client, subject to certain restrictive conditions detailed in the independence interpretations.
 • In certain situations, an immediate family member may hold a direct or material indirect financial interest in an attest client through participation in a 
benefit plan, subject to certain restrictive conditions detailed in the interpretations.
 • In certain situations, an immediate family member of a covered member may participate in a share-based compensation arrangement that results in his 
or her holding a beneficial financial interest in an attest client, subject to certain restrictive conditions detailed in the interpretation.
 • In certain situations, as a result of his or her permitted employment at an attest client, an immediate family member of a covered member may partici­
pate in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan sponsored by the attest client, subject to certain restrictive conditions detailed in the interpretation.
When materiality of a financial interestis identified as a factor affecting independence in these interpretations and rulings, the immediate family mem­
ber and the covered member’s interests should be combined.
Close Relative Relationships: Independence would be considered to be impaired if an individual participating on the attest engagement team or an 
individual in a position to influence the attest engagement or any partner in the office in which the lead attest engagement partner primarily practices in 
connection with the attest engagement has a close relative who had
	a.	A key position with the client, or
	b.	A financial interest in the client that
		 (i)  Was material to the close relative and of which the individual or partner has knowledge; or
		 (ii)  Enabled the close relative to exercise significant influence over the client.
1.275—Current Employment or Association With an Attest Client:
If a partner or professional employee of the member’s firm is simultaneously employed or associated with an attest client as a director, an officer, an 
employee, a promoter, an underwriter, a voting trustee, a trustee for any pension or profit-sharing trust of the attest client, or in any capacity equivalent to that 
of a member of management of an attest client during the period covered by the financial statements or the period of the professional engagement . . . 
familiarity, management participation, advocacy, or self-review threats to the member’s compliance with the “Independence Rule” would not be at an accept­
able level and could notbe reduced to an acceptable level by the application of safeguards. Accordingly, independence would beimpaired.
1.277—Former Employment or Association With an Attest Client:
When a member becomes a partner or professional employee of a firm that provides attest services to an entity where the member was formerly 
employed or otherwise associated, familiarity, self-interest, self-review, or management participation threats to the member’s compliance with the “Inde­
pendence Rule” may exist. A firm’s independence would be impaired if a covered member who was formerly (a) employed by a client or (b) associated 
with a client as a(n) officer,director, promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, or trustee for a pension or profit-sharing trust of the client either
	1.	 Participates on the attest engagement team or is an individual in a position to influence the attest engagement for the client when the attest engage­
mentcovers any period that includes his or her former employment or association with that client, or
	2.	Fails to disassociate himself or herself from the client prior to becoming a covered member.
Disassociation from the client includes the following (with certain exceptions and conditions):
		 a.  Ceasing to participate in all employee health and welfare plans sponsored by the client. . .
		 b.  Ceasing to participate in all other employee benefit plans. . .
		 c.  Disposing of any direct or material indirect financial interests in the client.
		 d.  Collecting or repaying any loans to or from the client, except for loans specifically permitted or grandfathered under the interpretations detailed in 1.260.
		 e.  Assessing other relationships with the client to determine if such relationships create threats to independence that would require the application of 
safeguards to reduce the threats to an acceptable level.

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Note that the independence rules apply to more than just the partner on the attest engage­
ment. Every individual on the engagement team and others who may be in a position to influ­
ence the engagement must be independent with respect to the attest entity. Other partners or 
managers of the CPA firm who are not on the attest engagement team must also generally 
be independent of the entity if they provide nonattest services to that entity (such as tax or 
consulting services), or even if a partner simply works in the same office as the attest engage­
ment’s lead partner. Under the engagement team approach, a staff member of the CPA firm 
does not need to be independent of the attest entity unless he or she performs work directly 
for the entity or becomes a partner in the same office where the attest engagement’s lead 
partner works.
The CPA firm itself must also be independent with respect to the entity; for example, the 
CPA firm’s benefit plan cannot invest in the firm’s attest entities. Note that with few excep­
tions, the Code’s independence requirements extend to the CPA’s immediate family members 
(spouse, spousal equivalent, or dependents) and, in a few cases, to the CPA’s close relatives 
(nondependent children, siblings, parents, etc.). The applicability of the independence require­
ments to family members and relatives is discussed later in this section.
While CPA firms are required to comply with the Independence Rule and its interpreta­
tions, most major CPA firms have their own firm-specific independence rules that are typi­
cally more stringent than the AICPA’s standards. In addition, firms are required by AICPA 
and PCAOB standards to establish and maintain a system of quality control, a significant 
aspect of which is to ensure the firms’ compliance with independence standards. Quality 
control requirements, the AICPA’s peer review program, and the PCAOB’s auditor inspection 
program are discussed later in this chapter.
Note that interpretations of the Independence Rule can generally be classified along two 
dimensions—financial relationships and business relationships—and explicitly considers the 
effects of family relationships on independence. A number of other interpretations of the 
Independence Rule provide further explanations on such relationships.
Practice 
INSIGHT
During the audit of a public company, a senior auditor at one of the Big 4 accounting firms purchased 
$5,000 of the company’s stock. The auditor was sanctioned by the PCAOB, fired by the firm, and 
banned from association with a registered public accounting firm for one year (PCAOB Release 
105-2007-003).
Financial Relationships  Interpretations found in Code Section 1.240 prohibit members 
from any financial relationship with an audited entity that may impair or give the appearance 
of impairing independence. This includes any direct or material indirect financial interest in 
the entity. Note that the materiality of the interest is only considered if the interest is indirect. 
While materiality comes into play for indirect financial interests, any direct financial interest 
impairs independence even if it is so small as to be considered immaterial.
Code Section 0.400 and Interpretation 1.240.010 define financial interests, direct finan­
cial interests, and indirect financial interests and provides guidance to members in determin­
ing whether financial interests should be considered direct or indirect financial interests. A 
financial interest is an ownership interest in an equity or a debt security issued by an entity, 
including rights and obligations to acquire such an interest.
A direct financial interest is a financial interest that is owned directly by an individual or 
entity, or is under the control of an individual or entity. A financial interest that is beneficially 
owned through an intermediary (e.g., an estate or trust) is also considered a direct financial 
interest when the beneficiary either controls the intermediary or has the authority to supervise 
or participate in the intermediary’s investment decisions. A financial interest is beneficially 
owned when an individual or entity is not the recorded owner of the interest but has a right to 
some or all of the underlying benefits of ownership. With few exceptions (see below), direct 
financial interests by CPAs in attest entities impair independence.

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
645
An indirect financial interest arises when (a) an auditor or other covered member has a 
financial interest in an entity that is associated with an attest entity; (b) the financial interest 
is beneficially owned through an investment vehicle, estate, trust, or other intermediary; and 
(c) the auditor does not control the intermediary or have authority to supervise or participate 
in the intermediary’s investment decisions.
Indirect financial interests are generally permissible only if the amount involved is imma­
terial with respect to the covered member’s income and wealth. For example, the ownership 
of shares in a mutual fund is considered to be a direct financial interest in the mutual fund. 
The securities that the mutual fund invests in are considered indirect financial interests to the 
covered member. Interpretation 1.240.030 indicates that if the mutual fund is diversified, and 
if the covered member owns 5 percent or less of the outstanding shares of the mutual fund, the 
investment would not be considered to constitute a material indirect financial interest in the 
underlying investments. However, if a covered member owns more than 5 percent of the out­
standing shares of a diversified mutual fund, or if the mutual fund is not diversified, the cov­
ered member needs to evaluate the underlying investments of the mutual fund to determine 
whether the investment in the mutual fund constitutes a material indirect financial interest in 
any of the mutual fund’s underlying investments.
Interpretation 1.240.030 offers the following example relating to investments in mutual 
funds. Assume that a nondiversified mutual fund owns shares in attest entity, Company A. 
Further assume that the mutual fund’s net assets are $10,000,000; the covered member owns 
1 percent of the outstanding shares of the mutual fund, having a value of $100,000; and the 
mutual fund has 10 percent of its assets invested in Company A. The indirect financial interest 
of the covered member in Company A is $10,000. This amount should be measured against 
the covered member’s net worth (including the net worth of his or her immediate family) to 
determine if it is material.
You may have heard that in some circumstances, individuals can place their assets into a 
“blind trust” to avoid possible conflicts of interest. A blind trust is a trust in which the owner 
of the trust assets does not supervise or participate in the trust’s investment decisions during 
the term of the trust. Interpretation 1.245.020 addresses the question of whether CPAs can 
avoid impairing their independence by placing financial interests in an audited entity in a 
blind trust. Because the investments generally ultimately revert to the owner and the owner 
usually retains the right to amend or revoke the trust, both the blind trust and the underlying 
investments are considered to be direct financial interests of the covered member.
Interpretations in Code Sections 1.250, 1.255, 1.257, and 1.260 clarify other circum­
stances, such as ownership in retirement plans, partnerships, LLCs, and insurance policies 
of various types. For example, if a CPA owns an insurance policy issued by an attest entity, 
independence is not considered to be impaired so long as the policy was purchased under the 
insurance company’s normal terms and procedures and does not offer an investment option. 
Some insurance policies allow the policy owner to invest part of the cash value in a variety 
of underlying investments (stocks, bond, etc.). These underlying investments are considered 
to be a financial interest. Thus, in such circumstances the CPA must determine whether the 
underlying investments are direct or indirect financial interests.
Generally a loan to or from an audited entity is considered to impair the member’s inde­
pendence (Exhibit 19–1). However, there are situations in which a CPA is permitted to obtain 
loans from a financial institution for which he or she provides audits. Interpretation 1.260.020 
permits the following types of personal loans from an audited entity that operates as a finan­
cial institution:
	
∙	 Automobile loans and leases collateralized by the automobile
	
∙	 Loans fully collateralized by the cash surrender value of an insurance policy
	
∙	 Loans fully collateralized by cash deposits at the same lending institution
	
∙	 Credit cards and cash advances where the aggregate outstanding balance is reduced to 
$10,000 or less by the payment due date

646	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Such loans must be made in accordance with the financial institution’s normal lending 
procedures, terms, and requirements and must, at all times, be kept current as to all terms. 
Normal lending procedures, terms, and requirements are defined as lending procedures, 
terms, and requirements that are reasonably comparable to those relating to loans of a similar 
character given to other borrowers during the period in which the loan to the member is given.
Stop and Think: Could unpaid fees be considered an outstanding debt by the entity to 
the auditor—a direct financial interest on the part of the auditor?
The interpretations in Code Section 1.230 specify that if fees pertaining to services pro­
vided more than one year prior to the date of the audit report remain unpaid, the auditor’s 
independence is impaired with respect to that entity. However, unpaid fees from an audited 
entity that is in bankruptcy do not impair the auditor’s independence.
Let’s test your intuition. Think about the following situations to determine if the financial 
interest represented is a direct financial interest, an indirect financial interest, or neither. Also 
decide whether the financial interest would impair the auditor’s independence. (1) The auditor 
owns a $1,000 investment in a mutual fund that spreads its holdings evenly across companies 
listed in the S&P 500. One of the auditor’s audit entities is an S&P 500 company. (2) The 
managing audit partner of the office owns stock in one of the office’s audited entities, but the 
amount is immaterial and the managing partner is not involved in the audit.
The first situation represents an indirect financial interest in the audited entity. The rela­
tionship would not impair independence because the auditor owns very little of the fund and 
the fund is diversified over a large number of companies. The second scenario represents a 
direct financial interest by a covered member. Independence is considered impaired despite 
the fact that the amount of stock owned is immaterial.
Business Relationships  Interpretations found in Code Section 1.275 essentially indicate 
that the independence of a CPA is impaired if the CPA performs a managerial or other signifi­
cant role for an entity’s organization during the time period covered by an attest engagement. 
Such situations often arise when a former employee of the entity becomes employed by the 
CPA firm or, more commonly, when a CPA takes a job with a former audit entity. Interpreta­
tions of this rule, however, provide for certain exceptions.
For example, a former employee of an attest entity cannot become a member of the attest 
engagement team or be placed in a position to influence the engagement for that entity unless 
ESM Government Securities, Inc., Audit Partner Had “Loan” from Client
ESM Government Securities, Inc., was a Fort Lauderdale brokerage firm that specialized in buying and 
selling debt securities issued by the federal government and its various agencies. Its main customers 
were small to moderate-size banks and municipalities. The major type of transaction engaged in by ESM 
was known as a “repo,” in which a securities dealer sells a customer a large block of federal securities 
and simultaneously agrees to repurchase the securities at a later date at an agreed-upon price. A massive 
fraud was conducted at ESM by Ronnie Ewton and Alan Novick, who hid trading losses and other misap­
propriations from ESM’s auditor, Alexander Grant. The trading losses incurred by ESM were transferred to 
an affiliated company. When the thefts and trading losses were finally tallied, there was a net deficit of 
$300 million for ESM.
Sadly, the audit partner, Jose Gomez, was aware of the fraud. Gomez was admitted as a partner to 
Alexander Grant in 1979. His major client was ESM Securities. Shortly after making partner, Gomez was 
informed by Novick that the company’s 1977 and 1978 financial statements had been misstated. Novick 
was able to convince Gomez not to withdraw Alexander Grant’s audit report on the assumption that ESM 
would recoup its losses. Novick was aware that Gomez was experiencing financial problems in spite of his 
salary as a partner. Over the course of the fraud (1977–1984), Gomez received approximately $200,000 in 
payments from Novick to relieve his financial woes.

the subject of the attest engagement does not include any period of his or her former employ­
ment or association with the entity. In addition, if an entity employee joins the CPA firm and 
becomes a covered member with respect to the entity, the CPA firm is not independent unless 
the former entity employee first disassociates from the entity essentially by terminating non­
complying managerial and financial relationships with the entity (see Table 19–4 for details).
Next, consider the situation that arises when a CPA goes to work for an entity audited by 
his or her former CPA firm. This has been a controversial area, because unfortunately several 
of the high-profile frauds of the past decade were facilitated by former auditors. Interpretation 
1.279.020 indicates that a firm’s independence is considered to be impaired with respect to an 
entity if a partner or professional employee leaves the firm and is subsequently employed by 
or associated with that entity in a key position unless a number of conditions are met (see the 
list of terms at the end of the chapter for the definition of a key position). These conditions 
require that the CPA be completely disassociated from the CPA firm, and that the firm take 
steps to ensure that the engagement team exercises sufficient professional skepticism and is 
not unduly influenced by the former employee of the firm (see Table 19–4 for details).
In fact, Interpretation 1.279.010 indicates that if a member of the attest engagement team 
or an individual in a position to influence the attest engagement has a job offer from or even 
develops the intention to seek or discuss potential employment with an attest entity, indepen­
dence is impaired with respect to the entity unless the person promptly reports the situation to 
Interpretations 1.279.010 and 1.279.020—Considering or Subsequent 
Employment or Association With an Attest Client*
Subsequent Employment or Association With an Attest Client
When partners and professional employees who leave their firms and are subsequently employed by, or associated with, one of the firm’s attest clients 
in a key position, the familiarity, self-interest, undue influence, or management participation threats to the member’s compliance with the “Independence 
Rule” would not be at an acceptable level and independence would be impaired unless all of the safeguards in items a–e of the following list are met:
Individual Safeguards:
	a.	Amounts due to the former partner or professional employee for his or her previous interest in the firm and unfunded, vested retirement benefits can­
not be material to the firm, and the underlying formula used to calculate the payments remain fixed during the payout period. The firm may adjust the 
retirement benefits for inflation and pay interest on amounts due.
	b.	The former partner or professional employee is not in a position to influence the firm’s operations or financial policies.
	c.	The former partner or professional employee does not participate or appear to participate in the firm’s business and is not otherwise associated with 
the firm, regardless of whether he or she is compensated for such participation or association, once employment or association with the attest client 
begins.
Ongoing Attest Engagement Team Safeguards:
	d.	The ongoing attest engagement team should consider whether to modify the engagement procedures to adjust for the risk that the former partner’s or 
professional employee’s prior knowledge of the audit plan could reduce audit effectiveness. In addition, if the individual will have significant interac­
tion with the attest engagement team, an appropriate individual in the firm should evaluate whether the existing attest engagement team members 
have sufficient experience and stature to deal effectively with the individual in conducting the engagement.
	e.	If the former partner or professional employee joins the attest client in a key position within one year of disassociating from the firm and has signifi­
cant interaction with the attest engagement team, an appropriate professional in the firm should review the subsequent attest engagement to deter­
mine whether the engagement team members maintained the appropriate level of skepticism when evaluating the individual’s representations and 
work. The professional applying this safeguard should have appropriate stature, expertise, and objectivity. In performing this review, the professional 
should consider relevant factors, such as the position that the individual assumed at the attest client, the position that the individual held at the firm, 
and the nature of the services that the individual provided to the attest client. The professional should take appropriate actions, as deemed necessary, 
based on the results of this review.
Considering Employment or Association with an Attest Client
When a member of the attest engagement team or an individual in a position to influence the attest engagement intends to seek or discuss potential 
employment or association with an attest client, or is in receipt of a specific offer of employment from an attest client, independence will be impaired 
with respect to the client unless the person promptly reports such consideration or offer to an appropriate person in the firm, and removes himself or 
herself from the engagement until the employment offer is rejected or employment is no longer being sought. When a covered member becomes aware 
that a member of the attest engagement team or an individual in a position to influence the attest engagement is considering employment or association 
with a client, the covered member should notify an appropriate person in the firm.
The appropriate person should consider what additional procedures may be necessary to provide reasonable assurance that any work performed for 
the client by that person was performed in accordance with the Integrity and Objectivity Rule. Additional procedures, such as reperformance of work 
already done, will depend on the nature of the engagement and the individual involved.

an appropriate person in the firm and removes himself or herself from the engagement until 
the offer is rejected or employment is no longer being sought. If another employee of the 
CPA firm becomes aware that a member of the attest engagement team (or an individual in a 
position to influence the attest engagement) is considering employment with an attest entity, 
the employee should notify an appropriate person in the firm so the firm can take steps to 
prevent the impairment of its independence. In addition, in such cases the appropriate person 
in the firm should consider whether the firm should perform additional procedures to provide 
reasonable assurance that any work performed by the individual was in compliance with the 
“Integrity and Objectivity Rule.”

Despite the restrictions on auditors accepting key positions for former audit clients, auditors con-
tinue to be highly sought to fill high-level financial management positions. The breadth and depth of 
the business knowledge and expertise auditors develop by working with various clients over time 
makes them highly valuable to companies as prospective employees, especially once the auditor 
has reached the manager or partner level. Thus, companies continue to find various ways to hire for-
mer auditors while allowing the auditors and their former firms to comply with professional standards.
Another type of business relationship can arise when a CPA is asked to serve as an hon-
orary director or trustee for a not-for-profit entity. It is not unusual for members of a CPA 
firm to be asked to lend the prestige of their names to a charitable, religious, civic, or similar 
organization and for their firm to provide accounting and auditing services to the not-for-
profit organization. Interpretation 1.275.010 allows a member to serve as a director or trustee 
for an audited not-for-profit entity “so long as his or her position is clearly honorary, and he 
or she cannot vote or otherwise participate in board or management functions.” Any of the 
organization’s documents that contain the member’s name must identify the member’s posi-
tion as honorary.
Interpretation 1.275.005 permits a CPA to seek employment as an adjunct faculty mem-
ber of an educational institution that is an audited entity of the CPA’s firm. Such a relationship 
does not impair independence provided that the CPA does not hold a key position at the edu-
cational institution, does not participate on the attest engagement team, is not an individual in 
a position to influence the attest engagement, is employed by the educational institution on a 
part-time and nontenure basis, and does not assume any management responsibilities or set 
policies for the educational institution.
Effect of Family Relationships  The issues related to a CPA’s financial or business 
interest in an entity may extend to members of the CPA’s family, according to Interpretation 
1.270.010. Certain relationships between members of a CPA’s family and an audited entity 
are considered to affect the CPA’s independence. This is an area where the AICPA’s inde-
pendence rules have been modified to recognize changing social factors such as dual-career 
families. A distinction is made in the Code’s Section 0.400 definitions of a covered mem-
ber’s immediate family (spouse, spousal equivalent, or dependent, regardless of whether the 
dependent is related) and close relatives (parent, sibling, or nondependent child). As shown 
in Table 19–3, a covered member’s immediate family is subject to the Independence Rule. 
Table 19–3 indicates a few exceptions, the first of which is that a covered member’s spouse 
employed by an audited entity would not impair independence if he or she were not employed 
in a key position.
Financial or business interests by close relatives that are not members of the auditor’s 
immediate family, such as nondependent children, brothers, sisters, parents, grandparents, 
parents-in-law, and their respective spouses, do not normally impair independence. Interpre-
tation 1.270.100 (see Table 19–3) lists the situations where independence would be impaired 
by a close relative. The two major situations that can impair independence are as follows:
	
∙	 A close relative has a financial interest in the entity that is material to the close 
relative, and the CPA participating in the engagement is aware of the interest

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
649
	
∙	 An individual participating in the engagement has a close relative who could exercise 
significant influence over the financial or accounting policies of the entity (i.e., a  
key position)
For example, suppose a staff auditor’s brother works as the controller for an entity 
audited by the CPA firm. Because the staff auditor’s brother exercises influence over signifi-
cant accounting functions for the entity, the staff auditor would not be allowed to participate 
in the audit of this entity.

The PCAOB sanctioned a regional accounting firm and its partners for, among other things, violat-
ing PCAOB independence standards. At the time of the firm’s audit of a client, the mother of one of 
the partners owned stock in the client along with warrants to purchase additional stock. The partner 
knew of his mother’s investments and their material nature to her. He also helped purchase the 
shares of stock before the audit commenced and then actually sold the shares for his mother after 
the issuance of the audit report. The partner and the firm also failed to conduct basic audit proce-
dures during the course of this audit and other audits and, as a result, the firm was permanently 
revoked of its registration and the partner in question was permanently banned from association 
with a registered public accounting firm (PCAOB Release 105-2007-009).
Effect of Actual or Threatened Litigation  Sometimes threatened or actual litigation 
between the entity and the auditor can impair the auditor’s independence. Such situations 
affect the CPA’s independence when a possible adversarial relationship exists between the 
entity and the CPA. Interpretation 1.290.010 cites three categories of litigation: (1) litigation 
between the entity and the CPA, (2) litigation by security holders, and (3) other third-party 
litigation where the CPA’s independence may be impaired.
In order for a CPA to provide an opinion on an entity’s financial statements, the relation-
ship between the entity’s management and the CPA must be one of “complete candor and full 
disclosure regarding all aspects of the entity’s business operations.” When actual or threat-
ened litigation exists between management and the CPA, complete candor may not be pos-
sible. The following criteria are offered as guidelines for assessing independence when actual 
or threatened litigation exists between the audited entity and the CPA:
	
∙	 The commencement of litigation by the present management alleging deficiencies in 
audit work for the entity would be considered to impair independence
	
∙	 An expressed intention by the present management to commence litigation against 
the CPA alleging deficiencies in audit work would also impair independence if the 
auditor concluded that it is probable that such a claim will be filed
	
∙	 The commencement of litigation by the CPA against the present management alleging 
management fraud or deceit would be considered to impair independence
Litigation by entity security holders or other third parties also may impair the auditor’s 
independence under certain circumstances. For example, litigation may arise from a class 
action lawsuit by stockholders alleging that the entity’s management, officers, directors, 
underwriters, and auditors were involved in the issuance of “false or misleading financial 
statements.” Generally, such lawsuits do not alter the fundamental relationship between the 
CPA and the entity. However, independence may be impaired if material entity–auditor cross-
claims are filed. For example, suppose that a class action suit is filed and the current entity 
management intends to testify against the CPA, alleging that an improper audit was con-
ducted. In such a situation, an adversarial relationship would exist and the CPA would no lon-
ger be independent. When this occurs, the CPA should either withdraw from the engagement 
or disclaim an opinion because of a lack of independence.
Provision of Nonattest Services  The AICPA Code of Professional Conduct restricts the 
types of nonaudit services that can be provided to attest entities. Interpretation 1.295.010 
outlines these requirements and binds member CPAs to follow the relevant requirements of 

650	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
other regulatory bodies where applicable. The Code permits CPAs to provide bookkeeping, 
systems implementation, internal audit outsourcing, and other services to nonpublic attest 
entities subject to certain conditions and limits. For example, a CPA may assist an audit entity 
in implementing a computer software package but may not “design” the financial information 
system by creating or changing the computer source code underlying the system. If the auditor 
makes any such modifications, the changes cannot be “more than insignificant.” In addition, 
the Code indicates that CPAs may not perform appraisal, valuation, or actuarial services if the 
results of those services will have a material effect on the entity’s financial statements and the 
service involves considerable subjectivity.
Interpretation 1.295.040 of the Code outlines general requirements for performing other 
professional services for attest entities. This interpretation basically indicates that in perform­
ing nonattest services for an attest entity, the CPA should ensure that the entity assumes all 
management responsibilities. The entity must appropriately oversee and evaluate the ade­
quacy and results of the nonattest services performed and be responsible for making signifi­
cant judgments and decisions that are the proper responsibility of management. If the entity 
is unable or unwilling to assume these responsibilities (for example, the entity cannot oversee 
the nonattest services due to lack of ability, time, or desire), providing these services would 
impair the CPA’s independence with respect to any attest services to be provided to that entity.
Interpretation 1.295.040 indicates that prior to performing nonattest services the CPA 
should establish with the entity in writing the objectives of the engagement, the services to be 
performed, the entity’s acceptance of its responsibilities, the CPA’s responsibilities, and any 
anticipated limitations of the engagement.
Some of the examples offered in Interpretation 1.295.040 of management responsibilities 
that would be considered to impair a CPA’s independence include the following:
	
∙ 	 Setting policy or strategic direction for the attest client
	
∙	 Authorizing, executing, or consummating a transaction or otherwise exercising 
authority on behalf of an entity
	
∙	 Preparing source documents, in electronic or other form, evidencing the occurrence 
of a transaction
	
∙	 Having custody of entity assets
	
∙	 Supervising the entity’s employees in the performance of their normal recurring 
activities
	
∙	 Determining which recommendations of the member should be implemented
	
∙	 Establishing or maintaining internal controls, including performing ongoing 
monitoring activities for an entity
	
∙	 Reporting to those charged with governance on behalf of management
	
∙	 Accepting responsibility for the preparation and fair presentation of the attest client’s 
financial statements
So long as the CPA stays within the general guidelines described in Interpretation 
1.295.040 and effectively manages threats to independence, the AICPA does not strictly pro­
hibit the provision of most types of professional services to nonpublic attest entities. For 
example, the Code allows a CPA firm to provide outsourced internal audit services for an 
entity for which the member also performs a professional service that requires independence 
(i.e., an audit or other attest service) so long as the entity retains responsibility for directing 
and managing the internal audit function. Performing these extended audit services would not 
be considered to impair independence provided the member or his or her firm does not act or 
appear to act as either employee or management of the entity.
While the AICPA Code of Professional Ethics permits internal audit outsourcing for 
nonpublic attest entities, the SEC prohibits providing this and most other types of nonaudit 
professional services to public company audit entities. The ways in which SEC and PCAOB 
independence rules for the audits of public companies differ from AICPA standards are dis­
cussed next.

SEC and PCAOB Independence Requirements for Audits of Public Companies 
The SEC’s mission is to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the capital markets in 
which the securities of publicly traded companies are bought and sold. As part of its mission, 
the SEC has authority to establish standards relating to financial accounting, auditing, and the 
professional conduct of public accountants in the context of public company accounting and 
auditing. The SEC delegates its authority to set standards for audits of public companies to the 
PCAOB but the SEC must review and approve those standards before they become effective.
In this section we discuss the primary areas in which the SEC and PCAOB independence 
rules differ from those of the AICPA Code of Professional Conduct. Until the past few years, 
the SEC’s independence rules for auditors of public companies closely followed those of the 
AICPA. However, in November 2000 the SEC implemented more stringent rules, which were 
further revised in January 2003, after Title II of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act required additional 
independence restrictions. You will better understand the reasoning behind the SEC’s audi­
tor independence (and other) requirements if you keep in mind that they were in response to 
specific circumstances that came to light in the frauds of the early 2000s. For example, Arthur 
Andersen was earning more in consulting than in auditing fees at Enron, and David Duncan, 
Andersen’s lead partner on the Enron engagement, was compensated in part based on the 
amount of nonaudit services he sold to the company. Further, several of Enron’s employees in 
important accounting and finance positions were former Andersen auditors who had worked 
on the Enron audit engagement.
While most of the SEC’s independence rules are very similar to the AICPA’s, the changes 
resulted in some important differences relating to (1) provision of other professional services, 
(2) handling of human resource and compensation-related issues, and (3) certain required 
communications.11 The major differences in these three areas are discussed next.
Provision of Other Professional Services.  The SEC’s rules with respect to services provided 
by auditors are predicated on three basic principles of auditor objectivity and independence: 
(1) an auditor should not audit his or her own work, (2) an auditor should not function in the 
role of management, and (3) an auditor should not serve in an advocacy role for the entity. 
Consistent with these principles, the SEC prohibits several types of professional services by 
accounting firms for public company audit and review entities, sometimes with the qualifier 
“unless it is reasonable to conclude that the results of these services will not be subject to 
audit procedures during an audit of the entity’s financial statements.” Note that the rules do 
not limit the scope of nonaudit services provided by accounting firms to nonpublic companies 
or to public companies that are not audit entities. Additionally, accounting firms are allowed 
to provide certain types of tax services to their audit entities.
The SEC specifies nine categories of nonaudit services that, with few exceptions, are 
considered to impair independence if provided to a public company audit entity. They are as 
follows:
	
∙	 Bookkeeping or other services related to the accounting records or financial 
statements of the audit entity
	
∙	 Financial information systems design and implementation

The PCAOB sanctioned a regional accounting firm and its partners for, among other things, providing 
prohibited services to a client. During the course of the audit, the audit firm actually made journal 
entries, generated the trial balances for the financial statements, made accounting decisions for the 
issuer, and generated the financial statements and footnotes. As a result of this and other violations, 
the firm was permanently revoked of its registration and the partner in charge was permanently 
banned from association with a registered public accounting firm (PCAOB Release 105-2007-009).

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
	
∙	 Appraisal or valuation services, fairness opinions, or contribution-in-kind reports
	
∙	 Actuarial services
	
∙	 Internal audit outsourcing services
	
∙	 Management functions or human resources
	
∙	 Broker or dealer, investment adviser, or investment banking services
	
∙	 Legal services
	
∙	 Expert services
While the first eight categories of services listed above were prohibited under pre-
Sarbanes SEC independence rules (“expert services” was added later), a number of excep­
tions to these prohibitions were eliminated under the Act.
Consistent with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, SEC regulations also prohibit any other service 
that the PCAOB determines impermissible. The PCAOB has added several independence-
related rules of its own relating to audits of public companies. For example, while PCAOB 
independence rules do not prohibit the provision of tax services to audit entities in general, 
they do identify circumstances in which the provision of tax services impairs an auditor’s 
independence, including services that involve aggressive interpretations of applicable tax 
laws and regulations. The rules also treat registered public accounting firms as not indepen­
dent of their audit entities if they enter into contingent fee arrangements with those entities 
for any professional services or if the firms provide tax services to members of management 
who serve in financial reporting oversight roles at an audit entity or to their immediate family 
members.
The SEC and PCAOB rules require that all audit and nonaudit services provided by a 
public company’s auditor be considered and approved by the company’s audit committee. 
This requirement is intended to facilitate the proper oversight by the audit committee on the 
external audit by requiring the audit committee to consider the potential effects of nonaudit 
services on the auditor’s objectivity and on investors’ perceptions of the auditor’s indepen­
dence from the company.
Practice 
INSIGHT
While SEC rules prohibit many types of consulting for public company audit clients, many public 
accounting firms are still heavily engaged in providing consulting services for nonaudit clients.
Human Resource and Compensation-Related Issues.  SEC rules in this area are primarily 
concerned with the potential for audit partners to become “too close” to an engagement or an 
audited entity over time and with potential threats to an auditor’s objectivity resulting from 
employment and compensation arrangements that can create conflicts of interest. These rules 
can be summarized in three areas.
First, the lead and engagement quality review partners on the engagement team for a pub­
lic company audit are prohibited from providing audit services to the company for more than 
five consecutive years.12 Once the partners “roll off” an entity, a five-year “time-out” period 
is required before they can return to their former duties with that entity. Audit partners other 
than the lead and quality review partners are prohibited from performing audit services for a 
particular entity for more than seven consecutive years, with a two-year time-out period.
Second, unless a one-year “cooling-off” period has passed, an accounting firm is prohib­
ited from auditing a public company’s financial statements where a former member of the 
audit team is currently employed by the entity in a “financial reporting oversight role.”13
12The lead partner is the partner primarily responsible for the decisions made on an audit engagement. The engage-
ment quality review partner is not directly involved with the decisions made during the engagement but instead is 
charged with reviewing significant evidence and conclusions to determine whether or not the engagement was con-
ducted properly and conclusions appropriately made.
13The cooling-off period is defined as the one-year period preceding the commencement of audit procedures for the 
period that included the date the engagement team member was first employed by the audited entity.

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
653
Finally, the SEC does not consider an accounting firm to be independent from an audited 
public company if an audit partner receives compensation based on selling engagements to that 
entity for services other than audit, review, and attest services. This applies not only to audits 
of domestic issuers but also to audits of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates of U.S. issuers.
Practice 
INSIGHT
While there are benefits associated with mandatory partner rotation, it comes with considerable 
cost. The first general auditing standard requires that the audit be performed by a person who has 
adequate technical training and proficiency as an auditor. While the five-year “time-out” requirement 
for the engagement partner provides for a new set of eyes and a fresh look at the engagement, it 
can also lead to a sharp drop-off in client-specific experience on the engagement every five years.
Required Communication.  SEC rules also differ from those of the AICPA in requiring addi­
tional communication between auditors and their entities’ audit committees and in requiring 
public company audit entities to reveal information regarding the fees paid to their auditors 
for any type of service.
The auditor of a public company must report to the company’s audit committee all “criti­
cal accounting policies” used by the company, all alternative treatments within GAAP for pol­
icies and procedures related to material items discussed with management, and other material 
written communications between the auditor and the company’s management. In addition, 
the audit committee must be responsible for the appointment, compensation, and oversight 
of the external auditor’s work. This requirement is important, because it establishes the audit 
committee as the entity to which the auditor reports, rather than management itself. Remem­
ber that management is ultimately responsible for a company’s financial statements. Because 
the audit committee of a public company must be independent of management, establishing 
the audit committee as the point of contact for the auditor creates a healthier environment in 
which the auditor does not answer directly to or receive compensation from management.
Proxy statements and annual reports issued by public companies must contain disclo­
sures regarding (1) audit fees, (2) audit-related fees, (3) tax fees, and (4) all other fees billed 
during the prior two fiscal years by the principal auditor of the company’s financial state­
ments. Details must also be provided on the nature of services provided in earning “other 
fees.” The preapproval policies of the company’s audit committee must also be disclosed. 
A purpose of this requirement is to make companies more sensitive to public perceptions of 
auditor independence and objectivity.
Other Sections of the Code of Professional Conduct
Other sections in the Code of Professional conduct relate to General Standards and Account­
ing Principles, Responsibilities to Clients, and Other Responsibilities and Practices.
General Standards and Accounting Principles
This section of the Rules of Conduct contains two rules related to general standards and one 
rule related to accounting principles.
General Standards Rule (1.300.001): A member shall comply with the following standards and 
with any interpretations thereof by bodies designated by Council:
	
A.	Professional Competence. Undertake only those professional services that the member or the 
member’s firm can reasonably expect to be completed with professional competence.
	
B.	 Due Professional Care. Exercise due professional care in the performance of professional 
services.
	
C.	 Planning and Supervision. Adequately plan and supervise the performance of professional 
services.
	
D.	Sufficient Relevant Data. Obtain sufficient relevant data to afford a reasonable basis for conclu­
sions or recommendations in relation to any professional services performed.
LO 19-7

654	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
The Code’s General Standards Rule essentially captures much of what is contained in 
the 10 generally accepted auditing standards pertaining to auditor conduct and makes it part 
of the Code. Interpretation 1.300.010 provides some additional clarification of “professional 
competence.” In particular, when a CPA agrees to perform professional services, he or she is 
expected to have the necessary competence to complete those services according to profes­
sional standards. However, it is not necessary for the CPA to have all the technical knowl­
edge required to perform the engagement at the time the engagement commences. The CPA 
may conduct additional research or consult with other professionals during the conduct of the 
engagement. This need for additional information does not indicate a lack of competence on 
the part of the CPA unless he or she fails to acquire the needed information. The technical, 
legal definition of “due care” is covered in Chapter 20.
Compliance with Standards Rule (1.310.001): A member who performs auditing, review, com­
pilation, management consulting, tax, or other professional services shall comply with standards 
promulgated by bodies designated by Council.
This rule is straightforward yet important because it requires that members of the AICPA 
comply with professional standards when performing professional services, whether or not 
they are practicing in public accounting.
While the Compliance with Standards Rule addresses compliance with standards for pro­
fessional services, the Accounting Principles Rule requires CPAs to report in compliance with 
appropriate accounting principles.
Accounting Principles Rule (1.320.001): A member shall not (1) express an opinion or state affir­
matively that the financial statements or other financial data of any entity are presented in confor­
mity with generally accepted accounting principles or (2) state that he or she is not aware of any 
material modifications that should be made to such statements or data in order for them to be in 
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, if such statements or data contain any 
departure from an accounting principle promulgated by bodies designated by Council to establish 
such principles that has a material effect on the statements or data taken as a whole. . . .
Interpretation 1.320.020 reiterates that the AICPA Council has designated the Finan­
cial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Governmental Accounting Standards Board 
(GASB), and the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) as the bodies 
authorized to establish accounting principles.
Interpretation 1.320.010 (and 2.320.010, which relates to members in industry), states 
that any representation regarding conformity with GAAP or other financial reporting frame­
work in a letter or other communication related to an entity’s financial statements is subject to 
the Accounting Principles Rule. Thus, for example, if a member knowingly signs a represen­
tation letter indicating that the financial statements were in conformity with GAAP when in 
fact they were not, he or she has violated the Accounting Principles Rule whether he or she is 
in public practice or working in a business position such as controller or CFO.
Responsibilities to Clients
This section of the Rules of Conduct contains two rules related to a CPA’s responsibilities to 
his or her entities: Confidential Client Information and Contingent Fees.
Confidential Client Information Rule (1.700.001, excerpted): A member in public practice shall 
not disclose any confidential client information without the specific consent of the client.
The Confidential Client Information Rule and its interpretations generally prohibit the 
auditor from disclosing confidential entity information but specify five situations in which a 
CPA can disclose confidential information without the entity’s consent: (1) to meet disclosure 
and performance requirements under GAAP and GAAS; (2) to comply with a valid subpoena; 
(3) to allow a review of a member’s professional practice under the authority of the AICPA, 
a state CPA society, or a state board of accountancy; (4) to comply with an investigative or 
disciplinary proceeding; and (5) to allow a review of a CPA’s professional practice in conjunc­
tion with the purchase, sale, or merger of the practice. In the last case, the CPA should take 

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
655
precautions that the prospective buyer does not disclose any confidential entity information 
to outside parties, usually through a confidentiality agreement. The prospective buyer should 
not use information they obtain to their advantage or disclose confidential information to 
outside parties.
Contingent Fees Rule (1.510.001, excerpted): A member in public practice shall not
	
(1)	 Perform for a contingent fee any professional services for, or receive such a fee from, a client 
for whom the member or the member’s firm performs
(a)	 an audit or review of a financial statement; or
(b)	a compilation of a financial statement when the member expects, or reasonably might 
expect, that a third party will use the financial statement and the member’s compilation 
report does not disclose a lack of independence; or
(c)	 an examination of prospective financial information; or
	
(2)	 Prepare an original or amended tax return or claim for a tax refund for a contingent fee for 
any client.
The Contingent Fees Rule goes on to explain that the prohibition of contingent fees 
applies during the period in which the member or member’s firm is engaged to perform any 
of the services listed and the period covered by any historical financial statements involved in 
any such services. A contingent fee is a fee that depends on the finding or result attained as a 
result of the member’s work. With respect to this rule, fees are not regarded as being contin­
gent if fixed by courts or other public authorities, or, in tax matters, if determined based on 
the results of judicial proceedings or the findings of governmental agencies. It is permissible 
for a member’s fees to vary depending on other factors, for example, on the complexity of the 
services rendered.
If contingent fees were allowed for attestation-related services, users of those services 
might question the CPA’s independence. As mentioned previously, PCAOB independence 
rules do not allow auditors to provide any services to public company audited entities for a 
contingent fee, including tax services.
Other Responsibilities and Practices
This section contains four rules of conduct that relate to other aspects of the profession: Acts 
Discreditable, Advertising and Other Forms of Solicitation, Commissions and Referral Fees, 
and Form of Organization and Name.
Acts Discreditable Rule (1.400.001): A member shall not commit an act discreditable to the 
profession.
This rule allows the AICPA to remove a member for committing acts that may affect the pro­
fession’s reputation. For example, a CPA who is convicted of a serious crime could lose his or 
her membership in the AICPA. Some of the interpretations have been issued that identify acts 
considered discreditable under the Acts Discreditable Rule relate to the following: 
	
∙	 Discrimination and harassment in employment practices (.010)
	
∙	 Solicitation or disclosure of CPA Examination questions and answers (.020)
	
∙	 Failure to file a tax return or pay a tax liability (.030)
	
∙	 Negligence in the preparation of financial statements or records (.040)
	
∙	 Failure to follow requirements of governmental bodies, commissions, or other 
regulatory agencies (.050)
	
∙	 Confidential information obtained from employment or volunteer activities (.070)
	
∙	 False, misleading, or deceptive acts in promoting or marketing professional 
services (.090)
	
∙	 Improper use of the CPA credential (.100)
	
∙	 Failure to comply with records requests (.200)

656	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
For example, under Interpretation 1.400.200, records provided by the entity in the mem­
ber’s custody or control should be returned to the entity even if there are fees still unpaid. If 
the CPA retains certain entity records such as journals or ledgers, the entity may be unable to 
continue operations. If a CPA does not appropriately respond to an entity’s request to return 
the entity’s accounting records within 45 days (absent extenuating circumstances), that mem­
ber commits a discreditable act. The CPA may decline to provide entity records and other 
supporting records prepared by the CPA if there are fees due for the preparation of those 
records. The CPA’s working papers, by contrast, are the property of the CPA and need not be 
provided to the entity unless required by state or federal statutes or regulations, or contractual 
agreements.
A CPA also commits a discreditable act if he or she discriminates in hiring, promotion, 
or salary practices on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, age, or national origin. Similarly, 
a CPA commits a discreditable act when he or she, by virtue of his or her negligence, makes, 
permits, or directs another to make false or misleading entries in the financial statements or 
records of an entity. Another example of a discreditable act is the failure to file a tax return or 
pay the related tax liability.
Advertising and Other Forms of Solicitation Rule (1.600.001): A member in public practice 
shall not seek to obtain clients by advertising or other forms of solicitation in a manner that is false, 
misleading, or deceptive. Solicitation by the use of coercion, over-reaching, or harassing conduct 
is prohibited.
Interpretation 1.600.010 provides specific examples of activities that are prohibited by 
this rule. These include the following:
	
∙	 Creating false or unjustifiable expectations of favorable results
	
∙	 Implying an ability to influence any court, tribunal, regulatory agency, or similar 
body or official
	
∙	 Claiming that specific professional services in current or future periods will be 
performed for a stated fee, estimated fee, or fee range when it is likely at the time of 
representation that such fees will be substantially increased and the prospective entity 
is not advised of that likelihood
	
∙	 Making any other representations that would be likely to cause a reasonable person to 
misunderstand or be deceived
Commissions and Referral Fees Rule (1.520.001): 
A. Prohibited commissions
A member in public practice shall not for a commission recommend or refer to a client any 
product or service, or for a commission recommend or refer any product or service to be sup­
plied by a client, or receive a commission, when a member or the member’s firm also performs 
for that client
	
∙	 an audit or review of financial statements; or
	
∙	 a compilation of a financial statement when the member expects, or reasonably might expect, 
that a third party will use the financial statement and the member’s compilation report does not 
disclose a lack of independence; or
	
∙	 an examination of prospective financial information.
This prohibition applies during the period in which the member is engaged to perform 
any of the services listed above and the period covered by any historical financial statements 
involved in the listed services.
B. Disclosure of permitted commissions
A member in public practice who is not prohibited by this rule from performing services for or 
receiving a commission and who is paid or expects to be paid a commission shall disclose that fact 
to any person or entity to whom the member recommends or refers a product or service to which 
the commission relates.

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
657
C. Referral fees
Any member who accepts a referral fee for recommending or referring any service of a CPA to any 
person or entity or who pays a referral fee to obtain a client shall disclose such acceptance or pay­
ment to the client.
Many professions, including doctors and lawyers, have been permitted to use referral 
fees. However, commissions and referral fees are prohibited for CPAs in situations where the 
CPA’s independence and objectivity are a focal point of attestation-related services.
Form of Organization and Name Rule (1.800.001): A member may practice public accounting 
only in a form of organization permitted by law or regulation whose characteristics conform to 
resolutions of Council.
A member shall not practice public accounting under a firm name that is misleading. Names of 
one or more past partners may be included in the firm name of a successor organization.
A firm may not designate itself as “Members of the American Institute of Certified Public 
Accountants” unless all of its CPA owners are members of the Institute.
This rule requires that the form of a CPA’s public accounting practice conform to law or 
regulations whose characteristics conform to AICPA resolutions. In recent years, virtually all 
states have passed laws that allow CPAs to practice as limited liability partnerships. This rule 
also prohibits firms from operating under names that may mislead the public.
A resolution by the AICPA Council requires, among other things, that a majority of the 
financial interests in a firm engaged in attest services be owned by CPAs. In recent years, 
alternative practice structures have evolved under which, for example, CPA firms were pur­
chased by other entities, and (1) the majority of the financial interests in the attest firm was 
owned by CPAs and (2) all or substantially all of the revenues were paid to another entity 
in return for services and the lease of employees, equipment, and office space. If the CPAs 
who own the firm remain financially responsible, under applicable state law or regulation the 
member is considered to be in compliance with the financial interests provision of the resolu­
tion. The revised Code of Professional Conduct addresses issues surrounding the structure 
of public accounting firms in detail in Code Section 1.220 but discussion of these issues is 
beyond the scope of this chapter.
Disciplinary Actions
The AICPA has a number of avenues by which members can be disciplined for violating the 
Code of Professional Conduct. For violations that are not sufficient to warrant formal action, 
the PEEC can direct a member to take remedial or corrective actions. If the member rejects 
the committee’s recommendation, the committee can refer the case to a hearing panel of the 
Trial Board. Membership in the AICPA can be suspended or terminated without a hearing if 
the member has been convicted of certain criminal offenses (such as a crime punishable by 
imprisonment for more than one year or filing a false income tax return on an entity’s behalf) 
or if the member’s CPA certificate is suspended or revoked by a government agency. A mem­
ber may also be expelled or suspended from the AICPA for up to two years for violating any 
rule of the Code of Professional Conduct. For more information on the AICPA’s disciplinary 
processes, see the bylaws of the AICPA on the AICPA’s website. In addition, because the 
Code of Professional Conduct has been adopted by most State Boards of Accountancy, which 
have authority to grant or revoke professional licenses, violations of the Code can result in 
suspension or revocation of a practitioner’s right to practice. Of course, the SEC and the 
PCAOB also have several options for pursuing disciplinary and even legal actions against 
auditors. These are briefly discussed in Chapter 20 in the context of auditor legal liability.
Don’t Lose Sight of the Forest for the Trees
As you can see from the preceding discussion, the rules and interpretations relating to auditor 
independence and professional conduct are complicated subjects, involving a great deal of 
technical detail. A sense for the depth of detail involved is essential. However, we encourage 

658	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
you not to lose sight of the big picture! The primary purpose of professional ethics rules is 
to establish a minimum level of professionalism to help auditors remain independent of the 
entities they audit and to be objective and honest in their judgments. The essence of even the 
mind-numbingly detailed independence requirements is that independence in fact and appear­
ance is critical to the CPA’s reputation and the value she or he provides to society. Unfor­
tunately, even practicing auditors can get so lost in the details of the specific requirements 
that they sometimes lose sight of the fundamental principles on which the rules are based. 
If you pursue a career in accounting, you should at least occasionally step back and review 
the fundamental principles of the Code of Professional Conduct, which involve appropriate 
professional and moral judgments in all you do, an obligation to honor the public trust, and a 
commitment to perform professional responsibilities with the highest sense of integrity.
Quality Control Standards
CPA firms are required to implement policies and procedures to monitor the firms’ practices 
and ensure that professional standards are being followed. In 1977 the AICPA started a volun­
tary peer review program, and by January 1988 had instituted mandatory quality peer reviews, 
which still happen today. The program is structured in two tiers: one for firms that have public 
company audit entities and one for (usually smaller) firms that audit only private companies. 
The purpose of the quality review program is to ensure that firms comply with relevant qual­
ity control standards.
In 2004, the PCAOB assumed the AICPA’s oversight responsibilities relating to the parts 
of firms’ practices relating to the audits of public companies and instituted a mandatory qual­
ity inspection program for those firms. The PCAOB also took responsibility for the issuance 
of new quality control standards pertaining to firms that audit public company entities. The 
AICPA, however, maintains a Peer Review Program (PRP) designed to review and evaluate 
those portions of firms’ accounting and auditing practices that are not subject to inspection 
by the PCAOB. The goal of the PRP is to promote quality in the accounting and audit ser­
vices provided by individual members of the AICPA and their firms. Reviews are performed 
by firms and individuals approved by the Peer Review Board. The AICPA’s National Peer 
Review Committee (PRC) oversees and approves reviews for firms that also require PCAOB 
inspection (and for firms that perform audits of non-SEC issuers pursuant to the standards 
of the PCAOB). All other firms may have their reviews approved by the National PRC or by 
another administrative entity approved by the Peer Review Board.
The AICPA’s PRP consists of two types of reviews: system reviews and engagement 
reviews. CPA firms that perform audits and related accounting work undergo system reviews, 
which focus on a firm’s system of quality control. The peer reviewer’s objective in a system 
review is to determine if the firm’s policies and procedures for quality control conform to 
professional standards and if the firm is complying with its quality control system. The peer 
reviewer gains an understanding of the company’s system of quality control and then tests the 
system by reviewing a sample of the firm’s engagements. CPA firms that don’t perform audits 
or similar engagements, but perform other accounting work such as reviews and compila­
tions, undergo engagement reviews, which focus on work performed on particular selected 
engagements rather than the quality control system as a whole. Neither system nor engage­
ment reviews include a review of a firm’s tax or consulting practice.
While the PCAOB adopted the AICPA’s quality control standards in April 2003, the 
AICPA has since released Statement on Quality Control Standards (SQCS) No. 8, “A Firm’s 
System of Quality Control,” which supersedes all previous SQCS. While the PCAOB has 
not yet adopted this standard, many auditing firms have already integrated its concepts into 
their systems of quality control for all audit entities, since it represents the state of the art 
in quality control for accounting firms. Thus, the remainder of this section discusses only 
the requirements of the newest standard, SQCS No. 8, which applies only to audit, attest, 
compilation, review, and any other services for which standards have been established by the 
AICPA. While not required, it is recommended that the guidance in this statement be applied 
to other services such as tax and consulting services.
LO 19-8

	
Chapter 19    Professional Conduct, Independence, and Quality Control	
659
System of Quality Control
A firm’s system of quality control should be designed to provide the firm with reasonable assur­
ance that the firm and its personnel comply with professional, legal, and regulatory require­
ments and that the partners issue appropriate reports (SQCS 8.12). A firm’s system of quality 
control, however, has to be tailored to the firm’s size, the nature of its practice, its organization, 
and cost-benefit considerations. For a sole practitioner or small firm, a system of quality control 
is likely to be much less formal than for a national or international firm. For example, a sole 
practitioner with three professional staff members may use a simple checklist and conduct peri­
odic informal discussions to monitor his or her firm’s compliance with professional standards. 
On the other hand, a large international CPA firm may develop involved, in-house procedures 
and assign full- or part-time staff to oversee and ensure compliance with the firm’s quality 
control system.
Elements of Quality Control
SQCS No. 8 identifies the following six elements of quality control:
	
1.	 Leadership responsibilities for quality in the firm (“tone at the top”)
	
2.	 Relevant ethical requirements
	
3.	 Acceptance and continuance of entity relationships and specific engagements
	
4.	 Human resources
	
5.	 Engagement performance
	
6.	 Monitoring
Table 19–5 defines each of the elements. It should be apparent from the definitions that 
these elements are interrelated. For example, the human resources element encompasses 
criteria for professional development, hiring, advancement, and assignment of the firm’s 
Elements of Quality Control
	1.	 Leadership responsibilities for quality within the firm (the “tone at the top”): The firm should establish poli­
cies and procedures designed to promote an internal culture based on the recognition that quality is essential in 
performing engagements. Such policies and procedures should require the firm’s leadership (managing partner or 
board of managing partners, CEO, or equivalent) to assume ultimate responsibility for the firm’s system of quality 
control. The firm should establish policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that 
any person or persons assigned operational responsibility for the firm’s system of quality control by the firm’s lead­
ership has sufficient and appropriate experience and ability, and the necessary authority, to assume that responsi­
bility (SQCS 8.19–20).
	2.	Relevant Ethical Requirements: The firm should establish policies and procedures designed to provide it with 
reasonable assurance that the firm and its personnel comply with relevant ethical requirements (SQCS 8.21).
	3.	Acceptance and Continuance of Client Relationships and Specific Engagements: The firm should establish 
policies and procedures for the acceptance and continuance of client relationships and specific engagements, 
designed to provide the firm with reasonable assurance that it will undertake or continue relationships and 
engagements only when the firm is competent to perform the engagement and has the capabilities, including time 
and resources, to do so; can comply with legal and relevant ethical requirements; and has considered the integrity 
of the client and does not have information that would lead it to conclude that the client lacks integrity (SQCS 8.27).
	4.	Human Resources: The firm should establish policies and procedures designed to provide it with reasonable 
assurance that it has sufficient personnel with the competence, capabilities, and commitment to ethical principles 
necessary to perform engagements in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements and enable the firm to issue reports that are appropriate in the circumstances. The firm’s policies and 
procedures should provide that personnel selected for advancement have the qualifications necessary for fulfill­
ment of the responsibilities that they will be called on to assume (SQCS 8.31-32).
	5.	Engagement Performance: The firm should establish policies and procedures designed to provide it with reason­
able assurance that engagements are performed in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal 
and regulatory requirements and that the firm issues reports that are appropriate in the circumstances. Such poli­
cies and procedures should include the following (SQCS 8.35):
	 a.	Matters relevant to promoting consistency in the quality of engagement performance.
	 b.	Supervision responsibilities.
	
c.	Review responsibilities.
	6.	Monitoring: The firm should establish a monitoring process designed to provide it with reasonable assurance that 
the policies and procedures relating to the system of quality control are relevant, adequate, and operating effec­
tively (SQCS 8.52).
T A B L E  1 9 – 5

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
personnel to engagements, which affect policies and procedures developed to meet quality 
control objectives. It is important for a firm to develop a system of quality control that takes 
each of these elements into account and to ensure that members of the firm understand the 
firm’s quality control policies and procedures. While not required, communication of the 
firm’s quality control system normally should be in writing, with the extent of documentation 
varying with the size of the firm. A firm’s quality control policies and the Code of Profes­
sional Ethics should be covered in the firm’s training programs.
Table 19–6 provides some selected examples of the types of policies or procedures a firm 
might implement to comply with a sound system of quality control. The standards require 
that the firms continually monitor the appropriateness of the design and the effectiveness 
of the operation of their quality control system (SQCS 8.52). Firms should implement moni­
toring procedures to identify and communicate circumstances that may necessitate changes 
and improvements to the firm’s system of quality control. Procedures for monitoring include 
the following:
	
∙	 Review of records pertaining to the quality control elements
	
∙	 Review of engagement documentation, reports, and entity financial statements
	
∙	 Discussions with the firm’s personnel
	
∙	 Review of summarized reports, at least annually, on the findings of the monitoring 
procedures and the investigation of their causes so that improvements can be made
Selected Quality Control Policies and Procedures
Leadership Responsibilities for Quality within the Firm
 • Assign management responsibilities so that commercial considerations do not override the quality of the work per­
formed (SQCS 8. A5a).
 • Provide sufficient and appropriate resources for the development, documentation, and support of the firm’s quality 
control policies and procedures (SQCS 8.A5b).
Relevant Ethical Requirements
 • Communicate the firm’s independence requirements to its personnel and, when applicable, others subject to them 
(SQCS 8.22a).
 • Require personnel to promptly notify the firm of circumstances and relationships that create a threat to indepen­
dence so that appropriate action can be taken (SQCS 8.23b).
Acceptance and Continuance of Client Relationships and Specific Engagements
 • Require the firm to obtain such information as it considers necessary in the circumstances before accepting an 
engagement with a new client, when deciding whether to continue an existing engagement, and when considering 
acceptance of a new engagement with an existing client (SQCS 8.28a).
 • Establish policies and procedures that provide for obtaining an understanding with the client regarding the nature, 
scope, and limitations of the services to be performed (SQCS 8.29).
Human Resources
 • Ensure that the engagement partner has the appropriate competence, capabilities, and authority to perform his 
role (SQCS 8.33b).
 • Establish policies and procedures to assign appropriate personnel with the necessary competence and capabilities 
to perform engagements in accordance with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory require­
ments (SQCS 8.34a).
Engagement Performance
 • Establish policies and procedures setting out the nature, timing, and extent of an engagement quality control 
review. Such policies and procedures should require that the engagement quality control review be completed 
before the report is released (SQCS 8.40).
 • Establish policies and procedures for addressing and resolving differences of opinion within the engagement team; 
with those consulted; and, when applicable, between the engagement partner and the engagement quality control 
reviewer (SQCS 8.46).
Monitoring
 • Communicate to relevant engagement partners, and other appropriate personnel, deficiencies noted as a result of 
the monitoring process and recommendations for appropriate remedial action (SQCS 8.55).
 • Establish policies and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that complaints and allegations that 
the work performed by the firm fails to comply with professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory 
requirements and allegations of noncompliance with the firm’s system of quality control are appropriately dealt 
with (SQCS 8.60a-b).

∙	 Determination of any corrective actions to be taken or improvements to be made 
in the system, including providing feedback into the firm’s policies and procedures 
relating to education and training
	
∙	 Communication of findings to appropriate firm management
	
∙	 Follow-up on a timely basis by appropriate firm management and determination of 
what actions are necessary, including modifications to the quality control system 
(SQCS 8.A64)
The AICPA requires member firms to have their practices reviewed by peer firms every 
three-and-a-half years.
PCAOB Inspections of Registered Public Accounting Firms
In addition to the AICPA peer review programs discussed above, the PCAOB conducts regu­
lar inspections of public accounting firms that are required to register with the Board. These 
inspections focus on selected audit and quarterly review engagements and evaluate the suffi­
ciency of the quality control system of registered firms. The purpose of these inspections is to 
ensure that registered firms, in connection with their audits of public companies, comply with 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, PCAOB rules, SEC rules, and professional standards.
The PCAOB conducts special inspections on an ad hoc basis when it has specific cause, 
but the frequency with which regular inspections are conducted is established by law. Regis­
tered firms that issue more than 100 audit reports for public companies per year are subject 
to an annual inspection, while those firms that regularly issue more than 1 but less than 100 
audit reports in a year must be inspected at least once every three years.
Should a PCAOB inspection find that a firm, or anyone associated with it, may be in vio­
lation of legislation, accounting regulations, any professional standard, or even the firm’s own 
quality control policies, the PCAOB can conduct a special investigation into the possible vio­
lation. Following an investigation, the Board issues a draft report, at which time the firm has 
30 days to respond to any allegations. At the end of this period, the Board then issues a final 
report outlining the violations; however, assuming such violations do not involve fraud, the 
firm is granted a 12-month period in which to take necessary corrective action. If sufficient 
action is taken, the PCAOB does not publicly reveal the specifics of the firm’s violations—
otherwise, public disciplinary action ensues against responsible parties.
Mandatory inspections apply to all firms that audit public U.S. companies. However, if 
the accounting firm is not based in the United States, there may be some exceptions to the 
inspection requirements. For instance, at the PCAOB’s discretion, the Board may rely (at least 
in part) on foreign authorities to conduct inspections.

Ethics. A system or code of conduct based on moral duties and obligations that indicates how 
an individual should behave.
Financial interest. An ownership interest in an equity or a debt security issued by an entity,

is a financial interest that is beneficially owned through an investment vehicle, estate, trust, or 
other intermediary when the beneficiary does not control the intermediary or have authority 
to supervise or participate in the intermediary’s investment decisions.
Generally accepted auditing standards. Measures of the quality of the auditor’s performance.
Holding out. In general, any action initiated by a member that informs others of his or her 
status as a CPA or AICPA-accredited specialist constitutes holding out as a CPA. This would 
include, for example, use of the CPA designation on business cards or letterhead, or listing as 
a CPA in local telephone directories.

Key position. A position in which an individual

operating officer, general counsel, chief accounting officer, controller, director of 
internal audit, director of financial reporting, treasurer, or any equivalent position.
For purposes of attest engagements not involving an entity’s financial statements, a key posi­
tion is one in which an individual is primarily responsible for, or able to influence, the subject 
matter of the attest engagement, as described above.
Period of the professional engagement. The period for which a member either signs an ini­
tial engagement letter or other agreement to perform attest services or begins to perform an

the professional relationship and ends with the formal or informal notification, either by the 
member or the entity, of the termination of the professional relationship or by the issuance of 
a report, whichever is later. Accordingly, the period does not end with the issuance of a report 
and recommence with the beginning of the following year’s attest engagement.

firm, while holding out as CPA(s), of the professional services of accounting, tax, personal 
financial planning, litigation support services, and those professional services for which stan­

professional person.

LO 19-6	
19-27	 Dean Wareham, an audit manager, is preparing a proposal for a publicly held com­
pany in the manufacturing industry. The potential client is growing rapidly and 
introducing many new products yet still has a manual accounting system. The com­
pany also has never undertaken any tax planning activities and feels that it pays 
a higher percentage of its income in taxes than its competitors. Additionally, it is 
concerned that its monitoring activities are inadequate because it does not have an 
internal audit department. Dean knows that the SEC has rules regarding auditor 
independence.
Required:
	
1.	 Prepare a summary of nonaudit services that Dean can include in his proposal 
that do not violate the SEC’s independence rules.
	
2.	 How would your answer to requirement 1 differ if the potential client were not 
publicly held? In other words, what additional nonaudit services could Dean 
include in his proposal? What conditions would have to be met in order for the 
firm to provide the additional services?
	
LO 19-5, 19-6

involvement with the engagement, such as consulting on accounting or auditing issues, is the firm’s 
independence impaired?
c.  A CPA’s father acquired a 10 percent interest in his son’s audit entity. The investment is material to 
the father’s net worth. If the son is aware of his father’s investment and the CPA participates in the 
audit engagement, is the firm’s independence impaired?

DISCUSSION CASES
	
LO 19-2, 19-5, 19-6	
19-32	 Refer back to the hypothetical Sun City Savings and Loan case presented in this 
chapter, and consider each of the following independent situations:
	
a.	 Suppose that Pina, Johnson & Associates also audited one of the entities who had 
received one of the large loans that are in dispute. Sam Johnson is not involved 
with auditing that entity. Is it ethical for Johnson to seek information on the finan­
cial condition of that entity from the auditors in his firm? What are the rights of 
the affected parties in this instance, and what are the costs and benefits of using 
such information?
	
b.	 Suppose that Johnson has determined that one of the entities that owes a disputed 
loan is being investigated for violating environmental laws and may be sued to the 
point of bankruptcy by the Environmental Protection Agency. Can Johnson use 
this information in deciding on the proper loan-loss reserve? What are the ethical 
considerations?

he worked on the Swiss Precision Tooling audit team. Crowther & Sutherland is 
still the auditor for Swiss Precision Tooling.
	
b.	 Susana Millar finished working for Bircham, Dyson & Bell in August 2014. Dur­
ing that time, she was a concurring partner on the Unigate Dairies assignment 
(the engagement period on this audit ended in April 2015). In February 2016, 
Susana took up a position as controller of Unigate Dairies. Bircham, Dyson & 
Bell is still the dairy’s auditor and plans to finish its current audit assignment in 
March 2016 (19 months after Susana left the firm).

c.	 Janay Butler, a senior auditor, is aware that under SEC rules her accounting 
firm should not conduct appraisal or valuation services for a public company 
audit entity. However, her manager has requested that she appraise some spe­
cific large inventory items to verify a public entity’s estimates, which are relied 
upon by others.

billed the following to Halifax: audit fees $0.8 million, tax fees $2.3 million, 
and other fees $5.2 million. No services prohibited by the SEC were provided 
by Heath to Halifax, and the fee figures are appropriately disclosed in Halifax’s 
financial statements.

n Chapter 1 we presented an economic view of auditing, and we provided a 
house inspector analogy to illustrate the concepts. The auditor (or inspec­
tor) adds value to the principal–agent relationship by providing an objective, 
independent opinion on the quality of the information reported. However, what 
prevents the auditor from “looking the other way” or even from cooperating 
with management and issuing an unqualified report on financial statements 
that are materially misstated? The main deterrent, other than the individual’s 
ethical and professional principles, is the threat of legal liability. If a client or 
third party suffers a loss from such fraudulent behavior, the auditor’s personal 
wealth and professional reputation will be affected by litigation.
This chapter discusses auditors’ legal liability. The chapter starts by pre­
senting an overview of legal liability that includes the stages of the auditor 
dispute process and briefly discusses the types of legal liability an auditor may 
encounter. Auditors’ liability under common law to clients and third parties is 
discussed first, followed by a discussion of statutory liability for both civil and 
criminal complaints.

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Auditors can be held legally liable for actions that represent failure to perform professional 
services adequately. In this chapter we discuss the types of claims that can be brought 
against auditors, the types of plaintiffs that typically sue auditors, what must be proved to 
sue auditors successfully, and the defenses available to the auditor. Before discussing the 
details of the various legal theories, we provide a brief historical perspective and broad 
overview.
Historical Perspective
Although auditors have always been liable to clients and certain third parties, claims against 
auditors were relatively uncommon before the 1970s. In fact, the number of claims against 
auditors in the past 25 years is nearly double the number of all claims previously brought.1 
Not only did the number of claims rise, but their severity also increased. Following economic 
downturns and increased business failures, the number of lawsuits filed against auditors typi­
cally rises. For example, the recession in the early 1990s led to an upsurge in litigation culmi­
nating with a settlement related to savings and loan audits against Ernst & Young in excess of 
$400 million.
While some of the lawsuits brought against auditors were certainly legitimate, the 
1980s and 1990s also found the profession expending enormous time and effort defend­
ing against weak claims. During this time, it took large firms an average of three years 
and over $3 million to defend against a single weak claim under federal securities laws. 
“Practice protection costs” (e.g., litigation costs and the cost of professional liability insur­
ance) soared and quickly became the second largest cost to public accounting firms behind 
the cost of human resources. The profession pushed for reform, and in the 1990s Congress 
passed litigation reform acts that provided some limits to auditor liability and made it more 
difficult to successfully sue auditors. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act) and the The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 
(Dodd-Frank Act) refocused attention on auditor performance, duties, and legal liability 
after the capital markets were shaken by accounting frauds and an accounting crisis. While 
additional litigation will certainly follow, legal experts have noted that the number of large 
shareholder lawsuits against auditors has been declining in recent years. Experts attribute 
the recent decline in large shareholder claims against auditors to a legal case you will read 
about later in the chapter (i.e., Stoneridge Investment v. Scientific-Atlanta) and suggest 
it may also be due to the effect of regulation focused on improving audit and financial 
reporting quality, such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Time will tell if the declining trend 
will continue.
The monetary size of the legal claims against auditors combined with the small number 
of large audit firms has made it difficult or impossible for the largest audit firms to obtain 
sufficient liability insurance. The largest audit firms are basically self-insured for small and 
large claims (e.g., less than $10 million and more than $100 million). It is generally believed 
that the single greatest threat to large firms and the audit profession is catastrophic legal 
liability. The collapse of Arthur Andersen illustrated how severe the lack of available audit 
services would be if another big firm collapsed. For this reason, some European countries 
have established caps that limit auditor liability. While such caps have been discussed in 
the United States, it seems unlikely that legislation capping liability will be forthcoming in 
the near future.
1Approximately 4,000 claims are currently being asserted against accounting firms in the United States each 
year, whereas in the late 1960s the number of such claims did not exceed a few hundred per year. See Goldwasser 
and Arnold, Accountants’ Liability (Practising Law Institute, 2014), for additional information on the magnitude  
and severity of claims.
Introduction

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
675
Overview of Auditor Legal Liability
There are four general stages in the initiation and disposition of audit-related disputes: (1) the 
occurrence of events that result in losses for users of the financial statements, (2) the investi­
gation by plaintiff attorneys before filing suit to link the user losses with allegations of mate­
rial omissions or misstatements of financial statements, (3) the legal process that commences 
with the filing of the suit, and (4) the final resolution of the dispute.2 The first stage includes 
events that result in losses, such as client bankruptcy, financial distress, fraudulent financial 
reporting, and misappropriation of assets. The second stage, pre-suit investigation, may 
involve investigation activities by plaintiffs and their attorneys before initiating legal proceed­
ings. For example, a board of directors may hire a public accounting firm other than their 
external auditors to investigate potential fraud. The legal process makes up the third stage 
involving activities such as filing of complaints, discovery, trial preparation, and the trial. The 
last stage involves the resolution of the dispute, which may include a summary judgment, a 
settlement to avoid or discontinue litigation, or a court decision on appeal after a trial.
Auditors can be sued by clients, investors, creditors, and the government for failure to 
perform professional services with due professional care. Auditors can be held liable under 
two broad categories of law:
	
1.	 Common law. Case law developed over time by judges who issue legal opinions 
when deciding a case (the legal principles announced in these cases become 
precedent for judges deciding similar cases in the future).
	
2.	 Statutory law. Written law enacted by the legislative branch of federal and state 
governments.
It is important to understand the differences between these two legal categories. 
Table 20–1 defines key legal terms, and Table 20–2 summarizes the auditor’s liability by 
category of law and actions resulting in liability.
Under common law, auditors can be held civilly, but not criminally, liable. Typical civil 
actions under common law allege that the auditor did not properly perform the audit. For 
example, under common law, an auditor can be held liable to clients for breach of contract,

The Costs of Litigation: The following list provides the amounts of some of the larger audit-related 
lawsuits for the Big 4:
Audit-related litigation can be very expensive, but auditors do not have a monopoly on expensive 
litigation. Tax-related litigation is actually more frequent, and while many tax claims are for relatively 
small amounts, tax-related settlements can be very large. For example, in 2005, KPMG LLP settled 
a lawsuit with the U.S. Justice Department for $456 million for selling aggressive and improper tax 
shelters that helped wealthy Americans avoid taxes. In a related case with purchasers of the tax 
shelters, KPMG also agreed to pay $123 million.

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Definitions of Key Legal Terms
Breach of contract
Occurs when the client or auditor fails to meet the terms and obligations established in the contract (either expressly or 
implied), which is normally finalized in the engagement letter. Third parties may have privity or near privity of contract.
Civil law
All law that does not relate to criminal matters.
Class action
Lawsuit filed by one or more individuals on behalf of all persons who may have invested on the basis of the same false and 
misleading information.
Criminal law
Statutory law that defines the duties citizens owe to society and prescribes penalties for violations.
Fraud
Actions taken with the knowledge and intent to deceive.
Gross negligence
An extreme, flagrant, or reckless departure from professional standards of due care. This is also referred to as constructive 
fraud.
Ordinary negligence
An absence of reasonable or due care in the conduct of an engagement. Due care is evaluated in terms of what other profes­
sional accountants would have done under similar circumstances.
Privity
A contract or specific agreement exists between two parties. Absent a contractual or fiduciary relationship, the accountant 
does not owe a duty of care to an injured party.
Scienter
Acting with intent to deceive, defraud, or with knowledge of a false representation.
Tort
A wrongful act, other than a breach of contract, for which civil action may be taken.

negligence, gross negligence, and fraud. The auditor’s liability to third parties (e.g., investors 
and creditors) under common law is complicated by the fact that legal precedent differs by 
jurisdiction. In other words, the law applicable to a common-law case depends on the location 
where the case is tried (i.e., state by state). Some jurisdictions follow a common-law doctrine 
that provides a very narrow interpretation of auditors’ liability to third parties, while others 
follow a more liberal interpretation. Most common-law cases are decided in state courts, but 
there are circumstances where common-law cases can be decided in federal court (for exam­
ple, a negligence claim may be brought in federal court where parties are from different states 
and the amount of damages being sought exceeds $75,000).
Under statutory law an auditor can be held civilly or criminally liable. A civil claim can 
result in fines and sanctions but not incarceration. While there are federal and state statutes, in 
this text we focus only on federal statutes. Federal statutes such as the Securities Act of 1933, 
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank Acts (and 
related SEC rulings) provide the legal basis for action against auditors. Auditors are liable 
mainly for gross negligence and fraud under these statutes; however, some parts of the acts 
have been used to hold auditors liable for ordinary negligence. While under certain circum­
stances an auditor can be held criminally liable under statutory law, there have been relatively 
few instances of major criminal actions against auditors.

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
677
The remainder of the chapter is organized according to the four categories of liability 
faced by auditors outlined in Table 20–2:
	
∙	 Common law—liability to clients.
	
∙	 Common law—liability to third parties.
	
∙	 Federal statutory law—civil liability (clients and third parties).
	
∙	 Federal statutory law—criminal liability (government).
Common Law—Clients
Common law does not require that the public accountant guarantee his or her work product. 
It does, however, require that the auditor perform professional services with due care. Due 
care or due professional care requires the auditor to perform his or her professional services 
with the same degree of skill, knowledge, and judgment possessed by other members of the 
profession. This includes, but is not limited to, an expectation that auditors will perform an 
audit in conformance with GAAS or relevant professional auditing standards, and that the 
audited financial statements will comply with GAAP. When an auditor fails to carry out con­
tractual arrangements with the client, he or she may be held liable for breach of contract or 
negligence. The auditor can also be held liable to the client for gross negligence and fraud.
Breach of Contract—Client Claims
A breach of contract occurs when the client fails to complete its obligation or when the audi­
tor fails to complete the services agreed to in the contract. As discussed in Chapter 3, an 
engagement letter should establish the responsibilities for both the auditor and the client. In 
performing an audit, the auditor’s obligation is to examine the entity’s financial statements 
and issue the appropriate opinion in accordance with professional standards. The contract 
between the client and the auditor stipulates the amount of fees to be charged for the desig­
nated professional services, and deadlines for completing the services are normally indicated 
or implied in the contract. If the client breaches its obligations under the engagement letter, 
the auditor is excused from his or her contractual obligations. If the auditor discontinues an 
audit without adequate cause, he or she may be liable for economic injury suffered by the 
client (Exhibit 20–1). Similarly, other issues (such as timely delivery of the audit report or 
failure to detect a material defalcation) can lead to litigation by the client against the auditor. 
When the auditor is found to have breached the contract, the auditor is only liable for damages 
caused by the breach.
Negligence—Client Claims
A tort is a wrongful act, other than a breach of contract, for which civil action may be taken. 
If an engagement is performed without due care, the public accountant may be held liable for 
an actionable tort in negligence. The auditor typically faces larger legal damage assessments 
for a tort than for a breach of contract. Liability for negligence represents a deviation from a 
standard of behavior that is consistent with that of a “reasonable person.” When an individual 
such as a public accountant possesses special skills and knowledge, ordinary reasonable care 
is not sufficient. An oft-cited quote from Cooley’s Torts3 indicates the responsibility of those 
offering special skills:
In all those employments where particular skill is requisite, if one offers his services, he is under­
stood as holding himself out to the public as possessing the degree of skill commonly possessed by 
others in the same employment, and if his pretensions are unfounded, he commits a species of fraud 
upon every man who employs him in reliance on his public profession. But no man, whether skilled 
or unskilled, undertakes that the task he assumes shall be performed successfully, and without fault

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
or error; he undertakes for good faith and integrity, but not for infallibility, and he is liable to his 
employer for negligence, bad faith, or dishonesty, but not for losses consequent upon mere errors 
of judgment.
Thus, a CPA has the duty to conduct an engagement using the same degree of care that 
would be used by an ordinary, prudent member of the public accounting profession.
To recover against an auditor in a negligence case, the client must prove the following:
	
1.	 The auditor had a duty to the client to conform to a required standard of care.
	
2.	 The auditor breached that duty by failing to act with due professional care.
	
3.	 There was a direct causal connection between the auditor’s negligence and the 
client’s damage.
	
4.	 The client suffered actual losses or damages as a result.
Negligence suits by clients against auditors often allege that the auditor was negligent 
in not detecting a misstatement or fraud. Auditors’ defenses against client negligence claims 
include the following:
	
1.	 No duty was owed.
	
2.	 The client was negligent (contributory negligence, comparative negligence, or 
management fraud).
	
3.	 The auditor’s work was performed in accordance with professional standards.
	
4.	 The client suffered no loss.
	
5.	 The alleged auditor negligence did not substantially contribute to the client’s loss 
(lack of causal connection).
	
6.	 The claim is invalid because the statute of limitations has expired.4
4Statute limitations for negligence claims vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction with a range of 1 to 6 years. The 
statute in most jurisdictions is 3 years or less. The statutes do not restrict auditor liability for fraud. A statute of limita-
tions prescribes the period of time where certain kinds of legal actions can be brought to the courts. 
Deloitte’s Withdrawal from Medtrans Audit Upheld
Medtrans, an ambulance service provider, retained Deloitte to audit its financial statements. Medtrans 
needed capital and sought $10 million in financing from an outside investor. Medtrans gave the potential 
investor unaudited financial statements showing profits of $1.9 million. Deloitte was in the process of com­
pleting its audit during Medtrans’ negotiations with the outside investor. Deloitte proposed adjustments 
that resulted in Medtrans’ financial statements showing a $500,000 loss. Prior to Deloitte proposing the 
adjustments, the company’s CFO resigned after indicating that he could not sign the management repre­
sentation letter. When presented with the proposed adjustments, Medtrans’ CEO threatened to get a court 
order forcing Deloitte to complete the audit. Deloitte withdrew from the engagement. Medtrans retained 
two other CPA firms, both of which were either discharged or withdrew. A third firm issued an unqualified 
audit report that contained the adjustments proposed by Deloitte.
Medtrans alleged that Deloitte’s wrongful withdrawal resulted in the company’s failure to complete 
the financing, and that the subsequent sale of the company was for significantly less than its true value. 
At trial Medtrans asserted that, under California law, a CPA firm could not, under any circumstances, with­
draw from an engagement if it unduly jeopardized the interest of the client. The jury in this case ruled in 
favor of Medtrans and awarded the company nearly $10 million. Deloitte argued that the approved Cali­
fornia jury instructions on the duration of a professional’s duty were contrary to professional standards, 
which authorize the auditor to resign.
In 1998 the California Court of Appeals reversed the decision, holding that judges should instruct 
juries about the profession’s standards. The court held that an auditor, by auditing financial statements, 
assumes a public responsibility that transcends any employment relationship with the client. This decision 
is significant because it held that an accountant’s duty of care can be based on professional standards 
rather than rules of law that are contrary to professional standards.

The client can typically prove the existence of a duty of care based on the engagement 
contract. However, the auditor may be able to argue successfully that the client’s loss was 
due to the client’s negligence. Some states permit a defense of contributory negligence or 
in pari delicto (in equal fault) as a complete bar to recovery by a client. A recent case 
where the auditor successfully used the in pari delicto defense, Allegheny Health v. Price­
waterhouseCoopers, is discussed in Connect. However, most states follow the view of 
comparative negligence because it is not as harsh as an all-or-nothing approach. Under the 
comparative negligence view, the jury is permitted to assess the relative fault of the parties. 
For example, if an entity’s system of internal control is deficient because the client failed 
to provide adequate training or personnel, any recovery by the entity against the auditor 
is reduced in proportion to the fault of the client. When top management of the client has 
engaged in fraud, the auditor may be able to attribute the fraud to management and prevent 
recovery for a negligently performed audit. This defense has been used successfully by audi­
tors, including in the well-known Cenco, Inc. v. Seidman & Seidman case involving such 
circumstances. Exhibit 20–2 presents a summary of the Cenco case. In this instance, new 
management at the audit client alleged that Seidman & Seidman was negligent for not hav­
ing uncovered the prior management’s fraudulent actions. The court ruled that, considering 
management’s involvement in the fraud, the CPA firm had not been negligent.
Another well-known case that alleged the accountant was negligent is 1136 Tenants v. 
Rothenberg, which relates to unaudited financial statements and the CPA’s failure to com­
municate suspicious circumstances to the client. Exhibit 20–3 presents a summary of the 
case. The 1136 Tenants case established a duty on the part of a CPA doing work on unau­
dited financial statements to communicate to the client any circumstances that give reason to 
believe that fraud may exist. One outcome of this case was the establishment of Statements 
on Standards for Accounting and Review Services, which prescribe procedures that CPAs 
should follow when performing engagements such as compilations and reviews (discussed 
in Chapter 21).
Fraud—Client Claims
An auditor can be held liable to clients for fraud when he or she acted with knowledge and 
intent to deceive. Generally, however, actions alleging fraud on the part of the auditor result 
from lawsuits by third parties and thus are discussed in more detail in the next section.
The Cenco Case
For a number of years, management of Cenco, Inc., engaged in a massive fraud. The fraud began in the 
company’s Medical/Health Division and eventually spread to Cenco’s top management. By the time the 
fraud was made public, even the chairman and president were involved in the fraud. Seidman & Seidman 
was Cenco’s auditor throughout the period of the fraud.
The fraud involved primarily the inflating of inventories in the Medical/Health Division above their fair 
market value to increase its stock price. Thus, the fraud did not involve stealing from the company. Rather, 
the fraudsters had devised ways to steal from outsiders (e.g., creditors and insurers) to the benefit of 
existing shareholders.
Cenco’s new management filed breach-of-contract, negligence, and fraud claims against Seidman & 
Seidman, and a trial date was set. One day before the start of the trial, Seidman & Seidman offered to pay 
$3.5 million to settle the class action suit, but Cenco turned the offer down. Prior to submitting the case to 
the jury, the trial judge granted a directed verdict in favor of Seidman & Seidman on the claim that the CPA 
firm had aided and abetted the fraud. The case went to the jury on the three remaining counts of breach of 
contract, negligence, and fraud. The jury found that Seidman & Seidman was innocent on all counts. The 
verdict was appealed by Cenco. The U.S. Court of Appeals upheld the lower court and found that Seidman 
& Seidman had not been responsible for any liability for breach of contract, negligence, or fraud. The court 
held that the auditors of a corporation could use the fraud of corporate managers as a defense to claims 
against the auditor by the corporation.

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Under common law, auditors can be held liable to third parties for negligence, gross negli­
gence, and fraud. This area of liability is very complex, and court rulings are not always con­
sistent across state and federal judicial jurisdictions. As mentioned earlier, most common-law 
claims are decided in state courts.
Ordinary Negligence—Third-Party Claims
When an auditor fails to conduct an engagement with due care, he or she can, in some situa­
tions, be held liable for ordinary negligence to third parties (plaintiffs) under common law. To 
prevail in a suit alleging negligence, the third party must prove all of the following:
	
1.	 The auditor had a duty to the plaintiff to exercise due care.
	
2.	 The auditor breached that duty by failing to act with due professional care.
	
3.	 There was a direct causal connection between the auditor’s negligence and the third 
party’s injury (e.g., the financial statements were misleading and the third party 
relied on the financial statements).
	
4.	 The third party suffered an actual loss as a result.
The main difficulty faced by third parties in proving negligence against an auditor 
is showing that the auditor’s duty to exercise due care extended to them. Over time, four 
common-law standards have evolved for determining the types of third parties that can suc­
cessfully sue auditors for ordinary negligence. The four legal standards are privity, near priv­
ity, foreseen third parties (or Restatement Standard), and reasonably foreseeable third parties. 
The doctrine that will be applied in deciding a case depends on the precedents established in 
the state where the case is decided.

The 1136 Tenants Case
Jerome Riker was a powerful New York City businessman with extensive business interests in the real 
estate industry in the 1960s. Riker diverted money from a number of trust funds of cooperatives that he 
managed for use in a personal real estate investment.
One of the cooperatives that was involved in the embezzlement was the 1136 Tenants’ Corporation. 
Riker had misappropriated approximately $130,000 of the cooperative’s funds. When the cooperative 
was unable to recover the funds from Riker, it filed a civil suit against the public accounting firm, Max 
Rothenberg & Company, which had prepared the annual financial statements and tax return. The plaintiffs 
alleged that the accounting firm should have discovered the embezzlement of funds by Riker.
One issue that arose during the trial was the contractual agreement between the public accounting firm 
and the 1136 Tenants’ Corporation. There was no written engagement letter, only an oral agreement between 
one of the firm’s partners and Riker. The cooperative alleged that the firm had been retained to do an audit, 
while the firm alleged that it had been retained only to prepare the tax return and perform “write-up” ser­
vices. Another issue was the fact that the firm had identified some missing invoices and had not investigated 
these items further. The workpapers detailed $44,000 of expenses for which no supporting documentation 
could be located. These were fictitious expenses used by Riker to extract funds from the cooperative.
The court ruled that even if the firm had agreed to provide only write-up services, it had an obligation 
to notify the tenants about the suspicious nature of the missing invoices. Damaging to the firm’s defense 
was the admission by one of its partners that the engagement had been more extensive than that called 
for by a normal write-up engagement. The income statement also included an expense labeled “audit.” 
The court ruled in favor of the tenants and awarded them damages of more than $230,000. The decision 
was upheld upon appeal by the New York appellate court. The size of the judgment was far in excess of 
the fee of $600 paid to the firm.
This court decision resulted in two significant changes in the profession:
 • It reinforced the need by firms to have written engagement letters.
 • It led to the issuance by the AICPA of Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services.

Common Law—Third Parties

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
681
Privity  The most restrictive view under common law is that auditors have no liability for 
ordinary negligence to third parties who do not have a privity relationship with the auditor. 
Privity means that a contract or specific agreement exists between two parties. Third par­
ties to a contract between an auditor and a client, such as investors or creditors of the client, 
typically lack privity because they were not directly involved in the agreement between the 
auditor and the client and thus cannot successfully sue the auditor, even if the auditor was 
negligent. The landmark decision in this area, Ultramares v. Touche, held that the auditor was 
not liable to third parties who relied on a negligently prepared audit report. Exhibit 20–4 pro­
vides a summary of the Ultramares case. The rationale for this finding by the New York Court 
of Appeals is summarized in a famous quote by Judge Benjamin Cardozo:
If a liability for negligence exists, a thoughtless slip or blunder, the failure to detect a theft or forg­
ery beneath the cover of deceptive entries, may expose accountants to a liability in an indeterminate 
amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class. The hazards of a business on these 
terms are so extreme as to enkindle doubt whether a flaw may not exist in the implication of a duty 
that exposes to these circumstances.
Thus the Ultramare doctrine is based on the premise that the potential liability of accoun­
tants should be restricted in cases of ordinary negligence. States that have more recently fol­
lowed the strict privity or Ultramares doctrine include Pennsylvania and Nevada.
Stop and Think: If a third-party plaintiff is in Pennsylvania and it determined to not 
have a privity relationship with the auditor, under what conditions might they be able to 
successfully sue an auditor under common law?
The privity requirement under the Ultramares doctrine does not apply when the auditor 
is charged with fraud. Furthermore, while Judge Cardozo followed a strict privity doctrine 
in the Ultramares case, he opened the door for third parties without privity to sue if the neg­
ligence was so great as to constitute gross negligence, also known as constructive fraud. In 
other words, in a jurisdiction that follows the Utramares doctrine, plaintiffs can successfully 
The Ultramares Case
Fred Stern & Company imported and sold rubber during the 1920s. This industry required extensive 
working capital, and the company used borrowings from banks for its financing activities. In 1924 Stern 
requested a $100,000 loan from Ultramares Corporation. Before deciding to make the loan, Ultramares 
requested that Stern provide an audited balance sheet. Touche, Niven & Company had just issued an 
unqualified audit report on the December 31, 1923, balance sheet.
Stern’s management asked Touche to provide 32 serially numbered copies of the audit report. Touche 
had audited Stern for three years and knew that the audit reports were being used by Stern to obtain 
external debt financing. Touche, however, did not know which specific banks or finance companies would 
be given the reports. The balance sheet showed assets of $2.5 million. Ultramares provided the $100,000 
loan and additional loans totaling $65,000. In addition, Stern obtained bank loans of approximately 
$300,000 by providing the December 31, 1923, balance sheet audited by Touche.
In 1925 the company declared bankruptcy. It came to light during the trial that Stern had already been 
bankrupt in 1923 and that false accounting record entries had concealed the company’s problems. Ultra­
mares alleged that Touche had been both negligent and fraudulent in its audit of Stern.
The jury in the case dismissed the fraud charges against Touche but ruled that Touche had been neg­
ligent and awarded approximately $186,000 in damages. The trial judge overturned the jury’s verdict on 
the grounds that Ultramares had not been in privity with Touche. The appellate division of the New York 
Supreme Court voted 3 to 2 in favor of Ultramares, ruling that the judge had inappropriately overruled the 
jury verdict. Touche’s attorneys appealed the decision to the court of appeals, which ruled unanimously in 
favor of Touche, therefore upholding the privity doctrine. The quote included in the text by Judge Cardozo, 
the chief justice of the court of appeals, summarizes the decision.

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
sue auditors even if they do not have privity so long as the plaintiff can prove the auditors 
were guilty of gross negligence or fraud.
Near Privity  While the Ultramares decision established a strict privity standard, a number 
of subsequent court decisions in other states have moved away from this standard over time. 
In 1985 the New York Court of Appeals expanded the privity standard in the case of Credit 
Alliance v. Arthur Andersen to include third parties whose relationship with the accountant 
approaches privity. In this lawsuit, Credit Alliance alleged that the auditor had known that the 
plaintiff was the client’s principal lender and had frequently communicated with the plaintiff 
regarding the audited financial statements. The court upheld the lender’s claim that Arthur 
Andersen had known that Credit Alliance was relying on the financial statements prior to 
extending credit. The court also ruled that there had been direct communication between the 
lender and the auditor regarding the client. The Credit Alliance case lists the following tests 
that must be satisfied for holding auditors liable for ordinary negligence to third parties: (1) the 
accountant must be aware that the financial statements are to be used for a particular purpose 
or purposes, (2) in the furtherance of which a known party or parties was intended to rely, and 
(3) there must have been some conduct on the part of the accountants linking them to that party 
or parties, which provides evidence of the accountants’ understanding of intended reliance.
In a 2010 case, the New York Supreme Court ruled in favor of the auditors because the 
plantiff’s evidence of near privity was based on one telephone call to the auditor, which the 
court ruled was insufficient “linking evidence” to establish near privity (Barrett v. Freifeld). 
In 2005, a court ruled that payment of some of the accountant’s fees by a third party for 
services provided to the client was not sufficient to establish near privity because there was 
no communication between the third party and the accountant (Carter v. Carlis). Based on 
these cases, it appears that a critical test is the third test, the requirement that the third party 
be known to the auditor and that the auditor has directly conveyed the audit report or acted to 
induce reliance on the audit report. Most third parties who are not in actual privity of contract 
with the auditors will not likely meet the demanding near privity standard, since the auditor 
will usually not have communicated directly with the plaintiff. States that have followed the 
near privity doctrine include Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, and New York.
It is important to remember that third-party plaintiffs in all jurisdictions are able to suc­
cessfully sue auditors for gross negligence or fraud, regardless of their privity status.
Foreseen Third-Party or Restatement Standard  The “middle ground” approach fol­
lowed by the vast majority of states (and federal courts located within those states) expands 
the class of third parties that can successfully sue an auditor for negligence beyond near priv­
ity to a person or limited group of persons whose reliance is actually foreseen, even if the 
specific person or group is unknown to the auditor. In essence, the courts in these jurisdictions 
have reexamined the notion of caveat emptor (“buyer beware”) and substituted the concept of 
public responsibility. Among the reasons that have been advanced by the courts for expanding 
the scope beyond near privity are (1) the increased liability of other professionals to nonpriv­
ity users of their services, (2) the lack of fairness of imposing the burden of economic loss 
on innocent financial statement users, (3) the assumption that expanded liability will cause 
auditors to improve their auditing procedures, (4) the ability of auditors to obtain insurance 
against the increased risks, and (5) the ability of the auditors to pass the increased audit costs 
and insurance premiums on to their clients. However, as discussed earlier, large firms may not 
be able to obtain adequate liability insurance.
In 1968 a federal district court decision, Rusch Factors. v. Levin, applied Section 552 of 
the Restatement (Second) of the Law of Torts to an accountant’s third-party liability suit. The 
case is described in Exhibit 20–5. In brief, a company engaged Levin to audit the financial 
statements for the purpose of obtaining financing from Rusch Factors. The statements por­
trayed the company as solvent. The plaintiff made a large loan to the company, which subse­
quently went bankrupt. The federal district court found the public accounting firm negligent, 
relying on Section 552 of the Restatement in reaching its decision.

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
683
The Restatement is a compendium of common law prepared by legal scholars and pres­
ents an alternative view to the traditional privity doctrine. Section 552 states the following:
One who, in the course of his business, profession, or employment . . . supplies false information 
for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss 
caused to them by their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he fails to exercise reasonable 
care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information.
The liability . . . is limited to loss suffered (a) by the person or one of the persons for whose benefit 
and guidance he intends to supply the information, or knows that the recipient intends to supply it; 
and (b) through reliance upon it in a transaction which he intends the information to influence, or 
knows that the recipient so intends. . . .
The liability of one who is under a public duty to give the information extends to loss suffered by 
any of the class of persons for whose benefit the duty is created, in any of the transactions in which 
it is intended to protect them.
The Restatement broadens the auditor’s liability beyond those with privity or near privity 
to a small group of persons and classes who are or should be foreseen by the auditor as relying 
on the financial information. However, because the language of the Restatement is general, 
it is subject to different interpretations. The following examples abstracted from the Restate­
ment help illustrate the possibilities for auditor liability.
The Rusch Factors Case
In this case, the plaintiff, Rusch Factors, Inc., had requested audited financial statements as a prerequisite 
for providing a loan to a Rhode Island corporation. Levin issued a clean audit opinion on the financial 
statements, indicating the company to be solvent when it was actually insolvent. Rusch Factors loaned the 
corporation $337,000 based on the audited financial statements. When the company went into receiver­
ship, Rusch Factors sued Levin for a loss of $121,000.
The federal district court, sitting in Rhode Island, denied Levin’s motion to dismiss for a lack of privity. 
In finding Levin liable for negligence, the court concluded that the Ultramares doctrine was inappropriate 
and relied heavily on the Restatement (Second) of the Law of Torts. The court stated that the auditor had 
known that his certification was to be used and relied upon by Rusch Factors, and therefore he could be 
held liable for financial misrepresentations relied upon by foreseen and limited classes of persons.

Example 1
Cornelius Manufacturing Co. is negotiating for a $1,000,000 loan from the First 
National Bank of Sun City. The bank requires that Cornelius Manufacturing provide 
audited financial statements. Cornelius engages the public accounting firm of Cantbe 
& Mustbe (C&M) to conduct the audit, informing them that the audit is for the express 
purpose of obtaining credit from the First National Bank of Sun City. C&M accepts 
the engagement with the understanding that the financial statements are for the bank’s 
use. The First National Bank of Sun City goes into bankruptcy, and Cornelius submits 
the audited financial statements to Waldo National Bank without communicating with 
C&M. Waldo National Bank lends Cornelius the $1,000,000. The financial statements 
materially overstate the financial resources of Cornelius, and Waldo National Bank suf­
fers a loss on the loan. In this example, the Restatement indicates that C&M is not liable 
to Waldo National Bank because Waldo was not a foreseen third party.
Example 2
The same facts apply as in Example 1, except that Cornelius says nothing to C&M 
about supplying the financial statements to the First National Bank of Sun City; Cor­
nelius merely tells C&M that the company expects to negotiate a bank loan and is 

684	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Subsequent to the Rusch Factors case, a number of state and federal courts have followed 
the approach outlined in the Restatement Standard to determine third parties eligible to sue 
auditors for ordinary negligence. To successfully apply the Restatement Standard or Rusch 
Factors doctrine, the auditor has to be provided with sufficient description of the proposed 
use of the financial statements. A 2008 case, Travelers v. Reznick, illustrates this point. Trav­
elers suffered a loss after issuing a performance bond, which is an insurance guarantee that 
a construction company will satisfactorily complete a construction project. Travelers sued 
the auditor for negligence because it had relied on the construction company’s audited finan­
cial statements, which were later determined to be misstated. The auditor had been told by 
the construction company that the financial statements would be used by third parties when 
deciding whether to “extend credit or otherwise accept liabilities.” However, the Georgia 
court dismissed the case because the description was too broad and did not provide the audi­
tors with specific knowledge that the audited financial statements would be used to support 
the issuance of performance bonds. Similarly, the courts have held that if a company fails 
subsequent to being acquired and the plan to acquire was unknown to the auditor, the acquir­
ing company is not considered to be a foreseen third party (e.g., Western SEC. Bank v. Eide 
Bailly, 2010).
Several cases (e.g., Loop Corp. v. McIlroy, 2004; Tocchet v. Cater, 2003) have dealt with 
the issue of whether purchasers of a company’s stock on the open market should be foreseen 
users and can hold auditors liable under Restatement Section 552. Plaintiffs argue that federal 
securities laws impose public duties upon auditors that should extend to Section 552. If courts 
agree with the plaintiffs’ arguments, then auditors would owe a duty under Section 552 to 
every shareholder and perhaps to all potential investors in a publicly held corporation. Essen­
tially, this would mean that all shareholders and potential shareholders could sue auditors for 
ordinary negligence under common law. Thus far, courts have ruled that Section 552 does not 
impose a public duty.
Reasonably Foreseeable Third Parties  The courts of three jurisdictions (Mississippi, 
New Jersey, and Wisconsin) have used a more expansive view of auditors’ liability to third 
parties: reasonably foreseeable third parties. In the precedent-setting case in this area, Rosen­
blum v. Adler, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that Touche Ross & Co. was responsible 
for damages incurred by all reasonably foreseeable third parties who had relied on the finan­
cial statements. Exhibit 20–6 provides more details on this case.5
Another important case that followed this approach was Citizens State Bank v. Timm, 
Schmidt & Co. (1983). In this case, the bank sued the public accounting firm after relying 
on financial statements for one of its debtors that had been audited by Timm, Schmidt & 
Company. The Wisconsin court extended the scope of third parties to include all reasonably 
5While the precedent set by the Rosenblum case in New Jersey has been followed by other states, subsequent legisla-
tion in New Jersey (1995) overturned Rosenblum and restricts auditor liability to the near privity standard. Recent 
court cases in New Jersey have upheld the near privity standard (e.g., Dickerson v. Ernst & Young, 2003).
considering going to the First National Bank of Sun City. In this instance, the Restate­
ment indicates that C&M would be liable to Waldo National Bank because Waldo was 
a foreseen third party.
Example 3
The same facts apply as in Example 2, except that Cornelius informs C&M that the 
company is planning on negotiating a bank loan without mentioning a specific bank. 
Again, under the Restatement, C&M would be liable to Waldo National Bank because 
Waldo was a foreseen third party.

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability

foreseeable users. The court used a number of the reasons just cited for extending auditors’ 
liability beyond privity. The following quote from this case demonstrates the court’s thoughts.
If relying third parties, such as creditors, are not allowed to recover, the cost of credit to the gen­
eral public will increase because creditors will either have to absorb the cost of bad loans made in 
reliance on faulty information or hire independent accountants to verify the information received. 
Accountants may spread the risk through the use of liability insurance.
A weakness in this argument is that the larger public accounting firms may not be able 
to secure sufficient liability insurance, or the cost of such insurance may be too costly to be 
affordable.
Since 1987 no state high court has adopted the foreseeability approach to accountant lia­
bility, while a large number have approved or adopted one of the narrower standards.6 For 
example, in Bily v. Arthur Young (1992) the California Supreme Court expressly rejected the 
foreseeability approach in favor of the Rusch Factors or Restatement Standard. The court gave 
a number of reasons for rejecting the Rosenblum foreseeablity approach, including that the 
foreseeability rule exposes auditors to potential liability in excess of their proportionate share 
and that sophisticated plaintiffs have other ways to protect themselves from the risk of inaccu­
rate financial statements (e.g., they can negotiate improved terms or hire their own auditor).
However, in Murphy v. BDO Seidman (2003), the California Court of Appeals ruled that 
“grapevine plaintiffs,” who alleged indirect reliance based on what others (e.g., stockhold­
ers and stockbrokers) told them about the financial statements, had legal claims for ordinary 
negligence against the auditors so long as the auditor would have reasonably foreseen that 
stockholders or stockbrokers would tell other people of the content of the financial statements 
and that the other people would rely upon the misrepresentations in purchasing the corporate 
stock. The court ruled that nothing in the Bily decision precludes indirect reliance.
Figure 20–1 illustrates the four legal doctrines just covered and how moving from left to 
right there is a broader class of third parties eligible to sue auditors for ordinary negligence 
under common law.
Stop and Think: Why do we still link the names of old cases with the different legal 
doctrines in Figure 20–1?
6See Chapter 4 in Goldwasser and Arnold, Accountants’ Liability (Practising Law Institute, 2014).
The Rosenblum Case
The Rosenblum family agreed to sell its retail catalog showroom business, H. Rosenblum, Inc., to Giant 
Stores in exchange for Giant common stock. The Rosenblums relied on Giant’s 1971 and 1972 finan­
cial statements, which had been audited by Touche Ross & Co. A year later, it was revealed that Giant 
Stores’ financial statements contained material misstatements. Giant Stores filed for bankruptcy, and 
the company’s stock became worthless. The Rosenblums sued Touche, alleging negligence. Touche did 
not know the Rosenblums and had not known that the financial statements would be relied on during 
merger negotiations.
The lower courts in this case did not allow the Rosenblums’ claims against Touche, on the grounds 
that the Rosenblums did not meet either the Ultramares privity test or the Restatement (Second) of the 
Law of Torts’ “foreseen third parties” test. The New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the lower courts’ 
decisions. The court held that the auditor had “a duty to all those whom the auditor should reasonably 
foresee as recipient from the company of the statements for its proper business purposes, provided that 
the recipients rely on the statements.” Thus the court concluded that auditors should be liable to all rea­
sonably foreseeable third parties who rely on the financial statements. The court indicated that the audi­
tor’s function had expanded from one of a watchdog for management to that of an independent evaluator 
of the adequacy and fairness of the financial statements presented by management to third parties. The 
court also cited the accountant’s ability to obtain insurance against third-party claims.

Because common law is built on case law, the precedent-setting cases are used to label 
the legal doctrines. If you are interested in reading a more recent actual court case that con­
siders these legal doctrines you can read about the Anjoorian vs. Pascarella & Trench case 
in Connect.
Auditor Defenses  The defenses presented earlier in this chapter under liability to clients 
are also available to auditors sued by third parties for ordinary negligence under common law. 
For example, a number of negligence suits against auditors have been successfully defended 
by demonstrating that the alleged negligence did not substantially contribute to the third-
party’s losses (lack of causal connection). An additional defense in the area of third-party 
negligence, depending on the jurisdiction, is for the auditor to argue that the third party does 
not qualify as a foreseen party or does not have near privity.
7Following the Parmalat fraud, there were law suits against Deloitte’s and Grant Thornton’s international umbrella 
firms related to the Parmalat audit conducted in Italy. A New York federal judge accepted the case under the legal 
doctrine of “agency theory,” as the affiliate firms could be considered agents of the umbrella organization if the 
umbrella organization can exert significant control over the auditing policies and practices of the affiliate firms. In 
2010 the case was transferred to an Illinois state court and in 2013 the Illinois court ruled in favor of Deloitte and 
Grant Thornton, who successfully used the in pari delicto (in equal fault) defense.

INSIGHT
While the large international audit firms market themselves as global firms with uniform practices and 
quality control standards in offices worldwide, these entities are legally formed as a network of affili­
ated firms (e.g., U.S. affiliate, Canadian affiliate, Japanese affiliate). To date, the courts have declined 
to find that an umbrella global audit entity is legally responsible for the misconduct of one of the 
affiliates in the network. However, the affiliate involved in the misconduct can be, and often is, held 
responsible. For example, as discussed later on in the chapter, Indian affiliate firms to Pricewater­
houseCoopers International Limited (the global entity) were sanctioned and fined by the PCAOB and 
SEC for not following auditing standards in the massive 2009 accounting fraud at Satyam Computer 
Services headquartered in New Delhi, India.7
Fraud and Gross Negligence—Third-Party Claims
If an auditor has acted with knowledge and intent to deceive a third party, he or she can be 
held liable for fraud. As noted earlier, common-law liability for fraud is available to any third 
parties in any jurisdiction. The plaintiff (third party) must prove
	
1.	 A false representation by the accountant.
	
2.	 Knowledge or belief by the accountant that the representation was false.

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
687
	
3.	 That the accountant intended to induce the third party to rely on false representation.
	
4.	 That the third party relied on the false representation.
	
5.	 That the third party suffered damages.
Courts have held that fraudulent intent or scienter may be established by proof that the 
accountant acted with knowledge of the false representation.
However, liability for fraud is not limited only to cases where the auditor was knowingly 
deceitful. Some courts have interpreted gross negligence as an instance of fraud (also referred 
to as constructive fraud). Gross negligence is defined to be an extreme, flagrant, or reckless 
deviation from professional standards of due care. An important case in this area is State 
Street Trust v. Ernst. In this case, the auditors issued an unqualified opinion on their client’s 
financial statements, knowing that State Street Trust Company was making a loan based on 
those financial statements. A month later, the auditors sent a letter to management of the 
client indicating that receivables had been overstated. The auditors, however, did not com­
municate this information to State Street Trust Company, and the client subsequently went 
bankrupt. The New York court ruled that the auditor’s actions appeared to be grossly negli­
gent and that “reckless disregard of consequences may take the place of deliberate intention.” 
In such cases, while fraudulent intent or scienter may not be present, the court “constructs” 
fraud due to the grossness of the negligence.
The Phar-Mor v. Coopers & Lybrand case is another example of how auditors were found 
guilty of fraud under both common and statutory law, even though the plaintiffs acknowl­
edged that the auditors had no intent to deceive. Instead, the plaintiff successfully argued 
reckless disregard for the truth (i.e., gross negligence or constructive fraud) which gives rise 
to an inference of fraud. Thus, plaintiffs that are barred from suing for ordinary negligence 
in a particular jurisdiction, because they are not in privity or not foreseen users, can opt to 
sue the auditor for fraud because for the auditor to be found guilty under a fraud charge, the 
plaintiffs need only prove gross negligence. The Phar-Mor case write-up and excerpts from 
the actual trial are available in Connect.
In more recent cases (e.g., Houbigant v. Deloitte & Touche, 2003; Reisman v. KPMG, 
2003) courts ruled that for an auditor to be found guilty of fraud, the plaintiffs must only 
prove that the auditor was aware that its misrepresentations might reasonably be relied 
upon by the plaintiff, not that the auditor intended to induce the detrimental reliance. In the 
Houbigant decision the court referred to the recent audit failures in its decision:
It should be sufficient that the complaint contains some rational basis for inferring that the alleged 
misrepresentation was knowingly made. Indeed, to require anything beyond that would be particu­
larly undesirable at this time, when it has been widely acknowledged that our society is experienc­
ing a proliferation of frauds perpetrated by officers of large corporations . . . unchecked by the 
“impartial” auditors they hired.
Auditor Defenses  The defenses presented earlier in this chapter are also available to audi­
tors sued for fraud or gross negligence. If the auditor has been only negligent, he or she can 
claim that his or her negligence did not rise to the level of gross negligence or fraud. The audi­
tor can also raise the statute of limitations as a defense. Finally, the auditor can claim that the 
plaintiff’s lack of due diligence led unjustifiably to reliance on a false representation.
Damages under Common Law
Plaintiffs who are awarded damages for an ordinary or gross negligence claim against an audi­
tor are eligible for compensatory damages, which means they are awarded damages to return 
them to a position equivalent to where they would have been in the absence of the auditor’s 
negligence. Punitive damages, which are above and beyond the amount of damage awarded to 
compensate for actual losses, are awarded to punish outrageous conduct and may be awarded 
when the auditor is found guilty of fraud or constructive fraud under common law. Punitive 

688	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
damages are not permitted under federal statutory law, which provides plaintiffs incentive to 
file fraud charges under common law (often in addition to statutory fraud charges). However, 
the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (discussed below) forces certain 
fraud charges to be brought in federal court under statutory law.
Where the damages to the plaintiff can be apportioned between contributing parties, the 
auditor is only liable for his or her share of the total damages. If apportionment is not pos­
sible, some states follow the principle of joint and several liability. Joint and several liability 
means that the auditor can be responsible for the entire loss even if other parties contributed 
to the loss. Some courts have ruled that joint and several liability is inconsistent with the com­
parative fault concept, and some state legislatures have abolished joint and several liability in 
favor of a proportionate fault approach (i.e., if the auditor is found to be 30 percent at fault, he 
or she is only liable for 30 percent of the damages awarded).
Statutory Law—Civil Liability
Various statutes have been passed at both the federal and state levels that are intended to 
protect the public from malfeasance in the marketplace. While not aimed directly at auditors, 
these statutes do raise the potential for auditor legal liability. The discussion in this chapter is 
limited to the major federal statutes.
The Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act of 2002 are the three major federal statutes that provide the basis of legal liability 
for auditors. On the other hand, the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the 
Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 provide some protection for auditors, 
and others, from securities litigation. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Racketeer 
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) are two other federal statutes that have the 
potential of imposing liability on auditors. The reader should also note that most states also 
have securities laws and RICO statutes.
Securities Act of 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 generally regulates the disclosure of information in a registration 
statement for a new public offering of securities (i.e., new securities sold from the company to 
the public), whereas the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates documents filed with the 
SEC and thus addresses new offerings as well as trading of securities after they are issued 
(i.e., traded from one investor to another).8 The SEC’s “S-forms” (e.g., S-1, S-2) are filed in 
connection with registration of securities under the 1933 Act. Common forms filed under the 
1934 Act include the 10-K (annual report), 10-Q (quarterly reports), and the 8-K (material 
events report). While a number of sections of the Securities Act of 1933 may subject auditors 
to liability, Section 11 imposes a liability on issuers and others, including auditors, for losses 
suffered by third parties when false or misleading information is included in a registration 
statement. Section 11 states:
(a)  Persons possessing cause of action; persons liable. In case any part of the registration state­
ment, when such part became effective, contained an untrue statement of a material fact or 
omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements 
therein not misleading, any person acquiring such security (unless it is proved that at the time 
of such acquisition he knew of such untruth or omission) may, either at law or in equity, in any 
court of competent jurisdiction, sue—
(4)  every accountant . . . who has with his consent been named as having prepared or certified any 
part of the registration statement. . . .
LO 20-5
8The term “security” means any instrument commonly known as a “security” (e.g., note, stock, bond, debenture, 
investment contract, certificate of deposit).

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
689
In contrast to the situation under common law, under the 1933 Act the plaintiff does not 
have to prove negligence or fraud, reliance on the auditor’s opinion, a causal relationship, or a 
contractual relationship. The plaintiff need only prove that
	
1.	 A loss was suffered by investing in the registered security.
	
2.	 The audited financial statements contained a material omission or misstatement.
The misstatement can be the result of mere ordinary negligence. Section 11 of the 1933 
Act is more favorable for plaintiffs than is common law because the burden of proof is shifted 
to the auditor to prove that he or she was not negligent.
Stop and Think: Why would the Securities Act of 1933 impose the presumption of 
negligence, unless the auditor can prove otherwise? Isn’t our legal system built on 
“innocent until proven guilty”?
In other words, the auditor is presumed to have been negligent unless he or she can prove 
otherwise. The extremely plaintiff-friendly legal standards under the 1933 Act reflect the fact 
that audited financial statements are typically more crucial for purchase decisions for new 
public offerings because few other credible sources of information are typically available for 
new security issues.
One defense available to the auditor sued under Section 11 is that of “due diligence.” That 
is, the auditor must have made a reasonable investigation of the facts supporting or contradict­
ing the information included in the registration statement. Such an investigation should be 
similar to one that a prudent person would make under similar circumstances. A leading case 
under Section 11 is Escott v. BarChris Construction, in which the court held that the auditor’s 
actions for events subsequent to the audited balance sheet date had not been conducted with 
due diligence. In this instance, the senior auditor reviewing subsequent events had not spent 
sufficient time on this important task and had accepted glib answers to key questions. The 
court determined that there had been sufficient danger signals that further investigation was 
necessary. The BarChris Construction case is also of interest because of the court’s ruling on 
certain accounting matters and its determination of materiality. A detailed summary of the 
BarChris case is provided in Connect.
A more recent and significant case under Section 11 and other sections of the 1933 Act 
was Bernstein v. Crazy Eddie. Exhibit 20–7 describes the case. Crazy Eddie, Inc., made a 
number of new public offerings of securities. Then the founder and president of the com­
pany resigned, and the successor management team discovered that the financial statements 
issued by the company during the public offering were fraudulent. The company’s financial 
statements had been misstated through inflated inventory and improper transactions by the 
founder and his family. The court ruled against the auditors, indicating that the plaintiffs did 
not have to prove fraud or gross negligence. They had to prove only that the misstated infor­
mation was material and that they suffered a loss.
Other important cases tried under the Securities Act of 1933 are Continental Vending 
(United States v. Simon) and National Student Marketing (United States v. Natelli). Both cases 
resulted in criminal proceedings against the auditor and are described in Connect.
Damages for a violation of Section 11 of the 1933 Act are generally equal to the differ­
ence between the amount paid for the security and the value of the security at the time the 
lawsuit was brought. Punitive damages are not permitted under federal statutory law but, as 
noted earlier, may be recovered in a concurrent common-law fraud action.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934
This statute regulates documents filed with the SEC and is concerned primarily with ongo­
ing reporting by companies whose securities are listed and traded on a stock exchange or 
that meet certain other statutory requirements. Typical reporting requirements under the 
LO 20-6

690	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
1934 Act include the quarterly filing of a 10-Q form, the annual filing of a 10-K form, and 
the periodic filing of an 8-K form whenever a significant event takes place affecting the 
entity. While a number of sections of this statute may have liability consequences for the 
auditor, two sections are particularly important: Section 18 and Section 10(b), including 
Rule 10b-5.
Section 18 imposes liability on any person who makes a material false or misleading 
statement in documents filed with the SEC. The auditor’s liability can be limited if the audi­
tor can show that he or she “acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement 
was false or misleading.” However, a number of cases have limited the auditor’s good-faith 
defense when the auditor’s action has been judged to be grossly negligent.
A common source of liability for auditors under the 1934 Act is Section 10(b) and Rule 
10b-5. Section 10(b) provides for a wide scope of liability. Rule 10b-5 amplifies Section 10(b) 
and states that it is
unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of inter­
state commerce, or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange,
	a.	 To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,
	b.	 To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary 
in order to make the statement made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were 
made, not misleading, or
	c.	 To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud 
or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.
Once a plaintiff has established that he or she can sue under Rule 10b-5, the plaintiff 
must prove the following elements:
	
1.	 A material, factual misrepresentation or omission.
	
2.	 Reliance by the plaintiff on the financial statements.
The Crazy Eddie Case
Eddie Antar was the founder of and major shareholder in Crazy Eddie. The company made several public 
offerings of securities, including the sale of shares held by Eddie Antar and his family. The prospectuses 
and financial statements from 1984 through 1987 erroneously gave the impression that Crazy Eddie was a 
rapidly growing firm. When Antar resigned his position as president, the successor management discov­
ered that the financial statements issued prior to and included in the public offerings had been materially 
misstated. In particular, there was an estimated inventory shortage of $65 million, and the company’s net 
worth was really only $7 million.
The financial statements had been misstated by a number of schemes. Net income and inventory had 
been inflated through improper financial reporting practices. First, inventory marked for return to manu­
facturers had been included as inventory merchandise. Second, certain consignments had been treated 
as sales. Last, there had been related inventory sales to the founder and members of his family that 
were later resold to others. The company had also overstated per-store sales figures. All of these actions 
appear to have been taken to support the price of Crazy Eddie stock and to directly benefit Antar and his 
family. The discovery of the extent of the problems was complicated by the fact that certain documents 
had been altered or destroyed prior to the new management’s assuming control.
The plaintiffs in this case were purchasers of the company’s stock prior to the disclosure of the fraudu­
lent financial statements. They sued the public accounting firm, the board of directors, and others, alleg­
ing that the accounting firm had violated GAAS and GAAP by failing to uncover the company’s fraudulent 
and fictitious activities. The plaintiffs were able to show that they suffered a loss and that the certified 
financial statements in the registration statements and prospectuses had been false and misleading in 
violation of Sections 11 and 12 of the Securities Act of 1933.
The court ruled against the public accounting firm and upheld the plaintiffs’ Section 11 and 12 claims. 
The court held that the plaintiffs did not have to prove fraud or gross negligence, only that any material 
misstatement in the registration statements was misleading and that they had suffered a loss. In this case, 
the auditor was unable to prove that they had exercised appropriate due professional care.

3.	 Damages suffered as a result of reliance on the financial statements.
	
4.	 Scienter.
The first element can include materially misleading information or the omission of mate­
rial information. The second element, reliance, cannot be established if the damages or loss 
suffered by the plaintiff would have occurred regardless of whether the audited financial 
statements were misstated. For example, in the 2008 case of Maxwell v. KPMG, the courts 
ruled that even if the other elements necessary to sue under Rule 10b-5 could be established, 
Maxwell’s alleged reliance on the audited financial statements of an acquiring entity was 
irrelevant as Maxwell’s business model was doomed by the coming dot.com collapse, and 
thus Maxwell’s harm was not caused by KPMG’s audit. In a recent case, Dura Pharma­
ceuticals v. Broudo, the courts ruled that the third element, damages, cannot be established 
by claims that the security price was artificially inflated as a result of materially misstated 
financial statements. Rather, the plaintiff must establish that the security price fell after the 
misstatement became known. The Dura Phamaceuticals case is described in more detail in 
Connect. The fourth element, scienter, is defined as intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud. 
However, some courts have ruled that gross negligence or reckless behavior is sufficient to 
satisfy the scienter element.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Scienter Pleading in the WorldCom Case: In the WorldCom pleading (In re WorldCom, Inc. Sec. Litig.), 
a court determined that the plaintiff adequately established scienter against the auditor without prov­
ing auditor intent to deceive based on the fact that subsequent to the release of clean audit opinions 
the financial statements required enormous restatements and the company’s underlying books and 
records contained no support or documentation related to items that were highly materially mis­
stated in accounting areas such as merger reserves.
A number of important cases have used Section 10(b) as a basis for actions against audi­
tors. In Herzfeld v. Laventhol, the U.S. district court allowed recovery by an investor. The 
investor had purchased securities from the client prior to an audit conducted by Laventhol. 
After the audit, the client offered to refund all investments made prior to the audit. The plain­
tiff declined the refund based on the audited financial statements and lost his investment 
when the company went bankrupt a year later. The plaintiff sued, claiming that the financial 
statements had been false and misleading because profits from the sale of properties were 
reported in the income statement even though there was some uncertainty about the collect­
ibility of the related receivables. Laventhol’s opinion was qualified “subject to” the collect­
ibility of the receivables. The court held that the disclosure of the qualification footnote had 
been inadequate and that Laventhol was liable “because of their active participation in the 
preparation and issuance of false and materially misleading accounting reports upon which 
Herzfeld relied to his damage.”
In Ernst & Ernst v. Hochfelder, which is described in more detail in Connect, the presi­
dent of a brokerage firm, Leston Nay, induced brokerage customers to invest in high-yield 
accounts that he personally managed. The accounts were fictitious, and he used the funds for 
his own purposes. The defrauded customers sued Ernst & Ernst, arguing that the firm, as the 
auditor, should have been aware of Nay’s inappropriate control over the mail and that such 
knowledge would have led to discovery of the fraud. Ernst & Ernst argued that Rule 10b-5 did 
not encompass negligent behavior. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that an action under Rule 
10b-5 may not be maintained by showing that the defendant was negligent; the rule requires 
that scienter, or intent to deceive, be present. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court did not decide 
whether gross negligence or reckless behavior was sufficient for liability under Section 10(b). 
However, a number of subsequent decisions by lower courts have recognized that reckless 
behavior or gross negligence by the auditor satisfies the scienter requirement of Rule 10b-5. 
For example, in two high-profile fraud cases, WorldCom, Inc., and Tyco, Int’l Ltd., judges 
found that the complaints against the auditors met the initial pleading requirements of scien­
ter, even though no intent on behalf of the auditors was claimed. Reckless conduct is behavior

that represents an extreme departure from standards of ordinary care; failure to see the obvi­
ous or a disregard for the truth. 
Prior to 1994, courts frequently held that an auditor who was not liable as a primary vio­
lator of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 could still be held liable for aiding and abetting if the 
auditor had knowledge and had substantially assisted in the primary violation. In fact, prior to 
1994, the aiding and abetting approach was the primary strategy followed by attorneys seek­
ing damages against auditors under Section 10(b). However, in 1994 the Supreme Court held 
in Central Bank v. First Interstate Bank that there is no aiding and abetting liability under 
Section 10(b). The Dodd-Frank Act called for the U.S. Comptroller General to reexamine the 
impact of allowing the aiding and abetting approach to find professionals, such as bankers and 
accountants, liable under the securities laws. Depending on the results of that study, it is con­
ceivable that Congress will revisit the issue.9
After the Central Bank case, the strategy for holding auditors liable under Section 10(b) 
shifted to an attempt to broaden the definition of a primary violator, whereby an accoun­
tant does not have to be the initiator or issuer of a misrepresentation in order to be consid­
ered a primary violator. The auditor only would have to be a party to a “fraudulent scheme.” 
However, the question of whether an auditor who has made no public statement and has not 
violated a duty to disclose important matters may be held liable as a primary violator for 
“participating” in a fraud scheme may have been settled in the 2008 Supreme Court ruling 
in the Stoneridge Investment v. Scientific-Atlanta case. In this case, the defendant, a supplier, 
schemed with a cable television provider to inflate the cable provider’s reported advertis­
ing revenue (offset by overcharging for supplies). The Supreme Court ruled that although 
the defendant knowingly participated in the fraud scheme on investors, it was not a primary 
violator of Section 10(b) because it had made no misleading statement that was relied upon 
by plaintiff investors. Based on the Central Bank and Stoneridge rulings, an accountant who 
assists in the preparation and issuance of fraudulent financial statements cannot be held liable 
under Section 10(b) if the accountant does not make false and misleading statements that are 
relied upon by investors.
The issue of what is necessary to establish primary liability under Section 10(b) can 
be significant in determining when an individual accountant may be held liable. This is an 
issue in the litigation arising out of the Enron–Andersen collapse. While Andersen as a firm 
clearly made statements that permit Section 10(b) claims, stating primary liability claims 
against most of the individual Andersen defendants has proved difficult for plaintiffs. See 
Exhibit 20–8 for more information on the Enron–Andersen litigation.
The proper measure of damages in most Section 10(b) cases is the out-of-pocket loss suf­
fered by the plaintiff. The out-of-pocket loss is the difference between what the plaintiff paid 
or received for the securities and what he or she would have paid or received had there been 
no wrongful conduct by the auditor. Punitive damages are not permitted under federal statu­
tory law, although, as noted earlier, such damages can sometimes be recovered in a concurrent 
common-law fraud action.
In the wake of the Enron and WorldCom accounting frauds, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 
lengthened the statute of limitations for actions under Section 10(b) based on claims of “fraud, 
deceit, manipulation, or contrivance in contravention of a regulatory requirement concerning 
the securities laws.” The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides that any action shall be brought no 
later than two years from discovery and within five years from when the fraudulent conduct 
occurred. This provision was the only portion of Sarbanes-Oxley that specifically affected 
private securities fraud actions. The prior statute of limitations were one and three years, 
respectively.
The book’s website (www.mhhe.com/messier10e) describes three other relatively recent 
cases tried under the 1934 Act: Continental Vending, Mini-Scribe, and Phar-Mor.
9The mandated study relates to private claims. The SEC has long had the ability to bring aiding and abetting claims 
against auditors and the Dodd-Frank Act lowered the standard from “knowingly” to “recklessly.” However, the SEC 
has not been active in pursuing aiding and abetting claims.

The Enron Case
In its early years, Enron Corporation, based in Houston, was a traditional natural gas pipeline company, 
delivering natural gas to businesses and utilities. However, changes in the government regulations of 
electrical power markets opened the door for change. Enron transformed itself into a market maker for 
numerous different energy-related commodities. Enron’s stock price surged during the late 1990s, moving 
Enron into the spotlight of U.S. business. It became the seventh largest company in the United States and 
was praised for being one of America’s most innovative companies.
In 2001, after showing profits for the previous several years, Enron reported a third-quarter loss of 
$618 million and a $1.2 billion reduction in owner’s equity related to off-balance sheet partnerships. The 
news resulted in a sharp drop in Enron’s stock price and a formal SEC inquiry. On November 8, 2001, 
Enron announced that it had overstated profits by $586 million, erasing almost all its profits from the 
past five years, collapsing the stock price, and diminishing the confidence of its clients. Within a month of 
this announcement, Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. At the time, Enron’s was the one of the largest 
corporate bankruptcies in history.
The Enron collapse involved many players, including company executives, investment bankers, finan­
cial analysts, and accountants. Enron’s auditor, Arthur Andersen, one of the largest national accounting 
firms at the time, quickly became the target of public scrutiny.
The government’s investigation of Enron’s accounting practices revealed a number of accounting 
improprieties, including misuse of special-purpose entities (SPE) to sell off underperforming assets at a 
profit. Because of undisclosed Enron guarantees related to the transactions, most of these “sales” were 
really schemes to overstate “paper” gains and understate liabilities.
Fueled by a public uproar, the government began criminal proceedings. The Justice Department 
accused top Andersen officials of directing employees to alter and/or shred Enron-related documents after 
it knew about the SEC investigation. In June 2002, Andersen was found guilty of one count of obstruction 
of justice, fined $500,000, and sentenced to five years’ probation. However, the criminal indictment in 
itself so severely harmed Andersen’s reputation that clients fled and the firm essentially liquidated within 
months.
In 2004 Andrew Fastow, Enron’s former CFO and principal player in the company’s accounting 
schemes, pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy and was sentenced to serve the maximum 10-year 
sentence.
In 2006 former Enron chairman Kenneth Lay and former president Jeffrey Skilling were convicted on 
numerous federal fraud and conspiracy charges. Shortly after the conviction, Lay died of a massive heart 
attack and his conviction was vacated. Skilling was sentenced to 24 years in prison.

Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Securities 
Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, and the Class Action 
Fairness Act of 2005
Prior to the passage of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, auditors who 
were sued under federal statutory law were held to the legal doctrine of joint and several 
liability, which holds each defendant fully liable for all assessed damages, regardless of the 
extent to which he or she contributed to the injury. The 1995 Act amends the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934 to provide, in general, for proportionate liability, where each defen­
dant is liable solely for the portion of the damages that corresponds to the percentage of 
responsibility of that defendant. To encourage more forward-looking disclosures, the 1995 
Act also reduced auditor liability by creating a legal “safe harbor” related to forward-looking 
financial statements (see a discussion of financial forecasts and projections in Chapter 21). 
The 1995 Act also amends the 1934 Act to include in federal law the auditor’s responsibility 
to detect fraud and requires auditors to promptly notify the audit committee and the board 
of directors of illegal acts. The Act further requires the auditor to notify the SEC within one 
business day when an entity’s management fails to take appropriate action in response to 
reports of material fraud.
A class action lawsuit allows a large number of people with a common interest in a mat­
ter to sue as a group. The 1995 Act allows class members with the greatest financial losses to 
control the class action litigation, rather than “professional” plaintiffs who defer to attorneys 
LO 20-7

Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
initiating the litigation. Finally, the 1995 Act raises the pleading requirement at the beginning 
of a case. For example, no longer can plaintiffs plead a general claim of fraud and then use 
discovery proceedings to conduct a “fishing expedition” in the auditors’ workpapers and files 
in search of actionable conduct. Rather, the 1995 Act requires that misrepresentation claims 
state the time, place, and contents of the allegedly false representations; the identity of the 
person making them; facts providing strong inference that the auditor acted with intent to 
deceive; and what he or she obtained as a result of the fraud. In the 2007 case of Tellabs v. 
Makor, the Supreme Court held that in determining whether the plaintiff’s complaint provides 
evidence of scienter, a court must consider both sides of the story (i.e., fraud and nonfraud 
plausible causes), and the plaintiff “must demonstrate that it is more likely than not that the 
defendant acted with scienter.” See a description of the Tellabs case in Connect. Subsequent 
to the Tellabs case there have been a number of cases addressing what factual allegations 
satisfy the “strong inference” test (e.g., Colorado Retirement Fund v. Deloitte, 2009). For 
example, boilerplate allegations such as weak internal controls and GAAP or GAAS viola­
tions alone are not adequate evidence of scienter. The increased pleading requirements may 
discourage baseless “deep-pockets” lawsuits where plaintiffs hope to pressure defendants to 
settle out of court because the legal costs to fight the lawsuit may be greater than the costs to 
settle. In cases connected to the 1995 Act, Xerion v. Resurgence and Isakov v. Ernst & Young, 
the judges ruled that “fraud by hindsight” is not a recognized pleading and neither is alleging 
a series of “red flags” without sufficient inference that the auditor was aware of the red flags 
(see also Exhibit 20–9).
In response to concerns that plaintiff lawyers were circumventing the Private Securi­
ties Litigation Reform Act of 1995 by bringing class action suits involving nationally traded 
securities to state courts, Congress passed the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 
1998. The purpose of the Uniform Standards Act was to “prevent plaintiffs from seeking to 
evade the protections that Federal law provides against abusive litigation by filing suit in State, 
rather than Federal Court.” The primary federal protections to which the 1998 Act refers are 
proportionate liability, disallowed punitive damages, and higher filing standards. As a result 
of the 1998 Act, most large class actions against auditors alleging securities fraud must now 
be brought in federal court. The 1998 Act defines a “covered class action” to include any law­
suit or group of lawsuits where damages are sought on behalf of more than 50 persons. Thus, 
smaller class action lawsuits can still be pursued in state court. In an attempt to circumvent the 
Uniform Standards Act, attorneys brought a number of Enron-related lawsuits in Texas state 
court with each suit filed on behalf of fewer than 50 persons (e.g., see Newby v. Enron, 2002). 
However, when the same attorney files multiple “cookie-cutter” lawsuits with fewer than 50 
persons, the court may determine that the cases constitute “covered class action.”
The Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (“CAFA”) was passed in response to perceived 
abuses in nationwide class action lawsuits filed in various state courts. CAFA expands the 
federal jurisdiction to include most multistate class actions where there is more than $5 mil­
lion in dispute. Legal experts believe that federal judges are more likely than state judges to 
dismiss dubious claims. CAFA also imposes increased judicial and regulatory scrutiny over 
the propriety of class action settlements because in some past settlements the only parties that 
actually benefited were the attorneys.
Auditor Litigation in the Madoff Ponzi Scheme
Several lawsuits have been brought by investors against the auditors of Madoff feeder funds. These 
feeder funds invested in Madoff’s fraudulent Ponzi scheme and ultimately lost money (see Exhibit 4–2). 
However, the alleged risk factors or red flags generally related to actions taken by the Madoff fraud team 
and not to the auditors of the feeder funds. Some of the cases have been dismissed and in dismissing the 
claim against the auditors, courts have pointed out that the Madoff fraud was sufficiently sophisticated as 
to go undetected by the SEC and others for two decades. Other cases against auditors of feeder funds are 
still working their way through the courts. Selected Sources: C. Salvatore, “2 KPMG Units Dodge Madoff 
Investor Suits,” Law360 (July 2014). B. Healy, “Court OK’s lawsuit against KPMG in Madoff Fraud,” The

Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
695
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is considered the most sweeping securities law since the 1933 and 
1934 Acts. Its main objectives are to restore investor confidence in the securities markets and 
to deter future corporate frauds. The Act does include sections directly addressing legal liabil­
ity, but the other aspects of the Act (e.g., the creation of the PCAOB, stricter independence 
rules, audits of internal controls, and increased reporting responsibilities) are more important 
to auditors’ performance and create new federal laws with which the auditor must comply. 
The creation of the PCAOB is the single most significant aspect of the legislation, ending 
decades of self-regulation by the accounting profession. 
Although Congress created and passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as is customary with sim­
ilar legislation, Congress did not develop the detailed accounting and securities rules and regu­
lations needed to execute the Act’s provisions. Instead, the Act delegates substantial authority 
and responsibility to the SEC to create the detailed rules and regulations. For example, Section 
302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act directed the SEC to create rules requiring CEO and CFO certi­
fication of periodic financial reports within 30 days of the legislation’s signing, which the SEC 
did.10 Similarly, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to adopt a “claw-back” rule to recover 
incentive-based compensation from current and former executive officers when the company 
is required to restate its previously issued financial statements to correct a material error.11
The Act does not prohibit the SEC from extending the rules beyond what is required by 
the Act. For instance, Section 802 stipulates that audit firms must retain their audit documen­
tation for a period of five years, while the SEC’s final ruling extends the period to seven years. 
Failure to retain audit documentation can result in fines and imprisonment for up to 10 years.
Some of the most important provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are aimed at increas­
ing the responsibility of corporate officers and directors for the reliability of their company’s 
financial statements. Congress understands that the primary culprits in corporate fraud are dis­
honest officers and directors. Sections 302 and 906 of the Act require the chief executive and 
chief financial officers of each public company to certify personally, among other things, the 
fairness of the financial information and the company’s compliance with the 1934 Act in each 
quarterly and annual report filed with the SEC. Regarding executive certifications, the courts 
have ruled that merely signing documents governed by Section 302 that ultimately are shown 
to contain material misstatements does not automatically make the signatories liable for fraud.
Rather than address the various legal liability aspects of the Act in this section, we dis­
cuss them in the pertinent sections that follow because most of the legal liability legislation in 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents enhancements or revisions to existing laws.

Annual Reports” (Release No. 33-8124, August 2002).

claw-back or recovery even if the executive officer was not engaged in misconduct and even if they were not involved 
in the financial reporting process. 
Practice 
INSIGHT
Personal Liability: After learning about auditor liability, some of you may wonder if legal liability 
extends to junior-level accountants or auditors. The answer is no in almost all cases, because staff 
should be supervised and their work should be reviewed by more experienced accountants. Thus, 
the firm, and potentially senior executives of the audit firm responsible for planning, reviewing, and 
overseeing the audit, ultimately face legal liability. However, liability and potential criminal action do 
extend to accountants and auditors of all levels if they commit fraudulent acts. Also, junior-level audi­
tors are potentially subject to SEC and PCAOB sanctions discussed in the next section.
SEC and PCAOB Sanctions
SEC Rule 102(e) empowers the SEC to suspend for any person the privilege of appearing and 
practicing before it if that person is found
	
1.	 To not possess the necessary qualifications to represent others before the SEC; 
including, but not limited to persons whose license to practice as an accountant has 
been revoked or suspended by any state, territory, district, and so forth.
LO 20-9

696	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
	
2.	 To be lacking in character or integrity.
	
3.	 To have engaged in unethical or improper professional conduct; including, but not 
limited to felony conviction or misdemeanor conviction involving moral turpitude.
	
4.	 To have willfully violated or willfully aided and abetted any violations of the federal 
securities laws or any rules or regulations promulgated pursuant to those laws.
This sanction can be applied not only to an individual auditor but also to an entire accounting 
firm. In a study of SEC sanctions against auditors who had opined on financial statements that 
later were determined to be fraudulently misstated, individual auditors were sanctioned in 
99 percent of the cases and the firm was sanctioned in 33 percent of the cases.12 If a firm is 
suspended or barred from practice before the SEC, the impact on the firm’s clients can be 
severe. For example, if a firm is suspended, its clients may not be able to file their reports with 
the SEC on a timely basis. Typically, if a firm is faced with suspension, it will work out 
some type of consent agreement in which the firm does not admit guilt but agrees to lesser 
sanctions. These sanctions may include not taking on new SEC clients for a specified period 
and subjecting the firm to special reviews to ensure that the alleged problems have been cor­
rected. For example, in 2004 Ernst & Young was sanctioned by the SEC for violating inde­
pendence standards during the audit of PeopleSoft for the years 1994–1999. The sanctions 
included fines and a six-month suspension from accepting new SEC registrant audit cli­
ents. Such suspensions can be very costly for large accounting firms.
The SEC can also impose fines, such as the $7 million fine imposed in 2001 on Arthur 
Andersen in connection with audits of Waste Management. The Waste Management case was 
particularly egregious because Andersen agreed to a plan to cover up Waste Management’s 
financial misstatements by adjusting them down over a period of years rather than correcting 
them immediately. It also followed on the heels of other Andersen audit failures at Sunbeam 
Corporation and the Arizona Baptist Foundation and was a foreshadowing of the Enron and 
WorldCom failures disclosed within a year of the $7 million Waste Management fine.
A study of SEC sanctions imposed on auditors found that the most common problems 
cited were the auditors’ failure to gather sufficient competent audit evidence, failure to exer­
cise due professional care, insufficient level of professional skepticism, failure to obtain ade­
quate evidence related to management representations, and failure to express an appropriate 
audit opinion.13
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act grants the PCAOB broad investigative and disciplinary authority 
over registered public accounting firms and persons associated with such firms. As directed 
by the Act, the board adopted rules relating to investigations and adjudications in September 
2003. Under the rules, the PCAOB may conduct investigations concerning any acts or practices 
involving auditors of publicly traded firms that may “violate any provision of the Act, the rules 
of the Board, the provisions of the securities laws relating to the preparation and issuance of 
audit reports and the obligations and liabilities of accountants with respect thereto, including 
the rules of the SEC issued under the Act, or professional standards.” The Dodd-Frank Act 
grants the PCAOB the ability to share inspection findings with regulators in other countries, 
which will greatly improve the PCAOB’s ability to inspect registered foreign accounting firms.
When violations are detected, the board has the authority to impose sanctions. The sanc­
tions can include revoking a firm’s registration, barring a person from participating in audits 
of public companies, monetary penalties (up to $750,000 per individual or $15 million per 
firm), and requirements for remedial measures, such as training, new quality control proce­
dures, and the appointment of an independent monitor. In 2011, the PCAOB censured, sanc­
tioned, and penalized Indian affiliate firms of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited 
for not following auditing standards in connection with the audit of Satyam Computer Ser­
vices headquartered in New Delhi, India (PCAOB Release No. 105-2011-002). The penalty 
of $1.5 million imposed by the PCAOB and $6 million by the SEC is the largest civil penalty 
ever imposed on a registered foreign accounting firm. Sanctions included prohibition on the

Investigations: 1998–2010,” report commissioned and published by the Center for Audit Quality, 2013.

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) was passed by Congress in 1977 in response to the 
discovery of bribery and other misconduct on the part of more than 300 American companies. 
The Act was codified in 1988 as an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. As a 
result, an auditor may be subject to administrative proceedings, civil liability, and civil penal­
ties under the FCPA. The FCPA prohibits corporate officers from knowingly participating in 
bribing foreign officials to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also imposes record-keeping 
and internal control requirements on public companies. Basically, corporations must keep 
their books, records, and accounts in sufficient detail to accurately reflect transactions. Com­
panies are also required to develop and maintain adequate systems of internal control.14 To 
comply with the provisions of the FCPA, many corporations have established codes of con­
duct that prohibit bribery. Compliance with corporate codes of conduct should be checked by 
the audit committee and the internal auditors. The external auditor may detect activities that 
violate the FCPA; auditing standards require such violations to be communicated to manage­
ment immediately.
Since 2008 there has been an uptick in the number of cases and related corporate penal­
ties related to FCPA Enforcement. The best defense against the risk of enforcement under 
FCPA is a thorough and effective compliance program that takes into account the entity’s 
operations, products, services, and industry specific risks. To aid in the development of an 
appropriate compliance program, in 2012 the SEC and Department of Justice jointly issued 
landmark formal guidance on the statute that address the Act’s key elements.15
LO 20-10
14The FCPA’s requirement around internal control was a primary reason for the formation of COSO and the develop-
ment of the COSO Internal Control Integrated Framework that was initially issued in 1993.

Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act
Although the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) was enacted by 
Congress in 1970 to combat the infiltration of legitimate businesses by organized crime, it has 
been used against auditors. RICO provides civil and criminal sanctions for certain types of 
illegal acts. A major factor in bringing an action under RICO is that the law provides for treble 
damages (i.e., three times the actual loss) in civil RICO cases. Racketeering activity includes 
a long list of federal and state crimes, with mail fraud and wire fraud the most common alle­
gations against auditors.
LO 20-11

698	
Part 7    Professional Responsibilities
Generally, a single instance of racketeering activity is not sufficient to establish a pattern 
of racketeering. In the case of Reves v. Ernst & Young (1993), the Supreme Court established 
an “operations and management test” for auditors that requires that the plaintiff prove that 
the accounting firm participated in the operation or management of the client’s business. A 
description of this case is presented in Connect.
Prior to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, securities fraud was an 
offense under RICO. The reform Act eliminated securities fraud as an offense in civil suits 
under RICO unless the auditor is criminally convicted of the fraud. Thus, experts believe that 
after the reform Act, Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 violations will almost never be grounds for 
a civil damage claim against an auditor under RICO.16
16See Chapter 6 in Goldwasser and Arnold, Accountants’ Liability (Practising Law Institute, 2014).
Statutory Law—Criminal Liability
Auditors can be held criminally liable under the statutory laws discussed in the previous sec­
tions if they commit illegal acts. In addition, auditors can be held criminally liable for various 
other federal and state laws, such as banking and insurance regulations. Criminal prosecutions 
require that some form of criminal intent be present. However, many of the laws described in 
this chapter contain provisions for criminal penalties to be levied if an auditor’s actions reflect 
gross negligence. In a famous quote from United States v. Benjamin, the Court stated that an 
auditor would be held criminally liable if he “deliberately closed his eyes to facts he had a 
duty to see . . . or recklessly stated as facts things of which he was ignorant.”
A number of significant cases against auditors have resulted in criminal prosecution, with 
auditors being assessed large fines and serving time in prison. Included among these cases are 
Continental Vending (United States v. Simon), National Student Marketing (United States v. 
Natelli), Equity Funding (United States v. Weiner), ESM Government Securities, Inc. (In re 
Alexander Grant & Co. Litigation) and HealthSouth Corporation (SEC v. Owens). Note that in 
addition to criminal prosecution of the auditors, the auditors’ firms were civilly liable for violat­
ing various statutes and paid large sums to settle the cases. These cases are described in Connect.
Of course, the most damaging criminal conviction against an audit firm to date came in 
June 2002, when Arthur Andersen was found guilty of one count of obstruction of justice in 
the Enron investigation (see Exhibit 20–8). Ironically, in 2006 the U.S. Supreme Court unani­
mously reversed the conviction due to vague instructions provided to the jury for determining 
whether Andersen obstructed justice. However, the Supreme Court’s decision did little to help 
Andersen because the 2002 conviction had already resulted in the dismantling of the firm.
Numerous sections of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act include criminal provisions. The Act 
enhances prosecutorial tools available in major fraud cases by expanding statutory prohi­
bitions against fraud and obstruction of justice, increasing criminal penalties for traditional 
fraud and cover-up crimes, and strengthening sentencing guidelines applicable to large-scale 
financial frauds. The Act adds criminal penalties for defrauding shareholders of public com­
panies and increases authorized penalties for securities and financial reporting fraud (e.g., 
up to 25 years in prison). It is expected that the Act’s increased penalties will result in longer 
prison terms because of the corresponding changes in the federal sentencing guidelines.
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act increases penalties for impeding official investigations. Because 
most frauds are discovered by employees rather than external auditors, the Act also strength­
ens the legal protections accorded whistleblowers. It is common for employers to retaliate 
against informants by demoting or firing them. The Act makes it a felony punishable by 
10-year imprisonment to retaliate against anyone who voluntarily comes forward to report 
suspected violations of any federal laws. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, whistleblowers who 
bring violations of securities law or of the FCPA to the attention of the SEC or U.S. Depart­
ment of Justice are entitled to 10 percent to 30 percent of any government recovery in excess 
of $1 million.
LO 20-8, 20-12

	
Chapter 20    Legal Liability	
699
As we noted in Chapter 19, individual ethics and integrity cannot be legislated. As such, 
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act will not be a cure-all for corporate reform. Greed, mismanagement, 
conflicts of interest, and professional failures will never completely disappear. However, most 
observers in the legal and accounting professions generally believe that the reforms imposed 
by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act were needed, contribute to improved governance, and send a sig­
nal that society does not tolerate widespread deceit in financial reporting.
Minimizing Litigation Costs: The threat of legal liability serves to prevent or limit inappropriate behav­
ior on the part of auditors. However, auditors cannot be expected to ensure the accuracy of either 
financial statements or the financial health of a business entity. Lawsuits against public accountants 
not only result in direct financial effects such as large settlement costs but also impact the profes­
sion and society in other ways. Thus, the public accounting profession has an interest in minimizing 
auditors’ exposure to legal liability. The profession is increasingly exploring the possibility of utilizing 
alternative dispute resolution procedures (i.e., arbitration and mediation) as a means of reducing 
litigation costs. Using arbitration and mediation to settle disputes does not remove legal liability 
(except perhaps punitive damages), but it does provide important benefits such as an arbitrator with 
knowledge of auditing and accounting matters, less time-consuming litigation, and reduced adminis­
trative and legal support costs of litigation.*

Cord’s financial statements. While performing the audit, Frank failed to discover 
fraud that later caused Jenna to suffer substantial losses. For Frank to be liable under 
common-law negligence, Jenna at a minimum must prove that Frank

20-17	 Brown & Company, CPAs, issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements 
of its client King Corporation. Based on the strength of King’s financial statements, 
Safe Bank loaned King $500,000. King Corporation and Safe Bank are both located 
in a state that follows the Ultramares doctrine. Brown was unaware that Safe would 
receive a copy of the financial statements or that they would be used by King in 
obtaining a loan. King defaulted on the loan.
	
	
	 	
If Safe commences an action for ordinary negligence against Brown, and Brown 
believes it will be able to prove that it conducted the audit in conformity with GAAS, 
Brown will
	
a.	 Be liable to Safe, because Safe relied on the financial statements.
	
b.	 Be liable to Safe, because the statute of frauds has been satisfied.
	
c.	 Not be liable to Safe, because there is a conclusive legal presumption that follow­
ing GAAS is the equivalent of acting reasonably and with due care.
	
d.	 Not be liable to Safe, because there was a lack of privity of contract.

misrepresentations or omissions of material facts in a registration statement, expand 
auditors’ liability to purchasers of securities beyond that of common law?
	
a.	 Purchasers have to prove only that a loss was caused by reliance on audited finan­
cial statements.
	
b.	 Privity with purchasers is not a necessary element of proof.
	
c.	 Purchasers have to prove either fraud or gross negligence as a basis for recovery.

20-26	 Becker, Inc., purchased the assets of Bell Corporation. A condition of the purchase 
agreement was that Bell retain a CPA to audit its financial statements. The purpose 
of the audit was to determine whether the unaudited financial statements furnished 
to Becker fairly presented Bell’s financial position. Bell retained Salam & Company, 
CPAs, to perform the audit.
	
	
	 	
While performing the audit, Salam discovered that Bell’s bookkeeper had embez­
zled $500. Salam had some evidence of other embezzlements by the bookkeeper. 
However, Salam decided that the $500 was immaterial and that the other suspected 
embezzlements did not require further investigation. Salam did not discuss the matter 
with Bell’s management. Unknown to Salam, the bookkeeper had, in fact, embezzled 
large sums of cash from Bell. In addition, the accounts receivable were significantly 
overstated. Salam did not detect the overstatement because of Salam’s failure to fol­
low its audit program.
	
	
	 	
Despite the foregoing, Salam issued an unqualified opinion on Bell’s finan­
cial statements and furnished a copy of the audited financial statements to Becker. 
Unknown to Salam, Becker required financing to purchase Bell’s assets and furnished 
a copy of Bell’s audited financial statements to City Bank to obtain approval of the 
loan. Based on Bell’s audited financial statements, City loaned Becker $600,000.
	
	
	 	
Becker paid Bell $750,000 to purchase Bell’s assets. Within six months, Becker 
began experiencing financial difficulties resulting from the undiscovered embezzle­
ments and overstated accounts receivable. Becker later defaulted on the City loan.

action:
	
	
	 ∙	 Ordinary negligence.

	 throughout the United States. Astor’s officers decided to raise $1 million by selling 
shares of Astor’s common stock in an exempt offering under Regulation D of the 
Securities Act of 1933. In connection with the offering, Astor engaged Apple & 
Company, CPAs, to audit Astor’s financial statements. The audited financial state­
ments, including Apple’s unqualified opinion, were included in the offering memo­
randum given to prospective purchasers of Astor’s stock. Apple was aware that Astor 
intended to include the statements in the offering materials.
	
	
	 	
Astor’s financial statements reported certain inventory items at a cost of $930,000 
when in fact they had a fair market value of less than $100,000 because of techno­
logical obsolescence. Apple accepted the assurances of Astor’s controller that cost

was the appropriate valuation, despite the fact that Apple was aware of ongoing sales 
of the products at prices substantially less than cost. All of this was thoroughly docu­
mented in Apple’s workpapers.
	
	
	 	
Musk purchased 10,000 shares of Astor’s common stock in the Regulation D 
offering at a total price of $300,000. In deciding to make the purchase, Musk had 
reviewed the audited financial statements of Astor that accompanied the other offer­
ing materials and had been impressed by Astor’s apparent financial strength.
	
	
	 	
Shortly after the stock offering was completed, Astor’s management discovered 
that the audited financial statements reflected the materially overstated valuation of 
the company’s inventory. Astor advised its shareholders of the problem.
	
	
	 	
Upon receiving notice from Astor of the overstated inventory amount, Musk 
became very upset because the stock value was now substantially less than what it 
would have been had the financial statements been accurate. In fact, the stock was

Musk has commenced an action against Apple, alleging that Apple is liable to 
Musk based on the following causes of action:
	
	
	 ∙	 Common-law fraud.
	
	
	 ∙	 Negligence.
	
	
	 ∙	 A violation of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act

a.	 What elements must be established by Musk to support a cause of action based on 
negligence?
	
b.	 What elements must be established by Musk to support a cause of action based on 
a Rule 10b-5 violation?
	
c.	 Is Apple’s assertion regarding lack of privity correct with regard to Musk’s causes 
of action for negligence and fraud?

20-28	 Butler Manufacturing Corporation planned to raise capital for a plant expansion by 
borrowing from banks and making several stock offerings. Butler engaged Meng, 
CPA, to audit its financial statements. Butler told Meng that the financial statements 
would be given to certain named banks and included in the prospectuses for the stock 
offerings.
	
	
	 	
In performing the audit, Meng did not confirm accounts receivable and, as a 
result, failed to discover a material overstatement of accounts receivable. Also, Meng 
was aware of a pending class action product liability lawsuit that was not disclosed 
in Butler’s financial statements. Despite being advised by Butler’s legal counsel that 
Butler’s potential liability under the lawsuit would result in material losses, Meng 
issued an unqualified opinion on Butler’s financial statements.
	
	
	 	
Union Bank, one of the named banks, relied on the financial statements and 
Meng’s opinion in giving Butler a $500,000 loan.
	
	
	 	
A couple of months after obtaining the Bank loan, Butler also raised $16,450,000 
through stock offerings.
	
	
	 	
Shortly after obtaining the Union loan, Butler began experiencing financial prob­
lems but was able to stay in business because of the money raised by the offerings. 
Then Butler was found liable in the product liability suit. This resulted in a judgment 
Butler could not pay. Butler also defaulted on the Union loan and was involuntarily

petitioned into bankruptcy. This caused Union to sustain a loss and Butler’s stock­
holders to lose their investments. As a result,
	
	
	 ∙	 Union sued Meng for negligence and common-law fraud.
	
	
	 ∙	 The stockholders who purchased Butler’s stock through the offerings, as well as 
stockholders who purchased shares subsequently traded on a national securities 
exchange, sued Meng, alleging fraud under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
	
	
	 These transactions took place in a jurisdiction providing for accountants’ liability for 
negligence to known and intended users of financial statements.
Required:
	
	
	 Answer the following questions and give the reasons for your conclusions.
	
a.	 Will Union be successful in its suit against Meng for
	
1.	 Negligence?
	
2.	 Common-law fraud?
	
b.	 Will the stockholders who purchased Butler’s stock succeed against Meng 
under the antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934?

20-29	 Sleek Corporation is a public corporation whose stock is traded on a national securi­
ties exchange. Sleek hired Garson Associates, CPAs, to audit Sleek’s financial state­
ments. Sleek needed the audit to obtain bank loans and to offer public stock so that it 
could expand.
	
	
	 	
Before the engagement, Fred Hedge, Sleek’s president, told Garson’s managing 
partner that the audited financial statements would be submitted to Sleek’s banks to 
obtain the necessary loans.
	
	
	 	
During the course of the audit, Garson’s managing partner found that Hedge and 
other Sleek officers had embezzled substantial amounts of money from the corpora­
tion. These embezzlements threatened Sleek’s financial stability. When these find­
ings were brought to Hedge’s attention, Hedge promised that the money would be 
repaid and begged that the audit not disclose the embezzlements.
	
	
	 	
Hedge also told Garson’s managing partner that several friends and relatives of 
Sleek’s officers had been advised about the projected business expansion and pro­
posed stock offering and had purchased significant amounts of Sleek’s stock based 
on this information.
	
	
	 	
Garson submitted an unqualified opinion on Sleek’s financial statements, which 
did not include adjustments for or disclosures about the embezzlements and insider 
stock transactions. The financial statements and audit report were submitted to 
Sleek’s regular banks, including Knox Bank. Knox, relying on the financial state­
ments and Garson’s report, gave Sleek a $2 million loan.
	
	
	 	
Sleek’s audited financial statements were also incorporated into a registration 
statement prepared under the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The registra­
tion statement was filed with the SEC in conjunction with Sleek’s public offering of 
100,000 shares of its common stock at $100 per share.
	
	
	 	
An SEC investigation of Sleek disclosed the embezzlements and the insider 
trading. Trading in Sleek’s stock was suspended, and Sleek defaulted on the 
Knox loan.
	
	
	 	
As a result, the following legal actions were taken:
	
	
	 ∙	 Knox sued Garson.
	
	
	 ∙	 The general-public purchasers of Sleek’s stock offering sued Garson.
Required:
	
	
	 Answer the following questions and give the reasons for your conclusions.
	
a.	 Would Knox recover from Garson for fraud?

20-30	 Conan Doyle & Associates (CD&A), CPAs, served as the auditors for Lestrad Cor­
poration and Watson Corporation, publicly held companies traded on NASDAQ. 
Watson recently acquired Lestrad Corporation in a merger that involved swapping 
1.75 shares of Watson for 1 share of Lestrad. In connection with that merger, CD&A 
issued an unqualified report on the financial statements and participated in the prepa­
ration of the pro forma unaudited financial statements contained in the combined pro­
spectus and proxy statement circulated to obtain shareholder approval of the merger 
and to register the shares to be issued in connection with the merger. Watson prepared 
a Form 8-K and Form 10-K in connection with the merger. Shortly thereafter, finan­
cial disaster beset the merged company, resulting in large losses to the shareholders 
and creditors. A class action suit on behalf of shareholders and creditors has been 
filed against Watson and its management. In addition, it names CD&A as a codefen­
dant, challenging the fairness, accuracy, and truthfulness of the financial statements.
Required:
	
	
	 Discuss the various bases of CD&A’s potential civil liability to the shareholders 
and creditors of Watson as a result of issuing an unqualified report on the audited 
financial statements of Watson and Lestrad and having participated in preparing the 
unaudited financial statements required in connection with the merger under

20-31	 Critics of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act do not believe the Act will be effective at deter­
ring accounting frauds because it primarily relies on specifying new crimes and 
higher penalties (i.e., increasing the maximum fine and prison terms). Critics argue 
that if corporate executives are not deterred by the prospect of 5 or 10 years in prison 
(which existed pre-Sarbanes), the threat of imprisonment will have little or no practi­
cal effect no matter what the maximum is raised to. Thus, critics conclude that the 
Act was more of an expression of political outrage than good policy.
	
	
	 	
Proponents of the Act believe the new crimes, increased penalties, and the other pro­
visions in the Act will be effective at significantly reducing corporate accounting frauds.

Assurance, Attestation, 
and Internal Auditing Services
B
ecause of their reputation for competence and objectivity, CPAs for many 
years have been asked to perform a variety of services beyond the audit 
of historical financial statements. However, prior to the development of 
standards specifically relating to nonaudit attestation services, auditors found 
it difficult to provide such services within the bounds of auditing standards. To 
accommodate the demand for services by CPAs, the AICPA introduced attes­
tation standards in 1986. The attestation standards are broader in scope than 
auditing standards so that they can be applied to the wide array of services 
being requested of accounting professionals. In 2001, the Auditing Standards 
Board completed a substantial revision and recodification of the attestation 
standards, and is, as of the writing of this edition, working on a revised, clarified 
version. The PCAOB adopted the AICPA attestation standards on an interim 
basis in April 2003 and those standards remain unchanged since that time.
In addition to accommodating society’s increasing demand for CPA-
provided attestation services, the profession aggressively sought to expand 
the opportunities for assurance-related services in the late 1990s. The AICPA 
Special Committee on Assurance Services (“the Elliott Committee”) issued a 
report in 1996 that led to the AICPA establishing a program to promote various 
nontraditional assurance services. While the profession’s emphasis on nontra­
ditional assurance services has cooled in the wake of Sarbanes-Oxley and the 
subsequent “back-to-basics” trend, some accounting firms continue to provide 
such services.
This chapter begins with an overview of assurance services (and an 
Advanced Module offers a brief overview of two specific types of such ser­
vices). Attest services and standards are presented next. The reader should 
note that many of the so-called assurance services actually are conducted as 
attestation engagements. The chapter also covers other types of accounting 
services offered by CPAs. The last part of the chapter discusses the services 
and standards relating to internal auditing, an important area that has seen 
significantly increased emphasis over the past decade.

710	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
Figure 21-1 expands on Figure 1–2 and presents the relationship of assurance services to attest 
and auditing. As discussed in Chapter 1, the broad umbrella of assurance services includes 
attestation and auditing services, among others. The AICPA Special Committee on Assurance 
Services defined assurance services as follows:
Assurance services are independent professional services that improve the quality of information, 
or its context, for decision makers.
This definition captures a number of important concepts. First, the definition focuses on deci­
sion making. Making good decisions requires quality information, which can be financial or 
nonfinancial in nature. Figure 21–2, adapted from the report of the AICPA Special Committee 
on Assurance Services, presents a model for decision making. You will note that information, 
the first fundamental concept in the decision model, is critical. Three types of information 
enter into the problem definition stage of the model: (1) environmental information, (2) pro­
cess monitoring and diagnostic information, and (3) outcome feedback information. An assur­
ance service engagement can help the decision maker search through this information in order 
to identify which pieces are relevant for the required decision.
The second fundamental concept relates to improving the quality of information or its 
context. In the decision model shown in Figure 21–2, an assurance service engagement can 
improve information quality by increasing confidence in the information’s reliability, rele­
vance, and timeliness. Context can be improved via the format in which information is pre­
sented or through the provision of other relevant benchmarking information.
The third important concept in the definition of assurance services is independence. As 
we indicated in our earlier discussions of financial statement auditing, independence is the 
hallmark of the accounting profession.
The last concept is embodied in the term “professional services,” which reflects the 
application of professional judgment to the information that is the subject of the assurance 
service. In summary, assurance services provided by accounting professionals can capture 
information, improve its quality, and enhance its usefulness for decision makers, in ways that 
are free from bias or conflict of interest.

Types of Assurance Services
The AICPA, through its Assurance Services Executive Committee, initially identified and 
developed six general categories of assurance services. From this list you can get a feel for the 
breadth of activities for which assurance might be provided!
	
∙	 Risk assessment—assurance that an entity’s profile of business risks is 
comprehensive and evaluation of whether the entity has appropriate systems in place 
to effectively manage those risks.
	
∙	 Business performance measurement—assurance that an entity’s performance 
measurement system contains relevant and reliable measures for assessing the degree 
to which the entity’s goals and objectives are achieved or how its performance 
compares to that of competitors.
	
∙	 Information system reliability—assurance that an entity’s internal information 
systems provide reliable information for operating and financial decisions.
	
∙	 Electronic commerce—assurance that systems and tools used in electronic commerce 
provide appropriate data integrity, security, privacy, and reliability.
	
∙	 Health care performance measurement—assurance about the effectiveness of health 
care services provided by HMOs, hospitals, doctors, and other providers.
	
∙	 PrimePlus—assurance that specified goals regarding the elderly are being met by 
various caregivers.
To give you a better understanding of the nature of such services, this chapter’s Advanced 
Module offers a brief overview of two specific types of nonaudit attestation services devel­
oped by the AICPA over the last several years (CPA Trust Services and PrimePlus Services).

Attest Engagements
Chapter 1 of Standard for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 10 defines an attest engage­
ment as follows:
Attest services occur when a practitioner is engaged to issue or does issue an examination, a review, 
or an agreed-upon procedures report on subject matter, or an assertion about subject matter, that is 
the responsibility of another party.
LO 21-3

712	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
In this definition, practitioner refers to a certified public accountant in the practice of 
public accounting. Because attestation engagements are not audits, the attestation standards 
use the term practitioner instead of auditor. The subject matter of an attest engagement may 
take various forms, including historical or prospective performance information, analyses 
(e.g., break-even analysis), systems and processes (e.g., internal control), physical charac­
teristics (e.g., square footage of facilities), historical events (e.g., the price of market goods 
on a certain date), and behavior or actions (e.g., compliance with laws and regulations). The 
term assertion here refers to any declaration, or set of related declarations, about whether 
the subject matter is in conformity with the criteria selected. Examples of an assertion by 
management are “Gregorio’s Restaurants maintains effective internal control over financial 
reporting” and “Ticaboo Marine complies with all applicable maritime regulations.”
Stop and Think: How many parties are usually involved in attest services, and what is 
their relationship to one another?
Typically, an attestation engagement involves three parties: a user or users of information 
about which assurance is desired; a party responsible for the subject matter or the assertion, 
such as management; and a CPA. Figure 21–3 depicts the relationship among the three parties 
to an attestation engagement. Note the direction of the arrows in this figure. The responsible 
party is responsible for the subject matter or assertion to the user and acknowledges that 
responsibility to the CPA. The CPA expresses a conclusion to the user on the subject matter 
or assertion. In some cases, the engagement may involve only two parties because sometimes 
the user and the responsible party are the same.
The practitioner should use an attestation risk model to meet the standards of field­
work in an attestation engagement. Attestation risk is defined in a manner similar to audit 
risk and is composed of the same basic components as the audit risk model discussed in 
Chapter 3 (inherent risk, control risk, and detection risk). The acceptable level of attestation 
risk should be set consistent with the type of engagement being performed.
Types of Attest Engagements
Attestation standards generally provide for three types of engagements: examination, review, 
and agreed-upon procedures. The AICPA’s Statements on Standards for Attestation Engage­
ments (SSAEs) provide additional guidance on these types of engagements. The PCAOB 
adopted the SSAEs along with the rest of the AICPA’s professional standards on an interim 
basis in April 2003.

Chapter 21    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services	
713
Examination  In an examination, the accounting practitioner expresses an opinion that 
(a) the subject matter is based on (or in conformity with) the criteria in all material respects or 
(b) the assertion is presented (or fairly stated), in all material respects, based on the criteria. 
The practitioner’s opinion may be used for general or limited distribution. If distribution is 
limited, the opinion must state the limitations on the use of the report. For example, a limited 
distribution report might indicate: “This report is intended for use only by Offshore Bank.” 
Because an examination engagement provides the highest level of assurance on an assertion, 
the practitioner must gather sufficient evidence to limit the attestation risk to a low level, and 
express positive assurance, similar to an audit report. In fact, sometimes audits are referred to 
as “examinations.”
Review  In a review engagement, the practitioner does not express an affirmative opinion 
but rather expresses negative assurance. That is, the accountant indicates that no information 
came to his or her attention indicating (a) that the subject matter is not based on (or in con­
formity with) the criteria in all material respects or (b) that the assertion is not presented (or 
fairly stated), in all material respects, based on the criteria. Distribution of a review report can 
also be either general or limited. A review engagement should provide sufficient evidence to 
limit the attestation risk to a moderate level.
Agreed-Upon Procedures  An agreed-upon procedures engagement is one in which a 
practitioner is engaged by an entity to issue a report of findings based on specific procedures 
performed on the subject matter. The level of assurance provided by such an engagement 
depends on the nature and scope of the procedures that are agreed by the specified parties. 
Thus, for agreed-upon procedures engagements, acceptable attestation risk is a function of 
the intended level of assurance. Distribution of the report based on such an engagement is 
always limited to the specified users privy to the agreement. The report on an agreed-upon 
procedures engagement simply summarizes findings from the application of the agreed-upon 
procedures; it does not include an opinion.

Attestation Standards
Table 21–2 lists the 11 attestation standards and the 10 generally accepted auditing standards 
side-by-side so we can compare them easily.
General Standards
As you can see in the table, there are five general standards for attestation engagements. All 
but the second and third general standards have counterparts in generally accepted auditing 
standards. The second standard requires that the practitioner have adequate knowledge of the 
subject matter. This requirement is important because, while it is assumed that CPAs under­
stand financial statements, the subject matter of attestation engagements can take on a wide 
variety of forms, such as specific pieces of financial information, the accuracy of the vote tal­
lies in a beauty pageant, or the amount of carbon emissions from a manufacturing plant. Such

Attestation Standards Compared with Generally Accepted Auditing 
Standards
Attestation Standards
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards
General Standards
	1.	 The practitioner must have adequate technical training and proficiency 
to perform the attestation engagement.
	2.	The practitioner must have adequate knowledge of the subject matter.
	3.	The practitioner must have reason to believe that the subject matter is 
capable of evaluation against criteria that are suitable and available to 
users.
	4.	The practitioner must maintain independence in mental attitude in all 
matters relating to the engagement.
	5.	The practitioner must exercise due professional care in the planning and 
performance of the engagement and the preparation of the report.
	1.	 The audit is to be performed by a person or persons having adequate 
technical training and proficiency as an auditor.
	2.	In all matters relating to the assignment, an independence in mental 
attitude is to be maintained by the auditor or auditors.
	3.	Due professional care is to be exercised in the performance of the 
audit and the preparation of the report.
Standards of Fieldwork
	1.	 The practitioner must adequately plan the work and must properly 
supervise any assistants.
	2.	The practitioner must obtain sufficient evidence to provide a reasonable 
basis for the conclusion that is expressed in the report.
	1.	 The work is to be adequately planned and assistants, if any, are to be 
properly supervised.
	2.	A sufficient understanding of internal control is to be obtained to plan 
the audit and to determine the nature, timing, and extent of tests to be 
performed.
	3.	Sufficient appropriate evidential matter is to be obtained through 
inspection, observation, inquiries, and confirmations to afford a 
reasonable basis for an opinion regarding the financial statements 
under audit.
Standards of Reporting
	1.	 The practitioner must identify the subject matter or the assertion being 
reported on and state the character of the engagement in the report.
	2.	The practitioner must state all of the practitioner’s significant reserva­
tions about the engagement, the subject matter, and, if applicable, the 
assertion related thereto in the report.
	3.	The practitioner must state the practitioner’s conclusion about the sub­
ject matter or the assertion in relation to the criteria against which the 
subject matter was evaluated in the report.
	4.	The practitioner must state in the report that the report is intended solely 
for the information and use of the specified parties under the following 
circumstances:
• When the criteria used to evaluate the subject matter are determined 
by the practitioner to be appropriate only for a limited number of 
parties who either participated in their establishment or can be pre­
sumed to have an adequate understanding of the criteria.
• When the criteria used to evaluate the subject matter are available 
only to specified parties.
• When reporting on subject matter and a written assertion has not 
been provided by the responsible party.
• When the report is on an attestation engagement to apply agreed-
upon procedures to the subject matter.
	1.	 The report shall state whether the financial statements are presented 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).
	2.	The report shall identify those circumstances in which such principles 
have not been consistently observed in the current period in relation to 
the preceding period.
	3.	Informative disclosures in the financial statements are to be regarded 
as reasonably adequate unless otherwise stated in the report.
	4.	The report shall contain either an expression of opinion regarding the 
financial statements, taken as a whole, or an assertion to the effect 
that an opinion cannot be expressed. When an overall opinion cannot 
be expressed, the reasons therefore should be stated. In all cases 
where an auditor’s name is associated with financial statements, the 
report should contain a clear-cut indication of the character of the audi­
tor’s work, if any, and the degree of responsibility the auditor is taking.
T A B L E  2 1 – 2 
a requirement can be met by the CPA through education and practical experience. The CPA 
may also use a specialist to help meet this knowledge requirement.
The third standard is also important because it stipulates that the practitioner should per­
form the engagement only if he or she has reason to believe that the subject matter is capable 
of evaluation against criteria that are suitable and available to users. Criteria are standards 
or benchmarks used to measure and present the subject matter and against which the practi­
tioner evaluates the subject matter. Criteria can be established or developed by the entity, the 
responsible party, industry associations, or other groups, including those that do not follow 
due process procedures. With respect to attestation engagements for reporting on internal 
control for privately held companies (see discussion below), the practitioner can use criteria 
from the 2013 Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission’s docu­
ment Internal Control—Integrated Framework (the COSO Framework). Criteria can be made 

	
Chapter 21    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services	
715
available to users publicly by including the criteria in the presentation of the subject matter or 
assertion, or in the practitioner’s report. The criteria can also be such that they are available 
only to specified parties because the criteria are unique to a specific client and user.
Standards of Fieldwork
The primary difference in the standards of fieldwork between the attestation standards and 
generally accepted auditing standards is that the attestation standards do not require an under­
standing of the entity’s environment, including its internal control. Given the varied nature 
of services that can be performed under the attestation standards, such a requirement would 
be prohibitively restrictive. The approach to fieldwork for an attestation engagement should 
involve proper planning and supervision, and sufficient evidence must be gathered to provide 
a reasonable basis for the practitioner’s conclusion about the subject matter or assertion.
Standards of Reporting
As you can see in Table 21–2, reporting standards for attestation engagements differ in a num­
ber of respects from those of generally accepted auditing standards. First, in view of the wide 
variety of possible services and subject matter, the attestation standards do not make reference 
to consistent application of GAAP because the criteria involved in attestation engagements 
can vary widely depending on the subject matter. However, they do require that the report 
identify the subject matter or assertion and the type of engagement being performed. The 
reporting standards also require that the practitioner state any significant reservation about 
the engagement or presentation of the assertion. The fourth standard of reporting for attesta­
tion services lists four situations where the use of the report is restricted to specified parties, 
for example, when the attest engagement involves the application of agreed-upon procedures.
Reporting on an Entity’s Internal Control over Financial 
Reporting (ICFR)
Over the past few decades, accountants have increasingly been asked to provide attest ser­
vices on the effectiveness of an entity’s internal control. Impetus was given for such reporting 
when Congress passed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 
(FDICIA), which requires that the management of large financial institutions, whether pub­
licly or privately held, issue a report on the effectiveness of the institution’s internal control. 
The Act also requires that these institutions engage accountants to attest to management’s 
report. As discussed in Chapter 7, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 imposed similar require­
ments on all publicly held companies. While an audit of internal control is not required of 
privately held companies by law (except private financial institutions subject to FDICIA 
requirements), these companies sometimes engage an accounting firm to provide an attesta­
tion service relating to internal control.
In such cases, the practitioner should obtain from the responsible party a written asser­
tion about the effectiveness of internal control. The responsible party may present the written 
assertion in either (1) a separate report that will accompany the practitioner’s report or (2) a 
representation letter to the practitioner. When management’s assertion does not accompany 
the practitioner’s report, the first paragraph of the report should also contain a statement of 
management’s assertion.

Practice 
INSIGHT
The banking crisis of 2007–2009 is a salient and painful reminder that an organization can get a 
clean opinion on “internal controls” at a transactional or detail level and still essentially be “out of 
control” from a broader risk management perspective. Both management and auditors should take 
care not to focus so much on the details of internal control that they miss more critical strategic and 
operational risk management issues.

Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
Conditions for Conducting an Engagement Relating to ICFR
In order for the practitioner to examine management’s assertions about the effectiveness of 
internal control in an attestation engagement, the following conditions must be met:
	
∙	 Management of the entity accepts responsibility for the effectiveness of the entity’s 
internal control
	
∙	 The responsible party evaluates the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control using 
suitable criteria (referred to as control criteria)
	
∙	 Sufficient appropriate evidence exists or could be developed to support the 
responsible party’s evaluation
Criteria issued by the AICPA, regulatory agencies, and other bodies of experts that fol­
low due process qualify as control criteria. For example, management may use the criteria 
provided by COSO’s Internal Control—Integrated Framework, or COSO’s more compre­
hensive Enterprise Risk Management—Integrated Framework. Note, however, that all public 
companies in the U.S. to this point have chosen to use the COSO framework.
A practitioner is allowed to perform either of two types of attestation engagements for 
reporting on internal control: (1) examination (i.e., similar in scope and detail to an audit) or 
(2) agreed-upon procedures. The attestation standards specifically prohibit the practitioner 
from accepting an engagement to perform a review on management’s assertion relating to 
internal control.
Examination Engagement on an Entity’s ICFR
The practitioner’s objective in an engagement to examine an entity’s internal control is to 
express an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control, in all material respects, 
based on the control criteria. An engagement to examine internal control at a privately held 
company or other non-public entity must be integrated with an audit of the entity’s financial 
statements, and is conducted very similarly to the audit of internal control required of public 
companies, as described in Chapter 7.1
While performing an examination engagement relating to the entity’s internal control 
over financial reporting, the practitioner may encounter control deficiencies. Definitions of 
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses are similar in attestation and auditing stan­
dards.2 As in auditing standards, the presence of one or more material weaknesses precludes 
the practitioner from concluding that the entity has effective internal control, necessitating an 
adverse opinion on the entity’s internal control over financial reporting. If the practitioner 
identifies significant deficiencies, they should be communicated to management and to those 
charged with governance.
Finally, the practitioner should obtain written representations from management, similar 
to those listed in Chapter 7. If management refuses to provide written representations, a scope 
limitation exists.
Reporting on Management’s Assertion about Internal Control
The practitioner’s report should include the following:
	
∙	 A title that includes the word independent in describing the practitioner
	
∙	 An identification of the subject matter (internal control over financial reporting) and 
the responsible party
1Until recently, examinations of a non-public entity’s ICFR were performed under the AICPA attestation standard  
AT 501. However, because such engagements are required to be integrated with an audit of the entity’s finanical 
statements, the ASB concluded that it was appropriate to move AT section 501 into generally accepted auditing stan-
dards. Thus, examinations of non-public entities’ ICFR are now conducted under AU-C 940.
2See the definitions of control deficiency, significant deficiency, and material weakness in Chapter 7.

	
Chapter 21    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services	
717
	
∙	 A statement that the responsible party is responsible for maintaining effective internal 
control over financial reporting
	
∙	 A statement that the practitioner’s responsibility is to express an opinion on the 
effectiveness of an entity’s internal control based on his or her examination
	
∙	 A statement that the examination was conducted in accordance with the standards 
established by the AICPA
	
∙	 A statement that the practitioner believes the examination provides a reasonable basis 
for his or her opinion
	
∙	 A paragraph stating that, because of the inherent limitations of any internal control, 
misstatements due to errors or fraud may occur and not be detected
	
∙	 The practitioner’s opinion on whether the entity has maintained, in all material 
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of the specified date, 
based on control criteria
	
∙	 A statement restricting the use of the report to the specified parties (if the report’s 
distribution is to be limited)
Again, these reporting requirements are similar to those for reporting on the audit of 
internal control over financial reporting as part of an integrated audit (see Chapter 7).
Financial Forecasts and Projections
Auditors are often asked to provide assurance with respect to prospective financial state-
ments. Attestation standards (Chapter 3, SSAE No. 10) provide guidance for practitioners 
providing such services. The practitioner’s involvement may include (1) assembling or 
assisting the entity in assembling prospective financial statements or (2) reporting on pro-
spective financial statements. In either of these situations, the practitioner can enter into an 
engagement to examine, apply agreed-upon procedures, or simply compile the prospective 
financial statements.
Types of Prospective Financial Statements
Prospective financial statements contain financial information made up of either financial 
forecasts or financial projections. Financial forecasts are prospective financial statements that 
present an entity’s expected financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. They 
are based on assumptions reflecting conditions the responsible party expects to exist and the 
course of action it expects to take. Financial projections are prospective financial statements 
that present, given one or more hypothetical assumptions, an entity’s expected financial posi-
tion, results of operations, and cash flows. These assumptions may not reflect the most likely 
or expected conditions. The primary difference between the two is that a financial projection 
is based on hypothetical assumptions rather than what is actually expected and is intended to 
respond to a specific question, such as “What would happen if the company were to outsource 
its customer support operations to India?” A financial projection is sometimes prepared to 
present one or more possible courses of action for evaluation.
Prospective financial statements are for either general use or limited use. General use 
of prospective financial statements refers to the use of the statements by persons with whom 
the responsible party is not negotiating directly. An example would be an offering statement 
containing prospective financial statements for an entity’s debt or equity securities.
Stop and Think: Why are financial forecasts for general use but financial projections 
are not?
LO 21-7

718	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
Because the intended users may not be able to question the responsible party to clarify 
any hypothetical assumptions made, the only appropriate basis of presentation for general-use 
prospective financial statements is the expected results. Therefore, only a financial forecast 
can be made available for general use; financial projections are not to be made available for 
general use if an accountant’s report is involved.
Limited use of prospective financial statements refers to use of the statements by the 
responsible party alone or by the responsible party and third parties with whom the respon­
sible party is directly negotiating. Examples of limited use include negotiations for a bank 
loan, submission to a regulatory agency, or use solely within the entity. In such cases, the 
third party can question the responsible party about the prospective financial information 
and can question, understand, or even negotiate concerning the assumed conditions on 
which it is based. Thus, any type of prospective financial statement can be issued for lim­
ited use.
While the responsible party is responsible for presentation of prospective financial state­
ments, other parties, such as accountants, may assist in meeting the presentation guidelines 
specified in the attestation standards. Prospective financial statements preferably should be 
in the same format as the historical financial statements; however, they may be limited to the 
items shown in Table 21–3. A presentation that omits any item in Table 21–3 is referred to as 
a partial presentation.
Examination of Prospective Financial Statements
An examination of prospective financial statements involves four steps: (1) evaluating the 
preparation of the prospective financial statements, (2) evaluating the support underlying 
the assumptions, (3) evaluating the presentation of the prospective financial statements for 
conformity with AICPA presentation guidelines, and (4) issuing an examination report. The 
accountant should be independent, have adequate technical training and proficiency to exam­
ine prospective financial statements, and obtain sufficient evidence to issue an examination 
report. Exhibits 21–1 and 21–2 present examples of the standard examination report for a 
forecast and a projection, respectively. The only major difference between the two reports, 
aside from the description of the nature of the prospective information involved, is the para­
graph limiting distribution of the projection to specified users.
The following circumstances may require a departure from the standard examination report:
	
∙	 Departure from AICPA presentation guidelines
	
∙	 Unreasonable assumptions
	
∙	 Scope limitation
Minimum Presentation Guidelines for Prospective Financial Information*
 • Sales or gross revenues.
 • Gross profit or cost of sales.
 • Unusual or infrequently occurring items.
 • Provision for income taxes.
 • Discontinued operations or extraordinary items.
 • Income from continuing operations.
 • Net income.
 • Basic and fully diluted earnings per share.
 • Significant changes in financial position.
 • A description of what the responsible party intends the prospective financial statements to present, a statement 
that the assumptions are based on information about circumstances and conditions existing at the time the pro­
spective information was prepared, and a caveat that the prospective results may not be achieved.
 • Summary of significant assumptions.
 • Summary of significant accounting policies.
*Prospective financial statements that omit any item listed above are considered partial presentations.

Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included such procedures as we considered 
necessary to evaluate both the assumptions used by management and the preparation and presentation 
of the forecast. We believe that our examination provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the accompanying forecast is presented in conformity with guidelines for presentation 
of a forecast established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the underlying 
assumptions provide a reasonable basis for management’s forecast. However, there will usually be differ­
ences between the forecasted and actual results, because events and circumstances frequently do not 
occur as expected, and those differences may be material. We have no responsibility to update this report

Bank for the purpose of negotiating a loan to expand Hansen Company’s plant. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on the projection based on our examination.
Our examination was made in accordance with attestation standards established by the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included such procedures as we considered

In our opinion, the accompanying projection is presented in conformity with guidelines for presenta­
tion of a projection established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the underly­
ing assumptions provide a reasonable basis for management’s projection, assuming the granting of the 
requested loan for the purpose of expanding Hansen Company’s plant as described in the summary of 
significant assumptions. However, even if the loan is granted and the plant is expanded, there will likely 
be differences between the projected and actual results, because events and circumstances frequently 
do not occur as expected, and those differences may be material. We have no responsibility to update this 
report for events and circumstances occurring after the date of this report.
The accompanying projection and this report are intended solely for the information and use of Han­
sen Company and Panama City National Bank and are not intended to be and should not be used by 
anyone other than these parties.

The presence of such events can result in a report that is either qualified or adverse. A 
disclaimer may also be issued, for example in the case of a severe scope limitation.
Agreed-Upon Procedures for Prospective Financial Statements
An agreed-upon procedures engagement is significantly more limited in scope than is an 
examination. An accountant may perform an agreed-upon procedures attestation engagement 
for prospective financial statements provided attestation standards are complied with and each 
of the following applies.
	
1.	 The practitioner is independent.

720	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
	
2.	 Either (a) the party wishing to engage the practitioner is responsible for the subject 
matter, or (b) the party wishing to engage the practitioner is not responsible for the 
subject matter but is able to provide the practitioner with evidence of a third party’s 
responsibility for the subject matter.
	
3.	 The practitioner and the specified parties agree upon the procedures to be performed 
by the practitioner.
	
4.	 The specified parties take responsibility for the sufficiency of the agreed-upon 
procedures for their purposes.
	
5.	 The specific subject matter to which the procedures are to be applied is subject to 
reasonably consistent measurement.
	
6.	 Criteria to be used in the determination of findings are agreed upon between the 
practitioner and the specified parties.
	
7.	 The procedures to be applied to the specific subject matter are expected to result in 
reasonably consistent findings using the criteria.
	
8.	 Relevant evidence is expected to exist to provide a reasonable basis for expressing 
the findings in the practitioner’s report.
	
9.	 Where applicable, the practitioner and the specified parties agree on any materiality 
limits for reporting purposes.
	
10.	 Use of the report is restricted to the specified parties.
	
11.	 For agreed-upon procedures engagements on prospective financial information, the 
prospective financial statements include a summary of significant assumptions.
The accountant must satisfy the requirement that the specified users take full responsi­
bility for the sufficiency of the procedures to be performed by comparing the procedures to 
be applied to the written requirements of the specified users, discussing the procedures to be 
applied with an appropriate representative of the specified users, or reviewing relevant con­
tracts with or correspondence from the specified users.
Exhibit 21–3 presents an example of a report on the use of agreed-upon procedures. Use 
of an agreed-upon procedures report is always explicitly restricted to the users specified in the 
report, since the users explicitly “agreed upon” the procedures to be performed, while other 
parties were not part of that agreement.
Compilation of Prospective Financial Statements
A practitioner can perform a compilation of prospective financial information for a non-
public entity. A compilation of prospective financial statements involves the following:
	
∙	 Assembling, to the extent necessary, the prospective financial statements based on the 
responsible party’s assumptions
	
∙	 Performing the required compilation procedures, which include reading the 
prospective financial statements with their summaries of significant assumptions 
and accounting policies and considering whether they appear to be (1) presented in 
conformity with the attestation standards and (2) not obviously inappropriate
	
∙	 Issuing a compilation report
A practitioner should not issue a compilation report on prospective financial statements 
that exclude disclosure of the summary of significant assumptions. Exhibit 21–4 provides an 
example of a compilation report for a forecast. Note that the report explicitly indicates that the 
accountant does not offer assurance when providing a compilation service.
A practitioner may compile prospective financial statements for an entity even when he 
or she is not independent. The practitioner is also permitted to disclose the reason for the lack 
of independence, but such disclosure is not required. If the practitioner is not independent, the 
word “Independent” should not be included in the title of the report.

Board of Directors—Donnay Corporation
Board of Directors—Clinkton Company
At your request, we have performed certain agreed-upon procedures, as enumerated below, with respect 
to the forecasted balance sheet, and the related forecasted statements of income, retained earnings, and 
cash flows of Matlin Company, a subsidiary of Donnay Company, as of December 31, 2015, and for the year 
then ending. These procedures, which were agreed to by the boards of directors of Donnay Corporation 
and Clinkton Company, were performed solely to assist you in evaluating the forecast in connection with 
the sale of Matlin Company to Clinkton Company.
This agreed-upon procedures engagement was conducted in accordance with attestation standards 
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The sufficiency of these procedures 
is solely the responsibility of the specified users of the report. Consequently, we make no representation 
regarding the sufficiency of the procedures described below either for the purpose for which this report 
has been requested or for any other purpose.
The procedures and associated findings are as follows:
	
a.	 With respect to forecasted rental income, we compared the assumptions about expected demand 
for rental of the housing units to demand for similar housing units at similar rental prices in the city 
area in which Matlin Company’s housing units are located.
No exceptions were found as a result of this comparison.
	
b.	 We tested the forecast for mathematical accuracy.
The forecast was mathematically accurate.
We were not engaged to and did not conduct an examination, the objective of which would be the 
expression of an opinion on the accompanying prospective financial statements. Accordingly, we do not 
express an opinion on whether the prospective financial statements are presented in conformity with 
AICPA presentation guidelines or on whether the underlying assumptions provide a reasonable basis for 
the presentation. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our atten­
tion that would have been reported to you. Furthermore, there will usually be differences between the 
forecasted and actual results, because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, 
and those differences may be material. We have no responsibility to update this report for events and 
circumstances occurring after the date of this report.
This report is intended solely for the use of the boards of directors of Donnay Corporation and Clinkton 
Company and is not intended to be nor should be used by anyone other than these parties.

Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
Many non-public businesses do not choose to contract for an audit of their financial state­
ments. This typically occurs because the entity is small, the owner is involved in the day-to-
day operations, and there are no loan covenants or regulations requiring an audit. However, 
these entities often employ a CPA to assist with preparing their financial statements, tax 
returns, or other financial documents.
Until 1977 there was relatively little guidance on how to perform or report on engage­
ments involving unaudited financial statements. As discussed in Chapter 20, the 1136 Ten­
ants’ case involved auditors’ liability for unaudited financial statements. One outcome of this 
case was the establishment of the Accounting and Review Services Committee by the AICPA. 
This committee was designated by the AICPA to issue Statements on Standards for Account­
ing and Review Services (SSARS) in connection with services that relate to historical finan­
cial statements, but that are less extensive than a financial statement audit.
SSARS provide guidance for three types of services: preparation of financial state­
ments,  compilation of financial statements, and review of financial statements. While 
preparation and compilation are somewhat similar in scope, compilation differs signifi­
cantly from a review. The work done on a preparation, which essentially involves assisting 
a client in organizing financial information into the form of financial statements, provides 
no assurance; the accountant is required to include a legend on each page of the financial 
statements explicitly stating that no assurance is being provided. As with any other nonat­
test bookkeeping/accounting service engagement, the accountant is not required to con­
sider whether he or she is independent in performing a preparation and does not issue any 
kind of report.
A compilation engagement is similar to a preparation engagement except that a compila­
tion requires a report to be issued; a compilation report is required when financial statements 
prepared by a CPA are to be submitted to a third-party user. For a compilation engagement, 
the practitioner must be independent or must disclose in the report that she or he is not inde­
pendent. Although a compilation engagement requires independence (or disclosure of non-
independence) and involves a report, neither a preparation nor a compilation is intended to 
provide any level of assurance about the fairness of the financial statements in accordance 
with a reporting framework.
A review, on the other hand, provides the accountant with a reasonable basis for express­
ing limited assurance that no material modifications should be made to the financial state­
ments. This can be compared to an audit, in which the auditor provides an explicit, affirmative 
opinion about whether the financial statements present fairly the financial position and results 
of operations of the entity. Figure 21–4 compares the assurance provided by an audit with the 
assurance provided by a review, a compilation, and a preparation engagement.
Preparation, compilation, and review engagements performed under SSARS specifically 
apply to engagements for which the output of the service is a set of historical financial state­
ments. An accountant may provide other types of services, such as preparing a working trial 
balance; assisting in adjusting the account books; consulting on accounting, tax, and similar 
matters; preparing tax returns; and providing various manual or automated bookkeeping or 
data processing services, without having to comply with the standards for compilations and

reviews. As with an engagement to prepare (but not compile or review) financial statements, 
these types of services essentially are considered bookkeeping services for which indepen­
dence is not required and for which no report is issued.
Compilation of Financial Statements
A compilation is defined as presenting, in the form of financial statements, information that is 
the representation of management or owners without undertaking to express any assurance on 
the statements. While no assurance is provided, in conducting a compilation the accountant 
must have the following knowledge about the entity:
	
∙	 The accounting principles and practices of the industry in which the entity operates
	
∙	 A general understanding of the entity’s organization; its operating characteristics; and 
the nature of its assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses
	
∙	 An understanding of the accounting principles and practices used by the entity
Compilation standards do not require the practitioner to perform procedures to verify or 
corroborate the financial statement information provided by the client. However, the accoun­
tant must address significant questions that arise in the course of the compilation engagement. 
If the accountant has reason to believe the information supplied by the client is inaccurate, 
incomplete, or otherwise unsatisfactory, the accountant is required to obtain revised or cor­
rected information before issuing a compilation report. The compilation standards require the 
accountant to possess an adequate level of knowledge about the accounting principles and 
practices of the client’s industry and have a general understanding about the nature of the cli­
ent’s business. There are three forms of compilation reports:
	
∙	 Compilation with full disclosure
	
∙	 Compilation that omits substantially all disclosures
	
∙	 Compilation when the accountant is not independent
The report should be dated as of the completion of the compilation. Additionally, each 
page of the financial statements should be marked with a notation such as “See Accountant’s 
Compilation Report.”
Compilation with Full Disclosure  When the entity presents a set of financial statements 
that contain all necessary financial disclosures required by generally accepted accounting 
principles or another financial reporting framework, the accountant can issue a standard com­
pilation report. Exhibit 21–5 is an example of such a report.
Example of a Compilation Report with Full Disclosure
We have compiled the accompanying balance sheet for Learn Medical Services as of December 31, 2015, 
and the related statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended. We have 
not audited or reviewed the accompanying financial statements and, accordingly, do not express an opin­
ion or provide any assurance about whether the financial statements are in accordance with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for design­
ing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of 
the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to conduct the compilation in accordance with Statements on Standards for 
Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. The 
objective of a compilation is to assist management in presenting financial information in the form of finan­
cial statements without undertaking to obtain or provide any assurance that there are no material modifi­
cations that should be made to the financial statements.
E X H I B I T  2 1 – 5

724	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
Compilation That Omits Substantially All Disclosures  Sometimes an entity may 
request that the accountant compile financial statements without adding all the necessary 
disclosures (footnotes, etc.). Many times this request is made to minimize the cost of the 
engagement. The accountant can compile such financial statements so long as the omission is 
clearly indicated in the report and the entity does not intend the omission to mislead the user. 
For example, the accountant may add the following paragraph after the conclusion paragraph: 
“Management has elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures required by accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. If the omitted disclosures were 
included in the financial statements, they might influence the user’s conclusions about the 
company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Accordingly, the financial 
statements are not designed for those who are not informed about such matters.”
Compilation When the Accountant Is Not Independent  The Code of Professional 
Conduct allows an accountant to perform a compilation engagement even when he or she is 
not independent of the entity. However, the lack of independence must be disclosed in the 
report. As an example, the following sentence might be added as the last paragraph of the 
report when the accountant is not independent: “We are not independent with respect to Wah­
weap Medical Services.” Unlike when performing an audit, the accountant may also disclose 
the reason(s) that his or her independence is impaired when performing a compilation. The 
wording of such an explanation might look something like this: “We are not independent 
with respect to Wahweap Medical Services as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, 
because a member of the engagement team had a direct financial interest in Wahweap Medi­
cal Services.” If the accountant elects to disclose a description about the reasons his or her 
independence is impaired, the accountant should ensure that all reasons are completely and 
accurately included in the description.
Review of Financial Statements
A review is defined as the performance of inquiry and analytical procedures to provide the 
accountant with a reasonable basis for expressing limited assurance that no material modi­
fications should be made to the statements in order for them to conform to the applicable 
financial reporting framework (e.g., GAAP). In conducting a review, the accountant’s work 
involves the following:
	
∙	 Obtaining knowledge of the accounting principles and practices of the industry in 
which the entity operates
	
∙	 Obtaining a general understanding of the entity’s organization, its operating 
characteristics, and the nature of its assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses
	
∙	 Obtain an understanding of the accounting principles and practices used by the entity 
in measuring, recognizing, recording, and disclosing all significant accounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements
	
∙	 Asking the entity’s personnel about important matters, some examples of which are 
noted in Table 21–4
	
∙	 Performing analytical procedures to identify relationships and individual items that 
appear to be unusual (the process followed for conducting analytical procedures is 
similar to the one described for audits in Chapter 5)
	
∙	 Reading the financial statements to determine if they conform to the applicable 
financial reporting framework
	
∙	 Obtaining reports from other accountants, if any, who have audited or reviewed the 
financial statements or significant components thereof
	
∙	 Obtaining a representation letter from management (generally signed by the chief 
executive officer and chief financial officer)

	
Chapter 21    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services	
725
Note that a review engagement does not require the accountant to obtain an understand­
ing of internal control, test accounting records by performing detailed tests, or corroborate 
inquiries, as would normally be done on an audit. However, if while conducting the review the 
accountant becomes aware of information that is incorrect, incomplete, or misleading, he or 
she should perform any additional procedures necessary to provide limited assurance that no 
material modifications to the financial statements are required. Table 21–4 shows examples of 
inquiries an auditor might make in the conduct of a review engagement.
Practice 
INSIGHT
Because a review costs substantially less than an audit engagement, smaller privately held com­
panies often choose to have an annual review to satisfy requirements associated with their lines of 
credit or commercial loans if such an approach is acceptable to the company’s creditors.
Examples of Inquiries Made during a Review Engagement

	2.	Inquiries concerning the client’s procedures for recording, classifying, and summarizing accounting transactions.
	3.	Inquiries concerning actions taken at stockholders’, board of directors’, and other committee meetings.
	4.	Inquiries of persons responsible for the financial statements concerning:
 
• Whether the statements are in accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework. 
 
• Changes in the client’s business activities or accounting principles. 
 
• Any exceptions concerning other analytical procedures. 
 
• Subsequent events having a material effect on the statements.

Review Report  A standard review report assumes that the financial statements are in 
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (or another financial reporting 
framework). This includes all necessary disclosures. The review report should be dated as 
of the completion of the accountant’s inquiry and analytical procedures. Additionally, each 
page of the financial statements should contain a notation such as “See Accountant’s Review 
Report.” Exhibit 21–6 is an example of the standard review report.
Example of a Standard Review Report
We have reviewed the accompanying balance sheet of Sierra Company as of December 31, 2015, and 
the related statements of income, retained earnings, and cash flows for the year then ended. A review 
includes primarily applying analytical procedures to management’s financial data and making inquiries of 
company management. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit, the objective of which is the 
expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express 
such an opinion.
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and for design­
ing, implementing, and maintaining internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of 
the financial statements.
Our responsibility is to conduct the review in accordance with Statements on Standards for Accounting 
and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards 
require us to perform procedures to obtain limited assurance that there are no material modifications 
that should be made to the financial statements. We believe that the results of our procedures provide a 
reasonable basis for our report.
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the 
accompanying financial statements in order for them to be in conformity with accounting principles gener­
ally accepted in the United States of America.

Conditions That May Result in Modification of a Compilation or Review Report 
When the accountant conducts a compilation or review, he or she may become aware of 
situations that require modification to the standard report. Two particular situations are (1) a 
departure from generally accepted accounting principles and (2) a going concern uncer­
tainty. If there is a departure from GAAP, the departure should be disclosed in a separate 
paragraph of the report. Exhibit 21–7 is an example of a review report modified for a depar­
ture from GAAP.
If the accountant believes that there are questions concerning the continuing viability of 
the entity, the accountant should add wording similar to the following after the standard four 
paragraphs:
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will con­
tinue as a going concern. As discussed in Note x to the financial statements, the company has suf­
fered recurring losses from operations and has a net capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt 
about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to these matters are 
also described in Note x. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result 
from the outcome of this uncertainty.
The process the accountant follows in determining whether the entity is a going concern 
is similar to the process used for assessing going concern issues during an audit, discussed in 
Chapter 17.
Example of a Modified Review Report for a Departure from GAAP
[Same wording as in the first three paragraphs of the standard review report]
Based on our review, with the exception of the matter described in the following paragraph, we are 
not aware of any material modifications that should be made to the accompanying financial statements 
in order for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America.
As disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements, accounting principles generally accepted in the 
United States of America require that inventory cost consist of material, labor, and overhead. Management 
has informed us that the inventory of finished goods and work in process is stated in the accompanying 
financial statements at material and labor cost only, and that the effects of this departure from accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America on financial position, results of operations, 
and cash flows have not been determined.

Internal Auditing
Up to this point in the chapter, we have focused on nonaudit assurance and attestation services 
that are provided by public accountants. The remainder of the chapter focuses on the role of, 
standards pertaining to, and services provided by internal auditors.
The largest financial statement fraud in the history of the United States may not have 
been discovered were it not for the persistent investigative efforts of Cynthia Cooper and her 
internal audit team (see Exhibit 14–2). Cynthia Cooper, the whistle-blower of the $9 billion 
WorldCom fraud, was head of internal audit at the communications giant at the time. Despite 
being ordered by the company’s management to discontinue investigations in the areas where 
the fraud had been committed, Cooper’s team aggressively pushed ahead and eventually 
uncovered the massive fraud.
After the Enron and WorldCom frauds, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 placed increased 
emphasis on the importance of public companies’ internal audit functions, and in August 
2002 the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) required all companies wishing to trade their 
securities on the exchange to have a viable internal audit function. The role of the internal

auditor has become increasingly crucial to effective corporate governance and to the success 
of large organizations.3
Internal auditing can be a challenging, rewarding, and varied career path. Many public 
accountants who work as external auditors eventually become internal auditors, and many 
internal auditors eventually take management roles within their organizations. These oppor­
tunities arise because internal auditors are in a unique position to understand the organization 
from a perspective that is both broad and deep.
Internal Auditing Defined
The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), which oversees and sets standards for internal audit­
ing internationally, defines internal auditing as
. . . an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve 
an organization’s operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a sys­
tematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, con­
trol, and governance processes.
This definition outlines the main goals of the profession and broadly states the methods 
whereby these goals may be achieved. The IIA has issued detailed and rigorous standards for 
the practice of internal auditing; however, it states that the mission of the internal auditing 
profession is “to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objec­
tive assurance, advice, and insight.”
The Institute of Internal Auditors
Established in 1941, the IIA is an international professional association with world head­
quarters in Altamonte Springs, Florida. The IIA has over 180,000 members in 116 countries, 
specializing in internal auditing, risk management, governance, internal control, IT audit, 
education, and security. The Institute is the recognized authority, principal educator, and 
acknowledged leader in certification, research, and technological guidance for the internal 
auditing profession worldwide. The IIA offers not only the general Certified Internal Auditor 
(CIA) certification but also specialty certifications in areas including government accounting 
and financial services.
IIA Standards
The IIA’s professional guidance is organized into an International Professional Practices 
Framework. This framework consists of two categories of authoritative guidance:
Mandatory Guidance
	
∙	 Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing
	
∙	 Definition of Internal Auditing
	
∙	 International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing 
	
∙	 Code of Ethics
Strongly Recommended Guidance
	
∙	 Implementation Guidance
	
∙	 Supplemental Guidance
3Academic research confirms the importance of internal auditing. For example, a recent study indicates that high-
quality internal auditing leads to more reliable externally reported earnings. (See D. Prawitt, J. Smith, and D. Wood, 
“Internal Audit Quality and Earnings Management,” The Accounting Review, July 2009).

728	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
The mandatory guidance for IIA members consists of the Core Principles for the Profes­
sional Practice of Internal Auditing, the Definition of Internal Auditing (stated previously), 
the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and the Code 
of Ethics.
The Core Principles for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing lay out the founda­
tional characteristics of internal audit effectiveness. They are as follows: 
	
∙	 Demonstrates integrity
	
∙	 Demonstrates competence and due professional care
	
∙	 Is objective and free from undue influence (independent)
	
∙	 Aligns with the strategies, objectives, and risks of the organization
	
∙	 Is appropriately positioned and adequately resourced
	
∙	 Demonstrates quality and continuous improvement
	
∙	 Communicates effectively
	
∙	 Provides risk-based assurance
	
∙	 Is insightful, proactive, and future-focused
	
∙	 Promotes organizational improvement
The International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing are divided 
into three main areas: attribute standards, performance standards, and implementation 
standards.
Attribute standards address the characteristics of organizations and parties perform­
ing internal audit activities, and performance standards describe the nature of internal audit 
activities and provide criteria against which the performance of these services can be evalu­
ated. The standards in these two areas are similar in scope to the 10 generally accepted audit­
ing standards applicable to external auditors. Table 21–5 presents the main categories of the 
IIA’s attribute and performance standards. Given the substantial variation in internal audit 
environments across the world, attribute and performance standards are necessarily general; 
however, the third category of IIA standards, known as implementation standards, are more 
detailed, providing guidance applicable to specific types of engagements.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The IIA’s Standards require that a regular “quality assessment” be used to evaluate compliance with 
IIA standards, the internal audit activity and audit committee charters, the organization’s risk and 
control assessment, and the use of successful practices. Every internal audit function has to have 
an external quality assessment at least once every five years to be in compliance with IIA standards. 
(IIA Standard 1312).

CIA candidates who have already earned the CPA designation are eligible to receive credit for Part 
IV of the CIA exam. Proof of certification along with an application and the payment of an administra­
tive fee is required before credit is granted to the CIA candidate.
Code of Ethics
As with most reputable professions, internal auditors must follow guidelines promoting ethi­
cal conduct (see Chapter 19 for a discussion of the AICPA/PCAOB Code of Professional 
Conduct, which applies to CPAs and external auditors). The IIA Code of Ethics is important 
for internal auditors because the reliability of their work depends on a reputation for a high 
level of objectivity and personal integrity. The Code of Ethics specifies four main principles

International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing
Standard
Definition
Attribute Standards
1000—Purpose, authority, and responsibility
The purpose, authority, and responsibility of the internal audit activity must be formally defined in an 
internal audit charter, consistent with the Definition of Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, and 
the Standards. The chief audit executive must periodically review the internal audit charter and 
present it to senior management and the board for approval.
1100—Independence and objectivity
The internal audit activity must be independent, and internal auditors must be objective in 
performing their work.
1130—Impairment to independence or objectivity
If independence or objectivity is impaired in fact or appearance, the details of the impairment must 
be disclosed to appropriate parties. The nature of the disclosure will depend upon the impairment.
1200—Proficiency and due professional care
Engagements must be performed with proficiency and due professional care.

The chief audit executive must develop and maintain a quality assurance and improvement program 
that covers all aspects of the internal audit activity.
Performance Standards
2000—Managing the internal audit activity
The chief audit executive must effectively manage the internal audit activity to ensure it adds value 
to the organization.
2100—Nature of work
The internal audit activity must evaluate and contribute to the improvement of governance, risk 
management, and control processes using a systematic and disciplined approach.
2200—Engagement planning
Internal auditors must develop and document a plan for each engagement, including the 
engagement’s objectives, scope, timing, and resource allocations.
2300—Performing the engagement
Internal auditors must identify, analyze, evaluate, and document sufficient information to achieve 
the engagement’s objectives.
2400—Communicating results
Internal auditors must communicate the results of engagements.
2500—Monitoring progress
The chief audit executive must establish and maintain a system to monitor the disposition of results 
communicated to management.
2600—Communicating the acceptance of risks
When the chief audit executive concludes that management has accepted a level of risk that may be 
unacceptable to the organization, the chief audit executive must discuss the matter with senior 
management. If the chief audit executive determines that the matter has not been resolved, the 
chief audit executive must communicate the matter to the board.

Definition
Integrity
The integrity of internal auditors establishes trust and thus provides the basis for reliance on 
their judgment.
Objectivity
Internal auditors exhibit the highest level of professional objectivity in gathering, evaluating, 
and communicating information about the activity or process being examined. Internal 
auditors make a balanced assessment of all the relevant circumstances and are not unduly 
influenced by their own interests or by others in forming judgments.
Confidentiality
Internal auditors respect the value and ownership of information they receive and do not 
disclose information without appropriate authority unless there is a legal or professional 
obligation to do so.
Competency
Internal auditors apply the knowledge, skills, and experience needed in the performance of 
internal auditing services.

of ethical conduct and some associated rules that underpin the expected conduct of IIA mem­
bers: integrity, objectivity, confidentiality, and competency (Tables 21–6 and 21–7).
Internal Auditors’ Roles
Internal auditors are called “internal” because they work within an individual entity and report 
the results of their work to management or (ideally) to the entity’s audit committee or board 
of directors. They are not typically expected to report to the public or to parties outside the 

730	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
entity. However, internal audit functions differ widely in how they are managed and staffed. 
Some entities have internal audit functions that are staffed entirely “in-house,” while oth­
ers are “co-sourced.” When an organization co-sources its internal audit function, the entity 
typically hires a public accounting firm or other professional services firm to provide inter­
nal audit services in conjunction with the entity’s own internal auditors. This has become a 
significant source of revenue for many large professional services firms. Ideally the entity 
will have a chief audit executive (CAE), whose role is to oversee the internal audit function 
(whether in-house or co-sourced) and to help coordinate the work of the internal and external 
auditors. You will recall from Chapter 19, however, that SEC rules prohibit a public account­
ing firm from providing internal audit services to a public company for which the accounting 
firm also provides a financial statement audit.
The roles played by internal auditors fall into two primary categories—assurance services 
and consulting services.
Assurance services involve the internal auditor’s objective assessment of evidence to provide an 
independent opinion or conclusions regarding a process, system or other subject matter. The nature 
and scope of the assurance engagement are determined by the internal auditor. There are gener­
ally three parties involved in assurance services: (1) the person or group directly involved with the 
entity, operation, function, process, system, or other subject matter—the process owner; (2) the 
person or group making the assessment—the internal auditor; and (3) the person or group using 
the assessment—the user.
Consulting services are advisory in nature, and are generally performed at the specific request 
of an engagement client. The nature and scope of the consulting engagement are subject to agree­
ment with the engagement client. Consulting services generally involve two parties: (1) the person 
or group offering the advice—the internal auditor, and (2) the person or group seeking and receiv­
ing the advice—the engagement client. When performing consulting services the internal auditor 
should maintain objectivity and not assume management responsibility.4

In general, an organization’s internal audit function is deployed by management and the 
board of directors in the broad areas of evaluating risks and controls, evaluating compliance, 
and performing financial and operational auditing. Through these activities, internal audi­
tors contribute to effective corporate governance within an organization, which includes all 
management-administered policies and procedures to control risk and oversee operations 
within a company. The IIA and other influential organizations, such as the NYSE, identify the 
internal audit function as one of the cornerstones of effective corporate governance.
Evaluating Risks and Controls  As outlined by IIA Standard 2120, internal auditors 
are required to evaluate an entity’s risk management process. Although the internal audi­
tor’s industry expertise allows him or her to stay abreast of general industry risks, it is his or 
her specific experience within the organization that enables an accurate assessment of risks 
relating to the integrity of financial and operational information, the safeguarding of assets, 
and compliance with laws and regulations. Internal auditors are often asked to determine the 
sources of these risks and may sometimes be called on to recommend approaches to manage 
identified risks.
As we discussed in Chapter 7, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public 
companies to implement and annually assess internal control over financial reporting. Internal 
auditors have long been involved in evaluating and enhancing their organizations’ system of 
internal control over financial reporting and often play a substantial role in ensuring compli­
ance with these new requirements. By testing and assessing internal control, internal auditors 
also facilitate senior management’s ability to provide the certifications required by Section 
302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act—Corporate Responsibility for Financial Reports.
Practice 
INSIGHT
The IIA offers a Certification in Control Self-Assessment (CSA) designed for practitioners of con­
trol assessment. Professionals who hold the CSA designation include individuals from a variety of 
backgrounds. They use their knowledge about risk and controls to help their clients implement and 
maintain effective controls to achieve their objectives.
Reviewing Compliance  In many industries, compliance with relevant laws and regula­
tions is a complicated and important endeavor. For example, if a company fails to comply 
with the many requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSHA), the 
government can levy significant fines and penalties. Many other governmental agencies have 
also issued rules and regulations that must be followed by businesses and other organizations. 
Such agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Food & Drug 
Administration (FDA), among many others. Internal auditors play an important role in help­
ing management ensure that the organization complies with the laws, rules, and regulations 
that apply to the entity, as well as in ensuring that employees comply with organizational 
guidelines and rules.
Financial Auditing  Although the financial auditing performed by internal auditors 
involves many of the same concepts you have already studied in this text, it differs from the 
audits conducted by external auditors in several ways. For example, internal auditors do not 
generally audit periodic financial statements but tend to focus on specific financial issues as 
directed by management. The nature of their reporting is also different.
Stop and Think: Why might internal audit reports relating to financial auditing not fol­
low a standardized format like those of external auditors?
Because the focus of the audit may relate to either general or specific factors, it is impos­
sible to require a standardized internal audit report. Consequently, internal audit reports 

732	
Part 8    Assurance, Attestation, and Internal Auditing Services
are normally uniquely composed to fulfill the requirements of the particular assignment, as 
opposed to external audit reports, which are quite standardized. Exhibit 21–8 describes a real-
life situation where an organization’s internal auditor uncovered a fraud while evaluating a 
specific financial area at the request of the organization’s management.
Operational Auditing  Due to their unique position in an organization, internal auditors 
typically achieve a thorough understanding of how the organization operates, and internal 
auditors are thus able to provide various types of services to improve the entities in which 
they work. Operational audits serve a wide variety of purposes. They are primarily con­
ducted to identify the causes of problems or to enhance the efficiency or effectiveness of 
operations. In many organizations, internal auditors spend most of their time performing 
operational audits. In fact, because they often spend relatively little of their time performing 
financial audits, the term internal auditing is often (incorrectly) used interchangeably with 
operational auditing.
Internal Audit Product Offerings
In order to illustrate the diversity of services offered by internal auditors, refer to Figure 21–5, 
which shows how DuPont decided to deploy its internal audit resources. The figure illustrates 
two important points. First, the management of risk is the central focus of internal audit at 
DuPont. Risk management is important because a successful company must be able to not 
only deal with current problems but also anticipate and prepare for other potential obstacles. 
Second, the wheel in Figure 21–5 is not static, but contains several ongoing and interdepen­
dent processes. A modern internal audit function must be adaptable and able to keep up with 
the changing demands of the modern business environment in large and complex organiza­
tions like DuPont. Exhibit 21–9 offers a more detailed description of each of the product 
categories outlined in DuPont’s “internal audit product wheel.”
Interactions between Internal and External Auditors
The objectives and types of work performed by internal and external auditors are often quite 
different, but there is considerable overlap, as you might imagine. External auditors do their 
work with the purpose of expressing an opinion as to whether the entity’s financial statements 
are free of material misstatements. Because external auditors rely on the concept of material­
ity, they typically are not concerned with auditing a particular area in a great deal of depth—
they gather evidence until they obtain reasonable assurance that no misstatements are present 
that would be considered material in the context of the financial statements taken as a whole. 
They then report externally, to parties outside of the organization being audited.
Internal Financial Audit Uncovers Employee Fraud
At a major research university, an internal audit team was called in to facilitate required budget cuts 
in the accounting department. The accounting department was understaffed and had only one staff 
member assigned to review procurement card transactions through the accounting office for staff 
and faculty. The internal auditor quickly identified some suspicious receipts that totaled $1,200. The 
investigation led to a single employee, and eventually over four vanloads of suspected unauthorized 
purchases were removed from the employee’s home and personal vehicle. The fraud amounted to 
approximately $60,000 and led to the criminal prosecution of the suspect. The internal audit function 
saved the accounting department money immediately, but by identifying several weaknesses in the 
department’s internal control system, it no doubt improved the efficiency and effectiveness of internal 
control for the entire university.

Internal auditors, on the other hand, assist management and the board of directors in 
evaluating and managing risk, assessing compliance with laws and regulations, assessing 
operational efficiency, and performing detailed financial audits of areas requiring particular 
attention. Because their objectives are often different from those of external auditors, the level 
of materiality is usually quite different as well. For example, in auditing for employee fraud, 
the amounts involved are usually far from material in terms of the financial statements taken 
as a whole. However, internal auditors can reduce the incidence of employee fraud, saving 
money and improving controls in the process.
Some of the work performed by internal auditors is directly relevant to the work of the 
independent auditor. For example, as discussed in Chapter 7, the external auditor can some-
times make use of controls-testing work performed by the internal auditor. Similarly, Chapter 5  
briefly discusses the external auditor’s use of work performed by the internal audit function in 
the context of the financial statement audit. Before relying on the work of internal auditors, 
the external auditor must evaluate the internal auditor’s objectivity and competence. If the 
external auditor decides that some reliance is justified, the cost savings in terms of the reduc-
tion in the external audit fee can be significant.5

a determinant of external audit fees and factors influencing this contribution,“ Journal of Accounting Research,

Definitions of the Services Provided by DuPont’s Internal Auditors
Process Audits  Internal auditing undertakes comprehensive analyses and appraisals of all phases of 
business activities and provides management with appropriate recommendations concerning the activi-
ties reviewed. This product includes business process audits, which appraise the adequacy and efficiency 
of accounting, financial, and operating controls; information systems audits, which focus on technical IS 
audit activities, system implementation and application reviews; reviews of emerging technology; and 
new site reviews which occur in the early stages of start-up operations, joint ventures, or acquisitions to 
ensure that cost-effective internal control is in place.
Special Investigation  This service provides the client with an independent review of facts and circum-
stances surrounding an event or series of events and presents recommendations to management for 
appropriate resolution/action. Investigations are often associated with known or suspected wrongdoing, 
waste, fraud, abuse of company assets, other business ethics violations, and/or serious mismanagement.
System Implementation Review  System implementation reviews are conducted as part of the preven-
tion quadrant of internal auditing’s products. The system implementation review promotes the inclusion 
of cost-effective controls into systems prior to implementation and assures that the controls will operate 
as intended when implemented.
Business Process Improvement  In limited circumstances, internal auditing may initiate or participate in 
internal control-related business process improvement activities. This product is used to identify and mini-
mize control deficiencies in business processes and is designed to assist organizations in making process 
changes that result in strengthened internal control and optimal performance.
Internal Control Education  This offering assists the client organization to reduce risk through an 
enhanced understanding of the business value of internal control and business ethics. Instructional ses-
sions may be conducted by internal auditing or by the client with internal auditing support.
Internal Control Assessment  This product provides the client with an overall opinion or assessment of 
the current state of internal control and future risks. Internal control assessments are conducted periodi-
cally on a corporate, regional, SBU, and functional basis. The COSO model serves as the methodology for 
conducting these assessments.
Consulting  This is an internal auditing activity normally provided in response to a request from man-
agement. It is designed to provide expertise in the resolution of internal control issues. Consulting may 
involve answering questions, developing solutions to problems, recommending courses of action, and/
or formulating an opinion. Consulting may also involve the review of proposed procedures for internal 
control content.
Self-Assessment  Self-assessments are performed by the client based upon a framework and facilitation 
provided by internal auditing. Internal auditing will be an active participant in self-assessment activities, 
which involve an assessment of risk and control activities within the business and/or function under review.

data storage, while individuals worry about such things as the security of their information 
(such as credit card numbers). To respond to these concerns, the AICPA and the Canadian 
Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA) developed a set of principles that underlie a set 
of services called Trust Services. Trust Services are based on the Trust Services principles, 
tailored for different needs as described below. As seen in Table 21–8, Trust Services are 
built on five principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and pri­
vacy. These are broad principles that are nontechnical and easy to understand. Using these 
principles, CPAs can offer a wide variety of advisory and assurance services to their clients.
Trust Services and SOC 2 and SOC 3 Reports
In an attempt to organize and provide structure for CPAs, the AICPA has defined frameworks 
for Service Organization Control (SOC) reports. Recall in Chapter 6 we introduced the SOC 1 
report. As discussed there, when a company outsources some function to a service organiza­
tion (e.g., payroll) the controls of that service organization has the potential to directly affect 
the financial reporting of the company. In order to obtain assurance about the company’s 
financial statements, the company’s auditors need to know that controls that are relevant to 
financial reporting are in place at the service organization. Because a service organization 
usually has many clients, the service organization may decide to hire an auditor to provide a 
report on its financial controls so that the same SOC 1 report can be used by the auditors of 
several different clients. The auditor performs an engagement following AT section 801 and 
issues either a type 1 SOC 1 report on the design effectiveness of the controls of the service 
organization or a type 2 SOC 1 report, which covers both the design and operating effective­
ness of controls at the service organization.
SOC 2 reports, on the other hand, are more broadly based reports that are issued by a prac­
titioner in conjunction with a Trust Services engagement. As described in the section above, 
in a Trust Services engagement the practitioner reports if an entity (not necessarily a service 
organization) has maintained effective controls over its system with respect to Trust Services 
principles: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. SOC 2 
engagements follow the same framework outlined in TSP section 100 and AT section 101. 
Unlike SOC 1 reports, a SOC 2 report is for restricted use only (i.e., it is for use by specified 
parties). Like SOC 1 reports, a SOC 2 report allows the option of type 1 or type 2 reports. 
CPA WebTrust
Three broad categories of risk are involved in carrying out electronic commerce: business 
practices, transaction integrity, and information protection. Because commerce over the Inter­
net may involve transactions between parties who do not know each other, how can a con­
sumer know that the entity behind the web page is “real”? How can the consumer be sure that 
Trust Services Principles*
Security
  The system is protected against unauthorized access (both physical and logical).
Availability
  The system is available for operation and use as committed or agreed.
Processing Integrity
  System processing is complete, accurate, timely, and authorized.
Confidentiality
  Information designated as confidential is protected as committed or agreed.
Privacy
  The system’s collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of personal information are in accordance with the 
entity’s commitments and system requirements.

the entity follows good business practices and that consumers will not be defrauded? Simi­
larly, how can the consumer have assurance that electronic transactions will not be changed, 
lost, duplicated, or processed incorrectly? And how can the consumer be sure that private 
information will be protected? While setting up a web page on the Internet is relatively easy, 
establishing strong security controls can be complex and costly. As a result of these risks, 
consumers have legitimate concerns about transaction integrity and confidentiality. An objec­
tive third party, such as a CPA, can provide assurance to customers about these risks. The 
WebTrust seal of assurance symbolizes to potential customers that a CPA has evaluated the 
website’s business practices and controls to determine that it conforms to the principles and 
criteria. Table 21–9 presents a WebTrust criterion and related disclosures for each of two 
principles for EarthWear Clothiers.
In order to obtain the WebTrust seal of assurance, an entity must meet all the Trust Ser­
vices principles as measured by the Trust Services criteria and engage a CPA who is licensed 
by the AICPA to provide WebTrust service. Generally, this service will cover a period of 
three months or more. Once the seal is obtained, the entity can display it on its website pro­
vided the assurance examination is updated regularly and the entity informs the practitio­
ner of any significant changes in its business policies, practices, processes, or controls. The 
entity’s WebTrust seal will be managed by a trusted third-party service organization (the 
“seal manager”). If the entity receives an unqualified report, the practitioner notifies the seal 
manager that the seal can be displayed on the entity’s website and provides an expiration 
date. Unless update notification is received, the authorization to display the seal expires on 
the expiration date, and the seal manager will remove the seal’s display authorization. The 
seal displayed at the website can be verified by clicking on the seal, which displays a special 
WebTrust digital certificate.
A WebTrust assurance engagement is performed as an examination under the attestation 
standards described in this chapter. In examining an entity’s website, the practitioner would 
use guidance provided in SSAE No. 10 and COSO’s Internal Control—Integrated Frame­
work. In such an examination, the practitioner expresses a positive opinion as to whether the 
presentation of assertions conforms to the AICPA’s Trust Services principles and criteria. 
Exhibit 21–10 presents EarthWear’s management’s assertions about its website. The report of 
management’s assertions is signed by the president and CEO and the chief financial officer. 
Exhibit 21–11 contains a public accounting firm’s unqualified report on those assertions. 
Note that because EarthWear is a publicly traded company and a WebTrust attestation service 
involves reporting on internal control, independence considerations prohibit the company’s 
Selected WebTrust Criteria for EarthWear Clothiers
Processing Integrity

EarthWear Clothiers, on its website for electronic commerce (at www.mhhe.com/earthwear), asserts the 
following:
 • We have maintained effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that customers’ orders 
placed using e-commerce were completed and billed as agreed; and
 • We have maintained effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that private customer infor­
mation obtained as a result of e-commerce was protected from uses not related to our business 
during the period from December 16, 2015, through March 15, 2016, in conformity with the AICPA

Accountant’s WebTrust Attestation Report for EarthWear’s Website
To the Management of EarthWear Clothiers:
We have examined the assertion by the management of EarthWear Clothiers regarding the effec­
tiveness of its controls over transaction integrity and information protection for e-commerce (at 
www.mhhe.com/earthwear) based on the AICPA/CICA WebTrust Criteria during the period from December 
16, 2015, through March 15, 2016.
These e-commerce disclosures and controls are the responsibility of EarthWear Clothiers manage­
ment. Our responsibility is to express an opinion based on our examination.
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the 
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and, accordingly, included: (1) obtaining an understand­
ing of the EarthWear Clothier’s e-commerce business and information privacy practices and its controls 
over the processing of e-commerce transactions and the protection of related private customer informa­
tion; (2) selectively testing transactions executed in accordance with disclosed business and information 
privacy practices; (3) testing and evaluating the operating effectiveness of the controls; and (4) performing 
such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination 
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Because of inherent limitations in controls, errors or fraud may occur and not be detected. Further­
more, the projection of any conclusions, based on our findings, to future periods is subject to the risk that: 
(1) changes made to the system or controls, (2) changes in processing requirements, (3) changes required 
because of the passage of time, or (4) the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may alter 
the validity of such conclusions.
In our opinion, during the period from December 16, 2015, to March 15, 2016, EarthWear Clothiers, in 
all material respects
 • maintained effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that customers’ orders placed using 
e-commerce were completed and billed as agreed, and
 • maintained effective controls to provide reasonable assurance that private customer information 
obtained as a result of e-commerce was protected from uses not related to the company’s business 
based on the AICPA/CICA WebTrust Criteria.
The CPA WebTrust Seal of assurance on EarthWear Clothiers’ website for e-commerce constitutes a 
symbolic representation of the contents of this report and it is not intended, nor should it be construed, to 
update this report or provide any additional assurance.
This report does not include any representation as to the quality of the EarthWear Clothiers’ goods or 
services nor their suitability for any customer’s intended purpose.

financial statement auditor, Willis & Adams, from providing a WebTrust attestation service 
to the company (see Chapter 19). Thus, EarthWear engaged another accounting firm, Felix & 
Waller, CPAs, to provide the service.
The first paragraph of the Felix & Waller report states that the assertions have been exam­
ined. The second paragraph states that management is responsible for the assertions while 
the accountant’s responsibility is to express an opinion based on the examination. The third 
paragraph states the four steps that were undertaken to complete the examination of manage­
ment’s assertions. In particular, Felix & Waller (1) obtained an understanding of EarthWear’s 
e-commerce business and information privacy practices and its controls over the process­
ing of e-commerce transactions and the protection of related private customer information; 
(2) selectively tested transactions executed in accordance with the disclosed business and 
information privacy practices; (3) tested and evaluated the operating effectiveness of the con­
trols; and (4) performed other procedures that it considered necessary. The opinion paragraph 
provides an unqualified opinion on EarthWear’s management’s assertions.
CPA PrimePlus Services
The population in the United States and Canada is aging, and individuals are often living to 
ages at which they require some form of assisted living. The U.S. Census Bureau estimates 
that as of 2010, 18.5 million people in the United States were 75 years of age or older and 
they controlled many trillions of dollars in wealth. At the same time, younger generations 
are increasingly mobile. In many of these younger families, both spouses work outside the 
home, and they do not have adequate time to care for elderly relatives. The CPA can bring 
a level of assurance or comfort to the elderly person and his or her family members through 
PrimePlus services.
PrimePlus services are defined on the AICPA’s website as:
A unique, customizable package of services offered by Certified Public Accountants to assist the 
elderly in maintaining—for as long as possible—their lifestyle and financial independence. Prac­
titioners who provide PrimePlus Services draw upon their strengths and competencies in a variety 
of areas, including cash flow planning and budgeting, pre- and post-retirement planning, insurance 
reviews and tax planning … the services included in each individual PrimePlus engagement will 
be based upon the needs and wants of each PrimePlus client as well as the skill set of the Prime­
Plus practitioner.
The practitioner acts in the place of the absent family members and relies on qualified 
specialists, employed by the client or the responsible family member, to provide the services 
outside the scope of the practitioner’s expertise. The practitioner observes and reports on 
whether those service providers are meeting the needs of the client and the criteria for care 
established by the family members. This service is often combined with traditional finan­
cial services, and the practitioner often establishes strategic alliances with other professionals 
(e.g., elder law attorneys, geriatric care managers, and social workers or medical personnel).
Practitioners can offer three types of PrimePlus services. The first is consulting/
facilitating services, which involve the practitioner consulting with the client or third party 
(the responsible individual) to establish the standards of care expected. Consulting services 
might also include assisting the client or third party in selecting the care provider and level 
of care for each type of care required. The second category of PrimePlus service is known 
as direct services. For example, the practitioner might receive, deposit, and account for the 
individual’s income; pay bills and conduct routine financial transactions for the client; and 
supervise investments and accounting for the estate. The third category of PrimePlus service 
is assurance services. In this type of service, the practitioner issues periodic reports about the 
quality of care provided to the elderly person. PrimePlus assurance services are conducted as 
agreed-upon procedures in attestation engagements as described in this chapter. This type of 
assurance service may involve the practitioner visiting the elderly person and inspecting docu­
mentation such as logs, diaries, or other evidence to support that the contracted services have 
been provided at the appropriate level of care.

We have examined the accompanying projected balance sheet and statements of income,

In our opinion, the accompanying forecast is presented in conformity with guidelines 
for presentation of a forecast established by the American Institute of Certified Public

projection. However, there will usually be differences between the projected and actual 
results because events and circumstances frequently do not occur as expected, and those

has a material direct financial interest. Ajax decided to omit substantially all of the 
disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles because the financial 
statements will be for management’s use only. The statement of cash flows was also 
omitted because management does not believe it to be a useful financial statement.
To the Board of Directors of Ajax Company:
I have compiled the accompanying financial statements of Ajax Company as of 
September 30,  2015, and for the year then ended. I planned and performed the compila­
tion to obtain limited assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatements.
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining internal control rel­
evant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements.
My responsibility is to conduct the compilation in accordance with Statements on Stan­
dards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants. It is substantially less in scope than an audit in accordance with gen­
erally accepted auditing standards, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion 
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. I have not audited the accompanying 
financial statements and, accordingly, do not express any opinion on them.
Management has elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures required by 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. If the omit­
ted disclosures were included in the financial statements, they might influence the user’s 
conclusions about the company’s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.
I am not independent with respect to Ajax Company. This lack of independence is due 
to my daughter’s ownership of a material direct financial interest in Ajax Company.
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the board of directors and 
management of Ajax Company and should not be used for any other purpose.

Jordan & Stone, CPAs, audited the financial statements of Tech Company, a non-
public entity, for the year ended December 31, 2014, and expressed an unmodified 
opinion. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Tech issued comparative financial 
statements. Jordan & Stone reviewed Tech’s 2015 financial statements, and Kent, an 
assistant on the engagement, drafted the following accountant’s review report. Land, 
the engagement supervisor, decided not to reissue the prior year’s auditor’s report 
but instructed Kent to include a separate paragraph in the current year’s review 
report describing the responsibility assumed for the prior year’s audited financial 
statements. This is an appropriate reporting procedure.
	
	
	 	
Land reviewed Kent’s draft and indicated in the supervisor’s review notes (shown 
following the accountant’s review report) that there were several deficiencies in 
Kent’s draft.
Accountant’s Review Report
	
	
	 We have reviewed the accompanying balance sheet of Tech Company as of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related statements of income, retained earn­
ings, and cash flows for the year then ended. A review includes primarily applying 
analytical procedures to management’s financial data and making inquiries of com­
pany management. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit, the objective 
of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements as a whole.
	
	
	 	
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the 
financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted 
in the United States of America and for designing, implementing, and maintaining 
internal control relevant to the preparation and fair presentation of the financial 
statements.
	
	
	 	
Our responsibility is to conduct the review in accordance with Statements on 
Standards for Accounting and Review Services issued by the American Institute 
of Certified Public Accountants. Those standards require us to perform procedures 
to obtain limited assurance that there are no material modifications that should be 
made to the financial statements. We believe that the results of our procedures pro­
vide a reasonable basis for our report.
	
	
	 	
Based on our review, we are not aware of any material modifications that should 
be made to the accompanying financial statements. Because of the inherent limita­
tions of a review engagement, this report is intended for the information of manage­
ment and should not be used for any other purpose.
	
	
	 	
The financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, were audited by 
us, and our report was dated March 2, 2015. We have no responsibility for updating 
that report for events and circumstances occurring after that date.
Required:
	
	
	 Items 1 through 13 represent deficiencies noted by Land. For each deficiency, indi­
cate whether Land is correct (C) or incorrect (I) in the criticism of Kent’s draft.

PMG LLP, one of the four largest international public accounting firms, 
launched an initiative in 2009 to enhance the professional judgment and 
professional skepticism of its people and teams. KPMG collaborated with 
two professors at Brigham Young University, Professors Steve Glover and Doug 
Prawitt, to emphasize these skills in its training. The result of this effort is re-
freshed professional judgment content throughout KPMG’s audit training cur-
riculum for all levels of audit professionals.
KPMG took the additional step of sharing and leveraging its professional 
judgment training content to create, again in collaboration with Brigham Young 
University Professors Glover and Prawitt, a monograph to help students accel-
erate the development of their professional judgment while still in college. The 
monograph is titled Elevating Professional Judgment in Auditing and Account-
ing: The KPMG Professional Judgment Framework. That monograph is avail-
able free of charge for college students and professors on KPMG’s University 
Connection (university.kpmg.us). It is only available in electronic form because 
it comes as a pdf, with live internet links and audio files embedded. In addition, 
there are video files and an instructor’s manual available separately to profes-
sors who register on KPMG University Connection.
This Professional Judgment Module is adapted from the KPMG Elevating 
Professional Judgment in Auditing and Accounting monograph. It covers some 
of the topics that are discussed and illustrated in more depth in the monograph. 
This module can be used as an introductory overview for the monograph or as 
a brief introduction to professional judgment for those who do not have space 
in the curriculum to assign the full monograph.
The KPMG Professional Judgment Framework, from which this module is 
adapted with permission from KPMG, LLP, was awarded the 2013 American  
Accounting Association/Deloitte Wildman Award. The Wildman award, first 
presented in 1979, recognizes a work that the judges view as “the most sig-
nificant contribution to the advancement of the practice of public accountancy” 
published within the most recent five years.

APPENDIX

	
Appendix    Advanced Module: Professional Judgment Framework	
749
As you prepare for a professional career, have you ever wondered what characteristics distin­
guish an exceptional professional from one who is just average? One key distinguishing feature 
is the ability to consistently make high-quality professional judgments. Professional judgment, 
which is the bedrock of the accounting and auditing professions, is referenced throughout the 
professional literature. In some of your accounting or auditing classes, you may have had an 
instructor respond to a question with the classic answer, “That depends; it is a matter of profes­
sional judgment.” This is often true in auditing, but it is not overly satisfying to a student who 
wonders exactly what good professional judgment looks like, or how he or she can develop the 
ability to make good professional judgments. The purpose of this module is to provide a very 
brief overview and introduction to help you understand what a good professional judgment 
process looks like, make you aware of common threats to exercising good judgment, and give 
you a head start in developing and improving your own professional judgment abilities.
A common question people have is, “Can you really teach good judgment?” Many 
believe that it is a gift; either you have it or you do not. Others would say you cannot teach 
good judgment; rather, it must be developed through the “school of hard knocks” after many 
years of experience. There is no question that talent and experience are important components 
of effective professional judgment, but it is possible to enhance your professional judgment 
skills through learning and applying some key concepts. As with other important skills, the 
sooner you start learning how to make good professional judgments, the better—which is why 
KPMG made a very significant investment of time and resources to produce the monograph 
from which this module is adapted to help the next generation of professionals get a head start 
on developing professional judgment.
Research in the areas of judgment and decision making over the last few decades indicates 
that additional knowledge about common threats to good judgment, together with tools and pro­
cesses for making good judgments, can improve the professional judgment abilities of both new 
and seasoned professionals. With the movement in financial reporting toward more principles-
based standards and more fair value measurements, exercising good professional judgment is 
increasingly important for auditors. While this module contains a brief overview of some of the 
most important topics, KPMG’s full monograph contains considerably more in-depth informa­
tion about professional judgment in auditing, including additional coverage of judgment traps 
and biases, judgment in groups, and other topics. That monograph is titled Elevating Profes­
sional Judgment in Auditing and Accounting: The KPMG Professional Judgment Framework; 
it is available without charge at under the Professional Judgment tab at university.kpmg.us.
A Model of a Good Judgment Process
Let’s start with a common definition of judgment: Judgment is the process of reaching a deci­
sion or drawing a conclusion where there are a number of possible alternative solutions.1 
Judgment occurs in a setting of uncertainty and risk. In the areas of auditing and accounting, 
judgment is typically exercised in the following three broad areas:
	
∙	 Evaluating evidence (e.g., deciding whether the evidence obtained from 
confirmations, combined with other audit evidence, provides sufficient appropriate 
audit evidence to determine whether accounts receivable is fairly stated)
	
∙	 Estimating probabilities (e.g., determining whether the probability-weighted cash flows 
used by a company to determine the recoverability of long-lived assets are reasonable)
	
∙	 Deciding between options (e.g., choosing audit procedure, such as inquiry of 
management, inspection, or confirmation)
The Importance of Professional Judgment in Auditing
1Making judgments can be distinguished from making decisions. Decision making involves the act of choosing among 
options or alternatives, while judgment, according to Webster’s 11th, involves “the process of forming an opinion or 
evaluation by discerning and comparing.” Thus, judgment is a subset of the process of decision making—many judg­
ments are typically made in coming to a decision. However, for simplicity in this module, we often refer to the com­
bined processes of judgment and decision making as “judgment,” “professional judgment,” or “making judgments.”

750	
Appendix    Advanced Module: Professional Judgment Framework
Of course, we do not need to invest significant time or effort when making easy or trivial 
judgments. However, as the judgments become more important and more difficult, it is help­
ful to have a reliable, tested framework to help guide our judgment process. KPMG’s Profes­
sional Judgment Framework is an example of such a framework. Following a good process 
will not make hard judgments easy or always guarantee a good outcome, but a well-grounded 
process can improve the quality of judgments and help auditing professionals more effectively 
navigate through complexity and uncertainty.
In the figure below, you will see the KPMG Professional Judgment Framework. The 
Framework includes a number of components, such as mindset, consultation, knowledge and 
professional standards, influences and biases, reflection, and coaching. At the core of the 
Framework, you will see a five-step judgment process.
Take a moment to examine the steps in the process at the center of the framework. These 
steps are rather simple and intuitive. However, while the KPMG Professional Judgment 
Framework provides a good representation of the process we should follow when applying 
professional judgment, it is not necessarily an accurate representation of the processes people 
follow consistently. The reality is that in a world of pressure, time constraints, and limited 
capacity, there are a number of judgment traps we can fall into. In addition, we can be subject 
to biases caused by self-interest or by unknowingly applying mental shortcuts.
The Professional Judgment Framework depicts constraints, influences, and biases that 
threaten good judgment with the box on the outer rim of the Framework labeled “Environment”

and the triangle at the top labeled “Influences/Biases.” At the bottom of the Professional 
Judgment Framework, you will see Knowledge and Professional Standards, as these factors 
are foundational to quality judgments. These are environmental influences that can affect pro­
fessional judgment. The “ribbon” of coaching and reflection running through the Framework 
is of great importance to the development of professional judgment in young professionals. 
In the next section of this module, we will highlight common judgment tendencies and the 
associated biases that can influence auditor judgment.
At the very center of the KPMG framework is “mindset.” It is important that auditors 
approach matters objectively and independently, with inquiring and incisive minds. Profes­
sional skepticism, which is required by professional auditing standards, is an objective attitude 
that includes a questioning mind and a critical assessment of audit evidence. Professional skep­
ticism is not synonymous with professional judgment, but rather, it is an important component 
or subset of professional judgment. Professional skepticism helps to frame our “mindset.”
Finally, wrapping around “mindset” in the Framework is “consultation.” At professional 
services firms like KPMG, consultation with others, including engagement team members, 
specialists, or other professionals, is a vital part of maintaining consistently high judgment 
quality and enhancing the exercise of appropriate professional skepticism.
Traps that Catch Us in the Early Steps of the Judgment Process
As we mentioned earlier, in reality people often do not follow a good process due to com­
mon judgment traps and tendencies that can lead to bias. These traps and tendencies are 
systematic—in other words, they are common to most people, and they are predictable. 
Some of these tendencies are judgment “shortcuts” that help simplify a complex world and 
facilitate more efficient judgments. These shortcuts are usually quite effective, but because 
they are shortcuts, they can lead to systematically biased judgments. As a simple illustra­
tion of how our mental processes that normally serve us very well can sometimes lead to 
bias, consider “optical illusions” you may have seen on the internet.2 Our eyes and related 
perceptual skills ordinarily are quite good at perceiving and helping us to accurately judge 
shape similarity. However, optical illusions can predictably and systematically fool our eyes. 
Just as with perceptual biases, there are times when our intuitive judgment falls prey to sys­
tematic traps and biases. Research provides convincing evidence that even the smartest and 
most experienced people similarly fall into predictable judgment traps and biases.
The “Rush to Solve.” One of the most common judgment traps is the tendency to want 
to immediately solve a problem by making a quick judgment. As a result, we under-invest 
in the important early steps in the judgment process and often go with the first workable 
alternative that comes to mind or that is presented. As a result of the rush-to-solve trap, 
we sometimes end up solving the wrong problem, or we settle for a suboptimal outcome 
because we did not consider a full set of alternatives.
Solving the Wrong Problem. Consider the following example. Two snack food compa­
nies are competing for market share—let’s call them Ax Snack Company and Bobb Good­
ies Inc. Bobb’s executives were convinced that Ax’s competitive advantage was attributable 
to the company’s distinctive, highly recognizable individual snack packaging design. The 
individual snack packages seemed to draw customers to the products. So, Bobb’s executives 
determined that to gain market share, they would need to develop individual package designs 
that were equally distinctive. They spent millions on improved packaging appearance for their 
snack foods to compete against Ax’s distinctive packaging. When increased market share did 
not follow, Bobb’s executive team realized that they knew relatively little about what custom­
ers really wanted and what drove the consumption of their snack foods. Bobb’s executives 
decided to conduct market research, and along the way, they discovered an important and 
somewhat unexpected aspect of consumer behavior: regardless of the quantity of product they 
placed in a home, it would be consumed in relatively short order. Thus, Bobb’s executives 
2KPMG’s Professional Judgment student monograph contains illustrations, audio files, and links to Internet files that 
vividly illustrate many of the concepts introduced in this module.

752	
Appendix    Advanced Module: Professional Judgment Framework
clarified the decision problem as “how to get larger quantities of snack products into consum­
ers’ homes.” Accordingly, they focused less on the appearance of individual snack packages 
and instead introduced bulk packaging that made it easier and more convenient to get more 
snacks into consumers’ homes. The resulting gain in market share was dramatic.
This example illustrates one of the biggest traps we run into during the first couple of 
steps of the judgment process, which is under-investing in defining the fundamental issue. In 
the example above, Ax Snack Company’s distinctive packaging functioned as what could be 
called a “judgment trigger,” or an assumed or inherited issue that can lead the decision maker 
to skip the crucial early steps in the judgment process. It caused Bobb Goodies’ executives 
to focus, at first, on the wrong issue or problem. Judgment triggers can often be recognized 
when a particular alternative is used to define the problem in place of a well thought-out prob­
lem definition. Often, the trigger comes from the way others have defined the issue, which 
is often formulated in terms of one potential solution. Alternatively, we may create triggers 
ourselves because we are in such a hurry to “solve” or to be decisive. Judgment triggers often 
lead to judgments made on incomplete facts or understandings.
How might you overcome the very common trap of skipping the first couple of elements 
in the judgment process that comes about through the rush to solve or through judgment 
triggers? The answer is to ask “what” and “why” questions. For example, you might initially 
answer a “what” question regarding retirement goals with, “I want to have a certain amount 
of money in a retirement fund.” That certainly is a worthy objective, but as with many ini­
tial objectives, it is only a means to an end. Following up by asking why you want a certain 
amount of money can help you uncover the more fundamental objective, which might be 
something like, “to maintain a high quality of life in retirement.” Note that by clarifying 
the objective in this way, a number of additional approaches to achieving a high quality of life 
come to mind (such as good health, no debt, cost of living, location, availability of outdoor 
recreation, etc.). Carefully clarifying underlying objectives by asking “why” is a key step in 
making important judgments.
It often does not take a lot of time to consider the first step in the judgment process, but 
the more important the judgment, the more important it is to invest in clarifying the funda­
mental issues and objectives. A little extra investment in clarifying the issue and objectives 
will almost always pay off, sometimes in a big way. One very powerful way to improve your 
professional judgment is to make sure you are not accepting a judgment trigger in place of a 
solid problem definition, but rather that you are taking time to ensure your problem definition 
is complete and correct.
Professional Skepticism and “Judgment Framing”
At the core of an auditor’s ability to effectively question a client’s accounting choices is a fun­
damental but powerful concept called “judgment framing.” This concept relates to the early 
steps in the judgment process. The definition of framing follows: Frames are mental struc­
tures that we use, usually subconsciously, to simplify, organize, and guide our understanding 
of a situation. They shape our perspectives and determine the information that we will see as 
relevant or irrelevant, important or unimportant. Frames are a necessary aspect of judgment, 
but it is important to realize that our judgment frames provide only one particular perspective. 
This is similar to looking out one window of your home—it provides one view that might be 
quite different from the view through another window.
Frames are necessary and helpful, but the problem is that we often are not aware of the 
perspective or frame we are using. Also, our frame can blind us to the fact that there are other 
valid perspectives. In other words, frames help us make sense of things but they also make it 
difficult for us to see other views. By being proactive in our use of judgment frames, we can 
improve how well we do with the initial steps in the judgment process: clarifying issues and 
objectives and considering alternatives. This is important because a distinguishing charac­
teristic of professionals who consistently exercise sound judgment is that they recognize the 
judgment frame they are using, and they are able to consider the situation through different 
frames, or what KPMG professionals refer to as a “fresh lens.” Sounds simple enough, but it 

	
Appendix    Advanced Module: Professional Judgment Framework	
753
is not always easy to do! The concept of judgment framing is important because appropriately 
questioning management’s perspective by viewing the situation through other frames is fun­
damental to professional skepticism.
For example, suppose the results of a substantive analytical procedure suggest that a cli­
ent’s allowance for doubtful accounts is understated. The auditor’s approach to gathering fur­
ther audit evidence will be different if the results are framed in the context of a change in 
business conditions or a change in the client’s credit policy as compared to an indicator of a 
likely error. This is not to say one frame is necessarily better than the other, but the auditor can 
boost his or her professional skepticism by considering both frames.
A key characteristic of those who make high-quality judgments is that they are frame-
aware. They know how to seek and consider different frames to get a fuller picture of the 
situation. Seasoned, experienced auditors develop this ability and apply it in situations where 
they need to help client management see an alternative viewpoint on an important account­
ing issue. For example, an alternative frame that auditors might use could be an investor or 
analyst perspective, or a regulator perspective. Or it might be a “hindsight” perspective—in 
other words, how will management’s judgment look if a regulator later questions it, or if it is 
reported in the press in six months? While experienced auditors are typically quite skilled at 
challenging frames and considering issues from different perspectives, this is an area where 
auditors entering the profession typically need improvement.
The Center for Audit Quality (CAQ), in its 2010 report on Deterring and Detecting Financial Reporting 
Fraud, indicates that “skepticism—a questioning mindset and an attitude that withholds judgment until 
evidence is adequate— promotes risk awareness and is inherently an enemy of fraud.” The report lists the 
following characteristics of skepticism.
 • Questioning Mind—A disposition to inquiry, with some sense of doubt
 • Suspension of Judgment—Withholding judgment until appropriate evidence is obtained
 • Search for Knowledge—A desire to investigate beyond the obvious, with a desire to corroborate
 • Interpersonal Understanding—Recognition that people’s motivations and perceptions can lead 
them to provide biased or misleading information
 • Autonomy—The self-direction, moral independence, and conviction to decide for oneself, rather 
than accepting the claims of others
 • Self-Esteem—The self-confidence to resist persuasion and to challenge assumptions or conclusions

& Theory, May 2010, Vol. 29, No. 1, pp. 149–171.
Judgment Tendencies that Can Result in Bias
Peoples’ judgments can be unintentionally biased due to underlying self-interest or because 
they unknowingly use mental shortcuts. For the most part, the shortcuts we use are efficient 
and often effective, but in certain situations, they can result in systematic, predictable bias. 
Keep in mind that the tendencies or shortcuts we will discuss are simplifying judgment strate­
gies or rules of thumb that we have unknowingly developed over time to help us cope with 
the complex environments in which we operate. They are efficient and often effective, but 
because they are shortcuts, they can lead to lower-quality judgment in some situations. Here’s 
a quick example of a simplifying shortcut. When crossing a city street, say in New York 
City, some people don’t wait until they get a “walk” sign; rather, they move through intersec­
tions by quickly looking to the left for oncoming traffic. If the coast is clear, they will take 
a step out into the street and then look to the right for traffic coming the other way. This is a 
very efficient and often effective shortcut strategy. Over time, it can become an unconscious, 
automatic part of how people cross the street in a busy city. However, if we were to use this 
shortcut strategy in London, where they drive on the other side of the street, it could result in 
a very bad outcome. Even in New York City, the shortcut can lead to a bad outcome if applied 
to all streets, since there are one-way streets that come from the other direction.

754	
Appendix    Advanced Module: Professional Judgment Framework
Similarly, the judgment shortcuts we commonly use are efficient and generally effective. 
However, there are situations where the use of a shortcut can predictably result in a lower 
quality or biased judgment. The good news is that once we understand the implications of a 
shortcut, we can devise ways to mitigate potential bias resulting from the shortcut. When it 
comes to crossing the street in London, transportation officials have devised rather ingenious 
ways to reduce the potentially serious consequences of using the “American” shortcut to start 
across the street looking first only to the left. They have placed signs on the sidewalk, on sign­
posts, and even on the street, reminding visiting pedestrians of the direction of traffic flow. 
The signs are an attempt to get visitors out of the subconscious shortcut mode and apply more 
formal thinking, which is pretty important for the well-being of American tourists in London.
We will briefly introduce four common judgment tendencies that are most applicable and 
important for audit professionals: the availability tendency, the confirmation tendency, the 
overconfidence tendency, and the anchoring tendency.
The availability tendency is defined as: The tendency for decision makers to consider 
information that is easily retrievable from memory as being more likely, more relevant, and 
more important for a judgment.
In other words, the information that is most “available” to our memory may unduly influ­
ence estimates, probability assessments, and other professional judgments. Like other mental 
shortcuts, the availability tendency often serves us well, but it has been shown to introduce 
bias into business and audit judgments. For example, an auditor may be inclined to follow the 
approach used in a prior period or on a recent engagement even if the approach is not the best 
for the current engagement. This tendency is especially powerful if the approach worked well 
on the prior engagement.
The confirmation tendency is defined as: The tendency for decision makers to seek for 
and put more weight on information that is consistent with their initial beliefs or preferences.
You may have heard the old joke, “My mind is made up; don’t confuse me with the 
facts!” Hundreds of years ago, leading philosophers recognized that once people have adopted 
a preference or an opinion, they tend to consider and gather information that supports and 
agrees with their preference. Research in psychology backs this up: people tend to seek con­
firmatory evidence, rather than looking for something inconsistent with their opinions or pref­
erences. After receiving this confirmatory evidence, decision makers often are confident that 
they have adequate evidence to support their belief. The more confirmatory evidence they are 
able to accumulate, the more confident they become. However, in many instances, we cannot 
know something to be true unless we explicitly consider how and why it may be false. As an 
example of the confirmation bias in auditing, research and reviews of working papers find that 
auditors may be prone to overrely on management’s explanation for a significant difference 
between the auditor’s expectation and management’s recorded value, even when the client’s 
explanation is inadequate.
The overconfidence tendency is defined as: The tendency for decision makers to overes­
timate their own abilities to perform tasks or to make accurate diagnoses or other judgments 
and decisions.
When groups of people are asked to assess their own abilities, whether in auditing or in 
driving a car, a majority of the participants assess themselves as above average relative to the 
group being surveyed. But, of course, it is not possible for all participants to be above aver­
age. This is a simple illustration of the fact that many of us are overconfident in our abilities 
and, as a result, we often tend not to acknowledge the actual uncertainty that exists. Over­
confidence is a subconscious tendency that results from personal motivations or self-interest. 
Importantly, this tendency to be more confident than is justified is likely to affect us even 
when we are doing our best to be objective. Research indicates that many people, including 
very experienced professionals, are consistently overconfident when attempting to estimate 
outcomes or likelihoods. Studies involving practicing auditors demonstrate that auditors may 
be overconfident in their technical knowledge and their competence in auditing risky areas. 
In addition, partners and managers may be overly confident in the ability of less experienced 
people in completing complex tasks. Conversely, associates and senior associates may be 
overconfident in the competency of more experienced auditors to complete lower-level tasks

that they aren’t accustomed to performing on a regular basis. Such overconfidence can lead 
to a variety of suboptimal outcomes in auditing, including neglecting to ask for needed help 
or guidance, failing to acquire needed knowledge, poor task performance, budget overruns, 
assignment of audit tasks to underqualified subordinates, and underreview of subordinates’ 
working papers.
The anchoring tendency is defined as: The tendency of decision makers to make assess­
ments by starting from an initial numerical value and then to adjust insufficiently away from 
that initial value in forming a final judgment.
To illustrate the anchoring tendency, managers often make salary decisions by adjust­
ing from the starting point of an employee’s previous salary. A prospective employer might 
quickly realize the unreasonableness of the anchor (e.g., her previous employer only paid her 
$48,000 before she earned an MBA degree), but proposes a starting salary irrationally close to 
the starting point, or anchor. So, in this example, the job applicant is likely to receive a lower 
salary offer if the prospective employer knows her salary before she earned her MBA. There 
are two components of anchoring and adjustment—the tendency to anchor on an initial value 
and the tendency to make adjustments away from that initial value that are smaller than what 
is actually justified by the situation. The anchoring tendency clearly has direct relevance to 
auditing in many settings. For example, management’s estimate or unaudited account balance 
can serve as an anchor. The auditor is charged with objectively assessing the fairness of an 
account balance. But if his or her judgments are influenced by the amount asserted by man­
agement in an unaudited account balance, that objectivity might be compromised. In other 
words, the auditor might become anchored to management’s estimate.
Mitigating the Effects of Judgment Biases
The most important step in avoiding judgment traps and reducing bias caused by subcon­
scious mental shortcuts or self-interest is “awareness.” By better understanding traps and 
biases, and recognizing common situations where they are likely to present themselves, we 
can identify potential problems and often formulate logical steps to improve our judgment. If 
we don’t have any idea where the common judgment traps are, or where we are likely to be 
systematically biased, we do not even have a starting point. As we said earlier, some of the 
most serious judgment traps have to do with the failure to follow a judgment process. In other 
words, we might be influenced by a judgment trigger, solve the wrong problem, fail to clarify 
our objectives, or push too quickly through the initial steps in the judgment process because 
we want to quickly arrive at a solution or conclusion. In terms of mitigating bias, the first step 
is to recognize situations where we might be vulnerable. Awareness, coupled with the termi­
nology to identify and label the potential traps and biases, is key to improving judgment. In 
fact, research exploring mitigation techniques suggests that simply providing instructions to 
decision makers about the seriousness of a bias can reduce the effect of these biases.
While a thorough discussion of potential ways to mitigate biases is beyond the scope of 
this module, here are a few examples. Actively questioning our assumptions, which might 
include considering potentially disconfirming evidence or seeking more complete informa­
tion, is a key approach in mitigating all of the judgment biases. Consulting with others can 
go a long way toward mitigating the effects of the availability tendency. Getting an outside 
view on a going-concern uncertainty assessment can help keep the auditor’s judgment from 
being too optimistic, or pessimistic, given recent, salient experiences. In other judgment and 
decision tasks, a helpful approach is to ask others to gather and evaluate information without 
revealing our preference. (We do not want to reveal our preference because it may affect their 
judgment just like it may affect our own.) Finally, we can also take steps to objectively evalu­
ate the pros and cons for each alternative. In mitigating bias related to the anchoring tendency, 
it can be helpful to seek out and explicitly consider alternative anchors.
The bottom line is that we need to realize where and how we may be biased in order to 
develop simple approaches for mitigating the effects of those biases. And the good news is 
that once you are aware of traps and biases, the mitigation approach often is a matter of apply­
ing logic and common sense. Bias-mitigation techniques are important, but just as important 

756	
Appendix    Advanced Module: Professional Judgment Framework
in avoiding traps and mitigating bias is to bake the steps of good judgment, such as those pro-
vided in the KPMG Professional Judgment Framework, into your judgment-making process. 
Thoughtfully applying the steps of a judgment process can in itself mitigate bias. And, finally, 
in auditing, the requirement to conclude and document provides the auditor the opportunity to 
carefully reconsider the preceding steps of good judgment and the possibility that judgment 
traps or biases may have influenced the final conclusion.
Conclusion
Professional judgment is an increasingly important subject in accounting and auditing. As 
accounting standards become more subjective and fair value measurement increasingly takes 
center stage, professionals will be required to apply more and better professional judgment on 
a consistent basis. In reality, none of us will ever make perfect judgments or be completely 
free from bias or from judgment traps. But by becoming aware of where we can fall prey to 
such influences and by practicing common sense mitigation techniques, including the steps in 
a judgment process, we can improve the quality of our professional judgment. And this, more 
than just about anything else you can do, will set you apart as an outstanding professional.
