@ The Night Market
By night, Jemaa El Fna 
transforms into a circus, theatre 
and restaurant, with itinerant 
musicians and entertainers 
drawing excitable crowds 
(see pp10–11).
£ Koutoubia Mosque
Marrakech’s landmark 
monument boasts a tower 
that dominates the skyline 
for miles around. Like most  
mosques in Morocco, it is 
closed to non-Muslims but 
it’s an impressive sight 
nonetheless (see pp12–13).
$ The Souks
Laid out in the narrow streets 
to the north of central Jemaa El  
Fna are a dizzying array of souks,  
or bazaars. Different areas 
specialize in their own speciﬁc 
wares, selling anything from 
carpets, lanterns and slippers, 
to ingredients for magic spells  
(see pp14–15).
An oasis in every sense of the word, Marrakech was once a beacon for the 
trading caravans that had driven north through the desert and navigated over 
the often snow-capped Atlas Mountains. Marrakech may be Morocco’s third 
most important city after Rabat and Casablanca, but its fabulous palaces and 
lush palm groves exercise a powerful hold over tourists. It has always been 
the place where sub-Saharan Africa meets Arab North Africa, 
and, even today, this market town located on the edge of 
nowhere remains a compellingly exotic port of call.
! Jemaa El Fna
This is a vast plaza at 
the heart of the medina 
(the old walled city), as 
old as Marrakech itself. 
The site of parades and 
executions in the past, 
modern city life is centred 
around the Jemaa El Fna 
(see pp8–9).

% City Walls and Gates
Marrakech’s medina, or old city, is 
wrapped around by several miles of 
reddish-pink, dried mud walls, punctuated 
by nearly 20 gates. Having proved 
ineffective against attackers throughout 
history, the walls are more ornamental 
than functional (see pp18–19).
& Medersa  
Ben Youssef
Behind a typically 
blank Marrakech 
façade hides what is 
arguably the city’s 
ﬁnest building. This 
ancient religious 
school boasts exquisite 
decorative detail (see 
pp22–23).
( Majorelle 
Gardens
Jacques Majorelle,  
a French artist who 
came to Marrakech  
to recuperate, created 
this beautiful garden 
which was later 
owned by French  
couturier, Yves Saint-
Laurent. It is open to 
the public (see 
pp26–27).
) Mamounia Hotel
A grande dame among hotels worldwide, 
the Mamounia has been providing hospitality 
to the visiting rich and famous for almost a 
century (see pp28–29).
Saadian Tombs
A tranquil garden hidden at the 
end of the narrowest of meandering 
passageways shelters the royal 
tombs of one of Morocco’s ruling 
dynasties. They were shrouded  
from the world till the 1920s  
 (see pp20–21).
^ 
Badii Palace
The ruins of this 
once fabled palace 
provide a picturesque 
setting for nesting 
storks – and a 
salutary warning 
from history against 
extravagance (see 
pp24–25).

Dried fruit and nuts stall
It is worth paying 
repeated visits at 
different times of the 
day, but in summer 
months the square 
goes uncharac-
teristically quiet 
during the hottest 
part of the afternoon.
Argana and the 
Terrasses de 
l’Alhambra are good 
lunch spots (see 
p65) and both  
offer upper terrace  
seating overlooking 
the square.

Marrakech‘s Top 10
! Orange-Juice Stalls
The ﬁrst to appear on the 
square every morning are  
these sellers of freshly-
squeezed orange juice. They  
work in brightly painted iron 
barrows fringing the square.
@ Snake Charmers
The heat makes the 
snakes unresponsive so 
the charmers work on 
tourists, cajoling them 
into draping the lethargic 
reptiles over their shoul-
ders for a photograph.
£ Café de France
There are several places 
to sit and watch the 
incessant entertainment of 
the square over coffee but 
the rafﬁsh air of the Café de 
France (left) lends it an added 
appeal and is a favourite with 
tourists and locals alike. 
Jemaa El Fna
The medina’s central square means “Assembly 
of the Dead”, a reference to a time when the 
heads of executed criminals would be 
displayed here on spikes. Although nothing as 
gruesome is on view today, the square is still 
populated with some extraordinary sights such 
as snake charmers, monkey trainers and 
colourfully-costumed water sellers. In spite of 
government efforts to sanitize Jemaa El Fna 
with neat paving and ornamental barrows, the 
place remains endearingly chaotic.

Marrakech‘s Top 10
$ Tooth Pullers 
These self-proclaimed 
“dentists” sit behind wooden 
trays ﬁlled with loose teeth 
(below) ready to aid cash-poor 
locals with aching dentures.
^ Porters
With cars banned from crossing Jemaa El Fna, 
access to many of the hotels in the surrounding 
alleys is provided by the ubiquitous porter (carroser), 
who carries your luggage on a wheeled barrow and 
transports it to your lodgings for a small tip.
& Monkey 
Trainers
Small monkeys 
dressed in bright 
tunics are brought 
to the square by 
their keepers to 
caper and dance 
for tossed coins. 
* Calèches
Hop into one of the waiting calèches, or horse-
drawn carriages (below), parked along the square’s 
west side. For a fee – you may need to bargain down 
from the driver’s inﬂated price – you can take a circuit 
of the city walls, or almost anywhere you care to go.
) Fortune Tellers
Throughout the day, 
impossibly wrinkled, 
elderly women squat 
beneath umbrellas with 
packs of Tarot cards to 
hold forth on the fortunes 
of the people who drop 
by for a reading. 
( Water Sellers
Known by the locals 
as gerrab, the water 
sellers roam the square 
in colourful costume and 
tassel-fringed hats, 
ringing copper bells to 
announce their arrival 
(centre). The brass cups 
are meant exclusively for 
the Muslims while the 
white-metal cups are for 
the thirsty people from 
all other religions.
An Unplanned 
Masterpiece
Jemaa El Fna is 
considered to be a 
“Masterpiece of the 
Oral and Intangible 
Heritage of Humanity”, 
according to the 
UNESCO.  This is an 
international list that 
includes pieces of 
intangible culture such 
as song cycles,  
theatrical traditions  
and sacred spaces. 
Inclusion in the list  
is intended to raise 
awareness and preserve 
something unique and 
irreplaceable; Jemaa El 
Fna certainly qualiﬁes.
Herbalists
These stand as 
testimony to the 
Moroccan belief in 
natural remedies. 
Compounds of 
ground roots, dried 
herbs and even 
desiccated animal 
parts are used for 
everything, from 
curing head colds 
to warding off the 
evil eye.

A dry-fruit stall
Although Marrakech 
has a very low crime 
rate, the crowds 
milling around 
Jemaa El Fna at 
night are perfect 
cover for pickpockets. 
Be careful with hand-
bags and wallets.
If you ﬁnd the food 
stalls at the Night 
Market to be intimi-
dating, you can 
always opt for the 
relative familiarity of 
salads, pizza and 
pasta at the Terrasses 
de l’Alhambra (see 
p65) instead.

Marrakech‘s Top 10
! The food
Some of the most 
popular eatables are the 
varieties of brochette – 
grilled lamb and chicken 
– along with bowls of 
soup, spicy sausages, 
grilled ﬁsh and bowls of 
boiled chickpeas.
@ Hygiene
The raw ingredients 
arrive fresh each evening and 
the food is cooked in front of 
you. Plates and utensils are 
often washed in water that 
isn’t changed for much of the 
night, so get your food 
served on paper and eat with 
your ﬁngers.
$ Entertainers
Knots of excited on-
lookers surround a mena-
gerie of tricksters, sundry 
wild-eyed performers and 
fortune tellers (below). 
This is where the 
Moroccan belief 
in everyday 
magic is on full 
display. And 
it’s not put 
on for 
tourists.
Each evening as the sun goes down, dozens of 
open-air kitchens set up on the east side of Jemaa 
El Fna. Serving areas are erected and tables and 
benches are put out to create one vast alfresco 
eatery. Beneath a hanging cloud of smoke from 
the crackling charcoal grills, locals and visitors 
alike tuck into a vast array of Moroccan cuisine. 
Nearly every stall has its own speciality, from 
snails in spicy broth and chunks of lamb stuffed 
into sandwiches to humble hard-boiled eggs.

Walk around to view 
what’s on offer and when 
you see something you like, 
take a seat. You don’t have to 
speak Arabic – just point to 
what you want. Prices are 
usually posted and every-
thing is inexpensive.
The Night Market

* Majoun
The wild-eyed 
appearance of some of 
the denizens of Jemaa El 
Fna is undoubtedly aided 
by consumption of this 
mild, hallucinogenic drug. 
It is basically Moroccan-
grown marijuana eaten in 
a jam- or cake-like form 
and is best avoided.
During the International Film Festival a large screen is erected on 
Jemaa El Fna, see p44.
11
Marrakech‘s Top 10
The Gnawa
The Gnawa came to 
Morocco as slaves from 
sub-Saharan Africa. 
Over the centuries they 
have kept alive their 
culture through oral 
traditions and, parti-
cularly, music. Played 
on simple string 
instruments known as 
gimbri, their music is 
looping and repetitive, 
intended to produce an 
almost trance-like state 
in the dancers and 
vocalists who some-
times accompany the 
musicians. Gnawa 
music has made a great 
impact on the global 
world music scene.
% Storytellers
Gifted orators enthral their rapt 
audience with tales of Islamic heroes 
and buffoons. Sessions end on a 
cliffhanger – the outcome is revealed 
only on the following night.
^ Transvestite 
dancers
You’ll ﬁnd men 
who dance wildly 
while dressed in 
women’s clothing 
(right). It’s an 
age-old practice – 
one that lends a 
slightly surreal, 
almost cultic air, to 
the goings-on on  
the square.
& Musicians
A smattering of 
musicians (below), often 
groups of Gnawa, who 
specialize in hypnotic, 
thrumming rhythms, 
entrance crowds of 
listeners who stand 
around swaying in far-off 
reveries, long after every-
one else has 
called it  
a night.
( Café Glacier
One of the best 
places from which to 
observe the spectacle of 
the Jemaa El Fna at night 
is from the rooftop 
terrace of Café Glacier, 
located at the southern 
edge. The best time to 
visit is as the sun sets.
) Henna painting
At their busiest as 
the evening comes on, 
the ladies with piping 
bags full of henna paste 
paint hands and feet with 
the most intricate of 
designs (above). Clients 
choose the design from a 
book of photographs; the 
“tattoos” usually last a 
week or more.

For more information on Islam and the regulations for visiting 
mosques, see p106.

The Prayer Hall entrance
Although access is 
denied to non-
Muslims, one of the 
doors on the east 
wall is often open 
and you can peer 
through for a view  
of the impressive 
main prayer hall  
and its seemingly 
endless arcades of 
horseshoe arches.
Pizzeria Venezia (see 
p65), which is just 
across the road from 
the Koutoubia, has a 
rooftop terrace that 
offers excellent views 
of the mosque and 
minaret.
• Map H4 
• Avenue Bab Jedid, 
Medina
• Mosque: Open only 
during prayer times  
(see right); closed to all 
non-Muslims
• Gardens: free entry  
to both Muslims and 
non-Muslims
Its minaret is the city’s pre-eminent monument, towering above all else and 
has always been the ﬁrst visible sign of Marrakech for travellers approaching 
from afar. This is wholly ﬁtting, because the mosque is not only the city’s 
main place of worship, it is also one of the city’s oldest buildings, dating back 
to the 12th century, not long after Marrakech was founded. The designer of 
the Koutoubia minaret went on to create Tour Hassan in the Moroccan 
capital, Rabat and the tower of the Giralda in Seville. Unfortunately, as with 
nearly all mosques and shrines in Morocco, non-Muslims are not permitted to 
enter the Koutoubia.

! Mosque of the 
Booksellers
The Koutoubia was built in 
1158. Its name means the 
Mosque of the Booksellers, 
which is a reference to a 
small market that once 
existed in the neighbour-
hood, where worshippers 
could buy copies of 
religious tracts.
@ Minaret
The purpose of a 
minaret is to provide a 
high platform from which 
the muezzin can make the 
ﬁve-times-daily call to 
prayer. Rather than a 
staircase, the Koutoubia’s 
towering minaret (left) has 
a spiralling ramp wide 
enough for a horse to be 
ridden to the top.

Zohra
This white tomb (below)

% Prayer times
Exact times of daily prayer change with the 
seasons, but are observed pre-dawn, noon, late 
afternoon, sunset and late evening, as indicated by 
the muezzin. The most important prayers of the week 
are those at noon on Friday.
& Dar El Hajar
Two wells on the piazza allow visitors to view the 
buried remains of the Dar El Hajar, a fortress built by 
the Almoravids. It was destroyed when the Almohads 
captured the city (see p32).
Heights of  
Good Taste
The Koutoubia minaret’s 
continued domination of 
the skyline is owed 
largely to an enlight-
ened piece of legislation 
by the city’s former 
French colonial rulers. It 
was they who decreed 
that no building in the 
medina should rise 
above the height of a 
palm tree, and that  
no building in the New 
City should rise above 
the height of the 
Koutoubia’s minaret.  
The ruling holds good 
even today. Only 
Muslims may enjoy  
the great view from the 
top of the building.
( Koutoubia 
Gardens
South of the mosque is a 
garden with a mix of 
palms and deciduous 
trees, topiary hedges and 
colourful roses (centre).
) Tomb of  Yousef 
Ben Tachfine
Just north of the 
mosque, glimpsed 
through a locked gate, is 
a walled area containing 
the dilapidated mauso-
leum of Yousef Ben 
Tachﬁne, tribal leader of 
the Almoravids, and the 
man credited with the 
founding of Marrakech.
£ The minaret 
decoration
Originally the whole 
minaret was encased in 
tiles and carved stucco, 
but now only two 
shallow bands of blue 
ceramics remain.
^ Ruins of the 
Almohad Mosque
Next to the Koutoubia are 
the remains of an earlier 
mosque, circa 1147. The 
bases of the prayer hall’s 
columns, secured behind 
railings, are clearly visible 
(left). They were revealed 
during excavations by 
Moroccan archaeologists.
The mosque 
plan
The mosque is 
rectangular in plan. The 
relatively plain main east 
entrance leads to a vast 
prayer hall with its eight 
bays and horseshoe 
arches. North of the 
prayer hall is a courtyard 
with fountains and trees.

Metalwork on display
You will get lost in 
the souks.  Alleys are   
narrow, winding and 
constantly branching, 
while landmarks are 
few. However, the 
area covered is small 
and you are never 
more than a few 
minutes’ walk back 
to Jemaa El Fna. 
Locals are friendly 
and will point out 
the way. 
Café Arabe, near the 
Souk des Teinturiers, 
and Café des Epices 
in the Rahba Kedima 
are both great places 
to relax with a mint 
tea and a light snack 
(see p71).

The Souks
Marrakech’s earliest inhabitants made their living from trading with the 
Africans and with the Spaniards who came by sea. Luxuries like gold and 
ivory came from the south, while leather, metalwork and ceramics were sent 
north. Even today, trade continues to be the city’s mainstay, with thousands  
of craftsmen eking out an existence in the maze of souks that ﬁll much of the 
northern half of the medina. A trip to the souks is part history lesson, part 
endurance test – to see how long you can keep your purse in your bag or 
your wallet in your pocket.

@ Souk El Kebir
Straight on from Rue 
Semarine, this is the heart 
of the souks. It’s a narrow 
alley that lurches from  
side-to-side and up-and-
down. It is lined by dozens 
of the tiniest shops – barely 
a person wide – each 
overﬂowing with goods, 
particularly leather.

The guide issue
A guide to the souks is 
really not necessary. 
Although the souks are 
a warren, the area is not 
too large and it’s never 
hard to ﬁnd your way 
back to some familiar 
landmark. Any “best 
places” your guide may 
lead you to are only 
best by virtue of offering 
your guide the highest 
of commissions.
% Souk des 
Teinturiers
Sheaves of freshly 
dyed wool (below) are 
hung from ropes strung 
across one particular alleyway  
for a vibrantly colourful scene.
& Fondouks
The fondouk is an anc-
ient hostelry for travelling 
merchants built around a 
courtyard. Most are now 
gritty workshops.
* Souk El Khemis
Entrepreneurs 
renovating riads  
scout this ﬂea market 
to the north of the  
medina for unusual items 
of furniture.
( Souk El Bab 
Salaam
This covered market

quarter with everything 
from food and spices to 
caged birds.
) Rahba Kedima

Marrakech Souvenirs
! 
Babouches
Babouches are Moroccan 
slippers, handmade from local 
leather, although increasingly  
the babouches found in the 
souks are made of a synthetic 
plastic that only looks like 
leather. In their most basic form 
they are pointy-toed and come 
in a variety of colours – canary 
yellow being the most 
common – but are otherwise 
plain. Increasingly however, 
boutiques and shops are 
customizing their babou-
ches with silk trim, or 
even carving the leather 
with exquisite designs.
@ 
Argan oil
Argan oil is an almost 
mystical substance to 
which all kinds of 
properties are attributed 
(see p90). Part of its 
mystique can be credited to the 
rarity of argan trees, which only 
grow in southwestern Morocco. 
The oil is sold all over the souks 
but much of it is low grade. For 
quality oil, it’s best to buy from a 
reputable dealer.
£ 
Carpets
Marrakech is famed for its 
carpets, made by the tribes of 
the south. Each tribe has its 
own patterns. Beware the 
salesmen’s patter. Some 
carpets are very old and 
made of genuine cactus silk 
but these are rare. Most 
sold today, though 
beautiful, are quite 
modern and made from 
non-natural ﬁbres. Buy a 
carpet if you like it, and 
not because you have 
been told that it’s a  
good investment.
$ 
Pottery
Each region of 
Morocco produces its 
own distinctive pottery. The local 
style is plain terracotta ﬁnished 
with colourful glazes. Ceramics 
from the Akkal factory would not 
look out of place in a cutting 
edge design shop. Or visit the 
big pottery souk outside Bab 
Ghemat which is to the south-
east of the medina.
% 
Lanterns
There are two types of 
lanterns: those that hang from 
the ceiling and those that sit on 
the ﬂoor. The former (known as 
fanous) are typically fashioned 
from metal and come in 
elaborate shapes with intricate

decoration. The latter are made 
of skin and goats’ hair and are  
usually colourful. Look for them 
in the northern part of the 
souk or down at the Place 
des Ferblantiers.
^ 
Leather bags
Marrakech is known 
for its leather. It is made 
by treating animal hides by 
hand in the tanneries (see 
p68) in the east of the 
medina which are then 
dyed. Unsurprisingly, the 
shops of the souk are ﬁlled with 
leather goods from purses to 
handbags to book bindings. Do 
plenty of window shopping 
before settling on an item. 
& 
Candles
Candles are used to great 
effect in local restaurants. They 
are sold in all shapes, colours 
and sizes in the souk, and some 
of the designs can be 
highly inventive. Some 
of the best are made 
by a small company 
called Amira (www.
amirabougies.com) 
and you can buy them 
in various boutiques.
* 
Jewellery
The local Berber 
jewellery is silver, 
chunky and heavy. 
However, a number of 
artisans in Marrakech, 
both local and foreign, produce 
more modern designs. Look out 
for Joanna Bristow’s brilliant  
designs in select hotel 
boutiques such as La 
Maison Arabe (see p46).
( 
Fashion
Marrakech may have 
inspired countless 
foreign couturiers from 
Yves Saint-Laurent to Tom 
Ford. However, it’s only 
recently that the city has 
begun to develop a fashion 
of its own. There are some young 
Moroccan designers producing 
beautiful clothing, like the high 
proﬁle brothers behind the 
boutique Beldi, whose collections 
made from local fabric are 
tailored to Western sensibilities.
) 
Marra-Kitsch
A recent trend amongst local 
designers involves taking the 
iconography of Marrakech and 
giving it a Pop-ish twist. Florence 
Tarrane of Kulchi (see p70) does 
shoulder bags that feature the 
khamsa (ﬁve-ﬁngered hand), the 
Arab good-luck symbol. Hassan 
Hajjaj makes fanous from sheets 
of tin printed with advertising 
logos, sold at his Riad Yima, ﬁve 
minutes from Jemaa El Fna 
(www.riadyima.com).

Bab Doukkala
Walking a circuit 
around the outside

dually or take a 
calèche tour.
If you take a calèche

you carry bottled 
water, as it can get 
hot and dusty.

City Walls and Gates
The city walls date from the 1120s when, under 
threat of attack from the Almohads of the south, 
the ruling Almoravid sultan, Ali Ben Youssef 
decided to encircle his garrison town with 
fortiﬁcations. The walls he had built were up to  
9 m (30 ft) high and formed a circuit of 10 km  
(6 miles), punctuated by some 200 towers and 
20 gates. Despite changes made in the 20th 
century to accommodate motor vehicles, the  
walls remain largely unchanged.

Yacoub El Mansour’s reign.
$ Bab Doukkala
This massive gate (top 
left) built by the Almoravids 
in the 12th century now 
stands isolated from the 
walls, thanks to 20th-
century urban planning. The 
cavernous interior rooms 
lend themselves for use as 
a sometime event space.

This was the original 
southern city gate (right). 
The gatehouse building is 
now occupied by a pottery 
shop and all foot and car 
trafﬁc pass through a mod-
ern breach in the old walls. 
! Pisé
The walls are built from 
a mixture of mud, straw 
and lime (known as pisé), 
which becomes as hard as 
brick on drying. The distin-
ctive pinkish-red hue of the 
walls (below) is a result of 
pigments in the local earth.

The Red City
Marrakech’s distinctive 
colouring is from pig-
ments in the local soil, 
mixed to make pisé 
from which its buildings 
have traditionally been 
constructed. In the last 
century, this was threat-
ened by new building 
materials such as 
concrete. Therefore the 
ruling French decreed 
that all new buildings  
be painted pink. This 
rule continues to be in  
force even today, with 
pleasing results.
& Bab El Khemis
The most northerly of 
gates (above) is also the 
most decorative, with a 
semi-circle of stalactite 
mouldings arcing over 
the entranceway. Outside 
the gate is a pretty little 
marabout or shrine.
) Calèche tours
The best way to view 
the walls is by a calèche 
(see pp8–9). Take a 
complete circuit for the 
equivalent of a few dollars.
*  The Seven Saints
Just outside the walls stand seven stone towers 
each topped by a tree. This giant ensemble is in 
homage to the seven saints of Marrakech (see p68). 
% Bab Berrima
Apart from 
being perimetre 
defences, other 
walls and gates 
divided up the 
interior of the 
medina. For 
instance, a wall 
separated the royal 
kasbah quarter 
from the city; Bab 
Berrima was one  
of the gates bet-
ween these two 
distinct zones.

Saadian Tombs
This is the secluded burial place of a dynasty noted by novelist Edith Wharton 
for its “barbarous customs but sensuous reﬁnements”. The 66 royal tombs 
that are housed here date from the late-16th and early-17th centuries, but 
were unknown to the outside world until the 1920s, when they were revealed 
by the curiosity of a French ofﬁcial. The complex may be modest in size but  
it is beautifully decorated in the Alhambran style with plenty of carved cedar, 
stucco and polychromic tiling. The tombs have three main burial chambers 
that are ranged around a small garden.

! Saadian Dynasty 
(1549–1668)
Setting out from their 
powerbase in Taroudant, to 
the south of the Atlas  
Mountains, the Saadians 
defeated the ruling Merenids 
of Fès. Having established 
their court at Marrakech, 
they revitalized the city, 
endowing it with grand monu-
ments. They were in power 
for less than 120 years.
@ Entranceway
Reached via the  
narrowest of twisting 
passageways (above), the 
tombs remained a closely-
guarded secret for centuries. 
Even today, visiting retains 
an element of discovery  
for tourists.

The ﬁrst chamber, 
intended as a place of 
prayer, now contains 
tombs. Most of them are 
not from the Saadian era, 
but date back to the

Islamic burials
In Islam, it is customary 
to begin the burial 
process within 24 hours 
of death. After a ritual 
washing of the body, it 
is then wrapped in a 
funeral shroud. The 
wrapped body is put 
directly into the ground, 
laid on its right side 
with the head towards 
Mecca. Graves are 
raised to prevent 
anyone from sitting or 
walking on them. Islam 
forbids cremation.
  Main Chamber
A grand pavilion 
at the garden’s centre is  
the only real bit of 
architecture in the 
complex. A tall, green-
tiled, roofed structure in 
the Andalusian style, it 
has three soaring portals 
with beautiful carved 
wood and a stucco frieze 
of eight-pointed stars. 
Housed within are more 
mosaic-covered tombs.
 Kasbah Mosque
Predating the tombs 
by around 400 years, this 
mosque was originally 
built in the year 1190. 
Since then it has 
undergone a number of 
renovations. The cut-brick 
on green-tile back- 
ground that decorates  
the minaret, however, 
dates back to its  
original construction. 
  
Rue de  
la Kasbah
When you exit the tombs, 
take a left to reach this  
main street running 
through the old kasbah 
quarter. It runs arrow 
straight down towards the 
Grand Méchouar, or what 
is known as the  
parade ground of the  
royal palace.
* Morning Market
A small square formed by the convergence of 
several small side streets south of the tombs is host 
to a modest fruit and vegetable market every 
morning except Fridays. Take the second left as you 
walk south from the tombs to this covered street.
^ The Garden
The serene garden has countless headstones 
dotted among the bushes and scrubby plants. These 
mark the tombs of several children, plus guards and 
servants. The garden is hugely popular with the local 
community of stray cats.
  
Hall of Twelve 
Columns
This chamber holds the 
tombs of the Sultan 
Ahmed El Mansour,  
along with his entire 
family (right). The stele is 
in ﬁnely-worked cedar 
wood and stuccowork. 
The graves are beautifully 
designed and made from 
the striking Carrara 
marble that is particular 
to Italy. 
) Centre Artisanal
One of two vast, government-run stores selling 
Moroccan handicrafts, it’s a one-stop opportunity to 
stock up on kaftans, jewellery, carpets and ceramics, 
all at ﬁxed prices. Ideal for anyone who dislikes the 
hassle of haggling in the souk.

Medersa Ben Youssef
It is not the oldest or most signiﬁcant of Marrakech 
monuments, but the medersa is one of the city’s most 
impressive buildings and allows entry to non-Muslims. It 
was built by the Saadian sultan, Moulay Abdellah around 
1565, and was rebuilt in the 16th century. It displays all 
the ﬁne decorative detailing that characterizes what was 
the golden age of Moroccan architecture. The medersa 
has also had a brush with movie stardom, as an Algerian 
Suﬁ retreat in the Kate Winslet movie Hideous Kinky.

Ben Youssef 
Mosque
The medersa, in its 
earlier days, was part of 
the complex of the 
nearby Almoravid 
mosque which was 
founded by Ali Ben 
Youssef during his reign 
between 1106–42, to 
which it was once 
attached. For several 
centuries, this mosque 
was the focal point of 
worship in the medina 
and together with the 
medersa, it constituted 
an important centre of 
the Islamic religion in 
the country. 
$ Carved stucco
Vertical panels of 
intricately carved plaster 
stretching above the 
tiling are decorated with 
inscriptions or geometric 
patterns (below); depic-
tion of humans or anim-
als is prohibited by Islam.
& Dar Bellarj
To the north of the 
medersa’s entrance, Dar 
Bellarj is a former stork 
hospital (the name 
means “House of the 
Storks”). The building 
now houses a temporary 
ﬁlm school, Ecole 
Supérieure des Arts 
Visuels de Marrakech.
* Student Cells
Arranged on two 
levels around the central 
courtyard (right) are 130 
tiny rooms. Much like 
monks’ cells, nearly 900 
students from Muslim 
countries studied here 
until the medersa fell out 
of use in the 1960s.
^ The role of the 
medersa
A medersa was a place 
for religious instruction – 
a theological college. The 
students who boarded 
here would have studied 
the Koran in detail and 
discussed it with the 
institute’s sheikhs (lear-
ned religious ﬁgures).
( Chrob au Chouf 
Fountain
A twist and turn north of 
the medersa, this hand-
some fountain (its name 
means “drink and look”) 
is worth seeking out. A 
big cedar lintel covered in 
calligraphy (below), it is a 
relic of a time when it 
was a pious act to 
provide a public source 
of clean drinking water. 
) Rue de Souk des 
Fassis
This wriggling alley to the 
medersa’s east is lined 
by beautifully restored 
fondouks or old hostels. 
Some are now centres 
for artisans. One is a ﬁne 
restaurant, Le Foundouk.
% Prayer Hall
The elaborately decorated prayer hall has an 
octagonal wooden-domed roof supported by marble 
columns. The stucco features rare palm motifs and 
calligraphy of Koranic texts. The room is well-lit by 
openwork gypsum windows which are crowned by 
stalactite cupolas.

magniﬁcent palaces ever constructed, with walls and ceilings encrusted with 
gold and a massive pool with an island ﬂanked by four sunken gardens. This 
grand folly survived for all of a century before another conquering sultan 
came along and stripped the place bare (a procedure that itself took 12 
years) and carted the riches to his new capital at Meknès. All that survives 
today are the denuded mudbrick ruins.

! Sultan Ahmed El 
Mansour
The palace was built by 
Sultan Mansour who took 
to the throne after the 
Battle of Three Kings (1578), 
in which the Moroccans 
vanquished the Portuguese. 
Great wealth was accrued 
from the ransom of 
Portuguese captives and 
from further successful 
campaigns in Mali. These 
riches were poured into 
building the Badii Palace.
@ The gatehouse
The palace is approached along a narrow way 
between twin high walls (below). On its completion, the 
gatehouse carried an inscription to the glories of the 
palace. Now it is a ruin and entry to the complex is 
through a breach in the crumbling walls.

The Battle of the 
Three Kings
In an attempt to wrest 
the throne from his 
uncle, Abdel Malek, the 
Saadian Abu Abdallah 
Mohammed II, along 
with King Sebastian of 
Portugal, declared war. 
Fought in the town of 
Ksar El Kebir, between 
Tangier and Fès, all 
three died in the battle. 
Malek was succeeded 
by his brother, Ahmed  
El Mansour, builder of 
the Badii Palace.
( Storks
The protrusions in the 
crumbling walls are well-
loved by city storks who 
have made their nests 
here. Considered holy,  
an old Berber belief has 
it that storks are actually 
transformed humans.
$ A sinister omen
At a banquet to 
celebrate the palace’s 
completion, a guest 
declared, “When it is 
demolished, it will make 
a ﬁne ruin.” El Mansour 
was rendered speech-
less; the guest’s sinister 
omen has come true.
* Rooftop terrace
At the northeastern 
corner is the only intact 
tower with an internal 
staircase to the roof 
where it’s possible to get 
a sense of the immense 
size of the complex.
& Underground 
passages
Beside the annexe, a 
path leads down into the 
former stables and dun- 
geon (above). Though you 
can enter, the chambers 
are only partially lit.
) Khaysuran 
Pavilion
A pavilion on the north of 
the great court, once the 
palace harem, now 
serves as an exhibition 
hall with shows of work 
by local and locally-based 
foreign artists.
% Pavilion of 50 
Columns
Ruins around the sides of 
the courtyard were proba-
bly summer houses. The 
Koubba El Khamsiniya  
on the far western side is 
named after the 50 pillars 
used in its construction. 
^ Mosque minbar
An “annexe du 
palais” in the southeast 
corner displays the 12th-
century pulpit (minbar) 
from Koutoubia Mosque. 
Intricately carved, this is 
a celebrated work of art 
of Moorish Spain.
# Basins & gardens
The palace’s central 
courtyard is dominated 
by ﬁve basins and four 
sunken gardens planted 
with orange trees. Of the 
ﬁve basins, the central 
one has an island that 
comes alive every July 
for the annual folk 
festival. It is also used  
as a venue during the 
International Film  
Festival (see p44).

! Jacques Majorelle
French artist Jacques 
Majorelle (1886–1962)  
came to Marrakech in  
1919 to recuperate from  
his heart problems and  
immediately saw the 
painterly potential of 
southern Morocco.
@ Louis Majorelle
Louis Majorelle was the 
painter’s equally famous 
father. A French decorator 
and furniture designer, he 
was one of the leading 
exponents of the Art 
Nouveau style. His work  
is displayed in celebrated 
museums, such as the 
Musée d’Orsay in Paris.
£ The plants
A beautiful bamboo 
“forest” and an arid cactus 
garden with species from 
around the world share gar-
den space (below). Most 
stunning of all are the 
ﬂowering masses of red 
and purple bougainvillea.
Of Marrakech’s numerous gardens (see pp42–3), these 
are the most famous and the legacy of an expatriate 
French painter, Jacques Majorelle, who considered himself 
a “gardenist”. In 1924, he acquired land and set about 
creating a botanical sanctuary around his studio. 
Majorelle opened his gardens to the public in 1947 and 
they remained a popular attraction until his death 15 
years later. The property fell into disrepair until 1980, 
when it was rescued from ruin by French fashion designer 
Yves Saint-Laurent and his artist-friend, Pierre Bergé.

Yves Saint-
Laurent
French designer Yves 
Saint-Laurent ﬁrst visited 
the city in 1962. By the 
end of the 1960s, he’d 
bought his ﬁrst house 
here. Later, he moved 
into a villa next to 
Majorelle Gardens, which 
he purchased and saved 
from being destroyed to 
make way for an 
apartment complex. After 
his death a small 
memorial stone was 
placed in the gardens, 
which now belong to a 
trust to ensure their 
continued upkeep. 
$ Bassins and 
fountains
The garden has a fountain 
and two large bassins or  
pools (left), the smaller fed 
by a sloping channel. Next 
to the museum, a third pool 
is ﬁlled with golden carp.
% Boutique
In the northeast corner, a small boutique sells an 
interesting array of quality local handicrafts including 
clothing, jewellery and miscellaneous leather 
products such as bags, sandals and beautifully bound 
notebooks. However, there is a notable paucity of 
information concerning Majorelle and his garden.
^ Islamic Art 
Museum
The painter’s former 
studio now houses a 
small but well-presented 
collection that includes  
Berber jewellery, ﬁne 
embroidery and carved 
wooden items. 
* Majorelle’s 
paintings 
The museum’s ﬁrst room 
has a series of litho-
graphs depicting various 
Atlas kasbahs. Some  
of Majorelle’s most 
acclaimed works were 
the tourism posters that 
he created for Morocco. 
( Majorelle blue
The name Majorelle 
lives on in an electrifying 
shade of cobalt blue 
inspired by the Berber 
homes of southern 
Morocco. His former 
studio is strikingly  
painted in this colour.
) Petrol station
At the corner of 
Boulevard de Saﬁ, this 
petrol station was desi-
gned by Jean-François 
Zevaco and is possibly 
the city’s most striking 
modernist building.
& Doors and ceilings
Arguably the highlight 
of the museum is its 
collection of wooden 
doors and ceilings 
(below), all beautifully 
carved. Some of the 
ceiling panels are painted 
but most impressive are 
the huge double doors 
dating from the 17th to 
the 19th centuries.

Extensive renovations to the hotel were behind schedule at the 
time of going to press; call ahead to check if it has reopened.

most celebrated guests to have frequented this 
hotel. It was originally built in the 19th century as 
the palace of the crown prince of Morocco, but in 
1923 the French turned it into a hotel for the 
Moroccan railways. It is set within 7 hectares (17 
acres) of delightful gardens surrounded by the

Among its several grand suites, 
the most famous is the one named 
after Winston Churchill (below). The 
decoration is intended to evoke the 
era when the politician visited and 
contains artifacts including his pipe.
% Majorelle Ceiling
Winston Churchill met fellow painter 
Jacques Majorelle (see pp26–7) in 1946 
during one of his stays at the Mamounia. 
The portly politician persuaded the hotel’s 
management to commission a mural by 
Majorelle (above), which you can now see 
on the ceiling of the extended lobby.
^ Winston 
Churchill
 “This is a wonderful 
place, and the hotel 
one of the best I have 
ever used,” were 
Churchill’s views on the 
hotel and the city that he 
adored, in a letter to his 
wife, Clementine.
* The architects
The original architects 
of the Mamounia, Henri 
Prost and Antoine 
Marchisio, blended art 
deco with traditional 
Moroccan motifs (left). In 
1986, renovations were 
carried out by the 
company that designed 
Morocco’s royal palaces. 
& Churchill’s 
paintings
Churchill would paint in 
the afternoon and was 
fond of Marrakech’s 
extraordinary light. A 
couple of his paintings 
still hang in the hotel.
( The Man Who Knew

Several scenes of this 1956 
Alfred Hitchcock thriller 
(below), with James 
Stewart and Doris Day,

Moroccan Architecture
! 
Horseshoe arches
Properly known as 
outrepassé arches, these are 
where the arch curves back 
inwards after its widest point, to 
give an effect like a horseshoe or 
keyhole. Its use is most com-
monly associated with Moorish 
Spain and North Africa.
@ 
Zellij tiling
One of the most striking 
features of Moroccan 
architecture is its use of multi-
coloured, small tiles laid in 
complex geometric patterns. This 
is known as the zellij technique, 
where tiles are created as large 
squares and then hand cut into 
smaller shapes. Conventional 
shapes and sizes are typically 
used, though there are as many 
as 360 different types of pieces.
£ 
Tadalekt plaster
This technique was initially 
associated only with 
bathhouses to 
counter the heat 
and moisture. Walls 
are treated with a 
plaster of powdered 
limestone, which, 
once set, is polished 
with ﬂat stones, 
then painted with a 
glaze of egg whites 
and polished again 
with the local black 
soap, made from 
olives. The ﬁnished 
surface looks akin  
to soft leather.
$ 
Stucco plaster
A decorative element of 
Moroccan architecture, carved 
plaster can cover entire walls in 
fantastic curvilinear and 
geometric design. The work is 
executed by craftsmen while the 
plaster is still damp – the 
patterns are sketched onto the 
surface, then gouged out with 
hammer and chisel.
% 
Carved woodwork
Although some of the same 
designs are used to decorate 
both plaster and wood, often 
wood is deployed as a frieze and 
carries inscriptions in Arabic, the  
language in which the Koran was 
revealed to the Prophet 
Mohammed and therefore of a 
sacred character. The inscriptions 
are of a religious nature and 
invariably praise the glory of 
Allah. They are used both to 
decorate and impart information.
^ 
Square 
minarets
The square design 
of Moroccan mina-
rets can be traced 
to the Umayyad 
rulers of Islamic 
Spain, who were  
of Syrian origin. 
Syrians are almost 
unique in the Middle 
East for their square 
minarets, probably 
inﬂuenced by the  
church towers built 
by Syrian Christians.

Pisé
The basic building material 
used in Morocco, pisé is wet 
earth mixed with straw and 
gravel pounded between two 
parallel boards and strengthened 
by lime. If not well made, the 
structure can crumble in the rain 
– Southern Morocco is littered 
with semi-melted buildings.
) 
Pigeonholes
The numerous pigeonholes 
peppering walls in the city are, in 
reality, remnants of wooden 
scaffolding used to erect walls.

! 
Coloured tadelakt 
Traditionally, this silky 
plaster ﬁnish with its water-
resistant qualities (see p36) was 
reserved for bathhouses, but 
interior designers have now 
begun applying it for all sorts of 
rooms. The range of colours has 
also broadened; now it’s 
common to see tadelakt in pink, 
green or even black.
@ 
Bill Willis
Willis, a Tennessee-born 
designer, ﬁrst accompanied Paul 
Getty Jr. (see p35) to Marrakech 
in 1968. He worked on the Getty 
house, then designed one for the 
Rothschilds and another for Yves 
Saint-Laurent (see pp 26–7 & 
34). He continues to reside  
in the medina and has been  
enormously inﬂuential in the 
reinterpretation of traditional 
Moroccan crafts and styles for 
the modern age.
£ 
Mud-hut chic
The term was coined by 
style magazines and refers to a 
new generation of highly 
designed buildings that advance 
the art of constructing in pisé 
(see p37). They enhance 
traditional forms by adding new, 
vibrant colours and cool, modern 
decorative touches.
$ 
Lanterns
One of the essentials of any 
modern Moroccan riad is an 
ostentatious lantern. Known in 
Arabic as fanous (see p16),  
these large lanterns are 
fashioned from beaten metal 
laced with cut-out patterns, and 
they have historically been 
connected with the celebrations 
for Ramadan. One whole area of 
the souks has been given over to 
their manufacture.
% 
Modern zellij
The traditional art of laying 
zellij (see p36) has evolved in 
new and exciting ways in the last 
two decades. Contemporary 
designers use new colours and 
striking colour combinations. 
Earlier limited to wainscoting, 
zelije is now applied to a greater 
variety of surfaces.

Charles Boccara
Born in Tunisia, educated in 
Morocco and professionally 
trained in France, Boccara is an 
inﬂuential Marrakech architect.

Wafer-thin coverings of 
beaten metal, earlier adorning 
grand wooden doors, are now 
used to fashion sheets of copper 
into hand basins. 
* 
Stucco madness
With updated traditional 
techniques, the interiors have 
made creative use of carved 
plaster, like the ﬂoor-to-ceiling 
stucco of the dining room at Riad 
Farnatchi (see left & p116), which 
resembles ﬂock wallpaper.
( 
Fretwork
Moroccan craftsmen are 
adept at transforming ordinary  
sheets into geometric-patterned 
screens and furniture panels, 
which are sometimes backlit to 
stunning effect. Although not 
indigenous to the country, they 
also assemble small, lathe-turned 
pieces of wood to form the 
screens known as mashrabiya.
) 
Colour
While Marrakech is a 
uniform dusky pink, her interiors 
are painted in bold colours. 
Favourites are fruity orange, rose 
pink, lemon yellow, mustard and 
cobalt sky blue.

Products used in Moroccan hammams and spas
Hammams and Spas
! 
Hammam El Bacha
One of the most historic 
hammams, it was initially used 
by the staff of the Dar El Bacha 
(see p69) just across the road. 
Still functioning, though poorly 
maintained, the highlight is an 
impressive 6-m (20-foot) cupola  
in the steam room. d Map H3  
• 20 rue Fatima Zohra, Medina  
• Open: men 7am–1pm daily; women 
1pm–9pm daily • No credit cards 
@ 
Hammam Etiquette
All hammams are 
single sex and have three 
main rooms: one cool, 
one hot, one – the steam 
room – very hot. Men   
keep on their underwear, 
women go naked. In public 
hammams, a masseur is availa-
ble for an additional fee. Carry 
your own towels and toiletries.
£ 
La Maison Arabe
The hammams housed in 
larger riads and hotels are 
often restricted to guests, but 
not at the Maison 
Arabe. Book yourself 
in for a vigorous

professional touch, visit a 
hammam or go to one of 
the spas burgeoning in the 
city. Most local masseurs 
use essential oils, including 
locally produced argan oil (see

particular techniques such as 
tuina or deep touch.

The Palmeraie
The Beverly Hills of 
Morocco, the Palmeraie is a  
vast palm grove on the northern 
fringe of the city, and is home to 
some fantastical and outlandish 
architectural creations. Some of 
the luxury villas also double as 
guesthouses and exclusive 
hotels (see p117). You can also 
still see the remains of the early 
irrigation system introduced by 
the Almoravids. d Map F4 
@ 
Menara Gardens
The Menara Gardens, with 
their orchard, pool and pavilion, 
epitomize a typical Islamic 
garden. Laid out in the 12th 
century, the gardens feature a 
large pool overlooked by a green 
tile-roofed pavilion. d Map B7

Agdal Gardens
Dating back to the  
12th century, the Agdal 
comprises several link-
ed gardens including 
an orange grove, an 
olive plantation, 
vineyards and orchards 
of pomegranates and  
ﬁgs. The garden was 
enclosed within pisé 
walls in the 19th 
century. There is a 
large pool at the heart 
of the garden called 
the Tank of Health –  
in 1873, Sultan 
Mohammed IV tragically 
drowned in it when he went 
boating with his son. d Map E7

Mamounia Gardens
Landscaped with ﬂowerbeds 
and groves of olives and orange 
trees, the gardens predate the 
world-famous Mamounia Hotel. 
The Arset El Mamoun were 
established in the 18th century 
by Prince Moulay Mamoun, laid 
out around a central pavilion that 
served as a royal residence; the 
hotel was added a century later 
(see p28).

Majorelle Gardens
Formerly owned by Yves 
Saint- Laurent (see p34), the

It may not be the 
prettiest but this

One of the older riads, it still 
manages to remain one of the 
most striking. The spacious 
rooms feature the most 
outlandish collection of furniture. 
TV sets, telephones and other 
modern accoutrements are non-
existent, while at the heart of 
the riad is a wild courtyard 
garden. d Map K3 • 9 derb Mesﬁoui,

La Maison Arabe
More a small hotel than a 
riad, La Maison Arabe began life 
as a restaurant in the 1940s, 
closing in 1983 and then re-
opening 16 years later as the 
city’s ﬁrst maison 
d’hôtel. It feels almost 
like a country mansion 
and retains a deﬁnite 
colonial air. Guests 
can use a lovely 
garden pool on the 
outskirts of the city in 
a garden setting.

The small Kaiss is the quint-

Marrakech for Children
! 
Jemaa El Fna
With dancing monkeys, 
snake charmers, acrobats and 
musicians, Jemaa El Fna will 
deﬁnitely capture the children’s 
fancy. However, make sure kids 
have adequate protection from 
the heat, especially during  
the summer months when 
temperatures can top 40º C  
(104º F) (see pp8–11).
@ 
Pony and  
camel rides
Off the main route through the 
Palmeraie among the palms is 
the Tansift Garden that has a 
children’s playground and the 
Palmier d’Or café. Ponies can be 
hired and camels are available 
nearby. d Circuit de la Palmeraie

Calèche trips
On the north side of Place 
de Foucault, just off Jemaa El 
Fna, a ride in brightly painted 
horse-drawn calèches (carriages) 
might be a novel way to enter-
tain kids. The carriages 
circle the medina 
walls or go up to the 
Palmeraie. Prices are 
listed for some tours, 
or negotiate an hourly 
rate (90 Dh is 
reasonable). 
$ 
Swimming
For a small fee, 
the Palmeraie Golf 
Palace will allow non-
guests the use of its swimming 
pools. It has a young children’s 
play area and a bowling alley.

Horse riding
Pony- and horse-riding 
facilities can be found opposite

Moroccan Cuisine
For restaurant listings where you can sample Moroccan cuisine,  
see pp52–3, 65, 71, 79, 85, 93 and 99.
! 
Couscous
A staple cuisine across 
North Africa, couscous comp-
rises tiny grains of semolina that 
are cooked by steaming, which 
causes it to swell and turn light 
and ﬂuffy. It is usually eaten with 
a spicy, harissa-ﬂavoured broth, 
and served with steamed vege-
tables and meat.
@ 
Tajines
Cooked slowly at low 
temperatures in a clay pot with a 
cone-shaped lid, tajines typically 
combine meat with fruits. 
Ingredients for these dishes 
include any foodstuff that braises 
well, such as ﬁsh, beef, dried 
fruits, olives and vegetables.
£ 
Pastilla
Pastilla is a starter as well as 
a main dish. It is a pillow of ﬁlo 
pastry with a sweet and savoury 
stufﬁng – generally shredded 
pigeon cooked with onions. The 
dish is dusted with cinnamon 
to give it that distinctive 
Moroccan ﬂavour.
$ 
Briouettes
Small triangles of ﬁlo 
pastry with a variety of 
ﬁllings, the most 
common being 
minced lamb with 
spices and pine nuts, 
and feta cheese with 
spinach. Some kitchens 
in Marrakech also 
prepare them with 
shrimp, chicken and 
lemon. Their sweet version is 
prepared with groundnuts and 
soaked in honey.
% 
Harira
A traditional Moroccan soup 
made with tomatoes, lentils, 
chickpeas, spices and lamb, it is 
a substantial meal by itself. 
Associated with special 
occasions, it is also served 
during Ramadan when it is eaten 
at sundown to break the fast.
^ 
Moroccan salads
Moroccan salads are served 
at the beginning of a meal. 
Orange blossom water, a 
signature local ingredient, is 
used in the preparation of  
some salads.
& 
Moroccan pastries
The end of a meal is 
often marked with  
a serving of pastries. 
The popular honey 
cakes or chabakia, 
deep-fried and dipped 
in honey, are served 
during Ramadan. Ano-
ther tasty dessert is 
sweet pastilla – a ﬁlo 
pastry covered in 
nuts and crème 
Anglaise (custard).

Top 10 variations on 
a tajine
! Lamb, prune and  
roast almonds
The sliced almonds add 
crunch to the sticky consis-
tency of the prunes. 
@ Lamb, onions and 
almonds
This savoury lamb tajine is a 
great favourite. 
# Lamb and dates
Served at Le Tanjia (see 
p65) and widely used in 
French cuisine.
$ Lamb and pear
The pear all but melts to 
the consistency of a purée. 
Served at La Maison Arabe 
(see p46).
% Veal and green  
peas
The added saffron and ginger 
give this tajine a very special 
taste.
^ Beef with fennel  
and peas
The chefs at La Maison Arabe 
(see p46) make good use of 
beef in this extremely tasty 
tajine.
& Kefta tajine
These are small balls of  
spicy minced meat that are 
slow-cooked in a rich tomato 
sauce, with an egg occa-
sionally added.
* Fish
Apart from Dar Moha (see 
p71), you will ﬁnd the best, 
freshest ﬁsh tajines in 
Essaouira. 
( Lamb and  
artichokes
Strong-ﬂavoured lamb works 
beautifully with caramelised 
onions and artichokes.
) Veal and quince
Those who like a mixture 
of sweet and sour should try 
this popular tajine.
* 
Mint tea
The ubiquitous green tea 
with mint is invariably served 
with vast quantities of sugar. The 
technique of pouring is almost as 
crucial as the drink itself; the 
long, curved teapot spouts allow 
the tea to be poured theatrically, 
the liquid gracefully arcing into 
the small glasses.
( 
Set meals
In cheaper restaurants, set 
meals consist of a starter (soup 
or a salad), a main dish and a 
dessert (fruit or crème caramel). 
The more expensive restaurants 
serve a seemingly limitless 
succession of courses with more 
food than you could possibly eat. 
Indulge in it at least once for a 
true Marrakech experience.
) 
Entertainment
Some restaurants combine 
dining with entertainment, such 
as belly dancing or perfor-
mances by Gnawa musicians. Es 
Saadi (see p111) and Chez Ali 
take kitsch to extremes, with 
acrobats and even snake 
charmers displaying their antics.

Le Foundouk
This stylish restaurant 
serves French and Moroccan 
cuisine. An old courtyard building 
has been given a modern look, 
complete with leather seating 
and a wonderful chandelier. A 
small bar area and a beautiful 
roof terrace provide the perfect 
spot for an aperitif while waiting 
for a table (see p71).
@ 
Dar Moha
Taste Moroccan cuisine as 
reinterpreted by Marrakech’s 
celebrity chef, Moha Fedal. 
Lunch and dinner are set menus 
but the food is unlike anything 
you will eat elsewhere. Gnawa 
musicians add to the ambience 
and perform by the poolside 
during summer (see p71). 
£ 
Al Fassia
This completely women-run 
Moroccan restaurant is unusual 
in that it offers à la carte choices 
rather than a set menu. The 
restaurant has a charming 
garden, but lacks the 
panache of its many 
competitors though it 
compensates with its 
terriﬁc food (see p79). 
$ 
Chez Chegrouni
Don’t go by the 
looks of this modest 
restaurant (the waiter 
writes your order on a 
paper napkin). The 
tajines, couscous  
and brouchettes 
(kebabs) served here are  
tasty and very affordable. The 
atmosphere is terriﬁc, thanks  
to its ringside view of the Jemaa 
El Fna (see p65).
% 
Le Tobsil
Dine at Tobsil for a sump-
tuous experience. Occupying 
two levels of an old house 
around a central court, it is lit up 
by candlelight and has no menu; 
waiters deliver a seemingly 
endless succession of dishes – 
vegetarian meze, pastilla, tajines, 
couscous and pastries (see p71).
^ 
Jemaa El Fna
Each evening, a part of the 
main square in the medina is 
transformed into a vast open-air 
eatery; crowds ﬂock between 
the numerous makeshift kitchens 
set up to prepare food for the 
people assembled. It’s possible 
to sample most Moroccan 
classics, from harrira and 
brochettes to couscous and 
tajines (see pp10–11).

& 
Kechmara
When you couldn’t possibly 
face another tajine, Kechmara is 
a smart, hip bar-restaurant with a 
distinctly European aesthetic. 
The Continental menu includes 
tasty salads, meat in sauces and 
desserts. The atmosphere is light 
and fun and there’s a ﬁne rooftop 
terrace (see p79).  
* 
Dar Yacout
This restaurant‘s as famous 
an attraction as the Koutoubia or 
the Mamounia. Much of its 
reputation rests on its interior, a 
striking mix of the traditional and 
the bizarre, with ﬂowering colu-
mns and quaint candy-striped 
ﬁreplaces. Sit at the mother-of-
pearl-inset tables and feast on 
the limitless set menu (see p71). 
( 
Comptoir
Located in a two-storey villa, 
this remains the best venue for a 
night out in town. Always 
packed, the noise levels are 
invariably high, with voices 
competing with the DJ.  While 
the food is good, with saveurs 
d’ici (Moroccan) and saveurs 
d’ailleurs (French), it is the 
atmosphere that makes 
Comptoir memorable, especially 
on weekend nights when diners 
are entertained by belly dancers 
(see p79).
) 
Le Tanjia
Like Comptoir, Le Tanjia 
excels in ramping up the atmos-
phere to almost nightclub-like 
levels, with a bevy of genuinely 
sexy belly dancers. Apart from 
the show, the menu lists some 
unforgettable Moroccan classics, 
such as the mouthwatering lamb 
meshaoui (see p65).

Kasbah du Toubkal
A former tribal stronghold 
deep in the Atlas Mountains, this 
kasbah is at the foot of Jbel 
Toubkal. The last part of the  
journey is done by mule. Visitors 
are brought up for a Berber lunch 
and a hike and delivered back 
into town before dark. You can 
even stay overnight at the 
kasbah (see p93). 
@ 
Essaouira
This medieval walled port-
city on the Atlantic coast a few 
hours from Marrakech, boasts 
rampart walks, souks, beaches, a 
ﬁshing harbour and a fascinating 
hippy-era history (see pp80–83).  
£ 
Barrage Lalla Takarkoust
To the south of Marrakech 
on Route d’Amizmiz, this is an 
impressive artiﬁcial lake with the 
Atlas Mountains as a backdrop. 
The clear water makes it a great 
place to go swimming. You can 
also take out one of the boats 
for hire. Try out the fare at the 
many waterside restaurants, 
including the long-established 
Relais du Lac, which also offers 
accommodation. d Map C2 • Relais

Oukaimeden
Marrakech also serves as a 
base for skiing for a part of the 
year. Snowfall on the Atlas 
between February and April 
means business for the ski 
resort at Oukaimeden high above 
the Ourika Valley. There is a 
chairlift and ski equipment can 
be hired on site. The Bronze Age 
petroglyphs are an attraction in 
spring and summer. d Map C2 
% 
Kasbah Telouet
Travellers to Ouarzazate 
invariably call on the imposing 
mountain palace of Telouet, but if 
your plans don’t include a trip 
south of the Atlas, then visit the 
kasbah on a day trip from 
Marrakech. A daily bus goes to 
Telouet or you can hire a taxi for 
the day; ask your hotel 
to arrange it (see p95).
^ 
Tin Mal
About two hours’ 
drive south of 
Marrakech, the 
ancient, restored 
mosque of Tin Mal 
makes for a stunning 
day out in case a full 
trip over the Tizi-n-
Test pass is not 
possible. If you go on

Cheap buses head over the mountains, or you could hire a car or 
your own driver in the form of a grand taxi. For details, see p104.

Saturday, you can 
stop over at Asni’s 
weekly market en

pp89–91).

Setti Fatma
You will ﬁnd 
this small village, 
hidden away an 
hour’s drive south 
of the city, at the 
head of the Ourika 
Valley in the 
foothills of the Atlas 
Mountains. It’s the starting point 
for a 15-minute stroll up to a ﬁne 
waterfall and pool – and then a 
strenuous hike up a steep valley 
to six more falls. d Map C2 
* 
Country markets
Several small villages in the 
vicinity of Marrakech host 
weekly markets. Villagers from 
surrounding regions ﬂock to 
them to buy and sell produce, 
cheap clothing and assorted bric-
a-brac. Donkeys and mules are 
the dominant means of 
transport. Cattle auctions are 
also common, as are makeshift 
salons of travelling barbers and 
dentists. Ask your hotel for 
details on where and when to 
ﬁnd them.

Tameslohte
A 20-minute drive 
out of Marrakech on 
the Route d’Amizmiz,  
Tameslohte is a 
roadside village famed 
for its busy potters’ 
cooperative. There’s 
also an ancient mule-
driven olive oil press, 
weavers’ workshops 
and a crumbling 
kasbah. Start your trip 
by paying a visit to  
the Association 
Tameslohte, an information ofﬁce

Two hours northeast on

beautiful waterfalls in Morocco. 
Trek through wooded groves

T
HE SPIRITUAL AND HISTORICAL HEART OF MARRAKECH, the Jemaa El Fna 
(pronounced as a rushed “j’maf na”) was laid out as a parade ground by 
the city’s founders (see pp8–11). After the new rulers of Marrakech 
constructed a walled royal domain to the south – known as the kasbah – the 
open ground passed into the public domain. Sultans have come and gone 
and royal palaces have risen and fallen, but the Jemaa El Fna remains 
eternally vital. Used earlier to display the heads of executed criminals, it is 
still home to some extraordinary sights, like snake 
charmers and monkey trainers. By night, it 
transforms into a busy eating area.

! 
Koutoubia Mosque
The Koutoubia Mosque  
is easily identiﬁed by its 
magniﬁcent minaret or tower. 
And what a beautiful structure it 
is; at a towering height of 77 
metres (252 ft), its rose pink 
colour makes for an eye-catching 
contrast, silhouetted against the 
cobalt blue sky by daylight and in 
the ﬁery orange twilight of the 
evenings (see pp12–13). Only 
Muslims are permitted inside  
the mosque.
@ 
Rue de Bab Agnaou
Running south off Jemaa  
El Fna, this is the medina’s 
pedestrianised “modern” main 
street. Though not a particularly 
picturesque street, it is a very 
servicable one with postcard 
sellers, cash-dispensing ATMs, 
telephone ofﬁces, pharmacies 
and internet cafés. Its narrow 
side alleys are home to hotels 
that are easy on the wallet. 
While in the city, you will def-
initely ﬁnd yourself making  
a trip here to make use of  
its many facilities. d Map J4
£ 
Saadian Tombs
The historic Saadian tombs 
are located down a narrow 
passageway that runs beside the 
Kasbah Mosque, 
which itself is just 
inside the beautiful 
and equally historic 
Bab Agnaou (see 
p18). The small 
garden site is the ﬁnal 
resting place for 
some 66 royals who 
belonged to the 
Saadian dynasty, 
whose reign marked a 
golden era in the 
history of the city  
(see p20–21).
$ 
Badii Palace
It is difﬁcult to reconcile 
these ruins with a palace once  
reputed to be among the world’s 
ﬁnest. An expanse of dusty 
ground within half-eroded walls, 
it retains some of its old elem-
ents, including sunken gardens 
and a dazzling piece of Moorish 
craftsmanship (see pp24–5).
% 
Rue Riad Zitoun El Kedim
This “Street of the Old Olive 
Garden” connects Jemaa El Fna 
with the palace quarter. At its 
north end a narrow lane squeezed 
between the blank walls of 
mosques and town houses, it 
widens southwards where it’s 
lined with workshops. d Map K4

Souk El Bab Salaam
Around Town – Jemaa El Fna and the Kasbah
^ 
Mellah
The old Jewish quarter lies 
immediately east of the kasbah. 
You can enter via the Souk El 
Bab Salaam, a busy, covered 
market street across from a 
rose-planted square. This street 
leads to Place Souweka and just 
to the north you’ll ﬁnd one of the 
city’s last working synagogues. 
Most of the Jewish population of 
Marrakech left for Israel after the 
Second World War, in the 1940s 
and 1950s, but the number of 
graves in the nearby Miâara 
Jewish cemetery is testament to 
how many there once were.

Bahia Palace
Built in the 1890s by a 
powerful grand vizier (high 
ofﬁcial), the Bahia (“Brilliant”) is 
a minor palace complex 
approached by a long garden 
driveway. Inside, arrows direct 
visitors through a succession of 
courtyards and private rooms 
that were used by the vizier and 
his four wives. All the rooms are 
lavishly decorated with zellij tiling 
(see p36), sculpted stucco and 
carved cedarwood. The ruling 
sultan, Abdel Aziz, was so 
jealous of the riches of the Bahia 
that on the vizier’s death he had 
the palace stripped and looted.

the Bahia Palace and Dar Si Said

The King and his Palaces
Throughout Moroccan history, the 
royal court has shifted base 
between Fès, Meknès, Rabat and 
Marrakech. The Almohads furni-
shed Marrakech with its ﬁrst royal 
palace south of Jemaa El Fna in 
the 12th century and it’s been 
there ever since. The present King 
Mohammed VI had a smaller 
palace built for his personal use, 
outside the Bab Agnaou.

Around Town – Jemaa El Fna and the Kasbah
To the palaces
Morning
Start on Jemaa El Fna 
(see p61). On the south 
side is an arch that leads 
through Rue Riad Zitoun 
El Kedim (see p61). This 
area is mainly inhabited  
by locals and there’s an 
absence of souvenir and 
trinket vendors. At the 
southern end of the street, 
several places sell items 
fashioned out of old car 
tyres, from the purely 
practical (buckets) to the 
quirky (stylish mirror 
frames). Over the main 
road, is the Marché 
Couvert (see p64), a fruit, 
vegetable and meat 
market, worth a quick look. 
Then just southeast is the 
Place des Ferblantiers 
(see p64), a paved plaza 
surrounded by metal-
workers, with a gate that 
leads through to the haunt-
ing Badii Palace (see p61). 
After visiting the ruins, 
grab a cheap snack on the 
northwest corner of Place 
des Ferblantiers.
Afternoon
Wander through the Souk 
El Bab Salaam (see p64) 
before heading back north 
up the Rue Riad Zitoun El 
Jedid. At the end of the 
street, on the right is the 
gateway to the Bahia 
Palace but anyone pushed 
for time should turn right 
and take the ﬁrst left to 
the excellent Dar Si Said 
Museum. Along Rue Riad 
Zitoun El Jedid to the left 
is Riad Tamsna, worth 
dropping in to shop, have 
a cup of tea or simply 
admire. Further north is a 
good little boutique, 
Jamade (see p64). Pass 
by the Cinéma Eden, one 
of the city’s few open-air 
picture houses, and bear

The Souks
N
ORTH OF JEMAA EL FNA is one vast area of tightly squeezed commerce 
with dozens of narrow alleyways, all lined with shops the size of 
cupboards selling cloth, leather, metalwork, brass lanterns, carpets and 
jewellery. Each area is dedicated to a single item, so a street might be 
packed with nothing but sellers of canary-yellow leather slippers and another 
with vendors of glazed pottery. Don’t fall for the sellers’ ﬂattering cry, “Hey 
my friend, for you I give special price”: it always pays to haggle. Irrespective 
of whether you are buying or not, it is an entrancing experience.

Mouassine Fountain
Fondouk El Mizane
! 
Mouassine Fountain
There are two main routes 
into the souks: Rue Mouassine 
and Rue Semarine. The former 
runs past the Mouassine 
Mosque, after which the neigh-
bourhood is named. A right turn 
at the mosque leads to a small 
plaza that holds a fountain with 
four bays, three for animals and 
one for humans. An arched 
gateway next to the fountain 
leads to the Souk des Teinturiers  
(see below). d Map J2 
@ 
Dar Cherifa
This beautifully renovated 
town house can be located by 
following the signs at the head 
of the alley opposite the side of 
the Mouassine Mosque. Boast-
ing exquisite woodwork and 
carved plasterwork, some of the 
interiors date back to the 16th 
century. The house operates as a 
cultural centre, hosting regular 
shows by local artists. There’s 
also a small library and tea and 
coffee served. d Map J2 • 8 derb 
Charfa Lakbir, Mouassine • 0524 39 16 09 
• Open 9am–7pm daily • www.
marrakech-riads.net 
£ 
Fondouks
 To the north of the 
Mouassine Mosque, past Café 
Arabe (see p71), is an excellent 
example of a fondouk or old 
merchants’ hostel. Currently the 
rooms on the ground ﬂoor are 
used as workshops and the ones 
upstairs are mainly used for 
storage purposes. This particular 
fondouk has had a brush with 
moviedom, when it featured  
in the ﬁlm Hideous Kinky as  
the hotel where actress Kate  
Winslet and her daughters are 
shown to be lodged. d Map J2  
• 192 rue Mouassine 
$ 
Souk des Teinturiers
One of the most alluring 
places in Marrakech, the Dyers’ 
Souk is a tangle of narrow 
alleyways east of the 
Mouassine Mosque. It 
becomes a riot of 
colours during the 
days, when hanks of 
just-dyed wools are 
hung out to dry above 
certain alleys. The 
dyers themselves are 
very easy to identify; 
they are the men  
with red, purple  
and blue colours  
up to their elbows  
(see p14).

68
Around Town – The Souks
A “three monuments” pass for 60 Dh gives admission to Musée 
de Marrakech, Medersa Ben Youssef and the Koubba El Badiyin.
The Tanneries
The Seven Saints
Marrakech has seven patron 
saints, all of whom are believed 
to be sleeping and will one day 
rise again. The medina is dotted 
with the green-roofed shrines of 
the saints, all off limits to non- 
Muslims, though it is possible to 
walk through the outer precincts 
of the Shrine of Sidi Bel Abbes. 
Once a year, pilgrims ﬂood into 
the city to visit a shrine a day.
% 
The Kissaria
The deepest part of the 
souks, the kissaria is a tight 
grouping of narrow, parallel alleys 
that run, much like the rungs of  
a ladder, between the Souk El 
Kebir and Souk des Babouches. 
Most of the shops are no bigger 
than cupboards and the passage-
way between them scarcely 
wide enough for two people to 
pass. A visit here is like stepping 
into the past, until a shopkeeper 
enquires whether you’d like to 
pay by cash or card. d Map K2 
^ 
Musée de Marrakech
While the museum’s exhibits 
are generally unengaging – the 
rotating collection includes cera-
mics and a thin collection of 
traditional crafts – the building 
itself is splendid. A ﬁnely resto-
red 19th-century palace, it once 
belonged to a member of the 
royal court. An impressive central 
court has an imposing chandelier, 
while the former hammam makes 
an unusual exhibition space. d 
Map K2 • Place Ben Youssef • 0524 44 18

holidays) • Adm • www.musee.ma 
& 
Medersa Ben Youssef
North of the Musée de 
Marrakech, the Medersa is an 
even more stunning building. A 
16th-century theological college, 
it has tiny, windowless cells for 
several hundred students and a 
still functioning bathroom. The 
real glory, however, is the central 
courtyard, which combines poly- 
chromic tiling, decorative plaster-
work and carved-wood panelling 
to sublime effect (see pp22–3).
* 
Koubba El Badiyin
The dusty open plaza across 
the Musée de Marrakech is 
named after the Ben Youssef 
Mosque, lying beyond a wall on 
the north side. Although non-
Muslims are forbidden to enter 
the mosque, all visitors are 
allowed into the Koubba El 
Badiyin, a small domed structure 
that sits alone in its own garden. 
This is the only surviving structure 
from the Almoravids era, the 
founders of Marrakech. The 
underside of the dome carries a 
beautiful eight-pointed star motif.

Souk des Teinturiers
Hidden Marrakech
Morning
Wrong turns and too many 
distractions make it 
impossible to plan a walk 
through the souks, which 
you should explore by 
yourself. On another day, 
head up Rue Mouassine. 
At the ﬁrst crossroads, 
look left: a lantern dangles 
above the door of the 
Kssour Agafay (see p45), 
the city’s exclusive 
“members’ club” (ask and 
you might be allowed to 
look around). Continue 
north and take the next 
left, then the ﬁrst right to 
the gem that is Dar 
Cherifa (see p67). Return 
to Rue Mouassine and 
turn left at the T-junction. 
Take the ﬁrst right through 
a low archway; follow the 
alley left and then right to 
No. 22 and ring the bell for 
Ministerio del Gusto, a 
studio and gallery (9am–
noon, 4–7pm). Back on the 
main street, take a left to 
the Mouassine Fountain 
(see p67) and then start 
heading northward. Stop 
at the Café Arabe (see 
p71) for lunch.
Afternoon
Ahead of the café is the 
fondouk made famous in 
Hideous Kinky (see p67). 
The Shrine of Sidi Abdel 
Aziz is barred to non- 
Muslims, so take a left. 
On Rue Dar El Bacha, you 
will ﬁnd many antique 
emporiums and the Dar El 
Bacha. Along Rue Bab 
Doukkala, stop at the 
shopping emporium, 
Mustapha Blaoui (see 
p70). Walk west past the 
Bab Doukkala Mosque, 
through a street market to 
the Bab Doukkala gate 
(see p19) and the exit from 
the medina; this place is 
packed with taxis – it is  
10 Dh to Jemaa El Fna. 
hides are turned into leather. The 
work is done by hand and 
involves the hides being soaked 
in open vats, which look like a 
paintbox of watercolours from a 
distance, but up close smell foul, 
like cesspits. The guides who 
show visitors around hand out 
sprigs of mint to hold under your 
nose. If you venture this far, pay 
a visit to the Bab Debbagh, 
which is located nearby (see 
p19). d Map L1
) 
Dar El Bacha
This is the former residence 
of Thami El Glaoui (see pp33 and 
96), the much feared and little 
loved ruler of Marrakech and 
southern Morocco during the 
ﬁrst half of the 20th century. This 
is where the Glaoui entertained 
guests such as Winston Churchill 
and kept his extensive harem. 
But beyond the colourful history 
associated with the place, the 
complex veers towards the 
tawdry. Parts of the palace, 
currently closed to visitors, are 
set to open as an archaeological 
museum. d Map J2 • Rue Dar El

The New City
I
T WAS ONLY WITH THE ARRIVAL of the French in the early 20th century that 
Marrakech broke out of the walls of the medina. The new colonial rulers 
preferred to live away from the native quarters and so built their own 
nouvelle ville of broad avenues, villas and parks. Over time, Moroccans 
aspiring for a better lifestyle moved out into this new town, lured by 
serviceable plumbing, electricity and cars. Now known as Guéliz – from the 
name of the hill that rises 
above it – the New City has 
plenty for tourists looking to 
explore the city’s modern 
facet. The streets are lined 
with plenty of ﬁne 
restaurants, some good 
shopping options and a 
throbbing nightlife culture.

Avenue Mohammed V
The wide avenue named 
after Morocco’s ﬁrst king is the 
spine of Marrakech. It connects 
the old and new cities, running 
from the Koutoubia to Jbel 
Guéliz (Mount Guéliz), a grandly 
named rocky outcrop northwest 
of the town. Along the way are 
three major trafﬁc circles: Place 
de la Liberté with its modern 
fountain; Place du 16 Novembre 
where the main post ofﬁce is 
located; and the heart of the 
New City, Place Abdel Moumen 
Ben Ali. d Map C5 
@ 
Mauresque architecture
The French brought with 
them European architectural 
styles which mixed with local 
Moorish inﬂuences, to create a 
new style, dubbed “Mauresque”. 
Avenue Mohammed V is dotted 
with structures that were built 
within this particular style, 
especially where it intersects 
with Rue de la Liberté; here 
several buildings have clean 
Modernist lines but also have 
pavement arcades to shade 
pedestrians from the blazing 
North African sun.
£ 
Marché Central
The once popular central 
market has suffered from the 
arrival of edge-of-town 
hypermarkets and by its 
relocation. From a former prime 
site on Avenue Mohammed V, it 
has now shifted to its current 
home, buried behind the 
enormous new Marrakech Plaza 
development on Place 16 
Novembre. Still, the handful of 
adjacent ﬂower shops in the 
market make for a colourful 
scene. There are also one or two 
good handicraft shops that are 
worth visiting. d Map C5 • Rue Ibn 
Toumert • Open 7am–2pm, 4–8pm Mon–
Sat, 7am–2pm Sun 
$ 
Église des Saints-Martyrs 
de Marrakech 
Built in 1926, the otherwise 
spartan interior of this Catholic 
church is enlivened only by 
colourful panels of stained glass 
and stands as a tribute to six 
13th-century Franciscan friars 
who were beheaded by the 
sultan as a punishment for 
preaching Christianity. The 
church’s bell tower is now  
almost entirely overshadowed  
by the minaret of an adjacent 
mosque. Protestant services are 
conducted in the library.

Majorelle Gardens
A ten-minute walk east of 
Place Abdel Moumen Ben Ali, 
these are the absolute 
must-see sight in the 
New City. Created in 
the 1920s and 1930s 
by French painter 
Jacques Majorelle, the 
artist’s former studio 
now houses an 
Islamic Art Museum. 
The gardens were 
owned by French 
couturier Yves Saint-
Laurent until his death 
and are open to the 
public (see pp26–7).

Théâtre Royal 
This striking piece of 
architecture by leading local light, 
Charles Boccara, is crowned by a 
grand dome. The interior has a 
beautiful, tiled courtyard linking a 
1,200-seat open-air theatre and 
an 800-seat opera house. Since 
its inauguration in September 
2001, the theatre has only been 
used sporadically but an 
exhibition hall housed here  
displays the work of local artists 
and sculptors. d Map B5 • Ave

North of Boulevard 
Mohammed Zerktouni is a walled 
graveyard dating back to the 
1920s. It is the burial 
ground of many of the 
original inhabitants of 
Guéliz. A white 
obelisk is  dedicated 
to the North African 
soldiers who died 
ﬁghting to free France 
during World War II – a 
little known historical 
episode that was 
brought to the world’s 
attention in the award-
winning ﬁlm Days of

Spanish Quarter
Running west off Rue de 
Yougoslavie is a narrow street 
lined with single-
storey houses of a 
unique design, much 
like terraced cottages. 
This single lane, 
planted with mulberry 
trees, constitutes the 
city’s old Spanish 
quarter, a testament 
to Marrakech’s once 
considerable Hispanic 
population. This is 
possibly the only 
street in the whole of 
Marrakech in which 
Hippyville
Before the medina’s hotel boom, 
those who couldn’t afford the 
Mamounia, or considered it too 
establishment, stayed in Guéliz. 
The Es Saadi in Hivernage was 
popular with the Rolling Stones, 
while Beat writer William 
Burroughs shacked up at Hotel 
Toulousain (see p112). The big  
hippy hang out at the time was 
the Renaissance.

The old Cinema Palace, Spanish Quarter
Start next to the Koutoubia 
Mosque and head up 
Avenue Mohammed V. 
After a few minutes you 
will come to Ensemble 
Artisanal (see p70) on the 
right, a government-run 
handicraft store. Over the 
road is Arset Moulay 
Abdesslem (see p43) 
known as “Cyber Park”, 
after its internet centre. 
Exit the medina from 
Mohammed V through the 
Bab Nkob, plunging into 
the large trafﬁc island, 
Place de la Liberté. A 
second left after the  
trafﬁc junction, followed by 
the ﬁrst right, will lead you 
to historic Église des 
Saints-Martyrs de 
Marrakech (see p75). 
Continue north up Avenue 
Yacoub Marini to reach 
Jnane El Harti park. 
Lunch at the Grand Café 
de la Poste (see p79), 
hidden from view behind 
the main post ofﬁce.
The road next to 
McDonald’s leads to the 
Marché Central, (see 
p78), a worthwhile 15-
minute detour. Return to 
Mohammed V for some of 
the best shopping in town, 
particularly around Rue de 
la Liberté (see p78). The 
next major trafﬁc inter-
section, Place Abdel 
Moumen Ben Ali, is 
overlooked by two 
pavement cafés: Les 
Negociants and Atlas 
(see p54); if you’re after 
some authentic Moroccan 
food, try Al Fassia (see 
p79) on Boulevard 
Mohammed Zerktouni. You 
have the option of several 
good restaurants if you 
fancy a meal (see p79).  
A taxi back to the medina 
will cost around 20 Dh.
the buildings are not a uniform 
shade of pink. You will ﬁnd 
instead houses painted in a  
variety of bright colours. d Map B5 
( 
Jnane El Harti
A small and very pretty park 
just off Place du 16 Novembre, it  
was originally laid out by the 
French as a formal garden and 
zoo. In a 1939 essay titled 
“Marrakech”, George Orwell (see 
p34) writes of feeding gazelles 
here. Numerous notices provide 
information about the various 
species of plants growing in the 
many ﬂowerbeds. The plaza 
fronting the park gates is often 
used for events. d Map C5
) 
Hivernage
South of Guéliz and 
immediately west of the medina 
walls, Hivernage is a small neigh-
bourhood of quiet streets that 
are shaded by trees. Its mix of 
villas and a handful of ﬁve-star 
hotels ensures a tranquil atmos-
phere with light pedestrian 
trafﬁc. There are one or two 
good restaurants in the area, 
including the city’s favourite 
nightspot, Comptoir (see p54).

HERE MARRAKECH IS A UNIFORM pink, this sun-beaten town on the 
Atlantic coast is blue and white. The prosperity of the place peaked in 
the 18th and 19th centuries, when it was the most important port on the 
North African coast. It faded from consciousness in the 20th century, but drew 
plenty of travelling hippies in the 1960s and early 1970s. Its agreeably 
languid atmosphere is stirred only in late afternoon when the ﬁshing ﬂeet 
returns. It is known as the Wind City because of the constant winds.

Place Moulay Hassan
Essaouira port
! 
Ramparts
Essaouira‘s current layout 
can be traced back to 1765. That 
year, the town’s local ruler 
captured a French ship and hired 
one of its passengers, an 
architect, to rebuild his port. He 
had the city surrounded with a 
heavy defensive wall, much of 
which still stands. The most 
impressive stretch is the Skala 
de la Ville, where you can walk 
along the top of the ramparts 
and examine several ancient 
cannons. d Map N1
@ 
Place Moulay Hassan
Place Moulay Hassan is the 
focal point of Essaouira. A 
square in two parts, narrow and 
elongated to the north and open-
ing out at the southern end, it 
lies between the medina proper 
and the port, and everybody 
passes through it at some point. 
It’s lined by small cafés, where 
half the town seems to pass  
half of its time. d Map N2
£ 
The port
Guarded by a toy-like, square 
fortress, Essaouira’s port, the 
Skala du Port, is still a working 
concern complete with a boat 
yard, where vessels are still 
constructed out of wood. A daily 
market kicks into life between 
3pm and 5pm with the arrival of 
the day’s catch. Visitors can 
watch as the ﬁsh are auctioned 
off and follow that up by feasting 
on fresh sardines, grilled to order 
at the port end of Place Moulay 
Hassan. d Map N2
$ 
The medina
As in Marrakech, 
Essaouira’s medina is 
a labyrinth of narrow 
streets. It is, however, 
not as hard to navi-
gate, bisected as it is 
by one long, straight 
street. This street 
begins at the port and 
runs all the way up to 
the north gate, the 
Bab Doukkala, under-
going two name chan-
ges along the way.

The Spice Souk
Music city
A popular hippy stopover in the 
late 1960s, Jimi Hendrix famously 
passed through, as did Frank 
Zappa. Cat Stevens, now Yusuf 
Islam, still returns each summer. 
The hippy inﬂuence lingers on 
here: the annual Gnawa Festival 
d’Essaouira (see p44) attracts 
musicians from around the globe 
and has been described as the 
world’s biggest jam session.
% 
The mellah
During the 18th and 19th 
centuries, a Jewish community 
gained prominence in Essaouira, 
becoming the most important 
economic group. They have all 
long since left and the town’s 
Jewish quarter is in a dilapidated 
state. You can reach the mellah 
by following the alleys just inside 
the ramparts beyond Skala de la 
Ville. You can still identify the 
former Jewish residences, 
fronted as they are by balconies. 
In some cases, the Hebrew 
inscriptions on their lintels are 
also visible. d Map Q1
^ 
The souks
At the heart of the medina is 
a lively market, the Souk Jdid, 
divided into four quarters by the 
intersection of two main thoro-
ughfares. There is a daily souk 
for ﬁsh, spice and grains and a 
cloistered square, known as the 
Joutia, where secondhand items 
are auctioned. d Map P1
& 
Place Orson Welles
Between the medina walls 
and the beach, a small park-like 
square goes by the name of 
Place Orson Welles, in honour of 
the great ﬁlmmaker who came 
to Essaouira in 1949 to shoot his 
version of Othello. Since then,  
Essaouira and the surrounding 
area have been used as movie 
locations in many international 
ﬁlm projects, the most recent 
ones being Oliver Stone’s epic  
Alexander the Great and Ridley 
Scott’s Kingdom of Heaven.

south of the medina, is one of

The beach at Essaouria
A day by the sea
Morning
It is possible to do  
Essaouira as a day trip 
from Marrakech. You can 
get an early morning CTM 
bus from gare routière 
(see p104), a Supratours 
coach at 8:30am or a grand 
taxi from a rank behind 
the bus station and arrive 
by 10 or 11am (although 
Essaouira is worth at least 
a couple of days). You will 
probably enter the city 
from the Bab Marrakech 
and follow Rue Mohammed 
El Qorry to the main 
crossroads of the medina, 
which is also the middle of 
the souks. Walk south 
down Avenue de L’Istiqlal, 
taking a right turn into 
shop-lined Rue Attarine. A 
ﬁrst left leads down to 
Place Moulay Hassan 
(see p81), a great place for 
a snack at one of the many 
cafés. Follow the squawks 
of the seagulls south to 
the port (see p81) and a 
lunch of grilled sardines.
Afternoon
From the port, backtrack to 
Place Moulay Hassan but 
take a left at the famed 
Taros café (see p85) and 
follow the narrow alley, 
Rue de la Skala, on the 
inside of the high sea wall. 
There are some interesting 
boutiques here. After a 
short walk, a ramp leads 
up to the ramparts (see 
p81) for a wonderful view. 
Descend and then 
continue to the mellah, 
the old Jewish quarter. 
Find your way back to the 
souks and again follow 
Avenue de L’Istiqlal south. 
Take a left along Avenue 
du Caire, exiting by the 
Bab Sbâa and turning left 
for the beach. The Chalet 
de la Plage (see p85) is 
perfect for an early (or 
late) dinner by the ocean.

For about a quarter of a 
century, a generation of painters 
and sculptors have made 
Essaouira an important centre of

HE HIGH-ALTITUDE TIZI-N-TEST PASS, the westerly of the two great passes 
over the Atlas Mountains, is cautiously navigated by the R203 highway to 
Taroudant. Although the distance between the two cities is only 223 km (138 
miles), the road’s tortuous hairpins demand such respect from drivers that 
the journey takes nearly ﬁve hours. Not to mention the time needed to stop 
off at the many sights along the way. If you don’t have your own vehicle or 
grand taxi, you can make the trip by public transport: buses depart Marrakech 
early each morning, taking up to eight hours to reach Taroudant.

Entrance to the Asni market
! 
Tahanoute
This administrative centre is 
just a 20-minute drive south of 
Marrakech. The old village has a 
cascade of red clay houses, 
surrounding a massive rock shel-
tering the shrine of Sidi Mohammed 
El Kebir, whose festival is celeb-
rated at Mouloud, the Prophet’s 
birthday. It was the subject of 
Winston Churchill’s last painting 
in 1958. Every Tuesday, a country 
market is held here. d Map C1 
@ 
Moulay Brahim
South of Tahanoute, the road 
winds uphill to Moulay Brahim, 
named after a local saint, with a 
green-roofed shrine dedicated to 
him in the middle of the village 
(entry to non-Muslims is 
forbidden). The shrine is a 
popular pilgrimage spot, espe-
cially for women with fertility 
problems. d Map C2 
£ 
Asni
The village of Asni lies at a 
fork in the road – a left turn leads 
up to the village of Imlil and the 
striking kasbahs Tamadot and 
Toubkal (see p56). Jbel Toubkal 
dominates the view to the west, 
but there’s little for visitors to 
explore at Asni itself, apart from 
shops selling trinkets (things are 
cheaper in Marrakech). The 
highlight is the busy country 
market held on Saturdays – the 
largest in the Atlas. d Map C2

Jbel Toubkal
Take the left fork at Asni to 
Imlil at the foot of Jbel Toubkal, 
North Africa’s highest peak. 
Mountain guides can be hired in 
Imlil at the bureau des guides in 
the centre of the village. There 
are some basic budget hotels 
here, but the Kasbah du Toubkal 
just up the hill is a better option  
(see p93). d Map C2 • Bureau des

Argan Oil
The precious Argan trees, similar 
in appearance to olive trees, are 
found only in southwestern 
Morocco. They bear a fruit from 
which oil can be extracted by 
splitting, roasting and pressing 
the nuts. Locals use it as a 
medicine; it’s also a staple of 
beauty and massage treatments 
and tastes delicious when it’s 
drizzled on couscous.

Ouirgane
Ouirgane, 16 km (10 miles) 
south of Asni, is a pretty little 
place. The actual village is 
hidden among the trees 
along the valley above the 
Oued Niﬁs river. There’s 
a Jewish saint’s shrine 
and two salt factories 
(one modern, one 
traditional). Stop by for 
lunch or, if you plan on 
lingering in the village, 
spend the night at one of 
the two enchanting hotels 
– La Roseraie and the Au 
Sanglier Qui Fume (see p93) – 
for which the place is best 
known. d Map C2

Kasbah Talaat-n-Yacoub
South of Ouirgane, the road 
climbs steadily through a rocky, 
bare landscape. After passing 
through the small Berber hamlet 
of Ijoujak, visible off 
to the right is the 
commanding hilltop 
fortress of Kasbah 
Talaat-n-Yacoub. This 
was once a strong-
hold of the Goundaﬁ 
tribe who controlled 
access to the Tizi-n-
Test until the early 
20th century, when 
they were subdued 
by the French.

Tin Mal 
The main attraction at Tin 
Mal is an ancient mosque that 
dates back to the time of the 
Almohads (see p32). Way back  
in the 12th century, this was the 
heart of a mountain empire that 
had uniﬁed local tribes under a 
militant version of Islam. It was 
from here that an army set out in 
1144 to lay siege to Marrakech 
and went on to conquer the rest 
of Morocco. This mountain 
mosque provided the basic  
architectural prototype for the 
impressive Koutoubia in 
Marrakech. Though rooﬂess, it 
continues to be the venue for 
Friday prayers, the one day  
when it remains inacce-
ssible to visitors. d Map C2

How much you 
enjoy the experience of 
this 2,092-m (6,861-ft) pass

have to keep your eyes glued to

Taroudant
Built on the proceeds of gold 
brought from the Sahara, 
Taroudant was the capital of the 
Saadian empire early in the 16th 
century. Today, enclosed within 
reddish-yellow walls, it 
resembles a smaller, sleepier 
version of Marrakech. It features 
a grand kasbah that can be 
reached by passing under the 
triple-arched Saadian Gates, as 
well as some foul-smelling 
tanneries. You will also ﬁnd two 
excellent souks here, including 
the Arab Souk, with its focus on 
traditional crafts. d Map B2 
) 
Tichka Plateau
A highland plateau of 
beautiful meadows, the Tichka 
Plateau is found to the north of 
Taroudant. Particularly striking in 
spring when the wild ﬂowers are 
in full bloom, it’s a ﬁne place to 
go trekking but best enjoyed 
with qualiﬁed guides. Go to the 
bureau des guides in Imlil (see 
p89) to arrange for one. d Map B2 
As you walk east on 
Avenue Moulay Rachid 
through an orange tree-
lined path, you will come 
upon the triple-arched 
Saadian Gates at Bab El 
Kasbah. These lead to the 
walled kasbah quarter 
built by Mohammed ech-
Cheikh who made it the 
capital of the Saadian 
empire. The poorest part 
of town, it used to house 
the governor’s palace, now 
the very chic Hotel Palais 
Salam (see p93). Stop at 
the hotel for a snack and 
then make your way back 
to the Bab El Kasbah. Hop 
into one of the waiting 
calèches and for a small 
fee, do a circuit of the city 
walls.  You can take the 
calèche back to Place El 
Alaouyine or your hotel.
Though Taroudant resem-
bles a more ramshackle 
Marrakech at ﬁrst sight, it 
has more of an African 
than Arab identity. Unlike 
most other Moroccan 
cities, it was never under 
French occupation and so 
doesn’t possess a 
European quarter. Begin 
your exporation of the city 
on Place El Alaouyine, 
known by its Berber name 
as Place Assarag. Follow 
Avenue Mohammed V 
south of the square and 
head east into Souk 
Arabe, famed for its 
antique shops. At the 
souk’s edge, Boulangerie 
El Widad offers tasty 
Moroccan pastries. South 
of the main street, across 
Place El Nasr is Souk 
Berbère the main fruit and 
vegetables market. Return 
north up Ave Bir Anzarené 
and take a right on Avenue 
Moulay Rachid; sample the  
tajines at Chez Nada.

Around Town – Tizi-n-Tichka Pass
T
HE N9 HIGHWAY RUNS FROM Marrakech south over the Atlas Mountains, 
crossing the country’s highest pass. On the other side, it then descends 
down to the town of Ouarzazate, considered to be the gateway to the Sahara. 
Along this route, you will come across some interesting sights, including the 
the kasbahs of Telouet and Aït Benhaddou (off the main road). From start to 
ﬁnish, the route is 196 km (122 miles) on a good road. However, there are 
some tortuous stretches that demand careful driving; as a result, the journey 
invariably takes nearly four hours. Travellers can arrange for a grand taxi or 
hire a car. Alternatively, several Ouarzazate buses travel this route daily from 
Marrakech’s main bus station. Supratours runs daily trips to Ouarzazate.

Aït Ourir
This is no more than a small 
roadside hamlet, 35 km (22 
miles) outside Marrakech. 
However, the place comes to life 
each Friday when it hosts a 
weekly country market. If you 
choose to pass through on the 
right day, it makes for a diverting 
hour-long stop off. d Map C1 
@ 
Taddert 
After Aït Ourir, the road 
starts to climb. The last halt 
before the pass is the busy 
village of Taddert, set among 
walnut groves. In the higher part 
of the settlement, a handful of 
good cafés offer views of the 
valley below. When the pass is 
closed by bad weather, a barrier 
is lowered here to halt all south 
bound trafﬁc. d Map C1 
£ 
Tizi-n-Tichka Pass
As the road leaves Taddert 
the greenery comes to an  
end and the landscape turns  
scenically barren and rugged.  
The twisting road with precipi-
tous drops will keep drivers’ 
eyes ﬁrmly ﬁxed on the road. At 
its highest point, the pass peaks 
at 2,260 m (7,415 ft), marked by 
no more than a few stalls selling 
mineral-ﬁlled rocks that are found 
around here; broken in half, they

kasbah. Abandoned for nearly 
half a century, much of the struc-

This kasbah is on UNESCO’s

is one of the best preserved of 
all the kasbahs in the Atlas

famous, thanks to its popularity 
with visiting ﬁlm producers and 
has been immortalized in dozens 
of movies, including Lawrence of 
Arabia, The Last Temptation of 
Christ, The Mummy, Gladiator 
and Alexander. Part of the appeal 
lies in the location: the kasbah

South to the Desert
Day One 
From Ouarzazate, the 
road continues south 
through the Drâa Valley 
down to the administrative 
town of Zagora. A drive of 
about four hours, stop 
over at Tamnougalt, a 
dramatic ksar (fortiﬁed 
village) 10 minutes off the 
main road, 5 km (3 miles) 
after the small market 
town of Agdz. Further 
south is the Glaoui-era 
Kasbah Timiderte. Zagora  
itself is dominated by Jbel 
Zagora, a rocky outcrop at 
the town’s end. The lively 
market held on Wednesday 
and Sunday teems with 
dates, grown in abundance 
here. Just south of the 
centre is the pretty hamlet 
of Amezrou. Nearby, the 
Kasbah des Juifs is 
inhabited by Berber silver-
smiths (the Jews who 
lived here are long gone). 
Zagora’s most famous 
attraction is at the town’s 
exit: a sign with a camel 
caravan that simply reads, 
“Timbuktu, 52 Days”.
Day Two
The village of M’Hamid is 
96 km (60 miles) further 
south of Zagora. En route, 
Tamegroute’s mosque-
and-shrine complex is off 
limits to non-Muslims, 
except for the library with 
its collection of ancient 
manuscripts. Five 
kilometres (3 miles) 
further on, you will see 
the ﬁrst of the sand dunes 
at Tinfou. The best dunes, 
however, can be accessed 
from M’Hamid, a sleepy 
outpost at the road’s end – 
a one-street settlement, it 
feels like it’s at the end of 
the world. Desert trips, 
from excursions of a few 
hours, to expeditions 
lasting few days, can be 
arranged from here.  
Pharaonic props at Atlas Studios
Ouarzazate has become the 
centre of the Moroccan ﬁlm 
industry and is also home to the  
Atlas Corporation Studios, 6 km 
(4 miles) north of town. They 
were built speciﬁcally to provide 
some infrastructure, including 
sound stages and sets, for 
movies. They can be toured 
when no ﬁlm shoots are in 
progress. It’s well worth 
dropping in to see sets like the 
Tibetan monastery built for 
Kundun and Egyptian temple 
sets from French production, 
Asterix and Cleopatra. A yellow 
bus shuttles between the studio 
and Ouarzazate’s main street,

Most riads and hotels can recommend a car and driver for  
private hire. 
! Airlines
Marrakech is most 
easily accessible by air. 
Royal Air Maroc (royal 
airmaroc.com), Atlas 
Blue, a Royal Air Maroc 
franchise (atlas-blue.com), 
EasyJet (easyjet.com) 
and Ryanair (ryanair.com) 
all run regular services. 
@ Air fares
Since budget airlines 
began services to the 
city, it has become 
remarkably cheap to 
travel there. Fares from 
London Gatwick, London 
Stansted and Luton  
airports start from as  
low as £1 one way plus 
taxes. It’s possible to get 
a return fare for under 
£100 if you book ahead.
£ Marrakech 
International 
Airport
The formerly modest 
airport has been 
siginiﬁcantly expanded in 
order to accommodate 
the vast number of 
ﬂights to the city. 
Located just 4 km (2 
miles) from the centre  
of town, the drive takes 
no more than six or 
seven minutes.
$ Airport taxis
Taxis gather in the 
car park outside the 
Arrivals terminal. Even  
though all taxis are 
metered, they are never 
actually switched on for 
the airport run. A ride 
which would otherwise 
cost 30 Dh, can cost  
over 100 Dh. 
% By train
The modern train 
station receives daily 
services from Rabat, 
Casablanca and Tangier.  
If you have time and 
money to spare, you can 
take the Eurostar from 
London to Paris, and then 
the daily TGV service to 
Algeciras in Spain. From 
Algeciras it’s a ferry ride 
to Tangier. There are no 
public lavatories in 
Marrakech and the 
station has the only free 
facilities.
^ By bus
The national bus 
company, CTM, running 
locally and out of town, 
is the best. Supratours 
runs buses between 
Marrakech, Essaouira and 
many other destinations.
& Grands taxis
These shared taxis 
gather on Marché du 
Mellah and at the gare 
routière. They connect 
Marrakech with 
Casablanca, Fès and 
Essaouira. All the fares 
are ﬁxed; just turn up and 
take a free seat. Altern-
atively, hire a normal taxi 
and get it to take you 
wherever you want. 
* By car
There are frequent 
ferry services operating 
between France, Spain 
and north Morocco. 
A motorway connects 
Tangier with Marrakech 
and currently a 
continuation of this 
motorway to Agadir is 
under construction and 
should be open in 2010.

! Passports & visas
Citizens of the EU, 
Switzerland, the United 
States, Canada, Australia 
and New Zealand need a 
valid passport to visit 
Morocco, but no visa. To 
be able to stay for three 
months, your passport 
should be valid for at 
least six months after 
your date of arrival. If 
your time exceeds the 
three months, then you 
must get an extension 
from the central police 
station (see p108).
@ Insurance
All visitors should 
take out an insurance 
policy before travelling to 
Marrakech. There are no 
reciprocal health agree-
ments between Morocco 
and the EU countries, 
and if you fall ill you will 
have to pay the doctor’s 
bills. Theft is rare, but it 
cannot be ruled out.
£ When to go
Marrakech is warm all 
year round, although 
January and February see 
rainfall, with the 
temperatures dropping 
during the nights. The 
summer heat is at its 
most oppressive and 
ﬁerce in July and August. 
The best times to visit 
are March to June and 
September to December. 
The peak tourist season 
is Easter and Christmas/
New Year, so be sure to 
make reservations well 
ahead in order to secure 
a room if you plan to visit 
during these periods.
$ What to take
Take good, solid 
footwear as the alleys of 
the medina are often 
uneven. Clothes should 
be light but not revealing. 
Take something warm for 
winter evenings. Carry 
any necessary medication 
as your own particular 
brands may not be 
available. Everything else 
is easily obtainable in 
Marrakech at the 
hypermarket Marjane, 
located on the Route de 
Casablanca just north of 
the New City.
% How long to stay
Marrakech is not 
exactly a large city and 
as such, possesses 
proportionately few 
crowd-pulling sights  
and monuments. Most 
visitors pass their time 
sunning themselves on 
rooftop terraces with 
frequent forays into the 
souks. Unless daytrips 
south to the mountains 
or to the coastal region 
of Essaouira are on your 
agenda, three or four 
days is long enough. 
^ Electricity
The electric current is 
220V/50Hz. Moroccan 
sockets take European-
style two-pin plugs, so 
bring an adaptor.
& Islamic holidays
The main Islamic 
holidays follow the lunar 
calendar. They are Eid El 
Fitr (8 Sep in 2010, 31 
Aug in 2011) and Eid El 
Adha (16 Nov in 2010, 6 
Nov 2011). During this 
time, the city stays shut 
for two days, so travelling 
is very difﬁcult. In the 
holy month of Ramadan 
(begins 10 Aug in 2010,  
1 Aug 2011) many 
Muslims fast during the 
day; due to this, most 
restaurants and eateries 
are closed until sundown.
* Tourist office
The Ofﬁce National 
Marocain du Tourisme 
(OMNT) is a bit incon-
venient to reach, located 
as it is in Place Abdel 
Moumen Ben Ali in the 
New City, a taxi ride 
away from the medina. 
Moreover, the staff is not 
particularly well-informed, 
so don’t visit unless 
necessary. You will ﬁnd 
that the staff at your 
hotel or riad will be of 
more help.
( Disabled visitors
Wheelchair users will 
ﬁnd Marrakech a tricky 
place to navigate, espe-
cially in the medina 
where the crowded roads 
tend to be narrow and in  
poor condition. Beyond 
the large hotels and the 
railway station, very few 
buildings are disabled-
friendly, though the 
better riads will do their 
best to accommodate.
) Language
French and Arabic are 
the main languages and 
the signboards are also 
bilingual. English is spo-
ken by those in the 
tourism industry.

Getting Around
Supratours: 0524 43 55 25 for national destinations; 0524 43 64 73 
for international destinations. 
! Walking
Walking is usually  
the best way of getting 
around Marrakech, since 
vehicles are not allowed 
in the narrows alleys of 
the medina. Expect to 
get lost frequently, but 
someone will always help 
you out.
@ Calèches
These horse-drawn 
cabs are located on Place 
Foucault between Jemaa 
El Fna and the Koutoubia, 
and by the Bahia Palace 
and Majorelle Gardens. 
There are posted fees for  
typical rides or you can 
negotiate an hourly rate 
(90 Dh is reasonable).
£ Taxis
Beige municipal 
petits taxis should be 
metered, but you may have 
to prompt the driver to 
turn it on. Most trips cost 
around 10 Dh and slightly 
more at night with the 50 
per cent surcharge. The 
cabs carry a maximum of 
3 passengers at a time. 
 
$ Sightseeing  
Bus Tours
Starting at the tourist 
ofﬁce in Place Abdel 
Moumen Ben Ali, this 
double-decker, open-
topped bus follows two 
circular routes, taking in 
the Koutoubia, Place des 
Ferblantiers (for the Badii 
and Bahia palaces), the 
Menara and Majorelle 
Gardens and Palmeraie. 
Services are every 30 
minutes from 9am to 
5pm. The tickets cost  
130 Dh (65 Dh for children) 
and are valid for 24 hours.
% Bicycles and 
scooters
Bicycles, scooters and 
mopeds can be hired at 
various places, including 
Bazaar Salah Eddine (off 
Rue de Bab Agnaou) and 
along Rue Bani Marine. 
Hire scooters at Marra-
kech Motos in Guéliz.
^ To Essaouira
A Supratours bus is 
the easiest way to get to 
Essaouira from the city. 
They leave ﬁve times a 
day, starting at 8:15am 
departing from beside 
the old train station on 
Avenue Hassan II in 
Guéliz. The ticket costs 
60 Dh. It’s wise to book 
a seat in advance. Or opt 
for the cheaper, though 
slightly shabby CTM bus 
from the gare routière. 
There is also a plane 
service between 
Marrakech and Essaouira. 
& Rules of the road
The Moroccan high-
way code is similar to 
that of France, so give 
way on the right (note 
that whoever is on a 
town roundabout has 
priority). Speed limits are 
40 or 60 kmh (25 or 37 
mph) in city areas, 100 
kmh (60 mph) on open 
roads and 120 kmh (74 
mph) on motorways. The 
road signs are in Arabic 
and French. As you head 
south over the Atlas, a 4-
wheel-drive is a must for 
travelling on dirt tracks.
* Heading over  
the Atlas
Seats on the buses 
heading south over the 
Tizi-n-Tichka and Tizi-n-
Test are cheap, but you 
don’t get to stop en 
route. It is better to hire 
a car or a grand taxi.
( Car rental
Car hire is quite 
expensive with local 
agencies charging around 
400 Dh a day. If you need 
a car only for the drive 
over the Atlas, a grand 
taxi may be cheaper.
) Grands taxis
Grands taxis are the 
best way to cross the 
Atlas – you get to dictate 
where to stop. Expect to 
pay from 700 Dh for the 
whole car on a one-way 
trip to Ouarzazate.

To call Morocco from abroad, dial 00 212 + number; Marrakech area 
code is 0524; always dial 10 digits when ringing within the city.
! Business and 
shopping hours 
Although a Muslim 
country, much of 
Morocco follows a 
Monday to Friday 
working week. Business 
hours for banks are 
8:15am–3:45pm Monday 
to Friday (9:30am–2pm 
during Ramadan). Shops 
start their day a bit later 
but stay open until 8pm 
or 9pm. On Fridays, the 
shops in the souks stay 
shut at lunchtime.
@ Currency
The Moroccan unit of 
currency is the dirham 
(Dh), divided into 100 
centimes; centimes are 
of little value but beggars 
are grateful for them. The 
most useful coins are the 
denominations of 1 Dh, 5 
Dh and 10 Dh. These are 
really handy when travell-
ing by taxis. Notes are in 
denominations of 20, 50, 
100 and 200 dirhams. 
Always try to have a stock 
of 10 Dh coins for taxis.
£ Banks and ATMs
Banks are clustered 
on Rue de Bab Agnaou in 
the medina and Place 
Abdel Moumen Ben Ali in 
the New City. Most of 
the banks have automatic 
cash dispensers (ATMs), 
most of which give cash 
if your card is part of the 
Cirrus, Maestro or Visa 
networks. Cash is issued 
in dirhams only.
$ Credit cards
Credit cards are 
accepted by most high-
end hotels. However, this 
may not be the case for 
all restaurants in the city. 
Some places may decline 
your card in the hope 
that you will pay cash. 
Insist that you have no 
other means of payment 
and your card may just 
be accepted.
% Mobile phones 
National operator 
Maroc-Télécom and rival 
Meditél both have 
arrangements with 
European networks that 
allow visitors to use 
mobiles in Morocco. 
Calls will, of course, be 
expensive. If you are 
visiting for a long period, 
buy a pre-paid SIM card 
from either of the oper-
ators, with shops just off 
Place du 16 Novembre in 
the New City.
^ International 
phone booths
For overseas calls, use 
one of the téléboutiques 
(phone ofﬁces) dotting 
the medina, identiﬁed by 
large blue-and-white 
signs with a telephone 
handset. The phones take 
5 Dh and 10 Dh coins; 
get change from the 
person manning the 
desk. You can use the 
street cardphones with 
phonecards from post 
ofﬁces or tabacs. The 
international access code 
from Morocco is 00.
& Internet access
There are internet 
centres off Jemaa El Fna, 
but the best one is a 
spacious, well-equipped 
centre in Cyber Espace, 
Arset Moulay Abdesslem 
(5 Dh per hour).  
* Post offices
The main post ofﬁce 
on Place du 16 Novembre 
in Guéliz opens from 
8am–4:15pm Monday–
Friday and from 8:30am– 
noon on Saturday. There 
is also a post ofﬁce on 
the south side of Jemaa 
El Fna with the same 
opening times and 
outside public phones. 
For all international 
express parcel post, the 
Amana Bureau Guéliz is 
open from 8am–6:15pm  
Monday–Saturday and 
there is Chronoposte on 
Avenue Hassan II. 
Stamps are also available 
at the local tobacconists.
( Poste restante
The main post ofﬁce 
in Marrakech offers a free 
poste restante service. 
All mail should bear the 
ﬁrst name and surname 
of the recipient, as well 
as the post ofﬁce add-
ress. You will need some 
form of identiﬁcation 
when collecting mail.
) Shipping and 
couriers
Many shops offer a 
shipping service for 
overseas customers, 
however, it is advisable 
to take care of the 
arrangements yourself. 
The parcel ofﬁce is 
located next door to the 
main post ofﬁce on the 
Place du 16 Novembre.

Useful Information

Etiquette
! Hospitality
For Moroccans, 
hospitality is more than 
just tradition; it’s a matter 
of honour. Particularly if 
you travel out of 
Marrakech, people you 
meet may well invite you 
to their homes to drink 
tea or have a meal; a 
refusal could be seen as 
offensive. Never offer to 
pay for your meal. Carry 
a small gift along, like 
chocolates or cakes.
@ Islam
Islam is a state 
religion and the king of 
Morocco is the leader of 
the faithful. It is therefore 
considered to be in bad 
taste to criticise religion. 
Dress properly (see 
below) and refrain from 
overt signs of affection. 
During the fast of 
Ramadan (see p103) do 
not eat, drink or smoke 
in public during the day.
£ Dress
Although Moroccan 
women do wear Western 
clothes, play it safe and 
dress conservatively. 
Headscarves are not 
necessary but neither 
women nor men should 
wear shorts. Women 
should also avoid mini 
skirts, baring their midriff 
or leaving their shoulders 
bare. Revealing bikini 
tops should be restricted 
to the hotel pool.
$ Female travellers
Marrakech is safe for 
solo female travellers, 
although you should 
expect to attract more 
than your fair share of 
attention wherever you 
go. However, avoid 
travelling down south on 
your own. People are 
more conservative south 
of the Atlas; a woman on 
her own will draw a lot of 
unwelcome curiosity. 
% Photographing 
people
You can take photographs 
almost anywhere in 
Morocco but avoid ofﬁcial 
buildings and anything 
that looks like it might be 
police or military. Before 
turning your camera on 
anyone, always ask for 
permission, since the 
more traditional 
Moroccans have an 
ingrained suspicion of 
any type of image. You 
may be asked for money 
by those you photograph, 
especially in tourist spots 
and in particular around 
Jemaa El Fna.
^ Smoking
The stigma of 
nicotine hasn’t yet 
ﬁltered through to 
Morocco, and everybody 
smokes everywhere, all 
the time. Get used to 
eating in smoke-ﬁlled 
restaurants and travelling 
on smoke-ﬁlled buses 
and in smoke-ﬁlled taxis.
& The monarchy
Since the accession 
of Mohammed VI, 
attitudes towards the 
monarchy have relaxed. 
You may even hear 
Moroccans criticizing the 
king. Even so, the sub-
ject of the monarchy is 
still largely taboo. It is 
never a good idea to 
show any disrespect to 
the king’s image, which 
hangs in shops and in all 
public places.
* Tipping
You are expected to 
tip in restaurants and 
cafés, but not too great 
an amount. As a rule of 
thumb, leave about 10 
per cent unless a service 
charge is included. You 
are also expected to tip 
porters (about 20 Dh is 
the usual amount) and 
the staff at your riad – 
leave 100 Dh on top of 
the bill. 
( Begging
You may notice that 
Moroccans give freely to 
the beggars hanging 
around the streets, 
anything from 10 cents to 
1 Dh. One of the “Five 
Pillars of Islam” is charity, 
which is just as well as 
there is no social security 
system to support those 
unable to work.
) Visiting mosques
Unlike most other 
Arab countries, non-
Muslims cannot visit 
mosques or shrines. 
There are even one or 
two streets (well marked) 
in the medina that non- 
Muslims are not allowed 
to enter because they 
lead to holy places. 
Curiously, this rule was 
instituted by the French 
during their colonial rule.

! Dehydration
Bottled water is 
easily available so be 
sure to drink lots of it. If 
you don’t take in enough 
liquids, you are liable to 
end up feeling quite faint 
or possibly worse.
@ Souk guides
In spite of the strict 
clamp down ordered by 
the king himself, you may 
still have guides approach-
ing you to offer their 
services. Always decline. 
With the help of this 
book, there’s nothing you 
can’t ﬁnd yourself. Any 
discount a guide may 
obtain for you at shops 
will be negated by his 
own commission, which 
the shopkeeper will 
factor into the price he 
charges you.
£ Getting drunk
Alcohol is frowned 
upon by Islam. Which is 
to say that Moroccans 
drink discreetly and out 
of the gaze of the 
general public. Alcohol is 
forbidden within the 
medina, given the holy 
status conferred on it 
courtesy of its seven 
shrines. However, hotels 
and restaurants with a 
predominantly foreign 
clientele are allowed 
some ﬂexibility.
$ Drugs
The country is one of 
the major producers of 
cannabis (known locally 
as kif), so drugs are 
freely available. Ignore all 
whispered offers of hash 
around Jemaa El Fna – 
secret police are present 
all around and buying or 
selling drugs, including 
hash, is illegal. A ﬁne or, 
worst case, a prison 
sentence awaits anyone 
caught red-handed.
% Hitchhikers
Hitchhikers dot the 
road between Marrakech 
and Ouarzazate. Should 
you stop, your new pass-
enger will invariably 
attempt to either sell 
whatever is in his bag or 
cajole you into detouring 
off route to a “special” 
place, that ends up at 
some friend’s or family 
member’s restaurant or 
shop. It is best not to 
pick anyone up.
^ Overstretching 
the plumbing
Even in the best of 
hotels, Moroccan 
plumbing is temper-
amental. Locals use 
water rather than toilet 
paper. As a consequence, 
the pipes may get 
blocked very quickly if 
you do use toilet paper. 
So use it sparingly – 
older, cheaper hotels 
even recommend that 
you dispose of it in the 
bin provided instead of 
ﬂushing away the paper. 
& Public displays of 
affection
Displays of public 
affection, even walking 
with arms around each 
other, are taboo. You will 
not suffer any extreme 
form of punishment if 
caught, but this kind of 
behaviour is sure to 
cause offence.
* Being openly gay
Marrakech has, since 
the 1970s, been popular 
with the gay crowd. The 
city has even been  
marketed as a gay 
destination with several 
riads advertising them-
selves as gay-friendly. 
However, homosexuality 
is forbidden in Morocco 
and carries a prison sen-
tence. Foreigners are 
rarely troubled by the 
police, but be discreet.
( Driving Conditions
If you choose to 
negotiate the hairpin 
turns of the passes 
through the Atlas 
Mountains, drive with 
great concentration. It is 
worth it though for the 
spectacular scenery that 
unfolds around you. 
There are several 
stopping places along the 
way. You should avoid 
driving at night as many 
roads and crossroads are 
poorly lit.
) Don’t believe all 
you are told
Marrakech inspires the 
invention of myths. Jimi 
Hendrix did not write 
“Castles Made of Sand” 
after a trip to Essaouira. 
Sting did not hire out the 
Amanjena to celebrate 
his 50th birthday. 
However, almost 
everything else you  
may hear is possibly  
true. Or possibly not.

Security and Health
The US Embassy, 0537 63 33 33, and UK Embassy, 0537 76 22 65, 
are both in Rabat. The US Consulate, 0522 26 45 50, is in Casablanca.
! Vaccinations and 
other precautions
No vaccinations are 
required for visitors 
entering Morocco, except 
for those coming from a 
country where yellow 
fever exists. However, 
vaccinations against 
hepatitis A and B and 
typhoid are advised. Be 
sure to pack a small ﬁrst-
aid kit. To prevent 
sunstroke wear a hat, 
use a sunblock with a 
high UV-protection factor 
and drink lots of water.
@ Personal safety
Violence is rare, 
though instances of bag 
snatching and other such 
opportunistic crimes have 
been on the rise with the 
inﬂux of rich foreigners. 
Be particularly careful 
when walking through a 
quiet medina late in the 
evening. Pickpockets are 
also common in the 
souks and on Jemaa El 
Fna, so be vigilant.
£ Drinking water 
and food safety
Drink bottled mineral 
water and avoid salads 
and fruit juice. Don’t add 
ice to your drinks. 
Approach street food with 
caution, though the food 
at the stalls on Jemaa El 
Fna is usually safe.
$ Emergencies
In the case of an 
emergency don’t wait for 
an ambulance: ﬂag a taxi 
and go to the Polyclinique 
du Sud in the New City, 
a private hospital with 
the best treatment. At all 
costs, avoid the under-
funded public hospitals. 
% Pharmacies
Pharmacies are 
denoted by a green 
crescent sign and have 
well-informed staff, who 
often speak English. 
British proprietary drugs 
may not be available.
^ Doctors and 
dentists
If the pharmacist cannot 
help, there are several 
good doctors and dent-
ists with well-equipped 
surgeries. All speak 
French, but a handful also 
converse in English. Your 
hotel or riad should have 
contact details. Other-
wise, there is always the 
Polyclinique du Sud.
& Animal dangers
Morocco doesn’t 
have particularly harmful 
insects, but scorpions 
and snakes are common 
in the countryside. If you 
are somewhere in the 
Atlas Mountains, always 
check your clothing 
before getting dressed. 
Carry some repellent to 
combat the abundant 
mosquitoes in desert 
oasis areas. 
* Serious illness
Being careful about 
what you eat should 
prevent any serious 
illness, but in case of 
persistent diarrhoea, 
consult a doctor without 
delay. Stray dogs may 
carry rabies and if you 
are bitten, seek medical 
attention immediately.
( Police
In case of problems, 
try the tourist police ﬁrst 
(Brigade Touristique; 0524 
38 46 01) at Sidi Mimoun, 
to the north of Jemaa El 
Fna (not to be confused 
with the Judicial Police to 
the east of Jemaa El 
Fna). The main police 
station is on Rue Oued El 
Makhazine near Jnane El 
Harti in the New City.
) Your consulate
Only the French have 
a consulate in Marrakech. 
The main UK and US 
diplomatic ofﬁces are in 
the Moroccan capital, 
Rabat. In the case of an 
extreme emergency, 
there is a Marrakech-
based UK honorary 
consul in the New City.

The pharmacies are generally open by 8:30am and stay  
shut for lunch. 
! Bargaining
Haggling is de rigueur 
in the souks. If you don’t 
haggle, you may pay 
massively over the odds. 
It all revolves around the 
considerable difference 
between the price 
offered by the seller and 
the price that he will 
actually accept if pushed. 
Shop around and get a 
few different quotes on 
identical items before the 
game begins in earnest.
@ The offer of tea
You will invariably  
be offered tea as part of 
the bargaining process. 
Accepting places you 
under no obligation to 
buy. It does, however, 
allow the seller more 
time to draw your atten-
tion to other potential 
sales. If you aren’t that 
interested in what he has 
to offer in the ﬁrst place, 
then deﬁnitely decline 
the tea.
£ Avoiding the  
hard sell
The sales pitches of the 
souk traders are nothing 
if not amusing. But if you 
are not interested then 
just walk on, don’t res-
pond and don’t catch 
anybody’s eye. No seller 
is going to waste time on 
somebody who is not 
going to purchase goods.
$ How will it look at 
home?
A souk is a seductive 
place with items that 
may tempt you into a 
purchase. But stop to 
consider before you buy: 
how well will a brass 
platter the size of a 
tractor wheel ﬁt with 
your furniture at home? 
And would you actually 
dare to wear the canary  
yellow slippers and take 
a stroll down a high 
street at home? 
% For something 
different
If you want a break from 
the monotony of the 
always busy souks and 
wish to purchase some-
thing more unique but 
distinctly Moroccan, visit 
some of the shops that 
line the medina, such as 
Atelier Moro, Kif Kif and 
Kulchi (see p70), or 
Scènes du Lin (see p78) 
up in the New City. All 
these places are run by 
young designers with a 
very unique take on local 
crafts and traditions.
^ Types of 
Restaurants
There are two types of 
restaurant in Marrakech: 
those that offer Moroccan 
food and those that offer 
international food. The 
Moroccan restaurants 
either feature an à la 
carte or set menu. The 
set menu meal is some-
thing you do once and 
never repeat again (see 
below). Your next even-
ing’s meal could probably 
be Moroccan à la carte, 
and if you’re around a 
third night, you may want 
to dine at one of the 
restaurants serving excel-
lent international cuisine.
& The set meal
In the cheaper 
restaurants a set meal 
consists of a starter 
(soup or salad), followed 
by a main dish and 
ﬁnishing with a dessert 
(usually something like a 
crème caramel or fruit). 
At the more expensive 
restaurants such a meal 
involves more courses 
than could ever be eaten.
* Opening hours 
and reservations
Many restaurants open 
only for dinner, typically 
from around 7:30pm until 
10:30 or 11pm. You may 
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to scout a 
place for lunch away 
from Jemaa El Fna or the 
New City. Reservations 
are advisable for popular 
restaurants (see pp52–3).
( Alcoholic drinks
Most restaurants 
frequented by Western 
tourists have a license to 
serve alcohol. The 
Moroccan rosé wines are 
perhaps the best of the 
lot. In Ramadan (see 
p103) some restaurants 
that normally serve 
alcohol stop selling it.
) Prices
It is possible to eat 
well for not very much. 
However, many of the 
more popular and 
fashionable restaurants  
in Marrakech charge 
European prices. The 
prices given on menus 
usually include all taxes, 
but check if the service  
is included.

Accommodation Tips
! Choosing a hotel
Marrakech has an 
abundance of stylish 
accommodation, many of 
which are either riads 
(see below) or maisons 
d’hôtes, a term that 
roughly translates to 
mean “boutique hotels”. 
Some of these places are 
so stunning, you may 
ﬁnd it hard to drag your-
self into the throng of 
the medina. However, for 
those who ﬁnd comfort 
in standard international 
hotels, there are plenty 
of those too.
@ Riads
A riad is a house in 
the medina with a court-
yard. Uniquely Moroccan, 
they can range from a 
cosy four rooms to close 
to 20, from humble to 
ultra-stylish. Nearly all 
are privately-owned 
guesthouses and the 
levels of service and 
luxury tend to reﬂect the 
personalities – and 
ﬁnancial resources – of 
their owners. It is possible 
to rent a whole riad at a 
reduced rate. Many riads 
offer transport to and 
from the airport.
£ Location, location, 
location
All the riads are in the 
medina. The closer you 
are to Jemaa El Fna, the 
central whirlpool of 
Marrakech, the better. 
The big international 
hotels are in Hivernage, 
between the medina and 
the airport – a taxi ride 
away from all the action. 
Anyone seeking to get 
away from it all might 
consider retreating to a 
luxury hideaway in the 
Palmeraie palm grove, to 
the north of the medina.
$ Classifications
The Moroccan 
government has devised 
an ofﬁcial classiﬁcation 
for hotels, with a one- to  
ﬁve-star grading system. 
This system, however, is 
not applied to riads. 
Listed hotels are often 
ambitiously graded and  
it is not recommended 
that you venture below 
three stars.
% Prices
By law, prices for 
accommodation must be 
shown in the reception 
area as well as in rooms. 
Be aware, however, that 
these prices rarely 
include tax and they do 
not include breakfast. 
Again, riads and maisons 
d’hôtes are exempted 
from this rule.
^ Negotiating a 
lower price
Negotiating a lower price 
for a hotel room is 
common – and fruitful. At 
slack times, it is possible 
to obtain reductions of 
up to 30 per cent. It is a 
waste of time, however,  
during high season or 
with most riads.
& High and low 
season
High season is Christmas 
and New Year and the 
weeks around Easter. At 
such times, prices of 
rooms can go up by as 
much as 25 per cent and 
that’s if you can ﬁnd one 
– you really need to have 
something booked 
months in advance. 
September and October 
are generally also busy 
as the worst of the 
summer heat is over. 
January and February are 
low seasons.
* Disabled access
Most accommodation 
in the medina is not 
wheelchair accessible,  
as Moroccan houses are 
built with lots of steps. 
The international hotels 
in Hivernage are the best 
bets, as many of them  
are disabled-friendly.
( Travelling with 
kids
Riads are not great 
places to holiday with 
kids. Being essentially 
small, former family 
homes with a central 
courtyard, noise carries 
to all rooms. Unless your 
children are remarkably 
quiet, you are liable to 
disturb other guests.
) Meals
All riads and maisons 
d’hôtes offer breakfast. 
Few have restaurants but 
all have kitchens, where 
lunch and dinner can be 
prepared to order and 
usually eaten in the 
courtyard or on the roof 
terraces. The food from 
riad kitchens is as good, 
if not superior, to most of 
the local restaurants.

Phrase Book

Moroccan Arabic is unique to Morocco and is not 
understood by other Arabic speakers. Moroccans speak 
faster and abbreviate words. Pronunciation is gentler 
due to the inﬂuence of French.
