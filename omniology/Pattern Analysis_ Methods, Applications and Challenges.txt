PREFACE 
 
 
This book reviews methods, applications and challenges of pattern 
analysis. Chapter One addresses the identification problem of the printed 
medieval documents origin. The authors of Chapter Two perform a review on 
current cheiloscopic techniques, addressing the study methodology and 
usefulness of lip print patterns study. Chapter Three examines theoretical 
bases of human identification using palatal rugae pattern, and addresses the 
study methodology and techniques, potentialities and future usefulness of 
palatal rugae patterns. Chapter Four focuses on variable-scale-based pattern 
analysis for time series of wind speed, atmospheric pressure, and atmospheric 
temperature. 
Chapter One - In this chapter, the authors address the identification 
problem of the printed medieval documents origin. To solve this task, the 
authors use a text mapping into equivalent script type codes. These codes form 
an equivalent image. Because the texture is one of the image characteristics, 
further analysis is performed using its texture. Feature vectors are derived 
from texture representation. Then, an artificial neural network is adopted for 
classification of the feature vectors representing fragments of documents in 
different historical periods. Experiment performed on a database of medieval 
fragments shows that fragments of documents in a given historical period can 
be clearly identified by using the efficient proposed framework, reaching very 
competitive results in terms of performance measures.  
Chapter Two - Cheiloscopy is the name given to the study of lip prints. 
Nowadays, it is recognized that lip prints may be useful in identifying living 
individuals, as in certain circumstances they may be the only way to correlate 
an individual to a particular place or person. However, the use of lip prints in 
human identification is still controversial, and some authors suggest that there

is insufficient evidence to conclude that the lip prints are unique for each 
individual, and therefore its forensic value doubtful. Recent studies on the 
detection of DNA, from epithelial cells present in lip prints, have opened new 
perspectives on this field of study. The existence of a link between a specific 
lip pattern and some diseases, and the individual origin and sex is also being 
researched. In this chapter the authors perform a review on current 
cheiloscopic techniques, addressing the study methodology and usefulness of 
lip print patterns study. 
Chapter Three - Palatoscopy is the name given to the science that studies 
palatal furrows morphology. Palatal rugae are thought to be unique of an 
individual and evidence suggests that they can be used in human identification. 
Additionally, some studies have tried to relate the palatal rugae pattern with 
population affinity and sex of the individual, and results are equally promising 
and an increase use of this methodology is expected in the near future. Palatal 
rugae pattern, taking into account the anatomical location of the palatine 
wrinkles,is not expected to be used in linking evidence in a crime scene to a 
particular person. Instead, its usefulness lies in the identification of dead 
bodies, either by the relative stability of the palatal zone, even in situations in 
which facial recognition is not possible, or by the probable existence of ante 
mortem records. In this chapter the authors will addressed the theoretical bases 
of human identification using palatal rugae pattern, and will discourse about 
the study methodology and techniques, potentialities and future usefulness of 
palatal rugae patterns study. 
Chapter Four - The methods introduced in this paper are designed for the 
analysis of strongly irregular environmental patterns, including streaming 
environmental data. Two different approaches to variable scale are addressed 
in this context. The first one focuses on the size of the “grains” handled in the 
data, varying data resolution; it considers time series elements to represent 
successive states of a dynamic system, in order to identify and characterize 
patterns and pattern change in the dynamic system’s behaviour. The second 
approach starts from an existing analysis method (Haar wavelets), which 
includes the scanning of a wide range of time scales. It builds on this method 
by adding an algorithm designed to be capable of grasping time- and time-
scale-dependent pattern features, as well as making comprehensive scale-by-
scale comparisons of patterns based on their scaling properties. The presented 
methods have a broad applicability area and are illustrated with time series 
corresponding to atmospheric variables: wind speed, atmospheric pressure, 
and atmospheric temperature time series. They can be successfully applied to 
studies on climate variability and implications of climate change.

ABSTRACT  
 
In this paper, we address the identification problem of the printed 
medieval documents origin. To solve this task, we use a text mapping 
into equivalent script type codes. These codes form an equivalent image. 
Because the texture is one of the image characteristics, further analysis is 
performed using its texture. Feature vectors are derived from texture 
representation. Then, an artificial neural network is adopted for 
classification of the feature vectors representing fragments of documents 
in different historical periods. Experiment performed on a database of 
medieval fragments shows that fragments of documents in a given 
historical period can be clearly identified by using the efficient proposed 
framework, reaching very competitive results in terms of performance 
measures.

INTRODUCTION 
 
According to Liu [1], the Sumerians began to register written information 
around 6,000 years ago, using clay tablets to describe commercial transactions. 
Since that time, the written documents have been used as a proof of 
civilization. Slavs, which populated the Central and Southern Europe in the 
early 6th century, were illiterate and pagans. In order to baptize them, it was 
necessary to make them literate and to translate church holy books into the 
language that could be understandable to them. Consequently, Greek apostles 
Cyril and Methodius under supervision of the Byzantine appointed to translate 
the church holy books from Greek to the Old Slavonic. According to that, their 
job included the creation of the alphabet adjusted to the Old Slavonic 
language. As a result of their work, the first Slavic alphabet was created. It 
was called Glagolitic script. Today, this type of Glagolitic script is called 
round Glagolitic one. It was complicated to be written. However, earliest 
saved documents in the round Glagolitic script dated from the 10th century in 
the wide region of Bulgaria in the southeast through the Moravians (Czech 
Republic) in the west of the Europe. Soon after, it was replaced with a more 
modern script created by Methodius’ students, which is called Cyrillic script. 
However, a specific version of the old Slavonic alphabet was spread and used 
in Croatia. The Croatian extension of the Glagolitic alphabet was called 
squared or angular Glagolitic. It was transformed from the round Glagolitic 
alphabet, making it easier to write. Also, it was better accustomed to the 
carving into the parts of the stone church or stone monuments. In that period 
many of the church holy books were translated into the Slavonic language by 
writing in the angular Glagolitic script. It was a crucial event, because prior to 
that time the church books were allowed to be written in the Latin or Greek 
language only. Hence, the ancient medieval document represents one of the 
most valuable sources of the cultural heritage.  
The end of the 15th century as well as the beginning of the 16th century 
represents a period of introduction and widespreading of printing process 
machines. After that period in Europe, the printed handwritten documents 
were almost vanished except handwriting ones. Essentially, all documents 
were machine printed. This period was identified as a very important period in 
spreading of printed Glagolitic documents in some parts of Croatia. During the 
introduction of printing process, the orthography of the Glagolitic printed 
documents was slightly changed. Essentially, in the hand printed Glagolitic 
documents all first letters in sentence were capitals. In the native Glagolitic 
orthography the capital letters were written as descendent letters and not

ascender letters like in Latin alphabets. This rule of writing was present until 
the period when the documents were printed by machine and not by hands. At 
the beginning of the printing process introduction at the end of the 15th 
century, small printing factories were operated in the region of the Croatian 
coast, like Senj and Rijeka. In these printing factories the “old” orthography 
was used. Lately, in the beginning of the 16th century many of these small 
printing factories closed. Accordingly, the books were usually printed in the 
region of Italy, i.e., in Venice and Rome. If the editor of the printed book had 
Croatian origins, then the used orthography was the old one. In the coming 
decades of the 16th century, due to the influence of the Latin alphabet, the old 
Glagolitic orthography was changed. It was made according to the rules of the 
Latin alphabet. Hence, the rule of thumb for all new sentences was to begin 
with a capital letter, which was in these circumstances an ascender letter. It is 
supposed that this period begins around the middle of the 16th century.  
In this way, the medieval documents are clearly mixed, but they can be 
discriminated according to different use of the ortography. Essentially, the 
discrimination of documents by their orthography can clearly identify 
documents’ dating and printing origin. Hence, we are proposing a system for 
recognition of the historical period of the medieval documents (Glagolitic 
documents) based on script differences identification, as well as the location of 
its printing.  
Script recognition and discrimination techniques that have been developed 
can be grouped in two different analysis directions. These directions are 
classified as global and local ones.  
Global methods take into consideration wider blocks in document images. 
Then, they are subjected to the statistical and/or frequency domain analysis 
[2]. In order to extend the method efficacy, document image blocks should be 
normalized. However, the prerequisites to establish a good script recognition 
are to have document images free of noise and given in high quality [3]. On 
the contrary, local methods separate document images into small pieces, which 
represent connected components. They contain text divided into characters, 
words or text lines. Furthermore, the analysis of different features, like the 
black pixel runs, is performed [4]. In contrast to global methods, the local 
methods are suitable for processing low-quality and noisy document images. 
A new approach for the script recognition, which combines both 
techniques is proposed in [5], [6]. This approach unites local and global 
methods. First of all, it treats the characters in the text part of document 
images. Essentially, it maps each character into the corresponding script type 
according to its position in the text line. Secondly, the script type distribution

of coded text is analyzed. Then, the text is subjected to a different type of 
textural analysis in order to extract the texture features needed for 
classification [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14]. At the end, an 
appropriate classification technique is used for the script discrimination and 
identification [6], [10], [15]. 
In this paper, we introduce a technique to deliberately distinguish 
documents which were hand or machine printed before and after the middle of 
the XVI century based on their ortographic rules (old or new orthography). We 
employ the technique previously used for script discrimination [5], [6]. Still, 
this method hasn’t been used in any dating of the medieval documents yet. 
Furthermore, to the very best of our knowledge, we are the first to attempt to 
solve this kind of problem in the literature. Because the Glagolitic documents 
used a different orthography, our technique can be effectively used in solving 
the aforementioned problem. The method consists of three crucial stages. In 
the first stage, the text of the document is mapped according to the text line 
position of each letter. Then, in the second stage, the texture analysis of the 
obtained coded text is performed. At the end, the obtained results are classified 
according to ad-hoc artificial neural network (ANN), for identification of old 
or new orthography.  
The paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 describes the 
proposed algorithm. Section 3 presents the feature extraction method and 
provides an example. Section 4 introduces the classification method based on 
artificial neural networks. Section 5 gives the experimental results and 
discusses them. Section 6 draws the conclusions.  
 
 
THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM 
 
The proposed algorithm consists of three main stages. They are: 
 
(i) mapping of the initial text,  
(ii) texture analysis, and  
(iii) classification for ortography identification. 
 
 
Figure 1. The main steps of the proposed method.

Figure 1 shows the main steps of the procedure. 
The principle of the method is based on the identification of linear patterns 
inside the document. These patterns correspond to sequences of consecutive 
codes, in which the document characters have been previously classified, 
based on their position in the text line. The position and frequency of the linear 
patterns are able to capture the ortography characteristics of the document. 
Hence, documents given in different ortography types will have a well-distinct 
disposition of these patterns, while documents given in the same ortography 
type will exhibit small differences in their patterns. Position and frequency of 
the patterns are captured by texture analysis of the coded document, 
corresponding to a 1-D gray scale image, for which every code is a gray level. 
In this way, extracted textural features present meaningful differences for 
different script types, useful to the artificial neural network classification 
method for the ortography recognition.  
 
 
FEATURE EXTRACTION 
 
 
Mapping of the Text 
 
The first stage of the algorithm represents the mapping according to script 
types and the creation of an equivalent image pattern. Each text line can be 
split into three vertical zones [16], [17], [18]: 
 
(i) upper,  
(ii) middle, and  
(iii) lower.  
 
The letters in a certain script have different positions in the text line, based 
on their energy profile [16]. In this way, the letters are divided into: 
 
(i) the base,  
(ii) the ascender,  
 
(iii) the descendent, and 
(iv) the full letters.  
 

Darko Brodić, Alessia Amelio and Zoran N. Milivojević

Base letters (B), like the letter a, occupy a middle zone only. Ascender 
letters (A), like the letter h, spread over the middle and upper zones. 
Descendent letters (D), like the letter g, include the middle and lower zones. 
Few letters like the capital letter lj (in Serbian or Croatian Latin alphabet) 
comprise all three zones. They are classified as a full letter (F). This stage is 
illustrated in the Figure 2.  
Then, they are mapped into the coded text. The mapping is performed as 
follows [19]: 
  
(i) the base letter in 0,  
(ii) the ascender letter in 1,  
(iii) the descendent letter in 2, and  
(iv) the full letter in 3.  
 
Hence, any text sample is transformed into the flow of the following 
numerical codes: 0, 1, 2, and 3. This stage is illustrated in the Figure 3.  
According to this coding, a text sample is considered as a 1-D gray scale 
image, where each numerical code is a gray level. Then, texture analysis is 
performed on the obtained 1-D image for feature extraction.

Texture Analysis 
 
Texture is a measure of the intensity variation in the image surface [20]. 
Hence, the texture can be used to calculate statistical measures of the image as

well as to extract suitable information for further processing. Run-length 
statistical analysis is used to evaluate and quantify the coarseness of a texture 
[21]. Let’s suppose that we have an image I featuring X rows, Y columns and L 
levels of gray intensity. First, the run-length matrix p(i, j) is extracted. It is 
defined by specifying a direction and then counting the occurrence of runs for 
each gray level and length in that direction. Its number of rows corresponds to 
L, i.e., the maximum number of gray levels, while the number of columns 
corresponds to N, i.e., to the maximum run length. Run-length matrix P is 
given as:

In our case, each element of the run-length matrix p(i, j) represents the 
gray level run-length of image I (1-D matrix) that gives the total number of 
occurrences of gray-level runs of length j and of the gray-level intensity value 
i [20]. Accordingly, a set of consecutive pixels with identical intensity values 
constitutes a gray level run.  
Using the aforementioned matrix and vectors, the following run-length 
features were originally proposed in [21]: 
 
(i) Short run emphasis (SRE),  
(ii) Long run emphasis (LRE),  
(iii) Gray-level nonuniformity (GLN),  
(iv) Run length nonuniformity (RLN), and  
(v) Run percentage (RP).  
 
SRE measures the distribution of short runs. LRE quantifies the 
distribution of long runs. GLN measures the similarity of gray level values 
throughout the image. RLN quantifies the similarity of the length of runs 
throughout the image. RP measures the homogeneity and the distribution of 
runs of an image in a specific direction. nr represents the total number of runs, 
while np is the number of pixels in the image I.

The extraction of texture features from the run-length matrix is extended 
by the following two measures [22]: 
 
(i) Low gray-level runs emphasis (LGRE), and  
(ii) High gray-level runs emphasis (HGRE).  
 
LGRE takes into account the distribution of low gray level values, while 
HGRE measures the distribution of high gray level values.

Additional four feature extraction functions gained by idea of joint

(i) Short run low gray-level emphasis (SRLGE),  
(ii) Short run high gray-level emphasis (SRHGE),  
(iii) Long run Low gray-level emphasis (LRLGE), and  
(iv) Long run high gray-level emphasis (LRHGE).  
 
SRLGE measures the joint distribution of short runs and low gray level 
values, while SRHGE takes into account the joint distribution of short runs 
and high gray level values. LRLGE measures the joint distribution of long 
runs and low gray level values, while LRHGE takes into account the joint 
distribution of long runs and high gray level values. 
All eleven aforementioned measures are defined in Table 1.  
The obtained eleven texture measures determine a feature vector 
representing the document in a given script. 
 
 
Orthography 
 
In the native Glagolitic orthography, the capital letters were written as 
descendent letters in the old document up to the half of the 16th century. 
However, under the influence of the Latin script after that period the capital 
letters in the Glagolitic documents were written as ascender letters. Hence, a 
clear distinction between documents written before and after that period can be 
made. Figures 4-5 illustrate the difference between old and new orthography in 
the Glagolitic documents.

Examples 
 
In order to analyze the difference between old and new orthography, the 
text samples from Figures 4-5 are coded. The coded samples from the Figures 
4-5 are given in Figures 6-7.  
Also, the number of newly mapped codes is counted as well as the 
percentage in the text. The distribution of the script types in the coded text 
samples from Figures 6-7 is given in Tables 2-3, respectively.

If we compare the percentage of each of the script codes we can easily 
notice that the percentage of the code 2 is reduced from 10.87 to 1.47, which is 
around 7 times. According to that figure, we are going to apply our method to 
classify and distinct the Glagolitic document that used old and new 
orthography rules.  
 
 
CLASSIFICATION 
 
In order to identify a new document as given in old or new orthography, 
we create an ad-hoc artificial neural network, in particular a two-layer 
feedforward neural network, to employ on the proposed document feature 
vectors [24], [25]. In fact, neural networks extensively demonstrated their 
reliability in document retrieval and classification [26], [27], [28], in natural 
language processing and language classification from documents [29], and 
their superiority in these contexts with respect to other well-know classifiers 
[28], [30]. Next, we recall the main concepts underlying the adopted neural 
network.  
It is composed of a layer of n input neurons, a hidden layer of m neurons 
and, because classification is binary (old or new orthography), of a layer of 
one output neuron o, interconnected to each other. In this network, the outputs 
at a given layer are forwarded to the neurons of the next layer. Also, each 
neuron at a given layer is fully connected to all the neurons of the next layer. 
The number m of neurons of the hidden layer is a critical aspect of the 
network, because a reduced number will produce a network with low learning 
ability. On the contrary, a too high number will determine a network with low 
generalization capacity. A weight is associated to each connection of the 
network, together with the weights determining the thresholding values for the 
neurons.  
Because each document is represented by a feature vector of 11 elements, 
the network is composed of 11 neurons in the input layer, from which input 
data come from. Input neurons are represented as xi, i = 1...n, where n is equal 
to 11 in our case. Also, an additional neuron x0, whose value is always equal to 

Darko Brodić, Alessia Amelio and Zoran N. Milivojević 
12
1, is provided as the bias to the hidden neurons. They are represented as hj, j = 
1...m. A connection between an input neuron xi and an hidden neuron hj is 
given as wji. Also, the input neuron x0 is connected to all the neurons in the 
hidden layer, with connection weights wj0, j = 1...m. The weight on the 
connection between a hidden neuron hj and the output neuron o is represented 
as yj. Also in this case, the bias hidden neuron h0, determining a value which is 
always 1, is connected to the neuron o, with connection weight y0. The output 
of the neurons in the hidden and output layers is the result of a thresholding 
sigmoid function on the weighted sum of their inputs.  
Given a hidden neuron hj, the weighted sum of its inputs is: 
 
 
1
n
ji i
i
w x

. 
(2) 
 
The employed thresholding function is the sigmoid function, determining 
an output between 0 and 1. Sigmoid function applied on the hidden neuron hj 
is computed to obtain the output of the neuron:

The calculation of the weights for o in the output layer is similarly given

given as:

Figure 8 shows the two-layer feedforward neural network model. Initially 
all the weights of the network assume small random values, which are 
modified from the training step by using the backpropagation algorithm [24]. 
Its aim is to “adjust” the network in order to obtain the correct output 
classification, given the document feature vector as input. A training set of 
document feature vectors in the two classes (old and new orthography) is 
presented multiple times as input of the network, document by document. 
Backpropagation algorithm repeatedly changes the network weights to obtain 
an output which is closer to the real class of the input documents. At the end, 
the network is ready to correctly classify “unseen” test document feature 
vectors as given in old or new orthography.

The backpropagation algorithm updates the network weights in order to 
minimize the squared error between the output of the network and the class of 
the input document.  
Specifically, the input document is propagated through the network to 
generate the output. Then, classification error is measured between the output 
and the class of the input document. Again, the weight updates are computed 
back to the network, for yj, j = 1, ...,m, and then for wji, i = 1, ...,n, j = 1, ...,m. 
Finally, all the weights of the network are modified from the computed 
updates.  
The updates of the weights yj between hidden and output layers are 
computed as:

where η is the learning rate, rt and ut indicate respectively the class and the

are the outputs of the corresponding hidden and input neurons produced from 
xt.

As a termination criterion, validation set is adopted. In particular, the 
weights of the network are updated multiple times on the training set, and 
sometimes, during this process, the error of the network is evaluated on the 
validation set. The algorithm is terminated when the error computed on this set 
of document feature vectors starts growing, to avoid network overfitting. At 
the end, the performances of the obtained classifier are evaluated on the 
document feature vectors composing the test set.

EXPERIMENT 
 
The experimental part includes the application of the proposed method on 
a database of eleven different excerpts from different medieval documents, 
extracted from liturgical books, breviary, missals in Glagolitic script. Eight out 
of eleven documents are written according to the old orthographic rules, while 
the other three documents are written according to the new orthographic rules. 
Obviously, last eight documents dated from the period before the middle of the 
16th century, while the first three documents dated later. Figure 9 shows an 
example of Glagolitic document from different periods, i.e., which was written 
according to different orthographic rules.  
 
 
Results and Discussion 
 
Experimentation has been performed in Matlab R2015a on a notebook 
quad core at 2.2 GHz, 16 GB RAM and UNIX operating system. A pre-
processing phase has been employed for normalizing the document feature 
values of the database in a range between 0 and 1. In particular, normalization 
for the t-th document feature vector xt is obtained by normalizing each value xit 
of feature i using the following min-max method:  
 
 



where mini is the minimum value of the feature i and maxi is the maximum 
value of the feature i.  
Classification in old or new orthography has been performed on the 
aforementioned database by adopting also the Naive Bayes method [31] and 
the Support Vector Machine approach (SVM) [32]. Although the two methods 
obtain satisfactory results in classification task, demonstrating the efficacy of 
the proposed feature representation, the neural network showed its superiority 
with respect to the other classifiers in this context. Consequently, the two-layer 
feedforward neural network is adopted for classification of documents as given 
in old or new orthography.

Figure 9. Glagolitic document written by: (a) the old ortographic rule, and (b) the new 
ortographic rule. 
Cross validation method is employed for assessing the proposed approach. 
Specifically, the database D is randomly divided into training, validation and 
test set at a given percentage, by using 3 different combinations: 
 
1. 50% of data for training, 25% for validation and 25% for test (named 
as D(50, 25, 25)),  
2. 60% of data for training, 20% for validation and 20% for test (named 
as D(60, 20, 20)), and  
3. 70% of data for training, 15% for validation and 15% for test (named 
as D(70, 15, 15)).  
 
For each combination, the number of documents in the two classes is 
proportionally distributed for the training, validation and test sets. Then, to 
avoid dependence of the result on the selected training and validation sets, 
experiment is repeated 100 times for each percentage combination of training, 
validation and test.

Average precision, recall, and f-measure [33], together with the standard 
deviation, are computed for each percentage combination and each document 
class (old and new orthography) to evaluate the obtained results.  
In order to determine the most suitable number of neurons in the hidden 
layer, which is a critical aspect of the network, a specific test is conducted. In 
particular, the network is equipped with a number of hidden neurons varying 
from 2 to the double of the input neurons [34], that is 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20. 
Each network with a certain number of hidden neurons is employed on the 
database randomly divided into training, validation and test sets, based on the 
3 different percentage combinations, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) is 
computed on the corresponding test sets. 
MSE is the average squared difference between the outputs of the network 
and the class of the documents for the test set, and represents how much far are 
the outputs of the network from the true outputs. MSE computed on the test set 
is defined as follows:  
 
 
MSE(x,r) 1
T
(rt ut)2
t1
T

. 
(11) 
 
where x represents the test set of size T, rt is the class of the document t in the 
test set, and ut is the output of the network for the document t in the test set. 
Then, for each number of hidden neurons, the average MSE, together with the 
standard deviation, are computed across the 3 different percentage 
combinations. The best number of hidden neurons is that corresponding to the 
minimum average MSE.

Table 4 shows the result of this test. In particular, for each number of 
hidden neurons, the average MSE and corresponding standard deviation are 
reported. It is clear that 5 neurons in the hidden layer determine the minimum 
average MSE with a low standard deviation. Consequently, the two-layer 
feedforward neural network model is realized by including 5 hidden neurons.  
Table 5 shows the classification results obtained from the two-layer 
feedforward neural network on the test sets of documents with old and new 
orthography, for each percentage combination of training, validation and test 
sets.  
It is worth to observe that identification of documents in old or new 
orthography is highly reliable and accurate, also when the percentage of 
documents included in the training set is lowered to 50. In fact, in this case, 
average precision and f-measure reach a very high value of 0.99, while 
average recall is equal to 1.00. In the other two cases of percentage of 
documents in the training set equal to 60 and 70, documents in old or new 
orthography are perfectly identified, with an average precision, recall and f-
measure of 1.00. Also, standard deviation is very low for percentage 
combination of 50, 25, 25, and 0 for the other two percentage combinations, 
demonstrating the stability of the obtained results.  
In conclusion, performed experiments confirm the strong efficacy of the 
proposed method to successfully identify the historical period of the 
documents based on their different orthography.

CONCLUSION 
 
In this study we proved that using various orthography rules, present in 
different historical periods, can be employed to differentiate and identify the 
origin of the medieval hand-printed or printed documents. The above task is 
solved by using specific character’s mapping according to the typographical 
features of the document. In this way, OCR process is not mandatory and true 
recognition of each character in the text of document is not needed. The 
document mapping texture of the image is subjected to the feature extraction, 
by which 11 run-length characteristics were extracted. Furthermore, the 
classification is performed by an ad-hoc artificial neural network. The 
proposed algorithm was used on a database of medieval documents written in 
hand-printed and printed angular Glagolitic scripts. The obtained results are 
very accurate, promising the application of the method on other kinds of 
medieval documents.

ABSTRACT 
 
Cheiloscopy is the name given to the study of lip prints. Nowadays, 
it is recognized that lip prints may be useful in identifying living 
individuals, as in certain circumstances they may be the only way to 
correlate an individual to a particular place or person. However, the use 
of lip prints in human identification is still controversial, and some 
authors suggest that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that the lip 
prints are unique for each individual, and therefore its forensic value

doubtful. Recent studies on the detection of DNA, from epithelial cells 
present in lip prints, have opened new perspectives on this field of study. 
The existence of a link between a specific lip pattern and some diseases, 
and the individual origin and sex is also being researched. In this chapter 
the authors perform a review on current cheiloscopic techniques, 
addressing the study methodology and usefulness of lip print patterns 
study. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Cheiloscopy, from the Greek words cheilos (lips) and skopein (to see) 
(Molano, Gil, Jaramillo and Ruiz, 2002) is the name given to the study of lip 
prints (Sivapathasundharam, Prakash and Sivakumar, 2001). The first 
reference to a lip prints study dates from 1902 (Caldas, Magalhaes and 
Afonso, 2007; Sivapathasundharam et al., 2001), however, it wasn’t until 1930 
that studies focusing on human identification were developed (Thomas and 
van Wyk, 1988). In 1932, Edmond Locard, the French famous criminologist, 
recognized the usefulness of lip print patterns in forensic investigations 
(Thomas and van Wyk, 1988), and later on, in 1950, Le Moyer Snyder 
referred to the use of lip print patterns in human identification (Snyder, 1950). 
Cheiloscopy is important in human identification because lip print patterns 
seem to be unique to an individual, except, perhaps, in monozygotic twins 
(Neville, Damm, Allen and Bouquot, 2002; Pueyo, Garrido and Sánchez, 
1994; Sivapathasundharam et al., 2001; Tsuchihashi, 1974). Ragab and 
collegues stated that the specificity of Egyptian lip prints was verified in their 
study, as no two subjects showed absolutely similar lip print patterns; in fact, 
every person had a unique mixture of lip grooves. Moreover, pattern 
differences were observed even in twins and family relatives (Ragab, El-
Dakroory and Rahman, 2013). These results agree with those from other 
authors, namely those obtained by El Domiaty and collegues who also 
reported that throughout the whole study, performed on 966 Saudi subjects, no 
identically similar lip print patterns were found (El Domiaty, Al-gaidi, Elayat, 
Safwat and Galal, 2010). Similar reports of lip print patterns singularity were 
made concerning Indian populations (Jeergal, Pandit, Desai, Surekha and 
Jeergal, 2016). 
Furthermore, like fingerprints, lip print patterns rarely display any 
alterations to their original features, resisting many afflictions, such as herpetic 
lesions. In fact, only those pathologies that inflict permanent damage to the lip 
tissue, such as burns, seem to be able to alter the cheiloscopic pattern (Molano 

Cheiloscopy and Human Identification: A Review 
39
et al., 2002). Suzuki and Tsuchihashi also reported lip prints singularity, and 
observed lip response to trauma, stating that after healing, the lip pattern was 
restored to its original features (Suzuki and Tsuchihashi, 1971; Tsuchihashi, 
1974). 
Another important aspect of lip print patterns is its prompt formation: lip 
grooves can be identified in human beings as early as the sixth week of in 
uterine life (Sadler, 2012), meaning that they can be used for forensic purposes 
since birth. 
 
 
2. ANATOMICAL ASPECTS 
 
Lips are mobile folds, with skin, muscle, glands and mucous membrane. 
They surround the mouth and form the anterior boundary of the oral cavity. 
Anatomically, the surface that forms the oral sphincter is called the lip area. 
The upper lip outspreads from under the nose, extending laterally toward the 
cheek to the nasolabial sulcus; the lower lip is bounded inferiorly by the 
labiomental sulcus. Both lips join at the corners of the mouth – the 
commissures – and are separated by the buccal fend (Warwick and Williams, 
1979).

Lips are covered by skin and mucosa, which meet at the labial cord, a 
white wavy line. The space between the upper and lower labial cord is known 
as the Klein area, and it is covered with wrinkles and grooves that form the 
distinctive lip print pattern (Pueyo et al., 1994; Sivapathasundharam et al., 
2001).  
It should be noticed that besides lip print patterns, other lip features have 
been used in forensic human identification. Commissures placement, for 
instance, is of the utmost importance in facial recognition, making the lip 
shape look horizontal, elevated or depressed (Figure 1) (Molano et al., 2002; 
Pueyo et al., 1994). Lips have also been classified according their width, and it 
has been refereed that thin lips are common in European, medium lips show no 
ancestry preference, as they are very common, thick lips (with an inversion of 
the labial cord) are common in Africans, and mixed lips are usually seen in 
Asians (Chiu and Clark, 1992; Molano et al., 2002; Pueyo et al., 1994). 
 
 
3. LIP PRINT PATTERNS CLASSIFICATIONS 
 
A forensic identification process is considered useful when it meets five 
key parameters, which will influence its degree of scientific reliability. These 
five key parameters are (França, 2011; Pereira, 2012; Pinheiro, 2008): 
 
 
Uniqueness or singularity: the condition of being impossible to find 
two individuals who share the same set of personal characteristics, 
i.e., each subject has only certain elements that individualize him. 
Nowadays, this concept has been challenged, and some authors claim 
that singularity is not only impossible to prove, but also not a 
fundamental request. If a feature has known prevalence and 
discriminative capacity it meets the request (Page, Taylor and 
Blenkin, 2011);  
 
Immutability: defined as the inviolability of individualizing 
characteristics throughout the individual’s life; 
 
Permanence: principle which states that certain organic elements do 
not vary from those that arise during intrauterine life, remaining 
unchanged until advanced stages of putrefaction; 
 
Feasibility: the ease with which the process can be applied in the 
forensic routine; 

Cheiloscopy and Human Identification: A Review 
41
 
Classification methodology: it regards methodology storage and file 
sorting, so that the records are easily located whenever required. 
 
The first three criteria have already been explored previously, in the 
introduction chapter, whereas the feasibility principle will be discussed further 
ahead. For now, we will address the classification methodology of lip print 
patterns, describing several classification practices used in this context. 
 
 
3.1. Martín Dos Santos Classification 
 
Lip grooves are divided into two groups: (1) simple, when formed by only 
one element and (2) compound, when composed by several elements. Simple 
elements can be a straight line (R-1), a curve (C-2), an angular form (A-3) or 
sinusoidal (S-4); conversely, compound grooves can be bifurcated (B-5), 
trifurcated (T-6) or anomalous (An-7) (Figure 2) (Santos, 1967). 
 
 
Figure 2. Martín dos Santos classification. 
There are no references to the use of this classification, other than the one 
made by its author in his paper. This is due, perhaps to the lack of instructions 
to build a cheiloscopic formula that allows for lip print patterns classification. 
 
 
3.2. Suzuki and Tsuchihashi Classification 
 
These authors contemplated six different types of furrows (Suzuki and 
Tsuchihashi, 1971), as seen in Table 1 and in Figure 3.

Figure 3. Suzuki and Tsuchihashi classification  
Lip print patterns should be divided into four quadrants by a horizontal 
axis passing through both labial commissures dividing the upper and lower lip, 
and another axis perpendicular to the first one, coinciding with the median 
sagittal plane dividing the lips in right and left halves; each sulcus is classified, 
by writing its type in the area adjacent to the lip print itself. 
Like the previously described classification, this methodology does not 
recommend the development of any cheiloscopic formula, which may hamper 
the comparative examination and also the registration process. With regard to 
its use, this is probably the most widely used method, being cited by several 
authors (Augustine, Barpande and Tupkari, 2008; Costa and Caldas, 2012; 
Devi et al., 2015; Mohamed, Shenoy and Vijaya, 2009; Ramakrishnan, 
Bahirwani and Valambath, 2015; Randhawa, Narang and Arora, 2011).

3.3. Renaud Classification  
 
This is, without doubt, the most complete classification. The lips are 
studied in separated halves (left and right), and every groove has a number 
(Table 2), according to its form (Figure 4). A cheiloscopic formula is then 
elaborated using capital letters to describe the upper lip left (L) and right (R) 
sides, and small letters to classify each groove; in the lower lip, it is done the 
other way around, using capital letters to classify the grooves, and small letters 
to separate left from right sides. Furrows are classified as complete if they 
intersect the totally of the lip (from the labial cord to the oral sphincter) and 
incomplete, if not (Renaud, 1973). 
Despite its obvious advantages, only a few researchers have used this 
classification (El Domiaty et al., 2010; Ragab et al., 2013).

3.4. Afchar-Bayart Classification  
 
This classification, dated from 1979, is inspired in the Suzuki and 
Tsuchihashi classification, and divides lip furrows in a seven-type 
classification (Afchar-Bayar, 1978), as seen in Table 3 and Figure 5.

Like the Suzuki and Tsuchihashi classification, this methodology does not 
provide a cheiloscopic formula. Furthermore, some of the anatomical types 
described are not easy to interpret, as sketches illustrating each furrow type are 
not provided. Due perhaps to the above reasons, this classification is only 
referred by its author in the paper used to present it (Afchar-Bayar, 1978).

3.5. Domingos, Romero and Capilla Classification 
 
This is another classification based on the one made by Suzuki and 
Tsuchihashi. In the grooves classified as Type II of Suzuki and Tsuchihashi, 
the author and his co-workers observed, with some frequency, a slight 
variation: they observed that branched grooves often divided upwards in the 
upper lip, and downwards in the lower, as reported by Suzuki and Tsuchihashi; 
but they also realized that some grooves, the so called II’ type, branched the 
other way around (Dominguez, Romero and Capilla, 1975). The types of lip 
furrows described in this classification are depicted in Table 4 and Figure 6.

As with the Suzuki and Tsuchihashi classification, this methodology does 
not provide a cheiloscopic formula. Once more, this classification is only 
referred in the paper used to present it.

3.6. Oviedo and Meira classification 
 
This classification, once again inspired in the Suzuki and Tsuchihashi 
classification, adds the analyses of the groove depth to the morphologic 
features (Oviedo and Meira, 1988). This feature can, of course, be difficult to 
assess, particularly when studying photographs. It also does not lead to a 
cheiloscopic formula elaboration, and no references, besides the paper where it 
was presented, can be found in the literature. The types of lip furrows 
described in this classification are depicted in Table 5.

Type A furrows can still be divided in complete or incomplete, being the 
latter subdivided in external and internal. Similarly, type C furrows can also be 
divided in horizontal or vertical grooves, reticular pattern, converging or 
diverging grooves (Figure 7).

4. TYPES OF LIP PRINTS 
 
Searching for prints in a crime scene investigation can be extremely 
important, since lip prints can link a subject to a specific location, and can be 
found in various items, such as clothes, glasses, cups or even cigarettes’ buts 
(Ball, 2002; A.; Castelló, Alvarez, Miguel and Verdú, 2002; Ponce, Segui, 
Muñoz and Verdú Pascal, 2003)  
Lip prints can be divided in three different types. When visible to the 
naked eye, lip prints are called visible or patent (Caldas et al., 2007). Lipsticks 
account for the majority of these prints (Webb, Egan and Turbett, 2001). 
Lipsticks are complex substances, which have in their constitution, several 
compounds, namely oils or waxes (Ponce et al., 2003; Webb et al., 2001). The 
color of the lipsticks is due to organic inks and inorganic pigments (Webb  
et al., 2001). Still, prints left in blood, dirt, paint, grease or any other substance 
that reveals it immediately, are other examples of visible lip prints (Caldas  
et al., 2007). 
Modeled lip prints are visible lip prints that allow for lip furrows 
observation, but also record the lip anatomy. They usually result from the 
contact of the lips with soft surfaces, such as plaster, clay or wax (Caldas  
et al., 2007).  
As stated previously, most lip prints are seen as lipstick smears (Webb  
et al., 2001). However, all lip prints are important, even the ones that are not 
visible (Castelló, Alvaréz-Seguí and Verdú, 2000; Ponce et al., 2003). In fact, 
the forensic cheiloscopic study is not restricted to visible prints, including also 
the latent ones (Ponce et al., 2003). The vermillion border of the lips has minor 
salivary and sebaceous glands, which, together with the moisturizing done by 
the tongue, leads to the possibility of the existence of latent lip prints (Ball, 
2002). Additionally, not all lipstick smears are colored, and the cosmetic 
industry has developed lipsticks which do not leave a visible smear or mark - 
these are called persistent lipsticks (Seguí, Feucht, Ponce and Pascual, 2000).

Observation, using white and ultraviolet light sources, is the first step 
when processing lip prints (Caldas et al., 2007). Photographs should also be 
made, and prior to any processing in order to protect the evidence (U.S. 
Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation Laboratory Division, 

Inês Morais Caldas, Alexandra Teixeira and Daniel Pérez-Mongiovi 
48
2001). Photographing latent prints is a complex process and, according to FBI 
guidelines, latent prints should be photographed individually with an 
identification label and a scale; furthermore, each step in the processing 
sequence must be photographed. (U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau 
of Investigation Laboratory Division, 2001). 
If lipstick is present, the lipstick itself should be analyzed and its 
constitution determined. In fact, although about 65% of lipsticks share the 
same ingredients, differences in the remaining ingredients may provide the 
identification of the lipstick manufacturer (Ehara and Marumo, 1998). 
If lip prints are located on a non-porous surface, they can be photographed 
and enlarged (Ball, 2002), and using transparent overlays, it is possible to 
make an overlay tracing (Ball, 2002; Pueyo et al., 1994). 
In some circumstances, lip prints can be covered with processing agents 
which allow direct observation and photography (Molano et al., 2002; Pueyo 
et al., 1994). These substances are called developers or processing agents.  
Hence, developers are pure substances or mixtures capable, physically or 
chemically, to reveal latent prints (Castelló, Alvaréz and Verdú, 2004; 
Dominguez et al., 1975; Ponce et al., 2003; Schulz and Reichert, 2002; Seguí 
et al., 2000). The choice of developer to use in each situation depends 
essentially on three factors (Katz, 1994): 
 
 
The color of the support in which the lip print is found; 
 
The nature of the support (porous or non-porous); 
 
The age of the lip print, since the lipid and water contents decrease 
over time. 
 
There are two types of developers (Katz, 1994): 
 
 
Chemical substances or physic methods are able to develop a print 
without the occurrence of chemical reaction between the developer 
and the product perspiration. This is a purely physical phenomenon 
where the developer adheres to the perspiration on the latent print. 
They may be chemical developers (such as lead carbonate, ivory 
black, carbon black or aluminum powder) or physic methods (for 
example, oblique visible light and ultraviolet light). 
 
Chemical reagents are simple or compound substances, which react 
with certain constituents of perspiration products in the lip print, thus 
making it visible. Examples include iodine vapor, 5% silver nitrate 
solution, osmium tetroxide, and ninhydrin. 

Cheiloscopy and Human Identification: A Review 
49
As stated, several substances can be used as processing agents, such as 
aluminium powder, silver metallic powder, silver nitrate powder, plumb 
carbonate powder, fat black aniline dyer or cobalt oxide (Ehara and Marumo, 
1998; Seguí et al., 2000). Additionally, and because all lip prints contain 
lipids, their development, is also possible by using lysochrome dyes (such as 
Sudan III, Oil Red O, Sudan Black) (Ponce et al., 2003). When the color of the 
surface where the lip print lies on is multi-colored, or when the print is old, 
fluorescent developers can be useful (Castelló et al., 2002; Castelló et al., 
2000; Ponce et al., 2003). 
Plumb carbonate, a white powder, can be used using a brush, over smooth, 
polished, metallic or plastic surfaces. Its only limitation is its use over white 
surfaces (Ponce et al., 2003). In such circumstances, marphil black powder or 
fat black aniline dye are better choices since they both have a dark color 
(Ponce et al., 2003). Silver nitrate can lead to positive results on difficult 
surfaces, such as untreated wood or cardboard (Trozzi, Schwartz and Hollars, 
2001). 
Other examples of chemical reagents used on porous surfaces are DFO 
(1,8-Diazafluoren-9-one) (Trozzi et al., 2001). On plastic or waxed surfaces, 
on vinyl gloves or photographs, cyanoacrylate dye is the developer of choice 
(Trozzi et al., 2001).  
Finally, another option for the development of latent lip prints is the use of 
aluminum powder or magnetic powder, due to a marked affinity for lipstick 
pigments (Seguí et al., 2000). 
After processing a lip print, subsequently detailed observation with white 
light and/or alternative sources of light (such as ultraviolet light), the pattern 
should be photographed, always with a metric reference scale (Castelló et al., 
2002; A.; Castelló et al., 2004; Castelló et al., 2000; Dominguez et al., 1975; 
Ponce et al., 2003; Seguí et al., 2000; Singh, Brave and Khanna 2010). 
 
 
6. DNA AND LIP PRINT PATTERNS  
 
The sensitivity of modern molecular biology techniques has had great 
impact on forensic analysis. In fact, because only a few cells are needed to 
obtain a DNA profile, usually a wide range of biological evidence for 
collection is available in crime scenes. The most common samples are blood, 
semen, hair (with root) and saliva (Goodwin, Linacre and Hadi, 2011). Yet, 
nowadays it is possible to extract and study DNA of invisible or latent prints 
(Castelló et al., 2004). 

Inês Morais Caldas, Alexandra Teixeira and Daniel Pérez-Mongiovi 
50
When an object is touched, epithelial cells may deposit. The amount of 
biological material recovered depends on (Goodwin et al., 2011):  
 
a) The contact duration of the skin with the target object;  
b) The amount of pressure exerted;  
c) The presence of fluid that can mediate the transfer.  
 
Since it is possible to obtain a DNA profile from fingerprints, it is 
conceivable that the lip prints can also be used as a source of genetic material. 
The theoretical limitations include the number of cells recovered and the 
material used for developing lip prints, as it can interfere with the extraction, 
amplification and DNA detection (Balogh et al., 2003; Schulz and Reichert, 
2002). Yet, some studies indicate that it is possible to obtain DNA from 
lipsticks (Webb et al., 2001) and labial latent prints, stained with Sudan Black 
(Castelló et al., 2004). 
Still, due to the limited number of studies, there is currently no reliable 
information or consensus on the best protocol to be used for DNA extraction 
and profiling from lip prints, which may explain why this procedure is not 
routinely used in forensic investigations. Thus, it is of crucial importance to 
conduct follow-up studies to determine the best conditions to obtain DNA 
profiles effectively, and to determine which developers should be used in these 
cases. 
 
 
7. OTHER USES OF CHEILOSCOPY 
 
Apart from the possibility to relate lip prints patterns with an individual, 
some authors have suggested that lip prints can also be related with ancestry 
(Costa and Caldas, 2012; Devi et al., 2015; El Domiaty et al., 2010; George et 
al., 2016; Koneru et al., 2013; Prasad and Vanishree, 2011) and sex (Bansal, 
Sheikh, Bansal and Pallagati, 2013; Kaul, Padmashree, Shilpa, Sultana and 
Bhat, 2015; Sharma, Ingle, Kaur and Yadav, 2014). If possible, this would be 
extremely interesting since it would allow the use of lip prints patterns without 
requiring previously established data. 
In terms of ancestry, some populations have shown a tendency to exhibit 
morphologically similar types of lip prints: for example, Prabhu and 
colleagues stated that the Suzuki and Tsuchihashy type V was the most 
common in the population they studied (Goa, India) (Prabhu, Dinkar and 
Prabhu, 2012). This was also the most predominant lip print type found in a 

Cheiloscopy and Human Identification: A Review 
51
Nigerian population (Adamu et al., 2015). Conversely, in a Portuguese 
population, Suzuki and Tsuchihashy type II was the most prevalent type of lip 
print (Costa and Caldas, 2012). Using Renaud’s classification, Ragab and 
colleagues reported that the most predominant type of lip furrow on an 
Egyptian population was type I (Ragab et al., 2013). Yet, in an Egyptian 
population the most common lip furrows were type J (El Domiaty et al., 2010). 
The existence of an inheritance pattern of lip prints has also been reported. 
According to Schnuth, cited by Adamu et al. (Adamu et al., 2015), hereditary 
plays an important role in lip prints development, and similarities between 
parents and their children are expected. Ghalaut et al. reported a 83.3% of 
strong lip print resemblance between parents and their offspring (Ghalaut, 
Bhagwath and Saxena, 2013). These data agree with those reported by 
Augustine and co-workers (Augustine et al., 2008). Yet, the results of another 
investigation revealed a lesser lip print pattern similitude (58.6%) between 
parents and their offspring, pointing out the need of more studies concerning 
lip print pattern inheritability (George et al., 2016).  
With regard to sex estimation, several authors have reported statistically 
significant differences between sexes regarding the morphology of lip prints 
(Costa and Caldas, 2012; Prasad and Vanishree, 2011). El Domiarty and 
colleagues reported that the Renaud’s horizontal lip furrow type was only 
found in Egyptian females (El Domiaty et al., 2010). Sex differences on lip 
print morphology were also reported by other authors (Krishnan, Thangavelu, 
Rathnavelu and Narasimhan, 2016). Jeerger and colleagues also referred that 
males and females displayed statistically significant differences in lip print 
patterns in particular lip sites: lower medial lip, as well as upper and lower 
lateral segments. On the upper medial lip segment, no statistically significant 
differences were found in lip print pattern between males and females (Jeergal 
et al., 2016). This suggests that the distribution of lip prints according to lip 
segment should be considered in sex estimation. 
However, there are also conflicting results: Prabhu and colleagues, for 
example, reported no differences in the lip print pattern according to sex 
(Prabhu et al., 2012). Similarly, Ragab and colleagues also stated that sex 
could not be determined from patterns of lip prints in their study (Ragab et al., 
2013). 
Some investigators have tried to find out if certain patterns of lip prints 
can be related with individuals, or with their parents, in cases of congenital 
anomalies. Saad and colleagues referred that a specific lip print type, named 
type 0, an area devoid of grooves, was significantly higher in parents of cleft 
lip and palate patients (Saad, Kamel, Hassan and Elotiefy, 2005). Similar 

Inês Morais Caldas, Alexandra Teixeira and Daniel Pérez-Mongiovi 
52
results were found by Saujanya and colleagues, that besides the increased 
frequency of type 0 pattern, also found branched grooves more common in 
parents of children with cleft lip and palate, referring that these could be 
genetic markers for transmission of this deformity (Saujanya et al., 2016). 
Other authors have referred to other lip print types, namely a whorl pattern, 
and an increase number of lip furrows count in the parents of cleft lip and/or 
palate children, supporting the idea of using lip print patterns as genetic 
markers of some conditions (Manasa Ravath, Girish, Murgod, Hegde and 
Savita, 2014). 
 
 
8. LIMITATIONS OF LIP PRINT PATTERNS STUDY IN  
THE FORENSIC FIELD  
 
Lip prints are produced by a movable portion of the lip, which means that 
the same person may produce different lip prints, according to the pressure 
direction and harvesting method used in the lip prints (Caldas et al., 2007).  
Another problem is subjectivity, particularly evident in the manual 
performed overlays. To avoid error, the person that performs the overlays 
should also process and interpret all remaining data (Ball, 2002). 
An essential problem of analysis of the lip prints is the existence of 
conditions that preclude cheiloscopic analyses. Lymphangiomas, congenital 
labial fistulas, Merkelson-Rosenthal syndrome, syphilis, scleroderma, among 
others, are some examples of such conditions (Caldas et al., 2007). 
Postmortem examination of the labial tissues should also be done with 
caution since significant changes in the produced lip prints are expected 
(Utsuno, Kanoh, Tadokoro and Inoue, 2005). 
Finally, pre-established data regarding a cheiloscopic formula only exist 
on very specific circumstances, so it is a technique that aims primarily to relate 
lip prints with the lips that produced them, rather than for necro-identification 
(Caldas et al., 2007). 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
There are several classifications for lip print patterns in the literature; 
Suzuki and Tsuchihashi classification is probably the most widely used, 
however Renaud classification is considered the most complete. Further 

Cheiloscopy and Human Identification: A Review 
53
analysis and discussion in the forensic community is essential in order to 
clarify which classification would be more useful in forensic cases, taking into 
account that many of the resulting prints are incomplete. 
A considerable amount of DNA from epithelial cells can be recovered on 
lip prints, which, depending of the circumstances, could help obtaining a 
genetic profile. Nevertheless, since the presence of lipstick and/or material 
used for developing lip prints can interfere with DNA profiling, more studies 
are still necessary to design a guideline to help the forensic specialist 
implement the best procedure in each case. 
The possibility to relate lip prints to ancestry or sex is promising, taking in 
account the studies recently published in the literature. Finally, concerning the 
existence of an inherited pattern of lip prints, more studies with larger 
populations are needed in order to evaluate the availability of this forensic tool 
to relate a suspect with the family lineage.

ABSTRACT 
 
Palatoscopy is the name given to the science that studies palatal 
furrows morphology. Palatal rugae are thought to be unique of an 
individual and evidence suggests that they can be used in human 
identification. Additionally, some studies have tried to relate the palatal 
rugae pattern with population affinity and sex of the individual, and 
results are equally promising and an increase use of this methodology is 
expected in the near future. Palatal rugae pattern, taking into account the 
anatomical location of the palatine wrinkles,is not expected to be used in 
linking evidence in a crime scene to a particular person. Instead, its 
usefulness lies in the identification of dead bodies, either by the relative 
stability of the palatal zone, even in situations in which facial recognition 
is not possible, or by the probable existence of ante mortem records. In 
this chapter the authors will addressed the theoretical bases of human 
identification using palatal rugae pattern, and will discourse about the 
study methodology and techniques, potentialities and future usefulness of 
palatal rugae patterns study. 
 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Palatoscopy, or palatal rugoscopy, is the name given to the study of palatal 
rugae in order to establish a person’s identity (Caldas et al., 2007; Gilbert 
Calabuig, 1998).  
Palatoscopy has consolidated its value as a scientific technique that can be 
used with success in comparative methodologies aiming human identification. 
Indeed, many investigators have studied the palatal rugae pattern as a 
phenotypic feature that is unique to each individual (Caldas et al., 2007; Jain 
and Chowdhary, 2014), meaning that as the dental profile, fingerprints and 
DNA, palatal rugae pattern can also be used in personal identification with 
conclusive results. 
Kuppler, in 1897, was, perhaps, the first person to study palatal anatomy 
to relate its features with ancestry (Carrera Carbajo). Palatal rugoscopy for 
identification purposes was first proposed in 1932, by a Spanish investigator 
named Trobo Hermosa (Pueyo et al., 1994).  
The interest of palatal rugae patterns in forensic sciences relates mainly 
with 3 factors: 
 
a. The palatal rugae pattern is permanent. Palatal rugae are formed in the 
3rd month in utero from the connective tissue that covers the maxilla 

Palatoscopy in Human Identification 
67
(Sadler, 1990). From that moment on, they persist throughout the 
individual’s life, and even postmortem, as these tissues seem to take 
much more time to decompose, resisting decomposition changes for 
up to seven days after death (Muthusubramanian et al., 2005). 
b. The palatal rugae pattern is immutable, at least in shape. Studies on 
the thermal effects on the palatal rugae pattern of burn victims with 
panfacial third degree burns have concluded that most victims did not 
sustain any palatal rugae pattern changes, and when changes were 
noted, they were less pronounced than in other tissues generalized 
body state (Muthusubramanian et al., 2005). Furthermore, once 
formed, palatal rugae pattern does not undergo any changes, except in 
length and relative position, due to normal growth (Almeida et al., 
1995) and dental alterations. Not even diseases, chemical aggression 
or trauma seem to be able to change palatal rugae form (Pueyo et al., 
1994). Some authors have reported changes, but mainly in palatal 
rugae size and position, secondary to extreme finger sucking in 
infancy, tooth loss, periodontal surgery, and persistent pressure due to 
orthodontic treatment (Kapali et al., 1997). Finger sucking alterations 
are of little importance, since they are produced early in the child’s 
life, and the pattern will persist from that moment on. As for dental 
extractions and periodontal surgery, they can in fact produce a local 
effect on the direction of the rugae (Bowles, 2005). Some authors 
pointed out that rugae medial points should be preferred when 
assessing the palatal rugae pattern, as they show increased stability 
over the lateral points (Almeida et al., 1995; Bailey et al., 1996; 
Bowles, 2005; Hoggan and Sadowsky, 2001). Others believed that the 
more posterior ruga is less susceptible to changes with tooth 
extraction, being the third palatal rugae pair in particular the most 
stable reference (Abdel-Azizz and Sabet, 2001; Bowels, 2005; Lysell, 
1955). Other studies however, point out that the first ruga is the most 
stable (Bailey et al., 1996). We believe further studies are needed in 
order to define which ruga is the most stable when teeth extractions 
are performed. In patients who underwent orthodontic treatment, the 
first right ruga had significant differences in size before and after the 
treatment in females, but there was no morphological changes in any 
rugae for both sexes (Braga and Caldas, 2016). In agreement, Ali and 
colleagues also stated the shape of rugae can be used as a reliable 
forensic marker in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment, but 
palatal rugae length must be used with caution (Ali et al., 2016).

c. The palatal rugae pattern is exclusive. This concept relates to the 
uniqueness or singularity of the evidence, one of the five parameters a 
forensic identification process should meet to be considered trust-
worthy (França, 2011; Pereira, 2012; Pinheiro, 2008). Basically, it 
states it should be impossible to find two individuals who share the 
same set of personal characteristics, i.e., in this case, the same palatal 
rugae pattern. Even though this concept has been challenged, and 
claims were made that singularity is not only impossible to prove, but 
also not a fundamental request (Page et al., 2011), most authors agree 
the palatal rugae pattern is, in fact, exclusive (Dawasaz and Dinkar, 
2013; De Angelis et al., 2012; English et al., 1988; Gondivkar et al., 
2011; Kotrashetti et al., 2011; Patil et al., 2008; Santos and Caldas, 
2012; Shetty et al., 2015; Suhartono et al., 2016; Thabitha et al., 
2015). 
 
 
2. ANATOMICAL ASPECTS 
 
The oral mucosa surface is mostly flat and smooth without grooves or 
crests, except for (Warwick and Williams, 1979):  
 
a. the back of the tongue, which is covered with papillae and 
b. the anterior portion of the palatal mucosa, having a dense system of 
rugae, firmly attached to the underling bone. 
 
Palatal rugae are irregular, asymmetric ridges of mucous membrane 
extending lateral from the incisive papilla and the anterior part of the median 
palatal raphe (Abdel-Aziz and Sabet, 2001; Kapali et al., 1997; Simmons et 
al., 1987).  
In the palate, there is a thin central groove, bordered, on each side, by a 
crest: the palatal raphae; from this crest, latterly, three to seven smaller crests 
emerge: the palatal rugae (Pueyo et al., 1994; Warwick and Williams, 1979).  
The development and differentiation of rugae seems more advanced in 
other animals, such as rats, than humans and while they are probably involved 
in oral function in some animals, rugae seem to be attenuating in humans 
(Kapali et al., 1997; Thomas and Rossouw, 1991). Their functions appear to be 
related with food transportation through the oral cavity, preventing loss of 
food from the mouth and to participate in the chewing process (Buchtová et 
al., 2003). The modern diet is essentialy soft, and doesn´t have the same 

Palatoscopy in Human Identification 
69
requirements in terms of chewing, which can explain why palatal rugae seem 
to exhibit a lesser development. Their functions associated with taste and 
tactile perception, once fundamental to recognize poisons (Buchtová et al., 
2003), are also less required. 
Generally, there is no bilateral symmetry in the rugae number or in their 
distribution from the midline in humans. It has been found that there are 
slightly more rugae in males and on the left side in both sexes (Simmons et al., 
1987). We will address sex differentiation through palatal rugae pattern, 
further ahead. 
 
 
3. PALATAL RUGAE PATTERNS CLASSIFICATION 
 
Like other patterns (lip prints and fingerprints, for example), there are 
several proposed classifications for palatal rugae patterns. Due to the 
subjective nature of palatal rugae morphology and its pattern interpretation, 
researchers have found the task of classification a very difficult one. 
According to Bhullar and colleagues (Bhullar et al., 2011), the first system of 
classification was developed in 1911 by Goria and was quite rudimentary. 
Palatal rugae pattern was classified by specifying the number of rugae and the 
extent of the rugal zone relative to the teeth. Lysell, in 1955, developed a 
widely used system for palatal rugae classification based on the shape, length, 
direction and unification of palatal rugae (Abdel-Aziz and Sabet, 2001; 
Bowles, 2005; Kapali et al., 1997). This system provides a fairly extensive 
description of the palatal rugae pattern and has inspired several classifications 
systems. In this chapter, we have chosen to describe the most known ones for 
their application or historical reference.  
 
 
3.1. Thomas and Kotze classification 
 
This classification, dating from 1983, divides palatine wrinkles according 
their length, morphology, placement, number and the extent of the rugal zone 
(Bhullar et al., 2011; Caldas et al., 2007; Jibi et al., 2011).  
Regarding length, there are three types of palatal rugae: 
 
 
Type A - 5 to 10 mm long; 
 
Type B - more than 10 mm long and 
 
Secondary - 3 to 5 mm in length. 

Susana Braga, Maria Lurdes Pereira, Benedita Sampaio-Maia et al. 
70
According to their morphology, palatal rugae can be classified as: 
 
 
Fragments (size inferior to 3 mm); 
 
Curved; 
 
Sinuous; 
 
Lines and 
 
Circular. 
 
The number of each rugae morphologic type should also be noted, as well 
as the area occupied by the palatal rugae pattern. This is made using palatal 
photography. 
This classification presents several problems. On one hand, it doesn’t lead 
to the elaboration of a rugogram, i.e., a formula that depicts palatal rugae 
pattern. This poses a problem, since forensic evidence, to be useful, needs to 
be classifiable, so that the comparative examination may be straightforwardly 
carried out and the records easily located and stored (França, 2011; Pereira, 
2012; Pinheiro, 2008). On the other hand, several authors have discouraged the 
use of palatal rugae length as criteria for classification, since length may vary 
due to dental treatments (Abdel-Aziz and Sabet, 2001; Ali et al., 2016; 
Almeida et al., 1995; Bailey et al., 1996; Braga and Caldas, 2016). Yet, despite 
these limitations, some references to this classification can be found in the 
literature (Ali et al., 2016; Kotrashetti et al., 2011; Rajan et al., 2013; Saraf et 
al., 2011; Savita et al., 2016). 
 
 
3.2. Carrea Classification 
 
In this classification, palatal rugae are divided into four different types, as 
seen in Figure 1 and Table 1. Rugae are classified according their direction 
and no rugogram is created (Caldas et al., 2007; Carrea, 1937).

III

IV 
Rugae with several directions 
 
Regarding this classification, like with size, rugae direction may not be a 
stable marker (Kapali et al., 1997). 
 
 
3.3. Martins dos Santos Classification 
 
This classification bases on the form and position of each palatal ruga. As 
shown in the example depicted in Figure 2, the classification respects the 
following rules (Matins-dos-Santos, 1946): 
 
 
The most anterior wrinkle on the right side is represented by a capital 
letter and is termed initial rugae; 
 
All other right side rugae are called complementar rugae and are 
represented by numbers; 
 
The most anterior left side wrinkle is also represented by a capital 
number and is named sub-initial rugae; 
 
All other left side rugae are designated sub-complementar rugae and 
are denoted by numbers.

The numbers and letters attributed to rugae relate to its form and are 
depicted in Table 2. 
Once again, it is not an easy classification to use, since there are no 
instructions to elaborate a rugogram. Additionally, curves and circles are 
classified equally in anterior position rugae. Also, it is not clear how to 
distinguish between points and circles, or between angles and bifurcated rugae.  
 
 
3.3. López de Léon Classification 
 
Dating from 1924, this classification has only historic relevance. The 
author proposed the existence of a link between a person’s personality and 
palatal rugae morphology, as depicted in Table 3 (Caldas et al., 2007; 
Simmons et al., 1987).

The rugogram is built using the predominant type of rugae, on each side, 
written in capital letters, followed by the identification of the palate side, using 
“l” and “r” lower case letters, followed by the number of the most predominant 
morphologic palatal rugae on each side. For instances, a possible rugogram 
would be Br6; Bl8 (Caldas et al., 2007; Pueyo et al., 1994). 
 
 
3.4. da Silva Classification 
 
In this classification, palatal rugae are divided into two groups: simple 
palatal rugae, composed by a single element (see Table 4 and Figure 3) and 
compound, resulting from the union of two or more simple rugae (Caldas et 
al., 2007; Pueyo et al., 1994; Thomas and van Wyk, 1988).

The classification process is made in two distinct stages: 
 
 
The structural classification of the rugae, identifying each of its 
components; for example, if a palatal rugae is a point, a line and an 
angle, the classification will be 1 3 6. 
 
Quantitative numbering, counting in each side of the palate, the 
number of the several morphologic types found; for example, the right 
side has 5 lines, 3 curves and 2 angles, the classification will be 3 5 2; 
on the left side there are 3 lines and 3 curves, the classification will be 
3 3. 
 
This is a methodology difficult to apply since it is not clear how to apply 
the two-steps classification in building the rugogram. 
 
 
3.5. Trobo Classification  
 
This classification considers simple (Table 5 and Figure 4) and compound 
rugae pattern, the last being two or more simple palatal rugae fused. The 
rugogram is made describing each pattern, beginning in the principal rugae 
(the one closest to the incisive papilla), which is classified with a capital letter; 
the following rugae are described using lower case letters, and the palate right 
side is categorized first (Caldas et al., 2007; Pueyo et al., 1994; Trobo y 
Hermosa, 1932).

3.6. Basauri Classification 
 
Like the previous one, this is a very easy to use classification. It 
distinguishes between the principal ruga, the more anterior one (labeled with 
letters), and the accessory rugae, concerning all the remaining rugae (labeled 
with numbers), as seen in Table 6 and Figure 5. The rugogram is elaborated 
beginning from the right side of the palate (Pueyo et al., 1994). 
The rugogram is built, starting on the right side, from the principal to the 
accessory rugae.

3.7. Cormoy System 
 
This system classifies palatal rugae according to their length in: (1) 
principal rugae (over 5 mm); (2) accessory rugae (ranging from 3 to 4 mm); 
(3) fragmental rugae (with less than 3 mm length). The morphologic aspect 
(line, curve, and angle), origin of the medial extremity and direction of each 
rugae are also described. Ramifications are also scored. Additionally, rugae 
with the same origin, interrupted rugae and the incisive papilla are described 
as well. It is a very complete classification system of palatal rugae pattern 
(Pueyo et al., 1994). Yet, the rugogram elaboration process is not explained, 
which makes the managing and processing of data difficult, and is based on 
the palatal rugae length that may not be a stable marker (Kapali et al., 1997). 
 
 
4. PALATAL RUGAE PATTERNS ANALYSES 
 
The first step on palatal rugae patterns analyses is the direct observation of 
the palate. This can be done directly, or using a mirror, but no definitive 
conclusions should be made regarding the rugogram elaboration. In this step, a 
full oral examination of the mouth should be performed. Missing teeth should 
be registered, since, as discussed previously, teeth extractions can alter rugae 
positions. Similarly, evidence of previous orthodontic treatment should be 
recorded, since some authors have described alterations in palatal rugae length 
following this type of treatment (Abdel-Aziz and Sabet, 2001; Ali et al., 2016; 
Almeida et al., 1995; Bailey et al., 1996; Braga and Caldas, 2016). It should be 
noticed that since identification using palatal rugae is, in theory, a necro-

Palatoscopy in Human Identification 
77
identification process, evidence of previous orthodontic treatment can be 
found in clinical records or even in the direct examination of the mouth (for 
instance, bilateral absence of the first or second premolars in a perfectly 
aligned maxillary arch). Maxillary prosthetic devices should also be listed, 
since they can also raise some doubts in the palatoscopic assessment, leading 
to an exclusion of identity. In fact, occasionally, palatal rugae are added to 
prosthetic devices to improve speech patterns (Gitto et al., 1999). In these 
cases, if prosthetic devices are considered as source of pre-established data, a 
false exclusion of identity may occur due to misleading antemortem data. 
Intraoral inspection is probably the most used and also the easiest and the 
most affordable technique. Nonetheless, if a comparative exam is required, a 
more detailed and exact study is needed (Pueyo et al., 1994; Thomas and van 
Wyk, 1988). In these cases, oral photography or oral impressions should be 
made (Caldas et al., 2007; Pueyo et al., 1994). These exams allow for a more 
detailed observation. In this step, a rugogram should be made, selecting one of 
the classifications described, considering the limitations previously explained. 
Calcorrugoscopy, or the overlay print of palatal rugae in a maxillary cast 
(Figure 6), can be used to facilitate the comparative analysis (Pueyo et al., 
1994). In this technique, using maxillary casts, palatal rugae pattern is 
highlighted and then photographed. Pre-established data are treated the same 
away, and both pictures are developed in transparent foils and matched to 
determine the overlap. Although effective, one must count for the possibility 
of distortion in any of the steps of this methodology (impressions, 
photography, etc.).

Stereoscopy is another complex technique, by which a three dimensional 
image of the palatal rugae anatomy can be obtained (Caldas et al., 2007; Pueyo 
et al., 1994). Sterophotogrammetry allows for an accurate determination of the 
length and position of every single palatal rugae (Caldas et al., 2007; Pueyo et 
al., 1994).  
Rai and Kapur (Rai and Kaur, 2013) described a new method for palatal 
rugae analysis, using a software called Palatal Rugae Comparison Software 
(PRCS Version 2.0). This software relies on the correspondence of several 
points (the initiation and termination point of each rugae, the tip and base of 
the incisive papilla) and the images are plotted together. The plotted points are 
then processed, and the possible match is assessed. The main advantage of this 
software is the possibility of working as a database, as it allows comparisons 
with previous loaded photographs.  
Still, due to its simplicity, price and reliability, direct observation and the 
study of maxillary dental casts are the most used techniques (Pueyo et al., 
1994). 
 
 
5. OTHER USES OF PALATOSCOPY 
 
In the last years, several studies have pointed out the use of palatal rugae 
pattern in human identification, namely in sex and ancestry estimation (Caldas 
et al., 2007; Saraf et al., 2011). 
 
 
5.1. Ancestry Estimation 
 
In terms of ancestry estimation, several population-specific studies have 
been published expressing an enthusiastic new approach that can be of the 
utmost importance in human positive identification. As a matter of fact, 
different parts of the world have demonstrated particular biometric features 
among palatal rugae pattern, such as in Portugal, Indonesia, Egypt, Nigeria, 
Australia, India or Jordan (Azab et al., 2016; Eboh, 2012; Kapali et al., 1997; 
Kotrashetti et al., 2011; More et al., 2015; Mustafa et al., 2014; Santos and 
Caldas, 2012; Suhartono et al., 2016). 
In their 1997 publication, Kapali and colleagues reported differences 
among Australian Aborigines and Caucasians, in palatal rugae number, shape 
and unification type (Kapali et al., 1997). They’ve found a higher number of 
primary rugae (categorized as A – 5 to 10mm; B- 10mm or more) in 

Palatoscopy in Human Identification 
79
Australian Aborigines, although Caucasians tended to show a higher 
proportion of rugae longer than 10mm. Qualitative differences were also 
found, and straight rugae were more common in Caucasians, and sinusoid 
patterns were more frequent in the Australian Aborigines. In the Aboriginal 
sample, unifications (classified as diverging and converging, depending if two 
rugae join at their origin or termination) were found to be less common, 
suggesting that different ethnic groups have a tendency to exhibit both 
qualitatively and quantitatively palatal rugae variations. Interestingly, these 
authors have tried to find an explanation to their results, suggesting that the 
differences in the pattern and in the length of the rugae could be explain by the 
existence of broader palates, generally an anatomical feature found in 
Aborigines. Yet, it remains unclear why Caucasians were found to have more 
rugae longer than 10mm compared with Aborigines (Kapali et al., 1997). 
The palatal rugae pattern of a Portuguese population has also been 
characterized, and the straight rugae type was the most prevalent (Santos and 
Caldas, 2012). These results differ from those of Kapali and colleagues in the 
Caucasian Australians (Kapali et al., 1997), where straight rugae were the less 
common pattern, suggesting differences among populations. 
Azab and colleagues (Azab et al., 2016), in a sample of adult Egyptians, 
showed that the sinusoid type was the most common palatal rugae pattern, 
followed by the straight, curved and circular types. The most frequent 
direction was the forward one, and unification wise, converging palatal rugae 
had a higher incidence than diverging rugae. Once more, inter-racial 
differences in palatal rugae were identified (Azab et al., 2016). 
Later on, in 2014, Mustafa and colleagues (Mustafa et al., 2014) stated 
that the Jordanian population has a tendency to express a specific rugae type. 
To date, this study is the first to describe the morphometric features of palatal 
rugae in Jordan, representing also the first study enrolling a larger sample 
(n=327 dental casts) when compared with previous published studies. 
Conversely to the Portuguese population (Santos and Caldas, 2012), in the 
Jordanian population sinusoid rugae type were predominant, followed by 
diverging, straight and curved, converging and circular. These investigators 
have also found that rugae with length over 5mm were more common type 
among the Jordanians (Mustafa et al., 2014).  
Likewise, Indonesian population’s rugae patterns have been characterized 
for forensic purposes. Despite the diversity among Indonesians (including, 
Javanese, Sundanese, Indonesian Chinese, Bataks and Malays), the authors 
stated that the sample was representative of the whole population. The most 
common palatal rugae were the straight, sinuous and curve types, representing 

Susana Braga, Maria Lurdes Pereira, Benedita Sampaio-Maia et al. 
80
together about 83% of all palatal rugae patterns. These outcomes substantiate a 
difference among palatal rugae patterns in different populations (Suhartono et 
al., 2016).  
Several studies carried out in India in different regions, suggested that the 
palatal rugae pattern can possibly vary geographically in subpopulations, 
which can, perhaps, be explained by the migration phenomenon, particularly 
from Nepal, Taiwan, Bhutan, Bangladesh and other countries (Gondivkar et 
al., 2011; Kotrashetti et al., 2011; Nayak et al., 2007).  
In 2011, investigators found that two ethnic groups of Indians from 
different regions (Maharashtra and Karnataka state) exhibited a significant 
difference among wavy, straight, circular and divergent type and they also had 
verified that the mean rugae number was greater among Maharashtra group 
when compared to the other studied population (Kotrashetti et al., 2011). Still 
according to the rugae shapes, Maharashtra state group was found to have 
more straight type, whereas Karnataka state population showed a greater 
number of wavy forms. 
Comparing Indian and Nepalese population, More and colleagues (More 
et al., 2015) have concluded that the rugae shape in all the participants (100 
Indians and 100 Nepalese) are quite similar, but the location of palatal rugae 
differ among them representing a distinctive feature in both groups. In Indians, 
rugae were located between posterior edge of incisive papilla and distal 
surface of canine on both sides of the palate. On the other hand, Nepalese 
participants were found to have rugae placed between distal surface of lateral 
incisor and distal surface of second premolar, on either side of palatal raphae, 
remaining the pre-maxillary region unfilled of rugae. Nevertheless this 
interesting finding, more studies are required to better understand if the 
uniqueness of palatal rugae pattern associated to a specific population have a 
potential distinctive not only among several studied variables (such as, type or 
number) but also in the location.  
 
 
5.2. Sex Estimation 
 
The use of palatal rugae for sex estimation has been explored for many 
authors and the results are not consistent regarding the usefulness of this tool 
to discriminate between sexes. 
In two Australian populations (Aborigines and Caucasians), the average 
number of rugae in the Aboriginal participants had no significant differences 
between the sexes, being 5.0 and 4.9 for males and females, respectively. 

Palatoscopy in Human Identification 
81
Additionally, no statistically significant difference in number of rugae between 
right and left sides was evident for either sex (Kapali et al., 1997). 
Further studies were carried out and, in 2007, Nayak and colleagues 
characterized the differences in the palatal rugae shape in two populations of 
India. Wavy and curved were the most prevalent rugae shape in both sexes, 
followed by straight rugae. Unifications were few and circular rugae were not 
observed. No significant differences between sexes were observed. However, 
the authors stated in their conclusions that the results should consider that the 
data were obtained with a small simple size and further work on larger 
samples was required to validate the findings (Nayak et al., 2007). 
In 2013 Shetty and collaborators designed a study aimed to analyze the 
palatal rugae pattern in two populations in South India (Kodovas and 
Malayalees) and evaluate the rugae pattern between sexes within each group. 
A significant difference between males and females for straight rugae pattern 
among Malayalees was found (Shetty et al., 2015), suggesting that the ruga 
shape can be used in sex estimation. 
Also in an Indian based study, Jibi and co-workers, in 2011 designed an 
investigation that aimed to identify and compare the rugae pattern between 
males and females of two different communities in the city of Davangere, 
Karnataka, India (Jibi et al., 2011). Their findings revealed that rugae features 
showed no significant differences between right and left sides for either 
communities or sex. However, regarding shape and unification, females 
showed a significantly higher diverging rugae pattern while males had a 
significant number of circular and converging type of rugae, suggesting that 
the rugae pattern can be an additional method of differentiation in forensic 
sciences together with the other methods such as visual, fingerprints, and 
dental characteristics.  
These findings are supported by those of Saraf and colleagues that, in 
2011, found statistically significant results regarding rugae shape between 
sexes. The converging type was more frequent in females whilst the circular 
types were greater in number in males. The use of logistic regression allowed 
sex estimation with a high accuracy (>99%) suggesting that this statistical 
method can be a useful and an additional tool of analyses when palatal rugae 
are used to discriminate sex. However, no significant difference in the total 
number and length measurements of rugae was found between sexes (Saraf et 
al., 2011). 
Also in 2011, Barath and co-workers, in a sample of one hundred males 
and females, equally distributed, of coastal Andhra population, found that 
differences in unification pattern among males and females were statistically 

Susana Braga, Maria Lurdes Pereira, Benedita Sampaio-Maia et al. 
82
different. Inversely, the total number of the rugae was not significantly 
different between sexes. The association between rugae length and shape with 
sex determination was calculated using discriminant analysis, which enabled 
sex differentiation with an accuracy of 78%. Yet, apart from these results, and 
based in the methodology used (sample size and classification system), the 
authors stated the need of further investigations (Bharath et al., 2011). 
Once more, regarding palatal rugae number, Eboh, in a study aiming to 
describe palatal rugae patterns among Urhobo ethnic nation resident in 
Abraka, Delta State, South-Southern, Nigeria, found that females have more 
rugae compared to males, despite not being a statistically significant 
difference. Even this can suggest a tendency, more studies with larger samples 
are required to assess if the number of palatal rugae is sex-specific (Eboh, 
2012). Similar conclusions were reached by Nagalaxmi and co-workers 
(Nagalaxmi et al., 2014).  
In 2015, a study in a sample of 100 maxillary casts of Sudanese Nubians 
students from various universities located in Khartoum, was used to determine 
the prevalence of palatal rugae different biometric characteristics, exploring 
the existence of asymmetry, and to determine their effectiveness in correctly 
identifying sex using logistic regression (Ahmed and Hamid, 2015). The 
authors recommended when palatal rugae are the only tool available to 
discriminate sex they shouldn’t be used in the Sudanese Nubian population 
since the obtained predictive value was 60%, and current orientations 
recommend a predictive value of 65% when using only ruga shapes. 
Recent studies support that palatal rugae pattern may not be a useful tool 
for sex estimation, particularly if used alone. For instance, a 2015 study 
conducted in a pediatric Indian population hypothesizes that rugae are 
important in human identification since no two palates showed similar type of 
rugae in either sexes (Thabitha et al., 2015). However, as no significant 
difference between sexes existed, the authors conclude that rugae pattern 
contributes minimally towards sex determination. The same conclusions were 
reached by Muhasilovic and collaborators, in 2016 (Muhasilovic et al., 2016), 
who did not determine statistically significant differences in the total number 
of palatal rugae between the sexes, in a population sample from Bosnia and 
Herzegovina (Sarajevo Canton). Using logistic regression analysis the authors 
concluded this statistical method was more successful in classifying males, 
69% of them, while for women the success rate was significantly lower with 
only 41%. In total, 55% of subjects were correctly classified. The authors 
concluded that regarding palatal rugae and sex prediction, logistic regression 

Palatoscopy in Human Identification 
83
analysis could be used as an additional tool for differentiation method for the 
population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
 
 
6. LIMITATIONS OF PALATOSCOPY 
 
The major difficulty of palatoscopy is the lack of a universal consistent 
classification method of palatal rugae. Indeed, the subjective nature of the 
interpretation intra and inter-observer, resulting in ambiguous definitions of 
palatal rugae pattern, has been reported in many studies (Caldas et al., 2007; 
Jain and Chowdhary, 2014; Patil et al., 2008; Suhartono et al., 2016). As stated 
in the forensic literature, there are several classifications (Caldas et al., 2007; 
Pueyo et al., 1994), and misinterpretation related to a given shape type can 
occur. For instance, in Trobo, Basauri or Thomas and Kotze classifications, 
the supporting example drawings from wavy/sinuous do not differ 
significantly from line/straight shape of others classifications. The same can be 
assessed to angled and curved shapes, which has not been clear explained, 
which can lead, naturally to deviations in classification (Suhartono et al., 
2016). So, it is of the utmost importance to establish a standard and universal 
classification, which can critically modify the existing paradigm.  
Many researchers stated that there are several external factors that can 
modify the original palatal rugae patterning, as orthodontic treatment, dental 
extractions, periodontal surgery, cleft palate surgery or even forced eruption of 
impacted canines, which can change the length or the direction of palatal rugae 
(Caldas et al., 2007; Jain and Chowdhary, 2014). It is also reported that finger 
sucking in childhood can produce a local effect in palatal rugae position 
(Caldas et al., 2007; Eboh, 2012; Jain and Chowdhary, 2014). Furthermore, 
proliferative benign and malignant lesions can affect directly palatal mucosa 
and/or the bone beneath, resulting in a significant loss of palatal characteristics 
depending on the extension of the disease. 
Among criminal scenarios, palatoscopy doesn’t represent the ideal tool to 
establish a linking between a suspect and a crime scene, because it is not 
expect that, due their anatomical position, palatal rugae evidence can be found 
and be useful in biological criminalistics expertise (Caldas et al., 2007). 
Forensic literature has explored new fields, particularly regarding to 
human identification. In fact necro-identification can be assessed with unusual 
scientific techniques, as palatoscopy. Therefore, it is recognized that palatal 
rugae pattern is unique to each individual, remaining unchanged during life 
and possessing postmortem resistance (Caldas et al., 2007; Jain and 

Susana Braga, Maria Lurdes Pereira, Benedita Sampaio-Maia et al. 
84
Chowdhary, 2014; Mustafa et al., 2014; Patil et al., 2008). Furthermore, 
several studies have been bringing insights about this feature as a potential 
discriminator between different ancestries (Azab et al., 2016; Eboh, 2012; 
Gondivkar et al., 2011; Kapali et al., 1997; Kotrashetti et al., 2011; More et al., 
2015; Mustafa et al., 2014; Nayak et al., 2007; Santos and Caldas, 2012; 
Suhartono et al., 2016). Further investigations are required with larger samples 
and accurate representation of the analyzed population. To date, the existing 
forensic results have demonstrated that a specific rugae pattern can be 
influenced by ethnicity, which can aid as a supplementary tool to the 
reconstruction of the biological profile in the complex and challenging human 
identification process. 
Following this argument, it is also source of consensus among forensic 
investigators that the lack of more studies remains inevitably one of the 
problems of palatoscopy. But we consider that all the research that has been 
carried out represents a motivating future to this area. Every published data 
can encourage more investigators to contribute in all the different surprising 
and interesting forensic targets, namely ethnicity and sexual dimorphism. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
In recent years it has become increasingly clear that palatoscopy is a 
valuable forensic technique within both reconstructive and comparative 
methodologies aiming human identification, given that the palatal rugae 
pattern is permanent, exclusive, and remains immutable throughout life (with 
small exceptions that may cause changes in rugae length and position). This 
forensic methodology is particularly valuable in necro-identification as palatal 
rugae resist decomposition changes for up to seven days after death. In this 
sense, it should be promoted the collection, storage and database creation of 
palatal rugae photography or impression, among dentist and other oral health 
professionals.  
Currently the main difficulty in palatoscopy is the lack of a universal 
consistent classification method of palatal rugae. This chapter describes seven 
different classification methodologies, although others can be found. The 
available methodology varies from simple, but with lack of rigor, to complex, 
but difficult to apply. In our opinion the best available methods are the Basauri 
or Trobo classifications (which are quite similar). Still, guidelines should be 
developed by the scientific community promoting the creation of a simple, yet 
complete and rigorous method to classify palatal rugae. 

Palatoscopy in Human Identification 
85
Besides necro-identification by comparison to previous established data, 
palatal rugae are being investigated for ancestry and sex estimation. In 
ancestry estimation wise, palatoscopy seems promising, given that many 
studies conducted in different populations appear to find significant 
differences between populations and ethnicities. However, international 
comparative studies should be conducted to define reliable population-specific 
palatal rugae patterns. The studies using palatoscopy for sex estimation, 
however, are not consensual. For example, we’ve found studies stating that 
females have more converging rugae pattern whereas others found that 
females presented higher diverging rugae pattern in comparison to males. 
Thus, further studies, with higher number of participants, should be performed. 
In conclusion, palatoscopy is a growing area in forensic sciences, and 
represents 
currently 
an 
innovative 
complementary 
tool 
in 
human 
identification.

ABSTRACT 
The methods introduced in this paper are designed for the analysis of 
strongly 
irregular 
environmental 
patterns, 
including 
streaming 
environmental data. Two different approaches to variable scale are 
addressed in this context. The first one focuses on the size of the “grains” 
handled in the data, varying data resolution; it considers time series 
elements to represent successive states of a dynamic system, in order to 
identify and characterize patterns and pattern change in the dynamic 
system’s behaviour. The second approach starts from an existing analysis 
method (Haar wavelets), which includes the scanning of a wide range of 
time scales. It builds on this method by adding an algorithm designed to 
be capable of grasping time- and time-scale-dependent pattern features, as 
well as making comprehensive scale-by-scale comparisons of patterns

applicability area and are illustrated with time series corresponding to

INTRODUCTION 
 
The urgent need to better understand and address environmental systems 
has led to ample monitoring programs, which have been producing 
increasingly large quantities of fast streaming data. Larger data volumes and 
enhanced data quality are valuable to the study of complex environmental 
issues, but only if they are complemented by powerful analysis methods. The 
latter are expected to capture useful information on complex systems, to offer 
unambiguous answers to key questions, and to better support decision making. 
Such methods should thus be capable of grasping essential features of the 
studied systems, which often involve nonlinear relationships dominating 
different temporal and spatial scales. 
The methodology for pattern analysis dedicated to natural processes has 
been developing fast. Numerous methods have been specifically dedicated to 
the temporal behaviour of complex natural systems, as reflected in time series 
(Malamud and Turcotte, 1999; Kantz and Schreiber, 2004; Donner and 
Barbosa, 2008; Mudelsee, 2010). However, no single method can exhaustively 
describe the patterns produced by natural systems, with their specific, time-
dependent irregularities expressed on a wide range of temporal scales. 
Therefore, new methods are created in order to address specific challenges 
raised by the study of complex systems. 
The methodology introduced in this paper is designed for the analysis of 
strongly irregular environmental patterns, including streaming environmental 
data. Two different approaches to scale are addressed in this context: the first 
one varies the size of the “grains” handled in the data (“data granularity” or 
“resolution”). The second one varies the size of the time scales involved in the 
data analysis algorithm. Both of these approaches include pattern change 
detection and characterization among their targets. While the applicability area 
of the presented methodology is broad, both of the approaches are applied in

this paper to time series corresponding to atmospheric variables. Concrete 
application examples are meant to offer a better understanding of the time 
series properties that can be grasped with the proposed methodology in new 
ways. 
Historically, surface air temperature has been one of the best represented 
atmospheric variables worldwide. Compared to other aspects of the 
atmosphere, it could be easily recorded in a relatively reliable way. For this 
reason, for some locations we benefit today from temperature records of 
considerable length (ranging from decades to one or two centuries), longer 
than for other atmospheric variables. The available instrumental record lengths 
are not ideal for climate change studies (the latter thus rely on a wealth of 
other sources of information), but they can be useful for the exploration of 
aspects of climate variability on such temporal scales. Data concerning 
atmospheric pressure and wind speed, on the other hand, are more difficult to 
find as uninterrupted long records. However, technological progress has made 
reliable, high-sampling-rate, affordable data acquisition possible: therefore, for 
certain locations the reduced length in terms of recorded time intervals is 
complemented by increased overall time series length due to a superior 
sampling rate. 
The remarkable advantages of wind energy compared to other energy 
sources – the non-renewable ones, or even some of the renewable ones – have 
led to a surge in research efforts concerning this resource (Juhlin et al., 2014) 
to address the challenges it involves. A key aspect of these challenges are 
related to uncertainties: on one hand, we do not yet have effective ways of 
storing the energy acquired from wind, so that the temporal pattern of wind 
energy conversion is reflected in the energy availability pattern; on the other 
hand, wind is characterized by intermittency, which is expressed on a wide 
range of time scales. In this context, a better understanding of the uncertainties 
involved in temporal aspects of energy availability is particularly important. 
Although reliable methodological instruments have been developed for this 
purpose, there are still important gaps concerning key features of wind 
patterns. For instance, the widely used wind speed distributions, while useful, 
do not reflect the effects that the actual sequence of the time series values have 
on the wind turbine and consequently on the power that is eventually made 
available (Leahy and McKeogh, 2012). Likewise, the wind speed patterns 
involve a wide range of scales, and their properties vary across the scale 
spectrum (Kirchner-Bossi et al., 2015; Archer and Jacobson, 2013); moreover, 
scale-dependent pattern characteristics change over time. It is therefore 
important for the analysis to capture the scaling aspects in the pattern, but also

to describe their scale-by-scale temporal behavior. The methodological 
approaches presented here address the goals discussed in this chapter. 
 
 
A VARIABLE GRANULARITY APPROACH 
 
The key goals of the method introduced below concern the identification 
and quantitative characterization of properties of patterns and pattern change, 
based on time series analysis of variables that reflect the dynamics of the 
studied system. The method considers the elements of time series as discrete 
outputs of a dynamic system subject to transitions from one state to another, 
for example from Ai to Aj, where the states Ai and Aj are elements of the set of 
accessible states of the system over the analyzed time interval. These states are 
represented in the time series by the values ai and aj, respectively, of the 
monitored variable. Each element in the succession of values in the time series 
can thus be considered to represent a transition from one available state to 
another available state in the framework of the system dynamics. To study the 
system dynamics in terms of the transitions that make up a time series 
segment, we can use a matrix representation of all possible transitions. For this 
approach, the key parameter for the construction of the matrix is data 
granularity or resolution. In this paper, the granularity r is defined as the 
smallest possible difference between two distinct time series elements: 
 
 
(1) 
 
Based on the resolution r and on the smallest value amin and the largest 
value amax in the studied time series segment, we establish the set of accessible 
states as the set of all the values between amin and amax with a step equal to r. 
The set of L values corresponding to the accessible states is used to define the 
L lines and L columns in the transition frequency matrix. In this way, every 
possible transition among the accessible states corresponds to one element in 
the matrix (Figure 1; grey cells represent transitions that have frequency of 
occurrence zero in the studied time series segment).  
All the pairs of successive values in the time series are then counted and 
represented in the matrix: the total number of transitions from state i to state j 
will thus be found in the matrix cell ti,j. One should note that the transition 
frequency matrix does not have to be symmetric, since the number of 
transitions from state i to state j may or may not have be the same with the one 

Variable-Scale-Based Pattern Analysis for Time Series … 
95
for transitions from state j to state i; nor do its diagonal elements ti,i all have to 
have one and the same value, since the situations in which the system can be 
found in the same state in successive time snapshots can differ from one time 
series value to another. We should also note that the matrix does not 
correspond to a Marcov process, which would have endowed it with special 
properties: the processes we study are typically characterized by long-range 
correlations, and the transition to a new state would not be history-
independent. 
 
 
Figure 1. Example of a transition frequency matrix: e.g., the system has suffered t1,2 
times a transition from state A1 to state A2, and has never experienced the same state 
A1 in successive snapshots. 
One may find that the system undergoes some of the transitions many 
times during a given time interval. In this context we are looking for the 
number of transitions in the matrix that have occurred at least once during the 
studied time interval. We thus count all the non-zero cells in the transition 
frequency matrix and determine the proportion of such cells out of the set of 
all cells in the matrix:

In order to characterize the temporal evolution of the dynamic system, one 
could now follow the variation in the number of distinct transitions, N, over 
time. However, this procedure would not offer a rigorous approach to the 
dynamics reflected in the time series. First, the transition frequency matrix 
would strongly depend on granularity, and data granularity or resolution 
represents an arbitrary choice (for example, it can be based on technological 
criteria, i.e., on the characteristics of the data acquisition instrument). Second, 
the results would depend on the total number of accessible states, which can 
also vary arbitrarily: for instance, if a time series is subject to a trend, the total 
number of accessible states varies with the length of the analyzed time series 
segment.  
 
 
Figure 2. Relation between granularity (r) and the number of distinct transitions (N). 
Consequently, we will not rely on the number of transitions or on a certain 
granularity value. Instead, we study the way in which the number of distinct 
transitions depends on granularity, whith the latter covering a range of 
granularity values:

we do not rely on any of these individual values, but on the relationship 
between N and r. If this relationship turns out to be a power law (Figure 2) for

then the exponent g characterizes the system dynamics from the point of view 
of its transition frequencies associated with its accessible states. We will call g 
the granularity exponent. 
For the reasons described in the preceding chapter, the method will 
address questions that are important for a better understanding of atmospheric 
variables, which are also key to wind power studies; it will first be illustrated 
using time series of atmospheric variables recorded by the weather station of 
the Department of Environmental Science and the Department of Astronomy 
and Physics at Saint Mary`s University in Halifax, Canada. The analyzed time 
series represent wind speed, atmospheric temperature, and atmospheric 
pressure, recorded with a ten minute sampling rate (Figure 3). Atmospheric 
variable records may look as if they were separate series of data, to be 
considered in isolation; their meaning is not always explored using an 
integrated approach to all the available variables. For instance, wind speed, 
atmospheric pressure and atmospheric temperature records all reflect the 
dynamics of one and the same system as “seen” from one location through the 
lens of a set of instruments characterized by a certain resolution, a certain 
sampling rate, etc. It is thus important to learn in what way and to what extent 
the different time series recorded simultaneously reflect features of the 
dynamic behaviour of the system. 
The application of the steps described above led to the power law relation 
shown in Eq. (6) for all the studied variables and time segments. Figure 2 
illustrates this power law, obtained in this case for wind speed. The presence 
of the power law given in Eq. (6) is an important feature of such natural time 
series. It reveals self-similarity properties in the pattern, which can be more 
easily seen by analyzing the transition frequency matrix: indeed, the matrix is 
similar to itself when viewed on different scales, and in this case when using 
different values of granularity. The self-similar structure is characterized by 
the granularity exponent g, which is established over a certain scale range.

This property of the matrix is particularly useful from a methodological 
point of view. In fact, repeatedly constructing the transition frequency matrix 
for each value of the granularity can be time consuming, thus decreasing the 
effectiveness of the method in circumstances in which the analysis should be 
performed in a strictly limited time (as is the case when one addresses 
streaming environmental data). Due to the self-similarity that characterizes the 
matrix, a procedure-accelerating algorithm can be designed. The algorithm 
comprises the following steps: (i) the smallest available granularity size is 
selected; (ii) the transition frequency matrix is then constructed for this 
granularity value, as described above; (iii) the number of distinct transitions 
characterizing the pattern for that particular granularity is determined; (iv) the 
data granularity is increased, and the procedure is repeated starting with point 
(iii) above. If the successive granularity values are chosen to be multiples of 
the initial, smallest granularity, phase (iii) can be performed very fast. In this 

Variable-Scale-Based Pattern Analysis for Time Series … 
99
way, the transition frequency matrix is generated only once, after which the 
numbers N(r) can be immediately obtained for other values of r by the mere 
addition of the values in adjacent cells: for every new value ri, each cell is 
equivalent to the sum of the smaller cells corresponding to ri-1. In this 
procedure, one can thus recognize the box-counting algorithm (Feder, 1988), 
which is a reliable and fast method widely used for the determination of the 
fractal dimension of highly irregular patterns. In other words, the procedure to 
be followed according to the proposed methodology consists of (a) 
determining the transition frequency matrix only once, as shown above, for the 
smallest granularity value to be studied, and (b) applying the box-counting 
method to the existing transition matrix. The latter phase can be performed 
very fast, given the nature of the method, as well as the existence of rapid box-
counting algorithms (Jiménez and de Miras, 2012). The problem related to the 
most time-consuming part of the procedure involved multiple matrix 
generation phases possibly hindering the application of the method to 
streaming data. With this technique, the issue is eliminated, and the method 
can be applied even when the processing time is critical. 
The described procedures were applied to the three time series mentioned 
above and shown in Figure 3. The power law given in Eq. (6) was found in 
each case, with a correlation coefficient higher than 99%. The resulting g-
values for each analyzed time segment are shown in Figure 4. 
The values of the g-exponent vary from one variable to another, which is 
not surprising considering the nature of the variables. However, since all the 
three variables – wind speed, atmospheric temperature, and atmospheric 
pressure – are an expression of one and the same dynamic system, their 
patterns might reflect their common origin. However, the graphical 
representation of the time series (Figure 3) shows how different the temporal 
patterns of the three variables are. In spite of this diversity, one can notice 
similarities among the g-value graphs in Figure 4, more so than among the 
graphs of the variables themselves (Figure 3): for instance, in all three graphs 
in Figure 4 there are minimum or low value points on day 4, and a higher 
value interval on days 6 and 7, followed by a decrease on day 8. Of course, the 
level of detail in the g-graphs is lower than in the original variable graphs, 
since the latter correspond to the acquisition sampling interval (10 minutes), 
while the former represent each day by one point on the graph. Even after 
taking this distinction in consideration, one can still identify the parallels 
among the g-graphs for time series that look very different from each other, 
which suggests that the method captures features of the system dynamics, even 
if common properties of the dynamics are less visible in the time series graphs.

3. The lines connecting the points are only meant to guide the eye. 
We have also applied this method to different sets of data, to check its 
outcomes on a longer time scale (decades rather than days) and to compare 
them to a different way of capturing the variability in the dataset – a statistical 
measure of dispersion. The dataset consists of maximum daily surface air 
temperature recorded in Vardø, a high-latitude northern station located in 
Norway (more details about this station are provided in the next chapter). Due 
to the richness of this dataset, the presented methodology can be applied to 
produce a more detailed picture than the one obtained above. Intervals of 5 
years shifted for each point by one year were analyzed, and for each interval 
the standard deviation s and the granularity exponent g were determined.

The resulting values were normalized in order to cover the interval [0,1], 
facilitating the comparison between the two ways of describing the different 
time segments. The resulting graphs are shown in Figures 5 and 6. One can 
notice in both graphs a decreasing tendency between the eighties and the first 
years of the new millennium. However, unlike the standard deviation, the 
granularity exponent shows a steady decrease throughout the whole studied 
interval, whereas the standard deviation presents a plateau for the first decades 
of the record. Moreover, a periodic oscillation fingerprint can be more clearly 
noticed on the g-value graph. One can thus see that the two ways of describing 
the pattern capture distinct features, emphasizing the idea that different 
methods (relying on different principles) see the pattern from different angles, 
and together they may offer us information that is not available from any of 
the individual approaches. 
Both applications show that the variable granularity method can identify 
scaling properties of the pattern referring to the transitions of the system 
among its available states, as well as quantitatively evaluating the variability 
of the pattern related to the dynamics it expresses through such transitions. 
The method can thus reveal a scaling property of time series that is related to, 
but goes beyond those identified with the methodology that is currently 
applied (Malamud and Turcotte, 1999): this self-similarity fingerprint is 
revealed due to the effects of variable resolution. The proposed approach can 
fruitfully complement the current methods dedicated to the characterization of 
patterns in time series. 
 
 
A VARIABLE TIME SCALE APPROACH 
 
A relevant assessment of temporal change in atmospheric variability 
requires a set of methods capable of characterizing various aspects of the 
studied variables. Among the latter, air temperature is by far the one most 
widely studied. Reports of Arctic communities concerning a growing 
variability of weather patterns and their diminishing prediction capability 
based on local knowledge have led to scientific studies regarding changes in 
temperature pattern variability. However, these studies have not produced 
convergent results: the various methods have led to different conclusions 
concerning the problem of changing variability (Suteanu, 2015a). This is not 
surprising, considering that (a) weather variability perception may rely on 
factors that are different from air temperature patterns, and (b) surface air 
temperature patterns themselves enjoy a range of properties, some of which

103 
are quantitatively captured by the methodology applied in various studies, but 
no set of methods can identify “all” the aspects of such patterns of change. 
New methods, especially if they rely on novel analysis principles, could 
uncover pattern properties that have not been previously identified, 
contributing to our picture of the complexity of environmental dynamics. The 
method presented below will therefore address atmospheric temperature 
datasets from meteorological stations located at high northern latitudes, 
focusing on particularly important pattern features: long term correlations. In 
fact, time series of natural variables such as wind speed and surface air 
temperature have been found to be characterized by long-range correlations 
(Fraedrich et al., 2009; Lovejoy and Schertzer, 2013; Suteanu, 2015b, Fortuna 
et al., 2016). In other words, their autocorrelation function is characterized by 
a slow, gradual decrease, which does not follow an exponential function, but a 
power law. The accurate assessment of time series with such properties require 
adequate tools. These can, for instance, establish the relation between the 
average size of the fluctuation and the time scale corresponding to the 
evaluation window of the fluctuation, while scanning a range of temporal 
scales for the analysis window. The most widely applied methods in this 
category are Detrended Fluctuation Analysis and Wavelets Analysis. Most 
importantly, these methods are capable of accurately addressing the typically 
nonstationary nature of such time series. In this study we apply wavelets, 
which offer an elegant and powerful approach to natural time series 
characterized by strong irregularity on multiple scales (Holschneider, 1995; 
Nason and von Sachs, 1999). We focus in particular on Haar wavelets, a tool 
characterized by simplicity and effectiveness with respect to the evaluation of 
time series such as those considered here (Lovejoy et al., 2012). 
The method is applied to time series representing daily minimum and 
maximum surface air temperature in two coastal locations at the northern edge 
of Norway (Klein Tank et al., 2002): Vardø (coordinates: 70.37N, 31.08E, 
altitude: 14m) and Fruholmen Fyr (coordinates: 71.09N, 24.00E, altitude: 
13m). The processing starts with the seasonal detrending of the time series, by 
computing the average temperature for each day of the year over the whole 
dataset, after which this average temperature is subtracted from each daily 
value. This step is followed by the normalization of the resulting time series. 
The outcome is a time series h(i) with an average of zero and a standard 
deviation equal to 1. The time series h(i) is then divided into sections of v 
successive elements, and the average size of the fluctuation F in temporal 
windows of size v is calculated as follows:

where the subscript x means that the average of this expression is taken for all 
values of x. Subsequently, we check the presence of a power law relation 
between the temporal length or “time scale” v and the average size of the 
fluctuation F over that time scale: 
 
  
(8) 
 
The exponent K in this equation characterizes the time series persistence (or its 
degree of “smoothness”) over the range of scales covered by Eq. (8). When 
applied to the integral of the time series rather than to the time series itself, the 
method produces exponent values that are larger by 1 than those 
corresponding to the actual time series: the method indeed leads to outcomes 
that are very close to the theoretical relationships between these two sets of 
exponents.

Examples of scaling relations like the one given in Eq. (8) are shown in 
Figure 7. While such time series are nonstationary, one can divide the 
analyzed dataset in windows, and characterize each window in order to get an 
image of the way in which the pattern is changing over time (Nason and von 
Sachs, 1999). This approach has led to the detection of pattern similarities 
regarding the change of K over time in different locations, and to the 
suggestion of Suteanu and Mandea (2012) to define atmospheric dynamics 
regions based on pattern change similarities in various locations. 
This methodology can be extended to provide information on the pattern 
properties as a function of temporal scale, as well as on the way in which these 
properties vary over time. Indeed, instead of assessing the “overall 
persistence” for the whole scale range, we can assess and represent persistence 
for each scale interval. The relevance of the scale-by-scale detailed behaviour 
of the graph that leads to the identification of Eq. (8) was underlined by 
Maraun et al. (2004), who proposed to look at the successive slopes of graphs 
like those in Figure 7, and to represent them as a function of scale (see also 
Figure 6 in Suteanu, 2015a).

Fyr.

Figure 9. Time-scale vs. time diagram for maximum temperature records, Fruholmen 
Fyr. 
To accomplish the above-mentioned objectives, the extension of the 
method involves several additional operations, as well as a different type of 
graphical representation. We rotate the graph resulting from the scale-
dependent assessment of the successive slopes by 90 degrees. Furthermore, 
instead of showing the graph for only one temporal interval, we horizontally 
align the graphs for all the successive analyzed time windows. In this way we 
obtain a new type of diagram, in which the horizontal axis corresponds to 
time, and the vertical axis shows the time scales, while the slope values 
corresponding to successive scale intervals are represented according to a 
colour code. 
The diagram (like those presented in Figure 8 and Figure 9) can be seen as 
a “time vs. time-scale” isopersistence map. This representation offers the 
advantage of showing the temporal development of the pattern, by bringing 
together results that arise from a multitude of graphs and by showing for each 
interval the slopes for each scale range. One can see in Figures 8 and 9 that 
there are time intervals for which the persistence is higher and covers a 
relatively wide scale interval, whereas for other time intervals the diagram 
colours indicate less strong persistence.

With the help of such diagrams, questions concerning changes in 
variability over time can be answered in a more nuanced way than through a 
graph showing a persistence value for each time interval. One can notice in the 
diagrams that changes in variability occur, over time, for different time scale

intervals in different ways, and associating only one number to each interval 
(as other methods do) implies a strong simplification, which is not always 
helpful. Moreover, the described method allows us to zoom in, zoom out, and 
move the focus of our exploration in the “time-scale vs. time” plane as needed. 
Examples of diagram details obtained by zooming in (i.e., by changing the 
time scale interval and the temporal interval selected for the diagram) are 
presented in Figures 10 and 11. One can notice that the upper end of the time 
scale is changed from 100 days to more than 300 and more than 600 days, 
respectively, while the time scale for the diagram is reduced to 6 years. 
 
 
Figure 12. Time-scale vs. time diagram for maximum temperature records from Vardø. 
Figures 12 and 13 present the diagrams for the maximum temperature 
records in Vardø, and a map detail produced by zooming into the time interval 
corresponding to the first seven years of the third millennium, respectively. 
Figures 10, 11, and 13 show that zooming operations, although straightforward 
and fast to accomplish with the proposed methodology, can reveal pattern 
structures and details of time-scale vs. time features that are not easy to 
identify with the help of other methods. Such diagrams also show that 
temporal changes in variability cannot be merely represented by a single line 
on a graph, since such changes occur in time-scale-specific ways. These 
results also provide an explanation for the difficulties encountered with respect 
to the question whether variability of weather patterns is actually changing

over time: it is in fact difficult to tell what aspects of the complex variable 
patterns are mostly affecting people’s perception of change. The presented 
methodology can thus be effectively applied to studies on climate variability 
and implications of climate change.

The methodology supports comprehensive comparisons of patterns. For 
instance, it offers the tools to produce diagrams representing scale-by-scale 
comparisons of variability patterns corresponding to different locations; this is 
particularly useful when regions are defined by the way in which temporal 
variability changes take place in distinct locations (Suteanu and Mandea, 
2012). Figure 14 presents the outcome of a comparison of daily maximum 
temperature patterns in the two studied locations. One can distinguish the time 
periods emphasizing the strongest similarities among the patterns from the two 
stations, as well as the time scale intervals affected by stronger or weaker 
change. For example, one can see in Figure 14 that dissimilarities are 
particularly notable for time scales longer than log10(v) = 1.5, i.e., for time 
scales longer than one month; in terms of time flow, a time interval that stands 
out regarding pattern difference is 1984-1986, which is by far not an 
exceptional interval in the individual diagrams that are compared (Figures 9 
and 12). Similarly, the methodology can be used for detailed, scale-related 
comparisons involving patterns from the same location, but corresponding to 
different time periods, offering new instruments to study implications of 
climate change. 
While easy to implement and fast to run, the method leading to time-scale 
vs. time diagrams avoids the involvement of arbitrary time intervals; it 
addresses variability on all time scales available in the data, producing 
diagrams that are easy to read and to interpret. This approach can therefore be 
successfully used for the characterization of location-specific features and the 
reliable detection of temporal fingerprints of the pattern. 
 
 
CONCLUSION 
 
The pattern analysis methods presented in this paper represent tools for 
the identification and quantitative characterization of patterns and pattern 
change. They are designed for the analysis of strongly irregular environmental 
patterns, including streaming environmental data.  
Both methods involve variable-scale-based algorithms. The first one 
focuses on the scale at which we consider the data, varying their resolution. 
The second method starts from Haar wavelets analysis and incorporates a 
novel algorithm capable of grasping time- and time-scale-dependent pattern 
features. The presented methodology has a broad applicability area and is 
illustrated here with examples of time series of atmospheric variables: wind 
speed, atmospheric pressure, and atmospheric temperature time series.

The two approaches provide mutually complementary information 
regarding pattern characterization. They should thus be selected as a function 
of the questions asked and the data types to be addressed. These methods can 
be applied in conjunction with current approaches in order to contribute to a 
more detailed and reliable picture of the studied systems. While easy to 
implement and fast to run, the presented methods can be successfully applied 
to the study of a range of aspects of climate variability and climate change.
