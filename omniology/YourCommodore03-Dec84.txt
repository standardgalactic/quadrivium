PURE MAGIC!
Join Alice in her journey through Videolond - an enchanted place populated by strange creatures such as bread-and-
butterﬂies and pipe smoking caterpillars; where little girls change size and ﬂamingos turn into croquet mallets!
Alice in Videoland is a revolutionary new concept in entertainment for the Commodore 64, incorporating some of the ﬁnest
graphics ever seen on any home computer, accompanied bya charming musical score. There are four different game scenes
involved, and your performance in earlier ones will affect your ability to get through later ones and determine your eventual
total score.
Scene O ne - Stunning title page graphics give way to the ﬁrst game scene as Alice falls into the rabbit's warren. Score
points for collecting the objects to be found there - including keys to open doors, bottles to make her smaller, cakes to make
her bigger!
Scene Two - Out in the garden the Cheshire cat looks on as Alice meets the pipe-smoking caterpillar. Help her to catch the
bread-and-butterﬂies and the rocking-horse ﬂies that change into the balls used in the croquet game in the last scene!
Scene Three - Alice is a pawn in the chess game where her opponents are the Jabberwocky and Tweedledum and
Tweedledee. Help her across the board by protecting her with your White Knights!
Scene Four -The most bizarre croquet game ever! Help Alice hit the balls through the playing-card-soldier hoops before
the Queen of Hearts stomps on them!
Alice in Videoland is available for the Commodore 64 on disk - E12.95, and now on cassette - E8•95.
Alice in Videoland features graphics created with the Koala Pad.

Introduce another
issue of Your

WELCOME i t )  THE i  HIRD
issue of Your Commodore. If
you've already ﬁngered
through t h e pages then I
needn't t e l l  y o u  t h a t ,
once again, it's jam-packed
with t h e latest news, r e -
views, g ames, u t ilit ies,
special features and much,
much more. If not, then bear
with me until curiosity tempts
you to turn the page.
Since you last feasted your
eyes upon a  copy of Your
Commodore. they've b een
working their ﬁngers to the
bone over at Commodore. Not
only have the long-awaited 16
and Plus 4  machines been
launched and exhibited to the
world at large, but a host of
new peripherals and software
has also been released. How
will the 16 fare in the face of
growing competition? Read
our article and judge f o r
yourself. Commodore have
also ﬁnally unleashed their
Commodore 64 Communic-
ations Modem and CompuNet,
the new on-line service for
Commodore users. But you'll
have to see next month's Your
Commodore for the low-down
on this.
Showtime
Everybody loves a show and the
7th PCW show was certainly no
exception a s  thousands o f
computer moguls, journalists,
games freaks and would-be
programmers trudged through
the corridors o f  Olympia 2
from 191h-23rd September.
With w inter already w e l l
underway and Christmas on
the horizon, the time is ripe
and the market ready for new
i(i11411/1ENT
releases — all too evident with
the hoards of offerings from
software houses up and down
the country. Wares displayed
included riot only the new
Commodore machines but a
tide of  software, books and
peripherals such as Currah's
Speech 64.

second installment of our two-
part MIDI series and we also
hope to set your ﬁngers tap-

with a  guide t o  two soft-
ware packages —  MusiCalc

transform your Commodore
into a  music synthesiser.

Reader input
But, as much as w e pester
software houses in pursuit of
the latest releases for exposure
by our reviewers, toil as we may
over our trusty typewriters to
bring y o u  e ru d i t e  a n d
entertaining articles, where
would we be without you. our
readers? We  anxiously await
your praise and criticism, your
comments and ideas. Are we
catering for your needs? Are
there too many games —or riot
enough? Is the general tone
too s e ri o u s  —  o r  t o o
lighthearted? We' re quite
amiable here — so drop us a
line or give us a call. Praise or
abuse us — we don't mind so
long as you get your views
across. Thank you to everyone
who has already put pen to
paper: we shall endeavour to
answer all your letters.
Your comments reveal a
world o f  frustrated VIC 20
owners. We want to fulﬁl your
needs — but our supplies are
low. So, how better to pass
those long winter nights than
by retiring to a warm corner
and conjuring up weird and
wonderful games and utilities
on your VIC 20. And, of course,
we don' t expect y o u  64
'programmers extraordinaires
to be sitting idle either. Get
tapping and share your genius
with us humbler mortals! Send

two machines, along with the
64, will "...form the strongest
range on the market over the

The Commodore Plus/4 is
described by Mr. Stanworth as
"_..an affordable home com-
puter f or  the more serious
user". And, in an attempt to
prove this point, it comes with 4
integral programs: word pro-
cessing, database, spreadsheet
and business graphics. But he
does stress that the Plus/4 "...is
not a  fully-ﬂedged business
machine_ It is a competitively-
priced home machine ideally
suited to the professional who
wants to use it for productive
applications". T h e  Plus /4
contains 64K RAM, of which
60K is available to the user for
BASIC programs and includes,
amongst t h e  m o r e  o b vio u s
facilities, advanced BASIC,
screen window facility, a HELP
key and simple cursor controls.
It retails at £299.99.
Both machines are being
manufactured a t  t h e  n e w
Commodore factory in Corby
and should be available at the
end of September.
Father Commodore also
promises to stuff our Christmas
stockings with other goodies. A
new cassette deck, the 1531

Who would have thought it?
David Darling (18) and his
brother Richard 116) always
seemed such ordinary young
men b u t  t h e n  unexpected
things started happening
round them. It all began at the
beginning of 1981 in  Canada
when they acquired a VIC-20.
From that moment o n  they
found they had a talent, an
unexplained power, call it what
you will, which they have been
attempting t o  harness ev er
since. A t  ﬁrs t i t  was  jus t
ordinary sprites they called up
but more recently those sprites
have been transforming them-
selves into a complete demon-
iacal hierarchy: ghosts, ghouls,
zombies and poltergeists. The
source of this power has been
traced to their Commodore 64.
Surprisingly, nobody seems
to be at all concerned. Rather
the opposite for the Darling
brothers are in fact the authors

anything t o  avoid the irate

previous manager.

Dear Sir,
Al! those Commodore 64 users
who cannot get their voice two
to wor k , d o n ' t  t a k e  t h e

There is nothing wrong with it;
the manual is wrong. On page

is 54283 a n d  n o t  54288.
Here's another tip for you
64 users. P0KE56325,X (X1 to

After a quick look I promptly
bought and raced home t o
look at it; as a VIC 20 owner
myself I bought it to seek out
new talents. The reason it is so
different is  because all the
other Commodore magazines
focus mainly on one thing: the
CBM64. Most of the programs,

are o n  t h i s  mac hine.
congratulate you on seeing the
light for us poor VIC and PET

Mr. Williams' 'en de coeur'?
A I M
-
Dear Sir,
I own a Commodore 64 and
have rec ently  bought t h e
'PETS PEED' c ompiler . T his
gingers up some of my ordinary
BASIC programs but I cannot
make i t  work  o n  even the
simplest High-Res program
such as those t o  clear the
screen and draw a circle. My
BASIC pr ogr am i s  t a k e n
straiett out of  the 'Program-
mer s' Reference Guide' (pages
122-123 and 126-127) and runs
perfectly (though appallingly
slowly). I  have added a very
simple machine code program
which clears the screen and
puts  i t  i n t o  H i g h - R e s
instantaneously, but of course
thereafter the drawing is as
slow as ever, The PETSPEED
will not run this either; but, if I
include a  command i n  t he
PETSPEED program to load the
machine code program from
disc, the screen does clear -
and nothing else happens. It
refuses to carry on drawing the
ﬁgure and the screen remains
blank until I  hit RUN/STOP
RESTORE. I n  every case, the
compiling seems to be error-
free, but the result doesn't run.
The base for the 'bit-map'
memory is  8192, Since t he
compiled program seems t o
occupy about 8450 bytes (most
of whic h is . 1 believe, the
PETSPEED interpreter), I have
tried altering the base to 10240
or even beyond, so as not to
interfere. The effects o f  this
are, ﬁrstly, that only the lower
two thirds o f  the screen are
cleared and the top third after
the ﬁnal 'paint' is covered in
vertical bars; and, secondly,
although the circle gets drawn,
its c ent r e i s  v e r y  m u c h
displaced (though this can be
remedied b y  changing t w o
constants in the program). This
program compiles alright too,
but won't run either (in the
compiled version),
attach copies of the two
programs. As you can see, they
are very short and simple.
Can you offer any advice?
Where am I going wrong? And
where c a n  I  ﬁn d  s ome
literature more explicit and less
superﬁcial than the 'Reference
Guide'?
Yours faithfully,
M.W. Peters,

Instructions and
Addressing modes in
the third part of this
series on machine
code.
d i
ONE COMPLETE ORDER TO
the microprocessor is called an
instruction. The 6510A has a
rep ert o ire, c a l l e d  t h e
instruction Set, of almost 60
different types but, because
most of them are available in
several different forms, the
total number of permutations
rises to several hundred. Such a
huge number to choose from
can b e  frightening t o  t h e
newcomer. Because of this, we
feel that presenting the full
repertoire at this stage would
be m o re  confusing t h an
helpful. Fortunately, only a
relatively small proportion of
the total number are in regular
use. In fact, it is possible to
begin w rit in g  w o rkab le
machine code programs by
restricting the repertoire t o
twenty or so instructions.
The instruction format
A machine code instruction
represents one complete order
to t h e microprocessor and
normally consists o f  t w o
"
has a verb but no noun so is
incomplete. T h e r e  a r e
normally t w o  parts o f  a
machine code instruction, the
operation co d e an d  t h e
operand.
The operation code
This corresponds to the verb
because i t  tells the micro-
processor w h at  particular
action is required. In general,
the o p - co d e c a n  b e  a
decimal number, a pair of hex
digits o r ,  i f  you have a n
assembler, a three-letter group
known a s  a n  instruction
mnemonic. Every instruction
has a unique code number.
Unless you have additional
software aids, the only way to
enter a n  op-code o n  t h e
Commodore 64 is by POKing a
decimal number. This is an
awful m e t h o d  b ecau se
decimals and machine code are
alien to each other. Machine
code programming is not the
easiest of subjects and if we
have t o  w ork entirely i n
decimal op-codes, t h e task
distinct parts as shown in Figure
3.1
As in everyday speech, any
order given to a person consists
of two parts, the verb (what
particular action is required)
and the noun (which particular
object is to receive the action).
For example, suppose w e
instruct someone to 'kick'. The
person is confused because,
although h e knows how t o
kick, h e has not been told
which particular individual or
object requires kicking. I n
other words, the instruction
MASTERING
MACHINE CODE
borders on the horriﬁc. We
shall n o t  attempt t o  u se
decimal op-codes at all. As
mentioned in Part 1 of  this
series, if you intend to take
machine code programming
seriously, you a r e  strongly
advised t o  get hold o f  an
assembler as soon as you can.
However, for the beneﬁt of
readers who feel that the extra
expense i s n o t  justiﬁed, a
simple program will be given
later, enabling all machine
code programs to be entered in
hex instead of decimal digits.
The operand
This is the second part of the
instruction, corresponding to
the noun. I t  informs t h e
microprocessor where the data
(to b e acted upon) can b e
found. The operand, in most
cases, will be the address of the
data. There are, however,
several different ways o f
specifying the address. They
are kn o w n  a s  addressing
modes. Some instructions may
have as many as seven different
addressing modes, whilst
others may have only one. The
operand can be speciﬁed in
decimal or hex but, here again,
hex addresses are much easier
to work with.
Simple addressing
modes
The most commonly used
instruction in the repertoire is
[ DA so w e shall use it for
illustration purposes where
ever possible. L D A  i s  a n
assembler mnemonic f o r
LoaD Accumulator. It is used to
place data into the accum-
ulator. The whereabouts of the
data is speciﬁed by the operand
according t o  the addressing
mode used. At this point, only
three o f  these addressing
modes will be described.
Immediate addressing
Memory i s  n o t  involved
because the operand speciﬁes
the data. This data will b e
speciﬁed by two hex digits (one
byte) within the range 00 and
FF.
Suppose we want to load
the accumulator with the hex
number 05 and we have an
assembler resident. The way in
which the instruction is written
depends o n  w het her a n
assembler is used or whether
you must use direct hex code.
Both forms are given below:
Assembler H e x  code
LDA *S05 A 9  05
=  
I
Notice that t h e  assembler
requires the character '$' to
indicate the number is in hex
and t h e  character ' 4* ' t o
indicate immediate addressing.
In contrast, t h e h ex code
version is just two pairs of
naked hex digits. The ﬁrst pair
of hex digits is always the op-
code. The op-code for LDA,
using immediate addressing, is
A9. Wh y  A9? Because t h e
designers of the 6510A decreed
it t o  b e  so . Without a n
assembler, you must either
memorise the hex digit pair for
every op-code (and there are
over 200 of them) or consult the
full instruction set of the 6510A.
Perhaps this gloomy bit o f
information w ill act  a s a
commercial break f o r t h e
Mikro  o r  C o m m o d o r e
assembler. I t  i s  c a l l e d
immediate addressing because
the d at a i s  immediately
available in the operand. It is
used when we want to load
constants.
Absolute addressing
This is used if the data byte, to
be loaded into the accum-
ulator, i s  i n  memory —
anywhere in the 64K RAM. The
operand is a four hex digit
number (two bytes) specifying
the memory address. You will
remember that any address in
the 64K memory map can be
expressed with the aid of four
hex digits. Suppose we wish to
load the data byte, residing at
address C2056 hex, into the
accumulator. T h e assembler
and h e x  co d e instruction
become:
Assembler H ex code
LDA $2056 A D  56 20
Notice that the hex op-code is
now AD instead of A9. Notice
also the strange reversal of the
two operand bytes in the hex
code version. This is a standard
rule when using 6510A hex
code s o  w e  h ad  b et t er
emphasise it:
9

P r o g r a m m i n g
If direct hex  code is  used
without an assembler, all two-
byte operand addresses must
be entered in reverse order,
low-byte ﬁrst, high byte last,
This is important enough to
justify an extra example; the
hex address 5472 mus t b e
entered as 72 54. The designers
of the 6510A decided on this
awkward twist because it led to
more efﬁcient organisation of
the address bus. In machine
code, the human is relatively
unimportant so considerations
of 'us er  friendliness' tak e
second plac e t o  hardware
efﬁciency. As can be seen in
the e x a m p le  a b o v e ,  a n
assembler is  a  little k inder
towards humans and the two
operand bytes are entered in
normal sequence.
Zero-page addressing
If the address of the required
data happens to be on page
zero ($0000 t o  $0011) i t  is
possible, in fact it is normally
desirable, t o  use page zero
addressing. It is more efﬁcient
because the two leading zeros
can be dropped, allowing a
single byte operand to be used.
For example, t o  load t h e
accumulator with the contents
of the hex  address 35, the
assembler a n d  h e x  c o d e
instructions would be:
Assembler H ex  code
IDA $35 A 5  35
We shall see later that page
zero is very important because
(a) t w o o f  the more exotic
addressing modes only operate
on data resident in page zero.
(b) data retrieval is faster from
page zero than fr om other
areas of memory.
Unfortunately, mos t o f
page zero has already been
swiped b y  t h e  r e s id e n t
operating system so there are
very f e w  v ac ant address
locations left for the machine
code programmer. In view of
this, those which are left should
be given VIP status and not
used wastefully. We believe,
although w e  c an ﬁn d  n o
conﬁrmation in  Commodore
literature, that:
Free locations in page zero =
SFB to SIF inclusive.
Indexed and indirect
addressing
These addressing modes are
not so easy to understand and
will be discussed in detail later
No- 11=
in this series. However, for the
sake o f  completeness, brief
deﬁnitions are given below
but, if you are completely new
to machine code, don't worry
too much about them yet.
Indexed addressing
with LDA
The contents of  one of  the
index registers is automatically
added to the operand and the
result is  the address o f  the
required data byte. Thus the
same instruction can be used to
access different addresses by
simply altering the contents of
the index register. There are
three possible forms:
(a) Zero-page indexed, where
only the X register can be used
(b) Absolute indexed, where
either the X or Y registers can
be used. Assembler and hex
code formats, using arbitrary
addresses, are as follows:
Address type
Zero-page,X
Absolute,X
Absolute,Y
Note the comma is used to
inform t h e  assembler that
indexed addressing is required.
Indexed i n d i r e c t
addressing
An indirect address is  t h e
address
not s o  b a d  a s  i t  sounds
providing we ﬁrst neglect the
indexing by assuming that X (or
Y as appropriate) contai
The operand is the low-byte
address (which must be in page
zero) o f  a two byte address
pointer. The high byte of the
pointer is in the next sequential
location. A s  a  preliminary
example, using standard
assembler notation, assume we
write IDA ($F13,X). Assume that
address $FB contains $56 (the
low-byte of the pointer) and
the n e x t  h ig h e r  address
contains SCO (the high-byte of
the pointer). The effect of the
instruction i s  t o  load t h e
accumulator with the contents
of address $CO56. However,
things are a little more complex
when the effect of the index
r egis ter  i s  t a k e n  i n t o
consideration. Suppos e X
contains the number 2 and we
again write ID A (SFEI,X). The
low-byte address i s  n o w
increased t o  $Ff3+2=SF so an
entirely different pointer is
effective.
The advantage is ﬂexibility.
The same instruction can be
used to access different data
items simply by varying either
the address pointers or the
index register. Assembly
format and hex coding, using
arbitrary addresses, i s  as
follows:
Assembler H e x  code
LDA ($F13,X) Al FB
Indirect i n d e x e d
addressing
This i s  similar i n  general
principle to indexed indirect,
The essential difference being
in the way indexing is used.
Firstly, only Y can be used for
index ing. Sec ondly , t h e
contents of Y is added to the
address pointer, rather than to
the operand. A n  ex ample
should illustrate the difference.

format f o r  indirect indexed
addressing, suppose we write
LDA ($F13),Y and that Y contains
2. let us also assume, as before,
that address $F13 contains $56
(the low-byte pointer) and the
next address contains KO  (the
high-byte pointer). Because 2 is
now added t o  t he address
pointer, it effectively becomes
$CO56+24CO58. The assem-
bler and hex  coding, using
arbitrary addresses, for indirect
indexed is as follows:
Assembler H ex  coding
LDA ( M Y  B1 FB
Indirect indexed addressing is
used much more often than
.
easy it is to get mixed up with
the position of the assembler
brackets. Lets  p u t  t h e m
together t o  emphasise t h e
difference.

It is worth mentioning that the
older terms were as follows:
Indexed indirect was called
post indexing (because t h e
index was added afterwards).
Indirect indexed was called
pre-indexed (because t h e
index was added ﬁrst).
How t o  e n t e r  a
machine code program
Up to this point, we have only
used the instruction LDA to
illustrate the technicalities of
machine code and readers may
be wonder ing h o w  muc h
longer they must wait before
the rest of them are discussed.
The trouble with machine code
is that the various addressing
modes are far more difﬁcult to
understand than differences
between t h e  ins truc tions
themselves. We have tackled
the hardest part ﬁrst. As we
subsequently treat the other
instructions, short program
segments w ill b e  giv en t o
illustrate t h e  behaviour o f
each. However, before we go
any further, we must know how
to enter  a  machine c ode
program and afterwards, how
to run it. We shall assume in the
ﬁrst instance that you do not
have an assembler. Program 3.1
is a  simple way t o  enter a
program into the safe area of
memory w hic h, y o u  m a y
remember from Part 1 of the
series, is the 4K block starting at
address $C000.
The program, written in BASIC,
allows y o u  t o  ent er  h e x
machine code bytes in the form
of D AT A statements. Y o u
should key in the program and
save it on tape or disc for use
whenever you want t o load
machine code. The hex bytes
shown are, of course, only an
example so, once you have
tried it out once, there is no
need to save lines 140 to 180.
When y o u  load y our  ow n
programs, o r  some o f  t h e
examples which will appear
throughout the series, you will
have to enter the bytes in the
form s hown i n  lines  140
onwards. O n c e  y o u  hav e
entered t h e  bytes and t he
BASIC program run, you will be
asked, via a screen message,
the number of bytes used, In
the example, there are 33 bytes.
Once you have entered the
number of bytes, the program
will place them in  memory
starting at $C000. It will be up to
you to ensure that the DATA
bytes, which we shall refer to in
future as a 'hex dump', are
entered i n  t h e  c o r r e c t
sequence. You will notice that
the data bytes in the example
are placed in groups of eight.
This is for convenience (they
are easy to count up if you stick
to this  number) a n d  als o
because i t  is  customary i n
machine c ode monitors t o
display the bytes in groups of
eight.

Program 3.1 Poking a hex dump
into memory
Running a  m achi ne
code program
Program 3.1 is purely a loading
program. When you run it, it
merely loads the machine code
into memory —  it does not
execute the machine code! To
execute the code, you should
now enter
SYS 49152
This directs the computer to
start executing the bytes, one
after the other, starting at the
decimal address 49152. This is,
of course, SC000. If you have
entered Program 3.1 a s  i t
stands, including the example
33 bytes, you should conﬁrm
that the machine code, when
run under  SYS 49152, w ill
completely ﬁll the screen with
'H' characters. In fact, 1024 of
them are displayed but the last
24 w ill naturally cause t he
screen to scroll. Don't worry at
this stage about h o w  t h e
machine code works. If you are
a c omplete newc omer, i t
would be very surprising if you
could since several tricks have
been used which have not yet
been explained. You should
notice however that the last
byte is hex 60 which is the
1 m a c h i n e  c ode v ers ion o f
20 R  EoTsLit ofN
in 60 in 
o
r
re-entry t o  BASIC command
level once the machine code
program has stopped.
The ex ample pr ogr am
works directly you run it but
some machine code programs
require some extra data before
they can be run. In such cases,
it will be up to you to POKE
such data in t o  t h e  correct
memory loc ations  b e f o r e
entering SYS 49152. It should be
mentioned here that it is not
mandatory to always load at the
start o f  t h e  machine c ode
block. After all, there is 4K
available so there is nothing to
stop you loading your program
in the friiddle o f  the block.
However, there is no point in
being original just for its own
sake. If you get into the habit of
loading a t  $C000 onwards,
there is less chance of making a
mistake. I t  also allows y ou
plenty of room at the end of the
program to store any extra data
required.
LDX and W Y
These load the contents of the
chosen index register with data
deﬁned by the operand.
STX and STY
These store the contents of the
chosen index register in the
memory address deﬁned b y
the operand.
STA
This stores the contents of the
accumulator in memory at the
address d e ﬁn e d  b y  t h e
operand.
The addressing modes
available, t o g e t h e r  w i t h
assembler and hex coding are
given in  the following table
using xx to represent a single
operand byte:
From w h a t  has  been s aid
already, it should be possible to
ﬁgure out the name of each
addressing mode in this table
by s imply  ex amining t h e
assembler format. Notice that
some instructions hav e a
limited addressing repertoire.
For example, y ou can't use
indirect addressing with LDX or
LDY. On the other hand, STA
has as many addressing modes
as IDA with the exception of
the imme d ia t e  m o d e .  A
moment's thought s hould
convince y o u  t h a t  i t  i s
impossible to have immediate
mode w it h  any  store-type
instruction. There is only one
operand so you can't express
both the data and where to put
it in one single instruction.
Exercises
To conclude Part 3, here are
some exercises which should
help you to become familiar
with some of the more simple
addressing modes. Write each
program, enter it with the aid
of the loader (Program 3.1), run
it under SYS 49152 and see if it
behaves:
1. Display a character of your
own choice in the middle of
the screen.
2. D is play  t w o  dif f er ent
characters, side by side, in the
middle of the screen.
3. Display your name across the
bottom of the screen.

this series, Bryn
Phillips invites you to
irritate the neighbours
by adding sound to
your VIC games.
THIS IS THE THIRD OF A FIVE
part series o f  BASIC Games
Programming for  the VIC20.
The series is primarily intended
for newcomers t o  games
programming, but there might
well be a few useful tips for
seasoned programmers.
So far we've looked at two
of the main elements of Games
Programming on the VIC 20 —
screen layout and movement.
Even without sound you can
write some good games. In fact
some games are better with the
minimum o f  s o u n d  —
especially thinking games — it
can be a distraction. However
for m o s t  a c t i o n  g a m e s
imaginative use of sound can
make all the difference. As a
VIC owner y ou have a  big
advantage in this area, because
the sound comes through the
T.V. speaker, giving you lots of
volume. You're not limited to
the odd pathetic bleep or click,
either — you have an amazing
variety of sound effecs to draw
on.
Tuning into the VIC
The VI C  h a s  ﬁv e  s ound
registers, four for  tone, and
one for volume. As with most
things on the VIC you have to
POKE v alues  i n t o  t h e s e
registers, w hic h hav e t h e
following memory locations:
P r o g r a m m i n g

or where there is a distinct
pause in the action. This would
occur w h e n  s o m e t h i n g
spectacular happens , f o r
example an explosion, a ship
sinking, o r  a  bonus  score
message. Here you can usually
put the sound in as a discreet
package in  a  subroutine, I t
makes for neat programming,
and allows you to come up with
some sophisticated effects.
Sometimes you might want to
play a few bars of a tune. This is
easily done by going to a sub-
routine along the lines shown
in ﬁg(i).

20 FORI=1T010
30 POKES,N(I)
40 FOR 1=1 TO 200: NEXT

60 POKEV,0:POKES,0
ﬁg (i)
Where V is the volume register.
5 is a sound register, and the
array N(I) contains the notes of
the tune, which y ou deﬁne
earlier -
sounds a bit ﬂat though, and
you can make it more interest-
ing by enveloping the sound to
give differ ent effects. T he
simplest is the piano effect, and
this is done by decaying the
volume as outlined in ﬁg (ii).

Hitting the right note
All you need to do now is to
ﬁnd some notes to give you a
tune. Rather than constantly
refer to the table of note values
in the User's Manual, it's far
easier to use a utility program
to help you compose the tunes.
The utility  program, CO M-
POSER (Listing 1), allows you to
compose short tunes (20 notes
max), and provides you with
the values to include in the data
statements i n your program.
A M I N
t's very easy to use; you just
use the bottom row of keys on
the keyboard as  t h e  white
notes, and the second row of
keys as the black notes. Any
other keys will give you a single
note pause. You c an easily
change the tune using delete.
and play it back at any time
using 17. This  program is
deliberately simple. Without
too muc h effort y ou c ould
convert your VIC into a neat
little sound synthesiser, with
chords, drums, and melody
lines. But that would be getting
away fr om Games Program-
ming —  i t  w ould us e u p
valuable memory, and we need
that for other things.
Effecting sound
Now let's get on to the sound
effects. Probably one of the
ﬁrst things you did when you
acquired your VIC 20 was to
type in  some o f  the sound
effects a t  t h e  back o f  t h e
manual. Some of them are very
good, and they crop up from
time to time in programs here
and there. It's  tempting t o
leave it at that — as I said some
of them are very good. Unfor-
tunately they're not original —
they w er e thought u p  b y
someone else. If you're writing
your own programs you want
your own sound effects which
exactly ﬁt your theme: whether
it's duc k s  quacking, tyres
screeching, or aliens scream-
ing, it's up to you.
Most simple sound effects
are generated by nested loops.
Fig (iii) shows the two simplest
loops.
10 FOR I = 1 TO RP
20 FORNT = Ni TO N2 STEP SN
30 FOR V =V1 TO V2 STEP SV
40 POKE VL,V
50 POKE S,NT
60 NEXTV
70 FOR I = 1 TO 100*PS:NEXT I
80 NEXT NT
90 NEXT
100 POKE V,O:POKE S,0

effectively in Games Program-
ming i t  mus t b e  carefully
planned, and not just slotted in
somewhere at the end of the
program as an afterthought.
There are two ways of using
sound. I t  can b e put in in
discreet packages, or carefully
integrated into the program
structure.
One of the most valuable
uses of sound in a program is to
add interest o r  excitement
either when there is no action,
for example the introduction,

Loop 1 the volume loop is
nested within the tone loop,
and in Loop 2 the tone loop is
nested w it hin t h e  v olume
loop. Loop 1 can be used to
give some pleasant musical
effects, a n d  l o o p  2  really
comes into its own for those

have all learned t o love (or
hate?). If you type in the utility
program "MANIAC SYNTHE-
SISER" (Listing 2), you can play
with these loops to your heart's
content, and when you get an
effect you like just copy down
the values for inclusion into the
loops given in ﬁg (iii). I've made
up a table of some values you
might like to try when you start
off, but whether you agree with
my descriptions o f  thes e
sounds is another matter!
When you type in the program
it's important to make sure you
get the screen formatting right,
but otherwise there should be
no problems. Loops 1 and 2
have been included i n  this
program as subroutines, and if
you follow the listing through
you will see that it's quite easy
to add your own customised
loops  i f  y o u  w a n t  t o
experiment further.
Integrating sound
Earlier in this article I  men-
tioned Integrated Sound. The
only problem o f  going to a
subroutine each time you want
to hear something is that it
slows down the action. Even
worse, it can make the whole
thing jerky if the sound only

occurs occasionally. In order to
avoid this you have to integrate
your sound effect into the
structure of the program. This
can take some thinking about,
and will vary from program to
program. The trick is to ﬁnd
natural delays in your program
structure, a n d  nev er  u s e

hold a note. You have to ﬁrst
write y our  program, t h e n
sketch out your sound efect
sub-program and merge the
two. The speed of the action
should not change when the
sound effect occurs — you will
just get a slight reduction in the
overall s peed. T h e  m o r e
complex the effect the greater
the reduction. The answer is
not to go overboard with the
integrated s ound effects —
keep them simple. You can
save the sound extravaganza
for the triumphs and disasters,
as you savour the moment of
victory, of ﬂounder in defeat.
The difference between
Integrated Sound and the use
of subroutines is  shown in
Listing 3 and Listing 4. Back to

programs a  b a ll bounc es
around the screen, and bleeps
each time it hits the edge. In
BOUNCE A the program goes
to a subroutine to generate the
sound, and in BOUNCE B the
sound is integrated. It's a very
simple example, b u t  i f  y ou
RUN the two programs you
should notice the difference.
So far we've been talking
about aliens, frogs, rockets etc,
and all we've got is the VIC's
standard graphic set. If you've
got a lot of imagination you are
probably quite happy with that
— but it does take a lot. A
square falling from a rectangle
can be interpreted as a bomb
falling from a plane, but a bit of
realism would bring it all to life.
That's what I'll be covering in
the next article in this series. It's

it looks lik e a  negative —

so easy to make an adaptor for

there will be a roaring trade in
adaptors. There is  also one
other problem with joysticks:
on the box they are labelled
'PORT 0' and 'PORT l': BASIC
thinks they are 'JOY (1)' and
'JOY (2)' —  the mysterious

really matter with the C16 as a

with the computer.
COMMODORE'S
LATEST
NUMBER
Thankfully, Commodore
have left the Serial BUS and the
audio/video connector alone.
Since all Commodore's existing
peripherals which use these
ports will work straight off,
there are already printers and
disc drives available for the
machine: this  is  a  welcome
change from the usual state of
affairs where the user has to
wait up to two years for any
peripherals at all.
The •
Commodore's usual excellent
standards a n d  p r o b a b ly
represents m o s t  o f  t h e
c omponent c o s t  o f  t h e
machine (it did on the CBM64
and VIC). Changes made from
the VIC/64 keyboard include
four separate cursor keys, an
escape k e y ,  a n d  v ar ious
modiﬁcations to the layout of
the keys t o  facilitate these
changes. The cursor keys are
now on the top right of the
keyboard. This is confusing to a
user who is experienced with
the Commodore keyboard of
old, but it is extremely logical
and easy to get used to for the
ﬁrst time user.
Inside the C16
The internal hardware reveals
some surprises. Most of  the
inside is driven via one big
chip: called either the 7501 or
the TED chip depending on
your inclination, it combines a
6510 processor at 2MHz with a
sound gener ator . timer s ,
i n p u t / o u t p u t ,  m e m o r y
bank ing, a n d  g r a p h ic s
generation. I n  all i t  has 19
registers to control things (in
order of graphics ability: the
Spectrum has 1, MSX has 6, the
BBC has 17, the Commodore 64
has 47).
Sound ability is as good as
any other computer although it
only has two channels —either
two sound channels or  one
sound a n d  o n e  noise ( for
special effects). Nearly all the
advanced sound features of the
SID chip have been left out like
ADSR, ﬁltering, and mod-
ulation,
Graphics ability is superb. It
is natural that this and the Plus 4
will b e  compared w ith t h e
Commodore 64 as there are a
lot of similarities in spec; the
graphics ar e different and
there are currently two schools
of thought as to which is better,
the CBM64 or the C16
No sprites...
The big difference lies with
sprites. These wonderful things
that make games programming
easy have been chopped from
the C16. In their place is a
software simulation o f  them
from BASIC where you can
extract an area of the screen
and store it in a string. This
string can then be recalled and
put back on the screen at any
point. There are also other
options t o manipulate these
objects, but they are not true
sprites; a large 120 byte object
takes about a  quarter o f  a
second to write to the screen, I
feel that the world can live
without sprites f o r  a t  least
another computer generation
(about 1 8  mont hs ) ; t h e
Commodore 64 and Atari were
just too far ahead of their time.
...But more colour
The trade-off against the sprites
is more colour. The screen of
the C16 can have 128 colours
(121 excluding black) made up
of 16 colours, B  luminence
levels, and ﬂashing. Screen size
is 40 x 25 text with four other
graphics modes. T he other
graphics modes are 320 x 200
with the previously mentioned
128 colours being used in a
colour map system, and 160 x
200 in a multicolour form. Both
hi-res screens have an option
to leave four text lines at the
bottom of the screen. There are
some other graphics modes
and options but these are only
available by  POKEing. UDGs
are obtained by POKEing and
manipulation of registers.
The manual gives no hint of
these although they are very
straightforward t o  obtain.
When playing with UDGs one
other  f e a t u r e  b e c o m e s
apparent. A  character gen-
erator is 2K long (256 x 8 bytes),
the C16 one is only 1K long.
How come? Well, the long and
short of it is that the C16 uses a
hardware r e v e r s e  ﬁe l d
attribute. The top bit of the
current character displayed
indicates whether it is inverted
or not. The advantage of this
lies in memory consumption.
The disadvantages are that you
can only have 128 UDGs, and
ﬂashing works i n  a  rather
strange way. A  reverse ﬁeld
space is shown as a  black
square; when you ﬂash i t
instead o f  getting a  ﬂashing
square nothing happens. This is

There may  b e  others but,

Programming the C16
While investigating the ROM
in the machine I came across a
strange quirk. Before getting
the manual, I was PEEKing the
top end of ROM to discover
the BASIC keywords. Doing
this produced garbage and not
the codes that I was expecting.
L
However, entering the monitor
and interrogating -memory
revealed them: all the memory
paging systems of the Plus 4
have been left in, so when you
try to PEEK the ROM the BASIC
pages it out to allow access to
the R A M  beneath. This is
alright in a 64K Plus 4 but in a
16K C16 there is no memory
there — just garbage.
This brings me onto another
point. The BASIC (covered in
the latter half of this article) is
ideal for an inexperienced user
or an experienced BASIC user,
but what about us machine
code hacks and people that
wouldn't use BASIC i f  they
were paid to?

BASIC on the 16
Commodore BASIC has been
around in one form or another
since the early PET in the mid
70's; little has happened to it
since then. In the outside world
fancy, structured BASICS have
been the order of the day. BBC
and Q L  BASIC ar e s o far
removed f r o m  t h e  original
Dartmouth BASIC that they can
hardly be called BASIC at all.
The Commodore 16 is the ﬁrst
major departure f r o m  t h e
standard Commodore BASIC.
The 64 and VIC use BASIC 2.0,
the business machines us e
BASIC 4.0, The Commodore
16's BASIC 3.5 does not really
fall between the two but goes
bey ond B A S I C  4 . 0 .  I t

features of BASIC 4.0 and adds

BASIC 3.5 but is present in
BASIC 4 . 0  i s  RECO RD.
RECORD aids the accessing of
data in a random access ﬁle;
this omission is a shame be-
cause random access ﬁles open
-
up (no pun intended) great
scope for business program-
ming. They can still be imple-
mented but sending bytes off
one a t  a  t im e  is  a  little
laborious.
There ar e lots  o f  n e w
commands in BASIC 3.5, some
replace the POKEing required
on the Commodore 64 and
some add extra functions. They
divide u p  i n t o  ﬁv e m a in
sections: structure, toolkit, disc
handling, graphics and sound.
Structure
The IE..THEN structure has
ﬁnally sprouted an ELSE tag.
Most Commodore program-
mers fail iosee the value of this,
after all you can always put the
next s t a t e m e n t  o n  t h e
following line. Wher e ELSE
really comes into its own is in
conjunction with a  GOSUB.
Consider this routine:
10 IF Z  =1 THEN GOSUB 100
ELSE GOSUB 200
20 PRINT "BACK FROM THE
ROUTINE"
Without the ELSE it would have
to look like this
10 IF Z=1 THEN GOSUB 100
15 IF Z<>1 THEN GOSUB 200
20 PRINT "BACK FROM THE
ROUTINE"
Without the test in line 15 the
program would always get to
200. The ELSE function is a very
valuable addition t o  C om-
modore BASIC.
Brand new structures are
'

H a r d w a r e  R e v i e w
The toolkit for the old PETs
had a great TRACE function.
This gave the line that was
being executed and the last few
lines above that in a window.
The C16 just prints out the line
being executed at the current
print position. This means that
the screen gets cluttered with a
load o f  lin e  numbers and
cannot see what is supposed to
be going on. It is switched on
with I R O N  a n d  o f f  w it h
TROFF.
Disc handling
BASIC 4.0 programmers will be
familiar w i t h  a l l  t h e s e
commands.
BACKUP provides a  fast
backup between drives on a
dual drive unit. The only way of
using this is with a 4040/8050
type drive and an interpod
since the 1542 is only a single
drive. There may be a dual
drive in the pipeline; one was
pictured i n  Commodore's
report to shareholders.
DIRECTORY shows t h e
contents o f  a  disc without
destroying any BASIC program
in memory . T her e i s  n o
CATALOG command as used
in BASIC 4.0.
DLOAD and DSAVE load
and save ﬁles from and to disc.
HEADER formats a new disc;
there are two ways of doing
this, a  f u ll HEADER whic h
formats the whole disc and a
quick HEADER whic h jus t
formats over the directory on a
disc which has already been
used. The former is probably
safer since it ensures the whole
disc is safe to use and there are
no bad sectors. RENAME does
just that; it allows the name of a
ﬁle to be changed on the disc,
ideal for archiving a ﬁle you are
working on.
COPY is slower than backup
for copying a whole disc and
does not format the disc it is
copying onto but will copy one
or a selection of ﬁles.
Overall, the disc handling
commands are a very useful
addition f o r  disc users b u t
how many people will spend
1230 on a disc drive for a £140
computer remains to be seen.
Graphics
By far the greatest improve-
ments in Commodore BASIC
have occurred in the ﬁeld of
graphic commands. The use of
high resolution graphics really
clobbers the memory, in high
res mode the user is left with 2K
to work with. Clever machine
code could eek this out but
most users will want t o use
BASIC.
The non-high r es  c om-
mand i s  C O LO U R . T h is
replaces all the messy POKEing.
There are three parameters to
this command:
type, colour and brightness.
The type is a number between 0
and 4:
0 — Background
1 — Character (INK)
2 — multi colour 1
3 — multi colour 2
4 — border
To use the high resolution
graphics there is the GRAPHIC
command. This allows for two
modes, a  320 by  200 mode
where the colour resolution is
limited to two colours per 64
pixels and a multi colour mode
which allows four colours per
64 pixels. There is an option to
L k
=
clear the graphic mode as you
enter it. The graphicscreen can
be cleared with the SCNCLR
c ommand. T h e  D R A W
command w i l l  either  dr aw
from the last point or from and
to a speciﬁed point. The colour
can be given for each line. One
of the major problems with a
graphics screen is the difﬁculty
of printing text to it. Drawing
out a whole word can be very
laborious. The C16 has two
ways of overcoming this. The
ﬁrst is a text window at the
bottom of the screen which can
be printed to and which scrolls
in the normal way. The second
is the CHAR command. This
either writes or erases a given
string at a speciﬁed position; it
is slow but allows the string to
be put anywhere on the
graphics screen. The BOX com-
mand is a fast alternative to
using four draw commands. It
is possible to produce a ﬁlled or
rotated b o x .  T h e  CIRCLE
command is a little slow but
makes u p  f o r  that i n  it s
ﬂexibility; it  can be used to
draw any  polygon o r  oval.
Colour ﬁll is quite difﬁcult to
write but this is no problem on
the C16 which has a PAINT
instruction. The 121 colours
make the C16 a very pretty
machine.
An attempt to mimic sprites
has been made by the inclusion
of the commands GSHAPE and
SSHAPE, These suck graphics
from the screen into a string
which can then be squirted
back onto a different part of
the screen. There are ﬂags for
different logic al operations
which can be used to produce
different effects w hen r e -
printing the software sprite.
Sound
Sound on the C16 is a doddle
when compared to the 64. This
is partly due to the new BASIC
commands and partly due to
the lack of facilities. There are
only two commands. VOL and
SOUND. There are two musical
voices and one noise channel.
The parameters for SOUNDare
the voice number, the note and
the duration. It won't be long
before we start to learn the
standard zapping sounds.
Final points
The manual is excellent and
way past Commodore's usual
standard. It is informative and
instructional for the ﬁrst time
user. F o r  t h e  experienced
person there are memory maps
and register details.
At only 16K the C16 looks a
bit on the slim side, especially
as the system cust out 4K for the
operating system and screen.
This leaves you with 12K for
programs. This is not too bad
considering that Commodore
machines are very frugal with
memory consumption.
Finally , a n o t h e r  1  OK
disappears when using hi-res
graphics, thus leaving only 2K
for the user. Through clever
programming, an extra 2K can
be extracted from the machine
making a grand total of 4K11l •
All we can hope for is that
memory ex pans ion u n it s
become available as soon as
pos s ible, i f  n o t  f r o m
Commodore then from third
party manufacturers.

Getting into a loop
over BASIC? Then
follow A P and D
Stephenson's advice
on conditionalIM
processes and loops in
the third part of this
series. t
THE PO PULAR PRESS I S
fond o f  implying that com-
puters, in some way or another,
have electronic 'brains' and
that they work things out for us.
This is typical media rubbish.
Computers don't know how to
work anything Out. They do
exactly what they are told and
nothing else. I f  a  human
doesn't know how to solve a
problem then n o  computer,
however much it  weighs or
costs, can solve it. Naturally,
every pr oblem c o u ld ,  i n
thelery, eventually be solved by
some form of trial and error
process but this is not really
solving the problem — it is just
laboriously eliminating t h e
methods which won't solve it!
Fortunately, t h e  c omputer
works s o muc h faster than
humans that even trial and
error methods  a r e  o f t e n
practical, even i f  it  involves
working through millions o f
incorrect answers before they
hit, by  chance, on the right
one. Perhaps it is this which is
partly responsible for the myth
that computers have 'intelli-
gence'. Nevertheless, there is
one statement in  the BASIC
vocabulary whic h, superﬁ-
cially, appears t o  imbue the
computer with some intelli-
gence. This is  the IF/THEN
statement because it appears
that the computer is capable of
making a decision. (In reality,
the computer doesn't make the
decision at all but it seems as if
it does). The format of the IF
statement i s  as  follows, IF
condition THEN action.
Example:
IF A = 20 THEN 110
The condition is 'if A = 20'
The ac tion implies  'GOTO
Il
i
n
e
 1 1 0   f o r  t h e  n e x t
34 a c t io n  n s tr u c is ion ca r
depends entirely on the truth
or falsity of the condition. If it is
true, the action after the THEN
part is  obeyed. I f  false, the
action i s  ignored a n d  t h e
program continues with the
THE BASIC
FACTS PT. 3
m u m
next line number following the
IF statement. In the example
above, if A was indeed 20, the
computer would go to line 110,
but if it was not 20, the program
would simply carry on to the
next line instead of jumping to
110. It is important to point out
that the particular action to be
executed i f  the condition is
true is not necessarily a simple
jump to a line number. Here
are s o m e  e x a m p le s  o f
legitimate IF statements:
IF A 2 5  THEN X = X+1
IF the condition is true, the
action is a simple increment
action on X.
IF BF > K*( B+3)  THEN BF =
K*(E3F+3)
IF A = 30 GOTO 236
(Notice here that the word
THEN can be missed but and
replaced by GOTO if the action
is a jump to line number)
IF DS = K THEN Z = Z+3:PRINT
DS
Notice here that the action can
be extended to more than one
statement providing the usual
colon delimiter is  used t o
separate them. The rule is that
all statements which follow the
THEN part and which belong to
the same line number are
executed if  the condition is
true. If the condition is false,
none of them are executed and
the program continues at the
next line number.
It is clear from all this that
although t h e  IF  statement
appears to make a decision, it is
not a  d e c i s i o n  i n  t h e
=  Com L e a  I M
intellectual sense. A  t r u e
decision i s  based o n  a
judgement f o r m e d  a f t e r
considering the relative merits
of alternative solutions t o a
problem. The computer is not
making a decision at all. It has
no option but to act on the
value of a variable so it is still a
moron, behaving according to
directions giv en b y  human
intelligence.
We are promised that the
next breed of computers now
on the drawing board, will
usher i n  the so-called ﬁfth
generation revolution. These
are s aid t o  hav e artiﬁcial
intelligence built into them. It
remains to be seen whether
this is  tr ue intelligence o r
merely an increase in memory
processing ability . I n  t h e
meantime it  is comforting to
rely o n  t h e  f o l l o w i n g
deﬁnition: 'Intelligence is that
which a  computer does not
have'.
It w ill a t  least preserve
mans dignity for a bit longer.
Repetition
A computer is ideally suited to
carry out repetitive tasks. That
is to say, an identical process is
carried out on a variable, for a
certain number  o f  times .
Although t h e  proc es s  i s
i(Jentical, i t  i s  c lear  t h a t
something must change during
each repetition o r  nothing
much would be achieved. The
following terms, relating t o
repetitive tasks, a r e  w e l l
standardised.
(a) Loop: the general name for
value, 26 is the ﬁnishing value
(b) Cy c le: o n e  c omplete
process.
(c) T he Loop Variable: t h e
particular variable whic h is
changed during each cycle.
(d) The increment: the amount
by which the loop is variable is
changed each time. It can be
either positive or negative. For
example, the increment could
be +3, meaning the variable is
increased by 3 or -3, meaning
the variable is decreased by 3,
within each cycle.
(Cl The starting value: this is the
value given to the variable on
entering the loop.
(f) The ﬁnishing value: the ﬁnal
value required o f  the loop
variable. W h e n  t h e  l o o p
variable has reached this value,
the r epetitiv e process i s
complete and the program is
arranged to come out of the
loop.
As an example, to illustrate
the meaning o f  these terms,
suppose we want the variable A
to grow. one at a time, from 5 to
26 within a loop, then A is the
loop variable, 5 is the starting
value,. 26 is the ﬁnishing value
and the increment is +1. As a
further example, suppose B 1 is
to diminish from 300 to 200 by
increments o f  5.  T he loop
variable is Bl, the starting value
is 300, the ﬁnishing value is 200
and the increment is -5.
Components of a loop
Bearing i n  mind the points
raised above, a loop will consist
of the following components:
(a) Initialisation: Preparing the
loop for entering the loop. This
will often be no more than a
simple assignment for setting
the starting value of the loop
variable.
: Lima L a m m
iltboar4

P r o g r a m m i n g
(b) The process: This could be
very simple, such as simply
printing o u t  t h e  v alue o f
the variable each time round
the loop or it could be a highly
complex m a t h e m a t i c a l
operation. It could even be a
rearrangement of letters within
a word. In fact the process
could b e  almost anything,
limited only by the imagination
of the programmer. In some
cases, loops are used merely to
cause a  delay  somewhere
within a program. For example,
to display a screen message for
just sufﬁcient time f o r  t he
operator to read it and decide
the appropriate action. in such
cases, the actual process is
quite unimportant providing
the execution time is judged to
be equal to the required delay.
It s hould b e  ment ioned
however that using a loop for
inserting a delay is not to be
recommended. It is crude and,
unless you know the execution
time of the statements which
form the process, is little more
than a trial and error exercise.
(c) The incrementation: The
loop variable must be altered
in some way ready for  the
next cycle. There is no hard
and fast rule as to the position
of the incrementing proce-
dure. Sometimes i t  may b e
advantageous t o  increment
before and sometimes after the
it
Program 31

130 IF A > 20 GOTO 110
140 END

start of each process.
(d) The end-of-loop-test: This
is simply a check on the value
of t h e  lo o p  variable. I t  is
made each time round the loop
to see, if i t  has reached its
ﬁnishing value. If it hasn't, the
process is repeated. If it has, the
loop must be exited.
The f o llo w in g  s im p le
programming examples w ill
help you to become familiar
with the terms,
No apologies are made for the
childish s implic ity  o f  t h e
program. I t  i s  quite good
enough to illustrate most of the
points already made. The loop
extends over the lines 110 to
130. Line 100 initialises the loop
variable by a simple assign ment
statement. T h e  process i s
simply to print out the value of
A each time round. Line 120
deals with the incrementation
of t h e  lo o p  variable, t h e
increment being +1 each time.
Line 130 handles the end-of-
loop tes t b y  diverting t h e
program back to the start of the
L.
=
loop each time providing the
value of the loop variable still
remains under 20. When it has
reached 20, the loop exits and
the program stops. In short, the
program p r in t s  o u t  t h e
numbers 1,2,3, •  . 1 9 .  T o
show that the same objective
can b e  achieved differently,
study the next program.
Program 3.2
100 A=-1
110 A=A+1
120 PRINT A
130 IF A 20 GOTO 110
140 END
This time, the incrementation
has been carried out before the
process but, to satisfy the same
objective, the loop variable is
initialised t o  - 1. I t  may b e
asked, 'Which is the best way?*
There is  n o  straightforward
answer to this since situations
can arise where the second
version is  more convenient.
However, the ﬁrst version is
easier t o  follow. I t  is  more
'logical'. Indeed, we can lay
down the general rule that if
there is more than one way of
achieving t h e  same result,
always choose the one which is
easier t o  follow, even i f  i t
happens t o  b e  a  little less
efﬁcient and takes a longer
time to execute. Saving a few
microseconds here and there
can sometimes be important
but not very often. The vast
majority of programs execute
almost instantaneously anyway
iat least as far as humans are
concerned). Although a lot has
been wr itten about saving
computer time, in  t he vast
majority o f  pr ogr amming
applications, t h e  advantages
are often academic rather than
practical. Avoid using 'clever'
tricks just t o  show y ou are
clever, Yo u  may  ear n t h e
temporary admiration of a few
neophytes but not for long.
The watc hwor d o f  g o o d
structure is clarity.

Bugs in loops
When programming a  loop,
there are two areas in which
bugs delight to lurk.
(a) Incorrect number of loops:
It is very easy to be 'one out in
the loop count. For instance, in
both Programs 3.1 and 3.2, it i
quite possible that the origina
intention was to print out th
value of A from 1 to 20 instea
of to 19_ The error, responsible
for an incorrect loop count,
can l i e  i n  e i t h e r  t h e
initialisation o r  t h e  end-of-
loop test.

(13) The endless loop: It is easy,
in fact ridiculously easy, to fall
into the endless loop trap.
Instead of revolving round a
certain number of times, the
loop goes on for ever. In other
words, the program is locked
within the loop and can never
escape t o  the rest o f  t he
program. The most common
cause of the bug is a jump to an
incorrect line. For example, in
Programs 3.1 and 3,2, if the IF
statement returned control to
line 100 instead of 110, it should
be easy to see that an endless
loop situation would exist
because t h e  e f f e c t i v e
increment is cancelled by re-
initialisation each time. I t
would also happen if the end-
of-loop test was searching for a
number which could never be
reached. For example, if we
had written
100 IF A - 2 0  GOTO 100
it is evident that this value of A
would never be reached so an
endless loop would be created.
If the increment is positive and
the starting value is greater
than the ﬁnishing value, you
have a n  endless loop. A n
endless loop will also arise if
the increment is negative and
the starting value is less than
the ﬁnishing value. Unfortu-
nately, the cure of loop bugs
is not always so easy to spot. If
the loop is at all complex, it may
require a  g o o d  d eal  o f
detective w o rk  a n d  t h e
occasional bout o f  cursing
before the cure is found. Very
often, curing one fault initiates
another, particularly i f  you
have been careless with regard
to structure.
The FOR/NEXT loop
method
Although the previous method
of organising a loop is quite
satisfactory, the designers of
BASIC were kind enough to
I t
statements w h i ch  w e r e
36 intended to make life a lot
easier. The FOR statement is
used at the start of the loop and
the NEXT statement marks the
end of the loop. The process is
in the middle. Although the
Commodore User Manual
describes t h e  u se o f  t h e
FOR/NEXT loop structure, we
will start from scratch in order
to amplify some of the points
made. The format of the FOR
statement is as follows,
FOR variable = starting v alue
TO ﬁnis hing v a lu e  STEP
increment
For example,
FOR A = 1 TO 20 STEP 1
This will head a loop in which A
will start at 1 and carry on until
it reaches a  value o f  20,
incrementing by 1 each time
round the loop. The bottom of
the loop is deﬁned by the
simple statement,
NEXT A
Note that the FOR statement
does quite a lot. It combines
the ro l e o f  initialisation,
incrementation and, surpris-
ingly, end-of-loop test all in
one go. T o  illustrate the
elegance of the FOR loop and
to see how it compares with
previous w ork, study t h e
following:
Program 3.3
100 FOR A = 1 TO 19 STEP 1
110 PRINT A
120 NEXT A
This will produce identical
results t o  the previous two
programs — it prints out the
value o f  A  from 1  t o  1 9
inclusive. It does not require
the addition of the IF statement
to terminate the loop. Also, it is
inclined to be less error prone
because it reduces the chance
of being one out in the loop
count.
It is important to be aware
of the following features:
1. Whatever the parameters
in the FOR statement, the loop
will always process through
once.
2. T h e value o f  t he loop
variable after exiting the loop
will always be one increment
more than the ﬁnishing value.
For example, in Program 3.3,
although only the numbers 1 to
19 are printed out, the value of
A after exit will be 20.
3. I f  the increment is to be +1,
it is not necessary to include
STEP 1 .  T h u s, t h e  F O R
statement in Program 3,3 could
have been written in the more
concise form,
100 FOR A = 1 TO 19
4. T h e loop variable must be
ﬂoating point. We can't write
FOR A% etc.
5. T h e starting, ﬁnishing and
increment values can  b e
variable n a m e s o r  a n y
legitimate expression. F o r
example, the following FOR
statements are all legal:
FOR A = B TO C STEP D
FOR 81 B+C- 3 TO 5*D
STEP E/3
FOR C = EP'SIN(K) TO
26*TAN(T) STEP 1/COS (K)
FOR D = 26 TO 5 STEP -0.1
FOR K = 26 TO 5 STEP 1
The last example is, of course,
absurd but has been included
to press home that even here,
the loop will execute at least
once.
6. NEXT A can be abbreviated
to NEXT because there is no
need to specify the variable
although some think it is tidier.
Loop objectives
To consolidate some of the
previous material, here are
some lo o p  problems an d
possible solutions:
1. A  loop which prints out a
table of the square roots of the
odd integers from 1 to 17.
Program 3.4
100 PRINT CH0 1 4 7 ):
REM CLEAR SCREEN
110 FOR I = 1 TO 17 STEP 2
120 PRINT SQR(I)
130 NEXT
140 END
Line 100 clears the screen. It is a
cleaner method than t h e
ponderous P R I N T  " C L R /
HOME)"
2. A  loop which prints out all
integers between 5  and 24
except 17
Program 3.5
100 PRINT CHR$(147)
110 FOR I = 5 to 24
120 IF I >  1 7  PRINT I
130 NEXT
3. A  loop which prints out
the sum of all integers from 1 to
10000
100 PRINT CHRV147)
110 S 0:REM S IS TO
HOLD THE SUM
120 FOR I = 1 TO 1000
130 S = S+I
140 NEXT
150 PRINT S
160 END
Two points here. The program
takes a little while so just wait
patiently. We are aware of the
simple formula for summing
integers but this section is
about loops.
Nesting loops
It is possible to have a loop
inside a loop and indeed, one
inside that, and so on. Such
combinations are called loop
nests. There is a limit to the
number of nests but it is too
large t o  w o rry about i n
practical programming at our
level. Here is an example of a
simple nested loop.
Program 3.6
100 PRINT CHRS(147)
110 FOR A = 1 TO 10
120 FOR B = 2 TO 10
130 PRINT A*B
140 NEXT
150 PRINT
160 NEXT
160 END
I he inner loop is between lines
120 to 140 inclusive. The inner
loop ﬁrst revolves with the
value of A ﬁxed at 1 whilst the
value of B goes from 2 to 10.
The value of A then remains
ﬁxed at 2 while the value of B
again goes from 2 to 10. This
process continues until the
value of the outer loop variable
has reached 10. Since the
process within the inner loop is
simple multiplication o f  A
times B .  w e  are i n  effect
printing o u t  a  s e t  o f
multiplication tables. T h e
PRINT line provides demarca-
tion between the outer loop
limits.
Finally, we should explain
that no attempt has been made
in any o f  our programming
examples t o  portray a  nice
screen appearance or to use
literal messages. These will
come later. Such niceties tend,
in the early stages anyway, to
obscure essential points. Loops
are so important that nothing
must stand in the way whilst
they are explained. Soon, we
hope, they will become second
nature to you.

Les Allan's fast load
utility should stop you
nodding-off while
waiting for your
favourite programs to
load.
This utility, when completed,
exists as a machine code ﬁle
booted from basic to $C999 and
remains i n  residence t o
perform the following:
SYS 49152
SYS 50000
SYS 50700
Program details
Turbo 64 commands are as
follows:
• L  t h i s  will load, at turbo baud rate, the 1st ﬁle
from tape
L
▪ L "  ",1,1 this will load, to the area of memory saved,
a M/C ﬁle
this will save, at turbo baud rate, a program
without a name
this will save a program with a name
S" ",1,1 this will save a M/C ﬁle to tape from the area
resident in memory
V t h i s  will verify the 1st ﬁle on tape
v t ,  P P
this will verify a program with a name
The program as listed must be
typed in exactly as written and
saved prior to running. Error
trap routines are included to
ensure that the data is within
the required limits and of the
correct value and quantity. The
program when run stores the
relevant data at a temporary

ﬁgure
Ia d d r e s s  at $8000 and when
38 actioned transfers the data to
the start of BASIC as a MiC ﬁle
for the ﬁnished product. At this
point the program when listed
has overwritten t h e 'BASIC
boot' and exists as a single line
number 1 0  SYS 2064. T h e
prompt on the screen is the
M/C routine t o  save t h e
ﬁnished product by pressing
RECORD and PLAY o n  the
tape.
When the ﬁnished program
text mode to prompt available
functions
activate Turbo 64
save relevant section of
memory to tape
is loaded and run the M / C
routine transfers the data to
$C000 and will remain available
for use by the programmer to
load, save and verify at Turbo
baud rate — 10 times normal
speed.
Turbo save routine
A save routine exists within the
utility t o  enable the turbo
routine to be used as a header
for turbo saved programs. This
is accessed by the command
SYS 50700 and, when t h e
prompt appears on the screen,
the routine is saved by pressing
RECORD and PLAY o n  the
tape. The turbo routine is then
saved to tape between $050

and SC608.
Ibis can then be used to
load turbo saved programs as
in ﬁgure 1,
M/C ﬁles can be loaded by
using a BASIC header as follows
10 IF A t  THEN A=1:LOAD"T
64",1,1
20 IF A=1 THEN A=2:SYS 50000
30 IF A=2 THEN A=3:-.0-1
The routine accessed by SYS
50700 s h o u l d  t h e n  b e
appended to the BASIC boot
followed by the turbo saved
program.
N.B.
Whereas t h e  Commodore
Logo key is used to commence
the load routine for normal
useage t h e  t u rb o  routine
requires the use of the SPACE
BAR to start the load sequence.
This utility can and has been
used t o  successfully transfer
many commercial programs
but information o n  su ch
matters is strictly conﬁdential
and outside the scope of this
article. Sufﬁce it to say that
material that would normally
take 15 min to load will take a
mere 1.5min with this utility.

Tangle with snakes,
from Greg Hopkins.
It's all Egyptian to met

THE AIM OF THIS GAME IS TO
hop around a pyramid whilst
dodging the balls which rain
down fr om above. Beware.
especially, the blue ball which
will hatch into a snake after it
reaches t he bottom o f  the
pyramid. The snake will chase
you and can only be killed if
you lure it onto one of the
teleport discs situated at the
side of the pyramid. Once you
have landed o n  a ll o f  the
squares on the ﬁrst screen, you
progress onto a  new  more
challenging level.
You commence with three
lives and gain an extra life for
completing screen one and
then one for alternate levels
after that. To complete each
screen all the squares must be
turned to the colour cyan; this
is achieved by landing on the
squares a certain number of
items, depending on the level
you are on.
Level Method
1 l a n d  o n c e  o n  eac h
square
2 l a n d  on squares twice
3 l a n d  once but square
changes back if landed
on again
4 l a n d  twice — changes
back to halfway stage if
landed on again
5 l a n d  twic e b u t  thir d
landing c ompletely
undoes square
Having completed level 5, you
begin again at level one — but
here are more balls to dodge
this time round.
The game includes three-
dimensional graphics and a

READY,

David Crisp helps you
get unstuck in the
joystick t i
OVER THE EAST FEW DAYS I
have been using some of the
old favourites along with some
of the newer joysticks. As usual
with reviews how a stick feels is
a personal thing and what one
person thinks is great another
may think awful. Some of the
comments regarding reliability.
are based on my experience
working at one time in a retail
outlet and so I have a good idea
about whether a joystick failure
was a one oft, or tends to be
common i n  that particular
type.I have dealt with them in the
order they came to hand and
not in order of preferance.
Each joy s t ic k  I  h a v e
reviewed I have taken to pieces
in order to see why they failed
or survived. This dismembering
was only tried after I had used
them in order not to ruin them
if everything shot out at 90MPH
and lodged itself into the walls.
I tried each joystick with an
arcade game o f  the JETSET
WILLY c l a n ,  a  D r a w in g
program a n d  t h e  fantastic
INTERNATIONAL SOCCER
cartridge which is sometimes
available fr om Commodore.
The toughest test f o r  each
came when they were used
with an Olympics type game
where they  needed t o  b e
whipped from side to side in
order to make the runner run. I
feel that this was the ultimate
test and that this type of game is
unfair to joysticks anyway. If a
joystick failed in this part of the
test I will make it clear. Price
seems to have no bearing on
strength it would appear, and
the only guide I could ﬁnd was
the prettier they are the easier
they are t o  break.
Quickshot 1 & 2
We sold a lot of Quickshot is
in the shop and it  seems I
counted them all out and I
counted them all back in again.
Unlike harriers these wer e
L
nearly all faulty. It seems you
I e i t h e r  love them or hate them.
Personally I hate them. Some
retailers say they are reliable
others say they are not. I say
they are not but would like to
be proved wrong. When they
started coming back in their
droves I pulled one to pieces
and the weak spot was at the
GRIPPING STUFF
bottom of the shaft. There is a
small r ing o f  plastic whic h
actually pushes o n t o  t h e
cheapest switches I have seen.
This ring of plastic, in all the
returned joysticks, had broken
and, strangely, all had broken
on the left hand side.
The rest of the joystick was
ﬁne; the rubber suckers at the
bottom made o n e  handed
operation eas y  a n d  t h e
c ont our ed h a n d l e  f e l t
smashing. They were easy to
hold for two handed use and
were nicely packaged. It was
just a shame they did not last.
did get hold of a new one for
review and it broke (during a
winning 100 yard dash). Same
fault, same place. Life of that
Quickshot_about 20 minutes.
Then came the Quickshot
2. This  o n e  lasted a  little
longer; about another t e n
minutes. Could it really be the
same f ault ? N ev er . O n e
screwdriver and a cut ﬁnger
later I was pleased to see it was
not. The dreaded piece of thin
plastic had been replaced by a
thumping great ring of thick
plastic. The cheapest switches I
have ev er seen h a d  been
replaced b y  t h e  s ec ond
cheapest switches I have ever
seen. They had I  am afraid
suffered t e r m i n a l  m e t a l
fatigue. The switch was a piece
of very thin gauge metal with
four prongs. The prong which
switched to the left had broken
off and the 'UP' prong was
nearly off. The other prongs
had signs of hairline fractures.
The rest of the joystick, like the
Quickshot 1,  was smashing.
The rapid (cheat) ﬁre button
was gr eat, t h e  contoured
handle was brilliant, but I still
could not turn left.
I look forward to being sent
the Quickshot 3. I also pledge
to review it with an open mind.
Kempston
The Kemps ton h a s  b e e n
around a long time now and
still seems to be a favourite.
They are strong and very well
made and have a quality of
ﬁnish rare on most joysticks. I
ﬁnd them uncomfortable t o
use and would not like one
myself but many would agree
to differ and so I would not
criticise it. A lot were sold in the
shop and, to my knowledge,
not one has been returned. I
can't seem to get comfortable
with the ﬁre buttons. The price
is good and, as I have said, the
quality of the ﬁnish is the best
of all those I have reviewed. I
can s e e  t h e  K e m p s t o n
continuing to sell well; no frills
with it but a stayer, it is totally
black except for the enormous
red ﬁre buttons.
The Cambridge
joystick
Quite different to the standard
breed this one: at ﬁrst it was
only available with an interface
but now just the joystick can be
purchased t o  us e with any
console that uses the nine pin
plug. As can be seen, it is a
different style and a t  ﬁrst
glance would not seem to he
suitable for the last shoot'em
up type games. I used one with
a Spectrum at ﬁrst and a l -
though they are not perfect
they do perform well. They are
self-centering and once you
have got the hang of the small
degree of movement they are a
treat to use. The metal shaft is
strong and they lasted through
all the above games. When I
worked in the shop we sold
quite a few of these and only
had one returned. This was due
to poor soldering on the inside
of the stick, which was easily
r epair ed. W h e n  I  h a d
ﬁnished I  looked at all the
others but it seemed to be a
one off fault. They are made
from a hard plastic, are very
strong and withstand almost
anything. They come i n  an
enormous box which swamps
the stick but this is due to the
fact that the same package is
used for  joysticks which are
sold w i t h  t h e  int er f ac e
software.
&gm; •••••Z ri•••

H a r d w a r e  R e v i e w
This joystick comes into its
own when used with drawing
type software. Because y ou
hold the stick as you would a
pen or pencil it is possible to be
very precise when drawing in
high res mode. Not so easy with
a big stick of the standard type.
There i s  another  joystick
available which looks exactly
the same as this one but it is
not self-centreing. That does
not sound too bad until you
come to use it, and believe me
it's a pig. If this is the stick you
would like then ensure you get
the self-centreing model. As
with the Atari the part that you
hold does not look comfort-
able but once you are used to
the feel it is ﬁne. It is without
doubt a two handed job and
attempts to stick it down for
one handed operation have
not been successful. It will stick
down OK but, using it with one
hand, it  is uncomfortable as
well as difﬁcult because your
wrist keeps touching the ﬁre
button. The price is good and it
is a well made stick which looks
practical and performs well and
from my  experience is very
reliable. As  w e  are o n the
subject of reliability I will now
deal with the two baddies of
1 t h e  bunch.
troublesome. For some reason
I was left feeling unexcited by
this one.
Super Stick
The Super Stick looks like a
joke. Its stylish box says it is
built t o  endure longer than
most joysticks and boasts a one
year LIMITED warranty. When I
kad taken it from its box I had
to stop laughing long enough
to try it. It looks foul, phallic
and inferior. ( I  was proved
wrong). T he SUPERSTICK is
pretty — just like the elephant
man! It would look better if the
colours w e r e  reversed. I
couldn't take their claims for it
being strong seriously at all but
it survived. I pulled it apart and
was amazed. There was almost
nothing in it that could break.
Its internals should be a lesson
to all joystick manufacturers.
The switches are balls of metal
sunk into plastic stems. The
contact is a massive metal plate
with arms cut out. I put it back
The BOSS
'The Boss is here' so the box
says. This one feels very heavy
and sticks quite well to the sur-
face mainly due t o  its own
weight. Its external design, ex-
cept f o r  t h e  s ingle ﬁr e
button, is similar to the trusty
old Quickshot 1 but the similar-
ity ends there. I t  lasted the
course and I was blisterless. The
contoured gr ip turns o n  its
stem and I  found that most
disconcerting. It is strong and
its internals seem t o  conﬁrm
that. I still cannot decide where
it gets its weight from. When I
opened it up I expected to ﬁnd
a lump of metal but it was not
there. What I did ﬁnd however
were the strongest hunkiest
leaf switches I have ever seen. I
feel conﬁdent that this one will
continue to work for a long
time. The casing is as strong as
any of the others and it looks
good in its grey and black coat.
The ﬁre button was not the
most pleasing I have used and
did not seem very positive at
all. There was no click to it. I
think i t  would b e  a  good
alternative to the Quickshot if
you really want that type of
stick, and i t  appears that it
would give you a  lot more
service. Due t o the rotating
shaft I  did ﬁnd that it  was
possible to ﬁnd yourself going
the wrong way but after setting
used t o  i t  I  found i t  less

together and plugged it back in
and tried to break it. I couldn't.
I pulled it to pieces again to see
if it had suffered. Not a mark. It
still looks foul and it still looks
phallic but it is deﬁnitely not
inferior. I f  strength is  more
important to you than looks
then hav e a  lo o k  a t  t h e
SLIPERSTICK. It has only got
one ﬁre button. It slides around
the table like it has got a mind
of its own; the non-contoured
handle slips and it looks funny
but I challenge you to break it.
Nice one. Great for kids and
gorillas.
The ZipStick
The LIPSTICK is another that
stood the test of the Olympics.
It is advertised as strong and it
is. The central shaft of the stick
is a solid metal bar. A large
coloured diagram comes with
this stick showing it's internals
but I still felt the need to get
inside myself. Everything was
tight inside and well ﬁtting.
could see the solid shaft and I
was surprised t o  see fairly
standard leaf switches. The way
they were placed though and
the mechanism o f  the stick
itself made them potentially a
lot more hard wearing.
Again this one is a no frills
stick but it was very responsive
and quite unforgiving. I t  is
more comfortable in use than it
would appear and it was very
clunky. The clunks are noisy
but they do sound METAL. A
couple o f  people who have
seen it have also liked it and
commented on how strong it
was. This is another one that I
tried to break. I succeeded in
smashing my knuckles against
the computer console and that
was the only damage. It seems a
little expensive but it is so well
made that t h e  cost seems
justiﬁed. The ﬁre button is on
the base of the stick and is a
little difﬁcult to use if you are
using it hand-held. My ﬁngers
would not quite reach up to the
button but if you ﬁx the stick
down there is no problem. The
coffee and cream colouring
look nice and blend in well
with my bruised knuckles.
Cheetah
Well t h e n ,  that's  t h e  lo t .
You may have made up your
mind as to which you would
like. I have. If I was going down
to buy a stick today and could
choose any of these I think I
would go for the LIPSTICK. It's
a little on the pricey side but
worth the extra. If my funds
were limited then without any
doubt I  would choose t he
gruesome r e d  a n d  blac k
monster that goes by the name
of SUPERSTICK. I  ask myself
why but I don't know. It's just
so strong.
Before ending this article
should mention that a new type
of s t ic k  h a s  j u s t  b e e n
announced. A t  t he time o f
writing it was not available for
the 64 but it's release should be
only days away. It has been
released for the Spectrum and
from what I understand it has
had rave reviews. You may
have gathered that I  am on
about the new infra red joystick
from Cheetah. No leads on this
one just pure infra red light. It is
supposed to have a wide angle
of light spread so that when
you and the joystick dive to the
left to avoid that last Galax ion it
should still respond. I am sure
that t h is o n e  w i l l  so o n  b e
reviewed in this magazine so if
you are thinking of spending
about £30.00 o n  a  stick ( I
believe this will be about the
price) then this may be worth
hanging on for. I wonder if it
will interfere with the video
recorder remote control

Once again, our
diligent reviewers
have burnt the
midnight oil to bring

The DOCTOR 64 package is a
diagnostic program for  Your
Commodore. I t  bear s  a
resemblance t o  a  u n it  f o r
servicing BBCs called a FIT.
test board (FINAL INSPECTION
TEST). It will not diagnose faults
on a dead machine as it must be
loaded in order to run but this
aside i t  really  is  a  useful
program. I  t hink  that t h e
people who would ﬁnd most
use for it are small retailers who
have n o full service depart-
ment; this would enable them
to check machines prior to sale.
Also, I found identify faults that
are due to operator error as
opposed to a machine fault.

packaged and, as usual with
disc, loaded ﬁrst time. You can
then select which part of the
machine you want to check or
an autotes t r o u t in e  goes
through selected checks and
ends with a  lis t o f  checks
completed with a pass or fail
mark. Pictures ar e used t o
illustrate t he items y ou can
have checked and when a
particular item is checked it
slowly sidles off to the side of
the screen and then the screen
clears to give you instructions
to c ontinue that particular
part o f  t h e  t e s t .  T h e
scrolling pictures are not really
necessary on a program of this
type and seem to only have the
purpose of  prettying up the
menu. In fact when you are
going through a series of tests,
the wait while t he picture
moves is an irritation. I will list
the items that can be checked
with a brief description of what

KEYBOARD TEST
As with the BBC FIT test this
• s h o w s  all t h e  keys o n  t he
screen, and as you press each
key the relevant key on the
screen d is a p p e a r s .  A s
RAM TEST
Commodore keys are notor-
ious for gunking up this small
quick test will allow you to
check most of the keys at once.
JOYSTICK TEST
When this is selected you are
asked to select port 1 or 2. A
graphic representation o f
possible joysticks movements
appears as well as a circle to
represent the ﬁre button. As
you move the stick or press the
ﬁre button a dot appears to
show that a good signal has
been received. I  found this
useful w hen doing joystick
reviews as I could conﬁrm that
joysticks had failed as-opposed
to the joystick port.
This test checks all available
RAM in order to identify faulty
IC's. On screen all that is shown
is a row of dots_ As the test
progresses the line of dots gets
longer. This is another useful
test as one faulty RAM IC may
allow the computer to work
OK unless that particular chip
is called. O f course if the IC
at the start of BASIC is duff
then the program would not
load in the ﬁrst place.
PRINTER TEST
Understandably this  routine
will o n l y  c hec k  pr inter s
connected through the serial
port. With such a wide variety
of printers available it would be
very hard if not impossible to
write a routine to check printer
function when it is connected
through the user port. This is
another test which I have used
many times when asked to look
at non—functioning systems.
DISC TEST
This is a similar routine to the
one found on the Commodore
test/demo disc when you buy a
1541 disc drive.
It does a read/write test to
each part of the disc and checks
for read/write errors. Another
useful test: I did not ﬁnd a way
of checking my second drive
whic h h a s  a  h a r d w i r e
modiﬁcation designating it as
device ten as opposed to eight.
VIDEO TEST
More of a test card really. It
simply shows a line of coloured
bars and points out that this is a
good time t o  adjust colour
brightness etc. I think that a
video fault would be apparent
without this.
SOUND TEST

THIS, SAYS THE COPIOUS
instructions, is an olde worlde

And jus t i n  case y ou were
wondering, it  has absolutely
zip t o d o  with the dancing
sopranos in the TV programme
of a similar name. It is set in the
addictive by nature. Now it may
be a  game y ou are already
familiar with because it's been
around for some time on (dare
I say it) the Spectrum but that
doesn't mean to say that it is a
bit o f  second-hand tut. Far
from it. In fact it is one of those
games that is worth its weight in
gold. The object of the game is
simple: to take over a club at
the bottom o f  t h e  four th
division and w it h s k ill and
dexterity to take it to the top of
division one through a series of
league and FA Cup matches.
There's a  chance t o  dabble
in t h e  transfer market t o
improve your team's skill and
even borrow cash from the
bank to keep your club aﬂoat!
Each player has a skill factor
and energy reserves whic h
become depleted the more he
to get out_ The only problem is that he's
got to ﬁnd the bomb and various other
artefacts and detonate them o n  the
outside without blowing himself u p
before he can pass on to the next level.
Naturally there are traditional nasties
wandering around the maze determined
to put a spanner in the works. Sounds
even more like you've heard it all before,
doesn't it? Well, not quite, because the
graphics are exceptionally good and Fred
is a master of a rope climbing act. Whilst in
the maze Fred's strength is sapped as the
days when demons, dragons
and knaves still roam free and
an aspiring young knight must
win fame and fortune before
being accepted into the royal
court. To meet the necessary
requirements a  knight must
journey from one royal castle
to another gaining fame in
battle and enough gold on the
way. Fortunately h e  has  a
certain amount of gold to start
with, enough t o  buy  some
weapons to see him through
the initial encounters on the
journey. T o  a d d  t o  t h e

But it is not a one-sided affair. Fred has a

replenishable with which to repel the
nasties and his strength can be restored by
ﬁnding the magic elixir. All there is left to
do is ﬁnd your way out of the maze ...and
with a horizontally and vertically scrolling

Alas not, this is yet another copy of Blitz or
the similarly named City Bomber. If you
have never played this sort of game the
basic aim is to ﬂatten the city in order to
land your aircraft which is running out of
fuel, Once loaded, which it does with
ease, you can begin. The aircraft moves
across the screen, gradually decreasing in
height. To bomb, press any key (you can't
make a mistake as any key will do) or press
the ﬁre button on the joystick control.
Surprisingly one bomb will destroy a
whole sky-scraper: this makes it a very
simple game and I went through the cities
with apparent ease. Cities to destroy
include Baltimore, Seattle and, of course,
New York. Once destroyed your aircraft
lands automatically. The graphics are one
character and the skyscrapers look like
ice-cube containers. The sound leaves a
lot to be desired. The only good point in
this game's favour is the price. At i1.99 it

frustrating one at that! It  is,
apparently, a very old game
which was played in deserts by
people with nothing better to
do. Let me explain this gem of a
game from Talent Software.
The game consists of a board
with 14 holes in it. You own 7
holes a n d  s o  d o es t h e
computer, 6 of the 7 holes are
in front of you and the same for
the CPU, the seventh is to your
right (called the Kalah).
The bask idea is to win
destroy castles which, in turn,
reveal a pentacle sign. Once
you have revealed all t h e
pentacles there is a brief blue
ﬂash telling you that you can
now kill the last of the monsters
and escape cavern number
one.
Apparently in  this game
there are 31 monsters all on the
40 different levels. They serve
the same purpose in life: to kill
you before you get to the last
screen and stop the monster of

gone all the way in producing a

confused at this point, wait
until you play the game. The
rules take a little getting used to
but after a  f ew  games i t
becomes clear that this is a
deﬁnite strategy game.
I think I should mention the
two people involved in making
this. They are Andrew Collins

AT FIRST GLANCE IT IS NOT
easy to tell what this package
does. The picture on the pack
indicates a game, the wording
indicates a language and the
company name suggests it may
be a word processor. There is
almost nothing on the packing
to indicate that it is a BASIC
compiler. A  compiler is  a
program w hic h converts a
program into another form to
increase speed and efﬁciency.
In all machines that r un in
anything other than machine
code an interpreter has to be
present to convert the program
that has been entered into a
form that the processor can
understand. This conversion
and checking takes time and
can slow a program down so
I etpack

COM 6
much that it crawls. Compilers
turn a program into a form that
is faster, closer to the object
code, and in some cases have
additional features to pass by
bugs or poor routines in the
original machine. In the case of
the Commodore it  ﬁxes the
dreaded gar bage c o lle c t
routine, though more on that
later.
jetpack does all these things
and is 100% compatible with
BASIC 2.0; this means that you
can compile any of your BASIC
programs w ithout modiﬁ-
cations, with some machines it
is not possible t o  compile
without rewriting certain parts.
Another gr eat featur e o f
jetpack is  that i f  y ou us e
machine code routines loaded
from within a program that is
OK. I n  s ome cases i t  i s
necessary to POKE a couple of
locations to do this but the
procedure is so well described
in the documentation that it is
very very easy.
The pr ogr am f o r  dis c
based C o m m o d o r e  6  4s
comes with a dongle to ﬁt into
the joystick port or  cassette
port; in case you haven't seen a
dongle before it is a small piece
of simple circuitry encased in a
lump of plastic about 2" x1.25"
with a plug on. This will only
allow the program to operate
when the dongle is present.
Backup copies of the compiler
are easily made but without the
dongle they will not run. I use
an 5X-64 and while I  was
carrying my SX around I lost my
dongle from the joystick port.
My compiler will not run now,
but as  i t  is  such a  useful
program another mus t b e
obtained. If you have a tape
based Commodore 64 there is a
tape version. Unlike the disc
version there are limitations to
the size of the program you can
compile (12K) as the compiler
cannot lay  onto tape, in  a
temporary ﬁle, parts o f  the
compiled program. The price
of the tape version though is so
low that it would still be an
excellent buy.
When you load a compiled
program it is necessary also to
have a  s et o f  routines i n
memory which are called the
runtime library. These a r e
loaded automatically if they are
not in RAM. They do not use
much RAM at all and they are
in a part of  RAM not often
used. Machine code routines
that I use such as Centronics
Interface Software d o  n o t
conﬂict with the RTL. Chaining
of compiled and uncompiled
programs is possible and easy
and i t  is  possible t o  retain
variable values and transfer
them f r o m  p r o g r a m  t o
program.
If y o u  u s e  non-BASIC
commands called extensions
which are deﬁned within the
program it will still compile.
Warnings are given that a non-
standard command has been
found but provided i t  is  a
genuine extension then the
compilation process and the
end result will still run. Special
extensions t o  BASIC i n  the
compiler allow for faster sprite
movement which does indeed
work well and a routine also
allows PEEK/POKE addresses to
be automatically changed t o
ease t r a n s p o r t a t i o n  o f
programs from one machine to
another_ Because o f  t i m e
available I have not been able
to investigate this function so I
hesitate t o  comment. Claims
are made that some programs
will run up to 25 times faster
than i n  standard BASIC but
most programs w ill achieve
only 5  t o  1 5  times speed
increase. This however is still a
lot faster and in the majority of
cases I did notice a very deﬁnite
increase. I  u s e  a  l o t  o f
subroutines to format ﬁgures
and the delay between input,
format a n d  printing t o  the
screen was considerably less.
For me the most impressive
feature w as  t h e  jet pac k
Garbage Collect. I  have one
piece o f  software that uses
almost the whole o f  BASIC
RAM as one large string array.
When t h e  C o m m o d o r e
performs its infamous collect
routine I  have watched the
machine hang up for 15 to 20
minutes while it sorts out the
rubbish. When compiled it did
still hang up but for less than a
second. It is now a great joy to
watch it hang up and burst back
into lif e s o quickly. I f  the

Commodore collect routine
has been a nuisance to you
then ietpack is  an excellent
buy just to stop hangups.
To ﬁnish then I found DTL
BASIC to be excellent. Unlike
some compilers i t  i s  100%
compatible with BASIC and it
will also run on the 5X-64. The
documentation is more than
adequate and well written and
is I think my most often used
utility program. I now compile
all my BASIC programs if only
to m a k e  t h e m  unlis table
(another b e n e ﬁt ) .  O n e
important p o i n t  i s  t h a t
although the dongle is needed
to compile a program it is not
required to RUN a compiled
program so you can still give
copies o f  compiled software
away. Unlike some compiler
producers. Datav iew h a v e
adopted a very mature attitude
to using the compiler with
software that y ou want t o
market. If you sell copies of
your c o m p ile d  pr ogr ams

WRITTEN B Y  THE SAME GENTLEMAN
who concocted Flip & Flop, Fernando
Herrera has done it again. This game is
about trying t o  save Earth, I  say this
because it is very trying, and you always
lose in the end. Apart from that it is very
good. The graphics with the cartoon
intermissions and the 1812 overture are
just right.
However, it lacks a little of the 'umph'
that Flip & Flop had. The game consists of
stopping megamines from hitting earth
and killing as many Megadarian ships as
possible whilst keeping yourself alivesim
ple enough! After two 'chase'
sequences I didn't have any saucers left,
end of game for me.
You do get shields which deplete your
power, along with losers. At the edge of
the galaxy there are power points from
which you can replenish your weakening
strength b u t  b e  careful because a
megamine might scatter the earth over a
vast distance whilst you are performing
this m i n o r  tas k . E ig h t  d if f e r e n t
Megadarian ﬁghters can be encountered
on the 34 levels, of which you can select
up to level 23.
The cartoons ar e worth watching
because as you progress your man is
welcomed home in different ways. It's a
good game but I did ﬁnd it easy to switch
off and play something else.

CBM 64
LIKE THE HOBBIT FOR THE 64 THE
Forest of Doom by Pufﬁn is supplied with
a book. It is worth remembering that this
game is based on a book written by Ian
Livingstone who is at the forefront of
Dungeons &  Dragons. T his  i s  a n
adventure game based around the basic
rules of D  & D. Once loaded you are
confronted by a high resolution screen
showing a decidedly suspicious forest.
I immediately thought that it  was
going t o  b e  a  high quality graphics
adventure. I was wrong at least up to the
point I reached.
Let me explain the principles behind
the game and what your tasks are. The
After reading the instructions which
described Archipelago as a type of maze
game. I  started to have doubts. There
have, in the past, been too many maze
games and an addition to the very long
call would make it just one more name on
a never ending list. This would have to be
very good to make it stand out above the
rest.
- The idea is to collect the mysterious
jewels from a maze so that you can escape
the maz e and inevitably g o  o n  t o
bumping into a mad granny or any other
obstacle you are confronted with. On the
second screen you arrive at the main road
which you must cross avoiding the vans,
cars and yet more grannies. I can guess
what y ou ar e thinking, y et anothei
version of Frogger. You're right, but this is
more addictive. The third screen presents
railway lines and trains. O n arrival at
screen four, grab your shopping trolley
and off you go around a maze avoiding of
course yet more grannies. Once you
achieve this you're back to screen one.
The graphics on this game are reasonable
and the sound gives it added life. It loaded
very easily ﬁrst time and it has a good title
page. At £1.99 it is very good value for
money and a game not to be missed by
any VIC owner.
theory is  that alter rolling some dice
(kindly provided by the computer), you
build up your character's abilities. The
higher the dice roll the better. Anyway,
once your character has its qualities you
then get a long brieﬁng of what has
happened in the world which you are
now a resident.
The plot goes something like this —
you are a warrior of great reputation. One
sunny day you just happen to be near a
spot where this dwarf says his ﬁnal words.
In desparation and half madness he tells
you of the four runes which have been
stolen and mislaid in the Forest of Doom.
He then expires and you decide to get the
runes back because there might b e
something in it for you. From thence your
struggle begins and even if you are short
and clever or built like an ox (thick as one
as well) you'll have some great fun.
S.
progressively harder levels, As  usual
there a r e  guardians w h o  f o r  some
unknown reason want your blood,
Once loaded, the title screen and then
the high score table are displayed. Then a
rather nice animation of a storm battered
island with a man running into a cave is
initiated ﬁnally leading to the game.
As a conclusion I am tempted to say
'Nice presentation, shame about the
game', but I won't.
I DON'T NORMALLY LIKE WAITING 14
minutes for a program to load, but since I
had already played Kalah by Talent for the
64 and was greatly impressed, I went and
made myself a coffee and got ready to
play Archipelago.

MANY ROUTINES HAVE BEEN
published i n  t h e  past t o
provide a way of 'formatting'
numerical data so that the data
is rounded t o  the speciﬁed
number of  decimals and to
ensure that the decimal points
line up when the data is printed
in a column. Many of these
routines are very long and
tortuous and may slow the
system down considerably if
there are a lot of numbers to
process. I therefore decided to
write a  routine (in BASIC)
which would be as short and as
economical as possible, which
would approximate t o  t h e
speed o f  machine co d e
routines an d  which would
format fully even 'difﬁcult'
numbers su ch  a s  t h o se
expressed i n  exponential
mode.
In particular, the routine
needed to:
— round both positive and
negative numbers correctly
avoiding the errors that are
occasionally introduced when
the CBM arithmetic function
processes certain numbers (
e.g. try to round 812.676144 by
using t h e  INT(X*1000+0.5)/
1000 approach!)
— process numbers less than
±0.01 which would otherwise
be expressed in exponential
mode
— put in leading zeroes for
values between VI and -1 e.g.
to ensure that .7 is expressed as
0.7
— add a  fractional part of
trailing zeroes t o  ensure
consistency so that to three
decimal places 2.3 will b e
expressed as 2.300 and that 2
will be expressed as 2.000 for
2xample.
1h
e
 routine presented here is
4 effectively contained in three
lines i.e. lines 3-5 dnd assumes
that whatever number o n e
wishes to process has been
copied into the variable Z. The
other variables associated with
the formatting subroutine all
start w it h  Z  s o  that t h e
programmer c a n  a v o i d
,7ontaminating the rest of the
program. Line 1 sets up certain
default values but these may be
changed in the course of the
program i f  desired. T h e
demonstration is set up with
three decimal places (Z3), a
rounding factor of 1000 (Z4)
and a 'ﬁeld-length' of 9 (Z2).
The string of padding blanks
(Z1S) can always b e  made
longer if desired and obviously
the GOTO at the end of line 1
points to the normal start of the
program. Notice particularly
that Z4, the rounding factor, is
speciﬁed exactly —  i f  y ou
attempt a  short-cut such as
Z4-10/13 then the result may
be internally stored in a slightly
inaccurate form and this may
introduce errors later on. This
is d u e  t o  t h e  f act  t h at
exponentiation involves
manipulating the logarithm of
a number and some loss of
accuracy i s  p o t en t ially
possible. A  'balancing factor'
(Z6) is included to compensate
for occasional failures t o
round exactly.
The internal construction
of the program is as follows:
Line 3.
Makes a rounded string of the
number multiplied b y  t h e
rounding factor. Notice that
this works just as well for
negative a s  f o r  positive
numbers. T h e  'balancing
factor' (Z6) is necessary due to
the f act  t h a t  t h e  C B M
interpreter does not force a
round before performing INT
and one has to correct this
deﬁciency. T h e  balancing
factor is the smallest that trial-
and-error has demonstrated to
be effective for both positive
and negative numbers. If you
wish t o  demonstrate t h e
presence of the INT bug for
yourself then try the following:
PRINT 123.4555*1
INT(123.4555*1000+.5)
Both should give 123456 but
the INT gives 123455 due to the
bug. T h e presence o f  t he
'balancing factor' enables
numbers such as 123.4555 and
-123.4555 to round correctly to
123.456 and -123.456 respect-
ively. If you do not mind the
occasional inaccuracy caused
by the failure to round up then
you can cut out the reference
to Z6 in Line 1 and the whole of
the term ZeritSGN(Z) in Line 3.
This also has the by-product of
speeding up the whole sub-
routine b y  some 10% but
personally I  would rather
sacriﬁce a little bit of speed for
complete accuracy. (Inciden-
tally, the PRINT USING routine
in the COMMAND-0 chip will
fail t o  round a  negative
number such as -123.4555 to
three decimal places cor-
rectly!)
Line 4.
Is only called into play for
numbers (positive or negative)
that are less than 1 and require
a leading zero to be inserted.
The effect of line 4 is to turn,
for example, -.123 into -0.123 or
7E-03 into 0.007. Numbers that
would normally be expressed
in scientiﬁc notation g et
turned into 'normal' numbers
by this lin e but  a  similar
technique is not used for very
large numbers which generally
constitute less of a problem.
Line 5:
This line is one of the most
critical i n  t h e  w h o l e
subroutine. If we assume that a
Z o f  123.4555 h as b een
converted to the string Z$ of
123456 (in line 3) then this line
inserts the decimal point in the
correct place, pads to the left
with blank spaces and prints
out t he result (leaving the
cursor on the same line) before
RETURNing. I t  is obviously
necessary that integers avoid
this line altogether and that is
why they are taken care of by
the conditional statement at
the end of line 3.
How fast/
Given that care has been taken
to ensure that the routine is as
accurate as possible, how does
it compare with machine-
code routines for speed? In
order t o  make meaningful
comparisons, I  undertook
some t rials i n  w h ich  I

routines do not have to search
through ot her  variables i n
order t o  ﬁnd them. For the
same reason, constants have
been deﬁned as variables as
this, too, speeds up the entire
subroutine. These techniques
are applicable to other BASIC
programs as well where speed
is the essence. If you know that
you are not going to require
integers then you can cut out
the whole of the conditional
statement contained at the end
of line 3 and this too will speed
processing slightly.
To c all t h e  subroutine
merely copy whatever variable
you wish formatting into Z and
then call the subroutine with
GOSUB 3. You may consider
that this is a slightly messy way
to do it — why not use a user-
E TC
deﬁned function instead? As
you might have guessed the
user-deﬁned func tion takes
quite a  b i t  • more time t o
process and therefore I chose
the 'copy' method.
If y ou wish t o  alter the
number of decimal places in
the course of the program then
you n e e d  t o  a l t e r  t h e
parameters of Z3 and Z4. To
effect the change, make 13 the
number o f  decimal places
required and Z4 the relevant
rounding factor. For example,
to round to two decimal places
make Z3=2 and Z4 = 100 before
the  subroutine c all. These
values remain in  effect until
you change them again.

A meander along your
favourite river may
take a nasty turn
when confronted by
E.G. Tout's grisly
Gators!
IN THIS GAME YOU PLAY THE
part of Joe, out for a quiet boat
ride at yo u r favourite beauty
spot. Su d d e n ly y o u  re a lise
that someone with  a  warped
sense of humour has set loose a
shoal o f  d a n g e ro u s  a n d
ferocious alligators, intent on
making you their meal of the
day.
Guide Joe through 4 waves
trying to steer clear of ﬂoating
logs, other boats, rafts, ﬂoating
weed — but, above all, watch
those Gators!
When you reach the narrow
exit y o u  h a ve  t o  guide Joe
through t h e  lo c k s  wit h o u t
hitting t h e  w a l k  o r  o v e r-
hanging rocks. There is also a
hole in the boat and you must
use the lire button to bale out
or the boat will sink. You also
have a time  limit —  so don't
hang around too long.
The t ime  limit  and water
level are shown at the bottom
of the screen:
Time...WHITE
Water level BLUE
Plug your joystick into port 2.
Normal jo yst ick mo v e me n t
applies on the lakes but on the
locks screen yo u  can control
Joe by:

You have 5 lives.

• Softwan:

Peter Freebrey tries to
prevent fellow
adventurers from
getting lost in pursuit
of their goals.
WITH THE RIGHT PIECE OF
magical/technological equip-
ment, it is possible to see and
hear from afar. The past is
clearest, the present can be just
a little misty and the future can
be decidedly foggy b u t  in an
effort t o  k eep y ou at least
partially informed, the scrying
glass has been dug out of the
cellar and given a quick polish
Sadly, causing mystical
black runes to appear on this
piece of specially pulped wood
ﬁbre has no magic involved.
Technology takes it's toll and
by the time you convert this to
neural pulses, and translate my
apparent gibberish into some
form o f  under s tandable
communication ...some of our
prophesies will already have
been proved true (or false!).
PSS get the Midas touch
PSS are introducing the MIDAS
adventure concept f o r  t h e
CBM 64 — The Multi Dimen-
sional Animation System. This
appears t o  offer all sorts of
exciting facilities, including:
3D graphics, data compression,
a form of artiﬁcial intelligence,
mixed joysticks and keyboard
entry and expansion modules
for future games. T he ﬁrst
adventure using this system will
be 'Swords and Sorcery', which
appears from PSS releases to be
a rather ﬁne example of 'mazes
and monsters'. Your character
may b e  d e v e l o p e d  i n
traditional s ty le a n d  t h e n
progress t h r o u g h  f ur t her
'Swords and Sorcery' modules
Sounds great —we'll let you
know when we see one!
Piecing adventures
together
Mosaic Publishing have three
adventure games for the '64
about to hit the RAM. 'Erick the
Viking' has been written by
Level 9 and is a graphics and
text adventure based on the
children's book by Terry Jones.
1S c r e e n  shots on the packaging
60 l o o k  good —so keep your eyes
skinned for this one.
Also from Mosaic, but this
time programmed by  Shards
Software are: 'T he Stainless
Steel Rat Saved The World' and
'Nomad o f  Time'. Both are
based on books by well known
TALES FROM
sci-ﬁ authors, Harry Harrison
and M ic h a e l M o o r c r o f t .
respectively. Pre-releas e
review copies o f  these two
seemed to be a triﬂe slow in
response time. Final versions
may well be improved —watch
this column for the low down
Beyond midnight
Beyond Software have ﬁnally
got to the point of releasing
'Lords o f  Midnight '  ( w ell
almost!) for the CBM 64. This
program has caused quite a stir
since it's introduction for the
Spectrum a n d  i s  eager ly
awaited by  us 64'ers. 1 0 M '
crosses t h e  b o u n d a r ie s
between an adventure game
and a strategy game and by
anyone's standards, produces
an epic saga. On the Spectrum
some 32,000 different views of
the landscape are claimed I
can't wait!
Talent goes West
Talent Computer Systems is a
new s oftwar e hous e a n d
amongst its offerings is a mainly
text adventure for the 64 (sorry
all y o u  other  Commodore
owners b u t  thats the way the
bytes crumble!). Called 'West'
the program is  s et i n  and
around a  ghost town in the
Wild West — you J. T. Edson
fans h a d  better  o i l  thos e
sixguns a n d  c hec k  y o u r
poncho's waterproof!
As this will b e a  regular
adventure corner, we hope to
foster a  certain camaraderie
with you the reader. If you have
any views or  news — let us
know. We might even be able
to HELP. Alternatively it might
be just as pleasant to learn that
we are semi-mortal and cannot
solve that problem either.
You are on a mud
bank
What next? This is part of the
opening sequence that you will
ﬁnd o n  entering 'Dungeon
Adventure' by Level 9. You can
of course 'thrash around every
which way, t o  try  and ﬁnd
something — anything! — and
generally get th e  feel o f  the
game. Possibly some of us have
to 'get going', move and be
damned etc. But, if  you are
planning t o  b e  a  t r u e
adventurer, sanity must return
and out should come pencil
and paper as you carefully start
at the beginning.
Incidentally, if you do have
a quick 'look around' before
starting seriously —  d o n ' t
forget to QUIT ﬁrst — if you do
not start from scratch you may
ﬁnd that quick 'look around'
has used up some of a pre-
determined number of moves
and the light/sun might go
out O
r
 you may develop
blisters befor e ﬁnding t h e
bandaids etc.
As you move, study each
location description carefully.
There may well be red herrings
but many of the clues to solving

the game will be in what you
see and meet iliterally in the
better graphics games!). Some-
times the descriptions will tell
you which way you may move
— even if this is so, still try all
directions any way . So m e
programs hav e t h e  phrase
'obvious exits are:' I leave it to
your imagination as to what the
un-obvious exits may be.
Moving may  sometimes
prove to be a puzzle in itself!
Most adventures will accept a
verb and a noun —  in that
order: G O  NORTH —  some
will accept mor e complex
sentences and many will be
quite happy with single letter
entries for directions — N,S,E,
or W .  Find o u t  what y our
program accepts. Why  waste
time typing GO NORTH if you
can more easily use 'N'.
Simple movement direc-
tions are usually no problem —
even if you do have to type in
CO WEST in full! What can
prove bafﬂing i s  h o w  t h e
programmer has  interpreted
requests for other seemingly
simple actions. Try not to get
too frustrated if what you think
is obvious was not so to the
poor old programmer. Ideally
each a d v e n t u r e  s h o u l d
recognise all the synonyms for
any given word, but memory
limitations alone preclude this
— just be patient and learn his
system!
There may be a location
hinted a t ,  w hic h appears
impossible to reach by using
the compass points N. NW,W,
L
1

SW s o m e  programs even
require NNE etc ! D o  n o t
despair, try ENTER 'XXX', or GO
'XXX', o r  I N  'XXX', or  even
ENTER, GO or IN. If it's above
you t r y  CLIMB, SCALE o r
ASCEND —  you d id  try UP
didn't you? I  feel that the
simple obvious word should be
used, as I'm trying to solve the
overall puzzle provided by the
adventure, not trying to pass an
additional test on the English
language. I once got caught for
ages trying to put my lamp out
— otherwise it burnt the basket
I was trying to put it in! —OFF
LAMP, OUT LAMP ﬁn a l l y ,
and almost at the point o f
as mentioned earlier, there
may be a time/move penalty
and also in most games you
must learn by trial and error
what to do with what, when
and where.
Most adventures seem to be
split u p  int o quite deﬁnite
sections. Having solved (you
think!) a section, if the program
permits, SAVE your game at
that point. This seems obvious,
but a  surprising number o f
people end up starting from
the beginning, r epeating
dozens of moves only to be
killed at the same spot again
and again.

Another thing to look for is
whether you have to type in the

One standard puzzle is to

 some games this produces a clue (us

EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE AT
ALL TIMES.
Mapping is a personal thing
and there are several different
methods. Almost every system
you use is going to call for
several large sheets of blank
paper! Try to be logical in what
you d o  and above a ll b e
consistent. I  use a series of
rectangular boxes which may
or may not be joined by lines
indicating whether there is a
connection b e t w e e n  t h e
locations.
Level 9 kindly agreed to me
using 'Dungeon Adventure' for
the following examples. First
how to deal with one particular
location (ﬁg 1).
The box represents the toe-
d! iOn which is the SOUTH END
of an ISLAND. O n the island
may be found a magical MIR-
ROR. The line at the south
of t h is  loc ation h a s  t w o
arrows o n  i t ,  in d ic a t in g
that I can move to and from this
location i n  either direction.
'SIREN' by the side of this line
shows a hazard or puzzle that
has to be solved before free
mov ement i s  p e r m it t e d .
'WILLOW' to the north, with
only o n e  ar r ow indic ates
another hazard, and as there is
an arrow pointing in only one
direction — this tells me that I
cannot t r a v e l  i n  t h o s e
from the north end o f  the
island! Lines with CROSS BARS
at E,W,NE etc  show that I
cannot t r a y  e l  i n  t hos e
directions.
The t w o  a d d i t i o n a l
directions that you should try
are LIP and DOWN. I  only
indicate thes e i f  they  ar e
accepted. Looking at a slightly
larger section of the map we
have something like Fig 2.
Leav e  yourself plenty of
room on the paper, so that you
can rec ord such things as
'SLEEP WELL' and, if you wish, a
brief note on how to overcome
the spell! If I ﬁnd a location
where I am moving to another
'section', I usually write a letter
in the box and start mapping on
a new sheet of paper with the
same letter in the location I
have just moved to.
Above all be methodical —
check every direction. Some-
times you may only travel in
one d ir e c t io n  f r o m  o n e
location t o  another, so only
one arrow will appear on your
map (ﬁg 3). Always check to see
if you can return to a location
by the same path. Fig 3 also
shows how I record a path that
doubles back on itself to the
same location.
So, we have the beginnings
of how t o  approach a  new
adventure —  mov ing a m
mapping. Next month we will
have a  look  at one o f  th
adv entur e pr ogr ammer s
favourite tricks — the maze.
Again we must map it, but this
can prove difﬁcult and calls for
a somewhat different tech-
nique.

for this book o f  30 '  mind-
stretchers from Ian Creasey.
These games seem to have a
high destructive element.
There are bombs galore in
Bomber where your aim is to
bomb buildings and land while
avoiding t h e  anti-aircraft
missiles, Submarine where you
have to bomb submarines from
a plane and Dumper where you
must protect an underground
city from the aliens trying to
bomb it. If your idea of fun is
confrontation with aliens and
assorted weirdos, then test
your skills at  Alien Attack
where, while moving to the top
of the screen, you must shoot
the aliens emerging from the
bottom, Munchers where you
have to defend the WWII'S dyke
from t h e  Munchers an d
Zombies where you must lure
the zombies into the pothole at
the centre o f  t h e island.
Animals also feature with
Rhino where you must avoid
being eaten by the rhinos while
ﬂeeing through the jungle, Cat
and Mouse where you must get
the mouse out of the maze
without being eaten by the cat
and Snake where you score
62 points b y eating u p  green
numbers (why this obsession
with eating?!). M r .  Creasey
does produce the odd yawn
with such well-worn numbers
as Mastermind, Breakout and
Connect 4. But the book is also
spiced-up with such relative

interesting addition is Life, a

THIS B O O K  A I M S  T O
provide those readers, already
at home with the Commodore
64 and BASIC programming, a
deeper understanding of this
machine and its capabilities.
The ﬁrst chapter reviews
BASIC —  BASIC keywords,
arithmetic functions, string
functions, logical operators,
input/output statements. The
reader is then shown how to
facilitate BASIC programming
through prints, string handling
and structured programming.
Arrays, binary searches and
sorting methods are incor-
porated into a chapter on data
manipulation and BASIC is
combined w i t h  t h e  6510
microprocessor in a chapter on
memory management. Sound,
graphics a n d  s pr ites  a r e
examined i n  detail befor e
discovering what the 64 has to
offer in the way of peripherals.
The authors get to the heart of
the 64 with a study of its system
architecture, t h e  operating
system and the kernal. By this
stage, the reader should be
ready to handle machine code
programming —  the internal
regis ters  o f  t h e  6 5 1 0 ,
addressing modes, interrupts,
using an assembler and a full
instruction set. An insight into
the 6526 Complete Interface
Adaptor, the RS232 and the
registers of  the 6526 chip is
contained in the ﬁnal chapter.
Assorted appendic es  a n d
listings complete the book.
So, if you wish to expand
your BASIC knowledge and
fully exploit the possibilities of
the 64, this meaty guide could
be ju s t  w h a t  t h e  doc tor

lies in that one of the authors is
a schoolboy —  the category
from which a large proportion
of its readership is probably
drawn. Unlike many so called
'introductions', this  jargon-
free book really is aimed at the

B o o k s
novice: anybody else may ﬁnd
the authors' approach rather
condescending.
The book starts where any
self-respecting beginner s

reader through the basic tenets
of programming —  screen
input, editing and printing
Random numbers, loops and
subroutines a r e  ex plor ed
before v enturing i n t o  t h e
world of sound and music on
the VIC 20. Strings and data are
covered before tackling PEEKs,

his programs. The reader is
encouraged to make construc-

Chris Palmer takes
another look at MIDI
and shows you how to
set up a system.
THOSE OF YOU WHO MISSED
last months  article must be
wondering just what a MIDI is.
Well, it's not animal, vegetable
or mineral, it is in fact a Musical
Instrument Digital Interface.
What MIDI enables you to do is
to interface various musical
instruments ( us ually  k e y -
boards) together. Information
from one source can then be
passed t o  another and vice
versa.
For m a n y ,  t h e  m o s t
important feature of MIDI is
that it also enables you to plug
these devices into a computer.
This means that your computer
can record what you do on any
keyboard whic h is  attached
and, if you want, play it back on
any other keyboard which is
attached.
Because a computer is very
good a t  m a n i p u l a t i n g
information of any sort once it
is stored in its memory, it is also
possible to edit or change the
musical information. This is
obviously a great boon to both
professional and amateur alike,
because we all make mistakes.
You don't even have to be
able t o  p l a y  a  mus ic al
instrument t o  use a  M I D I /
computer system. The note and
timing information f or  your
composition can be entered
using the computer keyboard
and then played out through a
MIDI device attached to the
computer, a sort of space-age
player-piano if you like.
So, that brieﬂy is what MIDI
is. Now let's have a look at how
to go about setting up a system.
Setting up a system
For the purpose of this piece
we ar e going t o  tak e t he
Commodore 64 as being the
basis for our computer/MIDI
system. Why the 64 you might
ask? Well for the simple fact
E
66 popular computers around at
the moment, and therefore a
lot of the development of MIDI
interfaces and software is done
for the 64. So, having agreed
that the 64 is the heart of the
system, lets consider what we
need in the way of a mouth.
MIDI
REVISITED
When buying an interface
of this sort, you have to apply
similar criteria to when you buy
a computer: chieﬂy, w h a t
software is available. You don't
want to land yourself with a
system which isn't going t o
grow with you.
A l o t  o f  the companies
producing inter fac es  a r e
themselves pr oduc ing t h e
sotware to accompany them.
This at least means that the
software will run alright with
the interface, but it does create
other problems. Because the
software aut hor s  a r e  s o
involved with the design and
development of the interface.
they often lose sight of the fact
that it is the ordinary punter
who is going to have to use the
thing. Q uite a  few  o f  t he
packages which I  have seen
have been less than friendly in
places. More often than not the
documentation and examples
given i n  t h e  manuals a r e
misleading as well.
Given that we are a nation
of tinkefers, it might also be
worth your while ﬁnding out
how accessible b o t h  t h e
software and the interface is to
prying programmers. W h o
knows, you might even be able
to sell your creation back to the
company. Try and ﬁnd out
what the companies' future
software p la n s  a r e ,  a n d
whether any  other software
companies are writing for the
interface.
Ins and outs
The purpose of an interface is
to pass information from one
place to another, so let's have a
look a t  what y our interface
should have in order to talk to
the outside world.
For a start it should have a
ﬁve-pin DIN socket labelled
MIDI OUT. This is  essential
because, without it, your grand
composition will have no way
to travel to the keyboard in
order t o  b e  played. Don't
worry if the interface has more
than one of these, it just means
that t h e  interface c an talk
directly t o  mor e than o n e
keyboard at the same time,
without having to resort to the
rigours of MIDI THRU.
If you want to be able to
send MIDI information to the
computer f r o m  a  musical
keyboard, then you will need a
MIDI IN. This works in  the
same way as a MIDI OUT, only
backwards. You should only
need one of  these, because
unless you are a closet Rick
Wakeman. it  is unlikely that
you will be using more than
one keyboard at a  time t o
program the computer.
Though n o t  es s ential,
another connector you should
look for is SYNC or CONTROL
With one of these you will be
able t o  p l a y  b a c k  a n y
compositions in time with an
external source. Mor e often
than not this will be a drum
machine or rythmn box, which
provides a trigger signal out for
just t h i s  purpose. Unfor t-
unately you can't synchronise
with a real drummer, as these
will no doubt take exception to
having a jack plug rammed up
any available oriﬁce.
The las t connector y ou
might run up against is one
labelled MIDI THRU. What this
does is provide an exact copy of
the information being passed
to the interface via the MIDI IN
socket. The real advantage of
MIDI THRU becomes apparent
more on the keyboards than on
the interface. Using it you can
'daisy chain' several keyboards
together in such a way as there
will be no discernable time-lag
between you playing a note on
the ﬁrs t keyboard a n d  i t
sounding on the last.
Above all when buying the
interface, make sure that it will
do what y ou want and, i f
possible, have it demonstrated.
Sorting out the
software
Carrying on our journey from
the heart, via the mouth, we
arrive at the brain. Here really is
where any system stands or
falls, o n  t h e  quality o f  the
software. It is very difﬁcult to
lay any ﬁrm guidelines here
because ev er y one has  a
different idea o f  what they
want to do with a system.

At t h e  moment  M I D I
software f a l l s  i n t o  t w o
categories: c ompos er p r o -
grams which record, replay and
edit musical information which
is sent down the MIDI bus
from an external keyboard, and
those which perform similar
functions, but who take their
input f r o m  t h e  c omputer
keyboard.
The prime consideration for
any program is the amount of
storage space that is available
for the note information. It isn't
worth having a program which
can drive 16 keyboards, edit
any part of the tune and make
the tea, if it can only hold ten
seconds o f  mus ic . F o r  a
composer program to be any
good you need to be able to
write more than one part into
it, and then have them played
back simultaneously. If you are
after one of these 'multi-track'
packages, then ﬁnd out the
limits of how many tracks you
can use, against how much
note information can be stored
on each track.
If the package does not use
a MIDI keyboard as an input
device, ﬁnd out what system
you have to use to input the
note information. It would be
pointless buying a package that
uses standard musical notation
if you do not know how to read
music.
If it is a multitrack package,
then ﬁnd out whether each
track can be sent to a different
keyboard as one o f  the big
bonuses of a system like this is
the ability t o  write o n one
keyboard and play back o n
many. Above all, when you
choose the software, have a
ﬁrm idea of what you want to
do already in your mind and
then make sure that this is what
the package can do.
Choosing a keyboard
Leaving t h e  b o d y  n o w
(probably through the nose)
we journey into outer space in
search of the device which is
going to turn our wonderful
composition into reality.
Be warned, the synthesiser/
keyboard market is nearly as
bad as the Hi-Fi market. Walk
into any music shop and you
will immediately be assaulted
by r ow upon r ow o f  shiny
keyboards, crammed full of the
latest i n  LEDs, LCDs, VCFs,
sliders, benders and triggers. If
you ask a  shop assistant for
some help you will soon realise
that the computer industry is
not the only place that survives
on jargon and buzzwords
For a  lo t  o f  people the
criteria on which a keyboard is
bought is  purely price. The
problem is making sure that
you're getting the most of what
you want for the price.
Obviously, t h e  p r i m e
condition that the keyboard
must satisfy is that it must be
MIDI compatible. Lik e t h e
interface, it  must have both
MIDI I N  a n d  M I D I  O U T
sockets. Find out whether the
keyboard can change the MIDI
channel it responds to. This is
particularly important i f  you
intend to use more than one
keyboard with the computer.
For instance, if you have two
keyboards with the same MIDI
number attac hed t o  t h e
computer, it will not be able to
differentiate between them.
This destroys the advantage of
being able to play back a piece
of music, with different parts
being play ed o n  different
keyboards.
If y o u  a r e  n o t  y e t
conversant w i t h  h o w  a
synthesiser works, it would be
best to buy one of the MIDI
equipped piano/organs which
are on the market. If you intend
to get into synths as well there
are plenty which offer pre-set
of pre-programmed v oic es
which will get you going.
Find out what information
the keyboard sends out via
MIDI. This can range from only
the note value and duration,
right up to the parameters that
make up the sound.
As a  r ough guide t h e
keyboard s hould s end t h e
following information: t h e
notes which are being played,
the position of the pitch bend
control (if it has one) and any
voice/program changes which
occur. With this information
coming through MIDI y o u
should be able to record on the
computer every aspect of your
performance on the keyboard.
It is best to check that the
keyboard will work with your
computer/interface/software
as some combinations will not
work, despite t h e  fact that
MIDI is  supposed t o  b e  a
standard.
What's around
Hopefully now you will have
more of an idea of what you are
after when putting together a
computer based MIDI system.
To help a little further, here are
some interfaces, keyboards
and d r u m machines whic h
would be a good place to start
yourself off on the road t o
computer composing.
I nterfaces
Sequential Circuits Model 64
Sequencer
This contains all the operating
software in  RO M and plugs
into the expansion port of the
64. It has MIDI IN and OUT
along w i t h  fac ilities  f o r
syncronising it to an external
source. It can be programmed
in r e a l - t i m e  a n d  o f f e r s
multitrack recording, editing
and auto correction. It has a
capacity o f  upwards of  4000
notes in real time. Proposed
software updates include step
time in p u t .  T h e  p r ic e  i s
between 1150 and 1180.
Siel MIDI Computer Interface
This interface comes supplied
with a two way adapter which
will ﬁt both the 64 and the
Spectrum. I t  features thr ee
MIDI OUTputs, one MIDI IN
and a MIDI THRLI. It also has a
control p o r t  f o r  ex ternal
synchronising. The software is
available on disc or tape and at
the moment comprises a six
track monophonic sequencer
where the note information is
input f r o m  t h e  c o mp u t e r
keyboard. Also available is a
sixteen t r a c k  r e a l  t i m e
sequencer i n  w h i c h  e a c h
channel can be assigned to a
different M I D I  device. T he
price of the interface is around
199.
Keyboards
Korg Poly 800
This is  an eight note poly-
phonic synthesiser with 64 in-
ternal memories. The sounds
are a  little thin sometimes
but a r e  o n  t h e  w h o l e
very g o o d .  T h e  M I D I
channel can be changed and is
implemented through a MIDI
IN and MIDI OUT socket on
the back. T he Poly  BOO is
available also in the form of the
EX/300 which is a keyboard-less
expander unit. Its features are
virtually identical to the Poly
BOO except that it  lacks the
keyboard a n d  t h e  b e n d
control. The price for the Poly
800 is between 1400 and 1450
and the EX800 between 1300
and 1350,
Sic! MK900
This brand new keyboard from
Siel features 10 preset sounds
of which any two can be split
between different places on
the keyboard. It also features
an inbuilt rythmn unit which
can b e  programmed. T h e
quality of the sounds is quite
good considering the price of
around 1449.
Drum machines
Yamaha RX15
A v ery  good digital d r u m
machine which can actually be
played fr om a  keyboard via
MIDI. I t  h a s  t h e  internal
memory to store 100 patterns
and 10 songs made up of 255
parts. MIDI IN and OUT are
provided, making it possible to
record and play back patterns
using a  computer. Price is
around /450.

When you are stuck
with only one disc
drive, making your
back-up copies can be
a long process. Take '0
out the strain by using
this program from
Grahame Davies.
IF YOU  OWN  A  SINGLE
disc drive, you will soon
come across the problem of
backing the disc up. Even if
you own two drives or have
access to a twin drive, there
is a  n e e d  f o r  a  good,
selective b a ck-u p  p r o -
cedure. There are several
program s available to  do
this but all of them require
several disc changes. In fact,
the minimum number o f
disc changes for backing up
an entire 1541 disc is three
because the Commodore 64
can hold about 62K of data
at a time and a 1541 disc
holds about 165K of data.
Another problem with
these programs is that they
are often difﬁcult, conf-
using and clumsy to use. The
enclosed p ro g ra m g o e s
some way to solving these
problems. You will notice
that apart fr o m  actually
reading a ﬁle and writing a
ﬁle, the program is written
entirely i n  BASIC  t h u s
making i t easy for you to
improve on it and add your
own extra commands and
functions. If you select one
of y o u r  discs th a t y o u
require to back-up, you will
probably ﬁnd that you only
really need to take a copy of
about h a l f  t h e  ﬁl e s
contained. This will arise
due t o  several reasons:
perhaps you alreaady have a
copy elsewhere, there may
be several versions o f  a
C
the disc and you only need
68 t o  take a copy of the latest
one and so on.
Drive on
The program will work for a
single drive, two drives on
different device numbers or
MULTIPLE

for a twin drive. The facility
is given to header the disc
you are copying onto so you
may u s e  a  b ra n d  n e w
(unformatted) disc. I f  you
have a single drive then you
will simply press Return
over the ﬁrst four questions.
The directory will be read in
and listed t o  th e  screen.
Displayed will b e  the ﬁle
name, the ﬁle type and a
against e a c h  n a m e  t o
indicate whether to  copy
the program o r  not. The
program w i l l  n o t  c o p y
relative ﬁles. You may now
cursor u p  and down th e
screen and enter 'y' or
against each entry. I f  you
cursor o ff the to p  o r the
bottom o f  t h e  scre e n
(assuming th a t there a re
enough entries) then th e
display will scroll. I f  you
press I h '  o r  H OM E  th e
cursor will move to the top
of the screen. When you
have ﬁnished, press the 'e'
key.
Having pressed 'e', the
ﬁles to  be copied will be
listed to the screen with the
amount o f space taken by
each, then the total buffer
size a n d  t h e  difference
between this and the sum of
the programs' size will be
printed. The chance to re-
edit the list is then given. If
there i s  enough b u ffe r
space then th e  answer to
this question is defaulted to
'n'tp• I f  th e r e  w a s  n o t
enough space then an error
message is printed and the
answer to  this question is
defaulted to 'y'.
The copy will proceed
when you are ready and at
the relevant time you will be
prompted t o  insert your
destination disc, Any disc
errors are reported and if a
ﬁle already exists o n  the
destination disc, the option
to overwrite it is given.

Getting lined up
Lines 100 t o  140 i n  th e
program listing bring down
the top of memory (which
you will have to reset having
run this program), set a
pointer to where to put the
machine code and also set
the buffer start and end
points. The buffer is the area
that the ﬁles from the disc
will be stored in. Note that
the fu l l  capacity o f  th e
Commodore 64's memory is
not being made use of here.
Also note that by changing

will run on any Commodore
machine.
Line 150 allows up to 80
ﬁles to be read in from a disc
which should be more than
enough. If it is not enough
the program will crash with
a had subscript error and
you will have to increase all
of the '80's on this line to
cater for this.
Next in the program, the
machine code i s read i n
from the data statements at
the end of the program and
POKEd i n t o  R A M .  Th i s
machine code simply reads
a complete ﬁle (sys p+3) or
wri/es it.(sys p).
Lines 200 to 300 ask for
the information about your
drives a n d  gives suitable
defaults. T h e  d i re cto ry
pattern is the same as when
you load a directory from a
disc. Thus "ﬁ-Ar' will return all
of the ﬁle names starting
with ' f r .  'Ik=p' means all
program ﬁles and so on.
Lines 400 to 599 read in
the disc directory. I f  you
look at this closely you will
get th e  idea o f  how th e
directory is stored on disc.
Line 460 is calculating the
ﬁle length for instance and
lines 490 to 500 get the ﬁle
name,
Lines 600 to 699 allow the
editing o f  t h e  program
names. It is here you could
perhaps a d d  a n o t h e r
function — maybe one to
make the cursor go to the

then to  the bottom of the
list.

There's nothing like a
traditional alien-
zapping game to get
the adrenalin going!
Have fun with this
unexpanded VIC 20
game from Andrew
Booth.
The aim of this game is to shoot
as many aliens as possible while
dodging the stars. The game is
operated w i th the  following
keys:
= Left
K = Right
Z = Fire
Alternatively, y ou can use a

DESIGN 64
Dave Burnett helps
Your Commodore
readers to design your
own characters with
the minimum of
effort.
TYPE IN THE PROGRAM AND
save it before running it. Ensure
that the DATA in Ines 1140-
1210 are typed in accurately as
this is used in a routine that
plays an important part.
This pr ogr am c ontains
a routine that transfers both
character s ets  i n t o  R A M
starting at 12288. The BASIC
pr ogr am ( w e l l  R E M ' d )
occupies RAM from 2049 to
10275. As the operating system
uses spare R AM f or  BASIC
Variables etc, the pointer (End
of BASIC) has been set by
POKING 56 with 65 protecting
the program and the Character
Data.
The program makes use of
the Function Keys (1-8) and also
uses t h e  C B M  K e y  i n
conjunction with the Function
Keys giv ing a  total o f  1 2
controls which are displayed
on s c r een, w i t h  gener al
instructions (LINES 1300-1710).
When r u n  t h e  program
transfers ROM to RAM via the
machine code routine (LINES
1130-1210), useful i n  itself,
Characters 0, 254 and 255 (in
both POKE sets) are used. All
other characters c a n  b e
changed.
The screen displays t h e
character number (as well as
the character) and the start
address ( in  RAM) . Hav ing
selected t h e  s et a n d  t h e
character, keying 15 will display
an Li by 8 grid on the left, an
enlarged v er s ion o f  t h e
character and the data making
up the character, A  second
empty grid is then displayed
and a  n e w  c ur s or  ( non-
ﬂashing) at top left. This curosr
can be moved up, down, left
and right (with wraparound
control). Stop mov ing t h e
cursor a n d  press t h e  ﬁr e
button: t h e  cursor becomes
solid. Now moving leaves a trail
which can be turned into any
shape desired (press ﬁre button
again t o  revert cursor t o
normal). 
•
When ﬁnished designing
your ﬁrst hew character, keying
F7 will set it to memory and you
can see the result (if satisﬁed);
keying 1 8  w ill transfer the
machine c ode routine and
your new character to tape,
provided you have a tape ready
(changing this  t o  disc us e
would he straightforward, see
LINES 6000-6240).
Then" proceed with your
next character etc saving each
in tur n o n  t h e  same tape
(second a n d  s ubs equent
savings); save only character
data. Each character is saved
separately ( O PENed a n d

CLOSed). When ﬁnished, key
in CBM and 12 to close save
routine.
There is a short program
(LINES 9000-9130) which can be
copied and run independently
which will LOAD the machine
code r o u t i n e  a n d  y o u r
characters. You can then use
your characters within y our
program and y ou lose your
characters.
If y ou break out o f  the
program, t o  t r y  o u t  y our
characters clear the screen and
type GOTO 2030 (which puts
you back into the program
without los ing y our  c har-

Two notable pieces of
software face the
music in these reviews
from David Crisp and
Mike Roberts.
MUSICALC F R O M  WAVE-
form for the CBM 64 or SX-64) is
one of those programs that you
need to use as soon as you get
hold o f  it. The packaging is
more reminiscent of a double
album t h a n  a  c o mp u t e r
program, but it is stiff card and
gives plenty of protection to
the disc and manual.
MusiCalc is  essentially a
program which will enable you
to stretch your SID chip to it's
limits. I t  i s  a  synthesiser
program w hic h makes m y
three year old monophonic
sythesiser look lik e a barrel-
organ. Waveform obviously
realise that most people will
want to get music out of their
64 straight away and so, very
thoughtfully I feel, the thing
that comes to hand after the
disc is a small card which shows
you h o w  t o  b e  t o t a l l y
impressed w i t h i n  minutes .
When you load the program
the s c r een dis play s  t w o
numbers: o n e  is  the E.T.A.
(estimated time of arrival) the
other i s  t h e  C.S.T. ( Com-
modore standard time). The
ETA is the time the program
should take to load and the CST
is the time it actually takes. It
does sound frivolous but it is
useful. Waveform point out
that should the program take
longer t o  load than the ETA
shows then it is time to have
your Commodore Disc drive
doctored.
Creating sound
After a  few minutes loading
a screen somewhat lik e the
display you see in an Intensive
Care Unit appears. A grid on
the right shows three 'blips'
mov ing b a c k w a r d s  a n d
forward and on the left is a mass
of lines, squiggles and dots.
At ﬁrst I  though I would
never g e t  t h e  hang o f  i t
but the manual is very good
and, despite appearances, the
display i s  v e r y  l o g i c a l
and e a s y  t o  u s e  ( w i t h
practice). As you would expect
you are able to control the
t I E
modore and at the top left of
74 t h e  screen is a panel for each
voice. This enables y ou t o
select independently the type
of waveform used in  sound
generation as well as adjusting
the AD SR  (attack, dec ay ,
sustain, release) for each voice.
Below this you are able to

ac c or ding t o  s t a n d a r d
sythesiser practice. There are
the usual types of ﬁlters e.g
low, h ig h  pass etc , tempo
controls and switches to turn
on or off particular voices. At
ﬁrst it is a little difﬁcult to see
what t h e  oscilliscope l i k e
'trace' on the grid is doing but
as you work through the very
well written manual the mud
clears. Unfortunately I  have
prior knowledge of things such
as how ring modulation and
oscillation affects a  giv en
sound and so found it difﬁcult
to assess whether or not the
manual w a s  effec tiv e i n
teaching the 'ground rules' of
sound manipulation, but as you
can hear exactly what you are
doing with the sound as you
change it is possible to get what
you like without knowing why
you have got it. Knowing the
theory though would certainly
assist in using the synthesiser to
the full.
The ' g e t  y o u  g o i n g
notes' show you some of the
built i n  preset sounds and
songs (referred to as scores). A
total of thirty two scores and
thirty t w o different 'sets o f

combination o f  hundreds o f
different variations on a theme.

get past the stage of listening

have t h e  BBC radiophonic
workshop boys drooling. The
next step in the manual allows
you to play along with any of
the preset scores and sounds
using any one of  the three
voices.
Making music
Eventually I  decided i t  was
time t o  l e t  m y ,  a s  y e t
unrecognised, and doubtful
musical talent loose on the
machine. There are two ways to
enter music into the machine.
First you choose the type of
keyboard you require. This can
follow the standard chromatic
scale as found on pianos etc. or
the types favoured by  other
musical cultures e.g. Hindu,
Japanese e t c .  C h o o s in g
different scales means that
instead of the usual c,c*, d etc
you can have a keyboard that
plays a, c  i  f or  almost any
combination o f  t h e  above.

A very difﬁcult concept t o

grasp if you are only familiar
with the standard keyboard.
When y o u  hav e chosen
your keyboard you next enter
your score. The grid shows

then choose whic h r ow  o f

but it at least makes it usable.
The SID chip is unquestion-
ably the most advanced music
synthesis device in any micro.
There is only one problem t o
produce a note requires a huge
amount o f  POKEing and bit
slicing for each voice. When
you can be bothered to work
out the masses of computations
involved the sound produced
can o n ly  b e  described as
excellent. Music Master goes
some way to helping you to
produce music that uses the
full facilities of the SID chip.
When the program loads,
the main screen shows a piano
keyboard representing most of
two octaves. O ther  inform-
ation around the edge of the
screen gives you all the details
that you could ever want to
know. The most interesting is a
small note at the bottom of the
screen saying 'press shift-h for

the keyboard makes a note

POKEs to set up the SID chip for
you, and dump it to tape or
disc. This is a sound for sore
ears as  this  is  t h e  biggest
problem that the Commodore
has.
Entering music
Entering mu s ic  i n t o  t h e
system is quite easy. Tempo
(speed of entering music) and
the octave that the keyboard is
in can be selected and then
you're off.
The thr ee channels ar e
displayed on the top of  the
screen. One of these channels
can be manipulated at a time —
the edit channel. When the
music is  entered i t  can b e
altered and changed to suit —
extra notes  added, notes
removed, note values changed
etc. The whole thing can be
played b a c k  w i t h  s p e e d
changes if necessary. There is a
limit on the number of notes in
a channel, but whether this is
3000 or 1500 I don't know as it is
a bit vague.
The sound parameters or all
three channels can be saved to
tape or disc. One other feature
is the backing music. This is the
same as those awful Yamaha
electric organs that were in
fashion s o m e  y ears  a g o .
Channel 2, 3, or both can be
used with a list of 17 different

Final note
There ar e s o  many  things
that Music Master can do it is
beyond t h e  scope o f  this
review to go into them all in
any great detail. I hope I have
covered all the main important
features.
The disc version o f  the
program comes with a large
number of demo tunes ranging
from 'A string of pearls' (spelt
'AS of _ I )  to 'When I'm 64'l.
Also, the demo programs trom
the manual are there. I don't
know what the tape version
contains, but the manual only
mentions one tune.
The big problem with the
program is that the manual says
that it is beyond its scope to
explain how to incorporate the
data t h a t  t h e  p r o g r a m
produces i n t o  y o u r  o w n
programs. After a weekend's
work and 2K of machine code
later I agree — but it can be
done.
There is a program in the
book that will play one channel

unsatisfactory a n d  c a n  b e
improved 10 fold w ith the
addition of a single line. This
said, f o r  the price it  is  an
excellent program. I was very
surprised to ﬁnd that the main
body o f  the program is  in
BASIC. I f  you want a music
program for the 64 this is the
one to get.

This month, Grahame
Davies, Your
Commodore's D.I.Y.
business enthusiast,
looks at formatting 41
numbers and sorting
data.
AN IMPO RTANT SET O F
routines are those which limit
variable input to integers, one
decimal place, t w o  decimal
place etc. and then format
these numbers. Apart from the
CBM 7 0 0 ,   C o mmo d o r e
machines d o  n o t  hav e a
ROUND function or a PRINT-
USING command and so we
have to write our own. The
advantage of being forced to
do this is that we can format our
numbers exactly how we like
them. For instance you might
format the number negative
one thousand ﬁve hundred
and sixty-three in various ways:
-1563
-1563.00
(1563.00)
(1 563.00)
(1,563.00)
or i t  y ou wer e German:
(1.563,00)
1
The BASIC I N T  c ommand
always rounds down thus 1.4,
1.5 and 1,9 will all become 1 if
INT is performed on them. We
now have to use this limitation
to owr advantage. The ﬁrst
function to write is a round-off
function so that 1.4 = 1, 1.5 = 2
and 1.9 =  2, This is  h o w
rounding o f f  i s  nor mally
performed but if you require
different rounding then it is a
simple matter of altering the
following function:
I
The function w e  have jus t
deﬁned will now round off to
an integer and can be called by
a = 1.5 : b = fnr(a). To round off
to one decimal place we simply
multiply by ten, perform the
round off arid then divide by
ten:
1130 del fnri(z) = int (z
10 = .5)110
To round off t o two, three
etc. decimal places, i t  is  a
simple extension of the above
function:
DOING IT
YOURSELF

P r o g r a m m i n g
1140 del fnr2(z) = int(z *100 +
.5)/100
1150 def fnr3(z) = inqz *1000 +
.5j/1000
Having d o n e  this , w e  c an
now set about formatting these
variables i n t o  strings. T h e
easiest way to do this is to write
one general format subroutine
for the variable with the most
decimal places (we will use
and t h e n  u s e  s m a l l e r
subroutines to call this one by
simply truncating the string
accordingly.
Starting with the general
format routine, we will format
numbers to two decimal places
and return a string of length
ten. I t  is important that the
string returned is always the
same length so that listings will
always be neat. We will also
make sure that the routine
handles negative numbers.
This r o u t in e  allows  a
ﬂoating point number up to
999,999.99 to be formatted. The
ﬁrst character returned i s
either a space or a minus sign
depending on the sign of the
number. If zero is returned, the
ﬁrst character is also a space. If
you want to change this then
change the ﬁrst string in line
1420 (  midS("- " )  )  t o the
symbols you require. This is in
the format negative : zero
positive. So if  you wanted a
minus sign for negative, a plus
sign for positive and an asterisk
for zero, the string would be "-
*+".
To format a  string o n e
decimal place, we simply have
another subroutine such as:
1500a=fnr1(a):gosub1400:4=le
rt$(49):return
For formatting an integer
you could still use the same
standard routine:
1520 a=fnr(a):gosub1400:40=lef
tSja$,7):return
Sorting yourself out
The next subject to tackle is the
one of sorts. This subject is vast
but for Out purposes I  will
explain brieﬂy how a Bubble
Sort and a Shell-Metzner Sort
work, giving examples of each.
The Bubble Sort is the most
simple and most popular sort
used b y  mic r o- c omputer
owner. The principle is to scan
along a set of data held in an
array, c omparing adjacent
elements and swapping them if
necessary. I f  ther e ar e N
elements in the array then it has
to be passed N minus one times
to ensure that t h e  sort is
complete. If an element is at
the wrong end of the array to
start with, it  is  going to be
swapped a lot of times before it
reaches its sorted position. This
is obviously going to be slow.
Another problem is that for
large arrays, t h e  constant
swapping of strings will cause
one o r  m o r e  g a r b a g e
collections thus slowing the
sort even more. Each pass of

the data w ill result i n  one
element ending u p  i n  it s
correct sorted position. More
than o n e  element may  b e
sorted correctly but w e have no
way of telling this and so this
can b e  i g n o r e d .  E a c h
subsequent pass of the array
will have to scan along one less
element a s  t h e y  bec ome
sorted.
The code for the Bubble
Sort is therefore very short and
convenient for sorting just a
few items and her e is  an
example — it sorts N items in
AS(arrav) into ascending order.
Your Commodore will sort
numbers faster than strings and
it will sort short strings taster
than long ones. To make use of
this, if you had three hundred
records each with one hundred
characters of information then
you s hould scan t h e  array
taking out the key and putting
it into a second array together
with a pointer to its original
position. Sorting this second
array with its shorter records
will be much faster and you will
end up with a sorted array of
keys with pointers to the ﬁrst
array. If you do this, you must
remember to keep your keys
the same length otherwise the
pointer will get merged in and
form part of the key.
1600 for x = n1 to 1 step -1
1620 for j 1  to x
1640 if A(j) aS(j+1)thentS=4(j) :4(j)=4(j+1):4(j+1)-1$
1660 next:next
1680 return
The Shell-Metzner Sort is
far faster because i t  makes
swaps o f  items over greater
distances and it also does an
"intelligent" Bubble Sort. I t
does less scans of the data but is
more productive on each of
these scans. This means that
less swaps are made and so the
speed inc r eas e natur ally
follows. T h e  " in t e llig e n t "
Bubble Sort referred to above
is more easily explained with an
example: if  you have an un-
sorted list such as A CDBE and
you do one pass of a bubble
sort on it, you will end up with a
list looking like this: A C BDE
and it will require another pass
to get it into a sorted order. The
Shell-Metznea s or t tr ies  t o
move back after it has made a
swap and then tests to see if
further swaps may be made and
so on. When it cannot make a
swap, i t  moves forward t o
continue the rest of the scan.
11=
A. _
Example of Bubble Sort
Thus t h e  lis t w ill bec ome
ordered in only one pass: AC D
B E goes to A C BD E (making
the ﬁrst swap the same as the
Bubble Sort but then moving
back one item to see if B may be
swapped again) thus giving A B
C D E in only one pass of the
data. The information I  have
provided you with should be
enough for you to see why the
Shell-Metzner s ort is  faster
although you will have to study
it i n  greater detail t o  fully
appreciate it.
The following example sorts
N items into ascending order in
A$ array.
Both of these sorts will sort
data in situ (not creating new
arrays to sort into). If you had
enough memory for duplicate
array(s) then faster methods are
available but the above two
should be adequate for most
applications.

David Crisp examines
the trials, tribulations
and triumphs of a
home computer •11
wholesaler in this
proﬁle of PCS South
West.'
441•
COVERING SO MERSET ,
Devon, Cornwall a n d  t h e
Channel Islands PCS SOUTH-
WEST have grown from very
humble beginnings into one of
the major home computer
wholesalers in the area. Andy
Denning. founder and present
chief, started off as a salesman
for a  w ell known record
company. A s  t h e  h o m e
computer market started t o
expand h e  soon saw  t h e
potential an d  n eed  f o r a
distributor in the South West.
He had already been selling
records to many of the shops
that were now beginning to
stock home computers and
software, so as a known face he
had a  head start o n  other
salesmen. While calling on a
customer h e  heard that a
recently formed distribution
company w ere looking f o r
agents t o  s e t  u p  depots
throughout the country. Andy
left his sales job and within a
few weeks he was touring the
west country in an estate car
selling the latest software at
competitive prices.
The car was his warehouse
at ﬁrst with his entire stock
loaded into bread baskets. It
was only a matter of months
before his own house started to
ﬁll up. Andy says "I didn't want
to get too big too quickly and
so my wife and I put up with the
house being full of games just
in case things went wrong". But
nothing did and so he was
forced to rent space where he
could develop the business and
put it on a more permanent
footing.
Early days
At ab o u t  t h is t i m e  t h e
Christmas rush of 83 was just
starting. It was necessary for his
• w i f e ' s  sister to help run the
ofﬁce while Andy carried on
82 m o vin g  around getting into
more and more retail outlets
and receiving larger and more
regular orders.
It has always been h is
intention to know his product
well and so when new software
was released he made sure that
COMPUTERS
IN BUSINESS
Andy Denning
he tried it himself and could
then decide whether or not it
was worth stocking. With the
rate at which new software is
released it is not possible for
him now to judge everything
personally but everything they
stock will be judged by one of
his workers and their -
passed o n  t o  Andy. Wit h
competition between software
houses as it is, software is often
advertised o n  a  large scale
months before it is released.
This obviously means that retail
outlets are bombarded with
requests for a particular game
and in due course Andy is
bombarded with orders from
the retailers. He has to try and
placate t h e  ret ai l er b y
explaining that despite t he
adverts the game is not yet
available. He feels that he is the
cushion between the software
house and the customer and
has t o take a  lot of  unfair
critisicm for not being able to
meet demands. "It makes me
look as if I am not getting the
goods quickly enough and it
does reﬂect on me" he says.
Primarily software
I pointed out to him that in
some circles it was felt that
computer and games sales had
now reached their peak and
would n o w  begin a  slow
decline. His reaction was one
of surprise. He said that since
he had started there had been a
progressive rise in sales and the
trend seemed to continue to
grow. He said that unlike the
skateboard a n d  C B  radio,
computers could always offer
something new, an  original
game o r a  new application.
Because of this he feels that
although the rate of increase ay
although the rate of increase
may slow down as prices fall
and t h e machines become
more powerful t h ere w ill
always b e  a  good market.
Unlike many distributors h e
has not become too deeply
involved i n  stocking t h e
computers themselves. He will
supply the hardware but only
carries a small stock or gets to
order. He says "If you get a bad
batch o f  games it does not
mean a  massive amount o f
money has to be found in order
to credit the retailer, however
ten machines represents a large
investment and you only need
a few returns in order to make a
big dent in the bank account".
Christmas rush
When I was there Andy was
preparing for the Christmas
rush. Trying to predict which
games will be dead and which
games will become popular is a
nightmare, he says, and that is
without any new releases that
may appear between now and
Christmas. From what I could
see while I was there it seemed
he had a very good 'nose' for
predicting the sellers as when
the phone rang he could fulﬁl
almost every order, and many
of the unfulﬁlled orders were
due to being out of stock.
I went to see Andy late one
afternoon and while talking to
him Adam, another of Andy's
new recruits, was making up an
order for a shop in Exeter. The
order had only been received
at live o-clock but it was being
put together and would be
delivered by about six o'clock.
This seemed to bear out what
Andy had said about trying to
get orders to the customer as
fast as possible. Adam had
started with Andy on a  job
creation scheme but Andy told
me that he would be kept on as
a full time employee after the
scheme had ﬁnished. He said
he enjoyed the work and Andy
was a good boss who even
made the tea! Recent weeks
have not been the quiet period
that was expected and the new
premises taken over only a
couple o f  months ago are
already t o o  sm all. N e w
premises are required already
and possibly more staff to cope.
Expansion
By the time you read this Andy
will have made great strides
towards even more expansion
and should b e  distributing
nationwide. He will obviously
need more people on the road

Peripherals
Apart f r o m  games  Andy 's
second best seller is joysticks; I
saw boxes full of joysticks in all
colours, shapes and sizes and,
while I was there, almost every
order included some joysticks.
He tells me that they seem to be
the ﬁrst peripheral bought
after the computer. Disc drives
come next.
I asked Andy if he wanted to
become involved in software
writing himself. I was surprised
to see that h e  was in  fact
marketing an adventure game
for the Spectrum under his
own label. It was written using
the Quill, a piece of software
Andy rates highly , a n d  i s
available for both the Spectrum
and Commodore 64. It is called
INSANITY and so far it seems to
be doing very well. Plans for
further releases are not yet
known.
Piracy
I asked him if he had seen or
been offered any pirate copies
of p o p u l a r  g a m e s .  H e
immedtately responded with
an unprintable sentence o f
what he thought about pirate
tapes. He has seen very good
copies of popular games at very
low prices, but he says they are
a recipe for disaster. As the
software companies have t o
put u p  prices t o  cover the
losses due t o  pirate copies,
sales decline. More copies are
made due to the price and so
on. It is a vicious circle which
cannot be stopped once it gets
out of hand. Who is going to
spend h o u r s  w r it ing a n d
mar k eting h i g h  q u a l i t y
software only to see it ripped
off within days of it's release
and, in some cases, before its
release? Not only will the prices
rocket b u t  t h e  quality  o f
software will drop.
American software
Talking o f  q u a lit y  A n d y
pointed out to me some of the
new releases from the USA.
They had t o  be seen t o be
believed. H e  feels that this
injection o f  h i g h  quality
to think hard and long about
the quality of their own goods.
Although h e  is  sad for  the
companies that will obviously
'go under' he feels it is only
right that the customer should
be able to get the best available
for their machine. He is a little
worried about the state of the
pound of late and says that just
as t h e  pr ic e o f  imported
software should hav e been
dropped, b a n g  w e n t  t h e
exchange rate, This will make
price cutting difﬁcult i f  not
impossible and in a few cases
may even mean upping the
price o f  imports. H e  als o
pointed out to me that over
here we are only seeing the
best of the American games.
He says that over there you can
ﬁnd a lot of very low quality
software for sale.
I as k ed h i m  w h a t  h e
thought a b o u t  t h e  h i g h
hardware prices ov er  her e
compared with the States. He
told me that unfortunately he
felt it  would always be the
same. He says that apart from
the exchange rate the sheer
volume of sales potential over
there means proﬁt margins can
be very low. If you can sell a
machine or peripheral to just
1% of users over there you are
talking about hundreds o f
thousands o f  sales. I t  is  the
same for everything over there
— cars, records the lot. I could
see what he meant.
Business sense
Andy is pleased to see home
micros being used for  other
things as well as games. "When
I ﬁrst started i t  was almost
impossible to get any business
software f o r  a n y  o f  t h e
machines and what you could
get was not worth having. That
has all changed now and some
of the business software for the
Commodore 64 for instance is
inﬁnitely more superior than
software that is being run on
'real' business machines", he
said.
At the moment Andy  is
looking t o  get his  business
computerised. Andy  told me
"It is a hard choice. I need a fast
and powerful machine and the
amount of information I need
to store will, without doubt,
require a hard disc system. I
also need something that will
grow with the business as once
I get the system set up I don't
want to ﬁnd that it is going to
need changing after a  few
months. I've almost come to
a decision on the machine I
want. It's now just a matter of
getting the right software".
For a  non-computerised
to do this but he says whatever
happens he will still take a key
role and continue to offer fast
efﬁcient service, thus enabling
Andy to buy software in larger
quantities and therefore at a
lower price. This should allow
him t o  s ell a t  ev en mor e
competitive prices and so, with
luck, these savings should be
passed onto the customer.
Looking around I could see
a Spectrum, Commodore 64
and a Dragon and these were
being used to evaluate the last
batch o f  new releases. The
games were getting a good
tryout and two were harshly
criticised. "According to the
adverts" says Adam "this  is
supposed to be the best thing
since s lic e d  b r e a d .  T h e
graphics on the title page are
brilliant but  t he game is  a
disaster, but due to the massive
amounts of money spent on
publicity it will sell and I am
sure a  lo t  o f  kids w ill b e
disappointed". A large box of
tapes, joysticks and discs sat by
the ofﬁce door. Andy told me
that they were faulty returns
but when they check through
he ﬁnds that many of them are
perfectly O K  and presumes
that either instructions have
not been followed or  tapes
have been copied then taken
back to the retailer as faulty and
simply sent back to him as such.
"It is one of the costs that I have
to absorb" he says. Looking
through the box myself I could
see what he meant. I could also
see that o n  such things as
joystick many of the returns
were due to misuse. It seems
that rather than upset retailers
Andy will take them back in a
lot of cases and simply repair or
replace them.
One of the other staff who
works in the ofﬁce is a young
girl called Elaine; today she is at
college as she also is on a job
creation scheme. Andy  feels
that these schemes ar e an
excellent thing and although
they are misused by some on
the whole they bring beneﬁts
to the people on them and to
the employer. Certainly true in
Andy's case as all the people on
schemes sent to him have now software will force UK writers
been taken on as full time. 
o
f
ﬁ
c
e
 e v e r y t h i n g  w a s  in g  bigger and better faster.
incredibly well ordered. Andy
said that speed was important
to him and that he had to have
everythig well organised. This
was borne out by the fact that
virtually no orders were mislaid
and very few orders were late
in being delivered. It was this
reliability that had helped him
succeed wher e others h a d
failed. "There is no hard sell
here. We  don't get o n  the
phone all the time asking for
orders, People know where we
are and they will order from us
as long as we do what we do
well."
"Our van goes round most
of our customers once a week
or at worst once a fortnight.
The shops are, in most cases.
able t o  t a k e  t h e ir  s toc k
immediately f r o m t h e  van.
They can see what they are
buying a t  the time without
having to rely on what they
have read about it. Of course it
is not possible for us to rely on
our dealers. Take the Channel
Islands for  instance, all the
business there is done by post
or telephone. If a shop is not
too far out they can go on our
regular route. That way they
know when we will be there
and that they will ﬁnd plenty of
stock in  the van; o f  course
they can still order between
visits and we send orders out
the same day  o r  t h e  nex t
morning at the latest. In most
cases we ﬁnd that the post gets
everything where we want it
very quickly but urgent orders
can be sent by courier. This
means that people often have
their orders  b y  t h e  nex t

Final note
While I  was  i n  t h e  ofﬁce
another account was opened
with PCS. A customer in Devon
was dissatisﬁed w i t h  t h e ir
present wholesaler and had
heard from another dealer that
PCS S.W. were fast and reliable.
That customer would have the
van round to him the next day.
Andy tells me that they rarely
have to go out and ﬁnd new
business now; their reputation
is spreading and most new
accounts c o m e  t h r o u g h

is a good indication that he is
still doing things right and will
continue to do it this way grow-

For ﬁve days a regular army of
businessmen and journalists,
grandads and eager schoolboys
marched through the doors of
Olympia 2. Deals were made,
joysticks twiddled and books
perused. The conglomeration
of traders displaying t heir
wares made it all too clear that
Christmas starts early in the
computer world.
The 7th PCW show had
arrived i n  town. Distributed
over t h r e e  ﬂoors  o f  t h e

names' on the ground ﬂoor,
business on the ﬁrst level and
entertainment on the second,
this year's exhibition was hailed
by the organisers as the' biggest
and best yet. Showbiz reared
its gaudy head with clowns and
acrobats, American footballers
with cheerleaders i n  t o w ,
Anirog's P.C. Fuzz o n  his

Simon Palmer unlocks
the mind of John
Wagstaff, rock s t a i
turned programmer,.
and the brain behind
Craig Communications'
System 15000.
MID-1983 WITNESSED T H E
launch o f  Flight Zero-One-
Five, a ﬂight simulator for the
unex panded V I C - 2 0 .  I t
contained n o  graphics b u t
proved t h a t  outs tanding
software could be reproduced
in just 3.5K of memory. Since its
release it has sold upwards of
16.000, and is still selling.
Its c r e a t o r  w a s  J o h n
Wagstaff. A very tall gentleman
with long black hair, he started
employment at the age of 17 on
a fairground with his parents.
John then became a musician.
receiving gold discs for songs
he had written. H e  earned
fame and fortune in Germany
(anyone who has ever heard of
Lee Kristofferson will realise
that Lee and John are one and
the same). B u t  h e  s o o n
discovered that, even though
he had 'made it' in Europe to a
certain extent, the money did
not immediately come pouring
in. With cash running low and
to stop himself fr om going
mad, John bought a VIC-20 for
£200. H e  taught himself t o
program and, a year or so later,
released F lig h t  Z er o- O ne
Five followed b y  Whirlwind
One-Five, w h i c h  ac hiev ed
moderate success, and, ﬁnally,
by his latest baby, System 15000,
a communications game.
Craig Communications
The ﬁrst company to accept
John's software and distribute
it was N.K.K., where David
Giles was already working as
the sales-force of this two-man
operation. His job was to visit
shops and persuade them to
buy various titles distributed by
NOCK.. Af t e r  t w o  months,
David's efforts  pr ov ed s o
successful that N.K.K, wer e
bought up by a larger concern
— Ferranti & Craig, who had
been looking for a company to
88 h a n d le  distribution. Richard
Craig, the ﬁnal ingredient in
the 'mix' spotted N.K.K.
Throughout this  change,
John Wagstaff's software was
still selling and, ﬁnally, System
15000 was released. I n  May
1984, Richard Craig left Ferranti
BEHIND
CLOSED
& Craig taking with him David
Giles and, inevitably, John's
software. A  b r a n d  n e w
company emerged from this
re-shufﬂe —  C r aig C o m -
munications with David Giles
in charge of the software side
and Richard Craig responsible
for the rest of the organisation.
The re-release o f  a ll John
Wagstaff's software followed
swiftly, w it h  a  better style
presentation for System 15000
and careful attention it had not
received u n d e r  Ferranti &
Craig's guidance. The stage was
now set for System 15000 to
r ev olutionis e adv entur e
games.
System 15000
System 15000 is a new breed of
game. Whereas with a normal
adventure exercise the game
can whish you off to an island
or transform y o u  i n t o  a
detective in hot pursuit of a
murderer, System 15000 turns
your c o m p u t e r  i n t o  a
computer, the monitor into a
monitor  a n d  p l u g s  a n
imaginary modem in t o  t he
back o f  the computer. thus
introducing you to the 13.13.C.'s
'Bird of Prey type situation, It is
such a simple idea yet no-one
has thought of it before now.
System 15000 also differs
from other adventures in that,
since it is a modem simulation
game, you can, by dialling a
number, r etur n again and
again to various computers at
any time in the game. It is a

genuine real-time commun-
ications investigation. F o r
those n o t  familiar w it h  i t
already, the following synopsis
should arouse both interest
and enthusiasm.
Your friend's company has
been ripped off to the tune of
1,500,000 dollars in a deal it has
negotiated. A  colleague has
contacted you, giving System
15000 and a modem utility and
asking y ou t o  help get the
money back into the swindled
company's bank account. He
also provides one telephone
number, an access code and
two names: armed with this
information, y ou open your
investigation!
Sitting comfortably o p -
posite John Wagstaff in  the
pleasant surroundings o f  his
living room, trusty pen poised
above paper. I  asked h i m
where he found the idea for
System 15000.
"It just came to me and, at
ﬁrst, I could not believe it. So
obvious, yet after almost endles
searching through magazines
and the like, I could not ﬁnd
any indications of other people
being there ﬁrst".
How long had it taken him
to write i t  fr om the initial
concept t o  t h e  ﬁnis hed
product? "About nine months
of bleeding eves" was t h e
reply. David Giles appeared
and weighed in with: "John
woulon t even tell me what it
was until he had completed it
ready for playing — and even
then he refused to tell me how
to proceed. He just said 'play
it" I  must agreee that detailed
instructions are very sparse but,
according to John, this is totally
intentional. With the old-age
consideration o f  value-for-
money, I  asked whether the
price was not a little steep —
isn't E12.95 somewhat excessive
for a single program? John's
reply was quite logical and
emphatic.
"People can, and some-
times do, pay in excess of L12.95
for a hard-back book of merit
and feel that they are getting
good value. The same applies
to good software w it h  it s
underlying c r eativ e bas e,
intellectual c hallenge and
complexity. I f  it  gives you a
good r u n  f o r  your money,
where's the argument?"
personally do not need
any per s uas ion t o  t h i s
viewpoint, hav ing my s elf
reviewed quite a number of
games programs a n d  c on-
stantly wishing for more writers
of John's calibre and standards.
John emphasised that he aimed
to produce g o o d  quality
software rather than higher
quantities of less meritorious
products. H e  regards w it h
strong dislike the companies
who ﬂood the market with
mediocre pr oduc ts , t h u s
devaluing a positive potential
for intellectual and, at the same
time, entertaining pursuits.
"I owe a great deal to the
good people w h o  buy  m y
software — it pays my food bills
and stops me from starving.
That, after all, is how I got my
ﬁrst computer. I wasn't having
much success in  getting my
money f o r  t h e  records I
produced f o r  t h e  German
market, and we were literally
starving. I am sure that buying
that computer did stop me
from going mad".
Reminding h i m  o f  h i s
earlier statement that it took
nine months to write System
15000. I  asked i f  h e  h a d
experienced any problems. He
chuckled:
"I have a little saying that
every programmer s h o u ld
write out and place above his
computer 'THERE'S ALWAYS
ONE MORE BUG'
pressed h im ,  a n d  h e
continued:
"The telephone aspect o f
the g a m e  d i d  p re se n t  a
problem or two; one number
which I  initiated f o r  t h e
American section of the game
turned out to be 'Dial a Blue
Joke'! I changed it, but quick! I
also had to get permission from
the v arious  telec ommuni-
cation authorities for the use of
their different dialling a n d
engaged tones for the U.K. and
overseas.
Music and computers
Apart f r o m  J o h n ' s  ﬁr s t
c omput er  w a r d i n g  o f f
imminent insanity, were there
any other reasons for deciding
on the purhcase?"
''Yes . I  a m  i n  t h e
entertainment business and, at
t
the personal level, they are
bought mostly for  entertain-
ment a n d  h a v e  b e c o me
instruments, both audio and
visual f o r  enter tainment
purposes. Music is after all a
form o f  software, a complex
writing sytle embracing almost
inﬁnite interpretive functions
with b o t h  intellectual a n d
enter tainment p o t e n t ia l.
Computers and software can
be made to perform the same
functions, the only difference
being t h a t  computers a r e
interactive with the operator".
John, as I have already said,
is an accomplished musician.
On the wall above where we sit
hangs a  g o ld  rec ord and,
alongside, a gold cassette for
10.000 copies sold o f  Flight
Zero-One-Five presented,
ironically enough, by Ferranti
& Craig!
Does h e  s ee computers
making an even bigger impact
in the music arena?

"If you think about it ,
computers are already in music
in a very big way. In keyboards,
drum machines and mixing
desks. Synthesised sound is
now an established medium,
having progressed from an
embellishment role such as
echo-boxes to the present-day
reproduction capability o f
musical instruments, an d
onward to new arid previously
unheard of tones".
John's ﬁrst encounter with
computers was in fact in the
studio where he worked on his
recordings. 'Apples' were used
as an integral part o f  their
mixing system. To illustrate this
point, he led me into another
room and showed me his trusty
CBM 64 which he had linked
up, via sequential circuits,
MIDI interface and software, to
a Poly-800 keyboard, drum
machines and mixing desks. He
then gave me a  thoroughly
competent demonstration o f
some of the capabilities of this
set-up. Impressed? I certainly
was! (If this has aroused your
interest in MIDI systems, reach
for your back issues of Your
Commodore' and re-read our
MIDI articles).
Other ideas
I asked John whether h e
thought the CBM 64 was an
easy machine to handle for
programming? He replied that,
although i t  i s  a  powerful
machine w ith much m o re
unexploited potential, there is
the hurdle o f  Commodore
BASIC to negotiate every time.
Alongside all this music
equipment. I could not fail to
notice a  large amount o f
machinery for video editing.
When asked whether he had
yet combined computers and
videos, he answered that the
closest he had got so far was in
the use o f  slide projectors
linked with a music track and
controlled by a computer. It is
an idea which has been used
before for all sorts of purposes
in a variety of settings from
schools to concerts. He opined
that if the technology could
advance further, he had some
ideas of  his own which h e
would like to try: "What I'm
waiting for is a computer that
can handle those ideas!". I
could not help thinking of the
current use of computers in
stage presentations to control
lighting systems such as the
Van-light used by Genesis.
School chips
Leaving t h e  musical su r-
roundings, we rejoined David
in the lounge. Would John
consider writing software for
the education market seeing
that the coming generations
will be living and inﬂuenced by
computers o n  a n  e v e r -
increasing scale? He has not yet
seriously considered this but
Reputation
WHIRL
doesa g r e e  t h a t  imp a rt in g
knowledge does not have to be
boring! A t  this point, David
interjected: " M y  kid sees a
computer and recognises it
without any problem. It seems
that children as young as three
aren't scared of them". John
believes that, had a  VIC-20
been around ﬁve years earlier,
it would have been regarded
with awe as though it were a
mainframe in a  plastic box!
However, t h e  im p r o v e d
understanding o f  t h e  c om-
puter's role in present-day life
is reducing the mystique which
hitherto surrounded t h ese
machines, and the unquestion-
ing acceptance of computers,
particularly b y the younger
generation, is fast consolid-
ating t h eir inﬂuence a n d
impact on our way of life. One
can only hope i t  w ill b e
completely b e n e ﬁc i a l .
Inevitably, the older folk have
trouble in  appreciating and
accepting them, but this has
always been the case through
history with every develop-
ment since Man ﬁrst used a
fallen branch to lever away that
obstinate lump of rock which
barred the way into a likely
looking cave!
We ﬁnally returned t o  the
subject of John Wagstaff and
Craig Communications. D i d
they w o rry  ab o u t  t h e i r
reputation? Yes, they did —
and to a surprising extent. Said
David, "John used to check
one in ten of every Flight Zero-
One-F Ives before despatch".

f LILL SOUND AND COLOURVIC20
"I used to sit with my VIC-20
plugged in with a tall pile of
programs on one side and the
'passed' s oftwar e o n  t h e
other", added John. This
certainly paid dividends: o f
16,000 copies sold, only about
200 were returned and, o f
these, roughly 1 8 0  w e re
customer errors. All of which
amply demonstrates John's
philosophy of value for money,
initiated during h is earlier
struggles as a recording artist.
None of John's software has
his name o n  it ,  his  reason
being: "Because some people
must hav e their  names o n
products as an ego trip, but a
balance must be maintained;
others sign their work in the
hope o f  recognition a n d
consequently mor e employ-
ment". John likes to think that,
maybe, his work is so highly
individual it does not need a
'tag'.
And ﬁnally
I asked John about the future.
Would there be a sequel to
System 1  50 0 0? "A l m o s t
certainly", T h e  quotes are
closed because he did divulge
some of his ideas for a follow-
up but, I  think it would be
unfair to John, and it would
spoil your fun, were I to pre-

I hope that this insight into
the mind of John Wagstaff will
assure you that not everyone is
in the software business to rip
you off. This man has standards
and I think that things to come
will prove to be as much 'value
for money' as System 15000,

- the sophisticated spreadsheet
Easy to learn, easy to use - something that can't be said of many business programs.
But it's true of all the programs in the BUSICALC series.
BUSICALC 3 can handle all sorts of jobs - budgets, expenditure analysis, stock lists,
price lists, and product costing are just a few of the possibilities. Three-dimensional
formulae automatically access data stored on disk, so that you can easily pull
together information from several different sheets and summarise or manipulate it.
It's simple to transfer data to other programs such as Easy Script. And you can use
virtually any printer with BLISICALC 3, whether dot matrix or daisy wheel,
Commodore or non-Commodore.
For the CBM 64 and PET/CBM 4000 & 8000 series
