“[Tyson and Brown] tackle the complex subject of selling a house with
humor and practicality . . . the authors explain strategies that could gen-
erate or save readers thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands of dol-
lars on the sale of their house.”
— Inman News Features
“The best thing about this book [House Selling For Dummies] is that it
doesn’t recommend anything. Instead, it helps you in a far greater way. It
helps you think through the relocation decision.”
— Dr. David Demko, AgeVenture News

also filled with practical advice.”

— Rick Wilking, Reuters News Service
“Home Buying For Dummies and House Selling For Dummies, both by Eric
Tyson and Ray Brown, go into surprising depth on their topics without
straying from their mission of explaining the processes simply. Perhaps
the best thing is what the authors call their holistic approach. . . .”
— Maryann Haggerty, Washington Post

Praise for Eric Tyson and Ray Brown’s 
best-selling Home Buying For Dummies

classic how-to-buy-a-home book. Of the many books on this topic, this is
by far the best. . . .”
— Robert J. Bruss, syndicated real estate columnist
“. . . takes you step by step through the process . . . humorous insights that

— Judy Rose, Knight-Ridder News Service

a balanced approach to buying a house.”
— Times-Picayune, New Orleans, LA
“A survival guide to buying . . . fun to read and very clearly written. . . .
Whether taking over a foreclosure, determining not how much you can
borrow but how much you can actually afford to spend, how to find a
good broker, landing a lender . . . Tyson and Brown definitely help ease
the trauma of the transaction. . . .”
— Paula Lee Aldridge, Homes and Real Estate Magazine

Here’s what critics have said about Eric Tyson
and his previous national best-selling personal
finance guides:
“Personal Finance For Dummies is the perfect book for people who feel
guilty about inadequately managing their money but are intimidated by
all of the publications out there. It’s a painless way to learn how to take
control. My college-aged daughters even enjoyed reading it!”
— Karen Tofte, producer, National Public Radio’s
Sound Money
“Among my favorite financial guides are . . . Eric Tyson’s Personal Finance
For Dummies.”
— Jonathan Clements, The Wall Street Journal
“Smart advice for dummies . . . skip the tomes . . . and buy Personal Finance
For Dummies, which rewards your candor with advice and comfort.”
— Temma Ehrenfeld, Newsweek
“Eric Tyson is doing something important — namely, helping people at all
income levels to take control of their financial futures. This book is a nat-
ural outgrowth of Tyson’s vision that he has nurtured for years. Like
Henry Ford, he wants to make something that was previously accessible
only to the wealthy accessible to middle-income Americans.”
— James C. Collins, coauthor of the national bestseller Built
to Last; Lecturer in Business, Stanford Graduate School
of Business
“You don’t have to be a novice to like Mutual Funds For Dummies. Despite
the book’s chatty, informal style, author Eric Tyson clearly has a mastery
of his subject. He knows mutual funds, and he knows how to explain
them in simple English.”
— Steven T. Goldberg, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine
“Personal Finance For Dummies offers a valuable guide for common mis-
conceptions and major pitfalls. It’s a no-nonsense, straightforward, easy-
to-read personal finance book. . . . With this book, you can easily learn
enough about finances to start thinking for yourself.”
— Charles R. Schwab, Chairman and CEO, The Charles
Schwab Corporation

“It can be overwhelming to keep up with the latest developments, which is
why you might turn to the book Mutual Funds For Dummies by Eric Tyson.
A light touch and the use of plenty of graphics help the pages fly by. This
book is a primer for those who flinch when contemplating the 7,000 funds
you can now buy.”
— Brian Banmiller, FOX-TV
“Best new personal finance book.”
— Michael Pellecchia, syndicated columnist
“Eric Tyson . . . seems the perfect writer for a ...For Dummies book. He
doesn’t tell you what to do or consider doing without explaining the
why’s and how’s — and the booby traps to avoid — in plain English. . . . It
will lead you through the thickets of your own finances as painlessly as I
can imagine.”
— Clarence Peterson, Chicago Tribune
“Personal Finance For Dummies is, by far, the best book I have read on
financial planning. It is a simplified volume of information that provides
tremendous insight and guidance into the world of investing and other
money issues.”
— Althea Thompson, producer, PBS’s Nightly
Business Report
“This book provides easy-to-understand personal financial information
and advice for those without great wealth or knowledge in this area.
Practitioners like Eric Tyson, who care about the well-being of middle-
income people, are rare in today’s society.”
— Joel Hyatt, founder, Hyatt Legal Services, one of the
nation’s largest general-practice personal legal service
firms
“Personal Finance For Dummies is a sane and useful guide that will be of
benefit to anyone seeking a careful and prudent method of managing
their financial world.”
— John Robbins, founder of EarthSave, author of 
May All Be Fed

“Worth getting. Scores of all-purpose money-management books reach
bookstores every year, but only once every couple of years does a stand-
out personal finance primer come along. Personal Finance For Dummies,
by financial counselor and columnist Eric Tyson, provides detailed,
action-oriented advice on everyday financial questions. . . . Tyson’s style
is readable and unintimidating.”
— Kristin Davis, Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Magazine
“For those named in the title, such as myself, Personal Finance For
Dummies is a godsend. It’s bright, funny, and it can save you money, too.”
— Jerome Crowe, reporter, Los Angeles Times
“Eric Tyson has brought his financial experience, investment knowledge,
and down-to-earth writing style to create an outstanding book on mutual
funds for all investors — and an essential book for new investors . . . in
short, a classic. . . .”
— Jack Bogle, former CEO, The Vanguard Group
“This is a great book. It’s understandable. Other financial books are too
technical and this one really is different.”
— Shad Johnson, producer, “Business Radio Network”
“An invaluable, easy-to-read financial help book that should be in every
family’s library.”
— Stan Schaffer, reporter, The Morning Call, Allentown, PA

About the Author
Eric Tyson, MBA, is a former financial counselor, lecturer and coauthor of the
national best-seller, Home Buying For Dummies, as well as the author of four
other best-selling books in the For Dummies series: Personal Finance,
Investing, Mutual Funds, and Taxes (coauthor).
Eric has counseled thousands of clients on a variety of personal finance,
investment, and real estate quandaries and questions. In addition to main-
taining a financial counseling practice, he’s a former lecturer of the San
Francisco Bay Area’s most highly attended financial management course at
the University of California, Berkeley.
Eric is also a syndicated columnist and was an award-winning journalist for
the San Francisco Examiner. His work has been featured and praised in hun-
dreds of national and local publications, including Newsweek, Kiplinger’s, The
Wall Street Journal, Money, The Los Angeles Times, and the Chicago Tribune,
and on NBC’s Today Show, PBS’s Nightly Business Report, CNN, The Oprah
Winfrey Show, ABC, CNBC, Bloomberg Business Radio, CBS National Radio,
and National Public Radio.
A former management consultant to Fortune 500 financial service firms, Eric is
dedicated to teaching people to manage their personal finances better. Over the
past two decades, he has successfully invested in securities as well as in real
estate, started and managed several businesses. He earned his MBA at the
Stanford Graduate School of Business and his bachelor’s degree in economics
at Yale.
Ray Brown, coauthor of the national best-seller Home Buying For Dummies, is
a veteran of the real estate profession with over three decades of hands-on
experience. A former manager for Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage
Company, McGuire Real Estate, Pacific Union GMAC Real Estate, and founder
of his own real estate firm — the Raymond Brown Company — Ray is cur-
rently a writer, consultant, and public speaker on residential real estate topics.
Ray knows that most people are pretty darn smart. When they have prob-
lems, it’s usually because they don’t know the right questions to ask to get
the information they need to make good decisions themselves. He always
wanted to write real estate books that focused readers on what they needed
to know to make sound home-buying and house-selling decisions.
On his way to becoming a real estate guru, Ray worked as the real estate ana-
lyst for KGO-TV (ABC’s affiliate in San Francisco) and as a syndicated real
estate columnist for The San Francisco Examiner. He also hosted a weekly
radio program — The Ray Brown on Real Estate, for KNBR — for 16 years. In
addition to his work for ABC, Ray has appeared as a real estate expert on
CNN, NBC, and CBS and in The Wall Street Journal and TIME.

Ray’s most significant achievements, however, are still Jeff and Jared, his two
incomparable sons, and over 42 years of nearly always wedded bliss to the
always wonderful Annie B. He’s delighted to welcome Jeff’s wife, Genevieve,
and his grandson, Aidan Joseph Brown, to the family.

Dedication
This book is hereby and irrevocably dedicated to my family and friends, as
well as to my counseling clients and customers, who ultimately have taught
me everything I know about how to explain financial terms and strategies so
that everyone may benefit.
— Eric Tyson
This book is lovingly dedicated to Annie B., who makes my heart sing.
— Ray Brown

House Selling For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Introduction
W
elcome to House Selling For Dummies, 3rd Edition, the completely
updated companion to Home Buying For Dummies (also in its 3rd
Edition), the #1 bestselling real estate book (that we also happened to write).
If you’re like most people, your biggest investment is your house. Sell your
house wisely and you not only save yourself loads of time, but you also
pocket thousands — if not tens of thousands — of dollars more than you
would otherwise. Making a big mistake in the sale of your house, on the 
other hand, can easily cost you additional weeks — perhaps even months —
of work and headache, as well as half a year’s worth (or more) of your take-
home income.
One of Ray’s treasures is a well-worn fortune cookie message that says, “A
wise person knows everything. A shrewd person knows everyone.” We apply
that same principle to house sales. Real estate is a team sport. In this book,
we show you how to put together a winning team, and we alert you to key
points to consider throughout your sale. Follow our advice and your house is
as good as sold before the For Sale sign even goes up.
We don’t care about whether you decide to sell your house or how much of
the transaction you attempt to handle yourself. It’s not that we’re insensitive;
we simply don’t have a vested interest in the sale of your house. What we do
care very deeply about is that you make the best possible decisions for your
situation. If those decisions mean staying in your current home instead of
selling, or if they mean selling through a good local real estate agent, that’s
terrific. We wrote this book to help you avoid making mistakes in your selling
decisions and to ensure that you sell your house in the best way possible.
The Eric Tyson/Ray Brown Difference
We’ve received great accolades from the prior editions of this book and for
Home Buying For Dummies. House Selling For Dummies fills a void for house
sellers: It’s a user-friendly book totally oriented to your needs as a seller.
If you’ve visited your local library or bought books on selling your home, you
may be familiar with the shortcomings of most house-selling books. In writing
this book, we attempt to avoid those shortcomings. Thus, we expect that
you’ll find that our book is

2
House Selling For Dummies, 3rd Edition 
 Holistic: No one sells a house just for the sake of selling it. Selling a house
creates tax and financial ramifications, particularly if you’re selling to
buy a more expensive home, relocating to a different part of the country,
or retiring. Most other house-selling books, however, don’t help you con-
sider these bigger-picture issues of personal finance before you sell. In
Part I, we come right out and tell you that some people who are thinking
about selling their current homes shouldn’t.
 Educational: Most house-selling books are written by real estate agents
or their firms. Such books are long on singing the praises of real estate
agents but short on specific advice, helpful tips, and caution signs. That’s
why many of those other books are less than 200 pages long. The authors
aren’t interested in sharing the innermost secrets of selling real estate;
they’re more interested in promoting their own business by convincing
you to use a real estate agent. We wrote this book first and foremost to
educate you. (Of course, if we end up making a few bucks for ourselves
in the process, we won’t complain.)
 Jargon-free: One of the hallmarks of books written more to confuse the
reader than to convey information is the use of all sorts of insider terms
that make things sound more mysterious and complicated than they
really are. In this book, we try to keep everything in plain English. We
even include a glossary, just in case you do encounter a term that
appears to be Greek or Latin to you!
Conventions Used in This Book
When writing this book, we included some general conventions that all For
Dummies books use. We use the following:
 Italic: We italicize any words you may not be familiar with and provide a
definition.
 Boldface type: We bold all keywords in bulleted lists and the actual
steps in numbered lists.
 Monofont: All Web sites and e-mail addresses appear in monofont.
Foolish Assumptions
We’re not trying to scare you — quite the contrary. We just want to make it
clear that, even though selling your house isn’t brain surgery, you can easily
make mistakes, especially if you’re overconfident or do a poor job selecting
people to work with in the transaction. When we wrote this book, we made a
few assumptions about you.

 You’re humble: You realize that you aren’t a house-selling expert.
 You’re smart: Even though you’re not an expert, you realize the value of
getting as much information as you can. This trait bodes well for your
upcoming experience in selling real estate.
Although you’re likely to hire some professionals to help you sell your house,
you still need to educate yourself about all aspects of the transaction. Why?
 You’re the one who ultimately must make the decision about whether or
not, and when, to sell your house. No real estate agent, loan broker, or
anyone else who has a vested interest in the sale can objectively advise
you about whether you should sell your house or when is the best time
for you to sell.
 You’re the one (if you do decide to sell) who must interview and hire
competent and affordable people who can help you with the sale. You
need to know what all the people you hire do, why they do it, what to
expect from them, and what they expect from you.
Oscar Wilde said, “Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.”
We want to add a corollary to this observation: “Learning from other people’s
mistakes is infinitely better than learning from your own.” House Selling For
Dummies saves you money, time, and heartache — but only if you read it!
How This Book Is Organized
Perhaps you’re sure that you want to sell your house. On the other hand,
maybe you (like many people each year who contemplate a sale) aren’t sure
whether you can or should sell. If you do decide to sell your house, you must
face the hard work of picking the best time to sell, preparing your house for
sale, choosing the best people to help you sell, and closing the deal. And,
even after the deal is done, you’re sure to have questions and unresolved
issues. House Selling For Dummies covers everything you need to know.
Part I: The Selling Decision
Even if you think that you can or must sell, consider the big picture before you
take action. This book starts with the premise that many important factors —
financial and personal — should fall into place before you decide to sell your
house. For example, how do you know if you can really afford to sell your house
and buy another home if you haven’t yet considered your overall financial situa-
tion and goals? Without taking stock of important financial and personal issues,
you’re simply guessing, or hoping, that selling is financially feasible and the
right thing to do.
3
Introduction

One element of the decision to sell hinges on the financial ramifications of
selling. Amazingly, most people crunch few, if any, numbers before they decide
to sell their home. Or they leave the financial analysis to a salesperson with a
vested interest in the house-selling transaction. We explain that you don’t
need a PhD in quantum physics or even an interest in mathematics to make
some simple, yet powerful, financial assessments before you sell. We also help
you understand the pros and cons of lending money to the buyer of your
humble abode.
Part II: Tactical Considerations
In this part, we assume that you’ve already made the decision to sell your
house. Now you’re ready to tackle important selling decisions, such as when
to put your house on the market. Because most house sellers buy another
home to replace the one they’re leaving behind, we walk you through the
logistical considerations of whether you should sell your current house
before buying the next one or purchase your next home before cutting the
cord to your current house.
This part also covers all the issues relating to how you’re going to get your
house sold. Are you going to try selling it yourself, or are you going to hire 
a real estate agent? We also explain the other players that you may want or
need to include on your house-selling team, and we tell you how to choose
the best people in their respective fields. Finally, if you’ve chosen to sell your
house through a real estate agent, we walk you through the all-important list-
ing contract that you complete with the agent and his or her firm, and explain
the best ways to negotiate the commission for the sale of your house.
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell
Before you actually put your house on the market, read all our best tips for
preparing your property to look appealing to prospective buyers (and real
estate agents that many of them work with). Next comes the critical decision
of determining the asking price for your house. Just as Goldilocks was look-
ing for a bowl of porridge that was the right temperature, you don’t want to
over-price or under-price your home; you want to price it just right. In this
part, we show you how.
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of 
Getting Your House Sold
After you price your house and put it on the market, the actual marketing of
the property begins. In this part, we review different marketing methods and
4
House Selling For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

then explain how to choose those strategies that are best for your property. If
you follow our advice up to this point in the book, you can bet that an offer
or two will come rolling in before you know it.
Although you’ve probably never aspired to be Secretary of State, you (and
your agent, if you’re working with one) do need to know how to keep your
composure and use proven negotiating tactics to get what you want and
make the buyers of your house feel good about the deal they’re getting. We
also guide you through the final steps of your sale, including the escrow
process and the money transfer. And, last but not least, we walk you through
the unavoidable tax hoops you need to jump through when you sell your house.
Part V: The Part of Tens
This part provides counsel and advice on shorter topics that seem to stand
alone well. Here, we explain ten important things to remember to do after
your house sale is complete, our top ten tips for successfully selling rental
real estate, and how to handle ten difficult questions you may be asked about
selling your house. If you have a short attention span, or if you like the feeling
you get from completing chapters, this part’s for you!
Part VI: Appendixes
Appendixes are typically a tad dull and probably aren’t the first thing you want
to read in a book. On the other hand, the appendixes in this book include
examples of important documents that can help enhance your house-selling
knowledge. In this part, we provide an example of a premarketing inspection
report and a real estate purchase contract and receipt for deposit. Finally, we
include a handy glossary to define real estate terms that often sound like Pig
Latin, unless you happen to sell real estate for a living (in which case, they
probably sound very sensible).
Icons Used in This Book
Just as you use tasty seasonings in your favorite recipes, we’ve sprinkled
helpful icons throughout this book to draw attention to key points or to
denote stuff that you can skip over.
This icon flags key strategies that can improve your real estate deal and, in
some cases, save you mounds of moola. Think of these icons as pointing out
little words of wisdom that we would whisper in your ear if we were close
enough to do so.

Introduction

Numerous booby-traps await novices as well as experienced house sellers.
This explosive symbol marks those mines and tells you how to sidestep them.
Occasionally, we suggest that you do more research or homework. Don’t
worry; we tell you exactly how to go about your investigation.
Unfortunately, as is the case in all realms of the business world, some people
and companies are more interested in short-term profits than in meeting your
needs and addressing your concerns. This icon highlights places in a house-
selling transaction where sharks may be swimming and points to advice on
avoiding such scoundrels.
To ensure that you don’t forget important points, this icon serves as your little
reminder, like a string tied around your finger.
This icon marks stuff that you don’t really have to know, but that may come
in handy at cocktail parties thrown by people in the real estate business.
This icon points out the best resources and techniques for selling your 
property faster, more profitably, and with less hassle.
Where to Go from Here
You don’t need to read this book cover to cover. But if you’re a beginner or you
want to fully immerse yourself in the world of house selling, go for it! However,
you may have a specific question or two today and want some other informa-
tion tomorrow. No problem there, either. House Selling For Dummies, 3rd Edition,
is lighter on its feet and easier to use than other house selling reference books.
Use the Table of Contents or the Index to speed your way toward what you
need to know and get on with your life.

House Selling For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Part I
The Selling
Decision

In this part . . .
W
e help you tackle the big-picture issues that you must
face before selling your house. To begin with, we ask
you to consider whether you should even sell your house in
the first place. Do you need to sell or do you just want to
sell? Wanting to sell isn’t a bad thing, but selling and moving
can wreak havoc with your pocketbook if you don’t first
study the financial ramifications. We walk you through your
options and assist you with making the selling decision.
And before you sell your house, you need to figure out
how much you’ll net from the transaction. Unless you’re
quite affluent, you’re going to need to know how much
money to put toward your next place, your retirement
nest egg, or whatever else you envision doing with the
proceeds. We tell you how to come up with an accurate
estimate, not a “guesstimate.” We also encourage you to
think through another important issue before you put up
your For Sale sign: Are you interested, willing, and able to
provide financing to a prospective buyer of your house?

Chapter 1
Deciding to Sell
In This Chapter
 Making the choice: To sell or not to sell
 Selling in weak and strong housing markets
S
elling your house and moving can be an enjoyable (not to mention prof-
itable) experience. Unfortunately, for most people, it isn’t. Selling a house
not only introduces financial turmoil into most people’s lives but also causes
them stress.
One goal of this book is to help you make the right decision about whether to
sell your house. If you do decide to sell, we want to make sure that you get as
many dollars and as few upset stomachs from the sale as possible.
The reasons people want to sell their houses are almost as varied as the
houses themselves. Here are some of the common, not-so common, and
downright bizarre reasons:
 Additional debt burden because of layoff, medical expenses, disability,
or overspending
 Bad vibes or bad luck associated with house
 Better job opportunities elsewhere
 Diminished space requirements now that children are grown
 House located in a flood, earthquake, or other disaster zone
 Increased space requirements for expanding family
 Lack of garage
 Neighborhood conditions incompatible with socioeconomic status
 Noisy neighborhood
 Noisy/messy/obnoxious family or business moved next door
 Recent death of spouse
 Recent marriage or divorce

 Serious house defects (such as radon or termites) that owners don’t
want to fix
 Unfriendly neighbors
 Unsafe neighborhood
 Unsatisfactory neighborhood shopping
 Unsatisfactory school district
 Unsuitable climate
As you can see from this partial list, most of the reasons why people have a
desire to sell their houses are based on wants, not needs. In the United States,
we sometimes take for granted how economically fortunate we are.
You don’t need to move because your neighborhood is too noisy or because
your house seems too small. You don’t need to move because the weather 
in your area isn’t nice enough. You don’t need to live on quieter, tree-lined
streets.
All these features are things people want, not things they need. And people
who think that they can afford to pay for such things usually get more of what
they want. Sometimes, however, people spend money moving and, ironically,
still don’t get what they want. The weather in the new locale may not be ter-
rific, the neighbors may not be friendly and quiet, and the schools may not
turn children into stellar students. You may move to get away from particular
problems and then find yourself facing a new set of different problems.
We’re certainly not going to tell you how and where to spend your money —
that’s your choice. However, we definitely want you to make the most of your
money. Unless you’re one of the few who has far more money than you can
ever possibly spend, we suggest that you prioritize the demands on your
money to accomplish your most important financial goals.
Nothing’s wrong with spending money to trade in one house for another, but
before you set those wheels in motion, think about the impact of that kind of
spending on other aspects of your life. The more that you spend on housing,
the less you’ll have for your other goals, such as saving for retirement, taking
annual vacations, and spending less time working and more time with your
family and friends.
Figuring Out if You Really Need to Sell
Although spending your entire life in the first home you buy is an unlikely
prospect, some people do end up living in the same home for 10, 20, even 30
or more years. Ray (humble coauthor of this book), for example, lived in his
home nearly 30 years. Ray’s no fool; staying put must have its advantages.
10
Part I: The Selling Decision 

If, like most prospective house sellers, you have a choice between staying put
and selling, not selling has clear advantages. Selling your house and then
buying another one takes a great deal of legwork and research time on your
part. Whether you sell your house yourself or hire an agent, you’re going to
be heavily involved in getting your house ready for sale and keeping it pristine
while it’s on the market.
In addition to time, selling your house and buying another one can cost serious
money. Between real estate commissions, loan fees, title insurance, transfer
tax, and myriad other costs of selling your house and then buying another
one, you can easily spend 15 percent or more of the value of the property
that you’re selling (see bar on the left in Figure 1-1).
Fifteen percent sounds like a lot, doesn’t it? Well, consider this: Unless you
own your house free and clear of any mortgage debt, your transaction costs
are going to gobble up an even larger percentage of the money you’ve
invested in your home.

Chapter 1: Deciding to Sell

Check out this scenario: You’re thinking about selling your $240,000 house. If
selling your house and buying another one costs you 15 percent of the first
house’s value, then you’re taking $36,000 out of your sale proceeds. However,
if you happen to owe $180,000 on your mortgage, your equity in the home —
the difference between the amount the house is worth ($240,000) and the
amount you owe ($180,000) — is $60,000. Therefore, the $36,000 in transaction
costs devours a huge 60 percent of your equity (see bar on the right in 
Figure 1-1). Ouch!
Before spending that much of your hard-earned money, make sure that you
give careful thought and consideration to why you want to sell, the financial
consequences of selling, and the alternatives to selling. In Chapters 2 and 3,
we walk you through the personal financial issues that you need to weigh
when contemplating the sale of your current house. But before we get to the
numbers, consider the qualitative issues.
Good reasons to stay
Whereas some people have clear and compelling reasons for selling their
homes, others do so for the wrong reasons. You don’t want to make the 
financially painful mistake of selling if you don’t have to or can’t afford to.
The following sections offer reasons why you may be better off staying right
where you are.
You’re already having trouble living within your means
If you’re having difficulty making ends meet, and you use high-interest con-
sumer credit, such as credit cards or auto loans, to maintain your desired
standard of living, you shouldn’t spend more money on housing. Even if
you’re planning to trade your current house for one of comparable value, 
you may not be able to afford all the transaction costs of selling and buying.
Even if you aren’t a consumer-debt user and you’re saving a comfortable por-
tion (10 percent or more) of your current earnings, don’t assume that you can
afford to trade up to a more expensive home. In addition to a higher mortgage
payment, you may also face increased property taxes, insurance rates, and
home maintenance costs.
A mortgage lender may be willing to finance a loan that enables you to trade
up to a more expensive home, but qualifying for a loan doesn’t mean that you
can afford that home. Mortgage lenders use simplistic formulas, based pri-
marily on your income, to determine the amount they’re willing to lend you.
Mortgage lenders don’t know (or care) how far behind you are in saving for
your retirement or how many children you must help with college costs or
how much assistance you want or need to give to elderly parents.
12
Part I: The Selling Decision 

Mortgage lenders are concerned about protecting their interests in the event
that you default on your mortgage. As long as you meet a few minimal finan-
cial requirements (you make a sufficient down payment, and your housing
expenses are less than a certain percentage of your income), the mortgage
lenders can sell your loan with the backing of a government mortgage agency,
effectively wiping their hands clean of you and your problems.
If you’re thinking about trading in your current house for another one, espe-
cially for a more expensive one, you absolutely, positively must consider the
financial repercussions of changed housing expenses in addition to the costs
of buying and selling. We cover these important issues in Chapters 2 and 3.
The problems are more in your perceptions
Everybody, at some point, leaps to conclusions based on faulty assumptions
or incomplete research in virtually all aspects their lives. Peter, for example,
was a single parent living with his son in a nice neighborhood in an urban
environment. When his son started junior high school, Peter grew increas-
ingly concerned with the possibility that his son would become involved 
with drugs, which seemed to be so prevalent in their city.
Despite working in the city, Peter decided to move to an easygoing, suburban
community about 45 minutes outside the city. Shortly after the move, Peter’s
son got mixed up with drugs anyway — perhaps, in part, because the long
daily commute meant that Peter was around even less.
In addition to ignoring lifestyle issues (such as the length of his commute),
Peter made a common human mistake — he assumed that things were a par-
ticular way without getting the facts. The reality was that the suburban com-
munity to which Peter moved had as many problems with teenagers on drugs
as the good neighborhoods in his former city.
Crime and safety make up another common realm where people have miscon-
ceptions. Some communities often make the evening news with graphic stories
and film footage of crimes. Statistically, however, most crimes committed in a
given city or town occur in fairly small geographic areas. Local police depart-
ments tabulate neighborhood crime rates. If you’re concerned about crime and
safety, don’t guess; get the facts by calling your local police department and
asking them how to obtain the data.
Schools are another hot-button issue. In some areas, people make blanket
statements condemning all public schools. They also insist that if you live in
such-and-such town or city, you must send your children to private school if
you want them to get a good education. The reality, as education experts
(and good old-fashioned common sense) suggest, is that you can find good
and bad public schools and good and bad private schools. You also need to
evaluate if you’re spending too many hours working and commuting just so
you can make expensive school payments. If that’s the case, you may not be
able to spend adequate time with your children. The best possible teacher
for your children is you.

Chapter 1: Deciding to Sell

Selling won’t solve the problem(s)
Avoiding problems is another human tendency. That’s what Fred and Ethel
tried to do. Much to their chagrin, Fred and Ethel discovered that their home
had two not-so-visible but, unfortunately, costly-to-fix problems. The new roof
they needed was going to cost big bucks, because local ordinances required
the removal of several layers of existing roofing material when a new roof was
installed. Fred and Ethel also had recently found out that their house contained
asbestos, a known carcinogen.
Rather than research and deal with these problems, Fred and Ethel decided
that the easiest solution was to sell their house and buy another one in a nearby
town where they thought they’d be happy. They then attempted to sell their
home without disclosing these known defects — a major legal no-no, as we
point out in Chapter 8 — but were tripped up by smart buyers who found out
about the problems from inspectors they hired to check out the property.
Actually, the prospective buyers did Fred and Ethel two big favors:
 By uncovering the problems early, the buyers saved Fred and Ethel from
a costly lawsuit that could easily have resulted if the flaws were discov-
ered after the house was sold.
 By ultimately deciding to hold onto their home, which they otherwise
were content with, Fred and Ethel saved themselves thousands of dollars
in selling and buying transaction costs. Those savings more than paid
for the cost of a new roof. And Fred and Ethel discovered that, because
the asbestos was in good condition and properly contained, it was best
left alone.
You can fix some or all the problems
When they realized that they couldn’t run from their home’s problems, Fred
and Ethel, discussed in the preceding section, discovered how to get those
problems fixed. You can address quite a number of possible shortcomings in
your home less expensively than buying a new home.
If you think that home improvement projects are going to be too expensive, do
some rough calculations to determine the cost of selling your current house
and then buying another. Remember, you can easily spend 15 percent of the
house’s value on all the transaction costs of selling and then buying again.
Instead of trading houses, why not spend those transaction dollars on improv-
ing the home you currently own? Do you hate the carpeting and paint job?
Get new carpets and repaint. If your home is a tad too small, consider adding
on a room or two. Just be careful not to turn your home into a castle if all the
surrounding houses are shacks. Overimproving your property can be an
expensive mistake. By overimproving, we mean that after the improvements
to your house, you’ll own the most expensive house on the block, and you’ll
have difficulty recouping the cost of the improvements in the form of a higher
house sale price.
14
Part I: The Selling Decision 

Some people are seduced by the seeming better attributes of other houses on
the market. If your house is small, larger ones seem more appealing. If you
don’t like your carpeting, houses that have hardwood floors may attract 
you. However, as is true of long-term friends or spouses, you know your cur-
rent home’s defects all too well because you’ve probably lived with them for
years. Unless you’re incredibly observant, you surely didn’t know half your
home’s faults and shortcomings before you moved in. The same is true of new
homes you may be lusting after.
Some problems and defects are more easily fixed and more worth fixing than
others. When you’re deciding whether to fix problems or move away from
them, consider these important issues:
 What’s the payback? Some home remodeling projects may actually pay
for or come close to paying for themselves. We’re not suggesting that you
can have the work done for free. However, certain remodeling projects
do increase your home’s value by enough to make up for most or even
all the cost of the improvement(s).
Generally speaking, projects that increase the cosmetic appeal or usabil-
ity of living space tend to be more financially worthwhile than projects
that don’t. For example, consider painting and recarpeting a home versus
fixing its foundation. The former projects are visible and, if done well,
enhance a home’s value; the latter project doesn’t add to the visible
appeal of the home or usability of living space. If, however, you must do
foundation repairs or the house will collapse, spend your money on 
the foundation.
If you decide to stay put and renovate or improve your current home,
you’re going to need to find a way to pay for all that work. In Chapter 4,
we discuss the way to figure out the amount you can afford to spend
improving and how to actually finance your improvements. If you head
down the renovation path, don’t forget that contracting work often ends
up costing more than you (and your contractor) originally expected.
 How intrusive will the work be? As you surely know, money isn’t every-
thing. Six months into a home remodeling project that moves you out of
your bedroom, spreads sawdust all over your kitchen table, and has you
wanting to flee the country, the “payback” on the project doesn’t seem so
important anymore. In addition to costing more than most parties expect,
contracting work almost always takes longer than everyone expects.
Ask yourself and others who’ve endured similar projects: How much will
this project disrupt my life? Your contract with the contractor should
include financial penalties for not finishing on time.
Some problems or shortcomings of your current house simply can’t be fixed.
If you’re tired of shoveling snow in the winter and dripping sweat in the
summer, you’re not going to be able to change your local weather. If crime is
indeed a big problem, you yourself aren’t going to be able to cut area crime
anytime soon. Moving may be the best solution.
15
Chapter 1: Deciding to Sell

Reasons to consider selling
If you’re in a situation where you really need to sell, as opposed to wanting to
sell, by all means put your house on the market. And if you want to sell, and
can afford to do so, you should go for it, as well. The following sections offer
some solid reasons for selling.
You can afford to trade homes
Your desire to sell your current house and buy another one may be driven by
a force as frivolous as sheer boredom. But if you can afford to sell and buy
again, and you know what you’re getting into, why not?
Now, defining afford is important. By afford, we mean that you’ve identified
your personal and financial goals and you’ve calculated that the cost of trad-
ing houses won’t compromise those goals.
Everyone has unique goals, but if you’re like most people, you probably don’t
want to spend the rest of your life working full-time. To retire or semi-retire,
you’re going to need to save quite a bit of money during your working years.
If you haven’t yet crunched any numbers to see where you stand in terms of
retirement saving, postpone major real estate decisions until you explore your
financial future. In Chapter 2, we walk you through the important retirement
planning considerations in selling your house, and in Chapter 3, we show you
how to calculate the economics of selling and moving.
You need to move for your job
Some people find that at particular points in their lives they need to move to
take advantage of a career opportunity. For example, if you want to be involved
with technology companies, certain regions of the country offer far greater
opportunities than others.
When you lack employment, paying bills is difficult, especially the costs
involved in home ownership. If you’ve lost your job or your employer
demands that you relocate to keep your job, you may feel a real need to
move, especially in a sluggish economy.
Moving for a better job (or simply for a job) is a fine thing to do. However, some
people fool themselves into believing that a higher-paying job or a move to an
area with lower housing costs will put them on an easier financial street. As
we discuss in Chapter 3, you must consider all the costs of living in a new area
versus your current area before deciding that moving to a new community is
financially wise.
And, although we don’t pretend to be career counselors, we want you to con-
sider that you may be overlooking opportunities right in your own backyard.
Just because your employer offers you a better job to get you to relocate
doesn’t mean that you can’t bargain for a promotion and stay put 
16
Part I: The Selling Decision 

geographically. Likewise, during an economic slowdown, if your employer says
you must relocate or face downsizing, explore other employment options in
your area, especially if you want to stay put.
You’re having (or will have) financial trouble
Sometimes, people fall on difficult financial times because of an unexpected
event. Check out these two scenarios:
 After Ryan graduated from college, he landed a good marketing job and
seemed financially secure. So he bought a home. After a few years in the
home, Ryan discovered that he had a chronic medical problem.
Ultimately, Ryan decided to go into a lower-stress job and work part time.
As a result, his income significantly decreased while his medical expenses
increased. He no longer could afford his home. It made sense for Ryan to
sell his house and move into lower-cost housing that better addressed
his reduced mobility.
 When Teri and her husband bought a home, they were both holding
down high-paying jobs. Unfortunately, two years later, Teri discovered
that her husband had an affair. After much marital counseling and many
attempts to get their marriage on a better track, Teri and her husband
divorced. Because neither of them alone could afford the costs of the
house, Teri and her husband needed to sell.
In addition to unexpected events, some people simply live beyond their
means and can’t keep their heads above the financial water of large mortgage
payments and associated housing costs. Sometimes, people get bogged down
with additional consumer debt because they stretched themselves too much
when buying their home.
17
Chapter 1: Deciding to Sell
Patience — not money — solves some problems
Some problems may solve themselves if you’re
patient and willing to wait things out. For exam-
ple, Eric (humble coauthor of this book) once
lived a block away from a busy California free-
way. Although adequate fencing and safety 
barriers separated the speeding cars on the
highway from the neighborhood, the noise was
a bit of a nuisance, especially during peak com-
mute hours.
The longer Eric, who was raised in a quiet non-
urban environment, lived in the home, the more
the noise bugged him. Within several years of
having bought the home, however, the problem
was solved. Expansion of the freeway forced
the state to add sound walls, which greatly
dampened the noise and enhanced home
values in the area.

Selling your house and moving to a lower-cost housing option may be just
what the financial doctor ordered. On the other hand, if you can bring your
spending under control and pay off those consumer debts, maybe you can
afford to remain in your present home. Be sure that you’re being honest with
yourself and realistic about your ability to accomplish your goals given your
continuing housing expenses (see Chapter 2 for more information).
You’re retiring
If you decide to call it quits on the full-time working life, you may find yourself
with more house than you need, or you may wish to move to a less costly area.
Instead of trading up, you may consider trading down.
You can free up some of the cash you’ve tied up in your current house and
use that money to help finance your retirement by moving to a less expensive
home. If you’re otherwise happy with where you’re currently living, don’t
think that you must trade down to a less expensive home simply to tap the
equity in your current property. As we discuss in Chapter 2, you can tap your
home’s equity through other methods, such as taking out a reverse mortgage.
Your house is associated with bad feelings
As with other financial decisions, choosing to sell or buy a home isn’t only
about money. Human emotions and memories can be just as powerful and
just as real factors to consider.
If your spouse or child has passed away, you divorced, or your house was
burglarized, the property may be a constant source of bad feelings. Although
selling your house and moving won’t make your troubles go away, being in a
new home in a different area or neighborhood may help you get on with your
life and not dwell excessively on your recent unpleasant experiences. Just be
sure to temper your emotions with a realistic look at your financial situation.
Knowing the Health of 
Your Housing Market
Your personal financial situation clearly is an important factor in deciding
whether and when to sell your house, but the state of your local housing
market may also influence your decision. Check out the following sections 
for the lowdown on the housing market and how it affects your sale.
18
Part I: The Selling Decision 

Selling in a depressed housing market
No one likes to lose money. If you scraped and saved for years for the down
payment to buy a home, finding out that your house is worth less than the
amount you paid for it can be quite a blow. Between the decline in the market
value of your home and the selling costs, you may possibly even lose your
entire invested down payment. And you thought the stock market was risky!
In the worst cases we’ve seen, some homeowners find themselves upside down,
which simply means that the mortgage on the house exceeds the amount for
which the house can be sold. In other words, upside-down homeowners liter-
ally have to pay money to sell their houses because they’ve lost more than
their original down payment. Ouch!
When deciding whether to sell in a depressed market, consider the factors
discussed in the following sections.
If you still have adequate equity
Although your local real estate market may have recently declined, if you’ve
owned your house long enough or made a large enough down payment, you
still may be able to net a good deal of cash by selling. If you can make enough
money to enable yourself to buy another home, we say don’t sweat the fact
that your local real estate market may currently be depressed. As long as the
sale fits in with your overall financial situation, sell your house and get on
with your life!
All real estate markets go through up cycles and down cycles. Over the long
term, however, housing prices tend to increase. So, if you sell a house or two
during a down market, odds are you’ll also sell a house or two during better
market conditions. And if you’re staying in the same area or moving to another
depressed housing market, you’re simply trading one reduced-price house
for another. If you’re moving to a more expensive market or a market cur-
rently doing better than the one you’re leaving, be sure that spending more
on housing doesn’t compromise your long-term personal and financial goals
(see Chapter 2).
If you lack enough money to buy your next home
Sometimes, homeowners find themselves in a situation where, if they sell, they
won’t have enough money to buy their next home. If you find yourself in such
a circumstance, first clarify whether you want or need to sell:
19
Chapter 1: Deciding to Sell

 If you want to sell but don’t need to and can avoid selling for a while, we
say wait it out. Otherwise, if you sell and then don’t have adequate money
to buy your next home, you may find yourself in the unfortunate position
of being a renter when the local real estate market turns the corner and
starts improving again. So you’ll have sold low and later be forced to buy
high. You’ll need to have an even greater down payment to get back into
the market, or you’ll be forced to buy a more modest house.
 If you need to sell, you have a tougher road ahead of you. You must hope
that the real estate market where you buy won’t rocket ahead while you’re
trying to accumulate a larger down payment. However, you may also
want to look into methods for buying a home with a smaller down pay-
ment. For example, a benevolent family member may help you out, the
person selling you your new home may lend you some money, or you
may decide to take out one of the low-down-payment loans that some
mortgage lenders offer. If prices do rise at a fast rate, you can either set
your sights on a different market or lower your expectations for the kind
of home you’re going to buy.
If you must move or relocate and don’t want to sell in a depressed market,
you can rent out your home until the market turns around. Be sure that
you understand the tax consequences of this arrangement, which we
cover in detail in Chapter 2. Before becoming a landlord, consider your
ability to deal with the hassles that come with the territory. You must also
educate yourself on local rent-control ordinances and compare your
property’s monthly expenses with the rental income that you’ll collect.
(We explain how to calculate the difference between a property’s income
and expenses in the sidebar, “Figuring the cash flow on rental property.”)
If you’re going to lose money each month, the constant cash drain may
handicap your future ability to save, in addition to increasing your total
losses on the property.
Selling during a strong market
What could be better than selling your house during a time of rising or already-
elevated home prices? If you can afford the transaction costs of selling your
current house and buying another home, and if the costs of the new home fit
within your budget and financial goals, go for it.
Just be careful of two things:
 Don’t get greedy and grossly overprice your house. You may end up get-
ting less from the sale than you expected, and the sale is likely to take
much longer than if you’d priced the property fairly. If you price your
house too high, when you finally drop the price to the right range, you
may face lower offers because your house has the stigma of being old on
the market. In Chapter 11, we detail how to price your house for a quick
sale that gets you top dollar.
20
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 If you’re staying in your current strong market or moving to another strong
market, be careful about timing the sale of your current house and the pur-
chase of your next one. For example, you probably don’t want to sell and
then spend months bidding unsuccessfully on other homes. You may get
stuck renting for a while and need to make an additional move; such costs
can eat up the cash from your recent sale and interfere with your ability to
afford your next home. In Chapter 5, we explain how to time the sale of
your house and the subsequent purchase of your new home.
21
Chapter 1: Deciding to Sell
Figuring the cash flow on rental property
Cash flow is the difference between the amount
of money that a property brings in and the amount
you have to pay out for expenses. Some home-
owners-turned-rental-property-owners can’t
cover all the costs associated with rental prop-
erty. In the worst cases, such property owners
end up in personal bankruptcy from the drain of
negative cash flow (that is, expenses exceed
income). In other cases, the negative cash flow
hampers property owners’ ability to accomplish
important financial goals such as saving for
retirement or helping with their children’s college
expenses.
Before you consider becoming a landlord, make
some projections about what you expect your
property’s monthly income and expenses to be.
Income
On the income side, determine the amount of
rent you’re able to charge:
 Take a look at what comparable properties
currently are renting for in your local
market.
 Check out the classified ads in your local
paper(s).
 Speak with some leasing agents at real
estate rental companies.
Be sure to allow for some portion (around 5 per-
cent per year) of the time for your property to be
vacant — finding good tenants takes time.
Expenses
On the expense side, you have your monthly
mortgage payment (of which we’re sure that
you’re already painfully aware). And, of course,
you have property taxes. Because you probably
pay them only once or twice yearly, divide the
annual amount by 12 to arrive at your monthly
property tax bill.
You may end up paying some or all your renter’s
utility bills, such as garbage, water, or gas.
Estimate from your own usage what the monthly
tab will be. Expect most utility bills to increase a
bit because tenants will probably waste more
when you’re picking up the bill.
Be sure to ask your insurance company about
how your property insurance premium changes
if you convert the property into a rental. As is
true with your property taxes, divide the annual
total by 12 to get a monthly amount.
Don’t forget repairs and maintenance. Expect to
spend about 1 percent of the property’s value
per year on maintenance, repairs, and cleaning.
Again, divide by 12 to get a monthly figure.
Finding good tenants takes time and promotion.
If you choose to list through them, rental bro-
kers normally take one month’s rent as their cut.
If you advertise, estimate at least $100 to $200 in
advertising expenses, not to mention the cost of
your time in showing the property to prospec-
tive tenants. You must also plan on running
credit checks on prospective tenants.
(continued)

22
Part I: The Selling Decision 
Estimated cash flow
Now, total all the monthly expenses and sub-
tract that number from your estimated monthly
income after allowing for some vacancy time.
Voilà! You’ve just calculated your property’s
cash flow.
If you have a negative cash flow, you may actu-
ally be close to breaking even when you factor
in a rental property tax write-off known as
depreciation. You break down the purchase of
your property between the building, which is
depreciable, and land, which isn’t depreciable.
You can make this allocation based on the
assessed value for the land and the building or
on a real estate appraisal. Residential property
is depreciated over 271⁄2 years at a rate of 3.64
percent of the building value per year. For exam-
ple, if you buy a residential rental property for
$250,000, and $175,000 of that amount is allo-
cated to the building, that allocation means that
you can take $6,370 per year as a depreciation
tax deduction ($175,000 × .0364).
After you’ve crunched all these numbers, if you
find that you’re still interested in renting your
property, be sure to read Chapter 2, especially
the section dealing with the tax consequences
of converting your home into a rental property.

B
uying a home can seriously shake up your personal finances. But selling
your house and then buying another one generally leads to even bigger
financial shock waves. If you’re considering the sale of your house, you may
think, “No big deal. After all, the sale will pay off my mortgage debt and bring
a big chunk of money my way. What do I have to stress over?”
In fact, the financial consequences of selling your house can be serious, espe-
cially if you’re trading up to a more expensive home. You must be well pre-
pared and alert as you sail through the often-treacherous waters of house
selling. Consider this chapter your first mate, helping you make all the best
moves you can.
Trading Up
Many people who still are in their prime working years and who want to sell
their houses and buy others in the same general geographic areas are plan-
ning to trade up, which usually means moving into a “better” — and, there-
fore, more expensive — home. The desire to trade up is only natural; people
usually want their next car, their next job, and their next set of living room or
bedroom furniture to be better than the last. After all, you work hard for a
living; you deserve “better.”
A nicer neighborhood, better schools, more rooms, bigger rooms, more luxu-
rious bathrooms, a more spacious kitchen, better shopping nearby, a bigger
yard, better parking and storage space — the list of things that can be better
in your life is limitless. Your budget, on the other hand, is not.

24
Part I: The Selling Decision 
Although you may want all these extra features and amenities in the next home
that you buy, those extra goodies are going to cost more money — in some
cases, much more. So, unless you’ve recently won the lottery or earned a huge
windfall from stock options or the like, you’re going to have to prioritize your
desires. You can’t have it all — only what fits with your budget and longer-
term financial and personal plans.
Examining your housing budget
Before you set out to trade in your current house for a “better” one, you need
to take a good look at your overall budget and determine how much more, if
any, of your monthly spending can go toward housing costs. If you haven’t
examined your monthly budget in a while, now is the time to do so — before
you set the wheels in motion to trade up.
Get out your checkbook register, credit card statements, paycheck stub, most
recent year’s tax return, and anything else that documents where you’ve
been spending your money during the past six to 12 months. You may also
need to do some tracking or estimating of cash purchases that don’t leave a
paper trail. Table 2-1 can help you to organize your spending by category.

Amount saved (subtract 
“Total spending” line 
from “Income”)
Figuring your expected expenses 
after trading up
Knowing how you spend your money now on housing and other items is only
half the picture. You also need to know how much you’ll spend after buying
your next home.
In Table 2-1, we shaded the Housing expenses category in the “Current” and
“Expected” columns for a reason. These expenses probably are going to
change the most when you sell your current house and buy a new home.
To help you fill in the holes in the expected costs column, check out these
areas:
26
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 Mortgage payment: Unless you’ve been squirreling away extra savings
while living in your current house, the total amount you’re borrowing
through your mortgage (and, therefore, your monthly mortgage payment)
will probably increase if you trade up. By using our handy-dandy mort-
gage payment calculator in Table 2-2, you can calculate the approximate
monthly mortgage payment you’ll face in your new home.
To calculate your monthly loan payment, multiply the relevant number
from Table 2-2 by the total amount that you’re borrowing, expressed in
(that is to say, divided by) thousands of dollars. So, for example, if you
intend to borrow $150,000 at 8 percent interest on a 30-year mortgage,
you multiply 150 by 7.34 (from Table 2-2) to come up with a monthly
payment of $1,101.
 Property taxes: In most communities, the annual property taxes that you
pay on your next home purchase initially are set at a percentage of the
property value. To find out the property tax rate in the area where you
plan to purchase your new home, simply call the local tax collector,
assessor, or other taxing authority (you can locate those phone numbers
in the government section of your local phone directory).
Don’t base your property tax estimate on the amount that the seller of
the home you’re interested in buying is currently paying or on the amount
you’re paying on your present house. When you trade up, the taxes on
the home may be reassessed upward.
 Utilities: If you’re trading up, some of your utility bills — such as cable
TV — may stay the same, but others may change. Until you have in mind
a specific home to buy, you can’t request hard numbers on utility usage.
In the interim, make some educated estimates.
For example, if you’re planning on moving into a larger home in your area
with, say, 30 percent more square footage, you can estimate that your
heating and electric bills will increase by about 30 percent. However, if
you’re moving from an old, energy-inefficient home into a newer and more
efficient one, the new home may not cost you more in utilities even if it’s
a bit larger.
 Furniture: If you buy a larger home, you’ll have more space to fill, so
you’re probably going to spend more money on furnishings. Make a rea-
sonable estimate of how much you expect to spend on new furnishings.
If and when you actually trade up, remember the amount that you bud-
geted for new furnishings; some trade-up buyers get carried away with
redecorating and decimate their budgets after they move into their new
properties.
 Maintenance: If you’re buying a more expensive home, you’re probably
also going to spend more on maintenance, even if the home isn’t a fixer-
upper. A good way to estimate your annual maintenance costs is to mul-
tiply the purchase price of the home by 1 percent (use 1.25 percent of
the purchase price for older and more run-down properties).

Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances

 Federal and state income taxes: If you buy a more expensive home and
have larger mortgage payments and property taxes, your income tax bill
will probably go down. Why? Mortgage interest and property taxes are
deductible expenses on Schedule A of your federal income tax Form
1040 and on most state returns. See the sidebar “Estimating how your
taxes may change if you trade up,” later in this chapter.
 Homeowners insurance: If you buy a more expensive home, your home-
owners insurance premiums may increase. In the absence of a specific
quote for a property you’re interested in buying, you can estimate that
your homeowners insurance costs will increase in proportion to the
increased size (square footage) of your home. Because land isn’t
insured, ignore the extra land that may come with your next home.

Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances

Some lucky folks can squeeze higher housing costs into their budgets with-
out having to cut spending in other expense categories or fall short of their
savings goals. If your budget has that much padding, terrific!
But most people need to cut some fat from their budgets to afford spending
more on housing. If you hope to someday retire or be able to help pay for a
portion of your children’s college costs, you have to be realistic about how
much you need to save and how much you can afford to spend on housing
and other expenses.
Determining the financial impact 
on your future goals
Before you trade up to a more expensive home, in addition to analyzing how
the move affects your current financial picture, you also need to examine
how it’s going to affect your future financial goals.
One such goal that many people share is to enjoy a comfortable retirement. If
you completed Table 2-1 earlier in this chapter, you can see that the additional
monthly housing expenses from a trade up put the squeeze on — and can
possibly even eliminate — your ability to save money. And, as we explain in
the nearby sidebar, “Estimating how your taxes may change if you trade up,”
if you end up contributing less to your tax-deductible retirement savings
plans, your income taxes will increase.
Before you even consider trading up to a more expensive home, do yourself a
big favor and make some savings calculations for your retirement and other
important financial goals. If you completed the budgeting exercise in Table 2-1
(earlier in this chapter), you have a good idea about how much you’re cur-
rently saving from your monthly income and how much you may save if you
trade up. Of course, you may discover that you aren’t even saving enough
money right now, before trading up, to meet your long-term goals. In this case,
trading up to a more expensive home is highly inadvisable.
Exploring the other costs of trading up
If you trade up to a more expensive home, your ongoing, monthly housing
expenses are sure to increase. But that isn’t all the additional costs that you’ll
encounter.
Finding a new home to buy and selling your current one requires that you
expend dozens, perhaps even hundreds, of hours of your precious free time.
And if you hire real estate agents and others to help you with all the transac-
tions, you’re going to spend a good deal of money for their services.
30
Part I: The Selling Decision 

And then there’s moving — a stressful, time-consuming ordeal to get all your
belongings (and family members!) to your new abode. Unless you have scads
of free time and enjoy hauling heavy boxes and furniture, you’re likely to end
up spending thousands of dollars paying a moving company to help you.
Before you go in search of your next great home, you need to understand all
the one-time fees involved in trading up and moving. Otherwise, you may run
out of money and be forced to use high-interest consumer credit, or worse. In
Chapter 3, we walk you through all the important considerations and calcula-
tions so that you don’t have any financial surprises upsetting your proposed
move.
Making Retirement Housing Decisions
If you’re an older homeowner, your home equity — the difference between the
market value of your home and the outstanding mortgage(s) on it — can be one
of your largest (if not your largest) assets. Many folks nearing retirement and
retirees who own their homes find that their home equity is surprisingly large.
Why? First, if all goes well, the value of your property increases over the years.
Second, all those years of monthly mortgage payments add up; by the time
you’re ready to retire, your mortgage balance should be low or even zero.
Your house’s equity can help supplement the cost of your retirement . . . with
or without selling. Of course, the obvious option is selling your house and
buying or renting something less expensive. The less-obvious option is taking
out a reverse mortgage that provides you with income based on your home’s
equity without selling your home. In this section, we cover these important
options along with important tax and personal issues that you need to weigh
before deciding what to do with your home when you retire.
Trading down
Perhaps, when you’re in your living room, you hear more noise than you used
to notice. Or one day, you just can’t muster the desire to skim the leaves out
of the pool that no one swims in anymore. And ever since your daughter went
off to college, maybe you get a hollow feeling when you walk past her empty
bedroom. You suddenly realize that, now that the kids have moved out of the
house, you have more space than you really need or want.
Even if you don’t have kids, you may find that, now that you’re no longer
working, you don’t need to live within driving distance of the city where you
spent your entire life working. You suddenly have the freedom to step out of
the rat race and move to a place where life moves a bit more slowly (and
costs a bit less).
31
Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances

If you’re like most near or actual retirees, these feelings may also accompany
the realization that you don’t have as much money to live on during your
retirement as you want. You may be “house rich and cash poor,” or, to put it
another way, you have “more house than you need and less cash than you
want.”
Don’t despair! You’re actually in an enviable position if you have a house with
a good deal of equity in it. Now may be the time for you to trade down — sell
your current house and either buy a less expensive home or become a renter.
For some seniors, trading down is a wise move that can simultaneously meet
financial and emotional needs.
32
Part I: The Selling Decision 
Estimating how your taxes may 
change if you trade up
Here’s a shortcut method for figuring the
change in your income taxes caused by a
higher mortgage payment and property taxes.
Multiply the expected increase in your monthly
property taxes and mortgage payment by your
current federal income tax bracket which you
can find at www.irs.gov or the most recent
IRS Form 1040 instruction booklet you received.
In case you care — and it’s okay if you don’t —
why this shortcut yields a pretty darn good esti-
mate for calculating the change in your income
taxes, here’s an explanation: The calculation
appears to overestimate your income tax sav-
ings because it assumes that your entire mort-
gage is tax-deductible, when in fact only
mortgage interest, not the portion of your mort-
gage payment going to principal repayment, is
tax deductible. However, in the early years of
your mortgage, the interest portion of the mort-
gage payment represents more than 90 percent
of the total payment. The state income tax sav-
ings that the residents of most states enjoy for
deductibility of mortgage interest and property
taxes is ignored.
If the higher housing expenses that come with
trading up put a noose around your ability to
save money, your income taxes may increase.
If you’re saving money in a tax-deductible
retirement savings account, such as an
employer-based 401(k) or 403(b) account or self-
employed Keogh or SEP-IRA, your contributions
are generally tax-deductible from your taxable
income. If higher housing expenses reduce your
funding of these tax-sheltered accounts, your
federal and state income taxes increase. How
much? Multiply your combined federal and
state income tax bracket by the amount of the
reduction in your retirement account contribu-
tions. (Note: You probably won’t be able to esti-
mate the reduction in your monthly retirement
savings until you complete Table 2-1.)
Two methods may give you a better estimate of
the way your income taxes may change with a
house purchase. Try plugging in the estimated
tax-deductible housing expenses into your most
recent federal and state tax returns and see
how your tax bill changes. Or you can consult
with a tax advisor.

(Huge) tax perk for house sellers
As we discuss in detail in Chapter 16, house sellers can shield a big portion of
their house sales profits from taxation. Single taxpayers can avoid capital gains
taxation on up to $250,000 and couples filing jointly up $500,000 of profit.
As long as you lived in the house as your primary residence for at least two
of the previous five years, this tax exclusion is available to you without age
restriction, and you can take the exclusion as many times as you want (but
no more than once every two years).
This law (passed in 1997) is more expansive than the old exclusion rules,
which required you to be at least 55 years old. (The old rules allowed you to
take an exclusion only once per lifetime, and even then allowed an exclusion
of up to only $125,000 in house sales profit from capital gains taxation.)
33
Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances
Don’t ignore emotional considerations
During your working years, selling your house
to move to a “better” one or to relocate to
another area for a job can be an invigorating
experience that you may even look forward to
with pleasure. Sure, moving is a pain in the pos-
terior, but you find some joy in the newness of
things.
Retirees may look forward to change as well.
But if you’ve lived in a home or a particular area
for many years, moving someplace else may be
emotionally difficult. Leaving behind happy
memories is hard, and some people equate
retirement with dying.
Retiring is a major life change. Take your time in
assessing your options and don’t be rushed into
making decisions you’re not ready to make. Be
sure that you understand the financial ramifica-
tions of a move. At the same time, don’t make
the mistake of basing your retirement-housing
decision entirely on a calculator, while ignoring
your personal needs and emotions.
Ignoring personal considerations is what Henry
did. Consider his story:
Henry was quite concerned about the cost
of living in the area to which he and his wife,
Lucy, would eventually retire. He did a lot of
analysis and coerced his wife into moving
to a rural area in a part of the country that
they’d never visited before.
To make a long story short, Lucy ended up
disliking the area they moved to. Few cul-
tural activities were available in their new
location, and they didn’t find many people
they were interested in getting to know. To
add insult to injury, the area ended up not
being as cheap to live in as they originally
thought it would be. (In Chapter 3, we help
you assess the real, total cost of living in a
different area.) Henry was stubborn about
wanting to stay, and he and Lucy fought a
lot and eventually divorced.

Presuming that you’re willing to sell your primary residence, the new house
sales tax law makes it easier to convert your home equity directly into liquid
investments you can live off during retirement. Of course, such a strategy
requires you to either trade down or become a renter. Trading to an equal
cost or more expensive home won’t free up more of your money (if you’re
thinking about simply borrowing more, please see the sidebar, “What about
taking out a new mortgage or home equity loan?” later in this chapter).
Renting versus trading down
Usually, trading down is financially savvier than becoming a renter. If you’re
able to pay for your new home in cash, your housing costs during retirement
will be next to nil.
The price range that you should consider depends on a couple of factors:
 How much other money do you have for retirement? If you’re really
pinched for money to live on during retirement, you may be willing to
buy a considerably less expensive home to free up more money for living
expenses. Until you run some retirement projections to see where you
stand, however, you won’t know how much or how little you need to carve
off your home’s equity. And, as we cover in the next section, you can use
a reverse mortgage to tap into your property’s equity while you still live
there.
 What do you want to buy? If your retirement dream is to live on New
York’s Upper West Side or near the water in Hawaii, you may not be able
to trade down much. However, if living in Manhattan is more your idea of
a retirement nightmare than a dream, and you want to scale down and
move out to the countryside, you can probably spend much less on your
next home.
Some people sell their houses and simply rent in retirement. By selling, you
free up all the money invested in your house and make it available to live on
or do with as you desire. And when you rent, you have more flexibility to
move in the future.
If you’re considering the sale of your house and becoming a renter in retire-
ment, be aware of these potential drawbacks:
 Exposure to rental inflation: As a renter, unless you live in a unit pro-
tected by local rental-control ordinances, your monthly rental payment
is fully exposed to inflation. Today, $1,000 per month in rent may not
sound like a mountain of cash, but consider that, with annual increases
of only 4 percent annual increases, in 20 years, your rent will mushroom
to nearly $2,200 per month. With 6 percent annual rental increases —
which can happen if the United States returns to a 1970s-style period of
high inflation — that $1,000 monthly rent balloons to more than $3,200.
Ouch!
34
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 Obeying your landlord: As a homeowner, you get to call the shots. You
can change the interior and exterior of your home as you please. As a
renter, you’re largely at the mercy and whims of your landlord. If you’re
used to owning your own home and not having to answer to a landlord,
adjusting to the realities of tenant life can be difficult. So, if you do sell
and return to the ranks of renters, spend as much time inspecting and
interviewing your prospective landlord as you do examining the rental
unit. Remember that your landlord can sell the building, possibly forcing
you to move again — with added expenses.
35
Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances
Getting advice (if you need it)
Sometimes, you just become overwhelmed with
countless financial questions in your life —
including whether to sell your home — and you
may need someone to help guide and advise
you. Hiring an objective, competent, and afford-
able advisor may be your ticket to better deci-
sion-making.
If your experience is like that of many who have
come before you, finding a good advisor will be
a challenge. Most financial planners work in a
way that creates conflicts of interest — either
because they sell financial products that pay
them a commission or because they manage
money for ongoing fees. So, for example, if you
consider taking some of your savings and
investing more in a home by trading up, most
planners will rain on your idea. The reason: The
home purchase depletes capital that you can
invest through them and that provides them with
more income. On the other hand, if you’re on the
verge of retiring, these same planners may just
love your idea of trading down to a less costly
home, if doing so frees up cash for you to invest
with them.
Even if you’re successful in finding a local finan-
cial advisor who has nothing to sell you but his
or her time and good advice, you must be on
guard for another potential problem — inexpe-
rience in dealing with the housing issues and
decisions you’re confronting. Most financial
advisors spend the bulk of their time making
investment recommendations and analyzing
retirement plans, not helping people like you
decide whether to sell their homes.
No matter how overwhelmed you feel by your
housing quandaries, no matter how desperately
you want outside help, don’t abandon the
process of educating yourself. No one knows
your overall financial and personal situation
better than you do. You’ve obviously demon-
strated an interest in educating yourself by
reading this book. Keep reading this book and
consider others on financial topics of interest to
you: Personal Finance For Dummies (Wiley), by
one of us — Eric Tyson — can help you to
review your overall financial situation. Besides
giving you a better grasp of your personal
finances, that book walks you through the
process of finding and interviewing financial
advisors you may consider hiring.
If you do end up hiring someone to help analyze
your situation, the more educated you are, the
more you can evaluate that person’s compe-
tence and make efficient use of your advisor’s
time and, hence, your money. Always clarify
what expertise you’re seeking — be it tax, legal,
retirement planning, investment advice, or
whatever. And remember that a good advisor’s
job is to lay out the facts, discuss the options,
and recommend what’s in your best interests.

Researching reverse mortgages
If you’re happy and content with your home but want more money to live on
in retirement, a reverse mortgage may be for you. If you’re house rich but cash
poor, a reverse mortgage enables you to tap into the equity in your home while
you still live in it.
However, if you’re like most older homeowners, you’ve worked so hard for
many years to eliminate a mortgage and get your darn home “paid for” that
the thought of reversing that process and rebuilding the debt owed on your
home is troubling. Reverse mortgages are newer loan vehicles that few people
understand. And most of today’s reverse mortgage borrowers are low-income,
single seniors who’ve run out of other money for living expenses.
Thus, it isn’t too surprising that people who don’t fully understand reverse
mortgages often have preconceived, mostly negative notions about how they
work. Your first reaction may be to say, “I don’t want to be forced out of my
home; I could end up owing more than the house is worth.”
Rid yourself of those notions. You won’t be forced out of your home and you
(or your heirs) won’t end up owing more than your house is worth. Federal
law requires that reverse mortgages be non-recourse loans, which simply
means that the home’s value is the only asset that can be tapped to pay the
reverse mortgage debt balance. In the rare case when a home’s value does
drop below the amount owed on the reverse mortgage, the lender must
absorb the loss.
36
Part I: The Selling Decision 
Installment sale
Some house sellers don’t take their proceeds in
one big lump sum. Instead, they set up an
installment sale — a plan that spreads out pro-
ceeds payments over future years. In addition
to delaying your required income tax payments
until you receive the future house-sale money
(and enabling you to earn interest on that money
in the meantime), an installment sale also can
lower your income taxes. For example, you may
save tax dollars if — because you’re on the
verge of retiring — you’re expecting to be in a
lower tax bracket in future tax years. 
If you’re considering an installment sale, be
sure to pick up a good tax advice guidebook
and/or consult a competent tax advisor who has
experience with such transactions. Because
you’re delaying receipt of some of the sale pro-
ceeds, you’re risking that the buyer may not pay
you everything you’re owed. In addition, the
correct planning and reporting of an installment
sale for tax purposes can be complicated, espe-
cially if the installment sale arrangement is
unfamiliar to you.

Some reverse mortgages are good, many are mediocre, and some are just plain
bad. The best reverse mortgages merit your consideration. A good reverse
mortgage enables you to cost-effectively tap your home’s equity and enhance
your retirement income. So, if you have bills to pay, want to buy some new
carpeting, need to paint your home, or simply feel like eating out and travel-
ing more, a good reverse mortgage can be your salvation.
Reverse mortgage basics
So what exactly is a reverse mortgage, and how does it work? Well, as the name
suggests, a reverse mortgage reverses the traditional mortgage process. Think
back to when you bought your first home. Unless you had generous and afflu-
ent relatives, you probably had to scrape together the money for the down
payment and seeming never-ending closing costs. And then you were likely
saddled with what seemed like a mountain of mortgage debt.
Every month, thereafter, you dutifully mailed to the mortgage lender a check
for the monthly mortgage payment. In the early years of your mortgage, a
major portion of those monthly mortgage payments went to pay interest on
37
Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances
Protecting your home’s equity from 
nursing home expenses
Ironically, selling your house and renting in
retirement has another “benefit.” State govern-
ments are getting more aggressive about going
after the home equity of people who enter nurs-
ing homes, deplete their assets, and then qual-
ify for Medicaid (the state assistance program).
In the past, in some states, protecting home
equity from nursing home expenditures was pos-
sible. This legal protection no longer is available.
Congressional legislation passed in the mid-
1990s mandated that state governments go after
the home equity of Medicaid recipients.
Although some states have been more aggres-
sive than others about going after Medicaid
recipient’s home equity, home equity increas-
ingly is treated as an asset available for nursing
home costs, just like stocks, bonds, and mutual
funds.
If you want your assets to go to your heirs rather
than to your nursing home, start giving your
assets to your heirs well in advance (at least
five years) of your latter years of retirement
when you’re most likely to have more major
health problems.
Current Medicaid rules include what is called
60-month lookback, which means that, to deter-
mine whether you qualify for Medicaid cover-
age, Medicaid looks at assets that you held for
the five years prior to your application for cov-
erage. All assets that you disposed of during
that period need to be used to pay for your nurs-
ing home expenses before Medicaid kicks in.
And, if you’re thinking about not disclosing the
assets that you gave away, remember that it’s a
criminal offense to lie.

your outstanding loan balance, but a small amount of each of payment went
toward lowering the principal, or in other words, reducing the loan balance.
(As the years roll by, the loan balance should pay down at a faster and faster
rate until, eventually, your mortgage is paid off.)
A reverse mortgage reverses that process. When you take out a reverse mort-
gage, the mortgage lender typically sends you a monthly check. Imagine that!
You can spend the check any way your heart desires. And, because the check
represents a loan, the payment to you isn’t taxable.
As the reverse mortgage lender gives you more payments, you accumulate an
outstanding loan balance. You typically don’t have to pay back your reverse
mortgage loan until the home is sold (and then the loan and the accrued
interest is paid back from the sale proceeds) or, with some reverse mortgage
programs, when you move out of the property.
Reverse mortgage payment options
The whole point of taking out a reverse mortgage on your home is to receive
money that is drawn from the equity you have in your home. How much can
you tap? That amount depends mostly on how much your home is worth,
how old you are, and the interest and other fees that a given lender charges.
The more your home is worth, the older you are, and the lower the interest
rate and other fees a lender charges, the more you should realize from a
reverse mortgage.
You can decide how you want to receive your reverse mortgage money:
 Monthly: Most people need monthly income to live on. Thus, a commonly
selected reverse mortgage payment option is monthly. However, not all
monthly payment options are created equal. Some reverse mortgage
programs commit to a particular monthly payment for a preset number
of years, and other programs make payments as long as you continue
living in your home or for life. Not surprisingly, if you select a reverse
mortgage program that pays you for the rest of your life, you’re going to
receive less monthly, probably a good deal less, than from a program
that pays you for a fixed number of years.
 Line of credit: Rather than receiving a monthly check, you can simply
create a line of credit from which you draw money by writing a check,
whenever you need income. Because interest doesn’t start accumulating
on a loan until you actually borrow money, the advantage of a credit line
is that you pay for only what you need and use. If you have fluctuating
and irregular needs for additional money, a line of credit may be for you.
Because you have to take the initiative to draw on a line of credit, some
thrifty seniors have a hard time tapping and spending the money. The
size of the line of credit is either set at the time you close on your
reverse mortgage loan or may increase over time.
38
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 Lump sum: The least beneficial type of reverse mortgage is the lump sum
option. When you close on this type of reverse mortgage, you receive a
check for the entire amount that you were approved to borrow. Lump
sum payouts usually only make sense if you have an immediate need for
a substantial amount of cash for some purpose, such as wanting to gift
money to family or to make a major purchase.
 Mix and match: Perhaps you need a large chunk of money soon for some
purchases you’ve been putting off, but you also want the security of a
regular monthly income. You can usually put together combinations of
the preceding three programs. Some reverse mortgage lenders even
allow you to alter the payment structure as time goes on. Not all reverse
mortgage lenders offer all the combinations, so shop around even more
if you’re interested in mixing and matching your payment options.
39
Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances
What about taking out a new mortgage 
or home equity loan?
You may be wondering, “Why do I want to get
involved with this complicated reverse mort-
gage business when I could just take out a
home equity loan or a new mortgage on my
home?” The problem with traditional “non-
reverse” mortgage loan options is that you have
to begin paying them back soon after taking
them out.
The following example illustrates the problem:
Suppose that you’re the proud owner of a home
worth $225,000, and you have no mortgage on
the home. You want to stay in the home and
have no desire to sell it and move. You speak
with some lenders and discover that they’re
willing to lend you $100,000 through a 15-year
mortgage at 8 percent.
Getting $100,000 in your hands right now sounds
appealing. However — and this is a big how-
ever — you need to begin making payments of
$956 per month on your traditional mortgage
loan.
Now, if you invested the $100,000 that you bor-
rowed in some high-quality bonds, you’d dis-
cover that you may get only about a 7 percent
return, which bring in only $583 of monthly
income, not nearly enough to cover your
monthly mortgage payments. If you invest in
stocks and earn the market average return of 10
percent per year, which is by no means guaran-
teed, that return translates into only $833 per
month — still less than the monthly payment
required by the mortgage.
Now, if you’re thinking that you can simply live
on the $100,000 principal to supplement the
money from the investment returns, don’t forget
that you’re going to have to keep making pay-
ments, and the longer you live in the house, the
more likely you are to run out of money and
begin missing loan payments. If that happens,
unlike with a reverse mortgage, the lending
institution may foreclose on your loan, and you
can lose your property.

The costs of reverse mortgages
Reverse mortgage lenders, of course, aren’t charities; they make money on
reverse mortgages by charging an interest rate on the amount borrowed and
by collecting other fees. Although many of the costs of a reverse mortgage
are similar to those charged on a traditional mortgage loan, some are unique.
On a reverse mortgage, you typically see these types of fees:
 Interest: As with a traditional mortgage, the interest rate on a reverse
mortgage can either be fixed or adjustable. Fixed-rate loans offer peace
of mind because you know upfront what your loan’s interest rate will be.
However, you typically end up paying more interest over the life of the
loan for the security of a stable interest rate.
With adjustable-rate reverse mortgages, the overall level of market 
interest rates determines your loan’s future interest rate. If you get an
adjustable-rate mortgage and rates significantly increase, your outstand-
ing loan balance increases faster, thus leaving less equity for the day
when your home is finally sold. Odds are better, though, that an adjustable-
rate loan will save you on interest costs over the long run, because inter-
est rates rarely skyrocket and remain elevated. Because you’re taking on
additional risks with an adjustable loan, you’ll probably owe less total
interest on your reverse mortgage with more equity remaining for you
and your heirs after your house is sold.
Fixed-rate reverse mortgages make the most sense for seniors who
anticipate using their loans over a number of years — preferably seven
or more. Fixed-rate loans also help you sleep better at night if you’re the
type who frets over fluctuating interest rates.
 Upfront fees: Most reverse mortgage lenders charge you fees for pro-
cessing your application, fees for pulling a copy of your credit report,
and other fees for originating your loan.
 Closing costs: Your reverse mortgage lender will want to appraise your
home to determine its worth. This appraisal helps determine how much
you can borrow on your home. The more your home is worth, the more
money a reverse mortgage lender lets you tap from your home’s equity.
Other common closing costs include title insurance, local recording fees,
and inspections.
 Insurance costs: When a reverse mortgage lender commits to giving you
a reverse mortgage, the institution is taking a risk. If you live much
longer than the lender expects, and your home’s future value falls far
short of the expected worth, the reverse mortgage lender can actually
lose money if the amount of your outstanding loan balance exceeds the
value of your home. To reduce the risk, mortgage lenders buy insurance.
And guess what? You get to pay for the insurance, either as a yearly fee
(sometimes called a risk pooling fee) or as a percentage of your home’s
value when you take out your reverse mortgage.
40
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 A portion of your home’s value or future appreciation: Some reverse
mortgages include an additional cost. On some loans, this cost is based
on a portion of the appreciation in your home’s value from when your
reverse mortgage began. On other loans, this added cost is a portion of
the value of your home when your reverse mortgage is ultimately paid
off from the sale of your home.
Understanding and shopping for reverse mortgages takes time and patience.
Don’t rush the process. A number of nonprofit counseling agencies, sup-
ported through government funding, stand ready to assist you with sorting
through the reverse mortgage options in your area. Start with the AARP
(202-434-6044; www.aarp.org/revmort). At the state level, check with the
Department of Aging; at the local level, check with the Area Agency on Aging
(call the Eldercare Locator Service at 800-677-1116 for the agency nearest
you). We also encourage you to pick up a copy of the latest edition of
Mortgages For Dummies (which we also co-wrote) for its wealth of useful
material about all types of mortgages including reverse mortgages.
Tax Facts Sellers and Landlords 
Ought to Know
You can exclude from taxation a large amount of profits on the sale of a house:
up to $250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000 for couples filing jointly.
Conditions are relatively lax: The seller must have used the property as his or
her principal residence for at least two of the previous five years. The exclu-
sion is allowed as many times as a taxpayer sells a principal residence but no
more than once every two years.
If you’re considering renting your home, even for just a short time, after you
move out of it and before you sell it, tread carefully! After you’ve converted
your house into rental property, you can’t avoid taxation on the profits from that
property simply by purchasing another primary residence. See Chapter 18 for
more details.
We don’t mean to frighten you out of turning your house into a rental property.
You don’t lose all your tax breaks; you get different ones. If you decide to turn
a property into a rental, and then later sell it, you can roll over your capital
gain into another “like kind” investment real estate property. Currently, the IRS
broadly defines what a “like kind” property is. They allow you, for example, to
exchange undeveloped land for a multi-unit rental building. Just remember
that the IRS draws a sharp line between a primary residence and a rental
property, and they won’t let you roll profits over that line.
41
Chapter 2: Selling and Your Personal Finances

The rules for rolling over a gain from one rental property to another (called a
1031 or Starker exchange) are strict. To begin with, you’re allowed little time
to complete the rollover — only six months — and you must also identify a
replacement property within 45 days of the sale of the first property. You
aren’t allowed to handle the proceeds: They must pass through an escrow
account. Because of the complexity of the transaction, please do yourself a
favor and find an attorney and/or tax advisor who can guide you through the
process and ensure that you do it right.
Before you consider converting your home into a rental property, in addition to
understanding the tax issues that we just discussed, also weigh the following:
 How do you feel about being a landlord? Managing a rental property
takes time, patience, and knowledge of local rent-control laws. Some ten-
ants are a pain, and premises occasionally need repairs. You can hire a
property manager, but this service costs money, and finding a good one
can be a challenge.
 What about wear and tear? If you’ve gone to great lengths to make your
house immaculate, realize that renters aren’t going to treat your home
with the same loving care that you gave it. Although you can protect
your interests somewhat by securing from your tenants a large security
deposit (at least one month’s rent), you can’t expect them to pay for the
inevitable and gradual wear and tear.
For documentation purposes, you may also videotape the interior of the
rental, including the condition of floors, walls, and so on. Beware, though;
you may find that, at the end of the lease, your tenants disagree with you
over what you think is unreasonable wear and tear.
 What’s the cash flow? Tally up all the monthly property expenses that
you anticipate and compare that amount with the expected rental
income. If you’ve recently bought your property or have little equity 
in it, you may be unable turn a profit. The worst-case scenario is that 
the additional monthly cash drain cramps your budget and causes you
to accumulate consumer debt or underfund your tax-deductible retire-
ment accounts.
See Chapter 18 for more information about selling rental property.

 Estimating how much cash you can clear from selling your house
 Understanding the realities and costs of relocating
A
s Forrest Gump would’ve said if he’d been a real estate agent, “House
selling is like a box of chocolates . . . you never know what you’re gonna
get.” You never know how much your house is really worth until you reach an
agreement with a prospective buyer. And even after you decide to accept an
offer, you never know what surprise costs may crop up before your deal 
actually closes.
We don’t mean to introduce uncertainty here. Although it’s an inexact science,
there’s no reason you can’t reasonably estimate your expected proceeds of
sale. This chapter can show you how.
If money isn’t a constraint for you and you can comfortably make the move
that you’re proposing, feel free to skip this chapter. Spend the free time
reflecting on how fortunate you are!
Estimating Proceeds of Sale
You may need to get a certain amount of money from the sale of your house,
or at least know before you can close on a deal how much you’ll receive. Take
the time to understand the particular probable proceeds of sale under the
following scenarios:

 You’re strapped for cash because you want to buy a more expensive
home. You need to know before you sell if you’ll have enough money to
complete your next purchase. If you don’t know this amount, the worst-
case scenario is that the sale of your current house doesn’t leave you
enough money to buy your next one. Although you probably won’t end
up homeless, you may end up renting for a while and having to make an
extra move, or having to scrounge around at the last minute for money.
 You’re trading down because you need more money for retirement.
Perhaps you want to receive a certain amount of money from your house
sale to afford a particular retirement standard of living. If you’re not real-
istic about how much cash you’ll net from the sale, you may end up
wasting a great deal of time and money on a house sale that yields less
cash than you need or expect.
 You’re relocating, in part, because of finances. If you have a choice
about taking a job in some other part of the country, you may be
tempted to relocate if you think that you’ll be more comfortable finan-
cially. However, if you’re simply assuming or guessing that you’ll be
better off in the new area, you may be wrong. You need to gather and
review some facts before you move.
Note: Throughout this discussion of estimating house sale proceeds, we assume
that you don’t have an employer who’s willing to pay for some of your house
selling and moving costs. If you’re relocating because of a new job, by all means
negotiate to have your new employer pay for some or even all the expenses
related to your house sale. You’ll have that much more money to plow into
your next home.
Estimated sale price
Clearly, the price at which you can sell your house is the biggest factor in
determining how much money you’ll be able to put into your pocket from
selling your house. The estimated sale price, unfortunately, is also the 
hardest number to pin down.
You shouldn’t allow your needs to dictate the price at which you list your
house for sale (see Chapter 10). Prospective buyers of your house don’t care
about your needs, wants, or desires — such as, “I need $250,000 from the sale
of my house to retire.” Your house’s asking price should be based on the
house’s worth — which sometimes may not be to your liking. Your house’s
worth is best determined by examining the recent sale prices of comparable
houses. A good real estate agent can put together a comparable market analy-
sis for you. If you’re selling your house yourself, we explain in Chapter 10 how
to prepare a comparable market analysis yourself.

Closing costs
Selling a house costs a good deal of money. Generally, expect to pay about 7
to 10 percent of the house’s sale price in various closing costs for which you,
as the seller, may be responsible. A closing cost is an expense that you incur
in the sale of your house and that reduces the total money you receive from
the sale. The typical closing costs include
 Real estate agent commissions: If you’re selling your house through real
estate agents, they typically take a commission of 5 to 6 percent of the
selling price. As we discuss in Chapter 6, you may choose to work with
agents. If you do work with agents, the commission percentage you pay
is negotiable and may be somewhat lower on higher-priced properties.
 Repairs: Unless you’ve taken really good care of your house over the
years, or you’re selling in a strong local real estate market, you can also
expect to shell out some money for corrective work. For example, in
some communities, you may need a pest-control and dry-rot clearance
to sell your property. Inspections of your property may uncover building-
code violations, such as faulty electrical wiring or plumbing problems,
that you must repair. You need to consider having your house inspected
before listing it for sale (see Chapter 7 for more info).
 Transfer tax: Taxes, taxes, taxes — the three sure things in life. Some
cities and towns whack you with a transfer tax when you sell your house.
Such taxes typically are based on the sale price of the property. Check
with your friendly local real estate agent or your local tax collector’s
office to get an idea about your community’s transfer tax rates.
 Prorated property taxes: Depending on the date you close on the sale of
your house, you may owe money to bring your property tax payments
up-to-date. In most towns and cities, unless you’re delinquent with your
payments, you probably won’t owe more than six months of property
taxes. In fact, because many communities require that you pay your
property taxes in advance of the period that the payments cover, you may
find that you’re owed a refund of taxes from the buyer of your property.

46
Part I: The Selling Decision 
Because you can’t predict the date your house will sell, estimating the
amount that you may owe in property taxes at closing is a tad difficult.
You do know, however, whether you have to pay your taxes well in
advance. If your local community has such a pay-in-advance payment
system or you wait until the last minute to pay your taxes or make 
delinquent payments, you may want to budget three months or so of
property taxes as a closing cost.
 Possible credits: If you’ve paid ahead on your property taxes, you may
be getting a “refund” from the buyer of your house. You may also get a
refund from your homeowners insurance company for the unused por-
tion of your homeowners policy. And, finally, if you put less than 20 per-
cent down when you originally purchased the house, your lender may
have required that you pay a portion of your property taxes and home-
owners insurance in advance each month and then held these payments
in an impound account. (An impound account refers to money held in a
trust account established by the lender which is used to pay property
taxes and insurance premiums on your behalf when they’re due). The
lender refunds the unused funds from your impound account money
when the sale is complete.
Do the necessary research for the above expenses if you want to more
closely estimate expenditures on closing costs. Otherwise, for a safe, ballpark
estimate, assume that 10 percent of the expected sale price of your house will
go toward paying closing costs.

Mortgage payoff
For most people, the need to payoff an outstanding mortgage (or two) greatly
depletes the expected proceeds from a house sale. Figuring out your mortgage
payoff balance usually is a snap.
Simply whip out the most recent monthly statement you’ve received from your
mortgage lender to find out the amount you still owe as of the date of the
statement. You may need to make a couple of adjustments to this amount to
make it more accurate.

First, on most mortgages, your outstanding balance should decline each
month as you make additional payments. Because you can’t sell your house
immediately, your balance should decline between now and the date that you
actually close on the sale. If your loan has negative amortization (the monthly
payment falls short of paying the monthly interest that’s accruing), your loan
balance may be growing rather than shrinking.
Subtract from your outstanding balance the sum of the principal payments
you’ll be making between now and the proposed sale date. For example, if
your most recent monthly mortgage statement shows that $200 of your pay-
ment went toward principal reduction, and you expect to hold onto the
house for at least six more months, you can subtract $1,200 from your cur-
rent outstanding balance.
Add to your balance any penalties that your mortgage lender may charge you
for prepaying. Of course, if you bought Home Buying For Dummies (Wiley) when
you bought your home, you avoided mortgages with a prepayment penalty.
If you have any doubts at all about whether your mortgage has a prepayment
penalty, find out. You can either check your loan agreement (issued to you at
the time you originally closed on your mortgage) or ask your mortgage lender
(check your statement for a phone number). Write down the information
you’re given, the name of the person you spoke with, and the date. You may
also ask that person to send you something in writing to confirm the informa-
tion you were provided by phone.
You can try negotiating with the lender to reduce or remove the prepayment
penalty. A good bank may offer to cut you a deal if they realize that you may
do more of your future banking with them if they keep you happy. Your
lender may also waive or greatly reduce a mortgage prepayment penalty if
the buyers of your house use your lender to finance their purchase. If it’s a
large prepayment penalty, you can ask that the buyers obtain their mortgage
from your lender, presuming the lender has competitive loan terms.
Most mortgage lenders assess a nominal fee for sending you a payoff statement
detailing, to the penny, the cost of paying off your loan balance on a specific
day, as well as for other paperwork fees. These fees usually don’t amount to
more than $100 or so, but if you want to know exactly how much to expect,
simply call your lender. If the fee seems excessive or you’re willing to haggle,
ask the lender to reduce these fees; some will comply with your request.

Moving expenses
Over the years, you’ve probably accumulated more stuff than you realize.
Whether you’ve piled knickknacks in your closets, filled your attic with boxes
of gadgets, lined your garage with old bikes, or decorated every room with
the finest furnishings, you’re going to have to pack up all your stuff and have
someone haul it away.
Most people don’t have the equipment, experience, and muscle power to move
all their stuff themselves. If you’re like most folks on the move, you call a
moving service. As with any other service business, prices and quality of 
service vary.
The farther you move and the more weight you’re moving, the more the costs
escalate. Move the contents of a typical one-bedroom house about one-third
of the way across the United States, and you can easily spend several thou-
sands of dollars. Move the same items all the way across the country, and the
cost may double. Moving the contents of a spacious four-bedroom house
halfway across the country can run you about $15,000 to $20,000.
Be sure to research moving costs, especially if you’re selling a big house filled
with furniture and other personal possessions or if you’re moving a great dis-
tance. Get bids from several reputable movers and check references. Price
and quality of service vary greatly.

Chapter 3: Exploring the Economics of Selling
Tax deductions for moving costs
If you’re moving to a new job location, you can
deduct from your taxable income many of the
incurred moving costs that aren’t paid for by
your employer. These deductions include the
cost of moving your household goods and per-
sonal effects and the cost of transporting your-
self and your family from your old homestead to
your new one. However, you can’t deduct the
costs of house-hunting trips, transaction fees
for selling and buying the old and new resi-
dences, temporary living expenses, or the cost
of meals during relocation travel.
To qualify for the IRS moving tax deduction
(which is claimed on IRS Form 3903), you must
pass two tests. First, the distance between your
former house and your new job must be at least
50 miles greater than the distance between your
former house and your old job. For example,
suppose that you currently work 20 miles from
your house. You get transferred to a new office
that is 71 miles from your house. Because the
difference between the two distances is greater
than or equal to 50 miles, you pass the first test.
You must also pass the second test. During the
12-month period following your relocation, you
must work at your new job on a full-time basis
for at least 39 weeks. If you get fired after 38
weeks, you can’t take any deductions.
These rules are even stricter for the self-
employed. Refer to a good tax book (we’re par-
tial to Taxes For Dummies by Eric Tyson, Peggy
Munro, and David Silverman) to get more infor-
mation on these deduction details.
Putting it all together
After you understand the important elements of determining your proceeds
from the expected sale of your house, you can work through the numbers to
figure how much moola you hope to have coming your way.

Now that you know what proceeds you can expect from your house sale, what
can and should you do with this information? As we discuss earlier in the
chapter, this estimate is necessary if you’re at all cash constrained in buying
your next home or if you’re selling to finance some important financial goal,
such as retirement. (Be sure to review Chapter 2 to see if you can really afford
to trade up and to make sure that you understand the important financial and
tax issues involved in selling your home, particularly in retirement.)

Assessing the Financial 
Feasibility of a Move
In the event that you’re staying in the same neighborhood or community, esti-
mating the cost of living in another home should be fairly easy. See Chapter 2
to help you organize and analyze potential changes in your budget.
If, on the other hand, you’re relocating to a new area, don’t make the common
mistake of neglecting to consider possible changes in your overall expenses.
Many people simply assume that their finances “will work out” while others
fall prey to wishful thinking: “Because housing costs are lower in the area
we’re moving to, I’m sure we’ll be financially better off.”
We wish life was that simple, but unfortunately it isn’t.
Researching living costs and 
employment opportunities
Before you commit to listing your house for sale and actually selling it, under-
stand what your cost of living will be in the new area (check out Chapter 2).
Your property taxes, utilities, food, commuting costs, and many other impor-
tant items in your personal budget will change when you move into a new
home in a different area.
If you don’t consider the cost of living in the new location, you may end up
facing unpleasant surprises. That’s what happened to Joanne and Andy:
Weary of working long hours to afford the seemingly high cost of living in
Northern California, the couple viewed Andy’s Midwest job offer as their
ticket to financial freedom. Although the pay was about what Andy was
receiving in his present job, Joanne and Andy figured they’d be on easy
street, given how much cheaper home prices were in the town where
they expected to live.
So Andy happily accepted his new job offer, and he and Joanne quit their
current jobs. They sold their house and decided to rent for a while after
they moved so that they could better assess exactly where they wanted
to live.
After moving, Joanne and Andy spent the next several months in their
new Midwest community looking for a home. Although they’d thought
that housing was far less costly in their new area, they discovered that
replicating what they had in Northern California — a community with
parks, cultural amenities, and a good school system — cost more than
they expected.
50
Part I: The Selling Decision 

And then they discovered that some of the other things that they spend
money on each month were even more costly in their new area. For exam-
ple, Joanne and Andy found that their first winter’s heating bill eclipsed
the total annual utility bill that they paid out West! Food was more expen-
sive, as were property taxes. And Joanne had great difficulty replicating
her previous job because her profession was less in demand in the new
area. When all was said and done, Joanne and Andy’s new home in the
Midwest put them in the same financial boat as they were in out in
California.
Now, if Joanne and Andy had moved for nonfinancial reasons, then the fact
that they didn’t end up being better off financially may not have mattered.
But, except for the seemingly high cost of living, Joanne and Andy had liked
their location in Northern California. As they found, however, high home
prices are only a piece of the local financial puzzle. You must also consider
the other items in your budget and figure out how your income and expenses
may change if you move.
Five years after their move, Joanne and Andy moved back to the San
Francisco Bay Area. They made some adjustments to their spending so that
they could accomplish their goals and live in the community of their choice.
51
Chapter 3: Exploring the Economics of Selling
Using a bridge loan to take equity out 
of a current house before a sale
Some people put themselves in a housing pickle
that causes them to incur additional house-
selling costs. The pickle results from buying a
new home before their current one is sold.
Most people can’t afford to own two homes at
the same time; they need to get the cash out of
their current home to buy a new one. Not sur-
prisingly, the friendly lenders invented a way for
people to get around this little inconvenience.
It’s called a bridge loan, and if you qualify, this
loan enables you to borrow against the equity in
your current property, giving you the cash to buy
your new home before your current house sells.
Bridge loans are a bad idea for a number of rea-
sons. First, if you get stuck holding both houses
for many months, you face a continuing cash
drain from making two mortgage payments, two
property tax payments, and two insurance pay-
ments, as well as maintaining two houses.
Second, the interest rate and fees on a bridge
loan are quite high compared with a conven-
tional mortgage. Finally, if housing prices head
south, you may end up in deep financial trouble
if you’re unable to sell your current house for
enough money to pay the outstanding loans
against it.
As we advise in Chapter 5, you should sell your
current house before buying a new one.

Numerous resources are available for estimating the cost of living in a 
particular area:
 The American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA)
publishes a quarterly cost-of-living index (online at ACCRA’s Cost of
Living Index Web site www.coli.org or by calling ACCRA at
703-522-4980). They charge $7.95 for a two-city comparison.
 The U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the
cost of living for major metropolitan areas, and you can access this free
information online at www.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm.
 Homefair.com offers a free salary calculator that easily enables you to
compare salaries between two different towns or cities. Visit the Web
address www.homefair.com and click “The Salary Calculator” link on
the home page.
Cost-of-living indexes and surveys should be used only as a starting point and
as general guidelines. They shouldn’t replace a thorough budgetary break-
down that addresses the specifics of your situation. Sure, the indexes may
tell you that Louisville generally is cheaper than Boston, but they ignore the
fact that, for example, you never needed a car in Boston, because you could
walk to work and take the subway almost everywhere else. Your job in
Louisville may require you to buy a car, auto insurance, and fuel for commut-
ing, in addition to more airplane trips to visit your family in the Northeast.
Avoiding relocation traps
As Joanne and Andy found in the preceding section, you shouldn’t act first
(move and buy a new home) and ask questions later (see the section
“Researching living costs and employment opportunities” earlier in this chap-
ter). Don’t base such a critical decision on assumptions and wishful thinking.
Here are the common pitfalls that ensnare those making relocation decisions
so you can avoid falling into them yourself:
 Equating lower housing costs with a lower cost of living: This was one
of the big mistakes Joanne and Andy made. The cost of housing proba-
bly accounts for no more than a third of your spending. So if you don’t
consider the other goods and services you spend money on, you neglect
the lion’s share of your budget. Research all the major costs of living in
an area before you commit to relocating to the area.
52
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 Not doing an apples-to-apples comparison of housing costs: Again,
Joanne and Andy made this mistake. To a certain extent, you get what
you pay for. Housing costs are lower in communities with fewer ameni-
ties, inferior schools, poor commuting access, and so on. So if you’re
looking at relocating to an area with much lower housing costs, you need
to be skeptical instead of thinking that you’ve found the deal of the cen-
tury. Ask yourself, “What does that area lack that my current area offers?”
 Ignoring the overall opportunities in the local job market: Your next
job is just that — your next job. You’re probably not going to stay in this
job for decades on end. So, when you’re contemplating moving to a new
area, think bigger than just this “next” job. Unless you enjoy the cost and
hassle of relocating frequently, consider your chances for finding your
next couple of jobs in a given area. Although it’s impossible for some
people to know what they’re going to want to do several years down the
road, considering the job market for more than your current job can
save you from relocating more than you need to or leaving behind an
area you otherwise like.
If you’re married, you also need to consider your spouse’s job prospects
in your new community. In the case of Joanne and Andy, they learned
the hard way about the pitfalls of focusing on only one person’s job.
 Taking the place where you live for granted: All too often you appreci-
ate what you liked about a place only after you move away. Maybe, for
example, you’re tired of the urban congestion and dream of the relaxed
pace of a more rural community. After you make the move, however, you
really start missing going to the theater and eating out at cosmopolitan
restaurants. Pretty soon, you find yourself spending a great deal of money
to escape the “boondocks,” traveling back into the city to see musicals
and eat Indian food.

when the time comes.” It would be nice if sellers could ignore financing
issues . . . one less thing to worry about. Unfortunately, sellers aren’t off the
hook on that one.
You definitely should pay attention to financing issues when trading up. If you
sell your house to buy another and take on too much debt and a risky mort-
gage, you can end up strapped for cash or, worse, losing your new home and
the equity in it. The more that you borrow, the more money you can save
through the wise shopping and selection of the best mortgage for your situa-
tion. You may decide to improve your current home and will face the challenge
of paying for those expenditures.
Or perhaps the prospective buyers of your current house want you to lend
them money to make their purchase a reality. If you agree, you have to think
about financing issues but from the other side of the fence — that of the
lender. Lend money to a non-creditworthy buyer who can’t afford to make
mortgage payments and you may have to play Mr. or Ms. Banker with the
unpleasant duty of foreclosing your old property. This chapter helps you to
deal with these important borrowing considerations.
Financing Decisions When Trading Up
You need to examine your overall financial situation before you commit to
trading up to a more costly property. Make that assessment now if you
haven’t already done so (see Chapters 1 and 2 for more info). This section
highlights a few important decisions you need to make.

Choosing your mortgage
Because this book is about selling a house rather than buying one, we won’t
cover in detail how to choose a mortgage when you’re buying a home. However,
if you’re thinking about trading up, you’ll ultimately buy as well as sell, so we
highlight the important considerations in selecting a mortgage. Keep these
issues in mind as you begin thinking about selling your house, particularly if
you’re stretching your finances for the trade up.
Because you already own a home, this section may just be a refresher course.
But the following are some brief definitions for the major types of mortgage
options:
 Fixed-rate loan: As the name implies, this loan is one with a permanent
interest rate that never changes. You take out the loan at a certain inter-
est rate, and that rate is locked in for the life of the loan, which, in most
cases, is a term of 15 or 30 years. Obviously, with an interest rate that is
constant, your monthly mortgage payment is also constant.
 Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): The interest rate of an ARM varies
over time, typically adjusting every 6 to 12 months, but sometimes as
frequently as every month. These adjustments reflect the fluctuations 
in the interest rates of the overall economy. The monthly mortgage pay-
ment usually changes as often as the loan’s interest rate does.
 Hybrid loans: Mortgage lenders weren’t content to leave you with only
two options, so they did some grafting and came up with another one,
sometimes called intermediate ARMs. A hybrid loan starts out like a
fixed-rate loan and then, after a certain number of years — three, five,
seven, or even ten years — converts into an ARM, usually adjusting
every 6 to 12 months thereafter.
A newer twist on this type of mortgage, which we generally don’t recom-
mend, is interest-only loans that have lowered payments in their early
years because you’re only paying interest. When you begin paying back
principal, the mortgage payment jumps significantly.
When choosing among the three mortgage options, ask yourself two questions:
 How able and willing are you to take on financial risk? Getting an ARM
is a bit of a gamble. Although its initial interest rate usually is lower 
than that of a fixed-rate loan, if market interest rates go up, so does your
monthly mortgage payment. If your cash flow doesn’t have much breath-
ing room, you may get into trouble. Before you take out an ARM, check
out its periodic adjustment cap (the amount that the loan’s interest rate
can change at each adjustment) and life of loan adjustment cap (the high-
est interest rate allowed on the loan) so that you know how fast your
56
Part I: The Selling Decision 

monthly payments can increase and how high the allowable interest rate
and your payment can go. If the ARM’s maximum monthly payment
would break your budget, don’t get the loan.
 How long do you plan to keep the mortgage? If you don’t intend to
stick around in your new home for longer than five to seven years, then
a hybrid loan makes more sense. Because the initial interest rates are
lower than the rates on fixed loans, a hybrid loan definitely saves you
money on interest charges in the early years of your mortgage. If, how-
ever, you intend to keep your mortgage more than seven years, you may
be better off with a fixed loan.
If, after analyzing your financial situation as we discuss in Chapter 2, you see
that you’re stretching yourself financially, but you nevertheless want to trade
up, be extra careful in going with an ARM. Although a fixed-rate loan starts off
at a higher interest rate than an adjustable-rate loan, at least you know that
your payment on a fixed-rate loan can’t increase. If an ARM’s potentially higher
future payments would destroy your budget, stick with a fixed-rate loan.
Financing improvements
After reading our discussion in the earlier chapters of this book, you may
decide to stay in your current home because you can improve it and make it
more to your liking. Instead of having to go through all the time, trouble, and
expense of selling your home and buying another, you can “trade up” by
upgrading your current property.
Although improving your current home may enable you to get the home you
want at less total cost than selling and buying another, you still need to make
sure that you can afford the costs of the improvements. The more you spend
on housing, the less you have for other important future expenditures, such
as retirement, college educations for your little gremlins, and vacations.
Just be careful not to overimprove your home. For example, suppose that
you want to add a second story and put in a pool. If those additions give you
the most expensive house on the block, you may have a problem recouping
the renovation costs when you attempt to sell your house. If that situation is
okay with you or you can rationalize by saying, “Heck, it’ll cost me big bucks
to sell this house and buy another,” then improve to your heart’s content.
You have several options for financing the work to be done on your home. If
you can afford it, the simplest route is to pay cash for the improvements.
Unless you have some investment in mind that you think can provide a high
enough rate of return to justify borrowing to finance the project, you’re
better off using your available cash.
57
Chapter 4: Confronting Financing Issues

Here’s why. Suppose that you have the choice of using available cash or bor-
rowing money at 7 percent interest to finance your home improvements. If
you borrow to pay for the project and keep your cash to invest, you’re going
to lose out financially if you don’t earn at least 7 percent, before state and
federal income taxes, on your investments. (Note that, although your mortgage
interest may be tax-deductible, your investment profits are generally taxable.)
For example, if you invest your cash in a boring old bank savings account
that pays just 3 percent interest, you’d have been better off using your cash
to pay for your home improvements instead of borrowing. Unless you invest
in growth investments, such as stocks or rental real estate, you’re unlikely to
earn an average of more than 7 percent annually over the long-term. “Safer”
investments, such as Treasury bonds or certificates of deposit (CDs), simply
won’t provide returns that high.
What if you don’t have tens of thousands of dollars burning a hole in your
wallet, crying out for you to spend them on remodeling your kitchen? If you
have equity in your home — that is, the market value of your home exceeds
the mortgage balance you owe on it — you may be able to borrow against
that equity.
Generally, you can most cost effectively borrow on your home’s equity up to
the point where the total mortgage(s) outstanding on the property is equal to
or less than 80 percent of the market value of your home. For example, sup-
pose that your home is currently worth $250,000 (as determined by a lender’s
appraisal), and you have an outstanding mortgage of $150,000. As long as
your financial situation enables you to qualify, you can borrow up to a total of
$200,000 (that is, 80 percent of $250,000) — $50,000 more than you currently
owe — under reasonably favorable terms. If you borrow more than 80 percent
of the current market value of your home, you generally must pay a higher
interest rate and more upfront loan fees. You may also get stuck paying pri-
vate mortgage insurance, which protects the lender financially in the event
you default.
You can tap the equity in your home in two ways. You can pay off your current
mortgage and get a new first mortgage for enough additional money to cover
the remodeling job, or you can take out a separate home-equity loan. The best
option for you depends mainly on how good the deal is on your current mort-
gage compared to the current level of mortgage interest rates.
For example, suppose that your existing fixed-rate mortgage was taken out at
an interest rate of 6 percent and fixed-rate mortgages currently are going for
7 percent. You probably don’t want to give up your existing loan because the
interest rate is lower than current loan rates. Under this scenario, taking out
a home-equity loan (second mortgage) probably makes more sense. (Note:
Because home-equity loans are riskier from a lender’s perspective — they make
58
Part I: The Selling Decision 

the lender a secondary creditor to the first mortgage lender — the interest rate
on a home-equity loan generally is a little higher than the rate on a comparable
first mortgage.)
Now reverse the scenario. Suppose that you took your fixed-rate mortgage
out years ago at a higher interest rate, say 8 percent. Now, you can obtain a
loan at a lower rate, 7 percent. In this case, you may as well go ahead and refi-
nance to benefit from the current, lower interest rates.
One final consideration in choosing between a home-equity loan and a refi-
nanced mortgage: If you don’t need to borrow much money to pay for the
improvements and you think that you can pay the money back within a few
years, you may want to go with a home-equity loan. The reason: Refinancing 
a large first mortgage is probably going to run you much more in upfront fees
than taking out a smaller home-equity loan.
The Trials and Tribulations 
of Seller Financing
In an episode of the popular television series Seinfeld, Newman, a mailman and
a buffoon, appeals a speeding ticket in court. Newman’s defense: He was rush-
ing to the aid of his friend, Kramer, who was on the verge of killing himself
because he had failed to achieve his lifelong dream of becoming a banker. In
that episode, Newman loses the case not only because he’s a terrible liar, but
also because Kramer’s failed career aspirations seemed, well, so preposterous!
Have you ever dreamed of being a banker? Unless you’re in the business,
probably not. As a child, your career aspirations were probably more along
the lines of being an astronaut, athlete, doctor, or police officer. However,
when selling your house, you may need to know a bit about lending and
financing. This section has you covered.
Asking yourself why you’d 
ever want to be a lender
So, why all this talk about bankers and why in the world would you want to
be one? You may want to take on the role to lend money to the buyer of your
house, that’s why. And what would possibly motivate you to do such a thing?
Usually one of the following:
59
Chapter 4: Confronting Financing Issues

 Desperation: Some houses are difficult to sell because of major warts
and some won’t sell because they’re overpriced.
 A high interest rate on your money: We can see those dollar signs in
your eyes. You can earn a higher rate of interest lending money to the
buyer of your house than you can investing through bank accounts and
most bonds.
If your local real estate market is slow or you’re having difficulty selling your
property, you may sweeten the appeal of your house by offering to be the
mortgage lender. Prospective buyers of your property may realize that they
can save thousands of dollars in loan application fees and points (upfront
interest). After all, you’re not a big bank with costly branches to operate and
countless personnel to pay.
By offering seller financing, you broaden the pool of potential buyers for your
house. Traditional mortgage lenders are subject to many rules and regulations
that force them to deny quite a number of mortgage applications. But, as we
discuss in upcoming sections, making loans to borrowers rejected by banks
can be risky business.
So you absolutely, positively must thoroughly review a prospective borrower’s
creditworthiness before you agree to lend him money as a condition of selling
him your house. We explain how to make this evaluation later in this chapter
in “Finding creditworthy buyers.”
In addition to helping sell a house, some sellers are motivated to play banker
and lend money to the buyer of their property because the mortgage usually
carries an attractive interest rate, at least when compared to the typical returns
on conservative investments, such as bank savings accounts (currently 3 per-
cent) or CDs and Treasury bonds (currently around 5 percent). If you have
money to invest but investing in stocks terrifies you, lending money to the
buyer of your house may interest you. You may be able to earn 8+ percent in
interest by lending your money to a borrower.
Agreeing to offer a mortgage to the buyer of your house can clearly be advanta-
geous; the loan may help sell your house faster and at a higher price and, at the
same time, provide a better return on your investment dollars. However, noth-
ing that sounds this good ever comes without some real risks. If you lend your
money to someone who falls on difficult financial times or simply chooses to
stop making mortgage payments, you can lose money, perhaps even a great
deal of money. And you may have to take legal action and foreclose if the buyer
defaults on the loan. And if all that isn’t bad enough, you’ll again be the owner
of a house that you thought you’d sold, with all the associated expenses of
home ownership, including higher loan payments for the buyer’s new first
mortgage and, most likely, a higher property tax bill. Foreclosed homes also
tend to deteriorate under the care of the prior owners so you can also expect
fix-up costs.
60
Part I: The Selling Decision 

Deciding if seller financing is for you
Most house sellers aren’t in a position, financially or otherwise, to provide
financing to the buyer of their home. So, before you waste too much of your
time reviewing and reading the rest of this chapter, make sure that you’re in 
a position to seriously consider providing financing.
To consider making a loan against the house that you’re selling, you should
be able to answer yes to all the following questions:
 Will you be able to purchase the next home you desire without the
cash you’re lending to the buyer of your current house? This issue
keeps most sellers out of the financing business. If you need all the cash
that you have as a down payment to qualify for the mortgage on your
next home, seller financing is out of the question. And, if you can lend

Chapter 4: Confronting Financing Issues
The dangers of relying on faith and hope
Ron was interested in selling his house, and
Mark, an old college buddy, happened to be
renting nearby and was looking to buy. Ron and
Mark thought it was a real estate match made in
heaven. “I can sell without paying those exor-
bitant real estate agent commissions,” said Ron.
“I can buy a house now without having a large
down payment,” said Mark.
Mark, in fact, had only 5 percent of the pur-
chase price for his down payment. Ron had
another friend, an attorney, draw up a loan
agreement that didn’t require any down pay-
ment. Ron didn’t want his good friend, Mark, to
deplete what little cash he had, so Ron agreed
to a no-money-down loan.
Within in a few short weeks, Mark moved into
his new home and Ron moved out of the area.
Mark mailed his monthly mortgage checks to
Ron and all seemed well.
Two years after the purchase, the proverbial
horse manure hit the fan. Mark, who was
already up to his eyeballs in consumer debt
(credit cards and an auto loan), lost his job.
Mark was already a couple of months behind in
his mortgage payments, and he obviously didn’t
start catching up after he lost his job.
Ron, being a good friend, was extremely under-
standing, but his patience evaporated when
Mark stopped calling him and filed for bank-
ruptcy. To make a long, ugly story short, in addi-
tion to losing what appeared to be a good friend,
Ron also lost a good deal of money. Home
prices had dropped about 20 percent since
Mark bought the house, which Ron foreclosed
and became the proud owner of once again.
What are the lessons of this story?
 Never make a loan without thoroughly and
completely reviewing the financial situation
of the borrower. Neither assume, nor guess,
nor act on faith, nor hope.
 Be careful in doing business with friends. If
the deal goes sour, you can lose more than
money.

some of your money to the buyer of your house, don’t make the loan if
you then need to borrow more yourself for your next home purchase.
Even if you can charge the buyer of your current house a percent or two
more in interest on the money you lend than you’ll pay for the money
you’re borrowing to buy your next home, such an arrangement generally
isn’t worth the hassle and financial pitfalls.
 Do you desire income-oriented investments? Understand that mort-
gages are a type of bond. When you invest in a bond, your return comes
from interest if you hold the bond to maturity. Unlike investing in stocks,
real estate, or a small business, you have no potential for making money
from appreciation when investing in bonds held to maturity. So if you’re
looking for growth as well as income, seller financing isn’t for you.
 Are you in a low enough tax bracket to benefit from the taxable inter-
est income on the mortgage loan? If you’re in the federal 28 percent or
higher tax bracket, consider investing in tax-free bonds, such as munici-
pal bonds, and not mortgages, the interest on which is fully taxable. The
reason: The interest income from municipal bonds is free of federal 
taxation and sometimes state income taxation. By contrast, the interest
income from a mortgage is taxable as ordinary income at the federal and
state levels.
 Are you willing to do the necessary and time-consuming homework to
determine the creditworthiness of a borrower? As we discuss in the
next section, unless you secure a large down payment (25 percent or
more of the value of the property) from the buyer of your house, you
need to be darn sure that the borrower can pay you back. So if you’re
looking for a simple, non-time-consuming investment, look elsewhere.
Try mutual funds.
 Can you weather a default? Even if you do all the homework we suggest
in this chapter before agreeing to lend money, the buyer/borrower still
can default on you just as he can on a banker. Bad and unforeseen events
can happen to borrowers. Accept this reality. Ask yourself if you can
financially tolerate going without the borrower’s payments for many
months during the costly and time-consuming process of foreclosure.
Finding creditworthy buyers
After you determine that you have spare cash to invest or lend, and you’re
looking for taxable interest income, the hard work comes: putting on your
detective hat and assessing the merits of lending your money to a prospec-
tive buyer who’s more than likely a complete stranger.
62
Part I: The Selling Decision 

So how do you, someone who isn’t a mortgage lender by profession, become
a savvy credit analyst? Perhaps you’ve heard the expression, “Imitation is the
sincerest form of flattery.” Well, do what bankers do when deciding whether
to lend someone money.
The first thing that a lender does in her evaluation of the creditworthiness 
of a prospective borrower is to bury him in paperwork. As a lender, you
absolutely, positively must gather financial facts from the borrower. You can’t
accurately assess the risk of lending money to a buyer, even one whom you’ve
known personally for a number of years, without going through the informa-
tion-gathering exercise in this section.
Only agree to make a loan to the buyer of the property when he’s able to
make at least a 20 percent down payment. Bankers normally require a down
payment of that size for good reason: If the borrower defaults and the banker
is forced to hold a foreclosure sale, the down payment provides a cushion
against the expenses of sale and possible losses in property value if real
estate prices have declined since the loan was made. If the buyer falls on
hard times at the same time real estate prices go into the tank, you may find
yourself in the unfortunate position of repossessing a house that’s worth 
less than the amount the borrower owes on it.
So, what documents should you request and what information should you look
for? We’re glad you asked; we tackle that topic in the following sections.
63
Chapter 4: Confronting Financing Issues
Doing second mortgages
A prospective buyer of your house may ask you
to provide 10 percent of the financing in the 
form of a second mortgage while a traditional
mortgage lender provides an 80 percent first
mortgage and the buyer makes a down payment
of 10 percent of the purchase price of your
house. A second mortgage means that if the bor-
rower defaults, you’re second in line behind the
first mortgage lender who has first rights to the
value of the property after foreclosure. You’re
entitled to the amount left over.
Consider such a loan if, and only if, you do all the
homework we suggest in this chapter to check
out the creditworthiness of a borrower, and if
you can accept the risk that you can lose your
entire investment (the loan) if property prices
fall and the borrower defaults. Be sure that you
also meet the criteria we laid out earlier in this
chapter in the section entitled, “Deciding if
seller financing is for you.”
As an alternative to making a risky second mort-
gage loan yourself, some lenders make loans
when the borrower makes less than a 20-percent
down payment. Such low-down-payment loans
keep you, the house seller, out of the financing
business and enable you to sell your house to a
prospective buyer with a 10-percent or less
down payment. Tell your cash-short prospective
home buyers to ask mortgage lenders and bro-
kers about low-down-payment loans.

The loan application
The best way we know to get data from a prospective borrower is to have him
complete the Uniform Residential Loan Application (see Figure 4-1), also
known as Form 1003, which mortgage lenders almost always use. You can
obtain one of these forms through mortgage lenders or mortgage brokers. 
(If, because no profit is in it for them, they’re unwilling to send you a form for
your personal use, you can pose as a prospective borrower and have them
mail you their standard application package. You can also find the forms
online for free at www.efanniemae.com/sf/formsdocs/forms/1003.jsp.
Be sure to review the sample real estate purchase contract (for California) in
Appendix A. Pay particular attention to Paragraph 2, which covers financing
terms and conditions. Even if you don’t live in California, the provisions and
precautions in this excellent contract are useful.
After you receive the completed application from the borrower, be sure that it’s
completely filled out. Ask for explanations for unanswered questions. The fol-
lowing list explains how to evaluate the information in various parts of the form:
 Type of mortgage and terms of loan: Asking the borrower to fill in these
sections isn’t vital; the legal loan document that you both sign later con-
tains information on the terms of the loan — the loan amount, interest
rate, length of the loan, and the loan type (fixed-rate or adjustable-rate).
Later in this chapter, we walk you through the steps for setting the
terms of your loan and having a loan agreement prepared.
 Property information and purpose of loan: You can also skip most of
this section of the application. The address of the property and its legal
description (the block and lot number that come from the title report)
are specified in the loan agreement. Although you know that the bor-
rower is obviously buying, you may not know whether he’s going to use
the property as a primary or secondary residence or as an investment
property. If the buyer intends to rent the property for investment pur-
poses, your loan is riskier, and you should charge a higher interest rate
than you’d charge an “owner-occupied” buyer (see “Deciding what to
charge” later in this chapter).
Verify the source of the buyer’s down payment and closing costs to ensure
that this money isn’t yet another loan that may handicap the buyer’s
ability to repay the money that you’re lending him. The down payment
and closing costs should come from the buyer’s personal savings. Ask to
see the last several months of the buyer’s bank and investment account
statements to verify that the funds have been in the accounts during
that time and didn’t arrive there recently as a loan, for example, from 
a relative.
64
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 Borrower information: In this section, the borrower tells you about
himself/herself, or themselves, with regard to educational background
and housing history. More schooling typically translates into greater 
job stability for a borrower.
Figure 4-1:

page of

Loan

Chapter 4: Confronting Financing Issues

If the borrower hasn’t lived in his most recent housing situation for at
least two years, be sure that he also lists two prior residences. If the 
borrower was renting in his recent housing situation(s), request a 
letter from the buyer’s landlord to verify that rent was paid on time.
Alternatively, ask for both sides of canceled checks or checking account
statements covering the most recent 12-month period evidencing timely
rental payments. If the person moved frequently in recent years, check
with more than the most recent landlord. Borrowers who’ve had trouble
paying rent on time may well have trouble making regular mortgage 
payments. Ask for explanations of any red flags you find.
 Employment information: Even more important than a borrower’s recent
housing record is the employment record. Here, you’re again looking for
stability as well as an adequate income to make housing payments. If the
borrower hasn’t been in the most recent position for at least two years,
ask the person to list prior employment to cover the past two years.
(Note: The borrower actually lists the monthly income from the current
job in the next section of the application.)
 Monthly income and housing expense projections: In this important
section, the borrower details monthly employment income as well as
income from bank, brokerage, and mutual fund investments. In addition
to income from bank accounts, stocks, bonds, or mutual funds, a borrower
may have income from real estate rental properties. For most people,
obviously, employment provides the lion’s share of their income.
The buyer’s expected monthly housing expenses (which include the
mortgage payment, property taxes, and insurance) should be compared
against (divided by) the borrower’s gross (before-tax) monthly income.
Most mortgage lenders require that a homebuyer’s monthly expenses do
not exceed about 33 percent of the homebuyer’s monthly income; we
think that’s a good ratio for you to work with as well.
However, like a good banker, you don’t want to be rigid. If someone’s
proposed monthly housing expenses come in at 34 percent or 35 percent
of her monthly income and the borrower has a good job, large down
payment, solid references, and so on, then you may decide to go ahead
and make the loan, especially if the deal gets your house sold.
 Assets and liabilities: The borrower should also tell you about her per-
sonal assets and liabilities. The mortgage application form divides the
buyer’s assets between those that are liquid and therefore available for
a down payment or closing costs (for example, savings and money
market account balances outside retirement accounts), and those that
aren’t so liquid (retirement account investments or real estate).
66
Part I: The Selling Decision 

In the liabilities section, the borrower should detail any and all outstand-
ing loans or debts. Be wary of lending to someone who carries a great
deal of high-interest consumer debt (such as credit cards or auto loans).
If the borrower has the cash available to pay off consumer debts before
closing, have her pay those balances.
 Details of transaction: The purpose of this section is for you and the
borrower to make sure that the borrower has enough money to close
the purchase. The first part of this section tallies the cost of the house,
including closing costs. Subtract the expected loan amount from this
total. The result is how much money the borrower needs to come up
with to close the purchase.
 Declarations: In this section, the borrower should disclose any past
financial or legal problems: foreclosures, bankruptcies, and so on. If the
borrower answers any of these questions in the affirmative, ask for a
detailed written explanation.
Documentation, documentation, documentation
If you borrow from a lender, the staff asks that you provide a raft of financial
documents. If you’re the lender, you need to ask for the pile of papers, too.
You may rightfully wonder why you need more paperwork after the buyer
completes a detailed loan application.
Unfortunately, some people lie. Even though you may think that you have the
most financially stable, honest, and creditworthy buyers nibbling on your
“house for sale” fishing line, don’t start reeling them in yet. You need to get
the additional paperwork to prove and substantiate the borrower’s financial
status. Pay stubs, tax returns, and bank and investment-account statements
document the borrower’s income and assets. Just because someone tells you
on an application form that he’s earning $5,000 per month doesn’t prove that
he really is.
When verifying the information supplied on the mortgage application, ask the
prospective borrower for the following documents:
 Federal income tax returns and W-2s for the past two years
 Original pay stubs for the past month or two (if the borrower is self-
employed, request a year-to-date income statement and balance sheet)
 Award letter and copy of the most recent check if the borrower receives
pension, Social Security, or disability income
 Past three months of account statements for money to be used for down
payment, as well as copies of all other investment accounts (including
retirement accounts)
67
Chapter 4: Confronting Financing Issues

 Most recent statement for all outstanding loans
 Divorce or separation papers if the borrower pays or receives alimony
or child support
You also should obtain, at the borrower’s expense, a copy of his or her credit
report(s) to check credit history and to ensure that you’re aware of all out-
standing debts. Check your local yellow pages under “Credit Reporting
Agencies” for such providers. The larger consumer credit reporting agencies
include Experian, Trans Union, and Equifax.
Even when you request and receive all this documentation, some buyers still
can falsify information, which is committing perjury and fraud. For example,
some people, particularly those who are self-employed, may make up phony
income tax returns with inflated incomes.
Borrower problems
As you may know from your own personal experience, some people don’t
have perfect financial and credit histories. In some cases, a prospective bor-
rower may have enough problems for you to reject the application. In other
situations, however, the problems may be minor, and can be overcome by
taking some simple steps and precautions.
Here are common problems likely to crop up with prospective borrowers, and
our best advice on how to deal with each situation:
 Income appears too low to support monthly housing costs: The best
way to protect your interests if you’re considering lending to someone
who’s stretching (in terms of monthly income) to afford your house is 
to ask for a larger down payment. As we discuss in the next section, 
you can charge a higher rate of interest for lending to someone who’s 
a greater credit risk. Another strategy is having the borrower get a
cosigner, such as a parent.
 Past credit problems: Just because someone has nicks on her credit
report doesn’t mean that you should immediately reject the loan appli-
cation. Credit reporting agencies and creditors who report information
to the agencies sometimes make mistakes. Someone who has a small
number of infrequent late payments shouldn’t be as big a concern as
someone who has reneged on a loan. Ask the borrower for a detailed
explanation of any problems you see on the report and use your
common sense to determine whether that person is simply human or
irresponsible with credit. In the latter case, you may suggest that the
borrower enlist a cosigner.
68
Part I: The Selling Decision 

 Outstanding consumer debt: If the borrower has the cash available to
pay off the debt, have him or her do so as a condition of making the
loan. If the borrower lacks the cash to pay off consumer debt and lacks 
a 20-percent down payment, you’re probably better off not making the
loan, unless the buyer’s income provides a great deal of breathing room.
If you’re on the fence, consider having the borrower get a cosigner.
Deciding what to charge
After determining that a buyer is creditworthy, you can get down to the brass
tacks of setting the terms — interest rate and fees — on the mortgage. As
with collecting the financial data on a borrower, you don’t need to reinvent
the wheel.
Because agreeing to terms and administering an adjustable-rate loan are com-
plicated, you’re far more likely to make a fixed-rate mortgage. Call several
local lenders to find out the rates they’re charging for the size and type loan
that you’re contemplating (for example, 15- or 30-year fixed-rate mortgage,
first or second mortgage, owner-occupied or rental property). Be sure to ask
about all the fees — application, appraisal, credit report, points, and so on.
Although you may not charge all these same fees, you nevertheless need to
understand what the competition is charging.
Some states have usury laws that forbid unregulated lenders (that is, private
individuals like you) to charge loan origination fees, prepayment penalties,
and so on. These laws also put a ceiling on mortgage interest rates that
unregulated lenders can charge. You should consult a local, competent real
estate lawyer about local usury laws.
All else being equal, you should charge a higher interest rate for jumbo loans
(loans in excess of $417,000 for a single-family dwelling as of 2007 ), longer-
term loans, loans with less than 20 percent as a down payment, rental property
loans, and second mortgages.
If the borrower is in good financial health and can easily qualify to borrow
from a traditional lender, offer better terms than the commercial competition.
You may decide to charge the same interest rate but not upfront fees. Most
buyers are short on cash, so a reduction in closing costs usually is well
received. Besides, unless the buyer sells or refinances within a few years, a
mortgage’s ongoing interest rate is the greatest determinant of how much
you make anyway.
Charge a premium to borrowers to whom you’re willing to lend but who are
unable to get a good loan — or any loan — from traditional lenders. Remember,
you need to be compensated for the extra risk you’re taking. You may add as
69
Chapter 4: Confronting Financing Issues

much as 1 percent or 2 percent to the ongoing interest rate on the loan and
charge fees comparable to a lender. Be absolutely sure about the reasons why
the borrower got turned down for a loan from a traditional lender and make
certain that you’re comfortable with taking on a risk that an experienced mort-
gage lender wouldn’t.
70
Part I: The Selling Decision 
Getting permission to request tax and financial
documents and to verify employment
As an extra precaution in verifying the authen-
ticity of a borrower’s income tax return, have the
borrower complete and sign IRS Form 4506
(Request for Copy of Tax Return). This measure
enables you to request and obtain, directly from
the IRS, a copy of the actual tax return(s) the
borrower filed with the IRS.
To verify bank and other investment account
balances, as well as current employment, mort-
gage lenders usually have borrowers sign a
simple one-page permission form authorizing
them to contact organizations that can confirm
the borrower’s financial information.
Copies of statements can be falsified and so can
pay stubs. And, even if a prospective borrower
produces a recent pay stub, that doesn’t mean
that he’s still employed. If you want to maximize
your chances of making a successful and prof-
itable loan, get authorization to verify account
balances and employment. On the other hand, if
the borrower is making a substantial down pay-
ment (20 percent or more) and you otherwise
feel confident in his ability to repay the loan that
you’re extending, you may simply rely on copies
the borrower provides for you.
The figure shows a sample form that you can
use to obtain the borrower’s permission for 
you to request account balances and verify 
employment.

Protecting yourself legally
Unless you’ve made mortgage loans before, you may not have a clue as to
how to go about drawing up a loan agreement, so hire a real estate attorney
to draw one up for you. Expect the cost to be several hundred dollars — that
amount is money well spent. See Chapter 7 for how to find a good real estate
attorney.
One final piece of advice: If you sell the house and make an owner-occupied
loan to the buyer, you may afterward want to ask for proof that the borrower
is living in the property rather than renting it out. You can ask for utility and
other household bills to see if the bills are in the buyer’s name. Or you may
just stop by and knock on the front door of your old house to see who’s living
there.

T
homas Edison, one of our country’s foremost inventors, was often called
a genius. He modestly said that genius was 1 percent inspiration and 
99 percent perspiration. He should know. It took him years of hard work to
invent the phonograph. And Edison tested more than 4,000 different filaments
before discovering the one he ultimately used in the first practical electric
light bulb. Insight helps, but there’s no substitute for hard work and planning.
You don’t have to be a genius to get top dollar for your house when you sell
it. Nor do you have to be lucky, although a little luck here and there never
hurts. To paraphrase Edison, lucky sales are 1 percent good fortune and 
99 percent planning and perspiration.
If you follow the right steps before you put your house on the market, good
fortune may come your way throughout the transaction. You can control 
the selling process instead of reacting to it on a crisis-by-crisis basis. You can
create your own luck. This chapter shows you how to make time your best pal.
Timing the Sale of Your House
Time is your most precious gift. When it’s gone, you can never get it back.
Some people spend their time wisely; others foolishly fritter it away.
Depending on how well or how poorly you use it, time can either be an ally or
a terrible enemy during the sale.

In most communities, choosing the date that you put your house on the market
is an important decision. Certain periods of each year are predictably advan-
tageous for sellers. Others are just as predictably less than stellar.
Real estate marketing activity isn’t flat throughout the year. No matter where
you live in the United States, the real estate marketing calendar generally has
two distinct peaks and valleys created by ebbs and flows of activity in your
local real estate market (see Figure 5-1).
The sales peaks are higher and longer in good years, and the valleys are deeper
and longer in bad years, but the marketing calendar’s relentless rhythm never
changes. These seasonal cycles are heartless. They don’t care about birth,
death, divorce, job loss, or any other life changes that force you to sell. You
can’t alter the rise and fall of market cycles any more than you can stop the
tides. You can, however, use the predictability of these cycles to your advan-
tage. This section helps you identify when the best times are to put your
house on the market and which are the worst.

Part II: Tactical Considerations 

First peak season: Spring flowers 
and For Sale signs bloom
Calendar years begin January 1, but real estate years don’t. Depending where
you live, the longer and stronger of two annual peak seasons begins some-
where between late January and early March. If you live in a temperate area,
such as Florida or California, the market kicks into gear a little sooner. If
you’re still digging out from under ten feet of snow on March 1, your market
may take a little longer to heat up.
Weather aside, most folks don’t bound out of bed on New Year’s Day to buy a
house. They need several weeks to adjust to the daily grind after that happy
whirl of holiday parties and vacations. The buy-now, pay-later monster also
rears its ugly head; people need time to recover from the trauma of paying 
all their holiday bills. As a result, many January buyers are extremely price
conscious.
February through May normally is the most active selling time for residential
real estate. Families with children want to get their purchase or sale out of
the way by late spring so moving (which typically occurs 30 to 60 days after
the ink dries on the contract of sale) won’t disrupt the kids’ schooling for the
next academic year. Other people buy or sell early in the year for tax purposes
or to avoid interference with their summer vacations. The annual outpouring
of new listings pulls buyers out of the woodwork. Sellers are drawn into the
market by all the buying activity.
The first peak season is usually the best time to put your house on the market.
High sale prices result from spirited buyer competition. Because more buyers
are in the market now than at any other time of the year, your best chance of
getting a fast, top-dollar sale is during the first season. If you intend to buy
another home after yours is sold, this time period offers the best selection of
homes to purchase.
First valley: Summer doldrums
Memorial Day usually marks the beginning of the first valley. Sales activity
usually slows during June, July, and August. People who bought or sold in the
spring move in the summer. Buyers, sellers, and agents often take summer
vacations, which reduces market activity. Many folks spend their weekends
having fun in the sun instead of looking at houses. Who wants to be cooped
up inside on a sumptuous summer day?
77
Chapter 5: Timing Is Everything

Houses ordinarily take somewhat longer to sell in the summer because of a
lower level of buyer activity. Unless you have to sell now (or if property values
are declining), wait until the fall to put your house on the market. You’re likely
to get a higher price after people return from vacation.
If you’re selling your house to buy another one, keep in mind that summer is
your first opportunity to go bargain shopping. Summer is a good time to find
motivated sellers who bought a new home and must sell their old one fast
before the ownership expenses of two properties put them in the poorhouse.
Less property is available to choose from in the summer than in the spring,
but plenty is still on the market.
Second peak season: Autumn leaves 
and houses of every color
Labor Day usually starts the second peak season. This peak normally rolls
through September, October, and into November. Don’t let the beautiful
autumn leaves fool you, however. Just as fall brings a chill to the air, an icy
edge of desperation develops in the second season for some sellers.
People who sell during late autumn tend to be strongly motivated. Some
bought new homes in the spring before selling their old ones. Now they’re
slashing their asking prices — finally getting realistic after wasting months
marketing overpriced turkeys.
Others are calendar-year taxpayers who sold houses earlier in the year and
want to buy their new home before December 31. Why? So they can pay tax-
deductible expenses (such as the loan origination fee, mortgage interest, and
property taxes) prior to the end of the year to reduce the impact of federal
and state income tax. Either way, these folks are under pressure to sell.
If you’re a bit of a gambler, the second peak season may be the most reward-
ing time to sell. Given that you correctly apply the pricing techniques we
describe in Chapters 10 and 11, your house should sell quickly and profitably.
Unless prices are rapidly increasing in your area, wait until activity slows in
mid-November and then buy your next home at a discount price. You get the
best of both worlds — “sell high and buy low.”
Deciding to sell during the second peak season can be a risky gambit. If you
inadvertently overprice your house, it won’t sell. If you need to sell, carefully
monitor buyer response to your property. Be prepared to drop your asking
price as soon as you identify the danger signs (noted in Chapter 11). Don’t
wait until Thanksgiving to reduce your price. You may end up attempting to
sell your house during the dreaded dead season (see the next section).
78
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Another problem with waiting until the second valley in the real estate mar-
keting calendar to sell your house and buy your next home is that you’ll
probably have a very small selection of houses to choose from. What good is
a fantastically low price on a house you hate?
79
Chapter 5: Timing Is Everything
“Never try to catch a falling safe”
“Never try to catch a falling safe” is a common
expression that describes the crushing financial
burden of folks who compound their losses
because they refuse to accept the reality of
falling house prices in a declining market.
One of those safes smashed into Carlos and
Jody, who bought a new home before selling
their old one. Their tale began one Sunday
about six months after prices peaked in one of
San Francisco’s real estate booms. A Victorian
house they’d always admired had just come on
the market. They decided to attend the open
house and have a peek. The Victorian had high
ceilings, great architectural details, and a
gourmet kitchen. The master bedroom con-
tained a working fireplace, and the extra bed-
room would make a perfect home office. It was
love at first peek.
“Can you believe our luck, Carlos? It’s a steal at
$895,000. They’re practically giving it away. If we
don’t buy it today, someone else will.”
“I like it, too, Jody. But how can we buy it? Our
money is tied up in our house.”
“Don’t worry. Our house will sell fast. It’s worth
enough for us to afford this one. We’ll get a long
close of escrow so we have plenty of time to sell
our house. What can go wrong?” Fortified by
those comforting thoughts, they made a full-
asking-price offer, which the sellers accepted.
Jody and Carlos then spent three weeks select-
ing an agent and spiffing up their house before
putting it on the market. They asked $799,500, a
price wishfully based on what they needed to
net from the sale to buy their dream home.
Carlos and Jody were underwhelmed with
offers. After five frustrating weeks with not even
a nibble, they cut their asking price to $749,500
and pulled money out of their old house with a
home equity loan to increase the deposit on
their dream home. That “long” escrow was
quickly nearing an end.
Jody and Carlos had a few showings after the
price cut, but no offers. They finally got another
home equity loan to close escrow. To their
dismay, they’d inadvertently joined the elite
ranks of people who own two homes. Their
agent advised them to cut their asking price to
$699,500 to prove that they were serious about
selling.
At that price, they wouldn’t clear enough from
the sale to pay off the mortgage and home
equity loans, but they had no alternative. They
now had two mortgage payments, two insur-
ance payments, two property tax payments, and
two utility bills each month. They unhappily low-
ered the asking price and covered the shortfall
by selling some bonds that they’d been saving
for their kids’ college expenses. (That swoosh-
ing sound you hear is a falling safe.)
Knowing that the longer they kept the house, the
more bonds they’d ultimately have to sell to
make ends meet, Jody and Carlos sold their
house for $675,000 six weeks after their final
price reduction. This financial debacle wouldn’t
have happened if Jody and Carlos had used the
techniques described in this chapter.

Death Valley: Real estate activity 
hibernates until spring
The second peak season usually drops dead a week or two before Thanksgiving.
With the exception of a few, mostly desperate, sellers and bargain-hunting or
relocating buyers who stay in the market until the bitter end of December,
residential real estate sales activity ordinarily slows significantly by mid-
November. Folks stop buying property and start buying gifts. Would-be sell-
ers take their houses off the market while their kids are out of school and
their guests are visiting for the holidays. Ski slopes and sunny beaches
beckon.
This real estate Death Valley is generally the worst time of year to sell a house.
Even the brilliant pricing techniques in this book may not be able to save you
from getting your financial bones picked clean by bargain-hunting vultures if
you’re forced to sell at this time of the year. The weather is miserable, and
very few buyers are in the market. Time will show you no mercy if you wait
until this point to get realistic about pricing your house to sell. Don’t put
your house on the market during Death Valley days unless you have
absolutely no other alternative.
The Seller’s Quandary: Timing 
the Purchase of Your Home
So which comes first, selling your house before buying a new one, or buying
first and then selling? Neither course of action is risk free. The adverse conse-
quences of buying a new home before selling your present house, however,
can be far more dire. At worst, buying your dream house before selling your
present house may put you in the poorhouse.
If you read the sad tale of Carlos and Jody in the “Never try to catch a falling
safe” sidebar, you may think that selling first is the only correct answer.
Believe it or not, you can make a compelling case for either course of action:
 Selling before you buy eliminates financial risk. When you sell first,
you know precisely how much money you have from your sale to put
toward your next home. No sleepless nights worrying about how you’ll
come up with the cash you need for a down payment on your new home
or how much longer you’ll have to make mortgage, property tax, and
insurance payments on two houses. Your fiscal future is clear.
80
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 Selling first, however, introduces uncertainties and problems. If you
sell first, you may be forced out of your old house before you have
somewhere else to go. Where will you live? Where will your kids go to
school? Where will you store your grand piano and your bowling-ball
collection if you’re forced to rent an apartment while looking for another
home? Do you really want to move twice? What if you can’t find a home
you like as much as the one you just sold? Putting your life on hold
indefinitely while searching for a new home is emotionally draining and
insomnia-producing.
Given a choice between either selling your present house first or buying your
next home first, we strongly recommend that you sell your present house
before purchasing a new home. Even in good real estate markets, sales fre-
quently drag on much longer than you expect. Selling in a weak market usu-
ally compounds the problem. Homeowners tend to overestimate their house’s
resale value and underestimate the length of the selling process — a fiscally
deadly one-two punch.
Consolidating Your Sale and Purchase
Suppose you don’t want to sell your house first and then buy a new one. Nor
do you wish to buy a new home before selling the old one. What then? You can
use a third option to sell your old house and buy your dream home without
terror, chaos, pain, or privation. Your best alternative is to consolidate the sale
and purchase into a seamless whole. The following sections describe how.
Determine your house’s current value
The ultimate success or failure of your transaction depends on accurately
determining your house’s present fair market value. Don’t kid yourself. This
isn’t a place for wishful thinking. Overpricing is bad in any real estate market —
in a weak market, overpricing is a sure prescription for disaster. You must be
realistic when pricing your house, or the sale of your present property and the
purchase of your new home may flounder.
In a nutshell, you can either pay to have your house appraised or get a writ-
ten opinion of its fair market value (called a comparable market analysis) from
several real estate agents who fervently want to represent you during your
sale. Chapter 10 covers everything you need to know about establishing your
house’s value.
81
Chapter 5: Timing Is Everything

Check your buying power
Buying power is a function of the amount of cash you put down on your new
home and the size of the mortgage you get. Both numbers are easy to figure
out. Here’s how:
 Calculate your cash position by subtracting the probable expenses of
sale from your house’s estimated resale value. Chapter 3 goes into
probable expenses of sale, such as mortgage payoffs, corrective work
credits, real estate agent’s commissions, and property tax prorations.
We also cover relocation traps, such as higher housing costs associated
with buying a more expensive home than the one you own now. You see
how to figure your proceeds of sale before putting your house on the
market.
 Have a lender evaluate your creditworthiness. Find out the size of the
mortgage you can get based on current interest rates, your income, and
the probable down payment you can make on a new home if your pre-
sent house sells at its estimated resale value. If you’re nearly ready to
sell your current house and buy another, now is a perfect time to get
prequalified or, better yet, preapproved for a loan. Read Chapter 14 to
see why preapproval can give you a negotiating advantage.
Lenders can’t tell you how much money you can afford to borrow — just
how much money they’re willing to loan you based on their assessment
of your ability to repay the mortgage. Lenders don’t know or care about
your other financial goals and objectives, such as providing for your
retirement or socking away money to help your kids through college.
We, however, care a great deal about your financial well-being. That’s
why we devote Chapter 2 to helping you determine how the next home
you buy fits into your overall financial picture.
Familiarize yourself with the market
Harry S. Truman, our country’s 33rd president, was a renowned skeptic. He
was fond of saying, “I’m from Missouri. You’ll have to show me.” Folks from
the “show me” state don’t value silver-tongued talkers. They live by the doc-
trine that seeing is believing.
When buying or selling houses, everyone needs to adopt Missouri’s principle.
Reading Chapter 10 to explore the theory of pricing property is all fine and
good. However, merely reading about valuing houses can’t turn you into an
educated buyer or seller.
To properly educate yourself about property values, you must tour compara-
ble houses. No amount of book smarts beats good old shoe leather and 
eyeballing.
82
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

You have to wear two different hats during your property tours:
 Seller’s hat: A good comparable market analysis (CMA) prepared by a
real estate agent to determine your house’s current value contains two
lists. One documents houses comparable to yours in condition, size,
age, and location (called comps) that have sold within the past six
months. The other shows comps that are currently on the market. You
probably won’t be able to get into properties that have already sold, but
you should make a point of touring each comp currently on the market
to verify your house’s resale value.
If you’re working with an agent, have him or her tag along when you tour
property. As you walk through a house, ask the agent to point out simi-
larities and differences between it and recently sold properties that you
haven’t seen. This “show and tell” greatly speeds up your discovery
process. After visiting a few comps, you start to see which houses are
priced to sell and which houses are overpriced turkeys.
 Buyer’s hat: The house that you intend to sell and the home you want to
buy may be different — different neighborhoods, styles, sizes, ages, con-
ditions, and prices. Your new home may not even be in the same city or
state. You won’t, however, have to reinvent the wheel as a buyer because
most principles of valuing property apply whether you’re a buyer or a
seller. Smart buyers also use CMAs. Seeing is still believing, and nothing
beats touring property currently on the market so you know what’s
available when the time is right.
We also wrote a book to help buyers find their way through the purchasing
maze. It’s called — surprise, surprise — Home Buying For Dummies (Wiley).
Take action
Now you’re ready to start the action phase — selling your old house and
buying a new one. Timing is critical. If you structure your transactions prop-
erly from inception, you’ll be in firm control of the process instead of the
process controlling you.
Putting your house on the market
First things first. Let the world know that your house is for sale. You must,
however, continue looking at any new comps that come on the market after
yours as well as other new homes being offered for sale. The market con-
stantly changes. New property becomes available. Houses currently on the
market sell. A good real estate agent can keep you posted regarding impor-
tant changes that may affect your situation.
83
Chapter 5: Timing Is Everything

Push your hands deeply into your pockets whenever you tour prospective
dream homes. Untimely dreams have a way of turning into nightmares. As long
as your hands are safely out of harm’s way, you can’t sign any purchase offers.
Don’t make an offer to purchase your next home yet, for the following reasons:
 Your asking price may be too high. Even though you try your best to
price your property to sell, you may inadvertently overprice it. You
know that you’ve overpriced your property if purchase offers fail to
appear. Because the amount you can afford to spend for your next home
probably depends on the amount you net from the sale of your current
house, knowing how much money you’ll have available may be critical. 
If your budget provides little wiggle room and you’re forced to reduce
your asking price, you can simply make a commensurate adjustment in
the amount you eventually pay for your new home.
 You aren’t a real buyer until you have a solid contract on the house
you’re selling. Read Chapter 14 to understand why this statement is
true. For now, trust us; any offer you make on a new home that depends
on first selling your present house (if your house isn’t in contract yet)
won’t be taken seriously. Real sellers refuse to tie up their property
indefinitely while you attempt to sell your house.
Structuring your terms of sale
Chapter 14 gets into information you must know when offers for your house
begin pouring in from potential buyers. For now, concentrate on one
extremely important aspect of the deal you make — structuring your terms of
sale to provide enough time to purchase your new home. You shouldn’t need
a ton of time because you’re already familiar with prospective new homes
currently on the market, and you’re probably either preapproved or, at least,
prequalified for a mortgage.
Here’s how you can give yourself the time that you need to make a well-
planned and executed purchase:
 Schedule close of escrow on your old house to occur 30 days after the
buyers remove all their conditions of purchase and increase their
deposit. Buyers may take three or four weeks to remove the two most
common conditions of nearly all house purchases — mortgage approval
and property inspections. Getting loan approval usually takes somewhat
longer than completing the various property inspections. Thirty days is
your magic number, because lenders normally won’t hold their loan
commitment more than 30 days after they approve a mortgage.
Some lenders may be willing to hold mortgage commitments more than
30 days. One quick call to the buyers’ loan officer is necessary to deter-
mine the lender’s policy on this issue. If, for example, the buyers’ lender
guarantees a loan commitment 45 days after the loan is approved,
schedule your close of escrow accordingly. The more time you give
yourself to close your other transaction, the better.
84
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 You can get even more time by putting a “rent-back” clause in your
counter offer to the buyers’ purchase offer. This clause lets you rent
your house back from the buyers after escrow closes. It can buy you an
extra month or two (or more) if the buyers agree to a rent-back. Sellers
usually pay rent equal to their buyers’ actual cost for principle, interest,
taxes, and insurance. For example, if the buyers pay $1,500 a month for
mortgage payments plus their prorated property tax and insurance pay-
ments, that amount is your rent. Although the rent may be more than
you currently pay to live in your house, the amount is probably less than
it would cost you to move into a motel for a month or two and much
more convenient. As we note in Chapter 14, sellers are wise to prepare a
formal lease agreement that covers the rent-back.
No standard rent-back clause exists. Check with your real estate agent or
a lawyer to determine how rent-backs are best handled where you live.
Timing the offer to buy your new home
You may be tempted to rush out and make an offer on your dream home
while the ink still is drying on the contract you just signed to sell your pre-
sent house. Don’t. Give yourself time to shake out deal-killing glitches in your
sale before you make any offers on a new home.
 Don’t present an offer to buy your next home until the contract on
your present house resembles the Rock of Gibraltar. If you want the
sellers of your new home to treat your offer with respect, delay making
an offer until your buyers remove all their conditions of purchase and
increase their deposit on the house you’re selling. Until you know the
buyers’ mortgage is approved, and you resolve questions related to han-
dling corrective work discovered during the property inspections, your
contract is as solid as a bowl of pudding.
You may think that we’re overly cautious when we urge you to wait until
the contract for the sale of your house is rock solid before making an
offer to buy your new home. We’ve seen seemingly solid deals blown
apart out of the blue. The real estate gods can be cruel and fickle.
 Make the offer to purchase your new home subject to the sale of your
present house. This step protects you from being forced to buy a
second home. Your offer should specify that if the escrow for the sale of
your house doesn’t close within the time specified in your contract of
sale, you have the right to cancel the contract to purchase the new prop-
erty. If for some utterly unforeseen reason the sale of your house falls
apart, at least you can get out of the contract to buy the new home.
Combining a 30-day close of escrow with a two-month rent-back clause gives
you a three-month comfort zone in which to close the purchase of your new
home. Ideally, you can simultaneously close the sale of your present house
and the purchase of your new home. If you can’t, however, then sell before
you buy. You’ll sleep better.

 Hiring advisors to help with your sale
A
pproximately 20 percent of the houses sold in the United States each
year are sales made directly by property owners without using a real
estate agent. Selling your house yourself, without having an agent represent
you, is commonly referred to as a For Sale By Owner or FSBO (“fizz-bo”).
We know some people who’ve successfully sold their houses by themselves
and others who’ve made a major mess of their transactions. Whether you opt
to sell your house without an agent or conclude that hiring an agent is a better
way to go, our paramount concern is simple: that your sale is as profitable
and painless as possible. To that end, this chapter contains an objective look
at the pros and cons of FSBOs.
Eyeing the Potential FSBO Advantages
After conversations with people who’ve actually gone through a FSBO, we’ve
concluded that each seller’s personal situation and motivation for selling is
unique. The following sections describe the most common reasons why sell-
ers choose to sell without using an agent.
You want to save money on commissions
People who’ve gone through a FSBO often do so to avoid having to pay real
estate agent commissions. As we discuss in Chapter 1, the lion’s share of the
expenses related to selling your house are typically real estate agent commis-
sions, which can gobble a large portion of your house’s equity (that is, the dif-
ference between the market value of your house and outstanding mortgages).
In most areas of the country, a 5 to 6 percent real estate brokerage commis-
sion is common. Thus, on a $250,000 house, the commission typically sets
you back $12,500 to $15,000.

You may already have a ready, 
willing, and able buyer
If you spread the word that you’re planning to sell your house, you may turn
up someone who’s financially able to buy and willing to pay you the amount
that you feel your house is worth. Good for you. Why pay a full commission if
you’ve already found a buyer? As we note in Chapter 8, you’re in a good posi-
tion to either negotiate a reduced commission with a real estate broker or
hire an attorney to help you complete your transaction.
Whether you’re contemplating selling your house with an agent or doing a
FSBO, tell as many prospective buyers as possible that you’re interested in
selling. Although most people don’t find a buyer for their house simply by
getting the word out through their own network of friends and contacts, you
won’t know whether you’ll be one of the fortunate few who successfully sell
their houses this way unless you try.
Before you start getting the word out, take these tips to heart:
 Follow our advice in Chapter 1 to make sure that selling your house is
the correct course of action for you.
 Read Chapter 10 to discover how to determine the fair market value of
your property.
 Follow the tips in Chapter 9 to ensure that your house looks its absolute
best.
 Hire a good real estate lawyer to review your house sale contract and
other documents.
You may know the house and 
neighborhood well
You may know more about the strengths of your house and neighborhood
than local real estate agents, especially if you’ve lived in an area for many
years. You may be able to speak from personal experience about how child-
friendly the neighborhood is and how terrific the local schools are. You can
praise the virtues of nearby shopping, transportation, and entertainment.
You can gush about your wonderful neighbors. And you can point with pride
to all the improvements you’ve made to your house over the years.
88
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Be careful in praising your house and neighborhood. As Chapter 12 explains,
even the most interested prospective buyer can get turned off if you’re over-
bearing or sound like a used car salesman. And, as we discuss in Chapter 8,
what you say about your property may cause you legal problems down the
road. If you’re going to sell without a real estate agent, be sure to have a good
real estate lawyer on your team to assist you with mandatory property trans-
fer disclosures and to provide advice about what you should avoid saying
about your house.

Chapter 6: For Sale By Owner
How much can you really save by doing a FSBO?
Maybe a friend, neighbor, relative, or business
associate is interested in buying your house. If
you know a ready, willing, and financially qual-
ified buyer who wants to work with you directly,
you may save the full standard real estate bro-
kerage commission for your area, less a nomi-
nal fee paid to a real estate attorney.
In the best-case scenario, given that you make
all the right moves and are an astute negotiator,
you may save yourself a good deal of money.
You’re more likely, however, not to save the typ-
ical 5 percent to 6 percent real estate broker-
age commission. Here’s why:
 Unless you already have a buyer in hand or
you find one quickly, you have to spend
money advertising and marketing your
house, as we describe in Chapter 12.
Advertising costs money; the longer your
house is for sale, the more you spend.
 You may have to pay a real estate commis-
sion if a cooperating real estate agent
brings you a buyer. Most homebuyers work
with agents, and these agents must be paid
for bringing you a bona fide buyer. This
expense alone can cut your expected com-
mission savings in half.
 Last, but not least, most buyers expect to
share the commission savings you’re enjoy-
ing by not using an agent. They may expect
to split the savings with you. If you’re a
strong negotiator and the prospective
buyers aren’t, you may be able to keep most
of the savings for yourself.
Unless you can find a buyer without having to
advertise your house for sale, or you sell your
house to a buyer who isn’t working with an
agent, you can realistically expect to save about
1 percent to 2 percent of the sale price in a typ-
ical FSBO. Ultimately, of course, the amount you
do or don’t save depends on how much the
buyers pay for your house. If you end up selling
for a lower price than a good real estate agent
could’ve fetched for you, the lower sale price
may wipe out any commission savings.
Also, don’t forget the value of your time — espe-
cially if you’re self-employed or in a profession
where your income suffers if you work less.
Handling buyer and agent phone calls, showing
the property, holding open houses, meeting
property inspectors and appraisers, and han-
dling escrow details take time.

You may be more motivated than an agent
Your house and the money you have tied up in it are important to you. Some
real estate agents, despite having dollar signs in their eyes in anticipation of
the commissions they’ll earn if they sell your house, may be less than eager
to invest sufficient time in promoting and showing your property.
If you decide to use an agent to help you with your sale, as we discuss in
Chapter 7, exercise great care in choosing the right agent. Avoid overex-
tended agents who juggle too many listings and clients to give your house
sale the attention it deserves.
You like challenges
Some people don’t select the easier path. For example, instead of working for
a corporation, you may be the type who starts your own business. Many
small business owners say that the desire for a potentially higher income
wasn’t the primary reason they started their own business. Some small busi-
ness owners pursue this career path as a means of self-expression, to make 
a contribution to a particular field, or for the pleasure of working with and
satisfying customers.
For the same reasons, some people try to sell their houses by themselves.
Although most FSBO sellers are eager to save commission dollars, a few do it
for the challenge or because they want to apply skills they possess to selling
their own house.
You want to be in control
Some folks just don’t like giving up control. If you’re the type of person who
wants to be in charge, you may be unwilling to relinquish control to an agent.
If you sell your house yourself, you can decide when and where to place ads
for your house and exactly what features to emphasize. You may want to say
when it is and isn’t okay to have strangers (interested buyers and their agents)
strolling through your house. Perhaps you want to ensure that your cat or
the family dog isn’t let out of the house by an agent who fails to notice your
special showing instructions. Whatever the reason, for better or worse,
you’re the boss with a FSBO.
90
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Your house may sell itself
If the local real estate market is strong, and good houses get multiple offers
as soon as the For Sale sign goes up, you may feel that selling your wonderful
house will be a snap. All things considered, FSBOs usually are more success-
ful in a sellers’ market than a buyers’ market.
Focusing on Potential FSBO
Disadvantages
Although selling a house isn’t rocket science or heart surgery, it nevertheless
requires some important skills as we discuss throughout this book. Even the
smartest of FSBO sellers can get into trouble. This section points out a few
cons to going the FSBO route.
You may not know how to price property
Grossly overpriced property isn’t going to sell. Buyers and agents who know
property values will, in fact, avoid it like the plague. In the end, you may not
get as much for your house as you could have by pricing it realistically to
begin with.
If you under price your house, you may sell it below its market value —
shortchanging yourself thousands of dollars — perhaps even tens of thou-
sands. Say goodbye to the commission you “saved.” Chapter 10 deals with
using a comparable market analysis (CMA) to determine your house’s fair
market value. Chapter 11 is filled with tips about how to fine-tune your 
asking price.
You may not know how to 
prepare your house for sale
Your familiarity with your house can be a liability if it blinds you to your house’s
flaws. You may like your house’s clutter and quirks, but their dubious charms
may turn off prospective buyers. One important benefit that a good agent
brings to the table is a fresh pair of eyes and a desire to whip your house into
get-it-sold shape. Chapter 9 spells out, in detail, what you should — and
shouldn’t — do to your property prior to putting your house on the market.
91
Chapter 6: For Sale By Owner

You may not know how to 
market your property
Did you know that a humble, low-tech For Sale sign and a classified ad are
two of the most potent forms of advertising available to people who sell their
houses without using an agent? Do you know how to use the Internet to
market your house? Unless you have a background in real estate or market-
ing, you probably have some research to do. And, by undertaking a FSBO,
you miss out on two powerful promotional tools only available to agents: the
Multiple Listing Service (MLS) and brokers’ tours of newly listed properties.
If you’re undertaking a FSBO, be sure to read Chapter 12, which details the
best advertising and marketing techniques to get the word out about your
house. Chapter 8 delves into how, if you’re selling without an agent, you can
gain access to the MLS and brokers’ open house tours on a fee basis from dis-
count brokers. Scrutinize Chapter 13 to see what role computers can play in
selling your house.
You may not know how to separate 
real buyers from fakes
Serious buyers make good offers. Bogus buyers waste your time and money.
In the worst of all possible scenarios, you may unintentionally allow someone
with criminal intentions into your house. Chapter 14 points out the three
qualities that all good offers have in common. You can also find a section in
Chapter 14 to help you distinguish real buyers from time-wasting fake ones.
You may not have enough 
experience as a negotiator
If you know that you’re a weak negotiator, you have to be especially careful
about selling your house without an agent. Not knowing smart negotiating
tactics can cost you big bucks. Even if you are a good negotiator, your finan-
cial and emotional involvement in the sale may cause you to lose your cool
when bargaining with a buyer, or you may undermine the deal by appearing
greedy. Chapter 14 is brimming with techniques and tips for negotiating your
price and terms of sale. Secure the services of a good real estate lawyer who,
in addition to keeping you out of legal hot water, can also act as your negoti-
ating agent.
92
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

You may get yourself into legal trouble
Selling your house yourself to save on real estate brokerage commissions is a
hollow victory if the buyers sue you after close of escrow. Perhaps you didn’t
give them the mandatory federal, state, and local property disclosures about
problems such as lead-based paints or work you did on the property without
a building permit.
House selling is a team sport. Chapter 7 describes players you may need on
your team, one of whom is a real estate lawyer who can help you put together
a proper disclosure statement and sales contract if you’re selling your house
yourself. Also, be sure to read the section about property disclosures in
Chapter 8.
Trying to save money by avoiding legal fees is a false economy. If you’re not
using an agent, you need to have a lawyer review the sales contract before
you sign it. If that’s not possible, at least put a clause in the contract to say
your acceptance is subject to review and approval of the contract by an
attorney of your choice within five business days after you sign it.
Don’t discriminate! Disqualifying prospective buyers on the basis of race, color,
religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin is illegal. Discrimination
can get you into a heap of legal trouble and can cost you big bucks. If in doubt,
check with the Equal Housing Opportunity agency in your area.
You may not know how to close the sale
You won’t save on commissions if your deal falls apart in escrow. As a FSBO
seller, you have to make arrangements that a good listing agent normally han-
dles. Do you, for example, know how to open an escrow, get a preliminary
title report, order property inspections, handle contingency removals, and
order a payoff demand for your mortgage? Chapter 15 guides you through the
blocking and tackling necessary to complete your house sale after you have a
signed purchase contract in hand.
Increasing Your Chances of Success
Selling a house without an agent is doable, but it’s considerably more chal-
lenging than it looks. If, after weighing the pros and cons of doing a FSBO, you
decide to attempt to sell your house yourself, be sure to read our final words
of wisdom.
93
Chapter 6: For Sale By Owner

Educate yourself
The things you don’t know generally are what get you into trouble. This book
is crammed with tips and advice to help you sell your house for top dollar
and steer clear of problems, whether you do a FSBO or use an agent. Unread,
this book won’t do you a darn bit of good — unless you’re looking for a
yellow paperweight.
We strongly urge you to read this entire book if you’re going to sell your house
yourself. Then again, if you decide to hire an agent, you may still want to read
this entire book! Why? Because you can manage the transaction better and
feel much more comfortable if you’re knowledgeable about what’s going on.
Even if you’re certain about selling your house sans agent, interview several
good agents (using the criteria we outline in Chapter 7). Interviewing agents
may reaffirm that you can handle the sale yourself, or the interviewing
process may convince you that you’re better off hiring the best agent you
contacted. You’ll probably pick up some helpful advice and information you
can implement if you do decide to sell yourself. And, if your FSBO isn’t suc-
cessful, you can always hire the best candidate after you’ve given FSBOing a
shot. Either way, interviewing agents is well worth your time.
Ensure that other team members 
are especially strong
Without a real estate broker or agent on your team, making sure that your
other players are the best they can be is all the more critical. Be especially
careful to hire an excellent real estate lawyer. Chapter 7 details criteria 
you can use to select the members of your team.
Cooperate with agents
Because the vast majority of buyers work with agents, be sure to mention in
your classified ads and listing statement that you “will cooperate with
agents.” This statement tells local agents that you’re willing to pay them a
commission if they procure the buyer who ultimately purchases your house.
94
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Financially qualify prospective buyers
When someone makes an offer on your house, don’t take your property off
the market until you’re sure that the buyer is going to be able to swing the
deal financially. Few buyers are wealthy enough to pay all cash for your
house. Most folks need to qualify for a mortgage.
Ideally, the buyers are preapproved for a loan with a conventional lender. 
As opposed to merely being prequalified — a quick financial once-over —
preapproval means that they’ve gone through a rigorous financial examina-
tion. If, however, the buyers are just starting to shop for a mortgage, inquire
about their occupations, incomes, and the source of their down payment for
the purchase. When the buyers apply for a mortgage, get their permission to
contact the lender to find out the likelihood of loan approval. (Even though
you probably aren’t going to be financing their purchase of your house, check
out Chapter 4 to see what smart lenders look for on a mortgage application.)
Watch out for buyers who make their offer to purchase your house subject to
the sale of their own house first. As we note in Chapter 14, this tactic, if han-
dled improperly, can tie up your property and scare away other prospective
buyers who are ready, willing, and able to buy immediately.

A
dentist Ray knows once compared what he’d just gone through during
a protracted house sale to having root-canal work done on every tooth
in his head . . . without Novocain. Don’t take the dentist literally; he’s a
master of understatement.
Unless you’re a masochist, you never willingly seek out intense pain. Yet we’ve
seen smart people blunder into painful situations while selling their houses.
The key word is blunder. What usually gets people into trouble is something
that they (or the professionals they hire to handle the transaction) should’ve
known, but didn’t. No need to worry, though. This chapter takes a closer look
at who you need on your real estate team and how to select them.
Teaming Up — a Winning Concept
Knowing everything about everything is impossible. What is possible, how-
ever (and much more important, to boot), is putting good people on your
team — people who know the things you need to know to solve the problems
that invariably arise during your sale.
You don’t have to become an expert in property values, mortgages, tax and
real estate law, title insurance, escrow, pest-control work, and construction
techniques to play the house-selling game well. Instead, you can hire people
who’ve already mastered the skills that you lack.

House selling is a team sport. Your job is to lead and coach the team, not play
every position. After you assemble a winning team, your players should give
you solid advice so you can make brilliant decisions.
If cost were no object, you’d hire every competent expert you could get your
hands on. However, because you probably don’t have an unlimited budget,
you need to determine which experts are absolutely necessary and which
tasks you can handle yourself. In this section, we explain which experts gen-
erally are worth hiring and which ones you can pass on. Ultimately, of course,
you’re the one who must determine how competent or challenged you feel
with the various aspects of the house-selling process.
Here’s an overview of the possible players on your team:
 Your favorite person: You are the most important player on your team.
Sooner or later, another player is bound to drop the ball or fail to satisfy
your needs. You have every right to politely, yet forcefully, insist that
this person make things right. Remember that you hire the players on
your team; they work for you. Bad players may see things the other way
around — they want to believe that they’re in charge. They may attempt
to manipulate you into acting in their best interests rather than yours.
Don’t tolerate this behavior. You’re the boss — you can fire and hire.
 Real estate agent: Because the house that you’re getting ready to sell is
probably one of your largest investments, you want to protect your
interests by having someone on your team who knows property values.
Your agent’s primary mission is to accurately tell you what your house is
worth and then negotiate on your behalf to sell it for top dollar.
 Real estate broker: All states issue two different real estate licenses: one
for salespeople (agents) and one for brokers. Real estate brokers must
satisfy more stringent educational and experience standards than agents
do. If your real estate agent isn’t an independent broker or the broker for
a real estate office, a broker must supervise the agent. The broker is
responsible for everything that your agent does or fails to do within the
course and scope of the duties of real estate sales professionals. In a
crisis, your transaction’s success may depend on backup support from
your agent’s broker.
 Property inspectors: Your house’s physical condition greatly affects its
value. Smart buyers will insist on having your house thoroughly inspected
from roof to foundation as a condition of the purchase. Don’t passively
wait for buyers to give you a copy of their report. Get your house thor-
oughly inspected before putting it on the market so that you know what
to expect during any subsequent corrective-work negotiations with the
buyer.
 Escrow officer: Mutual distrust is the underlying rule of many real estate
deals. You and the buyer need a neutral third party, an escrow officer, to
handle funds and paperwork related to the transaction without playing
favorites. The escrow officer is the referee in the game of house selling.
98
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 Financial and tax advisors: Before selling your house, make sure that
you understand how the sale (and the purchase of another home, if
applicable) fits into your overall financial situation. In Part I of this book,
we explain how financial and tax advisors can help you evaluate these
considerations.
 Lawyer: Whether you need a lawyer on your team depends on three
things: the complexity of your contract, the location of your house, and
your personal comfort level. As we discuss in Chapter 6, if you decide to
sell your house without an agent, you definitely need a lawyer who spe-
cializes in real estate law on your team.
The purchase agreement you sign to sell your house is a legally binding
contract. If you have any questions about your contract’s legality, put a
real estate lawyer on your team.
Each player brings a different skill into the game. Assemble members of a
great team, and they guide you through any situation that may arise during
your transaction.
Keep in mind that good players serve as advisors — not decision makers.
Decision making is your job. After all, it’s your money on the line.
Landing the Perfect Listing Agent
The real estate agent that you hire to sell your house, known as the listing
agent, must be able to accurately answer your most important question:
“What’s it worth?” Houses sell for fair market value, which is whatever buyers
are willing to offer and sellers are willing to accept. Fair market value isn’t a
specific number; it’s a price range.
For example, suppose that an agent says that your property is worth $300,000,
more or less. If your agent is a better negotiator than the buyer’s agent, and
the buyer desperately wants your house, you may sell it for $315,000. On the
other hand, if you have to sell your house immediately, and the buyer has a
better agent than you do, you may only get $285,000.
Sale prices often are directly related to a listing agent’s knowledge of the price
that comparable houses sell for and negotiating skills. Of course, other factors
(such as the buyer’s and seller’s motivation, needs, and market knowledge)
also are important.
A good agent can be the foundation of your real estate team. An agent helps
you price your property, orchestrates the marketing and showing activities,
negotiates with buyers on your behalf, supervises property inspections, and
coordinates the closing. A good agent’s negotiating skills and knowledge of
property values can add 5 percent to 10 percent to your house’s sale price.
99
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

Bad agents may pressure you to accept a low offer to make a quick sale. The
real estate world is full of many well-intentioned-but-inept agents. In this sec-
tion, we show you how to avoid the bad agents and how to sift through the
hordes of mediocre agents to narrow the field down to good agents who are
worthy of their commissions.
Understanding agent relationships
Sellers and buyers can have two types of relationships with real estate agents:
 Single agency: In this form of representation, an agent represents only
one of the two parties (the seller or the buyer) in the transaction. In
single agency, an agent may play one of two roles:
• Seller’s agent: In this type of single agency, an agent works solely
for the seller.
• Buyer’s agent: In this type of single agency, the agent works only
for the buyer. A buyer’s agent isn’t an agent of the seller even if the
buyer’s agent gets a portion of the commission paid by the seller.
 Dual agency: In this form of representation, the same agent represents
the seller and the buyer. Dual agency is the most confusing and least
understood form of agency. See the nearby sidebar, “Dual agency prob-
lems” for more info.
Ideally, you want a single agency relationship. However, given the ever-
expanding market presence of large regional and nationwide brokerage firms,
it’s increasingly likely that you’ll find yourself in a dual agency situation where
the same estate brokerage firm represents both you and the buyer. Should that
happen, we strongly recommend that you and the buyer at least work with dif-
ferent individual agents within the firm. If humanly possible, avoid having the
same agent represent you and the buyer.
Recognizing the best listing agents
Good agents come in a variety of races, colors, creeds, and ages and may be
male or female. All the best listing agents, however, have certain important
qualities in common. They do the following:
 Educate you: Your agent knows the selling process and carefully explains
each step so that you understand exactly what’s happening at all times.
Agents should be patient, not pushy. A good agent never uses your inex-
perience to manipulate you.
 Enable you to make good decisions: Your agent always explains what
your options are so you can make wise decisions regarding your best
course of action.
100
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 Advise you if they think that you should add other experts (property
inspectors, lawyers, and so on) to your team: Experts don’t threaten a
good agent. The agent’s ego should always be secondary to the primary
mission of serving you well.
 Voluntarily limit themselves geographically and by property type:
Good agents know that trying to be all things to all people invariably
results in mediocre service. Even though real estate laws are the same
throughout your state, different areas within the state generally have
radically different market conditions, local zoning ordinances, and build-
ing code restrictions.
101
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team
Dual agency problems
Most people think that dual agency means that
one person represents the buyer and the seller.
Although such arrangements are possible, that
type of dual agency is highly inadvisable.
Logically, one agent can’t represent your best
interests as a seller (getting the highest possible
price) and the buyer’s best interests (getting the
lowest possible price) at the same time.
A more common kind of dual agency involves
two different agents who work for the same real
estate broker. For example, you list your house
for sale with Sarah, an Acme Realty agent, who
agrees to be your exclusive agent. Unknown to
you and Sarah, Betty Buyer met Bob, who’s also
an Acme Realty agent. Betty liked Bob’s style
and asked him to represent her exclusively as a
buyer’s agent. Bob enthusiastically accepted.
So far, so good. You have Sarah, your exclusive
agent. Betty has Bob, her exclusive agent.
Everything is fine, until Bob shows Betty your
house. Betty loves it and instructs Bob to write
up an offer on it immediately.
At the moment Betty decides to make an offer
on your house, the agency relationships that
you and Betty have with your respective agents
change. Like it or not, Sarah suddenly repre-
sents you and Betty. Similarly, Bob becomes
your agent as well as Betty’s agent.
Why? Even though two different agents are
involved in the transaction, both agents work for
the same real estate broker — Acme Realty. As
soon as Bob starts to work on Betty’s offer,
Acme Realty represents the seller and the buyer
of the same property. That’s dual agency.
You probably won’t have to worry about dual
agency if your agent works in a small office that
has only a few agents. The odds that one of the
other agents in your agent’s office will have a
buyer for your house are quite small. However,
if the agent that you select works for a large
brokerage operation with multiple offices and
thousands of agents (such as Coldwell Banker,
Century 21, and the like), your odds of having to
deal with dual agency increase.
Most states permit dual agency relationships as
long as the agency status is disclosed to the
sellers and the buyers in advance, and both par-
ties agree to it. Undisclosed dual agency, which
occurs if the buyer and seller haven’t been
advised about or consented to dual agency, can
be used as grounds for having a purchase
agreement revoked and usually permits the
injured parties to seek recovery against (that is,
sue) the real estate agents.

Agents go out of their area of geographical or property expertise for one
of two reasons: because they’re greedy or because they’re too darn inept
to know better. Whatever the reason, avoid such agents like the plague.
 Are full-time professionals: To reduce the financial impact of changing
jobs, many people begin their real estate careers as part-timers, working
as agents after normal business hours and on weekends. Such an
arrangement is fine for the agents but not for you.
One of the first questions to ask any agent who you’re considering work-
ing with is “Are you a full-time agent?” Just as you wouldn’t risk letting a
part-time lawyer defend you, don’t let a part-time agent represent you.
 Have contacts: Folks prefer doing business with people they know,
respect, and trust. You can make use of your agent’s working relation-
ships with local lenders, property inspectors, lawyers, title officers,
insurance agents, government officials, and other real estate agents.
 Have time for you: Success is a two-edged sword. An agent who’s already
working with several other sellers and buyers probably doesn’t have
enough surplus time to serve you properly. Occasional scheduling 
conflicts are unavoidable. If, however, you often find your needs being
neglected because your agent’s time is overcommitted, get a new agent.
 Are technologically savvy: Good agents know how to use technology to
get the job done. They (or their staff) know how to use the Internet to
make property searches, can put listing information about your house
on a variety of Web sites, and routinely utilize digital cameras and desk-
top publishing software as marketing tools. They understand the impor-
tance of staying in close touch with you and their other important
contacts via cell phone, e-mail, or some other yet-to-be invented high-
tech tool that works immediately if not sooner.
Some agents think technology has replaced human interaction. They’re
wrong. A geek who spends all his time in the office hiding behind a com-
puter is the wrong agent for you. A good real estate agent harnesses
technology to make more efficient use of her time, maximize your 
property’s exposure, and stay in closer touch with clients and others
involved in real estate transactions. Personal relationships still are 
critically important.
Choosing your listing agent
When you’re ready to get down to the nitty-gritty specifics of selecting your
own agent, we recommend that you interview at least three agents before
selecting the lucky winner. (Chapter 6 deals with the pros and cons of selling
your house without using an agent.)
To help you find three good agents to interview, tap into the following referral
sources:
102
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 Friends, business associates, and members of professional, social, and
religious organizations to which you belong: In short, anyone you know
who recently sold a house or is in the process of selling a house in your
neighborhood is a source of agent referrals. Don’t just ask for names; find
out why they liked the agent.
 Your employer: The company you work for may have a relocation service
that you can consult.
 Professionals in related fields: Financial, tax, and legal advisors can be
good sources of agent referrals.
 Sunday open houses: Visit houses currently on the market in your
neighborhood to check out the competition and to see how well the
agents hosting the open houses handle the process. Here’s your chance
to “audition” agents without their knowledge. Listen to the agent answer
questions from prospective buyers. Observe the way people respond to
the agent.
Seeing is believing. Chapter 9 covers preparing property to optimize its
favorable impression on prospective buyers. When you tour an open
house, note whether the house makes a good impression on you. If not,
drop the agent from further consideration as your listing agent.
In the next few sections, we outline the process of choosing your listing agent.
Step 1: Showing off your house
After you identify at least three prospective agents, start the selection process
by inviting these agents to tour your house — individually, of course — so
each can prepare a comparable market analysis (CMA) for your property. The
CMA establishes your house’s value by comparing it to other houses in your
neighborhood that are approximately the same size, age, and condition as
your house. Chapter 10 goes into detail about how to use sale prices and
asking prices of comparable houses (comps) to determine the probable 
value of your house.
During that first meeting, tell each agent that you intend to interview several
agents before selecting the one to work with to sell your house (the listing
agent). Schedule second meetings with each agent a few days later to review
their CMAs, their marketing plans for your property (a topic we cover in
Chapter 12), and their activity lists (see the nearby sidebar, “The proof is in
the activity list”).
Before the second meeting with your prospective listing agents, you have to
do a little homework (pun intended) yourself. Be sure to read Chapters 10
and 12 before the second meeting so you know the difference between good
and bad CMAs and marketing plans. Read Chapter 8, as well, to find out about
the different types of listing agreements and ideal length of the listing period.
Chapter 8 also explains real estate commissions, a subject that should be of
great interest to you because sellers usually pay the commission.

Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

104
Part II: Tactical Considerations 
The proof is in the activity list
The activity list is exactly that — a list of every
property the agent either listed or sold during
the preceding 12 months. This list is a powerful
analytical tool. Here’s what the activity list
should include and how you can use it during
the interview:
 Property addresses: Addresses help you
zero in on the agent’s geographical focus.
See how many properties the agent listed
and sold in your neighborhood. Eliminate
agents who are focused outside your area
or who have no geographical focus.
 Property types (house, condo, duplex, and
the like): This information indicates
whether the agent works on property simi-
lar to yours. If, for example, an agent spe-
cializes in condos, and you want to sell a
house, you may have a problem.
 Sale prices: Does the agent handle prop-
erty in your price range? An agent who
deals in much more or much less expensive
property than yours may not be the right
agent for you. If, for example, your house is
worth about $300,000, and the most expen-
sive property the agent sold in the past year
was $150,000, you likely have a mismatch.
Such agents probably don’t know how to
value and market higher-priced property
like yours.
 Days on market (DOM): Ask agents you
interview to specify how long property they
listed was on the market before it sold.
Compare that to the average DOM for your
neighborhood according to statistics devel-
oped by a reliable independent source such
as the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS).
Eliminate agents whose listings habitually
take far longer to sell than the average
DOM in your area.
Step 2: Conducting agent interviews
Begin each interview by analyzing the agent’s CMA, marketing proposal, and
activity list. After you review the written material, get answers to the follow-
ing questions:
 Are you a full-time agent? You should’ve asked this question before
inviting the agent to be interviewed. If you didn’t, do so now. Don’t work
with part-time agents.
 Whom do you represent? This question gets back to the fundamental
concept of agency. Be sure that you know whom your agent represents
at all times.
 What can you tell me about your office? Office size is a matter of per-
sonal preference. Some folks feel that they need the depth and scope of
services a large office provides. Others think that they’ll get more per-
sonal attention in a small office. No matter whether you prefer large or
small offices, check on staff support, market specialization, and reputa-
tion. Determine whether the agent’s broker is knowledgeable, is avail-
able to you if necessary, and is a good problem solver. In a crunch, the
success of your transaction may depend on the quality of backup sup-
port that you and the agent receive.

Don’t select an agent based solely on the size of the agent’s office. Office
size, or lack thereof, doesn’t affect how quickly property sells. Some
excellent agents operate as sole practitioners; other excellent agents
prefer the synergism and support services of a huge office. Although
larger offices tend to have more listings, no one office ever has a monop-
oly on the good listings. Quality of service is more important than quan-
tity of agents or listings.
 How long have you been an agent? You want an agent who keeps learn-
ing and growing. After five years in real estate, a good agent has five
years’ experience, whereas a mediocre agent has one year’s experience
five times. Time in the saddle is one factor to consider when selecting an
agent, but, by itself, it’s no guarantee of competence. Even with a time-
tested agent, you still have to review activity lists and ask all the other
questions (see the sidebar, “The proof is in the activity list” for more info).
105
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team
 Dates of sale: Sales should be fairly evenly
distributed throughout the year. If they
aren’t, find out why. A lack of recent sales
activity may be caused by illness or marital
problems that could reduce the agent’s
effectiveness. Be understanding of resolved
problems. Remember, however, that your
house and money are on the line when
considering agents who are in the midst of
ongoing problems that may affect their
ability to do a good job for you.
 Who the agent represented — sellers or
buyers: Seasoned agents work about half
the time with sellers and the other half with
buyers. Avoid agents who focus primarily
on buyers; such agents tend to lack the
qualities you need as a seller. When dis-
cussing transactions in which the agent
represented sellers, see which offices rep-
resented the buyers. Eliminate agents who
either personally sell all their own listings or
who sell listings only through other agents
in their office. You want an agent who coop-
erates with other good agents throughout
the brokerage community to sell your house
as quickly as possible and for top dollar.
 Total dollar value of property sold during
the preceding 12 months: Comparing the
three agents’ grand total property sales is a
quick way to measure individual activity
and success. However, you don’t necessar-
ily want a “top producer” representing you.
These agents may not have the time or
patience to provide the level of personal
service and education you may need.
 Names and current phone numbers of sell-
ers/buyers: Later, you can spot-check these
references. Although a few people may
request that their names or phone numbers
be kept confidential, be suspicious of any
agent who claims that all his or her clients
made this request. Such a claim is most
likely a pathetic attempt to get out of giving
you references.
Actions speak louder than words. Activity lists
transform cheap chatter into firm facts. Good
agents willingly give you their lists and encour-
age you to check references. Eliminate from
consideration any agent who won’t provide an
activity list.

 Do you have a salesperson’s license or a broker’s license? An agent
must satisfy rigorous educational and field sales experience require-
ments to get a broker’s license. Many fine agents have a salesperson’s
license throughout their entire career. Although a broker’s license isn’t 
a guarantee of excellence, good agents often get a broker’s license to
improve their professional skills and to give themselves an advantage 
in agent-selection situations.
 Do you hold any professional designations? Have you recently taken
any real estate classes? What do you read to keep current in your
field? Taking continuing education courses and reading to stay informed
about changes in real estate brokerage is a good characteristic in an
agent. So is obtaining professional designations, such as the GRI
(Graduate Realtor Institute) and CRS (Certified Residential Specialist)
designations through the National Association of Realtors’ study pro-
grams. Credentials in and of themselves are no guarantee of competence
or ethics, but they usually indicate that the agent has a desire for self-
improvement.
 What do you think of the other two agents (name them) that I’m inter-
viewing? To encourage frankness, assure the agents that you won’t
repeat their comments. Good agents never build themselves up by tear-
ing down other agents. If all three agents are good ones, you won’t hear
derogatory comments about any of them. If, however, one of the agents
(or the agent’s firm) has a bad reputation in the community, the other
two agents’ silence will speak volumes. Remember: Good or bad, the
reputations of your agent and the agent’s office rub off on you.
 How many other sellers and buyers do you currently represent? If, for
example, the agent holds four listings open every weekend and is work-
ing with six buyers, where will you fit in? Don’t contort your life to fit the
agent’s schedule. The agent who’s right for you has time to accommo-
date your schedule.
 Do you work in partnership with another agent or use assistants?
Sometimes an agent teams up with another agent to handle sellers and
buyers jointly. In such cases, you must interview both agents. Other
agents delegate time-consuming detail work to their assistants so that
they can focus on critical points in the transaction. If an agent relies on
such assistants, be sure that you understand exactly how and when
during the buying process the agent plans to work directly with you. You
don’t want to hire an agent only to find that you end up working most of
the time with an assistant whom you can’t stand.
 Is there anything I haven’t asked about you or your firm that you
think I should know? Perhaps the agent is planning to change firms or
is leaving next week for an extended vacation. Maybe the agent’s broker
is going out of business. Always ask this “make sure I find out everything
that I need to know to make a good decision” question.
106
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Step 3: Checking the all-important agent references
By checking up on agent references, you can gain experience the easy way —
by learning from other people’s mistakes. Be sure to get activity lists with
names and phone numbers of every seller and buyer the agent represented
during the past 12 months. With a complete activity list, you can pick and
choose whomever you want to call, instead of permitting the agent to limit
you to a highly selective list of references who are primed to tell anyone who
calls that this agent is God’s gift to real estate.
What’s to prevent agents from culling their worst transactions from the activ-
ity list? Nothing. However, the more deals they delete, the less activity they
have to show you — and the worse they look when you compare the agents’
overall sales activity.
Any agent who refuses to give you an activity list is trying to hide either a
lack of sales or unhappy clients. Dump the agent.
Suppose that each agent gives you a list containing 50 transactions. Assuming
one seller or buyer for each transaction, 50 clients per agent times 3 agents
interviewed equals 150 phone calls. No way. Your doctor would have to surgi-
cally remove the phone from your ear by the time you finished checking 
references.
Good news. You don’t have to call every client to check references — that is,
unless you want to. You can get a pretty darn accurate picture of the agents
you’re considering by making just six calls per agent. Here’s how:
1. Because you’re a seller, ignore buyer references.
That restriction probably cuts the list in half.
2. Next, look for people who sold property comparable to yours in price,
location, and property type.
Because their property is like yours, their experiences also are likely to
be similar to yours.
3. Of these sellers, call two who sold a house about 12 months ago, two
who sold approximately 6 months ago, and two whose sales just closed.
By spreading references evenly over the past year, you can see whether
the agent’s service has been consistently good.
After you identify which sellers to call, ask the following questions while you
have them on the phone:
107
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

 Is the agent trustworthy and honest? Did the agent follow through on
promises? Your agent can’t be even slightly untrustworthy, dishonest, or
unreliable. Consider a “no” answer to either of these questions to be the
kiss of death.
 Did the agent have enough time to properly serve you? Was the agent
available to fit your schedule? An occasional scheduling conflict is
okay. Frequent conflicts are absolutely, flat-out unacceptable.
 Did the agent clearly and satisfactorily explain in sufficient detail
everything that happened during the selling process? What one person
thinks is ample detail may not be nearly enough for another. For exam-
ple, some folks are content just to know what time it is. Others aren’t
happy until they know exactly how to make a clock. You know which
type you are; question agent references accordingly.
 Did the agent set realistic contract deadlines and then meet or beat
them? “Time is of the essence” is a condition of every real estate con-
tract. Contract deadlines for obtaining financing, completing property
inspections, and so forth are extremely important and must be met, or
your sale will fall apart. A good agent makes sure that you and the buyer
meet all contract deadlines.
 Do the words self-starter, committed, and motivated describe the
agent? No one likes pushy people. But if you need to sell quickly, the last
thing you want is a lethargic agent. You shouldn’t have to jab your agent
periodically with an electric prod to make sure that he’s still breathing.
Find out how energetically your prospective agent is prepared to work
for you.
 Did the agent get a good sale price for your house? See whether the
agent’s clients still think that they did well on their sale.
 Would you use the agent again? This question is the ultimate test of cus-
tomer satisfaction. If someone answers “No,” find out why. The negative
answer may be the result of a personality conflict between client and
agent that won’t bother you. On the other hand, the negative answer
may reveal a horrendous agent flaw that you haven’t yet uncovered.
 Is there anything I haven’t asked you about the agent or the agent’s
office that you think I should know? You never know what you may
find out when you ask this open-ended question.
Step 4: Picking the best of the lot
By analyzing all three agents’ CMAs, marketing plans, and activity lists; inter-
viewing the agents; and talking to their clients, you can gather facts that you
need to make an intelligent decision. Here are three final considerations to
help you select the paragon of virtue that you need on your real estate team:
108
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 Will you be proud having the agent represent you? People who deal
with your agent will form opinions of you based on their impressions of
your agent. You can’t afford to have anyone on your team who isn’t a
competent professional.
 Do you communicate well with the agent? Good agents make sure 
that you completely understand everything they say. If you can’t under-
stand your agent, don’t blame yourself; the agent is probably a poor
communicator.
 Do you enjoy the agent’s personality? Don’t kid yourself. House selling
is stressful. You share extremely intense situations with your agent.
Working with an agent you like may transform the selling process from a
horrible experience into an exciting adventure — or, at least, a tolerable
transaction.
Achieving top performance 
from the winner
After working so hard to find a great agent, the last thing you want to do is
inadvertently ruin the relationship. Good seller-agent relationships aren’t
accidental. On the contrary, these relationships are based on pillars of
mutual loyalty and trust that develop over time.
You obviously don’t want to tell your innermost secrets to an agent who’s
going to blab them to a buyer or the buyer’s agent. To that end, some sellers
view their agent as an adversary. These sellers think that the less their agent
knows about them, the better. Such sellers believe that, if their agent finds
out what their bottom line is and why they want to sell, the agent will manip-
ulate them into selling their house for less than it’s worth just to make a
quick commission.
Good agents don’t betray your trust. They know that if they take care of you,
their commission will take care of itself. If you can’t trust your agent, don’t
play cat-and-mouse games; get a new agent. Smart agents know that you have
the power to make or break their careers. If they please you, you’ll be a geyser
of glowing referrals for them. If your agent upsets you, you’ll be like a fester-
ing thorn in her paw.
Use the immense power of potential referrals to control your relationship
with the agent. If your agent does a lousy job, don’t get mad — get even. Tell
the world every gory detail of your rotten experience. Nothing ruins an
agent’s career faster than dissatisfied clients.
109
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

Bringing in the Broker
When you select an agent, your agent’s broker is part of the package. If your
purchase rolls merrily along, you may never meet the broker. But if a truly
nasty problem rears its ugly head, guess who you can turn to for a quick fix?
Brokers are the invisible grease in problematic transactions.
All states issue two markedly different types of real estate licenses: one for
salespeople (agents) and one for brokers. Agents who have broker’s licenses
must satisfy much more stringent educational and experience standards than
agents with only a salesperson’s license.
Your agent may have either type of license. Broker’s licensees have the option
either to operate independently or to work for another broker. An agent who
has a salesperson’s license, on the other hand, must work under a broker’s
direct supervision, ensuring that you have access to the broker’s higher lever
of expertise if you need it.
The broker’s image, good or bad, will be obvious from comments that you hear
while checking agent references. You want the buyer, lender, and all other
people involved in your transaction working with you because of your broker’s
reputation, not in spite of it. You shouldn’t have to overcome guilt by associa-
tion. If an agent’s references disparage the agent’s broker, dump the agent.
Good brokers develop and maintain relationships with the people with whom
their offices deal — other brokers, lenders, title officers, city officials, and the
like. This reservoir of good will is yours to use if the going gets rough. Brokers
with strong business relationships can work near-miracles for you in a crisis.
House sales sometimes become highly emotional. If your life savings are on
the line, you may lash out at other players. Someone must handle the result-
ing quarrels and misunderstandings. That someone is the broker. Because
the broker participates directly or indirectly in every deal the office handles,
your broker’s practical experience is directly related to the number of agents
in the office. A broker who manages a 25-agent office, for example, gets 25
years of real estate experience per calendar year. Any broker who can sur-
vive five years of handling all the office’s gut-wrenching messes becomes a
superb problem solver out of sheer necessity.
Call your broker into the game if your agent is stymied by a tough problem or
if you’re having problems with the agent. Everything an agent does or fails to
do is ultimately the broker’s responsibility. After all, the broker’s job is to
help make your problems go away.
110
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Handling House Inspectors
Houses in good physical condition sell for top dollar. Fixer-uppers sell at
greatly reduced prices because whoever buys them must spend money on
repairs to get them back into pristine condition.
Even if you’ve lived in your house for the past 20 years, it may have hidden
problems you know nothing about. You probably can’t see, for example,
whether your house’s electrical system is shot or whether dry rot is turning
the woodwork into sawdust or whether the roof is one rainstorm away from
springing a Niagara of leaks.
Invisible defects can be deal breakers because they cost major money to repair.
The more you know about your house’s hidden problems, the better you can
effectively deal with those problems. For that reason, we recommend that
you have your property thoroughly inspected before putting it on the market.
Arranging premarketing 
property inspections
Count on it. Prudent purchasers will have your property thoroughly inspected
before they buy it. Expect inspectors to poke into everything — your house’s
roof, chimney, gutters, plumbing, electrical wiring, heating and cooling sys-
tems, insulation, smoke detectors, all the permanent appliances and fixtures
in your kitchen and bathrooms, and the foundation. They’ll also check for
health, safety, and environmental hazards. If you live in a temperate climate,
you can bet that they’ll have a structural pest control inspector look for
damage from wood-destroying insects (carpenter ants, termites, and powder-
post beetles) as well as dry rot and fungus infections. Whew!
Flowers, fragrances, and all that other staging stuff aside, smart buyers know
that a house’s physical condition greatly affects its value. No matter how
beautifully your property is staged, buyers won’t pay top dollar for a house
that needs extensive and expensive repairs.
Exploring the advantages of inspecting
before marketing
The best defense is a good offense. Beat buyers to the punch — get your
inspections before they get theirs. Discover everything wrong with your house
before putting it on the market. Defusing a crisis begins by discovering that a
problem exists.
111
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

Some real estate agents argue against getting a house inspected before
putting it on the market. As we explain in Chapter 8, many states now require
that sellers disclose any known property defects to prospective buyers.
These agents point out that you can’t tell buyers about problems if you don’t
know that the problems exist. Handing buyers a long list of repair problems
as they enter your house will turn many of them off. They recommend getting
buyers emotionally committed to the property first, before their own inspec-
tors drop the bomb. That line of reasoning is based on an ostrich-like logic:
What you don’t know can’t get you in trouble — for a while, anyway.
Agents may use a second argument to convince sellers not to get their own
property inspections: Buyers generally won’t believe anything in reports paid
for by sellers. According to these agents, buyers suspect that you’ll hire a go-
easy inspector to falsely report that your house is as solid as the Rock of
Gibraltar. Why spend several hundred dollars on an inspection report that
buyers won’t believe? Again, you can find a nugget of truth in this argument.
Only a suicidal chicken would ask the fox about how things are in the hen
house. More than one unscrupulous seller has paid an equally unscrupulous
inspector to write a false inspection report.
112
Part II: Tactical Considerations 
What you don’t know CAN get you in trouble
One of San Francisco’s more infamous real
estate horror stories involves a man trying to
sell his house. He didn’t get his property
inspected before putting it on the market
because he was absolutely certain his house
was in perfect condition. He should know. He
had never experienced one single problem with
it during nearly 25 years of ownership. The
house showed beautifully and was priced to
sell. He got a full asking price offer just two days
after the house went up for sale — so far, so
wonderful.
About a week later, the seller was stunned to
receive a copy of the buyer’s property inspec-
tion report stating that his house had a crum-
bling foundation and needed a new roof.
According to three contractor estimates the
buyers had obtained, repairs would cost 
about $45,000 for the indicated corrective work.
The seller was convinced that the buyer’s
inspector was an incompetent boob. He insisted
on getting a second inspection by an inspector
of his choice to debunk the buyer’s report.
The seller’s inspector confirmed everything in
the buyer’s report and, worse yet for the seller,
found additional damage that the first inspector
had missed. The seller’s contractor estimated
repairs would total nearly $60,000. Armed with
the second report, the seller offered the buyers
a $45,000 credit per their request. Too late. For
some strange reason, the buyers now wanted a
$60,000 corrective-work credit. The seller
offered to split the difference between the two
estimates, the buyers held out for $60,000, and
the deal fell apart.
The property sold nearly three months later,
shortly after the seller reduced his asking price
by $60,000 to compensate for the necessary
repairs. By that time, the seller had learned a
bitter truth: Killing the messenger doesn’t get rid
of a corrective work problem.

On the other hand, consider these four reasons to have your property thor-
oughly inspected before putting it on the market:
 Damage control: Suppose that your house needs a new roof. The prob-
lem is there whether you know about it or not. Why wait passively for an
ultimatum to fix the roof at a cost established by the buyer’s inspection
or kiss the deal goodbye? If you discover the problem before marketing
the house, you can either disclose it to prospective buyers with a repair
estimate or, although — as noted in Chapter 9 — we don’t recommend
this, you can do the work before putting your house up for sale. Your
negotiating position is much stronger if you know about problems in
advance — and accurately know the cost to correct them.
You can’t lose what you never had. Some buyers won’t want to tour your
house if they know that it needs a great deal of repair work. Those buyers
don’t want a fixer-upper. Even if you paid for all the repairs, they still
wouldn’t buy your house. Forget them. Concentrate on buyers who are
willing to do corrective work after the close of escrow if your price and
terms are fair.
 Financial planning: Chapter 3 explains that it’s very important to have 
a realistic estimate of your present house’s net proceeds of sale before
committing to buy a new home. Asking prices aren’t sale prices. If your
house needs major repairs, you’ll pay for them one way or another —
either by doing the repairs yourself, by reducing your asking price to
reflect the cost of repairs, or by giving buyers a credit in escrow to do
the work.
Latent defects — flaws hidden out of sight behind walls or concealed in
inaccessible areas, such as under your house or up in the attic where
you can’t see them — are time bombs. Defects you can’t see and don’t
know about (such as faulty wiring, a cracked heat-exchanger in your 
furnace, asbestos insulation, lead in your water pipes, and so on) are
potential deal killers. A good premarketing inspection can reveal all
these problems.
 Fine tuning: Professional property inspectors can help you spot minor
defects, such as dirty filters in the heating system; ventilation problems
in the basement, garage, or crawl space; blocked gutters; loose door-
knobs; stuck windows; a missing chimney hood or spark arrester, and so
on. Eliminating small maintenance problems like these gives prospective
buyers who tour the property a favorable — and correct — impression
that your house is extremely well-maintained.
 Peace of mind: The inspector alerts you to health and safety precau-
tions you should take. Installing smoke detectors, grounding electrical
outlets, clearing a clogged sewer line, and keeping flammable products
away from furnaces, heaters, and fireplaces, for example, make your
house safer for the next owner and safer for you as long as you continue
living in it.
113
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

Investigating inspectors
Quite a few so-called house inspectors have neither the background nor the
special training required to do premarketing house inspections. Compounding
your problem of finding a qualified inspector, few states certify, license, or
regulate house inspectors. And, as we all know from personal experience
with government regulation, states that do regulate house inspectors don’t
always do a good job. Anyone with a clipboard, a pickup truck, and a decent
houseside manner can instantly anoint himself or herself a house inspector
nearly anywhere in the country.
Avoid contractors who graciously offer to inspect your house and then do
repairs that they discover during their inspection. If, like us, you’re mechani-
cally challenged, unscrupulous contractors can use your ignorance to fatten
their wallets by billing you for phony corrective work they create themselves.
The best way around this conflict of interest is to hire someone who only per-
forms property inspections — a professional property inspector, not a 
contractor wearing two hats. Doing property inspections requires special
expertise that not all contractors, engineers, and architects have. Good pro-
fessional property inspectors earn their living solely from inspection fees and
don’t do corrective work. This restriction removes any temptation to find
unnecessary corrective work during inspections.
Finding property inspectors
Locating house inspectors is usually quite easy. One good source of property
inspectors is the Yellow Pages of your local phone book under “Building
Inspection Services” or “Home Inspection Services.” You can also ask friends
and business associates who’ve either bought or sold a house recently for the
names of their property inspectors. If you’re working with an agent, ask the
agent to recommend several highly regarded inspectors. Using a well-known
inspector with an excellent reputation increases your report’s credibility.
In the interest of full disclosure, allow prospective buyers to review your
inspection report prior to making an offer if they want. However, encourage
buyers to get their own inspections. Even the best inspector occasionally
misses defects. If the buyers rely solely on your report and find repair prob-
lems after the sale is complete, you don’t want them claiming that you inten-
tionally gave them a faulty inspection report to mislead them about your
house’s condition.
The American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI) is a professional association
of independent property inspectors. ASHI membership doesn’t guarantee
that the inspector is competent, but hiring a member of this organization
increases the likelihood that you’ll be working with a qualified professional.
You can’t buy your way into the ASHI by paying a fee. All ASHI-certified
114
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

members must have performed at least 250 property inspections and must
pass two written proficiency exams as a prerequisite of membership. ASHI
members must also adhere to the ASHI standards of practice, continuing edu-
cation requirements, and code of ethics. To find members in your area, call
ASHI at (800) 743-ASHI (2744) or visit its Web site at www.ashi.com.
Selecting your inspector
Choosing the right inspector takes a little effort. We recommend that you
interview several property inspectors before hiring one. The following 
questions can help you select the best inspector:
 Are you a full-time, professional property inspector? The only satisfac-
tory answer is yes.
 How many houses do you personally inspect annually? Although the
number of inspections varies from area to area, active inspectors usually
average from 100 to 300 inspections per year. Be sure that the inspector
works primarily in the vicinity of your house and is familiar with local
building regulations and codes as well as local problems (such as mud
slides, earthquakes, floods, or tornadoes).
 Do you have any special certifications or licenses? Property inspectors
generally have experience in some related field (such as construction,
architecture, or engineering) or have worked as an electrician, plumber,
or insurance-claim adjuster. This diversity brings extra depth to their
inspections. Membership in ASHI or other trade associations indicates
at least a minimal knowledge of house-inspection procedures. Ask about
the size of the inspector’s company and how long the company has been
in business.
 What’s the scope of your premarketing inspection? Be certain that the
inspection covers all your house’s major structural and mechanical sys-
tems, inside and out, from foundation to roof. Anything less is unaccept-
able. Thoroughly inspecting a house or condo of average size usually
takes three to four hours.
You probably won’t be invited to join the buyers when their property
inspector goes through your property. That’s why it’s critically impor-
tant that you (and your agent, if possible) tag along when your inspector
does the premarketing inspection. Reading the best report ever written
is no substitute for seeing defects with your own eyes and hearing your
inspector’s commentary on the significant findings. Use this opportunity
to question the inspector about a defect’s ramifications and explore cor-
rective work alternatives. After completing the inspection, you understand
why some defects cost megabucks to fix, and others are no big deal.
 Will your report include a cost estimate for you to do necessary cor-
rective work? Trick question. If the inspector says yes, don’t use the
inspector. Good property inspectors only do inspections. They don’t do
115
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

repair work themselves or generate referral fees for themselves by send-
ing work to their pals. A good inspector can, however, help you determine
repair costs by giving you a list of reputable contractors, roofers, electri-
cians, plumbers, and other tradespeople who can give you corrective
work quotes. Generally, more than one way is possible to fix a defect.
You must decide the best way to deal with a problem after you consult
the appropriate repair people.
 What type of report will I receive? Verbal reports and boilerplate, check-
list reports are usually worthless. You need a written, narrative-type
report that provides a detailed description of your house’s mechanical
and structural condition and clearly explains the implications of the
findings in plain English.
Get a sample report from each inspector you interview. The best way to
find out if an inspector writes good reports is to read one and draw your
own conclusion. We thoughtfully include a premarketing inspection report
in Appendix B so you know exactly what a good report looks like.
 Do you have errors-and-omissions (E & O) insurance? To err, unfortu-
nately, is all too human. Even the best inspector misses a defect or two
every now an then, which is why good property inspectors carry E & O
insurance. If your inspector accidentally makes a boo-boo that costs you
big bucks, E & O insurance can help ease your pain.
 May I call your recent customers for references? Good inspectors hap-
pily give you names and phone numbers for all the satisfied customers
you want. Bad inspectors, by definition, don’t have satisfied customers.
Check at least three references per inspector. Ask references if, after the
transaction was completed, major defects were discovered that the
inspector missed. Also see if they’d hire the inspector again.
 How much will your inspection cost? A good inspection can cost any-
where from $350 to $800 depending on the property’s size, the inspec-
tion’s scope and degree of detail, and where the property is located —
inspections cost least in the Midwest and South; they’re much more
expensive in urban areas of New York and California. Beware of unrealis-
tically low, “this week only” promotional fees offered by new inspectors
just starting in the business. Don’t let inexperienced inspectors practice
on you.
See if the premarketing inspection includes an additional consultation at a
later date to discuss the report’s findings with buyers who make an offer to
purchase your house. Because time is money, the inspector probably adds
an extra charge for this service. The fee is worth every penny, though, if the
property inspector’s explanation helps you negotiate a lower corrective
work credit.
116
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

The Officiating Escrow Officer
Even the simplest house sale involves many details that must be resolved to
everyone’s satisfaction before the sale can be completed. Without someone
to bridge the gulf between mutual buyer and seller distrust that exists in
most transactions, deals would grind to a halt.
Bridging that gulf of distrust, real estate (like other team sports) engages the
escrow officer, a referee who keeps the game civilized. Escrow officers aren’t
on anyone’s team; they’re neutral. They act as a disinterested third party for
buyers and sellers without showing favoritism to either party.
After you and the buyer have a signed contract, all the documents, funds, and
instructions related to your transaction usually are given to the escrow holder
specified in your purchase agreement by the buyer’s agent. We cover this
process, known as opening an escrow, in detail in Chapter 15.
Buyers and sellers often select an escrow holder based on the recommenda-
tions of their real estate agents. Depending on the location of your property,
local custom dictates whether your escrow is handled by a lawyer, bank, real
estate broker, or the firm that issues the title insurance.
Escrow fees range from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars
and are based on your property’s sale price. Once again, local custom nearly
always determines whether the buyer or seller pays for escrow, or whether
escrow fees are split 50/50. However, as Chapter 15 explains, this item often 
is negotiable.
Finding Financial and Tax Advisors
If you need the services of another advisor, such as a tax or financial advisor,
find one who works by the hour and doesn’t have a vested interest — because
they sell investments or manage money for an ongoing fee — in your house-
selling decision. Few financial advisors work on this basis. Although tax 
advisors are more likely than financial advisors to work for an hourly fee,
they tend to have a narrower-than-needed financial perspective. A competent
tax advisor may be able to help you structure the sale to maximize your tax
benefits. For most transactions, however, a tax advisor is unnecessary.
If you want to hire a financial or tax advisor, interview several before you
select one. Check with your agent, banker, lawyer, business associates, and
friends for referrals. As is the case with selecting your agent, you should get
client references from each tax advisor and call the references.
117
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

A good financial or tax advisor should possess the following qualities:
 Does the advisor work full time in this occupation? The realm of per-
sonal finances and taxes is too vast for you to trust a part-timer. You
need the services of a full-time professional.
 Does the advisor speak your language? Good advisors can explain your
options in simple terms. If you don’t understand exactly what the tax
advisor is saying, ask for clarification. If you still don’t understand, get
another tax advisor.
 Is the advisor objective? Hire someone who works solely by the hour
and doesn’t have a vested interest in the advice that they give you.
Never blindly follow the advice of experts because you’re in awe of their
expertise. Experts can be just as wrong as ordinary mortals.
 What is the advisor’s fee schedule? Hourly fees vary widely. Don’t pick
someone strictly on a cost-per-hour basis. An advisor who’s just begin-
ning to practice, for example, may only charge half as much as one with
20 years of experience. If the rookie takes four hours to do what the old
pro does in an hour, which advisor is more expensive in the long run?
Furthermore, the quality of the seasoned veteran’s advice may be supe-
rior to the quality of the novice’s advice.
 Is the tax advisor a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) or Enrolled
Agent (EA)? These professional designations indicate that the tax advi-
sor has satisfied special education and experience requirements and has
passed a rigorous licensing exam. A CPA does general accounting and
prepares tax returns. An EA focuses specifically on taxation. Only CPAs,
Enrolled Agents, and attorneys are authorized to represent you before
the IRS in the event of an audit.
 Does the tax advisor have experience with real estate transactions?
Tax practice, like law or medicine, is an extremely broad field. The tax
advisors that big corporations use may be wonderful, but they aren’t
necessarily best for you. You need a tax advisor whose clients have tax
problems like yours.
The best advisors in the world can’t do much to change the financial and tax
consequences of a transaction after the deal is done. If you’re going to con-
sult advisors, do so before you make significant financial decisions.
Locating a Good Lawyer
Lawyers are like seat belts. You never know when you may need one. Your
deal is rolling merrily along when out of nowhere — slam, bam, wham — 
you hit a legal pothole and end up in Sue City.
118
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

The real estate purchase agreement you sign is a legally binding contract
between you and the buyer. If you have any questions about the legality of
your contract, get a lawyer on your team immediately. No one else on the
team is qualified to give you legal advice.
Suppose the buyer’s contract is presented to you at night or on a weekend
when a lawyer isn’t readily available. Put a clause in the contract to stipulate
that your acceptance is contingent upon review and approval of the contract
by an attorney of your choice within five business days after you sign it.
To determine whether you need a lawyer on your team, check out the 
following factors:
 If no agent is involved: For example, suppose that you’re selling your
house by yourself. If neither you nor the buyer has an agent, get a
lawyer to prepare the contract, and have the lawyer do the work that an
agent would normally handle. As Chapter 6 explains, eliminating the real
estate agent doesn’t eliminate the disclosures, inspections, contingency
removals, and other details involved in the house-selling process.
 The location of your property: In states such as California, lawyers
rarely work on deals that only involve filling in the blanks on a standard,
preprinted purchase agreement that’s been previously reviewed and
approved by members of the state bar association. In other states, how-
ever, lawyers routinely do everything from preparing purchase contracts
to closing the escrow. Your agent, if you’re working with one, knows the
role that lawyers play in your locale.
 The complexity of your transaction: You need a lawyer if you get into a
complex financial or legal situation that can’t be covered by a standard-
ized contract. For example, suppose that you hold title as a tenant-
in-common and are selling a partial interest in the property, or that 
you want to structure the transaction as an intricate installment sale.
Whatever. Unless your agent also is a lawyer, the agent isn’t qualified to
do creative legal writing.
 If consulting an attorney helps you sleep at night: You may have the
world’s easiest deal. Still, if you feel more comfortable having a lawyer
review the contract, your peace of mind certainly is worth the cost of an
hour or two of legal time.
Choosing among lawyers
If, for whatever reason, you decide that you need a lawyer, interview several
before making your selection. Real estate law, like medicine, is highly special-
ized. A corporate attorney or the lawyer who handled your neighbor’s
119
Chapter 7: Your Real Estate Team

divorce isn’t necessarily the best choice for your real estate team. Get a
lawyer who specializes in residential real estate transactions. Good agents
and brokers usually are excellent referral sources because they work with
real estate lawyers all the time in their transactions.
A lawyer working for you needs to have the following qualities in her favor:
 Is a full-time lawyer and licensed to practice law in your state: Of
course.
 Is local talent: Real estate law, like real estate brokerage, not only varies
from state to state, it also changes from area to area within the same
state. Rent control laws, condominium conversion statutes, and zoning
codes, for example, usually are formulated and adopted by city or county
governing agencies. A good local lawyer knows these laws and has work-
ing relationships with people who administer them in your area.
 Has a realistic fee schedule: Lawyers’ fees vary widely. A good lawyer
gives you an estimate of how much it costs to handle your situation. As
with financial and tax advisors, the experience factor comes into play.
Seasoned lawyers generally charge more than novice lawyers, but sea-
soned lawyers also may get more done in an hour than inexperienced
lawyers can. A low fee is no bargain if the novice is learning on your
nickel. And you may pay the consequences if the novice fails to handle
your case properly.
 Has a good track record: If the lawyer you consult thinks that your case
may go to trial, find out whether that lawyer has courtroom experience
or intends to refer you to another lawyer. (Some lawyers don’t do trial
work.) Always ask about the lawyer’s track record of wins versus losses.
What good is a lawyer with a great deal of trial experience if that lawyer
never wins a case?
 Is a deal maker or a deal breaker (whichever is appropriate): Some
lawyers are great at putting deals together. Others specialize in blowing
them out of the water. Each skill is important. Depending on whether
you want the lawyer to get you out of a deal so you can accept a better
offer or need legal assistance to keep your deal together, be sure that
you have the right type of lawyer for your situation.
If your lawyer’s only solution to every problem is a lawsuit, you may be
in the clutches of a deal breaker who wants to run up big legal fees. Find
another lawyer!
 Speaks your language: A good lawyer explains your options clearly and
concisely without resorting to incomprehensible legalese. Then she gives
you a risk assessment of your options to help you make a sound decision.
For example, the lawyer may say that one course of action will take
longer but will give you a 90 percent chance of success, whereas the
faster option only gives you a 50/50 chance of prevailing.
120
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Working well with your lawyer
Whoever said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure must’ve
been thinking of lawyers. A two-hour preventative consultation with your
lawyer is infinitely less expensive than a two-month trial.
Good lawyers are excellent strategists. Given adequate lead time, they can
structure nearly any deal to your advantage. Conversely, if you bring wonder-
ful lawyers into the game after the deal is done, all they can do is damage
control. The best defense is a good offense.
Beware of the awe factor. People tend to hold lawyers in awe because their
word is law. Disobey lawyers and you go to jail. Baloney. Don’t blindly follow
your lawyer’s advice. If you don’t understand the advice or if you disagree
with it, question it. You may be correct and the lawyer may be wrong.
Lawyers are every bit as fallible as everyone else.

Listing Contracts 
and Commissions
In This Chapter
 Knowing the A-to-Zs of listing contracts
 Checking out the different types of listing terms
 Exploring broker compensation
 Setting up your disclosure statements
T
he single most important contract that you sign throughout the entire
process of selling your house is the one between you and the person 
who ultimately buys your property. Without that contract, you’d never be
anything more than a property owner who wants to be a seller.
What’s the second most important contract? If you guessed the listing con-
tract that you sign with the agent you hire to help sell your house, you win 
an all-expenses-paid trip to the next paragraph.
You’ve probably heard of listings, but most folks don’t really understand what
listings are or how they operate. We’re not talking about a listing of names in
a phone book. Nor does this listing have anything to do with transferring
ownership of your property to buyers. This chapter spells out everything you
need to know about listing contracts and tips on how you can negotiate com-
missions with agents.
Understanding Listing Contracts
In the context of selling property, a listing contract is a personal service con-
tract between you and a licensed real estate broker. This contract authorizes
the broker to act as your agent by finding someone to buy your house. The
listing contract contains two basic promises: The broker promises to do his
or her best to find a buyer for your property, and you promise to pay the
broker a commission.

Sounds simple, doesn’t it? Legally speaking (because listings are meant to be
legally binding agreements), the definition of a listing contract is a bit more
complex:
 An employment contract: A listing contract specifies the exact terms
and conditions of your employment contract with a licensed real estate
broker. It also authorizes the broker to represent you during the sale of
your property. As Chapter 7 explains, if the real estate agent you select
to work with doesn’t have a broker’s license or isn’t the broker of record
for the office, a licensed broker must supervise the agent and be respon-
sible for everything he does or fails to do.
 A compensation agreement: Although the listing broker’s pay is almost
always a commission based on a specified percentage of the sale price,
compensation doesn’t have to be a commission. Other possible options
include paying your broker a set fee for selling the property or compen-
sating the broker on an hourly fee basis.
Regardless of how the broker is paid, compensation is a negotiable item
decided by mutual agreement between you and the broker.
Although the listing contract doesn’t obligate you to sell your house, it may
obligate you to pay the broker a commission even if you don’t sell. The key is
whether the broker gets you an “acceptable” offer.
You may think that an acceptable offer is any offer a buyer makes to purchase
your house that you’d be willing to sign. If an offer isn’t acceptable to you,
you won’t sign it. But suppose that your broker brings you a valid, written
offer made by a ready, willing, and able buyer who wants to purchase your
house for the exact price and terms specified in your listing contract. You reject
the offer solely because you don’t like the buyer’s red tennis shoes.
In this example, you probably owe the broker a commission, even though you
didn’t accept the offer. Technically speaking, whether you ultimately sell the
house to the buyer who submitted the offer doesn’t matter if the buyer met
your price and terms.
“That’s not fair,” you say. “If I decide not to sell, why should I pay a commis-
sion?” The answer: Because you agreed to those terms when you signed the
listing. The broker found a buyer who was ready to accept your terms, willing
to enter into a contract of sale with you, and financially able to buy your
property. The listing agreement doesn’t specify that you actually have to sell
your property. If your broker fulfills his end of the contract by procuring an
acceptable buyer, you must honor your promise and pay the broker.
Buyers and agents almost always cooperate with sellers who are forced to
cancel a transaction because of the sudden occurrence of some dire unfore-
seen situation beyond their control, such as job loss or a death in the family.
They may get upset, though, if a seller suddenly decides not to go through
with a deal for no good reason.
124
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Breaking any contract may have serious legal consequences. A listing contract
is a legal contract. Don’t list your property on a lark just to test the water —
the water could get boiling hot quickly.
Considering the Types of Listings
Some brokers are so desperate for listings that they take oral listings. A
broker may, for example, introduce himself to you at a party, tell you he has
always admired your house, and ask if you’re interested in selling it. To brush
him off, you say that you may sell “at the right price.” He responds that he’ll
see what he can do for you.
The next thing you know, you’re besieged day and night by eager buyers
waving lowball offers in your face. Take one guess about who told these 
vultures your house was for sale.
Oral listings are a no-no. Samuel Goldwyn, the famous movie producer, once
said, “A verbal agreement isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.” Heed his
advice. If you want an enforceable contract, get the contract in writing and
always get a file copy of anything you sign (listing contract, purchase con-
tract, and so on) as soon as you sign it. ’Nuf said.
At first glance, you may think that you can choose from many different kinds
of listings. Appearances are, as usual, deceiving. All your various listing
options boil down to variations on two types of listings: exclusive listings 
and open listings. This section gives you the lowdown.
Exclusive listings
An exclusive listing is exactly that — an exclusive authorization giving only
one broker the right to find a buyer for your house. As simple as it sounds, 
an exclusive listing contract can take two different forms.
Exclusive agency listings
The broker designated in an exclusive agency listing is the one and only agent
authorized to sell your house during the term of the listing. If any other
licensed real estate broker or agent finds a buyer, your broker gets paid. Even
so, brokers think that this form of exclusive listing is just barely better than
no listing at all.
About now you may be wondering about the downside from the broker’s per-
spective? After all, you authorize the broker to be your sole agent. You’re not
playing the field with 50 or 100 other brokers on a winner-take-all basis. So
what’s the problem? You, dear house seller.
125
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

Because you aren’t a licensed real estate agent, the listing contract excludes
you. Under the terms of an exclusive agency listing, owners specifically
reserve the right to sell their own house directly and ace the broker out of 
a commission. Your broker — who should be your strongest ally — is your
competitor. The adversarial relationship isn’t good for you or your broker.
Exclusive agency listings discourage brokers from spending time or money
marketing property because the arrangement offers no assurance of a reward
for their efforts. Keeping listed property a secret isn’t the best way to sell it
quickly for top dollar.
Exclusive right to sell listings
An exclusive right to sell listing is also referred to as an exclusive authorization
and right to sell or just a plain, old exclusive. The exclusive is the most widely
used form of listing contract in the United States. It’s popular with sellers and
brokers because it provides the following:
 Maximum incentive for brokers: Under this form of exclusive listing,
the listing broker gets paid if anyone — even the owner — finds a ready,
willing, and able buyer for the property during the life of the contract.
Owner and broker are allies, not adversaries, with a mutually beneficial
goal of getting the listed property sold as quickly as possible for as
much money as possible. (See the nearby sidebar, “Listing exclusions:
Avoiding a commission by selling to friends,” for information about list-
ing exclusions, the one way you can sell your property without paying a
commission.)
 Maximum effort for seller: An exclusive right to sell listing gives your
listing broker a strong monetary incentive to focus his or her time, energy,
and advertising dollars on one priority — a fast, top-dollar sale of your
house. To that end, the listing broker should immediately cooperate 
with any and all other brokers who may have buyers for your property by
offering to split the compensation 50/50 (or whatever split is customary in
your area) with the broker who generates a ready, willing, and able buyer.
You know that you’re dealing with a bad broker if she wants to keep
your listing quiet for several weeks before advertising it and opening it
up to cooperating brokers. Greedy brokers sit on listings to give them-
selves and the agents in their offices time to sell your house to buyers
with whom they’re working. They want someone in their office to gener-
ate an offer for your property so the listing office can get the entire 
commission. Brokers call this tactic “getting both ends of a deal.” From
your perspective, a more apt description would be “getting the shaft.”
Chapter 11 reveals that the secret of getting a top-dollar price when you
sell is to generate spirited buyer competition for your house by getting
broad, immediate market exposure. Nothing is terribly wrong with giving
your listing broker a day or two head start on other brokers, if you
approve. A broker who wants to keep your listing in-house more than 
48 hours, however, is unworthy of being your listing agent.
126
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

Exclusive right to sell listing contracts vary widely in length, wording, and
complexity from one state to another and from city to city within any given
state. Under these circumstances, the listing contract you ultimately sign
probably won’t look exactly like the California Association of Realtors
(C.A.R.) exclusive listing contract shown in Figures 8-1a, 8-1b, and 8-1c. The
C.A.R. listing is, nonetheless, a fine example of a well-written, comprehensive
listing agreement.
127
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions
Listing exclusions: Avoiding a commission 
by selling to friends
Suppose that you invited your best friends over
to your house last year for Thanksgiving dinner.
After a magnificent feast, you’re all sitting by the
fireplace eating scrumptious slices of pumpkin
pie. Basking contentedly in the fire’s rosy glow,
your pal Martin says, “You know Faye (his wife)
and I have always admired your home. If you
ever decide you want to sell it, let us know. We
would buy your place in a nanosecond.”
You may have heard something like that from
friends or business associates. When push
comes to shove, however, nothing usually
comes of these conversations. Talk is cheap.
But what if Martin and Faye really meant it? If
there’s even one chance in a thousand that they
were serious, why pay a broker to find buyers
until you give your pals a chance to put up or
shut up? You can use a perfectly acceptable
method to avoid paying a commission for people
you identify as potential buyers of your house.
This method is called a listing exclusion.
You can amend your listing agreement so that if
Faye and Martin — or anyone else you specifi-
cally exclude from the listing — actually pur-
chases your house during the exclusion period,
you won’t have to pay the broker a commission.
Always put a time limit on listing exclusions. A
couple of weeks usually is enough time for seri-
ous buyers to explore their financial options and
get back to you with a decision. For example, tell
your broker that you want a two-week exclusion
for Martin and Faye. Don’t sign the listing unless
the broker agrees to the exclusion and further
agrees not to market your house at all during
those two weeks. If the broker agrees to these
stipulations, sign the listing.
By listing your house with a broker, your actions
prove to Faye and Martin that you’re a serious
seller. By putting a fuse on the listing exclusion,
you establish a time frame within which they
must act or be treated like any other buyers.
Without a deadline, folks tend to stall by asking
for more time to think it over.
Don’t make the mistake of giving any buyers you
exclude additional time. How long can you put
your life on hold while they think it over? What’s
to think over? Either they want to buy your
house, or they don’t want to buy it. Real buyers
will tie up your property with a contract of sale
as fast as possible.
During the two-week exclusion period, you
don’t have to worry about paying a commission
to the broker. If Martin and Faye make an offer
you can’t refuse, you simply cancel the listing
and sell the house to your friends. The broker
won’t be upset because she didn’t waste any
time or money marketing your house.
If, however, the two weeks pass without an
offer from your pals, your house goes on the
market without the stigma of any exclusions.
And you have the comfort of knowing that you
explored the possibility of avoiding a commis-
sion by selling directly to your friends.

Regardless of the wording in your contract, here are a few fundamental facts
to keep in mind about all exclusive listings:
 Listings are intended to be legal contracts. Real estate agents hate the
word contract because it scares people and puts them on guard. They
prefer to call contracts agreements because agreements sound less
threatening. Whatever your listing is called, the intent is to create a
legally binding contract between you and the listing broker. Read it 
carefully. Consult a real estate lawyer if you have questions or concerns
about the listing’s fine points. Agents aren’t qualified to answer legal
questions.
 An exclusive listing must have a definite termination date. Note that
paragraph 1 of the form in Figure 8-1a provides a “Listing Period” com-
mencing on a specific date and expiring at 11:59 p.m. on an equally spe-
cific date. Don’t sign any exclusive listing that starts when the contract
is prepared and runs “until sold” or “until canceled in writing” or any
other type of indefinite duration.
 A broker protection clause keeps everyone honest. Just as a few real
estate agents are dishonest, some sellers and buyers also behave unethi-
cally. For example, a seller may tell an interested buyer that the listing
contract with the broker is about to expire. Without a broker, the seller
won’t have to pay a commission. The seller offers to pass on a portion of
the savings to the buyer by lowering the asking price, if they sign the
deal after the listing contract’s expiration date. Paragraph 4.A. (2) of the
sample listing contract shown in Figure 8-1a is known as the broker pro-
tection clause. This clause prohibits (for a specified period of time) the
homeowner from selling directly to a buyer. If a broker finds a suitable
buyer for a property, the clause requires that the seller pay the broker’s
commission according to the listing contract.
Brokers generally ask for at least a 90-day buffer period. The time frame
is, however, negotiable. In most cases, 30 to 60 days gives the broker suf-
ficient protection. Regardless of the buffer period you agree to, be sure
that the broker protection clause in your listing contract includes this
statement: This section shall not apply if Seller enters into a valid listing
agreement with another licensed real estate broker after the final termina-
tion of this agreement. This clause protects you from the possibility of
paying two commissions if you relist your house with a second broker
and a dispute develops after the first broker’s listing expires.
 Title verification is critically important. Paragraph 5 of the sample list-
ing contract in Figure 8-1b asks who has title to the property, because
anyone who signs a listing contract obligates himself to pay a commis-
sion, even if that person ultimately can only convey a partial interest in
the property.

COMPENSATION TO BROKER:
Notice: The amount or rate of real estate commissions is not fixed by law. They are set by each Broker
individually and may be negotiable between Seller and Broker (real estate commissions include all
compensation and fees to Broker).
A.
Seller agrees to pay to Broker as compensation for services irrespective of agency relationship(s), either 
_________ percent
of the listing price (or if a purchase agreement is entered into, of the purchase price), or
$ ___________________________,
AND ________________________________________________________________________________________, as follows:
(1) If during the Listing Period, or any extension, Broker, Seller, cooperating broker, or any other person procures a buyer(s)
who offers to purchase the Property on the above price and terms, or on any price and terms acceptable to Seller. (Broker
is entitled to compensation whether any escrow resulting from such offer closes during or after the expiration of the Listing
Period.)
OR (2) If within ______ calendar days (a) after the end of the Listing Period or any extension; or (b) after any cancellation of this
Agreement, unless otherwise agreed, Seller enters into a contract to sell, convey, lease or otherwise transfer the Property to
anyone (“Prospective Buyer”) or that person’s related entity: (i) who physically entered and was shown the Property during
the Listing Period or any extension by Broker or a cooperating broker; or (ii) for whom Broker or any cooperating broker
submitted to Seller a signed, written offer to acquire, lease, exchange or obtain an option on the Property. Seller, however,
shall have no obligation to Broker under paragraph 4A(2) unless, not later than 3 calendar days after the end of the Listing
Period or any extension or cancellation, Broker has given Seller a written notice of the names of such Prospective Buyers.
OR (3) If, without Broker’s prior written consent, the Property is withdrawn from sale, conveyed, leased, rented, otherwise transferred,
or made unmarketable by a voluntary act of Seller during the Listing Period, or any extension.
B.
If completion of the sale is prevented by a party to the transaction other than Seller, then compensation due under paragraph
4A shall be payable only if and when Seller collects damages by suit, arbitration, settlement or otherwise, and then in an amount
equal to the lesser of one-half of the damages recovered or the above compensation, after first deducting title and escrow
expenses and the expenses of collection, if any.
C.
In addition, Seller agrees to pay Broker: _____________________________________________________________________.

$_____________________.
(2) Broker is authorized to cooperate with and compensate brokers operating outside the MLS as per Broker’s policy.
E.
Seller hereby irrevocably assigns to Broker the above compensation from Seller’s funds and proceeds in escrow. Broker may
submit this Agreement, as instructions to compensate Broker pursuant to paragraph 4A, to any escrow regarding the Property
involving Seller and a buyer, Prospective Buyer or other transferee.
F.
(1) Seller represents that Seller has not previously entered into a listing agreement with another broker regarding the Property,
unless specified as follows: ___________________________________________________________________________.
(2) Seller warrants that Seller has no obligation to pay compensation to any other broker regarding the Property unless the
Property is transferred to any of the following individuals or entities: ___________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________________________________________.

OWNERSHIP,TITLE AND AUTHORITY: Seller warrants that: (i) Seller is the owner of the Property; (ii) no other persons or entities
have title to the Property; and (iii) Seller has the authority to both execute this Agreement and sell the Property. Exceptions to
ownership, title and authority are as follows: ____________________________________________________________________.
6.
MULTIPLE LISTING SERVICE: All terms of the transaction, including financing, if applicable, will be provided to the selected MLS
for publication, dissemination and use by persons and entities on terms approved by the MLS. Seller authorizes Broker to comply
with all applicable MLS rules. MLS rules allow MLS data to be made available by the MLS to additional Internet sites unless Broker
gives the MLS instructions to the contrary. MLS rules generally provide that residential real property and vacant lot listings be
submitted to the MLS within 48 hours or some other period of time after all necessary signatures have been obtained on the listing
agreement. However, Broker will not have to submit this listing to the MLS if, within that time, Broker submits to the MLS a form signed
by Seller (C.A.R. Form SEL or the locally required form) instructing Broker to withhold the listing from the MLS. Information about
this listing will be provided to the MLS of Broker’s selection unless a form instructing Broker to withhold the listing from the MLS is
attached to this listing Agreement.
7.
SELLER REPRESENTATIONS: Seller represents that, unless otherwise specified in writing, Seller is unaware of: (i) any Notice of
Default recorded against the Property; (ii) any delinquent amounts due under any loan secured by, or other obligation affecting, the
Property; (iii) any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding affecting the Property; (iv) any litigation, arbitration, administrative
action, government investigation or other pending or threatened action that affects or may affect the Property or Seller’s ability to
transfer it; and (v) any current, pending or proposed special assessments affecting the Property. Seller shall promptly notify Broker
in writing if Seller becomes aware of any of these items during the Listing Period or any extension thereof.
8.
BROKER’S AND SELLER’S DUTIES: Broker agrees to exercise reasonable effort and due diligence to achieve the purposes of
this Agreement. Unless Seller gives Broker written instructions to the contrary, Broker is authorized to order reports and disclosures
as appropriate or necessary and advertise and market the Property by any method and in any medium selected by Broker, including
MLS and the Internet, and, to the extent permitted by these media, control the dissemination of the information submitted to any
medium. Seller agrees to consider offers presented by Broker, and to act in good faith to accomplish the sale of the Property by,
among other things, making the Property available for showing at reasonable times and referring to Broker all inquiries of any party
interested in the Property. Seller is responsible for determining at what price to list and sell the Property. Seller further agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Broker harmless from all claims, disputes, litigation, judgments and attorney fees arising from
any incorrect information supplied by Seller, or from any material facts that Seller knows but fails to disclose.
9.
DEPOSIT: Broker is authorized to accept and hold on Seller’s behalf any deposits to be applied toward the purchase price.
10. AGENCY RELATIONSHIPS:
A.
Disclosure: If the Property includes residential property with one-to-four dwelling units, Seller shall receive a “Disclosure
Regarding Agency Relationships” form prior to entering into this Agreement.
B.
Seller Representation: Broker shall represent Seller in any resulting transaction, except as specified in paragraph 4F.
C.
Possible Dual Agency With Buyer: Depending upon the circumstances, it may be necessary or appropriate for Broker to act
as an agent for both Seller and buyer, exchange party, or one or more additional parties (“Buyer”). Broker shall, as soon as
practicable, disclose to Seller any election to act as a dual agent representing both Seller and Buyer. If a Buyer is procured
directly by Broker or an associate-licensee in Broker’s firm, Seller hereby consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for Seller
and such Buyer. In the event of an exchange, Seller hereby consents to Broker collecting compensation from additional parties
for services rendered, provided there is disclosure to all parties of such agency and compensation. Seller understands and
agrees that: (i) Broker, without the prior written consent of Seller, will not disclose to Buyer that Seller is willing to sell the
Property at a price less than the listing price; (ii) Broker, without the prior written consent of Buyer, will not disclose to Seller
that Buyer is willing to pay a price greater than the offered price; and (iii) except for (i) and (ii) above, a dual agent is obligated
to disclose known facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the Property to both parties.
D.
Other Sellers: Seller understands that Broker may have or obtain listings on other properties, and that potential buyers may
consider, make offers on, or purchase through Broker, property the same as or similar to Seller’s Property. Seller consents to
Broker’s representation of sellers and buyers of other properties before, during and after the end of this Agreement.
E.
Confirmation: If the Property includes residential property with one-to-four dwelling units, Broker shall confirm the agency
relationship described above, or as modified, in writing, prior to or concurrent with Seller’s execution of a purchase agreement.
11. SECURITY AND INSURANCE: Broker is not responsible for loss of or damage to personal or real property, or person, whether
attributable to use of a keysafe/lockbox, a showing of the Property, or otherwise. Third parties, including, but not limited to, appraisers,
inspectors, brokers and prospective buyers, may have access to, and take videos and photographs of, the interior of the Property.
Seller agrees: (i) to take reasonable precautions to safeguard and protect valuables that might be accessible during showings of the
Property; and (ii) to obtain insurance to protect against these risks. Broker does not maintain insurance to protect Seller.
12. KEYSAFE/LOCKBOX: A keysafe/lockbox is designed to hold a key to the Property to permit access to the Property by Broker, 
cooperating brokers, MLS participants, their authorized licensees and representatives, authorized inspectors, and 
accompanied prospective buyers. Broker, cooperating brokers, MLS and Associations/Boards of REALTORS® are not insurers
against injury, theft, loss, vandalism or damage attributed to the use of a keysafe/lockbox. Seller does (or if checked 
does
not) authorize Broker to install a keysafe/lockbox.
If Seller does not occupy the Property, Seller shall be responsible for
obtaining occupant(s)’ written permission for use of a keysafe/lockbox.
13. SIGN: Seller does (or if checked 
does not) authorize Broker to install a FOR SALE/SOLD sign on the Property.
14. EQUAL HOUSING OPPORTUNITY: The Property is offered in compliance with federal, state and local anti-discrimination laws.
15. ATTORNEY FEES: In any action, proceeding or arbitration between Seller and Broker regarding the obligation to pay compensation
under this Agreement, the prevailing Seller or Broker shall be entitled to reasonable attorney fees and costs from the non-prevailing
Seller or Broker, except as provided in paragraph 19A.

Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

Unless all the parties who hold title in a property join in the sale, a full
interest in the property can’t be sold. To avoid future problems, the 
listing broker wants to be sure that all property owners sign the listing
contract.
Just as death is nature’s way of warning you to slow down, a co-owner’s
refusal to sign a listing is real estate’s way of warning you about a poten-
tial deal killer. If your spouse (or a co-owner in a tenancy-in-common
partnership) won’t sign the listing, that person probably will also refuse
to sign a sale contract. Don’t sign a listing until you resolve the co-owner’s
problem, and all owners are willing to sign it.
 A Multiple Listing Service (MLS) option offers benefits. Paragraph 6 of
the form in Figure 8-1b gives sellers the option of having information
about their listing put into the local MLS. Chapter 12 provides reasons
why listing information about your property in the MLS is a good idea.
In some areas, brokers use the MLS contract to sign up their listings. If
that’s the case in your area, signing your contract automatically places
your property in the MLS database. In all other respects, a multiple list-
ing contract operates the same way as any other exclusive right to sell
listing contract.
 Alternative dispute resolution options can save you time and money.
Lawsuits are time consuming and darned expensive, to boot. Most real
estate contracts — listing contracts and purchase contracts — now have
provisions for alternative dispute resolution, a phrase that describes using
either mediation or arbitration (see paragraph 19 of Figure 8-1c) to resolve
contract disputes faster and generally in less expensive ways than litiga-
tion in a court of law. This provision makes sense. No one, including a
good lawyer, wants you to needlessly waste time and money in court.
132
Part II: Tactical Considerations 
How long is long enough?
We can offer no one correct answer to the
question of how long your listing’s duration
should be. Unless you have good reason to
believe that extra time will be necessary to find
a buyer for your house (because either the
property is unusual or because the local real
estate market is in the dumps), we strongly 
recommend a 90-day listing period.
Why 90 days? Dr. Samuel Johnson, the famous
18th-century writer, once said, “When a man
knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it con-
centrates his mind wonderfully.” Three months
are, under normal circumstances, long enough
to give the listing broker a good chance to 
sell your house, yet short enough to keep 
the broker’s mind concentrated on the job at
hand — finding a buyer for your property before
the listing expires.
If your house hasn’t sold after 90 days but you
were pleased with the listing broker’s efforts on
your behalf, you can simply renew the listing.
But, on the other hand, if you were unhappy
with the listing broker’s service, 90 days isn’t 
forever. After the listing expires, find yourself 
a different and, hopefully, a better broker.

Open listings
An open listing is a nonexclusive authorization for brokers to find a buyer for
your property. You can give as many brokers as you want an open listing on
your house. It’s the real estate version of a winner-take-all horse race.
You’re obligated to pay a commission to the first broker who fulfills either of
the following conditions:
 Finds a buyer ready, willing, and able to enter into a contract that meets
the exact terms of your listing
 Procures the buyer whose offer you ultimately accept
If you find the buyer by yourself, you don’t have to pay any of the brokers.
And you can cancel an open listing any time you want without penalty.
If this arrangement sounds wonderful, think again. Smart sellers won’t give
brokers an open listing and good brokers won’t accept them. Here’s why:
 Limited advertising and marketing of your property: In many places,
depending on the local rules, brokers can’t put open listings into the
MLS. This restriction is a big disadvantage. As we note in Chapter 12, the
MLS is a highly effective tool that brokers use to internally advertise list-
ings to other MLS members who may have buyers for their listings. Nor
do brokers produce fancy brochures or put big classified ads in the
newspaper to tell the world about an open listing. Why should they?
Potential buyers may end up going to another broker or directly to the
seller to write up an offer. The seller may also suddenly decide to cancel
the listing.
Brokers only advertise or market open listings as a last resort if they
have nothing more promising to do. They disdainfully refer to open list-
ings as pocket listings because brokers tuck them away “in their pocket”
passively waiting for a buyer to come along. If you want a quick sale, an
open listing isn’t the way to get one.
 No control: If you give 10 brokers an open listing on your house, you
end up doing work that a listing agent normally handles. All the agents
call you to coordinate showings of your property. You must prepare the
house for showings. You also have to debrief agents after showings to
find out whether you’re getting an offer and, if not, find out why not. You
have no neck to wring if you come home after work and find that some-
one left the front door unlocked and let the cat out after a showing. If
you like chaos, you’ll like an open listing.
133
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

 Your broker is your competitor: Because you don’t have to pay any broker
if you sell the house yourself, brokers see you as a competitor. This adver-
sarial relationship encourages brokers to work for buyers, not you. Brokers
know that if they take care of their buyers, they’ll get a commission sooner
or later. No such loyalty exists in their relationship with you.
An open listing is barely better than no listing at all. Unless you have an
extremely compelling reason that you absolutely, positively must list your
house with a bevy of brokers, you’ll be better served with an exclusive
listing.
Examining Broker Compensation
When most people hear the term broker compensation, they immediately
think of a commission based on a percentage of the property’s sale price.
Commissions are the most common method of broker compensation so 
that’s a logical place to start. However, commissions aren’t the only way to
pay brokers. Keep reading this section for a rundown on commissions.
Commissions
In the following list, we try to answer questions you’ve had about commissions
but may have been too embarrassed to ask. Don’t worry. Questions are good.
If you didn’t have any questions, we wouldn’t get to write a book! Check out
the following important questions:
 Who pays the commission? Usually sellers pay the commission, although
in rare cases, buyers pay their agents directly. After all, sellers get money
when property sells. Buyers generally don’t have funds left for anything
more expensive than a Big Mac after making a cash down payment to
buy the house, plus paying loan charges, property inspections fees,
homeowners insurance premiums, moving costs, and other miscella-
neous expenses of purchase.
 Are commissions set by law? There’s no such thing as a legal minimum
commission or a mandatory percentage. Commissions vary from one
area to the next. The price and type of property being sold also affect
the percentage. Commissions on houses, for example, usually range
from 4 to 7 percent of the sale price, and commissions on vacant land
can go as high as 10 percent.
134
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 Are commissions negotiable? Absolutely! If a real estate broker or agent
tells you otherwise, dump ’em. In fact, most listing contracts contain 
language similar to the following notice contained in paragraph 4 of the
C.A.R. listing: “Notice: The amount or rate of real estate commissions is
not fixed by law. They are set by each Broker individually and may be
negotiable between Seller and Broker (real estate commissions include
all compensation and fees to Broker).”
Unbelievably, the vast majority of people who use the services of real
estate agents erroneously believe that commissions aren’t negotiable. 
In an Opinion Research Corporation survey for AARP, only 26 percent of
respondents correctly chose the answer that commissions can be 
negotiated.
Bartering over commissions
Knowing that commissions are negotiable is fine. By itself, however, that
information is worthless. This section deals with ways to translate your
knowledge into a lower commission.
Be sure to read Chapter 13 before beginning your negotiations. Good negotia-
tors replace emotions with facts. People can get their feelings hurt. Facts
don’t have any feelings to hurt. Don’t try to outargue agents; outfact them.
135
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions
Mediation and arbitration
Mediation generally is the fastest, least expen-
sive way to resolve simple problems. You and
the broker (if the dispute is over a listing con-
tract) or you and the buyer (if the problem arises
from a dispute related to the purchase contract)
present your differences to a neutral third party
called a mediator. The mediator can’t impose a
settlement on either of the quarreling parties.
Instead, the mediator attempts to help both par-
ties work together to reach an agreement
regarding a mutually satisfactory solution to
their problem.
If mediation fails to resolve the dispute, or if
your problem is too complex to handle by medi-
ation, arbitration also is generally less costly
and faster than going to court. During arbitra-
tion, the parties present their differences to a
neutral arbitrator who listens to all the evidence
and then makes a binding decision that resolves
the dispute. The arbitrator’s decision is final and
is as enforceable as a judgment handed down
in court. If you’re ever a party in a mediation or
arbitration, consult a good real estate lawyer.

Before entering into commission negotiations, you must know these important
facts:
 What’s the going rate for commissions in your area? Straight 6 percent
commissions on the sale price may be the norm in your neighborhood. 
A tiered commission schedule is possible, such as 6 percent on the first
$100,000 of sale price, 5 percent on the next $50,000, and 4 percent on
the balance. Or, to provide more incentive to agents, commissions may
increase from 5 percent on the first $100,000 to 6 percent on the balance.
Check local commission rates by questioning several real estate agents
as well as friends and business associates who’ve sold property recently.
Note: In some areas, high-end houses are listed at a reduced commission
rate. If, for example, you’re the proud owner of a $500,000 house, the stan-
dard commission rate on property in that price range may be 5 percent
rather than the 6 percent commission for less expensive houses.
 How’s the real estate market? Market competition is the number one
reason commissions are or aren’t cut. In a buyers’ market when listings
are a dime a dozen, agents have little incentive to cut commissions.
They need buyers, not more listings. In a sellers’ market, however, when
listings are extremely scarce and buyers are plentiful, agents are more
willing to shave commissions.
136
Part II: Tactical Considerations 
Commission splits
Suppose that your house sells for $300,000. With a
6 percent commission, the sale generates an
$18,000 commission. If your listing broker receives
the entire $18,000, she’ll be one happy camper.
Unfortunately for her, that isn’t what happens.
Brokerage commissions almost always are split
50/50 at the close of escrow. In your transaction,
for example, your listing broker gets half $9,000
in our example) of the commission. The other
$9,000 goes to a cooperating agent from another
firm who represents the buyer.
Because your broker is a licensed independent
broker, she doesn’t split her $9,000 with anyone.
The buyer’s agent holds a salesperson’s license,
however, so the selling-side commission is paid
to the agent’s broker, who then splits the $9,000
50/50 with the agent so each end up with $4,500.
(Top-notch agents can receive 80 percent or
more of the total commission.)
If you want to be effective during commission
negotiations, understanding internal commis-
sion splits among agents and brokers is impor-
tant. Most agents don’t have the authority to cut
a commission without getting their broker’s
approval. By the same token, brokers can’t uni-
laterally agree to commission cuts that affect
their agents. As a rule, brokers and agents have
to agree to a commission reduction because a
cut reduces both of their commissions.

 How badly does the broker or agent need listings? Brokerage firms
love listings because they make phones ring for agents in the office.
Buyers who read about your house in the broker’s classified ad call the
office to get more details. If your house isn’t right for them, the agent
who got the call can, at least, make a contact and may end up selling the
caller another property. The listing agent uses your listing to develop
more business by mailing prospecting letters about the listing to other
property owners in your neighborhood and by holding open houses to
generate buyers and listings. If a prospective listing broker’s weekly ad
seems short of listings compared to other offices, you probably have a
good chance of cutting a deal on the commission.
 Is your house in good condition and will it be priced to sell? The faster
that your house sells, the less time, money, and effort a broker must
spend advertising and marketing it. Houses in good condition usually
sell faster than fixer-uppers. If your house is not only in great shape but
also is priced realistically, some brokers share their savings with you by
reducing the commission. However, commission cuts are hard to negoti-
ate when you want a record-high sale price for your neighborhood, expect
the broker to do a great deal of expensive advertising, and want your
house held open every Saturday and Sunday until it sells.
 Are you a package deal? If you intend to sell your house and purchase 
a new home through the same broker, you’re twice as valuable to the
broker because you represent two deals: a listing and a sale. Brokers
may take that fact into account and offer you a “volume discount” by
reducing the listing commission.
As we discuss in Chapter 7, you need to select an agent who has the
skills and experience required for your particular transaction. Unless
you’re moving within the same geographical area, you’re buying a simi-
lar type of property, and your listing agent has the requisite skills to
work as a buyer’s agent, you may need a different agent to represent 
you in the purchase of your new home.
Recognizing good versus bad commission cuts
Handled properly, a good commission reduction saves money without adversely
affecting the length of time the house is on the market or the sale price. Bad
commission cuts are false economies, because they end up extending the
selling process and reducing your ultimate sale price by cutting the incentive
of cooperating brokers to show and sell your property.
Assume that the prevailing commission rate in your area is 6 percent for
houses like yours. During the agent selection interviews, you point out to 
the prospective listing agents that your house is in excellent condition. You
tell each of them that you want to price your house realistically for a fast sale
137
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

because you want to buy a larger house in the immediate vicinity before your
baby is born three months from now. By determining how the listing broker
proposes to split the commission with selling brokers, you can know when a
commission cut is good or bad. For example:
 Deep discount special: “I’ll list your house for 4 percent,” the first broker
says, “but only if I sell it myself. I want the whole commission. I won’t
cooperate with other agents.” A 4 percent commission sounds great. In
fact, it’s awful. If your listing agent won’t work with other agents to find a
buyer, your house’s market exposure is severely reduced. As a result,
your house takes longer to sell and ultimately sells for less money. On
top of all that, you’ll have months of extra payments on your mortgage,
property taxes, and homeowners insurance. This “deal” costs you far
more than you can save.
 Selling broker absorbs cut: The second broker offers you a 5 percent
commission. He proposes to give cooperating agents 2 percent and keep
3 percent (half of a full 6 percent commission) for himself. Picking the
pockets of agents who represent buyers is stupid. This split makes the
greedy listing broker happy, but turns off cooperating agents. Why?
Because, under this arrangement, your house is advertised in the Multiple
Listing Service with a 2 percent commission, putting it at a competitive
disadvantage to other houses advertised paying a 3 percent commission
to cooperating agents. If agents can find another house as nice as yours
in the same price range but offering a full 3 percent commission, guess
which house they’ll try harder to sell?
 Even split: The third broker offers to list your house for a 5 percent
commission, which she’ll split 50/50 if a cooperating agent obtains the
buyer for your house. Both listing and selling agents get 2.5 percent,
which isn’t too much off the going rate of 3 percent. That deal seems 
fair, you think. Fair, yes. Smart, no. A reduction in the cooperating
agent’s commission from the norm for a property like yours acts as a
disincentive for commission-motivated real estate agents to show and
sell your house.
 Listing broker absorbs cut: The last broker suggests a 5.5 percent com-
mission, but says that he’ll take 2.5 percent for the listing side and give
cooperating agents 3 percent. Offering selling agents a full 3 percent
commission ensures that you’ll have their enthusiastic cooperation.
This commission split is the best way for you to go.
Suppose that your house sells for $300,000. Each 1 percent of the sale price
equals $3,000, which is significant money for you and the agents. If the listing
agent volunteers to shave the listing-side commission by $1,500 (0.5 percent),
138
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

that’s swell. But don’t mess with the selling side. Taking another 0.5 percent
out of the selling-side commission may cost you more than $1,500 in reduced
activity by cooperating agents.
The amount of commission that you pay ultimately is less important than the
value you receive for the money you spend. Some top-notch agents won’t 
cut commissions. Compared to mediocre agents, the best agents pay their
own commissions because they’re able to get more money for a house.
Consider this premise when you’re trying to negotiate a lower commission with
a prospective listing agent: If the agent can’t defend her money (the commis-
sion) by persuading you that she’s worth the commission she charges, how
effectively will she defend your money from buyers who want to cut your asking
price or get a bigger credit for corrective work? The agent who ultimately
convinces you that she’s worth every penny of a full commission may be the
best agent for your team — given that the agent satisfies all the other listing
agent selection criteria in Chapter 7.
Net listings
Unlike an open listing or an exclusive listing, a net listing isn’t a type of list-
ing. Rather, a net listing is a way to pay brokers. Under the terms of a net 
listing, the seller and broker make this agreement: When property sells, the
broker is paid all money received over and above a predetermined net amount
that goes to the seller. Because the net listing is a payment method, it can be
used with either open or exclusive listing contracts.
For example, you tell the listing broker that you want to net $200,000 from the
sale of your house after paying off the existing $70,000 mortgage and all other
expenses of sale except, of course, the brokerage fee. According to the broker,
your house is worth around $300,000, and expenses of sale in your area typi-
cally run about $10,000.
If everything goes according to plan and your house actually sells for $300,000,
the broker earns $20,000 — $300,000 less $70,000 to pay off the loan, $10,000
for expenses of sale, and $200,000 to you. As far as you’re concerned, you’re
happy to pay a $20,000 brokerage fee if you can clear $200,000 for yourself.
139
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

Unfortunately, sales rarely go according to plan in the real world. For example,
consider the following possibilities:
 The broker overestimated your house’s value. What if no one will pay
more than $280,000 for your property? That’s fine with you. You can pay
off the loan, pay the $10,000 for expenses of sale, and still walk away with
$200,000. Because no money is left, however, all your broker gets is a pat
on the back.
Under the circumstances, a bad listing broker may discourage prospec-
tive buyers from offering $280,000 by falsely telling them that you
absolutely won’t accept a penny less than $300,000. If a cooperating
broker brings in a $280,000 offer, a bad listing agent may advise you not
to accept the “lowball” offer and tell you to hold out for more money. Or
worse yet, the broker may not even tell you about the offer in the first
place. In either case, the broker is putting the commission (or lack
thereof) ahead of your best interests as a seller.
 The broker underestimated your house’s value. What if your house sells
for $320,000? As Chapter 10 explains, pricing property is an imprecise
art. If the listing broker says that your house is “worth around $300,000,”
a $20,000 variation in its value one way or the other is an acceptable
margin of error. Even so, how will you feel paying the broker $40,000 
(a whopping 12.5 percent commission!) because your house sold at the
high end of its fair market value? Worse yet, what if the listing broker pur-
posely understated your house’s value to get a bigger fee? That’s fraud.
Net listings are illegal in some states because of their high level of risk for
broker fraud or misrepresentation. Even if using a net listing is perfectly legal
in your area, that still doesn’t make it a good way to compensate brokers.
Don’t use a net listing.
Discount brokers
So-called full-service real estate brokers, as their title indicates, handle many
tasks and details related to your property’s sale and charge a full commission
for their services. A good listing broker does the following:
 Determines your house’s fair market value
 Helps you prepare the property for marketing
 Handles all its advertising
 Holds Sunday open houses as well as open houses for cooperating 
brokers
140
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

 Schedules private showings for buyers
 Negotiates with buyers or their agents to get you the best possible price
and terms of sale
 Makes sure that all the contract details are handled properly right up to
the close of escrow
Your job is to serve as supervisor and decision maker.
At the opposite end of the service spectrum is the For Sale By Owner (FSBO)
option. As Chapter 6 discusses, FSBO sellers don’t have a listing broker. If you
choose the FSBO option, you handle all the listing broker’s chores yourself
and thus avoid paying the listing agent’s portion of a brokerage fee when
your house sells. (As we note in Chapter 6, you may have to pay the buyer’s
agent a brokerage fee to put your deal together.)
Discount brokers occupy the middle range of the real estate brokerage ser-
vice spectrum. If you use a discount broker, you pick and choose the tasks
you want to do yourself to market your house. The more work you’re willing
to handle yourself, the less you typically pay the broker.
Your savings, although not as great as those offered by the FSBO option, may
be better than simply cutting the commission on your house’s sale price from
6 to 5.5 percent. Discount brokers utilize different pricing programs:
 Flat fee: With some discount brokers, you pay a flat fee for services ren-
dered. For example, services can include providing a For Sale sign to put
in your front yard, putting a write-up about your house in sales brochures
published by the firm and distributed in free newsstands located around
town, and training you in fundamentals (such as how to write a classi-
fied ad, how to hold an open house, and how to negotiate). For an extra
fee, discount brokers may put a house’s listing in the local MLS. (You’re
obligated to pay an additional commission if an MLS cooperating broker
procures the buyer.)
 Percentage commission: Instead of charging 5 or 6 percent, which tradi-
tional real estate firms charge, some discount brokers charge 3 or 4 
percent.
 Hourly: If you prefer, some discount brokers also provide assistance on
an hourly fee basis. For example, you want a firm to handle all your
Sunday open houses, negotiate contract terms whenever you receive
written offers, and help you fill out sale-related paperwork. The draw-
back to this approach is that if you don’t end up selling, you’re out all
the fees you’ve already paid.
Some full-service/full-commission brokers aren’t keen about working on dis-
count broker listings. For one thing, their listings often offer lower fees for
cooperating brokers. Even if the fee is equal to the prevailing local rate, 
141
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

however, full-service agents know that they’ll probably have to do extra 
work because you don’t have a full-service broker handling your end of the
deal. For these reasons, discount broker listings get less than enthusiastic
showings by most full-service brokers.
Using discount brokers makes the most sense if your local real estate market
is strong, pricing your house is relatively simple, and you’re willing to handle
some of the work. However, if your property will be difficult to sell (because
of the amount of corrective work it needs or its unusual floor plan, for exam-
ple), you may have to use a full-service broker to make a sale.
Flat fees and hourly charges vary from one discount broker to the next. If you
decide to use a discount broker, do some comparison shopping. Look for a
discount broker who’ll give you a bundle of services that best meets your
needs for the lowest flat fee or hourly charge. Larger discount real estate 
brokerage firms include

Preparing Seller Disclosure Statements
The days of caveat emptor — let the buyer beware — are gone forever. In fact,
given the flood of federal, state, and local consumer protection laws enacted
during the last couple of decades, this is the era of caveat vendor — let the
seller beware. Prudent house sellers and agents must now follow two simple
guidelines:
 Beware of belligerent buyers.
 All buyers become belligerent if not given full disclosure.
As a seller, you may think that some of the disclosure requirements are overly
protective of buyers. Because, however, you probably intend to purchase a
new home to replace the one you’re selling, you can benefit from disclosures
as a buyer. All things considered, it’s a fair trade.
What information should you disclose?
Disclosure statements aren’t identical throughout the United States. Like other
real estate contracts and forms, disclosure statements vary enormously in
scope and intricacy because the disclosures themselves differ widely from
state to state and from one area to another within any given state.
142
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

The documents you give prospective buyers probably won’t look like the
California Association of Realtors’ Real Estate Transfer Disclosure Statement,
shown in Figure 8-2. The C.A.R. form, however, gives you an idea of the kind
of disclosures you may have to make.

Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

Generally speaking, the law requires that you disclose to prospective buyers
any information you have that materially affects your property’s value or
desirability. A material fact is anything that reasonably affects either a buyer’s
decision to purchase your house or the price he’d pay. This disclosure must
cover facts that you, as an owner, are expected to know about your property
and the neighborhood that couldn’t be known by (or wouldn’t be apparent to)
the buyer. For example:
 Physical condition: Are your built-in appliances in good working order?
Do you know about any hidden defects or malfunctions in your house’s
major components (roof, foundation, electrical system, plumbing, sewer,
insulation, windows, doors, walls, and so on)?
Although you certainly ought to know whether your air conditioner
works properly, no one expects you to be a professional property
inspector. Disclosure laws are just one more reason why, as we note in
Chapter 7, getting a premarketing inspection of your house is wise. You
(and your agent, if you’re using one) should also encourage buyers to
conduct their own investigations and obtain inspections from their own
experts instead of relying solely on your inspections or the information
you provide about the property’s physical condition.
 Health, safety, and environmental hazards: You must comply with 
federal, state, and local disclosure laws regarding property problems
related to asbestos, formaldehyde, lead-based paints, underground fuel
or chemical storage tanks, radon gas, contaminated soil or water, and
other health hazards. Is your property in harm’s way from earthquakes,
floods, hurricanes, or other natural disasters? Does your property
comply with local energy or water conservation ordinances?
Don’t worry about running all over town to stock up on the various
booklets, pamphlets, and forms the law requires you to give to prospec-
tive buyers. Your listing agent or real estate lawyer (if you’re selling
without an agent) should provide all necessary disclosure information
prior to marketing your property.
 Legal condition: Are any lawsuits pending that affect your property? Did
you make any modifications or alterations to your property without get-
ting the necessary building permits? Do these modifications or alterations
comply with state and local building codes? If you’re selling a condo-
minium, you must give the buyer copies of the Covenants, Conditions,
and Restrictions (CC&Rs), the Homeowners Association bylaws, and 
the budget.
146
Part II: Tactical Considerations 

If you have any legal problems related to the property, clear them up
before marketing your property if possible. Nobody wants to buy a 
lawsuit. Legal problems are deal killers. Buyers generally don’t want to
inherit legal problems, which tend to take a long time to resolve and are
expensive, to boot.
 Subjective areas: Until now, you could provide objective answers to the
various disclosure questions. Your roof either leaks or it doesn’t. You
either have lead-based paint in your house or you don’t. Either you’re
being sued or you aren’t. Now things get fuzzy. Is your neighborhood
quiet? Can you find parking spaces easily near your house? Is car traffic
excessive in the neighborhood? Would you call the morning commute
horrendous? Are schools in the area overcrowded?
Subjective questions can’t be answered with a simple yes or no. The
environment that you think is extremely quiet, the buyer may consider 
a boiler factory. Parking a block from your house may be close in your
opinion, but a long walk to your buyer. How much traffic is excessive?
And so it goes. Answer all subjective questions to the best of your abil-
ity, and then encourage buyers to familiarize themselves with the area
so they can draw their own subjective conclusions about these issues.
Some state courts have ruled that certain unpleasant facts materially
affect the desirability and value of property and insist that sellers dis-
close these facts. One such fact is a death on the property within several
years of the sale — especially if the death was gruesome or violent. For
example, the difference between an elderly man dying peacefully in his
sleep and a homicide is obvious. Other examples of unpleasant material
facts are high crime rates in the immediate area or the presence of
known child molesters or rapists who’ve been released from prison 
and now live in the neighborhood.
If you’re not sure whether you have to make this type of disclosure about
your property, consult your listing agent or a real estate lawyer.
An ounce of prevention is 
worth a pound of cure
Sometimes, lawsuits are unavoidable. Certain litigious lads and lasses will
take you to court at the drop of a summons whether they have a case or not.
Other than identifying them in advance as troublemakers and refusing to
147
Chapter 8: Listing Contracts and Commissions

accept an offer from them, you can’t protect yourself from people who
believe that a lawsuit is their only solution for real or imagined problems. 
If you have the misfortune of selling your house to one of these misguided
souls, your best recourse is to get a good lawyer to defend you.
The best defense is a good offense. Here are four suggestions you can enact
to reduce the possibility of a legitimate lawsuit:
 If in doubt, disclose. If you have to ask whether to disclose something
about your property or the neighborhood, you’ve answered your own
question. Overdisclosure is better than running the risk of being sued
for damages or having the sale rescinded because you failed to reveal 
a fact that materially affects your property’s desirability or value.
Remember the golden rule. “Do unto others as you would have them 
do unto you” may sound hokey, but it’s mighty fine real estate advice.
 Don’t guess. Not sure about the square footage of your house, the roof’s
age, the life expectancy of your water heater, or any other material fact?
It’s better by far to answer “unknown” than to guess. If prospective
buyers are concerned about any of your “unknowns,” they can hire 
their own experts to render opinions.
 Put your disclosure in writing. Have the buyers affirm receipt of your
disclosure statement by signing and dating it. Be sure to keep a copy 
for your file.
 Hire a professional to inspect your house prior to putting it on the
market. After seeing the results, you have the option of fixing defects
you want to repair and disclosing the others.
148
Part II: Tactical Considerations 
Disclose work done without permits
This cautionary note is for do-it-yourselfers
who’ve done carpentry, plumbing, and electri-
cal work around the house without bothering to
get a permit for the work or having it inspected
by their friendly local building department. We,
your friendly authors, are keenly aware that
building permits can be expensive, are some-
times difficult to get, and may trigger property
tax increases. We also know that, for these rea-
sons, many folks do work without a permit.
That’s all fine and good. But when you sell, ’fess
up in writing about work performed without a
building permit.
Your written disclosure, for example, that you
built that magnificent deck without a permit
(and that the deck may not meet local building
codes) serves to protect you if the buyer sues
you about it after the deal closes.
Remember: The key to avoiding lawsuits is com-
plete, timely, written disclosure of all problems
so your buyer can make an informed purchas-
ing decision.

Don’t fight the problem. Like it or not, disclosure statements are a fact of real
estate life. They’re here to stay. Handled properly, mandatory disclosures
speed up the sale of your house and ensure that, when your house sells, it
stays sold.

Chapter 9
Preparing Your House for Sale
In This Chapter
 Getting your home ready to make a great first impression
 Steering clear of major home renovations
A
magical metamorphosis occurs the moment you decide to sell your
property. The “home” you love so dearly turns into a “house.” This shift
in vocabulary is an important part of letting go — the emotional detachment
process all sellers experience sooner or later. Home is where your heart is.
Houses, like TV sets, toasters, and tangerines, are commodities sold on the
open market. You’re getting ready to sell a house.
Most folks don’t really see their houses after they’ve lived in them for a while.
Things that buyers may find objectionable, owners accept as charming quirks.
The bathroom door, for example, that sticks whenever it rains. That weird
noise the refrigerator makes every so often in the middle of the night. The
dirty spot on the hall carpet near the front door where the family dog always
takes his afternoon nap. Little stuff.
Nor do homeowners tend to notice the insidious effects of gradual physical
deterioration and equally gradual junk accumulation. Homeowners fail to see
how badly the house needs a new paint job, how big that “little” stain from
the leaky roof has grown, and how many clothes they’ve jammed into the
once-spacious closets over the years. Not so little stuff.
A “lived-in” look is fine — until you want to sell. You may not see this decline,
but buyers who tour your property definitely will. To be a successful seller,
you must have your house looking its best. This chapter highlights what you
can do to your house, outside and inside, to make it stand out above the other
houses on the market and what common mistakes to avoid so you can get the
best offer.

Handling Presale Preparation
Getting your house ready to put on the market takes time. Exposing your
property to the market before it looks its best gives buyers and agents who
tour the house a bad initial impression. It’s nearly impossible to get them
back for a second look after you correct the showing flaws. After you read
this section, you’ll know why you probably need at least two weeks to pre-
pare your property for marketing.
If you make the right improvements when fixing up your property, you increase
the odds of selling it quickly for top dollar. If, conversely, you make the wrong
changes to your property, you waste the time and money you spent, prolong
the sale, and possibly even reduce the ultimate sale price.
Start the presale fix-up process by getting outside opinions of your house’s
strengths and weaknesses. Don’t ask your best friends or the next-door
neighbors. They may have the same blind spots you do. Worse yet, they may
sugarcoat the truth in a misguided attempt to spare your feelings.
Good real estate agents are an excellent source of advice about readying your
house for sale. Because agents see your house with fresh eyes, they can spot
flaws you no longer notice. Furthermore, agents look at your house the way
buyers do. They know how to prepare houses so they’re appealing for 
marketing — a process sometimes referred to as staging. And, last but not
least, because agents work on commission, good agents don’t want to waste
your time or theirs trying to sell a house that isn’t up to snuff. The more you
get for your house, the bigger their commission. This section focuses on how
to prepare your house for sale, starting from the curb and working your way
inside.
Creating curb appeal
Most buyers make snap judgments about your house. Their first impressions,
good or bad, generally are lasting impressions. Buyers begin forming their
opinion of your house long before they go inside. Curb appeal, the external
attractiveness of your property when viewed from the street, is critically
important. If you want to see how your house looks to strangers, go across
the street and take a good, hard look at it.
No matter how magnificent your house is on the inside, many buyers will
drive by your house without stopping if the property lacks curb appeal. Your
house’s exterior appearance and landscaping either attract buyers or repulse
them. You can enhance your house’s curb appeal through some tried-and-
true ways:
154
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

 Painting: Painting your house’s exterior before you put it on the market
can be expensive (unless you do it yourself), but it gives the biggest
bang for your fix-up buck — if you use colors that conform with your
neighborhood’s decorating norm. Now isn’t the time to make a fashion
statement! White, light grays, or soft tans are safe choices for exterior
walls. If your house doesn’t need a new paint job, at least touch up
window frames, front shutters, gutters, and down spouts and have your
house gently power washed by people who know what they’re doing.
Also, be sure to give your mailbox and front door a fresh coat of paint.
Greet prospective buyers by dressing up your freshly-painted entrance
with a new welcome mat.
In addition to spending big bucks on a paint job, house painting is a time-
consuming project. Because exterior painting is seasonal work, profes-
sional painters are busy folks after the snow melts and during the dry
season. Don’t wait until a week before you want to put your house on
the market to call several painters for bids to do the job. Schedule your
painting contractor well in advance of the crunch or you may end up
with two nasty choices: either painting the house yourself or putting it
on the market with peeling, faded paint.
 Lawn: A freshly mowed, neatly trimmed lawn gives your house a well-
maintained appearance. Don’t leave toys, lawn equipment, or garden
hoses scattered around the yard. You can make your grass look extra
lush and green by fertilizing it in the appropriate season. However, if
your pet, or your neighbor’s pet, tries to help out with the fertilizing, 
use your pooper-scooper daily to clean up.
 Sidewalks: Sweep your sidewalks daily. Keep your walks free of snow
and ice in the winter. Nothing puts buyers in a foul mood faster than
falling flat on their faces while trying to navigate your icy sidewalk.
A badly cracked, crumbling sidewalk is a lawsuit waiting to happen if
someone trips and injures himself due to the sidewalk’s poor state of
repair. In addition, a poorly maintained sidewalk creates a terrible first
impression of your property. Compounding the problem, buyers know
that if you don’t fix the sidewalk, they’ll have to do it. Patching cracks 
or replacing damaged portions of a sidewalk prior to putting your house
on the market is money well spent. Keep cost to a minimum by getting
bids to do the corrective work from several reputable contractors.
 Shrubbery: Remove or replace any dead or dying trees, hedges, or
shrubs, and prune anything that looks scraggly or overgrown. Cut back
overgrown shrubs that block windows and keep light from entering your
house.
155
Chapter 9: Preparing Your House for Sale

 Flowers: Filling flowerbeds with seasonal flowers is an inexpensive way
to add color and charm to property. Choose bright, fresh colors that
draw buyers’ eyes to otherwise ignored areas of your yard. Don’t forget
to keep flowerbeds watered and weeded throughout the marketing
process until your sale closes. If you’re among the flower-growing
impaired, allow us to recommend Perennials For Dummies by Marcia
Tatroe and the National Gardening Association (Wiley).
 Repairs: Be sure that all gutters and downspouts are in place and clean.
Replace missing roof shingles and broken or cracked windows. Repair
cracks in your driveway and remove large oil stains. Replace or repair
broken stairs, torn window screens, broken or missing fence slats, and
defective doorknobs. Make sure that your front and back doors, garage
doors, and all windows open easily. Check exterior lights to be certain
that they’re working properly.
 Windows: Keep your windows spotless inside and out throughout the
marketing period. When you’re not home, curious buyers attracted by
the For Sale sign will peek through the windows to size up your house.
Don’t let their first impression be windows covered with cobwebs and
smeared with fingerprints. Don’t forget that interior window treatments
can be seen from the outside. Worn or faded drapes or lopsided window
shades need to be replaced or removed.
 Eliminate or hide clutter: Clear everything you don’t need out of the
garage. Friends and family who live nearby can be a great source of tem-
porary places to stash your excess stuff. If you can’t clean your garage
out, at least keep the door closed to conceal the mess from prying eyes.
Store recycling bins in an out-of-the-way spot in back of your house.
Don’t have a fleet of cars, trucks, boats, and campers cluttering up your
driveway or parked in front of your house. You’re selling a house, not a
parking lot.
If just reading this list makes you tired, you’re not alone. You probably lack
the time and the desire to do all this prep work yourself. If you can afford it,
make your life easier by hiring competent folks to help you with these chores.
Your real estate agent, if you’re working with one, should be brought into the
spiffing process as soon as possible. The agent should help prioritize the var-
ious projects and can probably refer you to people who specialize in this kind
of work.
Exteriors attract, but interiors sell
Curb appeal draws buyers into your house. Appealing interiors make the sale.
But you don’t have to spend tens of thousands of dollars on your house prior
to putting up the For Sale sign. On the contrary, the little things you do gener-
ally give the biggest increase in value. Concentrate on the three Cs.
156
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

Clean up
Clean, scrub, and polish your house. Your stove, oven, refrigerator, microwave
oven, and other appliances must be spotlessly clean inside and out. Scour
walls, floors, bathtubs, showers, sinks, and faucets until they sparkle. Clean
or repair tub and shower grout. Don’t forget to clean the ventilating hood in
your kitchen as well as the dusty heating and air conditioning vents through-
out your house.
Buyers will notice strong smells as soon as they walk through your front door,
so eliminate smoke, mildew, and pet odors. Cleaning drapes and carpets
helps get rid of odors. So does cleaning your cat’s litter box daily. Remove
ashes from the fireplace. If you’re a smoker, clean all ashtrays daily and take
your smoking breaks in the great outdoors until you sell your house. Use air
fresheners or citrus-scented potpourri to keep your house odor free. Open
windows at least ten minutes every day to let in fresh air (unless you live
near something emitting an undesirable odor). Whether you do the work or
hire someone, make sure that your house is spotless and smell-less.
Fix drippy faucets. If any of your sinks or bathtubs drain slowly, unclog them.
Just as car buyers love to kick tires, some property buyers test houses by
flushing toilets and running water in sinks and bathtubs to check drains.
Buyers consider leaky faucets and clogged drains a sign of poor maintenance
and, more often than not, they’re right!
Clear out
Get rid of clutter. Be ruthless. Removing clutter increases the perceived size
of your house. Eliminating clutter and excess furniture makes rooms appear
larger. Try this simple test: take shoes, sweater boxes, and so on off your
closet floor and look again. Small rooms such as closets and bathrooms seem
larger without a ton of stuff all over the floor.
Where furniture is concerned, less is more. Go through your house room by
room with your real estate agent or a friend who isn’t a packrat. Get their
opinion on what to eliminate. Set a goal of getting rid of at least a quarter of
the furniture in each room — half would probably be better. Big furniture
such as large sofas or grand pianos make a room look smaller. A glass table,
for example, seems smaller than a solid wood table of the same size. Think
visually. If you want a better idea of what your room looks like, take pictures
of each room.
Remember the rule of three: No more than three items should be on your
kitchen and bathroom counters, tabletops, and mantels. Keep dirty dishes
out of the kitchen sink. Store, sell, or give away surplus or bulky furniture.
Recycle those stacks of old magazines and newspapers you’ve been saving
for no good reason. Don’t just move stuff into the attic or garage. On the 
contrary, dump all that junk from your attic, basement, and garage that
you’ve accumulated over the years.
157
Chapter 9: Preparing Your House for Sale

Closet space sells houses. Create additional space in your closet by weeding
out all those old clothes you never wear anymore. Clean and organize clos-
ets, bookcases, and drawers. Like it or not, serious buyers inspect your 
closets and open built-in drawers. Be sure that they’re neat and roomy. Closets
look more organized if you replace wire hangers with matching wood or 
plastic hangers.
Ironically, the clutter that reduces your house’s value is far from worthless.
On the contrary, your junk is someone else’s treasure. Make a donation to
your favorite charity and earn a tax deduction (be sure to ask for a donation
receipt). Have a garage sale. Who knows? You may make enough from a
garage sale to pay for your move.
Cosmetic improvements
Make cosmetic improvements. Painting isn’t expensive if you do it yourself,
but be careful when selecting interior colors. Lighter colors make rooms look
larger. Avoid cherry red, canary yellow, cobalt blue, emerald green, and other
bold colors with strong visual impact. You may love the effect, but you aren’t
the buyer. Stick to conventional whites, soft pastels, warm tans, honey, taupe,
and other neutral colors that won’t clash with most prospective buyers’ tastes.
If, like most basements, yours is dark and gloomy, paint the walls and ceiling
a light color and put the highest wattage light bulbs that you can safely use in
your light fixtures to brighten up the space. Repair cracks in the floor.
Just because we recommend using neutral colors doesn’t mean that you
should turn your house into a bland, boring blob of mush. You have our per-
mission to give it visual spice. Use fabric — area rugs, tablecloths, napkins,
sofa cushions, window curtains or drapes, bedspreads and quilts, bath and
hand towels, shower curtains, and so on — to create temporary color accents
in rooms. Unlike other more permanent improvements, you can take these
items with you for use in your next home. You can also use flower arrange-
ments to add bright splashes of color to rooms.
Staging
Staging a house goes way beyond your efforts to make it look nifty before
having friends over for a dinner party. After all, your pals are there to eat
your food and drink your wine — not buy your house. Just as stagehands set
the stage for Broadway productions, you can stage your house to create a
production designed to wow prospective purchasers. Good stagers know
how to emphasize the best features of a house and minimize the worst.
158
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

Staging became even more important with the advent of Internet marketing,
which we cover in Chapter 13. Today it’s no longer a simple matter of how
your house looks to people who walk through it. Many buyers shop online
prior to actually seeing a house, so be sure your house looks good online too.
If you’ve ever visited a new home development and walked through the
builder’s model home, you’ve seen staging. Builders usually do extremely
elaborate staging jobs. They use professional decorators who take care of
everything: placing furniture, choosing soothing colors for carpets and drapes,
hanging artwork, having a bowl of fruit on the kitchen counter, putting flower
arrangements in the living room, and leaving an open book on a table by the
bed in the master bedroom.
All cabinets, closets, and drawers are empty, of course, so buyers can easily
see that the house appears to have plenty of room for their stuff. That unnat-
urally clean, utterly bare garage looks huge. The patio is furnished with nice
lawn furniture and one of those tables with an umbrella in the center. Staging
the property this way helps prospective buyers visualize themselves living 
in the home.
The message a bright, cheerful, immaculately clean model home in perfect
working condition sends to buyers is, “What are you waiting for? Go ahead.
Buy me. You won’t regret it. Living here will be easy. You can relax and enjoy
life.”
Staging finishes the process you started with the three Cs (see the preceding
section). You don’t have to spend wads of cash to stage your property. Small
bucks spent staging can bring big rewards. If you’re looking to increase your
house’s emotional appeal, check out the following areas of improvement:
 Kitchen: Aromas from fragrant goodies like freshly baked gingerbread or
just-brewed coffee bring back wonderful memories of home. Conversely,
many people find odors from pungent foods such as liver, fish, and cab-
bage a turnoff. Be careful about the foods you cook throughout the 
marketing process; you never know when prospective buyers may tour
your house.
 Bathrooms: Always have fresh towels and potpourri in bathrooms. Buy
new shower curtains; old ones may have water spots or mildew on them.
Put new soap in the soap dishes. Take toothbrushes, toothpaste, combs,
prescription bottles, and rubber duckies off the bathroom counter. Clear
out the medicine cabinet, make sure the toilets are flushed and cleaned,
and remove the tub mat and rug in front of the toilet.
159
Chapter 9: Preparing Your House for Sale

 Collections: Everyone has collections — family photos on the wall, auto-
graphed baseballs, dolls, CDs and DVDs, sports and school trophies,
model airplanes, whatever. Unfortunately, now isn’t the time to have
prospective buyers thinking about your family living in the house. You
want them to focus on their family living in it. Depersonalize your prop-
erty. Put away your collections so people focus on the task at hand —
buying your house.
Most folks use magnets or tape to stick everything from vacation snap-
shots and finger-painting masterpieces to notes for the kids and “to do”
lists on the surface of their refrigerator. That’s a mighty distracting col-
lection. Clear everything off the top and sides of your refrigerator.
 Comfort: Keep your house warm in winter and cool in summer. A house
that’s too hot or too cold isn’t inviting. Remember Goldilocks.
 Fireplace: Functioning fireplaces are utilitarian (another heat source)
and romantic (candlelit dinners by the fire). If you have a fireplace, spot-
light it. Polish your fireplace tools. Pile logs neatly in the fireplace. When
your house is shown on cold fall or winter days, nothing says “Welcome”
like the warmth, glow, crackle, and smell of a blazing fire in the fireplace.
 Flowers: Vases of colorful, fresh flowers spotted throughout the house
make a wonderful impression on prospective buyers. You don’t have to
spend a fortune on hothouse orchids. Bouquets of daisies, tulips, or
other seasonal flowers from your local supermarket are fine.
 Furniture: Rearrange furniture to create a warm, inviting feeling. If you’re
selling a vacant house, consider renting furniture to create a homey
atmosphere.
 Light: Bright, well-lit houses seem more spacious and cheerful. Wash all
your windows. Clean the window screens. During the day, open all your
curtains and drapes (unless you overlook the city dump or your view is
a brick wall). If the view is unattractive, get sheer window coverings that
let light through but mask the view. Don’t force buyers and agents to
grope around in the dark looking for light switches. When you show your
house, brighten up rooms by turning on all your lamps, even during the
day. Be sure hallways and stairways are brightly lit. Don’t forget to turn
on closet lights, oven lights, and the lights over your stove and kitchen
counter.
Prospective buyers often drop in or drive by in the evening to see how
your house looks at night. Interior lights that can be seen from the street
make a house look cozy and inviting. From sunset until you go to bed,
keep at least one light on in each room that faces the street.
As you may know, some folks earn their living (either part-time or full-time) as
home stagers. If you’re working with a real estate agent to sell your house and
you’ve done a thorough job interviewing agents, as we explain in Chapter 7,
your agent can probably recommend several stagers. In the event your agent
is unable to suggest anyone, she should ask fellow agents in her office and
her office manager for advice.
160
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

Think Again: Avoiding Major
Improvements
You’re about ready to sell your home, and you realize (or perhaps already
know because you had the premarketing inspection we recommend in
Chapter 7) that your house needs a new roof, a new foundation, new copper
plumbing, kitchen remodeling, or bathroom upgrades. What’s the best way 
to handle major expenses like these?
At this stage in the marketing process, you shouldn’t bite off more than you
can chew. If you only have a few weeks before you want to put your house on
the market, you simply don’t have the time to manage a huge project.
Rehabs, larger and small, have two things in common:
 No surprise number one: All rehabs take longer than you though they
would.
 No surprise number two: All rehabs cost more than you thought they
would.
If you have to ask how much longer or how much more, you’ve never done a
rehab. If your house is in need of a major improvement, heed the two follow-
ing points:
 Don’t spend big bucks on major improvements. For example, don’t
install a new roof just before putting your house on the market. As we
note in Chapter 14, a wiser plan is to give buyers a credit in escrow to
cover the repair cost. Prepare for negotiations regarding the credit by
getting several competitive bids for the corrective work from reputable
local contractors, and then base your credit on the lowest realistic bid.
Why offer to give the buyer a credit in escrow? For one thing, you can
avoid a huge out-of-pocket expense by handling the repairs this way.
Furthermore, this arrangement allows the new owners to have the work
done by their own contractor whenever they want after the sale is com-
pleted. Last, but not least by a long shot, if the buyers have problems
with their new roof after the sale, the repair is their problem — not
yours. You aren’t liable for their contractor’s work.
 Don’t do a major rehab of the kitchen or bathroom. You generally can’t
increase your sale price enough to fully compensate you for all the work
and money you put into these projects. Furthermore, you can’t guess the
next owner’s preferences in toilets, tile, and tubs. Don’t even try. Odds
are that you’ll make the wrong decisions on appliances, cabinets, colors,
finishes, and other design choices. A much better plan is to reduce your
asking price so it reflects that your house has an old kitchen or bathroom
instead of squandering your time and money on a major remodeling job
that people may dislike.

Determining Your House’s Value

S
tep into our handy-dandy time machine, please. Be careful. Don’t bump
your head. These darn economy models have such low ceilings. We’re
about to transport you back to the day you began looking for your current
home — the house hunt that culminated in the purchase of the home you
now own. Ah. There you are, hesitantly wandering from one Sunday open
house to the next with the classified ads in your hand and a puzzled look 
on your face.
When you first started your search, you didn’t have a clue about how much
any of the houses you toured were worth. Do you remember how the asking
prices were merely meaningless sequences of numbers to you? If, for exam-
ple, you saw a house being offered at $274,950, you didn’t know whether it
was a steal at that price or grossly overpriced. Your experience is common.
Everyone goes through that phase during the initial stage of the home-buying
process.
Hold on while we make a short leap forward in time. What a difference a
couple of months make. Now look at you, confidently zipping in and out of
open houses. You figured out property values by personally eyeballing as
many houses as you could. Then you kept checking the status of the proper-
ties to see whether they’d sold and, if they had, at what price. You discovered
that sale prices, not asking prices, establish a house’s value. Your hard work
paid off. You became a market-savvy, educated buyer.

Okay, buckle up for your return to the present. How do you think that things
will change when you become a seller? Surprise. Where property values are
concerned, the rules of the game are identical for buyers and sellers. Being
an educated seller is just as important as being an educated buyer. You get
educated exactly the same way — by touring houses comparable to yours
that are currently for sale in your neighborhood.
Good news. You don’t have to spend every weekend between now and the
sale of your house touring property. If you choose to use the services of a
good real estate agent, he can accelerate your learning curve by screening
which houses you visit. After seeing no more than a dozen houses compara-
ble to yours in size, age, condition, and location, you’ll be an educated seller.
(You can spend the time you save gussying up your house for sale!) After
you’ve made these tours, you can start to set a value on your own house.
This chapter helps you determine that price.
Defining Cost, Price, and Value
Winston Churchill sagely observed that England and the United States were
countries separated by a common language. Citizens of the two countries use
the same words, but the words may have entirely different meanings in each
country. For example, folks in Merry Old England buy bangers with pounds.
“What an odd country,” Americans think, “they purchase hot dogs with
weights?”
You don’t have to go all the way to England for a verbal joust. A similar break-
down in communication occurs here in the good old USA whenever Americans
use cost, price, and value interchangeably. This linguistic imprecision creates
big problems during negotiations between homebuyers and house sellers.
The fact is: Neither cost nor price is the same as value. After you understand
the meanings of these words and how they differ, you can say exactly what
you mean and replace emotion with objectivity during price negotiations.
Outfacting buyers is always better than attempting to outargue them.
Value is elusive
Value is your opinion of your house’s worth to you based on the way you use
it now and plan to use it in the future. Note that, in the preceding sentence,
the words “your” and “you” each appear twice. Because your opinion is sub-
jective, the features you value may not be the universal standard for all of
humanity.
164
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

You may, for example, be of the strongly held opinion that the one and only
acceptable house color is beet red. We, your humble authors, may feel just 
as resolutely that only sky blue houses are gorgeous and all other colors are
major ugly. No harm done, as long as everyone realizes that a big difference
exists between opinions and facts.
Two factors greatly affect value:
 Internal factors: Your personal (internal) situation has a fascinating way
of changing over time. Suppose that 30 years ago, when you bought your
present house, you put great value on a four-bedroom home with a fenced-
in backyard. The house had to be located in a town with a terrific school
system. Why? Because 30 years ago, you were the proud parent of two
adorable little rug rats.
Now your children are grown and have their own homes. They left you
rattling around in your house like a tiny pea in a gigantic pod. Without
kids, you don’t need the big house, huge yard, or terrific school system.
The house didn’t change — what changed were the internal factors
regarding your use for the house and, thus, its value to you. Divorce 
and retirement are other internal factors that compel folks to buy or 
sell houses.
 External factors: Circumstances outside your control that affect prop-
erty values also change for better or worse. If, for example, commute
time to the big city where you work is cut from 1 hour to 30 minutes
when mass transit rail service is extended into your area, your house’s
value increases. If, on the other hand, a toxic waste dump is discovered
next to your house, the house’s value takes a hit.
The law of supply and demand is another external factor that affects
value. If more people want to buy houses than sell them, buyer competi-
tion drives up house prices. If, on the other hand, more people want to
sell than buy, reduced demand results in lower property prices.
Cost is history
Cost measures past expenditures — for example, the amount you originally
paid for your house. But that was then, and this is now. The amount you paid
long ago, or the amount you spent fixing up the house after you bought it,
doesn’t mean diddlypoo as far as your house’s present or future value is 
concerned.
For example, when home prices began skyrocketing in many areas of the
country during the late 1980s, some buyers accused sellers of being greedy.
“You paid $75,000 fifteen years ago. Now you’re asking $250,000,” they said.
“That’s a huge profit.”
165
Chapter 10: Determining Your House’s Value

“So what?” sellers replied compassionately. “If you don’t want to pay our
modest asking price, move out of the way so the nice buyers standing behind
you can present their offers.” In a hot sellers’ market, people who base their
offering prices on the original price paid for a property waste everyone’s time.
The market changed radically in a few short years. By the early 1990s, prices
had declined dramatically in many areas. Sellers would’ve been ecstatic to
find buyers willing to pay them the amount they’d paid five years earlier
when home prices peaked. In those areas, sellers who priced their houses
based on the inflated purchase prices they’d paid years earlier learned a
painful lesson: Your potential profit or loss as a seller doesn’t enter into the
equation when determining your house’s present value.
Price is the here and now
You put an asking price on your house. Buyers put an offering price in their
contract. You and the buyers negotiate back and forth to establish your
house’s purchase price. Today’s purchase price becomes tomorrow’s cost,
and so it goes.
Cost is the past, price is the present, and value (like beauty) is in the eyes of
the beholder. Neither the price you paid for your house eons ago when you
bought it, nor the amount you want to get for it today matters to buyers.
Don’t waste valuable time on fantasy pricing.
Determining Fair Market Value (FMV)
Every house sells at the right price. That price is defined as its fair market
value (FMV) — the price a buyer will pay and a seller will accept for the
house — given that neither buyer nor seller is under duress. Duress comes
from life changes, such as divorce or sudden job transfer, which put either
the buyers or sellers under pressure to perform quickly. If appraisers know
that a sale was made under duress, they raise or lower the sale price accord-
ingly to more accurately reflect the house’s true FMV.
FMV is a zillion times more powerful than plain old value. As a seller, you have
an opinion about the amount your house is worth. Buyers have a separate,
not necessarily equal, and probably lower, opinion of your house’s value.
Values are opinions, not facts.
FMV, conversely, is fact. It becomes fact the moment you and the buyer agree
on a mutually acceptable price. Just as it takes two to tango, it takes you and
a buyer to make FMV. Facts are bankable.
166
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

Need-based pricing isn’t FMV
Whenever the residential real estate market gets soft and squishy like a rotten
tomato, many would-be sellers feel that FMV isn’t fair at all. “Why doesn’t our
house sell?” they ask. “Why can’t we get our asking price? It’s not fair.”
Don’t confuse “fair” with equitable or favorable. Despite its amiable name,
FMV is brutally impartial and sometimes even cruel. Need is not an integral
component of FMV. FMV doesn’t give a hoot about any of the following:
 How much money you need because you overpaid for your house when
you bought it
 How much money you need to replace the money you spent fixing up your
house after you bought it
 How much money you need to pay off your mortgage or home-equity loan
 How much money you need from the sale to buy your next home
Here’s why need doesn’t determine FMV. Suppose that two identical houses
located right next door to one another are listed for sale at the same time.
One house was purchased by Marcia for $30,000 in 1970. You made a $60,000
cash down payment when you bought the other house for $300,000 two years
ago. As luck would have it, property values declined a year after you bought
your house.
You clearly need more money from the sale than Marcia. After all, you paid
ten times as much for your house. What’s more, Marcia paid off her loan five
years ago. You, on the other hand, owe the bank big bucks on your mortgage.
Because the houses are identical in size, age, condition, and location, they
have the same FMV. Under the circumstances, the fact that they both sold for
$285,000 isn’t surprising. Marcia got a nice nest egg for her retirement. You
barely cleared enough from the deal to pay off your mortgage and other
expenses of sale. Fair? Marcia thinks so. You don’t.
FMV is utterly unbiased. It’s the amount your house is worth in the market
today — not the amount you or the buyers would like it to be.
Median prices aren’t FMV
Organizations such as the National Association of Realtors, the Chamber of
Commerce, and private research firms gather data on house sales activity in
a specific geographic region, such as a city, county, or state. They use this
167
Chapter 10: Determining Your House’s Value

information to prepare reports on housing topics, such as the average cost 
of houses in an area and the increase or decline in regional house sales on a
yearly or monthly basis.
One of the most widely quoted housing statistics is the median sale price, which
is simply the midpoint in a range of all house sales in an area during a speci-
fied reporting period, such as a month or a year. Half the sales during the
reporting period are above the median, and half fall below it.
The median-priced house, in other words, is the one exactly in the middle of
the prices of all the houses that sold during the specified reporting period.
Figure 10-1 demonstrates what we mean.

Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

For example, the median sale price of an existing single-family house in the
United States was about $220,000 in 2007 — meaning that half the houses in
the U.S. sold for more than $220,000 and the other half sold for less than
$220,000. (In case you’re interested, the median sale price was just $118,000
in 1996 when the first edition of this wonderful book went to press.)
Unfortunately, all you know about this hypothetical median-priced 
American house is its price.
You don’t know how many bedrooms or baths the mythical median-priced
house contains. Nor do you know how many square feet of interior living
space the house offers, how old it is, whether it has a garage or a yard, or
how well maintained it is. You don’t even know where in the U.S. this elusive
median-priced house is located.
As a homeowner, you can use median sale price statistics to measure general
property value trends. For example, suppose that your local Chamber of
Commerce says that the median sale price of a house in your area was
$200,000 five years ago when you bought your house, and it’s $240,000 today.
Based on that information, you can safely say that median sale prices have
increased 20 percent over the past five years.
Just because the median sale price of a house in your area went up 20 percent
doesn’t mean that the house you paid  $250,000 for five years ago is worth
$300,000 today. Median sale price statistics aren’t any more accurate for
determining your house’s value than median income statistics are for calcu-
lating your paycheck. You need much more precise information to establish
the FMV of the house you’re about to sell.
Using a Comparable Market Analysis
The best way to accurately determine your house’s FMV is by using a written
comparable market analysis (CMA) to see how your house compares to other
houses like yours that have either sold recently or currently are on the market.
If you hire a real estate agent to sell your house and use the techniques we
cover in Chapter 7 to select your agent, you get several CMAs during the
selection process. You can use these CMAs to fine-tune your asking price.
The “Recent Sales” section of the CMA helps establish the FMV of your house
by comparing it to all other houses that
 Are located in the same neighborhood as your house
 Are of approximately the same age, size, and condition as your house
 Have sold in the past six months
169
Chapter 10: Determining Your House’s Value

170
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 
Houses meeting these criteria are called comps, which is short for compara-
bles. Depending on the date you started looking at houses for sale in your
neighborhood, you may not have visited all the sold comps. No problem. A
good real estate agent can show you listing statements for the houses you
haven’t seen, take you on a verbal tour of every house, and explain how each
one compares with your house.
Every residential real estate office develops its own CMA format. Regardless
of the way your agent’s office presents its CMA information, Tables 10-1 and
10-2 illustrate the elements that all good CMAs contain. Suppose that you live
at 220 Oak Street. These tables provide CMA information for your house
(abbreviated as YH).

When you analyze the sales in Table 10-1, you find that houses comparable to
your house are selling in the range of  $149 to  $162 per square foot. Putting
the sale prices into a price-per-square-foot format makes property compar-
isons much easier. As Table 10-2 shows, any price that’s way above or below
the norm really leaps out at you.
The “Currently For Sale” section of the CMA compares your house to neigh-
borhood comps that are currently on the market. These comps are included in
the analysis to check price trends. If prices are falling, asking prices of
houses on the market today will be lower than sale prices of comparable
houses. If prices are rising, you’ll see higher asking prices today than sale
prices for comps that sold three to six months ago.

Playing with the numbers
Suppose today’s date is May 15th. You and your agent are sitting at the kitchen
table looking at two sheets of paper. One page shows all the recent sales of
comps in your neighborhood. The other lists houses comparable to yours
that currently are on the market in your area. Each set of comps tells you
something important.
“Sold” comps indicate probable FMV
Your agent says that 210 Oak is an ideal “sold” comp because it’s two doors
away from your house, is roughly the same size as your house, and is in
about the same condition as your house. Furthermore, no major changes
have occurred in your local real estate market since 210 Oak sold two weeks
ago for $155 per square foot. The only other recent sale at a higher price per
square foot was 555 Ash, but that comp isn’t as good because the house is in
better condition than your house (no offense).

Factually establishing your house’s probable sale price based on its square
footage is easy after you know how. Multiply your house’s square footage by
estimated FMV expressed in a price per square foot. In this case, because
your house (220 Oak) has 1,880 square feet multiplied by $155 per square
foot, it should sell for about $291,400. Simple.
“Currently For Sale” comps define asking price
You’ve toured every one of the comparable properties listed in the “Currently
For Sale” section of your agent’s CMA. Having seen 104 Ash with your own
eyes, you agree that it’s more like your house than any other property now
on the market in your area. Even so, it isn’t a perfect comp because 104 Ash
is smaller than your house and has only two and a half baths versus three full
baths in your house. You know enough about property values to realize that
the house is priced to sell at $158 per square foot.
Even though 123 Oak and 360 Oak are closer to your house than 104 Ash, nei-
ther house is as good a comp as the Ash Street property. The house at 123
Oak is totally renovated, has a wonderful kitchen, and should sell for a higher
price per square foot than your house. Whether they can get $161 per square
foot remains to be seen. The house at 360 Oak, on the other hand, is smaller
than your house, doesn’t show well, and has one less bath and a smaller
garage. No way will 360 Oak sell for $162 per square foot.
All things considered, you decide to base your asking price on $158 per
square foot. For one thing, that amount is the upper limit of comparable
houses’ asking prices. The extra $3 per square foot over your house’s proba-
ble FMV gives you a little room to negotiate with buyers. Multiplying 1,880
square feet times $158 per square foot equals $297,040, which is an odd
asking price. To make the asking price more exciting for prospective buyers,
you round it down to an even $295,000.
This example is rather straightforward. Pricing in the real world, however, is
usually somewhat complicated. That’s why we devote Chapter 11 to more
sophisticated pricing considerations.
Give sale prices more weight than asking prices when determining your
house’s asking price. Don’t guess about your house’s worth. Analyze the 
sale prices of comparable houses. Your CMA should note any price reduc-
tions made while the comps were on the market as well as the credits sellers
gave buyers for corrective work repairs.
Interpreting CMA adjustments and flaws
CMAs beat the heck out of median price statistics for establishing FMV, but
keep in mind that CMAs aren’t perfect. We’ve seen buyers and sellers use
exactly the same comps and arrive at stunningly different opinions of FMV.
Here’s where discrepancies can creep into your CMA:
174
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

 Incomplete comps: Your CMA must be comprehensive. It should include
all comp sales in the past six months and all comps currently on the
market. Be sure that the comp sales data reflects price reductions
during the marketing period and credits given for corrective work
repairs. Getting an accurate picture of FMV may be difficult if parts of
the puzzle are missing.
 Old comps: Like milk in your refrigerator, comps have expiration dates.
Lenders rarely accept as comps houses that sold more than six months
ago, because their sale prices don’t reflect current consumer confi-
dence, business conditions, or mortgage rates. As a rule, the older the
comp, the less likely that it represents today’s FMV.
Why six months? Because six months generally is accepted as long enough
to represent a good cross section of comparable sales, but short enough
to have fairly consistent market conditions. This time period, however,
isn’t carved in stone. If, for example, the biggest employer in your area
had a massive layoff three months ago, six months is too long for a valid
comparison. Conversely, if houses in your area rarely sell, you’ll probably
have to use comparable sales that occurred more than six months ago.
 House condition: No two homes are the same after they’ve been lived
in. Suppose that two identical tract homes are located next door to one
another. One, owned by an older couple with no children or pets, is in
pristine condition. The other, owned by a family with five small kids and
three large dogs, resembles a federal disaster area. It’s Guesstimate City
when trying to determine the cost to repair the wear-and-tear damage in
the second house. A good CMA, however, makes adjustments for this
type of difference between houses.
 Site differences within your neighborhood: Even though all the comps
are in the same neighborhood, they aren’t located on precisely the same
plot of ground. How much is being located next to the beautiful park
worth to a buyer? How much will a buyer pay to be seven blocks closer
to the bus stop during the rainy season? These value adjustments are
subjective and, thus, imprecise.
 Out-of-neighborhood comps: Suppose that, in the past six months, no
houses sold in your neighborhood. Going into other areas to find comps
forces you and your agent to make value adjustments between two dif-
ferent neighborhoods’ amenities (schools, shopping, transportation, and
so on). Comparing different neighborhoods is a lot more difficult than
making value adjustments within your neighborhood.
 Noncomp house sales: What if five houses sold in your neighborhood in
the past six months but not one was remotely comparable to yours in
age, size, style, or condition? You and your agent must estimate value
differences for three-bedroom versus four-bedroom houses, old versus
new kitchens, small versus large yards, garages versus carports, and so
on. If your house offers a panoramic view and none of the other houses
have any view at all, how much does the view increase your house’s
value? Guesstimates like these are highly subjective.
175
Chapter 10: Determining Your House’s Value

A valid comparison of your house to the other houses is impossible if you
and your agent have only read about the comps in listing statements. Seeing
is believing. Most listing statements (those one-page property descriptions
we cover in Chapter 12) are exaggerated to greater or lesser degrees. You
don’t know how overstated if you haven’t seen the house for yourself. You may
discover that a “large” master bedroom is tiny. A “gourmet” kitchen’s only
distinction may be an especially fancy hot plate. That “sweeping” view from
the living room may be visible only if you’re as tall as Michael Jordan. Of
course, you won’t know any of these things if you only read the houses’ puff
sheets instead of visiting each house in person.
Floor plans also greatly affect a house’s value. Two houses, for example, may
be approximately the same size, age, and condition, yet vary wildly in value.
One house’s floor plan flows beautifully from room to room; the rooms them-
selves are well proportioned with high ceilings. The other house doesn’t
work well because its floor plan is choppy and the ceilings are low. You can’t
tell which is which just by reading the two listing statements.
Eyeballing — touring houses and noting important details inside and out —
is the best way to decide which houses are true comps for your house and
which differences you must adjust for in your comparable analysis. (When
you read Chapter 13, you’ll see for yourself why online CMA providers such
as Zillow may be wildly inaccurate.)
Considering appraisals versus CMAs
If you’re the suspicious type, you may want to double-check your agent’s
opinion of value before putting your house on the market. You can do so by
paying several hundred dollars for a professional appraisal of your house.
Getting an unbiased second opinion of value is always reassuring. Appraisers,
unlike agents, have no reason to tell you what you want to hear to get a list-
ing. Whether your house sells or not, an appraiser gets paid. On the other
hand, if you think that a professional appraisal is vastly superior to your
agent’s opinion of value, think again. A good agent’s CMA usually is as good
as an appraisal for purposes of marketing your house. Conversely, if a profes-
sional appraisal is vastly superior because your agent is a lousy judge of
property values, get a better agent.
In any given area, appraisers don’t usually see as many houses as do agents
who focus on that area. Appraisers aren’t lazy; they use their time in other
ways. Formal appraisals are time consuming. An appraiser inspects a property
from foundation to attic, measures its square footage, makes detailed notes
regarding everything from the quality of construction to the amount of wear and
tear, photographs the house inside and out, photographs comps for the house
being appraised, writes up the appraisal, and so on. Agents can tour 15 to 20
houses in the same amount of time an appraiser requires to do one appraisal.
176
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

As a result, appraisers frequently call agents to find out about houses the
agents listed or sold that may be comps. Regardless of how good an agent’s
description of the house, eyeballing property is better. Any appraisal’s accu-
racy suffers if the appraisal is based on comps the appraiser hasn’t seen.
Agents also call each other about houses they haven’t seen, so don’t jump to
the conclusion that appraisers are the only ones who do such things. Reading
listing statements and picking other agents’ brains to find out about property
is no substitute for first-hand eyeballing. If your agent hasn’t seen most of the
comps used in your CMA, get an agent who knows your local market.
Unless you’re pretty darn uncertain about your house’s worth or are consid-
ering selling your house yourself (a topic we cover in Chapter 6), don’t waste
money on an appraisal.
Bidding Wars
In a perfect world, buyers and sellers would only use facts to establish prop-
erty values, and sales would be fast and easy. Unfortunately, the world is far
from perfect. The following sections provide two reasons.
How buyers and sellers get to FMV
Buyers and sellers zero in on a house’s FMV from utterly different directions
(see Figure 10-2). Buyers bring their offering price up to FMV because they
don’t want to overpay. Sellers, conversely, ratchet their asking price down to
FMV because they don’t want to leave any of their profit on the table.

177
Chapter 10: Determining Your House’s Value

Even though sellers and buyers approach FMV from opposite directions, note
that they end up at exactly the same place. That result is no surprise. If you
and the buyers rely on the same data — the asking prices and sale prices of
comparable houses — to determine FMV, you’re bound to reach the same
conclusion sooner or later.
Why “buying a listing” 
ruins property pricing
One crucial aspect of selling a house is correctly establishing its initial asking
price. If a seller prices a house near its FMV, the house usually sells quickly
for top dollar. If, on the other hand, a seller grossly overprices a property, it
tends to linger on the market month after month until the owner corrects the
problem.
Why would you be tempted to overprice your house? Because an unprinci-
pled real estate agent takes advantage of your legitimate concern about
underpricing your property, or, perhaps, the agent just wants to exploit your
greed. A bidding war develops among the agents who’re competing to list
your house for sale. The first victim of this bidding war is, unfortunately, the
concept of FMV. Here’s what happens:
“Thanks for giving me a chance to represent you during the sale of your
handsome house,” says Tommy Truthful, an agent from Honest Realty.
“As you can see from the CMA I prepared today, 142 houses sold in your
neighborhood during the past six months. Two are considerably larger
than yours, so they aren’t good comps. The 140 properties comparable to
your house in size, age, location, and condition sold in a price range of
$225,000 to $227,500. Based on this astonishing abundance of undeniable,
irrefutable, incontestable, indisputable, incontrovertible, unquestionable
facts, I recommend an initial asking price of not more than $229,500.”
“Wait just a second,” cautions Sally Slick from Aim To Please Realty. “You
may be leaving money on the table if your asking price is $229,500.
Comps aren’t everything. Your chimney is made of better quality bricks
than any of those other 140 houses’ chimneys. Even more importantly,
not one of the 140 houses has an ostrich-sized birdbath in its front yard.
These special features, in my humble opinion, are easily worth an addi-
tional $20,000. I recommend that you ask $249,500.”
“Facts, schmacts,” oozes Otto Outrageous from Sky High Realty, who fig-
ures he won’t get your listing unless he outbids the other two agents. “I
think that $249,500 isn’t even close to what you should ask. We’ll feature
your house on our Internet page and include it in the glossy, full-color
brochures we mail every week to our affiliate offices in Paris, London,

Rome, and Nome. Massive exposure is the key to maximizing your sale
price. I’m sure that if we look long enough and hard enough we can find a
buyer in some secret nook of this vast planet who’ll pay $275,000 for your
wonderful house.”
This deceptive approach — when several agents give a seller increasingly
outrageous opinions of a house’s value — is called buying a listing. Agents
who use this ploy think that the best way to get listings is to tell sellers what
they want to hear — that their house is unique and is worth way, way,
waaaaaaaaaaay more than any comparable house. Greed conquers reason.
This ruse may be a successful tactic for getting listings, but it’s a rotten way
to sell them. Property owners who succumb to fantasy pricing are con-
demned to waste their time until they finally return to real-world economics.
These misguided homeowners confuse the act of listing a house with the act
of selling it. Unless their listing agent intends to buy the house, the owners
and agent are playing an expensive game of let’s pretend.
The price you and your listing agent agree on doesn’t really matter. Until you
find a buyer who agrees with you, your house won’t sell. Resist the tempta-
tion to base your asking price on:
 The amount that you want your house to be worth
 The amount you need to receive from the sale to be able to buy your
dream home
Let the comps tell you the price your house is worth. Unlike unscrupulous
agents, comps don’t lie.

f you really want to be a successful seller, think like a buyer. You probably
didn’t buy the first house you looked at. Few folks do. On the contrary,
most people spend months industriously inspecting many houses on the
market. To avoid overpaying for the home they ultimately purchase, buyers
are forced to become experts on property values.
It’s a free country. You can ask any price you want for your house. But your
house won’t sell until you find a buyer who agrees that it’s worth the price
you’re willing to accept. Smart sellers know that although only one person
sets a price, two people — a seller and a buyer — make a sale.
Adverse factors outside your control (such as a flood of houses on the market,
high mortgage interest rates, or dismal consumer confidence) may negatively
affect your sale price. Even so, you don’t have to passively let the real estate
gods crush you. This chapter offers proven ideas that you can use to create
demand for your house no matter how poor prevailing market conditions are.
Getting a Grasp on Pricing Methods
Chapter 10 explains how to use the asking prices and sale prices of comps
(houses comparable to your house) to factually determine your house’s
value. This information puts you light years ahead of sellers who either don’t
know about using comps or, worse yet, choose to ignore comps when pricing
property.

You can pick a price for your house in a hundred different ways — visit an
astrologer, poll your friends for their guesses about its worth, roll dice, pay
for a professional appraisal, grab a number out of your hat, interview dozens
of real estate agents until you find one with a suitably elevated opinion of your
house’s value, and so on. In the final analysis, however, they’re all variations
of the two pricing methods we discuss in the following sections.
Four-phase pricing: Prevalent 
but ineffective
The consequences of pulling an unsubstantiated asking price out of the air
are unacceptable for a smart seller. You may undervalue your house and risk
leaving money on the table when you sell. Or, more likely, you may overprice
your house, which results in an exhaustingly slow marketing process that
ultimately lowers your sale price. Houses marketed by unrealistic sellers usu-
ally go through the following four distinct pricing phases prior to sale:
 Phase one: Sellers start by blithely disregarding any factual pricing
method, such as checking comparable property sales. Why? Some sell-
ers don’t know any better or get lousy advice from their real estate agents.
Other sellers think that their house is infinitely superior to those ticky-
tacky comps. They’re sure that their house’s inherent superiority will
quickly attract a buyer with more money than good sense. Either way,
this misguided method generally results in grotesque overpricing.
 Phase two: After several months of total market rejection, the sellers
grudgingly make a tiny price reduction, which brings their asking price
down from the grotesque level to merely absurdly overpriced. Fantasy
moderated is, however, still abject fantasy.
 Phase three: More lonely months pass, and then two things happen.
First, the sellers typically get a new agent — poetic justice for an agent
who either didn’t know property values or who intentionally misled the
sellers about pricing to get the listing. Second, the sellers reduce their
asking price to one that “leaves room to negotiate.” Even though the
revised price still is moderately higher than the house’s probable sale
price based on sales of comparable property, at least the new asking
price has some basis in market reality.
 Phase four: The sellers ultimately accept the validity of comps and
reduce their asking price accordingly to a “let’s sell it” level. After the
sellers establish a good correlation between asking price and fair market
value (FMV), their house finally sells.
Ironically, instead of getting more money with this method, four-phase pric-
ing usually stigmatizes a property and reduces the eventual sale price to less
than it would’ve been with more realistic pricing. Here’s why:
182
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

 The listing agent can’t justify an indefensible asking price. If the asking
price has no factual basis, the agent can’t provide a good answer to
buyers who ask, “Why hasn’t the house sold after all this time on the
market? What’s wrong with it?” In degree of difficulty, this situation ranks
right up there with, “Just what do you think you’re doing?” when your
mom caught you with your hand deeply buried in the cookie jar.
 The property is slowly but surely buried by new listings that come on
the market. After several months, most buyers and agents either forget
that your house still is on the market or belittle the house by saying,
“That old thing. It’ll never sell.” In desperation, sellers are forced to
slash their asking price to the bone to attract buyers.
Four-phase pricing creates a self-fulfilling prophecy. Folks who use this pricing
method expect it will take a long time to sell their house. In a strong market,
they’re correct because the market will ultimately rise to their price level. In a
weak market, they’re disastrously correct as they chase the market ever lower.
Pleasure-pleasure-panic pricing: 
Fast, top-dollar sales
If the four-phase pricing plan is a flop, what’s your alternative? We’re glad you
asked. The smart way to sell your property is the pleasure-pleasure-panic
pricing method. You can sell your house quickly and get the highest possible
price by using this method. The secret of success is establishing a realistic
asking price for your house when you first place it on the market.
As we note in Chapter 10, the correct way to establish an asking price is to
analyze houses comparable to yours in size, age, condition, and location —
houses that currently are on the market and those that have sold within the
past six months. Don’t be misled by asking prices; many sellers use four-
phase pricing. Sale prices, not asking prices, determine FMV.
Here’s how the pleasure-pleasure-panic pricing method works — Milt and
Judy have spent the last three months looking at houses on the market in
their price range. They’re educated buyers; they know how to distinguish
between a well-priced house and an OPT (overpriced turkey).
Judy and Milt nearly bought a great house a couple of months ago. It had all
the features they wanted and was fairly priced, to boot. However, Milt didn’t
realize how well priced it was because he’d just started the education
process. While Milt was haggling over the price and terms of sale, the seller
accepted a better offer. Judy still blames Milt for losing their dream house.
They’re spending today the same way they’ve spent the previous 11 Sundays,
touring what seems like an endless series of newly listed OPTs with their
183
Chapter 11: Price It Right and Buyers Will Come

agent. Then Judy and Milt trudge into your first open house and pleasure-
pleasure-panic kicks into gear.
 Pleasure Number 1: Judy and Milt love your property. It’s the best place
they’ve seen in the past three months. They could live in your house
happily ever after. Their eyes start to sparkle.
 Pleasure Number 2: Milt and Judy can’t believe their eyes when they
look at the asking price on your listing statement. By now, they know
property values every bit as well as their agent. Your house is definitely
priced to sell. Their hands start to tremble.
 Panic: Judy and Milt see another couple entering your house. They’ve
seen these folks at many other open houses during the past couple of
months. That familiarity isn’t a coincidence. The other couple obviously
wants to buy a house in the same neighborhood and price range.
Judy and Milt stare at each other in horror. If they love your house and
know that it’s well priced, so will the other couple. Their deodorants fail
when they realize that if they don’t act quickly, the other couple will
snap up the house. Milt tells their agent to write up a full-asking-price
offer. Judy kicks Milt in the shin and instructs the agent to go $1,000
above your asking price just to be safe. Milt agrees. He doesn’t want to
be a two-time loser.
That scenario explains how pleasure-pleasure-panic pricing creates a seller’s
market even in the midst of a buyer’s market. This approach puts intense
pressure on buyers to perform quickly.
Don’t be surprised if you get several purchase offers, including some that 
are equal to or more than full asking price, as soon as your house hits the 
market — if your house is priced right. After your property has been given
broad, immediate market exposure, spirited competition forces buyers to pay
top dollar for your house. This method works almost every time. (And, by the
way, we cover exactly how to handle multiple purchase offers in Chapter 14.)
Quantum pricing: An effective technique
Put yourself in the buyer’s shoes for a moment and imagine that you’re buying,
not selling, your house. If you’re like most people, one of the first things you
do is decide how much you want to spend. For example, you set your upper
limit of affordability at $250,000. If you’re working with a real estate agent,
you probably tell the agent, “I don’t want to spend more than $250,000,” or
“Don’t show me anything that costs more than $250,000.” Why waste time
looking at property you can’t afford to buy?
Buyers use price limits, called quantums, to simplify house hunting. Pricing quan-
tums are initially expressed in nice, round, easy-to-work-with numbers, such
as $100,000 and $50,000, and then fine-tuned to $25,000 and $10,000 quantums.
184
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

Think of buyers as fish swimming in an ocean of houses for sale. At any given
time, huge schools of buyer-fish usually are swimming in this sea. However,
the buyer-fish swim at many different levels; one school swims at the
$150,000-to-$200,000 price quantum level, another swims at the $200,000-to-
$250,000 price quantum level, and so on.
Buyer-fish from higher-price quantums occasionally swim down to a lower
quantum in their searches for a house. However, buyer-fish rarely swim up to
a higher quantum (if they establish realistic affordability limits). When a
buyer-fish can’t afford to swim up, the price must drop down to the buyer-
fish’s price quantum for the house to sell.
Establishing price quantums
Follow these steps to use price quantums to hone your initial asking price to
razor sharp, pleasure-pleasure-panic perfection:
1. Determine your house’s market value within the appropriate $100,000
quantum, unless you happen to live in an area where no house ever
has sold for more than $99,999.99.
Use the comparable market analysis (CMA) method described in
Chapter 10 to define a general price range for your property. For example,
if a CMA shows that five houses similar to yours in size, age, condition,
and location sold within the past six months for $310,000 to $335,000, your
house clearly belongs in the $300,000 to $400,000 quantum. So far, so easy.
2. Adjust the price within the correct $50,000 quantum.
Continuing with the same example, decide whether your asking price
should be over or under $350,000. Because not one of the comps sold for
more than $335,000, your price belongs in the $300,000 to $350,000 quan-
tum. As problems go, still no head-scratcher.
3. Fine-tune your price to the closest $25,000 quantum.
The more accurate your pricing, the more exacting your scrutiny.
Deciding whether the price should be in the $300,000 to $325,000 quan-
tum or the $325,000 to $350,000 quantum requires careful analysis. If, for
example, four of the five comps sold between $310,000 and $325,000 and
the fifth went for $335,000, you’d be wise keeping the asking price under
$325,000.
4. Ultrafine-tune your price to the nearest $10,000 quantum.
This is the moment of truth. Now you must decide on the precise point
between $310,000 and $325,000 to put your price. If the actual prices of
comparable houses that sold under $325,000 were $310,000, $317,500,
$319,500, and $322,000, three out of four sales point toward an asking
price under $320,000.
185
Chapter 11: Price It Right and Buyers Will Come

Recognizing quantum-pricing finesse points
If you seriously want to sell quickly for top dollar, don’t put your asking price
in the next higher quantum to give yourself “room to negotiate.” Here’s why:
186
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 
First offers are worth a second look
No law guarantees that the first purchase offer
you get will be the best one. However, as the
following example illustrates, it often is.
Elaine decided to sell her house shortly after
her husband died. The house was tough to
price. It was in mint condition, had a great view,
and was located on a large lot. It was far-and-
away the best house on the block. No homes
of equal quality had sold in her neighborhood
in well over a year. Elaine’s agent analyzed
recent sales of similar properties that sold in
comparable neighborhoods to determine an
approximate value per square foot for Elaine’s
house. Based on these sales, her agent rec-
ommended asking $499,500. Neither Elaine nor
the agent expected a fast sale because the
highest previous sale in the neighborhood was
$425,000.
Fortune smiled on Elaine. She got a $450,000
offer only two days after the For Sale sign went
up. The people who made the offer were edu-
cated buyers who’d been looking at houses in
her neighborhood for several months and were
primed to pounce on any new listing that fit
their needs. When their agent presented the
offer, he told Elaine that the contract’s terms
and conditions of sale were flexible, but that
the buyers were at their absolute upper limit
financially.
Elaine’s lawyer reviewed the offer. He found no
legal flaws, but told Elaine he thought she was
giving the house away. He reasoned that if she
could get a $450,000 offer so quickly, she’d
probably get a full-price offer soon.
Based on her lawyer’s gratuitous advice, Elaine
made a full-price counteroffer to the buyers.
They rejected the counteroffer and moved on.
Elaine’s house had many showings the first
month, but no other offers. After six weeks, her
agent called the agent of the couple who’d
offered $450,000 to see if they would submit
another offer. No such luck. They had bought
another house.
The real estate market went down the drain a
couple of months later because of a severe
economic slowdown. Elaine’s house finally
sold for $435,000 almost a year later. Had she
taken the first offer she received, she would’ve
made $15,000 more and spared herself a year
of aggravation.
With 20/20 hindsight, blaming the lawyer for
this fiasco is easy. However, blaming the
lawyer is unfair. His advice was logical and
compelling. When he gave it, no one could’ve
said with certainty that a full-asking-price offer
wouldn’t be forthcoming.
That’s the problem — uncertainty. Whether
your house is the most expensive one on the
block or the cheapest, no one knows what it’s
worth until it sells. FMV is established by the
amount buyers pay and sellers accept.
When a house hits the market, uncertainty
about FMV favors sellers. Therefore, the first
offer is often the best one. If the property is
priced close to the amount it’s worth, educated
buyers take their best shot at it. They want to
get the house before someone else does. The
fear of losing the house to another buyer works
to the seller’s advantage.
The longer a house sits on the market unsold,
however, the more uncertainty about FMV
favors buyers. Prospective buyers logically

 Excitement: It takes courage to price your house a hair below the nearest
price quantum (rather than above the quantum, so that you have room
to negotiate downward). For example, suppose that the comps indicate a
probable sale near $250,000. A $249,500 asking price may create enough
buyer excitement to generate multiple purchase offers that push your
sale price higher than the asking price. Price your property at $269,500 to
give yourself a $20,000 negotiating cushion, and your house is just
another yawner.
 Computers: All agents now use computers tied to their multiple listing
service’s (MLS) database to perform property searches. For example, a
buyer decides on a neighborhood and asks the agent for a list of homes
with the following features: three bedrooms, two-and-a-half baths, a two-
car garage, and an asking price of $250,000 or less. Per the agent’s request,
the MLS computer spews out listings that meet these conditions. The
computer isn’t smart enough to make allowances for properties with
negotiating room in their prices. If your house is listed at $269,500 or even
$251,500, it won’t be on the printout, and buyers won’t know it exists.
True, some agents show buyers higher-priced houses they think will sell
in the buyers’ price range, because the asking prices are “soft.” Smart
agents, however, know that buyers are deeply concerned about being
manipulated into purchasing a more costly house. These agents won’t
show buyers property over the stated price limit until the buyers have
seen every house on the market in their specified price range and
requested to see more expensive homes.
Less buyer exposure to your house means less buyer competition for it.
Less competition translates into a longer time on the market — and 
usually a lower sale price, to boot. High sale prices come from spirited
buyer competition.
 Conditioning: Whether people are buying houses or blouses, everyone
loves a bargain. Believe it or not, $9.95 advertising is mighty effective. A
nickel ain’t much, but most folks are well-conditioned to think that $9.95
is much cheaper than $10. Subconsciously, $249,500 is more exciting
than $250,000, and $299,950 sounds like a much better deal than $300,000.
Don’t try to buck a lifetime of Pavlovian conditioning; smart pricing
makes buyers drool.
187
Chapter 11: Price It Right and Buyers Will Come
reason that the house can’t be worth the
asking price because, if it were, it would
already have already sold. The more buyers
who see the property and don’t make an offer,
the more discredited the asking price
becomes.
Fast first offers frighten sellers and buyers.
Neither has the benefit of lengthy market expo-
sure to confirm FMV. Sellers who reject a
speedy first offer because it isn’t full asking
price take a calculated risk. A better offer may
come along — but, then again, maybe not.

Don’t price your property to dazzle your pals. You may impress people
at a party by telling them that you’re asking $300,000 for your house, but
that’s a foolish price compared to $299,950. Price your house to sell, not
to feed your ego.
Identifying Incentives and Gimmicks
In strong real estate markets with many ready, willing, and able buyers clam-
oring to purchase good houses, property priced near its market value typically
sells quickly. You don’t need additional inducements in a red-hot market.
But when the tables are turned, and sellers far outnumber buyers, even plea-
sure-pleasure-panic pricing may not do the trick (see “Pleasure-pleasure-panic
pricing: Fast, top-dollar sales” earlier in this chapter). If that’s the case, you
may have to offer buyers additional enticements to make a deal. In a buyers’
market, the key to success is using incentives that help put a sale together
instead of fancy gimmicks that tarnish your property and make it harder to
sell. This section highlights a few incentives and gimmicks you may encounter
when selling your house.
Deal-making incentives
In a really rotten market, you can sweeten the deal by offering buyers money
in the form of special financial concessions. One or more of the following
incentives may be the key to putting a deal together:
 Credits in escrow: One effective financial inducement is offering to pay
a portion of your buyer’s nonrecurring closing costs for such expenses
as loan origination fees, title insurance, and property inspections. You
may also graciously offer to pay for some or all of the repairs found by
the property inspections. As we explain in Chapter 14, these payments
usually are made as a credit in escrow from sellers to buyers.
 Seller financing: Chapter 4 explains the risks and rewards of seller
financing. On the plus side, financing some or all of the buyer’s mortgage
may get you a higher sale price, a faster sale, an attractive return on your
money, and possibly some tax savings. Doing seller financing, however,
ties up money you may need for the down payment on your new home.
Worse yet, if the buyer defaults on your loan, you must foreclose on the
mortgage to protect your money.
188
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

Deceptive gimmicks
Smart financial incentives make deals happen. Improper inducements (which
we call gimmicks, because that’s what they are) waste time and usually result
in lower sale prices. Impractical sellers sometimes resort to subterfuge in a
futile attempt to disguise how ridiculously overpriced their property actually
is. Instead of reducing the asking price to a realistic level, they try in vain to
enhance their house’s value with gimmicks that fall into one of the following
three categories:
 Buyer baubles: “Buy our house, and we’ll give you a free week in Paris
for two (or a diamond ring, a brand new motorcycle, whatever) to
sweeten the deal.” Occasionally, sellers make this type of offer in phases
one or two of four-phase pricing (explained earlier in this chapter in the
section “Pleasure-pleasure-panic pricing: Fast, top-dollar sales”). Sellers
erroneously assume that buyers will be so dazzled by the “free” goodies
that they won’t notice that the house’s asking price is outrageously high.
Buyers usually know that the asking price includes a gimmick’s cost.
They aren’t about to add the price of a trip to Paris, for example, into
their 30-year mortgage. Opportunities to fly now and pay forever won’t
sell a house. Neither will drive-now-and-pay-forever deals, or wear-now-
and-pay forever gimmicks. Buyers aren’t stupid.
 Agent payola: Some sellers offer special inducements, such as trips or
double commissions, to the agent who sells their property. These gim-
micks are nothing more than blatant bribes for agents to sell their buyers
down the river. Good agents categorically reject this kind of sleazy offer.
 Contests: As the California real estate market hit bottom in the mid 1990s,
a few desperate sellers decided that, if they couldn’t sell their houses,
they would give them away in contests. Owners of a $150,000 house, for
example, put an ad in the local paper inviting folks who wanted to enter
their contest to write a 250-word essay explaining why they wanted to
live in the house. Each contestant had to submit a $100 money-order entry
fee with the essay. If 1,500 people entered the contest at $100 a pop, the
property owners got their asking price. If, however, not enough people
entered to make the contest worthwhile, owners reserved the right to
cancel the contest and return all entry fees.
At least a dozen different California property owners tried variations of
the contest gimmick. The ploy was a resounding flop. These contests
uniformly drew far too little attention from contestants and far too much
attention from state law enforcement personnel concerned about possi-
ble violation of California’s antigambling statutes. The name of the game
is selling your house, not going to jail!
189
Chapter 11: Price It Right and Buyers Will Come

Even if you can find buyers gullible enough to overpay for your house, lenders
can’t consider the value of gimmicks when appraising property; the mortgage
won’t be approved if the property is overpriced. Our advice: Don’t waste time
and money on gimmicks.
Overpricing Your House
In a perfect world, your house will sell quickly for top dollar if you faithfully
follow our sage advice. By now, however, you’ve probably discovered that the
world is frequently far from perfect, and things don’t always go according to
plan.
What if you can’t sell your house even though you’ve done everything we 
recommend? Did you waste the money you paid for this book? Should you
abandon all hope of making a sale? Is it the end of the world as we know it?
No. This section can help you understand why no one may have made an
acceptable offer for your house.
Can’t sell versus won’t sell
The San Francisco Chronicle ran a front-page story about a Bay Area house
that was sliding down a muddy ridge that had been weakened by torrential
rains. Battered by a series of severe storms, the house was slowly cracking in
half. Mother Nature was putting the finishing touches on a remodeling job the
ill-fated homeowner had started only a few months earlier.
“Can’t,” used in the context of selling a house, means that the property is
impossible to sell. Unlike most people who claim that they can’t sell their
houses, the poor guy who owned this property really couldn’t sell it. There’s
no market for unintentional mobile homes.
Fortunately, the vast majority of homeowners who claim that they “can’t” sell
their houses are exaggerating. They aren’t disaster victims whose property
values have been abruptly reduced to zero. Usually, plenty of purchasers are
willing to buy their houses, and many lenders are ready to make loans to
those buyers.
If nothing is physically wrong with their properties, what’s the problem? Most
of the time, the predicament is because of overpricing camouflaged by denial.
A more accurate statement of the situation, for most would-be house sellers,
is “We are unwilling to accept the price the market tells us our house is cur-
rently worth.”
190
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

These homeowners can sell. They simply won’t sell. As long as you choose
not to take the amount that buyers will pay for your house, it will continue to
languish unsold on the market. Saying that you can’t sell your house is a self-
fulfilling prophecy.
If your house is under 6 feet of water, has been carried away by a tornado, is
now a pile of rubble because of an earthquake, or was ravaged by some other
natural disaster, you have a valid reason for saying that you can’t sell. If not,
don’t let denial blind you to the truth. You control your fate. You can sell your
house after you correct the problem that’s driving away prospective buyers.
Perhaps you didn’t follow our advice elsewhere in this book; you may have
overimproved your property for the neighborhood, done a poor job of select-
ing an agent, or failed to properly prepare your house for sale. More often
than not, however, the problem is overpricing.
Three factors all buyers consider
Sooner or later, all buyers hear that the three most important things to con-
sider when buying a home are location, location, location. Because you’ve
been through the purchasing process, you know that this cliché is a gross
oversimplification. Here are the three factors buyers actually consider when
selecting a home:
 Where the property is: Okay. The old “location, location, location” myth
is one-third true. Urban, suburban, or rural; high in the mountains, smack
in the middle of the Great Plains, or by a shining sea; you can’t get around
the fact that a house’s location greatly affects its value. People pay dearly
to buy into “good” neighborhoods. Folks buy location every bit as much
as houses.
 What the property is: A house’s cost depends on many factors such as
its size, age, condition, and architectural style. The quality of construction
materials and interior appointments also enter into property valuation.
 How much the property costs: Whether they’re buying the most expen-
sive house on the block or the cheapest, smart buyers try to get the
biggest possible bang for their bucks. Furthermore, most people do a
heck of a lot of comparison-shopping before they buy just to make sure
that they don’t overpay.
If you’re having trouble selling your house, look at it in the same way buyers
do. What can you change to bring your house’s price in line with a buyer’s
perception of its value? Analyze your property with these three crucial fac-
tors in mind:
191
Chapter 11: Price It Right and Buyers Will Come

 Can you change where the property is? Nope. Even if you could move
the house, the land under it stays put.
 Can you change what the property is? Possibly. For example, if a rusted-
out car is the focal point of your front yard, hauling the car away will
probably improve your prospects for making a sale. Reinspect your
property inside and out. Make sure that everything is in tip-top condi-
tion. Be sure to read Chapter 9 to find out the best ways to prepare your
property for sale.
 Can you change how much the property costs? Bingo. If you can’t
change the property’s location, and you’ve done everything you can to
prepare your house for sale, what’s left to change? The price! Don’t feel
bad if you unintentionally overprice the property. Anyone can make that
mistake. As we explain in Chapter 10, pricing isn’t an exact science.
Danger signs of overpricing
When you price property correctly, it sells. Conversely, even if your property
is in exquisite condition and actively marketed (open houses, classified ads,
MLS, Internet Web site, and so on, as we describe in Chapters 12 and 13), a
dearth of offers indicates that it’s overpriced. The warning signs of overpric-
ing may include any or all of the following:
 No second showings: Well priced or not, agents and buyers rush to see
new listings. Watch out for a precipitous decline in showings after the
initial flurry of activity when your house first hits the market. If nobody
returns for a second look, you have a problem.
 Many showings, but no offers: Switch hats — suppose that you’re a
buyer. Your agent shows you a three-bedroom, two-bath house for
$249,500. Then the agent takes you to a newer four-bedroom, three-bath
home just two blocks away — with the same asking price. The agent
doesn’t have to say anything; the difference between price and value is
starkly obvious. The first house helps sell the second one.
Your listing agent (if you’re selling through a real estate agent) should
help other agents route house tours by pointing out overpriced proper-
ties the agents can show their buyers before bringing them to your 
well-priced house. Successful agents show buyers OPTs (overpriced
turkeys) to sell well-priced houses.
The foolproof way to correct overpricing
During Ray’s 20 years as an active real estate broker, he managed hundreds of
real estate agents and participated directly or indirectly in thousands of sales.
Having studied the correlation between asking prices and sale prices through
192
Part III: Getting Top Dollar When You Sell 

all those years, he made an amazing discovery: Good market or bad, more
than 97 percent of all property sells within 10 percent of its final asking price.
Ray’s observation doesn’t mean that every house starts out with the correct
asking price — quite the contrary. Many properties go through a needless
series of ineffective price reductions before ultimately arriving at the correct
asking price. However, after owners finally reduce their houses’ asking prices
to within 10 percent of FMV, their properties sell.
If your house hasn’t generated any offers, even though it shows wonderfully
and is aggressively marketed, update your CMA. You may discover that your
house is overpriced by 5 percent, or by 20 percent, or, gasp, by even more.
When you update your CMA, consider the following:
 As we note in Chapter 10, it’s tough to precisely establish the value of
attributes such as proximity to bus lines, wonderful landscaping, and
views. Your listing agent, if you’re using one, or you may have given your
house’s amenities a much higher value than buyers do.
 You (or your listing agent) may have put too much emphasis on asking
prices or used inaccurate sales data. Perhaps houses that were on the
market when you prepared the CMA ultimately sold for much less than
their asking prices. Maybe some sale prices of comparable houses didn’t
reflect big credits in escrow from sellers to buyers for corrective work or
nonrecurring closing costs.
 The local real estate market may have gone down the drain. Did mort-
gage interest rates skyrocket, or did consumer confidence plummet
since the CMA was prepared? Adverse market conditions drag prices
down. Find out how many properties similar to yours have sold since
your house came on the market. Maybe nothing is selling. On the other
hand, if comparable houses are selling and yours isn’t, put on your hard
hat — falling price zone ahead.
 You may have missed the prime selling time. As we discuss in Chapter 5,
every real estate market has peaks and valleys of sales activity. For exam-
ple, suppose that you base your price on sales made during September
and October, when more buyers were active in your area. However, your
house actually went on the market the day after Thanksgiving, after most
buyers had vanished. Your timing is awful. To make a sale, you either have
to cut your price to the bone or take your house off the market until
buyers return in the spring.
Whatever the problem, don’t compound it with excessive tenacity. If you
haven’t gotten any offers after approximately six weeks on the market, and
other houses similar to yours are selling all around you, the odds are high
that your asking price is at least 10 percent more than your house’s FMV. Under
these circumstances, correct the problem by cutting the price 10 percent.
Here’s how to maximize the impact of your price reduction:
193
Chapter 11: Price It Right and Buyers Will Come

 Bite the bullet and make a full 10-percent cut. Making a series of smaller
price reductions only prolongs the agony. Your property will be forgot-
ten as more and more new listings come on the market. Don’t turn your
house into “That old thing? Something must be terribly wrong with it.
It’s been on the market forever.”
 Use quantum pricing to fine-tune the new price. Suppose that your
asking price is $279,500. A 10-percent reduction ($27,950) cuts the price
to $251,550, which isn’t a smart price. Never leave your asking price dan-
gling just above the next quantum. You lose exposure to all the buyers
who, for instance, instruct their agents not to show them anything over
$250,000. As we explain in the section “Quantum pricing: An effective
technique,” a smarter price is $249,950.
 If you still haven’t gotten an offer after another six weeks or so of
active marketing at the new price, make another 10-percent reduction.
You may have been 20 percent or more over FMV when you put your
house on the market. Perhaps you’re in a market where prices are declin-
ing. If that’s the case, the longer you delay a price cut, the greater the
gap between your asking price and actual market value.
Six weeks isn’t carved in stone. In a hot market, three or four weeks may
be more than enough time to give your house maximum buyer exposure.
In a slower market (such as the long, hot summer when kids are out of
school and many buyers and agents take vacations), you may be wise to
wait seven or eight weeks before a price cut. Let local market activity be
your guide when you time price reductions.
Placing the blame where it belongs
Telling sellers that they must cut their asking price if they want to sell is
extremely difficult for agents. Many agents can’t do it. They’re afraid sellers
will respond by saying, “This mess is all your fault. We relied on your advice
to set the price. A halfway competent agent could’ve sold our magnificent
house months ago. We don’t need a price cut; we need a new agent. Get out
of our house. Never darken our doorway again. We rue the day we ever met
you. Curse you and all your offspring forevermore.” Or words to that effect.
Firing the agent may be the correct thing to do. An agent who intentionally
overstates your house’s value to get the listing deserves to be dumped. By
the same token, a likable but inept agent is utterly worthless. You need a
good agent, not a fraud or a friendly fool.
Sometimes, however, dumping your agent is like throwing the baby out with
the bath water. Perhaps your house is tough to price because it’s unique or
because no recent comparable sales have occurred in the neighborhood.
Maybe the local economy took a nose dive right after your house went on the
market. Venting your frustration on the agent for telling the truth won’t get
your house sold.

Concentrate on real money
Ray had lunch a while ago at Perry’s (his
favorite San Francisco restaurant) with a friend
who was trying to sell her house. Jeannine had
a good agent, her house showed well, and the
property was being aggressively marketed.
But, after more than three months on the
market, she had nary a nibble.
“Why hasn’t my house sold, Ray? Is my prob-
lem the lousy real estate market?”
“Lousy is a matter of opinion, Jeannine.
Compared to the hot market several years ago,
sellers hate this market. Buyers, on the other
hand, love it.”
“What can we do? You know that my husband
and I paid $425,000 for our house at the height
of the boom market, and then spent $50,000
more remodeling it. We put it on the market in
January at $495,000. Even though we dropped
our asking price to $449,500 in March, we still
haven’t had even one offer.”
“If you can’t change what the house is or
where it is, what’s left to change, Jeannine?”
“Don’t say the price, Ray. We’re already losing
money at $449,500.”
“Property values in your neighborhood are
nearly 20 percent lower today than they were
three years ago when you bought the house,
Jeannine. That’s a hard, cold fact. Your
chances of a break-even sale are no better
than my chances of winning the Pulitzer Prize.”
“All I can think about is the money we’ve lost.”
“That’s the problem, Jeannine. You’re concen-
trating on money you’ve lost rather than money
you still have.”
“I don’t understand.”
“The money you lost when property values fell
is gone. You can’t get it back. Don’t waste time
thinking about it. Instead, focus on the money
you’ve still got in the bank. Real money is
money you haven’t spent yet.
“What do you mean, Ray?”
“You told me how much money you’ll save if
you move to a community with less expensive
housing and public schools to your liking.”
“True.”
“So every month the house doesn’t sell means
another raid on the real money in your savings
account to pay high housing costs and private
school expenses.”
“Correct on both counts.”
“That’s real money you don’t have to spend.
You can’t control the past. You can, however,
control your future housing and school costs.
Selling the house puts a tourniquet on the
money bleeding out of your savings account.
You know what you have to do to end this
misery. The choice is yours.”
Jeannine and her husband tried two more
weeks to sell at $449,500, and then cut their
asking price to $399,995. They accepted an
offer of $395,000 within five days after the price
reduction, and closed their sale 30 days later.
They recovered the amount they lost as sellers
by paying a lower price for their new home in a
town with an outstanding public school system.

C
urb appeal and staging are important aspects of showing your house off
to its best advantage (see Chapter 9). But, by themselves, curb appeal
and staging won’t sell your house. Even adding the sophisticated pricing
techniques from Chapters 10 and 11 to the package still won’t do the trick.
Regardless of how realistic your asking price may be, you lack one essential
ingredient to make a sale.
Face it. Without a buyer, you’re nothing more than the owner of a well-priced,
bewitchingly staged property with loads of curb appeal. You need a buyer to
convert you into a seller, and the best way to do so is to market your house.
This chapter can help.
Advertising That Works
In a red-hot seller’s market, just sticking a For Sale sign in your front yard pro-
duces all the buyers you need. When you have five buyers for every good
property on the market, advertising isn’t so critical.
Unfortunately for sellers, the market isn’t always hot. In fact, it sometimes
gets downright chilly. When your neighborhood is a forest of For Sale signs
and buyers are few and exceedingly far between, merely getting a buyer’s
attention is a major victory. The key to selling your house for top dollar —
even in a dismal market — is simple: Implement a broad-based advertising
campaign to generate spirited buyer competition for your property.

Advertising isn’t a cure-all. Glitzy advertising won’t sell a house that’s in terri-
ble condition, poorly marketed, and overpriced to boot. Give buyers and
agents credit for having a snippet of knowledge about property values and 
a smidgen of discernment. Think of advertising as the setting for an engage-
ment ring. The world’s most beautiful setting can’t transform a cheap zircon
into a priceless diamond. A stunning setting will, on the other hand, heighten
the appeal of an appropriately exquisite diamond.
Whether you list your property with a real estate broker who handles all your
advertising or you’re selling on your own, the same rules apply. Certain types
of advertising are extremely effective. Others, while popular, are big wastes of
time and money. The following sections describe types of advertising that get
our seal of approval.
For Sale sign
A humble, low-tech For Sale sign stuck in your front yard or nailed to your
house is, without a doubt, one of the most effective ways to tell folks looking
for a home in your area that your property is on the market.
Real estate brokers know that sign calls (people calling to get more informa-
tion about a house after they see the For Sale sign) are far more likely to
result in a sale than ad calls (people calling about property they read about in
an ad). Why? When ad callers find out the location of the advertised prop-
erty, the style of the house, the age of the house, or some other basic fact
they’d already know if they’d actually seen the property from the street, they
more often than not reject it. Sign callers, on the other hand, obviously like
the neighborhood and at least the property’s exterior, or they wouldn’t have
called; they have a higher probability of being serious buyers.
Good signs are simple and large enough for people to read easily. They include
these elements:
 The words “For Sale”
 A phone number to call
 The phrase “shown by appointment only” (unless you want people drop-
ping in on you unexpectedly at all hours of the day and night)
 Web site link (we cover using the computer to market your house in
Chapter 13)
 The listing broker’s company name (if you’re using an agent)
This information is all that you need on a sign. To attract folks driving by
your house, use a two-sided sign placed perpendicular to the road so that
people can read it from either direction. If you have a corner lot, use two
signs so both streets fronting your house have signs.
200
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Be sure that your sign makes a good first impression. Recycling is fine, but
don’t let your agent reuse someone else’s old, beaten-up For Sale sign on your
wonderful property; get a spiffy new one. A worn, dented, faded sign makes
your property look equally tired. Don’t put up the sign before you’re 100 per-
cent ready to sell, because after the sign goes up, you will start receiving calls.
Classified ads
The classified section of your local newspaper is a cost-effective way to reach
prospective buyers. Because most house hunters look at property on week-
ends, run an ad in your paper’s Sunday real estate section or its weekend edi-
tion. If you’re handling your own advertising, because you’re selling your house
without a broker, get some tips from the pros. Study real estate brokers’ ads
for ideas on phrasing your ad. People who work in the classified-ad department
usually can help you draft an ad and suggest standard abbreviations — such
as “br” for bedroom, “ba” for bathroom, and “fp” for fireplace — so you can
save money without confusing readers.
201
Chapter 12: Marketing Your House
Ineffective advertising
More than 99 percent of all residential property
sold in the United States is marketed using the
advertising techniques that we describe in this
chapter. True, you may need special marketing
to sell highly unusual properties, such as a 250-
year-old historic house in Olde Cape Cod or an
authentic castle that was disassembled stone-
by-stone in Ireland and painstakingly reassem-
bled lock, stock, and drawbridge on the vast
plains of Texas. However, ordinary advertising
techniques work just fine for the rest of us.
It’s flattering to hear agents say that your house
is so special that only a fancy four-color
brochure can do it justice. Furthermore, those
same agents may say that to get top dollar your
property must be advertised in their interna-
tional affiliate’s glitzy magazine that ends up on
coffee tables in Paris, London, Rome, Rio, and
other exotic spots around the world. And as
soon as you sign on the dotted line to list your
house with them, they’ll be delighted to get
started on the brochure and international
advertising program.
You know what’s happening (if not, we explain
this gimmick in Chapter 10). The agents are
trying to buy your listing. Before succumbing to
their blandishments, ask yourself how often
you see people from Paris, London, Rome, and
Rio buying houses in your neighborhood. The
world’s best brochure coupled with a world-
wide marketing effort won’t sell overpriced
property. Nor should you waste your time and
money on deceptive marketing gimmicks. As
noted in Chapter 11, essay contests don’t work.
Neither do bribes, such as trips to Tahiti or
expensive cars for the buyers of your house or
their agent. Stick to the basics; they work.

202
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 
Troublemakers to avoid when marketing your house
If you’re writing your own ads because you
aren’t using an agent, don’t put everything
about your property in the ad. For one thing,
running a big ad every week is expensive. In
addition, describing your property in too much
detail isn’t smart; good ads always leave out
one essential bit of information — such as the
address or number of bedrooms — so that
buyers have to call whoever placed the ad.
Real estate agents use ad calls to make show-
ing appointments. If you tell buyers everything
in your ad, they won’t have a reason to call, and
you lose the opportunity to convince them to
tour your wonderful property.
When you describe your house, failing to dis-
close information won’t get you in trouble as
long as you aren’t withholding material facts
that affect your property’s value or desirability.
What you do say, however, can turn out to be
legally expensive if ever you cross the line
between puffery and misrepresentation.
Puffery is the exorbitant use of high-sounding
adjectives to extol the virtues of otherwise
ordinary products. Everything from cars to
cleaners is praised as being newer, bigger,
faster, better, tastier, smoother, gentler, and, of
course, brighter. Fine. Today’s consumers are
wise enough to make allowances for advertis-
ers’ excessive enthusiasm.
As bad as puffery is, misrepresentation is far
worse. Folks can, after all, defend themselves
against puffery because they can see reality
with their own eyes. People know the differ-
ence between spacious and tiny no matter
what the ad says.
Misrepresentation deals with factors that
aren’t readily apparent. For example, suppose
that you’re selling a house that appears to be
in excellent shape. The buyer asks you if the
roof leaks. If you say that it doesn’t leak when
you know for a fact that the roof does leak,
that’s out-and-out misrepresentation. If the
buyers don’t have the roof inspected because
they rely on your statement about the roof,
they’ll probably do two things after the first big
rainstorm hits their new home — buy a new
roof and sue you. Never assume anything. “I
don’t know” is a perfectly acceptable and
absolutely safe response to any question you
can’t answer with complete certainty — never,
never guess.
How can you protect yourself from inadvertent
misrepresentation? Here are ten troublemak-
ers to avoid when writing your ad:
 All: Comparable words such as com-
pletely, totally, perfect, none, entirely, and
fully are equally naughty. They should be
avoided because they leave no room for
exceptions, errors, or discrepancies. “All
hardwood floors,” “completely remod-
eled,” and “totally renovated” are phrases
that can lead to a lawsuit if the buyer finds
one thing that disproves your all-inclusive
language. When that happens, your prop-
erty isn’t as advertised.
 Custom-built: The American Heritage
Dictionary defines this as “built according
to the specifications of the buyer.” Was
your house built to your specifications?
This term doesn’t apply to a home where
the developer created a plan and repro-
duced it multiple times. Custom-built is only
applicable to a made-to-order, one-of-a-
kind home.
 Fixed: This term is used when an animal
has been permanently neutered and can
never reproduce. When used to describe
corrective work done over the years, how-
ever, “fixed” leads many buyers to incor-
rectly believe a problem was permanently
rectified. A leaky roof, for example, is never
“fixed.” Trust us, it will leak again sooner
or later and when it does, the buyer will
sue. Instead of saying the leak was fixed,
say it was “repaired.”

203
Chapter 12: Marketing Your House
 Never: Just as dangerous as being too
expansive is the tendency to deny that
something can ever occur. “There has
never been a problem with (fill in the
blank)” has come back to haunt many a
seller when the friendly next door neighbor
tells the new owner about that one time
there was a problem with the sewer over-
flowing, flooding, high winds, elephant
stampedes, and so on.
 New: What’s new? With cars, they techni-
cally stop being new the moment they’re
driven away from the car dealership. There
isn’t such a fine dividing line in real estate,
but there’s logic we can apply. After appli-
ances have been used, they’re no long
new. A roof is only new for a brief time after
installation. Trying to be cute by saying
“newer” begs the question “Newer than
what?” It’s best to truthfully state when
appliances were installed or a repair took
place. Rather than saying “new roof,” use
the phrase “new roof installed (date of
installation).”
 Panoramic: Although views from a house
may be great, they’re seldom an unlimited
view in all directions, which is the true def-
inition of panoramic. Unless the house is
located at the top of a hill with a 360 degree
view of everything around it, this term
should be avoided. Words like breathtak-
ing, sweeping, grand, and awesome are
preferable.
 People: Avoid describing the neighbors or
the “ideal” future owner. Just because you
get along wonderfully with your neighbors
doesn’t mean the next owner will. Your
idea of the ideal future owner is subjective.
Litigation lurks.
 Quiet: This seemingly innocuous word has
triggered considerable litigation. In one
case, the cul de sac in which a house 
was located was always quiet in the 
winter when the real estate agent saw the
property. It was anything but quiet in the
spring after escrow closed when the
marching band began practicing in the
football field behind the house. Quiet is
subjective. For some people, hearing any
noise at all means the area isn’t quiet.
 Safe: Make no promise of safety or secu-
rity. No matter how safe you think the
neighborhood is or how secure the “child-
safe pool cover” is supposed to be, bad
things can and do happen. There’s no guar-
antee of safety or security.
 Square footage: Three appraisers can
measure a house and get three completely
different square footages. Always preface
any mention of square footage with a word
such as approximately, nearly, about, or
around to allow for error or lack of preci-
sion. Approximately 2,300 square feet is
safer than 2,320 square feet. If you must
use a precise number, cite the source of
your information (per tax records, asses-
sor’s records, and so on.)
Kip Oxman, an attorney by trade and our
brilliant technical reviewer, suggests using
the following disclaimer when stating
square footage: “If actual square footage
is material to Buyer’s decision to offer to
purchase the subject property, Buyer
should verify the square footage before
making the offer. Although approximate
square footage measurements according
to tax records, or reported in previous
appraisals, are sometimes available and
are useful as informational guidelines,
such numbers are frequently inaccurate.
Seller can’t guarantee the measurements
of others.”
The best ads are masterpieces of under-
statement. Ideally, you want to describe your
property in such a way that it actually delivers
more — not less — than the ads promise. No
one ever complains about that.

Thanks to the ubiquitous Internet, you may get an even bigger bang for your
classified advertising buck. Most newspapers now automatically put classi-
fied ads on their Web sites, so potential buyers from all around the world can
look for a house with the click of a mouse. Check to see whether your local
paper offers this benefit.
Multiple listing service (MLS)
A multiple listing service (MLS) is composed of and operated by local real
estate brokers and agents who pool their listings so that information about
property listed by any MLS member is immediately available to all participat-
ing members. Brokers and agents enter new listings into their computerized
MLS database as soon as the listing contract is signed. Price changes and
sales also are same-day entries. In most places, nonmembers (that is, the
public) can’t put property into an MLS.
If your property is listed with a real estate broker, insist that it be put into the
MLS. An MLS listing gives your property wide exposure to a potent pool of
market-educated buyers currently working with all other MLS members. If
you’re selling without an agent, consider paying a discount broker to put
your property into the MLS. As we note in Chapter 8, you must offer a com-
mission to a cooperating broker who procures a buyer for your property.
Listing statement
The listing statement, also called a property statement, is a data sheet and is
given to people who tour your property on Sunday open houses or people
who are shown through your house by appointment. Listing statements are
effective point-of-purchase ads containing more information than you can put
into a newspaper ad or an MLS listing (see Figure 12-1). This sheet offers you
a chance to wax poetic about the special features of your property.
To satisfy buyers with short attention spans and too much to do, include 
an abstract to briefly give basic facts about your property. The headline,
“Gardener’s Delight” in the listing statement in Figure 12-1, emphasizes the
property’s hot button (see the sidebar “Hot buttons”). A good listing state-
ment takes people through your house room-by-room pointing out special
features they may not notice, such as the working fireplace with gas starter,
the built-in curio cabinet, personal property such as fireplace tools included
in the sale, garden plantings, and the intercom system. A few other tips to
remember when writing your listing statement include the following:
204
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

 Don’t use fancy 17-syllable words when simple ones will do.
 Avoid rhetorical overstatement, such as “world’s most fantastic view” or
“extraordinarily enormous living room.”
 Keep the write-up short — one page maximum.
 Always include a disclaimer similar to the one we include at the bottom
of our sample listing statement.
Figure 12-1:
Here’s 
what a

looks like.
205
Chapter 12: Marketing Your House

The best way to avoid getting sued because your house is smaller than you
claimed it was is to avoid giving any square footages unless you’re absolutely,
positively, 100 percent certain about the measurements. If you’re inadver-
tently a few square feet shy of the square footage you stated, you could end
up being sued by a nit-picky buyer with a tape measure and too much spare
time. Actual square footage is less important than your buyers’ conclusion
that your house is big enough based on their visual inspection.
Computers
In addition to the computerized MLS, many brokers now have Internet Web
sites that they use to advertise their listings. As previously noted in the
“Classified ads” section earlier in this chapter, most newspapers put

Hot buttons
If you want to be a successful seller, figure out
exactly what you have to sell before you start
advertising. People don’t buy houses. They buy
hot buttons and the house tags along.
Hot buttons vary from one house to the next.
Gourmet kitchens, luxurious bathrooms, sensu-
ous bedrooms, working fireplaces, panoramic
views, and lovely gardens are turn-ons. So are
huge, walk-in closets — no one ever has
enough closet space. In densely populated met-
ropolitan areas like New York, Boston, and San
Francisco where parking spaces are slightly
scarcer than Hope diamonds, garages can help
sell houses. Location is a hot button if folks will
buy a mediocre house to live in a superb neigh-
borhood or to get their kids into a good school
system.
Good agents see houses through the eyes of
their owners. If you’re working with an agent to
sell your house, the agent will want to know
about the property features that most appealed
to you when you bought it. Whatever you liked
when you first saw the house will most likely
also be the next buyer’s hot button.
For example, suppose that your favorite part of
the house is the master bedroom with a charm-
ing little fireplace. You love watching the fire-
light dance on the walls and hearing the fire
snap and pop as you nod off to sleep on cold
winter nights. If that’s your house’s strongest
feature, then guess which attribute is empha-
sized in the listing statement, in the MLS write-
up, and in your weekly newspaper ads.
For Sunday open houses and broker tours, the
master bedroom is filled with fresh flowers and
a small fire crackles in the fireplace. Private
showings of your house to prospective buyers
always end, not by coincidence, in the master
bedroom because that room has the greatest
emotional impact on buyers. In fact, the master
bedroom is the closing room where agents
working with motivated buyers first suggest
writing up an offer on the house.
This approach doesn’t mean that the listing
agent ignores the rest of your house.
Everything is, of course, staged to show beau-
tifully. But smart sellers and agents push the
hot button because that feature is probably the
reason the next owners will buy the property.

classified ads on the Internet so computer users can access them without
having to dirty their fingers with newsprint. We devote Chapter 13 to describ-
ing ways you can use a computer during your sale.
Word of mouth
Word-of-mouth advice sounds so darn primitive coming right after
“Computers” in the preceding section, but networking is an extremely effec-
tive form of targeted advertising. Tell people you know — friends, business
associates, folks who go to your church, club members, and especially your
neighbors, that your house is for sale. Make a point of inviting your friends
and neighbors to your first open house. Who knows? One of them may have a
pal who’d love to buy your house. Stranger things happen every day.
Arranging Open Houses
If a picture is worth a 1,000 words, personally touring property must be worth
at least a couple of encyclopedias. That’s why, in a touchy-feely business like
residential real estate sales, open houses are an invaluable sales tool.
You can hold two distinctly different types of open houses to sell your prop-
erty. Even though each type of open house targets a different market seg-
ment, they share a common objective — to sell your property. This section
focuses on your two options.
Brokers’ opens
If you hire a broker to sell your house, one of the first things your listing agent
does after you’ve signed the listing contract is tell the local brokerage com-
munity about your property. One extremely effective way to get the word out
is scheduling a brokers’ open — a special open house exclusively for local
real estate agents.
Agents generally work with at least four or five serious buyers at any given
time. After these buyers have, for one reason or another, seen and rejected 
all the houses of interest to them that currently are on the market, they go
into a holding pattern waiting for a listing of just the right property. One pri-
mary mission of agents working with buyers is to scout out new property.
A brokers’ open is amazingly targeted marketing. No guarantees, of course,
but don’t be surprised if the first brokers’ open leads to a sale. After all,
having 50 agents tour your house is the equivalent of showing it to 200 or 250
motivated buyers.
207
Chapter 12: Marketing Your House

Although your house obviously won’t appeal to every one of the agents’
buyers, you can bet it’ll press hot buttons for a few of them. Well-priced,
attractive property almost always generates immediate showing requests.
With the advent of cell phones, agents don’t even have to wait until they get
back to the office to call their clients about the fantastic property (yours, we
hope) that they just saw on a brokers’ tour.
Most areas designate one particular day each week as Brokers’ Tour Day, the
day on which agents and brokers tour newly listed properties. If many new
listings enter the market the week of your first brokers’ open, some agents
won’t see your property because of scheduling conflicts with brokers’ opens
on other houses. Even if only a few new listings are available when your prop-
erty hits the market, some agents won’t see your house because they’re on
vacation, have offers to present, have escrows to close, or are holding other
houses open themselves. Whatever the reason, the way around scheduling
conflicts is to be sure that your listing agent schedules at least two brokers’
opens.
Weekend open houses
We start this section by noting that folks usually think of public open houses
as Sunday open houses. That idea is prevalent because most houses are held
open on Sundays. However, no law says that you can’t hold a Saturday open
house every now and then to scoop up people who can’t come to a Sunday
open house. Having planted that thought in your mind, we refer to all public
open houses from now on as Sunday open houses for simplicity’s sake.
Compared to brokers’ opens (see the preceding section), you have lower odds
of making a sale directly by holding a Sunday open house. But if you’re trying
to sell your house without an agent, you won’t have access to brokers’ opens.
After you open your house to the world at large, not everyone who walks
through the front door is a legitimate buyer. You get Lookie Lou’s trying to
pick up some decorating hints and curious neighbors who always wanted 
to know how your house looks on the inside. You also get real buyers who
were attracted by your open house sign, but need a home in a different size
or price range. Unfortunately, other than an address, open house signs don’t
contain a wealth of specific information to help qualify prospective buyers.
The incidental traffic isn’t necessarily bad for you. Unless your visitors are
terribly antisocial, people who come to your Sunday open houses probably
have friends or neighbors who want to buy in the neighborhood. Word of
mouth is powerful advertising (see the section “Word of mouth” earlier in this
chapter).
208
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

In a perfect world, nobody steals. Unfortunately, the world isn’t perfect.
Leaving small, easily portable valuables lying around during open houses is
an open invitation to thieves. Either put expensive jewelry, precious coins,
rare stamps, and your other small valuable items into a safe deposit box or
figure out another place to put them so they are out of harm’s way. If you
expect a great many visitors, see if your listing agent can get another agent to
help with your open house. One agent can show people through your house
while the other stays at the front door to greet visitors, get names, answer
basic questions, and, last but not least, watch for folks leaving the house with
suspicious bulges.
Showing Your Property
No one will buy your property sight unseen. Luscious listing statements,
appealing ads, and inviting photographs of your house’s interior and 
exterior fan the flames of buyer curiosity. To satisfy the inquisitiveness that
you arouse, you must let prospective buyers wander through your house.
If you list your house with a real estate agent, showings are an inconvenience
rather than a problem because a good agent handles the actual buyer and
broker showings for you. Your job is simple — make sure that the property 
is staged to show well and make yourself scarce while the property is being
shown.
Preshowing preparations
If you don’t know exactly how to generate property curb appeal and subtly
stage your house, turn to Chapter 9 for the details. In this section, we cover a
few final things you must do to maximize the showing process. These things
include
 Make showing your property easy for agents: The easier your house is
to show, the more often agents will show it, and, most likely, the more
you’ll get for your house and the faster it’ll sell. If you force agents to get
a house key from you before each showing, you’ll have fewer showings
because some agents are too busy to get the key, and others are too lazy.
Instead of personally doling out your key each time there’s a showing,
you have two options:
• Give the listing agent a key if your house is only shown by 
appointment
• Have your agent put a house key in a lockbox that agents open by
using a special lockbox key or electronically-coded lockbox card.
209
Chapter 12: Marketing Your House

From an agent’s perspective, nothing is more embarrassing or frustrat-
ing than trying to explain to an antsy buyer the reason she can’t unlock
the front door. Before you give the listing agent keys to your house, make
sure that the keys actually unlock the door and that the lock works
smoothly. (This is your chance to make a good first impression on the
buyer.) Lastly, if the house has an alarm, make sure it’s disarmed or that
the showing agent knows how to turn the alarm off.
 Make yourself scarce during showings: If you have a listing agent, leave
the property while your agent shows it. Some buyers are too polite to
say so, but having you hover over them as they tour your house is very
inhibiting. Serious buyers want to look into all your closets and cabinets,
look under all your sinks, and explore every nook and cranny of the
house — but they won’t if you’re hanging around.
By the same token, as long as you’re around, buyers won’t make deroga-
tory comments. Sometimes, the most important information you get
from a showing is the reason why someone doesn’t like the property.
Correcting a problem or overcoming an objection starts by finding out
about the problem or objection. Your agent should follow up every
showing by calling the buyer’s agent to find out whether the buyer
intends to make an offer and, if not, why not.
You can’t vanish during open houses if you’re selling without an agent.
Try, however, to be as unobtrusive as possible when buyers tour your
property. For example, don’t walk them through the house pointing out
the obvious: “This is the kitchen. Here’s the bathroom. This bedroom is
where the kids sleep.” Instead, point out special things they may not
notice, such as the high ceiling in your dining room or the fact that a
hardwood floor is under the wall-to-wall carpet in the family room. Make
your points selectively and remember that the quality of your guidance
is more important than the quantity.
 Get used to living in a fishbowl: If you follow our sage advice, your
house will sell quickly for top dollar. However, the sale probably won’t
seem quick. The best proof of the relativity of time is living in a house
that’s for sale and may be shown any time of the day or, within reason-
able limits, night. You can’t ever leave the bathtub dirty or dishes in the
sink or clothes on the bedroom floor or cook liver and onions or lounge
around in your bathrobe on Sunday morning or. . . . Be of good faith.
This, too, shall pass.
The final showing
You may think that you’ve been put out of your misery after you accept an
offer to purchase your property. “Goody,” you say, “No more showings — I
can have my life back.”
210
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Not quite. Inspections by the buyer’s property inspectors aside, one
extremely important showing remains: the inspection an appraiser makes as
a condition of your buyer’s loan approval.
This final showing to the appraiser is critically important. If the buyer’s loan
isn’t approved because the appraiser thinks that your property isn’t worth
the amount the buyer is willing to pay for it, your deal falls through, and
you’re back in the fishbowl again.
Take these two steps to prevent an appraiser from undervaluing your house:
 Shower the appraiser with attention and comps. Your agent (or you, if
you’re selling your house yourself) should be present during the
appraiser’s property inspection to “sell” your house one last time. In
addition to pointing out to the appraiser each and every valuable feature
of your house and the neighborhood, your agent can give the appraiser
an updated copy of the comparable market analysis (see Chapter 10)
originally used to establish your asking price. The appraiser can use the
comparable sales data to justify the sale price.
211
Chapter 12: Marketing Your House
Lockboxes versus shown-by-
appointment arrangements
Depending on the location of your property, you
may have to use a lockbox. If, for example, your
property is 50 miles from the nearest town or
located in a scenic but remote area, you may
not have a viable alternative to a lockbox.
From the standpoint of making your property
easy to show, lockboxes are great. Newer,
electronic lockboxes contain a computer chip
that maintains a record of which agent’s lock-
box card was used to open the box as well as
the date and time the property was shown.
Some lockboxes also have a lockout feature
that limits key access to certain hours so that
you can have some privacy every now and
then. Super-sophisticated lockboxes can even
be programmed with a call-before-showing
code that forces agents to call the listing agent
to get an additional code to enter the property.
But, the most sophisticated lockbox in the
world still has drawbacks. Lockboxes can’t
straighten up your house before a showing, or
tell you which agent let Duke, the wonder cat,
out of the house, or point a finger at the agent
who forgot to lock your front door after a show-
ing, or, most important of all, help sell your
house to buyers.
Houses can’t speak for themselves. That’s why,
if humanly possible, your listing agent must be
present every time your house is shown — to
answer buyer questions, point out special fea-
tures about your property and the neighbor-
hood, and keep an eye on your pet and your
valuables.

 Spiff your house up one more time. Appraisers are supposedly above
being influenced by a house’s appearance. Theoretically, appraisers won’t
get a bad impression if your property looks lived in. Sure. No matter what
appraisers say, they are human. Perfectly staging your house one last
time almost certainly makes a favorable impression on the appraiser. And
if you’re going for a record sale price in your neighborhood, every little
bit helps. One thing’s for sure — it certainly can’t hurt.

Harnessing Your Computer 
for House Selling
In This Chapter
 Knowing what real-estate-related Web sites can and can’t do for you
 Making the best and wisest use of software and the Internet to sell your house
U
nlike the investment industry, which has numerous avenues for do-it-
yourself investors to bypass securities brokers and their commissions,
the residential real estate industry isn’t easy for property sellers or buyers to
bypass real estate agents and deal directly with one another. Through multi-
ple listing services (MLS), in which local associations of Realtors pool their
property listings and restrict access to only member Realtors, real estate
agents retain a lock on about 80 percent of all property sales.
However, some say that the mushrooming use of computers and the Internet
threatens to challenge agent dominance of the real estate world. In theory, at
least, the Internet provides the public with a medium for direct and unfiltered
exchange of real estate information. And, more and more home buyers and
house sellers are turning to the Internet.
Real estate on the Internet has definitely changed and continues to change
the industry. The multimedia aspects of the World Wide Web are now being
better utilized in the selling process. Many house listings on the Web include
color pictures and a video tour. More homebuyers are taking advantage of
the Internet’s potential for researching and the grassroots exchange of real
estate information. This chapter includes our tips on the best ways to use (or
not use) your computer in the house-selling process.

Knowing the Internet’s Limitations: The
Net Alone Can’t Sell Your House
Many property sellers would love to sell their houses themselves to avoid
paying those commissions (amounting to 5 or 6 percent of the sale price)
that real estate agents collect. The Internet offers for-sale-by-owner (FSBO)
house sellers a potentially powerful marketing medium. Don’t think, however,
that just throwing your house on the Web is enough to sell it for top dollar.
The Internet is one of many ways to market a house. And, as we discuss in
Chapter 12, newspaper ads, For Sale signs, Sunday open houses, brokers’
tours, listing statements, and listings in the local multiple listing service
(MLS) are primary marketing vehicles. This section helps you identify what
the Web can and can’t do for you to help you sell your house.
Ensure good Web promo of your house
The Web can be a great way to promote your house, but you need to make
sure that prospective buyers can see it and easily access it. Keep the follow-
ing in mind to make sure your house listing gets ample hits on the Web:
 If you’re using a real estate agent to sell your house: Be sure your agent
has an Internet site through which you can list your house. Visit the site
and see what you think of it. Are the properties for sale well presented?
Is the site easy to use and visually appealing? Ask the agent if her com-
pany’s Web site is an Internet Data Exchange (IDX) participant. This
enables real estate brokers to share listings online among their various
Web sites so that your property gets maximum online exposure. Please
keep in mind, as we note in Chapter 7, that your selection of a good agent
should be based on many important criteria, such as her experience and
knowledge of the local real estate market and not simply their Web site.
 If you’re a FSBO seller: Should you be going the FSBO route to sell your
house, you’re going to have to get your house online yourself. Some
online options include
• PowerSites’ Agency Logic (www.agencylogic.com): For just $50,
you get your own domain name (for example, www.yourstreet
address.com) and hosting for one year ($25 for each additional
year). You can post up to 100 photos (make sure they’re good),
unlimited property descriptions, and links to useful information,
such as neighborhood info, school info, and so on.
Having a dedicated Web site address can also save you money on
print ads that you place for your house in newspapers and maga-
zines. You can run shorter ads and put your Web address in the
print ad for folks wanting more information. Agency Logic submits
214
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

your Web site to all the major search engines, and for a $25 addi-
tional cost, gets your property listing, including the virtual tour fea-
ture, onto Realtor.com (discussed in the last section in this chapter).
• ForSaleByOwner.com (forsalebyowner.com): Enter your state
and county, and this site, which sports the slogan, “No Commission.
Lots of Help,” walks you through preparing your online house-for-
sale advertisement. The cost is $89.95 per month with up to six pic-
tures or a one-time fee of $199.00 with up to six pictures. This site,
moreover, sometimes directs users to affiliated For Sale By Owner
magazines specific to states and other areas around the country.
• The International Real Estate Digest (IRED) (www.ired.com): An
online listing service, IRED’s “For Sale by Owner” category has a
lengthy list of local FSBO listing services, such as the Madison Area
for Sale by Owner Web service (www.fsbomadison.com). These
local services often offer better coverage of a specific area than the
national services.
• SaleByOwnerRealty.com (www.salebyownerrealty.com): This
site not only helps you get your house-for-sale listing online, but it
also gets you into the realtors’ MLS for six months for a basic fee 
of $399.
• Other sites: Also tap into the popular real estate listing Web sites
such as www.craigslist.org and http://base.google.com
as well your local newspapers’ classified ads and Web sites.
To understand what FSBO ads can and can’t do for you, check out the next
section for more info.
Knowing the truth about for-
sale-by-owner (FSBO) sites
If you’re attempting to sell your house yourself, the Internet can be useful as
a supplementary marketing tool. You can either create your own Web site or
list your property through one of the online FSBO listing services. Although
creating your own site allows you to go crazy and take full advantage of the
Web’s multimedia capabilities (you can post color photos of your property,
include a floor plan, offer a video tour, and so forth), consider using a good
FSBO listing service, instead. Building your own site takes a great deal of time
and money . . . and (sorry to say) you’ll probably get as much traffic as a
small North Dakota town in January.
Most FSBO online sites charge FSBO sellers a modest fee to list houses for
sale. At Owners.com (www.owners.com), for example, for $80, you can list
your house for sale along with unlimited photos and property descriptions,
215
Chapter 13: Harnessing Your Computer for House Selling

customized yard sign with a toll-free answering service, and a video. It also
takes no time at all: Spend a few minutes filling out a simple online form, click
“Enter Listing,” and presto! You’ve just posted a national online For Sale sign.
The success rate for sellers using online listing sites is spotty. The owners.com
site, for example, doesn’t report the actual success rate of its customers (they
do provide some testimonials).
These types of Web sites have relatively few listings and — compared to the
overall number of houses on the market — aren’t going to attract much traf-
fic. Pat Low’s experience was typical among online FSBO listers we know. She
listed her house on a FSBO site and had few online inquiries. “The more seri-
ous inquiries came through more traditional channels, such as newspaper
ads, lawn signs, and open houses,” she said.
Before parting with any of your hard-earned money at a Web site, be clear
about why you’re going online. Remember that the Internet is only one of
many marketing tools and rarely gets a house sold (see Chapter 12 for effec-
tive marketing tools). Also remember that most FSBO Web sites get little traf-
fic. Finally, recognize that by placing ads in larger local newspapers, you’ll
probably be getting your ad online because most newspaper classifieds
appear online now as well as in print.
Realize the limits of valuing 
your house online
Numerous Web sites, such as www.getmyhomesvalue.com, www.home
pages.com, www.realestateabc.com, www.trulia.com, and www.zil
low.com, offer “tools” that purportedly help you value your house online.
Simply enter your street address, these sites say, and you’ll be told what your
house is worth. Before you spend any money or submit any personal informa-
tion, understand that these sites can only do so much for you and most of
them aren’t worth your time or money.
In fact, the worst of these sites are frauds. They are nothing more than refer-
ral sources for real estate agents looking for new listings. After providing
your address, phone number and all sorts of other personal information, one
such site sends you an e-mail that says the following:
“Thank you for telling us about yourself and your real estate needs. You
may soon get a phone call from a number you don’t recognize, if you fall
within our service areas . . . Because instant, online valuation can be off
by as much as 10 to 20 percent (we’re talking tens of thousands of dollars
here), we’ll put you in direct contact with one qualified local real estate
professional who will give you the most accurate information you can get.”
216
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

This commentary is quite revealing in two respects. First, it demonstrates the
true agenda for how these “free” online pseudo-valuation services make
money — through referrals to real estate agents. Second, by their own admis-
sion, their accuracy isn’t good.
Whether you’re using a real estate agent or trying to sell your house on your
own, don’t determine your house’s asking price in this way! Such methods
won’t work because
 Web sites lack important property details. When you type in your
house’s address into valuation Web sites, most sites know little more
about your property than what you paid for it (and sometimes not even
that) and perhaps how many bedrooms and bathrooms it has. Most sites
don’t know about the improvements you’ve made to the property, cur-
rent square footage, yard size, and myriad other factors that affect your
house’s value.
217
Chapter 13: Harnessing Your Computer for House Selling
View negative commentary by agents skeptically
If you’re looking for online tips for selling your
house yourself, be aware that real estate agents
overparticipate in the exchanges and message-
board postings on this topic. Consider, for exam-
ple, the experience of a house seller who was
trying to sell her house on her own and posted
the following question on a message board sup-
posedly devoted to FSBO issues:
“I’ve run an ad for a week . . . a real estate
friend says not to let the house get stale by
letting it run in the paper for more than a
week. Can a house get stale in a week?”
She asks a good question worthy of enlight-
ened discussion. But that’s not what she got.
What she got was an earful on why she should
get an agent to sell her house. Among the
numerous responses by real estate agents, she
received the following postings:
“ . . . Many, maybe most, FSBO sellers walk
away with less money than a Realtor could
have gotten them — even after paying the
commission . . . we do a lot of work to earn
our commissions.”
“As a top agent with a major company, I
must let you know that it is extremely diffi-
cult to sell as a FSBO. There is so much
available housing. Most serious buyers are
working with real estate agents. Unless
your home is unique or is in a special area
where there is little availability of housing,
I would say that you need the resources of
a top agent with a major company . . . .”
If you want information about selling a house
yourself, don’t expect to find it online, especially
from the many agents who populate online mes-
sage boards. As we discuss in Chapter 6, sell-
ing your house yourself is far from impossible,
especially if you have real estate experience, a
good head on your shoulders, and the proper
team assembled to help you. Reading a good
book on house selling, such as the one you have
in your hands, is essential, too!

 Valuation methods generally are simplistic. Because house valuation
Web site tools have so little data on your property, most sites superfi-
cially value your house. For example, knowing that you bought your
house three years ago, many sites simply add a percentage increase that
the average home in your larger metropolitan area has enjoyed during
that time period. For the reasons cited in the previous bullet, at best
you’re getting only a general assessment of what your house may now
be worth. Home values don’t all rise (or fall) by the same percentage in
various towns and neighborhoods in a given metropolitan area. The
price changes that Web sites use often are 6 to 12 months old, which in a
rapidly changing real estate market can lead to large valuation differences.
We’re not saying that Web site house valuation tools are totally worthless.
Some of these sites enable you to find out what various properties in your
area are selling for — information that’s even more valuable if you’ve actually
toured the insides of those houses. But please don’t use these sites to value
your house.
Relying on Software and the Web 
to Determine Whether to Sell
Whether you’re trading up to a more costly property or looking to downsize
and you need to figure out whether to sell your house, you need to review
your overall personal financial situation, especially your budget. You can rely
on financial software and the Web to help make the decision.
Chapter 2 details how to analyze a proposed house sale in the context of your
overall finances. If you enjoy harnessing the power of your computer instead
of using the old-fashioned tools of paper, pencil, and calculator, you can use
software programs such as Quicken or Microsoft Money to assist with your
budgeting and expense tracking. (If calculators are already considered old-
fashioned, what does that make us?)
If you need to crunch some numbers to see where you stand in saving for
your retirement, good software can be a godsend. Check out Vanguard’s Web
site (www.vanguard.com), or T. Rowe Price’s workbooklets, which can be
obtained by calling (800) 638-5660 or by using their online tools at www.t
roweprice.com.

Chapter 13: Harnessing Your Computer for House Selling
Using the Internet to buy your next home
Although this book is about selling your house,
you probably need a new place to live after you
sell your property. If you’re in the market to buy
a home, in addition to the International Real
Estate Directory (IRED) at www.ired.com,
you can also look at the following sources:
 The National Association of Realtors: The
National Association of Realtors has a
major online site (www.realtor.com)
that links regional MLS systems all across
the country and gives public access to
more than 3 million listings in hundreds of
metropolitan areas.
If a community that you’re interested in is
covered by the National Association of
Realtors’ Web site, you may be over-
whelmed by the thousands, perhaps even
tens of thousands, of houses for sale in 
that particular area. Fortunately, the site
includes a handy-dandy search engine for
screening homes based on dozens of cri-
teria (such as property type, numbers of
bedrooms and bathrooms, square footage,
and whether the property offers a laundry
room, swimming pool, or ocean view).
From the National Association of Realtors’
home page, use the “Find a Home” section
to get started.
The Realtors aren’t surrendering all their
valuable information, partly for security
reasons (for example, the site provides zip
codes only, addresses are rarely given
out). The site also doesn’t reveal commis-
sion rates on listed houses. That disclosure
might show the public that commission
rates are, in fact, negotiable.
 Local newspaper electronic classifieds:
Increasing numbers of local newspapers
are putting their wares online, especially
their classified advertising. Using one of
the Internet search engines mentioned
earlier in this chapter, simply enter the
name of the town you’re interested in along
with the words “real estate.” For example,
type Chicago and real estate if you’re in the
market for a home in the windy city. Such a
search ferrets out real estate newspaper
classifieds as well as other online real-
estate-related sites covering that market.
Alternatively, if you know the name of the
local newspaper, try doing a search using
the newspaper’s name.
If you’re searching for a home in a small
town, your search may come up empty. If
so, try entering the names of large cities or
towns nearby that delightful small town
you want to move to.
Be skeptical of home-buying advice you find on
real estate Web sites, especially recommen-
dations about the mortgage amount you can
afford when you’re in the market as a buyer.
Most mortgage calculators simplistically use
your overall income figure and the current loan
interest rate to calculate the mortgage amount
you can “afford.” Such calculators are really
spitting out the maximum a bank will lend you
based on your income. This figure has nothing
to do with the amount you can really afford.
These calculators don’t ask, for example, how
you’re doing on saving for retirement, or how
many kids you have to put through college.

papers, hear on the radio, and see on TV through the years eventually take
their toll. With most consumer products other than cars, we’ve been condi-
tioned for generations to docilely pay the sticker price. (As we discuss in
Chapter 11, smart sellers know how to use this conditioning to their advantage
when pricing houses.)
Like it or not, you must sit at the bargaining table if you offer your house for
sale to the public. Even if you’re not the haggling sort, you certainly don’t
want to sell your house for less than it’s really worth. And you have every
right to be cautious regarding the advice of real estate agents and others
involved in your transaction who stand to profit from a quick sale.
Knowing your house’s worth, covered in Chapter 10, isn’t enough. You must
also be a good negotiator to minimize the chances of being forced into accept-
ing a crummy offer and to maximize the proceeds from your house’s sale.

We can’t offer you a magical, one-size-fits-all, guaranteed best negotiating
strategy that you can use in every situation, because no such strategy exists.
Smart sellers adjust their negotiating strategies to accommodate such factors
as whether they’re dealing from a position of strength or weakness, how well-
priced their houses are, how motivated the buyers are, and, of course, how
motivated they, themselves, are.
Negotiation doesn’t have to be complicated. On the contrary, good negotiation
is based on a few simple concepts. Apply the concepts in this chapter to your
negotiations to maximize the chances of getting precisely what you want
when you sell your house.
Mastering Your Feelings
Unless you’re an unquenchable emotional vampire, the massive pulses of
intense feelings radiating from both sides of the bargaining table will quickly
drain your energy. House sales are usually emotional roller coasters for every-
one involved. You probably still bear the emotional scars from the turmoil you
endured as a homebuyer.
Now, as a house seller, you’re about to sit on the other side of the table. If you
don’t get enough from the sale, you may not be able to buy your next dream
home. Buyers may accuse you of being greedy if you try to sell your house
for a great deal more than you paid for it. Conversely, buyers won’t shed any
tears if you lose money when you sell; it’s not their fault the local economy
went as soft as a jelly doughnut.
Consider the powerful emotions acting on you when you sell your house:
 Big needs: Food, security, and shelter are the three most basic necessi-
ties of life. Like two bears fighting for a single cave, you and the buyers
will do verbal battle over a place to live.
 Big egos: The house you’re about to sell is your castle. If buyers or their
agents attempt to justify a low offering price for your house by citing its
real and imagined flaws, your blood may boil.
 Big money: Whether this house is the first you sell or the last, the money
you have in it probably represents one of your largest investments. The
amount of money you receive when you sell isn’t the issue. When major
sums of real money are at stake, the emotional intensity for you and the
buyer is just as great, no matter whether your house sells for $150,000
or $1.5 million.
 Big changes: Selling a house would be stressful enough if you had to 
deal only with the impact of needs, egos, and money. Throw in a major
life change, such as job relocation, marriage, divorce, birth, death, or
retirement, and the result is an emotional minefield.
222
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Putting emotions in their place
Suppose that you’ve been trying for months, without success, to sell your
house in a profoundly depressed real estate market. In your dreams, you find
buyers who fall so blindly in love with the property that they simply must
have it and eagerly offer to pay your modestly inflated asking price. You con-
veniently ignore the glaring reality that property values in your area have
plummeted since you bought the house several years ago — a fact that ought
to dash any hope of selling the property for the amount you paid for it.
Allowing such wishful thinking to seep into a negotiation can cost you dearly,
but what choice do you have? Unless your heart is a lump of coal, how can
you not get emotionally involved when you sell something that you love and
that holds many dear memories (not to mention most of your hard-earned
money)?
Because you can never eliminate emotions from the process of selling your
house, the next best option is to understand and manage them. Your choice
is simple: Either you control your emotions, or your emotions control you.
People can’t upset you unless you let them. Folks who do the best job of 
controlling their emotions usually end up getting the best deals.
To control your emotions, try using the following time-tested tactics:
 Keep your sale in perspective. Which would you rather have fail — your
house sale or your open-heart surgery? No matter how bad circumstances
are with the sale, keep reminding yourself that this isn’t a life-or-death
situation. Tomorrow is another day. The sun will rise again, tulips will
bloom again, and children will laugh again. Life goes on. If worse comes
to worst, the deal will die — but you’ll survive to find another buyer.
 Make time your ally. Even if you must sell because of some momentous
life change — such as getting married or divorced, having a baby, or
retiring — you probably have advance notice before the big event
occurs. Don’t put yourself under needless pressure by procrastinating.
Give yourself enough time to sell your house. Allocate time properly,
and it will be your friend and not your enemy.
 Maintain an emotional arm’s length. Be prepared to walk away from a
sale if you and the buyer can’t reach a satisfactory agreement on price
and terms. Mentally condition yourself to the possibility that the deal
may fall through; keep other options open. Buyers are like buses — if
you miss one, another one comes along in a little while.
 Get the facts. Use a comparable market analysis (CMA) to factually estab-
lish the fair market value (FMV) of your house (see Chapter 10). A good
real estate agent can help in this area. If you’re like most people, having
someone to buffer you from your unavoidable emotional involvement
helps. Make sure that you work with patient, not pushy, professionals 
who are committed to getting you the best deal.
223
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

 Accept the unknown. You always have more questions than answers at
the beginning of a deal. Don’t worry; you’ll be fine as long as you know
what you need to find out (and guess what — this book tells you), and
you get answers in a timely manner during your transaction.
Gaining detachment through an agent
Unlike you and the buyers, good real estate agents don’t take things person-
ally. For example, your agent won’t be offended if the buyers say that they
hate the red-flocked wallpaper that you feel adds “just the right touch” to
your den. On the contrary, your agent simply points out to the prospective
buyers that they can easily customize the den with new wallpaper of their
choosing. The buyers’ agent, by the same token, won’t be upset if your agent
says that the buyers’ offer for your exquisite house is ridiculously low.
Objectivity is easier for agents. After all, they’re not the ones who spent three
months looking for appropriate wallpaper to put in the den. Nor are their life’s
savings on the negotiating table. Good agents listen to what the market says
that a house is worth. If they don’t, the property doesn’t sell, and they don’t
get paid. Agents don’t allow distracting details (such as how much time and
money you spent fixing up the house or how little the buyers can afford to
pay for it) to confuse negotiations. As Chapter 10 explains, these need-based
issues have nothing to do with a house’s FMV.
Following Some Basic Rules
If you take the right steps, you end up in the right place. Your deal can 
practically take care of itself if you follow these basic negotiating guidelines:
 Conduct all negotiations eyeball-to-eyeball. Never, not ever, no way, no
how let your agent or lawyer “save time” by using the phone to present
a counteroffer or to negotiate important issues. It’s too easy for people
to say “no” over the phone. Even if the buyers agree with everything you
want during a phone conversation, they may change their minds when
it’s time to actually sign on the dotted line.
 Get everything in writing. Written contracts evolved from the muck and
mire of legal quicksand because people have lousy memories. If you want
your deal to be enforceable in a court of law, put all the terms in writing.
Make a habit of writing short, dated MFRs (Memos For Record) of impor-
tant conversations (such as, “June 2 — buyers’ agent said that they’ll
have loan approval by Friday,” “June 12 — buyers asked to extend close
of escrow one week,” and so on).
224
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

 Make sure that deadlines are met. Real estate contracts are filled 
with deadlines for everything from contingency removals and deposit
increases to the ultimate deadline, your close of escrow. Failure to meet
each and every deadline can have dreadful consequences. Your deal may
fall apart — you may even end up in a lawsuit. However, most deadlines
are remarkably flexible. They can usually be lengthened or shortened by
negotiation if the need for revision is properly explained and handled
promptly with adequate lead time.
Surviving the Bargaining Process
Negotiation is like an escalator — both are a series of steps without a neatly
defined beginning or end. Each step in the negotiating process begins by
gathering information. Our goal for this book is to help you understand the
procedure for selling a house. Your job is to translate this information into
action that generates more information, which, in turn, leads to further
action. And so it goes, until you sell your house.
You generally start the negotiating process by gathering information about real
estate agents to select one to represent you. Next, you decide on an asking price
for your house by gathering data on sale prices and asking prices of comparable
houses. As you conduct this field research, you also prepare your house for
sale by sprucing it up inside and out and by gathering information on its physi-
cal condition. This preliminary work sets the stage for the next action step in
the negotiating process.
Receiving an offer to purchase
After your house goes on the market, you’re ready to begin the formal part 
of the negotiating process — receiving an offer to purchase. Unfortunately, no
standard, universally accepted real estate purchase contract is used through-
out the country. On the contrary, purchase contracts vary in length and terms
from state to state and, within a state, from one locality to another. The con-
tract you get reflects what, generally, the buyer’s agent or lawyer considers 
to be appropriate for your area.
In Appendix A, we include the California Association of Realtors’ Real Estate
Purchase Contract, so you can see what a well-written, comprehensive resi-
dential real estate contract looks like. California’s contract is, legally speak-
ing, well-tested and considered to be at the forefront of real estate purchase
agreements. That fact is no surprise when you consider that, according to the
California State Bar Association, one out of seven lawyers in the United States
practices law in California.
225
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

A carelessly worded, poorly thought-out offer can turn a potentially produc-
tive negotiation into an adversarial struggle. Instead of working together to
solve your common problem (that is, “I want to sell; you want to buy. How
can we each get what we want?”), you and the buyer get sidetracked by
issues that can’t be resolved so early in the negotiating process.
Although selling a house can be a highly emotional experience, good offers
defuse this potentially explosive situation by replacing emotion with facts.
Buyers and sellers have feelings that can be hurt. Facts don’t. That’s why
facts are the foundation of successful negotiations.
When you evaluate the offers that you receive, check for the following 
characteristics, because a good offer
 Is based on the market value of your house as established by the sale
of comparable property: Smart buyers don’t pull offering prices out of
thin air. Instead, they base their offering price on properties comparable
to your house in age, size, condition, and location that have sold within
the past six months. As Chapter 10 explains, many house sellers’ asking
prices are sheer fantasy. Sale prices of comparable houses are facts.
226
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 
Agent-negotiating warning signs
In Chapter 7, we advise you to select a real
estate agent who’s, among other things, a
master negotiator. The fact that your agent has
good negotiating skills, however, is no guaran-
tee that he always uses them properly.
Good negotiators avoid making moral judg-
ments. As long as a buyer’s position isn’t illegal,
it’s neither fair nor unfair. It’s just a negotiating
position. Of course, agents are human. Some-
times, even the best agents temporarily lose
their objectivity in the heat of battle. You know
that objectivity is flying out the window when
your agent gets red in the face and starts
accusing the other side of being unfair.
If your agent snaps out of the funk quickly, no
problem. If, on the other hand, your agent can’t
calm down, you’ve lost your emotional buffer.
Agents who lose their professional detachment
are incapable of negotiating well on your behalf.
No matter how satisfying it may be to go on an
emotional rampage with your agent about a
buyer’s utter lack of good taste, market knowl-
edge, and common sense, getting angry won’t
sell your house. If your agent doesn’t maintain
a level head, you can ask your agent’s broker
(see Chapter 7) to step in to negotiate for you,
or you can get another agent.
As we caution in Chapter 10, if your agent
“bought the listing” by overstating your house’s
value so you’d list the property with him, you’ll
belatedly discover your property’s real worth.
After it goes on the market, your agent will
misuse his negotiating skill by trying to per-
suade you to cut the asking price instead of
diligently negotiating with buyers and agents to
accept your price. If you’re in this position,
dump the agent who betrayed your trust and
find a new agent who tells you the truth.

 Has realistic loan terms: The buyers’ proposed mortgage interest rate,
loan origination fee, and time allowed to obtain financing (which we
explain in the upcoming section, “Dealing with contingencies — necessary
uncertainty”) should be based on current lending conditions in your
area. Ideally, the buyers are also preapproved for a mortgage, indicating
that they’re ready, willing, and financially able to purchase your house
(see the nearby sidebar, “Loan prequalification versus preapproval”).
 Doesn’t ask for a blank check: Unless property defects are glaringly
obvious, or you already have inspection reports on your property, nei-
ther you nor the buyers know whether the house needs corrective work
when the offer is submitted. Under these circumstances, consider using
property-inspection clauses (which we explain in the next section) that
allow you and the buyer to reopen negotiations for any necessary 
corrective work after the buyers get their inspection reports.
If you agree with the price and terms of the buyer’s offer, all you have to do to
indicate your approval is sign the offer. Your John Hancock turns the offer into
a ratified contract (that is, a signed or accepted offer).
However, signing an offer does not mean that you’ve sold your house. Because
of the various contingencies contained in most contracts, ratified offers remain
highly conditional until all contingencies are removed.
Dealing with contingencies — 
necessary uncertainty
Any offer you receive may contain some buyer escape clauses known as con-
tingencies. A contingency gives buyers the right to pull out of the deal if some
specific future event, such as getting a mortgage, fails to happen within a 
certain period of time.
Contingencies create uncertainty for you as a seller. The more contingencies
buyers put into a contract, the more ways they have either to get out of the
deal or to reopen negotiations for better terms. Most offers contain contin-
gencies, unless you have mobs of people falling all over themselves to buy
your house. The two most common contingencies are
 Property inspection contingencies: Your house’s physical condition
greatly affects its value. Smart purchasers insist on finding out exactly
what shape your house is in before they buy it. If they don’t approve the
inspection reports or can’t reach an agreement with you about handling
corrective work for problems uncovered during the inspections, these
contingencies let buyers bail out of transactions.
227
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

 Financing contingencies: The buyers can withdraw from the contract if
the mortgage specified in their contract isn’t approved. That provision is
usually fine. If the buyers can’t get the loan they need to buy your house,
why go any further — unless you’re willing to risk personally offering
them financing, a topic we discuss in Chapter 4.
Here’s a typical loan contingency:
“Conditioned [the magic word] upon buyer getting a 30-year, fixed-rate
mortgage secured by the property in the amount of 80 percent of the pur-
chase price. Said loan’s interest rate shall not exceed 7.5 percent. Loan
fees/points shall not exceed 2 percent of loan amount. If buyer can’t obtain
such financing within 30 days from acceptance of this offer, buyer must
notify seller in writing of buyer’s election to cancel this contract and have
buyer’s deposits returned.”
If you want to see a more detailed financing contingency, read paragraph 2 of
the California Association of Realtors’ (C.A.R.) purchase contract in Appendix
A. Read paragraphs 4.A, 7, 9, and 14 of the C.A.R. agreement to see how most
common kinds of property inspections are handled contractually.
Other common contingencies give buyers the right to review and approve
your property’s title report and, if you’re selling a condominium, the condo’s
master deed, bylaws, and budget. Buyers can make their contracts contin-
gent on other reasonable events, such as having their lawyers review and
approve the contracts or having their parents inspect the house.
What good, you may wonder, is a ratified offer riddled with escape clauses 
so big you can drive a truck through them? We’re glad you asked.
 From the buyers’ viewpoint, a contingency-filled ratified offer still
shows your intention to sell them the property. The buyers don’t have
to worry that you’ll sell the house to someone else while they’re spend-
ing time and money inspecting it.
 From your perspective, a contingency-filled ratified offer ties up the
buyers. If the buyers deposit earnest money (money given by a buyer to a
seller to bind a contract) into escrow to prove that they aren’t toying with
your affections and then spend hundreds of dollars more for inspections,
they’re serious buyers. (By the way, there isn’t a standard earnest money
deposit. The actual dollar amount varies from area to area, depending on
local custom and practice.)
Making a counter offer
Counter offer forms are far less complicated than purchase offer forms. Take
a look at the California Association of Realtors’ Counter Offer in Figure 14-1,
for example; it’s only a one-page form.

Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

For example, paragraph 1.C of your counter offer may say, “Buyers hereby
agree to delete paragraph 40 of their purchase contract regarding Aunt Jane,
the astronaut, inspecting the house when she returns from her trip to the
moon.” After all, who knows how long her mission may be delayed in space?
What if Aunt Jane falls in love with the man in the moon and never returns?
That contingency is too spacey.
Or suppose that the buyers offer $175,000 for your house and want you to
close escrow 30 days after accepting their offer. Because you’re asking
$189,500, you think that their offering price is a smidge low. Furthermore, 
you need six weeks to relocate.
If everything else in the buyers’ offer is fine with you, don’t rewrite the entire
offer. Instead, give the buyers a counter offer stating that you’ll accept all the
terms and conditions except that you want $185,000 for your house, and you
need six weeks after the offer is accepted to close escrow.
Wham. The ball’s back in the buyers’ court. They review your counter offer
and decide a six-week close of escrow is okay, but they won’t pay more than
$182,500. They zap you a counter counter offer to that effect. You sign it to
ratify the offer.
230
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 
Loan prequalification versus preapproval
Smart buyers get a lender’s opinion of their
creditworthiness before making an offer to pur-
chase. They establish creditworthiness by
going through two processes:
 Prequalification: An informal discussion
between a prospective borrower and a
lender. The lender provides an opinion of
the loan amount a buyer can borrow based
solely on information the buyer tells the
lender. The lender doesn’t verify anything
the buyer says, nor is the lender bound to
make a loan when the buyer is ready to
purchase.
 Preapproval: A far more rigorous process.
Loan preapproval is based on independ-
ently documented and verified information
regarding a buyer’s likelihood of continued
employment, income, liabilities, and cash
available to purchase a home. The only
thing a lender can’t preapprove is the prop-
erty itself because, of course, the buyer
hasn’t found it yet.
If your prospective purchasers have taken the
trouble to get preapproval for a loan, you know
that you’re dealing with serious buyers. A
lender’s preapproval letter is considerably
stronger than a prequalification letter. In a 
multiple-offer situation when several different
buyers simultaneously submit competing offers
on your house, give purchasers who are preap-
proved for a loan much more consideration
than buyers who aren’t proven creditworthy.

Define time frames with counter offers
Reread the typical loan contingency near the beginning of this section. Note
that it states that the buyers have 30 days after the offer is accepted to get
approval for a mortgage. If the prospective buyers can’t get a loan within 30
days, you have the choice of either giving them a few more days to get financ-
ing or putting the house back on the market. Either way, you’re in control of
the situation.
Good contingencies always have precisely defined time frames within which
buyers must complete a specified action or drop out of the contract. Never
accept an open-ended contingency. For example, if buyers want their parents
to inspect your house but don’t specify when that inspection will take place,
counter them with “parental visit shall take place not more than 3 days after
offer is accepted.” Be realistic but brisk when you set time frames. As a rule,
the faster you close buyer escape hatches, the better. You don’t want your
house off the market any longer than is absolutely necessary.
Think twice before accepting an offer that’s subject to the buyers selling their
present house before buying yours. This is the ultimate open-ended contin-
gency. It stigmatizes your house by driving away other prospective purchasers
who can’t put their lives on indefinite hold while they wait to see whether the
buyers sell their house.
If you accept a “subject to sale of buyer’s property” contingency, counter it
with a release clause giving you the right to accept a better offer if one comes
along. This provision is called a 72-hour clause because sellers generally spec-
ify that they can cancel a deal 72 hours after notifying the buyers that they’ve
gotten another offer.
Why 72 hours? If the new offer comes in on Friday night, 72 hours gets the
buyers through the weekend to the next business day in case they need to
consult someone who’s only available weekdays during normal business hours.
Pick your battles selectively
A counter offer is like a stick of dynamite. If you’re not careful, it can blow
your fledgling deal to smithereens.
Making counter offers is a great idea if you have a hot property. However, 
suppose that you get your first offer six weeks, three days, and four hours 
(but who’s counting?) after putting your house on the market. You don’t have
bunches of buyers banging on your front door to get your attention. You need
to sell your house and get on with your life. Under these conditions, you can’t
afford to squander your one and only live prospect.
231
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

If this scenario hits a little too close to home, follow these tips:
 Don’t counter small stuff. Suppose that the price and terms are okay 
but the buyers want to include your 10-year-old washer and dryer in the
sale. You want to take the washer and dryer with you to your new home,
but what the heck. If they’re 10 years old, the washer and dryer aren’t
worth much now. And, if you leave them for the next owner, you won’t
have to pay to move them to your new home. You can always buy a brand
new washer and dryer if the house sells. Buyers often act emotionally and
then find reasons to justify their actions. If you accept the buyers’ offer,
they’ll think how smart they were to have made it. Conversely, counter-
ing the offer may give them a reason to kill the deal and find a more
“cooperative” seller.
 Don’t kill the messenger. If the offering price is way below your price,
don’t reflexively counter at full asking price. You (and your agent, if
you’re using one) may have overpriced the house initially, or market
conditions may have worsened since you put the property up for sale.
As we discuss later in this chapter, a low offering price from a prospec-
tive buyer may accurately reflect your property’s current market value.
Reanalyze your house’s FMV by examining up-to-date asking prices and
sales of comparable properties. Don’t blow away a realistic buyer with
an unrealistic counter offer.
 Stay focused on your goals. Suppose that you want to move into a new
school district before school starts. Although you don’t want to give
your house away, ask yourself whether delaying the sale is worth pro-
tracted haggling over who’s going to pay for a couple of hundred dollars
in repairs. Set your priorities and don’t take your eyes off your goals.

Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 
Backup offers
If you suspect that the deal on your house may
fall through, you are wise to protect yourself by
obtaining a backup offer. One situation that
screams for a backup offer is any contract that
contains a “subject to sale of buyer’s property”
contingency. A backup offer also is advisable
if your buyer is obviously struggling to qualify
for a loan or if you and the buyer hit a brick wall
on some negotiable provision of the contract
(such as the way to handle corrective work 
for problems discovered during property
inspections).
A good backup offer clearly states that you’ve
already accepted another offer on your property.
It also stipulates that the backup offer won’t take
effect until you give the backup buyers formal
written notice that your prior contract is can-
celed. In other words, the backup offer is contin-
gent on the deal in first position falling through.
Motivated buyers generally don’t stay in
backup position very long. They keep looking at
other property after signing your backup offer.
If something better comes on the market while
you’ve got them on hold, they’re gone in a flash.
Backup buyers can usually bail out of a backup
offer anytime they want before you advise
them that the offer in first position is dead.

Negotiating from a Position of Strength
Hope springs eternal. So do motivated buyers and their agents — good market
or bad. They gush from one new listing to another in high hopes that the next
house they see will be that elusive “perfect home” for which they’ve been
searching.
Hope is the reason that most new listings get so many showings. Hope also
explains why, in a strong real estate market, new listings that are “priced to
sell” generate multiple offers. Knowing that they’re in a multiple offer situation
puts buyers under tremendous pressure, which is wonderful for you, the seller.
In a sellers’ market, competition forces buyers to take their best shot right off
the bat. When the supply of ready, willing, and financially able buyers
exceeds the inventory of houses available for sale, smart buyers follow the
advice Civil War General Nathan Bedford Forrest gave his troops before they
went into battle: “Get there firstest with the mostest.”
If you’re a seller in a buyers’ market, don’t give up. Even in a weak market,
well-priced, well-marketed, attractive new listings can and do draw multiple
offers. If you follow our advice in Chapter 9 on preparing your house for sale,
and you use the smart pricing techniques we describe in Chapter 11, you can
create your very own sellers’ market — even when everybody around you is
experiencing a buyers’ market.
Death and taxes are sure things; multiple offers aren’t. Your property won’t
generate the kind of excitement that produces multiple offers unless it really
shines and is priced to sell.
Handling multiple offers
In quiet markets, or when a house is overpriced, offers slowly dribble in one-
by-one, and agents or buyers present them to sellers as soon as possible.
That’s the customary way to handle offers throughout this great land.
Buyers and their agents are naturally paranoid. They suspect sneaky, dishon-
est behavior if sellers do anything that’s the least little bit out of the ordinary.
Postponing the presentation of an offer is generally considered unusual.
Suppose that you need 24 hours to respond to any offer you get because you
must have your lawyer review it. Unless you explain the reason for your delay
to the buyers, they’ll think that you want to shop their offer. Shopping an offer
means showing the offer to every other prospective buyer you and your
agent can find, in an attempt to get someone to make a higher offer.
233
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

Shopping an offer isn’t illegal, but it is considered unethical. Buyers have
every right to expect that their negotiations will be handled discreetly. They
don’t want the terms and conditions of their confidential offer blabbed to the
world anymore than you want everyone to know all your innermost financial
secrets. Reputable sellers like you never shop offers.
Unfortunately, other folks don’t know you as well as we do. Smart buyers try
to prevent you from shopping their offers by putting short fuses on them. In
such cases, shades of Mission Impossible, their offers may contain a clause
saying that the offer expires if you don’t either accept or counter it immedi-
ately upon presentation.
In multiple-offer situations, presentations often are delayed. If you anticipate
receiving multiple offers, develop a strategy for handling them before putting
your house on the market. If you don’t, you’ll probably end up trying to calm
down an angry mob of buyers and their agents waving offers with short fuses.
Events can move quickly after you set in motion the marketing process that
we describe in Chapters 12 and 13.
Delaying presentation of offers
Why make buyers or their agents wait to submit offers? You want to be sure
that your property gets sufficient exposure to prospective buyers so that you
can generate multiple offers. Nothing is illegal or unethical about this tech-
nique. The key to success is alerting buyers and agents well in advance about
the precise time you’ll start accepting offers and the way you’ll handle those
offers when they come in.
How do you notify buyers and agents that you’re requiring a waiting period
before considering offers? Simple. In the Comments section of the multiple
listing write-up and on your property’s listing statement, your agent can note
the time when you’ll allow offers to be presented. Just to be safe, also instruct
your agent to tell everyone who calls about the property that you’re delaying
the presentation of offers.
Timing is critical. If your property’s market exposure is too short, you may
accept an offer before a reasonable number of prospective buyers find out
that your house is on the market. Conversely, if you make people wait too
long while you try to expose the property to every possible purchaser in the
universe, some motivated buyers may show their displeasure by withdrawing
their offers or never making one in the first place.
No time frame is perfect — long enough to expose the house to every poten-
tial purchaser, yet short enough to avoid losing even one buyer. Some buyers
won’t get the word because they’re out of town on vacations or business
234
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

trips when your house hits the market. Others won’t make an offer if they
can’t present it immediately. Some people may refuse to get into a multiple-
offer situation because they fear they’ll overpay for your house if they get
into a bidding war.
To establish the waiting period before allowing presentation of multiple offers,
try one of these two methods:
 Ask your agent or lawyer whether your area has a commonly accepted
protocol for handling multiple offers. You can’t go wrong doing busi-
ness the same way most everyone else does. Don’t go against local
custom and practice unless you delight in provoking suspicion.
 If no standard protocol exists for your area, complete the initial mar-
keting sequence we describe in Chapters 12 and 13 before starting the
presentation process. As you expose the property to agents, they then
schedule showings for their clients who may be interested in your house.
To reach buyers who aren’t working with agents, delay presentations
until your classified ad appears once in the local paper, and you’ve had
one Sunday open house.
Setting guidelines for an orderly 
presentation process
Unless you set firm ground rules early on, the presentation of offers may
resemble the Oklahoma land rush. To ensure that presentations are handled
fairly for each and every prospective buyer (and productively for you), you
or your agent (if you’re using one) should tell interested parties that the fol-
lowing guidelines are in effect:
 Offers will be presented in the order in which you or your agent was
notified that offers were pending. As buyers or their agents announce
that they have an offer to present, put their names on a list. What could
be fairer than first come, first served? No one can accuse you of playing
favorites.
 Neither you nor your agent will accept offers before the designated
formal presentation period. No one can accuse you of shopping offers 
if you don’t have any offers to shop!
 Buyers or their agents can personally present offers directly to you
and your agent. This rule reassures buyers and agents that offers will be
presented in the best possible way without any filtering or shading. This
approach is also good for you because you can question buyers or their
agents directly while evaluating the pros and cons of each offer that you
receive.
235
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

Some sellers review multiple offers without permitting agent presenta-
tions. This approach speeds up the process because it keeps sellers from
having to listen to endless twaddle about how wonderful buyers are,
how much they love the house, how long they’ve been looking, and so
on, gag, choke. Unfortunately, this practice enrages the losers because
they all know they’d have won if only their offer had been presented
properly. Upsetting potential buyers isn’t wise. You may need them later
if the offer you initially accept falls through.
 Tell prospective buyers in advance that you’ll either accept or counter
the best offer you receive. Getting multiple offers doesn’t guarantee
that any of the offers will be more than full asking price. However, if you
announce in advance that you won’t counter every offer, smart buyers
make the best offer they can right off the bat. They know you don’t
intend to give them a second chance if they submit a tire-kicking, “let’s
leave room to negotiate” type of offer.
Selecting the best offer
By applying the astute marketing techniques and crafty pricing strategy we
describe elsewhere in this book, you earn the right to dictate favorable terms
and conditions of sale for yourself if you have multiple offers on your hands.
Buyers know that you have a hot property. The pressure is on them to please
you. No reasonable request you make will be refused. Your wish is their 
command.
Whether you have three offers or 33 lying on the kitchen table, you face the
same dilemma: selecting the best one. Price isn’t the sole criteria. The highest
offer is far from best if it’s riddled with dubious escape clauses, totally out of
synch with your time frames, or made by someone who’s a week or two away
from declaring bankruptcy. What good is a high offer from a buyer who can’t
or won’t perform?
Pitting buyers against each other is a double-edged sword. On the plus side, a
bidding war can catapult the ultimate sale price above your asking price. You
may, however, make a major mess of things if you’re not careful. You may scare
off all the buyers by making absurdly high counter offers. Worse yet, you may
convert multiple offers into multiple lawsuits by inadvertently ratifying more
than one offer.
236
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

As a seller in a sellers’ market, avoid snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
and follow these tips:
 Think like a lender. In a strong sellers’ market, spirited buyer competi-
tion often pushes prices to new heights. Lenders usually support higher
prices when they reflect an overall market trend and when the mortgage
isn’t an excessively high percentage of the purchase price. You deter-
mine that percentage, called the loan-to-value ratio, by dividing the loan
amount by the purchase price.
Remember: From a lender’s perspective, the higher the loan-to-value
ratio, the greater the risk that a buyer will default on the loan. So, as a
rule, the lower the loan-to-value ratio, the better the chances of getting
loan approval.
Suppose that you get two offers: One offer is $200,000 with a $150,000
(75 percent loan-to-value) loan contingency. The other is $205,000 with 
a $184,500 loan (90 percent loan-to-value). If the highest previous compa-
rable sale in your area is $190,000, you’re smart to either accept or
counter the $200,000 offer, as long as other terms and conditions of the
two offers are about the same.
 Don’t issue more than one counter offer at a time. When faced with mul-
tiple offers, you have four options — accept one, counter one, counter
more than one, or reject all offers. If you counter several offers, you may
inadvertently end up in contract to sell your house to more than one
buyer. This dreadful situation is known as double ratification. The resulting
debacle will devastate you financially and emotionally. The one sure way
to avoid this dreadful scenario is to follow this rule.
If for some unfathomable, self-destructive reason you ignore our sage
advice and issue multiple counter offers simultaneously, at least try to
protect yourself from double ratification by using a clause similar to
paragraph 4 of the C.A.R. Counter Offer shown in Figure 13-1. Be sure to
specify that your counter offer must be resigned by you before it’s fully
ratified as noted in paragraph 7 of C.A.R.’s Counter Offer.
 Qualify buyers carefully. Commit the last section of this chapter 
(the one about real versus fake buyers) to memory. If you have a poor
memory, put a bookmark in that section and keep this book by your side
while evaluating prospective buyers. When you question agents about
their buyers, scrutinize each purchaser’s creditworthiness, motivation
to purchase, and deadline for when the transaction must be complete.
If you have any doubts about buyers’ financial qualifications, get their per-
mission to contact the lenders directly to resolve your questions before
accepting or countering their offers. A buyer who’s been preapproved for 
a loan by a reputable lender has a Good Borrower Seal of Approval — as
long as the mortgage that buyer needs to buy your house doesn’t exceed
the preapproved loan amount.
237
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

 Pay as much attention to terms and conditions as you do price.
Sometimes, a lower price beats a higher one. For example, when you
evaluate offers, seek terms that fatten your bottom line. If a buyer offers
to purchase your house “as is,” you won’t have to worry about paying
for corrective work or reducing your sale price because of a bad inspec-
tion report. If you need a quick sale, the best buyer is the one who can
close fastest. Then again, the best buyer may be the one who’ll let you
rent your house back after the sale if you need a place to stay until the
close of escrow on your new home. Remember: Price isn’t everything if
you have other, more compelling needs.
 Avoid conflicts of interest resulting from dual agency. Dual agency
occurs when the same agent or real estate broker represents buyer and
seller. If your listing agent also represents one of the people making an
offer to buy your house, that agent has a conflict of interest, plain and
simple. How can “your” agent get you the highest possible price and
simultaneously help a buyer get the lowest possible price? Can “your”
agent give you unbiased advice as you evaluate the other offers you
receive? Read Chapter 7 for more information.
Most real estate firms have procedures to handle dual agency. If your
listing agent also develops a buyer, the agent’s sales manager or broker
usually steps in to represent you during the presentation and evaluation
of offers. This approach frees your agent to work with the buyer during
this phase of the deal. However, if your listing agent is a sole practi-
tioner, you may be wise to get a real estate lawyer or another outside
expert to assist you.
Negotiating from a Position of Weakness
The opposite of multiple offers is no offers. Zero. Zip. None.
An absolute absence of offers may be caused by a horrendous real estate
market plagued by a sagging economy, poor consumer confidence, and high
mortgage rates. Like it or not, a divorce, job transfer, or some other major life
change may compel you to sell in a rotten market. If it’s any consolation,
you’ll probably recover the amount you lose as a seller by paying a propor-
tionately lower price for your new home — unless you compound your mis-
fortune by moving from a weak real estate market to a strong one.
However, suppose that the economy is booming, consumers are wildly opti-
mistic, and houses around you sell faster than you can say, “We’re outta here!”
If you have a problem getting offers in such fertile ground, bunkie, something
is seriously wrong either with your property or your asking price. Review
Chapter 9 to make sure that you’ve done everything possible to spruce up your
house, and Chapter 11 in case you inadvertently overpriced your property.
238
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

When either your price or property is flawed or your local market is stagnant,
you may attract strange buyers bearing odd offers. The following sections
offer tips to help you make the best of whatever comes your way.
Rejecting lowball offers
A lowball offer is one that’s far below a property’s true FMV. For example, if
someone offers you $150,000 for your house when recent comparable sales
data show that it’s worth every penny of $300,000, that’s a lowball offer.
Lowball offers are typically made by unmotivated buyers trying to get a deal,
by sharks who hope that you’re desperate and willing to negotiate, or by
buyers who think that your property is overpriced. Serious, informed buyers
know the difference between well-priced properties and overpriced turkeys.
(See Chapter 10 for a brush-up on methods to determine your house’s FMV.)
Dealing with lowball offers
Suppose that you just put your house up for sale. You priced it as close as
humanly possible to its FMV. Two days after your house hits the market, you
get an offer. Trembling with excitement, you open it. You don’t read any fur-
ther than the absurdly low purchase price.
Either the buyers haven’t done their homework regarding comparable home
sales, or they think that you don’t know your house’s real value and they’re
trying to exploit your ignorance, or they’re trying to steal your house. As a
seller, you can handle people who lowball your well-priced house in one of
two ways:
 Let the buyers know that their offer is totally unacceptable by having
your agent return the offer unsigned. Why waste time making a coun-
teroffer to people who are either idiots or scoundrels?
 Make a full-price counter offer. Show your contempt by hardballing the
buyers on each and every term and condition in their offer. Two can play
this self-destructive game. If they waste your time, you waste theirs.
(Although emotionally satisfying, this response is lose-lose negotiating,
and we don’t recommend this approach.)
People who lowball a well-priced property destroy any chance of developing
the mutual trust and sense of fair play on which cooperative negotiation is
based. Real buyers know the difference between an offering price that gives
them room to negotiate and a preposterous lowball offer.
239
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

Recognizing lowball offers that aren’t
An enormous difference exists between submitting an offer at the low end of
a house’s FMV and lowballing. For example, suppose that someone offers
$240,000 for your house, which is listed at $249,500.
You based the asking price on the fact that comparable houses in your neigh-
borhood recently sold in the $240,000 to $249,500 price range. You naturally
opted to start at the high end of the range of FMVs. The buyer just as natu-
rally began at the low end. Even though you and the buyer are $9,500 apart,
each of you has a factual basis for your initial negotiating position.
As long as an offer is based on actual sales of comparable houses, it isn’t
insulting. The $9,500 gap sparks a lively debate as you and the buyer try to
defend your respective prices. A buyer who comes in on the low side of a
property’s value is fine, as long as you have time to negotiate, and you
believe that the buyer is motivated.
When you and a buyer come in on opposite ends of the fair market price
range, the best defense is a good offense. You’re most likely to prevail in the
pricing debate if you have an encyclopedic CMA and your agent is a strong
negotiator who’s personally eyeballed all the comps. Follow our guidelines in
Chapter 10.
Sometimes, a lowball offer is, in fact, a reality check. The offer isn’t a lowball
offer if it accurately reflects current market values. Ironically, some sellers
provoke low offers by unwise pricing. These sellers insist on leaving way too
much room for negotiation in their prices because they “know” that buyers
never pay full asking price. Sound familiar?
Unfortunately, this practice becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. When buyers
who know property values make an offer on a grossly overpriced house, their
initial offering price appears to be much lower than it really is. What goes
around, comes around.
For example, suppose that your house’s FMV is $200,000. You put it on the
market at $240,000 to give yourself a 20-percent negotiating cushion. A buyer
offers you $160,000 for the exact same reason. You and the buyer start out
$80,000 apart. You must do a heap of negotiating to bridge a gap that 
enormous.
Real buyers don’t play this game. They make an offer at the low end of your
house’s FMV and see how you respond. If you refuse to accept facts about
recent comparable sales in your neighborhood, real buyers don’t waste time
trying to educate you. Instead, they take the path of least resistance and move
on to find a real seller. If you keep receiving lowball offers, you probably have
too much room to negotiate in your asking price.
240
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Another possibility is that your asking price was close to FMV when you 
initially put the property on the market. However, in a weak market, prices
keep declining. If your house has been for sale for months and the only offer
you’ve gotten appears to be a lowball, have your agent review all recent sale
prices of comparable houses before rejecting the offer. If prices are dropping
like boulders, that “lowball” offer may be worth pursuing.
Considering other offers usually 
made in weak markets
When mortgage money is cheap and plentiful, deals are straightforward and
simple. Buyers make cash down payments and get loans for the balance of
the purchase price. Sellers use the proceeds from their sales to buy new
homes.
However, when mortgage interest rates soared to more than 18 percent in the
early 1980s, house sales activity plummeted. Buyers and sellers did some
pretty unconventional maneuvering to transfer properties. Desperate times
produce desperate measures.
When times get tough, unconventional purchasing techniques breed like bun-
nies. These next two offers don’t come from The Godfather. If you need to sell
your house pronto, you can (and should) refuse them. But, under certain cir-
cumstances, the offers in the next two sections may make sense for you.
Lease-options
A lease-option is exactly what the name implies: a rental agreement to lease
your house but with an option to buy the house in the future. Lease-option
offers are triggered by high mortgage rates or are made by folks who have
good incomes but haven’t managed to save enough cash yet to make a down
payment.
If you must sell your house quickly to get the cash you need to buy a new
home, read no further. A lease-option is too iffy. The house may or may not
sell sometime during the lease’s term, depending on whether the renter
elects to exercise the option to purchase.
Sometimes, however, a lease-option is the smart way to go. For example, sup-
pose that high mortgage rates or a sluggish local real estate market make sell-
ing your house tough. If you don’t need to sell right away and you must move
soon, doing a lease-option helps you cover the house’s monthly ownership
expenses until mortgage rates or the local market improves enough for you
to sell.
241
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

A lease-option is actually two contracts rolled into one. Here’s how it works:
 Lease: The lease differs from a standard rental contract in several ways.
First of all, the lease has an option giving the renter a right to purchase
your house anytime during the lease’s term. Second, the renter pays you
a one-time fee called consideration in addition to the usual first and last
month’s rent plus security deposit. You get the consideration in return
for providing an option to purchase. If the renter exercises the option,
the consideration is credited toward the renter’s down payment. Last, but
not least, some of the rent usually is applied toward the down payment.
 Purchase contract: Attached to the lease is a contract that specifies the
price and terms of sale if the renter opts to exercise the option to pur-
chase. What’s tricky about the purchase agreement is figuring out a 
purchase price that’s fair for you and the buyer six months or a year
down the road when the buyer may exercise the option.
A lease-option is more complex than a regular sale because in addition to
negotiating the future purchase’s price and terms, you also have to negotiate
the following:
 Option consideration: No standard fee exists for option consideration.
This fee is totally negotiable based on the amount you’re willing to accept
and the renter is willing to pay for an option to purchase your house.
 Rent: The house’s rental value is usually easy to establish. If you and your
agent don’t know rental values, get help from an agent who specializes 
in rentals.
 Amount of rent applied toward the down payment: A lease-option’s
rent usually is higher than the market rental value of a house because
lease-option rent also is used as a forced savings plan.
For example, suppose that your house’s normal rental value is $750 a month,
and the renter agrees to pay you a $5,000 consideration for the option to pur-
chase. Your lease-option contract stipulates that the buyer pays a $1,000-
per-month rent, $300 of which goes toward a down payment. If the renter exer-
cises the option after 10 months, you credit the renter $8,000 ($5,000 option
consideration plus $300 a month for 10 months) toward the down payment.
However, if the renter allows the option to lapse without exercising it, you
keep the option consideration money and all the rent money.
Before you agree to a lease-option contract, consider the reason that the renter
is willing to leave $8,000 on the table by failing to exercise the option. Maybe
mortgage rates remain high and the renter can’t qualify for the loan needed
to buy your house. Perhaps the renter can’t save enough additional cash for
the down payment. Or, perchance, property values have plummeted, and
242
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

your house isn’t worth the amount the renter would have to pay for it if the
option is exercised. Under those circumstances, walking away from $8,000 is
cheaper than paying what, with 20/20 hindsight, turns out to be a grossly
inflated purchase price for your house.
Determining your house’s value in six months, a year, or whenever the renter
exercises the option is the trickiest part of the deal. House prices go down —
and up. If property values skyrocket during the term of the lease, your house
may end up being worth much more than the amount you’d receive under
the terms of your lease-option contract. Unforeseen fluctuations in property
value make lease-options tricky for sellers as well as buyers.
The longer the term of the option, the greater the risk of dramatic swings in
property value.
Nothing down
Creative financing was born of dire necessity in the early 1980s, when interest
rates were pushed to all-time highs by the Federal Reserve Board in an effort
to stifle raging inflation. When mortgage rates hit 18 percent, only people
who weren’t borrowing much in relation to their incomes could qualify for
conventional financing.
Ordinary mortals glued deals together by assuming the existing, lower-interest-
rate loans on properties and using seller financing to bridge any gap between
their down payments plus assumed loan amounts and the purchase prices.
We cover seller financing in Chapter 4, if you’re interested (pun intended).
The Frankenstein monster of creative financing is selling property to buyers
who don’t pay one red cent of down payment. Unfortunately, the nothing-down
advocates didn’t all go out of business when interest rates dropped back to
normal. Some of these hucksters still peddle their seminars and how-to books
to desperate buyers and vultures eager to learn new ways to fleece suckers.
Making nothing-down deals with unscrupulous, deadbeat “buyers” means they
may live in your house rent-free for months while thumbing their noses at you
as you go through the expensive, time-consuming foreclosure process. If well-
intentioned but overextended nothing-down buyers fail to make their loan pay-
ments or pay the property taxes, you’ll also be forced to foreclose. Buyers who
have no financial stake in a property can walk away from it whenever they
please and stick you with the mess. Nothing-down deals don’t have an upside;
they’re financial suicide for sellers. Do not, under any circumstances, get into 
a nothing-down deal!
As we discuss in Chapter 4, you may consider helping to finance the sale of
your property. But get a decent down payment from the buyer, in addition to
checking him or her out thoroughly.
243
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

Negotiating credits in escrow
In a really rotten market, even putting a “let’s sell it” price on your house may
not be enough incentive to get the property sold. You may have to sweeten the
deal by offering a buyer money in the form of seller-paid financial concessions.
The two most common financial concessions are for nonrecurring closing costs
and corrective work.
Nonrecurring closing costs
Nonrecurring closing costs are one-time charges that a buyer incurs for such
expenses as the loan appraisal, loan points, credit report, title insurance, and
property inspections. This amount can be major money. Closing costs can total
3 percent to 5 percent of the purchase price.
Some sellers come right out and tell buyers that they’ll pay a portion or even
all the nonrecurring closing costs to put a deal together. And, believe it or not,
sometimes paying a buyer’s nonrecurring closing costs is more effective than
reducing your asking price by the exact same amount of money.
Even if you don’t offer to pay their nonrecurring closing costs, some buyers
may ask for this concession as one of the terms in their offers. Getting this
request is highly unlikely in a sellers’ market or if you’re in a multiple-offer
situation.
A credit to the buyer for nonrecurring closing costs works like this. Suppose
that you recently ratified a contract to sell your house for $250,000. Your
prospective buyer has $57,000 in cash for the purchase — enough, the buyer
thought, to make a 20-percent down payment $50,000) plus $7,000 to cover
the closing costs.
Much to the buyer’s horror, the escrow officer says the nonrecurring closing
costs total $10,000. Because only $7,000 was allocated for these fees, the
buyer is $3,000 short of the total needed to buy your house.
About now, you may wonder, “What’s the big deal? Why not just reduce the
purchase price to $247,000 instead of giving the buyer a $3,000 credit?” After
all, your net proceeds of sale are the same either way, and reducing the pur-
chase price is much less complicated. Furthermore, if property taxes in your
area are based on a percentage of the purchase price, lowering the purchase
price cuts the buyers’ annual tax bite.
244
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Surprise. Assuming that your buyer is short of cash (as most buyers are) and
has no rich relatives or pals to tap for a loan, a credit is much better for the
buyer than a price reduction. Here’s why.
Suppose that that you drop the house’s price to $247,000. A 20-percent down
payment at the new price comes to $49,400. But if closing costs are $10,000,
the buyer has only $47,000 left for the down payment. Even with a $3,000 price
reduction, the buyer is $2,400 short of the amount needed for a 20-percent
down payment.
If the buyer puts less than 20 percent down, the monthly loan costs signifi-
cantly increase because the buyer must pay a higher interest rate on the
mortgage plus private mortgage insurance costs. Under these circumstances,
prudent buyers may decide to kill the deal and buy a less-expensive house.
Contrast the price-reduction scenario with one where the buyer pays
$250,000 for the house and gets a $3,000 credit from you at closing for the
nonrecurring closing costs. After putting 20 percent $50,000) cash down to
get the lowest interest rate loan, the buyer uses the remaining $7,000 plus
your $3,000 credit to pay closing costs. Your credit makes the deal happen.
As an alternative to paying closing costs for your buyer, ask the buyer to check
with the mortgage lender to see whether the lender will cut or eliminate the
loan origination fee (points) if the buyer agrees to pay a slightly higher interest
rate. This approach may reduce the buyer’s total closing costs enough to 
eliminate the need for a credit from you for nonrecurring closing costs.
In many communities, the lower the purchase price is, the lower the annual
property taxes are. For that reason, buyers with plenty of cash go for a price
reduction instead of a credit. Some agents, however, may lobby for a credit
because cutting the price also cuts their commissions. That kind of thinking
is bad for your bottom line.
Corrective work
Typically, at the time the buyer submits an offer, neither you nor the buyer
knows whether your property needs any corrective work. That uncertainty 
is why contracts usually have provisions for additional negotiations regarding
credits for repairs after the necessary inspections are complete.
If property inspectors find that the property requires little or no corrective
work, you and the buyer have little or nothing to negotiate. However, the
inspectors may discover that your $200,000 house needs $20,000 of corrective
work for termite and dry-rot damage plus major foundation repairs. Big 
corrective work bills can be deal killers.
245
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

Seeing is believing. We recommend that your agent (or you, if you’re selling
the property by yourself) be present during every property inspection so that
you get firsthand reports about any damage that the inspector discovers. The
buyer should also give you copies of any and all inspection reports for your
review before you meet with them to negotiate a corrective work credit.
This is the moment of truth in most house sales. Buyers don’t want to pay for
corrective work; neither do sellers. Your deal will fall through if you and the
buyer can’t resolve this impasse.
Pricing your house is one time when knowing everything about comparable
houses that have sold in your area is critically important. Determining who
pays for corrective work is the other time when you must know comparable
sales data. If you heed our advice in Chapter 7 and hire an agent who knows
neighborhood property values, your agent can forcefully present facts regard-
ing the physical condition and terms of sale of other, supposedly comparable,
properties during corrective work negotiations with the buyer and his or 
her agent.
For example, suppose that your agent’s property analysis establishes, beyond
any shadow of a doubt, that houses comparable to yours with no termite or
dry-rot damage and foundations that make the Rock of Gibraltar look like mush
are selling for $200,000. Because your house needs $20,000 of corrective work,
it’s worth only $180,000 in its present condition.
At this point in the negotiations, it’s critically important that you accept the
fact that your house’s value has just been slashed by the cost required to
repair it. Don’t go into denial. You must face the facts. Remember: Good
negotiators are realistic.
You have other options for resolving the impasse. For example, you can refuse
to pay for repairs found by the buyer’s inspectors. You have the right to ques-
tion the impartiality of the buyer’s inspectors and the validity of inspection
reports for which the buyer paid. If these issues concern you, consider getting
your own inspections to refute those of the buyer. Realize, however, that a
good inspection will probably set you back several hundred dollars, and your
inspectors may end up verifying the buyer’s inspector’s results or, worse yet,
discovering additional corrective work.
As a last resort, you can threaten to pull out of the deal if the buyer doesn’t
back off on the demands. In a strong market, this strategy may work. However,
sellers who kill the messenger often regret their decisions. Buyers don’t bring
the damage with them, and, unfortunately for you, buyers won’t take the
damage with them when you kick them out of the deal. Like it or not, you’re
stuck with the damage.
246
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

As we point out in Chapter 8, even if you drive away buyers who discover
damage to your house, you still may have a legal obligation to tell other buyers
everything that you learn about the required corrective work. Any such disclo-
sure will probably lower the price that a future buyer offers for your house. 
All things considered, working things out with the buyer who uncovers the
damage is certainly much faster and probably no more expensive than waiting
for another buyer.
Lenders also participate in corrective work problems. They get copies of
inspection reports if borrowers tell them that a serious repair problem exists,
if their appraisal indicates property obviously needs major repairs, or if the
contract contains a credit for extensive repairs.
You can solve repair problems in a variety of ways:
 Ideally, you leave money for repairs in escrow and instruct the
escrow officer to pay contractors as they complete the work. This
approach offers several advantages. You avoid the dust and disruption
of having work done while you’re still living in the house. Plus, you don’t
incur liability for the workmanship. Let the buyer supervise the repairs
to be sure that the work is done properly by contractors that the buyer
chooses. Last, but not least, the lender knows that the property will be
restored to pristine condition, which enhances its loan value.
 Alternatively, the lender withholds a portion of the full loan amount 
in an interest-bearing savings account until the corrective work is 
complete. In cases involving major corrective work, the lender may 
refuse to fund the entire loan amount until the problems are corrected.
 You credit the buyers directly for corrective work at the close of
escrow. Lenders usually don’t approve of this approach, because it
raises uncertainties about whether the corrective work will actually be
completed. If it isn’t, the security of the lender’s loan is impaired.
Join with your buyer in obtaining competitive bids on the repair work
from several reputable licensed contractors. Use bids to establish the
amount of the corrective work credit. This approach doesn’t bother
good buyers. They don’t want to get rich from your misfortune. All they
want is what they thought they were buying in the first place — a well-
maintained house without termite or dry-rot problems and with a good
foundation.
Distinguishing Real Buyers from Fakes
Fake buyers don’t lie in wait like tigers itching to dig their claws into you for
the thrill of killing your deal. The very thought that people would knowingly
waste their time and money on an exercise in futility is ludicrous.
247
Chapter 14: Negotiating Strategies for Sellers

The key word is knowingly. All buyers start out thinking that they’re sincere.
As their quest for a house continues, however, circumstances ultimately
prove that some are phony.
Fake buyers usually mimic genuine buyers very cleverly (so cleverly, in fact,
they often fool themselves for quite some time). Like real buyers, counterfeit
buyers may have agents, read ads about houses for sale, and go to Sunday
open houses. They outwardly appear to be the real McCoy. If you (and your
listing agent, if you’re using one) don’t know how to detect fake buyers, you
end up wasting time, energy, and money fruitlessly negotiating to sell your
house to less-than-genuine prospects.
Identifying bogus buyers is easy if you know how. The following sections
include five tests that you can use to spot the fakes.
Are the buyers creditworthy?
Real buyers are ready, willing, and financially able to purchase. Having two 
out of three of these attributes isn’t good enough. When so-called buyers don’t
satisfy all three criteria, they’re phonies, regardless of whether they realize it.
Genuine buyers want you to know that they’re creditworthy. That’s why they’re
willing to share important aspects of their financial situation at the time they
present you with their offers, and perhaps even get preapproved or prequali-
fied for a loan. In a strong local real estate market, smart, serious buyers seek
preapproval or prequalification before making an offer.
People who make the offer to purchase your house subject to selling their
present homes (which they haven’t yet put on the market) are fakes — don’t
dignify their pseudo-offer with a response.
Are the buyers realistic?
Real buyers familiarize themselves with property values and market conditions
before making an offer to purchase. They, and their agents, use sale prices 
of houses comparable to yours in price, age, size, condition, and location to
establish the FMV of your house. They know the difference between fairly
priced properties and overpriced turkeys.
Real buyers may offer less than your asking price because they expect to
negotiate prices and terms of sale. However, legitimate buyers who are willing
to pay you the amount your house is worth don’t make a ludicrously low offer
on your house if it’s priced to sell. Genuine buyers understand the 
concept of FMV.
248
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Are the buyers motivated?
People don’t buy houses to generate commissions for real estate agents.
Buyers often are motivated by a life change, such as wedding bells, a job
transfer, family expansion, retirement, or a death in the family.
Lack of motivation almost always is a red flag. Establish the buyers’ motiva-
tion when you receive an offer. When buyers tell you that they’re just testing
the market, run as fast as you can in the opposite direction.
Do the buyers have a time frame?
Buyer deadlines are established by such factors as when they have to begin
new jobs in another city, when the twins are due, when school starts, when
the escrow is due to close on the house that they’re selling, and so on. Bona
fide buyers almost always have a time frame within which they must act.
Time is a powerful negotiating tool. If you’re under pressure to sell because
you just got a promotion that forces you to move to another state next month
and the buyer doesn’t have a deadline to purchase, time is your enemy and
the buyer’s pal. Conversely, if the buyer sold a house in June, and desperately
needs to settle into a new home before school starts in September, the watch
is on the other wrist. Ideally, you know the buyer’s deadline, but the buyer
doesn’t know yours. Most real negotiation occurs near the very end of a
deadline.
If the buyer doesn’t have a deadline, but discovers that you have one, the
buyer can use your deadline to beat you to a pulp. Watch out for buyer pro-
crastination. Don’t let time bully you — and keep your deadlines to yourself.
Are the buyers cooperative?
Real buyers look for ways to make deals go smoothly. They work with you 
to solve problems instead of creating problems and finding excuses to make
the transaction more difficult. Genuine buyers have a let’s-make-it-happen
attitude. They’re deal makers, not deal breakers.
Inconsistent behavior is a red flag. When buyers suddenly start missing con-
tract deadlines or become strangely uncooperative, they may have lost their
motivation. Perhaps the blushing bride-to-be decided to call the wedding off,
or the “sure-thing” promotion wasn’t so certain. Whatever. People can and do
switch from being real buyers to fakes in mid-transaction. Find out why
buyers are acting strangely as soon as you notice changes, and you may be
able to head off the problem. If you ignore danger signs, you’ll never know
what hit you if the sale blows up in your face.

It Ain’t Over ‘til the Check Clears
In This Chapter
 Discovering the ins and outs of escrows
 Saying goodbye to your house
 Coping with seller’s and buyer’s remorse
A
fter sprucing up the old place, sorting through hordes of prospects to 
find the most ready, willing, and able buyer, and haggling over price and
terms, you finally signed a contract for the sale of your house. Are your trou-
bles over? Have you sold your house at last? Nope. You’ve only ratified (signed)
an offer. You can’t start packing your bags yet. You have a lot of work to do
before the sale is a done deal. This chapter can help.
Entering the Neutral Territory 
of an Escrow
You may be delighted to know that escrow has nothing to do with snails.
Escrow refers to the holding of important documents and money related to
the sale of your house.
After the offer is ratified, you need someone you can trust to hold the 
stakes while you and the buyer take care of unresolved contract details, such
as arranging property inspections and getting financing for the purchase. On
the first business day after you and the buyer sign the contract, either you 
or the buyer (or your agent or the buyer’s agent, if agents are involved) open
an escrow. This process happens by delivering all the funds and documents
related to your sale to a neutral third party — the escrow holder (also called 
an escrow officer).

In accordance with instructions from you and the buyer, the escrow officer
keeps these funds and documents in an escrow file created especially for your
transaction. Depending on real estate practices in your area, your escrow may
be handled by a lawyer, a firm that specializes in doing escrows, or a title com-
pany. Sellers and buyers usually select an escrow holder based on their agents’
recommendations.
Based on your house’s sale price, escrow fees can run from a couple of hun-
dred dollars to several thousand dollars. Brokerage customs where the prop-
erty is located usually dictate whether you or the buyer pay for the escrow, 
or you split the fee 50/50 with the buyer. Regardless of custom or practice,
responsibility for the payment of escrow fees is a negotiable item. In a strong
seller’s market, for example, buyers may offer to pay for the escrow to sweeten
their offers, even though local custom decrees that buyers and sellers usually
split escrow costs.
Understanding the role 
of the escrow officer
Even though you went through the escrow process when you bought your
house, you may not remember much about it. After a few years, the whole
experience probably seems like nothing more than a big, expensive blur. 
But even if you purchased your house just last year, going through escrow is
much different from the perspective of a seller. Rather than putting money 
into escrow to obtain title to the property, you’re getting money out of escrow
in return for relinquishing your ownership by transferring legal title to the 
new owner.
The escrow officer handles the nitty-gritty paperwork details so you can con-
centrate on the deal. To that end, here are some highlights from your escrow
officer’s to-do list:
 Order a title search from the title company: Soon after the escrow is
opened, you and the buyers get copies of a preliminary report (prelim)
showing who legally owns the property. The prelim also contains a list 
of items (such as loans secured by the property or public utility com-
pany easements to run power lines over the property) that affect the
title or limit use of your property.
Look over the preliminary report carefully. Ask your agent, escrow 
officer, title company representative, or lawyer to explain anything in the
report that you don’t understand. Don’t be shy — there’s no such thing
as a dumb question.
 Request payoff information: If you have a mortgage, home equity loan,
or other liens on the property, your escrow officer contacts the lenders
to get your current loan balances and instructions for paying off the 
various loans at close of escrow.
252
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

 Prepare and record documents: The escrow officer draws up a grant
deed that you sign to formally transfer legal title to the buyer. The deed
is recorded when escrow closes.
An escrow officer’s job is to receive and follow your instructions. Be
sure to instruct your escrow officer not to give the buyer the title to your
property until you’re completely satisfied that all terms and conditions
of the contract are fulfilled.
 Hold and disburse funds: Easy come, easy go. At close of escrow, the
escrow officer uses funds the buyers and their lender put into escrow 
to make payments required to close the escrow, such as paying off your
old loans.
If you don’t have a Social Security number and your property’s gross sale
price exceeds $300,000, your escrow officer may have to withhold up to 
10 percent of the gross sale price to comply with the Foreign Investment
In Real Property Tax Act (FIRPTA). This act is an IRS code requirement
pertaining to potential capital gains tax liability. See a tax advisor if you
need more details.
253
Chapter 15: It Ain't Over 'til the Check Clears
Defining encumbrances
Encumbrances are another person’s or institu-
tion’s rights to or interests in your property.
Encumbrances either place limits on the use of
your property or affect its legal title. Two kinds
of encumbrances are possible — money and
nonmoney.
Money encumbrances, called liens, use prop-
erty as security for repayment of a debt. For
example, when you obtained a mortgage to buy
your house, you gave the lender the right to
foreclose on your property if you failed to pay
back the loan. Your lender made the lien a
matter of public record by recording a docu-
ment containing the lien information in your
local County Recorder’s office. Property tax
liens, state and federal income tax liens, and
court-imposed judgments or attachments are
other examples of money encumbrances.
One type of nonmoney encumbrance is an
easement. You’ve probably given an easement
to your local public utility to string power lines
over your land and another easement to the city
to run water or sewer lines through your prop-
erty. Condominium covenants, conditions, and
restrictions (CC&Rs) are another example of
nonmoney encumbrances.
Buyers have the right to review and approve the
preliminary report. If your buyer reasonably
objects to certain items shown on the prelim,
the escrow officer works with you to remove
the offending encumbrances prior to close of
escrow. If you can’t clear them from the prop-
erty, your deal may fall through.
For example, asking you to pay off all debts
secured by liens and judgments against the
property is reasonable. If, however, you’re sell-
ing a condo, asking you to remove the CC&Rs
on your condo is unreasonable because CC&Rs
are an integral part of the property. Should you
have questions regarding the reasonableness
of a request to remove an encumbrance, get a
legal opinion on the issue from your attorney.

 Prepare estimated and final closing statements: These documents 
provide an accounting of all the money that comes into and goes out of
your escrow.
Maximizing your escrow
If you want to eliminate escrow problems before they occur, call or visit your
escrow officer as soon as possible to introduce yourself. See if the escrow
officer needs any information from you to make the escrow go faster and
smoother. In addition to finding out how to contact you during the day, the
escrow officer may need the following:
 A Statement of Information: If you have a common name (such as 
Adams, Brown, Chan, Davis, Garcia, Jones, Lee, Miller, Nguyen, Smith, or
Williams), you must complete a Statement of Information. Many title prob-
lems are caused by people with names similar (or identical) to yours. A
Statement of Information helps to distinguish you from the scores of other
folks with common names like yours.
What information is requested in a Statement of Information? You 
(and your spouse if you’re married) must provide your full name, Social
Security number, exact date of birth, birthplace, date and place of mar-
riage (if applicable), previous marriages (if applicable), residence and
employment information, and so on. Whatever is necessary to prove 
precisely who you are — and who you aren’t.
 Bills and documents: You can speed up the information gathering
process by giving your escrow officer copies of your most recent mort-
gage statement, property tax bill, and, if you’re a condo or co-op owner,
copies of the current homeowners’ association dues and assessments.
Getting an estimated closing statement
During your initial contact with the escrow officer, request an estimated closing
statement based strictly on your known closing costs at that time and assum-
ing the escrow closes as scheduled. This statement obviously won’t be precise.
Factors such as whether you’ll have to give the buyers a credit for repairs, and
if so, how much, have yet to be determined. No matter. At least you have an
approximation of your expenses of sale, and that helps you develop a rough
idea about the amount of money you may have to spend on your next home.
Get the estimated closing statement updated a week before scheduled close
of escrow. At that point, very few questions should remain. You’re basically
waiting for the clock to tick out. Check your second estimated closing state-
ment extremely carefully, line by line from top to bottom, to be absolutely 
certain that it accurately reflects your credits and debits.
254
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Escrow officers are human. They sometimes make mistakes. So do other par-
ties in the transaction who may inadvertently give the escrow officer incorrect
information. And when mistakes are found, whose favor do you think they are
in? Probably not yours! Your money is on the table. Pay attention to details.
Review the closing statement and question anything that isn’t clear or correct.
Summing up your final closing statement
You may think that the most valuable piece of paper that you get when escrow
closes is your check for the proceeds of sale. From an accounting standpoint,
however, the most precious piece of paper is the final closing statement. If you
think of the escrow as a checking account, the final closing statement is your
checkbook. It records all the money related to your transaction either as 
credits or debits.
Any money that you receive in escrow is shown as a credit to your account.
You won’t have many credits; the biggie is always your credit for the amount 
of the sale price. You may get a credit from the buyers for the unused portion
of property taxes that you prepaid. You get a check outside of escrow from
your insurance company for any unused portion of your homeowners insur-
ance premium. By the same token, if your lender collects extra money from 
you each month that goes into an impound account used to pay your property
taxes and homeowners insurance premiums, any excess funds in the impound
account are paid directly to you by the lender after the sale closes.
Debits are funds paid out of escrow on your behalf. Your biggest debit, as
noted in Chapter 3, is usually the mortgage payoff. Other major closing costs
listed as debits are the real estate commission, local transfer taxes, any correc-
tive work credits that you give the buyer, and, depending on the date the sale
closes, a credit to the buyer for your share of unpaid property taxes. The list
also includes an assortment of small charges for notary fees, recording fees,
document preparation fees, messenger fees, and so on.
The final closing statement is extremely important. Be sure to keep a copy 
for your files; you may need to refer to it when you prepare your income tax
return. As Chapter 16 explains, some expenses of sale, such as the real estate
commission, mortgage prepayment penalties, and property tax payments, are
tax deductible. Furthermore, you may owe capital gains tax on a portion of
your profit from selling the property.
Resolving disputes
Good escrow officers are worth their weight in gold in times of crisis when the
shouting, tears, and threats of lawsuits begin. At moments like this, often only
their incredible patience and crisis-mediation skills keep deals glued together.
With luck, your escrow will be as smooth as silk from inception to close. But if
an escrow officer gets conflicting instructions from the seller and the buyer, the
escrow slams to a screeching halt until the parties resolve the problem.
255
Chapter 15: It Ain't Over 'til the Check Clears

What kind of conflicting instructions are possible? The conflict usually is a dis-
pute between the seller and the buyer about whether some item of personal
property (such as a refrigerator, fireplace screen, mirror, or light fixture) is
included in the sale. Another classic point of contention is whether corrective
work should be done before or after close of escrow.
A wise real estate attorney, Kip Oxman, has a saying that works miracles 
in dispute resolution situations: “When all else fails, RTC.” You can find the
answer to most disagreements if you Read The Contract. The real estate pur-
chase contract included in Appendix A is an example of an extremely explicit
contract intended to eliminate the ambiguity that creates disputes.
Avoiding the curse of December escrows
Escrows are perverse creatures under the best of circumstances. They’re proof
positive of Murphy’s Law, which states that whatever can go wrong will — 
and always at the worst possible time. Experienced escrow officers are all too
aware that nasty surprises can and often do rear their ugly heads whenever
you least expect them.
What kind of surprises? The list is unpleasantly long — missed deadlines,
title glitches, problems paying off existing loans, changes in the buyer’s loan
terms, insufficient funds to close escrow, and the like.
December escrows are notoriously perverse. Holiday partying saps people’s
strength and reduces their effectiveness. Folks forget to sign papers before
going on vacation, and December 31 is an absolute deadline if you must close
this year for tax purposes.
If you end up with a December escrow, make sure that you meet your deadline
by following these tips:
 Stay in touch with your escrow officer. Don’t let your file get buried 
in a pile of pending escrows on the corner of your escrow officer’s desk.
You or your agent should check with the escrow officer every few days
to make sure that everything is going smoothly.
 Order loan demands as soon as possible. You must pay off any of your
existing loans that are secured by the property before the buyer can have
a new mortgage put on the property. Instruct your escrow officer to order
payoff statements on all your existing loans immediately.
Lack of receipt of loan payoff statements is the single biggest cause 
of escrow delays.
256
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

 If you’re leaving town for the holidays, tell your agent and escrow
officer well in advance of your departure. Special arrangements can
usually be made to close your escrow — no matter where you are — if
people have advance warning and know how to reach you. The key to
success is keeping everyone informed.
 Check the calendar. Many offices stay open only until noon on Christmas
Eve and New Year’s Eve. When Christmas and New Year’s Day fall on
Saturday or Sunday, office hours get extra crazy. Some businesses and
public offices close the preceding Friday, others close the following
Monday, and still others close Friday and Monday to give their employees
a four-day holiday. Be sure to check the holiday office schedule of your
agent, escrow officer, and other important people in your transaction.
Don’t let a holiday office-closing derail your deal.
 Allow time between the date you want to close and the date you must
close. Give yourself maneuvering room to resolve last-minute problems
that inevitably appear when you least expect them. Don’t schedule your
closing on the last business day of the year. You’ll have no margin for
error if you need to close by year’s end.
Some deals fall through needlessly. These escrows could’ve been saved by
applying a basic principle of winning golf — follow-through. Golf pros know
that there’s more to the game than simply making contact with the ball. Pros
continue their swing “through the ball” after they hit it because they know
that the last part of the stroke is as important as initial contact with the ball.
If they don’t follow through, the ball won’t end up where they want it to go.
Your house isn’t sold until your escrow closes. Follow-through is equally
important in real estate deals. Buyers, sellers, and agents often carelessly say
that a house has been sold as soon as the purchase contract is signed. That
kind of foggy thinking can sink your transaction. You and the buyers have only
ratified an offer at that point.
Letting Go of Your House
The day escrow closes is legally confusing. You still own your house when the
day begins at 12:01 a.m., but you aren’t the owner of record when the day ends
at midnight. Sometime during the day, the escrow officer notifies the buyer that
the deed has been recorded, officially announces that the buyer is now the
proud owner of your house, and, of course, gives you the money you’re owed
from the sale proceeds. Your sale is a done deal. Congrats!
But in all the excitement, don’t forget that you have to bid adieu to your
house. This section helps you do that.
257
Chapter 15: It Ain't Over 'til the Check Clears

Moving daze
If you’re one of the fortunate few, moving day won’t be a problem because
the place you’re moving into will be vacated long before your escrow is
scheduled to close. Lucky you. Life is sweet.
Moving day is considerably more treacherous if, like most sellers, you’re
involved in a daisy chain of concurrent transactions — selling your old house
and simultaneously buying a new home from people who are also buying a 
new home for themselves, and so on like an endless hall of mirrors. In that
case, your move’s timing is just a tad less complex than the D-Day landings in
Normandy during World War II. You may find yourself living on the street if you
give up possession of the house you’re selling before you can move into your
next home. Don’t worry. Millions of folks have coordinated sell-buy moves
without a hitch. The secrets of success are lead time and planning.
The date the buyer actually takes possession of and moves into your house
depends on the terms of your contract. Look at paragraph 3 of the sample pur-
chase contract in Appendix A to see an example of a “Closing and Occupancy”
clause that’s used to specify date and time of possession and delivery of keys
from seller to buyer. The next sections cover the usual options.
Buyer moves in the same day escrow closes
Same day move-in is fine if you’re absolutely, utterly, positively, beyond-
a-shadow-of-a-doubt certain of two factors:
 The escrow has closed on the house that you’re selling.
 Your next home is vacant so you can move right into it — if you intend
to move directly from your old house into the new home you’re buying.
If the closing of your escrow is delayed or the seller of the house that you’re
buying can’t vacate the place, you have a logistical problem. For two moving
vans to occupy exactly the same driveway at exactly the same time borders on
the impossible. Moving into a house while someone else is moving out is some-
thing you’ll never attempt more than once. There are easier ways to go crazy.
If you can’t move into your new home until the sellers vacate it, you must track
three escrows: the escrow of the house you’re selling, the escrow of the home
you’re buying, and the escrow of the new home for the people whose house
you’re buying. You need as much advance warning as possible from the sellers
of your new home if they run into problems that can possibly delay the close of
escrow on your new home. With adequate lead time, you can adjust the close
of escrow on the house you’re selling accordingly.
258
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

Buyer moves in the day after escrow closes
We recommend that the buyer move in the day after escrow closes because
you can be certain that escrow closed. After all, you’re still the owner until the
title transfers. Moving day is stressful, even under the best of circumstances.
Why create unnecessary stress for yourself by trying to move out while the
buyer moves in? The sellers of your new home may use the day your mutual
escrow closes to move out and then you can move in the following day.
Regardless of whether you move out of your house the day that escrow closes
or the following day, make cancellation of your homeowners insurance, utili-
ties, and phone service effective one day after your scheduled close of escrow
and move. Carefully coordinate canceling your homeowners insurance policy
with your insurance agent to avoid any gaps in your coverage.
Buyer moves in after a seller rent-back
Sellers sometimes stay in their houses several weeks after escrow closes 
while waiting to get into their new home. If this situation happens to you, you
sign a separate rent-back agreement that becomes part of your purchase con-
tract with the buyer. The rent-back agreement covers who pays for utilities and
maintenance, what happens if property damage occurs after escrow closes,
how much rent you must pay the buyers, and what penalties result if you don’t
vacate the house by the date specified in your agreement.
Sellers customarily pay rent equal to the amount the buyers must pay for
Principal and Interest on their mortgage plus property Taxes and Insurance, so
they break even on the cost of owning the house during the term of your rental.
PITI, as this sum is known, is prorated on a per-day basis from close of escrow
until you vacate the property.
For example, suppose that PITI is $50 per day, and you expect to be out three
weeks after escrow closes. You and the buyer instruct the escrow officer to
hold four weeks PITI in escrow so each of you has a cushion if you encounter
an additional delay moving into your new home. When you move, you and
the buyer jointly instruct the escrow officer to pay the buyer $50 per day for
the actual rental period and to refund the unused portion of PITI funds held
in escrow to you.
Don’t let the buyers do any work on your house or, worse yet, move into the
house prior to close of escrow. If you vacate your house prior to the close, 
the buyers may ask your permission to start fixing the house up before close 
of escrow. After all, painting or waxing floors, for example, is much easier and
faster if the house is empty. Don’t do it! The buyers may poke around and find 
a molehill that they turn into a mountain of trouble for you. If the deal falls
through, you may get your house back in terrible condition. If the house
catches fire, your insurance may not cover the losses. No matter how 
piteously they plead, be firm.
259
Chapter 15: It Ain't Over 'til the Check Clears

The final verification of condition
A smart buyer inspects the property a few days (ideally the day) before escrow
closes. Why? To be sure that your property still is in the same general condi-
tion that it was in when the buyer signed the contract to buy it. That’s why
most residential real estate contracts contain a clause similar to Paragraph 15
of the C.A.R. purchase contract in Appendix A — the “Final Verification of
Condition” clause.
If the buyer discovers that your living room picture window fractured during
your going-away party, a giant sinkhole suddenly appeared last week in the
middle of your driveway, and 200 fresh gopher holes emerged in what was a
flawless carpet of velvety grass only yesterday, the buyer can instruct the
escrow officer to stop the escrow until the problems are resolved. If you and
the buyer can’t work out a mutually satisfactory solution, the dispute can kill
the deal.
Be sure to maintain your property inside and out until escrow closes and you
move into your new dream home. Make sure that the movers don’t damage 
the property when removing your belongings. Unless you and the buyer make
other arrangements, your property should be left broom clean, which means 
to remove all garbage, trash, and litter, and then vacuum the carpets and
sweep the floors.
Surviving Seller’s Remorse or (Gasp) 
the Double Whammy
Most house sellers and homebuyers suffer, to greater or lesser degrees, the
ravages of a peculiarly debilitating distress during their transactions and for 
up to six months after their deals close. This masochistic form of self-reproach
has a name. Depending on which side of the contract you happen to be on, it’s
either called seller’s remorse or buyer’s remorse.
Seller’s remorse is a stupendously strong conviction on your part that you’re
about to sell your house for way less than it’s really worth. The fact that your
sale price established a new high for the neighborhood is secondary to your
perception that you’re giving your house away. When you’re in the cruel grip
of seller’s remorse, facts take a back seat to perceptions.
Don’t feel like the Lone Ranger. You’re not alone. The buyers of your house
probably have an equally strong conviction that they’re paying you way more
than your house is worth. Their doubts began when they signed the purchase
contract. Factually speaking, your house could be well worth every cent
they’re paying. That doesn’t matter. Once again, the only thing that counts 
is their perception that they’re overpaying.
260
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

If you’re selling your old house and at the same time buying a new home, 
you are most likely being devastated by the dreaded double whammy —
simultaneous buyer’s and seller’s remorse. In the worst-case remorse sce-
nario, you suspect that you’re getting financially creamed when you sell 
and when you purchase.
All too often these concerns are ignored or ridiculed by agents, friends, 
and family. You’re patted on the head and told, “Don’t worry. Everyone goes
through this. Tough it out. Take two aspirin and get a good night’s sleep. You’ll
be fine tomorrow.” Not true. Unless you get remorse out in the open, it can tear
you and your deals apart.
Confronting your fears
The first step in your recovery program is seeing seller’s or buyer’s remorse
for what it is — plain, unadulterated fear. As a seller, you fear that you under-
valued your property. As a buyer, you fear that you overpaid.
By scrutinizing these hidden fears in the bright light of day, you can counter
them with facts. Maybe you did undervalue your house. Perhaps you are over-
paying for your new dream home. Instead of just wringing your hands and
gnashing your teeth until you worry yourself sick, get the facts about fair
market value (see Chapter 10).
A seller’s fear (giving the house away) is the flip side of a buyer’s fear (over-
paying). For that reason, sellers and buyers end up doing the same things to
squelch their fears and factually establish the fair market value of the property
they’re selling or buying. Regardless of whether you’re zapped by seller’s
remorse or buyer’s remorse, after signing the contract you can
 Discuss your deal with friends, neighbors, business associates, and
folks standing in front of you in the checkout line at the supermarket.
You ask anyone and everyone you can grab if they think that you’re 
getting a good deal. This exercise is only good for venting your fears.
Precisely 99.9999 percent of the people that you talk to won’t have the
faintest idea about fair market value of the property in question.
 Read classified ads in the real estate section of your newspaper even
more intently than you did before you signed the contract. As a seller,
you circle all the ads for houses that aren’t as nice as yours that have
higher asking prices. As a buyer, you circle ads for houses that sound
similar to or nicer than the one you’re buying but that have lower asking
prices.
Keep in mind as you brood over real estate ads that most houses don’t
sell for the asking price. Conversely, most houses read much better than
they eyeball when you tour them.
261
Chapter 15: It Ain't Over 'til the Check Clears

 Spend Saturday and Sunday touring open houses. The streets are filled
with remorseful buyers looking for better deals and remorseful sellers
searching for less-nice properties with higher asking prices. Seeing, after
all, is believing. Touring property is the best way to determine whether
your fears are valid (which is highly unlikely if you follow the advice in
this book) or groundless.
Facing the ultimate test
The faster you get your fears out in the open and confront them with facts, the
less you suffer. Accept the fact that property can have more than one correct
price. Pricing and negotiation are arts, not precise sciences. If you have the
time, energy, and skill to search long enough and negotiate hard enough, you
may find a buyer who’ll pay a little more for the house you’re selling or, con-
versely, a seller who’s willing to accept a slightly lower price for the next home
that you purchase.
Don’t beat yourself up with asking prices. Asking prices are fantasies that
remind us of an old saying: “If pigs had wings, they could fly.” You don’t see
many flocks of pigs in the sky, do you?
Sale prices are facts. You can sleep soundly if the price you received as a seller
or the price you paid as a buyer is in line with the sale prices of comparable
properties.
Knowledge is power. If you follow the principles we cover in this book, you
have nothing to fear. Your knowledge makes you extremely powerful. Get on
with your life and remember — your home is an excellent long-term investment.

Chapter 16
Income Tax Filings after the Sale
In This Chapter
 Understanding your house-sale profits from a tax standpoint
 Managing your state tax filings
You’ve successfully sold your old house and moved into your new dream
home. “At last,” you think to yourself, “I can get on with my life and stop
spending so much of my leisure time on housing decisions, transactions, and
paperwork.”
If the idea sounds too good to be true, it is. Unfortunately, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and most state tax agencies may want to know all about the sale
of your house because you may owe income tax on profits that you receive
from the sale. This chapter helps you square away any tax-related issues you
may encounter when selling your house.
Profits from a House Sale
If you sell your house for a profit, you can legally avoid paying income tax on
that profit as long as you meet certain requirements. Wanna know how? Check
out this section.
Defining profits
Most people sell their houses for more money than they originally paid to
purchase them. The difference between the price you pay to buy a home and
the amount you receive when you sell it is generated by some combination of
two factors:
 Increases in value that have nothing to do with you (the rising tide 
of real estate prices)
 Improvements that you put into the place

Fortunately, the IRS only defines the first factor as potentially taxable profit.
Suppose that you buy a house for $225,000 and sell it ten years later for
$325,000. While you owned the place, you spent $20,000 remodeling the kitchen
and bathroom. According to the IRS, your profit on the sale is $80,000.
Later in the chapter, we get into more of the nitty-gritty details about all the
items that the IRS requires you to consider in calculating your house sale
profits.
Excluding house sale profits from tax
So, you’ve made a profit of $80,000 on the sale of your home (from the preced-
ing section). How much federal income tax do you owe on it? Probably none.
In fact, thanks to the Taxpayer Relief Act passed in 1997, single taxpayers can
realize up to $250,000 and married couples up to $500,000 of profit on a house
sale without having to pay any federal income tax on it. Most people’s house
sale profits fit well under these limits.
As long as the house that you’re selling has been your principal residence 
for at least two of the previous five years, you can take the tax exclusion at
any age and for as many times in your life as you want (but not more than
once every two years). There are no restrictions on what you must do with
the profits; you can trade up, trade down, dump it all in the stock market,
stuff it all under the mattress . . . it’s up to you.
The old rules were much more restrictive: Before, if you were under age 55,
you couldn’t exclude any gain from federal income taxation; you could only
defer it by purchasing a replacement residence that cost at least as much as
the one you sold. If you were older than 55, you could take an exclusion, but
it was only for $125,000 and only a once-in-a-lifetime deal.
Here are some other important rules and insights regarding this terrific 
tax break:
 For a married couple to qualify for the $500,000 exclusion, both spouses
must individually meet the qualifications. That is, each spouse must have
lived in the house for two of the previous five years, and neither spouse
can have taken an exclusion on another house sale during the previous
two years. If only one spouse qualifies, then the couple is allowed only a
$250,000 exclusion.
 If you fail to meet the two-year requirements because of an unexpected move
relating to your job, your health, and so on, you’re still entitled to a prorated
amount of the exclusion based on how much time of the two-year require-
ment you were able to meet. For example, if you’re forced to sell after only
one year and you meet the other requirements of this tax break, you’re 
264
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

entitled to 50 percent of the capital gains exclusion ($125,000 for a single
person and $250,000 for a married couple filing jointly).
 How you hold title to the property affects your capital gain when the
owner dies. If you hold title to your house as a joint tenant with another
person, you get a stepped-up basis for tax purposes on half of the prop-
erty when the other joint tenant dies. If the title to the house is held as
community property, both halves of the house get a stepped-up basis
when one spouse dies. See the glossary and a good tax/legal advisor for
more details.
Tax Filings Required after the Sale
After you sell your house, you don’t need to immediately report the sale to 
the IRS. Rest assured, however, that the IRS knows of the sale because the firm
that handles the closing (typically an escrow company) reports the financial
details of the sale on Form 1099-S, Proceeds From Real Estate Transaction (see
Figure 16-1), if required. You should receive a copy of this form, as well. Form
1099-S must be filed to report the sale of real estate unless the sale price is
less than or equal to $250,000 ($500,000 or less for married couples) and all
the sellers provide written certification that the full gain on the sale isn’t 
subject to taxation.
Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses
When the time comes to file your annual IRS Form 1040, you may need to 
complete Schedule D: Capital Gains and Losses (see Figure 16-2) if you sold your
house. Use Schedule D to report to the IRS that you’ve sold your house and
determine if you owe federal income tax on the profit.

Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

After you’ve calculated your profit on the sale, figuring out how much, if any, 
of that gain is taxable is quite simple, thanks to the capital gains rules for all
houses selling after May 6, 1997. As long as the property has been used and
owned as the sellers’ principal residence for at least two of the five years
before the sale, married couples are allowed to exclude up to $500,000 of 
profits from tax and single taxpayers up to $250,000. If your profits are less
than your allowable exclusion, you owe no federal income tax on the sale.
The following sections walk you through relevant information on the form.
Figuring your taxable gain on sale
The first parts of the calculations are the more difficult. You need to tally 
the expenses involved in selling your house, and you need to determine the
amount that the IRS calls the cost basis of the house. Determining the cost
basis gives many a house seller a headache, because that figure reflects not
only the amount you originally paid for the house but also the money spent
on improvements while you owned the property.

Chapter 16: Income Tax Filings after the Sale

Calculating your gain on the sale, you need to determine two important num-
bers: the expenses of sale and the adjusted cost basis of the house that you sold:
 Expenses of sale: After selling your house, the IRS allows you to deduct
from the selling price certain expenses incurred in the transaction, 
such as
• Real estate agent commissions
• Attorney fees
• Title and escrow fees
• Recording fees
• Advertising expenses
• Buyer’s loan fees
Unfortunately, paying off your outstanding mortgage does not count 
as an expense of sale.
 Adjusted cost basis: For tax purposes, the cost basis of your house
starts with the price you originally paid for it, including certain closing
or escrow costs, which the IRS allows you to add to the purchase price
of the house. During the time you own the house, however, that basis
can change. Home improvements increase your cost basis by the dollar
amount you spend on them.
In the eyes of the IRS, an improvement is anything that increases your
home’s value or prolongs its useful life, such as landscaping, installing 
a new roof, adding rooms, installing a new heating or air conditioning
system, and so on. On the other hand, repairs that simply maintain your
home’s condition — fixing a leaking pipe, repainting, replacing a broken
window, spackling holes in walls and baseboards — aren’t considered
improvements.
Another factor that may affect your cost basis is depreciation taken for
rental or business use of a portion of your property over the years. For
example, if you convert your two-car garage into a tattoo parlor or if
you’re renting a spare room, you can take depreciation on the portion 
of the property devoted to business or rental purposes. Depreciation
reduces your property’s cost basis. (Note: The portion of your property
devoted to business or rental purposes isn’t eligible for the tax deferral
under the primary residence tax deferral rules. See Chapter 18 for 
more details.)
Here’s a simple example to show how the IRS wants you to calculate the 
gain on your house sale. Suppose that you bought your house for $100,000.
Through years of ownership, you spent the following on improvements:
268
Part IV: The Brass Tacks of Getting Your House Sold 

 $6,000 on a new roof
 $2,500 on landscaping
 $1,500 on new electrical wiring
Thus, you raise your cost basis in the property to $110,000.
You sell the house for $200,000. However, after paying real estate commissions
and other expenses of sale, you only receive $180,000. Thus, your profit as
defined by the IRS comes to $180,000 – $110,000 = $70,000.
Understanding exclusion and taxable gain
Taken from the example in the preceding section, a $70,000 profit incurs no
federal income tax, regardless of whether you were single or married. If your
profits are greater than your allowable exclusion, then you pay capital gains
tax on whatever amount exceeds the limit. Say you’re married and the profit
on your house sale is $540,000. You owe tax on $40,000.
The actual rate that you pay on this amount depends on your tax bracket 
and how long you owned the house. However, if you owned the house longer
than 12 months, you pay no higher than 20 percent, which is the maximum
long-term capital gains rate.
State income taxes on housing profits
As most of us are aware, the federal government isn’t the only government
entity that assesses and collects taxes on income (which includes capital
gains) — the vast majority of states do as well. Most states simply use the
same capital gains exclusion rules that the federal government uses. Thus, 
if you don’t owe federal income tax on the sale of your house, you probably
won’t owe state income tax either. Check with your state income tax entity 
or a local tax advisor for more details.

Chapter 17
Ten Things to Do After You Sell
In This Chapter
 Tying up odds and ends
 Organizing your sale and tax documents
 Thinking ahead to your next home purchase
S
elling real estate is stressful. After the ink has dried on the deed and you’ve
dropped your house keys into the hands of the new owners, the thought of
refocusing on your job and other life responsibilities may seem like a tropical
vacation. The last thing you want to do is worry about another real-estate-
related to-do list.
Here’s a carrot to keep you reading: The ten items in this chapter can save
you big money and preserve your peace of mind. So, if you’re looking for an
incentive to get you through some of these loose-end-tying tasks, think about
more cash.
Keep Copies of the Closing 
and Settlement Papers
At the closing for your property’s sale, you’re going to be buried in an
avalanche of paperwork. After you dig yourself out, you may just want to run
away from it all. Avoid this temptation! You have to keep copies of all those
papers for the good ol’ IRS. Next time you file your taxes, you may need docu-
mentation for the expenses and proceeds of the sale (see Chapter 16 for
details). And even if you don’t have to file any additional forms with your 
tax return, hold onto this paperwork in case you’re ever audited.

Keep Proof of Improvements 
and Prior Purchases
Whether they help you or hurt you, tax laws all have one thing in common:
They’re a headache. A perfect example is the law that allows you to add the
cost of improvements to your home’s cost basis (see Chapter 16) during 
your years of ownership — a potentially nice tax break, if you have a sizable
capital gain.
The problem is, to be able to take advantage of this tax break, you need 
to save receipts for every dollar you spend on home improvements. And, for 
as long as you’re a homeowner (which can be decades) and continue to defer
paying tax on your profits, you have to hang onto these receipts. As if you
don’t already have enough clutter in your life!
We realize that saving all these receipts can seem like an exercise in futility. 
If you’re never audited, your receipts may never see the light of day. In fact, 
if your house-sale profits fall under the exclusion limits, your adjusted cost
basis for tax purposes is a moot point. But the point of keeping documenta-
tion for tax purposes is to anticipate the unexpected; think of it as insurance.
Someday, you may sell your house and owe tax on your profits. And, because
you never know when one of those dreaded IRS audit letters will land in your
mailbox, keep those receipts!
Stash Your Cash in a Good 
Money Market Fund
If you sell your house and don’t immediately buy another one, you need to
find a safe place to park your proceeds. You don’t want to put that money
somewhere volatile, such as the stock market, where a market crash on any
given day, week, month, or year can delay the purchase of your new home for 
a long, long time. On the other hand, you also don’t want tens of thousands of
dollars languishing in a low- or no-interest checking or savings bank account.
Money market mutual funds offer you the best of both worlds — safety and 
reasonable rates of return. Although money market funds aren’t insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), no money market fund has ever
lost retail shareholder principal in the history of the fund business. Currently,
money market funds are yielding about 5 percent.

Like bank savings accounts, but unlike certificates of deposit (CDs), money
market funds offer daily access to your money without penalty. Most money
market funds also offer free check-writing privileges, usually with the 
stipulation that the checks are for at least $250 or $500.
Among the major mutual fund companies with good money market funds, 
consider Vanguard (800-662-7447), Fidelity Spartan (800-544-8888), and USAA
(800-531-8181). If you’re in a high tax bracket, consider a tax-free money
market fund that may end up netting you a higher effective return than a 
taxable money market fund on whose dividends you must pay federal and
state income taxes. For more details on money market and other types of
mutual funds, pick up a copy of the latest edition of Mutual Funds For
Dummies (Wiley) by Eric Tyson.
Double-check the Tax Rules 
for Excluding Tax on Profits
As we discuss in Chapters 2 and 16, a tax law passed in 1997 enables you to
exclude from taxation a significant portion of the profits from the sale of your
primary residence. Congress can’t ever seem to leave things alone, though, so
keep your eyes and ears open for possible changes to the real estate tax laws. 
If you base important decisions on outdated rules, you risk losing loads of
money.
Cast a Broad Net When You 
Consider Your Next Home
Selling your house and buying another takes a great deal of your time and
money. The more often you move, the more these costs compound. So, when
you choose your next home, choose carefully.
Before setting your mind on living in one specific area or type of property,
check out a variety of different areas and housing options that address your
needs. As a variation of the famous Socrates’ quote, “The unexamined life is
not worth living,” we say, “You’ll probably be less happy in your next home
and want to move soon if you haven’t explored alternatives before buying.”
275
Chapter 17: Ten Things to Do After You Sell

Remember That Renting 
Can Be a Fine Strategy
Don’t feel pressured to rush into purchasing your next home, especially 
if you’re having doubts about the location and the type of home you want.
Renting isn’t “throwing money away,” especially in the short-term. Buying 
a home you soon have to sell because it doesn’t meet your needs or wants 
is throwing money away — the transaction costs of buying and selling real
estate can dwarf the short-term costs of renting.
If you’re unsure about where you want to buy, try renting in the area you 
love most. If the neighborhood turns out to be everything you dreamed (or 
at least good enough), then you’re in position to move fast when homes in
that area become available. On the other hand, if you find that the neighbor-
hood has too many warts, you can pat yourself on the back for not rushing
into a purchase and use the rental as a base for investigating other options.
If you do rent after selling your house — because you no longer have those 
tax-deductible mortgage interest and property tax payments — be sure to
increase your income tax withholding or estimated quarterly payments. Your
employer’s benefit department can provide you with Form W-4 for adjusting
your withholding. If you’re self-employed, adjust your quarterly tax payments
using the “Estimated Tax Worksheet” that comes with Form 1040-ES.
Reevaluate Your Personal Finances 
When Things Change
While you’re waiting to purchase another home, your situation can change, of
course. Perhaps you get a big promotion at work or inherit money. Or maybe
you have twins instead of one baby, and your expenses increase while your
income decreases.
No matter the change, be sure to revisit your ability to make future housing
payments and accomplish your other financial and personal goals before 
signing any real estate contracts. When you do buy another home, be sure 
to adjust your income tax payments by using the forms we mention in the 
preceding section.
276
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Don’t Simply Rehire Your Listing 
Agent When You Repurchase
The agent who just sold your house may have done a terrific job. And you
may be tempted to simplify the selection process for finding an agent for
your repurchase by asking that same agent to help you with buying.
You’re possibly making a mistake if you rehire the listing agent when you
repurchase. Here’s why:
 Buying and selling require different skills.
 Moving from one geographic area to another requires knowledge of two
local real estate markets that may have quite different issues and property
values.
 Different agents specialize in different price ranges and types of proper-
ties, and you’re probably not moving to a property of the same type and
in the same price range.
If you believe that your listing agent also has the skills needed to be a good
buying agent, and you’re moving within the community into a similar type of
property, then interview that agent as one of the three agents you’re consid-
ering hiring. Make clear to the agent who sold your house that, although you
appreciate his or her efforts for you as a seller, the agent who best meets
your needs as a buyer is a separate issue.
Think through Your Next Down Payment
After you sell your house, you may well have some choices about the size 
of the down payment on your next home purchase. At a minimum, we recom-
mend that you make a down payment of at least 20 percent of the purchase
price of your next home. Why? Because that’s the percentage that generally
qualifies you for the best mortgage programs available.
What if you can make more than a 20-percent down payment? In that case, the
real question is whether you can earn a high enough return investing that extra
money in mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and so on to beat the cost of borrowing
money on your mortgage.
277
Chapter 17: Ten Things to Do After You Sell

Suppose that you get a quote for a fixed-rate mortgage that charges 7 percent
in annual interest. Ask yourself whether you think that you can invest your
extra cash and earn more than a 7 percent return (ignore the tax write-offs 
of mortgage interest because those are offset by the tax you’ll owe on your
investment profits). Investing in bank accounts, money market funds, or qual-
ity bonds surely won’t do the trick. To have the potential to earn a return that
high, you must consider growth-oriented and riskier investments, such as
stocks, investment real estate, or small business investments.
Younger homebuyers willing to take on more investment risk should lean
toward a 20-percent down payment. Older homebuyers who tend to invest
less aggressively should opt for larger down payments.
Remember to Send Change 
of Address Notices
Although you may want those to whom you owe money to think that you’ve
fallen off the face of the earth, you don’t want to rack up late payment fees,
interest charges, and damage your credit report because your bills can’t find
you. Don’t forget to change your address with the following folks:
 Billing companies (credit and charge cards, cell phones, loans, 
and so on)
 Investment accounts
 Places of employment
 Family and friends
Don’t delay informing all parties you know of your change of address! Visit 
or call your local post office and request a Mover’s Guide, which includes a 
permanent Change of Address Order Card (or do everything online at www.
moversguide.com). The Postal Service recommends that you complete and
mail your Change of Address Order Card or Internet form 30 days before you
move to ensure timely forwarding of mail after the date of the move.

I
f you own your own home, you may also own property that you rent out
and may someday sell. Or perhaps you’ve rented your house or a portion
of it for a time and are interested in selling.
No matter, this chapter highlights some critical issues for you to consider
before trying to sell your rental real estate. And, because the profitability (that
is, your rental income less expenses) of your rental property has an enormous
impact on the property’s worth, we also provide you with tips for boosting
your property’s profitability well in advance of selling.
Don’t Inadvertently Convert Your 
House into Income Property
Suppose that you list your house for sale and it sits and sits for months on 
end without any offers. (Clearly, you haven’t yet read this book and heeded 
its advice!) You need to move, and because you’re not Bill Gates, you can’t
afford to leave the house vacant while you’re making your mortgage payments,
paying property tax and insurance payments, and simultaneously shouldering
the cost of renting or buying another home. So, you decide to rent out your 
difficult-to-sell house for a number of months while still on the market.

If you cease seriously trying to sell your house while renting, the IRS deems
that you’ve converted your home into rental property, and you owe capital
gains tax unless you buy a replacement rental property. If you have any doubts
about running afoul of the tax laws, please consult with a good tax advisor.
Exercise Extra Care When 
You Sell Rental Property
The IRS makes a distinction between property that a taxpayer lives in and
property that he rents out to others, even if both are within the same building.
You need to understand this distinction and its tax implications.
For example, suppose that you’ve owned and lived in a home for a number 
of years. Your house has an attached rental unit that you rent out. You’ve

Part V: The Part of Tens 
The advantages of rental real estate
Suppose that you made a killing when you sold
your house, or you’re simply a good saver, or you’re
the beneficiary of a nice inheritance. If you have
some extra cash burning a hole in your pocket,
consider investing in some rental real estate.
Real estate is a good long-term investment.
Historically, real estate investors have enjoyed
average annual rates of return (in the range of 9
percent to 10 percent) comparable to stock
market investors’ returns.
Part of the reason for those healthy real estate
returns comes from the fact that land is in limited
supply, so the price of land — and the property
on it — generally faces upward price pressure as
the economy and population expands. And,
because you can borrow upward of 80 percent of
the purchase price of a property, you leverage
your invested capital to work harder for you; you
earn returns not only on your down payment but
also on the borrowed money.
Looking ahead to your golden retirement years,
rental real estate not only should appreciate in
value but also should provide you with rental
income for living expenses. And, when you
eventually decide to sell your rental real estate
to tap into the equity in your property, under 
current tax laws, the maximum federal income
tax rate that you pay on your long-term capital
gain (assets held more than one year) is just 15
percent, which may be less than the tax rate that
you pay on your employment or investment
income.
And, last but not least, if you have a great deal
of your retirement nest egg stashed in the stock
market, rental real estate can help you diversify
your investment portfolio. Of course, when you
consider how diversified your investments are
(or aren’t), don’t forget all the money that you
may have “invested” in real estate by virtue of
owning your home.

claimed depreciation deductions for the rental portion of your property on
your annual income tax return. Suppose further that the rental unit accounts
for about 25 percent of the total living space of the building. When you sell
the property, the IRS treats the sale as two separate transactions — the sale
of your primary residence (the 75 percent portion of the property) and the
sale of a rental property (the other 25 percent portion of the property).
Therefore, 75 percent of your profits are subject to the primary residence
capital gains exclusion rules explained in Chapter 16.
As for the profits on the rental portion of the property, you owe capital gains
tax on those profits unless you buy another building with a rental unit that
meets the particular requirements that we discuss in the next section.
Know How to Defer Your Investment
Property Profits
Taxable profits on the sale of an investment property often are much greater
than on a comparable residential property. The difference is that the IRS
allows you to depreciate investment property while you own it and deduct
the depreciation amount from your income taxes every year. The tax break 
is nice, but the IRS always is careful not to give people too much of a good
thing. Therefore, when you sell the property, you must factor the deprecia-
tion you took on the property into the property’s adjusted cost basis (see
Chapter 16).
Suppose that you buy an investment property for $200,000, and many years
later you sell it for $350,000. During your years of owning the property, you
claim a total of $50,000 in depreciation on your tax returns. The amount of
depreciation reduces your cost basis from the original $200,000 purchase
price to $150,000, thus making your “taxable profit” that much larger. You
owe capital gains tax on $200,000 — the difference between the sale price 
of $350,000 and the adjusted cost basis of $150,000.
Fortunately, you can defer taxes on these gains by rolling over your profits into
another investment property. If you simultaneously sell an investment property
and buy another, that one exchange is called a 1031 exchange (1031 refers to
the section of the tax laws that allows these exchanges). If the exchange isn’t
simultaneous — that is, if you delay your purchase of the second property —
you must meet some specific requirements (called the Starker rules, after a
famous tax case).
281
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Selling Rental Real Estate

If you’re going to do a Starker or a 1031 exchange, be sure to enlist the help of
an attorney or tax advisor who’s an expert at these transactions to ensure that
you do it right. You need an experienced professional to help you jump the
many legal hoops (such as filling out special tax forms like Form 8824, which
tells the IRS that you bought a “like kind” investment property). See Chapter 7
for advice on finding good advisors.
Understand Your Local Market 
to Time Your Sale
If you own property that you hold solely for rental/investment purposes, you
probably have a great deal of discretion about when you sell the property. 
As with other investments, you may wonder when a good time to sell is.
Surely you have some sense from watching real estate prices and rental
vacancy rates whether your local market is strong, weak, or somewhere in
between. Although we don’t believe that we — or you — can predict future real
estate prices in a given community, to help you better determine whether now
is a good time to be cashing in your chips, examine the following factors:
 Economic health: The vitality of the local employment market is crucial to
a healthy local real estate market. What’s the unemployment rate in your
local area and how does that rate compare with prior months and years?
 New construction: If real estate prices have been on the rise, the number
of new building projects may be on the increase, which can be a sign that
now is a good time to sell. As more properties come onto the market and
prices spiral higher and higher, eventually the increase in construction
acts like water on a fire, extinguishing future strength.
 Available land: Housing units must be built on land; the less land that
remains available for development, the more upward pressure is exerted
on housing prices.
 Housing for sale: All things being equal, the fewer properties for sale,
the better the environment in which to be selling. In a strong real estate
market, housing sells relatively quickly and the inventory of property for
sale is in relatively short supply.
 Rental real estate market health: Although being a renter is tough when
vacancy rates are low and falling and rental rates are escalating, being the
owner of rental/investment real estate is great. Rental real estate is worth
more when the local rental market is strong.
282
Part V: The Part of Tens 

You need to spend some time and energy tracking down useful information.
Try these suggestions:
 Your local Association of Realtors should be able to provide you with
some historic house sales data.
 The local Chamber of Commerce can steer you in the direction of job
market data.
 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics also compiles employment data.
 Apartment and other rental property owners also have local associations
that can provide you with rental data on the local market.
Understand Opportunities 
for Adding Value
Before you bought your property, you should’ve taken the time to research
and understand the effects of zoning or possible rezoning on your property’s
use. A surprising number of real estate buyers, however, neglect this impor-
tant step. Even if you did understand the zoning of the property before you
bought, the mood of your local planning department, which interprets zoning
laws and approves building projects, may have changed in the meantime.
So, before you consider listing your property for sale, be sure that you know
how you can improve its use and value. Even if you don’t want to do signifi-
cant renovation or contracting work, you need to at least understand how
you can further develop the property so that you can sell for a higher price
by promoting the opportunity to add value.
Maximize Your Property’s Income
The income and resulting cash flow (income less expenses) that a property
can generate drive the amount a rental property is worth. Suppose that you
can purchase a four-unit building in a rural area or you can buy a similar four-
unit building in an upscale suburban community just a half-hour’s commute
from an economically robust city.
283
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Selling Rental Real Estate

If each unit in the rural building rented for just $350 per month whereas those
near the city rented for $1,000 per month, which building do you think would
be worth more money? Or, looking at it another way, which building would
you prefer to buy if both buildings were for sale for the same price? Higher
rents translate into a much higher property sale price.
Suppose that property like yours typically sells for 10 times the property’s
gross annual income. For example, each unit rents for $1,000 per month × 4
units × 12 months = $48,000. And $48,000 × 10 (gross multiplier) = $480,000
market value.
Suppose that, through property improvements, you can increase the unit
rents by 10 percent. Now the building is worth $1,100 per month × 4 units ×
12 months = $52,800. And $52,800 × 10 = $528,000 market value. Thus, a mere
$100 per month per unit increase results in a $48,000 increase in the build-
ing’s value.
Plan for the sale of your rental property as far in advance as possible so your
rental income is maximized. If any units are coming vacant, examine what
upgrades can be done to boost the rent you can charge. Also consider what
enhancements you can make to the building and survey the local rental 
marketplace to ensure that you’re not underpricing units.
Minimize Your Property’s Expenses
In addition to maximizing income, you can also increase a property’s cash flow
by minimizing its expenses. Planning at least a couple of years in advance for
the sale of your building should give you enough time to make your property
more cost efficient to operate and therefore more profitable and appealing to
the next buyer.
For example, although you have to shell out some money upfront, investing in
energy efficiency by insulating your property and installing modern appliances
can really slash your operating costs. If you haven’t evaluated your insurance
for at least a couple of years, shop around to be sure that you’re getting the
best insurance value that you can.
Reducing the operating costs of your property increases its cash flow and,
hence, its value.
284

Utilize Agents with Investment 
Property Experience
In Chapter 7, we provide a great deal of sound and practical advice for locating
an extraordinary real estate agent. The tips and techniques apply equally well
to landing a great agent for the sale of an investment property.
However — and this is a big however — be sure to hire an agent who special-
izes in selling your type of investment property in your area. An agent lacking
experience with selling investment real estate similar to yours may misprice
your property or lack the special skills necessary to market and successfully
sell it — or both! Be sure to ask agents you’re interviewing for activity lists
detailing each property they listed and sold during the past year. Check out
Chapter 7 for more info.
Visit Comparables and Review 
the Valuation Analysis
Especially if you’ve owned investment real estate for a number of years, your
property may be very valuable. But if you overprice your property, it may sit
unsold for many months and end up fetching less than it otherwise could in
the real estate marketplace. Underprice your property and you may leave
money on the table.
If you’re going to hire a real estate agent to help sell the property, interview at
least three agents who specialize in selling such property in your area. Each
agent should prepare a comparable market analysis (CMA) to evaluate your
property’s worth. See Chapter 10 for more on CMAs.
By digging into the details of each CMA the agents provide you, you can better
determine your property’s real worth. And as you continue finding out more
about your local market and visiting properties, you can determine which
agent did the best job with her analysis.
For properties that have sold recently, there’s no substitute for actually seeing
the property. You may be surprised at how many property owners are willing
to show you their properties. Remember, though, you won’t get to see any
unless you ask.
285
Chapter 18: Ten Tips for Selling Rental Real Estate

Some rental buildings simply are a pain in the posterior to find comparable
sales for. Perhaps no similar buildings have sold for a long time in the area or
no similar properties exist.
Don’t be penny-wise and pound-foolish. If you have doubts about the value of
your property, even after having real estate agents prepare a CMA, spring for
the fee of several hundred dollars to hire a good real estate appraiser who has
experience with rental properties like yours in the area.
Work with Rental-Property-Experienced
Tax and Legal Advisors
If you’re dealing with rental real estate, expect complicated and unclear 
tax and legal issues to get in your way. If you choose to hire advisors to help
you navigate the morass, be sure that you’re getting your money’s worth in
good advice.
Working in residential real estate isn’t sufficient experience for advisors to
whom you’re paying high fees for advice about your rental property. Tax and
other laws pertaining to rental property sometimes differ tremendously from
laws regulating owner-occupied housing. Hire advisors who specialize in
dealing with rental property.

Ten Questions Home Buyers May
Ask and How to Answer ’Em
In This Chapter
 Preparing to answer awkward questions
 Placing yourself in the buyer’s shoes
A
s a house seller, you should anticipate tough questions smart home
buyers (or their agents) may ask you. Most sellers and their agents are
quick to praise property features such as a remodeled kitchen, new roof, and
swimming pool. That’s great, but what home buyers really want to know about
are benefits — how house features translate into advantages for them. For
example, that fancy kitchen may inspire more family meals and a swimming
pool becomes an entertainment center for healthy outdoor family activities
during the lazy, hazy days of summer. Other types of benefits buyers may be
looking for include quality schools, a low crime rate for safety and security,
convenient nearby shopping, hospitable neighborhood, and favorable fair
market value (FMV) appreciation (showing the home is likely to be a 
profitable investment).
You need to make sure you’re prepared to answer these potential questions in
a manner that honestly represents your house without jeopardizing a potential
sale. The best defense is a good offense. Sellers (and their listing agents) who
are prepared should have nothing to fear from buyers who ask these questions.
This chapter includes ten challenging questions you may be asked and some
advice on how to handle them.
What Do You Like Best and 
Least about Living Here?
When someone asks you what you like the most and the least about living in
your house, you don’t want to look like the proverbial deer in the headlights.
Do your homework. Make a list of items you like about your house. Do another

list of things you don’t like. On your “like” list, put things like waking up with
the sun on your face, watching the moon rise while sitting on the back porch,
family dinners in the kitchen, and playing board games by the fireplace —
whatever you truly enjoy about your house.
The “dislike” list is more difficult. On one hand, you don’t want to scare away
buyers. Conversely, every property has flaws, and you want to be honest. Ray
once owned a house he loved except when he had to do battle with poison oak.
Maybe you don’t like navigating the driveway when it snows. Perhaps you hate
the long central hallway or small kitchen or hot attic. Just because you dislike
something about the property doesn’t mean the next buyer will.
Folks in the market for a condo usually ask this question. They’re curious
about the issues that don’t apply to a single-family detached home, such as a
dictatorial condo homeowner’s association board of directors or a president
who refuses to listen to condo owner opinions.
Veteran real estate writer and syndicated columnist Robert Bruss, who 
contributed much of the material for this chapter, shares the following story
about a second-home condo he owns:
“Several months ago, a prospective buyer was waiting in the entrance foyer
for her realty agent to show her a unit which was for sale. As I was picking
up my mail, she asked me if there was anything I didn’t like about the 63-
unit condo complex. Thinking fast, I explained my condo unit has been in
my family for 29 years, so we must like the building. Then I pointed out she
should check the soundproofing of the unit she’s considering for purchase
because poor soundproofing is the number one complaint of condominium
buyers. Other than occasionally hearing my neighbors, I said, I thought the
condo building’s benefits far outweighed any disadvantages. I hope that
condo buyer asked the same question of other current owners, especially
her prospective adjacent neighbors.”
Why Are You Selling This Lovely House?
When buyers ask you the reason why you’re selling your house, they have a
hidden agenda. They’re either probing your motivation for selling to see if they
can exploit a weakness, or they’re looking for property flaws.
If the buyer knows you’re under severe pressure to sell your property as soon
as possible, negotiating can be difficult. (A few examples of deadline situations
are things like buying a new home before you sell the old one (see Chapter 6),
being transferred to a new job in another city, getting a divorce, and property
foreclosure.) If you have a deadline and the buyers don’t, they may use that
deadline against you. Therefore, never divulge your deadline. See Chapter 14
for more information about time and negotiations.
288
Part V: The Part of Tens 

If you have a nice, unstressed reason for selling, candidly answer the question.
“We’re selling because the house has gotten too big for us since the kids moved
out to start their own families” or “We’d like a bigger place because the kids
need rooms of their own” are examples of answers that won’t get you in trou-
ble. If, however, you’re going through the divorce from hell or are about to
depart for Timbuktu tomorrow, just say, “My housing needs have changed” 
and change the topic.
How Much Did You Pay for This House?
Some buyers may want to know the amount you paid for your house in order
to discover how much room you have to negotiate on price and terms. In most
states, the seller’s purchase price is recorded in the public records. But even in
the few states which don’t record price information, the buyer’s agent can find
out what you paid through the local Multiple Listing Service (MLS) or by other
methods.
A related question buyers may ask you or your listing agent is “What is the
current mortgage balance and are there any other liens, such as a second mort-
gage, a home equity loan, or a mechanics’ lien? The answer shows prospective
buyers how much cash you need to pay off those secured obligations.
As Chapter 10 points out, cost and fair market value are wildly different things.
Cost is a measure of past expenditure. Fair market value is what a buyer will
pay and a seller will accept for something given the item has had proper expo-
sure to the market and neither the buyer not the seller is under duress.
Smart buyers know that what you paid for the house when you bought it 
has no bearing on its value today. You may have made extensive renovations.
Certainly internal and external market factors have changed since you
acquired the property. Talking about what you paid for your house is as 
productive as discussing the price of tea in China.
But if those persistent buyers do ask the question, tell ’em what Bob Bruss
tells his buyers: “I got a bargain price when this was a run-down shack so my
purchase price is irrelevant in today’s market.” He has fun with buyers and
lets them or their agents work to discover how much he paid.
How Did You Establish the Asking Price?
Some prospective home buyers may ask how you determined your asking
price. When someone asks this question, reference the information in
Chapter 10.
289
Chapter 19: Ten Questions Home Buyers May Ask and How to Answer ’Em

Smart sellers base their asking price on facts established by a written compara-
ble market analysis (CMA). You or your agent can respond to this question by
telling buyers about other properties comparable to yours in size, age, loca-
tion, and condition (comps) that are either currently on the market or have
sold within the past six months. Comps are the best, most powerful indicators
of FMV.
Have You Received Inspection Reports?
Buyers may ask you when or if your house was inspected, and this question
should be an easy one to answer. As noted in Chapter 7, we recommend that
you obtain customary inspections before putting your property on the market.
That step gives you time to decide if you want to do the recommended repairs
before you put your house on the market or sell the property “as is” and let the
buyer make the repairs (often in return for a credit in escrow for the buyers).
Always fully divulge any and all corrective work you’ve done recently. Check
out Chapter 12 for a list of adjectives you should avoid when describing your
house.
Customary local inspections vary. Local realty agents can tell you which
inspections are required or recommended in your area, such as for termites,
radon, energy efficiency, building code compliance, and so on. Either you or
your agent should have any recent inspection reports easily available for
serious buyers to inspect. This process saves time and removes the fear
some prospective buyers may have that you’re trying to hide something.
May I See Your Written Defect 
Disclosure Statement?
If a prospective buyer asks to see your written defect disclosure statement,
you should say, “Sure, here it is.” Sellers who don’t prepare a written disclo-
sure form for serious prospective buyers to review prior to making a written
purchase offer are waving a “red flag” that warns buyers that you don’t have a
savvy listing agent who insists on such defect disclosures at the time of sign-
ing the listing agreement. Smart buyers understand that some sellers may lie
or “forget” to disclose a known property defect. If you have to ask whether to
disclose something about your property or the immediate neighborhood,
you’ve probably answered your own question. When in doubt, disclose.
(Check out Chapter 8 for more information on seller disclosure statements.)

Part V: The Part of Tens 

Most states now have laws or precedent court decisions requiring some form
of written home defect disclosures. This requirement began in California after
the famous 1984 court decision in Easton v. Strassburger. This wise change
quickly spread to other states. In this important case, the seller and the real
estate agent were held liable to the home buyer for damages resulting from
failure to disclose that there had been a recent hill slide adjacent to the
house. A second hill slide after the buyer’s purchase caused more damage
than the house was worth.
Even in the few states where there aren’t disclosure requirements, smart
agents recommend that their sellers provide written house defect disclosures
to prevent future lawsuits. Most agents now also recommend that home
buyers obtain their own professional home inspection reports even if the
seller already has provided one.
Are There Any Neighborhood Changes
that May Affect the Home’s Desirability?
House sellers almost always know if any significant civic changes are under
discussion, such as street widening, construction of a new nearby noisy free-
way, or a planned special assessment for civic improvements such as new
sewers or streets. However, smart buyers will verify any planned improve-
ments affecting the property at the local city hall or other government
agency.
Any of these changes would materially affect the property values. Therefore,
you should disclose all changes in writing to prospective buyers. This info
includes plans your neighbors may have to improve their property if such
improvements affect your house’s views or your access to adjoining public
areas.
How Many Times in the Last Year Have
You Called the Police and Why?
When potential buyers ask about police calls and possible neighborhood nui-
sances, they’re trying to determine how safe and secure your house is.
Answering this question is easy if you don’t have any problems of this nature.
If, however, you do, you must disclose any and all such problems.
This open-end question covers many potential problems, which can affect a
home’s desirability. These problems include barking dogs, noisy late night
291
Chapter 19: Ten Questions Home Buyers May Ask and How to Answer ’Em

parties, and troublesome neighbors. If the situation is continuing, make sure
you disclose all issues to prospective buyers to prevent a future lawsuit for
nondisclosure of a serious defect.
The leading court decision on this issue is Shapiro v. Sutherland where the
sellers phoned the local police many times about their noisy neighbors. But
the sellers “forgot” to disclose this problem to the buyer. The noise from the
neighbors was so bad the buyer moved out almost immediately. He then sued
the seller for rescission of the sale to get a refund of the purchase price. The
court ordered rescission for the seller’s failure to disclose the very noisy
neighbors.
A visit to the local police station can reveal local crime statistics for the 
neighborhood. Also, this is usually the place to search public records for 
any registered child sex predators living nearby (called Megan’s law; www.
parentsformeganslaw.org). But home buyers shouldn’t expect sellers 
to know the neighborhood crime statistics, nor to know if a registered sex
offender lives nearby.
What Problems Have You 
Had with the House?
This open-ended question is intended to bring out past problems, which 
may have been solved. This question has one major thing in common with
many of the other questions in this chapter — a variation of queries about
property inspection reports and defect disclosure forms. Buyers have many
ways of probing for property defects. Answer this question by giving the
buyer a copy of your written disclosure statement. (This issue is covered in
detail in Chapter 8).
What Are the Local Public Schools Like?
If prospective buyers have school-age children, they may have asked this ques-
tion first. Even if buyers don’t have children, the quality of the public schools
has a strong effect on whether families with children want to move to your
area, thus affecting buyer demand and future appreciation in market value.
Presuming that your school system’s test scores are good, you can provide
the data yourself. Contact your local district if your agent doesn’t have the
data already. Just be careful not to imply that your house is within a particu-
lar boundary area for a particular school unless you’re 100 percent certain
that you’re correct!

Appendixes

In this part . . .
A
ppendixes are usually parts of books that readers
never read and publishers add to bulk up emaciated
books. However, we’ve added vital documents to our appen-
dix! When you’re selling your house, you should know what
a good real estate contract and premarketing inspection
report look like. We provide real examples of each. We also
include a handy-dandy glossary to define all the jargon that
so often gets thrown around in the real estate field.

Appendix A
Sample Real Estate 
Purchase Contract
L
ife would be simple, indeed, if everyone in the United States used the same
real estate purchase contract. Unfortunately, that’s not how the house-
selling game is played. On the contrary, purchase contracts vary widely in both
length and content from state to state and, within a state, from one locality to
another.
Depending on where you live, the contract you actually receive from the buyer’s
agent or lawyer may range from a relatively short, simple form to a complicated,
multipage document chock-full of legalese.
This appendix includes a copy of the California Association of Realtors’ real
estate purchase contract. We chose California’s contract not just because we
live here, but also because it’s one of the most comprehensive residential real
estate contracts used anywhere in the country.
Most purchase contracts include a warning that says something like this:
“This is more than a receipt for money. It is intended to be a legally binding
contract. Read it carefully.”
Heed the warning!
Read the contract you receive extremely carefully before signing it. Don’t sign
the purchase contract until you understand each and every one of the terms
and conditions of sale. If you have any questions about the legality of your
contract, consult a lawyer.

and expense for Repairs or corrections pertaining to that contingency or cancellation right, or for inability to obtain financing.
E.
EFFECT OF CANCELLATION ON DEPOSITS: If Buyer or Seller gives written notice of cancellation pursuant to rights duly
exercised under the terms of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller agree to Sign mutual instructions to cancel the sale and escrow
and release deposits to the party entitled to the funds, less fees and costs incurred by that party. Fees and costs may be payable
to service providers and vendors for services and products provided during escrow. Release of funds will require mutual
Signed release instructions from Buyer and Seller, judicial decision or arbitration award. A party may be subject to
a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for refusal to sign such instructions if no good faith dispute exists as to who is entitled
to the deposited funds (Civil Code §1057.3).
15. FINAL VERIFICATION OF CONDITION: Buyer shall have the right to make a final inspection of the Property within 5 (or
____________) Days Prior to Close Of Escrow, NOT AS A CONTINGENCY OF THE SALE, but solely to confirm: (i) the Property

obligations under this Agreement.
16. LIQUIDATED DAMAGES: If Buyer fails to complete this purchase because of Buyer’s default, Seller shall retain,
as liquidated damages, the deposit actually paid. If the Property is a dwelling with no more than four units,
one of which Buyer intends to occupy, then the amount retained shall be no more than 3% of the purchase
price. Any excess shall be returned to Buyer. Release of funds will require mutual, Signed release instructions
from both Buyer and Seller, judicial decision or arbitration award.
BUYER AND SELLER SHALL SIGN A SEPARATE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVISION FOR ANY INCREASED
DEPOSIT. (C.A.R. FORM RID)  
17. DISPUTE RESOLUTION:
A.
MEDIATION: Buyer and Seller agree to mediate any dispute or claim arising between them out of this Agreement, or any
resulting transaction, before resorting to arbitration or court action.
Paragraphs 17B(2) and (3) below apply to mediation
whether or not the Arbitration provision is initialed. Mediation fees, if any, shall be divided equally among the parties involved.
If, for any dispute or claim to which this paragraph applies, any party commences an action without first attempting to resolve
the matter through mediation, or refuses to mediate after a request has been made, then that party shall not be entitled to
recover attorney fees, even if they would otherwise be available to that party in any such action. THIS MEDIATION PROVISION
APPLIES WHETHER OR NOT THE ARBITRATION PROVISION IS INITIALED.
B.
ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES: (1) Buyer and Seller agree that any dispute or claim in Law or equity arising
between them out of this Agreement or any resulting transaction, which is not settled through mediation,
shall be decided by neutral, binding arbitration, including and subject to paragraphs 17B(2) and (3) below.
The arbitrator shall be a retired judge or justice, or an attorney with at least 5 years of residential real estate
Law experience, unless the parties mutually agree to a different arbitrator, who shall render an award in
accordance with substantive California Law. The parties shall have the right to discovery in accordance
with California Code of Civil Procedure §1283.05. In all other respects, the arbitration shall be conducted
in accordance with Title 9 of Part III of the California Code of Civil Procedure. Judgment upon the award of
the arbitrator(s) may be entered into any court having jurisdiction. Interpretation of this agreement to
arbitrate shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.
(2) EXCLUSIONS FROM MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION: The following matters are excluded from mediation and
arbitration: (i) a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure or other action or proceeding to enforce a deed of trust, mortgage
or installment land sale contract as defined in California Civil Code §2985; (ii) an unlawful detainer action; (iii) the filing
or enforcement of a mechanic's lien; and (iv) any matter that is within the jurisdiction of a probate, small claims or
bankruptcy court. The filing of a court action to enable the recording of a notice of pending action, for order of
attachment, receivership, injunction, or other provisional remedies, shall not constitute a waiver of the mediation and
arbitration provisions.
(3) BROKERS: Buyer and Seller agree to mediate and arbitrate disputes or claims involving either or both Brokers,
consistent with 17A and B, provided either or both Brokers shall have agreed to such mediation or arbitration prior to,
or within a reasonable time after, the dispute or claim is presented to Brokers. Any election by either or both Brokers
to participate in mediation or arbitration shall not result in Brokers being deemed parties to the Agreement.

Part VI: Appendixes 

Appendix B
Example of a Good 
Inspection Report
T
he physical condition of your house greatly affects its value. Prudent
purchasers always have a property thoroughly inspected before they buy 
it. No matter how beautifully you dress it up, buyers won’t pay top dollar for 
a house that needs extensive, expensive repairs.
Don’t let corrective-work problems sabotage your sale. Arrange your own
inspection before you put your house on the market. In Chapter 7, we discuss
four compelling reasons why getting a premarketing inspection is a good idea.
We also explain how to choose a qualified inspector.
Be sure that the premarketing inspection covers all your house’s major 
structural and mechanical systems, inside and out, from foundation to roof.
Anything less is unacceptable. Thoroughly inspecting a house or condo of
average size usually takes three to four hours.
Reading the best report ever written is no substitute for seeing defects with
your own eyes. That’s why we strongly recommend that you (and your agent,
if you’re using one) tag along when your inspector does the premarketing
inspection. Use this opportunity to question the inspector about a defect’s
ramifications and explore corrective work alternatives.

•    The inspected unit was fully furnished.
•    A Structural / Pest-Control Inspection Report was not yet provided.
•    The Seller’s Disclosure Statement was not yet prepared or provided.
As requested, this report is being prepared for the exclusive use of the property owner. In no 
way is it to be used by, nor are we obligated to review it with, any third parties. Because 
Warren Camp Inspection Services (WCIS) has not personally described the extent and nature 
of its findings to anyone but those present for the inspection, WCIS strongly discourages third 
parties from using this report. Interested parties should arrange with WCIS for an inspection 
that meets their more individualized needs.
This report provides a professional opinion of general features and major deficiencies of the 
building and its systems at inspection. It does not necessarily analyze or report on adjacent 
properties, nor does it cover environmental/neighborhood concerns. It summarizes 
observations on components inspected in accordance with customary property-inspection 
standards. The scope of our inspection is limited only to items discussed. It is not technically 
exhaustive. And, because certain findings are variable (cracking lengths throughout the 
structure that increase in time, erosion and corrosion levels that do not remain static, and so 
on), no one should rely on any reported findings for more than one year.
This is not a code compliance report; a home, product, or system guarantee of any kind; nor is 
it an evaluation of the property’s salability. It includes only those items accessible to visual 
inspection; no furniture relocation, dismantling, demolition, or other manual handling, would 
have occurred in the preparation of this report. This report does not fulfill the requirements set 
forth in California Civil Code Section 1102 as to the required disclosures of a transferor of real 
property.
The WCIS inspector explained to the owner the two types of reports WCIS prepares. Rather

INTRODUCTION
The inspected property was a single-family dwelling with most of its interior spaces furnished 
and filled with personal belongings. Low-voltage wiring, heat exchangers, gardens, fences, 
retaining walls, underground piping and storage tanks, and sprinklers are not included in the 
scope of WCIS inspection reports, which are designed to meet or exceed current “Standards 
of Practice” established by the American Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI) of which the 
WCIS inspector is a certified member-inspector. A copy of the Standards is available upon 
request.
 For the most part, the building was a three-level, framed structure with an attic and a 
partially accessible crawl space. The built-in garage was constructed partially below grade, 
with construction upgrades therein performed over the years. Built around 1915, this 
wood-framed building typically does not comply with today’s building standards, although it 
has maintained its stature remarkably well, given its age. Because WCIS is not a structural 
engineering firm, it is restricted from evaluating structural integrity of buildings. However, a 
number of important structural features were inspected. See the STRUCTURAL section for a 
description of our findings.
 Although structurally the building was generally in satisfactory condition, some components 
had not been maintained and have begun to fail. There were also a number of safety concerns 
and a few items need repair or replacement.
 The building interior and exterior were well maintained. But of course, all buildings have 
flaws. We’ll discuss some of these flaws but we cannot discover and report on every one. This 
premarketing inspection and report are not technically exhaustive. With only a few hours in 
which to inspect the entire property, WCIS provides, at best, a professional opinion based 
upon experience. WCIS does not provide a thorough or fully detailed analysis of problem 
areas.
  Clients should not assume that items not discussed in this report are, by their omission, 
sound and operational. WCIS can imply no warranty or guarantee for any component or 
system. And, because building code and zoning conformity inspections are made only building 
departments having such jurisdiction, no code conformity evaluation can be made herein. 
Neither does WCIS suggest or provide any assurances that the property, in its current or 
corrected condition, will easily sell.
 All the main point of this report were fully discussed with Red E. Tooselle and his agent, Ken 
B. Elpful, at inspection. The following sections describe the findings discussed. Please call 
with questions.
Repairs, corrections, and other follow-up items to consider, prior to marketing your 
building for sale. (Note: Check-marked concerns are merely highlights of the inspector’s 
findings. Read the entire report to fully appreciate this effort. Where you have interest, 
follow these and the following recommendations and have specialists address those items 
excluded from this inspection and report.)
  
¸   Check with the building inspection department about permits and inspections  
  
      for building alterations and additions.

EXTERIOR
Building Exterior
This building, stuccoed on the façade, and with horizontal-wood siding on the rear wall, was, 
for the most part, adequately painted and maintained. Routinely, all exterior joints should be 
caulked and painted.
 
Left- and right-side walls were blocked by adjacent buildings. When references are made 
to the front, rear, left, and right, they are made facing the building from   
   Street. 
 
At the front wall, soil was close to the top of the foundation. This condition can cause wood 
decay and deterioration, but, because WCIS is not a structural/pest control inspector, our 
client should discuss this condition with the structural/pest control inspector performing such 
inspection.
 
The recently-installed electrical conduit, the rear door, and metal gutters and downspouts 
were not yet painted or weathersealed.
 
Aluminum windows on the façade were new. Wooden windows elsewhere were old but 
generally in satisfactory condition. Exterior window sashes, sills, and trim, especially on the 
rear wall, need caulking and weathersealing. 
 
The garage entry door was a sectional type with open-vent screens in place to protect 
against accidental suffocation from auto exhaust and other fumes and aid in evaporative 
ventilation. Unfortunately, each was covered over with cardboard that should be removed. 
 
Garage access was benefited by an electric opener that was operated. When testing for a 
functional contact-reversing safety feature on this electric opener, it was either not 
programmed into the opener or simply was not functioning at inspection. 
 
Supported by concrete, the left alley stairs were in acceptable condition but lacked a 
much-needed handrail.
 
A wooden stairway at the rear was in satisfactory condition. The handgrip for its stairway 
handrail, however, was wider than today’s industry practices suggest. Handrails can be easily 
made safe! Modify them.
Pavement and Drainage
The front walkway had concrete settlement and cracking. The garden patio and pathway was 
unlighted, and changes in the height of pavement and steps could prove hazardous.
 
Adequate soil drainage for Bay Area homes is imperative since soil types in this area swell 
when saturated and may damage a building’s foundation. Grade at the front of the building 
was sloped likely ensuring adequate drainage away from the foundation during rainstorms. A 
drainage pattern at the rear patio was not as easy to predict. Water entry appears probably 
possibly because pavement was not adequately sloped away from the building and the 
surface drain was clogged. Red E. Tooselle should unclog this drain and keep all drains, 
patios, and walkways clean and well maintained. 
Underground Piping
WCIS detected no outward signs of presently existing or previously placed underground fuel 
storage tanks (USTs) within the inspected areas. There were no fill spout, vent pipe, supply 
tubing and return line, or a fuse box — typical indicators of USTs. Interested parties may wish

to explore further since such exploration is not within the scope of ASHI standard inspection 
practices. 
 
¸Refer to a current Structural / Pest-Control Inspection Report for findings and  
 
 corrective recommendations. 
 
¸Prime and paint the raw materials exposed to the elements.
 
¸ Caulk and weatherseal exterior window sashes, sills, and trim.
 
¸Uncover the garage door’s two open-vent screens.
 
¸Provide or program the contact-reversing mechanism for the automatic garage  
 
 door opener.
 
¸Provide and modify handrails.
 
¸For safety’s sake, improve lighting at the front and rear. 
 
¸Unclog the patio’s surface drain.
FOUNDATION
Only portions of the foundation were visible at inspection. Many areas were blocked by 
finished walls and an extensive amount of personal belongings.
 
A cementlike soil covering, called ratproofing, was in place in the crawl space. The 
membrane appeared intact, with two small openings in the center that could be easily 
patched. 
 
Visible foundation stem walls in the garage and crawl space appear to have been installed 
according to customarily practiced standards. Foundation legs were made of continuous 
concrete, which is often reinforced with internally placed steel bars. However, the existence, 
extent, or condition of any such bars could not be verified.
 
There was hairline or minor cracking on the right-longitudinal leg. Such cracking in a 
building of this type and age is not uncommon and should be routinely monitored. Minimal 
levels of plateau variations (uneven surface levels at cracks) were detected. Looking for any 
direct and current transference of foundation movement to adjacent finished walls, ceilings, 
and floors to rooms above, no outward sign was detectable. It was not possible to determine if 
this cracking was a current condition. If more information is needed, a qualified structural 
engineer, experienced in similar structures, should be contacted to fully inspect and evaluate 
findings on these and any other structural concerns. 
 
The rear-latitudinal leg was water-stained and had efflorescence on its base. This 
appeared related to the lack of fresh-air ventilation in the subarea, failure of the patio’s 
reversed-slope grade, and the clogged surface drain, all of which should be corrected. 
 
Because many garage and basement walls were closed to view, WCIS could not inspect for 
anchor bolting and other concealed fasteners.
 
¸Clear the subarea of personal belongings to facilitate buyers’ upcoming 
 
 pre-purchase inspections.
 
¸Patch the ratproofing openings.
 
¸Routinely monitor the foundation.
 
¸Ventilate the subarea.

STRUCTURAL FRAMING
Substructure
Visual access to structural framing was limited. Many of the structural members within the 
basement and garage were blocked or covered by drywall, an extensive amount of personal 
belongings, building materials, appliances, an automobile, and thermal insulation. Remove 
such blockage in preparation for upcoming prepurchase inspections.
 
Wood posts in the garage were in satisfactory condition. Most were straight and vertical. 
For the most part, the tops and bottoms of the posts have been customarily connected. It 
appeared, however, that one post toward the front of the garage, which originally supported 
the overhead girder, had been removed several years ago. No related structural movement 
was visible. Contact a structural engineer if further evaluation is desired.
 
Three or four garage joists were some cause for concern, apparently damaged by 
questionable performance when previous trades inappropriately notched the bottoms of these 
structural members for pipe installations. Framing can easily be supplemented with new 
supporting members.
 
Most of the structural posts, beams, plates, and studs had not yet been retrofitted for 
earthquake preparedness. Prior to or after sale, these measures should be taken, Corrective 
recommendations should come from a qualified, licensed, structural engineer.
 
Moisture staining was found on the garage walls and ceiling. These areas were dry to the 
touch and, when tested with a biprobe electric moisture meter, were absolutely dry. 
 
The subarea should have additional cross-ventilation (screen and louvered) installed to 
reduce damp wood deterioration, control moisture and condensation, and aid in the complete 
combustion of gas-fueled appliances in these areas. Remember, Red, to uncover the garage 
door vents.
Main Structure
No evidence of current structural movement was noted during inspection of samplings of 
doors, windows, floors, walls, and ceilings. The tops of some doors were taper-cut to allow for 
wall shifting over the years. Any separations on walls, molding, or ceilings, or sagging or 
sloping for floors, appeared to be the result of ordinary shifting and/or expansion within 
framing and supporting soils. In WCIS’s opinion, the findings do not represent significant, 
current movement. 
Attic Area
An attic access door was in the garage loft ceiling. It was painted shut, preventing inspection. 
Make access available for the upcoming “buyer’s inspections” and fully determine conditions 
therein.  
 
 
¸Make the subarea accessible for upcoming prepurchase inspections.
 
 
¸Add supplemental members to the notched joists. 
 
 
¸Seismically retrofit some or all structural posts, beams, plates, and studs for  
 
 
 
earthquake preparedness. 
 
 
¸Improve ventilation throughout the subarea. 
 
 
¸Free the attic access door for subsequent inspections.

SECURITY AND FIRE SAFETY
WCIS has some fire-safety concerns about this property. Subarea wall and ceiling surfaces in 
mechanical rooms (housing the furnace and water heater) adjacent to habitable rooms were 
not completely fire-resistant. Neither was the door from the garage to habitable spaces 
upstairs. Fully separate the mechanical rooms from habitable ones (e.g., by patching all 
openings with drywall, plaster, sheet metal, and so on or undertaking appropriate fire-resistant 
construction). Line the door’s inside face with fire-resistive drywall and install a tightly sealed 
automatic door closer.
 
WCIS was unable to locate any smoke detectors or sprinklers in this area. A monitored 
alarm system with adequate smoke and heat detectors could be installed. 
 
Smoke detectors were on each level’s hallway ceilings, however, each was without its 
require battery. Because state and local codes change frequently, consult the building 
department for direction on optimal number, type, and location of units when selling a 
property. 
 
The building’s front, side, and rear doors were each equipped with a lock and deadbolt. 
Unfortunately, the front entry deadbolt was a “double-keyed” type - a key for the inside as well 
as the outside of the lock is required. If these keys are no easily accessible, emergency 
egress could be impossible, and bear serious safety consequences. Conversion to single-
keyed bolts is easy, affordable, and should be considered before showing the property to 
buyers. Contact a locksmith.
 
Glass in the sliding glass doors had glazing labels. Front door glazing did not appear to have 
a glazing label certifying specification (e.g., tempered, safety, etc.). Door and window panes 
without safety glazing can be hazardous when broken, so current building code requires 
safety-labeled glass to minimize possible injury. Replacement of this glazing may not now be 
required; however, install decals and exercise caution and common sense in this area to 
prevent accidental breakage and possible bodily injury. 
 
Means of egress from the basement bedroom was of concern. Two windows had iron bars 
installed across them that prevent emergency egress. These should be removed prior to 
showing. 
 
Supplement interior and exterior lighting for overall security and safety. 
 
 
¸Provide and install needed fire-protection devices or systems.
 
 
¸Immediately provide the smoke detectors with fresh batteries.
 
 
¸Improve door-lock safety. 
 
 
¸Remove the permanently installed iron-bar window coverings.
 
 
¸Add lighting for overall security and safety.  
PLUMBING
Water Supply
The shutoff valve for the main water-service line was on a garage front wall. It was operable; 
no leakage was detected.
 
A 1-inch galvanized iron water line joined the building from the street. Domestic hot- and 
cold-water-supply lines were mostly made of iron. WCIS found a combination of iron and 
copper water lines next to the garage stairway. Its plumbing connection was inappropriate,

likely contributing to galvanic corrosion within these lines. It would be easy to install a 
di-electric fitting between iron and copper to separate these dissimilar metals.
 
Measured at the side of the garage, static pressure on the water line was 108 pounds per 
square inch (PSI), which is excessive. Prescribed water-pressure-ratings are set at 55 to 65 
PSI to prevent leakage from excessive pressures. A water-pressure regulator and pressure 
gauge on the incoming water line recommended.
 
The garage hose Bibb leaked when tested; washer replacement may be all that is needed.
 
Part of the hot-water piping in the water heater area had no thermal insulation. Full 
insulation would reduce energy consumption and improve the hot-response time for each 
water fixture.
 
Inspecting and test drip-irrigation, sprinkler, or low-voltage systems is not included in 
ASHI(r) inspection practices. 
Vents, Drains, and Traps
Throughout much of this structure, visible waste and vent piping were made of iron as well as 
copper. There was no evidence of leakage in visibly accessible waste lines.
 
A number of drains were inspected and maintaining an effective trap-seal with water.
Gas Supply
The main gas-shutoff valve, located on the front wall, was operable. 
 
 
¸Add a di-electric fitting to separate iron and copper piping.
 
 
¸Install a water-pressure regulator and pressure gauge on the incoming water line. 
 
 
¸Replace the washer on the leaking garage hosebibb. 
Water Heater
The hot water heater, gas-fueled and located in the garage, was operating during inspection. 
It had no thermal insulation jacket which would be easy to add before showing the property to 
buyers.
 
The water heater also lacked adequate cross-strapping and restraining blocks designed to 
resist movement during an intense earthquake. (See the accompanying pamphlet on water 
heater bracing.)
 
It was apparently a recently installed model. With a fiberglass tank, an identification plate 
indicated that this A.O. Smith appliance had a 40-gallon capacity, a setting of 38,000 BTUs, and 
a 40.4-gallon-per-hour recovery rating.
 
Its tank bottom was slightly rusty. No leaks were evident.
 
A safety valve on water heater tops, referred to as a “temperature and pressure relief 
valve,” is necessary to the operation of these appliances. The T&PR valve was properly 
located. A water overflow tube was installed according to accepted trade practices. 
 
The shutoff valve on the cold-water supply piping was operational and no leakage was 
evident.
 
Hot-water piping immediately above the water heater had some thermal wrapping, 
however, an “energy inspection” is not within the scope of our inspections.

A drain valve at the base of the heater tank, when opened, showed minimal sludge 
deposits. 
 
As a standard earthquake-preparedness consideration before transferring title, some or all 
of the following installations could be undertaken:
 
a. Flexible water-supply piping to water heaters
 
b. Fully functional seismic cross-strapping (see enclosed WCIS brochure), and 
 
c. Flexible gas-supply piping to heaters and all gas-fueled appliances.
 
 
¸Install a thermal insulation jacket.
 
 
¸Provide and install bracing and strapping.
LAUNDRY
Laundry equipment was in the unfinished basement. The washer and dryer were the 
side-by-side type. Testing appliances is outside the scope of ASHI(r) inspections. 
 
Water supply hoses to the washer were holding pressure and not leaking.
 
The washer’s drain hose was simply hung over the ledge of the laundry sink and, under 
pressure, could fall off. Secure the hose with tape or wire.
 
The dryer was fueled by natural gas. Its lint-exhaust hose was connected well to an 
exterior vent cowl. 
 
 
¸Tape or wire the drain hose securely.
ELECTRICAL
Service and the Main Disconnect
Electrical wiring for this building was fed from underground and provided approximately 240 
volts to the meter. The main disconnect switch and panel, located on the right side of the 
building, had a 125-amp circuit breaker as the overcurrent device for the building, protecting 
#2-guage copper conductors.
 
Ampacity (the service entrance capacity) was adequate, based on the building’s current 
load-demands.
Subpanel Distribution
The building’s main disconnect device was combined in a panel with other circuits. There was 
also a subpanel on a garage side wall. 
 
Protected by circuit breakers, the combined main-disconnect-and-distribution panel had 
the following circuitry distribution:
 
 
 
4 
@ 120-volt circuits at 15 amps
 
 
 
14 
@ 120-volt circuits at 20 amps
 
 
 
3 
@ 240-volt circuits at 20 amps
 
 
 
2 
@ 240-volt circuits at 30 amps
 
 
 
1 
@ 240-volt circuits at 70 amps

            xx, xxxx
 
The subpanel also contained circuit breakers for branch circuitry. Its distribution was:
 
 
 
 
 
6 
@ 120-volt circuits at 15 amps
 
 
 
2 
@ 120-volt circuits at 20 amps
 
Inspected circuitry in each panel was adequately wired for current electrical demands. 
Neither subpanel was fully circuit-labeled but they should be before showing the property. 
 
Both panels were benefited by closed-front protection covers.
Grounding and Polarity
Of course, all electrical systems should be safely and properly grounded. An appropriately 
driven grounding rod was not easily located, however, the system ground wire provided at 
least minimal grounding levels where sample-tested. A number of convenience receptacles in 
the kitchen, bathrooms, laundry, basement, and garage provided grounding protection. 
Wiring
Much of the basement’s exposed writing has been piped into conduit. The following is only a 
sampling of wiring concerns and is not intended to take the place of an electrical contractor’s 
findings:
 
 
a. In a random sampling of receptacles, “reverse polarity” was found to the right  
 
 
 
of  the kitchen sink. This condition, hazardous in certain instances, can be easily  
 
 
 
corrected and should be.
 
 
b. Sample testing receptacles and switches revealed a loose installation in the  
 
 
 
master bedroom. Because outlet movement permits disconnection of power and  
 
 
 
grounding protection, a licensed electrician should examine and service all loose  
 
 
 
installations to provide the maximum amount of safety.
 
 
c. The powder room’s 3-slot receptacle was not grounded and should be to provide  
 
 
 
full protection.
 
 
d. Detection or evaluation of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) is not a part of our  
 
 
 
industry’s Standards of Practice and is not included.
All of the above wiring and grounding items should be remedied immediately to prevent 
accidental injury. 
 
Warren Camp always recommends the installation of ground-fault and circuit-interruption-
type receptacles in kitchens, bathrooms, and other wet locations as an added safety measure. 
None were as yet installed.
 
 
 ¸Provide panels with complete circuit identification.
 
 
¸Remedy immediately the wiring problems.
 
 
¸Install ground-fault circuit-interruption-type receptacles in all wet locations.
HEATING
Heat Source Types and Condition

installed several years ago. Its control chamber and flue diverter were extremely dirty and 
should be vacuumed as soon as possible.
 
As expected, a heater of this age would have no pilot-light safety device to stop the pilot’s 
gas flow if the flame accidentally blew out. 
 
Vent and Flue Piping
The flue was encased within the wall. Inaccessible portions of flue piping were not inspected. 
There was nothing on the wall to suggest inadequacy.
Heat Exchanger
This heater’s gas burners appeared to be out of balance with unusual flame characteristics. 
Unevenness is difficult for anyone but a heating contractor or utility company technician to 
analyze. Such a check-up should be made. 
 
The firebox (heat exchanger) of this heater separates and redirects hot air from ambient air, 
which it also warms and circulates. A full inspection of a heat exchanger is not possible 
without dismantling a heater which was not done. There was also no access for an inspection 
mirror. The local utility or a heating contractor should conduct a standard safety check of this 
and all gas appliances, supply lines, and flues at every change of occupancy.
 
 
 
¸Vacuum the control chamber thoroughly as well as the flue diverter.
 
 
¸Ask the local utility or a heating contractor to conduct a standard test and safety  
 
 
    check of all gas-fueled appliances, supply lines, and flues. 
INTERIOR
Interior spaces were fully furnished at inspection, some areas were inaccessible and not 
inspected. Generally, walls, ceilings, and floors were well maintained. The inspection industry 
does not report on cosmetic details.
 
There were water stains in a few locations. Two window walls of the attic loft and one living 
room bay window wall were noticeably stained, indicating possible leakage or condensation. 
However, when tested with an electric biprobe moisture meter, it was determined conclusively 
that there was no moisture retention and this staining was historic. 
 
Much of the upper-level flooring was carpeted. Uncovered hardwood flooring on the first 
level was adequately maintained.
 
Wood-framed windows on the rear wall should be repaired. Some window locks and 
hardware need adjustment while some double-hung sashes had broken wires. Generally, any 
broken, deteriorated, and/or missing door and window locks and components, even though 
not specifically called out in this report, should be replaced or repaired.
 
 
¸Repair windows, doors, and hardware as needed.
KITCHEN
The kitchen was well maintained. The sink, faucet, trap and drain, and shutoff valves were 
working when tested. Water pressure was adequate.

The dishwasher did have an anti-siphoning device and was well secured to the underside 
of the counter. An anti-siphoning device, installed above the sink rim, prevents backflow of 
waste products into the clean dishwasher appliance if the sewer system is blocked. 
 
Stained-wood cabinets were in satisfactory condition; however, only a sampling of doors, 
drawers, and connections was made.
 
Plastic-laminate counters were also in satisfactory condition. Two miter joints were slightly 
open and should be fully sealed with a good quality caulking.
 
A ducted exhaust fan on the ceiling was operational but the fan motor drew air weakly and 
may be grease-bound. For an efficient exchange of air, clean, repair, or replace components 
as needed.
 
Not recently installed, the ceramic tile floor was well maintained.
 
 
¸Seal the countertop’s miter joints with a good quality caulking.
 
 
¸Clean, repair, or replace exhaust fan components.
BATHROOM
This building had two bathrooms, a powder room, and vanity closet. All of the rooms were well 
maintained. Sinks, faucets, traps and drains, and angle stops worked well when tested.
 
The angle stop (shutoff valve) for the master bathroom washbasin was dripping slowly and 
requires adjustment and/or washer replacement. 
 
Water pressure was adequate at each fixture, however, measurement is only a relative 
comparison rating. 
 
No evidence of significant or unusual deterioration was evident on visible drain lines and 
trap piping. Tested drains ran freely.
 
Toilets in each bathroom were well secured to the floor. Support screws inside the guest 
bathroom’s wall-mounted toilet tank were extremely rusted and should be replaced immedi-
ately. 
 
Grout or caulking was missing around bathroom tub-to-tile connections and should be 
caulked. 
 
 
¸Correct the leaking valve.
 
 
¸Replace the deteriorated toilet tank’s mounting screws immediately.
 
 
¸Apply caulking where needed.
ROOFING
Accessibility and Warranty
The shingle roof was very steep, and the inspector did not walk on it. Inspection was strictly 
visual, made through nearby attic windows, and from the adjacent deck and street levels in 
the neighborhood. Only the general condition of visible roofing surfaces was observed. This 
report does not provide an opinion on, or a warranty against, past present, or future leakage.
Membrane Types and Condition
Asphalt-composition-type shingling was recently installed. No distinct failures were

detectable to visual inspection. There was little or no evidence of unusual or significant roof 
deterioration. 
Chimneys, Gutters, and Flashing
Two metal chimneys at the right property line were elevated well above the roof line, lacking 
adequate seismic strapping or bracing. Chimney guy wires or bracing were missing but could 
easily be added.
 
Debris in the right-hand Dutch gutter (the common roof gutter between adjacent properties) 
must be immediately removed. Gutter outlets at the tops of downspouts should have mesh 
screening installed to prevent clogging. 
 
The downspout system was, for the most part, customarily installed. One downspout at the 
front wall likely dumps water directly onto the foundation and garden area below, which can 
cause erosion. A splash block should be set at the downspout base to divert this collected 
water away from the building.
 
The following additional items were also observed:
 
 
a. A metal antenna that was considerably rusted was loosely connected to the  
 
 
 
chimney and should be removed and discarded.
 
 
b. The front firewall had separations and needs to be sealed.
 
 
c. Vent and perimeter flashing which is unsealed needs the immediate attention  
 
 
 
of a roofer. 
Roofs are seldom, if ever, regularly inspected. Regardless of whether a WCIS roof inspection 
was made, roofing problems are often subtle and difficult to evaluate. Because property 
inspectors don’t often have the hands-on training and accessibility roofers have, whenever 
questions of adequacy of roofing arise, a licensed roofing contractor could be asked to 
provide a thorough inspection and evaluation. 
 
 
¸Add chimney guy wires or bracing.
 
 
¸Clean the debris from the right-hand Dutch gutter and insert outlet screens.
 
 
¸Place a splash block at the base of the front downspout.
 
 
¸Remove and dispose of the metal antenna. 
 
 
¸Reseal the firewall sections and flashing

Appendix C
Glossary
T
erms appearing in italic type within the definitions are defined elsewhere
in the glossary. 
acceleration clause: In a mortgage
contract, this provision gives the
lender the right to demand payment
of the entire outstanding balance if a
homeowner misses a monthly pay-
ment, sells the property, or otherwise
fails to perform as promised under
the terms of the mortgage. (See also
due-on-sale clause.)
adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): An
ARM is a mortgage whose interest
rate and monthly payments vary
throughout its life. Usually, the ARM’s
interest rate is tied to an index, which
measures the overall market level of
interest rates. If the overall level of
interest rates rises, the interest rate
of an ARM generally follows suit.
Similarly, if interest rates fall, so does
the mortgage’s interest rate and
monthly payment. The amount that
the interest rate can fluctuate is
limited by caps (see also periodic
caps and lifetime caps). Before you
agree to an adjustable-rate mortgage,
be sure that you can afford the
highest payments that would result if
the interest rate on your mortgage
increased to the maximum allowed.
For specifics on how an ARM’s interest
rate is calculated, see formula and
teaser rate.
adjusted cost basis: The adjusted
cost basis is important when you
sell your house because this amount
allows you to determine your profit
or loss for tax purposes. You can
arrive at the adjusted cost basis by
adding the cost of the capital improve-
ments that you’ve made to the home
to the price that you originally paid
for the home. Capital improvements,
such as adding rooms or remodeling
a bathroom, increase your property’s
value and its life expectancy.
Repairs that merely maintain the
value of your home, such as fixing a
leaky pipe, aren’t considered capital
improvements.
adjusted sale price: An adjusted
sale price is the actual selling price
of a house less the expenses of sale,
such as real estate agents’ commis-
sions, legal fees, and so on.
adjustment period or adjustment
frequency: This term refers to how
often the interest rate for an
adjustable-rate mortgage changes.
Some adjustable-rate mortgages
change every month, but one or two
adjustments per year is more typical.
The less frequently your loan rate
shifts, the less financial uncertainty
you face. But less frequent adjust-
ments in your mortgage rate mean

that you will probably have a higher
teaser or initial interest rate. (The
initial interest rate is also called the
“start rate.”)
annual percentage rate (APR): The
APR measures the total cost of a
mortgage, assuming that the bor-
rower holds it for its entire life. It’s
expressed as an annualized rate of
all interest charges — which includes
not only the base interest rate
reflected in the monthly mortgage 
payments but also the points and any
other add-on, upfront loan fees —
spread out over the life of the loan.
The APR is thus invariably higher
than the rate of interest that the
lender quotes for the mortgage, but
it gives a more accurate picture of
the likely cost of the mortgage. Keep
in mind, however, that most mort-
gages aren’t held for their full 15- or
30-year terms, so the effective
annual percentage rate is higher
than the quoted APR because the
upfront fees are spread out over
fewer years.
appraisal: Mortgage lenders require
an appraiser to give an opinion of
the market value of a house a home-
owner wants to sell or refinance.
This professional opinion helps to
protect the lender from lending
money on a house that’s worth less
than the amount the buyers have
agreed to pay for it or that the seller
wishes to obtain when refinancing
the existing loan. For typical houses,
the appraisal fee is several hundred
dollars and is usually paid for by the
borrower.
appreciation/depreciation:
Appreciation refers to the increase
of a property’s value. Depreciation
(the reverse of appreciation) is
when a property’s value decreases.
arbitration (of disputes): This
method of solving real estate
contract disputes is generally less
costly and faster than having lawyers
duke it out in a court of law. In
arbitration, the dissenting sides
each present their perspectives to a
neutral arbitrator who, after hearing
the evidence, makes a decision that
resolves the disagreement. The arbi-
trator’s decision is final and may 
be enforced as if it were a court
judgment. Consult a real estate
lawyer if you’re ever a party in an
arbitration. (See also mediation.)
“as is”: If you’re selling a property
“as is,” you aren’t providing any
guarantees or warranties to the
buyer as to the condition of the
property and won’t make further
allowances, credits, or price 
reductions for any problems with
your property.
assessed value: The assessed value
is the value of a property for the
purpose of determining property
taxes. This figure depends on the
methodology used by the local tax
assessor and, thus, may differ from
the appraised or market value of the
property.
assumable mortgage: Some mort-
gages don’t require a borrower to
pay off the outstanding balance after
the house sells. Instead, the new
owner can simply take over the
remaining loan balance and continue
making payments under the loan’s
original terms. This arrangement
benefits the buyers if the assumable
mortgage has a lower interest rate
than the current going interest rate
322
Part VI: Appendixes 

for new loans. Most assumables are
adjustable-rate mortgages. Fixed-
rate, assumable mortgages are
nearly extinct these days because
lenders realize that they lose money
on such mortgages when interest
rates soar.
balloon loan: This kind of loan
requires level payments just as a 15-
or 30-year fixed-rate mortgage does.
However, well before the loan’s
maturity date — the date when it
would normally be paid off if the
borrower kept making those fixed,
monthly payments (typically three
to ten years after its start date) —
the full remaining balance of a 
balloon loan becomes due and
payable. Although balloon loans can
save you money because they charge
a lower rate of interest relative to
fixed-rate loans, balloon loans are
dangerous. If you don’t have a big
chunk of cash sitting around some-
where to pay off the outstanding bal-
ance, you’ll be forced to refinance
the loan. Refinancing a loan is never
a sure thing because your employ-
ment and financial situation may
change, and interest rates may
fluctuate. Beware of balloon loans!
bridge loan: If you find yourself in
the inadvisable situation of having
closed on the purchase of another
home before you sell your current
one, you may need a bridge loan.
Such a loan enables you to borrow
against the equity that is tied up in
your old house until it sells. The
bridge loan is aptly named because
such a loan may keep home buyers
financially above water during this
period when they own two houses.
Bridge loans are expensive com-
pared to other alternatives, such as
tapping into savings, borrowing
from family or friends, or using the
proceeds from the sale of the current
house. In most cases, home buyers
need the bridge loan for only a few
months in order to tide them over
until they sell their house. Thus, the
loan fees can represent a high cost
(about 10 percent of the loan amount)
for such a short-term loan.
broker: A real estate broker is one
level higher on the real estate pro-
fessional totem pole than the real
estate agent (or salesperson). Real
estate agents can’t legally work on
their own; a broker must supervise
them. To become a broker in most
states, a real estate salesperson
must have a number of years of full-
time real estate experience, meet
special educational requirements,
and pass a state-licensing exam. See
also real estate agent and Realtor.
buydown: In a buydown, the builder
or house seller agrees to pay part of
the home buyer’s mortgage for the
first few years. The term also refers
to the practice of a seller paying a
mortgage lender a predetermined
amount of money to reduce his or
her mortgage interest rate, thereby
creating more attractive financing
for a potential buyer. Veterans with
low or modest incomes may be able
to get buydowns through a Veterans
Administration loan plan that’s 
available in some new housing
developments.
buyer’s broker: Historically, real
estate brokers and agents worked
only for sellers. A buyer’s broker, on
the other hand, only owes allegiance
to the buyer and doesn’t have an
agent relationship with the seller.
323
Appendix C: Glossary

Buyer’s brokers, however, are generally
paid on a commission basis, so they still
have the same conflict of interest other
commissioned real estate agents have —
the higher the price of your next home,
the more money the buyer’s broker makes
because a broker’s commission is based
on a percentage of the purchase price of
the home you buy.
capital gain: A capital gain is the profit, as
defined for tax purposes, that a home-
owner makes when he sells a house. For
example, if you buy a house for $200,000
and then sell the house years later for
$240,000, your capital gain is $40,000. See
capital gains exclusion.
capital gains exclusion: Normally, a capi-
tal gain generated by selling an asset is
taxable. Thanks to the Taxpayer Relief Act
of 1997, however, subject to meeting par-
ticular requirements, a significant portion
of your gain on the sale of a primary resi-
dence is excludable from tax: up to
$250,000 for single taxpayers and $500,000
for married couples filing jointly.
caps: Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
specify two different types of caps or
limits on how much the interest rate of an
ARM can move up or down. The life cap
limits the highest or lowest interest rate
that’s allowed over the entire life of a mort-
gage. The periodic cap limits the amount
that an interest rate can change in one
adjustment period. A one-year ARM, for
example, may have a start rate of 6.5 per-
cent with a plus or minus 2-percent peri-
odic adjustment cap and a 6-percent life
cap. In a worst-case scenario, the loan’s
interest rate would be 8.5 percent in the
second year, 10.5 percent in the third year,
and 12.5 percent (6.5 percent start rate
plus the 6-percent life cap) every year after
that. If you were that unlucky, though,
we’d recommend seeing an astrologer.
cash reserve: Most mortgage lenders
require that home buyers have sufficient
cash left over after closing on their home
purchase to make the first two mortgage
payments or to cover a financial emergency.
As a seller, if you’re providing financing to
the buyers, you should insist on this
requirement, too.
closing costs: Closing costs generally total
about 2 to 5 percent of the home’s pur-
chase price and include the loan origina-
tion fee or points, appraisal fee, credit
report fee, mortgage interest for the period
between the closing date and the first
mortgage payment, homeowners insurance
premium, title insurance, pro-rated prop-
erty taxes, and recording and transferring
charges. Despite the fact that a buyer
needs a down payment to close on a home
purchase, closing costs, technically speak-
ing, don’t include the cash down payment,
which is considered to be a separate item.
Don’t neglect to consider these costs
when weighing the purchase of your next
dream home.
commission: Commission is the percent-
age of the selling price of a house that’s
paid to the real estate agents and brokers.
For a house seller, the fact that the more
the house fetches, the more agents get
paid is good — this arrangement incites
agents to go for the highest possible sale
price for a house (unless selling at a lower
price may result in a quicker sale).
Remember that commissions are always
negotiable.
common areas: Common areas are the
shared ownership portions of a condo-
minium complex (such as the lobby, recre-
ational areas, parking lot, underlying land
on which buildings are located, and so on).
community property: Community property
is a way that married couples may take
324
Part VI: Appendixes 

title to real estate. Community property
offers two major advantages over joint ten-
ancy and tenancy-in-common. First, com-
munity property ownership allows either
spouse to transfer interests, by last will
and testament or otherwise, to whomever
he or she wishes. Second, if one spouse
dies, the cost basis of the entire house is
“stepped up” (increased) to equal its cur-
rent market value for the surviving spouse.
Assuming that the house has appreciated
in value since it was originally purchased,
this “stepped-up basis” reduces the tax-
able profit owed when the house is sold.
comparable market analysis (CMA): A
written analysis of comparable houses
currently being offered for sale and com-
parable houses that sold in the past six
months is called a comparable market
analysis (CMA). In order to price your
house appropriately, you need to know
how much houses like yours are selling
for. Identify houses “comparable” to yours
that sold within the last six months, are in
the immediate vicinity of your house, and
are as similar as possible to your house in
terms of size, age, and condition. By ana-
lyzing the asking prices of houses compa-
rable to yours that are currently on the
market, you can see whether prices are
rising, flat, or declining.
condominium: Condominiums are hous-
ing units within a larger development area
in which you own your own unit, plus a
proportionate share of the development’s
common areas: the lobby, elevator, parking
lot, and so on. Condominiums are a less-
expensive form of housing than single-
family homes. However, condominiums
generally don’t increase in value as
rapidly as single-family houses do because
the demand for condos is lower than the
demand for houses. And because condo-
miniums are far easier for builders to
develop than single-family homes are, the
supply of condominiums often exceeds
the demand for them. (Cool cats call con-
dominiums “condos.”)
contingency: Contingencies are conditions
contained in almost all home purchase
offers. The seller or buyer must meet or
waive all contingencies before the deal can
be closed. These conditions relate to such
factors as the buyer’s review and approval
of property inspections or the buyer’s abil-
ity to get the mortgage financing that’s
specified in the contract. Sellers may
include contingencies as well, such as
making the sale of their house contingent
on their successful purchase of another
home. If a contingency can’t be met, the
party for whom it was established may
legitimately withdraw from a contract.
convertible adjustable-rate mortgage:
Unlike a conventional adjustable-rate mort-
gage, a convertible adjustable-rate mort-
gage gives borrowers the option to
convert to a fixed-rate mortgage, usually
between the 13th and 60th month of the
loan. For this privilege, convertible
adjustable-rate mortgage loans have a
higher rate of interest than conventional
adjustable-rate mortgages, and a conver-
sion fee is charged (the fee can range from
a few hundred dollars to one percent or so
of the remaining balance). Additionally, if
borrowers choose to convert to a fixed-
rate mortgage, they pay a slightly higher
rate than they can get by shopping around
for the best fixed rates available at the
time they convert.
cooperative (co-op): These buildings
aren’t to be confused with “communes,”
which are places in Oregon where hippies
hang out together. Cooperatives are apart-
ment buildings where residents own a
share of a corporation whose main asset
is the building that the residents live in. In
high-cost housing areas, cooperatives
(like their cousins, condominiums and
townhouses) are cheaper alternatives to
325
Appendix C: Glossary

buying single-family houses. Unfortunately,
cooperatives also resemble their cousins
in that they generally lag behind single-
family homes in terms of appreciation. Co-
ops are also, as a rule, harder to sell and
obtain loans for than condominiums.
cosigner: If you have a checkered past in
the credit world, you may need help
securing a mortgage, even though you’re
financially stable. A friend or relative can
come to your rescue by cosigning, which
literally means being indebted for, a mort-
gage. A cosigner can’t improve your credit
report but can improve your chances of
getting a mortgage. Cosigners should be
aware, however, that cosigning for your
loan adversely affects their future credit-
worthiness because your loan becomes
what’s known as a contingent liability
against their borrowing power.
cost basis: See adjusted cost basis.
covenants, conditions, and restrictions
(CC&Rs): CC&Rs establish a condominium
by creating a homeowners association, by
stipulating how the condominium’s main-
tenance and repairs are handled, and by
regulating what can and can’t be done to
individual units and the condominium’s
common areas. These restrictions may
apply to lawn maintenance, window cur-
tain colors, pet ownership, and whether
residents can hang wet underwear on
their decks.
credit report: A credit report is the main
report that a lender uses to determine an
applicant’s creditworthiness. Applicants
must pay for a lender to obtain this
report, which the lender uses to deter-
mine the applicant’s ability to handle all
forms of credit and to pay off loans in a
timely fashion. If you provide financing to
the buyer of your property, be sure to first
run a credit report on the buyer/borrower.
debt-to-income ratio: Before you trade up
to a more expensive home, determine your
price range. Lenders generally figure that
you shouldn’t spend more than about 33
to 40 percent of your monthly income for
your housing costs. The debt-to-income
ratio measures your future monthly housing
expenses, which include your proposed
mortgage payment (debt), property tax,
and insurance, in relation to your monthly
income.
deed: A deed is the document that transfers
title to real property. Before you can give a
buyer the deed to your property, you must
show that you hold clear and legal title to
the property. Also, the escrow holder must
receive the mortgage company’s payment
and the buyer’s payments for the down
payment and closing costs.
default: You default if you violate the
terms of your mortgage agreement. In
most cases, missing two or more monthly
mortgage payments triggers default.
Defaulting can lead to foreclosure on your
house.
delinquency: Delinquency occurs when a
monthly mortgage payment isn’t received
by the due date. At first borrowers are
delinquent; then they’re in default.
depreciation: See appreciation.
disclosure statement: See transfer disclo-
sure statement.
down payment: The down payment is the
part of the purchase price that the buyer
pays in cash, up front, and doesn’t finance
with a mortgage. Generally, the larger the
down payment, the better the deal that
the buyer can get on a mortgage. In most
cases, a down payment equal to 20 per-
cent of the property’s purchase price qual-
ifies a buyer for the best available
mortgage programs.
326
Part VI: Appendixes 

due-on-sale clause: A due-on-sale clause
contained in the mortgage entitles the
lender to demand full payment of all
money due on a loan secured by the prop-
erty when a borrower sells or transfers
title to the property.
earnest money: Earnest money is a home
buyer’s “good faith” deposit that accom-
panies a written purchase offer.
earthquake insurance: Californians aren’t
the only people who have to worry about
the ground shaking; other areas in the
United States are also prone to earth-
quakes. The dwelling coverage of most
homeowners insurance policies doesn’t
cover damage caused by an earthquake, so
homeowners must purchase an earthquake
insurance rider to their homeowners policy
or a separate earthquake policy to protect
them from this risk.
encumbrance: An encumbrance is a right
or interest someone else holds in a home-
owner’s property that affects its title or
limits its use. A mortgage, for example, is
a money encumbrance that affects a
property’s title by making it security for
repayment of the loan. A right-of-way for
someone to pass over land or an ease-
ment granted to the local utility company
to run sewer lines under a property are
examples of non-money encumbrances.
equity: Equity is the difference between
the market value of a house and the
amount the homeowner owes on it. For
example, if your house is worth $230,000
and you have an outstanding mortgage of
$160,000, your equity is $70,000.
escrow: Escrow is the holding — by a
neutral third party called, naturally, an
escrow officer — of important documents
and money related to the sale of a house.
After a seller accepts a buyer’s offer to pur-
chase property, the buyer doesn’t immedi-
ately move in. A period follows when con-
tingencies have to be met or waived.
During this period, the escrow service holds
the buyer’s down payment and documents
pertaining to the sale. “Closing escrow”
means that the deal is completed. Among
other duties, the escrow officer makes sure
that all the players in the transaction —
mortgage companies, real estate agents,
and, of course, the seller — are paid the
amount that’s due them.
exclusive agency listing: An exclusive
agency listing is a listing contract between
property owners and a real estate broker
that’s very similar to an exclusive right to
sell listing except that the property
owners specifically reserve the right to
sell the house themselves without com-
pensating the listing broker if they find the
buyer. (See also listing contract.)
exclusive right-to-sell: An exclusive right-
to-sell listing is a listing contract between
a property owner and a real estate broker
in which the property owner agrees to
compensate the listing broker if anyone,
including the property owner, sells the
house during the listing period. (See also
listing contract.)
fair market value (FMV): FMV is the price
a market-educated buyer will pay and a
market-savvy seller will accept for prop-
erty given that neither the seller nor the
buyer is under duress caused by a
divorce, an unanticipated job transfer, or
some other circumstance that puts either
party under pressure to perform quickly.
Fannie Mae: See Federal National
Mortgage Association.
Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corporation (FHLMC): The FHLMC (or
Freddie Mac) is one of the best-known
institutions in the secondary mortgage
market. Freddie Mac buys mortgages from
327
Appendix C: Glossary

banks and other mortgage-lending 
institutions and, in turn, sells these mort-
gages to investors. These loan invest-
ments are considered safe because
Freddie Mac buys mortgages only from
companies that conform to its stringent
mortgage regulations, and Freddie Mac
guarantees the repayment of principal and
interest on the mortgages that it sells.
Federal Housing Administration (FHA)
mortgage: FHA mortgages are marketed to
people with modest means. The main
advantage of these mortgages is that they
require a small down payment (usually
between 3 and 5 percent of a home’s
purchase price). FHA mortgages also offer
competitive interest rates — typically 0.5
to 1 percent below the interest rates on
other mortgages. The downside of an FHA
mortgage is that the buyer must purchase
mortgage default insurance (see private
mortgage insurance).
Federal National Mortgage Association
(FNMA): The FNMA (or Fannie Mae) is one
of the best-known institutions in the sec-
ondary mortgage market. Fannie Mae
buys mortgages from banks and other
mortgage-lending institutions and, in turn,
sells them to investors. These loan invest-
ments are considered safe because Fannie
Mae buys mortgages only from companies
that conform to its stringent mortgage reg-
ulations, and Fannie Mae guarantees the
repayment of principal and interest on the
loans that it sells.
fixed-rate mortgage: A fixed-rate mort-
gage lets you lock into an interest rate (for
example, 7.5 percent) that never changes
during the entire life (term) of a 15- or 30-
year mortgage. The mortgage payment is
the same amount each and every month.
Compare fixed-rate mortgages with
adjustable-rate mortgages.
flood insurance: If you suspect even a
remote chance that your area may flood,
having flood insurance is prudent. In 
federally designated flood areas, flood
insurance is required in order to obtain
conventional mortgage financing.
foreclosure: Foreclosure is the legal
process by which a mortgage lender takes
possession of and sells property to
attempt to satisfy indebtedness. If you
default on your loan and the lender deems
that you’re incapable of making payments,
you may lose your home to foreclosure.
Being in default, however, doesn’t always
lead to foreclosure. Some lenders are
lenient and help you work out a solution if
they see that your financial problems are
temporary.
formula: Formula is jargon for the method
used to calculate the revised interest rate on
an adjustable-rate mortgage. Add the margin
to the index to get the adjusted interest rate
(margin + index = interest rate).
Freddie Mac: See Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation.
For Sale By Owner (FSBO): A FSBO prop-
erty isn’t listed for sale through a real
estate broker. Instead the homeowner
tries to sell the home on his own.
graduated-payment mortgage: With a
graduated-payment mortgage, monthly
payments are increased by a predeter-
mined amount and schedule. For example,
your monthly payment increases 5 per-
cent annually for seven years. Thereafter,
your payments stay constant for the rest
of your loan’s term.
home-equity loan: A home-equity loan is
technical jargon for what used to be called
a second mortgage. With this type of loan,
a homeowner borrows against the equity
in her house. If used wisely, a home-equity
328
Part VI: Appendixes 

loan can pay off consumer debt, which is
usually at a higher interest rate than a
home-equity loan and isn’t tax-deductible.
Homeowners can also use home-equity
loans for other short-term needs, such as
for payments on a remodeling project.
homeowners insurance: This type of
insurance is required and necessary —
period. A homeowners insurance policy
protects what’s likely your most valuable
asset — your home. The most fundamen-
tal component of the policy is the
“dwelling coverage” that covers the cost
to repair or rebuild your house in the
event of fire, storm, or other insured real
property damage. The liability insurance
portion of this policy protects you against
accidents that occur on your property.
Another essential piece is the personal
property coverage that pays to replace
your lost worldly possessions and usually
totals 50 to 75 percent of the dwelling
coverage. Finally, get flood or earthquake
insurance if you’re in an area susceptible to
these natural disasters. As with other types
of insurance, get the highest deductibles
with which you are comfortable.
home warranty plan: A home warranty
plan is a type of insurance that covers
repairs to specific parts of a house for a
predetermined time period. Because home
warranty plans typically cover small-potato
items, such plans generally aren’t worth
buying. Instead, spend your money on a
good house inspection before you buy the
house in order to identify any major prob-
lems, such as trouble with electrical or
plumbing systems.
house inspection: Like homeowners insur-
ance, we think that a house inspection is a
necessity when you’re buying and a smart
thing to do when you’re selling. The follow-
ing items should be inspected: overall con-
dition of the property, inside and out;
electrical, heating, and plumbing systems;
foundation; roof; pest control and dry rot;
and seismic, slide risk. A good premarket-
ing house inspection can save you money
and negotiate hassles by helping you find
corrective work problems prior to putting
your house on the market so you have lead
time to either make the necessary repairs
or develop a plan for dealing with them.
hybrid loan: A hybrid loan combines the
features of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate
mortgages. The initial interest rate for a
hybrid loan may be fixed for the first three
to ten years of the loan (as opposed to
only six to twelve months for a standard
adjustable-rate mortgage), and then
adjusted biannually or annually. The longer
the initial interest rate remains the same,
the higher the interest rate is. These hybrid
loans are best for people who plan to own
their house for a short time (less than ten
years) and who don’t like the volatility of a
typical adjustable-rate mortgage.
index: An index measures the current
level of market interest rates. Adding the
index to the margin is the formula for
determining the specific interest rate on
an adjustable-rate mortgage. One index
used on some mortgages is the six-month
treasury bill. If the going rate for these
treasury bills is 6 percent and the margin
on your loan is 2.25 percent, your interest
rate is 8.25 percent. Other common
indexes used are certificates of deposit
index, the 11th District Cost of Funds
index, and the LIBOR index.
interest rate: Interest is what lenders
charge borrowers to use their money. The
greater the risk of not getting the money
back, the more a lender charges to use it.
In general, interest charges are accrued as
a percentage of the amount borrowed; that
percentage is known as the interest rate.
joint tenancy: Joint tenancy is a form of
co-ownership that gives each tenant equal
329
Appendix C: Glossary

interest and rights in the property, including
the right of survivorship. At the death of
one joint tenant, ownership automatically
transfers to the surviving joint tenant. This
form of ownership is most appropriate for
unmarried people. Some of the limitations
of joint tenancy are (first) that each person
must own an equal share of the house and
(second) that the right of survivorship is
terminated if one person transfers his or
her interest in the property by deed to a
third party.
lease-option: A property that tenants can
lease with an option to purchase at a later
date has a lease-option contract. These
contracts generally require an upfront
payment (called “option consideration”)
to secure the purchase option. The con-
sideration is usually credited toward the
down payment when the tenant exercises
his or her option to buy the home. An
important factor in a lease-option agree-
ment is what portion of the monthly rent
payments (typically one-third) is applied
toward the purchase price if the tenant
buys. Rent is usually slightly higher
because of the lease-option privilege.
leverage: Remember playing with levers in
high school physics? Using leverage, you
could exert a great deal of force with little
effort. Your flimsy-looking cash can also
function like a crowbar when you borrow
money to help you make an investment.
For example, suppose that you make a 20
percent down payment on a $200,000 house
and borrow the $160,000 difference. If you
consider the fact that you control a $160,000
property with only a $40,000 investment,
you can already see leverage at work. But
the potential power of that leverage comes
into play if the house appreciates — let’s 
say to $240,000. Now you’ve made a $40,000
profit on a $40,000 investment — a 100-
percent return, thanks to leveraging.
However, if you find that your house has
declined in value since you bought it,
you’re painfully aware that leverage cuts
both ways. (See also return on investment.)
lien: A misspelling of the word “line” (just
kidding). In real estate, a lien is a legal
claim or encumbrance on a property that’s
used as security for repayment of an out-
standing debt such as a mortgage, unpaid
taxes, money owed to a contractor, and so
on. Liens must be paid off before a prop-
erty can be sold or title transferred to a
subsequent buyer. The liens that are a
matter of public record appear on a
property’s preliminary report.
life cap: The total amount that an
adjustable-rate mortgage interest rate and
monthly payment can fluctuate up or
down during the duration of the loan is
determined by the life cap. The life cap is
different from the periodic cap that limits
the extent to which an interest rate can
change up or down in any one adjustment
period.
liquidated damages: In many real estate
contracts, buyers and sellers, at the begin-
ning of the transaction, agree on the liqui-
dated damages — how much money will
be awarded to one party if the other party
violates the terms of the contract without
good cause. Buyers, for example, gener-
ally limit their losses to the amount of
their deposit. Discuss the advisability of
using the liquidated damages provision
with a lawyer or real estate agent.
listing broker: The real estate broker who
lists a property for sale and who, if the
terms of the listing contract are satisfied,
will be compensated, typically in the form
of a commission on the selling price of the
house, when the property sells.
listing contract: This term is an employ-
ment contract between a property seller
330
Part VI: Appendixes 

and a real estate broker. Under the terms
of a listing contract, the property seller
agrees to compensate the broker for
procuring a ready, willing, and able buyer
for the property.
listing presentation: A proposal by a real
estate broker or agent outlining how a
property would be marketed and recom-
mending an asking price based on a com-
parable market analysis.
lock-in: A lock-in is a mortgage lender’s
written commitment to a specified interest
rate to the home buyer, provided that the
loan is closed within a set period of time.
The lock-in also usually specifies the
number of points to be paid at closing.
Most lenders don’t lock-in unless the
home buyer has made an offer on the
property, and the property has been
appraised. For the privilege of locking in
the rate in advance of the closing of a
loan, home buyers may pay a slight inter-
est rate premium.
margin: The margin is the amount that’s
added to the index in order to calculate
the interest rate for an adjustable-rate mort-
gage. Most loans have margins around 2.5
percent. Unlike the index (which constantly
moves up and down), the margin never
changes during the life of the loan. See 
formula.
market value: See fair market value.
marketable title: A title to property that’s
free and clear of objectionable liens and
encumbrances and thus acceptable to
buyers and mortgage lenders.
mechanic’s lien: An encumbrance filed on
title to a property by contractors or work-
men who claim that the owner still owes
them money for labor or materials
expended to improve the property.
mediation of disputes: Because mediation
is faster and less expensive than arbitration
or litigation in a court of law, mediation is
often the first formal step taken to resolve
simple contract disputes. In mediation,
buyers and sellers present their differences
to a neutral mediator who doesn’t have the
power to impose a settlement on either
party. Instead, the mediator helps buyers
and sellers work together to reach a mutu-
ally acceptable solution of their differences.
Statistically speaking, over 80 percent of the
cases that go through mediation are
resolved at that level. Parties who seek
mediation spare themselves the additional
time and money required to pursue their
differences in arbitration or a court of law.
(See also arbitration.)
mortgage broker: A mortgage broker
buys mortgages wholesale from lenders,
marks the mortgages up (typically from
0.5 to 1 percent), and then sells them to
buyers. A good mortgage broker is most
helpful for people who don’t shop around
on their own for a mortgage or for people
who have blemishes on their credit reports.
mortgage life insurance: Mortgage life
insurance guarantees that the lender will
get the loan money back in the sad event
that the borrower meets an untimely
demise. If you need life insurance, buy
low-cost, high-quality term life insurance
instead of mortgage life insurance, which
is basically overpriced term insurance. We
don’t recommend the purchase of mort-
gage life insurance.
multiple listing service (MLS): An MLS is a
cooperative arrangement among real estate
brokers in a particular area to share their
property listings with each other. Usually a
computer-based service, an MLS allows
member brokers and agents to track all
property listed for sale with cooperating
brokers who participate in the MLS.
331
Appendix C: Glossary

negative amortization: Although it sounds
like it, this term isn’t from science fiction.
Still, you can say that it describes a kind of
black hole. Negative amortization occurs
when an outstanding mortgage balance
increases despite the fact that the borrower
is making the required monthly payments.
Usually this condition only happens with
adjustable-rate mortgages that cap the
increase in the monthly payment but do not
cap the interest rate. Therefore, if the inter-
est rate rises high enough, the monthly
payments won’t cover all the interest that
the borrower actually owes. If you’ve ever
watched your credit card balance snowball
as you made only the minimum monthly
payment, then you already have experience
with this phenomenon. Avoid negative
amortization loans!
open listing: An open listing is a non-
exclusive listing contract that may be
given to any number of real estate bro-
kers. A seller is obligated to compensate
the first broker who either secures a
buyer ready, willing, and able to meet the
terms of the listing contract or procures
an acceptable offer. If the seller finds the
buyer, he or she doesn’t have to pay any
of the brokers a commission.
origination fee: See points.
partnership: A partnership is a way for
unmarried people to take title of a prop-
erty together. Partnerships most often
occur among people who have a business
relationship and who buy the property as
either a business asset or for investment
purposes. If you intend to buy property
with partners, have a real estate lawyer
prepare a written partnership agreement
for all the partners to sign before making
an offer to purchase.
periodic cap: This cap limits the amount
that the interest rate of an adjustable-rate
mortgage can change up or down in one
adjustment period. See also caps.
points: Also known as the loan’s origina-
tion fee, points are interest charges paid
upfront when a borrower closes on a loan.
The charges are calculated as a percent-
age of the total loan amount — one point
is equal to 1 percent of the loan amount.
For a $100,000 loan, one point costs
$1,000. Generally speaking, the more
points that a loan has, the lower its inter-
est rate should be. All the points that you
pay on a purchase mortgage are
deductible in the year that you pay them.
If you refinance your mortgage, however,
the points that you pay at the time that
you refinance must be amortized over the
life of the loan. If you get a 30-year mort-
gage when you refinance, for example, you
can deduct only one-thirtieth of the points
on your taxes each year.
prepayment penalty: One advantage of
most mortgages is that borrowers can
make additional payments to pay the loan
off faster if they have the inclination and
the money to do so. A prepayment penalty
discourages borrowers from doing this by
penalizing them for early payments. Some
states prohibit lenders from penalizing
people who prepay their loans. Avoid
mortgages that penalize prepayment!
principal: The principal is the original
amount that a person borrows for a loan.
If a home buyer borrows $180,000, the
principal is $180,000. Each monthly mort-
gage payment consists of a portion of
principal that must be repaid plus the
interest that the lender is charging for the
use of the money. During the early years
of a mortgage, the loan payment is primar-
ily interest. Gradually, over time, more and
more of the monthly payments go toward
principal and less toward interest.
332
Part VI: Appendixes 

private mortgage insurance (PMI): If the
down payment is less than 20 percent of a
home’s purchase price, the borrower will
probably need to purchase PMI (also
known as “mortgage default insurance”).
Lenders feel that homeowners who can
only come up with small down payments
are more likely to default on their loans.
Therefore, lenders make these homeown-
ers buy PMI, which reimburses them the
loan amount in case the borrower does
default. Private mortgage insurance can
add hundreds of dollars per year to loan
costs. After the equity in the property
increases to 20 percent, borrowers no
longer need the insurance. Don’t confuse
this insurance with mortgage life insurance.
probate sale: A probate sale is the sale of
a home that occurs when a homeowner
dies and the property is to be divided
among inheritors or sold to pay debts.
The executor of the estate organizes the
probate sale, and a probate court judge
oversees the process. The highest bidder
receives the property.
property tax: You have to pay a property
tax on the home you own. Annually, prop-
erty tax averages 1 to 2 percent of a
home’s value, but property tax rates vary
widely throughout this great land. As one
of the conditions of selling a house, prop-
erty taxes are prorated (see prorations)
and must be paid up to the date of sale.
prorations: Certain items (such as prop-
erty taxes and homeowners association
dues) are continuing expenses that must
be prorated (distributed) between the
buyers and sellers at close of escrow. If
the buyers, for example, owe the seller
money for property taxes that the seller
paid in advance, the prorated amount of
money due the seller at the close of
escrow appears as a credit to the seller
from the buyers.
real estate agent: Real estate agents are
the worker bees of real estate sales. Also
called “salespeople,” agents are super-
vised by a real estate broker. Agents are
licensed by the state; typically their pay is
from commissions generated by selling
property.
Realtor: A Realtor is a real estate broker
or agent who belongs to the National
Association of Realtors, a trade associa-
tion whose members agree to its ways of
doing business and code of ethics. The
National Association of Realtors offers its
members seminars and courses that deal
with real estate topics.
redlining: Redlining is the discriminatory
refusal to provide mortgage loans or
homeowners insurance policies in certain
neighborhoods due to a higher rate of
problems with loans and insurance poli-
cies in such areas. Redlining is illegal!
refinance: Refinance, or “refi,” is a fancy
word for taking out a new mortgage loan
(usually at a lower interest rate) to pay off
an existing mortgage (generally at a
higher interest rate). Although this step
can be lucrative in the long run, refinanc-
ing can be an expensive hassle in the
short run. Carefully weigh the costs and
benefits of refinancing.
return on investment (ROI): The return
on investment is the percentage of profit
that an investor makes on an investment.
If, for example, you put $1,000 into an
investment and a year later sell the invest-
ment for $1,100, you make $100. You calcu-
late ROI by dividing the profit ($100) by your
original investment ($1,000), which equals a
10 percent return. (See also leverage.)
reverse mortgage: A reverse mortgage is
a way for elderly homeowners, especially
those who are low on cash, to tap into
their home’s equity without selling their
333
Appendix C: Glossary

home or moving from it. Specifically, a
lending institution makes a check out to a
homeowner each month, and the home-
owner can use the check as he or she
wants. This money is really a loan against
the value of the home. Because it’s a loan,
the money is income tax-free when the
homeowner receives it. The downside of
these loans is that they deplete the equity
in the estate, the fees and interest rates
tend to be on the high side, and some
require repayment within a certain
number of years.
second mortgage: A second mortgage is a
mortgage that ranks after a first mortgage
in priority of recording. In the event of a
foreclosure, the proceeds from the sale of
the house are used to pay off the loans in
the order in which they were recorded.
Homeowners can have a third (or even a
fourth) mortgage, but the further down
the trough the mortgage is, the greater the
risk that no leftovers will be available to
feed it — hence, the higher interest rate
that homeowners pay on junior mort-
gages. (See also home-equity loan.)
the 72-hour clause: The 72-hour clause 
is commonly inserted into real estate pur-
chase offers when the purchase of a home
is contingent on the sale of the buyer’s 
current house. The seller accepts the
buyer’s offer but reserves the right to
accept a better offer if one should happen
to come along. However, the seller can’t do
this arbitrarily. If the seller receives an offer
that he wants to accept, he must notify the
buyer of that fact in writing. The buyer
then has 72 hours (though the allotted
amount of time can vary) from the seller’s
notification to remove the contingency-of-
sale clause and move on with the purchase;
otherwise, the buyer’s offer is wiped out.
subagents: Many commonly used listing
contracts permit the listing broker to 
delegate the work of procuring a buyer for
the property to his or her salespeople as
well as to cooperating brokers. All these
people are classified as subagents. The
listing broker is, however, liable for any
work delegated to or performed by these 
subagents.
subprime loan: The term applied to loans
offered to borrowers viewed as riskier.
Lenders charge higher rates on such loans.
tax deductible: Tax deductible refers to
payments that people may deduct against
federal and state taxable income. The
interest portion of mortgage payments,
loan points, and property taxes are tax
deductible. Taxpayers can use tax
deductible items to shelter some employ-
ment income, which is not!
teaser rate: Otherwise known as the 
initial interest rate, the teaser rate is the 
attractively low interest rate that most
adjustable-rate mortgages start with.
Don’t be sucked into a mortgage because
it has a low teaser rate. Look at the mort-
gage’s formula (index+ margin = interest
rate) for a more reliable indication of the
loan’s future interest rate — the interest
rate that will apply after the loan is “fully
indexed.”
tenancy-in-common: Tenancy-in-common
is probably the best way for unmarried 
co-owners to take title to a home (except
for those unmarried co-owners who are
involved in close, long-term relationships —
see joint tenancy). Tenancy-in-common
doesn’t require co-owners to own equal
shares of the property. Tenancy-in-common
also doesn’t provide for the right of survivor-
ship that automatically passes the deceased
partner’s ownership to the survivor without
probate. The deceased’s share of the property
involved in a tenancy-in-common passes to
the person named to receive that share of
334
Part VI: Appendixes 

the property in the deceased’s will or living
trust.
title insurance: Title insurance covers the
legal fees and expenses necessary to
defend a property’s title against claims
that may be made against the ownership
of the property. The extent of the cover-
age depends on whether the homeowner
has an owner’s standard coverage or
extended-coverage title insurance policy.
To get a mortgage, homeowners also have
to buy a lender’s title insurance policy to
protect the lender against title risks.
top producer: A top producer is a real
estate agent who sells a great deal of real
estate. Just because someone is a top pro-
ducer, however, doesn’t guarantee that
she’s your best choice as a listing agent.
Make sure that the agent has enough time
to serve you properly, that the agent
knows property values in your area, and
that the agent has been successful selling
properties like yours.
townhouses: These homes are a row or
attached home. Townhouses are cheaper
than single-family homes because they
use common walls and roofs, and they
save land. In terms of investment appreci-
ation potential, townhouses lie some-
where between single-family homes and
condominiums.
transfer disclosure statement (TDS):
Some states require that sellers give
prospective buyers a written disclosure
regarding all known property defects and
all known material facts that may affect
the property’s value or desirability. So if
you know for a fact that the world’s
largest garbage dump will be built directly
behind your house next year, ’fess up.
VA (Department of Veterans Affairs)
loans: Congress passed the Serviceman’s
Readjustment Act, commonly known as
the GI Bill of Rights, in 1944. One of its
provisions enables the VA to help eligible
people on active duty and veterans obtain
mortgages on favorable terms (generally
0.5 to 1 percent below the rate currently
being charged on conventional loans) to
buy primary residences. Like the FHA, the
VA has no money of its own. It guarantees
loans granted by conventional lending
institutions that participate in VA mortgage
programs.
zoning: Certain city and county govern-
ment bodies have the power to regulate
the use of land and buildings. For example,
the neighborhood where your house is
located is probably zoned for residential
use. It most likely also has zoning codes or
ordinances to regulate building heights,
yard sizes, and the percentage of lot cover-
age by buildings. Thanks to zoning codes,
you don’t have to worry about an auto
wrecking shop being built next door to
your house.
