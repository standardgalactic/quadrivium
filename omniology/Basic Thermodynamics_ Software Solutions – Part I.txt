Preface
Preface
“Thermodynamics” is an important subject in engineering studies and has applications in almost all fields 
of engineering. As such, it is included as a ‘core subject’ in the engineering syllabi of many Universities.
In engineering colleges, generally, the subject of Thermodynamics is taught over two semesters: 
a)	 In the first half, ‘Basic Thermodynamics’ is taught. This covers the topics of Units, 
Pressure, Temperature, Properties of Pure substances, Zeroth Law, Heat and Work, First 
Law of Thermodynamics for a closed system and for flow processes, Second Law of 
Thermodynamics, Heat engines, Refrigerators and Heat Pumps, Entropy, Availability and 
Irreversibility, Real and Ideal gases and Gas mixtures etc.
b)	 In the second half, ‘Applied Thermodynamics’ is dealt with. Here, the topics studied are: 
Thermodynamic relations, Vapour power cycles, Gas power cycles, Refrigeration cycles, 
Psychrometrics, Reactive Systems and Compressible fluid flow. 
Thermodynamics is also considered as an abstract subject by students since many of the concepts 
introduced are unfamiliar to them. Therefore, the subject is better learnt by solving a large number 
of problems. 
This book contains solutions to problems in Basic Thermodynamics, as per the syllabus of B.E. courses 
in Visweswaraya Technological University (VTU), Karnataka, India (and other Universities as well).
Solutions to Problems in Applied Thermodynamics will be presented in a subsequent book.
In this book, problems are solved using three popular software, viz. “Mathcad”, “Engineering Equation 
Solver (EES)” and “The Expert System on Thermodynamics (TEST)”. 
Comments are included generously in the codes so that the logic behind the solutions is clear. An 
introductory chapter gives a brief overview of the software used.

Preface
Advantages of using computer software to solve problems are many:
1)	 It helps in solving the problems fast and accurately 
2)	 Parametric analysis (what – if analysis) and graphical visualization is done very easily. This 
helps in an in-depth analysis of the problem. 
3)	 Once a particular type of problem is solved, it can be used as a template and solving similar 
problems later becomes extremely easy. 
4)	 In addition, one can plot the data, curve fit, write functions for various properties or 
calculations and re-use them. 
5)	 These possibilities create interest, curiosity and wonder in the minds of students and 
enthuse them to know more and work more.
This book is an expanded version of the teaching notes of the author, who has taught this subject over 
the past many years to Engineering students. 
S.I. Units are used throughout this book. Wide variety of worked examples presented in the book should 
be useful for those appearing for University, AMIE and Engineering Services examinations.
This particular book may be used in conjunction with any of the standard Text Books on Engineering 
Thermodynamics.
The book is presented in four Parts: 
Part-1 contains the following:
Chapter 1. Introduction to the Software used
Chapter 2. S.I. Units, Unit conversion, Pressure, Temperature etc.
Chapter 3. Properties of Pure substances
Part-2 contains problems on following topics:
Chapter 4. Work, Heat and I Law of Thermodynamics applied to Closed Systems
Chapter 5. I Law of Thermodynamics applied to Flow processes
Part-3 contains problems on following topics:
Chapter 6. II Law of Thermodynamics
Chapter 7. Entropy

Dear Student:
Thermodynamics is an important core subject useful in many branches of engineering. 
When the subject ‘Basic Thermodynamics’ is first introduced, students often feel that it is an abstract 
subject, since the terms such as ‘work’, ‘heat’ ‘energy’ etc seem to appear with new meanings; also, terms 
such as ‘entropy’, ‘enthalpy’, ‘exergy’ etc are rather unfamiliar! In addition, the teacher talks of the Carnot 
cycle as an Ideal cycle, but says that ‘it is not a practical cycle’! Immediately the student asks himself: ‘then, 
why am I studying this?’. Well, importance of these topics are appreciated by students only when they 
are exposed to ‘Applied Thermodynamics’ where topics such as Gas power cycles used in I.C. Engines 
and Turbines, Vapour power cycles used in Power plants, Refrigeration cycles etc are taught.
Best way to learn such an abstract subject is to work out a large number of problems, particularly of 
practical applications.
This book contains solutions to problems on ‘Basic Thermodynamics’ using three popular software, viz. 
Mathcad, Engineering Equation Solver (EES), and The Expert System for Thermodynamics (TEST). Trial 
versions of Mathcad, and EES can be downloaded from the websites indicated. TEST can be accessed 
directly from the website www.thermofluids.net after an initial, free registration. 
Problems in this book are chosen from the University question papers and standard Thermodynamics 
Text books.
Use of Software in solving problems has many advantages:
1.	 It helps in logical thinking
2.	 Problems are solved quickly and accurately
3.	 Parametric solutions (or ‘what-if’ solutions) are obtained easily
4.	 Solutions can be presented in tabular or graphical form, very easily and quickly
5.	 Once a particular type of problem is solved, solving a similar problem with different data 
input becomes very easy
6.	 Ease of getting solutions to problems in tabular or graphical form creates further interest 
and curiosity on the subject and encourages students to be creative and work further
7.	 In Thermodynamics, traditionally, one has to interpolate property values from Tables, and 
this is a very tedious process while solving problems. Use of suitable software allows one to 
get accurate property values with minimum effort.

To the Student
How to use this Book? 
You need not worry if you don’t know about these software. Since each problem is solved systematically 
step by step, and is well commented, just reading through the solution will make the logic of the solution 
clear to you. That is the most important thing in solving the problems. Then, you must work out the 
problem yourself, by hand or using the software. Of course, use of software has the above-mentioned 
advantages. Simply reading the book won’t do. Have your favorite Text book nearby, in case you need to 
refer to it for any formulas or clarifications. There is no other ‘easy method’. As they say, ‘Success is 1% 
inspiration plus 99% perspiration!’
Lastly, I hope that you too will enjoy as much as I did in solving these problems. Good Luck!

Introduction To The Software Used
1	 Introduction To The 
Software Used
Learning objectives:
1.	 In this chapter, a brief overview is given about three very useful commercial, technical 
software, viz. Mathcad, EES and TEST, particularly useful to solve problems in 
Thermodynamics. 
2.	 This chapter is not intended as a tutorial on these software. However, since many examples 
have been worked out, it is expected that the reader will get sufficient working knowledge on 
use of these software. 
3.	 In addition, four ‘free’ software are described, with worked examples. Out of these, two 
programs viz. SteamTab of ChemicaLogic and SteamTable of Figener S/A are for finding 
out properties of Steam/Water and the ‘Humidity Calculator’ program of Vaisala, Finland 
is for psychrometric calculations. Also, a very useful program for Units conversion viz. 
‘UConeer’ from Katmar Software is explained. They are handy, little programs, though with 
some limitations.
1.1	
Introduction: 
‘Thermodynamics’ deals with heat, work and their interactions. Traditionally, Thermodynamics course 
requires considerable amount of problem solving, since the subject is studied better by applying the 
theory to practical problems. Study of Thermodynamics also involves referring to tables and charts to 
find out the thermodynamic and other properties of various working substances such as water/steam, air, 
refrigerants, fuels etc. Interpolation in tables and charts is always a tedious work and is a source of error. 
With the advent of high speed personal computers, and with the availability of good thermodynamic and 
technical computing software, calculations and problem solving in Thermodynamics has become easy, 
fast and straight-forward. However, it must be clearly appreciated that there is no substitute for ‘thorough 
understanding’ of the theory on the part of the student; computers are only tools to be used efficiently, 
and cannot replace the originality, thinking, analysis and intuition associated with human brain. 
In this book, problems in Thermodynamics are solved using three popular software, viz. Mathcad, 
Engineering Equation Solver (EES), and The Expert System for Thermodynamics (TEST). We also 
introduce four ‘free’ software, viz. ‘SteamTab Companion’ (from M/s ChemicaLogic Corporation) and 
‘SteamTable’ (from M/s Figener S/A) to determine the properties of Steam/Water, ‘Humidity calculator’ 
from Vysala Oyj (Finland) for psychrometric calculations, and ‘Uconeer’, a very popular Units conversion 
program from Katmar Software.

Introduction To The Software Used
In this Chapter, we shall give an introduction to these software. It is not intended to give a tutorial on 
these software; but, only the salient features immediately required for the purpose of solving problems 
in the present context, will be explained. These software, have much higher capabilities than explained 
here, and for a detailed information on any of them, the reader must refer to the respective instruction 
manual or specialized publications on that particular software.

About the software:
1.2.1	
Mathcad:
What is Mathcad?
Mathcad, supplied by M/s Parametric Technology Corporation, USA, is a very powerful and popular 
problem solving tool for students of Science and engineering. It turns the computer screen in to a ‘live 
Maths note pad’, and has a ‘free form interface’, i.e. you can add equations, text and graphs in a single 
document. One great advantage of Mathcad is that equations are entered in ‘real Math’ notation (i.e. as 
you would enter in a note pad by hand) and not in a single line, complicated manner as in programming 
languages such as FORTRAN. This makes it very easy to see if there is any mistake committed while 
entering the equation. There are built-in functions and formulae and there is facility for user-defined 
functions too. Unlimited vectors and matrices, ability to solve problems numerically and symbolically 
, root finding, quick and very easy 2-D and 3-D graphics, ‘click selecting’ of greek and other symbols 
from palettes are some other high-lights. All this is done without any programming, but, just with a 
few clicks in Windows.
Symbols in Mathcad worksheet:
Mathcad uses usual math notations. +, -, * and / have usual meaning: addition, subtraction, multiplication 
and division. One advantage in Mathcad is that you can assign a value to a variable and use that 
variable subsequently throughout your worksheet. Symbol for assignment is:= i.e. a colon combined 
with ‘equal’ sign.
Consider the following example. Let variables A, B and C be assigned values of 3, 5 and 7 respectively. 
Then, the product A .B. C is obtained by simply typing A.B.C = , i.e. result is obtained by typing the 
desired mathematical operation, followed by = (i.e. equals sign of maths). Some typical calculations 
using A, B and C are shown below:

‘What-if’ analysis in Mathcad:
If a phenomenon depends on any variables, estimating the effect of varying one variable on the 
phenomenon, while rest of the variables are held constant, is known as ‘what-if’ analysis. Such an 
analysis is carried out very easily in Mathcad.
Consider, for example, the heat flow by conduction through a rod.

Introduction To The Software Used
Heat flow rate Q, through the rod is given by:
Q k A
.
T 1
T 2
L
.
...W
where, 		
k = thermal conductivity of the material, (W/(m.K)
	
A = area of cross-section of the rod, m2
(T1 – T2) = temperature difference between the two ends of rod, (where T1 > T2), and
L = Length of rod, m 
Now, suppose that we are interested to find out the value of Q for rods made of different materials, 
say, copper, Aluminium and stainless steel. i.e. we would like to study the variation of Q with k, rest of  
the variables being held constant. This is done very easily and quickly in Mathcad, as follows: Let T1 = 
300 K, T2 = 200 K, L = 05 m, A = 0.785 × 10-4 m2.
First, define Q as a function of all variables. Then, write the data, assigning values for T1, T2 , L and A. 
Next, assign the first value of k (i.e. for copper), and type ‘Q(k) = ’ (i.e. Q(k) followed by an ‘equals’ 
sign), and the value of Q appears immediately. Now, to see the change in Q for the next value of k, again, 
assign the new value for k, followed by ‘Q(k) = ’, and the new value of Q appears immediately. Similarly, 
repeat for other values of k. Entire worksheet of these calculations is shown below:

In a similar manner, by individually changing other values viz. area of cross-section (A), end temperatures 
(T1, T2) and length (L), effect on the heat transfer rate (Q) can be studied.
Producing the results in tabular form:
Many times, we need the results to be presented in a tabular form. This is done very easily in Mathcad. 
Let us say, we need to produce a table of values for air standard efficiency (ηotto) of Otto cycle against 
the compression ratio (rk).

....Kotto	 is defined as a function of γ and rk
To draw the Table: First, define a range variable rk, varying from 6 to 15 with an increment of 1. Then 
typing ‘rk = ’ immediately gives the values of rk one below the other; similarly, type ‘ηotto(γ,rk) =’, and 
values of ηotto(γ,rk) appear one below the other. Arrange these two sets side by side, and we have the 
required results in a tabular form. This worksheet procedure is shown below:

Solving a set of simultaneous equations (both linear and non-linear):
To solve a set of simultaneous equations, we use the ‘Solve block’ of Mathcad. Again, the procedure is very 
simple: start with guess values for the variables involved say x, y, z. Then type ‘Given’ and immediately 
below it, type the constraints, i.e. the set of equations to be solved. Here, while typing the constraints, take 
care to use the ‘ = ’ sign, and not the assignment sign, ‘: = ’. Then type ‘Find(x,y,z) =’ , and immediately, 
the answer appears, in vector form, giving values of x, y and z, in that order. Entire worksheet of solving 
a set of three equations is shown below:

Introduction To The Software Used
Mathcad has several other capabilities such as: differentiation, integration, matrices, symbolic calculations 
etc. There is also programming capability in Mathcad with the usual constructs such as if–then–else, do-
loops etc. Thus, with its very wide mathematical and graphing functionality, coupled with programming 
capability and the convenience of Windows platform, Mathcad is a very powerful and versatile tool for 
engineering and scientific calculations.
Note: It is pertinent to make one note here. Mathcad does not contain built-in functions for thermodynamic 
properties of working substances such as steam/water, air, refrigerants, fuels etc; one has to buy separately 
add-in programs supplied by third parties.
1.2.2	
Engineering Equation Solver (EES):
What is EES?
EES, supplied by M/s F-Chart Software, USA, is basically an equation solver, which gives numerical 
solutions of a set of linear or non-linear algebraic or differential equations. EES also provides built-in 
functions for thermodynamic and transport properties of many fluids such as water/steam, dry and moist 
air, refrigerants, cryogenic fluids, fuels and others. User written data and functions can also be added 
to the library. Parametric study can easily be conducted to provide optimum design solutions. There 
is good graphing capability and publication quality graphs of different types can easily be generated. 
Combined with this is the programming capability, as in other computer languages such as ‘Fortran’ or 
‘C’, making EES a powerful tool to solve problems in Thermodynamics.

Introduction To The Software Used
Equations Window of EES:
As you start EES, equations window appears. Here, you enter your equations. Formatting rules are as 
follows (Ref: F-chart.com): 
1.	 Upper and lower case letters are not distinguished. EES will (optionally) change the ease of 
all variables to match the manner in which they first appear. 
2.	 Blank lines and spaces may be entered as desired since they are ignored. 
3.	 Comments must be enclosed within braces { } or within quote marks “ ”. Comments may 
span as many lines as needed. Comments within braces may be nested in which case only 
the outermost set of { } are recognized. Comments within quotes will also be displayed in 
the Formatted Equations window. 
4.	 Variable names must start with a letter and consist of any keyboard characters except ( ) ‘ | 
* / + – ^ { }: “ or ;. Array variables are identified with square braces around the array index 
or indices, e.g., X[5,3]. String variables are identified with a $ as the last character in the 
variable name. The maximum length of a variable name is 30 characters. 
5.	 Multiple equations may be entered on one line if they are separated by a semi-colon (;). The 
maximum line length is 255 characters. 
6.	 The caret symbol ^ or ** is used to indicate raising to a power. 
7.	 The order in which the equations are entered does not matter. 
8.	 The position of knowns and unknowns in the equation does not matter. 
Unit System:
Initially, EES is configured for SI system. Go to ‘Unit System’ under OPTIONS menu, if you need to 
check or change the unit system. See screen shot below:

Also, go to ‘Variable Info’ under OPTIONS menu and set the units of all variables; this makes sure that 
all units are consistent and avoids unnecessary error messages popping up. 
Formatted equations Window:
In this window, you can see the equations entered in the equations window, in a formatted manner. This 
is useful to quickly check if you have entered the equations properly.
Solutions Window:
After entering the equations successfully, press F2 to solve; solutions window will appear with all 
variables shown.
Example: Let us now solve in EES the same system of three equations, solved in Mathcad earlier. Equations 
window, Formatted equations window and Solutions window are shown below:

Parametric study in EES:
One of the most useful features of EES is its ability to provide parametric studies. For example, let us 
work out the Air standard efficiency of Otto cycle for various values of compression ratios. This is the 
same problem as worked out earlier with Mathcad.
First, enter the equation in the equations window. Next, select the New Table command. A dialog will 
be displayed listing the variables appearing in the Equations window. 
Fig. 1.5 EES screen shot – setting up the Parametric Table
Choose the variables r_k and eta_otto for the Table and click OK. The Parametric Table works much like 
a spreadsheet. You can type numbers directly into the cells. Numbers which you enter are shown in black 
and produce the same effect as if you set the variable to that value with an equation in the Equations 
window. Delete the r_k =6 equation currently in the Equations window or enclose it in comment brackets 
{ }. This equation will not be needed because the value of r_k will be set in the table. Now enter the 
values of r_k for which eta_otto are be determined. Values of r_k = 6 to 15 have been chosen for this 
example. Now, select Solve Table from the Calculate menu. The Solve Table dialog window will appear 
allowing you to choose the runs for which the calculations will be done. Click the OK button. A status 
window will be displayed, indicating the progress of the solution. When the calculations are completed, 
the values of eta_otto will be entered into the table.

Fluid property functions in EES: As mentioned earlier, EES has built-in functions for thermodynamic 
and properties of a variety of fluids, making it very convenient to solve problems in Thermodynamics.
As an example, let us find out the isentropic work produced in a turbine when steam expands from 30 
bar, 350 C to 10 kPa. Also, find out the quality of exit steam.
Procedure is as follows: We know that isentropic turbine work = (h1 – h2) per kg of steam, where h1 = 
enthalpy at inlet to the turbine, and h2 = enthalpy at exit. In EES, open the Equations window. Enter 
the given data:

Thus, we see that EES is a very versatile software. It is easy to learn, has an intuitive interface, and is 
particularly suited to solve problems in Thermodynamics because of its built-in functions for a large 
number of substances. EES is developed by Prof. Klein and his colleagues who teach Thermodynamics

The Expert System for Thermodynamics (TEST):
What is TEST?
TEST is a web based learning tool for Thermodynamics. It is not a ‘commercial’ software, in its strict 
sense. Educational version of TEST is freely made available to Educators by the author of TEST, Prof. 
Subrata Bhattacharjee. ‘Mirroring’ is also encouraged to ensure that every one has access to the same, 
updated version.
TEST, according to its author, Prof. Subrata Bhattacharjee of San Diego State University, USA, is “…a 
visual environment to solve thermo problems, pursue what-if scenarios, perform numerical experiments, 
and engage in a life-long learning experience… It is a visual platform where a user can look up traditional 
charts and tables, explore hundreds of thermodynamic systems through Flash animations, browse online 
solutions to problems”. Calculations in TEST are done by…Daemons – smart thermodynamic calculators 
customized for specific classes of problems”. A TEST solution is visual in nature, but can be saved and 
recreated later.

Introduction To The Software Used
‘Daemons’ (i.e. TEST calculators) can be used to evaluate thermodynamic properties, define complete 
states, analyze thermodynamic systems such as: IC engines, gas turbines, steam power plants, 
refrigeration, air-conditioning, combustion, etc., and perform what-if analysis, produce solution report, 
plot thermodynamic charts, and create solution macros called TEST-codes, which can be saved for 
later use. TEST has a rich database of working substances – solids, liquids, gases, gas mixtures, phase-
change fluids, moist air etc. One can also create a custom solid, liquid, or gas. There are more than forty 
refrigerants in the TEST database. TEST also has hundreds of animations of systems and old fashioned 
thermodynamic tables and charts are also provided. There is an I/O panel, wherein one can perform 
numerical calculations in an ‘Excel-like’ environment. Refer to the exhaustive tutorial of TEST (Ref: 
www.thermofluids.net) for complete instructions on using TEST.
While TEST is great as a visual solution to problems in thermodynamics, another aspect to be remembered 
is that the equations, formulas and steps involved in calculations are hidden ‘behind the scene’. Therefore 
TEST is very much useful as a visual tool for quick calculations and verification of designs. To produce 
‘publication quality’ graphs, it is recommended that the graph data produced in TEST are transferred 
to some other software such as Excel (or any other) for further processing.
Systematic approach to solve thermodynamic problems:
Fig. 1.12 shows the TEST – Map i.e. classification of daemons for solving different types of thermodynamic 
problems. Essentially, there are 3 types of daemons: Basic, State and System daemons. See the sub-
classification under each type of daemon. Note that under “Basic’ daemons, there is a very good Units 
conversion program, a desk calculator and conventional thermodynamic property tables. Click on the 
appropriate daemon to bring it to surface. “…The core of the daemon is its robust state calculator, which 
bundles the relevant state variables (p, T, v, u, h, s, etc.) into a single graphical interface called a state. 
You can enter the known state variables in any desired units and calculate the state fully or partially by 
the click of a button. The daemon checks for redundancy in inputs, determines phase composition, and 
plots simple thermodynamic diagrams (such as the T-s diagram, psychrometric plot etc.)”.

Fig. 1.12 TEST – Map
After selecting the system, you have to select the material model before the daemon is launched. There 
are four models of working substances: Solid/Liquid, Gases, Gas mixtures and Phase change fluids. Gas 
models are subdivided into Perfect (i.e. constant cp), Ideal and Real gas models. Phase change fluids’ 
refers to Steam/Water, Refrigerants etc. As an example, in TEST-Map shown above, if you click on States-
Uniform System, following screen will appear from where you choose the material model.

‘Free’ Software:
There are many ‘free’ software available in the Internet, made available by well known companies or 
some well meaning individuals. Generally, such software are not very versatile and are meant to do 
some specific job; but, they may do that job very well indeed, some times, even better than commercially 
available software!

Introduction To The Software Used
Here, we shall mention about three software: two for finding out properties of Steam/Water, and the 
other one for doing psychrometric calculations.
1.3.1	
ChemicaLogic SteamTab Companion:
This is a small, but handy program to find out the properties of Steam/ Water.
As you start the program, following screen appears:
Fig. 1.18 About SteamTab Companion
As can be seen in the above fig., there are 4 tabs: About, Saturated, Superheated/Subcooled and Constants. 
Clicking ‘About’ brings up the above screen, which gives details about the company etc. ‘Saturated’ tab 
gives properties of saturated steam; either P or T has to be input, since in saturated state only one intrinsic 
property determines the state. 
As an example, let us find out the saturated properties at, say, P = 6 bar. Click on the ‘Saturated tab and 
enter the value of P when the screen appears. See the following screen shot:

Note that P is selected as independent variable. You can also choose either Metric/SI. or English units. 
We have chosen Metric/SI. We can read either Sat. Vapor properties or Sat. Liquid properties. Here, we 
have chosen Vapor properties. Now, click ‘Calculate’ and immediately, the properties are shown on the 
screen. Following fig. shows both the Sat. Vapor and Sat. Liquid properties:

Fig. 1.20 (b) Sat. Liq. properties of Steam at P = 6 bar
Note that there are several other properties which can be read by scrolling down the scroll bar.
Another example to find the Superheated/Subcooled properties of Steam: Consider the earlier example 
of Steam at 30 bar and 350 C: Click on the ‘Superheated/Subcooled’ tab; now, two intrinsic properties 
must be input – so, we enter values of P and T and click on ‘Calculate’. Following screen appears giving 
the results:

Introduction To The Software Used
Fig. 1.21 Superheated/Subcooled. properties of Steam at P = 6 bar
Note that at 30 bar, 350 C, enthalpy (h1) = 3116.06 kJ/kg, and entropy (s1) = 6.74493 kJ/kg-C.
Again, more properties are available in this screen if you roll down the scroll bar.
A great advantage is that in ‘Superheated/Subcooled’ mode, combination of any two of the following 
properties can be used: Pressure, Volume, Temperature, Enthalpy, Entropy, Internal energy.
Now, if isentropic expansion occurs in a turbine to a pressure of 10 kPa, what is the exit enthalpy and the 
isentropic work of the turbine? To solve this, input P = 0.1 bar and s2 = s1 = 6.74493 kJ/kg-C. Results 
are in the following screen shot:

Introduction To The Software Used
Fig. 1.22 Superheated/Subcooled properties of Steam at P = 0.1 bar, s = 6.74493 kJ/kg-C
Read from the above fig: h2 = 2136.08 kJ/kg. Therefore, Isentropic work of turbine = 
(h1 – h2) = 979.98 kJ/kg. (Compare this with the value of W = 979.7 kJ/kg, obtained with EES). And, 
quality at exit of turbine, x2 = 81.2805%, whereas with EES, we got x2 = 81.24%.

Introduction To The Software Used
Clicking on ‘Constants’ tab brings up the screen giving values of some constants pertaining to Steam/Water:
Fig. 1.23 Constants for Steam/Water
Two disadvantages of this software are: 
1)	 there is no ‘copy and paste’ facility, i.e. you can not copy and paste these values into another 
file, and
2)	 there is no ‘log’ facility, i.e. each time you make a new calculation, results of earlier 
calculations are lost since they are not stored in a log file. 
Still, this software is quite useful since it permits input of any two properties to get a large number of 
remaining properties.
1.3.2	
SteamTable from M/s Figener S/A:
This is also a very handy, little program to find out properties of Steam/Water. In addition, it gives (T-s), 
(T-h) and (h-s) or Mollier charts for steam, and the state point calculated is also plotted in those charts. 
Further, a log facility is also provided, so that you can see the record of calculations done by you in 
one sitting.

Introduction To The Software Used
As can be seen, four tabs: ‘About’ (i.e. above screen), ‘Steam table (complete range)’, ‘Saturation zone’ 
and ‘Diagrams’.
When you click on ‘Steam table (complete range)’, a table appears, wherein you have to enter both P and 
T values. Note that there is no other choice of properties available; this is a draw back of this software. 
However, a log facility is available i.e. in the same table, in the next lines, you can get results for other 
states. See the example in the following screen shot:
Fig. 1.25 SteamTable – Properties at different P and T
If you immediately click the ‘Diagrams’ tab, and select any of the three diagrams (i.e. T-s, T-h or h-s 
diagrams), these state points will be shown plotted in that diagram. For example, the T-s diagram is 
shown below and note that all these 3 points are marked there:

Scale in the diagrams can be changed by clicking on the ‘Settings’ button and making necessary changes.
When you click on ‘Saturation zone’ tab, saturation properties can be calculated. Of course, you have to 
input either P or T. Also, if you need the properties at some point within the two phase region (i.e. Sat. 
zone), you can input quality x first, and, then enter either P or T. Following screen shows some results: 
First, for P = 6 bar, next, for T = 200 C, next for x = 0.75, P= 20 bar, and, then for x = 0.8 and T = 125 C.

Now, click on ‘Diagrams’ tab and choose Mollier diagram. The state points are shown in the Mollier 
diagram below:

Thus, SteamTable is also a useful program. Choice of the three diagrams and log facility are its 
added advantages.
1.3.3	
Humidity Calculator from M/s Vaisala, Finland:
This is a very versatile and extremely useful software for psychrometric calculations. It is very easy 
to use. A great advantage is that the results obtained can be printed to a printer or stored in a file 
for future reference. There is also a very good ‘Help’ file which gives relevant technical information 
on psychrometrics.

Following is the extract from the details supplied in the ‘help’ file:
“Vaisala Humidity calculator is a software tool that provides an easy way for solving humidity conversions 
from one humidity parameter to another. It can also be used to calculate the effect of changing ambient 
conditions. Vaisala Humidity Calculator includes both a basic version and an advanced version which 
are shown on the user interface as separate sheets. The basic version provides calculations between 
relative humidity and dew point when one of these parameters and temperature are known. Note that 
below the freezing point of water (0°C/32°F), frost point values are provided by convention, although the 
word dew point is commonly used to express both dew point and frost point. The advanced version of 
Vaisala Humidity Calculator includes calculation of: 
• relative humidity 
• dewpoint / frostpoint 
• parts per million. 
• absolute humidity 
• mixing ratio 
• water content 
• vapor pressure

In the advanced version the user can also choose to output dew point (equilibrium over super-cooled 
water instead of ice) for values below the freezing point of water (0°C/32°F). For gas dependent humidity 
parameters (e.g., ppm by weight and mixing ratio) a wide selection of carrier gases is available in addition 
to air (natural gas, CO2, SF6, Ar, O2, N2, H2). The user can specify additional carrier gases but must 
provide the molecular weight of the gas. Wet bulb calculation can be performed based on standard or 
WMO coefficients, as well as custom values given by the user”. 
When you start the Humidity Calculator, following screen appears:

Free Unit conversion program – ‘Uconeer’ from Katmar Software:
This is a very popular unit conversion program – created specifically for engineers. Uconeer has over 
397 units arranged in 46 categories. Uconeer is claimed to be ‘the easiest to use conversion program 
available’, while still retaining all the units engineers actually use.
When you start the program, you get the following screen:
Fig. 1.33 Uconeer – Units conversion program
Select the category and the ‘From’ and ‘To’ radio buttons; enter the numerical value of units to be 
converted, and the result appears immediately.
As an example, consider converting heat transfer coefficient: say, from 25 W/m2-K to BTU/ft2-h-F. Select 
the category ‘heat transfer coeff.’ and select ‘From’ and ‘To’ buttons as required. Enter 25 in front of ‘From’ 
and immediately the answer appears against ‘To’ as 4.40275 Btu/ft².h.°F. The screen shot is shown below:

There is also facility to copy to clip board and choose the result formats and significant digits. There 
is a very good ‘Help’ file, Gas and Liquid Volume/Mass Flow converters, Gas constant converter and 
Hardness converter. However, there is one ‘disadvantage’, which does not affect the results anyway: 
regular popping up of advertisements regarding the products or services provided by the company, as

Summary: 
In this chapter, a brief overview was given about three very useful commercial, technical software, viz. 
Mathcad, EES and TEST, particularly useful to solve problems in Thermodynamics. This chapter is not 
intended as a tutorial on these software. However, since some examples have been worked out, it is 
expected that the reader will get sufficient working knowledge on use of these software. As we proceed, 
more problems will be worked out; all the examples will be thoroughly commented, and the reader 
should not have any difficulty in understanding the solutions, even if he does not use these software.
In addition, four ‘free’ software are described, with worked examples. Out of these, two programs are 
for finding out properties of Steam/Water and one program for psychrometric calculations, and another 
program for Units conversion.

Pressure, Temperature etc.
Learning objectives:
1.	 In this chapter, we first describe the International System of Units (i.e. SI Units). Authentic 
information from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), USA, formerly 
(National Bureau of Standards – NBS – USA) is compiled.
2.	 Unit conversion examples are demonstrated with Uconeer and the Unit converter of 
TEST software. 
3.	 Then, we discuss about the pressure measurement with manometers and work out 
some examples using Mathcad as well as EES. One example on ‘curve fitting’ with EES is 
also explained. 
4.	 Temperature measurement with Thermocouples is explained next. Details regarding 
different types of thermocouples are given. Problems are worked out using both Mathcad 
and EES. 
5.	 Next, constant volume gas thermometer is described and a problem is worked out 
using EES. 
6.	 Finally, RTD’s and Pt resistance thermometer are explained; a versatile, free software viz. 
PRTCalc to make calculations in connection with Pt-100 is introduced and a problem is 
worked out in Mathcad and verified with PRTCalc.
7.	 Finally, Temperature vs Resistance characteristics for Pt-100 thermometer are drawn 
in Mathcad.

 Prefixes of SI Units are shown below:
Correct usage of SI Units:
US Metric Association (USMA) has given guide lines about correct use of SI Units:
Important in SI-metric:
1.	 The short forms for SI units (such as mm for millimeter) are called symbols, 
not abbreviations. 
2.	 SI symbols never end with a period unless they are the last word in a sentence. 
οο RIGHT: 20 mm, 10 kg 
οο WRONG: 20 mm, 10 kg.

S I Units,  Uni t Conversion , Pressure,  Temperatur e etc
3.	 SI symbols should be preceded by digits and a space must separate the digits from the symbol. 
οο RIGHT: It was 300 mm wide. The millimeter width was given. 
οο WRONG: It was 300mm wide. The mm width was given. 
4.	 Symbols always are written in the singular form (even when more than one is meant). 
οο RIGHT: 1 mm, 500 mm, 1 kg, 36 kg 
οο WRONG: 500 mms, 36 kgs 
οο BUT: It is correct to pluralize written-out metric unit names: 25 kilograms, 250 milliliters 
5.	 The symbol for a compound unit that is a quotient of two units is indicated by a solidus or by 
a negative exponent. 
οο RIGHT: km/h or km·h-1 (for kilometers per hour) 
οο WRONG: kmph or kph (do not use p as a symbol for “per”.) 
οο BUT: It is correct to say or write “kilometers per hour”. 
6.	 The meaning of an SI symbol can be changed if you substitute a capital letter for a lower 
case letter. 
οο RIGHT: mm (for millimeter, which means 1/1000 of a meter) 
οο WRONG: MM or Mm (M is the prefix for mega, which means one million; a 
megameter is a million meters)

2.3	
Conversion of Units:
Even though SI system is now generally adopted for scientific work, still, the old FPS system is used by 
general public in some countries, especially in the US. So, many times it becomes necessary to convert 
from FPS to SI or vice-versa.
FPS System:
The fundamental units in the foot-pound-second (fps) system of units are: the foot for length, the pound 
for weight, and the second for time.

However, if there is access to a computer, it will be convenient, accurate and fast to use a software like 
Uconeer. AS mentioned earlier, TEST also has a very good ‘Unit converter daemon’ under the heading 
“Basic daemons’.

Examples of Unit conversion:
While doing Unit conversions by hand, above Table may be used. If a computer is accessible, it will 
be quick, accurate and convenient to do unit conversions with the help of one of the softwares. A few 
examples are shown below. 
Mathcad can conveniently be used for quick unit conversions. If the unit conversions have to be done 
quite a few times in the same worksheet, it will be useful to define the unit conversion factors in a 
function. See below a Mathcad worksheet example:
Fig. 2.1 Mathcad Worksheet for Unit conversion
However, using the software designed specifically for unit conversions is always advantageous; you need 
not remember the conversion factors. Just a few clicks of the mouse will do the job.

Open Uconeer, choose the category ‘heat transfer coeff.’, and click the radio buttons in ‘From’ and ‘To’. 
Enter 25.8 in the ‘From’ widget. Immediately, you get the following result:
Fig. 2.2 Unit conversion with Uconeer
Next, an example of using the ‘Unit conversion daemon’ from TEST software is given below:
Prob. 2.4 Convert 1013 kJ/kg to BTU/lbm.
Open the Unit converter daemon in TEST. Select the category ‘Specific Energy, Enthalpy, Latent Heat’. 
Enter 1013 on the yellow panel. Select ‘kJ/kg’ on LHS and select ‘BTU/lbm’ on RHS, as shown. Immediately 
the answer appears as 435.54907 BTU/lbm:

Examples of Pressure calculations with Manometers:
Manometers are commonly used in experiments to measure pressures or pressure differentials.
Formulae:
A barometer and a simple U-tube manometer are shown below:
Fig. 2.4 The barmoter
First principle to remember is: if the height of a column of liquid is h, and its density ρ, pressure at the 
bottom of the column is:
P2 P1 P atm
U g

h

Pa.....eqn. 
(2.2)
where, ρ = density of fluid in kg/m3, h = vertical height of fluid column in m, g = accn.
due to gravity = 9.81 m/s2 at sea level
or,
Second principle to remember is: in a body of liquid the pressures are the same at all points at the same 
horizontal level. i.e. in the fig. below, P1 = P2.

To improve accuracy and sensitivity of manometers, different arrangements have been devised: simplest 
one is the inclined manometer. Here, the manometer arm is inclined at an angle of say, theta degrees to 
the horizontal. 
Fig. 2.6 Inclined manometer
Then, if the inclined reading is H, vertical height h is given by:
h H sin T
( )

eqn. 
(2.4)
And, using this ‘h’, ΔP is calculated from eqn.(2.3)
Another way of improving the accuracy and sensitivity of manometers is to use more than one fluid in 
the manometer. Fig. below shows a manometer with three working fluids:

Now, let solve a few problems on pressure measurement.
Following problem is solved in Mathcad.
Problem 2.6: In the following fig. if the gauge reads 70 kPa, what should be the height of the liquid column in manometer? 
Liquid sp. gravity = 0.85.
Fig. Prob. 2.6
Pressure inside the Gas tank is equal to the gauge pressure + atmospheric pressure. On the right limb of 
manometer, atm. pressure is acting. Therefore, h should be equivalent to the gauge pressure, i.e.

Note: This height of liquid column is rather too much. So, let us investigate the variation of liquid height 
with ρliq, say starting from 800m kg/m3 to 13600 kg/m3:
In Mathcad, this is very easy. Define ‘h’ as a function of ρ and proceed as shown in the following:

Then from the Insert menu, choose: Graph -x-y plot. A blank plot appears with place holders in x and 
y axes. Fill up rliq for x and h(rliq) for y. Immediately the graph appears. It can then be formatted for 
better appearance by adding grid lines, titles etc.

Find out the atm. pressure in kPa at an altitude of 10000 m.
Let us work out this problem in EES. First, we prepare a ‘look up table’ in EES with altitude (m) in 
column 1 and pressure (kPa) in column 2; then, plot the pressure against altitude, and then get the 
curve fit equation and then use it to calculate the pressure at 10000 m altitude in the equations window.
Since ‘curve fit’ is an important requirement in many problems, let us show the details: After starting EES, 
go to ‘Tables’ menu, select ‘New look up table’, select two columns and 30 rows, and fill up the altitude 
values in metres in the column 1, and pressure values in kPa in column 2. Look up table is shown below:

Note that plot shows one curve for the data in the table and a second curve for the results as per the 
curve fit equation.
Next, to find the pressure at an altitude of 10000 m: Use the curve fit eqn. In the Equation window of 
EES, you can type this eqn, substitute for x = 10000 and get the value of pressure ( = y). In the following 
screen, we have written an EES function using the curve fit eqn. so that pressures can be calculated 
conveniently for any altitudes, say for x1 = 1000 m, x2 = 5000 m and x3 = 10000 m:

Thermocouple is a popular device for temperature measurement.
Its advantages are: it is cost effective, easy and convenient to use and is suitable for a wide range of 
temperatures. Because of low thermal mass of the thermocouple junction, it is quite suitable to measure 
varying temperatures with fast response. 
However, its disadvantages are non-linear characteristics of output (i.e. milli-Volts against temperature) 
and very low values of voltage output, which needs amplification; also, ‘cold junction compensation’ is 
required for accuracy.
Voltage developed in thermocouple is a function of temperature difference between junctions. It varies 
from 1 to 70 microvolts per degree Celsius. 
Thermocouples popularly used in industry are:

Reference junction is normally at 0 deg. C. However, if it is difficult to maintain 0 deg. C reference in 
practice, by suitable electronic circuitry, ‘cold junction compensation’ is provided.
Standard reference tables for Thermocouples are normally referenced to 0 deg.C cold junction. NIST 
reference functions and tables of thermocouple electromotive force (emf) versus temperature have been 
adopted as standards by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and the International 
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). Distributed by Standard Reference Data Program of the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology. NIST look up tables and polynomial coefficients for different Types 
of thermocouples are available for download from the web site: http://srdata.nist.gov/its90/download/
This website presents the following screen:
By clicking at the required type of thermocouple, one can download the look up table for that type. 
For example, a partial extract (-270 deg.C to 90 deg.C) of the look up table given by NIST for Type E 
thermocouple in their website is shown below. Note that the table is given in the temperature range: 
(-270 deg.C to1000 deg.C).

Problem 2.11: A temperature T on a thermometric scale is defined in terms of property P by the 
relation: T = a. ln(P) + b where a and b are constants. The temperatures at ice point and steam point are 
0 deg.C and 100 deg.C respectively. Instrument gives values of P as 1.86 and 6.81 at ice and steam point 
respectively. Evaluate temperature corresponding to a reading of P = 2.5 [M.U.].

Problem 2.12: The readings tA and tB of two Celsius thermometers A and B agree at the Ice point (0 
deg.C) and Steam point (100 deg.C), but elsewhere are related by the equation: tA = l + m* tA + n* tB
2, 
where l, m and n are constants. When both the thermometers are immersed in a well stirred oil bath, A 
registers 51 deg.C, while B registers 50 deg.C. Determine the reading on B when A reads 25 deg.C [M.U.]
This problem is now solved in EES:
First, enter the constraints in the ‘Equation window’. See the comments against each line in the screen 
shot below. Next press F2 and the solution appears in the ‘Solutions window’.
We get the solution as: tB = 24.26 deg.C when tA = 25 deg.C 
Problem 2.13: Fahrenheit and Centigrade thermometers are both immersed in a fluid. Fahrenheit reading 
is numerically twice that of the Centigrade reading. What is the temperature of the fluid expressed on 
degree Rankine and Kelvin?
This problem is also easily solved in EES. See the screen prints of ‘Equation window’ and ‘Solution

Note the answers as: x = 160 deg.C, y = 320 deg.F; 
R = 780 deg. Rankine; K = 433.1 K; (R/K = 1.8 …verified).
Problem 2.14: A Pt vs Pt-Rh thermocouple gave following readings during its calibration: at 630.74 C, 
emf = 5550 microvolts; at 961.93 C, emf = 9150 microvolts, and at 1064.3 C, emf = 10335 microvolts. 
If the polynomial relation between emf and temperature is emf = A.T + B.T2 + C.T3, determine the 
constants A, B and C. Also, find the temperature corresponding to an emf of 7300 microvolts.
Solution is done in EES. 
In the Eqn. window, write the equations for the three temperatures as shown. Solving them simultaneously, 
one gets polynomial coefficients A, B and C. Then use the polynomial eqn. to get temperature 
corresponding to emf = 7300 microvolts. Press F2 to get solution. Results are shown below:
We note the results: 
Polynomial coeffs: A = 7.142, B = 0.002938 and C=-4.931E-07, and
At emf = 7300 microvolts, Temperature T = 796.2 deg.C

Constant volume gas thermometer:
A constant volume thermometer, as the name implies, has a constant bulb volume and as the temperature 
is changed, pressure inside the bulb also will change. Temperature and pressure are related by the Perfect 
gas law, viz. P.V = m. R .T where P is the absolute pressure and T is the absolute temperature.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Resistance Thermometer Detectors (RTD):
RTD’s work on the principle that electrical resistances of many metals such as Platinum, Copper, 
Aluminium, Lead, Indium, Gold and Silver change with temperature. 
Generally, Platinum is used because of its advantages: 
i.	
it has a wide range and non-reactive upto high temperatures of around 850 deg. C, 
ii.	
it has good accuracy
iii.	 it has good interchangeability
iv.	 it has long term stability
v.	
it can be drawn into wires
vi.	 it is not too soft 
vii.	 it gives reproducible results, and
viii.	it is not affected by corrosion and oxidation 
Disadvantages of Pt are:
i.	 expensive
ii.	 influenced by lead wire resistance
iii.	slow thermal response, and
iv.	 low resistance to shock and vibration
Pure Pt (99.99%) is used, since impurities in the resistor will affect the electrical resistance. Pt-resistance 
thermometers are known as PRT. According to the IEC and DIN Standards, temperature coefficient of 
the resistance wire must be 0.0038500C-1 (i.e. mean resistance change referred to the nominal resistance 
at zero deg.C) and it should have a resistance of 100 ohms at 0 deg.C; so, it is known as PT-100. Its 
resistance changes approximately 0.4 ohms/degree C. Following graph shows the variation of resistance 
with temperature:

Free software to quickly determine temperature for a given resistance and vice-versa:
For those who use Pt 100 very often, there is a very versatile free software to make calculations, known 
as PRTCalc., available for download from http://www.isotech.co.uk/prtcalc/prtcalc.html. According to its 
supplier: “It allows for the accurate conversion of resistance to temperature or temperature to resistance. 
PRTCalc is a small utility that can sit on the desk top alongside other applications. The calculated results 
can easily be imported to spreadsheets or other applications for presentation, storage or whatever. Output 
data can also be saved as a text file”. 
Important features of PRTCalc are:
1.	 Can Generate Large Tables or Single Values 
2.	 Convert Temperature to Resistance with high accuracy
3.	 Convert Resistance to Temperature to approx. 0.01°C
4.	 Allows very large lists of data 
5.	 Output Can be Saved as a text file 
6.	 Allows marking and copying of result data 
7.	 Stores coefficients for user entered probes 
8.	 Probe Management. 
9.	 Unit Choice – Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin

For example:


In the above, we first define a function to calculate resistance for any temperature. Since there are two 
different equations to determine the resistance depending on the temperature range, we have written a 
small Mathcad program using ‘if…otherwise’ construct. First line in the above program gives the value 
of resistance if the temperature ‘t’ is less than 0 deg.C and the next line gives the value of resistance 
‘otherwise’ i.e. if the value of temperature is more than 0 deg.C. To check the working of the program, 
resistance at -152.7 deg.C is calculated, which is 38.597 ohms, same value obtained earlier.

Next, to draw the graph, first define a range variable ‘t’ to vary from -200 deg.C to 850 deg.C with an 
increment of 5 deg.C. Then, from the ‘Insert’ menu in Mathcad, click ‘graph-x-y plot’ and a blank plot 
appears with one ‘place holder’ on the x-axis and another ‘place holde’r on the y-axis. On the x-axis 
place holder type ‘t’ and on the y-axis place holder type ‘Resist(t)’ and the graph appears immediately. To

Summary:
In this chapter, we first described the International System of Units (i.e. SI Units). Unit conversion 
examples were worked out using Uconeer and the Unit converter of TEST software. Then, we discussed 
about the pressure measurement with manometers and worked out some examples using Mathcad as 
well as EES. One example on ‘curve fitting’ with EES was also explained. Temperature measurement 
with Thermocouples was explained next. Details regarding different types of thermocouples were given. 
Problems were worked out using both Mathcad and EES. Next, constant volume gas thermometer was 
described and a problem was worked out using EES. Finally, RTD’s and Pt resistance thermometer were 
explained; a versatile, free software viz. PRTCalc to make calculations in connection with Pt-100 was 
introduced and a problem was worked out in Mathcad and verified with PRTCalc. Finally, Temperature 
vs Resistance characteristics for Pt-100 thermometer were drawn in Mathcad.

3	 Properties Of Pure Substances
Learning objectives:
1.	 In this chapter, we study about ‘pure substances’ i.e. substances which have a fixed chemical 
composition throughout. 
2.	 Various property diagrams are explained, with particular reference to water. 
3.	 Use of EES, TEST and many ‘free’ and online software to determine properties and plot 
property diagrams for different substances is demonstrated. 
4.	 Methods of finding out property values and generating property tables are also shown using 
different software. 
5.	 Determination of dryness fraction (or quality) of steam with ‘throttling calorimeter’ as well 
as ‘separating and throttling calorimeter’ is explained.
3.1	
Introduction:
A substance may exist in solid, liquid or gaseous state, and a ‘pure substance’ , by definition, is homogeneous 
and has the same chemical composition in all the states. For example, water has the same chemical 
composition whether it exists as ice (i.e. solid), or liquid water or steam (i.e. gaseous state). Sometimes, 
a mixture of gases, such as air is also treated as pure substance as far as it does not change phase. (When 
air changes phase, it has different compositions in gaseous and liquid phases). 
In engineering, we frequently use water, air and refrigerants as important working substances. Water/
steam is used in boilers, turbines and power plants. Air is used in Internal combustion engines and in 
numerous other applications. Many different types of refrigerants are in use in refrigeration and air-
conditioning applications.
We shall study the properties of simple, compressible systems (i.e. systems where surface effects, magnetic 
effects and electrical effects are insignificant), where changes in pressure (P), volume (v) and temperature 
(T) are important. While studying the properties of pure substances, it is worthwhile to remember the 
‘State principle’, which states as follows: ‘For a simple, compressible substance specifying the values of any 
two independent, intensive properties will fix the values of all of the others’. Here, the term ‘independent’ 
is important. Thus, for example, pressure (P) and temperature (T) are two independent properties for liquid 
water or gaseous steam, and given P and T fix the state for liquid water or gaseous steam. But, when the 
water is boiling, P and T are dependent on each other; so, one more independent property such as ‘quality’ 
is to be specified to fix the state.
We shall present our discussion mainly for water, but in general, the principles are valid for other fluids too.

Property diagrams for Water: 
Following are the important property diagrams: P-v, T-v, P-T (or phase diagram), T-s and h-s. Of these, 
T-s and h-s diagrams are very useful in analyzing power cycles and refrigeration cycles.
Some sample diagrams are shown below: 
3.2.1	
T-v diagram: (Ref: 1)
Fig. 3.1 T-v diagram for Water at different pressures
Note that with increasing pressures, the two phase region becomes shorter and shorter and at a ‘critical 
pressure’ of 22.06 MPa, it is just a point. This is called ‘critical point’ and the value of ‘critical temperature’ 
is 373.95 K.
Locus of points such as 3 and 5 give the ‘saturated liquid line’ and ‘saturated vapour line’ as shown below. 
Both these lines meet at the critical point.

P-T diagram (or, Phase diagram): [Ref:12]
A pressure-temperature diagram is called a ‘phase diagram’ since all the three phases of a substance are 
shown therein. 
P-T diagram for water, which expands on freezing, is shown below; all the three phases are shown and 
also the melting or fusion (from solid to liquid), vaporization (from liquid to vapor) and sublimation 
(from solid to vapor) lines are shown. C is the critical point. And, T is the triple point, where all the 
three phases are present. Note that for water, melting line has a negative slope.

Note that for water, as a consequence of negative slope of the melting line, freezing temperature decreases 
with an increase in pressure; also, at a temperature below the Triple point, as the pressure is increased 
vertically along the constant temperature line, vapor will first become a solid and then liquid! At a 
temperature above the critical temperature, it is impossible to condense a vapor into liquid by increasing 
the pressure.
For a substance other than water, i.e. which contracts on freezing, the phase diagram will look as follows:

P-v-T surface [Ref: 11]:
P-v-T surface for water (which expands on freezing) is shown in Fig. 3.8. It may be observed that other 
diagrams such as T-v and P-v diagrams described above are the projections of this three-dimensional 
P-v-T surface on respective coordinate planes. Note that single phase regions appear as curved surfaces 
on the P-v-T surface, and the two phase regions are surfaces perpendicular to the P-T plane.

Property Diagrams from Software:
Property diagrams can be obtained very accurately and conveniently from software like EES and TEST. 
EES gives presentation quality property diagrams for several fluids with just a few clicks of the mouse, 
whereas TEST gives property diagrams which are indicative while solving the problems or determining 
the states. However, TEST also gives ‘plot data’ which can be copied to a spreadsheet like EXCEL and 
then good quality diagrams can be drawn. We shall illustrate the use of EES as well as TEST to draw a 
few representative property diagrams.
3.3.1	
Property diagrams using EES:
It is very easy and convenient to draw property diagrams using EES.
As you start EES, welcome screen appears; dismiss it and, then, from the ‘Plot’ menu, choose ‘Property

connection with steam cycles and the (P-h) diagram is used to analyze refrigeration cycles. We shall, at 
this stage, just present these charts drawn with EES as already explained. We shall deal with these charts

Property values and Tables:
Many times, it is difficult to read accurately from the Property plots, particularly if the scale is logarithmic. 
We may need property values at a given state; or, we may need a table of property values at a set of points. 
P, v and T are measurable properties and other properties tabulated are internal energy (u), enthalpy (h) 
and entropy (s). Generally these properties are calculated from the measured properties by means of 
complicated state equations. For example, for steam, different formulae are applicable depending upon 
the region in which the state lies. (see figure 3.18 below).
International Association for Properties of Water and Steam (IAPWS_97) defines the properties of Steam 
in 5 regions: 
• region 1 for the liquid state from low to high pressures, 
• region 2 for the vapor and ideal gas state, 
• region 3 for the thermodynamic state around the critical point, 
• region 4 for the saturation curve (vapor-liquid equilibrium), 
• region 5 for high temperatures above 1073.15 K (800 °C) and pressures up to 10 MPa (100 bar).

Fig. 3.18a. Five regions for Steam Properties (IAPWS-97)
At this stage, we shall define two quantities:
1.	 Enthalpy: The quantity (U + P.v) occurs very often in thermodynamic analysis, particularly 
in the analysis of steam cycles. It is denoted by H, and is termed as ‘Enthalpy’ (kJ). On unit 
mass basis, ‘specific enthalpy’ is:
	
h u
P v

	
kJ/kg..............
(3.1)
2.	 Quality: One small note on the properties in the two phase region, i.e. wet steam.

Properties Of Pure Substances
‘Wet steam’ or two-phase region is the region bounded by the ‘Sat. liquid line’ and the ‘Sat. vapor line’. 
To fix the state within the two phase region, we need either pressure or temperature and one more 
independent property like ‘quality’ or ‘specific volume’ etc. Properties at the sat. liquid state are denoted 
with a subscript ‘f’ (ex: vf, uf, hf, sf etc.) and the properties at the sat. vapor state are denoted with a 
subscript ‘g’ (ex: vg, ug, hg, sg etc.).
Quality in two phase region is defined as the ratio of mass of vapor to the total mass (mass of liquid 
plus vapor). i.e. 
x
mg
mf
mg 
...(3.2)
And, quality varies from zero to 1.
Further, specific volume of mixture ‘v’ is given by: 
Similarly, internal energy, enthalpy and entropy of the mixture are given by:

Property values from TEST:
TEST is perhaps best suited to get property values of steam and many substances by plugging in values 
of two independent properties. Advantage of TEST is that properties are presented visually immediately, 
without the need to do any calculations or refer to any tables. Further, the TEST codes generated can be 
copied, stored and used to regenerate the solutions at a later time if required.
As an example, let us find the properties of water at a temperature of 50 deg. C and specific vol. of 
4.16 m3/kg:

Table 3.4b. Properties of R-134a
It may be observed that EES does not specifically indicate the phase of the fluid; it has to be inferred by 
looking at the quality (x) or by locating the state in one of the property diagrams.
In this connection, it may be stated that while using TEST, after calculating the state, the phase of the 
substance is indicated explicitly. For example, if we work out the state 1 in the above problem using TEST, 
following is the result:

Note that State 1 is in the sub-cooled liquid region.
If we get the p-v plot, State 1 is also shown in that plot immediately:

Property values from ‘free’ software:
Here, main disadvantage is that these free software are available only for Water/Steam. If we have to 
calculate properties for any other fluid, then we have to use either EES or TEST.
Method of using ‘SteamTab companion’ has already been explained in Chapter 1. So, now, we shall just 
show the results for State 1 and State 5 of Prob. 3.1:
Using ‘SteamTab companion’, for State 1 of Prob. 3.1:

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Example Problems:
Let us work out a few problems to illustrate the use of these software.
Problem 3.3. Find the enthalpy and entropy of steam when the pressure is 2 MPa and specific volume 
is 0.09 m3/kg. [VTU, 2005]
Solution: If this problem has to be solved using conventional steam tables, tedious interpolation will be 
required. But, the problem is solved very easily with TEST:
Open TEST, Click Map > Uniform system > Phase Change model. (See Figs. 3.18a and 3.18b.). Substance 
‘H2O’ is automatically selected. Select P1 and v1 and enter the values given. Take care to select proper 
units. See Fig. 3.34a below:
Fig. 3.32a. Properties of H2O from TEST
Now, click ‘Calculate’ and immediately all the results are displayed, as shown below:

Read the result as: h1 = 2614.85 kJ/kg, and s1 = 5.96 kJ/kg.K, and the state is: sat. mixture with quality 
(i.e. dryness fraction) = 0.902.
By clicking on the T-s plot widget, you can locate the state on the T-s diagram too, as shown Fig. 3.34c

Problem 3.4. A rigid container is filled with steam at 600 kPa and 200 deg.C. At what temperature the 
steam begins to condense when it is cooled? Determine the corresponding pressure. [VTU, 2004]
Solution: Container is ‘rigid’ – means that the volume remains constant. Let us solve this problem in 
TEST. Let state 1 be at 600 kPa and 200 deg.C.
Open TEST, Click Map > Uniform system > Phase Change model. (See Figs. 3.18a and 3.18b.). Substance 
‘H2O’ is automatically selected. Select P1 and 1 and enter the values given. Take care to select proper 
units. Click ‘Calculate’ and all properties at state 1 are presented. See Fig. 3.35a below:

Next, select State 2. Since State 2 is saturated vapor (when condensation just begins), ‘quality’ x2 =1. Also, 
since volume remains constant, v2 = v1. Enter these values of x2 and v2 as shown, and click ‘Calculate’. 
You get the following result:
Fig. 3.33b. Properties of H2O from TEST – State 2
Note that condensation occurs at T2 = 154.39 deg.C and the corresponding pressure P2 = 534.49 
kPa. And if we need the amount of heat rejected, it is equal to (u2 – u1), since volume is constant; and 
(u2-u1) = (2563.46 – 2638.89) = -75.43 kJ/kg. (-ve sign indicates that heat is rejected.).
Next, states 1 and 2 can be shown on a T-s diagram. Choose T-s on the Plots widget and the plot 
appears as shown below. Press ‘Connect states’, click ‘v = c’ tab to produce the const. volume line, and 
adjust xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax as shown:

Note that constant volume line passes through states 1 and 2, as it should.
Problem 3.5. A pressure cooker contains 1.5 kg of steam at 5 bar pressure and 0.8 dry. Find the quantity 
of heat which must be rejected so that the quality of steam becomes 0.4 dry…. [VTU, 2003]
Solution: Again, TEST is very convenient to solve this problem.
Open TEST, Click Map > Uniform system > Phase Change model. (See Figs. 3.18a and 3.18b.). State 1 
is at P1 = 5 bar, m1 = 1.5 kg, x1 = 0.8. Enter these values and press ‘Calculate’. All properties at state 1 
are presented immediately:
Fig. 3.34a. Properties of H2O from TEST – State 1
Next, enter parameters for state 2, i.e. m2 = m1, x2 = 0.4, v2 = v1; Press ‘Calculate’ and we get:
Fig. 3.34b. Properties of H2O from TEST – State 2
Since volume is constant, heat rejected = 
(u2 – u1) = (1331.263 – 2176.8577) kJ/kg x 1.5 kg = – 1268.4 kJ. (-ve sign indicates that heat is rejected.)

Problem 3.6: A rigid vessel contains 1 kg of wet steam at a pressure of 0.15 MPa. When the mixture is 
heated, the state passes through the critical point. Determine:
i.	 the volume of the vessel
ii.	 mass of liquid and vapor initially in the vessel
iii.	temperature of the mixture when the pressure has risen to 3 MPa, and
iv.	 the heat transfer required to produce the final state (iii)….[VTU, 2004]
Solution: 
Note two points:
i.	 Since 1 kg of wet steam passes through the critical point in a closed vessel, it is clear that the 
volume must be equal to critical volume = 0.003155 m3/kg.
ii.	 Specific volume of wet steam is given by: 
Therefore, for a constant volume process, we can write, approximately:

...(3.8)
Where x1, x2 are the dryness fraction values at state 1 and state 2 respectively.

Open TEST, Click Map > Uniform system > Phase Change model. (See Figs. 3.18a and 3.18b.). State 
1 is at P1 = 0.15 MPa, m1 = 1.0 kg, v1 = 0.003155 m3/kg. Enter these values and press ‘Calculate’. All 
properties at state 1 are presented immediately: 
Fig. 3.35a. Properties of H2O from TEST
Note that internal energy u1 = 470.563 kJ/kg and quality x1 = 0.00181.
Next, calculate for state 2, with v2 = v1 and P2 = 3 MPa. We get the following screen, where we note 
that u2 = 1052.0969 kJ/kg, and T2 = 233.9 deg.C

For completeness, draw the T-v plot too. As explained earlier, select the T-v plot and the plot appears 
immediately. Draw the v = const. line by clicking v = c tab (see fig. below). Note that constant volume

Therefore, the solution is:
a)	 volume of the vessel = 0.003155 m3
b)	 mass of liquid and vapor initially in the vessel: By definition, ‘quality’ is the mass fraction of 
vapor present in the mixture. So, since the total mass is 1 kg, we have: mass of vapor = x1 = 
0.00181 kg, and mass of liquid = (1 – x1) = 0.9982 kg.
c)	 temperature of the mixture when the pressure has risen to 3 MPa = T2 = 233.9 deg.C, and
d)	 the heat transfer required to produce the final state 2: Q = (u2-u1) = 581.53 kJ.

We get mass, m1 = 5.65329 kg, enthalpy h1 =2625.9255 kJ/kg.
Now, some steam is blown off at constant enthalpy, till the pressure becomes 6 bar. i.e. at state 2,  
P2 = 6 bar, h2 = h1, and vessel volume remains same as Vol1. Enter these values for state 2. Click on 
‘Calculate’. We get:

Now, we note that the mass m2 in the vessel is m2 = 2.87224 kg.
Now, the vessel is cooled at constant volume Vol1 until the pressure is 4 bar; this is state 3. So, select state 
3 and enter P3 = 4 bar, Vol3 = Vol1, m3 = m2; click on ‘Calculate’. Properties at state 3 are presented:
Fig. 3.37c. Properties of H2O with TEST – state 3
Note from the above that steam quality, x3 = 0.6385.Therefore, we have the results:
i.	 Quantity of steam blown off = (m1-m2) = 2.781 kg.
ii.	 Quality of steam in the vessel after cooling = x3 = 0.6385
iii.	Quantity of steam in the vessel after cooling = x3.m3 = 1.834 kg of dry steam

Problem 3.9: Two boilers, one with a super-heater and the other without superheater, are delivering equal 
quantities of steam into a common main. The pressure in the boiler and main is 20 bar. The temperature of 
steam from the boiler with super-heater is 350 deg.C and temperature of steam in the main is 250 deg.C. 
Determine the quality of steam supplied by the other boiler. Take cp,s = 2.25 kJ/kg.C…..[VTU, 2001]
Solution: First, let us solve this problem with EES.
Let 1, 2, 3 denote boiler without super-heater, boiler with super-heater and the main.

Now, press F2 to get solution:
Fig. 3.39b. Solution with EES
It may be observed from the solution that quality of steam supplied by boiler-1 is 0.9257.
Now, let us verify this solution with TEST:
Open TEST, Click Map > Uniform system > Phase Change model. (See Figs. 3.18a and 3.18b.). State 1 
is at P1 = 20 bar, m1 = 1 kg, x1 = to be determined. Temperature T1 is also not known. However, from 
energy balance, we have:
m1 h1

m2 h2

m3 h3

i.e.
h1
m3 h3

m2 h2

(
)
m1
Enter these values for P1, m1 and h1, and press ‘Calculate’. We see that all properties can not be calculated 
at this stage:

Properties Of Pure Substances
However, we proceed to states 2 and 3 and ‘Supercalculate’ and TEST will refer back to state 1 and 
calculate properties at state 1 at that stage. 
For state 2, we have: P2 = 20 bar, T2 = 350 C, m2 = m1. Enter these values and click on ‘Calculate’. We get: 
Fig. 3.40b. Solution with TEST-state 2
Next, for state 3 (i.e. Steam main), P3 = P1, T3 = 250 C, m3 = (m1 + m2). Enter these values and press 
‘Calculate’. We get:

Now, click ‘Supercalculate’:Go to state 1 and following screen appears for state1:
Fig. 3.40d. Solution with TEST-state 1
It may be seen that quality of steam supplied by the boiler with no super-heater is: x1 = 0.93043.
‘Supercalculate’ also generates TEST code which can be copied to a MS Word file and used to regenerate 
the results at a later date if required, and also a property table. The property table from the TEST report

Solution: First, let us solve this problem with Mathcad. In Mathcad, there are no built-in properties for 
steam. So, we will get the steam properties from ‘SteamTab companion’ and use them in Mathcad for 
further calculations. Mathcad worksheet is shown below:
Let h1 = enthalpy of feed water at 50 C and 13 bar,
h2 = enthalpy of 0.97 dry steam
h3 = enthalpy of dry sat. steam

Determination of ‘quality’ (or dryness fraction) of wet steam:
3.6.1	
Throttling calorimeter:
Here, wet steam from the steam mains(state 1) is throttled in a throttling valve in such a way that the 
final state 2 is in the super-heated region. Throttling is a constant enthalpy process. In state 1, P and 
T are interdependent; so, P1 is measured. In state 2, both P2 and T2 are measured. See fig. 3.44a and 
3.44b. Then, h2 can easily be calculated (or found out from steam tables). Since h1 = h2, we can write:
h 1 h f1
x1 h fg1

i.e.
h 1 h f1
x1 h g1
h f1


.....(3.9)
and,	
x1
h 1
h f1
h g1
h f1

......(3.10)
Knowing P1, sat. liq. enthalpy hf1 and sat. vap. enthalpy hg1 are easily determined and thus the quality 
of steam in the mains, x1 is determined.

Observe that h1 = h2 = 2726.29 and x1, the quality of steam in the steam mains, is 0.961.
(h-s) plot for this throttling calorimeter is shown below:
Fig. 3.43d. Throttling calorimeter – (h-s) plot from TEST
Note: While using throttling calorimeter, it is important that the exit state 2 is in the super-heated region. 
Also, at least 5 deg. Superheat must be provided in state 2. Then, if the exit P2 is 1 bar (with Tsat = 99.61 
C), T2 should be, say, 105 C. Now, if the inlet pressure from mains, P1 is 20 bar, we see by a similar 
calculation in TEST that max. dryness fraction that can be measured with the throttling calorimeter is 0.94.
3.6.2	
Separating and Throttling calorimeter:
If the steam in the mains is very wet, i.e. by throttling the state 2 does not reach superheated region, we 
use a Separating and Throttling calorimeter, where excess water is separated in the separating section 
and the wet steam is then throttled in a throttle valve (TV) in the throttling section. See fig. below. 
Pressures P1, P2, P3 and temperature T3 are measured. Also, the moisture separated out in the separating 
calorimeter, ms, is measured; steam after throttling is condensed and this amount, mc, is also measured.

Conclusion:
In this chapter, we studied about pure fluids. Various property diagrams were explained, with particular 
reference to water. Use of software to plot property diagrams for different substances was demonstrated. 
Methods of finding out property values and generating property tables were also shown using different 
software. Determination of dryness fraction (or quality) of steam with ‘throttling calorimeter’ as well as 
‘separating and throttling calorimeter’ was explained.

Exercise Problems:
1.	 A 200-m3 rigid tank is filled with saturated liquid-vapor mixture of water at 125°C. If 25% of 
the mass is liquid and the 75% of the mass is vapor, find out the total mass in the tank.
2.	 Water is boiled at 300 kPa pressure in a pressure cooker. The cooker initially contains 2.5 kg 
of water. Once boiling started, it is observed that half of the water in the cooker evaporated 
in 20 minutes. If the heat loss from the cooker is negligible, find the average rate of energy 
transfer to the cooker.
3.	 A 0.25-m3 rigid tank contains 8.5 kg of water (in any phase or phases) at 500 kPa. Find the 
temperature in the tank.
4.	 A rigid tank contains 0.7 kg of steam at 9 MPa and 300°C. What is the volume of the tank?

6.	 A rigid vessel has a volume of 0.01 m3 and contains 4 kg of water at 40 deg. C. Calculate the 
quality and masses of liquid and vapor.
7.	 A pressure cooker contains 1.5 kg of sat. steam at 5 bar pressure. Find the quantity of heat 
which must be rejected so that the quality of steam becomes 0.6 dry. Determine the pressure 
and temperature at new state. 
8.	 The dryness fraction of steam at a pressure of 22 bar is measured with a throttling 
calorimeter. After throttling, pressure in the calorimeter is 13 bar and the temperature is 115 
C. Find the dryness fraction of steam entering the calorimeter.
9.	 What is the dryness fraction that can theoretically be determined in a throttling calorimeter 
if the steam to be tested is at a pressure of 15 bar and the pressure after throttling is 1.1 bar, 
with 5 degree C superheat?
10.	Following data are obtained with a separating and throttling calorimeter:
Pressure in the mains: 15 bar; condition after throttling: 1 bar, 115 degree C; Moisture collected 
in the separator in 5 min: 155 cm3 at 70 degree C; steam condensed after throttling, in 5 min: 
3.2 kg. Find the quality of steam in the mains.
