Preface
Sculpting software has changed the face of the 3D industry. Whether you are creating a 
character for the next Avatar movie or adding details to a post apocalyptic city in The Last 
of Us, 3D sculpting has become an essential tool for creating a level of realism in digital art 
that was much harder to achieve in the past. A couple of things that make Mudbox a better 
choice than other sculpting software is its ease of use, its industry-leading 3D painting tools, 
and its solid integration with other Autodesk products, which includes industry-standard 
software for 3D modeling and animation. Mudbox is also the first software to integrate vector 
displacement map extraction. This technology takes texture mapping one more step forward, 
similar to the introduction of normal maps which sparked the era of "Next-Gen" games. All in 
all, Mudbox is a powerful art creation tool that is only going to get better and more integrated 
with the industry's leading software.
What this book covers
Chapter 1, Ready? Set..., introduces you to everything you need to know to get up and running 
with Mudbox 2013. This chapter will cover techniques such as speeding up your workflow, 
downloading custom brushes and meshes from the Mudbox community, and getting a 
comfortable color scheme for your interface. This should be the first stop for beginners  
and veterans alike.
Chapter 2, Heads Up, will acquaint you with the Mudbox 2013 interface so you can easily 
customize and find the tools that you need. Some of the recipes will also help you set up the 
camera, lights, and brush properties so that you can familiarize yourself with the location 
of the attributes you may need to use in your future projects. This chapter is very helpful 
for showing you around, if you are new to Mudbox, but also has a few intermediate level 
techniques for those who are already familiar with Mudbox.
Chapter 3, Broad Strokes, teaches you how to work with various brushes and even create your 
own brushes to be saved for later use. The recipes within this chapter focus on getting familiar 
with the brush's properties and how to use the various brush settings to get the effects that 
you want. This chapter is for anyone trying to learn more about the brushes so that they can 
customize their tool set rather than rely solely on the default set of brushes.

Preface
2
Chapter 4, Fine Tooth Comb, goes deeper into the brush's customization by focusing on 
stamps and stencils. The techniques you will learn in this chapter will allow you to add the  
fine details that will bring your digital sculpts to life! This chapter will be useful for all levels  
but those who already use Mudbox regularly may learn a new trick or two in this chapter.
Chapter 5, Get In and Get Out, focuses on importing and exporting assets that can be  
used inside and outside Mudbox. You will learn things such as adding detail to your mesh  
with a displacement map, working with multiple objects in your Mudbox scene,  
and creating a terrain using an outside image.
Chapter 6, Shine On, dives into using Mudbox materials to define the look and feel of your 
objects. Materials include properties that define how shiny your object is and how transparent 
your object is, among other things. These attributes are important in defining what your object 
would be made of in the real world. What you learn in this chapter will enable you to make 
your object look as though you could touch it.
Chapter 7, Time to Paint, covers the biggest strength of Mudbox, texture painting. You will 
learn how to paint with projections, get rid of seams with the Clone brush, and paint various 
maps using Mudbox's layer system. The techniques learned here will be useful for all users 
from beginner to advanced.
Chapter 8, Ready for My Closeup, walks you through lighting, viewport filters, and other ways 
of making your work presentable. The features covered in this chapter can produce visually 
stunning results right within your viewport, which can then be rendered out into a turntable 
for your portfolio, using the final recipe of this chapter. Not only that but you will learn how to 
produce normal maps directly from your viewport which allows you to easily create a texture 
version of your sculpts that retains surface direction for lighting.
Chapter 9, One Step Forward, is all about posing your characters and models within Mudbox 
2013. This chapter will enable you to bring your characters to life by giving them dynamic 
poses and interesting silhouettes.
Chapter 10, Get Baked, explores how you would go about extracting your sculpt's details  
into various types of texture maps. The maps that you get from these processes are essential 
for creating low polygon game assets using the information that you extract from the high 
polygon sculpts.
What you need for this book
For this book you will need a copy of Autodesk Mudbox and 2D image editing software such 
as Adobe Photoshop (http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) or Gimp 
(http://www.gimp.org/). I recommend using the latest version of Mudbox (2013) to follow 
along with this book. This is the version the book was made for, so there may be a few recipes 
that don't apply to the older versions of Mudbox.

Installing Mudbox 2013 documentation
In addition to the recipes in this book, you may find yourself wanting to look through the 
Mudbox 2013 documentation for additional help. By default, when you navigate to Help 
through Mudbox 2013's interface, you will be sent to an online help page. If you have a slow 
Internet connection or lack a connection altogether, you may want to install a local copy of 
the documentation. After downloading and installing the local copy, it is a good idea to have 
Mudbox 2013 point you to the right location when you navigate to Help from the menus. This 
will eliminate the need to navigate through your files in order to find the documentation. The 
following recipe will guide you through this process:
How to do it...
1.	 First thing you will want to do is download the documentation from Autodesk's 
website. You can find the documentation for this version as well as the previous 
versions from the following link: http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/in
dex?siteID=123112&id=17765502.
2.	 Once you're on this page you can scroll down and click on 2013 for the language and 
operating system that you are using. The following screenshot is what you should see:
3.	 Next you will navigate to the location that you downloaded the file to, and run it.

Chapter 1
9
4.	 Now follow the prompts by clicking Next until the installation is complete. This file will 
install the documentation into your Autodesk\Mudbox 2013 folder by default. You 
can change this location during the installation process if you like but I recommend 
leaving this as the default location.
5.	 After the local version of the Help files are installed, we need to point Mudbox 2013's 
Help menu to the local copy of the documentation. To do this, open the Mudbox 
2013 folder, click on Windows in the top menu bar, and click on Preferences.  
The following screenshot shows how it should look:
6.	 Next, click on the small arrow next to Help so that more options open up. You will 
notice that next to Help Location it says Autodesk Web Site. We are going to change 
that to Installed Local Help by clicking on the small arrow next to (or directly on the 
text) Autodesk Web Site and choose Installed Local Help from the drop-down menu. 
Then click on OK.

Ready? Set...
10
Take note that if you did install your documentation to a different 
directory, then you will need to choose Custom instead of Installed 
Local Help. Then you will need to copy and paste the directory location 
into the Help Path textbox.
Setting up hotkeys
The first thing you will want to do when you start using a new piece of software is, either set 
up your own hotkeys or familiarize yourself with the default hotkeys. This is very important for 
speeding up your workflow. If you do not use hotkeys, you will have to constantly go through 
menus and scroll through windows to find the tools that you need, which will undoubtedly  
slow you down.
How to do it...
1.	 First you will need to go into the Windows menu item on the top menu bar.
2.	 Next, you will click on Hotkeys to bring up the hotkey window as shown in the  
next screenshot.
3.	 You will notice a drop-down menu that reads Use keyboard shortcuts from with  
a Restore Mudbox Defaults button next to it. Within this menu you can set your 
default hotkeys to resemble a 3D software that you are accustomed to using.
This will help you transition smoothly into using Mudbox. If you are new to all 3D software,  
or use a software package that is not on this list, then using Mudbox hotkeys should suffice.
The following screenshot shows the options available in Mudbox 2013:

Chapter 1
11
After choosing a default set of keys, you can now go in and change any hotkeys that you  
would like to customize. Let's say, I would like Eyedropper to activate when I press the E key 
and the left mouse button together. What you will do is change the current letter that is in the 
box next to Eyedropper to E and you will make sure there is a check in the box next to LMB  
(Left Mouse Button). It should look like the following screenshot:
How it works...
Once all your hotkeys are set up as desired, you will be able to use quick keystrokes to  
access a large number of tools without ever taking your eyes off your project. The more  
you get comfortable with your hotkeys, the faster you will get at switching between tools.
There's more...
When you first start using a particular software, you probably won't know exactly which 
tools you will be using most often. With that in mind, you will want to revisit your hotkey 
customization after getting a feel for your workflow and which tools you use the most.
Another thing you want to think about, when setting up your hotkeys, is how easy it is to use 
the hotkey. For example, I tend to make hotkeys that relate to the tool in some way in order  
to make it easier to remember.
For example, the Create Curve tool has a good hotkey already set for it, Ctrl + C, for the 
reasons mentioned as follows:
f
f
One reason it is a good hotkey is that the first letter of the tool is also the letter  
of the key being used for the hotkey. I can relate C to curve.
f
f
Another reason this could be a good hotkey is because if creating curves is 
something that I find myself doing often, then all I have to do is use my pinky finger on 
the Ctrl key and my pointer finger on the C key. You may think "Yeah? So what?" but if 
I were to set the hotkey to Ctrl + Alt + U it's a bit more of a stretch on my fingers and I 
would not want to do that frequently.
The point is, key location and frequency of use are things you want to think about to speed up 
your workflow and stay comfortable while using your hotkeys.

Increasing the resolution on your model
Before you can get any fine details, or details that you would see while viewing from close 
up, into the surface of your model you will need to subdivide your mesh to increase its 
resolution. In the same way that a computer monitor displays more pixels when its resolution 
is increased, a model will have more points on its surface when the resolution is increased.
How to do it...
The hotkey for subdividing your surface is Shift + D or you can alternatively go into the menus 
as shown in the following screenshot:
How it works...
What this does is it adds more polygons which can be manipulated to add more detail. You will 
not want to subdivide your model too many times, otherwise, your computer will begin to slow 
down. The extent to which your computer will slow down is exponential. For example, if you 
have a six-sided cube and you subdivide it once, it will become 24-sided. If you subdivide it 
one more time, it will become 96-sided and so on. The following screenshot from Maya shows 
you what the wireframe looks like from one level to the next:

Chapter 1
13
The reason this image was created in Maya is because Mudbox will only show the proper 
wireframe when your model reaches 1000 polygons or more.
The more powerful your computer, the more smoothly Mudbox 2013 will run. More specifically, 
it's the RAM and the video memory that are important. The following are some explanations 
on how RAM and video memory will affect your machines performance.
f
f
RAM is the most important of all. The more RAM you have, the more polygons 
Mudbox will be able to handle, without taking a performance hit. 
f
f
The video memory increases the performance of your video card and allows high 
resolution, high speed, and color graphics. Basically, it allows the Graphical User 
Interface (GUI) to have better performance.
So, now that you know RAM is important, how do you decide how much will be needed to run 
Mudbox 2013 smoothly? Well, one thing to consider is your operating system and the version 
of Mudbox 2013 you are running. If you have a 32-bit operating system and you are running 
the 32-bit Mudbox 2013, then the maximum RAM you can get is 4 GB. But, in reality you are 
only getting about 3 GB of RAM as the operating system needs to use around 1 GB of  
that memory.
On the other hand, if you are using a 64-bit operating system and the 64-bit Mudbox 2013 
version then you are capped at about 8 TB (yes, I said TB not GB). You will not need anywhere 
near that amount of RAM to run Mudbox 2013 smoothly. My recommendation is to have a 
minimum of 8 GB of RAM and 1 GB of video memory. With this amount of RAM and video 
memory you should be able to work with around 10 million triangles on the top level of  
your sculpt.

Notice the little white box next to Add New Subdivision Level in the following screenshot:
By clicking on this box, you will be given a few options for how Mudbox will handle the 
subdivision, as shown in the following screenshot:
The options shown in the previous screenshot are explained as follows:
f

Smooth Positions: This option will smooth out the edges by averaging out the 
vertices that are added. The following screenshot shows the progression from  
Level 0 to Level 2 on a cube:

Chapter 1
15
Subdivide UVs: If this option is unchecked when you create a new subdivision level, 
then you will lose your UVs on the object. To get your UVs back you will need to 
recreate the UVs for that level. This is discussed in a recipe found in Chapter 5, Get In 
and Get Out. If the Subdivide UVs option is turned on then it will just add subdivisions 
to your existing UVs.
f
f
Smooth UVs: If this option is turned on, the UVs will be smoothed within the UV 
Borders as shown in the next screenshot:

Ready? Set...
16
If you want your borders to smooth along with the interior parts of the shell, as shown in the 
next screenshot, then you will need to take a few extra steps to allow this:
This is the method Mudbox used in the 2009 and earlier versions. In Mudbox 2010, they 
switched the way they handle this operation so that the borders do not smooth. Here is an 
excerpt from the Service Pack notes from 2010:
 "A new environment variable now exists to alter how the Smooth UVs property 
works when subdividing a model: MUDBOX2009_SUBDIVIDE_SMOOTH_UV. 
When this environment variable is set, the Smooth UVs property works as it did in 
Mudbox 2009. That is, the entire UV shell, including its UV borders, are smoothed 
when subdividing a model whenever the Smooth UVs property is turned on. If this 
environment variable is not set, the default Mudbox 2010 UV smoothing behavior 
occurs. That is, smoothing only occurs for the interior UVs in a UV shell, leaving the 
UV shell border edges unsmoothed. Which UV smoothing method you choose to 
use is entirely dependent on your individual rendering pipeline requirements and 
render application used."
This has not changed since Mudbox 2010. So, basically what you need to do on a PC is add 
an environment variable MUDBOX2009_SUBDIVIDE_SMOOTH_UV that has a value of 1. To 
do this you will need to right-click on My Computer and click on Properties. Then, choose 
Advanced system settings and under the Advanced tab click on Environment Variables.... 
Under System Variables click on New.... In the blank where it says Variable Name enter 
MUDBOX2009_SUBDIVIDE_SMOOTH_UV and under Variable Value input a 1. Hit OK and  
it's all ready to go.

Moving up and down subdivision levels
Once you create subdivision levels using Shift + D, or through the menus, you can move up 
and down the levels you have created by using the Page Up key to move up in levels, or the 
Page Down key to move down in levels. But keep in mind, you will not be able to go any higher 
than the highest level you created using Add New Subdivision Level and you will never be 
able to go below Level 0.
Another thing to take into account is which model you are subdividing. If you have multiple 
objects in your scene, you need to make sure the correct mesh is active when subdividing. 
The following are a couple of ways to make sure you are subdividing the correct mesh:
f
f
One way is to select the object in the Object List before hitting Shift + D.
f
f
Another way is to hover your mouse cursor over the mesh that you want to  
subdivide and then hit Shift + D. This will subdivide the mesh that is directly 
underneath your cursor.

The Sculpting on different subdivision levels effectively recipe
Bookmarking the camera view
This recipe will teach you how to add bookmarks for your camera positions. This is great for 
setting up different angles that you would like to come back to.
Let's say you are working on sculpting a head and you have a photo reference of the head you 
are trying to portray but the pictures are from different angles. One technique you could use 
is to set up bookmarks of your camera in different positions around your model that match 
the angle of the real world cameras from the photos. This way you can switch back and forth 
between the different views and try to match the sculpt to the reference as best as you can.
Getting ready
Before you set the bookmark, you will want to adjust the camera position until you have the 
desired angle. You can do this by using whichever hotkeys you have set up for navigating 
through your workspace. The Mudbox default hotkeys for this are shown as follows:
f
f
Rotate Around: Alt + left mouse button
f
f
Pan: Alt + middle mouse button

How to do it...
1.	 You can find the Camera Bookmarks tool panel on the lower right-hand side corner 
of your screen, as long as you haven't moved it. It is docked inside the same panel as 
Stamps, Stencils, Falloff, Material Presets, and Lighting Presets.
2.	 Once your angle is set, you will go into this panel and click on the little arrow at the 
upper left-hand side corner of the panel. This will open up a drop-down menu with the 
menu item Add Camera Bookmark. The following screenshot will help you find what 
you are looking for.
3.	 Once you have done this you will be asked to name the bookmark. One cool feature 
about the Mudbox Camera Bookmarks is that the thumbnail it produces is an exact 
match to your viewport to help you with remembering which angle the camera was at.
4.	 Now, all you have to do is click on the bookmark thumbnail and the camera will snap 
into place.
5.	 You can also hover your mouse over the thumbnail for a larger thumbnail image with 
the name to appear.
How it works...
What this does is, it takes the position and rotation of the virtual camera and stores that 
information into a button. It also takes a screenshot of the viewport and resizes it into a 
thumbnail to help you remember the angle of the bookmark.
There's more...
If you would like to rename or delete a bookmark, all you have to do is go into the same menu 
where Add Camera Bookmark is located and choose your desired menu item. Keep in mind 
you must select the bookmark that you would like to affect before going into the menu.

download and enable stamps, stencils, and base meshes:
2.	 To get to the tools we are looking for, you will need to click on the LIBRARY menu 
item on the left-hand side of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Once you click on LIBRARY, it will open up to show you the three subcategories 
Stamps, Stencils, and Base Meshes. If you click on one of these, your viewport  
will show thumbnail images with the name, category, artist name, size, date added, 
and a ranking to help you find what you are looking for.

4.	 On the top, right-hand side area of your viewport, you will find ways to sort the list by 
most recently added, most downloaded, or highest ranked.
5.	 There is also a search textbox that will allow you to type in what you are looking for.
6.	 You may also choose which category to search under, as well as how recently it has 
been added.
7.	
If you click on the button shown in the following screenshot, it will download and 
enable the chosen stamp, stencil, or base mesh. It will also be added to your list  
of stencils, stamps, or base meshes.
How it works...
The Mudbox Community window is set up so that you can easily go into a database  
of user-created tools to use for your own projects. You can also easily upload your own  
stencils, stamps, and base meshes for other artists to use.

Adding and adjusting your image planes
This recipe will teach you how to apply an image plane to your camera/viewport so that you 
can look at reference photos in your workspace.
Getting ready
First you will need an image that has been saved as .jpg, .bmp, .png, .tga, .tif, .gif,  
or .exr.
How to do it...
1.	 To apply the image to your image plane, first go to the Object List tab on the  
right-hand side of the Mudbox workspace. It is located between the Layers and 
Viewport Filters tab.
2.	 Next, go to the list under Name and find which camera you would like to attach it to.
3.	 The default camera you are looking through is the perspective camera. If you would 
like to switch cameras you can right-click on the camera you would like to use and 
choose Look Through.
4.	 Once you have chosen which camera you would like to add the image plane to, click 
on the + next to the name of the camera. This will drop down two menu items, Stencil 
and ImagePlane.
5.	 Now, you are going to select ImagePlane and the properties below this window will 
show an option to Import or Export an image. The following screenshot is what the 
window looks like with the Properties and Object List tab open.

Chapter 1

6.	 The next thing you're going to do is click on Import and choose your image file.  
Once it is imported you will see it appear in your viewport. 

Ready? Set...
24
How it works...
When you apply an image to the image plane, it is basically setting up a billboard image that 
always faces the camera, no matter how much you rotate, zoom, or pan your camera.
The image plane will only be visible through the camera that you are looking. This can be helpful 
since you could apply reference images of different angles to each camera. For example, if you 
are working on a head, you can apply an image of the face to the front camera, and you can 
apply an image of the profile of the face to the side camera. This way you will be able to switch 
between cameras and only have the images you need from that view. Otherwise your workspace 
could get very cluttered with many images of all angles in one view.
There's more...
If you need to adjust the image plane, you can use the following hotkeys:
f
f
e + left mouse button will rotate the image
f
f
e + middle mouse button will pan the image
f
f
e + left mouse button + middle mouse button will scale the image
f
f
e + right mouse button will adjust the depth of the plane
Advanced properties
Under the advanced drop-down menu for the image plane, you will find settings for Visibility 
and Depth. You can either input a number into the textbox or you can use the slider to adjust 
the value.
f
f
Visibility: This determines how transparent the image plane will be. The closer it is to 
1, the more visible it becomes, whereas adjusting the value closer to 0 will cause it to 
become more transparent.
f
f
Depth: This determines how far away from the camera the image plane will sit. This 
will not change the size in the viewport but it will make the image appear behind 
the objects in your scene, or in front of them, depending on what values you use. By 
default, the depth slider goes from 0 to 1000, 1000 being the farthest away and 0 
being the closest. If you would like the plane to be even farther away, you can type a 
value into the textbox and the slider will readjust itself, making the number you input as 
the new maximum value. For example, if I enter 3000 into the textbox, then the slider 
will now slide from 0 to 3000 instead of the original 0 to 1000.

Chapter 1
25
Transformation properties
The last section in the image plane properties is called Transformation. This section shows 
and allows you to change the values associated with the image plane's Translation (location), 
Rotation, and Scale. The quickest way to alter these values is by using the hotkeys mentioned 
earlier, but if you would like to go in and assign values manually, this is the place to do it. Note 
that next to Translation there are three textboxes. These are for the X, Y, and Z coordinates of 
3D space.

Sculpting on different subdivision levels 
effectively
This recipe will discuss how sculpting on one subdivision level will affect the other subdivision 
levels and how to account for this in your workflow.
Getting ready
First you will need a model that has multiple subdivision levels.
How to do it...
The basic idea is that you want to create large details on the lower levels and get finer with 
your details as you move up in level. This is a good idea in any medium as it allows you to get 
the shape, composition, and design figured out, before you start applying all the finer details 
only to realize that your foundation is not so great.
What is nice about Mudbox is that even if those large foundational shapes are not right at 
first, you can always go back down in the levels and reshape the sculpt while keeping the 
details you have already added.

Ready? Set...
26
How it works...
Mudbox stores the information from all the levels and applies any changes to all the layers. 
So, even if you are on a lower level and cannot see the higher level details you can still affect 
the shape and details of the higher levels.

Recording a movie while you work in 
Mudbox
This recipe will show you how to record the viewport while you work. This can be useful  
for creating your own tutorials or showing friends or employers your creation process.
Getting ready
First, you will need enough space on your computer to hold the movie file that you create. 
These files can get very large depending on what resolution you are recording at.
Then, you will also want to have your model at a point where you would like to start recording. 
Keep in mind this will not record audio.
How to do it...
1.	 To start recording, you can go to Render | Record Movie and you will see the 
following window after you click on it:

Chapter 1
27
2.	 On this screen you will adjust the settings to what you need. The first thing you will 
need to adjust is Size. You can use the Presets drop-down menu or you can enter  
a custom resolution into the textboxes.
3.	 Next, you will adjust the Timing, giving you the ability to make the file size smaller  
by recording fewer frames or to speed up or slow down a sculpt. If you record with  
a high frames/second timing and play back at a low frames/second timing, your 
video will be slow and slightly choppy in its movement. If you set the record with 
frames per second as low and the playback with frames per second as high,  
you will get a fast time lapse of your work.
4.	 By checking the Automatically pause recording when idle checkbox you will save 
lots of time by not having to cut out all the slow parts of your video where nothing  
is happening. If your mouse stops moving then your video stops recording.

5.	 The Preview window shows you what the beginning of the video will look like and also 
what the thumbnail for the file will be. If you mark the Mudbox Window option you 
will be able to see the toolbars. By marking the 3D View Only choice, you will only see 
the inside of the viewport.
6.	 Once you begin recording, there will be a countdown timer before the recording  
starts and you will have a Pause and Stop button in the lower right-hand side of  
the Mudbox window.
7.	
When you finish recording, you will see the window as shown in the next screenshot, 
which allows you to delete the recording or save it as one of a few different file types:
8.	 After hitting Save As, you choose where you would like to save the movie and it will 
create the file for you.
There's more...
You can also create a turntable by going to Render | Create Turntable Movie, which will give 
you this window:

Chapter 1
29
1.	 In the same way that you set the size of Record Movie, you will also need to set the 
size of the turntable. Actual Size will fit the sculpt perfectly within the window.
2.	 Under Timing, you can adjust the frames per second and the Number of Frames you 
want the turntable to be. The more frames you have, the longer it will be, and the 
more frames per second you have, the faster it will be.
3.	 The Movie Format section is like the Save As section of the Record Movie. Here you 
choose the type of movie file and you have a checkbox for Antialias. Antialiasing will 
improve the quality but it will increase your render times. This refers to the crispness 
of your edges.
4.	 Once you're ready, you can click on Create... and choose a place to save your  
file. It will start writing the file and you can see the process of the load in the  
bottom-left corner.

Setting up colors and other preferences
This recipe will show you how to customize the colors of the Mudbox workspace. Customizing 
the colors will help you feel more comfortable with the user interface and allow more options 
for users who are color blind. In addition to this, if you are accustomed to use another 
software's color scheme, you can mimic those colors to allow quicker and easier adaptation  
to Mudbox 2013.
How to do it...
In order to adjust the colors of your workspace, you will need to go through the following steps:
1.	 Go into Windows | Preferences and click on the drop-down arrow next to Color. This 
will reveal the colors that you can customize as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
31
2.	 Now, click on one of the colors next to the element you would like to change and you 
will be shown the window as seen in the first screenshot of step 3.
3.	 There are different ways to choose your color, and once you choose the color that you 
want, you can store it in the swatches on the top of the window where the tiny x's are. 
The different ways to choose a color are explained as follows:
i.	
One way is to choose the dropper tool to pick a color that is on the 
screen. Next to the dropper tool, you have few very saturated colors 
along with a white to black gradient. The Color History thumbnail shows 
the previous color you had selected next to the new color you have 
chosen. This allows you to compare the value, saturation, and hue  
of your newly selected color to your previous one.
ii.	
You could also use Ring which resembles a color wheel with a square in 
the middle. The square in the middle increases in saturation as you go 
from left to right and it increases in value as you go from top to bottom 
as shown in the following screenshot:

Ready? Set...
32
iii.	 Next, you have Spectrum which shows the different values of a color 
going from light to dark across, while changing hues vertically. To adjust 
the saturation of your color, you could use the slider below the hue and 
value selection window as shown in the following screenshot:
iv.	 Another way to select your color is from an Image. Once you load an 
image, you can aim your crosshairs at the color you would like to sample. 
The following screenshot shows the Image tab:

Chapter 1
33
v.	
The Blend tab allows you to mix four colors and choose a color from that 
mixture as shown in the following screenshot:

Ready? Set...
34
4.	 The next drop-down menu is labeled Numeric Input. This menu item consists of RGB 
and HSV sliders, as follows:
i.	
The RGB sliders will let you increase the red, green, and blue channels 
on different sliders. You can even change the range from 0 to 1.0 or 0 to 
255 depending on what units you are accustomed to working with. It is 
shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 1
35
ii.	
The HSV sliders will allow you to adjust the hue, saturation, and value of 
a color. The hue bar will slide you through the various colors on a 0-360 
scale. The saturation and value sliders are on a 0-1 range. Having a 0 in 
the saturation makes it gray scale while 1 is a fully saturated color. 0 in 
the value slider will give you black while a 1 gives you white, as shown in 
the following screenshot:

Ready? Set...
36
5.	 The final way to choose your color is by using Color Palettes.
i.	
You can create, load, or save your own color palettes. It is usually a good 
idea to create a color palette that suits the need of the piece you are 
working on. The default palette looks like the following screenshot with  
a wide range of colors:

If you adjust some of your preferences and you find that Mudbox isn't acting quite right, then 
you may want to go back to the default settings. As with other software of this nature, your 
preference settings can get corrupted at times. To fix this, you'll just need to do the following:
f
f
Go into the Documents folder where you will find the Mudbox folder.
f
f
Open up the Mudbox folder and you should see a folder labeled as the version 
of Mudbox that you are using. For example, if you are using Mudbox 2013 64-bit 
version, then the path to the Settings folder should be something like this:  
C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\Mudbox\2013-x64.

Chapter 1
37
f
f
Open this folder and you should see a Settings folder.
f
f
Delete this folder to reset Mudbox's preferences back to its default.
Deleting this folder can fix a lot of different issues. If you notice strange things happening, you 
may want to try deleting this folder.
If you go into the Settings folder, you will notice some files inside. These files split up your 
settings into more specific categories. For example, sometimes you will have issues but you 
don't want to lose all your image-browser bookmarks or your hotkeys. What you can do in this 
case is save these individual files to a separate location as a backup for these settings. Once 
these files are backed up, go ahead and delete the Settings folder from your documents. The 
next time you run that version of Mudbox, the Settings folder will be replaced with the default 
one. Now you can try copying the backed up files back into the Settings folder and overwrite 
the default ones. This should bring your bookmarks, hotkeys, and other settings back.
As long as it is not that specific file that was corrupted in the first place, you should be back on 
track with no issues and the important preferences intact.

Setting up your Wacom tablet
This recipe will describe how you can set up a Wacom tablet for use with Mudbox. A Wacom 
tablet is a tablet that you can draw on with a digital pen, to allow for more organic lines and 
shapes in your digital paintings or sculpts.
Getting ready
First, you will need to plug in your Wacom tablet. Next, you will need to make sure you have 
the latest drivers for your tablet installed. You can find the latest drivers for any Wacom 
product at Wacom's website, www.wacom.com/CustomerCare/Drivers. Your tablet may 
have also come with a disc that has the drivers on it. You may need to restart your computer 
once the drivers are installed.

How to do it...
Now that you have the drivers for your tablet, you can go to Wacom Tablet Properties shortcut 
by hitting the Windows key and typing in wacom. This should reveal the Wacom Tablet Properties 
shortcut in your start menu list. Next, you should click on this shortcut to reveal the window that 
looks like in the following screenshot:
The Tablet section will list the tablets you have installed and connected to your machine. Tool 
is where you will choose which part of the tablet you would like to set up, the pen or the tablet 
itself. If you click the + across from Application, you will be able to add a customized setup for 
any software installed on your system. Otherwise, it will use the settings you have configured 
under All Other.
It is recommended that you set your pen buttons to Middle Click and Right Click for camera 
navigation. With these settings you will be able to do the following:
f
f
Tumble (rotate around a center point of interest) the camera by holding Alt and 
dragging the pen tip along the surface of your tablet
f

f
Dolly (zoom toward and away from a center point of interest) the camera by holding 
Alt and holding the button on your pen that was set to Right Click while moving the 
pen tip just above the surface of your tablet
Alternatively, you could set up your navigation keys to use the buttons on your tablet itself. 
Keep in mind that you can set your tablet buttons and your pen buttons to anything you want, 
including a keystroke, which will allow you to enter a series of key presses. This is helpful for 
mapping hotkeys to your tablet buttons or your pen buttons.
You can also set the slide bar to allow you to zoom or resize your brush size or intensity.  
In the following screenshot, you will see an example of the tablet settings window:

The quickest and easiest way to get in and out of expert mode is to use the hotkey T. This will 
toggle between having toolbars or no toolbars around your workspace. If you would like to go 
into expert mode, through the menus you can go to Display | Expert Mode as shown in the 
following screenshot:
How it works...
When you enable Expert Mode, it hides all the toolbars except the main menu on top so that 
you have a larger space to work in. The reason it is called Expert Mode is because you will 
need to have memorized the hotkeys that you will use to work on your project. Also, it's a good 
idea to familiarize yourself with the right-click menu before using this mode.
You can also customize which toolbars disappear when you enable Expert Mode by going to 
Windows | Preferences and clicking on the drop-down list for User Interface. At the bottom 
of the options listed here, you will see Expert Mode Hides: with some checkboxes for different 
toolbars. The following screenshot is what the menu should look like:

Chapter 1

There's more...
The primary reason you would want to work in Expert mode is to maximize your viewing space 
on your monitor. Another thing you can do to give yourself more monitor real estate is to work 
in Full Screen mode. This mode will enlarge the Mudbox 2013 window to fit the entire screen  
as opposed to just your desktop area, which will leave the start menu bar in Windows.
To use Full Screen mode, you can go to the same menu as Expert Mode, under Display,  
or you can use the hotkey, Ctrl + T.
I recommend using these two tools together to help you focus (no distracting UI elements)  
so that you can see more of your models at a higher resolution on the screen.

Introduction
This chapter will go over some of the different aspects of the user interface. This includes 
the properties of your cameras, brushes, lights, and so on. The tools and techniques that you 
learn from this chapter will help you understand Mudbox 2013's User Interface (UI). You will 
also have a greater understanding on how to navigate through the UI more efficiently.
Revealing the wireframe for edge location
This recipe explains how to show the wireframe on your model. Knowing how the topology 
conforms to your surface will help you to accurately place the details as well as inform you of 
the problem areas. One thing to look out for are star shapes created by more than four edges. 
These can cause strange pinching issues when trying to sculpt on the surface. When you 
subdivide your model, these areas do not get any better. Subdividing your model will only  
add more edges to the star.

How to do it...
There are three ways that you can enable your wireframe in viewport.
1.	 First, go to Display and you will find a checkbox halfway down the list for wireframe. 
This will also show you which hotkey is assigned to this action. The following 
screenshot is what the menu should look like:
2.	 Another way to toggle the wireframe is to right-click inside your viewport. This menu 
shows some of the same options as the main menu but is condensed into fewer 
choices and is laid out as a marking menu. The following screenshot is what you  
will see when you right-click inside the viewport:

Chapter 2
45
This type of menu is good for speeding up your workflow because you no longer have 
to scroll through menus to find the option you are looking for. If you memorize which 
direction your option is located in, within this menu, you can rely on gestures to use 
the tool that you need. For example, if you would like to toggle the wireframe quickly 
and you have memorized the location of this option, then you can just hold down 
the right mouse button (in the viewport), drag the mouse down (the location of the 
wireframe), and then lift your finger off the right mouse button. This will do the same 
thing as right clicking and choosing Wireframe with the left mouse button.
3.	 The final and easiest way is to use its hotkey, which should by default be W as shown 
next to the word "wireframe" in the main menu. Each time you hit W it will toggle the 
wireframe's visibility on and off.
How it works...
When you enable the wireframe, you are seeing a visual representation of the edges that 
make up your model. The more edges you have on your model the finer the detail you are able 
to add by adjusting the position, rotation, and size of these edges in 3D space. Essentially, 
all of the sculpting tools you use within Mudbox are for repositioning these edges and the 
vertices at the end of each edge. You should always make sure you have proper edge flow 
before beginning a sculpt of your model. You want to try and avoid having more than four 
edges meet at a vertex. This can cause issues when sculpting.
Also, take note that working in wireframe mode will increase your viewport refresh 
time, causing Mudbox to slow down while working with dense models or when your PC's 
performance cannot handle the wireframe smoothly.
Setting up a basic three point lighting 
scheme
This recipe will show you how to set up a basic three point lighting scheme. Three point 
lighting is mostly used for characters but can also be used on hero props or anything else  
you would like to pop out of the background.
In this recipe, I will sometimes refer to the scene that your object is in. This is for users who 
are bringing objects in from a larger scene. You can play around a little more with your lighting 
to establish a mood if you are just doing a sculpt as a standalone art piece.

Getting ready
First, you will need to know what type of lights Mudbox 2013 has. There are three light types 
available for use in Mudbox 2013.
f
f
The first is the point light which imitates the kind of light a light bulb would emit.  
This type of light radiates out from a single point in all directions. An example is 
shown in the following screenshot:
f
f
The second light type is the directional light which imitates sunlight. This light  
will shine in one direction with an infinite distance. An example is shown in the 
following screenshot:
f
f
The third light type is the image based light, which imitates the diffused lighting of 
an environment. This type of lighting uses the colors and values of an image mapped 
to an invisible sphere around your object as its lighting. An example is shown in the 
following screenshot: 

Chapter 2
47
Each of the three light types have different properties. They are as follows: 
1.	 Point light properties are as follows:


Diffuse:   This is the color the light will illuminate with. If you click on the 
color bar next to Diffuse, the color chooser will pop up, which is described in 
Chapter 1, Ready? Set....


Intensity: This determines the strength of the light. A value of zero will 
basically turn your light off. If you would like a value greater than one you  
will have to type it in as opposed to just using the slider.


Light Decay: This attribute determines how far the light will travel before  
it dissipates. Play around with the slider until you get the desired effect on 
your model.


Scale: This will change the size of the visual representation of the light itself. 
This will not affect the actual lighting of your object.


Show Grips: If this box is checked it will show a tool in the viewport for you to 
adjust the location of the point light.


Show Light: If this box is checked it will give you a visual representation of 
the light to help you locate the position of the light in your scene.
2.	 Directional light properties are as follows: 


Diffuse:  This is the color, the light will illuminate with. If you click on the 
color bar next to Diffuse, the color chooser will pop up, which is described  
in Chapter 1, Ready? Set....

Intensity: This determines the strength of the light. A value of zero will 
basically turn your light off. If you would like a value greater than one you will 
have to type it in as opposed to just using the slider.

Scale: This will change the size of the visual representation of the light itself. 
This will not affect the actual lighting of your object.

Locked to Camera: If this box is checked, it will keep the light in the same 
place relative to the camera. If this box is unchecked, it will keep the light in 
place relative to the object.

Show Grips: If this box is checked, it will show a tool in the viewport for you 
to adjust the angle of the directional light.


Show Light: If this box is checked, it will give you a visual representation of 
the light to help you see the angle of the light in your scene.
3.	 Image based light properties are as follows:


Intensity: This determines the strength of the light. A value of zero will 
basically turn your light off. If you would like a value greater than one,  
you will have to type it in as opposed to just using the slider.

Locked to Camera: If this box is checked, it will keep the light in the same 
place relative to the camera. If this box is unchecked, it will keep the light in 
place relative to the object.


Show Grips: If this box is checked, it will show a tool in the viewport for you 
to adjust the rotation of the invisible sphere that the image is mapped to. 


Image Based Light File: This is the file that will be used to light your object. 
By default, Mudbox will use a file called mudbox3PointDefault.tif. If 
you click on the ... you can choose a different file to light your scene with.
How to do it...
First you will create your key light. To create this, perform the following steps:
1.	 To do this you will need to go into the top menu and click on Create | Lights | 
Directional. You can come back to your light properties easily by selecting the light  
in your Object List. You can also rename the lights to help you identify each light 
more easily.
2.	 Next, you will move your light around to the location of your choice. You can do this 
by choosing your directional light in the Object List and then checking the boxes for 
Show Grips (to bring up the rotation gizmo) and Show Light ( to see the direction the 
light is facing in graphic form).
3.	 Now rotate the light so that it is shining from somewhere close to three-quarters 
of an angle (or somewhere from 30-60 degrees from head on). This angle will give 
nice shadows to help pop out the form of the object, more specifically a face. Just 
remember the point of the key light is to light up the center of interest on an object 
while keeping true to the lighting of its surrounding environment.
4.	 Next, you will adjust the light's intensity. It typically sits between 0.8 and 1.5 
depending on the strength of the light source. You can type this value in or use the 
slider until you reach a desired intensity.

Chapter 2
49
5.	 Make sure that the color you choose matches the color of the light source. For 
example, you will need to add some yellow or orange to your key light if the primary 
light source is a candle.
It will help details pop out on your model if the key light and the fill lights, or the secondary 
key lights, are complimentary colors. For example, the orange candlelight, from the earlier 
example, may have a bluish moonlight fill, accompanied by a stronger bluish direct moonlight 
being used as a rim light. You could also use a lower intensity orange fill light if there are other 
candles around and you want orange to be the dominant color, or if you want less attention to 
be on the facial features.
The bust below is lit by a key light only. As you can see, one half of the face has dark shadows 
with hard edges. There is no fill from bounced light to show the features in the shadow areas 
of the face. There is also no rim light to pop the head from the background.
Now you will create your fill light. To create, perform the following steps:
1.	 This light can be created by going to Create | Lights | Point.
2.	 It might be a good time to start naming your lights since you are using more than one. 
Go ahead and right-click on the light in the Object List. Now choose Rename Light 
and give it a name such as Fill Light or Orange Fill Light if you are using 
multiple fill lights.
Just remember if you are using multiple fill lights you may want to lower their intensity, 
as the light is additive so it may become brighter than you want it. If you want the 
intensity of your lights to be the same and add up to your desired intensity as a whole 
then you can take your desired intensity and divide it by the number of fill lights you 
are using.
3.	 To change the location of the point light, you will want to check the box for Show 
Grips and translate the light to your desired location. Since this light emits rays in  
all directions there is no need to rotate the light.

Heads Up
50
4.	 If you only have one fill light, it is usually best placed at the opposite angle from  
the key light. So, something like -30 to -60 degrees from the center line of your 
viewing angle.
5.	 Now you will adjust the intensity and color based on the bounced light.  
Also, remember that if your fill is too intense it will flatten out your model by  
making the shadows disappear. Too little fill and you won't see any details in the  
unlit areas of your model. No fill light is usually reserved for low lighting situations  
like candle-lit room with no windows. If there was a window you might add a bluish  
fill that is coming from moonlight through the window. Or you may just use a back 
light to represent the moonlight and leave out the fill. It all depends on the look  
and feel you are going for.
A good starting point for the intensity of the fill light is to set it at half the intensity of 
the key light.
These things are important to think about when setting up lighting for your sculpt. It is good to 
have a lighting set up that is similar to the setup that your scene has or that brings out more 
character in your models like using dramatic lighting.
The following is an example of a head being lit only by a fill light. Notice you can only see  
some of the features subtly. The fill light is meant to fill in the shadow areas with a touch  
of illumination.
Realistically, the fill light would hit the object from all sides to different extents, due to the 
bounced light in the environment. In a three-point lighting scheme, you don't always need 
the fill to hit all areas of the model because you have a key and a rim light that will help to 
illuminate the model from all angles.

Chapter 2
51
Last is the back light, also referred to as the rim light. To create, perform the following steps:
1.	 To create this light you will want to go to Create | Lights | Directional.
2.	 Now you will want to angle this light so that it highlights the silhouette of the object.
3.	 You may want to increase the intensity of this light for better definition.
4.	 The color can match a light source located behind the object in the scene and its 
intensity is often greater than the key light.
The bust below is lit by a rim light only. Notice how the rim light adds a thin highlighted edge 
to the model. This highlight can help separate a character from the background which can be 
very helpful when you have a character with a similar value as the background elements.
The following screenshot is an example of these three lights working together:

Heads Up
52
How it works...
The key light acts as your main light source. Typically this light would be either a directional 
light or a spot light. It will also usually be set to cast a shadow in a 3D scene since it is a  
direct light source. Depending on the light source, this light can be set to a variety of colors. 
red-orange for candlelight, bluish for moonlight, or yellow for sunlight.
The fill light brightens up the shadowy areas of the object you are lighting. This type of light 
simulates bounced light that you would see in the real world. You can use any type of light 
for this. On a blue sky, summer day, you may add a hint of blue to your fill light. If it is dusk, 
you may want to add a hint of purple, pink, or orange depending on the color of the clouds. 
You can even use image-based lighting to use the colors from an image and where they are 
located in 3D space. You would use an environment or reflection map to do this so that the 
colors are mapped in the correct location in 3D space.
The rim light or the back light is used to pop your object from the background. This light is 
similar to the key light in that it is usually another direct light source. The intensity of this  
light source is often exaggerated to give enough pop to the object.
Organizing your tabs for smoother 
navigation
In the 2013 version of Mudbox, they have added the ability to fully customize your interface so 
that you can define a layout that works best for you. This recipe will describe what you can do 
with your interface and how to do it.
How to do it...
Both removing and adding new toolbars to your interface is very easy. The following is a list of 
things you can do with the tabs located on Mudbox's main window where you can see the 3D 
View, UV View, Mudbox Community, and Image Browser:
f
f
First, to add a tab, you can right-click next to the existing tabs located at the top of 
your main window. Then go to New Tab and choose one of the many different kinds  
of tabs available in Mudbox.
f
f
If you would like to change the order of these tabs, you can click-and-drag the tab 
name from its current location to the end of the list of tabs.
f
f
To remove a tab you just right-click and choose Close Tab.
The rest of the tabs and windows act a little differently than the main window. This is because 
the main window is still using the older Mudbox version's way of customizing while everything 
else is using the new system for window layouts. The following is a list of ways to customize 
the other windows:

Chapter 2
53
f
f
First, to show or hide a tab altogether you can right-click next to the main menu,  
the right of Help, and toggle the check boxes for each window name.
f
f
To relocate a window, you will first need to uncheck the box next to Lock Layout 
inside the Windows menu. Once this is done you can click and drag the top of the 
window into your desired location. While dragging, the windows underneath the 
window you are moving will shift around and there will be a preview box for where 
that window will land. You can move the windows between other windows, next to 
other windows, or even into other windows. If you drag a window into another window, 
then the window that you dragged will become a tab within the other window.
f
f
You can also tear a window off into a separate floating window by double-clicking the 
top of the window. To re-dock the window, you can drag the window into the desired 
location in the interface and it will re-dock itself.
f
f
Once you have the desired layout for your windows, you can recheck the box next to 
Lock Layout in the Windows menu, to keep things in place.
f
f
If you would like to back up or share your layout, you can go into the Windows menu 
and choose Export Current Layout.... This will allow you to save a .mudui file that 
can be imported on other computers.
f
f
If you would like to import another user's layout, or even your layout that you are 
transferring from another computer, you can go into the Windows menu and choose 
Import Layout.... Now just browse to the desired layout, must be a .mudui file type.
f
f
Don't be afraid to tweak it until you get just what you need. If you can't seem to find 
something that works for you then you can always reset the layout to its default by 
going to Windows, in the main menu, and choose Rest Layout.
Locking down the camera for reference 
matching
This recipe will show you how you can lock down the camera so that you don't accidentally 
move your camera when you have it at a desired angle.
Getting ready...
First, an overview of the camera properties that you can adjust:
f
f
Transform: This is the section where you can lock various movements of the camera 
such as rotation or zoom.
f
f
2D Transform: This section allows you to scale, rotate, or reposition the view based 
on a 2D plane in front of the camera. You are able to disable the repositioning, 
rotation, and scale here as well.

Heads Up
54
f
f
Orthographic: You can also change whether or not the camera is an orthographic 
camera or not by simply checking the box.
f
f
Field of View (FOV): Next you will see the field of view which gives you a slider to 
adjust the lens of the camera.
f
f
Near Plane: This will determine how close objects can get to the camera before they 
start to disappear.
f
f
Far Plane: This will determine how far the objects can get from the camera before 
they disappear.
How to do it...
You may want to create a camera if you do not want to adjust the default camera's properties. 
To create a new camera you can go to Create | Camera in the main menu.
The fastest way to lock the camera is by going to the Object List and clicking in the space  
just before your camera name and just below the padlock icon, found at the top of the  
Object List window.
The following is the screenshot showing you where you can add the lock to your camera in the 
Object List:

Chapter 2
55
If you would like to lock the pan, rotate, and zoom, of the selected camera, you can go to 
the camera's properties by selecting your camera in the Object List. This should reveal the 
properties of your camera in the window below the Object List.
Once you're in the camera properties you can check the boxes in the Transform  
section. In the following screenshot, you can see what this section looks like in the  
camera's properties:
The following is a description of what each checkbox will do:

Creating a stone tile by adjusting brush 
properties
This recipe will guide you through the process of creating a stone tile using a couple of 
different brushes with their properties adjusted. After completing this recipe, you should  
feel more confident in adjusting your brush settings to get the effect that you desire.
How to do it...
Perform the following steps to create a stone tile by adjusting the brush properties:
1.	 First thing we're going to do is hit Ctrl + N to create a new file.

Heads Up
56
2.	 When the Welcome Window pops up, select the Cube under Start a new sculpture.
Mudbox comes with several starter meshes that you can start building upon instead 
of creating your own mesh from scratch. If you are starting a new project and don't 
see Starting points, found under Start a new sculpture in the above screenshot, 
that would work for your idea, then you can always go into the Mudbox Community 
tab and easily download a mesh that works for you.
3.	 Now click Shift + D several times until your cube reaches Level 8. This should give us 
enough resolution to get the details we need.

Chapter 2
57
4.	 With our mesh ready to go, select the Scrape brush from the Sculpt Tools menu on 
the bottom-left side of the UI. The following screenshot shows what the Sculpt Tools 
menu looks like:
We're going to adjust the properties of this brush so that we can create believable edges to 
our stone tile. In order to do so, perform the following steps:
1.	 If we use the Scrape brush in its default form, it will turn out looking something 
similar to the following screenshot:
Sure, it's a nice effect but it looks a little too waxy for our needs. To make this brush 
create a more faceted, heavier scrape we are going to open up the Advanced menu 
in our brush properties. This can be found on the lower right-hand side of the UI.
Now we are going to uncheck the Update Plane checkbox. It should look something 
similar to the following screenshot:
www.allitebooks.com

Heads Up
58
What this does is make it so the brush will scrape the surface down to the same plane that the 
initial stroke was made on. When this box is checked, it will scrape down to new planes as you 
stroke along different surfaces. As you can see in the following screenshot, the brush will now 
flatten the surface of your mesh using the angle of the surface you started the stroke with:
1.	 This still doesn't have a stone feel to it. So, what we will do now is add some texture 
to our Scrape brush. We will start by enabling one of the stamps that comes with 
Mudbox 2013.
2.	 Select the bw_cliffFace.tif stamp from the Stamp toolbar at the bottom-right side  
of the UI.
You can see the names of the stamps by hovering your mouse cursor over the icon 
in the Stamp toolbar. The following screenshot will help you locate the stamp I am 
referring to:
3.	 Now, when you test out the modified Scrape brush, it should look something similar 
to the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
59
We are getting a little bit of the texture at the start and finish of our stroke but not 
anywhere in between. To fix this we could adjust our Stamp Spacing, but as you 
can see in the following screenshot, this would create a repetitive texture along the 
surface of our mesh:
So, instead, we will set our Stamp Spacing to around 6.25 and check the box for 
Randomize, next to Use Stamp Image in the brush properties. Adjust the rotation, 
horizontal offset, and vertical offset sliders of the Randomize submenu. Your target 
settings should look like the following screenshot:
Now when you stroke the edge of your cube, it should look something similar to the 
following screenshot:

Heads Up
60
4.	 So, now that our brush is ready to add some edge detail, let's get sculpting! I 
recommend using a Wacom tablet or Cintiq for any sculpting that you do. With 
the pen in hand, or using the mouse, begin stroking over the edges of your cube. 
Continue stroking the edges of the cube and the edges that are created by your 
strokes until you have something that looks like the following screenshot:
Play around with where you start your strokes. Remember, the brush will produce 
different results depending on where your stroke begins. You may want to undo, that 
is, Ctrl + Z, at times if the brush affects your model in a way that doesn't look good. 
This process is really just a collection of happy accidents that the randomized stamp 
is creating.
5.	 Now that the edges are taken care of we can move on to the texture on the rest of 
the tile. For this step, we will select the standard Sculpt brush from the Sculpt Tools 
menu described in the earlier steps.
6.	 Next, set up your brush the same way you set up the Scrape brush, minus the Update 
Plane checkbox. You should have the same Stamp enabled with the same spacing 
and Randomize checked.
7.	
Once you have gone through this process again, you can begin sculpting the texture 
onto your stone tile. Play around with the size and intensity of your brush to get  
some variation in the texture. When you are done, it should look something like  
the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
61
There's more...
If you want to save these brushes you are creating, you can easily do so by clicking on the 
small arrow just below Sculpt Tools in your UI and choosing Add Tool. Now just give it a name 
like Stone Brush or Stone Edges. You should see your new tool at the end of the tool list 
in your Sculpt Tools toolbar.

Using the object list to manage multiple 
objects
This recipe will help you to better understand how to use the Object List tab. In particular,  
it will help you to understand how to use the Object List to manipulate multiple objects in  
your scene.

Heads Up
62
How it works...
1.	 First thing we will do is bring in the stone tile that was created in the previous recipe 
by either importing the .obj or by opening the .mud file. If you did not go through 
that recipe or you did not save what you did, that's okay. You can use a Cube with 
some subdivisions on it for this recipe.
2.	 Once your tile has been imported you can go to your Object List on the right-hand 
side of the UI and select cube from the list of objects in your scene. Your object 
should turn yellow when you select cube. The menu should look like the  
following screenshot:
3.	 Now you can right-click on the word cube or on the object itself, and choose 
Duplicate Selected. This should make a copy of your object in your scene.  
The copy will be placed directly on top of the original so we will need to move  
one of the objects over.
4.	 Select one of the cubes in your Object List as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 2
63
5.	 Using the Translate and Rotate tools under the Select/Move Tools tab, located  
in the bottom-left section of the UI, reposition one of the cubes next to the other.  
The following is a screenshot of the toolbar where you will find the Translate and 
Rotate tools.
The rotation will help to hide any repetition in the texture. After repositioning your tile 
it should look something like the following screenshot:
6.	 Now, repeat these steps a couple more times until it looks something like the 
following screenshot:

Heads Up
64
Keep in mind that if your tile has a very high resolution you may want to drop down a 
few levels by pressing Page Down on your keyboard. If your tile is 1 million polygons, 
then every time you duplicate a tile you are adding another million polygons to your 
scene. This can slow down your machine, a lot! 
7.	
Now that you have the four tiles in your scene, you can sculpt on all four objects at 
the same time! Give it a try. Add some more wear and tear or add carvings to your 
stone. The following screenshot is an example of a stroke affecting each object 
without lifting the pen or mouse:
There's more...
If you would like to work with multiple objects that are not duplicates of a model already in 
your scene, you can choose File | Import... and import another object into your scene. You 
can follow the steps mentioned earlier to move your object into your desired position.
Keep in mind that if you need to flip your object over any axis, you can do that within Mudbox 
2013. All you need to do is right-click on the object that you would like to flip and hover over 
Flip Mesh to expand the menu that lists the following flipping options:
f
f
The first three choices (Around X, Around Y, and Around Z) are for flipping in world 
space. This means it is being mirrored across the Mudbox grid axis.
f
f
The next three choices (Around Local X, Around Local Y, and Around Local Z) are 
for flipping in local space. This means that the object is being mirrored based on the 
bounding box of the object itself.
f
f
The last two choices (From Y-Up to Z-Up and From Z-Up to Y-Up) are to correct the 
orientation of your object if your 3D modeling software's grid orientation is different 
than Mudbox's. For example, if you are importing from 3D Studio Max then Z axis will 
be up, but if you import from Maya then your Y axis will be up.

Setting up layers for easily adjusting sculpt 
details
This section will discuss ways that you can organize and use your sculpt layers for more 
control over your model.
Getting ready
 First you will need an object with multiple subdivision levels. You can do this by clicking  
Shift + D until you reach your desired poly count, or at least until it starts slowing down  
your computer.
How to do it...
So, what you're going to do now is:
f
f
Hit the Page Down key until you reach the lowest level of your object
f
f
Then add a layer by clicking the symbol below which it is located in the Layers Tab
f
f
On the lower level layers, you will sculpt your largest details, blocking in the major 
shapes of the object
f
f
After you get the large shapes in, you will hit the Page Up key until you have enough 
polygons to add the next level of detail
f
f
Then you will add another layer the same way you added the first layer
f
f
Now you are going to sculpt the medium size details
f
f
Now repeat those steps for all levels of detail
f
f
When you reach the higher level layers you can begin using stamps and stencils for 
the finer details

Heads Up
66
How it works...
What this does is it allows you to change the large shapes later on by going to the lower 
levels and moving things around while preserving the finer details that are kept in the higher 
level layers. It will also allow you to adjust the opacity of the different levels of detail without 
affecting all the other details you have applied to your model.
There's more...
One more thing you can do to help keep things manageable is to keep different types of  
detail or detail for different areas of your model as separate layers even if it's on the same 
layer. This will give you more control over the intensity of those details individually and will 
allow you to make changes to those details without destroying the details from another layer.
Combining layers
You can also combine layers in the following two ways:
f
f
One way is to hide all layers you would not like to combine by clicking on the circle 
beneath the eyeball in the Layers Tab. Then you right-click on one of the layers and 
choose Merge Visible from the right-click menu.
f
f
The other way is to combine all the details from your layers and apply it directly to the 
model and eliminate all layers. To do this, right-click on any layer and choose Flatten 
from the right-click menu. If you do this you will lose the ability to control each set of 
details individually since you are eliminating those layers.
Duplicating or deleting layers
Another thing you will find in the right-click menu or your layers is the ability to delete your 
layer or duplicate it.
Deleting a layer will get rid of your layer and erase any details that were sculpting on that layer.
Duplicating a layer will add a new layer with the same details as the layer you duplicated.  
This will essentially double the intensity of the details that were sculpted in that layer.
Mirroring and flipping details of a layer
Another interesting thing you can do from the right-click menu is to mirror a detail you have 
already created or flip that detail over to an opposite side of the model. In order to do this, you 
will need to use the Select Faces tool and paint the faces of details you want to mirror or flip 
and then right-click and choose Mirror or Flip and designate which axis you would like it to 
mirror or flip over.

Introduction
In this chapter, we will talk about some of the different brushes you can use, how to customize 
them, and a few tricks for using brushes, that you may not have thought about using, for a 
particular problem in Mudbox 2013. With the knowledge obtained in this chapter, you will be 
well on your way to developing a customized toolbox that will help you get things done faster 
and more efficiently. If you continue to put these recipes into practice, you will build a library 
of brushes that can tackle any number of problems.
Creating a concrete damage brush
This recipe will show you how to create a Noise brush in Mudbox 2013. Sculpting with noise 
brushes is a great way to add finer details to organic objects or to add damage to hard surface 
models. In this recipe, we will create a brush shape in Photoshop and bring it into Mudbox 
2013 to use with our sculpting tools. The brush we will be creating is targeted at sculpting 
concrete damage but can be used for other purposes. Having a tool like this in your library is 
essential for any artist who is creating photo-real assets for movies, television, print, or games.

Broad Strokes
70
How to do it...
To create a Noise brush, you will need a little help from an external image editing 
software. Go through the following steps:
1.	 The first thing you will want to do is use an image editing software such as 
Photoshop to create the shape of the brush. I will be using Photoshop because  
it is the most widely used industry standard for image editing.
2.	 One quick and easy way to get a good brush for creating concrete damage in 
Photoshop is to fill a layer with any color, set your foreground and background 
colors to black and white, and then go to Filter | Render | Clouds to get a nice 
spread of values. It should look something like the following screenshot:
3.	 Next, you will need to adjust the levels to harden up the edges of the brush as shown 
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 3
71
4.	 Now, it is important to paint out the white areas that touch the border of the image. 
 If you leave these, you will have hard, straight lines on the edges of your brush  
where the white areas meet the border. Your brush should end up looking like the 
following screenshot:
5.	 Now save your brush as a .png, .jpg, .gif, .bmp, .tif, .tga, or .exr file. I 
prefer using .tga because it works best in Maya's viewport and because it provides 
better quality to your images while keeping your files relatively small.
6.	 The next step is bringing this brush shape into Mudbox 2013. There are a couple  
of ways you can do this, such as the following:


Choose Add Stamp in the Stamp menu at the bottom right of your 
workspace and browse to the file you saved.

Broad Strokes
72


Alternatively, you can go to the Image Browser tab and browse to your 
image. Once you find the image, you can select it and click on the Set  
Stamp button in the top menu bar as shown in the following screenshot:
7.	
Once your brush shape has been imported, choose a base brush to make adjustments 
to. The sculpt brush will be fine. Just click on the Sculpt brush in the Sculpt Tools 
section in the lower-left portion of your workspace.
8.	 Now enable your stamp by choosing it from the thumbnails in the Stamp section  
of your workspace.
9.	 The first thing you will want to do is check the box for Invert Function under the 
Sculpt Tools properties. If you do not check this box, then your brush will raise the 
surface of the model instead of eating into it.

Chapter 3
73
10.	 Next, adjust the properties of how the stamp will behave. We would like our stamp 
to be random in size and angle. We can accomplish this by adjusting the sliders in 
the Randomize section under the Use Stamp Image section of the sculpting tools 
properties. The following screenshot shows one possible configuration for  
the randomization:
11.	 Now we need to make sure there is enough spacing on the stamp so that we don't 
stack our details. In order to adjust this, you will have to check the Stamp Spacing 
checkbox below the Use Stamp Image section. You may not be able to adjust the 
slider far enough so that your brush details won't stack. If this is the case, then you 
will need to type a number into the input box next to Distance. This will readjust the 
slider and make the number you type in the new maximum value.
12.	The last step is to make sure your Falloff is set correctly. To adjust the Falloff you will 
go into the Falloff section present in the Tools' properties and adjust the image so it 
looks like the following screenshot. This will make sure all the details of your brush 
have an even intensity. You don't want this brush to fade away near the edges.

Broad Strokes
74
This brush can also be used to create rust and other natural corrosion. All you need 
to do is apply the stamp to the brush of your choice and build up the details on your 
model. The following screenshot shows an example of the brush:
Also, try making multiple versions of the same brush to get different shapes out of 
the brush. This will help hide any repetition.
Keep in mind, if you want to make it look realistic you will need to build up different 
kinds of details, some subtle, others less so.

Customizing your brush and adding it to your 
tool tab
This recipe will show you how to create your own brush presets. As mentioned in the 
Introduction, creating a library of brushes for different effects, such as metal scratches, 
dirt, weather damage, and different types of textures for representing various materials, will 
dramatically increase your professional value and will allow you to bring your own creations to 
life in a fraction of time. This recipe will guide you through the basics of creating a custom brush.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to create your own brush's presets:
1.	 First you will need to choose a brush to start from. Just choose any brush from the 
tool tab.
2.	 Next, you will go into the properties of that tool and adjust the settings to what you 
are looking for. You can use various stamps, adjust the randomizing properties for the 
stamp, adjust the falloff, or anything else you can find in the Properties tab.
3.	 Once your tool settings are in place, you will want to go to the Sculpt Tools tab menu, 
as shown in the following screenshot, and choose Add Tool.
4.	 This will bring up a window for you to name the tool. Once you hit OK the tool will be 
placed in the Sculpt Tools tab along with all the other brushes.

Creating your own Imprint brush for adding 
presculpted details
This recipe will go through the process of creating a stamp from a damaged wall sculpt that 
will be used with the Imprint sculpt tool to add details in other projects. By putting this recipe 
into practice you will dramatically increase the speed of your workflow. As you build up a 
library of stamps, which you create, you will be able to create much larger assets in a shorter 
amount of time while still keeping things original, as opposed to using other people's stamps 
or the default stamps.
Try to limit the use of non original stamps because these will stand out to the trained eye, 
also known as job recruiters. If you do plan on using a default stamp or someone else's stamp 
from the Mudbox Community, then I recommend using it as a starting point for creating your 
own unique stamps.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to create your own Imprint brush for adding presculpted details:
1.	 The first thing you will need is to create a sculpt of detail that can be re-used for many 
projects. For example, you might create a bolt, a wall crack, a metal dent, a small pile 
of trash, and so on. The sculpt I have created for this recipe is a pothole that could 
easily be repurposed as damage done to a concrete wall or another similar surface. 
The following screenshot shows the detail I will be using for this:

Chapter 3
77
Keep in mind you may need to do a little extra sculpting depending on what real world 
materials you are representing. For example, if this was a hole in a brick wall, you 
would probably want to start from scratch since the damage would look different. 
The bricks would create a different silhouette around the hole and you may have little 
pieces of mortar and brick chunks sitting inside the hole.
2.	 The next thing on the list is creating an image that we can use for our stamp. To do 
this, you will want to switch your view to a camera that is looking at your detail head 
on. In my case, I created the detail facing the Front camera. To switch the view to 
the Front camera you can right mouse button (RMB) click on an empty space in your 
viewport and go to Switch Views | Front View in the following menus. The following 
screenshot is an example of what this menu looks like:
3.	 Now that we have the right angle, you'll need a way of capturing the detail in a black 
and white image that represents the depth of the sculpt. To do this, you can go to 
the Viewport Filters tab, on the top right-hand side of the Mudbox interface, and 
enable Screen Distance. Your sculpt should be showing the camera distance using 
white as the closest surfaces and black as the farthest away surfaces. The following 
screenshot is of the pothole with the Screen Distance filter turned on:

Broad Strokes
78
4.	 With this viewport enabled, you can take a screenshot by hitting the Prt Scr (print 
screen) button, on your keyboard. Now go into Photoshop, or any other 2D image 
editing software, and hit Ctrl + N to create a new image, and hit Ctrl + V to paste the 
screenshot into the image. This will paste your entire screen (including additional 
monitors) into the image which means you will need to crop the image down to what 
you want included in the stamp.


When you crop the image it is a good idea to keep the image at a 1 to 1 
ratio, meaning the dimensions of the image will create a perfect square. 
The easiest way to do this is to use the Rectangular Marquee Tool (M) 
in Photoshop while holding down Shift. When you use the Rectangular 
Marquee Tool while holding Shift, it will make sure the selection is always  
at a 1 to 1 ratio.
5.	 Before saving the file, you need to make a couple of adjustments to the image such 
as the following:


First off, you need to invert the values of the image. You can do this by hitting 
Ctrl + I in Photoshop. If you do not do this then your stamp will have hard 
edges on its peripheries. This happens because Mudbox is interpreting the 
white areas of the stamp as areas that need to be pushed, or pulled if Invert 
Function is checked, while the black areas are unaffected.


Now, just to make sure that the blacks are fully black and the whites are 
fully white, known as normalization, you will want to adjust the levels of your 
image in your 2D image editing software. The easiest way to normalize the 
values of your image in Photoshop is to use the Auto Contrast (Alt + Shift + 
Ctrl + L) feature.


Ok, now you can save it. Hit Ctrl + S, give your file a name, and choose the 
TARGA format. See the following screenshot for an example of the File name 
and Format sections of the Save window.

Chapter 3
79
6.	 Your stamp image is now ready to be imported into Mudbox for use with your brushes. 
Just add the tool to your Stamp toolbar. For more information on this, you can refer to 
the Adding a stamp to your toolbox recipe in Chapter 4, Fine Tooth Comb of this book.
7.	
The next step is to select the Imprint sculpt tool from the Sculpt Tools toolbar, on 
the bottom left-hand side of the interface. The reason we are choosing this sculpt 
tool over choosing one of the others is because of the way it applies stamps to 
your model. Unlike the other sculpt tools, this tool works by clicking and dragging to 
determine the scale and orientation, of one instance, of the stamp chosen.
8.	 Now choose the Stamp you just added, in step 6, to the Stamp toolbar to enable it on 
this brush.
9.	 There are only two more things you need to do before the brush is ready to go, the 
first of which is checking the box for Invert Function in the tools properties.
10.	 The last step before you can start having fun with your new brush is to adjust the 
Falloff of the tool. Go to the Falloff section of your tools properties, on the right-hand 
side of the interface, and pull all the falloff curve handles to the top right side of the 
box. It should look something like the following screenshot:
This step is needed in order to keep the details true to what you have sculpted. If you 
adjust the curves in any other way, you will start getting variation in the intensity of 
your stamp as it gets closer or farther away (depending on the curve) from the center 
of the stroke.

Broad Strokes
80
11.	 Now your brush is ready to go. Just click-and-drag until you have the size and 
orientation that you want for your detail. When you let go, it will create the detail on 
your model. Don't forget to adjust the intensity of your brush to get the right amount 
of depth. The following screenshot is an example of some details I imprinted into a 
cube using only this brush with various intensities:

Using the Freeze brush to get hard edges 
and isolate your sculpting
This recipe will show you some of the useful ways to use the Freeze brush. The application of 
this tool can be extremely helpful by blocking out interesting shapes before sculpting. It is also 
very useful for indicating layers of materials. For example, you might use this tool to create the 
inset of a window or to define the shape of a carving set in stone.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to efficiently use the Freeze brush:
1.	 The first thing you'll need to do is choose the Freeze brush.

Chapter 3
81
2.	 Next, paint the areas of the model that you would like to be unaffected by your 
sculpting. If you end up freezing an area that you didn't mean to, or you would just 
like to unfreeze certain areas with your brush to make more interesting shapes,  
then you can use the Invert Function of the tool by holding Ctrl while you use the 
Freeze brush.
Alternatively, if you would like to unfreeze everything that you have frozen, then you 
can do so by using the hotkey for Unfreeze All, Shift + U. To find this without using 
hotkeys, you can go to Edit | Unfreeze All in the top menu.
3.	 Next, pick the basic Sculpt brush to pull the vertices of your model directly away 
from its surface. If you choose the Bulge brush, it will look like something is bulging 
out over the edge that was created with the Freeze brush as shown in the following 
sample screenshot:
4.	 You can also follow up with the Pinch brush and the Smooth brush to sharpen  
and soften the edge. You can also use the Knife brush or the Flatten brush to  
add damage as shown in the following screenshot:

Broad Strokes
82
There's more...
If you enable Steady Stroke on your Freeze brush you will be able to control your brush stroke 
more accurately. Steady Stroke is a feature that will give you a visualization of the line you 
are drawing in order to help with the accuracy of the stroke. The visualization created is of a 
straight line starting at the beginning of your stroke and pointing outward in the direction of 
your mouse cursor. The stroke will not be applied until you have reached the end of this line, 
resulting in more control and a smoother stroke.
In order to enable Steady Stroke you must go into the Properties section for your brush and 
click on the empty box next to Steady Stroke. The properties menu should look something like 
the following screenshot, depending on which brush you have chosen:
This feature works by showing you a green line (motion vector) that you can use to line up your 
stroke and create a more accurate line.
The length of the green line is determined by the value that Distance is set to.

Using the Fill brush for detailing corners  
and crevices
This recipe will start with a simple sculpt of a brick wall that we will add detail to, using the Fill 
tool. We will also use a few of the tools learned in previous recipes to add a little extra detail. 
Upon completion of this recipe, you will better understand the Fill tool and how to use it to 
your advantage. The more tools you learn and customize, the more issues you will be able to 
solve while creating your sculpts.
Getting ready
To get ready you should create a basic sculpt of a broken brick wall. Try using the tools 
you have learned in the previous recipes. It is very important to practice with the tools and 
techniques you are learning in these recipes, in order for it to become a part of your workflow. 
After practicing long enough, these techniques will become second nature to you and you will 
be able to solve problems much quicker. You should also start customizing your own tools 
based on what you learn in these recipes.
The following screenshot is of the brick wall that I will be starting with. There are some issues 
with this sculpt that we will critique so that you can learn from these mistakes.

Broad Strokes
84
Notice that my bricks are all of different sizes. To fix this, I could go in with the Grab tool and 
pull the bricks into place, or I could use a large radius Pinch brush with a low intensity to close 
the space between the larger bricks.
You may also notice that my bricks defy the law of gravity in some areas. To fix this, I could 
go back and use the Erase tool where bricks are floating or just sculpt in some more bricks 
to support the ones above. Believability is something you should look out for when creating 
sculpts. Think about each element in your asset and ask yourself, would this make sense in 
the real world.
If you were to ask yourself this question again, you might find that the bricks are too shallow 
to make sense. To fix this, I could go in and either duplicate the sculpt layer a couple of times 
to get the extra depth or I could go in with the Amplify brush and boost the depth and details 
across the entire sculpt. There would probably be some cleanup needed after doing this, but 
that is to be expected.
I find a lot of beginners who tend to leave out the finishing touches after completing a 
technique. If you are making adjustments to a large area of your model, it is very likely you will 
need to go in and make small fixes where it is needed. This step should not be skipped if you 
are creating a finalized asset. If you are creating a concept sculpt, that is a different story. For 
concept sculpts, you can be as loose as you want, and leave out the fine details as long as you 
are getting your idea across. 
Of course, the best thing to do is collect and use reference when you are creating any real 
world object. This will help you get the scale, silhouette, shapes, and details correct, right  
from the start.
How to do it...
Using the unrefined sculpt shown in the previous screenshot, we will now add some details to 
the grout and along the outside edge of our sculpted detail. The Fill brush will find the average 
location of all the vertices within the brush's radius and pull the deepest vertices toward that 
average. This allows you to fill in any crevices in your sculpt without affecting any of the details 
that are protruding from the surface of the model.
This tool can also be useful if you want details on the outside edge of a protruding surface 
but you do not want to affect anything beyond a certain distance. The distance of the brush's 
effects are determined by the size of the brush. Remember it is taking the average of the 
vertices within the brush's radius, therefore a larger brush size will extend the distance of the 
detail that is applied while a smaller brush will be limited to a smaller distance.
Now let's put this tool into practice by performing the following steps:
1.	 Select the Fill brush from the Sculpt Tools toolbar.

Chapter 3
85
2.	 Choose a stamp that will add some noise to the grout (the space between the bricks).
The following screenshot will show you a close-up of the bricks without the  
added detail:
3.	 Now begin to paint over the grout areas of your brick wall sculpt. Once you go over all 
the grout areas of your model it should look something like the following screenshot:
4.	 Now you can try out the outer edge trick. You can test it out with the same stamp you 
chose for the grout. Try different size brushes and paint along the outer edge of your 
outermost bricks. It might look something like the following screenshot when you  
are done:

This recipe will show you how to use the Grab tool to line up your model's shape with a 
reference image. Keep in mind you can do this before and after you have added details to 
your model.

Chapter 3

Getting ready
The following steps will help you to ready yourself in order to use the Grab tool:
1.	 First you will need the model that you will be sculpting.
2.	 Next go to Object List and right-click on the Front, Side or Top camera and choose 
Look Through. This all depends on which profile you are trying to line up.
3.	 Once you have brought in a model and chosen the camera angle that you plan on 
matching, you will want to go to the Image Browser tab and search for the image  
you would like your sculpt to match.
4.	 Then you will click either the Set Stencil or the Set Image Plane button on the top 
menu bar. If you are only using the image as a reference to line up your model, then 
using Set Image Plane will be fine. If you would like to paint features from the image 
onto your model using the Projection brush, then you will want to use the Set  
Stencil button.
5.	 When your image plane or stencil is set, you will go back to the 3D View and adjust 
the image plane or stencil's properties until you have the desired Translation, 
Rotation, Scale, and Visibility level.
How to do it...
Once you have readied yourself, perform the following steps to match a reference silhouette 
with the help of the Grab tool:
1.	 Once you have everything set up, you will select the Grab brush either by selecting it 
in the Sculpt Tools tab or by hitting the 3 hotkey (unless you have reassigned it).
2.	 Next you will go into the brush's properties and choose X in the drop-down menu for 
Mirror. This is if you are doing a symmetrical profile such as the front view of a face.
3.	 You will proceed in adjusting your brush's size depending on how large the forms, 
which you are shifting, are.
4.	 Then all you have to do is push and pull areas of the vertices around until you have 
matched the image.

Introduction
This chapter will show you different tools and tricks you can use to add finer details  
to your models. These finer details are mostly achieved by using stamps and stencils  
to help you sculpt.
While working your way through these recipes, keep in mind that the details you sculpt are 
limited to the resolution of the mesh you are sculpting on. If you plan on extracting texture 
maps from your sculpt, then the detail is also limited by the resolution of the texture maps 
that you extract.
The fine-detailing stage of a project is the stage that most beginner and intermediate artists 
tend to be in a hurry to get to. It is important to step back and look at your sculpt with a critical 
eye, to determine if your foundations are strong. Are your silhouettes creating interesting 
shapes? Do the shapes convey the feeling that you want the viewer to experience? Does your 
model have a focal point? Do other details in your model support the focal point? Are your 
proportions correct? It's easy to jump into detailing too soon which can end up being a big 
waste of time.

No matter how much detail you put into a piece of art, it will never make up for having 
strong foundations. Once you have the strong foundations in place, you can move on to 
the detailing phase, which is the fun part! This is where you make things believable.
To get better at detailing, you will want to pay close attention to everything you see in 
the real world. Learn how things work and how they are built. Study architecture, macro 
photography, Do It Yourself instruction manuals, or anything really!
Another mistake beginners make is that they do not pay close enough attention to how 
one material or object connects to another. For example, a beginner may model a door, 
but forget the hinges, or they might leave out the skirting board on a wall.
Another important thing to think about when adding details is the environment that the 
asset lives in and what kind of wear and tear it would endure. Is your asset located in an 
area that gets flooded? If so, you may want to add water damage or discoloration at the 
base of your model. Is your rock sitting in the middle of a river or a stream? If yes, then 
you probably should round out those corners and edges. The rocks you find in rivers or 
streams are usually rounded due to tumbling and erosion. Tumbling is when a rock gets 
carried by water and hits other rocks in the water causing any rough edges to break off 
and smooth out.
The detailing phase gives you the chance to tell a story with your model. Try adding 
elements to your models that hint at certain events that may have taken place around 
your object. This will add more depth, make your model more believable, and can help 
support the story you are trying to tell with your art. The story should also drive your 
creativity, acting as a guide for what your asset is going to look like.
Whether it's for a movie, a game, or a scene you have created for yourself, the recipes in 
this chapter will give you some of the tools that you need to make convincing sculpts for 
your future projects.
Creating a zipper using a custom stamp
This recipe will show you how to create a stamp which you can use to create  
a zipper. This technique can be applied to many other uses such as stitching  
and other repeated elements.
Getting ready
First thing you will need to do is create an image that will be used as your stamp.  
To do this, I will be using Adobe Photoshop, but any image editing software will do.

Chapter 4
91
The following image is what I created for the zipper stamp using simple tools  
in Photoshop.
Keep in mind, the higher the value, the stronger the intensity of your stamp. The black 
areas will not affect the model while the white areas will affect the model the most.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you create a stamp, in order to create a zipper: 
1.	 First you must choose a brush that can use a stamp. All of the sculpt brushes 
except for the Freeze, Grab, and Eyedropper brushes can use stamps. Each brush 
will have its properties set differently, so you will have to choose a brush that gives 
you the desired effect. For this brush we will choose Sculpt Brush.
2.	 Once you have chosen Sculpt Brush, you will need to add the stamp we just created. 
To do this, you can either use Image Browser or you can go to the menu for the 
stamp toolbar located in the bottom, right-hand side of the workspace.
3.	 Now your stamp should show up at the end of the list of thumbnails. Select it to 
activate it on your current brush. Choosing Off will disable it. The following screenshot 
shows the Stamp tab displaying all the available and custom stamps:

Fine Tooth Comb
92
4.	 Next thing you will need to do is adjust the brush's properties. It should look 
something like the following screenshot. The important settings are oriented to 
Stroke, getting the Stamp Spacing correct depending on the size of your stamp,  
and the Falloff set so that there is no falloff. Steady Stroke is optional.

Chapter 4
93
5.	 All that is left is to draw a zipper onto your model. 
Creating a custom stencil from a stone wall 
carving
This recipe will show you how you can take one of your sculpts and create a stencil from it 
that can be used on other models. Using this technique will help you build a library of details 
that you can come back and reuse. Even if you do not want to use the exact same details in 
another project you can use the stencils, created using this method, as a starting point for a 
new sculpt or stencil.
How to do it...
1.	 The following steps will help you create a stencil from one of your sculpts: The first 
thing you will do is create a sculpt of the details you would like to use as a stencil.  
For this example, I used curves (as seen in the following screenshot) to help with  
the spirals and straight lines.

Fine Tooth Comb
94
2.	 Now you will go into Top view so that you are looking at the sculpt straight on. One 
way to do this is by going to the Object List window, right-clicking on the Top camera, 
and choosing Look Through.
3.	 Another way you can do it is by using the right-click menu. After clicking into an empty 
area in the Mudbox viewport, you can hover over Switch View and choose Top View 
from the next menu that pops up. The following screenshot shows what the menus 
should look like:
4.	 The next step is to go to your Viewport Filters tab, turn and choose Screen Distance, 
then click on Save 16 bit Image.

Chapter 4
95
5.	 The image that is saved can now be set as a stencil. You can do this by either going 
to Image Browser, choosing the image, and using Set Stencil or you can go to the 
Stencil toolbar menu, choose Add Stencil, then choose your stencil's thumbnail from 
the toolbar. The following screenshot will show you what the example stencil looks 
like. The dark areas will affect the surface less than the white areas.

Fine Tooth Comb
96
6.	 Notice the image is created using existing height values. Any concave detailing will be 
lost in the orthographic representation.
7.	
Now you can use this stencil on another sculpt. The following screenshot shows what 
the example stencil looks like in action. This is a good way to lay down some initial 
details on your model, then you can go back and add wear and tear or any other 
details that will hide the repetition. 

Chapter 4
97
Here is a list of controls to change the visibility, size, rotation, and position  
of your stencil:


Q will hide the stencil


S + MMB will move the stencil


S + LMB will rotate the stencil


S+ RMB will scale the stencil
8.	 You'll notice that there is a seam between the two instances of this stencil. To correct 
this, we can bring our stencil image into Photoshop and paint out the seams. First, 
open up the stencil in Photoshop.
9.	 The next thing we need to be able to do is see our seams so that we can paint them 
away more easily. In order to do this you should go to Filter | Other | Offset... in the 
Photoshop menu.
10.	 When the options box pops up, you will set the Undefined Areas to Wrap Around and 
the Horizontal setting to half of your image's resolution. This will relocate your seam 
to the center of the image. The following screenshot shows what the options box 
should look like: 
If you are not sure what your image's resolution is, you can go to Image | Images 
Size... and it will bring up a window with your image resolution displayed.

Fine Tooth Comb
98
11.	 Now, by using a combination of Photoshop's Brush Tool and Clone Stamp Tool you 
will paint out the seam. As long as you don't make any changes to the outside edges 
of the image, you should be seam-free (only horizontally in this case). The following 
screenshot shows the wall design with no seams:
12.	You may notice that the spirals are cut off on the sides. This is because we need to 
Offset the image again to get the details into their original placement. Repeat step 
10 and you should be good to go. 
13.	Now, you can re-import your stencil to Mudbox.
14.	 You can also adjust other attributes of your stencil by going to the Properties toolbar 
located on the right-hand side of the workspace after selecting your stencil.

Chapter 4
99
15.	If you are working with a seamless stencil you can check the box for Show Tiles and 
for Use Tiles. This will tile your stencil allowing you to paint seamlessly across your 
model. The following screenshot shows these attributes in use:
There's more...
If you are creating a tiling sculpt like the one shown in the previous screenshot, you can also 
use Mudbox's new tiling plane feature. If you would like to know more about this feature you 
can read through the next recipe.

Creating a rock wall that tiles seamlessly in 
all directions
This recipe will teach you how to create a seamless tiling rock wall sculpt using the new tiling 
plane feature in Mudbox 2013. We will use some of the basic stamps that come along with 
Mudbox to create a rock texture that can be tiled in any direction without having any seams. 
This technique is very useful for games because it allows you to cover a lot of space with 
texture and not have to create unique details over a large area. You can save a lot of time by 
using this technique when creating an environment.

Fine Tooth Comb
100
Getting ready
First, we need to set up our tiling plane. To do this you'll need to go to Create | Tiling Plane. 
This option will bring to a window an output that looks like the following screenshot:
The settings in the previous screenshot are the ones we will use for this recipe. The following 
is an explanation of the options for your tiling plane:
f
f
The Plane Properties section tells Mudbox the number of polygons you would like 
each plane to consist of. It also tells Mudbox what orientation to take within the 
scene, meaning which direction it is facing.
f
f
The Repeating Tiles section defines how many tiles will be placed that have the 
details repeated. For example, with the Horizontal width and Vertical height set to 3, 
it means that the details you sculpt will be shown nine times in a 3 x 3 square.
f
f
The checkbox labeled Create Target for Extraction is so that you can export the 
results to a texture map that you can use for game assets.

Chapter 4
101
How to do it...
Once you have created your tiling plane, you can begin to sculpt your rock wall. Choose the 
Sculpt tool from your Sculpt Tools tray and then choose a stamp from the Stamp toolbar in 
the bottom right-hand corner of the Mudbox interface. The following screenshot is an image  
of the stamp that I will be using for this recipe:
You will notice that I have the Randomize checkbox turned on with each of the sliders maxed 
out. This will vary the stamp on every stroke. This makes the stamp more effective at hiding 
repetition. If you'd like, you can use one of the other default stamps that come with Mudbox or 
even a customized one that you have made yourself. After just a few strokes, you will have a 
very basic rock wall texture. You will notice that whenever you complete a stroke, the plane will 
update all the tiles with the details you have added. Since the details are repeated on a 3 x 3 
grid, you may want to target your sculpting toward the center tile for more accurate detailing. 
The following screenshot is an example of what you may come up with using the stamp  
shown previously:

102
If you are just making pretty pictures in Mudbox then you can stop here. But, if you would like 
to extract texture maps from this sculpt to be used in a game engine, then you will need a 
normal map. 
To extract a normal map, perform the following steps:
1.	 Go to Maps | Extract Texture Maps | New Operation in the main menu.
2.	 Next, input a name for the extraction. This is so that you can easily come back to this 
window with the settings you choose. This is helpful when you need to go back and 
extract a map from another object with the same settings or if you need to tweak the 
settings of an extraction you have already made.
3.	 To set up the extraction settings for a normal map you will need to check the box next 
to Normal Map. The following screenshot will show you the settings you will use for 
this extraction:

Chapter 4
103
4.	 An important thing to note is that, for tiling planes, your target model is going to 
be the Extraction Target that was created when you first made the tiling plane. 
Normally, you would just choose a lower level of your model that you would like  
to use as your game resolution model.
5.	 The source model will be the highest level of your sculpt so that you are capturing all 
the details that you put in.
6.	 You can adjust Image Size to whatever you would like your final normal map to be.
7.	
Make sure to choose 3D Studio Max from the Compatibility drop-down if you are 
using 3D Studio Max to view your normal maps.
8.	 Next give your image a Base File Name by clicking on the … next to the designated 
textbox. This is how you will choose the file type and location that the normal map will 
be extracted to.
9.	 Now, hit the Extract button at the bottom and wait a moment for the extraction to 
occur. The following screenshot is an image of what the normal map looks like for  
the wall shown previously:

Tricks for painting with stencils
This recipe will show you a few tricks you can use while painting with stencils.

Fine Tooth Comb
104
Getting ready
To get ready, you will just need to select a stencil that you would like to use and make sure  
it is enabled.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you perform an unobstructed tiling texture painting:
1.	 One trick you can use to paint with a tiling texture without the stencil obstructing your 
view is to resize your stencil to the desired size and move it off to the side.
2.	 Then select the Use Tiles checkbox.
3.	 Next, deselect the Show Tiles checkbox. This will allow you to paint a texture onto 
your model without anything obstructing your view.
Using a stencil to define proportions
For this trick, we will use a stencil to define the proportions on a relief sculpt. Other 
techniques that will be used in this project, but are not thoroughly examined, are the Freeze 
brush, Sculpt brush, importing multiple meshes, duplicating objects within Mudbox 2013, 
capturing a screen image, among others. If you would like more help with these techniques, 
you can read more in the recipes that cover these techniques.

Chapter 4
105
First off, I would like to give credit to Chidi Okoye. He is the artist whose work, Lolo Mask, I am 
using as a direct reference for my sculpt, shown in the following image:
1.	 To implement this technique, you will first bring your reference or concept into 
Photoshop and draw lines for the main shapes in the image using white on black. 
Save this image as a .png. This line drawing will be used as a guide for keeping your 
proportions on target. The following is an example from this project:
2.	 Next, you will need a plane to sculpt onto. Go ahead and create a plane in Mudbox by 
clicking Ctrl + N (New Scene) and choose the Plane from the Starting points section 
of the Welcome window.
3.	 Now hit Shift + D until you get to level 6. This should give you enough detail to sculpt 
in the details we will be adding.
4.	 The next step is to get a good angle to sculpt from. Click on Top on the view cube 
inside the Mudbox 3D View. This will aim the camera directly down onto your plane.

Fine Tooth Comb
106
5.	 Now you'll add the stencil we created in step 1. Go to the Stencil toolbar in the 
bottom right-hand side of the Mudbox 2013 interface, click on the arrow, and choose 
Add Stencil. Now, navigate to the .png that you just saved to enable this stencil.
6.	 To save the position of the camera and the position of the stencil you can go to the 
Camera Bookmarks toolbar at the bottom-right of the interface, click on the arrow, 
and choose Add Camera Bookmark. This will add a bookmark to this shelf that will 
bring you back to the same camera angle and will activate, plus reposition, your 
stencil to its current state.
7.	
Now you can use the stencil in two ways. One way is to turn it on and off, from  
the bookmarked camera angle, to make sure that your details are lining up. The 
second way is to sculpt onto a new layer of the plane and use this layer as a guide.  
To do this you will need to add a new sculpt layer and use the Sculpt tool to scribble 
over your stencil while this new layer is active. Your plane should look like the 
following screenshot:
8.	 Now you can turn this layer on and off as you need it. Go ahead and rename this layer 
as Guide. For the real sculpting, you will be using new layers, not the guide layer.

Chapter 4
107
9.	 With your guide in place, you can now use the Freeze brush to start blocking out the 
main shapes of your sculpt. The following screenshot is what you should see after the 
first shape is blocked out:
10.	 Now fill in the smaller areas, with the Freeze brush, where the sculpt will not be 
pulled forward. The following screenshot is an example of the first frozen blocked  
out shape:

Fine Tooth Comb
108
11.	 Now select the Sculpt brush and set up the properties as seen in the  
following screenshot:
12.	Next, sculpt over the blocked out areas without lifting your finger or pen. This will 
make sure that the sculpt height will plateau at the strength you have given your 
brush and will remain consistent across the entire shape. Your sculpt should look  
like the following screenshot:

Chapter 4
109
13.	Your next step is to create the raised gear shapes on the surface you just sculpted. 
Using the stencil as a guide, or the guide layer, begin blocking out the gear shapes. 
When you are done, you should have a frozen sculpt that looks like the following 
screenshot. Keep in mind that it is not necessary to block out the earrings.  
The area that the head will cover can be sculpted on and it will not hurt anything.

Fine Tooth Comb
110
14.	 Now, using the Sculpt brush with a falloff set to something similar depicted in the 
following screenshot, you will use the size of the brush to define the rise and fall of 
this detail on the model:
15.	When you complete this you should have a sculpt that looks like the following 
screenshot. Keep in mind you may need to use the Smooth or Flatten brushes  
to help smooth out this detail.
16.	 For the head, import the Mudbox default Basic Head.mud file. This mesh can be 
located (for 64-bit Windows) at C:\Autodesk\Mudbox_2013_EFGJ_Win_64-bit\
x64\Mudbox\Program Files\Autodesk\Mudbox2013\Meshes. Just go to File 
| Import, browse to this location, and click on Import.
17.	 Now, using the Translate, Rotate, and Scale tools, get the head in place using  
your stencil as a guide. Once it is in place, you may need to use the Grab brush  
to line up some of the features better. Also, don't forget to add subdivision levels  
to your head before sculpting. The lined up head mesh should look something  
like the following screenshot:

Chapter 4
111
18.	For the head sculpting, I am not going to go through all the steps but what I will tell 
you is that I used Mudbox primitives, duplication options, the Sculpt brush, the Grab 
brush, the Smooth and Flatten brushes, a little bit of Maya Import/Export (for the 
necklace) and a few of the basic Mudbox stamps (for the hair). The following is an 
image with progress shots, till the completion of the first pass on this sculpt:
19.	Next we can turn this sculpt into a normal map that can be used in games. First, you 
need to turn on the normal map viewport filter by going to the Viewport Filters tab on 
the far right and clicking on the dot next to Normal Map.
20.	Make sure that you are in your top view and then go up to Render | Save Screen 
Image and save an image that is 4x the screen size.
21.	 Open up your new large normal map image in Photoshop, select the Crop tool, hold 
Shift and then click on + , drag over your sculpt details and press Enter when it is 
centered. This will make sure that the aspect ratio of your image is squared.

Fine Tooth Comb
112
22.	Now reduce your image size by going to Image | Image Size... and set it to 2048 
pixels wide by 2048 pixels high. Now save the file. For games, your textures need to 
be powers of two. By saving this image with the dimension 2048 pixels wide by 2048 
pixels high, it means you can always reduce the size to 1024 pixels wide by 1024 
pixels high, 512 pixels wide by 512 pixels high, 256 pixels wide by 256 pixels high, 
and so on, if you would like to at a later date. It is usually better to keep as much 
resolution as possible for flexibility in the future. The following screenshot is what  
your normal map should look like:
Tricks for painting with stamps
This recipe will show you a few tricks you can use while painting with stamps.
Getting ready
To get ready you will just need to select a stamp that you would like to use and make  
sure it is enabled.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you obtain straight lines on curved surfaces (paint mode):
1.	 One trick you can do to get straight lines on a curved surface, such as the stitching  
or lettering on cloth, is to select Flatten to UV Space in the Mesh menu. Keep in 
mind this will only work when using paint tools. Any sculpting you do while the mesh 
is Flattened to UV Space will go away when you Unflatten from UV Space.

Chapter 4
113
2.	 Next you will select your desired stamp and set the spacing to what suits  
your purpose.

Fine Tooth Comb
114
3.	 Also, you will want to make sure your UVs are laid out in such a way that any line work 
is not on a diagonal. This will cause aliasing issues meaning your straight line will 
look jagged as shown in the following screenshot:
4.	 Then you can enable Steady Stroke, found in your brush's properties.  
The following screenshot is what you should see in the brush's properties:
5.	 Alternatively, you can use Curves to make sure that your line is straight. You can read 
about Curves in Creating a zipper using a custom stamp recipe. The green line in the 
following screenshot is a curve and can be used in the same way as a straight edge 
would be used outside the digital medium:
6.	 Now switch to the front camera view by going into the Object List and right-clicking 
on the Front camera and choose Look Through.

Chapter 4
115
7.	
With everything set up you can now paint straight lines onto your object, no matter 
what the 3D form looks like. The following screenshot illustrates the same:
Adding a stencil or stamp to your toolbox
This recipe will show you how to add a stencil or stamp to your toolbox. Knowing how to add 
stamps and stencils to your toolbox is an essential skill that you will use time and again.
Once you go through this recipe, I recommend creating a few brushes that you can add to your 
toolbox so that you can start experiencing what makes a good stamp or stencil.

Fine Tooth Comb
116
The default stamps and stencils can be very handy as well. Try them out and see what kind  
of effects you can produce.
How to do it...
Adding a stencil to your toolbox is very simple. The following steps will help you to add a stencil 
to your toolbox:
1.	 First you will need to go into the Stencil tool tab in the lower right-hand corner  
of your workspace.
2.	 Now, click on the menu for this tab and choose Add Stencil.
3.	 Browse to the image that you plan on using as a stencil and select it. You should now 
see the image in your tool tray.
4.	 Adding a stamp can be done in the very same fashion. First, what you will need to  
do is go into the Stamp tool tab in the lower right-hand corner of your workspace.
5.	 Now, click on the menu for this tab and choose Add Stamp.
6.	 Now browse to the image that you plan on using as a stamp and select it.  
You should now see the image in your tool tray.

Creating a custom rock stamp
This recipe will show you how to create your own stamp using an image editing software.
Getting ready
In order to create your own custom stamp, you will need to find or create an image that suits 
the type of stamp you would like to create. For example, if you would like to sculpt claw scratch 
marks, you might use four or five lines to drag along the surface. On the other hand, if you 
would like to sculpt in the texture of a rock you would need a good image of a rock with the 
details you would like to come through.
How to do it...
The following steps show how to make a stamp meant for sculpting a rock texture:
1.	 First, find a good starting image like the one in the following image farthest  
to the left:
2.	 Next you will want to desaturate the image, (Ctrl + Shift + U in Photoshop).
3.	 Now you are going to adjust the levels (Ctrl + L in Photoshop) to something like you 
see in the following screenshot. Your image should now look like the image in the 
center from the previous image.

Fine Tooth Comb
118
4.	 Next you will create an alpha channel to define the shape of the brush. To create an 
alpha channel in Photoshop, you can go to the channel's window and create a new 
layer. This should give you a layer that can be called Alpha 1 and should be all black.
5.	 Next you will draw a white dot on the alpha layer with soft edges to designate what 
parts of the image will be active.
6.	 Now just save it out as a 32-bit TGA file and you can go into Mudbox and choose  
Add Stamp in the Stamp toolbar.
How it works...
One thing you should know about stamps is that when you are in the Sculpt mode, any part 
of the image that is white is an active part of the brush. All the black areas will not affect 
your model. Essentially, when sculpting with stamps, it is using the values of your stamp to 
determine what detail is applied.
While in the Paint mode, hue, saturation, and value is taken into account. Also, black areas 
will still be applied to your model. In order to define the shape of your stamp while in the Paint 
mode you will need an alpha channel for your image.

This chapter will be covering the various ways to import and export your models as well as 
handling the UVs within Mudbox 2013. Understanding model pipeline in Mudbox 2013 will 
help you to better integrate it into your normal workflow with more efficiency. There are several 
methods of working with models from other software and, once in Mudbox, utilizing the 
models and UV organization will help strengthen your experience.
Flattening to UV space
This recipe will show you how to flatten your model in UV space. This can come in handy 
while trying to paint details that are laid out in a straight line in the UV space but are curved 
surfaces in 3D space.
Getting ready
Once you have laid out your UVs in your preferred 3D software and have imported your 3D 
model, you will be able to flatten your model to UV space.

Keep in mind that sculpting in this mode will not affect the model. This option is mostly used 
to help you in painting textures onto the surface of your model. 
How to do it...
In order to flatten your model to UV space, just go to Mesh in the top menu bar and select 
Flatten to UV Space as shown in the following screenshot:
On the left in the following screenshot is the 3D model and to the right, the screenshot shows 
how this model looks, flattened to UV space:

You can use this tool to help you add stripes or apply text to round surfaces. To demonstrate 
this, we will apply paint to the side of a missile. This recipe will add text using a stencil but you 
can also add stripes using curves as a guide. You can refer to Chapter 4,  Fine Tooth Comb, in 
a recipe called Tricks for painting with stamps if you would like to learn how to use curves to 
apply straight lines to your mesh.
If you look into the code files of this book you will find a file called missile.fbx.  
Go ahead and import this file into Mudbox 2013 and then perform the following steps:
1.	 If you try to create a straight line around a cylindrical object without using the method 
described here, then it will take more steps to complete and it leaves room for some 
unnecessary frustrations to present themselves. 
So, let's start by creating a paint layer on our missile by going to the Paint section 
under the Layers tab in the upper-right corner of the Mudbox 2013 interface,  
right-clicking in the empty space below Name, and choosing New Layer. You can 
leave the defaults for the window that pops up and hit the OK button.
2.	 Go ahead and apply a base color by using the Paint Tools found in the bottom 
left-hand side of the Mudbox interface. I used a bluish-white color but you can use 
whatever color you'd like.
3.	 Now click on Mesh | Flatten to UV Space from the top menu.
4.	 Next we're going to get the camera to look straight at our flattened mesh. To do 
this you can right-click on the empty space in your viewport, hover your mouse over 
Switch Views, and choose Front View.
5.	 Now hit the A key to focus on the flattened mesh and zoom in until you are looking at 
the large bar on top of the UV layout.
The UVs are sloppy on the rest of the UV shells because this top shell is the only 
piece needed to demonstrate this technique. The following screenshot is what you 
should be looking at:

Get In and Get Out
124
6.	 The next thing we need to do is select the Projection tool from the Paint Tools menu, 
on the bottom left-hand side of the Mudbox interface.
7.	
Now we have to choose a stencil to use with our projection brush. Click on the Image 
Browser tab at the top of the viewport and then navigate to the folder containing the 
assets for this chapter.
8.	 Now choose the Air Force Logo.png image and click on the icon for Set Stencil. 
The image should look like the following screenshot:
9.	 Next, you can go back to the 3D View tab and line up your stencil. By holding the S 
key your navigation tools will control your stencil. Resize and position your stencil until 
it matches the location shown in the following screenshot:
10.	 The last two steps are to go to the top menu and select Mesh | Unflatten from UV 
Space and then right-click on the empty space of the viewport and go to Switch View 
| Perspective to get back to the initial camera. You should see something like the 
following screenshot: 
Depending on the curvature of your mesh, using this technique will save you from having 
distortion on your projections.

This recipe will show you how to delete the highest level of resolution on your model.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to delete the highest level of resolution on your model:
1.	 Once you have a multiple-level mesh within Mudbox 2013, you will want to switch to 
the level that you would want as the highest level.
2.	 Now go to Mesh and choose Delete Highest Level.
3.	 Repeat the previous step until it does not let you delete anymore. It will not let you

The Mesh menu also provides other functionalities based on subdivision levels, one of them 
being rebuilding subdivision levels.
Rebuilding subdivision levels on an imported mesh
If you need to rebuild the subdivision levels on an imported mesh, you can go to Mesh in the 
top menu bar and go to Rebuild Subdivision Levels.
Rebuilding the subdivision levels is essentially un-subdividing a model so that you can work  
on the lower levels of the model while preserving the detail on the higher levels.
Keep in mind this will only work on models that have been subdivided using the  
Catmull-Clark method. Maya and ZBrush are just a few software that use this method  
to subdivide their models.

Blocking out a rough Mayan pyramid using a 
displacement map
This recipe will show you how to create a quick block out of a Mayan pyramid in Mudbox 2013. 
By learning this method, you will be able to get early shapes blocked in fairly quickly without 
ever touching a brush. When you complete this recipe, you will have a rough shape of a Mayan 
pyramid that you can use as a base for a sculpt or for creating a paintover.
Getting ready
First you will need a displacement map created in Photoshop or another software, such as 
Gimp or Corel Painter. The following points will help you to start off:

f
In your preferred 2D image editing software, lay down a series of squares within the 
squares. Make sure that each square has an equal change in value as well as an 
equal change in size. In this case, I have changed the value and size of each box by 
20 percent. The following screenshot shows what the image should look like:

How to do it...
The following steps will help you to block out a rough Mayan pyramid using a displacement map: 
1.	 To apply this displacement map to your surface in Mudbox, you will go to Maps and 
under Sculpt using Map you will choose New Operation....
2.	 A window will pop up with the attributes you will need to set. First, choose the mesh 
you are trying to affect by going to the Target Mesh drop-down menu and choosing 
your mesh. The screenshot following step 6 shows an example of the menu.
3.	 Next you will choose the displacement map you plan on using on the mesh by 
choosing the … next to Map.
4.	 For your typical black and white displacement map, leave the Map Space setting on 
Normal (regular displacement map).
5.	 Under the Advanced section we're going to set the Multiplier to 80 for some  
more depth.
6.	 When all is set, choose Go and Mudbox will create a sculpt layer for you with the details 
from the displacement map. If you repeatedly press Go you will get more layers and 
the details will stack in intensity. I recommend adjusting Multiplier if you do not get the 
result you want the first time. The following screenshot shows the result:

Try adding some more details to your displacement map before using the Sculpt using Map 
tool. By using a combination of the Gradient brush and Posterize within Photoshop, I added 
some details to the displacement map and came up with something that looks like the 
following screenshot:
It may be hard to figure it out in this screenshot but the gradient is stepped to create a rough 
blockout for the pyramid's stairs. The following screenshot shows what the Sculpt using Map 
tool produced:

Share your base mesh
Whenever you create a new base mesh you should consider sharing it with the community. 
Doing this takes very little time and will help the community to grow and become a greater 
resource for you and other artists like you. 
1.	 First thing you're going to need is a .obj file of the mesh you would like to share.  
To obtain this you will need to select the object you want to share from the Object 
List window in Mudbox.
2.	 Then click on File | Export Selection... and save your file to your computer  
as a .obj file.
3.	 When you upload your base mesh, the Mudbox Community website will ask for a 
.zip file. So, the next step is to create a ZIP file using a program such as WinZip 
available at http://www.winzip.com/downwz.htm or PeaZip available at 
http://www.peazip.org/.
4.	 The other thing the Mudbox Community site will ask for is a thumbnail for your object. 
For this you can take a screenshot of your object and save it as a low resolution 
.jpeg file.
5.	 Now that you have your thumbnail and your base mesh zipped up and ready to go, 
you're going to click on the Mudbox Community tab at the top of your viewport. 
Alternatively, you can go to http://area.autodesk.com/mudcom to reach the 
same page.
6.	 Next, you will login to the Mudbox Community. If you do not have an account yet, you 
can click on the register link found at the top of the page. Just follow the instructions 
and enter your information. Don't worry, it is free to sign up. 
7.	
The next step, after signing in, is to click on Upload on the far, left-hand side  
of the website which should open up a drop-down of choices. You are going to  
click on Upload Base Mesh, at the bottom of this list. The menu should look  
like the following screenshot:

Chapter 5
131
8.	 Once you click on Upload Base Mesh you should see a window that looks like the 
following screenshot:
Now you are going to click on the buttons that say Choose File and choose the files 
you created in the previous steps. Follow the onscreen instructions and you will have 
your base mesh uploaded in no time.

Importing, exporting, and working with 
multiple objects within Mudbox 2013
This recipe will show you how to bring an object into Mudbox 2013 with textures applied so 
that you can add details to an existing asset. We will also go over how to work with multiple 
objects within Mudbox and then export the objects for use with another software.
Getting ready
For this recipe, we will be importing a textured casino die and then we will duplicate it and add 
some dirt to the dice. If you would like to follow along with the same die that I will be using in 
this recipe, you can find the dice.mud file and the dice-files folder available in the code files 
of this book.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to import, export, and work with an object within Mudbox:  
1.	 First thing we are going to do is open up the dice.mud file with Mudbox 2013. In 
your viewport, you should see something that looks like the following screenshot:
2.	 Next , you will go to File | Import... and select the same dice.mud file that you  
just opened.
3.	 You may notice that the die got brighter. That's because we imported a duplicate 
light along with our die. To delete the extra light, you can go into the Object List in 
the upper-right side of the Mudbox interface, and right-click on Light01 and click on 
Delete Light.
4.	 You may also notice that there seems to be only one die in the viewport. This is 
because the two dice are sitting right on top of each other. In order to move one  
of the dice we will need to select which die we would like to move. Go into the  
Object List in the upper-right side of the Mudbox interface and select either  
pCube3 or pCube4.

Chapter 5
133
5.	 Now, go into the Select/Move Tools menu, in the bottom-left side of the Mudbox 
2013 interface, and select the Translate tool.
6.	 You should be able to see a gizmo with an arrow for each axis. Grab the blue arrow (Z 
axis) and drag the die next to its partner.
7.	
Next we're going to rotate the die using the Rotate tool under the Select/Move 
Tools menu. Instead of using the gizmo to rotate the dice, we will go to the Rotate 
Properties, on the right-hand side of the Mudbox interface, and manually type in our 
rotation. The properties for the rotate tool should look like the following screenshot:
The three values next to Rotate stand for the degrees in X, the degrees in Y, and the 
degrees in Z in that order.  So, to change which side of the die is facing you,  you can 
type in any multiples of 90 for the X, Y, or Z values.
8.	 Now that the dice are showing different sides of each other we can use the rotation 
gizmo to give each die more of a natural rotation. How often do dice land exactly lined 
with each other? Actually often, considering their shape and how frequently the dice 
get rolled. But, it will still feel a little more real if your 3D objects are not lining up on 
a grid.
After rotating and translating your dice into a position, you should be viewing 
something that looks like the following screenshot:

Get In and Get Out
134
9.	 Next, you can paint some dirt on the dice. Take a look at Chapter 4,  Fine Tooth Comb 
for a handful of good painting techniques if you need help laying down some dirt. 
10.	 Now, that your dirt has been added you'll need to select the dice for exporting. To do 
this you will go back into the Object List and first select one die and then Ctrl + click 
the other die. Both of your dice should be showing up yellow in the viewport,  
as shown in the following screenshot:
11.	 The last step is to go to File | Export Selection and save your file in a .fbx format. 
This will ensure that the textures will be exported along with the model. The following 
screenshot from Maya shows the dice after importing the .fbx file that was saved  
in Mudbox:
Once you go through the process once or twice, you'll start to realize how easy it is to go from 
one piece of software to the next. Take note that you can duplicate your object, instead of 
reimporting the object, if you do not need to bring a new object into the scene. If you would 
like to duplicate your object all you need to do is right-click on the object in your viewport and 
choose Duplicate Object from the right-click menu.
Creating a terrain
This recipe will cover how to quickly create a large area of terrain using displacement maps. 

Chapter 5
135
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to successfully create a terrain:
1.	 The first thing you will need to do is create an appropriate displacement map using 
Photoshop or another software package. I created this displacement map using Filter 
| Render | Clouds in Photoshop and multiplied a Filter | Sketch | Stamp version 
of the clouds render on top of it for the higher raised areas. This is shown in the 
following screenshot:
2.	 Once you have a displacement map you are happy with, you can go into the top  
menu of Mudbox and explore the Maps drop-down menu. Here you will mouse over 
Sculpt Model Using Displacement Map and find New Operation…. Click on this for 
further options.
3.	 Now you will see this menu, where you will choose a Target Mesh for the 
displacement map to be applied to, as shown in the following screenshot: 

Get In and Get Out
136
4.	 The next option is where you will set your displacement map file by clicking  
on the … button and browsing to your displacement map file.
5.	 Displacement Map Space can be left set as Normal and now all you need to do is 
click on Go to execute the operation.
6.	 Now a new sculpt layer will be created on your object so that you may adjust the 
intensity of your newly displaced mesh. This is shown in the following screenshot:
7.	
The following screenshot shows the sculpt that this displacement map produced:

Introduction
This chapter will cover various ways to customize materials within Mudbox 2013. It will go 
over the basics of creating a material in Mudbox as well as creating some more advanced 
materials using the reflection and specular channels. With the knowledge gained from this 
chapter you will be able to create believable materials to bring more realism into your sculpts.
Creating a Blinn material
This recipe will show you how to create a new material. This allows the personalization of the 
visual look that a model will attain by interacting with lights and texture maps.

Shine On
140
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to create a new Blinn material:
1.	 To create a material for your model, click on Create in the top menu bar, hover over 
Materials and select Simple Blinn Material.
2.	 The options such as Diffuse, Specular, Ambient, and Shininess will appear in a 
prompt after your selection. Additionally, Object List will display your new material  
as Material. You can rename your material by right-clicking the material in the  
Object List.
You can utilize these options to change how your object reacts to light. The following 
screenshot shows the different options:


The Diffuse color is the reflected light that bounces in all directions off the 
surface of your object. This is the color that we would define objects with.


The Specular color is what you might call a highlight. These are rays of light 
that bounce off the surface in only one direction. This is an attribute that is 
most apparent in shiny objects.

Chapter 6
141


The Ambient color is the color of the shadow areas in your model. The colors 
that usually make up this area come from bounced light. Ambient light does 
not come from a direct light source.


The Shininess slider refers to the size of the specular highlight on  
your object.

The Using a simple Blinn material recipe
Using a simple Blinn material
This recipe will show you how to customize the simple Blinn material to achieve different looks.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to customize the simple Blinn material:
1.	 Once you have a simple Blinn material created, you will want to apply it to your model 
by right-clicking on your model, selecting Assign Existing Material, and then clicking 
on Material.
2.	 Under the Properties tab you will see the color options for Diffuse, Specular, 
Ambient, and Shininess.

Shine On
142


Diffuse: This specifies the base color of the material which in essence is a 
combination of the colors that bounce in all directions off the surface of an 
object. The colors that are absorbed by the object are not seen by the  
human eye.


Specular: This specifies the color of the specular highlight on the material.
Non-metallic objects, such as skin, should be given a hue that is the opposite 
of the diffuse color so that the highlight will show white. The reason for doing 
this is because, in RGB, grays and whites have all colors in them and when 
you add these to your diffuse color, you will get a slightly metallic look. By 
using the inverse color you will neutralize the diffuse color so your highlight 
will stay white.
Metallic objects, such as gold, will include some of the bounced light from 
the diffuse color. For this reason you will want your specular colors to be 
similar to those of your diffuse colors. You can adjust this slightly for different 
types of metals but for the most part you will want a similar hue.


Ambient: This specifies the color of light that comes from the environment 
around an object and is usually known as the shadow area of your material.
Ambient light can be described as any light rays that have bounced off 
from multiple surfaces. For example, light that has reflected off from the 
atmosphere, or sky, may provide a blue color when it hits the shadowy area 
of a tree. These light rays will have reflected off from the moisture in the air 
and then off the bark of the tree before it meets your eyes.


Shininess: This specifies the size of the specular highlight. The higher  
the value, the more acute the highlight. The lower the value, the wider  
the highlight.
This attribute determines how flat a surface is compared to the light rays' 
wavelength. The more flat a surface is, the more specular will show while 
the more rough a surface is on a light wave scale, the more the specular will 
scatter and become a part of the diffuse color. This option allows the artist 
to fine-tune the falloff of a highlight for more accurate representations of 
different materials.
3.	 Choosing the correct colors for the bounced light coming off your model is essential 
to make your sculpts believable. Begin with choosing the diffuse color of your object.
4.	 Next, adjust the specular using the guidelines previously mentioned. When using 
images in your specular channel, you are able to add things, such as smudges and 
dirt by paint in different values and colors for different locations on your model.

Chapter 6
143
5.	 The next thing you will want to adjust is the ambient light. If your model is set outside 
on a sunny day you may want to add a little bit of blue to the ambient color. This will 
represent the bounced light from the blue sky. If it is dusk or dawn, you may want to 
add a pink, orange, red, or purple tint for the bounced light.
6.	 Finally, the shininess can be adjusted for a more intense light source or just a larger 
light source that is creating larger highlights.

Using Lit Sphere to mimic other materials
This recipe will show you how Lit Sphere materials can mimic materials from other 3D 
programs. Using this material you will be able to use materials from other software by 
rendering out a sphere and applying it to a Lit Sphere material in Mudbox. This material  
uses the shading information, within the rendered sphere, to determine the shading of  
the Lit Sphere material.

Shine On
144
Getting ready
The following steps will help you get ready to be able to use Lit Sphere materials:
1.	 First you will need to render a sphere with the material of your choice from another 
3D program as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Next, you should extend the color on the edges of the sphere out to the edges of the 
texture and save it. I've added some color to the light sources of this texture so that 
you can easily see what is going on.
3.	 Now that the texture is created, we can start building our material.

Chapter 6
145
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to mimic other materials using Lit Sphere:
1.	 Right-click on your model, select Assign New Material, and click on Lit  
Sphere Material.
2.	 Now you will browse for the texture through the Lit Sphere attribute.
3.	 Now that your material is ready you can throw it onto one of your models or one  
of Mudbox's default models. In this case, I used Mudbox's default torso.
If you look closely you will notice how the lighting corresponds with the location of the 
colors within the texture.
4.	 This material allows your object to react to the perceived lighting information offered 
by the Lit Sphere image.

your model.
How to do it...
1.	 First apply a new material by right-clicking on the object and assigning  
a new material.
2.	 Then, click on the Paint button under the Layers tab and right-click to select New 
Layer. The Create New Paint Layer options will offer options to customize the name, 
size, format, and texture channel of the new layer. Select the Diffuse channel to  
start with, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 7
155
3.	 Click on the Paint Tools tab, on the bottom left side of the interface, and select the 
Projection brush.
4.	 On the bottom right, go to the Stencil tab and click on the small arrow. Now go to Add 
Stencil (as shown in the following screenshot) and choose your rock texture.
If you do not want to create your own rock texture painted or photo sourced, 
then you can always grab one online. One place I sometimes go for textures 
is www.cgtextures.com. They have a wide variety of textures, both 
tileable and non-tileable. They also offer very high resolution textures for 
members.
5.	 The stencil will now be added to the list of thumbnails in the Stencil tab.
6.	 Once you choose the thumbnail of your stencil you will see a semitransparent overlay 
of your stencil in the viewport. 

Time to Paint

7.	
If you have a tiling image, you can turn on Use Tiles, found in the stencil's properties. 
The following screenshot shows the checkbox for Use Tiles and Show Tiles 
(mentioned in the next step):
8.	 You can also turn on Show Tiles if you want to make the tiled images visible. Once 
this option is checked off your stencil should look like the following screenshot:
9.	 Once you have painted your rock using the stencil, you can set your viewport to Flat 
Lighting, to better see any stretching or seams that need to be painted over. This can 
easily be found in the right-click menu, or you can use the hotkeys, Shift + L. This will 
help you to see the diffuse texture without any highlights or shadows getting in your 
way. In the following screenshot you can see the flat lit version on the right and the 
default lighting (with specular turned down) on the left:

Chapter 7
157
10.	 Now you can use other stencils or brushes to add any extra details to your rock. 
How it works...
The Projection brush allows you to place a texture where you would like it, before actually 
applying it. This can be very helpful in adding details to your model.
Traditionally, you would have to paint your details in Photoshop, save your file, then go into 
your 3D software and see how the updated texture looks on your model. Sometimes it would 
take some tweaking to get the placement of the details correct. With this new method, you 
can add complex detail with one stroke, while eliminating the need to switch back and forth 
between your 2D and 3D software.
The following is a list of controls used for placing your stencil:

The Painting out seams on a rock using the Clone brush recipe
Painting out seams on a rock using the 
Clone brush
This recipe will show you how to paint out seams using the Clone brush. The Clone brush is 
a very powerful tool that can copy details from one part of the texture to another part in one 
stroke. This makes it very useful for getting rid of hard edges where your UV shells end.

Getting ready
If your imported model's texture has seams, this will show you how to easily rid yourself  
of them.
How to do it...
1.	 Select the Clone brush under the Paint Tools tab at the bottom left.
2.	 Now, Ctrl + left-click on your model to select the area your brush will clone from,  
as shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 After selecting the area to clone from, start stroking the brush along the seam in 
your viewport and watch as the seam is easily reduced. The following is a screenshot 
showing the rock after the Clone brush was used to eliminate most of the green area:

Painting a rock Specular map
This recipe will show you how to paint a rock Specular map onto your model. The Specular 
map plays a large part in how an object reacts to light, by controlling the highlights that are 
revealed when light hits the object. The type of object you are creating will guide you in how 
to handle the Specular map. For example, if you are creating a dielectric material (such as 
plastic, clay, and other nonelectric conductors), then your highlights will be a neutral value, 
lacking color. If you are creating a conductive material (such as bronze or other metals),  
then the specular highlight will be altered by the material.
Getting ready
We will start by importing the Rock.obj file present in the code files of this book.
If you are using a model of your own, then you need to make sure that your object is UV 
mapped, so that what you paint is not stretched or inconsistent with its resolution.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Paint button under the Layers tab, and right-click to select New Layer. 
The Create New Paint Layer option will offer options to customize. Next to Channel, 
choose Specular.

Time to Paint
160
2.	 Click on the Paint Tools tab and select Projection at the bottom left of the screen.  
On the bottom right, click on the Stencil tab and import an image of your choice  
to project over the model. We will be using the next screenshot for this recipe.  
This stencil is one of the default stencils that come with Mudbox.
3.	 Make sure to paint over the model to see the projection work. This will cause different 
highlight values to appear on your model to further bring out the desired effect.
There's more...
The technique we just discussed is the most straightforward way to add specular with an 
image. Another helpful technique is to use the diffuse map that you have already created  
as a starting point for your Specular map. The following are the steps you will need to follow 
for this technique:
1.	 Make a duplicate of your diffuse texture in the Layers tab. The following screenshot is 
what you should see:

Chapter 7
161
2.	 Now you can rename this layer as rock_spec so that it is easier to identify.  
Just double-click on the name of the layer and it should allow you to rename it.
3.	 The next step is the real trick. What we are going to do now is change the hue of this 
texture to its opposite hue, and then apply it as a specular layer. What this is going to 
do is neutralize the light as it hits the diffuse texture as well as keep the variations of 
value that you have established in your diffuse channel.
4.	 To adjust the hue of the copied layer, you can right-click on the copied layer and 
choose Adjust Color from the menu that pops up.
5.	 Now, you will adjust a few settings in the Adjust Color menu. First, choose the preset 
called More Contrast from the Presets drop-down menu. This will add some more 
variation to our specular highlights. Next, slide the Hue bar all the way to the right, or 
the left, so that the highlights will be neutralized. The diffuse color and the specular 
color will cancel each other out and produce a white highlight. Lastly, you will bring 
the Value down to about -60 so our highlights are not too strong. The following 
screenshot is what you should see:
6.	 Now, you will create a new layer using the method learned earlier in this recipe. Make 
sure you set it as a specular channel. This layer can be used to add any hand-painted 
specular details after completing this technique.

Time to Paint
162
7.	
Next, you will take the layer that we adjusted the colors of, and middle-mouse drag 
the layer into the Specular group, within your layers.
8.	 Now, you should have a specular that matches up with your diffuse texture. If the 
Specular is not strong enough, try duplicating the specular layer and setting its blend 
mode to Screen. This will lighten up the details in this layer. The following screenshot 
shows where the blend mode is located:
9.	 Now you can adjust the Strength slider on the Screen layer to fine-tune the intensity. 
You can also paint into another layer if you would like to add any details to your 
specular channel, such as wet spots or any other adjustments needed, based on 
details that have been added to your rock texture. In the following screenshot you can 
see that the specular is causing details to "pop" with higher contrast as the light hits 
the surface fom certain angles:

Chapter 7
163
Painting a rock Bump map
This recipe will show you how to paint a Bump map onto your model. Bump maps can be used 
to create smaller details that don't call for a normal map. This type of map uses a black and 
white image where darker values represent surfaces that are farther away, and lighter values 
represent surfaces that are raised up, relative to the other values.
Getting ready
First off, you will want to import the Rock.obj file present in the code files of this book.  
This is the model that we will be using to demonstrate this technique. If you are planning on 
using your own model for this recipe, then make sure you have your UVs laid out nicely, or you 
may have stretching and/or resolution inconsistencies. Please note that I used the default 
Mudbox cube to create this rock, so the UVs are not the best on this model, but do the trick 
for our purposes.
How to do it...
1.	 Click on the Paint button under the Layers tab, and right-click to select New Layer. 
The Create New Paint Layer window will offer options to customize. Select the Bump 
Map channel.

Time to Paint
164
2.	 Click on the Paint Tools tab, and select Paint Brush at the bottom left of the screen. 
On the bottom right, choose Stamp or import an image of your choice to use as a 
stamp. The following Bump Map.png image is used for this recipe, which is present 
in the code files of this book:
3.	  Keep in mind that when you create a bump layer, in Mudbox, the layer is filled with 
black. This will not be obvious since there are no color indications, nor details, to 
inform you of this.
This just means that, when you begin painting on your bump layer, you will need to 
consider the value of your brush. If you want very intense contrast on the details you 
are painting, then you will be using values close to white. If you would like to paint 
subtle details as we will be doing with this rock, then you will set your brush's value  
to something a lot closer to black.
So, with that in mind, you should set your brush to dark gray and randomize your 
stamp. The following screenshot shows the settings that were used for this rock:

Chapter 7
165
4.	 The last step is to paint your rock! In the following image, I added a touch of specular 
to the material, so that you can see the details a little better. The details that you put 
into this layer will react to the light, similar to a normal map.
How it works...
Wherever you paint white it will give the appearance of a raised surface. Any area that is 
closer to black starts to recede. So if you were to start with a 50 percent gray image and then 
paint a white area and a black area, you would notice that the light is reacting as if there is 
detail there. In the following image you will see the sculpt on the left and the values painted 
on the right:
If you were to rotate the sculpt, you would notice that there is no depth in the geometry  
of the object.

Adding text to a cape using Flatten UV mode
This recipe will show you how to project an image onto a model in Flatten UV mode.
Getting ready
Once you have created or imported a UV mapped model into Mudbox (as shown in the next 
screenshot), you will be ready to project an image onto it.
How to do it...
1.	 Apply a new material by right-clicking on the cape and assigning a new material.

Chapter 7
167
2.	 Create a new Diffuse layer in Paint under the Layers tab. This will be the base texture 
for projecting the text onto your cape. 
3.	  Select Flatten to UV Space under the Mesh tab, and your model will be temporarily 
flattened to its UVs. Now, you will be able to project an image onto the cape without it 
distorting as it would in the 3D view.

Time to Paint
168
4.	 Click on the Paint Tools tab and select Projection at the bottom left of the screen. 
On the bottom right, click on the Stencil tab and import an image of your choice to 
project over the cape.
5.	 For text with transparency, consider creating an image in Photoshop and leaving the 
background empty to create an alpha.
6.	 Position the text over the part of the cape in its UV space you wish to project it over. 
Stroke the brush over the text. Your image will project over the UVs without being 
distorted by the actual shape of the cape.

Chapter 7

Select Unflatten from UV Space under the Mesh tab and your cape will be returned 
to its normal shape.
8.	 Now, you have the image or text you projected showing on the cape without distortion.

Adding dirt to a cape using a layer as a 
mask
This recipe will show you how to create a mask from an existing layer. This can be very helpful 
in using details that you have already painted, to single out details on another layer. Layer 
masks can also be painted into, in order to reveal or hide textures that you have created on 
the surface of your model.
Getting ready
Once you have created a painted layer on the cape, paint a dirt layer in the same manner.

You can use this kind of mask to reveal areas that correspond to the details painted 
on another layer. The following screenshot shows an example of the dirt masked onto

Introduction
This chapter will cover proper, useful lighting and rendering practices in Mudbox 2013. We will 
go over several techniques for lighting objects and scenes, to establish the mood and present 
your models in a clear and interesting manner. Viewport filters will be covered to enhance the 
scenes that you create and to provide other methods of creating normal maps. This chapter 
will also cover how to create a turntable for presenting your sculpts on your demo reel or 
website. You will benefit greatly by learning these tools and techniques. There are a lot of 
things you can pull of by using this knowledge on your own projects.
Creating a light
This recipe will show you how to create a light and modify its settings. Lighting is a very 
important part of presentation, whether you are working in games, movies, television, or just 
want to make something nice to look at. It is easy to spot a beginner by looking at the lighting 
of a particular object or scene.

Ready for My Closeup
174
The following is a list of a few things you should think about when setting up your lighting.
f
f
You almost never want your shadows to be pitch black. Try adding a low intensity blue 
light in your shadow areas to let some of your hard earned details show through the 
darkness. Keep in mind that the light color is situational. If you are in a cave with lava 
all around you, it might be more appropriate to boost the shadows with an orange 
light instead of blue.
f
f
Use lighting to draw the eye of the viewer. Restrict your full intensity lights to the 
areas of your model or scene that have been defined as your focal point. Other areas 
where light hits can still be lit brightly, just not as brightly.
f
f
Another trick to draw the eye is to add some texture to the light. Try breaking up 
the light with tree leaf shadows or other obstructions. If you break the light up into 
interesting shapes near your focal point, then people's eyes will surely be drawn to it. 
Just make sure it is not too distracting. It should work well with the focal point you are 
trying to present.
f
f
Pay attention to cool and warm light. Also, pay attention to the way sunlight reacts 
within an environment at different times of the day. For instance, at dusk the sun 
looks more orange. This is because the light rays have to travel through more 
atmosphere. This causes a lot of the bluer light rays to scatter throughout the air, 
which is also why the sky is blue.
Getting ready
First off, you will want to import one of your assets to add some lighting to. If you do not have an 
asset to light then you can either import a default model from Mudbox or open Rock.mud from 
the code assets of this book. Then delete the lights that are currently in the scene. No cheating!
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to create a light and modify its settings:
1.	 By default, Mudbox will already have a single directional light in your scene.  
This light should be used before inserting another light. To add more lights,  
select the Directional light under the Lights tab in the Create menu as shown  
in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
175
2.	 This will create a light in the scene. To see the light in your viewport, check the box for 
Show Light. Additionally, check the box for Show Grips if you want to rotate the light. 
This is shown in the following screenshot:
3.	 Diffuse will change the color of the light while the Intensity will increase or decrease 
its effect on the objects in your scene.
4.	 Using the rotational grip, you can change the angle of your light and how it hits  
your object.
5.	 Now, try adding a few lights, adjust these properties, and see what kind of lighting 
schemes you can come up with. Also, see how close you can match the lighting as 
shown in the following example.

Ready for My Closeup
176
The following example is using three-directional lights. One is orange, 
simulating the sun, while the other two are blue, to fill in the shadows 
with diffused light from the atmosphere.

The Lighting an indoor scene with simple light setup recipe
Creating a three-point lighting preset
This recipe will show you how to create a three-point light setup and save it as a preset. This 
setup is a standard light setup that is used by all industries. This recipe will explain the purpose 
of the three individual lights and how they work together to light your characters or assets.
Getting ready
To start, you will want to import an asset that you would like to light. Otherwise, you can use 
one of the default Mudbox meshes or open up the Rock.mud file from the code assets of this 
book. Then delete the lights that are currently in the file.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to create a three-point lighting preset:
1.	 Rotate Mudbox's main light to address the lighting of the object by an offset  
of one side, aimed downward at the object. This will be the starting point of  
your three-point lighting.

Chapter 8
177
2.	 Create a second light and rotate it to affect the other side of the object, similarly at a 
downward angle toward the object. This will illuminate the opposite side of your first 
light. Also bring the intensity down on this light. This light will fill in the shadows on 
the other side of your object or character.
3.	 Create a third light and rotate it to affect the rear of the object, opposite the camera. 
Typically this light is aimed downward at the object. This will illuminate the silhouette 
of your object and help the character or asset to pop from the background.

Ready for My Closeup
178
4.	 All three lights in the scene will offer a lighting scheme that easily helps the object  
to pop out to show off your work.
5.	 To save your current lighting in the scene, click the Lighting Presets tab on the 
bottom right-hand side of the Mudbox interface.
6.	 Now, click the arrow and then click on Add Lighting Preset. This will create a lighting 
preset from all the lights in your scene so you can use it in future projects. Once this 
is done, Mudbox will create a small thumbnail in the Lighting Presets tray showing 
the lighting scheme that you have created, as shown in the following screenshot:
Keep in mind that using a lighting preset from the Lighting Presets window will erase all lights 
previously present in your scene.
How it works...
There are a couple of things being taught in this recipe. One of them is the lighting preset 
feature which allows you to save the lighting scheme that you create, so that you can easily 
light feature assets with the same, or similar lighting setup.

Chapter 8
179
Another thing this recipe is teaching is how to set up a three-point lighting scheme. This 
lighting scheme is the most widely known lighting setup, especially when lighting characters. 
This is because it does a great job of separating the character or object from the background 
while giving a pleasing light setup void of harsh shadows. You can still have harsh shadows, 
if you would like to use that effect for the mood you are setting, by adjusting the intensity of 
your fill light. If you are wondering which light is the fill light, I have listed the roles of the three 
lights, within the three-point lighting setup, as follows:
1.	 First, there is the key light. This is the first light we went over. This is the light 
representing your main light source, for example, the sun or a candle. This light is the 
attention getter. It is typically set to an intensity between 0.75 and 1.5, though this is 
not an absolute rule. What is an absolute rule is that it remains at a higher intensity 
than the fill light.
2.	 The second light is the fill light. This light usually has an opposite angle from the 
key light and has a lower intensity than the key light, usually half the intensity. The 
purpose of this light is to fill in the shadow areas on a character's face or the shadow 
areas of your asset. Sometimes, you may require more than one fill light to boost the 
shadow areas of your model. Also, the color of this light is usually the color of the 
bounced light within your scene or it could be a secondary light source. For example, 
you may have a bright full moon being used as a key light while a distant candle is 
filling in the shadows as the fill light.
3.	 The third light is the rim light. This light's main purpose is to pop the figure or asset 
from its background. Let's say you have a character standing outside in the dark. 
You have a candle as a key light and a low intensity blue light as the fill light. Some 
of those low intensity blue shadow areas may blend in with the background. To fix 
this, we can add a high intensity light coming from the moon above that is only hitting 
the shoulders and the top of the character's head. This bright highlight will pop the 
character out from the background and give some depth and focus to our subject.
Lighting an indoor scene with a simple light 
setup
This recipe will show you how to easily light an indoor environment. We will go over some 
things you need to consider when lighting an indoor scene. With the knowledge you gain  
from this recipe, you will be able to plan your lighting for your scenes more effectively.

Ready for My Closeup
180
Getting ready
First things first. Open up the file named Interior Demo.mud.
This is a quick hallway that could easily be made modular. This means that it could be broken 
down to smaller pieces that can be reused over and over. You may notice this scene is not 
created modularly. For the sake of speed, I have combined all the elements and thrown an 
automatic map onto the hallway.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to light an indoor environment:
1.	 When you open up the file, you should see something that looks like the  
following screenshot:
This file has come already lit with viewport filters enabled. I'm going to go over the 
steps you need to go through to get to this point. So, the first thing you need to do is 
identify your light sources.
For anything that is self-lit, you will want to first paint an incandescent map for that 
object. If you are using your own interior model then you will want to make sure you 
have your UVs laid out the way you want them.
2.	 In the example, you can see that the overhead lights and the emergency lights seem 
lit up. These are the areas where an incandescent map was painted. To do this you 
can simply right-click in the empty space of your Paint layer toolbar and select New 
Layer.... The following is a screenshot of what it should look like:

Chapter 8
181
3.	 When the Create New Paint Layer window as shown in the previous screenshot pops 
up, you will need to choose Incandescence from the drop-down menu. The previous 
screenshot shows an example of what your new layer's properties should look like.
4.	 Now with your incandescence layer created, you can begin painting in your light 
sources. The color that you paint will represent the color of the light that the object 
is giving off. The following screenshot shows a few strokes of paint on one of the 
overhead lights:
5.	 After you paint in your designated light sources, you will want to start placing lights.
One thing you need to consider when lighting within Mudbox is that there is an eight-light  
limit. If you want lighting beyond what eight lights can provide, then you will need to paint  
that lighting into an incandescence layer.
So, for this example we will only be placing eight dynamic lights for the overhead lights. If you 
want lighting for the emergency lights, you will need to paint that in.
In game development, a lot of the lights are baked into light maps, meaning the lighting was 
captured into a texture map that is set as an overlay to the other texture maps in the scene. 
This allows the use of fewer dynamic lights which can eat up more resources and slow down 
the frame rate in a game. Dynamic lights are lights like the ones that are placed in this 
example. They can be moved and adjusted where a light map would be considered as static 
lighting, since you cannot move the light source without creating a new render.

Ready for My Closeup
182
Now, let's take a look at how these lights are placed. In the following screenshot you can see 
where I have laid out the dynamic lights for this scene: 
Once you have rotated your camera view, in the example file, you can always return to 
the framed shot by clicking on the camera bookmark that I have created in the Camera 
Bookmarks tab, located on the bottom right-hand side of the interface.
1.	 For this lighting setup, I used point lights that were created by going to Create | 
Lights | Point. The following is a screenshot of what the menu looks like:
2.	 Once you have the light in your scene you will need to place it. In order to see your 
light's location and to move your light, you will need to go into the light's properties 
and check the boxes for Show Grips and Show Light. The following screenshot shows 
the properties of one of the lights in this scene along with the intensities of the other 
lights in the scene, as shown in the Object List section:

Chapter 8
183
3.	 Following the previous steps, you can then create the rest of the lights in your scene. 
You will notice that the light intensities are varied. This is to show that the scene is 
not flatly lit and you can vary the lights a little to show that some of the lights have 
become slightly dimmer over the years.

The Enhancing your scene with viewport filters recipe
Enhancing your scene with viewport filters
This recipe will show you how to improve the believability of your scene using viewport filters. 
These filters allow a nice variety of post process effects to be applied within the viewport. This 
just means you can add some nice qualities to your view that are typically only seen when you 
render out the view in other software packages, which takes longer.

Ready for My Closeup
184
Getting ready
Once you have lit a scene and enabled shadows, you can apply Ambient Occlusion, Cavity 
Ambient Occlusion, Depth of Field, and Tonemapper filters to further improve the dynamics 
of your scene. For this recipe you can follow along using the Interior Demo.mud file that is 
present in the code files of this book, or you can set up your own scene.
If you are using the example that comes with the code assets of the book, then the viewport 
filters are turned on to begin with. Go ahead and turn these off before starting this recipe. 
Your scene should look like the following screenshot:
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to use viewport filters in order to enhance your scene:
1.	 Click on the Viewport Filters tab at the top-right of the screen and a list of available 
filters will appear. You can see the menu in the following screenshot:

Chapter 8
185
2.	 First, click on the Ambient Occlusion filter. This will add shadows, based on surface 
proximity and normal direction, on all the objects in your scene.
3.	 Now you can tweak your settings depending on the scale of your scene and your 
desired effect. The following screenshot is an example of the settings used in the 
scene that is provided. Try sliding the values around to get comfortable with what 
they affect:


By adjusting the Number of Casts and Directions values, you will basically 
be able to control how much noise or smoothness the ambient occlusion 
creates with its light rights and the direction of those rays.


Cast Length will determine how far the shadows will reach out from the 
corners of your objects.

Ready for My Closeup
186


Fade controls the falloff of the shadows coming out of the corners.  
This will give a more subtle change to the way the ambient occlusion  
is affecting the scene.


Darkness affects how dark the dark areas will become. This will have a 
stronger effect on your scene.


Blur will help smooth out the noise to a great extent. Every ambient 
occlusion ray will be blurred so that you don't see each individual ray.


Blur Radius will adjust the extent of the blur for fine-tuning.


If you check the box for Only AO then you will only show the ambient 
occlusion, which consists of only black to white values without any other 
texture map detail. This can be useful if you are going to composite your 
ambient occlusion onto other renders outside Mudbox.
4.	 The next viewport filter is the Cavity Ambient Occlusion filter. This filter is similar  
to the Ambient Occlusion filter, except it is more geared towards finer details.  
This setting is to help define cracks, crevices, and places where objects meet.  
The following screenshot shows the settings used in the example:


The Strength attribute will control the intensity of this effect.


Sample Radius defines the amount of screen space that is sampled to 
determine the filter's effect. This may need some tweaking to make sure you 
get the details you want out of small and large objects. This setting can make 
things look wrong if you do not set it correctly.


The Cutoff Radius settings adjust how far the effect extends from the 
cavities, crevices, or corners of your models.


Shadow Color will define the color of the dark areas that are added. I 
recommend not setting this to pitch black. Give a little bit of color depending 
on what kind of ambience (bounced light) is in the room.


The Quality drop-down menu will just let you choose how crisp it looks.

Chapter 8
187
5.	 Next thing that is added is the Depth of Field filter. This filter will mimic a camera's 
focal length. This is most apparent in macro lens cameras. Macro lenses tend to have 
very little depth of field. This means that only objects that are at a certain distance 
from the camera are sharp looking. As you get away from the focal point, the image 
will get blurry real fast. The following screenshot shows the settings for this example:


The Depth of Field attribute controls how fast the image gets blurry as you 
get away from the focal point.


Focus Distance is the setting for how deep into your scene you want the 
focus to be. Outside this area, the scene will start getting blurry depending 
on your settings.


Blur Amount determines just how blurry the image gets as you get farther 
away from the area under Focus Distance.
6.	 Keep in mind that setting up Depth of Field is reliant on your camera position.
7.	
Lastly, click on Tonemapper under the Viewport Filters tab. Tone mapping is often 
used to simulate a higher dynamic range of color and values in a scene, which can 
improve the contrast and color quality. The following screenshot shows the settings 
used in the example:

Ready for My Closeup
188


Gamma will control the brightness of your viewport while Luminance Max 
will alter what color value is used as white.


A higher gamma will result in a brighter image while a higher luminance will 
increase the value considered white and thus, darken the scene.


Click the Glare arrow to see the Glare options. Glare Scale will increase the 
amount of glare or bloom that is in the viewport while Level count will blur 
the glare. Glare Bias will limit how far the glare will spread where it exists  
on screen.


A higher Glare Scale will result in more glare softened by a higher Level 
Count. A higher Glare Bias will spread the amount of glare over a larger 
distance. Glare creates a simulated effect of reflected light; more glare 
means more light reflecting back at the camera. This can help enhance your 
scene but can also lead to a blown out image.

Creating a rock normal map with a normal 
map filter
This recipe will show you how to create a normal map from your scene using the normal  
map viewport filter. This technique can be very useful in creating a large variety of textures  
with multiple map outputs. Not only will this recipe teach you how to get a normal map,  
based on your viewport, but it will also show you how to use that in combination with  
other viewport renders.
Getting ready
First thing you need to do is import some rocks that you would like to make a normal map out 
of. If you do not have rocks of your own, than you can open up the file named Rock_Layout.
mud, in the code files for this book.

Chapter 8
189
This was created by duplicating and arranging the rock that we used in the earlier recipes of 
this chapter. 
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to use normal map filters to create a rock normal map:
1.	 Click on the Viewport Filters tab, on the top right-hand side of the Mudbox interface.
2.	 Now, click on the Normal Map filter, as shown in the following screenshot:

Ready for My Closeup
190
Notice the viewport change to the spectrum of normal map colors.
3.	 Next, we should switch to the top camera angle. While you can save the screen image 
from any camera angle, it is suggested that you organize your scene for one of the 
perpendicular cameras such as Top in the Object List tab.
The easiest way to switch to the top view is by clicking on the Top plane of the view 
cube in the corner of your viewport. The view cube should look something as shown 
in the following screenshot, before you click on Top:
By looking through the top view you can rearrange your rocks easier, if needed, as 
well as get rid of any angles from the flat plane that the rocks are sitting on. If you'd 
like you can add some texture by sculpting onto the plane itself. Otherwise, you can 
combine this normal map with other normal maps using software like CrazyBump  
or nDo.

Chapter 8
191
4.	 The last thing we need to do is render out a high resolution screen render of our 
normal map.
One nice feature that Mudbox offers is its ability to take very high resolution screen 
captures of its viewport. If you want a screen grab from most other software, you 
would have to use the Print Screen button, which limits the resolution to the size of 
your desktop resolution.
To get a high resolution screen grab from Mudbox, you need to go to Render | Save 
Screen Image.... It should look like the following screenshot:
5.	 Now, you can adjust the settings to your liking. It is best to get a higher resolution 
render than you need. This is a good idea because you can always shrink your map 
down later, but you can not scale it up. Your image is limited to the resolution that  
the image was created at. The following screenshot has the settings that I used for 
this example:

Ready for My Closeup
192
Also, keep in mind that if you are creating a texture for games, then the image needs 
to be saved in a resolution that is a power of 2. Some examples of this would be 64 
pixels, 128 pixels, 256 pixels, 512 pixels, 1024 pixels, and so on.
Another thing you could do is remove the plane from the scene and check the box 
labeled Save with transparency. This will create an alpha channel for your rocks 
so that you can combine it with other normal maps within a program, such as 
Photoshop, more easily.
The following screenshot is of the normal map that was created, applied to a plane  
in Autodesk Maya, consisting of only two triangles:

Creating a turntable
This recipe will show you how to create a turntable in Mudbox 2013, and save it to a movie 
file. Creating a turntable of your model is a very good method of showing off an asset that  
you have created. You get to see the model from all sides and you can let it loop for as long  
as you want.
Getting ready
For this recipe we are just going to use the default cow model that comes with Mudbox. Just 
open up Mudbox, choose File | New Scene, and choose the cow from the Starting points 
window that pops up.

Chapter 8
193
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to create a turntable:
1.	 First, choose Render | Create Turntable Movie....
2.	 Adjust the settings to the output size and frames per second you desire. Recording  
at a larger resolution and higher frame rate will require more computing power.  
The following screenshot shows the settings for an HD sized render of the turntable:
You have to do a little math when setting up your timing. In the previous example,  
we are rendering out 60 frames of video, total, with a playback speed of 15 frame(s)/
second. This means that the turntable, which is created with these settings, will last 
4 seconds long.
In the Movie Format section, you will need to choose between rendering a .mov,  
a .swf, a .flv, or a sequence of images.

Ready for My Closeup
194
3.	 Lastly, click on Create... when you are ready to record the turntable and indicate 
where to save the movie.
The turnaround movie will automatically open after Mudbox has completed rendering.

Introduction
This chapter will cover proper joint creation and posing practices in Mudbox 2013. The 
techniques and tools you will learn in this chapter will help you in presenting your sculpts. By 
giving a dynamic pose to the characters you create, you will add more emotion to your sculpt. 
When you pose your character you should always be thinking about how your adjustments 
are affecting the silhouette of your character or object from all angles. A more interesting 
silhouette will make a much more interesting pose. When looking at the silhouette, you not 
only want to look at the shapes your model is creating, but also the shapes that the negative 
space is creating. This means you want to have interesting shapes that fit your theme within 
the empty space that surrounds your character or object. By paying attention to these details, 
you will be able to affect the viewer in subtle ways. For example, if you give your silhouettes 
positive and negative space, and a lot of sharp angles, it may support the theme of a villain, 
of anger, energy, or danger. Sharp angles tend to bring up similar emotions to these and 
therefore can infuse a deeper emotional impact into your sculpts and poses.

Posing a lamp cord by adding joints to  
your mesh
This recipe will go over the process of adding joints and posing a lamp cord using Mudbox's 
posing tools. In this recipe, we will be using the basic posing tools Create Joint and Pose. 
These tools will allow you to define an area of influence so you can rotate and/or move these 
areas of your mesh into your desired position. 
Getting ready
To begin, you will need to import the Lamp.obj file from the code files of this book.  
If you would like to see the finished product you can open up the Lamp.mud file.
Once you've opened the Lamp.obj file, you will get a couple of dialog boxes that you can 
ignore. For example:
f
f
The first one will say that There are t-shapes in this mesh. When this pops up you 
can just hit OK.
f
f
Next, you will see a window saying there is a High-valence vertex and Non-manifold 
topology in the mesh. To ignore this message, just click on Keep this Mesh.
The reason we can ignore these messages is because we will not be subdividing this mesh 
within Mudbox. If you try to subdivide this mesh without cleaning it up first, in another 
program, then you will just get an error and Mudbox will not allow the subdivision to happen.
After importing the mesh, you should be left with the model shown in the  
following screenshot:

Chapter 9
197
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to add joints and pose a lamp cord using Mudbox's  
posing tools:
1.	 First thing you are going to do is change the view that we have of the object. By 
switching to the top view we will be able to move the wire around in the X and Z 
directions but not the Y. This will help you to pose the wire more accurately without 
having to worry about whether the cord is lying flat or not. The easiest way to do this 
is to click on Top located on the view cube on the corner of your interface.  
The following screenshot shows what the view cube looks like:
2.	 Now that you are looking from the top view, which should look like the following 
screenshot, you can add a joint to the lamp's power cord:
To do this you will need to select the Create Joint tool from the Pose Tools toolbar  
at the bottom left-hand side of the Mudbox interface. The toolbar should look like the 
following screenshot:

One Step Forward
198
3.	 Now, you are going to left-click and drag on the part of the mesh that you would like 
to influence. The way in which this tool works, you will start your drag in the location 
where you would like your mesh to bend, while posing, and end your drag in the 
direction that you would like influenced. Also, take note that the length of your drag 
defines the falloff of the bend. This means, a short drag will create a sharper bend 
while a longer drag will allow a more gradual bend. Try creating a joint using a short 
drag using the Create Joint tool. The following screenshot is an example of a drag  
in progress:
4.	 Once you have done this, you will be switching over to the Pose tool. This can be 
found in the same toolbar as the Create Joint tool. With this tool you are going to 
grab the end of your lamp's power cord and left-click and drag to bend the cord.  
The following screenshot shows this tool in action:

Chapter 9
199
5.	 Now, just repeat steps 2 to 4, while trying out different drag distances, until you end 
up with something like the following screenshot:
If you would like to see the finished version, you can open up the Lamp.mud file to 
see the final project, as shown in the following screenshot:

Posing multiple objects at the same time
This recipe will demonstrate how you can create joints and pose multiple objects using 
the Weights tool. What you learn here will be used over and over again, especially if you 
are a character artist for games or films. Most of the time, your characters will have many 
accessories that they will be wearing, such as hats, shirts, armor, weapons, jewellery, and 
so on. In order to have all these objects stay with the body part they are attached to, you will 
need to follow the steps listed in this recipe.
Getting ready
To start with, you can either bring in your own objects and work along with the recipe or you 
can open up the Hand.mud file that is present in the code files of this book. When you open 
up the Hand.mud file, the following screenshot is what you should see:
As you can see in the previous screenshot, there are two objects in this scene, part of an arm 
and a ring. This recipe will show you how to pose this hand while having the ring follow along. 
How to do it...
The following steps will help pose multiple objects at the same time:
1.	 First, you are going to select the Create Joint tool located in the Pose Tools toolbar in 
the bottom left-hand side of the Mudbox interface. It should look something similar to 
the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
201
2.	 Next, you can click-and-drag a short distance on the wrist to create a joint with a 
short falloff. The following screenshot shows what your joint should look like. If you 
would like more information on how the joint tool works you can read the recipe 
Posing a lamp cord by adding joints to your mesh, found in this chapter.
3.	 You will notice in the previous screenshot that the ring is not green like the rest of the 
hand. This is because the Create Joint tool only works on one object at a time. If we 
were to pose this hand in its current state, it would turn out looking something like 
the following screenshot:

One Step Forward
202
Notice that the hand moved but the ring did not. To fix this we are going to have to 
add weights to the ring.
To do this you will need to select the Weights tool from the same toolbar where you 
found the Create Joint tool, in the Pose Tools toolbar on the bottom left-hand side of 
the Mudbox interface.
4.	 Now, you can paint the weights in by using the tool like a brush. Paint the ring until 
it is all green. Once you have done this, your ring will now be influenced when you 
pose the hand. The following screenshot shows what the hand should look like after 
adding weights:
5.	 Next, try posing the hand with the weights painted on the hand. By using the Pose 
tool, found in the same toolbar as Create Joint and Weights, you can now grab the 
tips of the fingers and pull the hand down to bend it. The following screenshot shows 
an example:

Chapter 9
203
By knowing this, you will be able to pose as many objects as you need by using the 
Weights tool. The following screenshot is what the hand looks like posed with the 
ring. Notice, none of the geometry is cutting into the other geometry, leaving you with 
a nice clean pose:

Adjusting joint pivots and painting weights
This recipe will show you how to create and adjust joint pivots, and paint weights. Joints are 
the bones of the skeleton, which will let you pose your model. Weights allow you to specify 
what portions of the model a joint will influence.

One Step Forward
204
Getting ready
Once you have imported a model to pose, like the one shown in the following screenshot,  
you will be ready to create joints: 
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to create and adjust joint pivots, and paint weights: 
1.	 Click on the Pose Tools tab at the bottom left-hand side of your screen and select  
the Create Joint tool. This will allow you to pick the starting anchor of the joint for 
your model.
2.	 Click on the area of your model you wish to start the joint from and drag the joint out 
to where you want it to end. In the case of a human, try creating a simple arm joint to 
affect the arm, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
205
Notice a bright green gradient emanating from the initial pivot. This is the weighted 
area of your model that will be affected by the joint.
3.	 By rotating, Alt + left-clicking and dragging the camera, you will also notice that the 
pivot you just created needs some adjustment.

One Step Forward
206
4.	 Click on the Pose Tools tab at the bottom left-hand side of your screen and select the 
Move Pivot tool. This will allow you to freely drag the pivot in the viewport.
5.	 Drag the pivot to adjust it and set it in the proper position. Think of this as a real 
human. Locate the shoulder joint and that is where you will want to place your pivot. 
This is shown in the following screenshot:
6.	 Now that the pivot of the joint is in the right place, you will need to adjust the 
weighting of the joint to have it affect the proper areas of your model.
To do this, click the Pose Tools tab at the bottom left-hand side of your screen  
and select the Weights tool, as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 9
207
This will allow you to paint a gradient, from clear to bright green on your model. The 
joint will fully influence areas with solid bright green and, will have no influence on 
areas which are clear.
7.	
Drag the brush along areas you want to influence and Ctrl + left-click and drag your 
brush to paint out the influence, as shown in the following screenshot:
8.	 Adjust your brush size by pressing B + left-clicking and dragging the brush.  
This will allow you to affect larger or smaller areas easily. This is shown in the 
following screenshot:

One Step Forward
208
9.	 Adjusting weights of joints is the key to achieving the desired effect of a joint  
on your model.
How it works...
When you are applying joints to your model you are basically creating bones that make it 
easier for you to position your model. Each joint is a location that can be rotated and moved 
while every piece of mesh around these joints is given a certain percentage of influence.
In Mudbox, the way this works is, everything with solid green is influenced by 100 percent, by 
the joint you have created. As this green falls off, so does the influence. Another thing that 
is different about Mudbox from other software, such as Autodesk Maya, is that when you 
create joints with Mudbox, it is more temporary and is mainly used for posing one piece at a 
time. In Maya, you would place all the bones of your object in locations that will allow proper 
deformation of your model. These bones would each have weights painted, giving every joint 
a certain percentage of influence over the vertices of your model. These bones can then be 
animated or posed to bring life to your model.
The next recipe will go over how to bring joints in from another program , such as Maya. That 
way you don't have to throw away all your hard work if you have already created what is called 
a rig for your character.

Creating a human rig by importing joints
This recipe will show you how to import joints from another 3D package. Autodesk Maya 
will be used to create the rig for this character. A rig is a system of bones used to control 
animation or posing of models within a 3D package.
Getting ready
For this recipe, you may use the skeleton located in the code files of this book. The file is 
named Joint Recipe Man.fbx. This mesh was exported using Maya's FBX export option 
with default settings. Most 3D packages will have a .fbx exporter; it is a common file type. 
Next to a .obj, I would say, the .fbx is the next most widely used file type for bringing assets 
from one package to another.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you import joints from Autodesk Maya: 
1.	 First off, be sure to export the Joint Recipe Man file from your 3D package as FBX 
so that you can bring the joints with your mesh. The .obj file type does not support 
joints, only the mesh. The .fbx file type is supported by Mudbox and will allow proper 
transfer of your skeleton.
2.	 Next step is to import your .fbx. If you do not have a 3D package to create and 
export your skeleton as a .fbx, then you can use the one in the code files of this 
book. As mentioned earlier, the filename is Joint Recipe Man.fbx. Now, click 
on Import under the File tab in Mudbox to import your FBX model. The following 
screenshot displays the menu in which you will find the Import option:

One Step Forward
210
The following screenshot shows that the model is imported along with the joints  
and skinning from Maya. Custom controls and functions will not be imported with  
the skeleton:
You can now transform these joints in Mudbox to pose your model. Just use the Pose 
tool from the Pose Tools toolbar in the bottom left-hand side of the Mudbox interface.

Introduction
This chapter will cover texture extraction practices within Mudbox 2013. You will learn how to 
extract texture maps that can be used to simulate higher polygon counts and therefore adding 
more detail without the performance hits. You will also learn how to extract maps that will add 
self-shadowing on your object, which will make it more believable. Ever wondered how you can 
make a tiling texture within Mudbox? This chapter will also cover a technique you can use to 
make tiling textures.
Extracting sculpt information as a normal 
map
This recipe will show you how to extract a normal map from your sculpted model. Normal 
maps are an excellent tool for adding more detail to your objects without all the polygons. 
This is an essential tool if you are creating assets for next generation games such as the Call 
of Duty series or Mass Effect. The texture will pick up light information in a way that suggests 
more detail than is actually modeled into the object.

212
Getting ready
For this recipe you will need a model with multiple subdivision levels so that you can bake 
information from the high resolution level down to the lower resolution level. If you have a 
sculpt that you have created in Mudbox and you'd like to follow along, then go ahead and load 
it up now. If you do not have a sculpt of your own or you would just like to follow the recipe 
more closely, then you can open up Victorian Lioness Not UVed.mud. When you open 
up the file you should see the following screenshot:
This sculpt was created by starting with the default bust mesh that comes with Mudbox,  
as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
213
The UVs for this bust comes set up for you by default, but if your sculpt changes too much 
from the original shape of the bust, you will need to recreate the UVs of your low poly model. 
This step is needed to give room in your texture for detail information. I have listed the 
following steps you can take to export your low poly model, adjust the UVs, and import  
the UVs back into Mudbox:
1.	 First, we need to get the model out of Mudbox and into another 3D package. Whichever 
program you bring it into, just make sure it has the ability to manipulate UVs. 
To export the model we will be begin by clicking the Page Down key until you reach 
Level 0 on your model. The following screenshot is of the Victorian Lioness low poly 
with the wireframe turned on:

Get Baked
214
2.	 Now we are going to right-click on the model and choose Select Model from the 
menu that pops up, as shown in the following screenshot: 
3.	 Next, choose Export Selection from the File menu in the upper left-hand side of the 
Mudbox interface. Now give it a name and click on Save.
4.	 Now, in the software of your choice you're going to adjust the UVs to how you want 
them. The code files of this book have a UV'ed and a non-UV'ed version of the low 
poly in case you don't have other software to use. 
With this particular model you can get away with just using a smooth UV tool in your 
desired software. UVing is beyond the scope of this book, but if you'd like to learn 
more about UVing there are plenty of resources available online.
Once your UVs have been laid out you will need to export the model as a .obj file or 
a .fbx file to bring the UVs back into Mudbox.
5.	 Now that you have your UVs the way you want them, you will need to get those UVs 
onto the low poly version of your model inside Mudbox. To do this, you will need to go 
to File | Import UV in the Mudbox menu bar. Now choose the file called Victorian 
Lioness Low Uved.obj or the file that you created yourself, if you reworked your 
own UVs.

Chapter 10
215
6.	 A window will pop up asking how you would like to match the UVs. Your choices will be 
Vertex ID and Position. You are going to choose Vertex ID for this model. The window 
that pops up should look as shown in the following screenshot:
The reason Vertex ID is the best choice for this model is because we have not made 
any changes to the mesh, by adding or removing any vertices. Each vertex has a 
number and as long as these numbers stay intact Mudbox will be able to easily 
import the UVs of your object. 
If you make any adjustments to your model, by adding or removing vertices, then you 
should go with Position. If you choose Position, then Mudbox will try to determine the 
UVs based on the world coordinates of your vertices.
7.	
That's it! Your UVs should be ready to go. The following screenshot is a comparison of 
the UVs. Mudbox's default UVs are on the left while the adjusted UVs are on the right.

How to do it...
The following steps will help you to extract a normal map from your sculpted model: 
1.	 Now that your UVs are all set up, click on the Maps tab at the top of your screen 
and select New Operation... under Extract Texture Maps. The following screenshot 
shows what the menu looks like:
2.	 This will bring up a window to name the operation and select its type. Name the 
operation Normal Map Extraction and select Normal Map from the options under 
Maps to Generate.
Naming the operation will allow you to easily utilize the same options and functions 
for re-baking your normal map or in baking other models without having to select the 
same inputs again.
The following screenshot is what you should see at the top of the window,  
after selecting Normal Map and naming the extraction:

Chapter 10
217
3.	 After clicking on Normal Map the new window that appears will reveal the settings 
that you can use to tweak your texture bakes. These settings allow you to customize 
the parameters of baking the normal map and you can choose where to save the 
normal map. The following screenshot is of the settings portion of the Extract 
Texture Maps window with the settings that will be used for this recipe:

Get Baked
218
4.	 Now, we will go over some of the settings and figure out what they do. First off, make 
sure that the target model has the resolution of the model you wish to bake onto. 
The source model should be the resolution of the model you want to bake from, onto 
your target model.
5.	 The Method drop-down menu will give you two choices: 


The first choice is Subdivision, which is the method that we will be using 
for this sculpt. This method uses the vertex position of the high subdivision 
level in relation to the low subdivision level of your sculpt. This method will 
produce fewer artifacts than Ray Casting, but Ray Casting will capture the 
height differences better than Subdivision method.


Next choice is Ray Casting. This method samples the distance of the source 
model and target model using sample rays cast along the normals of the 
target model.
In the following screenshot, you will notice an artifact that is created by the Ray 
Casting method that is not present in the Subdivision bake:
6.	 Generate one map for all objects can be used for baking a single normal map from 
multiple objects in your scene. This is useful when multiple objects have UVs on the 
same map file. Otherwise, you can select Generate a map for each target to create 
separate normal maps per object.

If you are creating a Ray Casting method bake, then these settings will become 
available. The following screenshot shows this menu:

Choose Samples will determine which value to use when a particular sample 
intersects the source model more than once. Depending on the nature of 
your sculpture, one may yield better results than the other.

By default, Furthest outside is selected and usually does not need to be 
changed. This will take the furthest value from the source model while 
Furthest inside performs the opposite. Closest to lowres mesh will use the 
sample closest to the target model.
8.	 Select the Image Size based on what you need the normal map for. A higher 
resolution size will increase the number of pixels Mudbox will produce for the  
normal map.
9.	 Antialiasing will soften the result of baking high resolution down. Setting this to  
2x should offer enough softening if desired.
10.	 After you have determined all the values you want and established where to save the 
image, click on Extract to bake the normal map.
11.	 If you decide to check the box for Preview as Normal Map, then Mudbox will 
automatically update your model with the normal map by adding it to your Paint 
Layers. Lower your model's resolution to its base level 0 to see the effect of the 
normal map on your low poly model. The following screenshot shows the file at 
different stages:

12.	If you open up your normal map it should look something similar to the  
following screenshot:
How it works...
When Mudbox extracts a normal map, it is recording the difference in placement of the surface 
from high poly to low poly, or from source model to target model. The resulting normal map is a 
variety of reds, greens, and blues which each represent a different direction in world/tangent 
space. When you look at a normal map image you just see the RGB values, but when you plug 
the map into the normal channel of a game engine or 3D software, then the software will 
interpret the colors as coordinates for the light to bounce off from.
There's more...
This sculpt's low poly was created by Mudbox, based on the details I added to the high poly 
version of the sculpt. Typically, the topology of the low poly model will not be exactly how 
you want it to be and will require some retopologizing. So, when you export your low poly to 
redo the UVs, you may also want to clean up some of the geometry as well. This may require 
exporting the high poly version, to be used as a guide. Just follow the same steps as you did 
for the low poly to achieve this. 

Chapter 10
221
Retopoligizing just means that you are going back and recreating the low poly model to 
match the shape of the high poly model so that your distribution of polygons are laid out more 
evenly and more efficiently, and with consideration of any areas that will be deformed during 
animation. The other important thing that retopologizing allows you to do is to create a better 
UV layout for the low poly model.
There are many tools out there that you can use for retopologizing your low poly models.  
The following are a few good ones:

Extracting an ambient occlusion map
This recipe will show you how to extract an ambient occlusion map from your sculpted model. 
By adding an ambient occlusion pass to your textures, you will notice a big improvement on 
how real your object will feel. The ambient occlusion map simulates the way light bounces  
off the surface of a real world object and leaves more shadows in the crevices and corners  
of the object. This is a standard addition to textures and renders within the movie, television,  
3D visualization, and game industries.
Getting ready
For this recipe, you will need a model with multiple subdivision levels so that you can bake 
information from the high resolution level down to the lower resolution level. If you have a 
sculpt that you have created in Mudbox and you'd like to follow along with, then go ahead  
and load it up now. If you do not have a sculpt of your own or you would just like to follow  
the recipe more closely then you can open up Victorian Lioness Not UVed.mud.

Get Baked
222
You will also need to set up the UVs for your ambient occlusion map to bake to. Just follow  
the steps listed in the Getting ready section of the Extracting sculpt information as a normal 
map recipe.
For easier results in determining the outcome of your ambient occlusion map, set your model 
material's Diffuse color to white and reduce the Specular and Gloss to black. This will let 
you see how the ambient occlusion map is affecting the look of your model. To adjust these 
settings, you can right-click on the model in Mudbox and choose Edit Material. You should 
see a menu as shown in the following screenshot:
The model's material should look similar to the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
223
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to extract an ambient occlusion map:
1.	 Click on the Maps tab at the top of your screen and select New Operation... under 
Extract Texture Maps:
2.	 This will bring up a window to name the operation and select its type. Name the 
operation Ambient Occlusion Extraction and select Ambient Occlusion Map  
from the options under Maps to Generate:, as shown in the following screenshot:

Get Baked
224
3.	 After clicking on Ambient Occlusion Map, the window will extend with more options. 
This allows you to customize the parameters of baking the ambient occlusion map 
and to decide where to save it. The following screenshot has the settings that we will 
be using for the Lioness bake:
4.	 Make sure that the target model is the resolution of the model you wish to bake onto. 
Otherwise, the UVs and surface detail may not line up correctly with the intended low 
poly model.

Chapter 10
225
5.	 The Quality setting will affect how fast your bake will render and the quality of the 
map. Fastest is good for doing tests with large ambient occlusion bakes while Best 
will give you a better final output.
6.	 Select the Image Size based on what you need the ambient occlusion map for.  
A higher resolution size will increase the number of pixels Mudbox will produce  
for the ambient occlusion map.
7.	
Antialiasing will soften the result of baking high resolution down. Setting this to 2x 
should offer enough softening if desired.
8.	 Shadow Darkness will determine how intense the shadows will be. A lower value will 
result in a brighter map and a higher value will result in a darker map.
9.	 Shadow Contrast affects the contrast between areas with shadow and areas that 
have no shadow. Increasing the value increases the contrast and decreasing it 
decreases the contrast. The default value offers a great starting point.
10.	 Set the Filter to a lower value for sharp details. Higher filter values result in a softer 
output, which will help to hide any artifacts.
11.	 Before extracting your ambient occlusion map you may want to check the box labeled 
Preview as Diffuse, if you would like to see the map on your model once the bake is 
complete. Now, click on Extract to bake out the map.
12.	Set the display to flat lighting, by right-clicking in the viewport and choosing Flat 
lighting, to see the effects of the ambient occlusion map without the default lighting 
getting in the way. The following screenshot displays the default lighting version on 
the left and the flat lighting version on the right:
13.	Now, this map can be used as a Multiply layer in your Diffuse layers. Make sure you 
place it above the rest of your diffuse texture by dragging the layer in the Layers tab.

Get Baked
226
14.	 Once your layers are in place, you may want to intensify your ambient occlusion map. 
To do this you can right-click on the ambient occlusion layer and choose Adjust Color 
from the right-click menu. In the window that pops up, you will be able to adjust 
Hue, Saturation, Value, and adjust the Curves of the layer. To intensify your ambient 
occlusion map, we are going to drag the curves around to get the contrast that we want.
Curves can be a little tricky to understand at first. Basically, the X axis represents the dark  
and light areas of your texture, while the Y axis determines how bright or dark those areas  
will become.
For example, if you drag the right-hand side of the curve upwards, then the highlights in 
your texture will get brighter; if you drag it downwards the highlight areas will get darker. 
Meanwhile, if you drag the left-hand side of the curve upward, then the shadow areas of your 
texture will get brighter, while dragging the left-hand side of the curve downward will make 
your shadow areas even darker.
The following screenshot shows one configuration you might use with a basic stone texture:

Chapter 10
227
I recommend you keep playing around with these settings until you get a feel for what they do. 
Curves are a very powerful tool and you will find yourself wanting to use them for the control 
that they give you.

Adding grunge inside crevices using the Dry 
Brush
This recipe will show you how to add grunge inside the crevices of your sculpts. We will be 
looking at the Victorian Lioness sculpt to show you how you can paint within the crevices or 
avoid crevices using the Dry Brush.
Getting ready
First, you will need to open the Victorian Lioness Statue.mud file. When you open the 
file, you will see the result of this recipe. If you would like to follow along, then you should hide 
the Grunge layer. Feel free to bring your own model in and apply this technique to your own 
work. The following screenshot shows the grungy, old statue that you should see when you 
open the Victorian Lioness Statue.mud file:

Get Baked
228
If you have done the Extracting an ambient occlusion map recipe you may notice a little 
difference in the color of the statue. This is a result of some more Adjust Color adjustments. 
If you have not read that recipe yet, I recommend that you do.
How to do it...
The following steps will help you to add grunge inside the crevices of your sculpts:
1.	 Now that you have the sculpt you would like to add details to, you will select the Dry 
Brush from the Paint Tools toolbar present in the lower-left corner of the interface,  
as shown in the following screenshot:
2.	 Now choose a color that you would like to paint into the crevices. You can also choose 
a stamp if you'd like to add some variation in the paint. The following screenshot 
shows the settings that I started out with:

Chapter 10
229
3.	 Begin painting in the grunge or other details where you would like them while 
holding the Ctrl key. This will make the brush have the opposite effect of its standard 
function. Normally, the Dry Brush will only affect the raised surfaces of your sculpt 
but because we are holding the Ctrl key it is only affecting the parts of the sculpt that 
lie within crevices. Just to illustrate what is happening, I have added some bright red 
paint to the crevices of this model using the Dry Brush, as shown in the  
following screenshot: 
4.	 Now, add more details in the crevices and on the outsides of the crevices until you 
have built up your desired details. I recommend using a combination of Dry Brush, 
Sponge brush, Burn brush, and the Dodge brush to tweak your painting.

Extracting and using a vector displacement 
map for sculpting
This recipe will go over how to create a vector displacement map so that you can use it 
to sculpt with complex stamps. This feature is unique to Mudbox and takes the idea of a 
displacement map one step further by allowing crevices and overhangs to be captured by  
the extracted texture map. Vector displacement technology is a very recent development  
and presents some unique methods to add to your workflow as an artist.
Getting ready
The first thing you are going to need is a sculpt that you would like to turn into a vector 
displacement stamp, or stencil. If you do not have your own details sculpted you can use  
the Vector Displacement Sculpt.mud file to follow along with the recipe more closely. 
The following screenshot shows what this sculpt looks like:
Keep in mind that if you create your own details, they should be done on a flat plane  
for this exercise.
How to do it...
Now that you have your sculpt ready to go, we can start the extraction process as mentioned 
in the following steps:

Chapter 10
231
1.	 We are going to bake this vector displacement map down to a flat plane to allow for a 
better stamp, or stencil. If you reduce your sculpt's level down to 0 you will notice that 
the plane is not flat, as shown in the following screenshot:
For this reason we are going to create a new plane to bake to, instead of baking down 
to level 0 of the high poly sculpt.
2.	 To create a new plane you will need to go to the menu, at the top of the Mudbox 
interface, and go to Create | Mesh | Plane. The following screenshot displays  
what the menu should look like inside Mudbox 2013:

Get Baked
232
3.	 Now you should rename the new plane so it is easier to tell which plane is which. 
Select the new plane, if it isn't selected already, and go into its Properties on the 
right-hand side of the Mudbox interface. Find the Name textbox and change the 
name to Target. The following screenshot shows what the Properties window  
looks like:
4.	 Now, go into the Maps menu item, at the top of the Mudbox interface, and create  
a New Operation by going into Extract Texture Maps.
5.	 In the Extract Texture Maps window that pops up, you will rename your extraction to 
Vector Displacement Extraction and choose Vector Displacement, as shown in the 
following screenshot:

Chapter 10
233
6.	 When the window extends, revealing the vector displacement options, you will need to 
enter in the settings shown in the following screenshot. We will go over these settings 
in the following steps:

Get Baked
234
7.	
To set up the target model, that is the model with the UVs you are baking to, you will 
need to select the plane we had labeled Target. Now click on Add Selected next to 
the Target Models window. Target should show up in the box on the left.
8.	 Now, do the same thing for the Source Models section. The source model will be our 
high poly sculpt that has the details we would like to capture. 
9.	 Next, designate the resolution you would like to use. In this case we will be using  
a 1024x1024 map. This should give us plenty of resolution for details given the  
size of the details that the sculpt is representing.
10.	 As long as you are using the vector displacement map inside Mudbox you can leave 
the Vector Space set to Relative Tangent.
11.	 Now, select a Base File Name and location that your bake/extraction will be 
rendered to. Note that you will need to add _vdm to the end of your filename  
if you are planning on using the map as a stamp or stencil, which we are.
You can choose .tif or .exr extensions if you are only working on Mudbox. If you 
plan on working outside Mudbox, you will need to look at what your other software 
can read.
12.	Now, click on Extract and voila! You have a vector displacement map.
There's more...
Now that we have the vector displacement map it's time to create a stamp with it!
1.	 To do so you will first need to browse to the vector displacement map using the Image 
Browser interface. You can add a stamp in other ways as well, which are covered in 
Chapter 4, Fine Tooth Comb.
2.	 Once you have navigated to the folder where the image is located, you should see an 
image that looks something as shown in the following screenshot:

Chapter 10
235
3.	 With the image selected, you can click on the Set Stamp icon at the top of the Image 
Browser interface. This will set the current image as a stamp on your current brush. 
In this case, make sure you are selecting the standard Sculpt brush. The following 
screenshot shows what the Set Stamp icon should look like: 
4.	 Now you will need to adjust your stamp settings by clicking on your Sculpt brush's 
Properties, to reveal the stamp settings. The following screenshot shows the settings 
that I used for this demonstration: 

Get Baked
236
5.	 The important settings here are as follows:


Strength: This should be set to 100 to get the full details from the map when 
you paint


Use Stamp Image: This should be checked for obvious reasons


Stamp Spacing: This should be set high enough that you are not piling the 
details directly on top of each other on every brush stroke


Setting Buildup to 100 will help in a similar way as it did in the case  
of Strength
6.	 Now that our stamp is all set up let's give it a try! Go to File | New Scene and choose 
a Starting Point. I will be choosing the reptile for this demonstration. The following 
screenshot shows what the mesh should look like:
7.	
Press Shift + D several times, until you reach level 5 or so. This will give us enough 
resolution to sculpt on.
8.	 Notice that when you click on the Sculpt brush your stamp is still attached and the 
settings are intact. Mudbox will remember what you were using from one project 
to another. Now, use this brush to add some of our new vector displacement map 
details! The following screenshot shows a segment of the reptile with the stamp's 
details applied:
