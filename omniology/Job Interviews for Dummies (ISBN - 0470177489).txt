Author’s Acknowledgments
“We’re better together” is a philosophy proven yet again in this richly
informed book. The largess of helpful information you find within these 
pages is to a large degree due to my luck in sourcing many respected minds
in the employment space. Contributors to whom I am especially indebted 
are individually credited in chapter pages. Applause to one and all.
Additionally, thanks a billion to the following individuals who worked long
and hard to make this book happen:
Traci Cumbay, intrepid editor and clear-eyed train engineer who kept this
ambitious work running on track; she’s earned her rave reviews, chapter 
by chapter.
James M. Lemke, above-the-title technical reviewing star whose brainwork 
is indispensable to every book I write.
John S. Gill, college student, computer genie, and editorial whiz kid who 
I predict has a big future ahead of him; after he graduates, he’ll have to fight
off recruiters.
Muriel Turner, Alberto Mendez, and Kelly James, each of whom kept my
landfill . . . er, I mean office . . . from crashing and burning; I appreciate you.
Gail Ross, literary agent–attorney and friend who continues to help me make
the right moves in the world of publishing.

Job Interviews For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Introduction
H
uman nature hasn’t changed over the past eight years since the previous
edition of Job Interviews For Dummies appeared in 2000. We humans still
like to do business with people we like, and we still like people who are like us.
But almost everything else about the interviewing process is transitioning in
ways you need to know about to be a top contender for the jobs you want. 
Changes in job interviews — those crucial meetings that seal the deal on who
gets hired — range from the interviewing medium itself (online video inter-
viewing) to who’s asking the questions and judging your answers (young and
younger). Even classic techniques used in salary negotiation that once worked
with predictable outcomes (more money) now need tweaking.
Job interviews continue to be a slice of performance art. They’re staged 
theatrical sketches rather than X-rays of life histories. (Read more about that
in Chapter 1.) That’s why theater and drama are once again the theme of this
book, and I hope you have some fun with it.
Why, you ask, should you expect a little fun and humor when finding out what
it takes to sail out of an interview with prospects of a five-star job offer? Isn’t
interviewing for a chunk of your future serious stuff? Sure it is, but in decades
of quizzing leading authorities on interviewing secrets, I’ve never found anyone
who says that discovering how to score at the job Oscars can’t be fun business
as well as serious business.
A lighthearted approach may even help you. In my opinion, Julie Andrews had
the right idea in the hit 1964 movie Mary Poppins when she sang: “A spoonful
of sugar helps the medicine go down.”
I hope you have some fun in this edition as you get ready to be a ShowStopper.
What Is a ShowStopper 
in Job Interviewing?
In the drama of job interviewing, a ShowStopper performance is one that
wins so much enthusiastic, prolonged applause that the show is temporarily
interrupted until the audience quiets down.

A ShowStopper meeting causes the employer interviewer to mentally shout
“Bravo! More!” Your stunning impact quickly translates to a preliminary deci-
sion in your favor. If follow-up interviews, testing, and reference-checking sup-
port that reaction, a job offer is on its way to you. The employer may continue
to see other candidates to round out the interview process, but in reality no
one else stands a chance of landing the job after you figuratively stop the show.
Job Interviews For Dummies, 3rd Edition, is packed with the essentials of 
performing ShowStopper interviews. These include
 Strategies and techniques.
 Sample dialogue and research tips.
 The best answers for make-or-break questions and reporting of news 
of current events in the interview world.
When you want metaphorical standing ovations with clapping and shouting
for more, follow the guidelines presented in these pages.
About This Book
A handbook of contemporary interview arts, Job Interviews For Dummies, 3rd
Edition, contains the wisdom of hundreds of leading interview experts whose
brains I’ve been privileged to pick for many years. (Okay, if you must know —
40 years of hearing from the best and the brightest.)
By absorbing the lowdown I pass on in this guide, you can interview your way
into a job by outpreparing and outperforming the other candidates.
Conventions Used in This Book
To assist your navigation of this book, I’ve established the following 
conventions:
 I use italic for emphasis and to highlight new words or terms that I define.
 I use monofont for Web addresses.
 Sidebars, which are shaded boxes of text, consist of information that’s
interesting but not necessarily critical to your understanding of the topic.
2
Job Interviews For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

Terms Used in This Book
Is there another word for synonym? Would a fly without wings be called a
walk? How is it possible to have a civil war? These one-liners from comedian
George Carlin (www.georgecarlin.com) hint at the importance of words.
I use the following terminology in this guide to label specific roles and 
organizations:
 A candidate or job seeker is a person applying for a job. (Another once-
common label, applicant, has fallen into disuse because of a federal regu-
lation that defines an applicant as one to be counted in discrimination
monitoring. But applicant means the same thing.)
 An interviewer is someone interviewing a candidate for a job. An inter-
viewee is a candidate being interviewed for a job.
 A human resources (or HR) specialist, HR manager, or screener is an
employer sentry who is conducting a screening interview. A hiring man-
ager, decision-maker, decision-making manager, or department manager
is a management representative who is conducting a selection interview.
(Read about the differences in screening and selection interviews in
Chapter 5.)
 A company, employer, or organization is the entity you hope to work for,
whether private and profitmaking or private and non-profitmaking. Agency
implies employment in the government (public) sector.
 A recruiter (also called a headhunter) is an intermediary between the
employer and you. Internal recruiters work inside the company, either as
regular employees of the human resources department, or as contract
employees. Third-party recruiters or independent recruiters are external
recruiters, some of whom are employed as retained recruiters on an ongo-
ing basis, while most are employed on a transaction basis as contingency
recruiters and are paid only when a candidate they submit is hired.
 A career coach (also called a career consultant) helps job seekers gain
workplace opportunities. (A career counselor and a career coach repre-
sent two different professions, although their work sometimes overlaps.)
Foolish Assumptions
I assume you picked up this book for one of the following reasons:
 You’ve never been through a competitive interview and you’re freaking
out. You could use a couple thousand friendly pointers from someone
who’s interviewed many of the marquee minds in the job interview 
business and lived to write about it.
3
Introduction

 You’ve been through a competitive interview and assume the company
sank like Atlantis because you never heard a peep from those folks again.
Or maybe you could have done better and heard back if you had known
more about what you were doing in this interview thing.
 The most important interview of your career is coming up. You realize
now is the hour to dramatically improve your interviewing success. You
need help, and you’re willing to work for it.
 You’ve been through a slew of job interviews over the course of your
career and have a hunch that some important things have changed (you
just don’t know what exactly) and you want to catch up with the help of
a trusted resource.
 You want to be in the interviewing know and are sure that authors of For
Dummies books give you the goods. You rely on For Dummies books to
get the facts you need to succeed without jumping through verbal hoops
until your eyes pop out of your head.
I further assume that you’re someone who likes reliable, comprehensive
information that gets to the point without rocking you to sleep. And I assume
even further that you like your expertise with a smile now and then.
How This Book Is Organized
Before he was famous, superstar George Clooney auditioned for a television
stereo commercial with a six-pack of beer tucked under his arm; he had
researched the type of actor the advertiser wanted for the role, one whose
attitude revealed the casual poise of a couch potato. He got the gig.
Later Clooney explained the contribution of performance in both theatrical
auditioning and job interviewing. He noted that the actor who lands the job
isn’t always the most talented but the one who makes the best impression:
“You get the job when you walk in the door. Because in a weird way, we’re not
selling acting. What we’re selling is confidence.”
Appearance. Performance skills. Confidence. All are winning — and learnable —
traits in job interviews as well as theatrical auditions. This book shows you
these traits and much, much more in the following five useful categories.
Part I: And the Interview 
Winner Is . . . You!
Of special interest to time-challenged readers, this part opens with an
overview of what’s happening right now in job interviewing circles, beginning
with the theme of this handbook: interviews are theater. A spotlight on new
4
Job Interviews For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

topics is next, including the beginning of interactive video interviewing from
home with Webcam hookups, followed by a report on the growing recogni-
tion of interview variations in a global marketplace. The conclusion is a
wealth of interview formats that you may encounter.
Part II: Backstage Researching 
and Rehearsing
In this part, I show you how to explore the backstage preparation that drives
interview success. You learn how to research employers, understand job tests,
negotiate salary, overcome stage fright, look smart with questions you ask, say
the right things before you leave an interview, and evaluate a job offer.
Part III: Actors’ Studio: Casting 
Your Character
Are you a new graduate getting ready for your debut career interview and
concerned about coming across as a clueless beginner? An experienced
person who feels miscast and wants desperately to change careers? A job-
search veteran whose presentation persona may need a touch of recasting? I
show you how to tailor your interviews for job offers, whether you’re a
rookie, career refugee, or prime-timer.
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! 
Answering Questions
How should you deal with the heart and soul of the interview: the questions?
Turn to this part to find out. Here you get an advanced-level education in a
ShowStopper’s response to each major question employers are almost certain
to ask. The answers are presented in a long-story-short style that puts you out
in front of a competitive chorus.
Part V: The Part of Tens
In these short chapters, I present quick surefire tips on how to get invited to
the post-interview VIP employment party, as well as an irreverent group of
statements that superstars of history might have made on a job interview, if
they’d had one. I also run down some of the personality types who might be
on the other side of the interview desk.

Introduction

Icons Used in This Book
For Dummies signature icons are the little round pictures you see in the mar-
gins of the book. I use them to focus a searchlight on key bits of information.
Here’s a list of the icons you find in this book:
This icon reminds you that prior preparation prevents poor performance on
stage.
You see this icon beside moves or lines that leave ’em clapping. It translates
to critical acclaim for what you do or say.
This icon flags news you can use that you won’t want to forget.
Bravo! This icon heralds star-quality lines and moves that prompt job offers.
A bad review for a poor performance, this icon signals situations in which
you may find trouble if you don’t make a good decision.
Advice and information that can put you on award-winning pathways in your
interview follows this icon. It tips you to interviewing best practices.
Where to Go from Here
On the stress scale of life, job interviewing ranks with making a speech before
500 people when you can’t remember your name or why you’re standing in a
spotlight at a podium. The spot where you start in this book depends upon
your present needs:
 If you have a job interview tomorrow, quickly read Chapter 1 for an
overview. And do jiffy research by going to the employer’s Web site and
getting as much basic information as you can. Don’t forget to read the
press releases.
 If you have a few days before you’re on deck for an interview, read
Chapter 1, and then flip through the Table of Contents to the chapters
dealing with your most pressing concerns.
6
Job Interviews For Dummies, 3rd Edition 

 If you have plenty of time, read the book from cover to cover. Practice
recommended strategies and techniques. After you master the informa-
tion in these pages, you have a special kind of insurance policy that pays
off for as long as you want to work.

nterviews are theater, and in this part, I start off by
showing you how that’s true and what it means for
your role in an interview — giving you the rundown on
interviews from rehearsal to curtain call.
This part also gives you the details about where inter-

re you on edge about that big job interview in your future? Try putting
unnamed fears to rest by anticipating the worst thing that can happen
to you. Among unappealing scenes are these possibilities:
A. Blowing the interview and feeling like a total loser for days after stumbling
and mumbling your way through the ordeal.
B. Feeling glued to a hot seat as they beat the answers out of you and 
realizing that you’re going to be sick if you don’t leave immediately.
C. Slip-sliding as you come through the door, physically falling on your
good intentions (hey, this is a PG–rated guidebook), and losing all hope
of leaving behind a professional impression.
Situations A and B are common. Even C isn’t unheard of. Perhaps you saw 
the video of Miss USA taking a tumble and bottoming-out as she made her
grand entrance in a recent Miss Universe competition. It happens to the
loveliest of us.
Still worried? Exhale. You’ve come to the right book. Take the suggestions 
to heart that I offer within these pages and horror situations A and B won’t
happen to you. As for your odds on situation C, that’s between you and your
inner-ear balance.

This work is dedicated to making sure that nothing you can control goes
wrong. I offer proven tips on how to take the duck tape off your mouth, dry
off your sweaty palms, and step out into interview spotlights with a quality of
confidence you never thought could be yours. Dim the lights and raise the
curtain on your quest for a new gig.
Interviewing Is Theater
Job interviewing is major furniture in the employment drama. Because it’s
the do-or-die step in the difficult process of getting hired, leading career
coaches spend the majority of client-coaching time on interviewing drills.
Once you’re inside an office and engaged in an interview, your entire future
may rest on how successful you are in presenting yourself to a stranger
across a desk in 15, 30, or 60 minutes.
These self-presentations have been described as everything from school final
exams to mating rituals, but here’s the real secret:
Job interviews are show biz. Like reality shows on TV, interviews are based
on reality but in fact are staged. And, as in reality shows, only one survivor
beats out the competition to win the prize.
The most successful interviews require solid preparation to learn your lines.
At each meeting, your goal is to deliver a flawless performance that rolls off
your tongue and gets the employer applauding — and remembering — you. 
And because interviewing is show biz, you’re allowed to have some fun 
learning your stagecraft.

Actors teach law students how to act
Actors and acting coaches are showing up in law
school classrooms to coach students at law
schools across the nation on story-telling, posture,
tongue-twisters, and how to establish rapport with
clients, according to one of them, the University of
Dayton in Dayton, Ohio.
The theatrical simulation programs not only teach
students how to sharpen verbal interviewing
skills but give them insight into how their man-
nerisms, listening skills and even posture may
affect the people they are trying to work with and
influence.
At the end of the semester, the future legal
eagles receive a DVD for job interviews that
shows them in action.

Why “Be Yourself” Can Be Poor Advice
A scene in the movie Children of a Lesser God reveals a speech teacher (William
Hurt) and a deaf janitor (Marlee Matlin) duking it out in a jolting battle of wits.
In a climactic verbal battle, the janitor signs to the speech teacher, “Let me
be me,” to which the speech teacher replies, “Well, who the hell are you?”
There is no answer.
The troubled janitor isn’t the only one who has trouble with that question. The
bromide — “Be yourself” — is very difficult to articulate with consistency. Be
yourself? Which self? Who is the real you? Our roles change at various times.
Your role: Job seeker
Jerry is a father, an engineer, a marathon runner, a public speaker, a law stu-
dent at night, and a writer of professional papers. Will the real Jerry please
stand up?
Jennifer is a loving daughter, the best salesperson in her company, a pilot, a
tennis player, and a football fan. Will the real Jennifer please stand up?
Jerry or Jennifer could duck the which-self question by asserting unchangeable
inborn traits: I am the same as my feelings. If I suppress or alter my urges I am
being untrue to myself. I am not being authentic.
Wrong! Shuck the superficial thinking. If you enjoy improving yourself, isn’t that
a form of “being yourself”? Remember too that each of us has all kinds of urges,
some of which are lofty and admirable while others are base and unattractive.
Don’t make the mistake of pretending you’re stuck with one identity — that’s
not who you are.
Who you are at this particular time is a person playing the role of job seeker.
The stranger across an interviewing desk is playing the role of interviewer.
Playing the role most appropriate to you at a given time, and playing it effec-
tively enough to get you the job you deserve, isn’t dishonest. To do less courts
unemployment — or underemployment.
When you give a ShowStopping interview performance, you aren’t being phony.
You’re simply standing back from the situation and looking at it with dispas-
sionate eyes, seeing which type of information and behavior is likely to result
in a job offer and which is likely to leave you out in the cold. You can’t do so if
you are too busy staying true to your most easily assumed self-identity.
13
Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!

Outtake: Forget about being “natural”
What about being natural? Isn’t natural better than artificial? Not always. Is
combed hair natural? Shaved legs? Trimmed beard? Polished shoes? How
about covering a cough in public? Or not scratching where you itch?
Being natural in a job interview is fine as long as you don’t use your desire to
be natural as an excuse to display or blurt out negative characteristics.
Never treat a job interview as a confessional in which you’re charged with
disclosing imperfections and indiscretions that don’t relate to your future job
performance.
Nor should you treat a job interview as social dialogue in which you share
cultural, sociological, political, sexual, or other viewpoints. Don’t download
your personal beliefs on interviewers in the name of “being yourself” or
“being natural” — or, for that matter, “being honest.”
Society cannot survive totally natural behavior. Neither can your unrefined
behavior survive at job interviews. To really know someone in a brief
encounter of 15, 30, or 60 minutes is simply impossible — even when you
repeat that encounter multiple times. How can you compress a lifetime into
15 to 60 minutes? You can’t, unless you present your biography with the
same 30-seconds-per-story speed that television news uses to cover the 
state of the world.
Instead of real life, each participant in an interview sees what the other par-
ticipant(s) wants seen. If you doubt that, think back: How long did you need
to really get to know your roommate, spouse, or significant other?
If you insist on being natural, an employer may pass you over because of your
unkempt beard, unshined shoes, or because you don’t feel like smiling that day.
The price for ignoring self-improvement is too high. All the things you’ve
done to date — your identification of your competencies and skills, your job-
lead management, your resume, your cover letter — are pointless if you fail
to deliver a job interview that delivers a job offer.
New Faces, New Factors in Interviewing
Are you having trouble staking out your future because you can’t close the
sale during job interviews? This mangled proverb states the right idea:
If at first you don’t succeed . . . get new batteries.
14
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Recharge yourself with knowledge of the new trends and changing develop-
ments that impact your job interviews. For the one-minute reader, here are
highlights of contemporary happenings.
Expect new kinds of interviewers
If the last time you trod the boards of job interviewing you went one to 
one with a single interviewer, usually a white man or woman, get ready for 
a different set of questioners, like these
 A veteran team of six managers — individually or collectively
 A hiring manager (especially in technical and retail fields) who is two
decades younger than you
 Someone of another color or heritage
Turn to Chapter 5 for a broader picture of group interviews, and to Chapter 17
for a good tip on interviews with younger bosses.
Watch for new calls for a fast start
Because you can’t count on being on the job more than a few years — or, 
in contract assignments, a few months — the hiring spotlight lasers in on
competencies and skills you can use from Day One. The question is: What 
can you do for our company immediately?
You can come across as ready to blast off if you do enough research on the
company’s goals (increase revenues, reduce costs, acquire new market share,
land larger accounts, create a technical breakthrough), think about how you
can help the company reach those goals, and are ready to speak the insider
jargon of the industry.
If the job you’re applying for isn’t at the professional or managerial level,
research the nature of the company’s business, assume that it wants to make
or save money, and stock up on a few good words used in the industry.
Scope out more ways to show your launch speed in Chapter 2.
Find out about the new way to meet 
Although the video interview has been tried since the 1970s without becoming
a mainstream hiring technique, it may work this time around because the
15
Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!

tools to do it are better than ever. Webcams attached to computers make it
easy and cheap for an employer and job seeker to see and talk to each other
no matter where each is hanging out — around a block or around a globe.
A surge of video interviews is expected to supplant the familiar phone screen-
ing interviews (discussed later in this chapter and also in Chapter 5). Other
“vids” will be used as substitutes for traditional fly-in meetings to avoid the
expense of physical travel.
Get your technology lift in Chapter 3.
Focus on fitting in
Disappointed job seekers who ask employers why they didn’t get hired are
often told they aren’t the best “fit” for the job. Fit? What exactly does “fit”
mean in employment? That question seems to be on more lips than ever as
some seemingly well-qualified people don’t receive job offers while others
who are less qualified are welcomed aboard.
In the workplace, “fit” essentially refers to how an individual fits into a com-
pany’s culture. Company culture is expressed in the values and behaviors of
the group, which forms a kind of “tribe” or, to use an analogy from high
school, an “in crowd.”
The culture typically flows from company or department chieftains: If the boss
wears long sleeves, you wear long sleeves; if the boss shows a sense of humor,
you show a sense of humor; if the boss works until 6 o’clock, you work until 
6 o’clock.
An expert consultant on the inner workings of workplace fit, Mark A.
Williams, further explains the concept:
“Fit is the elusive match between your profile and that specific combination
of unspoken and informal social, behavioral, and cultural criteria unique to
every organization. By answering questions such as who do I feel comfortable
with? and who seems most natural in the role? or who’s most likely to blend into
our culture? your next employer will determine who gets the job.”
When you’re given the not-the-best-fit-for-the-job rejection, the reason is
 A convenient short and legally safe answer
 A cover story, or
 The hiring decision makers perceive that you won’t fit in well with 
the “tribe.”
16
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

When the reason really is the fit issue, decision makers may think you can do
the job but that you won’t do it the way they want and, furthermore, they just
don’t feel at ease with you.
Rather than lose sleep over a fit-based turn-down, move on. Do better pre-
interview research. At least you won’t waste time on companies well-known
for being a fortress of round holes when you’re a square peg.
Bone up on fit and corporate culture in Chapter 6, and in Mark A. Williams’
book, Fit In! The Unofficial Guide to Corporate Culture (Capital Books, 2007).
Cut out the loyalty oath
Answers to certain questions are pretty much the same year after year, but
watch out for one humdinger requiring a new response: Why do you want to
work here? The old “I’m looking for a home and I’ll be loyal to you forever”
statements don’t play as well as they once did.
Companies typically no longer expect that you will stay with them forever —
nor do they want you to. They may not even want to see your face a year 
from now. Doing the math, managements don’t want to have to deal with high
health insurance and pension costs. Many employers now solicit contract
employees — no muss, no fuss in getting them out the door when a project’s
finished, or when a decision is made to outsource the work.
Rather than pledge eternal fidelity, talk about your desire to do the work. 
Talk about how you are driven to funnel substantial amounts of productivity
into the job quickly. Talk about wanting to use your superior technology skills.
Talk about your interest in work that excites you, work that matters. Talk about
work that — with its combination of work-life balance and stimulating tasks —
is too tempting to pass by.
But fidelity? Pass on that as a theme song; it won’t make the charts.
Stock up on what you should say instead of talking about loyalty in Chapters
18, 19, 20, and 21.
Revisit the dramatic pause
In face-to-face live interviews, allowing a few moments of silence to pass,
pausing to look at the ceiling or glance out an open window — taking time 
to think — can make you look wise and measured in your response. Pauses
17
Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!

can raise the ante by reflecting disappointment in a salary offer. Pauses can
suggest that you’re reluctant to travel 50 percent of the time but you’re a
team player and will consider the requirement.
.
A pause is effective body language and works great in live face-to-face 
interviews. But today’s interviewer may call on a telephone or use online
video interviewing where dead air time can make you appear dull-witted
rather than contemplative.
Moral: Exercise judgment in using the reflective pause as a communications
tool. (When you just don’t know the answer immediately, that’s another
story; stall by asking for clarification.)
Rely on Chapter 3 for details on video body language and Chapter 8 for salary
negotiation.
Polish your storytelling skills
Behavior-based interviewing is said to predict future performance based on
past performance in similar situations. The behavioral interviewing style is
not new but it seems to be more popular than ever.
Advocates of the behavioral style claim that it is 55 percent predictive of
future on-job behavior, compared to traditional interviewing at only 10 per-
cent predictive. The reasoning is “If you acted a certain way once, you’ll act
that way again.” Hard proof of this claim is hard to come by. But, for you as 
a job seeker, it doesn’t matter the least bit whether the claim is true or false.
The behavioral style is such a big deal with employers today that you need 
to know how to use the style to your advantage.
It works like this: Interviewers ask candidates to tell them a story of a time
when they reacted to such and such a situation. How did you handle an angry
customer? Can you describe an example of a significant achievement in your last
job? The more success stories you can drag in from your past, the more likely
those interviewers using this approach will highly rate your chances of achiev-
ing equivalent success in the future.
Read more about behavior-based interviewing in Chapter 5.
Learn new lines for small-business jobs
Have you grown up professionally in a large-company environment? If so,
carefully consider the answers you give when applying to small companies.
That could happen sooner than you think if you’re forced into an involuntary
18
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

change of employment. Prime-timers in countless droves are discovering that
the small company sector is where the action is for them.
Emphasize different aspects of your work personality than those you empha-
size when interviewing for a big company. Interviewers at big companies and
small companies have different agendas.
Among the reasons that owners of small ventures reject former big-company
people are these stereotypical perceptions: People who come out of Big
Corporate America often are though to be
 Unaware of the needs of small business
 Too extravagant in their expectations of resources and compensation
 Too spoiled to produce double the work product their former jobs
required
 Unwilling to wear more than one job hat at a time
 Deadwood, or they wouldn’t have been cut loose from the big company
Chapters 17, 19, and 21 can help you with this issue.
Get ready for the global job interview
For professional jobs, the basic format of interviews globally is Western-style
accomplishment-oriented, but cultural interviewing differences among nations
still matter. Newcomers to the United States may be surprised to learn, for
example, that they aren’t expected to dress up in pinstriped suits to interview
for a technology job, nor are they encouraged to speak extensively of family
and other personal issues.
Americans who hope to work overseas for the first time may be surprised at
such local customs as those of China, where interviewees are expected to nod,
showing that they’re listening and understanding the Chinese speaker who is
communicating in English, or of certain European countries where a female
candidate might be asked directly, “Are you pregnant?”
Chapter 4 tackles the emerging body of buzz about international interviewing.

Amplify your preparation for top billing
Preparation makes all the difference in whether you get the best offers as 
you face intense scrutiny, probing questions, and employers who are afraid of
making hiring mistakes. You must show that you’re tuned in to the company’s
needs, that you have the skills to get up to speed quickly, and that you’re a
hand-in-glove fit with the company.
Fortunately, never in history has so much information about companies and
industries been so easily accessible, both in print and online.
Chapter 6 gives tips on researching your audience.
Distinguish screening from 
selection interviews
As hiring action is concentrated increasingly in smaller companies, the separa-
tion between screening and selection interviews fades, and the same person
may do both types. But traditionally, here’s how the types, which I cover in
Chapter 5, differ.
Screening interviews
In large organizations, interviewing is usually a two-stage process. A human
resource specialist screens out all applicants except the best qualified. The
screening interview is frequently handled by telephone or online video inter-
views rather than in-person. Survivors are passed to a manager (or panel of
managers) who selects the winning candidate.
Screeners are experienced interviewers who look for reasons to screen you
out based on your qualifications. Screeners can reject, but they cannot hire.
They won’t pass you on to hiring managers if your experience and education
aren’t within the specifications of the job.
When you’re being interviewed by a screener, be pleasant and neutral.
Volunteer no strong opinions. Raise no topics, except to reinforce your quali-
fications. Answer no questions that aren’t asked — don’t look for trouble.
But do remember smile to a lot. You’re in your close-up.
Selection interviews
By the time you’re passed on to a hiring manager or panel who makes the
selection, you’re assumed to be qualified or you wouldn’t have made it that far
along the channels of employment. You’re in a pool of “approved” candidates
chosen for the selection interview.
20
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

At a selection interview, move from neutral into high gear if the person doing
the interview will be your boss or colleague. No more bland behavior — turn
up the wattage on your personality power. This is the best time to find out
whether you’ll hit it off with the boss or colleagues or fit into the company
culture.
Verify early what they want 
and show how you deliver
Almost as soon as you’re seated, ask the interviewer to describe the scope of
the position and the qualifications of the ideal person for that position.
You’ve already done this research when you’re going for ShowStopper status.
Use this question to confirm your research. If you’re wrong, you must know
immediately that you need to shift direction.
If you’re dealing with multiple interviewers, direct your question to the
senior panel member and wait for an answer. Then gaze around the group
and ask, “Does anyone have something to add to the description?”
Confirming your research or gaining this information on the spot is the key to
the entire interview. This technique permits you to focus on the factors upon
which the hiring decision is made, without taking verbal detours that don’t
advance your candidacy.
Take the steps described in Chapters 2 and 5 to hit marks that show you’re it!
You’re the one.
Connect all of your qualifications 
with a job’s requirements
If a quick glance at your notes reminds you that the interviewer missed a
requirement or two listed in the job posting when describing the position’s
scope and the ideal person for it, help the interviewer out by tactfully bringing
up the missing criteria yourself. Keep it simple:
I see from my notes that your posting asked for three years of experience. I
have that and two years more, each with a record of solid performance in —
Your purpose in doing this is to demonstrate that you take this job possibility
seriously, an attitude that the employer will applaud. Winning job offers by 
targeting your interview performance to a company’s requirements is a logical
follow-up to the resume targeting strategy that I explain in my book Resumes
For Dummies, 5th Edition (Wiley, 2007).

Check out additional information about presenting yourself as the logical hire
in Chapters 2 and 18–22; additionally, depending on your status, get must-
read advice in Chapters 15, 16, or 17.
Master a one-to-two-minute 
commercial about yourself
Almost certainly you will be asked to respond to some version of the “Tell me
about yourself” question. You’re not helping yourself if you respond with the
kind of question a 13-year-old might ask: “What do you want to know?” That
approach makes you sound unprepared and naïve.
Instead, memorize a short description of your background (education, 
experience, and skills) that matches your strengths to the job.
After briefly relating the facts of your background, add a sentence or two
about your curiosity, commitment, and drive to build mountains atop your
already good skills base. A few well-chosen words enliven a dry recitation of
facts with a splash of your personality.
Simply follow the techniques that I give in Chapter 18.
Seal the deal with a branding brief
Personal branding is becoming known for something — Jon Stewart for political
satire and Tiger Woods for golf, for example. You don’t have to be famous, just
consistent in your efforts to develop your brand. Your personal brand develops
along with the buzz about you — good or bad, your professional reputation,
and how you’re distinguished by characteristics and achievements — all 
salable distinctions in the marketplace.
Try to perfect a branding brief that tells your “story” — one that rolls off your
tongue — in about 20 to 30 seconds, or in 100 words or less:
After I graduated from San Diego State University, I worked in the insurance
industry until I took a break to start a family. That accomplished, I went
back for refresher education and now, thoroughly updated, I’m looking for 
a new connection in either the insurance or financial fields.
A branding brief may also be called an elevator speech, personal branding
message, or profile summery. By any name, you can use this summary with
networking contacts to obtain an interview, or you can use it inside an inter-
view (in your closing statement, for instance). Additionally, a branding brief
22
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

can be included as part of your longer one-to-two-minute commercial that I
describe earlier in this section.
Find more ideas on preparing a branding brief in Chapter 18.
The difference between a commercial and a branding brief is length and 
content. A commercial is longer and more inclusive of details than is a cut-to-
the-chase branding brief.
Win two thumbs up from the hiring 
manager and you’re in!
As I discuss earlier in this chapter, given a choice of technically qualified appli-
cants, employers almost always choose the one they like best. Despite the best
efforts of supporters of “scientific” interviewing techniques to eliminate hiring
by mutual chemistry, the vast majority of experts continue to say that more
people lose job offers for personality factors than for lack of capability.
The psychological principles involved in winning friends and influencing
interviewers have been around since the pharaohs ran the pyramid projects.
For your purposes, remember this one:
We like people who are like us.
How do you encourage the interviewer to think “you and me against the
problem” rather than “you against me”?
Beyond pleasantries, mutual interests, connecting with eye contact, and
other well-known bonding techniques, watch for special opportunities:
 Suppose your interviewer looks harried, with ringing telephones 
and people rushing about interrupting your talk. Flash a sympathetic
smile and commiserate: It looks like you’re having one of those days. The
subtext of your comment is I understand your frustrations. I’ve been in a
similar place. You and I are alike.
 Or suppose you’re showing a work sample. Ask if you can come around
to the interviewer’s side of the desk to discuss your sample. You are
looking at it “together.”
Forget about age, color, gender, or ethnic background. Do whatever you rea-
sonably can to make the hiring manager believe the two of you are cut from
similar cloth.
To rewrite the famous 20th century Broadway wit and playwright Damon
Runyon:
23
Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!

The part goes not always to those we like, nor the hiring to our twins, but
that’s the way to bet.
Pick up still more intel about the value of likeability in growing job offers in
Chapter 2.
Allow interviewer to direct the improv
Some job search advisers seem to suggest that you take charge of the inter-
view, directing the discussion in your favor. Not such a hot idea. Wrestling the
interviewer for control can easily backfire when you appear to be usurping
the interviewer’s prerogative. As they say in show biz, you’re stepping on the
director’s lines.
But what to do when a big void exists in what you’re being asked to relate? The
answer is the question. You can ask many variations of the “Would you like to
hear about X?” inquiry and get your story told without seeming to take charge.
Chapter 11 reveals how to look good with questions you ask.
Show sensitivity for the hiring manager’s
dislike of interviewing
From supervisors to top executives, hiring managers tend to see interviews
as encroachments on their already impossibly busy schedules. But they
know they have to conduct them.
Suggest follow-up interviews be done on weekends or during the evenings 
to take the pressure off the interviewer’s prime business hours.
Verse yourself in ways to make a hiring authority be glad he took time away
from other duties to interview you; see Chapter 25.
Try not to talk money until 
you know they want you
When the salary question comes up at the beginning of an interview, say 
that money isn’t your most important consideration — nor should it be at
this point.
24
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Admittedly, stalling salary talk until a better time is much more difficult today
than it was a decade ago. But you should be holding out for the market value of
the new job, not settling for an inadequate figure of your present or previous
employment.
Only when you know the scope of the position and its market value — and that
the company wants to hire you — are the stars in alignment to bargain in your
best interest.
Read Chapter 8 for in-depth guidance on salary negotiation.
Take Home an Oscar from Any Interview
Rookie? Prime-timer? Clerk? Chief executive officer? No matter. You can do
exceptionally well by following certain performance routines that succeed 
in any interview scene. Some of these suggestions are basic and familiar, but
most people who haven’t been on the interview tour for awhile can use the
reminders. 
Sing “I really, really like you!”
A likeable, relaxed, friendly smile carries you a long way on a carpet of good-
will: You seem like an agreeable person, and everyone likes to work with
agreeable, sunny people. By the time you’re invited to meet the decision maker,
the employer has probably put you through a screening interview and believes
you’re qualified to do the job. Now the decision maker’s question is: Do I like
being around you?
When you find that you and an interviewer have something in common —
perhaps by noticing sports trophies or pictures in the office — comment on
it. You’ll seem affable and likable. People rarely hire someone they don’t like.
Soak up opening moves that make interviewers see you as an agreeable
person in Chapter 12.
Style your body language
Interviewers observe everything about you: not only your dress and inter-
view answers, but your body language, facial expressions, posture, carriage,
and gestures. If you’re a rookie, think dignity. If you’re a prime-timer, think
25
Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!

energy. In between? Watch political candidates on TV for hints of what looks
good and what doesn’t.
Confirm that your body language is sending the “hire-me” message with tips
in Chapter 10. Chapter 9’s up-to-date data on dress and appearance add even
more non-verbal firepower to your candidacy.
Be a treat: Act upbeat
Steer clear of negative words (such as hate, don’t ever want, absolutely not, or
refuse). And avoid such risky topics as the knock-down, drag-out fights you had
with that bonehead you used to work for — never knock the old boss. Your
prospective new boss may empathize with your old boss and decide to never
be your boss at all.
Chapters 7 and 16 throw more light on avoiding a maze of negativity and
looking as though you are a serial complainer who will never be satisfied.
Start your interview off on the right foot
Some advisers say that the first five minutes are the critical period of your
job interview; others say that your window of opportunity for acceptance is
only during the first 60 seconds. Why take a chance on who’s right? Here are
four tips to help you make a good impression right off the bat:
 Find out in advance what to wear (see Chapter 9) and where the interview
site is located. Make a trial run if necessary.
 Be on time, be nice to the receptionist, read a business magazine while
you’re waiting, and — surprise, surprise — don’t smoke, chew gum, or
otherwise look as though you lack couth.
 Develop a couple of icebreaker sound bites, such as comments about 
a nice office, attractive color scheme, or interesting pictures.
 Don’t sit until you’re asked or until the interviewer sits. Don’t offer to
shake hands until the interviewer does.
During the interview, use the interviewer’s name (but never use a first name
unless you are old friends) frequently. And remember to make a lot of eye
contact by looking at the bridge of an interviewer’s nose. (Divert your gaze
occasionally, or you’re perceived as more creepy than honest.)

Track down more suggestions for making yourself a memorable candidate in
Chapter 12.
Remember that you have a speaking part
Communication skills are among the most desired qualities employers say
they want. Answer questions clearly and completely. Be sure to observe all
social skills of conversation — no interrupting, no profanity. Just as you
shouldn’t limit yourself to one- or two-word answers, neither should you try
to cover your nervousness with surround-sound endless talking. Aim for a
happy medium.
Take in Chapter 18 for a savvy start on how to talk about yourself.
Agree to take pre-employment tests
No one likes those annoying pre-employment tests. Job seekers keep hoping
they’ll drop off the face of the earth but they’re with us still. When you want
the job, you’re going to have to suck it up and test when asked. No test, no job.
Race to Chapter 7 for survival clues when you hope to be the last one standing
after test time.
Flesh out your story beyond 
a college degree
Education is a fulcrum for movement throughout your career but relying on it
alone to pull you through a competitive job search is a mistake. The mistake
grows larger with too many mentions of an illustrious alma mater, assuming
that the school’s marquee power is a hall pass to move forward.
For example, a couple of mentions of Harvard in an interview are plenty; inter-
viewers get it the first time. They wonder whether the Harvard background is
the singular “accomplishment” a candidate offers.
Instead, spell out your accomplishments with true examples — what you
learned and what you can do with your degree that benefit the employer.
27
Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!

In marketing a three-dimensional you, think of your education as one dimen-
sion; your experience as a second dimension; and your accomplishment
record as a third dimension. All are important.
Wait. Back up. If the interviewer is also a Harvard grad, three mentions is 
perfectly okay. And if three is good, maybe four or five is better.
Chapter 5 is headquarters for storytelling tips; Chapters 18-22 show you how
to fill in the blanks for your campus experience and beyond.
Bring a pen and notebook with you
Making a note here and there is advisable, as long as you don’t attempt to
record a transcript. To illustrate, you need to jot down reminders to get back
to the interviewer when you can’t answer a question from memory.
Brownie point: Writing down what someone says is flattering to the speaker. 
Keep your ears up and your eyes open
Don’t just sell, sell, sell. Take time to listen. When you’re constantly busy
thinking of what you’re going to say next, you miss vital points and openings.
So work on your listening skills. When you don’t understand an interviewer’s
question, ask for clarification.
Observe the interviewer’s moves. Watch for three key signs: high interest
(leaning forward), boredom (yawning or glazed look), or a devout wish to end
the interview (stacking papers or standing up). After assessing where you
stand with the interviewer, take the appropriate action:
 High interest suggests you’re stopping the show and should continue.
 The remedy for boredom is to stop and ask, Would you rather hear more
about (whatever you’ve been talking about) or my skills in the ABC area?
 When the interviewer is ready to end the meeting, first ask if the inter-
viewer has any reservations about your fit for the job; if so, attempt to
erase them.
And then go into your interview closing mode (Chapter 13). Gain a sense
of timing and keep the door open for a follow-up contact by asking three
questions: What is the next step in the hiring process? When do you expect
to make a decision? May I feel free to call if I have further questions?

Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!
Fighting back on interview exploitation
You can lose your intellectual property through
abuse of the job interview. 
In the so-called performance interview for pro-
fessional and managerial jobs, candidates are
required to prove themselves with projects that
demonstrate on-job skills, problem-solving capa-
bilities, and communications abilities.
The employer asks for a proposal of how you would
handle a company project or requests that you
design a process the company can use. You’re told
to be ready to “defend your ideas” at the interview.
Unfortunately, sometimes the free-sample demand
is incredibly time-consuming (say 80 hours) and
costly ($200 and up in materials and research). You
do your best but suppose you don’t get the job? In
an example of shoddy ethics, your work samples
may be given to the victorious candidate who then
steals your viable creative ideas. In the following
sections, I give you a few examples from stung
readers of my newspaper and Web column.
Portfolio scam
When applying to an advertising agency for a
copywriting job, the owner asked me to leave my
portfolio for review. He kept the portfolio and
called on all the clients whose work was shown
in the portfolio! Since then, I always respond to
requests to leave or send my portfolio with this
statement: “I need to be there to clarify the work
shown. I will be glad to bring it, and we can 
discuss my work at your convenience.”
State government rip-off
When I applied for a significant and highly symbolic
job with my state government, I was informed I had
been selected but had to go through the formality
of an interview with a key aide to the governor. 
As requested, I took materials and a plan for
approaching the job’s goals to the confirmation
interview. A long, official silence followed before a
form letter arrived stating that a less-qualified pro-
fessional, to whom I was a mentor, had won the
position. The victor showed me the state’s plan of
action: mine.
Consulting caper
My husband, an expert in human resources,
spent two long days interviewing in a small
town with the owner of a family company and
his son. He gave them an unbelievable amount
of advice and information to help their meager
HR program, process management, and inte-
grated product development. All we got out of
that was reimbursement for a 200-mile car trip,
a bad motel, and meals. That was our first real-
ization of how small businesses in particular get
almost-free consulting work.
Training trickery
I was a candidate for a city’s new training 
division chief. I had to spend several hours in
the city’s computer labs designing programs
and leaving them on CDs. I knew that with my
education and experience, I had done well. 
A long-term firefighter with zero training expe-
rience got the job with the city and used my
materials for new employees!
Protecting Yourself 
How do you avoid abuse without taking yourself
out of the running for a job you want when
you’re not sure about the real interview
agenda? Here are two ideas:
 You can copyright your plan and place a valid
copyright notice ©, along with the publication
date and your name, on its cover as an indi-
cation of your underlying claim to ownership.

When Interviewers Chase You
When you’re hot, you’re hot — but even then the essential dynamic of a hiring
episode is immutable: The employer has to be sold on you before a job offer
will be yours to accept or reject.
Leverage is the ability to decide the outcome in a situation when you control
what someone else wants. In job searching, leverage is your ability not just to
get a job, but to get a job on your own terms.
Until a job offer materializes, until your deal moment actually clocks in, stay on
message in the selling of your qualifications for the position. It’s much easier
on the ego to reject an offer than to be left standing at the starting gate.
You find the tools to decide whether you should accept or pass on a job offer
in Chapter 14.

Needs to Know, 9th Edition, by Stephen
Fishman (Nolo Press; www.nolo.com).
 You can bluff, hoping to create a theft deter-
rent by slapping a copyright notice and 
“Confidential — Property of (Your Name)”
on your plan’s cover.
When you’re desperate or really, really, really
want the job but don’t have the time, inclination,
or money to respond in full measure, offer
something like this:
I’m glad that you see I have the brains and
talent to bring value to your company. I’m
happy, too, that you have the confidence
in my work to ask me to handle such a
potentially important solution to your mar-
keting challenge. With my background, I’m
sure I could do an outstanding job on this
assignment. But you do realize, I hope,
that such an important project would
require 80 to 100 hours of intensely
focused work. I’d enjoy doing it, but, quite
frankly, I have several other job interviews
scheduled that I really can’t shift around.
Do you think a sample of substantially
smaller scope would serve as well for your
purposes?
With a statement like this, you
 Remind the interviewer that you’re a top
candidate
 Promise superior results
 Bring a reality check to a sensitive inter-
viewer about what’s being asked of you
 Let the interviewer know others are inter-
ested in you
 Propose to do much less work until a job
offer crosses your palm
You can, of course, flatly refuse to part with
advance goodies. In a seller’s market, you’ll prob-
ably be considered anyway. But in a buyer’s
market, the likelihood is that you’ll be passed over
when you decline to turn in a hefty free sample.

Building Lifetime Confidence
This first chapter serves as an overview for the entire book. The remainder of
these pages is wide and deep with the details that can help you gain a lifetime
of confidence in your ability to sail through reality-show interviews and
receive the best job offers.
31
Chapter 1: Job Interviews Are Reality Shows. Really!
Surviving a snippy interviewer
Short of taking out a restraining order, what should
you do when an interviewer’s manner is offensive?
That depends upon who’s doing the talking. When
the interviewer is the person who would be your
boss, be certain that you’re not misunderstand-
ing intent. If conversation really is disrespectful,
bail out unless you want to spend most of your
waking hours dealing with a difficult person.
Show class. Just say “Thank you for your time. I
don’t think this job is a good fit for me.” (Payback:
It may leave the interviewer regretful that you’re
the good one who got away.)
But when the interviewer is doing preliminary
screening, give the employer the benefit of the
doubt by assuming that the interviewer doesn’t
represent the entire company and will be working
five floors below you in a subbasement. Here are
a few coping techniques:
 Smile and make a light remark: “Oh, do you
think so? That bears watching.”
 Respond with a two-second non-answer,
and then quickly ask a question: “That’s an
interesting observation. It reminds me to
ask you what role would the person in this
position play in the new company product
launch.”
 Pretend the rude remark is a dropped call
that you didn’t hear, pause, and talk about
your accomplishments or skills.
 When an interviewer keeps interrupting or
contradicting you, look puzzled and ask for
clarification. “Perhaps I’m not following you
correctly. Could you please restate the
question or explain what you mean by — ?”
When all else fails, remember the words of
English writer Joanne Kathleen Rowling, author
of the Harry Potter books: “Yet, sadly, acciden-
tal rudeness occurs alarmingly often. Best to
say nothing at all, my dear man.”
Winning candidates are memorable
Comparing American Idolwinners to job interview
candidates, Phoenix career coach Joe Turner
(www.jobchangesecrets.com) says it’s
the total package that counts. “You don’t have to
be the best singer, just the most remembered
decent singer. Same for the job interview. You
don’t always have to be the best candidate with
the top skills. You do have to find a way to be the
most remembered hirable candidate.”

Chapter 2
Tailoring Your Qualifications for
Targeted Job Interviews
In This Chapter
 Matching your qualifications with job requirements
 Adding drama to your qualifications
 Recouping with compensatory responses
N
ew television shows used to get an entire season to catch on with 
viewers before being bounced to TV’s boneyard, but these days they’re
lucky to snare an eight-week schedule to prove their popularity.
Similarly, job tenure, once gold-watch eligible, today is often reduced to pro-
ject-oriented employment that may end after fewer than three years. That’s
the word from Paul Hawkinson, legendary editor-in-chief of The Fordyce Letter,
the third-party recruiting industry’s premier newsletter.
Drawing on Hawkinson’s deep recruiting industry knowledge in a telephone
interview, I asked him: How does shorter job tenure affect interviewing 
strategy from the job seeker’s side of the desk? His answer illuminates the
enhanced value of today’s targeted job interview. (A targeted job interview
demonstrates that you have the skill qualifications that the job requires.)
“Employers now want three things: skills, skills, and skills,” Hawkinson
explains. “They want immediate ramp-up by new hires. They want people
who don’t need break-in time. They want productivity and performance from
Week One.”
“In fact,” Hawkinson continues, “employers are so focused on connecting the
right skill sets to the job for a fast start that I joke about not being surprised
if one day new employees are hired by parts numbers and bar codes tattooed
on their heads.”

Hawkinson’s amusing explanation of the intense interest that employers have
in effecting a fast start for new hires may explain why neither he nor I hear
much these days about a once-popular recruiting philosophy: Hire for attitude
and train for skill — the belief that what people know is less important than
who they are. A somewhat different and almost opposite philosophy seems 
to be emerging: Hire for skill and pray for attitude.
Connecting the Dots: Showing 
You’re the Right One
As I explain in my book Resumes For Dummies, 5th Edition, sea changes have
taken place over the past several years that affect who gets interviewed and
why. The outdated all-purpose resume is being replaced by the targeted
resume that is tailor-made for a specific employment goal. A targeted resume,
by addressing a given opportunity, makes it easy for an employer to see how
your qualifications are a close match to a job’s wish list and want to meet you
in person.
The identical strategy applies to your interview: When you’re in a room with
an interviewer, try to make it easy for the interviewer to believe that you
have all (or nearly all) of the skills and attributes that the interviewer is
trying to recruit for the position. Emphasize that you meet the specs — point
for point.
Susan Joyce, CEO of Job-Hunt.org, explains the concept of matching point 
for point this way: “Employers react favorably when you connect the dots
showing that you can deliver almost all of the abilities and results that
they’re asking for.”
34
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 
Good vibes are always welcome
In this chapter I urge you not to assume a decision
maker is aware that your qualifications are a
strong match for the job’s requirements. People
forget, they become distracted, or they may not
get the message from preliminary interviewers. 
So you have to tell them again to be sure your
message is delivered. But while skills are critical,
they aren’t all it takes to get hired.
Personal chemistry (motivation, personality, style,
energy, attitude, and so forth) and fit in the work-
place’s culture are important decision factors 
as well.

Presenting Your Qualifications 
in a Targeted Interview
While reflecting on how best to illustrate the ins and outs of a targeted job
interview, I had a light-bulb moment. Why not step outside familiar career
fields — engineering, retailing, financial services, and so forth — to shake
things up a bit with a make-believe movie script of an interview in the high-
adventure field of deep sea diving in dangerous waters? Although the lyrics
will be different in targeted interviews in familiar fields, the music’s the same
in all career fields.
I began thinking about deep-diving professionals after reading a newspaper
story about the work of Scott Cassell of Escondido, Calif, (www.sea-wolves.
com). Cassell is arguably the world authority on the Red Demon (Giant
Humboldt Squid) that man eats as calamari — that is, unless the 
calamari eats him first.
Admittedly, the fictional script that follows isn’t a white-hot page turner, but I
hope you find it an interesting and novel introduction to the targeted interview.
Hunt for Red Demon: The screenplay
FADE IN
Contemporary kitchen of thirty-something couple. Todd Turner, the leading
man in this screenplay, is sitting at a table reading his laptop screen. In good
physical shape, Todd obviously works out. His attractive wife Susan drinks
orange juice. Todd swings his laptop screen toward Susan calling it to her
attention.
TODD
Suze, look at this posting.
Susan crosses over to look and we see these words on the screen:
Need ace underwater camera operator to lead shoot of feature film: Hunt

Squid, also known as Red Demon. More dangerous than sharks, these

Are you going to apply? You have 14 years of diving experience but you have
only 4 years of film camera work. And just last week you explained to me that
now it’s a big deal to focus on how you offer the qualifications that match a

requirements?

Yeah they are, but you bet I’m going after this one. And although I only have 
4 years of film experience, I’ve got 11 years of videocam experience. They
should see that combo as equivalent — heck, more than equivalent! I’m going
to call right now to set up an interview.
INT. FILM STUDIO PRODUCTION OFFICE — LOS ANGELES — DAY
Our POV is from the back of interviewer Ralph Russo’s head as we see Todd
walk through the door with a smile on his face. Todd is wearing a custom-made
suit of chain mail and aluminum panels over his wet suit.
RALPH
Please be seated . . . if you can. That’s, uh, an unusual suit . . . custom-made
for diving, I suppose.
Scott struggles somewhat comically to slide into the chair and finally succeeds.
The interviewer and Todd share a chuckle, bonding.
TODD
I hear you’re a diver yourself so you’d know that Scott Cassell is the one 
who first came up with this one-man armory. You’re right; this protection is
specially made diving gear that’s saved my life more than once. After a close
call with a hungry Humboldt, I had one custom-made.
RALPH
I’m glad you recognize that those Humboldts are dangerous creatures. Our
research team says that they’re typically 3 to 7 feet long but can be as long as
14 feet and weigh more than 700 pounds.
TODD
That’s what I thought, too, but I saw a video showing a mammoth Red that’s
estimated to be 54 ft. I wouldn’t be looking forward to doing a tango with that
fish. I’d rather go down Moby Dick’s gullet.
36
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Ralph holds up a half dozen storyboards with Giant Humboldts making a grab
for a fisherman’s boat oar and points to them.
RALPH
I think audiences will come to see this action and adventure thriller. Those
suckers have eight muscular arms and two feeding tentacles —– like a sharp
parrot’s beak — that they use to attack their prey with more than 40,000
needle sharp teeth at once! That’s gotta hurt.
Nodding to agree, Todd looks directly into Ralph’s face as he continues.
TODD
Absolutely, I take those fish seriously. They don’t just nibble when they grab
you and pull you way down; they shred you! They’re trying to eat you in tiny,
delicate pieces! I’m told that fisherman in Mexico would rather fall into the
water with a feeding frenzy of sharks than Humboldts. I’m well aware of the
danger. I carry my own insurance but you can never have too much coverage
in this business. Health-wise, I’m certain that I’m insurable for your film.
RALPH
That’s great. As you know, insurance is not optional. If we come to terms, I’ll
ask you to get a quick physical for the insurance people. Concerning another
must-have, I see on your resume that you’ve had lots of diving experience . . .
you want to elaborate on that?
TODD
Sure. I was a rated commercial diver at 18. I’ve been diving ever since — 
14 years. And of course, I’m fully licensed and certified. Never had a problem
or accident.
RALPH
What about camera work?
TODD
I’ve been doing underwater film for four years — but wait (holds up hand like
traffic cop) I’ve also got 11 years of deep water videography. In fact, I’ve got
some samples with me, including a short documentary that plays periodically
on TV. Can we take a look at them now? I think you’ll agree that I meet every
single one of your requirements — diving and camera experience, licensing,
insurable, and as you can see from my “uniform” I’m a cautious guy who
knows how to stay alive while I’m getting the shot.
37
Chapter 2: Tailoring Your Qualifications for Targeted Job Interviews

RALPH
I can’t argue with those facts, Todd. You’re right on the money. I assume that
you brought along street clothes?
Todd nods “yes.”
Then why don’t you change and then we’ll walk over to Projection and look
at your film and videos. Do you work with an agent?
Telling your qualifications 
tale, again and again
In the preceding section’s screenplay, Ralph Russo the interviewer was a
screener, checking out Todd’s credentials and bona fides before passing Todd
on to others, probably the producer and director of Hunt for Red Demon.
The passing of Todd up the food chain (sorry, too bad to resist) raises a 
question: Do you need to tell everyone at a company who interviews you
how your qualifications are a close fit with the competencies and skills that
the company’s trying to bring aboard? Although doing so seems repetitive,
don’t assume everyone knows that you’re a handsome hand in a groovy
glove. You may have to repeat yourself several times — if you can do so 
without sounding like a broken Blu-ray disc.
Interviews for professional and managerial jobs typically stretch over two 
or more meetings, as I describe in Chapter 5. Your qualifications for an open
job generally are vetted in the first, or screening interview, which likely is
conducted by an HR representative. This interviewer can screen you out of
the candidate pool, or if you’re a qualified candidate, pass you up to the next
level: the selection interviewer.
The selection interview(s), usually conducted by the manager to whom you
would report, may assume you’re qualified or you wouldn’t have been passed
on to a decision maker. The hiring manager tends to be more interested in
how you would fit in with the others on the manager’s team.
But sometimes, especially with technical candidates, the hiring manager
wants to make sure your qualifications are right on target. Perhaps the hiring
process stretched out over weeks, even months, and the hiring manager has
to an extent, forgotten what you offer, failed to read your file from HR, or just
needs reassurance that you can do the job.
38
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Be alert for signs in a selection interview that you need to shore up the hiring
manager’s appreciation of your matching skills and experience. You can do it
with a simple question technique: “I noticed that one of the requirements
you’re after is experience in construction project management in foreign
countries. Would you like to hear about my office park experience in France?”
Making Up for Missing Qualifications
Suppose you anticipate connecting the dots and come up a requirement or
two short. What not to do is stand there looking as though you came to the
wrong address, shake your head, and admit “I don’t have experience in the
hotel field” and shut up.
When you can’t connect every dot, give a compensatory response.
Compensatory responding means staying on the stage by offering a 
substitute qualification when you lack a specified qualification in the job
description. Compensatory responding doesn’t always work, but it works
often enough to make the effort.
In the above example of lack of experience in the hotel field, after you say 
“I haven’t worked at a hotel,” add a compensatory response: “But I do have
experience in the restaurant field, and I know a good deal that is common to
both of these related hospitality industries. Both fields need employees who
are experienced in providing attentive customer services, careful accounting
and financial processes, and quality materials supplies. Do you agree that my
experience is relevant to the requirements of this position?”
Another example of a compensatory response is in education. Suppose 
the job requirement is a specific education credential that you don’t happen
to have, such as a bachelor’s degree in business administration with an
emphasis on marketing. Don’t automatically raise the issue, but if it comes
up, or if you must show that you’re a qualified candidate, explain that 
you have the equivalent qualification by virtue of alternate education, such
as a bachelor’s degree in psychology, and/or experience, such as campus
marketing experience promoting school events.
I discuss a number of other questions and suggested answers to help you 
size up well in a measure of the job’s requirements in Chapters18–22.
Research improves your odds even when you’re not a perfect 100 percent
match for the job. Why? Because you’ll be talking about topics that the
employer wants to talk about — job requirements identified as those needed
to solve the employer’s problems.
39
Chapter 2: Tailoring Your Qualifications for Targeted Job Interviews

Just as no one’s perfect, your work and education history won’t match up
point for point with the requirements set out in every job interview you
attend. And there will be times when despite diligent research and planning,
you just can’t come up with a compensatory response that makes sense. Yet,
despite these factors, you have persistent and realistic feeling that you can
handle the job. What can you say on the spot to plug the hole in your history?
When you’re up against a rigid requirement that you absolutely can’t meet and
that you’re pretty sure is going to mean curtains for you in the interview, try
this last-ditch compensatory response:
Let’s say that you were to make me an offer and I accept, what can I do
when I start to further compensate for my lack of [requirement] as I work
hard to relieve your immediate workload?
Essentially, you’re playing the likeability card. You’re asking the employer to
revert to the philosophy of hiring for attitude and training for skill. You’re
using the likeability qualification to plug your requirement gap. 
As Paul Hawkinson observes “Likeability is a factor that can turn the tide in
your direction. Although skill level and applicable experience trumps at the
beginning of the interview process, I’ve seen dozens of less-than-qualified
people hired because the employer liked them better than the perfect 
candidate with the personality of a doorknob.’’
40
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 
When crossover skills miss the connection
Realistically speaking, what are your chances of
success in claiming that you’re a good match to
a job’s requirements on the theory that your skills
transfer from one industry or company size to
another? Sometimes your assertion works like a
charm. Sometimes it doesn’t. The theory of
crossover skills (also called transferable skills)
holds promise only when applied truthfully.
The Fordyce Lettereditor-in-chief Paul Hawkinson
explains: “It’s easier to find a job within the indus-
try where your experience lies. The weapons
engineer with 20 years of experience will find it
difficult to work outside of the defense industry at
the same salary. And 20 years of selling cosmetics
does not prepare or qualify someone to sell indus-
trial equipment.
“Along similar lines, a highly specialized
employee with a very large company just may
not find a market for his or her skills in a smaller
firm where versatility is admired.”
When you’re debating whether your skills trans-
fer and you can do the job, channel Jawaharlal
Nehru, India’s first prime minister: “A theory
must be tempered with reality.” Don’t waste
your time trying to peddle smoke and mirrors in
moving your skills from one venue to another
when it’s a lost cause.

Going Wireless for Your Interview
In This Chapter
 Pairing really fast wireless with cams, phones
 Making the most of your video face time
 Ringing up winning phone interviews
 Glimpsing amazing far-out interviews
A
nd just when you thought that Webcams were chiefly useful for live 
peep shows or for nanny surveillance in homes with wee tots, you dis-
cover that Webcams can be used for job interviews that take place when, for
one reason or another, the interviewer and the candidate can’t physically be 
in the same room. More gee-whiz technology is moving warp-speed into the
interviewing space.
What a jolt! Now that most people have finally become accustomed in this 
digital age to e-mail, camera phones, Web sites, instant messaging, job boards,
resume databanks, online employee referral systems, Web-based talent commu-
nities, job blogs, BlackBerrys, business-oriented social networks, Podcasting,
and iPhones, the next big technological wizardry for job seekers is banging on
our doors, ready for roll-out.
The forces in the driver’s seat of the new wonders are the same ones fueling
the online video industry’s rocket growth overall: high-speed Web access and
cheap technology.

I won’t keep you in suspense: Here’s a heads-up on four major trends that are
likely to soon affect the way you do interviewing business. How soon? Your
guess is as good as mine, but here’s the way the wind is blowing:
 Extreme wireless: An explosive boom in new wireless connectivity, the
cutting-edge technology — said to be 50 times faster than today’s wireless
technology — will carpet the United States in 30-mile stretches, essentially
creating a nationwide hot spot, as well as firing up comparable broadband
access around the globe.
 Webcam bonanza: At the same time that tens of millions of people 
are getting their keyboards on enormous amounts of super-speed broad-
band, cheaper Webcams and smart phones are popping up, permitting
consumers to savor the full Internet experience. People everywhere
already are using free, live, interactive picture-and-voice chats to stay in
touch with new and old friends across the country or around the world.
 Video vogue: The trends of abundant high-speed Web access and
cheaper technology have cleared the way for a burst of growth in online
video interviews that screen candidates for employment. Thus far, most
video job interviews are replacements for the familiar phone screening
interview.
 Global go-go: People, money, and ideas cross borders more freely than
ever, creating an international force sparking interviewing technology. 
(I cover international dimensions in job interviewing in Chapter 4.)
The following segments flesh out the ways video techniques are applied to
job interviewing today and how you can benefit.
42
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 
Video screening saves hiring costs
Why are videos being introduced as employ-
ment screening filters? Beyond the fact that
employers now use video because they can,
companies try to curb time and travel expenses
in their hiring practices. Suppose, for instance,
that a company starts with a pool of 100
resumes. Perhaps a dozen will be moved to the
first-cut pile, from which interviewers make a
round of phone calls. The phone calls reduce
the candidate pool to perhaps six. The surviving
half-dozen candidates move to the next step
and receive video job interviews. From those
video interviewing results, two or three finalists
are invited to an in-person meeting, from which
the victor will be selected. Add zeros to the
numbers in this example and without winnow-
ing controls, recruiting costs soar and company
financial executives get cranky.

Can You See Me Now?
Online videoconferencing has been around for years but until now has 
been used chiefly by corporations with deep pockets for collaborative or 
distance-meeting purposes. That’s changing as traditional videoconferencing
systems are also being used as a cost-effective and logical way for employers
and candidates to meet and greet each other. Locations at which formal
videoconferencing systems are found include the following:
 Corporate offices
 College career centers
 Hotels and airport
 Recruiting and staffing firms
 Public room vendors and brokers
 End-to-end commercial conferencing firms
As a job candidate, never pay for the costs of a video job interview. That
expense belongs to the employer.
Moving away from traditional videoconferencing facilities, some employers 
are engaging video interviewing service firms such as HireVue (www.hirevue.
com) to handle the employment screening process from A to Z. HireVue
records the interview either at a company office or offsite with a Webcam (or
sends the Webcam to the candidate) and provides a tutorial on the technical
aspects of the video interview. Each candidate for the same position is asked
43
Chapter 3: Going Wireless for Your Interview
Casting calls and screening interviews
“Employers conduct screening interviews to
decide whether a prospective employee should
be interviewed face to face. The screening
interviewer seeks to determine appropriate
product background, job experience, compe-
tencies, skills, and if a fit might exist between a
candidate and the company’s corporate culture.
“These factors can be a lot to address in a typical
30-60 minutes screen. Your best strategy to move
forward to the next step in the hiring process is
preparing for a screen as you would for a tradi-
tional one-to-one interview. Because employers
screen to filter out candidates who aren’t up to
the job, that means they are looking for reasons
not to bring in people for interviewing. Don’t be
screened out — prepare!”
Mark S. James, CPC, President and CEO

consultant.com) Career Transition
Coaching

the same questions. Typically a candidate is given 30 seconds to read a ques-
tion and about two minutes to answer it. Hiring managers compare recordings
of the sessions to see how each candidate answers the questions.
In addition to traditional videoconferencing facilities and independent video
interviewing service firms, Webcams at home are the breaking news for job
interviews. The reason is cost and available technology.
In the 1980s, color cameras required studio lighting and maintenance costing
$5,000 to $100,000. Today a basic Webcam runs as little as $25–$30; pretty
good models can be had for $60–$75; and advanced models go for $100–$150.
Laptops increasingly come with Webcams built in. Although Webcams keep
improving and are better than they were, the picture quality isn’t as good as
film, and there’s still a slight audio delay of a second or two, sometimes 
causing a lip-sync lag.
What is a video interview?
Video interviewing (a form of videoconferencing) is a live, two-way electronic
communication that permits two or more people in different geographic loca-
tions to engage in face-to-face visual and audio exchange. Miles separate
them: sometimes few, sometimes many, and sometimes oceans.
In the new Webcam-dominated world, the caller and the person on the receiv-
ing end need only a computer and a monitor, a Webcam, a microphone and
Internet access to do a job interview. Or a more ambitious job interview can
be conducted on more sophisticated equipment, such as a television camera
(rather than a Webcam) and projected on a television screen (rather than on
a computer monitor).
Either way, interviewing skills are front and center in a video version.
The gamut of video interviews
Here’s how the who and how of video job interviews shake out:
 High end means traditional technology and assistance used in permanent
set-ups (like a TV set) in conference centers, corporate offices, and public
rental rooms. High production values typically include costly equipment
and professional staff to handle all technical concerns.
 Mid-level includes intermediate technology outsourced to a specialty
video firm by an employer. The middleman contractor may invite job can-
didates into an office, operate with traditional equipment, or send them a
Webcam to use at home for the interview if the candidate does not own a
Webcam. Video firm staff provides instructions and tips to job candidates.
44
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

 Low end refers to new Webcam technology used directly between an
employer and a candidate who turns a Webcam on himself or herself with
no guidance or technical assistance. This is the category where the vast
majority of job seekers find themselves: raw beginners at technically 
setting up or using Webcams. And after mastering the technical aspects,
video newbies are inexperienced on the performing requirements.
Consider video interviewing as a new skill set to master. If you can afford it,
get video job interview coaching. If not, practice early and practice often,
using friends as interviewers. Study TV personalities for presentation behav-
ior. And read and relish the how-to-do-it suggestions in the upcoming section
“Rock the Video Interview.”
What’s video’s upside? Downside?
Certain advantages and disadvantages of video interviewing are obvious, but
others are sure to turn up as employers and job seekers gain more experi-
ence in using the technology. First, a look at the pros:
 Time-saving: In certain situations, you may get a job faster because 
of video interviewing. Recruiters and hiring managers can conduct first-
round interviews more quickly online using video interviewing than they
can scheduling in-person interviews. Video interviewing is a time-saver
particularly in instances where you can’t easily break away from your
present job to travel to an interview or where several groups of com-
pany executives must weigh in on your hiring but are in different locales;
video interviewing allows several locations to connect at once.
 Convenience: When you’re currently employed, you won’t have to miss
work to interview if you can respond at your convenience.
 Distance-jumping for short-term employment: Video interviewing is a
boon to prospective interns and contract workers who want jobs far
away; a company isn’t going to fly you in for a three-month summer
internship or contract gig but may hire you on the basis of an online
video interview.
 Modernity: Not many candidates have used video interviewing yet. 
If you can show that you take technology in stride (especially if you’re
over 40), you get bonus points. You image as a good fit in forward-looking
companies.
But nothing is perfect. Take a look at some of the drawbacks that video 
interviewing presents:
 Lag time: A lag time occurs when data is compressed and sent from 
one location to another. You have to remember to allow for the delay
and not step on the interviewer’s lines. Additionally, the interviewer may
inadvertently cut you off in mid-sentence.
45
Chapter 3: Going Wireless for Your Interview

 Connectivity: Sometimes the connection isn’t great and you have to
strain to hear what people are saying.
 Lighting: If the lighting is off, you may look too green or pale like a corpse.
 Performance pressure: When it’s your turn to speak up, you have very
little time to look away, down, up, or sideways to process your thoughts.
When the “green light” goes on, the pressure on you is somewhat like a
contestant at a quiz show: talk or walk.
 Learning curve: Being judged in front of a camera takes some getting used
to. Glimpses of awful screen tests of actors who later became famous 
confirm the point. While camera success may be ducks-to-water for a few
people, more typically candidates start out feeling unnatural. Time and
practice make them less so.
Making an on-camera impression
The content of a video interview is much the same as an in-person interview.
But the execution differs. Consider these sample reactions:
 A candidate, a cool 20-something manager who isn’t easily thrown 
off center, told a magazine that his video interview was “kind of nerve-
wracking” and a totally different feeling from sitting in front of someone
for a live interview.
 An employer reported on a comments board that a lot of things don’t
come across the camera and that certain factors are accentuated:
“Posture, dress, comfort with uncertainty, facility with technology — 
all those things get highlighted and bolded during a Web interview.”
Online, you can’t use handshakes and ingratiating small talk as you enter and
leave an interviewer’s office to help imprint favorable memories of you. To
compensate, include a memorable statement — a sound bite. Somewhere near
the end of the interview, an experienced candidate says something like this:
Of the many things I’ve accomplished in my career, (name a top achieve-
ment) stands out as the most significant. Do you see a strong connection
between my favorite accomplishment and what it will take to be very suc-
cessful in this position?
An entry-level candidate can aim to become unforgettable by saying something
unexpected like this:
I know that many employers consider my generation to be lacking in writing
and critical thinking skills and are not pleased that some of us write com-
pany e-mail as if we were texting cell-phone messages with our thumbs.
That’s not me. I’m good with technology but I’m old fashioned. I spell my
46
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

words correctly and include all of the letters. And I believe you will be happy
to know that I use my head when I write — not just my thumb. When can we
get together and speak face-to-face?
Rock the Video Interview
“Companies hiring at all levels, from entry-level to experienced professionals,
are becoming more comfortable using technology (as you can see from the
growth in Internet recruiting) and video interviewing is becoming the next
step in the online recruiting process for many recruiters and employers,”
says Alison Doyle, the author of About.com Guide to Job Searching: Tools and
Tactics to Help You Get the Job You Want (Adams Media, 2006).
Doyle is also the guide for About.com: Job Search (www.jobsearch.
about.com) and a career center manager at Skidmore College in Saratoga
Springs, N.Y. The career expert recognizes that video interviewing can be
intimidating to job seekers:
It’s hard enough to interview face-to-face, let alone in front of a camera and
microphone. It can seem like a scary proposition, even for those of us who
are familiar with technology and use it on a regular basis.
Not to worry. As French Renaissance writer Michel de Montaigne famously
said: “A learned person is not learned in everything but the capable person is
capable in everything.” This section is dedicated to making sure that capable
you are not intimidated when you interview remotely.
Before the interview
As with all interviews, don’t walk in cold to professional videoconference
facilities. And don’t sit down at your desk Webcam unprepared. The following
suggestions brief you on what you should know.
Time limits
Find out whether you’re on a clock for the interview. If the interview is 
scheduled for 30 minutes, consider it a rigid cut-off and don’t plan on 
overtime.
Advance work
Send materials for show-and-tell in advance in case the interviewer wants to
ask questions about an updated resume or project; you can’t slide materials
through the screen.
47
Chapter 3: Going Wireless for Your Interview

Content review
Review potential questions that you’re likely to be asked. (See Chapters
18–25.) Be ready to relate your qualifications to the job’s requirements. (See
Chapter 2.) Memorize examples of accomplishments that illustrate what you
can bring to the company.
Note taking
Making a few notes during an in-person interview is flattering to the inter-
viewer. But the jury’s still out about whether you should take a notebook to
video interviews and jot down points that will help you respond with clarity.
The criticism of note taking is that it is more pronounced and disruptive
onscreen than it is face-to-face. Others disagree, saying that glancing at your
notes may make you seem more conscientious.
Technical check
When you’re not interviewing at home, arrive 15 minutes early at the interview
site to deal with any technical issues that may arise. Request an overview of
the interviewing event and a refresher on the use of the equipment. Ask the
technician how loud you should speak into the mike and how to use the 
picture-in-picture feature that shows you in action.
When you’re using your own video equipment, check your camera angle (set
at eye level), speakers (place out of view), and microphone (set high enough
that you don’t have to keep bending down but not in front of your face).
Appearance
To avoid a contrast issue, you can’t go wrong with solid colors that aren’t too
dark (black) or too light (white, yellow). Although you may see an anything-
goes range of colors on High Definition or digital TV, the technology for the
average computer monitor isn’t yet that advanced.
Additionally, busy patterns distract from your face. So do definitive stripes
and plaids. Watch TV newscasters to form your own wardrobe preferences.
Otherwise, wear the same clothing you would wear to a same-room interview.
(See Chapter 9.)
Background
Plan for an uncluttered look. Eliminate such distractions as too many books,
wall hangings, memos taped to the wall, and so forth. Avoid background
motion — second hands ticking on a clock or cars passing on the street 
outside, for instance.
48
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Dress rehearsal
When you’re interviewing at home, arrange a test interview with a friend. Can
you hear him and can he hear you? Can you see her and can she see you? Is
the framing of your screen about right (head to waist) or is the focus on your
face so tight that every pore looks like a moon crater? Do you remember to
lock up the family cat so it doesn’t leap into the picture and to send the kids
outside to play so they don’t walk behind you?
Record yourself to see how you’re coming across on camera. This tip, more
than any other, will improve your interviewing performance.
During the interview
You’re almost prepared to command the screen. Now review these finer
points gleaned from others who have gone before the cameras before you.
Movements and posture
Calmness is classy and shows confidence. No way should you check your
personality at the door, but do try to be fairly still. Smooooth. Avoid overly
broad gestures — you’re not directing traffic. Ration your gestures to under-
score important information.
Microphones have an irritating habit of picking up all the noise in the 
room. Don’t shuffle papers or tap a pen. Noises that you may not notice in 
a same-room interview can become annoying in a video interview.
Occasionally glance at the picture-in-picture feature on the monitor to check
your body language and hope you don’t catch yourself scratching, twisting
your hair, or jangling your keys. Slouching and other bad-posture sagging
make you look even worse on those small screens than they do in person.
Facial expressions and speaking
The first thing you say is Hi, I’m John Gill. Nice to meet you. (And if you’re not
John Gill, use your own name.) Speak normally, but not too fast. When nervous,
some people don’t stop for air, and their best lines are left on the cutting room
floor, unheard or not understood.
Be conscious of a sound delay. A couple of seconds will lapse between the
interviewer’s statement or question and when you hear her or him. At the
end of an interviewer’s words, pause before you reply. 
49
Chapter 3: Going Wireless for Your Interview

Look directly at the camera as often as possible when speaking. You can look
around occasionally but avoid rolling your eyes all over the room as though
you can hardly wait to make your getaway. Some people look down at the
desk. Don’t, especially if you have a bald, shiny spot on the top of your dome.
And don’t bend over the microphone. Imagine that the interviewer is sitting
across the table from you.
The three most important things to remember in a video interview are (1)
smile, (2) smile, and (3) smile. Have you noticed that even when reporting
disasters of nationwide proportions, TV anchor people don’t always wipe the
smile off their faces? Why do you suppose that is? Smile!
Virtual handshake
Unless your interview space is on fire, it’s not your prerogative to end the
interview. Always allow the interviewer to indicate when time’s up. In cases
where the interview format is controlled by a technician, you’re given signals
to close it down.
Since you can’t shake hands through a monitor, at the end of the interview,
deliver a sign-off statement indicating you understand that the interview is
over. You can say something as simple as Thank you for interviewing me. I
enjoyed it. Let’s talk face to face very soon.
For other sign-off ideas, review Chapter 13, and check out Chapter 14 to be
prepared if lightening strikes and you’re offered the job during the video
interview.
When you’re in a professional setting, push the mute button and leave the
room. When you’re at home, mute the mike and close the camera.
When You’re on the Phone
Mobile phones (a.k.a. cell phones) have exploded into the world’s ears in less
than a quarter of a century. About 80 percent of the world’s population has
mobile phone coverage now, a figure projected to jump to 90 percent by 2010.
The mobiles have progressed from rare and expensive status icons used by
corporate suits in the early 1980s to today’s common and low-cost personal
possessions used by everyone. Mobile phones worldwide now number more
than 2 billion, outnumbering land-line telephones in many nations. In the
United States, some young adult households have cell phones and aren’t 
sure what you’re talking about when you mention land-line phones.
Massive numbers and rapid adoption seem to be only the beginning of the
secret life of cell phones. Today’s smart phones can be used for two-way

videoconferencing. Exactly when this killer application will be applied to job
interviews is unclear. In the meantime, the telephone, wireless or tethered to
land lines, continues to be a popular and powerful audio medium for conduct-
ing screening interviews.
Hold the phone
Almost everyone knows someone who’s been contacted by a recruiter for 
a screening interview (see Chapter 5). In looking for reasons to rule you out,
recruiters home in on your possible lack of qualifications for the position.
They ask about your experience, skills, competencies, education, your incon-
venient geography, and whether your financial requirement is too low or too
high for the job’s predetermined compensation range.
Sometimes recruiters purposely try to catch you off guard, hoping surprise
strips away the outer layers of your preparation, exposing genuine, unre-
hearsed thoughts and feelings. Recruiters also see unanticipated calls as
useful for measuring your ability to think on your feet.
Because most people don’t prepare for screening phone interviews as rigor-
ously as they prepare for face-to-face meetings, the casualty fallout is heavy.
When the caller is trying to reduce the list to a few finalists, expect a future
hang-up on your candidacy if the screening call doesn’t go well.
If you don’t like surprises, take the steps I outline in the upcoming sections.
Keep your phone well-stocked
Stash one phone in a quiet room stocked with all your interview essentials.
Must-haves include
 Current resume
 A list of professional accomplishments
 Background information on the employer
 Questions about the company and position
 Outlines of brief stories that illustrate your qualifications, competencies,
and problem-solving abilities
 A calendar, with all scheduled commitments and open dates
 A notepad, pen, and calculator
 Water and tissues

Chapter 3: Going Wireless for Your Interview

Make phone appointments
Whenever possible, don’t answer questions on the fly when the call comes in.
You won’t be prepared and you won’t do your best. Schedule an appointment
for your phone interview. Say that you’re walking out the door to a meeting
across town and will call back as quickly as you can:
Thank you for calling. I appreciate your attention. I’m very interested in
speaking with you about my qualifications. Unfortunately, this is not a good
time for me — I’m headed out the door. Can I call you back in an hour?
If a recruiter insists on calling you back rather than the other way around, 
do what you would do for any other interview: Be ready early as a reminder
to interview as a professional. Change out of your jeans and into the type of
dress you’d wear in a business meeting. Most importantly, treat the call as an
overture to an in-room meeting.
Project a winning image
When the call comes, heed the following suggestions, most of which 
come from Mark S. James, a leading executive career coach (www.
hireconsultant.com).
 If you have a home office, use it. An office just feels more businesslike.
You may find it helpful to face a blank wall to eliminate distractions of
gazing out a window or spotting dust on your favorite painting.
 Gather essential information. At the start of the conversation, get the
caller’s name, title, company, e-mail address, and phone number. Read
back the spelling.
 Market yourself. Assume the role of “seller” during the interview. If you
sell your skills and abilities effectively, the listener sees value in bringing
you in for an interview.
 Strike the right tone. Be enthusiastic but don’t dominate the 
conversation.
52
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 
Phone interviewing when you’re at work
If your current employer doesn’t know that
you’re looking for a new job, close the door and
speak to the interviewer for only a couple of
minutes, asking the caller if you can set up an
in-person interview right then — or if you can
talk in the evening when you’re at home.

 Have an answer ready. Be prepared to answer the “tell me about your-
self” request early on; keep your answer to two minutes.
 Ask smart questions. Demonstrate industry knowledge by asking “intelli-
gence” questions: The industry seems to be moving toward [emerging
technology]. How does your company plan to compete?
 Don’t rush or drone on. Speak clearly and be aware of your pace — not
too fast, not too slow. Don’t ramble or over-explain. Keep your answers
short and succinct; if the interviewer wants more information, she’ll 
ask for it.
 Use check-back phrases. After answering a question, you can add such
follow-on phrases as Does that answer your question? Have I sufficiently
answered your question about my managerial experience? Is this the kind
of information you’re seeking?
 Be a champion listener. Prove that you’re paying attention by feeding
back what the interviewer says: In other words, you feel that — . Interject
short responses intermittently to acknowledge the interviewer’s 
comments: That’s interesting . . . I see . . . Great idea.
 Get specific. Describe your ability to benefit the company by using spe-
cific dollar amounts and percentages to explain your past accomplish-
ments. Let them know how you did it.
 Divert important questions. Tickle interviewers’ interest by answering
most of their questions. Then, when they ask a particularly important
question, give them a reason to see you in person. Tell the interviewer
that you can better answer that question in person:
That’s an important question — with my skills (experience) in _____, it’s
one that I feel I can’t answer adequately over the phone. Can we set up a
meeting so that I can better explain my qualifications? I’m free on Tuesday
morning — is that a good time for you?
Decide beforehand which questions can best be put off. You can use this
tactic two or three times in the same conversation.
 Punt the salary question. Phone screeners often ask you to name an
expected salary. Play dodge ball on this one. You don’t know how much
money you want yet because you don’t know what the job is worth. You
find more techniques to avoid premature salary talk in Chapter 8.
 Push for a meeting. As the call winds to a close, go for the prize:
As we talk, I’m thinking we can better discuss my qualifications for (position
title) in person. I can be at your office Thursday morning. Is 9:30 good, or is
there a better time for you?
Another statement:
(Interviewer’s name), based on the information you have given me, I am
very interested in pursuing this work opportunity and would like to schedule
a time for us to meet in person. What looks good for you?
53
Chapter 3: Going Wireless for Your Interview

When the interviewer agrees but can’t set a specific time, simply suggest
when you are available and ask when would be a good time to follow up.
Remember, what you want is an in-person meeting. Assume you’ll get it
and give the interviewer a choice as to the time.
 Say thanks. Express your appreciation for the time spent with you.
 Write a thank-you letter. Just because the interview was via phone
doesn’t negate the wisdom of putting your thanks in an e-mail. Make it 
a sales letter restating the qualifications you bring to the position.
Which Way to the Future?
Technology and globalization are drastically changing not only how people
do their jobs, but how they get them. The following three examples are based
on real and existing technology. Do they describe the future of job interviews
in the 21st century, or are they merely fun and games?
Have your avatar talk to my avatar
An avatar is an animated graphic character; you see them wandering around
on Web sites, such as www.secondlife.com, a computer-based virtual
world, which has held an avatar job fair in which real companies interviewed
job seekers.
Job seekers designed any kind of avatars they wanted (hair color and cloth-
ing) and sent their characters to each company’s virtual office, where they
shook hands with avatar recruiters. The avatars with winning ways during
the interviews were invited to a face-to-face, non-avatar interview. No word
on how many candidates are being hired through avatar interviews.
Holy hologram: I see right through you
Remember back to Star Wars when robot R2-D2 projected the hologram 
of Princess Leia screaming “Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi; you’re my only hope.”
Holograms are no longer a galaxy far, far away. Researchers at the University
of Southern California have developed a 3D holographic display where three-
dimensional images can be viewed from 360 degrees. Can you imagine future
online interviews where the computer monitor is a hologram? In the future,
you may be conducting interviews with a whole new viewing angle. Of
course, you can see through holograms like ghosts with today’s technology.
Today a hollow head, tomorrow a fully fleshed-out body.
54
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Don’t dare lie: Your mind is an open book
I’m not making this up: A team of top neuroscientists in Germany and
England say they have discovered technology to look deep inside people’s
brains and read their intentions before they act. (Browser search online for
“The brain scan that can read people’s intentions.”) So much for trying to
keep your thoughts to yourself.
The neuroscientists claim that high-resolution brain scans aided by special
computer software can identify patterns of activity that flags lying and 
violent behavior. Does this mind-reading machine actually work? One test
resulted in an impressive 70 percent accuracy rate. The obvious first usage 
of the modern truth-telling marvel is the interrogation of criminal suspects. If
the mind-peeping technology passes what is sure to be a firestorm of ethical
concerns, what’s next — brain scan plans for job interviews? Imagine this
somewhere in tomorrow’s employment norms:
Please come in and talk with us about our open position. And oh yes, sign
this waiver agreeing to stand brain-naked before our interviewer.

Chapter 3: Going Wireless for Your Interview
Video: Resumes are not the same as interviews
Despite vendor-driven drum-beating for video
resumes, the overwhelming majority of profes-
sionals in the employment field whom I inter-
viewed cite two major problems that video
resumes will have to overcome if they are ever to
become widely adopted, as well as a third prob-
lem that additional experience and familiarity with
the medium may resolve.
The first hang-up is that reviewing video resumes
(rather than online or paper resumes) is a time
monster. Far too much time is sucked from the
schedules of busy recruiters and employers to
make watching visually-enhanced job resumes
an efficient use of their talents.
The second issue: Companies worry that video
resumes will invite lawsuits by candidates who
claim bias based on race, gender, or age — which
may be unrevealed on digital resumes but revealed
on video. “Anything that shows upfront that a job
seeker is old, fat, or ugly is a risk,” says HR expert
Jim Lemke, this book’s technical reviewer.
A third disqualifying factor is that most home-
produced video resumes are amateurish and
don’t show off the candidate to best advantage.
The video resumes most likely to succeed, recruiters
tend to believe, are those featuring candidates in
performing and creative fields. 
The paramount difference between video
resumes and video interviews is control. The job
seeker controls the video resume; the employer
controls the video interview.

Interviewing on the World Stage
In This Chapter
 Looking at interviewing makeovers around the globe
 Spreading Western employment practices to other cultures
 Getting guidance for continuing cross-cultural differences
U
nited States. Germany. France. United Kingdom. Kenya. United Arab
Emirates. South Africa. China. India. Australia. Russia. Mexico. Norway.
Spain. Turkey. Japan. Philippines. Brazil. These and many more far-off places
may be a workplace destination for someone on the wing — perhaps you.
A flow of workers has always moved among the world’s developed nations. But
today’s employment practices make that international exchange of talent more
vigorous, speeded-up by look-me-over technology that includes interviews by
e-mail, land-line phones, airline flights, and, coming soon, interactive online
video interviews and the ubiquitous wireless phones I describe in Chapter 3.
Changing the Global Interviewing Game
Old-style job interviewing for foreign nationals is getting an update, too.
Interviewing styles are no longer as tightly bound to the customs of individual
and disparate nations as they were only 15 or 20 years ago. Back then, job
interviewing customs between cultures could be strikingly dissimilar — a slight
bow upon shaking hands was attractive in German interviews but not in British
interviews, as a single example. Times change. Germans no longer automati-
cally bow upon introduction.
What’s driving the homogenizing of interview practices across much of 
the planet? In a word, modernization. Western-style employment practices,
sparked especially by American-based multinationals, are narrowing variances
in how candidates are interviewed and evaluated in many countries. Studies
show that employers everywhere want all job seekers to have technical knowl-
edge in their fields, and they look for cross-cultural adaptability for those who
are foreign-born.

Employers in workplaces ranging from the United States to India and the
United Arab Emirates to South Africa want you to show them that you can
competently do the jobs, and preferably have done the jobs, that they’re
trying to fill. That’s why the interviewing strategies I present throughout this
book are widely applicable almost anywhere for mobile professionals in the
global workforce. That’s the word from Jim Lemke, this book’s technical
reviewer, who has worldwide travel and work experience.
Lemke’s day job is in human resources management for one of the world’s
largest microfinance organizations. As he hires professionals for the organiza-
tion’s offices in 28 developing countries, Lemke sees the homogenizing inter-
viewing model up close: “Companies such as Nestle, Barclays, Coca Cola, and
Cisco are all looking to expand in developing countries and need bright, young
professionals with Western training who have the required work qualifications
and who know how to present themselves.”
Another career expert, Dr. Ron Krannich, who closely monitors the global
workforce, agrees that with the exception of small- and medium-sized compa-
nies, especially those outside the major cities, today’s employee selection
interviews are looking more alike than unalike:
“The world’s employers increasingly expect to see the ‘sales’ model that
Americans use in job interviewing. I use the term to mean confidently empha-
sizing positive accomplishments about you rather than making neutral or nega-
tive statements. But here’s an important caveat: Be careful not to come across
as overly aggressive in nations that are traditionally more accustomed to low-
key interviewing styles,” says Dr. Krannich, who heads Impact Publications
(www.impactpublications.com), an international publisher of career and
travel books.
Looking at Remaining Cultural Norms
Although poles-apart interviewing styles are in decline, that trend doesn’t
mean they’ve disappeared entirely. They haven’t. For example, although busi-
ness wear is the uniform for professional candidates interviewing in India, a
few women continue to apply for work wearing a native form of dress, the sari.
So going with the flow of cultural expectations in a country other than your
own can still be a tense, waiting-to-exhale experience.
Take handshakes, for example. In the United States, a healthy grip as you
pump hands is considered a friendly and straightforward gesture for women
as well as men. But in Saudi Arabia, unmarried men and women do not touch,
a cultural issue that presents a dilemma for a Saudi woman candidate being
interviewed by a male in America. Handshaking isn’t a big problem for women
in Muslim and many other non-Western countries because in those places it’s
not a basic part of a job interview.
58
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Making eye contact is another point of difference that survives between cul-
tures. When interviewing in the United States, you’re expected to make a lot
of eye contact showing honesty and sincerity; failure to look your interviewer
in the eye can be perceived as a sign that you are evasive or lying. In Latin
America, too much eye contact may suggest a lack of respect or a challenge
to authority.
If you’re a professional worker who hopes to add far-off places to your resume,
it’s never too early to begin planning your moves. There’s plenty to plan. Aside
from the myriad considerations stretching from education and experience
qualifications to legal documents allowing you to join another nation’s work-
force, think through what you must do to convince a foreign interviewer that
you “get” the host country’s culture and that you fit right in.
Interviewing Across Cultures
To jump-start your understanding of cross-cultural interviewing norms, here
are generalized observations about conditions you may encounter in far-off
interviews. The following verbal snapshots are a starting point for your further
research aimed at understanding specific mores in individual nations, regions
of the country, and individual companies:
 Important protocol variations: Find out in advance how much interview-
ing formality to generally expect in a particular nation before moving on to
pinpoint research about the region and the company. The tone of the inter-
view may be more or less formal than you would expect at home. Joking
in an interview is risky in your own country but in another land you may
seriously offend if the interviewer interprets your humor as a sign that
you won’t take the work seriously or that you’re a superficial clown.
 Personal questions and privacy: In the United States, laws discourage
privacy-penetrating questioning that may lead to discrimination (see
Chapter 24). However, employers in a number of nations have no qualms
or legal restrictions about asking personal questions of candidates.
Understand in advance that you may be expected to answer questions
about your age, health, or marital status.
 Critical language skills: Language fluency is a main component of cross-
cultural adaptability for professional employees. Inability to speak the
language or understand accents is going to prove an almost insurmount-
able obstacle to being hired. (Consider taking a menial or unpaid job for
a year, as well as taking lessons, to improve you language skills before
applying for professional jobs.)
English is the lingua franca of international commerce and you may be
able to stick with it to be hired in some countries, but, in most cases,
59
Chapter 4: Interviewing on the World Stage 

you’ll get greater approval by speaking the local language, bad grammar
and mispronounced words notwithstanding.
 Self-promotion American style: Americans are taught to “sell” not 
tell when interviewing for employment, to emphasize accomplishments
and minimize shortcomings. Making the best case for being hired is the
self-marketing strategy and tactics I advise throughout this book. But in
some cultures, being too assertive in tooting your own horn is perceived
as being nervy, brash, and brazen. In those cultures that prefer an under-
stated performance, employers may want you to volunteer only the
skeleton facts of your education and work history, such as previous
schools, previous employers, years of employment, job titles, and
responsibilities.
 Appropriate dress and grooming: Although local conventions in dress
and appearance continue to impact how candidates dress for interviews
in a number of countries, most professionals now dress in suits or other
business wear. The default mode is conservative. Employers in fashion-
conscious European nations, such as France, Spain, and Italy, especially
appreciate interview attire that shows business savvy and worldliness.
(For interview dressing in the United States, Canada and many other
Western nations, see Chapter 9.)
Tracking Down Country Research
Develop a job search plan for each country of interest. The plan should include
foundation research you need for most interviews (see Chapter 6). Add to that
base and customize it with information about cultural subtleties for each target
country, region of the country, and potential employer of interest. Because
hiring customs in the world’s nations are still evolving, seek the latest data by
researching online and by networking your way to people in-country.
International Web sites
The following Web sites provide information for your cross-cultural job
search:
 Going Global (www.goinglobal.com; note there is only one “g” in 
the middle of the address): This site offers country-specific, annually
updated interviewing advice for 30 countries. Visit the site’s home page
where you can use the Quick Search feature (upper right hand side of
the page) to find information on interviewing in individual countries. A
sample content page for each country is free; you can download the
country’s entire guide of about 85 pages for under $20.
60
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

In addition to for-fee country guides ordered by the general public, you
can read the information for free if you have access to any of the some
300 libraries and university career centers around the world that sub-
scribe to the Going Global service. These institutions are listed on the
Going Global Web site.
 Job-hunt.org (www.job-hunt.org/international.shtml): This site
contains a list of international job resources that are most useful for job
postings, but you can mine the resources for country-specific interviewing
intelligence.
 Transitions Abroad (www.transitionsabroad.com): This site offers
magazine articles and books about working, studying, traveling, living
and volunteering in countries other than your own. Selected articles are
free but others are available only if you subscribe to the magazine.
Additionally, the site contains a blog called the Wide World Café.
International social networking 
Reaching across national borders and oceans to get country-specific inter-
viewing tips wasn’t a practical approach a dozen years ago. Today tapping into 
personal and professional online networks to discover the rules of the road in
foreign interview rooms is easy. A bit time-consuming but easy. Here are a few
suggestions about tracking interviewing conventions the digital way. A market-
ing professional who wants to work in Denmark would take the following steps:
1. Start with contacts you already have.
Your contacts know people you don’t know and their contacts know
people they don’t know, and so on. Send a brief e-mail message to each
contact stating your desire to prepare for a job interview in Denmark.
61
Chapter 4: Interviewing on the World Stage 
Questions that probe expat expectations
Employers of expats (expatriates) of any nation
are likely to ask questions about your ability to
adjust and function in a foreign setting. Can you
be happy in an unfamiliar place without becoming
homesick? What if your spouse and children hate
the place and flee back home? If you can’t stand
the climate, will you pack up and leave within
several months? Survival questions to expats
may be direct or implied as the following exam-
ples show.
Are there any factors that might limit your
ability to take on this assignment, such as
health or your family situation?
Are you realistic about living overseas and
working under different conditions? How
about in developing nations where the living
isn’t as easy and convenient as back home?
How do your spouse and children view 
this assignment — are they on board?

Say that you would appreciate it if the recipient is able to lend any of the
following kinds of assistance:
• To help you directly or to forward your message to one of their con-
tacts in your quest for knowledge about the interviewing protocols
and customs common in Denmark.
• To help you arrange a more substantial informational interview
with a resident of Denmark who, like you, is a professional or busi-
ness person. In an online informational interview, whether by e-mail
or two-way videocam, ask a series of questions you write out before
the interview. Remember, you are exploring only typical job inter-
viewing in Denmark at this informational interview — not every
aspect of the job or employment there. You can, of course, arrange
for a follow-up interview if your Denmark contact is agreeable.
2. Check out professional member organizations in the field of work you
seek, such as the International Association of Marketing Professionals.
Post your request for assistance for current information about interview-
ing protocols in Denmark for your profession on a forum, chat room, or
blog. You probably have to be a member of the organization to access the
organization’s site.
3. Try popular business-oriented social network tools.
Conduct a keyword search on a site such as LinkedIn (www.linkedin.
com) or Xing (www.xing.com). Use a term relevant to your objective —
say, “Denmark corporate marketing” or “Denmark human resources” or
“Denmark manager” — to see whether you can connect with LinkedIn 
or Xing users who could prove helpful by providing the latest inter-
viewing information.
Preparing for the Global Job Interview
Whether your interview takes place in a glamorous, cosmopolitan city or a
little-known town on the slopes of a mountain or in your home bedroom on a
cell phone, the secret to your global search success is preparation and prac-
tice. In addition to getting the country-specific environment right, you still
have to sell yourself as an ideal candidate for the position you seek. Chapter
5 catalogs the types of interviews you may encounter as you move on up in
your life.

 Technique and interview forms that shape your participation
 Location where the interview takes place
Mastering Interviews by Objective
Interviewers set up different kinds of meetings for different reasons, as the
leading player in the following story illustrates:

A woman with a dog was leaving a movie theater when a reporter stopped her
and said, “I’m sorry to bother you but I was amazed that your dog seemed to
get into the movie so much. He cried at the right scenes, yawned during the
ho-hum spots, and laughed his head off at the funny parts. Don’t you find that
unusual?”
“Yes,” the woman replied. “I find it very unusual, considering that his objective
in coming here was to find out whether the movie was as bad as the book!”
I run down interview objectives in the upcoming sections.
Screening interview
Interviewing is a two-stage process in large organizations. The two stages 
are screening and selection. Screening precedes selection.
The purpose of screening — or first-cut interviews — is to weed out all 
applicants except the best qualified. Live (in-person) interviews to screen
applicants typically are held at the employer’s work site, independent
employment services, college career services, and job fairs.
Interviewers increasingly rely on technology — such as telephone and Webcam
(video online) interviews — to screen applicants. (Turn to Chapter 3.) They
use the technology as cost-cutting moves to help assure that candidates aren’t
underskilled and overpriced before their companies invest too much time 
talking with them at length.
The screener, usually an employee of the company inside the human resource
department, or an outside, third-party (independent) recruiter, quizzes all
comers and passes the survivors to a person who makes the final selection.
The person who makes the selection — that is, the person who has hiring
authority — is usually the department manager or the boss to whom the 
victorious candidate reports.
Questioners who screen typically are more experienced in interviewing
processes than the questioners who select — they’ve studied and practiced
interviewing strategies and tactics. The best screeners have made interviewing
an art form. Their job is to gather facts and keep out candidates who aren’t
qualified for the position, or who may be qualified but who have a poor
employment history.
When screening takes place at a professional level (rather than leaving the task
to an untrained receptionist or office assistant), the screeners are experts at
finding out what’s wrong with you — exactly why you should be kept out of an
employer’s workforce.
64
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

But screeners determine only whether you have the minimum qualifications
for the position. They don’t decide whether you’re the best candidate.
Typical subjects for the screening interview include
 Questions about your job history
 Questions about your salary history or requirements
 Questions about your transferable skills — ability to do the job
 Inquiries about inconsistencies on your resume (work history gaps)
 Probes designed to reveal lies in your resume
 Questions to reveal what kind of person you are — reliable, trustworthy,
team-oriented
Screeners usually aren’t concerned with evaluating your personality or
thought processes. They have one basic responsibility before putting you on
the approved list and waving you up to the next interviewing level: to be sure
that you qualify. They do so by validating your experience, education, skills,
and track record.
Screeners are gatekeepers; they’re criticized for allowing unqualified candidates
to slip through the gate. They especially don’t want to take a hit for passing
along a flat-out loser. That’s why screeners want the facts, just the facts.
Keep your answers straightforward and save most of your dynamo-drama
moves for the selection interview.
When the facts confirm that you’re qualified for the position, the opportunity
to participate in a selection interview is favorable. As long as you don’t volun-
teer reasons for the screener to send you away, expect to be passed to the
decision-maker — who assumes that you’re qualified or you wouldn’t be
showing up in the interview pool of candidates.
What if you and the screener don’t seem to be on the same wavelength?
Unless you’re plying the human resources trade, it doesn’t matter — you
won’t be working together.
Screeners can’t hire you, but screeners can send you to the showers.
Selection interview
Suppose that you’re hired, but fail to live up to expectations. Is the screener
in trouble? No. The selector made the hiring call.
In the selection interview, almost always a live interview, sometimes called the
decision interview, you meet with a supervisor, department head, or another
person who has the authority to hire you. Often this interviewer will be your
65
Chapter 5: A Chorus Line of Interviews by Type

potential boss, so you too will be making judgments during the interview.
(Sometimes the selection decision is made by more than one person, as I tell
you in the section “Group interview.”)
Selection interviewers are rarely pros at interviewing and often just go with
their intuition, hoping the task is over as quickly as possible so that they can
get back to their “real” work.
Because the selection interview may take several detours, be ready to ask
leading questions to get the interview back on track and to set up an opening
to describe your qualifications in light of the position.
Even if the questioner seems like the kind of person you’d share a beer with,
don’t relax. Your interviewer is trying to decide which candidate is the best
investment for the company — because a wrong choice could cost the com-
pany thousands of dollars in training time, correcting mistakes, and firing to
hire again. Selection interviewers are looking for
 Strong presentation of personality: How you blend with other employees,
as well as your general likability and motivation to work
 Specific details of your competencies and skills: How your qualifications
allow you to do the job better than other candidates
 Specific details of your job experience or education: How you’ve not
only done — or been trained for — a similar job, but how you’ll apply
that background to the new job
 How you handle specific job scenarios: How you think under variable
or stressful conditions and solve challenges
Assuming that the person conducting the meeting will be your boss or a col-
league with whom you have to get along, the selection interview is where you
move from neutral behavior into high gear. This is where you reveal the best
of your personality (you’re not holding yourself in, as you were during the
screening interview). And this is where you take note of how you and your
potential boss blend. If your gut instinct tells you the blend is oil-and-water,
think carefully before saying yes to this job offer.
Even when everything else is tempting, your future will go better when you
and your future boss are “using the same software.”
In a classic Western spoof, Blazing Saddles, actor Harvey Korman plays a
gang leader recruiting bad guys to ruin a town. Interviewing Cleavon Little,
who wants to be his sidekick, Korman initially worries that they’re not “using
the same software.”
Korman asks Little to describe his qualifications as a villain. When Little tells
him that his past work was stampeding cattle, Korman is about to blow him
off with a comment that stampeding cattle isn’t a big thing in gangland. Little

smirks knowingly, then says, “Through the Vatican?” Right then, Korman
decides that Little and he are two villains of a kind, shouting “kinky!” and
hiring him on the spot.
Combination interview
Small firms often combine the screening and selection interviews. The result-
ing combination tends to be long and grueling, and not only tests your match
to the hiring requirements but also measures your stamina and motivation
for the job.
From the very first exchange, pull out all the stops in selling your top qualities
and displaying a pleasant personality because you won’t get a second chance.
Promotion interview
Moving up from the inside as an internal candidate often is easier than gaining
access as an outside candidate. But it’s not a sure thing.
Approach a promotion interview as though you were heading out to a new
company. Research diligently, as I describe in Chapter 6, to be able to talk
about industry trends and other big issues.
When you’re the only insider wrangling for the job, use your knowledge of
the company’s policies, plans, and culture to point out that you alone can hit
the floor running — which no outsider can actually do. Then identify several
current company problems you could deal with immediately.
Should you emphasize your 20 years of loyal service with a show-and-tell of
your successes at a time when your company is handing off generational con-
trol from boomers to Xers? The right answer, although it may seem counter-
intuitive to you, is not exactly. You have to do more. The familiar “tried-and-
proven” strategy won’t have legs during a time when new captains are 
determined to justify taking the wheel by steering in different directions.
A youth-oriented management doesn’t care about the glories of Ancient
Rome or Ancient You — what they care about is whether you can do the work
ahead — now and tomorrow.
So while you include the accomplishments of the past ten years (no more
than that), reframe the discussion to focus on work samples and skills that
highlight your ability to do the new job. Give examples of your flexible person-
ality. Identify times when you welcomed new tasks and responsibilities. Help
them see you as “the way ahead,” not as “a tribute to yesteryear.”

Recruiter courtesy interview
A retained recruiter gets paid whether or not the recruiter matches a candi-
date to a position. They typically run the other way to avoid seeing job seek-
ers who come unbidden to their offices. (Time is money.) But you may know
someone who is a client or friend of a retained recruiter who can get you
through the door with a courtesy interview.
Unless your interviewer is recruiting for a position that’s perfect for you
(which is very unlikely), focus on providing the recruiter with information
that may qualify you for a future search. Some rules to follow:
 Always give the recruiter a current resume.
 Get straight to the point; don’t take more than 20 minutes of the
recruiter’s time.
 Explain your experience, achievements, and skills.
 Thank the recruiter for time invested in you.
Don’t play the role of a coy, amateur job seeker. The retained recruiter is
doing you a favor. You wouldn’t ask for a courtesy interview if you didn’t
need a job. Your conciseness and ability to communicate efficiently count.
Review your resume and get to the point.
Recruiter general screening interview
Contingency recruiters, unlike retained recruiters, get paid only when they
match up a candidate with a position. The more people they see, the larger
their candidate pool from which to fill employers’ job orders. Getting an
interview with a contingency recruiter or employment agency consultant is
easier than with a retained recruiter.
This doesn’t mean you can waste a contingency recruiter’s time. Hand over
your resume and give your best performance to show a broad selection of
work experiences. You’re trying to make the contingency recruiter remember
you for a variety of future job openings.
Make sure that you get high scores in the following qualities:
 Personality/likability
 Adept communication
 Enthusiasm and motivated interest in work
 Leadership and initiative
68
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

 Competence in skills and knowledge
 Experience (some job history)
Recruiter search interview
A recruiter may contact you about a specific job opening. Chances are that
you’ve done or are doing a job similar to the one the client wants to fill, and
that’s why the recruiter called you. So you already know the basics of your
industry, even though at first you might not know who the client is.
If you’ve been so busy doing your job that you’re not up to date on industry
trends, there’s no time like the present for a cram review. Third-party execu-
tive and technical recruiters can’t hire you, but you’ve got to get past them to
see their clients. 
To impress a recruiter in a search interview:
 Show that you have definite career goals and indicate how this position
fits those goals.
 Ask probing, thoughtful questions about the company and position,
showing you’ve done your homework.

Brainteaser job interview
If you were to eliminate one of the 50 United
States, leaving only 49 states, which one would
it be and why?
That’s a question Microsoft interviewers like to
ask, says John Kador, business writing consultant
(www.jkador.com) and author of a smart
book on logic-driven riddles and oxygen-sucking
puzzles that job interviewers may spring on you
without warning.
Brainteasers (“Why are manhole covers round?” or
“How would you test a salt shaker?”) ordinarily are
reserved for very bright candidates as a challenge
to see who can rise and shine in professional and
managerial positions in today’s hypercompetitive
work environment.
When you suspect that you’re heading into inter-
view combat, find guidance in Kador’s book,How
to Ace the Brain Teaser Interview (McGraw-Hill,
2004).
So what’s the best answer if you are smacked
upside the head with that Microsoft state-elimi-
nation haymaker? “Well, it’s not the state of
Washington,” Kador says with a grin. (Microsoft
is headquartered in Redmond, Wash.)

Second interview
Being called back is a good sign: You’re a few steps closer to being offered the
job you want.
To come out first in the second interview, be sure you understand the dynam-
ics at play. (Actually, the second interview may turn out to be a series of
interviews but the purpose is typically the same in all of them.)
I count three kinds of second interviews and suggest tips to come out ahead
in each one:
 The yours-to-lose selection interview: The decision is virtually made in
your favor. But the hiring manager is confirming it with endorsements
and buy-in consensus from the team. Your qualifications aren’t in ques-
tion but your fit (how you fit in with the company culture) is being
probed. Relax a little — these are your new colleagues. Keep your
answers pleasant, straightforward, and brief but not terse.
 The finalists’ selection interview: The decision has narrowed to two or
three finalists. Keep selling your qualifications. Allude to cultural fit with
subtle comments suggesting that you’re one of them. (“I agree that we
must build adequate electrical power into the infrastructure.”) Ask intel-
ligent questions, such as depth of support for stated missions and pro-
fessional development opportunities.
 The do-over screening interview: Management still wonders whether
you’re underqualified and overpriced and wants to make another pass at
you, perhaps with different screeners. Expect questions all over again
about your job history, skills, salary history or requirements, resume
gaps, and the kind of person you are. (You’re reliable, honest, team-ori-
ented and, overall, have laudable values.)
If you’re working with a recruiter, ask the recruiter for tips and where
you are in the selection process. If not, ask the same question of the
interviewer who has shown you the greatest interest.
Mastering Interviews by Interviewer
You may have to face several pairs of measuring eyes — all at once. Or you
may have to endure one interview after another, all with the same company.
70
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

In the upcoming sections, I outline the possibilities and your best bets for
handling them.
One-to-one interview
The one interviewer, one interviewee format is the traditional and familiar
style of job interview. You and the employer meet, usually at the employer’s
office, and discuss the job and your skills and other qualifications that relate
to the job. You find suggestions on how to be bravo in the one-to-one inter-
view throughout this book.
Group interview
The plot thickens. Also called a panel, board, team, collective, or committee
interview, this style puts you stage center before a comparatively huge 
crowd — perhaps 5 to 12 questioners. Usually they are people from the depart-
ment where you would work, or they may come from various departments
throughout the organization.
You wouldn’t be at this expensive meeting (think of all the salaries for the
group’s time) if you hadn’t already been screened to be sure your qualifica-
tions are acceptable. These people are gathered to see whether they like you
and whether you’ll fit into their operation. Greet each person, handing out a
fresh copy of your resume. Appear confident. Make a quick seating chart to
help you remember names.
Before you answer a first question, smile, thank everyone for inviting you to
meet with them, and then begin your answer, which will probably be “You
asked me to tell you about myself. . . .”
Should you try to identify the leader and direct most of your remarks to that
person? Not necessarily. The boss may be the quiet observer in the corner.
Play it safe — maintain eye contact with all committee members. When your
curtain goes up, play to a full house!
Group interviews highlight your interpersonal skills, leadership, and ability
to think on your feet and deal with issues in a stressful setting. The purpose
of a group interview is not only to hear what you say, but to see what behav-
iors and skills you display within a group.
When the interview is over, thank the group as though you just finished 
a speech. 
Thank you for having me here today. I enjoyed being with you. This inter-
view confirmed my research indicating that this company is a good place 
to work. I’ll look forward to hearing from you, and hopefully, joining you.
71
Chapter 5: A Chorus Line of Interviews by Type

Ask questions. Periodically summarize important points to keep the group
focused. Use a notebook to record several simultaneous questions, explain-
ing that you don’t want to omit responding to anyone’s important concern.
Serial interview
A serial interview also involves a group of people, but not all at once. You are
handed off from person to person. You typically are passed from screener to
line manager to top manager — and perhaps a half-dozen people in between
in the drawn-out process of the serial interview. You strengthen your chances
each time you are passed onward.
Use your screening (plain vanilla personality) interview behavior with all
interviewers you meet except those with whom you would work. Then go
into your selection (full personality) mode.
Another type of serial interview is a prescheduled series of interviews, usu-
ally lasting one to two days, that each applicant must complete before the
employer makes a hiring decision. The serial interview is almost always used
when a candidate is flown in from a distant locale. Paste a smile on your face
and hope that it doesn’t fall off after a day of being “on stage.”
When the initial interviewer says that you’re being passed on to the second
interviewer, try to find out a little about the second interviewer. Ask a ques-
tion like “Does number two feel the same way about customer service as you
do?” You’ll get information you need to find common ground with your next
interviewer. Continue the advance-tip technique all the way to the finish line.
When you’re interviewed by one person after another, consistency counts.
Don’t tell a rainbow of stories about the same black-and-white topics. When
interview team members later compare notes, they should be discussing the
same person.
Mastering Interviews by Technique
One of the funniest movie reviews ever was for the 1960s film Chitty Chitty,
Bang Bang.
The entire review read: “It went bang bang and it was chitty!”
The film’s director, who here shall remain nameless, couldn’t have been
happy about that review. No happier than a job interviewer bearing responsi-
bility for the hiring of a candidate who disappoints.
72
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Much as a film director calls the shots on a movie set, placing actors and
cameras to best advantage, a job interviewer sets the technique and tone of
the interview, whether it be behavior-based, tightly or loosely controlled,
intentionally stressful, or loaded with brain-crunching puzzles.
Behavior-based interview
Behavior-based interviewing relies on storytelling — examples of what
you’ve done that support your claims. Premised on the belief that the past
predicts the future, behavior-based interviewing techniques are used to ask
the candidate how they have handled specific situations — what kinds of
behaviors they used to solve problems.
The presumption is that if you were a good problem solver in the past, you’ll
be a good problem solver in the future. Behavior-based interviewing empha-
sizes “What did you do when,” not “What would you do if?”
Interview questions are designed to draw out clues to a candidate’s work-
place DNA. All candidates are asked virtually the same questions. The tip-off
that you’ve just been handed a behavior-based question, which should be
answered with a demonstrated skill or trait, is when the question begins with
such words as these:
 Tell me about a time when —
 Give me an example of your skills in —
 Describe a time when you —
 Why did you —
A few fleshed-out examples illustrate the behavior-based technique more fully:
Think back to a time when you were on the verge of making a huge sale,
and the customer balked at the last minute, promised to get back to you, 
but didn’t. What action did you take?
Remember a time when you improved inventory turns; how big an improve-
ment did you make?
Tell me about an on-the-job disaster that you turned around, making lemon-
ade from lemons.
Describe the types of risks you have allowed your direct reports to take.
Can you give me an example of when you were able to implement a vision
for your organization?
73
Chapter 5: A Chorus Line of Interviews by Type

Why did you decide to major in sociology at the San Marcos State University
rather than at a small private college?
Companies using behavior-based interviewing first must identify the behav-
iors important to the job. If leadership, for instance, is one of the valued
behaviors, several questions asking for stories of demonstrated leadership
will be asked:
Tell me about the last time you had to take charge of a project but were
lacking in clear direction. How did you carry forward the project?
Because the behavioral style of interviewing attempts to measure predictable
behavior rather than pure paid work experience, it can help level the playing
field for rookies competing against seasoned candidates.
In mining your past for anecdotes, you can draw from virtually any part of
your past behavior — education, school projects, paid work experience, vol-
unteer work, activities, hobbies, family life.
As you sift through your memories, be on the lookout for a theme, the motif
that runs through your choices of education, jobs, and activities. Put at least
half a dozen anecdotes that illustrate your theme in your pocket and pull
them out when you need them. Examples of themes are 
 Leadership
 Problem solving
 Negotiating
 Initiative
 Overcoming adversity
 Succeeding
 Dealing with stress
 Sacrificing to achieve an important work goal
 Dealing with someone who disagrees with you
 Commitment
 Work ethic
 Task orientation
 Communications skills
Here are several more suggestions for best answering behavior-based 
questions:
 Tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end using the PAR 
technique — problem, action, result.
74
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Here’s an example: Problem: An e-commerce company was operating at a
substantial loss. Action: I outsourced technical support and added seven
new product lines. Result: We cut our expenses by 8 percent, increased
our revenues by 14 percent, and had our first profitable year with expec-
tations of higher profits next year.
 Rookies: Don’t simply cite the subject of your classes — “I couldn’t solve
my accounting problem and so I asked my professor.” No! Look back at
your student class projects, previous work experience, and extra-curric-
ular activities. Reach into real life for your success stories.
 Try not to sound as though you memorized every syllable and inflection,
or like a machine with all the answers. Admitting that your example was
a complex problem and that you experimented until you found its best
solution humanizes you.
Realize that the interviewer is more interested in the process than in the
details of your success stories. What was the reasoning behind your actions?
Why did you behave the way you did? What skills did you use?
Behavior-based interviewing, which arrived more than 40 years ago, is popu-
lar today because employers are trying to snatch clues from history to pro-
ject the future. The underlying rationale is that people tend to play the same
roles in life over and over.
Theatrical insiders call this tendency “typecasting.” In explaining a shift away
from action films, film star Bruce Willis quipped, “I’ve saved the world so
many times, they’ve given me an 800 number.”
Directive interview
The directive interview is one in which the interviewer maintains complete
control and walks you through the discussion to uncover what the inter-
viewer wants to know. The patterned interview is similar except the inter-
viewer works from a written list of questions asked of all candidates and
writes down your answers.
A patterned interview is also called a structured interview. Although the 
structured interview has been around a long time, the format is finding new
followers.
The argument in favor of structured interviews is that they promote fairness,
uncover superior candidates, and eliminate the cloning effect (in which an
interviewer essentially hires candidates in his or her own image — or one
who the interviewer thinks will “fit in” merely because of shared values).
In structured interviews, the interviewer may throw out a critical incident and
ask you to respond. A critical incident is a specific problem or challenge that
was successfully handled by employees of the company. Like a quiz show, the
75
Chapter 5: A Chorus Line of Interviews by Type

host (the interviewer) has the “answer sheet” — the actual behavior that
solved the problem or met the challenge.
Some critical incidents can be anticipated by researching industry trends and
inferred by reading company press releases online.
Whether you are in a directive interview, or a patterned (structured) inter-
view, expect interviewers to ask both closed- and open-ended questions.
A closed-end question can be answered yes or no:
Did you find my office easily?
An open-ended question usually asks how or why:
How do you like this industry?
This interviewer has an agenda and is intent on seeing that it’s followed.
Being too assertive in changing the topic is a mistake. The only safe way you
can introduce one of your skills is to ask a question:
Would you like to hear about my experience in quality assessment?
Nondirective interview
A nondirective interview rewards you for leading the discussion. It’s 
often an approach of line managers who don’t know much about profes-
sional interviewing.
Questions tend to be broad and general so that you can elaborate and tell all
kinds of terrific stories about yourself. A few questions may reveal key areas
of the employer’s needs. These questions may sound at first as though
they’re critical incidents, but in this loose-limbed interview, the interviewer
probably doesn’t assume that he or she knows the answers. Examples of
nondirective interview questions include
We had a problem employee last quarter who revealed information about our
marketing strategies to a competitor — how would you handle this situation?
You understand some of the difficulties this department faces — how would
you approach these in your first four months?
Tell me about your goals in the next five years and how this position fits in 
with them.
Your resume shows you have a degree in Spanish and another in computer
science — how do you plan to use both of these in this position?
76
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 

Carry agenda cards or a small notebook with a list of your qualifications and
a list of questions about the company. When you have to carry the ball, work-
ing from notes can be a lifesaver if you have a leaky memory.
Stress interview
Recognizing the hazing that goes on in a stress interview is important; recog-
nize it for what it is — either a genuine test of your ability to do the job or ter-
minal pranksterism by a dumb jerk.
Don’t take the horrors of a stress interview personally. Keep your cool and
play the game if you want the job. Don’t sweat. Don’t cry. Your most reliable
tactic is to speak with calm, unflagging confidence. You may have to practice
remaining poised in the face of an interviewer’s intimidation tactics.
Suppose that you’re in sales. Asking you to sell the interviewer something —
like the office chair — is fairly common. But having you face blinding sunlight
while sitting in a chair with one short leg is, at best, childish.
Stress interviews often consist of
 Hour-long waits before the interview
 Long, uncomfortable silences
 Challenges of your beliefs
 A brusque interviewer or multiple curt interviewers
 Deliberate misinterpretation of your comments and outright insults
Typical questions run along these lines
Why weren’t you working for so long?
Your resume shows that you were with your last company for a number of
years without promotion and a virtually flat salary; why is that?
Can you describe a situation when your work was criticized or you disliked
your boss?
Would you like to have my job?
What would you do if violence erupted in your workplace?
A famous admiral, now dead, used to nail the furniture to the floor and ask
the applicant to pull up a chair. If an interviewer crosses your personal line of
reasonable business behavior, you may want to make a speedy exit.

Mastering Interviews 
at Remote Locations
A filming location is a place where some or all of a film or television series 
is produced, in addition to or instead of using sets built on a studio backlot
or soundstage.
Going on location is not always a cushy assignment. Some years ago, while
filming in a Philippines jungle, the movie’s production chief warned star actor
Michael Caine to beware of a poisonous serpent called the 1-2-3 snake.
Asking about the odd name, Caine was told it was because once bitten, after
taking 1-2-3 steps, you’re dead! Worse luck, the snake looked like a twig. The
saving grace was that the film’s native guides could smell the snake.
Unsurprisingly, each morning Caine and the crew checked to be sure the
guides hadn’t caught colds.
While not every interview takes place across a desk at the company’s home
base, presumably you won’t have to worry about snakes as you head out for
an interview over a meal, in a campus interviewing room, at a job fair, or even
at home where the whole family is inspected.
Mealtime interview
Just when you thought you’d been through all the interviewing hoops and
assumed that landing the job was a done deal, you get a luncheon invitation
from a higher-up in the company, perhaps your potential boss. Why?
78
Part I: And the Interview Winner Is . . . You! 
Storytelling your way to a job
Prepare for all your interviews — not just
behavior-based interviews — by recalling
anecdotes from your past experience that back
up your claims of skills and other qualifications.
Work on these stories as though you’re going to
present them in a speech before hundreds of
people. Make them fun, interesting — even
exciting! Few of us are natural-born storytellers,
but do your best to tell a good story.
Experts claim the way to ace behavior-based
interviews is to prepare, rehearse, and deliver
one- to two-minute stories about your skills,
experience, and accomplishments that relate
directly to the job. Your commitment to meeting
their interests shows as you recognize their
goals and pay your respects in full with relevant
stories.

Robin Jay, author of The Art of the Business Lunch: Building Relationships
Between 12 and 2 (Career Press, 2006) identifies the following reasons:
 To judge you on your social skills and manners
 To find out additional information about you that an employer may not
legally be able to ask
 To get to know you better
 To compare your social behavior to that of other candidates
As an account executive, Jay ate her way through 3,000 business lunches (No,
she’s not fat.); she says that sharing a meal with someone reveals his or her
personality faster and more effectively than all the office interviews in the
world. “Many a job has been won or lost at the table,” Jay observes.
So while a mealtime interview may seem more relaxed and social, stay as
alert as you would in any other location. Mealtime interviewers are watching
you with big eyes.
To avoid spilling precious job opportunities, mind your manners:
 Don’t order entrees so hard to eat that you spend the entire interview
lost in your plate with long pasta or saucy, messy, or bony food.
 Don’t order alcohol unless you’re at dinner — even then have only one
drink. White wine is a good choice.
 Don’t order the most expensive or the most inexpensive thing on 
the menu.
 Don’t smoke (companies are becoming obsessed with employee health
costs).
 Don’t complain about the food, the service, or the restaurant.
 Don’t over-order or leave too much food on your plate.
For savoir-fare in a mealtime interview, be sure to
 Order something that’s easy to eat (like a club or veggie sandwich).
 Chew with your mouth closed, speak with your mouth empty.
 Order something similar to what the interviewer orders or ask the 
interviewer to suggest something.
 Show your appreciation for the treat — once hired, you may find 
yourself brown-bagging your lunch.
Practice a technique known as mirroring — what the boss or the interviewer
does, you do. Take the interviewer’s lead in resting arms on the table, holding
forks, the speed of shoveling in the food. Subconsciously, you’re establishing
79
Chapter 5: A Chorus Line of Interviews by Type

similarities, making the interviewer like you (See the sidebar “Bravo moves
for all interviewing styles” later in this chapter.)
Always be polite to the food server. Even if the service or food is so bad you
make a mental note never to set foot in the place again. Treating the server
with disrespect is worse than spilling spaghetti sauce all over the inter-
viewer’s new suit.
No matter how much or how little the tab, the interviewer always pays, so
don’t reach for the bill when it comes, even if it’s placed closer to you. Let it
sit there unclaimed, unloved. Remember, this could be a test of your confi-
dence or of your knowledge of protocol.
On-campus interview
Some employers recruit on campuses by setting up interviews through your
college’s career center. These are screening interviews conducted by com-
pany recruiters. (Check out the earlier section, “Screening interviews.”)
Job market to college seniors: Snag the interviews you want by learning and
using the system. Sign up for resume and job interviewing workshops; make
friends with the career center counselors; ask for job leads.
Although the past few years have been favorable for new graduates, don’t
forget: Some jobs are better than others; why shouldn’t you have the best?
When you don’t get interview slots you want, check back for last-minute can-
cellations or additions to the interview schedules.
Job fair interview
Job fairs are brief but significant encounters in which you hand over docu-
ments — either your resume or a summary sheet of your qualifications
(carry both types of documents). Your objective is to land an interview, not
get a job at the fair. At best, you’ll get a screening interview on the event site.
Try to preregister for the job fair, get a list of participating employers, and
research those you plan to visit. Your edge is to be better prepared than the
competition.
Fair lines are long, so accept the likelihood that you’ll be standing in many
lines. Make use of your time by writing up notes from one recruiter while
standing in line to meet another.

Bravo moves for all interviewing styles
No matter what style of interview you’re doing,
some factors are all-purpose job winners.
 Make them like you. No matter how scien-
tific the interviewing style, the quality of lika-
bility is a powerful influence in deciding who
gets the job. And it’s human nature to like
people who like us, and who are like us in
common interests and outlooks.
Show your similarities with the interviewer
and company culture. You need not be
clones of each other, but do find areas of
mutual interest: preferences in movies,
methods of doing work, or favorite company
products, for instance. When you success-
fully intimate that you and the decision-
making interviewer share similar world
views, values, or approaches to work, you
create affinity that leads to job offers, as
this true story shows:
After trying for months, Julia Benz (not her
real name) finally won an interview with a
major Los Angeles company, and she was
taking no chances on botching the inter-
view. As a part of her preparation, Benz
went to the office the evening before her
appointment.
She had merely intended to peek inside to
see what the building was like but just as
she looked in, a janitor cleaning the floor
noticed her and asked if she needed help.
Benz told the truth. She said, “I wanted to get
a feel for the place where I’m having an
important interview tomorrow.” Probably
against company policy, the janitor invited
Benz into the interviewer’s office and pointed
out several meticulously detailed models of
old ships mounted on a high shelf. The inter-
viewer was clearly an avid collector. Later
that night, Benz read up on old ships at the
library.
You know what happens next: When Benz
met the interviewer, she pointed at one of
the models and remarked — “Say, isn’t that
a Hudson sloop?” The affinity was instant.
Benz got the job.
 Listen well to interviewers’ questions,
statements, and feelings. People like to be
listened to more than they like to listen.
Show your likability by summarizing,
rephrasing, and playing back what inter-
viewers say instead of concentrating just
on what you have to say.
 Don’t drip honey by overdoing compliments
or small talk. Take cues from the inter-
viewer’s office mementos just long enough to
break the ice. Most interviewers will cloy at
such transparent, saccharin plays for empty
approval. Rather, get to the point — the job.
 Pause thoughtfully.Show that you think as you
talk. It’s okay to pause in thoughtfulness during
an in-person interview, where interviewers
can tell you’re contemplating, thinking things
through before answering. Exception: Don’t
take a thinking pause in a telephone or video-
conferencing interview, where any pause is
dead airtime.
 Take notes. Have a small notebook handy
and use it when the interviewer is talking,
especially after you’ve asked a question or
the interviewer has put special emphasis on
a subject. Taking notes not only shows that
you’re paying attention, but it also flatters
the interviewer. If you prefer using a laptop
to take notes, ask first: “May I make a few
notes as we talk? I don’t want to forget any
of your key points.”

Everyone tries to arrive early, so think about arriving at half-time when the
first flood has subsided. Dress professionally, whatever that means in your
career field.
Work up a branding brief (see Chapter 18) with at least one strong memo-
rable point to say to recruiters — I am in the top 10 percent of my environmen-
tal engineering class. If there’s no immediate feedback inviting you for an
interview, hand over your summary sheet and ask — Do you have positions
appropriate for my background? If the answer is positive, your next question is
Could we set up an interview? If you don’t get a positive response, continue
with Could we talk on the phone next week?
Whether or not you’re able to schedule an interview on the spot, when you
leave, hand over your resume. Think of your job fair interaction with
recruiters as a major star’s cameo performance in a film: Move in, make a
high-profile impression through dress and preparedness, and move on to the
next prospect.

 Knowing what information you need for interview power
 Chasing down the right research and nailing it
W
hat do two Oscar-winning actors have in common? Al Pacino and
Nicolas Cage understand that information is everything.
Al Pacino has performed more unforgettable gangster characters than just
about any other actor. Even so, the superstar prepared for his role as an aging
Mafia hitman in Donnie Brasco by chatting up actual New York wiseguys.
Nicolas Cage played a New York paramedic in Bringing Out the Dead. The para-
medic, surrounded by the injured and the dying, nears the abyss of spiritual
shutdown as his ambulance screams across city streets. To get a feel for what
these health workers go through, Cage asked to do a ride-along with para-
medics. He was told to put on a bulletproof vest and “just stay calm” because
the real paramedics were going to the scene of a drive-by shooting, where Cage
witnessed the reality of a young kid suffering with a bullet shot through his leg.
Information is everything — and everywhere. You may not want to go as far as
traveling several thousand miles to eyeball gangsters, or holding back tears as
you comfort a suffering gunshot victim. But don’t pull up short in the opposite
direction, either. That’s one of the worst miscues job seekers can make. Too
many have become nonchalant about research. (A single example: Late last
night I received an e-mail that melted my servers. It was from a young woman
who wanted me to immediately send her questions and answers for today’s job
interview!)
An indifferent attitude toward research won’t devalue your candidacy during
a screening interview (especially when a recruiter makes the initial contact),
but it will badly bite you at an in-person selection interview. (Screening and
selection interviews are described in Chapter 5.)

So even if you’d rather scrub morgue floors than do quiz-show-quality research
on organizations and their people, go ahead and dig right in — or hire someone
to do it for you. Here’s why:
 You’ll have the facts to demonstrate a convincing fit between your 
qualifications and the job’s requirements.
 You can give brilliant answers when asked, “What do you know about
our company?”
 You’re better prepared to absorb and evaluate new facts the interviewer
adds during the interview.
Here’s What Computers Tell Us
Getting a ton of free information on most public — and some private — 
companies is as fast and as easy as “click here.”
In just an hour or two, you can lay your eyes on 
 Annual reports
 Financial data
 News releases
 Information about products and services
 Industry trends
 Competitor information
You may be able to find out about
 Employee views on a company
 Pending mergers and acquisitions
 Pending layoffs
 Shifts in management personnel
 Corporate culture
 Wall Street’s outlook for the company
All the data you obtain on the “Big D” (big digital resource library) helps you
make career moves that light up your eyes and boost your bank account.
Suppose you discover a company teetering on a legal edge or dumping employ-
ees like an out-of-control sociopath; take a pass. But when you discover no
impending corporate collapse or toxic bosses running the show, and you want
the job, research is a tiebreaker in a tight race with another candidate.

Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Asking Questions about 
Potential Employers
Use the following questions as a checklist to gather all the information you
need. You probably won’t be able to use information on all the factors that
follow, and you may think of others as important for your specific search.
Here’s the rule on how much research to do: The more responsible the job —
or the more competitive the race — the greater amount of research you must
do to pull ahead.
Size and growth patterns
The size of a company and the scope of its operations say a great deal about
the company’s ambitions and opportunities for advancement. Try to answer
the following questions:
 What is the company’s industry?
 Has the company expanded globally?
 Is it expanding or downsizing?
 What are its divisions and subsidiaries?
 How many employees does it have?
 How many clients does it serve?
 How many locations does it have?
 Does it have foreign satellites?
Direction and planning 
Answers to questions about the company’s plans may be difficult to find 
outside of the company’s Web site, annual report, newspaper business pages,
business magazines, or the industry’s trade publications. The following infor-
mation is worth pursuing as it lets you know some of the hot issues to
address or avoid:
 What are the company’s current priorities?
 What is its mission?
 What long-term contracts has it established?
 What are its prospects?
87
Chapter 6: Research Is Your Ticket Inside

 What are its problems?
 Is it initiating any new products or projects?
Products or services
You shouldn’t go into a job interview without at least knowing what products
or services are the bedrock of the company’s business. Find answers to these
questions about any company you pursue:
 What services or products does the company provide?
 What are its areas of expertise?
 How does it innovate in the industry — by maintaining cutting edge
products, cutting costs, or what?
Competitive profile
How the company is positioned within its industry and how hard competitors
are nipping at its heels are measures of the company’s long-term health and
the relative stability of your prospective job there. Get to the bottom of these
issues by asking
 Who are the company’s competitors?
 What are the company’s current projects?
 What setbacks has it experienced?
 What are its greatest accomplishments?
 Is the company in a growing industry?
 Will technology dim its future?
 Does it operate with updated technology?
 Can its jobs easily be moved to another country?
Culture and reputation
The answers to these questions are likely to be subjective, but they say a
great deal about how well you’ll be able to fit into the corporate culture. Look
for clues especially on recruitment videos on the company’s Web site. How
fast is the pace — frantic? laid-back? formal? informal? aggressive? Tuning
your performance to a company’s cultural factors can make you look as
though you’d fit in just fine. Answers to the following questions give you
clues about a company’s culture:
88
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

 Does the company run lean on staffing?
 What’s the picture on mergers and acquisitions?
 What is the company’s business philosophy?
 What is its reputation?
 What kind of management structure does it have?
 What types of employees does it hire?
 Is it family-friendly?
 Is it woman-friendly?
 What is the buzz on its managers?
 How does it treat employees?
 Has it pushed out older workers?
Company history
Assess how the company’s future may be influenced by its past. Was the com-
pany part of a hostile takeover? Has it been doing the same things the same
way for years because its founder would have wanted it that way? Ask the fol-
lowing questions to find out:
 When and where was it established?
 Is it privately or publicly owned?
 Is it a subsidiary or a division?
89
Chapter 6: Research Is Your Ticket Inside
Private equity and job creation or loss
Private equity firms are all the rage in money
circles these days. They’ve gobbled up many
well-known companies.
Private equity firms are investment companies
that pool big bucks from wealthy investors, pen-
sion plans and other institutional investors —
and borrow a lot more money — to buy compa-
nies. Their aim is to squeeze more profit out of
underperforming corporations. Equity firms
have always been associated with job losses,
despite claims by industry studies that buyouts
create jobs.
When you’re a potential employee of a com-
pany that’s been taken over by a private equity
firm, you want to know about the quality of jobs
being created and the kinds of jobs that were
sent to the dumpster. Is pay on the new posi-
tions going up or down, and do these jobs come
with health insurance and retirement benefits?

 Has it changed much over time?
 How quickly has it grown?
Company financials
Collecting current and accurate information about financials is a long chase,
but it’s better to learn a company’s shaky financial picture before you’re hired
than after you’re laid off. Dig for the following nuggets:
 What are the company’s sales?
 What are its earnings?
 What are its assets?
 How stable is its financial base?
 Is its profit trend up or down?
 How much of its earnings go to its employees?
 How far in debt is the company?
Ready, Aim, Fact-Find
As you begin to scope out and scoop up information for your job search,
what curtains must you part?
Privately owned companies are harder to track than publicly owned compa-
nies. Local or regional companies are harder to check out than national 
companies. And discovering the details on a corporation’s subsidiaries or
divisions is harder than finding out about the corporation as a whole.
Ferreting out the financial and personnel scoop on small and mid-sized compa-
nies — where the great majority of jobs are found — is a still greater challenge.
Unpeeling the onion on start-ups is a major sleuthing gig.
Ready to start your big dig? Here are basic questions paired with concise
answers to speed you on your way.

View recruitment videos with eyes wide open
Companies are rushing to add videos picturing
employees to their repertoires of recruiting
tools. They often present these recruiting videos
as a kind of day-in-the-life of a typical employee
at ABC company. They can be very helpful when
you watch for clues reflecting the people the
company prefers to hire.
The videos are supposed to offer potential
employees a glimpse of a company’s work envi-
ronment and culture. For example, a video may
show employees seated in a cubicle farm. If
you’re an open-space type of person, you’ll
want to ask about the work-space assignment
policy during your interview.
The workforce age mix is another inference you
can draw from recruitment videos, according to
Mark Mehler, a principal at CareerXroads, a
recruiting technology consulting firm in Kendall
Park, N.J. “Are all the people shown north of
40? Or does a mix of age groups offer a hint that
experienced professionals are encouraged to
apply?” Mehler asks.
The videos offer insights on how to dress for
your interview and the kind of work wardrobe
you’d need in the related job. When everyone in
the video is dressed in casual attire and your
grooming hallmark is a business suit — or vice
versa — you’re probably in the wrong theater.
In an abundance of caution, you may want to
watch a company’s recruiting videos twice. And
when you see one that reminds you of an
infomercial, put on your critical-thinking cap.
Remember that happy talkers are chosen to
appear on the company’s silver screen instead
of grousers who tell ugly little secrets. When
you see employees shown merely talking about
their jobs, rather than doing their jobs at their
work stations, ask yourself why.
In fact, some of those smiling faces appearing
in recruitment videos may belong to human
relations professionals, says Todd Raphael, edi-
torial chief at ERE Media (www.ere.net), a
New York publisher of recruiting news. Raphael
notes that a video may use an unfamiliar job title
rather than a familiar version. A “sourcing man-
ager” is actually a recruiter. “You want to hear
from a person doing the job you want, not a
company spokesperson,” he advises.

How can I find out about smaller companies that aren’t in the 
databases?
Jack Plunkett, who heads Plunkett Research Ltd. (www.plunkett
research.com), a leading provider of business and industry information,
says that most private companies will not divulge financial information to
employees or to job seekers. “However, a few very entrepreneurial firms
call themselves ‘open companies,’ meaning that they let all employees
know about financial results each month,” Plunkett explains.
What about a company that is not “open”? Plunkett advises that you
politely ask such questions as: What’s the source of the company’s back-
ing? venture capital? partners? family-owned? angel investors? Is the com-
pany profitable? When the company is funded by venture capital or angel
investors, the business research expert warns job seekers to beware of
potential financial instability.
Here are further ways to get the goods when information isn’t readily
available:
• For smaller firms, go online to American Journalism Review (www.
newslink.org), where you can search news sites including home-
town newspapers across the nation.
• Search local business newspapers published by American City
Business Journals. Find them at www.bizjournals.com.
• Company Web sites won’t tell you about financial stability, but you
may get clues to the company’s customers and suppliers. Call them
and say you’re doing a credit check (which is true) on the company
you’re investigating.
• Competitors often have a fair idea of a company’s financials.
Perhaps you can you find someone who knows someone who
knows someone.
• When you really want reassurance, go to Hoover’s, Inc. (www.
hoovers.com) and use its links to order a credit report on the
employer. These reports are compiled by D&B (formerly Dun &
Bradstreet) or a credit bureau, such as Experian. Caveat: Business
credit reports aren’t cheap, so find out the cost before ordering.
The reports can help you determine whether the company is
paying its bills on time or has other problems that warn you off 
of accepting a job offer.
• Suppose you’re dealing with a mini company, one with a half-dozen
employees, for example. You can’t find a shred of information writ-
ten anywhere about the company. After the job offer, you might ask
to speak privately with one or two employees “to get a sense of the
company culture.” Once alone, you can try to find out what, if any-
thing, the employer doesn’t want you to know. If you’re replacing
someone, ask to be put in touch with your predecessor.

Extra! Extra! Print resources to the rescue!
When you need to pull out all the stops in
preparing for a job you really, really want, turn to
print publications. Study back-issue indexes
and archives to major newspapers to see what
journalists were and are reporting about a
prospective employer. Many libraries have back
issues of The Wall Street Journal, The New York
Times, The Financial Times, and other important
newspapers on microfilm. Try BusinessWeek
and Forbes magazines, as well as industry-
specific trade journals and newsletters.
• Notice the furnishings as you interview. Are you looking at cement
blocks and boards for bookcases? The bare minimum in decor may
be a clue to a serious operating capital problem.
How could I check out a start-up company?
When historical data on a company doesn’t exist, you can ask questions
of the interviewer: How much capital is on hand? How fast is it being
spent? Is additional funding in place?
Additionally, if you can snare a copy of the company’s business plan,
review it for probability of success with an accountant, investment
banker or SCORE consultant (a volunteer, free to you, of the U.S. Small
Business Administration).
You also can make an informed guess about the competence of the princi-
pals of the firm by checking out the track record of the management team
and financial backers. Try the free service of ZoomInfo. Find it at www.
zoominfo.com.
Library copies of Standard & Poor’s Industry Surveys and Plunkett’s
Industry Almanacs are other good places to poke around.
While no new venture is Oscar-certain, you’re wise to avoid taking a part
in a real-life production of Frankenstein Meets Godzilla.
Preparation Makes You a Headliner
As you approach important job interviews, your research actually can
change your life for the better.
That’s because employers consider company research a reflection of your inter-
est and enthusiasm, intelligence, and commitment. Research shows you are
thorough, competent, and revved up to work. Every employer likes those traits.
And not so incidentally, finding out what you should know about a company
may encourage you to make a decision to look elsewhere.

A
mong seemingly endless and entertaining online playgrounds designed
to help you discover what kind of person you really are, you can gauge
your similarities to your favorite Harry Potter character or your favorite
James Bond villain. You can analyze your personality by your taste in music
or your favorite colors. Alternatively, you can peek inside yourself based on
quizzes featuring ink blots or superheros or Disney characters.
The online world offers all kinds of unscientific ways for you to plumb your
depth. But flip that coin to the employment world, and personality testing
becomes a serious assessment tool that helps decide who gets hired and who
gets promoted.
One of the world’s leading employment assessment authorities, Wendell
Williams, Ph.D., Managing Director of ScientificSelection.com, offers this col-
orful thought: “While it’s amusing to discover whether or not you have the
personality of Air Bud or Seabiscuit, after the fun wears off and you decide
you would rather bark than whinny at your co-workers, it’s time to consider
whether a bark or a whinny makes any real difference at work. Unless you’re
a budding Dr. Doolittle, help yourself by focusing on the specific personality
factors that lead to job performance success or failure.”
This chapter backlights employment personality tests, which have become
familiar rites of passage into the corporate workplace as a condition of 
being hired.

Personality Testing Is Serious Business
Trying to anticipate why you do what you do at work is the reason that 
you may be required to take a personality test before being granted an inter-
view. Or why you may have to take a personality test somewhere in the 
interviewing process before you’re offered a job.
An integrity test may or may not be part of the personality assessment. Here’s
what each measures:
 Employment personality tests measure choice, preference, values,
behavior, decisions, attitudes, and job-related interests.
 Integrity tests rate honesty, responsibility, and reliability for the job.
Test development expert Dr. Williams throws more light on the overall reason
why personality tests are a favored business assessment tool: “Employers
administer personality and integrity tests because they try to avoid making 
a bad hire which means they want to know as much about a potential
employee as possible.”
I asked test reviewer Ann Hart for still more reasons why employers use per-
sonality tests. Hart is the senior author of an insightful book she wrote with
George Sheldon, Employment Personality Tests Decoded (Career Press, 2007).
Hart says organizations give pre-employment tests for these reasons:
 To hire the employee who poses the least financial risk to the corporation.
 To hire people who can make good decisions under stress and who lead
or work well within teams.
 To avoid hiring candidates who are dishonest, bullying, angry, disruptive,
or a violence threat to the workplace.
How many companies require job candidates to take personality tests?
Estimates are all over the place, topping out at 30 percent. Despite sketchy
data, the personality-discovery star does seem to be rising. Don’t be surprised
if you face an employment personality test in your future. Will it be on paper
or online?
Paper-and-pencil tests have been filtering out unsuitable candidates for years
but Web-based personality tests have become important to the hiring process
only within the past decade or so. In the foreseeable future, the relentless push
of computer power and ’Net connection speeds will change the nature of work,
but those advancements can’t change human nature. Personality tests open a
window on human nature.

What You Might Not Know 
about Personality Tests
To borrow from an anonymous saying, here’s my observation: “If you can stay
calm while all around you is chaos in the pressure of a pre-employment 
personality test, then you probably haven’t completely understood the seri-
ousness of the situation.” Personality tests, love ’em or loath ’em, guard the
gateways to your future.
A rundown of six important things to understand about your future encoun-
ters with personality tests follows.
Asking questions before the test
Although you can’t blow off a request to sit for an employment test and get
hired, you can ask a few questions to spread a small safety net under your
candidacy. Try these feelers:
 I read about a rash of lawsuits over hyper-intrusive personality tests that
originally were developed to spot mental illness, such as The Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and its knock-offs. Can you tell me the
name of the test I’ll be taking, whether the test provider has been involved
in any legal challenges of the test, and if so, what was the outcome?
 I sometimes get nervous and uptight about tests. Can I take the test again
if I don’t do too well today, or is this take final?
 What kind of test(s) are you asking me to take? Personality, integrity,
performance . . . ? What is the title of the test?
 Can I get any feedback regarding test results? How about areas I didn’t
do well in . . . at least I’ll know what areas need improvement.
 Will I still be considered for the job if I don’t do well on the test?
Expect to hear “no” more often than “yes” to these questions, but any one of
them is worth a try. If the interviewer is dismissive, at least you know the
kind of company you’re dealing with — if you think they’re tough now, wait
until you’re hired and the honeymoon is over.
97
Chapter 7: Your Close-Up: Personality Tests

Anyone can write a personality 
test, but is it validated?
Would you be surprised to learn that literally anyone can author a personal-
ity test? It’s true, and virtually anyone does, from creative homemaker and
college psych major, to advertising writer and company hiring manager. 
From their fertile minds come questions such as these:
 Do you prefer riding in a car to riding a motorcycle?
 Can a white drummer kick with a black band?
 Do you sometimes get bored or always find life interesting?
Yes, anyone can write the questions, add up the answers, and declare state-
ments about what they mean. The problem is that without validation
research, the statements are virtually meaningless.
To prove valuable, psychometric tests must be statistically validated with
enough people over enough time to give users confidence that the tests actu-
ally predict what the test-makers claim — that they work as advertised.
“Once a company knows what it wants to measure and has chosen a legitimate
hiring test, the company studies its own employees to prove test scores are
associated with job performance, turnover, training, or other essentials of a
successful organization before judging the test to be validated,” Dr. Williams
explains.
That’s why psychometrically-trained professionals are assigned to identify
the kinds of psychological traits that lead to the selection of an achieving,
profitable workforce. These professionals develop a test that measures
human traits and then verify the test by proven methods. Statistically sup-
portable personality tests typically are written by experienced professionals
with doctorates in some aspect of psychology.
Finding out what a test measures
If you can discover the title of the personality test that you’ll be taking, you
may be able to identify the traits measured by the test. In pursuing a test
chase, look for test reviews published by the Buros Institute of Mental
Measurements at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, a gateway for serious
and validated testing information.
Be sure to read the FAQs on the Buros Web site (www.unl.edu/buros) to
learn about 
98
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

 Locating tests in Buros’s Mental Measurements Yearbook, a regularly
updated reference containing test reviews; it is available to read free 
in many large public and university libraries.
 Accessing Tests in Print, a bibliography of commercially available tests in
the English language.
 Using Test Reviews Online, a service that provides access to the same
test reviews that appear in the Mental Measurement Yearbook series;
each test can be downloaded for a modest fee.
When you have no inclination or time to do a test chase, don’t give up — 
Dr. Williams has your back. The widely-quoted industrial psychologist reports
university research showing that only about five traits are associated with
job performance:
 Conscientiousness about the job
 Agreeability and flexibility
 Extroverted behavior
 Inquiring mind
 Non-neurotic
Of the Big Five (which may go by different names, depending on whom you
talk to), Dr. Williams says the three traits most commonly associated with
good job performance are conscientiousness, agreeability, and not being neu-
rotic. Expressed another way, good workers care about their work, get along
with others, and are emotionally stable.
Who’s most likely to use tests
High-level executives in any industry rarely are asked to undergo a personal-
ity test, with or without an integrity component. Government agencies typi-
cally use their own tests and assessments.
Non-manufacturing businesses tend to use personality tests more than do
manufacturing industries. Examples of non-manufacturing businesses include
retailers, banks, utilities, insurance companies, staffing agencies, and commu-
nications corporations. Integrity tests are prevalent in jobs involving money,
public safety, or merchandise, especially in entry-level positions.
Your civil rights in testing
Using personality tests to gauge job candidates that weren’t specifically
designed for hiring has led to lawsuits. Usually employers have been on the

You have the following rights when it comes to testing:
 You have a right not to be subjected to wanton invasion of privacy with
intrusions into non-job-related areas such as your sex life, religious
beliefs, and political views.
 You have a right to expect compliance with the Americans with Dis-
abilities law, which prohibits requiring medical examinations before 
you get a job offer.
 You have a right not to be subjected to a test that has a “disparate
impact” on a protected class of people, such as certain racial or 
ethnic groups.
If you think your rights may have been violated by a personality or integrity
test, research the topic online (Run a Google search for personality test civil
rights.) or consult an employment lawyer.
Peeking into privacy issues
“Personality tests need to be handled like confidential medical records,”
observes Anne Hart, senior author of Employment Personality Tests Decoded
(Career Press, 2007). “Find out whether test results are given to your health
insurance company along with medical information. Psychological testing,
like medical exams, should be confidential and not stored in open-ended
databases in your employer’s human resources department,” Hart adds.
What if you’re not hired — how long will your records be kept at both the
employer’s office and/or at the vendor testing company? I asked a legal
expert in pre-employment testing about that issue.
“Testing companies should be willing to discuss their records and security
procedures with candidates,” noted eminent employment attorney Joseph
Schmitt at the Halleland Lewis Nilan & Johnson firm in Minneapolis.
“Reputable testing firms won’t be offended if you ask about confidentiality,
and should be able to detail their security procedures upon request.”
But Schmitt explains that the tests legally can’t be destroyed overnight:
“Candidates should be aware that their records will be retained for a mini-
mum of one year (two years in California) under federal and state regulations
regarding retention of hiring records. You may wish to ask when records are
destroyed, and for a confirmation that your records are deleted after the
records retention period has expired.”

You certainly don’t want your test results whizzing around the Internet.
Underscoring the serious need to protect test score privacy, reports of
irreparable damage to someone’s reputation surface too often. The reports
are caused by accidental or malicious posting of another person’s personal
information online. Even if your records are online for just minutes, they can
be copied and distributed around the world for employers to read. You 
can never be 100% certain that an online image has been killed off.
Making the Grade on Job Tests
Conventional wisdom advises that you get a good night’s sleep, be truthful in
all your answers, and relax and enjoy a personality test that the interviewer
says is standard operating procedure.
About the kicked-back mindset, at least, conventional wisdom is wrong.
Instead, consider the flower vendor who sells her basket of posies by arrang-
ing the freshest pieces on the top. If you want cash for your flowers, learn
how to display your best blooms.
In the following sections, I give you tips for displaying your best blooms
(traits) in a personality test, tips that I gathered from the four corners of the
testing industry.
Visualize yourself fitting in
Based on your research of the company, imagine the ideal candidate. How would
that paragon of virtue think? When you hit a wall with a weird question, your
fallback position is to try to answer as the ideal candidate/perfect employee.
Obviously, answering as the ideal candidate/perfect employee is not easy. You
need to guess what the paragon is like. (Hint: Review video clips featuring
employees on the company Web site.) How much and what kind of personal-
ity characteristics are you being compared to?
When in doubt, position yourself as a person of moderation in the mainstream
of contemporary thought. Test administrators tend to grade unconventional
beliefs as potential trouble.
Company managers prefer to hire people like themselves. Although similarly
minded employees don’t always do better, a personality kinship gives man-
agers a warm, fuzzy feeling by knowing that everyone looks and talks alike. At
least in spirit.

Chapter 7: Your Close-Up: Personality Tests

Watch for combination tests
Many tests are combinations of several types of test questions. Even if the
first 10 questions ask about your personality traits, stay alert for questions
about your aptitudes (such as potential for leadership or creativity) or abili-
ties or your integrity (such as lying). These questions may require greater
concentration to answer in ways that will help you.
Beware of absolutes
Watch out for absolutes like always, ever, and never. For example, saying you
never took more than your share of things in your life may paint you as a
goody-two-shoes who can’t be trusted. Unless it’s an honesty question,
answer in the middle of the range; middling answers tend to confuse hiring
managers who aren’t sure what they’re looking for.
Choose answers suggesting positive traits
Try to select answers that put you in the most positive light. Examples of
favored characteristics include
 Achievement-oriented
 Agreeable
 Assertive
 Conscientious
 Dependable
 Emotionally stable
 Good communicator
 Imaginative
 Intellectually curious
 Open to new experiences
 Optimistic
 Responsible
 Sociable
 Tolerant
 Trustworthy
102
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Avoid answers suggesting negative traits
Stay away from answers that show you in a less-than-stellar light. Examples of
negative characteristics to avoid implying include
 Inability to function under stressful conditions
 Dishonesty
 Emotional dysfunction
 Acceptance of fraud, as in filing a fraudulent worker’s compensation
claim
 No opposition to stirring up legal trouble
 Poor impulse control
 Propensity for interpersonal conflicts
 Thievery
 Tendency toward time theft (sick leave abuse, tardiness)
 Illegal drug use
 Disregard for rules
 Tendency to be tense or suspicious
 Rigidity
 Prejudice
 Predisposition for negative interpersonal relationships
 Lack of self-worth
Be alert to replayed questions
Some tests ask virtually the same question on page one, page three, and page
ten. The test is trying to catch inconsistencies — figuring you forgot a lie you
told 30 questions ago. If possible, read through the test before you start.
Consistency counts.
Anticipate integrity test questions
Integrity questioning may be part of a personality test or a separate test.
A lie scale measures the position of a test answer on a gamut from lie to
truth. The scale functions as a kind of lie detector.
103
Chapter 7: Your Close-Up: Personality Tests

But even if you’re as truthful as Honest Abe, people under pressure of testing
sometimes give questionable answers. For example, if you’re asked to esti-
mate the percentage of workers who steal from their employer, make a low
guess. A high guess may be interpreted to mean you think employee theft is
common, and therefore, acceptable.
Most integrity questions are fashioned for entry-level or mid-level workers who
have access to merchandise or trade secrets, or for financial workers 
who handle money.
Take a lot of practice personality tests
Ready yourself for employment personality tests by working through as many
practice questions and tests as time permits. Find practice tests online at
such test publisher Web sites as

Special tips for salespeople
The sales representative who maintains long-
term relationships selling ongoing telecom 
services to a company has a different kind of 
job than does a sales representative who sells
an automobile to a customer in a one-time
transaction. Personality tests for salespeople
differ as well. Even so, any test administered 
for the sales industry probably measures such
core characteristics as the following:
 Empathy — the capacity to identify or sym-
pathize with another individual’s feelings
 High energy — the force to stay with a chal-
lenge until you meet it
 Achievement orientation — a drive for
learning new abilities and impatiently
accomplishing goals
 Intellect — qualities showing culture and
imagination
 Self-control — a feeling of being in per-
sonal control of your destiny
 Self-efficacy — the belief that you can meet
your expectations if you try hard enough
 Self-monitoring — the tendency to use
social cues (not only your personal convic-
tions) about what is expected
 Positive resilience — the ability to not take
sales failure personally but also to bounce
back for the next sales call

Additionally, find practice tests — and leads to others — in a number of
books, including the following:
 Employment Personality Tests Decoded by Anne Hart with George Sheldon
(Career Press, 2007)
 How to Master Psychometric Tests by Mark Parkinson (Kogan Page, 
UK, 2004)
 Ace the Corporate Personality Test by Edward Hoffman (McGraw-Hill, 2002)
Sample Personality Questions
Questions on all types of tests may require uncomfortable yes/no answers.
(Following the questions, I explain their meaning in parentheses.) Here are
some examples:
 Do you believe that children or spouses are far more important than 
anything?
(Will your family life interfere with your job?)
 Do you exercise regularly?
(Are you likely to be a high risk for health insurance?)
 I would like to be a florist.
(Are your interests suited to this field?)
 I still maintain close contact with friends from high school.
(Do you get along with people for long periods of time?)
 I have thought of trying to get even with someone who hurt me.
(Are you vindictive, or can you put hurts behind you?)
Some questions require specific answers, rather than yes or no:
 How often do you make your bed?
(Do you clean up after yourself? Are you obsessive about it?)
 On average, how often during the week do you go to parties?
(Will you frequently come to work hungover?)
 Describe how you see work.
(Do you see work as mandatory or as a way to obtain rewards?)

Keep On Keeping On
When you’ve taken a personality test but you weren’t invited to an interview,
soldier on to your next opportunity. Although you’ll probably never learn your
test scores or even hear anything back from the employer, your results may
have hurt your chances of being hired for the position. If so, the only return
you’ll get on your investment of 50 minutes or more of your time is experi-
ence gained. The way to win employment is to keep applying for more jobs.
106
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
Concerned that you didn’t do well?
The stark truth is that you can’t really do much
about a test score when you mess up. Busy
employers are focused on finding the right
people to hire, not on helping those who are
among the unchosen.
“Do-overs are rare,” explains Dr. Williams.
“Regardless of what you say or do, most hiring
managers have a die-hard perception of their
favorite personality profiles. If you don’t fit their
molds, you seldom get a second chance. In the
final analysis, testing is a roll of the dice for 
the unwary and quicksand for the uneducated.”

Showing You the Money
In This Chapter
 Recognizing sales pitches for you to accept less cash

 Avoiding tipping your hand in a negotiation
 Gracefully addressing your less-than-stellar salary history
 Scripting the best deals for your negotiation
I
magine this uncomfortable scenario: After accepting and starting a new
job, you discover that you’re paid 20 percent under market and that
instead of climbing what an enthusiastic recruiter called a stairway to the
stars, you’re on a road to nowhere.
Fiascos like this can happen when you fall hook, line, and sinker for a recruit-
ment pitch that deflects a position’s cheapo cash compensation. The pitch
distracts you by spotlighting non-monetary aspects of the position — growth
opportunity, latest technology, fabulous coworkers, super company — you
name it.
Although this chapter shows you how to deal with under-market offers in
general, there are a few justifiable exceptions when you will and should seri-
ously consider making cash secondary to opportunity or lifestyle in a job you
accept. A few examples:
 You’re a new graduate or career changer with scant experience and you
need good breaks and helping hands in a nourishing environment.
 You’re taking a lower rung on a ladder that positions you to compete for
a higher rung.
 You’re a parent who needs home time with the kids.
Special concerns aside, most of the time thee and me are zeroed in on the
legal tender we want to earn for the rent of our brains and labor, to maximize
cold cash and monetary-based employee benefits. We usually begin our pur-
suit for fair compensation through salary negotiations with recruiters.

Recruiters are employers’ personal shoppers, tasked with going into the mar-
ketplace and bringing back the best qualified candidates for the thriftiest
prices. In this chapter, I list the types of recruiters you’re likely to encounter,
the siren songs they may sing to snag the best bargains, and the ways you
can get the best employment deal for yourself.
Recruiters and Their Talking Points
Recruiters are sales professionals, not your new best friends. This is true when
 The recruiter (a.k.a. headhunter) is an external recruiter (a.k.a. third-
party recruiter or independent recruiter).
 An external recruiter is employed as a retained recruiter on an ongoing
basis and is paid a set fee — much like a retained lawyer or accountant.
 An external recruiter is employed on a transaction basis as a contingency
recruiter and is paid only when a submitted candidate submitted is hired. 
 The recruiter is an internal recruiter (a.k.a. company recruiter), who is
staffed in a company’s human resource department and paid a salary.
All recruiters are engaged by employers to find people for jobs — not jobs for
people. And they do it by being superb sales professionals.
Recruiters who deem you qualified for a position pass you up to a hiring 
decision-maker, often the individual to whom you would report.
How can you tell when you’re being recruited with a song-and-dance to divert
your attention from a chintzy salary? Look out for yourself by discovering the
insider secrets straight ahead.
Tactics meant to sell low offers
When a company gives a recruiter a limited compensation budget to offer
candidates, the recruiter’s job and livelihood depend upon convincing you, 
a qualified candidate, to take the “downpay” job offer by pointing out collat-
eral benefits the job may or may not truly offer.
It’s a tough sell. So tough that employment consultants write industry arti-
cles for recruiters advising them on how to increase their offer acceptance
rate, when, in the words of one prominent consultant, “your company pays
crummy wages.”
108
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

The consultants’ suggestions include the following sales techniques and 
talking points:
 Offer “exploding bonuses” that shrink in amount the longer you take to
consider the offer. (Don’t give candidates too long to think about accept-
ing a job that pays under market.)
 For a management job, invite comradeship with the company CEO, who
calls asking you to accept the offer, commenting that “You and I can
build this company together.” In a variation, a potential coworker calls
urging you to “Join the team — it’s great.” (This too refocuses your
attention from legal tender.)
 Make a great “higher-calling” offer. This includes such rewards as a title,
telecommuting, training options, a socially responsible and environmen-
tally friendly employer, working with new technology, and the opportunity
to make a difference in people’s lives rather than “just making money.”
 Reframe the discussion by speaking less of cash compensation and ben-
efits and more of job stretch and growth opportunity.
Job stretch describes an environment in which you show what you can
do on a larger stage — heftier operating budget, bigger challenges, and
supervision of more employees. In baseball, a job stretch move is from
the minors to the majors. 
Growth opportunity is the lure of future raises, promotions, and company
growth. In entertainment, a growth opportunity move could be from
stunt double to featured player.
In a funny kind of arithmetic, a recruiter may speak the language of “an over-
all increase of 30 percent” if you take the offered position. Here’s a typical
break-down of what the recruiter may really mean by that 30-percent figure:
perhaps 15 percent for stretch in the job, plus likely long-term growth of 
10 percent, and 5 percent for a cash compensation boost over your last job.
Do the arithmetic. And do due diligence before you buy that reasoning.
You’re not yet finished with the give-and-take of sophisticated salary 
negotiation. The recruiter has plenty of arguments in reserve, as the 
next section reveals.
Recruiter comebacks when 
you stick up for yourself
When you’re hot on the track of treasure and refuse to budge from your “show
me the money” stance (“If this is such a great job opportunity, I need greater
money.”), experienced recruiters may balk. They, who practically live in the
109
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money

salary negotiation space that you infrequently visit, are famous for classic
comebacks. Here are five golden oldies with suggestions for countering their
rejoinders.
 Don’t make the mistake of overvaluing compensation and undervaluing
opportunity. (I appreciate your calling that important point to my atten-
tion and I’ll bear it in mind.)
 If I succeed in getting the cash compensation increased, the company will
probably want me to produce other candidates with more experience. (I hope
not. But you have a fiduciary responsibility to your client to produce the
best candidate for a fair price — and I’m that person hands down.)
 We’re looking at other candidates who don’t share the level of expectations
you express. Why should we consider raising the bar so high in your case?
(I have the same level of performance expectations for the work I pro-
duce. I’m sure the other candidates know what they’re worth better than
I do. Are you looking for an outstanding or a mediocre hire? If it’s talent
you want, you should choose me because of my proven record in —.)
 Prove your ability. Do a great job and you could get a sizeable raise next
year. (I appreciate that and I admire your line of thinking about reward-
ing performance, provided promises for the future build on a fair market
rate going in. I have done a lot of salary research and believe that a start-
ing salary of $___ would be attractive to me because my performance
with previous employers has been exceptional. Do you think your client
could confirm your progressive thinking about a future raise based on a
starting salary of $___ and include that promise in the offer letter?)
 If I can get the cash increased, will you sign an iron-clad guarantee to take
the position with no further haggling? (Yes, I am very interested in this
position, but we need to clarify figures. How much of a cash increase
and what benefits are included?)
The lesson: To avoid walking away wishing you had come up with a better
answer to recruiter comebacks than you did, plan your responses ahead.
New thinking for new times
Perhaps the hour has come for a rethinking of conventional wisdom extolling
job seekers to take the long view. The 21st-century rate of company upheavals,
mergers, downsizings, and other job-busters may mean that you won’t be
around long enough to fully benefit from job stretch and growth opportunity.
Whether you choose to take the money and run or to put your faith in blue-
sky projections of a rosy future, invest the necessary time learning the ropes
of salary negotiation to avoid being snookered on future offers.

Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

A first step toward being shown the money is discovering what the market
will pay someone with your qualifications. The upcoming section, “Discovering
Market Pay Rates,” shows you how to find out.
Discovering Market Pay Rates
Knowing your market value — the going rate for people in your industry with
skills and a job description similar to yours — is the centerpiece for negotiat-
ing the compensation you deserve.
Finding salary information online
Discovering the market rate for the kind of work you do has never been
easier than it is today. Two companies — Salary.com (www.salary.com) 
and Payscale (www.payscale.com) — dominate the online salary research
services now available to job seekers. A third service, SalarySearch (www.
salarysearch.com), launched as I wrote this book.
All three services offer free basic data and informative salary negotiation arti-
cles; a custom report for your specific situation costs between $25 and $150.
Why would you want to pay for something you presumably can get for free?
Generalized averages produced by online salary calculators aren’t always
spot-on for specific companies and jobs.
Be certain to benchmark the job you’re applying for by job content — not just
by job title. The same job title can mean different things to different people in
different companies.
Handling salary boxes 
in online applications
Recently I was asked for a practical way to handle the salary requirement and
salary history (two different things) questions when either or both are embed-
ded as required fields in an online application. B.I. (before Internet), you could
write “Negotiable” for salary expectation to keep from under- or over-pricing
yourself. But most online applications won’t accept “Negotiable” (or “Open”
or “Will discuss in an interview”) for expected salary as a viable answer, so
that tactic is out history’s window. What now?
111
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money

Jack Chapman (www.salarynegotiations.com) rides to the rescue. Salary
consultant and workshop leader, Chapman is the author of the best-selling
guide Negotiating Your Salary: How to Make $1,000 a Minute (Ten Speed Press,
2006), my favorite book in the genre. Here’s what Chapman told me about
working those windows:
“Your self-interest is best served by putting whatever number in the salary-
requirement box that you think won’t get you screened out. The employer is
essentially asking, ‘Can we afford you?’ Since you won’t require anything
other than a competitive salary, your answer, by putting in a competitive
number, is ‘Yes, you can afford me.’
“This strategy works nicely when the box is entitled ‘Salary Requirements’ 
or ‘Expected Salary,’ but requires an additional step if it is labeled ‘Current
Salary,’” Chapman says. “Once you’re in the interview, you’ll need to explain
that you interpreted ‘Current Salary’ to mean ‘Current Salary Requirements,’
and if they want a ‘Salary History,’ you’ll be glad to provide it later as
needed.”

Background on the bucks
WorldatWork (www.worldatwork.org), an
international association of human resource
practitioners, is a recognized authority on com-
pensation matters. Here’s a selected glossary of
WorldatWork terminology:
Cash Compensation 
Pay provided by an employer to an employee for
services rendered (time, effort, and skill).
Compensation includes four core elements:
 Fixed pay: Also known as “base pay,” fixed
pay is nondiscretionary compensation that
doesn’t vary according to performance or
results achieved.
 Variable pay: Also known as “pay at risk,”
variable pay changes directly with the 
level of performance or results achieved.
It’s a one-time payment that must be re-
established and re-earned each perfor-
mance period.
 Short-term incentive pay: A form of variable
pay, short-term incentive pay is designed 
to focus and reward performance over a
period of one year or less.
 Long-term incentive pay: A form of variable
pay, long-term incentive pay is designed 
to focus and reward performance over 
a period longer than one year. Typical 
forms include stock options, restricted
stock, performance shares, performance
units, and cash.
Benefits
Programs an employer uses to supplement the
cash compensation that employees receive.
Some are legally mandated, such as Social
Security and Workers’ compensation. Others are
awarded at the discretion of the employer, such
as health and life insurance, vacations, holidays,
personal days, tuition assistance, automobiles,
and professional group and club memberships.

Negotiating in the Moment
After all your salary prep, the time has arrived to reap your rewards: You’re
in the interview room, and the back-and-forth begins.
But just when the interview is starting to fly, bam! — the interviewer lets go
with a dangerous question that could severely clip your wings: How much
money are you looking for? Should you name your price right then and there?
Not if you can help it.
As salary request that’s too low devalues your abilities; a salary request
that’s too high looks like you’re too big for the company budget. Both bids
leave you out of luck. Be aware that some employers have already budgeted
for the position, and the first offer is their best offer. They ask what you want
merely to confirm that the money’s enough to interest you in the job.
Your compensation should be based on the value of the job someone wants
to pay you to do, not on the value of the job someone has paid you to do in
the past.
Giving and taking at the right times
Sure, you have a pretty good idea going in about the remuneration you’re
shooting for, but you may discover wild cards while you’re in the interview.
You knew, for instance, that the job requires travel and you figured maybe 25
percent of your time would be spent on the road, but now the interviewer
reveals the true travel requirement — 75 percent. Would that revelation cause
you to rethink the money or re-evaluate whether you should accept the job at
any salary?
113
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money
Who wins, who loses on a lowball offer
When you’re working with a contingency
recruiter who encourages you to take less than
the going rate for a job, the recruiter may have
your best interests at heart. Or the recruiter may
just want to close the job order quickly.
A contingency recruiter’s fee is based on your
first-year earnings. Follow this admittedly over-
simplified example: Say the recruiter is to be
paid 25% of the job’s first-year salary. If the 
job’s market rate is $100,000, the recruiter would
earn a $25,000 fee. But when the job’s budget
figure is under market — say, only $90,000 —
the recruiter takes a hit of $2,500, compared to
your loss of $10,000.
From the contingency recruiter’s viewpoint,
most of a loaf is better than none. And the
recruiter hopes for future assignments from the
employer that can more than compensate for
losing a relatively few dollars on a single trans-
action.

Moreover, if you have to talk salary too early in the interviewing process, a
decision-maker may not yet be sufficiently smitten with you to make the com-
pany’s best offer.
In the previous edition of this book, I posed a key question for salary negotia-
tion: What is the best single thing you can do to receive a higher pay offer
when you’re interviewing for a job? My answer:
Delay discussing salary until you’re offered (or nearly offered) a specific
position.
Until you have the offer, the employer holds all the weight. Once you have
the offer, the scales shift. You have something the employer wants, and you
become equals negotiating a business proposition. From outsider, you have
become poised to become the newest insider — a good place to be.
Learning to deflect salary questions until the timing shifts to your advan-
tage can greatly influence the amount of money that you take from the 
bargaining table.
But although the advice to sit tight until the timing is right is still on the mark,
doing so is easier said than done these days, says salary negotiation pro Jack
Chapman. He explains:
“In the l980s, it was easy to postpone the salary talk. That has changed over
the years. Employers are more demanding or inquisitive or something. Yet,
the principle is the same — postpone when and if you can.”
But when you’re pressured to talk money sooner rather than later, Chapman
warns that digging in your heels and flat-out refusing to comply is a mistake.
By being hard-nosed, you set up a power struggle that you can’t win. You’ll be
seen as obstinate and hard to work with. A power struggle can cost you 
the job.
Nor should you move to the other extreme in which you meekly cave-in, tell all
and let it go at that. As a dogmatic refusal earns you a label of being too strong,
a roll-over and-scratch-my-belly response may make you seem too weak.
114
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
Sometimes you can just ask
To make certain your salary research is on
target, network in professional groups. At asso-
ciation meetings, speak to people in a position
to hire you. Work the conversation around to
asking a question: “What could someone with
my skill set expect to earn in your organization?”

Moreover, when you’re too low or too high for the company’s budget, you hand
the employer’s interviewing screener information to judge you by your price,
not by your whole package of qualifications. Even in the final interview round,
premature dollars talk may lead a decision-maker to see you as too expensive
without your being given an opportunity to justify your worth and negotiate.
Fortunately, there’s a better way to connect when you’re giving away your
bargaining leverage too soon: get a quid pro quo. I think of this kind of fair
exchange as Chapman’s rule:
When you comply with an early request for your salary numbers, get markers in
return. Something for something.
What markers do you want as IOUs for your upfront compliance? You want
agreement that your early money talk won’t screen you out of further inter-
view opportunities. And you want agreement that your salary discussion will
focus on the market value of the position and not on your salary history.
To side-step the negative consequences of early revelation as much as possi-
ble, you want fair consideration. Here are Chapman’s illustrations of what
you can say to get fair consideration in three interviewing situations (Find
out about the differences between screening and selection interviews in
Chapter 5.):
115
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money
Another take on pre-interview salary talk
“There’s more than one way to avoid being
boxed in by the salary boxes in online applica-
tions,” says Jim Lemke, director of organizational
development for Opportunity International, as
well as technical reviewer for this book and 
a much-lauded HR consultant. Here’s Lemke’s
recommendation:
“When you’re asked to fill in salary requirements
in an online application, I suggest that you write
the absolute minimum salary for which you’re
willing to work. Do this to avoid any chance of
being seen as too pricey to consider inviting in
for an interview. The negotiation begins in the
interview when you make the assumption that
the pay quoted is base cash salary only and then
negotiate for additional compensation such as
bonuses, perks and benefits.
“Here’s an example: Suppose you’re searching
for a job that pays a salary of $90,000. The inter-
viewer remarks that the job pays $80,000. You
respond that the figure is below your last job,
which was worth $125,000. The interviewer says
‘Wait a minute — that doesn’t reflect your appli-
cation statement that quoted your salary as
$75,000.’ Now you say: ‘What I said is true — my
last base cash salary was $75,000. But with addi-
tional performance bonuses and benefits, my
total compensation was $125,000.’ From there
you continue to negotiate.” (See Chapter 14 for
more information on negotiation in an interview.)

 Phone Screening: Before I give you all that information, can I ask a ques-
tion? (Yes) I don’t know who you’ll hire, but from what I’ve seen so far, you
should definitely at least interview me. If I’m forthright about all my com-
pensation factors, can I be assured of an interview?
 Interview Screening: Before I give you all that information, can I ask a
question? (Yes) I don’t know who you’ll hire, but from what I’ve seen so far,
I would definitely like to participate in the second round of interviews. If I’m
forthright about all my compensation factors, can I be assured of that?
 Selection Interviewing: Before I give you all that information, can I ask a
question? (Yes) I’m a little concerned that we could lose a perfectly good
match over salary expectations. And I’m confident that you’ll pay a compet-
itive salary — which is all I need. Can you, first, give me your rough range,
your ballpark compensation, and I’ll be candid and tell you how that 
compares?
If you’re too high or too low, Chapman’s approach gives you the opportunity
to address the discrepancy in the interview process instead of having the
employer decide behind closed doors with no input from you.
Why salary questions come early
Some interviewers know exactly what they’re doing by front-loading the
salary question, others may just be feeling their way through the process.
The salary question comes up quickly when the interviewer
 Is trying to instantly determine your professional level, or is slyly prob-
ing to see whether you’ll be happy with the low side of an offer.
 Wants to test the market. The interviewer may not even have an idea 
of the position’s market value and is shopping candidates to simplify
budgeting.
 Is open to paying whatever is necessary to get the right person and just
wants to know what he’s in for.
Whatever the interviewer’s motivation for prying a salary disclosure from
you, without a job offer, salary disclosures put too much power in the
employer’s hands. That point was confirmed to me by an HR executive (who
understandably wishes to remain anonymous): “While I may request salary
histories from others, I never comply with that demand when I’m in the job
market. Why not? I know a guillotine when I see one — I design them.”
So what should you do when the salary question comes at you too soon?
What can you gracefully say to hold off a precipitate discussion? The follow-
ing section, “Stalling Money Talk with Smart Replies” gives you a number of
script lines to use in response to premature questions about your salary
116

expectations. They’re followed by lines useful in sidestepping a salary his-
tory so low that interviewers will wonder why — if you’re such a standout
candidate — you’ve been so grossly underpaid in the past.
Stalling Money Talk with Smart Replies
Don’t let a frog clog your throat when an interviewer presses for the salary
discussion before you’ve established your value. Instead, answer along the
following lines:
I’m sure that money won’t be a problem after I’m able to show you how my 
qualifications can work to your advantage because they closely match your
requirements.
My salary requirements are open to discussion. Your company has a reputa-
tion of being fair with employees, and I trust you would do the same in my
case. I don’t think salary will be a problem if I’m the right person for the job.
I’m aware of the general range for my kind of work, but I’d feel better talking
about pay once we’ve established what specific performance goals the job 
calls for.
I’d be kidding if I said money isn’t important to me — sure it is! But the job
itself and the work environment are also very important to me. I wonder if
we can hold the pay issue for a bit?
I’m a great believer in matching pay with performance, so I can’t speak with
any certainty about the kind of money I’m looking for until I know more
about what you need.
117
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money
Tell recruiters your salary history
Should you ever disclose your salary history or
salary expectations before a job offer? Yes. Tell
all when you’re asked by third-party employ-
ment specialists — chiefly executive recruiters
and employment consultants who find people
for jobs.
These professionals are specialists at their
work and are paid for their time, either on a
retained or contingency basis. They get paid to
find good talent, and so they won’t let salary
deter them from presenting you when your skills
are a match for a job opening. Recruiters are far
too busy with the matchmaking task to waste
time with you if you make their work difficult.
Time is money.

Money is not my only priority; I’d really like to discuss my contributions to
the company first — if that’s okay with you.
I can’t answer that question until I know more about this job.
The amount of my starting compensation is not as much of an issue to me
as how satisfying my filling the position will be for both of us. Can we talk
more about what the position entails?
Before we get into the compensation issue, can you tell me more about the
kind of skills and the type of individual you’re looking for to help you reach
your goals? What do you expect the person you hire to accomplish within
the first three months?
All I need is fair market value for the job’s demands, which I’m sure you’ll
pay, so is it okay if we talk about the details of the job first?
As far as I can tell, the position seems like a perfect fit for me — tit for tat 
on your requirements and my qualifications. So as long as you pay in the
industry ballpark, I’m sure that we won’t have a problem coming up with 
a figure we’re both happy with.
Before we can come to an agreement, I need to know more about your 
strategy for compensation, as well as confirm my understanding of the
results you’re looking for. Can we hold that question for a bit?
Since pay includes so many possibilities for compensation, I’d like to first
know more about your compensation plan overall and how it relates to the
position.
I’m sure that you have a fair salary structure, and if I’m the best candidate
for the position, we can work something out that we’ll all like.
I’m not used to talking money before a job offer; are you making me an
offer?
My requirement is market within the area — shouldn’t be a problem. Can
we put that off to the side until we decide if there’s any need to go further
down the money road?
I will consider any reasonable offer. Should we talk about it after we’ve
wrapped up the details of the job, and I’ve been able to show you what I
bring to your company?
I’m paid roughly the market value of a (occupational title) with (number of
years’) experience and the ability to (manage, or do something special). If
you’re competitive with the market, there won’t be a problem with salary.
118
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Downplaying a Low Salary History
You know that disclosing an under-market salary history can jeopardize your
negotiating power. Try out these scripts to lessen the impact of having
worked for too little money:
I’m uncertain how my salary history will help you, because salaries are
affected by geography, benefits packages, and company priorities. Maybe
I’m wrong, but it seems to me that the going market value for the position
will be more useful. According to my research, that’s a range of $X to $Y.
A biting-the-bullet answer: My salary history won’t bring us to any conclu-
sive figures. I’ve been working under market value, and that’s one more
reason I want to make a change. This job seems perfect for me. I wonder
whether we could price the position on the basis of its worth to you?
I don’t feel comfortable limiting the discussion to my salary history because
a large portion of my compensation has been in variable and indirect pay.
I’ve received bonuses regularly based on my performance. What I think
you’re really asking is how I plan to do the job you need done — can we
talk about that?
If we discuss my salary history, can I say up front that I view this position as
a new challenge that will require higher performance than my last? I’d like
to think I’m worth more to you than to previous employers.
To get the best return on your negotiation when you’ve been working for less
than market value, repeat after me: Focus on my worth, not on my past. Focus
on my worth, not on my past. Focus on my worth, not on my past. Get it? Got it?
Good!
Considering More Factors 
That Affect Job Pay
In addition to the timing of the offer, the size of the company influences how
high the interviewer will bid for you. Although large companies typically pay
more, small companies without formal pay structures are easier to negotiate
with than corporate titans.
But even at huge companies where pay scales are cut-and-dried, your potential
boss may have the latitude to cut you a better deal. In fact, some interviewers
see your negotiation attempts at improving your compensation as a desirable
trait — yet another indicator that they’ve made the right choice. Their reason-
ing: If you can look after your own best interests, you can look after ours.
119
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money

Other factors identified by negotiation authority Jack Chapman that influence
the size of pay offers include the following:
 Supply and demand: In employee-driven markets, salary offers tend 
to rise; in employer-driven markets, salary offers don’t rise and may
even fall.
 Special skills: Skills in short supply may merit premium pay.
 Urgency: A company losing revenue because a job goes unfilled may
offer higher pay.
 Recruiting fatigue: A company weary of failure in filling a position may
ease salary limits.
 Salary compression: Concern that paying you a higher wage may lead to
revolt by current employees can cause a company to stick rigidly to a
certain salary.
Getting Your Worth’s Money
Oh happy day. Your interviewer looks you straight in the eye and says, “We’d
like you to join our team; I’m offering you a job, but before we go any further,
we should talk about how much you’d like to be paid.” The moment of truth
has arrived. You’ve got the offer. No more dodging the money issue.
To nab the best offers, follow the guidelines in the sections that follow.
Find a home in the range
The market rate that big companies typically pay for a job is often stated in a
range with a minimum, midpoint, and maximum salary. Smaller companies
may not operate on such a formal spectrum.
Negotiating doctrine has long insisted that he who goes first in a price negoti-
ation loses. To follow classic counsel, when you’re offered (or virtually offered)
a job and are asked to name your price, bounce the ball back into the inter-
viewer’s court: Can I ask you to take the lead on this question — can you tell
me your range for this position? (If you did your homework, you already know
the range. You’re merely asking for confirmation.)
Most often the interviewer who doesn’t mind tossing the first figure on the
table will respond with a straightforward answer. But anecdotes abound in
recruiting circles about interviewers who try to save the company a few dol-
lars by purposely misrepresenting the midpoint to be the maximum salary.
120
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

For example, suppose you’re applying for a job that through research you’ve
learned is budgeted at between $50,000 and $60,000. To your surprise, the
interviewer claims that $55,000 is the maximum wage. And you know it’s
really the midpoint. Hmmm.
Polite probing is one way to respond: I’m not sure I heard you correctly, or per-
haps my research is wrong. Did you say that $55,000 (midpoint figure) is the high
end of the range for this position? I thought it was $60,000, which fits in my range.
But when the interviewer bounces the ball right back into your court and you
have to go first or look like a sock puppet, express your salary requirements
in a range based on the going rate for the job: I’d be expecting salary in the
range of ($58,000 to $65,000). I think that’s a range we can work with, don’t you?
Citing a range is good because it gives you haggling room and shows that
you’re economically aware.
Not sure where you realistically should land in the range? Match your request
to your experience level. The following guidelines show you how:
 Don’t ask for bottom of the range unless you’re a rookie. Even then, if
you’ve worked while in school, ask for a two-striped corporal’s pay
rather than a one-striped private’s. You’re positioning yourself as a top
rookie candidate.
 A conservative school of thought recommends that experienced people
ask for a pay point just above midrange — not only to show that you’re
above average, but also that you understand the need to leave room 
for raises.
 Highly qualified candidates head toward the top of the company’s pro-
jected range where they belong. 
Plot your salary history carefully
Bear in mind that salary is a cash figure; total compensation includes benefits
and such variable pay as potential annual bonuses, stock options, and
expected merit raises. Example: Last year I earned $42,000 to $45,000 compen-
sation, based on a salary of $30,000. (Review the sidebar titled “Background
on the bucks” earlier in this chapter.)
When your salary history ranks you at the top or above the range of market
value, you can afford to discuss that history verbatim.
When your history is less impressive, be less specific. State your figures in
wide ranges so that you’re more likely to stay in the game for positions for
which you’re qualified. Include figures slightly above and below the market
121
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money

value to cover all your bases. Usually this approach requires bundling your
income figures for multiple years: For the past three years, I have earned total
annual compensation ranging from $95,000 to $125,000 for my work in this field.
Some job seekers feel they should inflate their salary history. That’s a risky
idea — the odds of discovery are stacked in the employer’s favor.
Instead of misrepresenting your history to try to improve your lot in salary
negotiations, try the following:
 Show compensation modules. List base pay and variable pay in one
figure; give another figure for benefits; then add the figures together for
the total compensation package.
 At executive levels, list compensation items line by line.
You might be asked to back up your salary claims. Decide in advance what
you will do if your interviewer asks you for tax forms or pay stubs. The
request isn’t illegal, but you should anticipate whether you will comply.
Some job seekers adamantly refuse to supply a salary history and give a
middle-finger salute to requests for one. They look at their pay records as a
supreme privacy issue and may feel that they’re grossly underpaid or wouldn’t
be looking for another job. As one job seeker anonymously commented online:
“I don’t want to work for a company that demands to know my salary. I want to
work for a company that wants me and will do whatever it takes to get me.” I
applaud that sentiment but know that a dogged flat refusal is unlikely to pro-
duce the most invitations to audition.
Stonewalled? Try to upgrade the job
Once you’ve established what the position entails and you’re told you’ve
received the best offer and that the job isn’t worth more, try to make the
position more important in the scheme of things:
 Point out that the job requires more than the standard duties suggested
by the job title — that the job’s content fits into a job description that
merits a higher pay bracket. Clarify how you plan to minimize company
costs through your performance. Explain how you’ll pay for yourself. By
using this tactic, you more firmly establish your worth to the company
and justify your performance-based reason for asking a higher price.
 Beef up the job. I once became one of the highest-paid managers in an
organization by combining two positions and creating a new job title. 
An employer may be interested in considering a “two-for-one” who is
paid a “one-and-a-half” salary.
122
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Even if you don’t succeed in your upgrade move, you’ll have put your new
boss on notice that you’re ready to see the money.
Use dramatic silences
What should you do when the interviewer offers you a salary on a lower level
of the salary range for the position? Two words: Keep quiet!
As the interviewer finishes the offer and waits for your reply, let the inter-
viewer wait for enough time to notice your silence. Everyone has trouble out-
waiting 30 seconds of silence. Look at the floor. Keep your face glum.
These moments of nonverbal communication show your dissatisfaction with
the offer, without a word to incriminate you as overly hungry for money. The
interviewer may feel compelled by this uncomfortable silence to improve 
the offer. Or at least open a dialogue in which you can campaign for other
kinds of rewards.
Don’t try this technique on video interviews; see Chapter 3 to find out how to
handle these unique interview situations.
Words of last resort
When it seems as though the right numbers just aren’t on your radar, you
have little to lose by trying a straightforward response:
It pains me to say this. While I’m very attracted to what we’ve been dis-
cussing, the figure you named is just not an incentive for me to join your
group. The good news is that we’re both interested, so let’s keep talking.
What do you think?
123
Chapter 8: Showing You the Money
Finding Web-based negotiation help
Continue learning all you can about the ins 
and outs of getting employers to show you the
money. Here are two suggestions:
 Jack Chapman’s Web site, Salary Negotia-
tions, (www.salarynegotiations.
com). 
 Online salary calculators noted earlier in
this chapter under the headline “Where to
find salary information online” provide a
number of responsible how-to articles.

No flexibility? Make creative suggestions
In negotiating with a small company, you’re less likely to encounter fixed pay
policies, permitting you to get creative about your compensation package. If
a small company can’t afford you on a cash basis, what else do you want?
You have a wide range of options for sweetening an offer. Ask for some com-
bination of the following:
 A company car
 Stock options
 Extra-generous mileage reimbursement
 Parking privileges
 Additional paid vacations
 Dental plan
 Tuition reimbursement
 Recreational or daycare facilities
 An expense account
 An early salary review
If you’re negotiating for a job that pays below $30,000 and you know the com-
pany’s salary cap can’t be raised right now, try to get a shorter work week or
flexible work hours, and take a second job to keep a roof over your head. If
your spouse can cover you with health benefits, maybe you can trade health
insurance for cash.
The Magic of Market Value
You researched the fair market value of your work before negotiating a price.
Slip those exact words into the discussion whenever you can — fair and
market value are terms that people like. Remember, too, that you can always
come down on your price — but coming up is almost impossible after you
name a low figure.
Most of us want to get the most we can in return for the parts of our lives that
we sell. Negotiating pay with skill and savvy can mean that you gain hundreds
of thousands of extra dollars throughout your career.

Costuming Yourself 
for a Starring Role
In This Chapter
 Making your costume fit the part you want to play
 Focusing on the sea change in formal dress codes 
 Achieving conservative or business casual dress 
 Choosing plain casual or fashion trendy apparel
A
pair of Judy Garland’s ruby slippers from The Wizard of Oz sold at auc-
tion for $666,000.
John Travolta’s white suit from Saturday Night Fever fetched $145,000.
Darth Vader’s helmet from The Empire Strikes Back brought in $115,000.
Pricey collectibles! They’d cause quite a sensation if you wore any of them to
a job interview. But you wouldn’t dream of wearing such attention-grabbing
memorabilia because you want to be remembered for what you say in that
scene — not for what you wear.
When you want to begin your career — or take it up a notch, or pull it back
from the edge — you need the right clothes, accessories, and grooming to
make a boffo first impression. How you’re dressed impacts the tone of the
interview and enshrines the first visual of you as a candidate.
By making your appearance appropriate for the job you seek, you set the stage
for the halo effect. That is, when the interviewer likes you right away, the inter-
viewer may assume that if you excel in one area (image), you excel in others.
Some potential employers make a subconscious hiring decision within seconds
of meeting a candidate and spend the rest of the interview validating their ini-
tial impression. With these stakes in mind, be sure your appearance is a real
curtain raiser.
This chapter tells you how to impress the hiring squad by selecting interview-
ing attire that boosts your confidence because you look, act, and feel good.

Three Commandments of Style
By dressing appropriately, you signal employers that you respect their com-
pany’s culture and that you care enough to expend the effort to make the
right impression.
Begin your mastery of interviewing impressions with these three key princi-
pals of presenting yourself in the right team uniform.
Dress to fit the job and the job’s culture
Social DNA draws people to others who are like them. When extending a wel-
come to a newcomer, you pay compliments that indicate “You’re one of us.”
Companies and organizations are made of people working as a group to accom-
plish common goals. An anthropologist might think of such a group as a kind
of workplace tribe.
When your choice of clothing or your grooming keeps you from looking like
you’re a member of the tribe, you create an image of an outsider, perhaps
causing the interviewer to perceive you as “not one of us.” That’s why you
should make the effort to look as though you absolutely belong on the com-
pany’s tribal land.
How can you find out about the company’s dress code and grooming conven-
tions? You have several options:
 Visit the company’s Web site and search for videos of employees. Check
for beards, mustaches and long, loose hair. Notice whether the men are
wearing sport jackets or suits, or simply shirts with or without a tie.
Observe whether the women are in pants or skirts, and if the latter, how
short they are.
 Call the human resources office and ask about the company’s dress
code.
 Use your personal network — or an online social network — to find an
employee whom you can quiz.
 Loiter near the workplace and observe employees coming and going.
Just don’t wear a raincoat, show up in a white van, or watch through
binoculars.
Correctly interpreting the company dress code is the Number One Command-
ment to follow in dressing for job interviews.
128
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Think of interviewing attire as a costume
The Number Two Commandment in interview dressing is to understand that
your attire is a work-related costume. With a few exceptions, which I discuss
later in this chapter under “Heading for Fashion Frontiers,” the job interview
isn’t an outlet for unconventional self-expression.
On that point, a rookie job seeker once asserted to me her right to wear to an
interview whatever she chose to wear: “My personal style and how I look is
my business,” she petulantly insisted. “True,” I agreed, “and the person an
interviewer hires is the interviewer’s business.”
Treating an interview as a chance to show off a free-spirited or eccentric per-
sonality is a big mistake. To drive home the point, here are several extreme
examples of the do-your-own-thing-no-matter-what error:
 Imagine a woman of 50 trying to look nifty in a sparkly, hand-painted T-
shirt, or wearing a baby-doll mini dress floating above a pair of tights.
 Imagine a man of 25 making a Tony Soprano statement with a black shirt
and white tie, or channeling Indiana Jones in a beat-up leather jacket.
 Imagine a woman of 35 whose nails are so long she looks like Edward
Scissorhands in a skirt, or as if she’s preparing to duel with Cruella De Vil
in 101 Dalmatians.
Okay, you get it: Keep far-out personal image statements safely locked in the
closet when you’re out on job patrol. Otherwise, some interviewers will think
you’re outlandish, maybe even weird, and they’ll want you gone.
When you’re not sure whether your interview wardrobe borders on bizarre
or is more appropriate for after-hours wear, ask yourself the ultimate litmus
question:
Would my favorite film director cast me as a person who would be hired if
I auditioned wearing this get-up?
By wearing an interview-appropriate costume, you’re not selling out your
authentic self, you’re moving on. And, if fortune and preparation smile, you’re
moving on to a better place: making the short list and then being hired.
“Look the part, and the part plays itself”
This old theater adage is the Number Three Commandment in constructing
your interview image, says Jack D. Stewart of Abilene, Texas.
129
Chapter 9: Costuming Yourself for a Starring Role

A retired recruiter, Stewart once accepted a recruiting search for an indus-
trial sales rep. The job order came from a new client. Stewart’s firm began
referring quality candidates, recommending to the candidates that they 
dress conservatively for their interviews, meaning business suits, well-
pressed shirts, and silk ties.
Six interviews with different individuals brought the same puzzling response
from the new client, who said: “Each candidate was basically qualified, but
not what we’re looking for.”
Stewart’s firm had a policy of re-evaluating a client’s assignment when six
candidates were referred and none received a job offer. A recruiter was sent
to the client’s offices to uncover the problem.
Imagine the recruiter’s astonishment when he entered an office filled with
people dressed in very casual slacks and sport shirts sans ties. “Well,” the
recruiter thought, “these must be the foot soldiers. What does the captain
wear?” The recruiter found out soon enough when the sales manager arrived
to greet him in a pair of black work shoes topped by white socks.
“From that day forward,” Stewart explains, “we dressed down our candidates
for their interviews with that client — but we couldn’t bring ourselves to tell
them to wear white socks. Finally, one of our referrals was hired. The experi-
ence is a good reminder for job interviewees — When in Rome, wear a toga.”
Following Today’s More-
Relaxed Dress Code
Is the following statement true or false? “You can never be overdressed. Even
if they say to wear business casual, it’s appropriate for you to be in a suit 
and tie.”
If you guessed “true,” you may have guessed wrong. A sea change has floated
into American workplaces defining what constitutes acceptable clothing to
wear on the job. And to a certain extent, the lightening up on dress codes has
spilled over into job interviewing.
First, a little background: I can’t remember a time when virtually every job
interviewing expert hasn’t hammered home the basic tenet that dressing con-
servatively is the safest route. Period. That advice retains validity but here’s
the thing: For many people, the notion of what dressing conservatively means
has changed. Traditional suit-and-tie wisdom is no longer universally and
automatically correct. Conservative in many cases now means nicely pulled-
together business casual apparel.
130
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Who says so? A number of studies over the past decade confirm that work-
place dress codes have become more liberal than they were back in the
starchier twentieth-century days:
 A 2001 poll by the Society for Human Resource Management reported
that 87 percent of U.S. companies allow some form of casual dress in 
the workplace. 
 A 2003 survey by the Business Research Lab, a research and management
consulting firm, noted that about half of respondents said the dress code
where they work had changed in the previous two years, and by three to
one, they said the code had become more casual.
 A 2006 tally of employers conducted by the National Association of
Colleges and Employers revealed that companies seem to be consider-
ably more relaxed about appearance these days. Just 12 percent said
that a male job candidate wearing an earring would be a negative and
only 28 percent said they’d frown at weird hair color (like blue, green,
violet). Two-thirds of employers surveyed said that body piercing 
would not strongly influence a hiring decision.
The casual and laid-back dressing trend working its way across the country
has moved beyond workers who work alone or in creative groups. Even sales
and other professionals who interact with the public have jumped on the
casual fashion runway.
Dressing for a job interview isn’t a foregone decision these days. Consider
your options in the next section, “Running Down Four Basic Categories of
Work Wear.”
Running Down Four Basic 
Categories of Work Wear
Both women and men should expect every nuance of their appearance to be
noted and interpreted at a job interview. As Mark Twain supposedly said,
“Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.”
When you’re getting ready for the big days, choose your attire from these
four basic fashion categories:
 Conservative: Examples of conservative dressing environments include
banks, accounting firms, management offices — especially in big corpo-
rations, law firms, and offices of elected officials. Formal and conservative
Donald Trump is a poster boy for this work category.
131
Chapter 9: Costuming Yourself for a Starring Role

 Business casual: Business casual environments and career fields include
information technology, sales, government agencies, education, retail,
real estate, engineering, small companies, and certain dot-coms. Poster
nominees: classic Oprah Winfrey and relaxed Ellen DeGeneres.
 Casual: Casual environments are those such as construction, trucking,
maintenance, repair, landscaping, and other jobs where work clothes
may end the day stained and sweaty. Home improvement icon Bob Villa
has dibs on the poster honors for this job lot.
 Creative fashion: Examples of creative career fields include entertain-
ment, fashion, graphic design, interior design, and popular music and
other arts. Poster people: trendy Jessica Simpson, and offbeat Johnny
Depp.
A discussion of each category follows.
Taking the conservative approach
Conservative dressing means no surprises. Your look is traditional or
restrained in style. You avoid showiness. You aren’t flamboyant. Conservative
dressing means you not only wear the established team uniform, you wear it
well from the tip of your white collar to the closed toe of your dark shoes.
For women, a conservative checklist includes the following:
 Suit: Wear a two-piece suit or a simple dress with a jacket. Good colors
are navy blue, gray, dark green, dark red, burgundy, or black. Make sure
your skirt length is a bit below the knee or not shorter than just above
the knee.
In a dark color, a pantsuit is a tasteful choice. Accessorize it with a
simple shell and silk scarf. Caveat: If your research shows you’re inter-
viewing with a super-traditionalist, stick to skirts.
132
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
Should you dress 10% above your level?
When you go job interviewing, the classic
advice is, “Dress one step up from what you’d
typically wear to work in that position.” Other
lines you may hear are “Dress 10 percent better
than you ordinarily would,” or “Dress for the
position you’d like to have, not for the one you
do have, so you’ll be seen as promotable.”
My take on upscaling for interview days is to
“Dress the best you’re ever going to look in the
job you want.”

 Shirt: A white, off-white, or neutral-colored blouse is a safe choice.
 Shoes: Closed-toe pumps with low or mid-heels suggest that you’re
work-minded.
 Accessories: Briefcases look more serious than purses, but a handsome
leather purse is fine. Avoid distracting jewelry or watches, and make
sure you wear stockings.
 Make-up: Moderate makeup for daytime wear is appropriate. No looking
like a Britney Spears stunt double.
 Hair: Simply styled hair looks contemporary; observe styles on TV
anchors, for whom maintaining a professional image is essential.
For men, the following conservative checklist applies:
 Suit: Power suit colors are navy or charcoal gray. (Black on men is seen
as somber.) Tans and medium-tone colors work well if your research
shows they’re included in the company’s color chart for team uniforms.
Suits should be well-tailored.
 Shirt: White is the first choice for shirts; blue is second. In either case,
wear only long sleeves.
 Tie: Dark or low-key (blue, black, navy, blue, or gray) or power red colors
look executive-like. Geometric patterns are okay, but only if they’re mini-
mal. Be sure your necktie knot is neat and centered on your neck; the
bottom of the tie should just reach your belt. Don’t don a bowtie.
 Shoes: Wear lace-up shoes in the same color as your belt. Wear black
shoes if your suit is gray or navy; dark brown shoes for tans or medium-
toned colors — polished and clean shoes that are in good condition, of
course. Rubber-soled shoes are a bad match for a professional suit and
tie, as are alligator shoes or sandals.
 Socks: Wear dark socks in mid-calf length so no skin shows when you sit
down.
 Accessories: Limit jewelry to a wristwatch and, if you wear them, cuff-
links. No surprise earrings, necklaces, or body piercings.

About that fragrance
Perfumes and after-shave scents should be
minimal or missing. Some people are allergic
and others may be reminded by the fragrance
of someone they didn’t enjoy knowing.

Choosing business casual
The nation’s work attire has morphed from Casual Friday to Casual Every Day
and, in sync, the trend has moved to the interview outfit, too. An increasing
numbers of recruiters say that a business suit is too formal for an interview
at their company.
The interpretation of business casual varies too widely for universally accepted
rules but mainstream opinion nixes casual clothing you might wear to a picnic
or ball game, such as sweatsuits, spandex, shorts, T-shirts with slogans or com-
mercial logos, bared midriffs, halter tops, and tank tops.
For women, a business casual checklist includes the following:
 Clothing: Guidelines here are looser than for conservative dress.
Sticking with the following points is a safe bet:
• A casual jacket or blazer with well-pressed trousers or a skirt is a
top option.
• A jacketed tailored dress is a fine choice.
• Tailored knit sweaters and sweater sets are appropriate. 
• A knee-length, or longer, skirt with a blouse works well for support
jobs.
• Pastel overload (pink, baby blue) is fine in a nursery but not in
your outfit.
• Provocative clothing (see-through tops, uncovered cleavage,
second-skin pants, festive shimmering-fabric, super-short skirts)
isn’t your best option.

Online wardrobe mistresses and masters
When you’re trying to scope out the latest fash-
ion scene — what’s hot and what’s not — the
World Wide Web is your oyster. Here are sev-
eral sites to get you started:
 Fashion.About.com (fashion.about.
com): A guide to women’s fashion, includ-
ing fashion trends.
 MensFashion.About.com (mensfashion.
about.com): A men’s fashion and groom-
ing guide for today and tomorrow.
 Ask Andy About Clothes (www.askandy
aboutclothes.com): A popular and
comprehensive site devoted to men’s wear,
which includes a feature enabling you to
ask questions of an expert.

 Shoes: Shoes should look business-like and be dark colored — no
strappy shoes, sandals, or mile-high stilettos.
 Stockings: You can skip them for a business casual look.
 Make-up: Avoid wearing heavy makeup — on you or your collar line.
 Accessories: Leave flashy or distracting jewelry — dangly earnings,
clunky bracelets, giant, spiky rings that bruise fingers when shaking
hands — at home in your jewelry box. If you wear it, make sure your 
nail polish is fresh, unchipped, and in a classic color.
For men, a business casual checklist includes the following:
 Clothing: Don a sport jacket or blazer, especially navy blue, back or
gray, with color-coordinated long trousers or pressed khakis. Shirts
must have collars, be long-sleeved and tucked into pants; button-down
shirts are good but not mandatory.
 Shoes: Choose dress shoes and matching belt; loafers are acceptable.
 Socks: Wear dark socks that are mid-calf length.
 Ties: Choose simple (not too busy) ties for job interviews unless you
know from your research that a tie isn’t part of the uniform where 
you’re interviewing.
 Accessories: Limit jewelry to a conservative wristwatch. Removing ear-
rings is safest but check for the company culture.
Any interviewee, male or female, is better off steering clear of the following:
 Dark tinted glasses; sunglasses atop your head or front of collar
 Electronic devices (even on vibrate mode — the buzzing sound is 
annoying)
 Joke or fad watches
The Internet has been given a large chunk of credit/blame for shifting work-
place wear to more comfortable, less formal wardrobes, and I believe it. As
BusinessWeek Magazine says, “All those YouTube videos and MySpace pages
zipping back and forth on the ’Net have revived the (moribund) telecom
industry” and brought it back from the dead. If so, the ’Net certainly has the
power to spread the popularity of relaxed workplace dress codes.
Advance research is the only way to be on sure footing. You’re gambling if
you assume that you know what business casual means in your interview 
setting — or even whether you should dress in business casual. When in
doubt, scout it out.
135
Chapter 9: Costuming Yourself for a Starring Role

Aiming for casual wear
Casual work attire is suitable for hands-on working men and women. Often a
company uniform is required when you’re on the job, but when you’re in job
interview mode, the main thing to remember is to look neat and clean with no
holes or tears in your clothing. Colors and style don’t matter as much as they
do in conservative and business casual interview dressing, but your overall
appearance still counts a great deal.
Here’s a short checklist for men and women:
 Clothing: Shirts or knit tops and well-pressed pants are appropriate.
Avoid wrinkled or soiled clothing, and don’t wear t-shirts with writing 
on them.
 Shoes: Polished leather shoes or rubber-soled athletic shoes are fine.
Don’t choose grungy sneakers.
 Grooming: Make sure your hair and fingernails are neat and clean.
Heading for Fashion Frontiers
Most job-seekers interview in attire suggesting that they’re serious and cen-
tered in a business culture. But if you work in a creative environment, take
fashion risks and go for artistry, design consciousness, innovation, trendi-
ness, new styles and, yes, even whimsy.
You probably are way ahead of me and already follow high- and low-fashion
statements in magazines like Vogue and Marie Claire, GQ and Details. You
know what they say about fashion: in one year and out the other. So although

Don’t let them smell you first
Grooming has a strong influence on hiring deci-
sions. Who hasn’t nearly passed out after
smelling someone’s “salami” breath? Who
hasn’t been revolted by rank body odor? Who
hasn’t been turned off by spinach flecks on
teeth?
A recent survey of employers by the National
Association of Colleges and Employers fingered
being slovenly as an unacceptable sin. In fact,
73 percent of respondents said they don’t want
slovenly, smelly, dirt-ridden employees working
on the premises. 
Shower. Brush. Comb. Don’t make the inter-
viewer send out for a hazmat suit. 

I won’t attempt to compile a fashion checklist for either sex, here are two
classic possibilities for what men might wear when interviewing for a posi-
tion in a fashion-forward office:
 Turtlenecks and flat-front pants.
 A blazer or cashmere V-neck sweater and a shirt (or all three) atop
denim jeans.
Women? Plenty of fashion magazines show you what’s new in the fashion
world if you don’t already know.
In offices where employees are encouraged to show originality, a reasonably
creative look (not too far over the top) beats out conservative dress, and
maybe business casual as well. It’s all in the eye of the culture.
Guessing at Tomorrow’s Styles
As this chapter fades to black, I share a few forecasts gleaned from America’s
fashion observers:
 The era of the traditional suit is nearing an end.
 Business casual will become the new traditional dress in the workplace.
 Americans are moving toward a standard where there’s virtually no dif-
ference between what you wear during work and after hours.
These predictions hint at a developing new paradigm in work wear.
137
Chapter 9: Costuming Yourself for a Starring Role
No worse for wear
When you’ve no budget to burn but need 
quality-looking interview wardrobe items, why
not treasure hunt in resale shops? I checked 
out several such emporiums in Southern
California and found great bargains. And as
soon as I lose a few pounds. . . .
When you’ve no budget at all, seek free donated
workplace clothing, which is available to help
economically disadvantaged women acquire
and keep jobs. Dress for Success (www.dress
forsuccess.org) is a worldwide nonprofit
organization with chapters in many American
cities.
The Women’s Alliance (www.thewomens
alliance.org) is another national organi-
zation whose members provide professional
clothing and other services to low-income
women seeking employment.
Men seeking free gently used work clothing can
check for local “clothes closets,” usually
church-sponsored, by inquiring at public job
service offices.

Overcoming Stage Fright:
Rehearse, Rehearse, and
Rehearse
In This Chapter
 Staring down your jitters
 Learning to kick stress off the stage
 Perfecting your performance with a video camera
 Drilling best practices for any interview
 Staying a step ahead of the trapdoor crowd
You’re nervous. You have a queasy feeling, a mouthful of “ah” and “um”
cotton, and a rabbit pulse. You’re feeling jittery — from your shaking
knees and clammy palms to the tummy butterflies eroding your confidence
as you enter an interview.
In short, you have a galloping case of stage fright. Sound familiar? As Walter
Cronkite remarked, “It’s natural to have butterflies. The secret is to get them
to fly in formation.”
Beating Stage Fright to Pitch Better, Sell
Faster, and Ace More Interviews
You’re not alone in your nervousness. Most people start out with a case of
the shakes when interviewing or making a speech, including me. When I
began giving speeches, I could feel my throat drying up as panic fried my
memory banks. I knew I had to go out and orate to promote my media
careers column, but doing so was not fun.

One day I was in Florida addressing a group of career counselors when a
teacher with whom I shared a podium watched me shake my way through my
remarks. The teacher, herself an accomplished speaker, took me aside after
the program and delivered one of the best pieces of advice I’ve ever heard.
The teacher explained that nervousness is caused by the fear of looking
ridiculous to others:
“When you are nervous, you are focusing on yourself. Try to focus on how you
are helping other people by sharing with them the knowledge you’ve acquired.
You’ve been privileged to gather information not many people have. Think
about serving others, not about yourself when you’re up there on stage.”
Those words of wisdom were like a lifetime speech-making tranquilizer for
me. Thanks, Teach, for putting nervousness in perspective. How can you use
that perspective? Preparing for a job interview is not unlike preparing for a
speech or theatrical performance. The trick is to first get the kinks out of your
basic self-presentation, which you accomplish with plenty of rehearsals —
plenty of them.
After you get your basic act down pat, you will, of course, polish it with new
words before each interview — words you find by researching the interview-
ing company (see Chapter 6).
After you know your material cold — and how the skills you’re selling benefit
the potential employer — the outward-looking perspective kicks in. Divert
your attention to the needs of your audience. Concentrate on fulfilling the
interviewer’s needs.
Focus on your audience, not on yourself. Just as I found that focusing on the
audience is a giant step toward eliminating nervousness, so will you. 
Here’s a recap of the three critical steps you can take to deliver a compelling
and poised interview performance:
1. Polish your basic message.
Get your skills, competencies, and other qualifications down pat.
Rehearse until you’re comfortable answering questions and have prac-
ticed your basic presentation techniques.
2. Personalize each sales pitch.
Research each potential employer to customize your basic presentation
for each job.
3. Spotlight your audience.
Focus on how your talents can benefit your audience. Don’t focus on
yourself or worry about how imperfect you may appear.

More Techniques to Stop Stressing Out
When stars of the theater walk on stage, they claim the stage from wing to
wing, backdrop to footlights. With confidence and charisma, they win the
audience’s undivided interest. In a phrase, stars have stage presence. They
are comfortable on stage.
Performance advisers offer numerous suggestions to get your butterflies flying
like Air Force Blue Angels, ranging from relaxation techniques to visualization
exercises. Here’s a list of ideas that may be just what you need:
 Deep breaths are an instant stress reliever: Take a deep breath, breath-
ing from your toes all the way through your body, and then slowly
exhale. Repeat twice more for three deep breaths in all.
 Another simple technique: Clench your fists and hold for three to five
seconds. Release. Releasing your hands relaxes your shoulders and jaw.
Repeat three times.
 Push away anxiety: Go into a nearby restroom and lean into a wall like a
suspect being frisked in a cop show. Push hard, as though you would
like to push the wall down. Grunt as you push. It sounds funny, but try 
it — it works. Speech coaches say that when you push a wall and grunt,
you contract certain muscles, which in turn reduces anxiety. Don’t let
anyone see you do this exercise, though — heaven knows what an
observer might think other than you’re loony tunes.
 Visualize the outcome you want: Top athletes often use visualization
techniques to calm jitters, improve concentration and boost athletic per-
formance. They picture in their mind opponents’ actions and strategy,
and then picture to counter their maneuver. A golfer may run a movie in
his head of where he wants the ball to go before he takes a swing. For an
interview, you can visualize meeting the interviewer, answering and
asking questions, closing the interview well (see Chapter13) or even
being offered the job on the spot (See Chapter 14).
 Combine relaxation with visualization: Visualize a quiet beautiful scene,
such as a green valley filled with wild flowers, or a soothing garden with
a waterfall. Inhale, thinking “I am.” Exhale, thinking “calm.” Breathe at
least 12 times. Next, recall a successful interview experience.
Free your mind of personal worries to concentrate on the subject of your job
interview. If your personal concerns can’t be handled immediately — and
most can’t — write them down and promise yourself that you’ll deal with
them after your job interview.
141
Chapter 10: Overcoming Stage Fright: Rehearse, Rehearse, and Rehearse

Practicing with a Video Camera
Discover yourself through an employer’s eyes. With a friend feeding you practice
questions, work with a video camera. An audio tape recorder is useful, but isn’t
in the same league as being able to see as well as hear yourself in interviewing
action.
Taping a practice session enables you to see how— with image improvement
and mannerism modification — you can look alert, competent, and confident.
You can refine actions that turn hiring on and eliminate those that turn hiring
off. Rehearse nonverbal as well as spoken messages, and keep an eye out for
the following image-detracting actions:
 Leg swinging
 Foot tapping
 Rocking from side to side
 Fiddling with your hair
 Waving around nervous hands
 Leaning back
 Crossing your arms
 Bowing your head frequently
 Darting your eyes
 Blinking slowly (comes across as disinterest or slow thinking)
142
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
Rehearsing out loud
Practice speaking aloud the messages you plan
to deliver at your job interview — such as a list-
ing of your five top skills, how you will answer
questions (Chapters 18 through 24), and how
you will ask questions (Chapter 11).
Why not just silently read your message state-
ments over and over? Coaching experts say
rehearsing information helps fix content in your
mind. Rehearsing your statements at least five
times makes them yours.
Yes, that’s a lot of repetition, but remember this:
Rehearsing five times beats the time frame of a
famous orator in ancient Greece. Demosthenes
worked to improve his elocution by talking with
pebbles in his mouth and reciting verses while
running along the seashore over the roar of the
waves. Supposedly Demosthenes also went
into a cave to learn oratory skills. Not having a
watch or calendar (and unable to use a sundial
in a cave) Demosthenes shaved off the hair on
half of his head and didn’t come out until it grew
back three months later. When he finally came
out, listeners gladly lent him their ears because
he was the man with the golden tonsils. (Brad
Pitt is rumored to be first choice to play
Demosthenes.)

 Touching your mouth constantly
 Forgetting to smile
Use the following techniques to put your readiest foot forward:
 Look interested when you’re seated by leaning slightly forward with the
small of your back against the chair.
 Look the interviewer squarely in the nose, and you appear to be making
eye contact. You look open and honest. More earnest honesty is commu-
nicated by upturned, open palms.
 Pause and think before answering a question to seem thoughtful and
unflappable.
 Refer to your notes, and you’re seen as one who covers all the bases.
Just don’t make the mistake of holding onto your notes like they’re a 
life preserver.
 If you find your voice sounds tight and creaky on tape, try warming up
before an interview or your next practice run: Sing in the shower or in
your car on the way to the interview. La la la la. . . . Maybe you shouldn’t
sing on the bus.
Stage Directions for All Players
As you rehearse your interviewing presentation, aim for the A-list of candi-
dates by heeding the following hints:
 Practice focusing your discussion on the employer’s needs; show that
you understand those needs, that you possess the specific skills to
handle the job, and that you are in sync with the company culture.
 Don’t discuss previous rejections — you come off as a constant audition
reject.
 Make eye contact, but don’t try for a laser lock on the interviewer. Imagine
two cats in a staring contest — in the animal kingdom, nobody moves
until somebody swats. Break the tension — periodically look away.
 Develop and practice justifiably proud statements of your accomplishments
that relate to the job you want.
 Practice descriptions of your leadership qualities and initiative.
 If pressed, you can admit you’ve made a mistake in your career (when
was it — 3:48 p.m. on June 14, 2003?), but rehearse satisfying explana-
tions of how you learned from your one mistake — or two or three.
 Don’t practice long monologues — be fair: Split air time with your 
interviewer.
143
Chapter 10: Overcoming Stage Fright: Rehearse, Rehearse, and Rehearse

Anticipating Interview Trapdoors
No matter how well you’re doing as you sail through an interview, certain
things can throw you off balance if you’re not forewarned. Rehearse handling
the situations in the upcoming sections.
Disruptions
As you rehearse, keep in mind that not everything that happens during the
interview is related to you. Your meeting may be interrupted by a ringing tele-
phone, the interviewer’s coworkers, or even the interviewer’s needs. Add
some interference to your mock interviews. Because the show must go on,
find methods to politely overlook these interruptions with patient concentra-
tion. Practice keeping a tab on what you’re discussing between disruptions in
case the interviewer doesn’t.
Silent treatment
Interviewers sometimes use silence strategically. Moments of silence are
intended to get candidates to answer questions more fully — and even to get
them to blurt out harmful information they had no intention of revealing.
Instead of concentrating on your discomfort during these silences, recognize
the technique. Either wait out the silence until the interviewer speaks, or fill
it with a well-chosen question (see Chapter 11) that you have tucked up your
sleeve. Don’t bite on the silent treatment ploy, panic, and spill information
that doesn’t advance your cause.
Turning the tables, you can use your own silence strategy to encourage the
interviewer to elaborate or to show that you’re carefully considering issues
under discussion.
Never should the unnecessary be volunteered by the unwary for the 
unforgiving.
Take One . . . Take Two . . . Take Three . . .
Practice your scenes until they feel right, until they feel spontaneous.
Rehearsing gives you the power to become a confident communicator with
the gift of presence. No more nervousness, no more zoning out. Your butter-
flies fly in formation.

Looking Good with 
Questions You Ask
In This Chapter
 Asking work questions before the offer
 Asking personal questions after the offer
 Drawing out hidden objections
 Treading lightly around delicate questions
 Finishing with the right question
S
o you just finished answering a seemingly endless line of questions about
your work history and your education, and you’re pretty confident that
you held your own. Now the interviewer turns to you and asks, “Do you have
any questions?” This question is your cue to ask how much money you’re
gonna make at this outfit anyway, right? Wrong!
The types of questions you ask and when you ask them are the least under-
stood parts of the interview. Your questions offer major chances for garnering
curtain calls or being booed off the stage. Sort your question opportunities
into two categories:
 Questions that sell you: These questions help you get an offer; they’re 
a way to sell without selling.
 Questions that address your personal agenda: These questions about
pay, benefits, and other self-interest items should be asked only after
you receive an offer — or at least a heavy hint of an offer.
Asking Selling Questions before the Offer
For all jobs, asking about anything other than work issues before a hiring 
offer comes your way is a serious strategic error. The interviewer, particularly

a hiring manager who resents the time “diverted” to an interview, doesn’t give
two figs about your needs at this point.
What’s important to the interviewer is solving the hiring problem. First we
decide, then we deal — that’s the thinking.
To talk about your needs before an offer turns the interviewer’s mind to nega-
tive thoughts: All you want is money, insurance, and a nice vacation on the
company. You’re not interested in doing the job.
As an Applause candidate, you’re not going to make that mistake. Keep your
focus on the employer’s needs and how you can meet them. Sell yourself by
asking questions that are
 Work-focused
 Task-focused
 Function-focused
Ask about the position’s duties and challenges. Ask what outcomes you’re
expected to produce. Ask how the position fits into the department, and 
the department into the company. Ask about typical assignments. Here are
examples of work-related questions:
 What would be my first three goals if I were hired for this position?
 What would my key responsibilities be?
 How many and whom would I supervise? To whom would I report?
 Will I be working as a member of a team?
 What percentage of time will I spend communicating with customers,
coworkers, and managers?
 Will on-job training be required for a new product?
 Can you describe a typical day?
 If I produce double my quota will you double my base pay?
 Was the last person in this job promoted? What’s the potential for promotion?
 How would you describe the atmosphere here? Formal and traditional?
Energetically informal?
 Where is the company headed? Merger? Growth?
 What would my first project be?
 What type of training would I receive?
 What resources would I have to do the job?
148
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

 How much would I travel, if any?
 (If a contract job) Do you anticipate extensive overtime to finish the project
on schedule?
 Where does this position fit into the company’s organizational structure?
 What results would you expect from my efforts and on what timetable? What
improvements need to be made on how the job has been done until now?
How much time should you invest in asking selling questions? Five to ten
minutes is not too much. Gregory J. Walling, a top executive recruiter in
Alexandria, Va., says he’s never heard an employer complain about a 
candidate being too interested in work.
Don’t ask questions about information you can glean from research. 
And don’t ask questions that could cause the interviewer to wonder when
you were melted from a glacier, such as quizzing an interviewer from Google, 
“Do you make money from anything other than your search engine?”
Asking Self-Interest Questions 
after the Offer
When you have the offer, you’re ready to make the switch from giving to 
receiving information. I discuss negotiating salary and benefits in Chapter 8,
but you’ll also want to know about things like leave time, overtime, flextime,
frequency of performance reviews, and (if it’s a contract job) how long the job
will last. Asking personal agenda questions in advance of an offer is dangerous,
but after the offer, let fly with questions such as these eight examples:
 Your company culture seems fairly unstructured. Is my impression correct?
 What problems might I face in this job?
 Is my future relocation a possibility?
 Is my employee parking included in the offer?
 Does management delegate decision-making to others, or does it micro-
manage — requiring that I get approval of even the tiniest details?
 Where would I work in the building? Could I take a look at the location for
a minute?
 Is the schedule fixed (such as 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) or is it flexible (my choice
of hours)?
 Would I have an exempt (from overtime pay) or non-exempt position?
149
Chapter 11: Looking Good with Questions You Ask

Drawing Out Hidden Objections
The questions you ask have one more mission in the interview: They’re a
good way to bring concerns or objections to the table that the interviewer
may not want to verbalize.
Why doesn’t the interviewer want to raise certain issues?
Reasons that employers hang back with unspoken anxieties usually relate 
to legal vulnerability (see Chapter 24 on inappropriate questions), or the
interviewer may simply be uncomfortable asking about them.
Whatever the reason, silent concerns are hurdles standing in the way of your
getting the job. Before the interview is over, you need to find a way to address
the thorny issues and overcome them.
Good salespeople call techniques that do this drawing out objections. Once
you know the issues you’re dealing with, try to calm anxieties that keep you
from being hired.
Ask the interviewer questions that create openings for her to find the answers
she wants but can’t figure out how to find without getting hauled into an
inquiry by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.
Here are a pair of examples of easing an interviewer’s hidden concerns by
bringing up a legally risky topic:
In your place, I’d probably be wondering how my children are cared for
during the day. I may be concerned that I’d miss work should they become
ill. Let me explain my very reliable child care arrangements to you . . .
If I were you, seeing on my resume that I have spent a great deal of time in
Paris, I may be questioning my legal residency and, green card or no green
card, whether I plan to stay in Chicago long enough to complete this project.
Let me assure you . . .
150
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
Ask with confidence
Be aware of how you phrase questions. Ask “what
would” questions that presume you’ll be offered
the job (“What would my key responsibilities be?”
Not, “What are the job’s key responsibilities?”).
Presumption-phrasing shows self-confidence and
subtly encourages the interviewer to visualize you
in the position.

As I see it, your basic choices are to allow an employer to make assumptions
about you or to control the unspoken problem by telling the employer what
you want known about the situation.
After hidden objections see daylight, you have a chance to shoo away 
elephants in the room that are standing between you and a job offer.
Asking Certain Questions Very Carefully
Handle questions to potential employers about their own performance with
great tact — especially when a millennium generation candidate asks them of a
boomer generation boss. Proceed with caution into territory like the following:
 How would you describe your management style?
 Do your employees admire you as a boss?
Although you need as much information as possible to make good job choices,
asking a potential boss these kinds of questions in the wrong tone of voice may
make you seem way too audacious. Moreover, direct questions about personal
characteristics and values tend to elicit pure topspin.

concerning future plans, that you squared
the round table, using your supercom-
puter’s component play box, and found your
sandbox is 95 percent superior to the
market’s; does this mean you plan to circle
an outer galaxy and return to earth on
Greenwich mean time?
Huh? Research is essential, but guard against flaunt-
ing your newly found knowledge with questions 
that might give Einstein a little trouble. Interviewers
interpret these questions as a transparent bid to 
look smart.
But, you ask, shouldn’t you look “smart” at an
interview? Yes, just don’t cross the fine line that
exists between being well researched and fully
prepared for an interview, and trying to be a
nouveau omniscient. (Don’t you love that term?
It means newly informed know-it-all.)
Showing off is a quality that causes otherwise
charming, bright, gregarious, and attractive
people to be turned down. It’s just not a likable
trait. If you don’t have a good handle on what is
and what isn’t showing off, maybe a friend can
help you work on that distinction.

Instead, ask questions designed to draw out companywide anecdotal answers:
 How did the company handle a recent downsizing?
 How did managers react to someone who took a stand on principle?
 Who are the company’s heroes?
This approach encourages conversation that can be very informative.
Questions are tools. Use them wisely.
Ending Suspense by Asking 
the Right Question
Page ahead to Chapter 13 and you see a lineup of fundamental questions to 
ask at the end of each interview. Want another option for immediate feedback?
When your meeting has sailed smoothly along and you’d like to know your
odds right now but don’t want to appear overconfident or too anxious, ask the
right question:
Should I assume you’d like me to continue in the interviewing process? 
[yes] What would the next step be?
[no] I’m sorry to hear that. Could you tell me why I won’t be in the running?
(If you can overcome the objections, give it a try; if not, thank the
interviewer for the time spent with you and move on.)
When you don’t hear the yes word, at least you won’t be holding your breath 
to know whether this particular work opportunity is a lost cause. If the no word
sparks a serious state of doldrums, break out an effective mood elevator — 
hot fudge sundae? funny movie? upbeat music?

t’s showtime! This chapter contrasts the choices made by two contenders
for a middle management job in a conservative establishment. (The same
kinds of interview scenario choices apply for virtually any type of job.)
For this tale of two job seekers, I’ve created a pair of characters, loser Cory 
and winner Chris. Visualize Cory’s inept interview tactics and Chris’s
spectacular moves. 
The Day Before
The day before an important interview is the day to prepare. You have a
choice. You can let the jitters send you into a tailspin, or you can take steps
to turn your nervousness into excitement and energy.
ShowStoppers
Chris begins the day before to prep for an interview at 11 o’clock the next
morning. Chris visits the employer’s Web site, paying special attention to 
the recruitment videos, noting how employees dress. After getting a handle
on the company’s costuming culture, Chris decides on a charcoal suit and
rushes it to the neighborhood cleaners for a quick press. He polishes his
black shoes. Next, Chris double-checks the requisite briefcase for five copies
of his targeted resume that won the interview. (See my book, Resumes For
Dummies, 5th Edition.)

Then Chris verifies routing and parking directions. He carefully reviews lists
of job-related questions he will ask and scopes out questions the interviewer
can be expected to ask. Finally, Chris goes over how his qualifications —
including skills and accomplishments — match the position’s requirements.
He’s ready to engage the interviewer. Finally, Chris gets a full night’s sleep.
Clunkers and bloopers
Cory’s interview is set for ten o’clock the next morning. A nervous wreck 
the night before showtime, Cory decides a few drinks at the local bar would
be calming. Tomorrow morning is soon enough to get his interviewing act
together — he thinks.
Critic’s review
To give yourself the best shot at a ShowStopper interview
 Get everything ready the day before.
 Become familiar in advance with the route you will travel to the interview.
 As you travel to the interview, visualize yourself as someone about to be
hired. As though you were starring in a movie, run interviewing images
through your mind. Imagine the stories you’ll tell and the impressed look
on your interviewer’s face as you ask your own questions and present
your own commercial of qualifications. Float pictures through your head
about the scenario as you wish it to be.
 Imagine yourself being at ease, radiating sincerity, credibility, energy,
enthusiasm, and competence. You act the way you think.
Opening the Interview
As the actors find their places on the job-interview scene, all the building
blocks of the actor’s preparation come together. Lights . . . camera . . . action!
ShowStoppers
Chris arrives 10 minutes before show time and makes polite small talk with the
receptionist. The receptionist buzzes the interviewer, who comes to the lobby
to greet Chris. As they walk through a hallway toward the interviewer’s office,
Chris breaks the ice by saying nice things about the pictures on the wall.
154
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Once inside the interviewer’s office, Chris smiles and returns a firm hand-
shake to the interviewer. Chris’s eyes sweep the room, looking for some
mutual interest (sports, colleges, or travel mementos) and spots a baseball
picture of the Yankees on the wall. Chris doesn’t sit until invited.
For a moment, Chris feels jittery. Then Chris thinks about CNN’s John
Roberts and CBS’s Katie Couric, who always seem to have everything under
control. Chris takes a deep breath and feels poise return.
The interviewer is distracted with Chris’s resume, but to keep the momentum
going, asks a few questions. Chris glides right into strong answers — stressing
the good fit between his skills and the job’s requirements. Chris makes a
mental note to repeat that information as soon as the interviewer’s full spot-
light is away from the resume and on him in the flesh.
Clunkers and bloopers
Cory scrambles into the office wearing a super-trendy outfit topped by hair
stiff with mousse. Conservative managers see Cory as being “too much” —
“not one of us.”
Arriving late after losing the way to the interview, an unsmiling Cory rushes to
the receptionist’s desk and, without bothering to greet the receptionist, asks
for the interviewer. The receptionist hurries Cory to the interviewing office.
The interviewer glances up and calmly asks, Do you know that you’re 25 min-
utes late? Nervously, Cory sits down, uninvited, and mutters, Yeah, sorry. I got
stuck in that stupid traffic jam that always happens on the bridge, and then I got
totally lost. I guess I should have started earlier.
The interviewer responds, Uh-huh. Well, before we begin, I seem to have mis-
placed your resume — do you have an extra copy? Flustered, Cory says, Sorry,
no. Because you already had a copy, I didn’t bring another.
Critic’s review
When making your entrance, keep these tips in mind:
 Dress as though you belong where you’re interviewing.
 Be friendly to all office staffers — they’ll discuss you openly after you
leave.
 Wait for the interviewer to initiate a handshake and then make your
handshake a firm one.
155
Chapter 12: Outlining Interview Scenarios You Can Expect

 Make several copies of your resume in case you’re asked for a copy.
More likely, you’ll be introduced to others who have a say in the hiring
decision — leave one with each important person you meet.
 Stand until invited to sit.
 When you feel a sudden case of nerves, learn from the dramatic arts.
Think of yourself as a favorite media personality who is cool, calm, 
collected, and confident.
During the Interview
Research and rehearsal grow confidence in actors and job interviewees. R&R
ensures that they know their lines and moves. It turns interviews into fairly
predictable auditions.
ShowStoppers
As the busy interviewer skims Chris’s resume, Chris comments on the Yankees’
baseball picture — the interviewer and Chris are “alike,” which results in a
bonding experience. Right away, the interviewer subliminally thinks — I like
this person! Let’s see what else Chris has to offer.
As soon as Chris has the interviewer’s attention, Chris asks
I wonder if you can confirm my understanding of this position. What are the
job’s most important duties, and what kind of person do you see as being
best suited for it?
The interviewer begins the questioning portion of the interview with — Could
you tell me about yourself? After a thinking pause, Chris skillfully builds into
his one-minute memorized commercial (see Chapter 18) that shows he’s the
company’s ideal employee for the target position. Chris focuses on skills and
accomplishments.
Chris can smell a job offer coming when suddenly the interviewer falls deathly
silent — the kind of silence that makes most people uncomfortable enough to
blabber and say silly things. But when Chris is satisfied with the information
delivered, he falls silent, too, and waits for the interviewer to respond. But 
the interviewer, an old hand at playing the silence card, remains mute. Finally,
Chris asks — Would you like me to tell you more about my skills in working with
other people?
Secretly impressed that Chris is nobody’s fool, the interviewer asks what
Chris knows about the company’s products and organization. The question
156
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

session turns into a kind of fact-trading mini-workshop. Chris successfully
engaged the interviewer. Both participants feel good about the meeting.
Clunkers and bloopers
After finding and studying Cory’s resume while Cory sits quietly, the inter-
viewer asks — What can you tell me about yourself?
Cory begins to ramble — Um . . . I mean, like it says on my resume, I just got
my degree from UTC . . . Um . . . I graduated summa cum laude . . . and . . . well,
you know, I’m looking for a job. I was born in Kansas City, Missouri . . . but, my
mother was in the Marines, and so we traveled a lot . . . I like tennis . . . I know I
can do this job . . . what else would you like to know?
Cory picks up a letter opener from the interviewer’s desk and begins to fiddle
with it.
Critic’s review
Use these tips to give an award-winning performance:
 Anticipate, prepare for, and rehearse challenging questions.
 Take note of the interviewer’s personal items in the office as you try 
to establish rapport, but never touch anything.
 Ask the question that reveals the key to the entire interview — What is
the scope of the position and what are the qualifications of the ideal person
for it? And then work it into your answer, starting with your personal
commercial.
 Recognize that an interviewer’s silence can move you to speak before
you think. When things become too tense, ask a job-related question to
parade your skills.
Sizing Up Audience Reaction
If an actor is doing comedy and no one’s laughing, the actor needs to change
the lines or the delivery. Similarly, if you notice your audience (a potential
employer) is disinterested, try to switch the subject and save the show.
How can you tell how your act is going over? Watch for obvious signs of 
inattention: The interviewer’s eyes are glazed over, or the interviewer fiddles
with desk objects, for example.
157
Chapter 12: Outlining Interview Scenarios You Can Expect

ShowStoppers
Following the main question segment of the interview, Chris’s interviewer
lapses into lengthy praise of the company and the job. But, unlike Cory’s expe-
rience, the body of the interview had gone wonderfully well, and Chris realizes
that an offer is imminent. The interviewer isn’t just filling time talking about
the company — the interviewer is selling Chris!
Chris smiles and listens attentively.
The interviewer does have a few concerns — Will Chris be able to handle the
travel the job requires? This job calls for about two days of travel a week, but
the requirement is flexible. Will that be a problem?
Chris overcomes the concern by expressing a genuine interest in traveling
and then re-encapsulates the other strengths that point toward a perfect job-
applicant match. The interviewer’s relief shows — Then the commute won’t be
a problem for you?
Absolutely not! Chris confirms.
Clunkers and bloopers
Cory’s interviewer spends a lot of time discussing the company and the job
and asks very few questions — the interviewer is filling time until Cory can
be decently dumped; the interviewer has already lost interest. Cory still has 
a slim chance of putting the interview back on track, but Cory doesn’t notice
the warning signals of disinterest.
Cory misses nonverbal clues, too: When the bored interviewer begins tapping
fingers on the desk, Cory doesn’t say — Would you rather hear more about my
computer programming work or my international marketing studies? Cory doesn’t
notice two more negative body-language signals when the interviewer crosses
arms and leans back.
To top it off, Cory fails to observe how the interviewer is phrasing judgments,
clearly implying that Cory is not under consideration. The interviewer says —
Many people have a problem handling all the travel required; frankly, the 
traveling is too heavy a burden.
Cory nixes all chances at salvaging the job opportunity by agreeing — Yeah, I’m
really not much for travel. I like to stick around home with my friends and family.
Cory has never understood that once you’re in a hole, it’s time to stop digging.
158
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

Critic’s review
Follow these tips to keep your interviewer’s attention:
 Pay close attention to your audience. Observe body language. Note sub-
ject matter and how comments are phrased.
 When you think the decision on you is thumbs down, try a last-chance
statement:
Because I’m very interested in this job, I want to be sure that you have all
the information you need to make a positive decision on my candidacy.
Would you be interested in hearing more about my — ?
 Note how interviewers ask touchy questions. The interviewers phrased
the question about travel negatively in Cory’s interview and positively in
Chris’s interview. The negative shading implied that Cory just didn’t fit
the job. Take a hint or move to overcome objections.
 Avoid money talk until you have a job offer. Money wasn’t a factor in the
examples of Cory and Chris because the interviewer didn’t raise the
issue. (See Chapter 8.)
Ending the Interview
Put the finishing touches on your ShowStopper routine as the interview curtain
begins to fall. Find out about the coming attractions of future contacts and
prop open the stage door for your return.
ShowStoppers
Chris notices the interviewer glancing occasionally at the office clock before
saying — Thanks for coming in, I’ll notify you when we make a decision.
Chris refuses to fade into the sunset and grabs for a follow-up interview: 
I’m sure you have a busy schedule, and I appreciate your time. Thank you.
But before we close today, could I make sure I understand what you’re
looking for?
Chris wraps up with a superb 60-second recap of the job’s description and
requirements, matching them directly. The theme is “you want, I deliver.” After
this short monologue, Chris offers the interviewer the floor:
159
Chapter 12: Outlining Interview Scenarios You Can Expect

Do you see any gaps between what you need and what I’m offering?
The interviewer mentions one deficiency in Chris’s skills profile — a lack of
supervisory experience. Chris immediately counters with two stories of managing
huge special events for a church organization and a campus club, both of
which required supervisory duties. Chris hadn’t had paid supervisory
experience, but the compensatory answer beat no answer at all.
As Chris and the interviewer shake hands, the interviewer implies that Chris
is well-suited for the position, but that there’s a pool of candidates yet to be
interviewed. Chris asks: When do you expect to make a decision or to schedule
follow-up interviews?
As the interviewer answers and shakes hands, Chris has a final question —
Can I get back to you to get an update on your timeline?
Feel free to call me, the interviewer responds, thinking — This candidate has
plenty on the ball.
Clunkers and bloopers
Cory tries to stretch the interview with small talk — chiefly personal informa-
tion not related to the job — while the interviewer is making an obvious effort
to leave by gathering papers, rising, and walking toward the door. Cory finally
gets the picture and anxiously asks — So, do I get the job?
Cory’s desperation adds to the interviewer’s doubts. The interviewer decides
to end the misery — Sorry, you don’t really fit the needs of this job.
Hurt and offended, Cory demands to know why — Hey, I’ve got the right college
degree. What’s wrong with me?
Critic’s review
To end the interview on the right note, follow these tips:
 Interviewers get the message that a desperate candidate is a bottom-of-
the-barrel candidate.
 Learn sales closing techniques; those who don’t learn to close a sale don’t
get job offers. (And make no mistake about it, you’re selling yourself in an
interview.)
 Watch the interviewer’s body language closely for signs that the interview
should end. Take the hint. Arguing wastes everyone’s time.
160
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

 Expecting that an educational or experience credential is all you need to
get the job is a mistake.
 Summarize your best-selling points one last time for the interviewer.
 Leave the door open for a follow-up contact.
After the Interview
You get one last chance to make the interview memorable. Your follow-up
work is an opportunity to write a happy ending to your job-search scenario.
ShowStoppers
After leaving the interviewer’s office, Chris immediately writes down every-
thing that happened, including the main points Chris made, the interviewer’s
name, line of questioning, areas of interest, and the timelines of the hiring
process.
Then Chris writes the interviewer a thank-you letter. Chapter 13 tells you
more about marketing yourself in a thank-you letter.
Clunkers and bloopers
Cory promptly writes off the interviewing company as unfair and erases from
memory all that happened during the interview.
Because Cory hasn’t learned from these mistakes, Cory’s other interviews
won’t go much better.
Critic’s review
To make the most of every interview, follow these tips:
 Turn every interview into a learning experience.
 Note what you learned in the interview (such as names and additional
aspects of the company new to you) for your next contact with the 
interviewer.
 Note points discussed. Did you leave out significant selling points? Add
them to your thank-you letter.

Pre-Interview Checklist
Want to be sure that you’ll do everything you can to stop the show? Use 
this pre-interview checklist to get yourself prepped for a ShowStopper 
performance.
❑
Have you reviewed the requirements for this position? Can you identify
which of your qualifications are most relevant for this position?
❑
Did you research the position, company, and industry? (See Chapter 6.)
❑
Do you know how people dress where you’re interviewing? (See 
Chapter 9, and the section “The Day Before” in this chapter.)
❑
Is your interviewing costume clean, pressed, and ready to go?
❑
Do you know where the interviewing site is located and how long it takes
to get there?
❑
Have you memorized a short commercial to highlight your best selling
points? (See Chapters 18.)
❑
Have you rehearsed everything, from small talk to answering potentially
dangerous questions? (See Chapter 10.)
❑
Have you practiced answers to anticipated questions? (See Part IV.)
❑
Have you prepared and memorized a list of questions to ask? (See
Chapter 11.)
❑
Have you researched the market salary for the position? (See Chapter 8.)
❑
Did you gather everything you need? (Five copies of your resume, list of
references, and samples of your work, if necessary.)
Once you knock each question off this checklist, stop cramming and relax.
Otherwise, you’ll suffer stage fright. Enter your interview with confidence.
You’ve done ShowStopper preparation for a ShowStopper interview!

ou sense it’s almost time to go. The interview seems to be winding
down. In most instances, a job offer doesn’t come at this point.
How can you be sure the interview is almost over? Watch for these nonverbal
clues: The interviewer may begin shuffling papers, glancing at a wall clock 
or watch, and, perhaps, standing up. Then you hear words that confirm 
your hunch:
 Thanks for coming in. We’ll be interviewing more candidates through the
next week or so. After that, I’ll probably get back to you about a second
interview.
 Thanks for talking with me. I think your qualifications make you a definite
candidate for this position. Once I’m done with all the initial interviews, I’ll
get back to you.
 All your input has been really helpful. Now that I know everything I need 
to know about you, do you have any questions about the company or the
position? (Careful — ask only job-related questions — you don’t have 
the offer; see Chapter 11.)
In this chapter, I show you how to walk out of the interview without walking
out of the race.

Making a Strategic Exit
Don’t go away from a job interview empty-handed. Rather than quietly fading
into history, remember what you found out in this book:
 Never leave a job interview with a zipped lip. Immerse your departure in
verbal persuaders and interactive selling. The latter is a term that sales
professionals use to mean a great deal of back and forth, give and take,
and questions and answers. (See Chapters 11 and 18-–23.)
 Never leave a job interview without reprising your qualifications and the
benefits you bring to the job. You’re a great match, a wonderful fit!
 Never leave a job interview without knowing what happens next.
 Never leave a job interview without propping open the door for your
follow-up.
Your parting sales pitch
Haven’t you sold yourself enough during this ShowStopper interview? Yes
and no. People — including interviewers — often forget what they hear. Start
your close with another chorus of your five best skills. (See Chapter 18 for
answers to the question, “Why should I hire you?”) Then ask
Do you see any gaps between my qualifications and the requirements for
the job?
Based on what we’ve discussed today, do you have any concerns about my
ability to do well in this job? Any reservations about hiring me?
You’re looking for gaps and hidden objections so that you can make them
seem insignificant. But if the gaps aren’t wide and the objections not lethal 
to your candidacy, attempt to overcome stated shortcomings. You can make
this attempt based on what you found out in your earlier research. Here’s an
effective formula you can use to engage the interviewer (see Chapter 2):
1. Sell your qualifications (benefits — chiefly skills).
2. Ask for objections.
3. Listen carefully.
4. Overcome objections.
5. Restate your qualifications (using different words).
After you restate your benefits, you may find the time is ripe to reaffirm your
interest in the job. Here’s one way:
164
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

I hope I’ve answered your concerns on the X issue. Do you have further ques-
tions or issues about my background, qualifications, or anything else at this
point? This job and I sound like a terrific match.
If it seems appropriate, try to lead subtly toward an offer.
I hope you agree that this position has my name on it. As I understand, your
position requires X, and I can deliver X; your position requires Y, and I can
deliver Y; your position requires Z, and I can deliver Z.
So there seems to be a good match here! Don’t you think so?
I’m really glad I had the chance to talk with you. I know that with what I
learned at Violet Tech when I established its Internet Web site, I could set up
an excellent Web site for you, too.
Leaving the door open
How can you tape the door open for a follow-up? You seek the interviewer’s
permission to call back; with permission, you won’t seem intrusive. Use these
statements as models to gain the permission:
What is the next step in the hiring process, and when do you expect to make 
a decision? (You’re trying to get a sense of the timetable.)
I’m quite enthusiastic about this position. When and how do we take the 
next step?
May I feel free to call if I have further questions?
I know you’re not done reviewing candidates; when can I reach you to check
up on the progress of your search?
I understand you’ll call me back after you’ve seen every candidate for this 
position; would you mind if I call you for an update or if I have more ques-
tions?
I appreciate the time you spent with me; I know you’re going to be really
busy recruiting, so when can I call you?
I look forward to that second interview you mentioned — can I call you later
to schedule it after my work hours so I don’t have to throw off my current
employer’s schedule?
In the final moments, be certain to express thanks to the interviewer for 
the time spent with you. Say it with a smile, eye-to-nose, and a firm but gentle
handshake: It looks like a terrific opportunity — I look forward to hearing from
you. Don’t linger.
165
Chapter 13: Closing the Show

As soon as you’re alone at a place where you can make notes, write a summary
of the meeting. Concentrate especially on material for your follow-up moves,
described later in this chapter.
How Aggressive Should You Be?
How hard you should sell and how eager you should be depends on such
things as age, critical experience, and the level of the job you’re seeking. No
behavior is perfect for every person and every situation.
If you’re in a sales field, just starting out, lack experience in a job’s require-
ments, or aren’t obviously superior to your competition, don’t hold back on
selling your advantages or showing your enthusiasm.
If you have relevant experience and offer in-demand skills or are being con-
sidered for a senior-level job, allow yourself to be wooed a bit. You don’t
want to be seen as jumping at every opportunity. It’s the old story: The more
anxious you seem, the less money you’re offered.
When the gap between your qualifications and the job’s requirements is the
size of the Grand Canyon, accept the fact that the job will go to someone else.
Suppose, for instance, that the position requires five years’ experience, includ-
ing two years of supervisory experience. You thought you could talk your way
through the gap with your three years of total experience and no years of
supervisory experience. Fat chance!
When you just don’t have the chops for the position, salvage your time and
effort by acknowledging that although you may not be ideal for this particu-
lar position, interviewing for it has caused you to admire the company and
you’d appreciate being contacted if a better match comes along.
Follow Up or Fall Behind
What takes place after the first interview — when candidates are ranked —
decides who has the inside track on winning the job.
166
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
Recruiters follow up for you
You don’t have to follow up with the employer 
when you were introduced to the company by a
recruiter or employment consultant — the recruiter
or consultant follows up for you, negotiating the 
offer or turndown. Usually, you can get a report card
from your recruiter or consultant fairly quickly.

Your follow-up may be the tiebreaker that gives you the win over other
promising candidates. And even if the employer already planned to offer you
the job, your follow-up creates goodwill that kick-starts your success when
you join the company.
Follow up vigorously. It’s your caring that counts.
Your basic tools are
 Letters
 E-mails
 Telephone calls
 References
Letters
How much do post-interview thank-you letters really impact hiring decisions?
When they’re canned, flat, and “Dear-Aunt-Martha-thanks-for-the-graduation-
gift” boring, interviewers may see them as a snore.
But when you’re in a classy field of candidates, each trying to race through
the stretch for the win, skipping a dynamic marketing-tool-of-a-thanks-letter 
is unwise.
In constructing a thank-you letter that actually does you some good, use the
same powerful concepts that you would for a targeted resume that directly
matches your qualifications with the job’s requirements (Read my book,
Resumes For Dummies, 5th Edition; Wiley, 2007.) 
The resume and the thank-you letter are book-ends for your interview: The
resume is the “before” communicator of your high-value qualifications and
the thank-you letter is the “after” chance to market yourself for the win.
Your resume content and interview performance sold you as being a great fit
for the job with tit for tat in qualifications and interest, punctuated with true
and lively tales of accomplishments. Don’t stop the winning streak that got you
this far — build on it! Here are sales pointers for your thank-you letter aimed at
converting your candidacy into a job offer:
 Express appreciation for the interviewer’s time and for giving you a fresh
update on the organization’s immediate direction.
 Remind the interviewer of what specifically you can do for a company, 
not what a company can do for you. As you did in closing your interview,
draw verbal links between a company’s immediate needs and your qualifi-
cations: “You want X, I offer X; you want Y, I offer Y; you want Z, I offer Z.”
167
Chapter 13: Closing the Show

 Repeat your experience in handling concerns that were discussed during
the interview. Write very brief paragraphs about how you solved 
problems of interest to the company.
 After researching an issue that the company is wrestling with, include a
concise statement of your findings, perhaps even enclosing a relevant
news clip about the matter.
 Tie up loose ends by adding information to a question you didn’t handle
well during the interview.
 Overcome objections the interviewer expressed about offering you 
the job. For example, if the job has an international component and the
interviewer was concerned that you have never worked in Europe or
Asia, explain in your letter that you have worked in the Caribbean and 
in Mexico and that you are proven to be productive in other cultures.
 Reaffirm your interest in the position and respect for the company.
Content is not the only aspect you need to consider when preparing a follow-
up letter. The following are tips for presenting and delivering a letter that gets
you noticed:
 For an important job, a typed dead-tree-industry letter is impressive and
memorable; send it by postal mail, or if time is short, via an overnight
delivery service.
 The letter can run two, even three pages, if it is flush with white space
and easy to read.
 Some very savvy people swear by handwritten notes. But here’s my
take: Even when your penmanship is good, a note doesn’t readily lend
itself to heavy-duty service as a marketing tool when you’re going for 
the win.
 Write a thank-you letter for the interview within 24 hours to strengthen
the good impression you made in person.
 When an employer leaves you twisting in the wind waiting for a hiring
decision, try to think of new facts to add in a second or even third letter
(send by postal mail, fax, courier, or e-mail).
 After the third letter, switch to sending a note with a relevant news 
clipping or even an appropriate cartoon. The interviewer will know
what’s going on, but at least you’re keeping your name where it can 
be seen; remember the truth of the adage, “Out of sight, out of mind.”
Figure 13-1 shows you a sample letter for postal mail. You can find a lot more
sample thanks letters on the Web; search for “job interview thank-you let-
ters.” But before adapting any sample for your own use, make sure that it car-
ries a marketing punch and won’t be mistaken for a bread-and-butter “Aunt
Martha” letter.

Mr. A.J. Cortes, Vice President
21st Century Developments
[Address]
Dear Mr. Cortes:
Thank you for the opportunity to interview for a subcontractor coordinator position. I would very much like 
to be on the respected 21st Century Developments team. I’m appreciative of your genuine interest in 
acquainting me with your staff and company goals. In summary, here’s a review of what I offer as a 
potential colleague:
I have delivered on building working relationships with key vendors:
• 
Beginning 11 years ago [date], when I became a subcontractor coordinator, I have consistently achieved 
high-quality results by keeping abreast of the quality of materials used by various companies. Among 
my favorite suppliers, you may recognize the following names: Namath Re-bar, Drywall By-the-Mile, 
and Lionel Fixtures.
• 
Two years ago, [date] I eliminated one whole clerical position by implementing a new software 
package to manage daily progress reports from subs, making the work competition intelligence faster 
and cheaper.
I have delivered on facilitating the control of subcontractor costs:
• 
I have carefully monitored signs of cost run-ups, strategizing with project managers on cost control. On 
the previous three projects alone, my notifications saved my employer $X dollars, an amount equal to 
13 percent of the total cost.
I have delivered on first-class scheduling strategies:
• 
Because I have solid competencies, skills and experience in construction requirements, I have been able 
to reverse errors made by my predecessors at several organizations where I have been employed. For 
example, at Bogart Industries, I was able to turn around a looming fiasco due to improper scheduling of 
subs (more than $2 million) and bring the project in nearly on time. Bogart’s CEO said that my extreme 
scheduling turnaround kept the company from losing the project to creditors.
High standards have always been central in my work. Now, as an accomplished professional, I feel ready to 
join such a demanding company as yours. Thanks again for the interview. I look forward to speaking with 
you soon.
 
Sincerely,
 
Max Hong

E-mail
In this digital age, most people send e-mail thank-you letters. This medium is
usually fine for most jobs. Consider these observations on communicating
after an interview by e-mail:
 Use e-mail when you hope to start or continue a dialogue with an inter-
viewer. E-mail is more conversational and easier for a quick reply. On the
other hand, it’s also easier to say no in an e-mail message than on the
telephone.
 Use e-mail when quick action matters. The job could be filled while you’re
waiting for postal mail to be delivered or a phone call to be answered. 
 Use e-mail if that’s the way you sent your resume and especially if the
employer requested electronic communication in a job ad.
 Use e-mail when you are dealing with a high-tech firm; the firm’s hiring
authority probably doesn’t remember what paper is and may think
voicemail is a bother.
Don’t make blanket assumptions about whether spam filters will prevent your
message from reaching the interviewer; ask the interviewer or a receptionist
in advance about the best way to send an e-mail message.
The content for a thank-you e-mail need not differ much, if at all, from that of
a paper thank-you letter (see Figure 13-1). You can write a couple of lines in
your e-mail referring to your attached letter:
I was impressed with the warmth and efficiency of your offices, as I explain
in my attached letter.
Telephone calls
Once upon a time, all that job seekers calling about potential employment had
to worry about was getting past human gatekeeper assistants. They solved
that problem in various ways, by adopting a pleasant and honest manner and
making an ally of the assistant by revealing the refreshing truth about why
they’re calling, for example. Or by trying to reach the interviewer before 8:30
a.m. or after 5:30 p.m., when the assistant isn’t likely to be on duty and the
interviewer fields phone calls alone.
Those were the good old days. Now, voicemail has joined human gatekeepers
in throwing roadblocks in front of job seekers who try to follow up on 
interviews.
The big voicemail question for job seekers is whether to leave a mes-
sage on voicemail. Opinions vary, but, as a practical matter, you may
170
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

have to leave a message if you don’t connect after the first few calls. All your
calls won’t be returned, but your chances improve when you say something
interesting in a 30-second sound bite:
This is _____. I’m calling about the (job title or department) opening. After reflect-
ing on some of the issues you mentioned during our meeting, I thought of a facet
of one problem you might like to know. My number is _____.
Opening the conversation
Here’s a sprinkling of conversation starters:
 Is this a good time to talk?
 I think you’ll be interested to know _____.
 I understand you’re still reviewing many applications, but . . .
 I forgot to go into the key details of (something mentioned during the inter-
view) that might be important to you.
 While listening to you, I neglected to mention my experience in (function).
It was too important for me to leave out, since the position calls for 
substantial background in that area.
 I was impressed with your _____.
 I appreciate your emphasis on _____.
Keeping the conversational ball rolling
Try these approaches to maintain the conversation:
 Remind the interviewer why you’re so special, what makes you unique
(exceptional work in a specific situation, innovating).
Let me review what I’m offering you that’s special.
 Establish a common denominator — a work or business philosophy.
It seems like we both approach work in the (name of) industry from the
same angle.
 Note a shared interest that benefits the employer.
I found a new Web site that may interest you — it’s XYZ. It reports on the
news items we discussed . . . Would you like the URL?
Reminding your references
References can make all the difference. Spend adequate time choosing and
preparing the people who give you glowing testimonials. What they say about
you is more convincing than what you say about yourself.
171
Chapter 13: Closing the Show

Call your references and fill them in on your interview:
I had an interview today with (person, company). We talked about the posi-
tion, and it sounds like a perfect match for me. They wanted (give a list of
key requirements), and that’s just what I can supply.
For instance, I have all this experience (match five key requirements with
five of your qualifications) from when I worked with (name of company).
Would you like me to fax you those points I just mentioned? . . . I was so
happy about the interview I just wanted to thank you once more for all your
help and support. I couldn’t have done it without you.
Your After-Interview Checklist
Experts in any field become experts because they’ve made more mistakes
than the rest of us. After your interview, take a few minutes to rate your per-
formance. The following checklist can help you curb bad habits and become
an expert at job interviewing:
 Were you on time?
 Did you use storytelling, examples, results, and measurement of achieve-
ments to back up your claims and convince the questioner that you have
the skills to do the job?
 Did you display high energy? Flexibility? Interest in learning new things?
 Did the opening of the interview go smoothly?
 Did you frequently make a strong connection between the job’s require-
ments and your qualifications?
 Was your personal grooming immaculate? Were you dressed like company
employees?
 Did you forget any important selling points? If so, did you put them in a
follow-up e-mail, letter, or call-back?
 Did you smile? Did you make eye contact?
 Did you convey at least five major qualities the interviewer should
remember about you?
 Did you make clear your understanding of the work involved in the job?
 Did you show your understanding of the strategies required to reach
company goals?
 Did you use enthusiasm and motivation to indicate that you’re willing to
do the job?
172
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

 Did you find some common ground to establish that you’ll fit well into
the company?
 Did you take the interviewer’s clues to wrap it up?
 Did you find out the next step and leave the door open for your follow-up?
 After the interview, did you write down names and points discussed?
Think about the following questions to help you clearly identify your
strengths and weaknesses on the job interview stage:
 What did you do or say that the interviewer obviously liked?
 Did you hijack the interview by grabbing control or speaking too much
(more than half the time)?
 Would you have done something differently if you could replay the 
interview?
Onward and Upward
You’ve done it all — turned in a ShowStopper performance at your interview
and followed up like a pro. Keep following up until you get another job or until
you’re told you aren’t a good match for the position — or that while your 
qualifications were good, another candidate’s were better.
Even then, write yet one more thank-you note, expressing your hope that you
may work together in the future. Sometimes the first choice declines the job
offer, and the employer moves on to the next name — perhaps yours.
173
Chapter 13: Closing the Show
When you get a job offer at the interview
Once an offer is on the table, bring up your self-
interest (vacation, benefits, lunch hours) requests
for information. Whip out a note pad and say
I’m excited and grateful for your interest. I’d
like to clear up just a few issues. Can you
tell me about — ?
Unless the circumstances are unusual, accepting
or rejecting a job offer on the spot is not in your
best interest. You’re likely to think of something
later that you forgot to negotiate. Improving an
offer after you have accepted is difficult.
Even if you have survived multiple interviews
and have long known the likely outline of the
offer, think about it overnight at least (see
Chapter 14 ).

In This Chapter
 Sitting tight while you think things over
 Evaluating your career script
 Asking questions to respond wisely to a job offer
 Signing pre-employment agreements
C
ongratulations! You’ve been offered the part you auditioned for. A few
small things may curb your unbridled enthusiasm: Your salary’s so low
you have to rent your toothbrush. Your hours are so late that even the cable
channels are running test patterns when you get home. Your health benefits
consist of your giving up only one of your kidneys. Otherwise, the job is great.
Failing to think through the pros and cons of a job offer is how people become
cemented in a routine of disappointing work. This chapter deals with issues to
consider in your decision.
Don’t Say Yes Right Away
When you hear those sweet words, “We’re offering you the job,” anticipate
your reaction. It probably proceeds through the following stages:
1. Enthusiasm.
Act as though you’ve just won a lottery.
2. Thoughtfulness.
Ask for a day or two to “sleep on it.”
3. Enthusiasm.
Act as though you’ve just won a lottery.
Why should you be so enthusiastic when you’re not certain you want the job?
Because it’s more fun to turn down than to be turned down.

You need a little time to get over the excitement of being chosen and calmly
consider whether accepting the offer is in your best interest.
The employer probably expects you to take a day or two to decide. After all,
you’re making a choice that impacts many facets of your existence. An immedi-
ate response could be seen as impulsiveness or failure to take the job seriously.
Even when the job’s the only game in town and everyone wants it, your 
interests are best served by reflecting a bit before giving your answer. This 
is especially true when relocation is involved. Ask for overnight, a few days,
or, at most, a week to think over a job offer.
Before saying yes, you may still be able to extract one last benefit that didn’t
come with the original offer. Or the additional facts provided by the interview
may have opened your eyes to aspects of the job you hadn’t considered —
pro or con.
Stick to Your Career Script?
Not so long ago, a key consideration in choosing a job was the opportunity 
to stay in your career field to follow your personal goals. Zigzagging from
career field to career field rather than changing jobs within the same career
field wasn’t a smart strategy. The situation has changed. Turning down a 
job today because it doesn’t “fit into your long-term career goals” is still 
a desirable policy but not always a practical choice.
Analyzing who you are and what you want to do will always be relevant.
Staying within the boundaries of the work you love and are prepared to do 
is always more satisfying — and always better for your career.
176
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
New grads can ask for three weeks to accept job
Although job changers normally are expected to
give a yea or nay to job offers within a few days,
college seniors who’re trying to figure out where
they want to work after graduation should be
given plenty of time to explore all their employ-
ment options, says the National Association of
Colleges and Employers. NACE recommends that
employers give graduating students a minimum
of three weeks to choose among job offers.
Some employers use a competitive tactic called
the “exploding offer,” which means the student
is given too little time, sometimes only a few
days, to accept before the offer is withdrawn.
This rush of decision-making backfires on all
parties when students make poor, pressured
decisions and then renege or resign early. If
you’re a rookie, quote the NACE policy recom-
mendation when asking for enough time to think
clearly and thoroughly. Choosing a first job is a
major life decision.

Economic realities may sometimes mean that to earn a living, you have to do
what you can do rather than what you love to do. Should you find yourself in
this situation, try to identify new skills and knowledge you will gain that
enhance your original career direction if you return to it.
What’s most important to you is that any job you take must allow you to
develop and tweak portable skills that you can use in your next job.
To Accept or Not to Accept
Once you stop dancing around and whooping it up after finally getting the 
job offer, think about the particulars of whether the job is right for you. The
following sections outline the kinds of questions you need to ask yourself.
Is the job itself a good one?
Is this job worth one half of your waking hours? Only you can decide. When
considering the worthiness of the job itself, ask yourself the following 
questions:
 Does this job allow me to strengthen my marketable skills? Does it offer
career mobility?
 Do I like the people I would be working with day to day?
177
Chapter 14: When You're Offered the Part
Please stay. We’re not kidding.
With good labor tight, employers have rediscov-
ered counteroffers when a useful employee quits
to take a better job. If you find yourself being
wooed back, it’s usually best to leave the counter-
offer on the table, say thanks, and move on.
Here’s why:
 When substantial financial considerations aren’t
in the mix, most people leave a job because of a
personality rift, blocked advancement, or boring
work. A generous counteroffer doesn’t fix any of
these things.
 After you’ve announced a departure, count
yourself out of the inner circle. You won’t be
trusted as before.
 Renewing your enthusiasm will be challeng-
ing: You already know why you want to find
the exit. If your current employer wouldn’t
promote you or give you a decent raise before
you put on your walking shoes, don’t expect
anything different when it’s time to move up to
your next career level.
 If a recruiter connected you with the new offer,
and you say yes and then no, your credibility
goes up in smoke — a negative that could
come back to haunt you.
Ask yourself whether you’d join the company that
now employs you if you were looking for a good job.
(This exercise can help you make the right decision.)

 Will the boss(es) and I get along?
 Will this work hold my attention?
 Does the job use the best of my talents, skills, and abilities?
 Will this work give me a sense of enjoyment?
 Is this a job that “makes a difference?” Do I care?
 Do I get to make the important decisions about how I do the job?
 Will I have to travel? How much? Is that okay with me?
 Will I have to work hours when my friends play? Is that okay with me?
 Will this job allow me to add to my personal network?
 Will I be visible to people who make decisions?
 Could this job be a stepping stone to something better?
 Do I need a whole new wardrobe for this job? Is that okay with me?
Is the company a good choice?
Is this a company you admire? When considering the kind of company you
may be joining, ask yourself the following questions:
178
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 
Feedback when you’re not offered the part
If you aren’t ready for this chapter yet — that
is, if you lost the part to another candidate —
you may be wondering where you went wrong.
Disappointed job seekers often ask interview-
ers for reasons why they weren’t selected and
for tips on how to do better in the future.
Don’t waste your time: You almost never will 
be given the real reason. Employers have no
legal or ethical obligation to explain why you
weren’t the one. Instead, they’re likely to offer
these kinds of innocuous rationales: “We didn’t
feel you were the best fit for this job” or “We
chose another candidate who had more experi-
ence” or “Company policy won’t allow me to
comment.”
Why won’t interviewers take you behind the
scenes and share the truth? Here are some of the
reasons they give:
 Legal exposure: Companies are extremely
wary of lawsuits accusing them of discrimina-
tion. The less said, the less to be sued about.
 Fast-paced world: There’s no profit in wasting
prime hours on a dead end.
 Discomfort factor: Managers dislike giving
negative feedback.
 Scant information: HR (human resources)
interviewers may not have enough details
from hiring managers to give helpful answers,
even if they were inclined to do so.
When you’re not offered the part, review the After-
Interview Checklist in Chapter 13. If you have the
requisite qualifications and your performance
doesn’t need pumping up, the reason you didn’t get
an offer may have nothing to do with you. Square
your shoulders and get ready for the next interview.

 Does the company culture fit my personality?
 Does the company have room for advancement?
 Are the company policies in writing?
 Can I live with these policies?
 Is the company in a good position to survive and grow in a 
competitive market?
 What’s the company’s reputation for consideration of employees?
Severance policies?
 Is the company’s industry growing or shrinking?
 Can I handle the commute?
Is the pay enough?
You can be just as happy with a lot of money as a little. For most of us, getting
our hands on any money means working at paid jobs for our material things —
home, food, transportation, clothing, entertainment, and education. As I note 
in Chapter 8, compensation comes in a package of base pay, variable pay (such
as bonuses), and indirect pay (employee benefits such as health insurance).
Weigh each of these factors when considering the company’s compensation
package. Ask yourself these questions:
 Am I being offered my fair market value in base pay?
 How valuable are any variable pay opportunities — bonuses, commis-
sions, stock options?
 What good are the benefits? Health insurance (what percentage do I pay;
can I choose coverage plans)? Retirement plan? Company car? Vacation
time? Sick days? What else?
 What is the basis for raises?
179
Chapter 14: When You're Offered the Part
Employers expect you to negotiate
When you get a job offer in a tight labor market,
your compensation may be more negotiable than
you think. For example, when you can’t bump up
the pay, the following compensation may be open
to change:
 Relocation costs reimbursement
 Early reviews with the option for salary
increases
 Signing bonuses
 Vacation leave
See Chapter 8 to cop a compensation attitude
and become a more confident negotiator.

Pre-Employment Contracts Promise
Protection for Everyone 
Although your verbal job offer covers such specifics as the term of employ-
ment, duties, and compensation, what happens if disputes arise in the future
and memories fade? It’s your word against theirs. He said–she said. That’s
why getting your offer in writing is to your advantage. (Would you buy a
house or an insurance plan without a written contract?)
A written pre-employment contract, or its little brother, the job offer letter,
also benefits an employer because you as an employee agree to provide spe-
cific work benefits and make certain promises (like you promise not to reveal
company secrets or steal company customers).
Legally, no iron-clad contract rules apply in every state, and each employment
contract is different.
Fifty years ago employment contracts were reserved for theatrical royalty
and big-shot corporate executives. That’s changing. Employment relation-
ships are increasingly contract-oriented for professional, managerial, techni-
cal, and administrative positions.
So when you’re asked to sign a pre-employment contract, you know that 
the company considers you an investment it wants to protect. But what
should you do when a contract’s provisions include factors that you don’t
like and have not verbally agreed to? Can you negotiate the boilerplate? In
most cases, the answer is yes — to a degree. You have more leverage to nego-
tiate a contract to get what you want in tight labor markets; you have less
leverage in surplus labor markets when ten people are standing behind you
ready to grab the job.
What do pre-employment agreements cover? Usually they regulate one or more
of the following issues:
 The position being offered and accepted.
 The compensation that will be paid.
 Whether the job is for a specified length of time or at will. (You or the
employer can call it quits at any time for any reason.)
 Specific benefits regarding paid leave time (like vacation and sick days)
and whether such time accrues from year to year.
 Responsibilities of both parties concerning the work to be done.
Danger points for you to recognize and investigate fully before signing your
acceptance include the following:
180
Part II: Backstage Researching and Rehearsing 

 Repayments of training cost or relocation expense that are required
under certain conditions.
 Non-compete clauses that prevent you from working elsewhere in a
given locale for a specified period of time.
 A statement that the terms of the agreement are subject to change in 
the future.
 A statement that you are to be bound by the terms of the company’s
employee handbook, which you may not yet have seen. (The handbook
itself usually notes that it is subject to change at any time by the 
company.)
 Agreement to arbitration and other alternate dispute resolutions that
come with a muzzle clause prohibiting you from discussing settlement
details of disputes. Arbitration is a contentious issue with employees
often feeling that arbitrators (wishing to be hired again) may side with
companies because they’re more likely to be repeat customers. St. Louis
employment attorney Sheldon Weinhaus comments: “Companies keep
track of previous awards. It is much harder for a worker to know the 
history of any arbitrator.”
If you’re required to sign a pre-employment agreement that mandates arbitra-
tion, ask that language be inserted requiring that the arbitrator be chosen from
a list maintained by the American Arbitration Association or another selection
organization that operates with a code of ethics.
A job offer letter is the minimum promise protection you should have in any
work opportunity requiring you to resign your current job or to relocate out
of your residence. A job offer letter is a condensed pre-employment contract
outlining the basics of your employment. In small companies a job offer letter
may be written without a lawyer’s help. Details and samples of offer letters
are available on an About.com Web site, http://jobsearchtech.about.
com; scroll past ads to Job Offer Letters.
Pre-employment agreements and job offer letters are generally legal and
enforceable — but not always. If you can’t afford to consult an employment
lawyer before signing a pre-employment contract, bulk up your knowledge; run
a Google search for “pre-employment contracts” and “employment contracts.”
Last Chance to Back Out
Maybe you’ve decided to accept the offer. Before popping a Champagne cork,
make sure that you have the salary, benefits, and starting date in writing.
Assurance that you correctly understand this information is critical when
you’re being asked to relocate or give up a job.
181
Chapter 14: When You're Offered the Part

If you received the offer over the telephone, ask whether the company can
mail you a job offer letter; if not, you write one, perhaps calling it a “letter of
understanding.”
Sometimes you decide the job isn’t for you. Don’t feel obligated to accept it
merely because you’ve been dickering over your potential employment for
weeks. If you ultimately decide to pass on it, send an amiable letter that reveals
no details. Say that while you greatly appreciate the offer and the interviewer’s
time, you have made a difficult decision and that you have accepted a position
with another employer (or that you have ultimately determined that you aren’t
a good fit with the company).
When the job offers the breakout role you’ve been searching for, throw a
wrap party. Pop the Champagne. Cheers all around!

H
ello new or recent college graduate! Remember that I’m on your side as
you read the first part of this chapter and reach for the anxiety meds.
Stay tuned. I show you later in this chapter how to use interview settings to
counter criticism of your generation that sometimes lurks but remains unspo-
ken. As you know, you have to recognize a problem to fix it. So please bear
with me for a couple of pages while I lay out common negative presumptions
you may have to cope with. Now, on with the show. . . .
First, I share with you some of the stereotypical presumptions that I’ve
gathered from media reports and personal conversations with recruiters
about new and recent graduates in the workplace, and then I tell you how to
deck them.
Peering into the Eye of the 
Inter-Generational Storm
Four generations are hanging out together in the workplace for the first time
in U.S. history. The sheer range of ages and values-shaping experiences makes
for some dramatic days at the office as intergenerational tension bubbles up.

The four generations now rubbing elbows in conference rooms include the
following, more or less. (There’s much argument as to the exact range of
birth years that describe each generation.)
 Radio Babies (a.k.a. The Silent Generation) were born between 1930 and
1945, and they lived through World War II.
 Baby Boomers came into the world between 1946 and1969. Because there
were so many of them, they’ve impacted society like a pig moving through
a python.
 Generation X (or Baby Busters) were born between 1970 and 1979 and 
were once slammed by earlier generations as slackers, cynics, and
underachievers.
 Millennials (or Generation Y) were born after 1980. They have the dumb
luck of being criticized by the three older generations as coddled,
praise-needy whiners who only want to work on their own terms.
The three older generations of workers have largely made peace among
themselves, but their members may experience culture shock when they see
new and recent college graduates showing up for work with exposed midriffs
that display a belly ring, or find them audaciously text-messaging senior man-
agers with requests about issues that should be handled with an immediate
supervisor.
Employers pass their dissatisfactions onto their recruiters, who also accuse
Millennials of not getting the seller mentality that grows job offers. Twenty-
somethings are said to interview with unrealistic expectations of how
employers should accommodate their desire to have a life outside the work-
place. Unlike their parents who worked killer hours in a single-minded drive
to achieve, members of the youngest generation insist that while they sure
do want to make a difference, they work to live, not live to work.
Inspired by printed reports of actual exchanges between recruiters and
Millennials, I illustrate with a fictional but representative snippet of an 
interview to illustrate the take-it-or-leave-it attitude that leaves employers
speechless:
Management consulting firm interviewer: Would you like to know more
about our company’s quantitative analysis group?
Millennial professional: Who would I be working for? I am not interested if I
can’t choose my boss. Would I start as a senior analyst? What is the salary?
How soon would I be eligible for a raise? When would I be considered for a
promotion? Would I have to work past 5 pm? I need a vacation the first two
weeks of every June because I have a time-share in Costa Rica. And to be
upfront with you, I will need a half-day on Fridays because I have a cabin in
the mountains and my friends count on me being there.
186
Part III: Actors’ Studio: Casting Your Character 

Finding Yourself in Demand 
Despite Shortcomings
Even as charges that Millennials too aggressively demand work/life balance,
demographics are working in your favor. As the workforce’s youngest begin
replacing retiring Boomers, many top corporations cite a “War for Talent”
imperative and go all out to recruit twenty-somethings. These companies are
willing to make whatever concessions they must to recruit you. Benefits at
some major organizations include these perks:
 Free lunches
 On-site massage
 A bonus for hitting the gym
 The full tab for grad school for some hires
 Summer office closures at 3 p.m. on Fridays
Clearly, the world is your oyster at prestigious corporations if you have a good
education from a recognized college or university. But here’s the reality: Top-of-
the line workplace bounty is not universal. Most companies aren’t willing to
bend to what they consider excessive demands of Millennial candidates.
As a huge generation, Millennials will eventually have the last word. As your
numbers pour into the job market, Millennials seeking less grueling tours of
duty than your parents’ long and rigid workweeks eventually will liberalize
the workplace.
But my sources tell me that the vast majority of bosses, especially those in
smaller companies who bootstrapped themselves to a corner office, continue
to seek hungrier and more easily moldable rookies. That’s why this chapter
speaks directly to you in the stadium crowd, more so than to you in the
opera-house elites.
Facing Presumptions of 
Millennials’ Work Ethic
As a new or recent college graduate, your ability to do the work that a job
requires isn’t so much in question. The iffy factor is your willingness to do the
work in a manner an employer prefers. While the work-ethic question isn’t
singular to 20-somethings (Gen X members used to hear the same gripes when
they were younger.), it does hit your generation hardest. Here’s what critics
say about Millennials:
187
Chapter 15: From iPods and Texting to Jobs and Paychecks

 You have an attitude toward work that looks like laziness and impatience.
 You had to overachieve to get through the most competitive college
admissions process in history, so you don’t feel particularly inclined 
to pay your dues.
 You make up the most pampered generation in history; you were
expected to spend your spare time making the varsity team, not 
working part-time. You’re like Gen X on steroids.
 You’re likely to look at a job interview in the way one 20-year-old candi-
date defined it to a recruiter: “a two-way conversation where the company
puts out what they want and expect from me, and I put out what I want
and expect from the company.” Not!
 You’re more demanding than previous generations and dismiss as hope-
lessly old-fashioned the traditional work ethic that people should work
hard and do the best job possible, regardless of the reward.
 You can’t think on your feet. You don’t work well alone, maybe because
you grew up on a steady stream of organized sports and other team
activities. You’re comfortable only when pursuing well-defined goals as
part of a team and can’t solve problems independently. (Mom, help!)
Today’s rookies are too often stereotyped as lazy and impatient to take a seat
at the table, refusing to pay dues, slacking off, holding galling expectations,
being unwilling to work hard or long, and being limited in the ability to make
independent decisions and solve problems. No generation is of one mind.
Nevertheless, if you don’t meet the generalization head-on, it can cause you
to miss out on a job you want.
The positive performance you give during an interview dispelling the poor-
work-ethic stereotyping can erase doubts about your willingness to do a job.
Tips for Millennial Rookies
Concentrating on the skills and accomplishments you provide and on what
you bring to the employer — not what you want from the job — go a long
way toward wiping out unspoken concerns that chill job offers. Here are
other tips for combating perceptions:
 Don’t get sandbagged by generational myths. Every generation believes
that it’s substantially different from those who have gone before and
therefore deserves a pass to rewrite the rules. That’s true only in the
methods and technology used to make one’s way in life. As scholar and
188
Part III: Actors’ Studio: Casting Your Character 

publisher Dr. Ron Krannich (www.impactpublications.com) says:
“Despite a trendy Generation Y designation, today’s college graduates still
must learn to connect with the right people who can hire them for good
jobs, showing they can add value to the organizations they want to join.”
 Don’t be a prancing pony in your interviewing persona, confusing attitude
with confidence. Try to come across as able but eager to learn. Radiating
arrogance that implies the workplace rules must bend to accommodate
your preferences because you’re young and tech-savvy won’t play well
with older bosses who have the power to choose someone else.
 Bring a notepad and take notes during the interview. This shows you’re
interested and paying attention. Think respect.
 Don’t be shocked if an employer refuses to negotiate entry-level salaries.
But after you’ve presented your value, do ask about the timing of perfor-
mance reviews, as well as performance bonuses and how they’re calcu-
lated. (See Chapter 8 for salary talk.)
 Storytell. Prepare detailed true examples of all your skills, with as many
examples from off-campus as on-campus. But stay away from personal
stories that may work on Facebook but are more than interviewers want
to know.
 Don’t apologize for a lack of workplace experience beyond internships
and student jobs. The employer already knows that you’re starting out.
Instead, explain how your experience at your summer job waiting tables
helped you hone your customer-service skills. This is a golden oldie but
especially important to young graduates.
Scripts for Millennial Newbies
You find suggested scripts to answer a large number of interviewing questions
elsewhere in this book; especially in Chapters 18–24. In addition, the script
examples below suggest strategies for smacking down bad press aimed 
specifically at Gen Y candidates. Here goes:
 You should hire me because I’m the best person for this job. I am not only a
hard worker and a fast learner but I bring a passion for excellence. I won’t
disappoint you. For example —.
 Yes, I’m an experienced team player. I’ve had opportunities in my intern-
ships, college, and athletics to maximize my skills as a team player. On a
recent project, for example, —. But being on a team doesn’t mean I can’t
lead a team. I was elected president of the Environmental Action Club at
my college. I enjoy making well-reasoned, well-thought-out decisions. For
instance, when I —.
189
Chapter 15: From iPods and Texting to Jobs and Paychecks

 You asked how I handle conflict on a team. Basically, I try to make dispas-
sionate judgments about what’s best for the group and our goal and then
use good communications techniques to make my point. Let me tell you
how I mediated a flap over —.
 I am excited to learn that your company encourages volunteering for ser-
vice work. I believe that people who do not give back to their community
make a misjudgment both personally and in their career development.
Based on my volunteer stints in college, I find that service work adds
another dimension to my understanding of what people really want and
how to satisfy those longings. I hope you’ll select me for this position
because we’re on the same page here.
 You asked me where I would like to be in five years. I would like to become
the best marketing representative you have in the company. At the same
time, I’ll be preparing to take on greater responsibilities. For example, I’ve
enrolled in an advanced level marketing course online to be ready for
future challenges. I love creative challenges, and I’m comfortable making
decisions.
 You asked how well I work with people who are considerably older than
me. That’s great. In my work with the Batiquitos Lagoon Foundation, which
I’ve done for three years, all the volunteers have a mutual respect for each
other. Obviously I look to the older crowd for their experience and I think
they like what I bring in the way of my newer education and experience that
maybe they don’t have. So you could say it’s a mutual admiration society.
 I have no problem working the hours you require. In fact, I would look for-
ward to the opportunity to move around and see different areas of the 
company relatively early in my career to get a better feel for what I can
contribute down the line and where I want to go within the company. I’ll
work very hard to make a difference for this company and for the com-
pany’s customers. I think my professors will back me up on that — would
you like to see some of their letters of recommendation?
 Although I don’t have experience doing this exact kind of work, my educa-
tion has given me a considerable background in this area. With a combina-
tion of my educational background and my internship job experience, I
know that I will be a productive new addition to your team and I will go 
all out to make that happen.
 I know that many employers consider my generation, the Y generation, 
to be somewhat difficult to manage and inspire. The joke I’ve heard is,
“You’re in the Why generation — Why aren’t you more interested in your
career prospects?” Mr. Clemons, that’s not me. I’ve been focused on joining
a team such as this one all during my senior year. And I’ve worked diligently
to succeed at this goal, as I hope some of my earlier statements have con-
veyed. Do you think I’m the committed addition to your team whom you
hope to hire?

Good Times and Your Future
The intergenerational shift in the workplace puts today’s new and recent col-
lege graduates on the job market’s red carpet. If that’s you, enjoy your edge.
But recognize that the hiring picture could change in a few years:
 Consider the flip-flop rhythm of the economy (remember Econ 101?).
Cyclical recessions and hiring slowdowns force younger as well as 
older people to stalk jobs for months on end.
 As workforce ranks repopulate — until the year 2020 or so — with other
Millennials who, like you, are tech-savvy, you’ll compete for jobs within
your own age group.
 By far the biggest question mark for your future is how worldwide com-
petition for the best jobs will impact Americans of all ages. The end of
communism and capital’s chase for cheap labor across the planet has
unleashed hundreds of millions of workers on global markets. A number
of these competitors have a bachelor’s or an advanced degree.
On a cheerier note, a rising job market for new college graduates has been a
long-running show. Over the past half-decade, employers have consistently
projected double-digit annual hiring increases, according to the National
Association of Colleges and Employers.
And as you gear up to begin an awesome and magnificent trip toward an
award-winning work/life-balanced career, remember this one last tip: Some
days you’re the bug, some days you’re the windshield.

Gird for a competitive search
Although current prospects for new graduates
are encouraging, employers receive many
applications for each available starter-

networking sites to connect with employees
inside the prospective employer companies. Get

 Career-changing without experience in a new field
 Bridging an experience gap with crossover skills
 Scripting persuasive answers to tough questions
P
eople change careers for many variations of two reasons: They leave
their career or their career leaves them. Either way, employment chal-
lenges are much the same when it comes to marketing yourself in places
where you haven’t been before.
Even when you think you can easily transition from one career field or indus-
try to another (the manager-can-manage-anything syndrome), employers can
be a hard sell when it comes to greenlighting career changers for a payroll.
Except when they’re filling entry level jobs, hiring authorities have a frustrat-
ing habit of preferring candidates who, on someone else’s dime, have proven
that they can do the work a job requires.
American poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s summary of the two views —
yours and an employer’s — leaps to mind:
We judge ourselves by what we feel capable of doing; others judge us by
what we have done.
When you’re trying to swim in new ponds, you have to figure out ways to get
past an employer’s inner voice, the one that says you’re a fish out of water.
Remembering Career Change Basics 
How does that new cliché I just made up go — this isn’t your father’s inter-
viewing market? Truer words were never spoken. Global trade is changing life
for all of us. Technology is automating human processes. Computer modeling

is trumping gut feeling. Teleconference marketing is replacing sales trips.
Highly qualified candidates are being hired on temp contracts and cut loose
when the project is over or the job is shipped offshore to cheaper labor
nations.
Keep your dreams alive as you assume the role of career changer in a new
era, but be clear-eyed about the challenges you face when you set out to
interview yourself into places where you’re a stranger. Mull over the follow-
ing points of practical straight talk about career-changing:
 Career change is not job change. A career change involves a marked
shift in jobs requiring new primary skills or knowledge, or a totally dif-
ferent work environment — or both. For example, when a manager in the
telecom industry leaves one company for another managerial position in
the same industry, he makes a job change; when he leaves the telecom
industry to become a museum curator he makes a career change to a
different job and different industry.
 Retraining may be unavoidable. When you attempt to make a clear
change to a different kind of job (for instance, engineer to sales rep) 
in the same industry, you may well be able to pitch your way into an
employer’s graces without investing in additional formal education or
training. Your challenge is more difficult when you try to change both
your job and industry at the same time, but you may be able to pull it 
off without immediately spending additional time and money in school.
However, you won’t be able to get out of educational renewal to satisfy
credibility and licensing requirements in such careers as law, public
accounting, and nursing.
 Employers worry most about risk. Managers are concerned whether
the crossover skills (which I tell you about in the upcoming section
“Leveraging Crossover Skills for Change”) you acquired in your former
career will translate to your new career. When your skills don’t convert
and you can’t do the work, the business suffers a negative impact and —
if you’re canned — a risk of being sued for wrongful discharge. Another
worry is whether you’ll suffer changer’s remorse, quickly becoming dis-
satisfied and turning into a “bad hire.” These risks drive employers to
seek out directly applicable skills in proven performers.
 Your competitors are new graduates. When you’re starting over, you
compete with new graduates who are starting out. Expect to be paid
entry-level money; an employer is unlikely to compensate you for your
15 years’ experience in another field (unless you can show that your
experience can save or earn money for the new employer). Even so, 
you have an ace up your sleeve: You bring judgment, commitment, 
high motivation, proven good work habits, and real-world lessons.

Eyeing the Best Career-Change Tips
The hilarious misadventures of characters in A Funny Thing Happened on 
the Way to the Forum, the Broadway show megahit and subsequent movie,
spawned an echo chamber of knock-off media — books, articles, videos. A
Google exploration shows a half-million hits on the funny-thing phrasing.
The send-ups start with the first part of the title (A Funny Thing Happened on
the Way to . . .), and end with whatever topic is being skewered. Among my
favorites: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the White House, a book, and
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, a video. 
The phrasing formula has become shorthand for what happens when foolhar-
diness and folly lead a perfectly good journey into unexpected and unintended
consequences. If you don’t read the pointers that follow, you could be nomi-
nated for a lead role in A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to My Career
Change.
 Connect with others in your intended field. When your change is vol-
untary, at least six months in advance of your leap, join a professional
association of members in the career field or industry where you want
to go. When your change is involuntary and you’re suddenly left high
and dry, scramble to assemble a skeleton personal network of people
who can guide you into your intended field and beef it up as fast as you
can. Make friends. Find out who’s who and what’s happening with pro-
fessionals who can connect you with employment. Ask what you should
read and what workshops you should attend. Ask if you can visit a 
professional’s workplace as an observer.
 Educate yourself. Seek out short-term certificate programs and work-
shops offered during industry conferences, as well as those available
locally. If you study online, get the scoop on pluses and pitfalls about
distance learning. One starting spot: www.geteducated.com.
 Bone up on the industry. Even if you’re a nonacademic type who always
sneaked light rubbish reads or sports sections into your study halls, at
this time in your life you really can’t afford to skip hard-core research on
your proposed destination. (Check back to Chapter 6 for research leads.)
Those greener pastures sometimes bleach out when something about
the work isn’t what a changer realistically expects or can do well. This
probably happens as a result of skimpy research.
 Talk the talk. Learn the lingo of prospective new colleagues. You’ll seem
like one of them already.
 Brace yourself for interview pitfalls. When you find yourself trapped in
a behavior-based interview setting (described in Chapter 5) and you’re
coming up short trying to answer a question about what you have done
195
Chapter 16: Tips and Scripts That Sell a Switch

that’s relevant to the new career, answer quickly. And then reframe your
response segueing from behavior-based interviewing (the past) to situa-
tional interviewing (the future): That’s a good question. And here’s what I
would do if we decide I’m the right person for this position. I would —.
 Make the experience connection. The bridge you use to join the old
with the new must be rational and reasonable. Your qualifications have
to come from somewhere — skills you already possess, volunteer work,
part-time jobs, training, hobbies, and so forth. Strive to present a believ-
able relationship between your qualifications and the career you’re tar-
geting. The more convincing your bridge, the easier you make it for an
employer to say “Welcome, we want you.”
 Accentuate the positive. Don’t say you hope to change careers because
there are no more jobs in your field. An exception might be when a con-
dition is well known, such as real estate agents who got out during 
the recent downturn in home sales. Even then, add that you’d been
thinking about making a change for a couple of years and have decided
to redesign your life for a better fit with your priorities and goals. As in
any job search, you’re moving toward a preferred future, not running
away from a bad spot or a toxic boss.
 Tell true stories. Expect to be asked the same kinds of questions that
new graduates often face, such as some version of “Why shouldn’t we
hire someone more experienced in this line of work?” When you work
out your answers, remember to storytell — that is, to back up your claims
of superior qualities with true examples of achievement. Otherwise, what
you claim will likely be blown off as hot air. You must be believable.
 Inventory your core skills and knowledge. Sort through to see which
will crossover to a different industry or career field. Push them to the
front of your memory where you can find and translate them as needed.
The use of crossover skills is the topic of the next segment.
Leveraging Crossover Skills for Change
In mid-career, Roger (or so I’m calling our hero in this true story) woke up
one morning asking himself, “Is this all there is?” Successful but unhappily
employed, Roger wanted to find a new way to work, produce, self-actualize,
earn a living, and be happy.
Pulling the plug on his job as a controller of a division of a big Midwestern cor-
poration, Roger worked with an experienced career coach on self-analysis; a
big part of the analysis focused on identifying Roger’s crossover skills. Using
judgment born of maturity, Roger realized that what he really wanted to do
was work outdoors with boats. After leaving his land-locked state and moving
to Florida, Roger’s transferable skills, including boating and financial manage-
ment, built his crossover bridge into a marina business that he liked so much
he ended up buying it two years later.

Using crossover skills as a bridge from one career (or job) to another is your
most important persuasion tool to gain acceptance in job interviews. So what
exactly are crossover skills? In a nutshell, crossover skills are those you’ve
gathered through jobs, classes, volunteer work, hobbies, sports, projects,
parenting, or any other life experience that can be valuable in your new career.
Blogging, for example, is a crossover skill. Surprised? Don’t be. Blogging is
more than going online and telling the world about your day or what you
think. For starters, blogging requires more than writing skills. As a blogger,
you build a loyal readership and study visitor statistics to see what works
and what doesn’t. You meet self-announced deadlines for new material. You
make intelligent responses to comments including those that insult your 
own intelligence. As an extension of social networking, blogging can benefit
many businesses (such as financial services) or causes (such as politics) that
depend on large numbers of customers and supporters. Any entity seeking to
establish or maintain a blog needs people who can make it work correctly.
A few better known examples of crossover skills include the following
 Decision-making
 Oral and written communication
 Organization
 Problem-solving
 Technology
Crossovers are portable skills that you can use in many work settings. They
go straight to the heart of an employer’s question of “Can you do the job?”
Considering the importance of been-there, done-that experience to the suc-
cess of your career change, be ready to identify your crossover skills to an
interviewer, and to translate how they make you immediately productive.
There’s a hitch. Even brilliant people have trouble correctly and comprehen-
sively identifying their portable skills. Searching online for “crossover skills”
or “transferable skills” is the cheapest and quickest way to get started on

The leadership conundrum
When you’re an entrepreneur who wants to
come in out of the cold, tell stories about the
skills and self-motivation that you developed
being on your own. But be vigilant in countering
any inference that after being your own boss,
you’d be hard to manage. Practice interviewing
with a friendly “devil’s advocate” who won’t pull
punches in evaluating your interviewing perfor-
mance for dominance traits. Unless a company
is interviewing for a chief officer, turn down the
volume.

identifying yours. Additionally, look for books that contain multipage listings,
of portable skills, including my own Cover Letters For Dummies, 2nd Edition.
When big fat holes remain in your inventory of crossover skills, it’s time to
return to your college’s career center for help or engage a career coach well
versed in identifying skills and competencies.
Say What? Say This When 
You’re in Change Mode
You aren’t going to ring up a sale trying to explain why your previous experi-
ence as a restaurant manager qualifies you to manage a nuclear waste disposal
company. But you are going to make headway with hiring decisions when you
give convincing reasons why your lack of explicit prior experience doesn’t
matter. Study these sample answers and then add your own circumstances,
interpretations, and phrases to the scripts that follow.
 To respond to hesitations about your career change:
This job is a good fit for what I’ve been interested in throughout my career —
working with others to achieve an above-average outcome, the satisfaction
of being technically competent, and having a serious interest in sports. For
example, my work at Leader Public Relations taught me that a team needs
bench strength. When the senior publicist left Leader unexpectedly, I was
able to successfully step in and increase placements within six months by
20 percent. The persuasion skills I bring along with seven years of surfing
ideally qualify me for this position as assistant manager of surf board pro-
duction. Do you agree?
 To respond to concerns that your previous experience is irrelevant to
the job you want:
I am a well-qualified candidate for this educational research position
because cost control expertise required by the grant is more than met 
with my 15 years’ experience as a manager with budget and supervisory
responsibility.
 To respond to concerns that your previous position is irrelevant to the
job you want:
Yes, I was a receptionist for twelve years and it was great training to deal
with all levels of individuals. Here’s why I am so well-matched to your 
brokerage department. Not only have I interacted with venture and equity
capital managers and with retirement fund managers in a high-pressure
environment, I have taken a course in financial markets and stock, bonds,
and other investments. With the world rushing forward, I think we need
new thinking for new times, don’t you? My people skills will help me to
bring in the kinds of customers you’ve been losing to online traders. Do you
see any reasons why I wouldn’t be a great addition to your team?
198
Part III: Actors’ Studio: Casting Your Character 

 To demonstrate that you are changing directions with forethought and
action:
As I matured and got to know myself better, I realized how I fit into Career
X better than what I’d been doing, although my previous work has been
fine preparation for what I plan to do with the rest of my life. I’ve been
steadily drawn to Career X for several years and getting ready for this tran-
sition, I did the following (attended school, researched and volunteered in
the field, took a part-time job in the new industry). Since you didn’t screen
me out because of my prior experience, I assume you recognize my
crossover skills.
I appreciate your valuable time invested in seeing me and so I have taken
the initiative of working up a brief ledger sheet that shows you how I qual-
ify for this position. May I come around the desk and walk you through it?
(A ledger sheet in this usage refers to a brief one-page sheet of paper with
two columns. Title the left column, “Job Requirements.” Title the right
column, “My Qualifications.” Show the matches item by item. You can do 
a ledger sheet for interviews on paper or on a laptop.)
 Waitress transitioning to wholesale sales rep:
Although I haven’t yet specifically sold eyewear accessory products to retail-
ers, I do have sales experience when you consider that in my previous job I
was a de facto sales representative for the restaurant.
My upselling record consistently brought in high revenues each week. I’ve
demonstrated that I pay close attention to detail, that I can multitask with
precision and accuracy, and that I know how to build a loyal clientele of
customers who rave about my service and attention to their requirements.
(Smile.) While I’m certainly not the type of person who would lose her
head if it weren’t attached to her shoulder, I am the type of person who
would lose her reading glasses if they weren’t attached to lovely eyewear
accessory chains such as the one around my neck.
I won’t disappoint you. When can I start?
 To respond to reason you are interviewing:
As soon as I was sure I wanted to do work that makes a difference in
people’s lives, I researched this field and reached out to practitioners for
informational interviews. I quickly learned that I had to have an associate
degree for this work but before I signed up at New School Community
College, I researched the reputation of its program by checking with previ-
ous graduates and with the employers who hire them. I also went online 
to a social network and asked for comments on what people really thought
about the program I was considering making sacrifices to attend. Everything
I heard was good so I attended and now have my degree. It was a great
decision!
 To the issue of the cause of satisfaction in your last career and concern
that you would experience changer’s remorse:

Career change auditions
In a lot of career-changing situations, the com-
pany asks the candidate to audition for the job
by doing it for a few weeks, usually at peanut
wages. This gives the company the opportunity
to make a minimum investment in the oyster that
may or may not have a pearl in it. The audition
similarly gives the candidate a chance to find
out whether his or her career change choice
was as great as anticipated.
I didn’t see the results of all the hard work I put in. The structure was overly
rigid and bureaucratic and, frankly, I like to feel as though my contributions
accomplish a positive outcome. And although I am pretty good with com-
puters, I like to have a slice of my day working with people. I checked out
your company with my network and you get glowing reviews for rewarding
outstanding performance, for giving employees breathing space to accom-
plish their assignments, for being able to observe the fruits of their labor
and for hiring great teams. Is that how you see this company? Are we made
for each other?
More Funny Things That Shouldn’t
Happen on Your Way to Anywhere
The message is clear: To successfully sell a career change, remember to 
logically lay out a bridge explaining why you — with no prior matching 
experience — will be able to handle the job you seek. And take pains to assure
that you, as a career changer, aren’t given to snap judgments and quick reversal.
Funny stuff will happen if you say either of the following bloopers:
 I saw the job posting and, what the hey, this company is in an industry that
I’m willing to give a whirl.
 I’m changing careers because I can’t stand what I’ve been doing and just
need several more quarters for your Social Security.
People actually say things like this in interviews. They don’t realize such
rationales are akin to telling a prospective buyer that you’re selling your
house because the heating bill is too high.

From a base in Weston, Conn., Matt Bud works as chairman of The Financial
Executives Networking Group, a 27,000-member national organization with
local chapters. Most men and women who join The FENG do so when they
must find new jobs but once employed tend to stay aboard, bonding with
other financial professionals as a kind of safety net against future joblessness.
Running The FENG has given Bud a vault full of experience advising transition-
ing executives on the best methods of finding new employment connections.
Based on his experience, Bud observes that many employers have a profile of
a winning candidate in mind. A rejection decision may not be discrimination
but simply that, in the employer’s eyes, the candidate has the wrong profile
for the job being filled.
So rather than refer to age bias, this chapter covers solutions to what I call
age trouble, whether the trouble is due to discrimination or to a wrong pro-
file. The following segment focuses on recognizing and overcoming issues of
age trouble when it stops you in your tracks.

Showing You Improve with Age
Age trouble shows up in many guises. In this overview, I present examples of
questions that may mask common unspoken age-related concerns, followed
by sample responses that show there are no expired shelf-life dates stamped
on your forehead. 
Age and job performance
A big chunk of age trouble is centered on doubts that you can do the work.
Here are three masked put-offs and push-backs.
 This is stressful and demanding work. How well do you work under pres-
sure? (Translation: You may lack the stamina to do the job.)
I work well in all situations and especially well when I’m under pressure. I
like having deadlines. Early on, I learned to set internal deadlines for myself
in all my projects, breaking the projects into segments so I always knew how
I was doing. I consistently brought my projects in on time and on budget.
Internal deadlines are my specialty.
 What do you do to maintain good health? (Translation: You don’t look
too healthy to me and you may not be around long enough to justify
training costs.) 
Maintaining good health is a passion with me. My body mass index is similar
to or better than that of most 30-year-olds. I exercise several times a week.
Once a week I play volleyball on the beach. And I watch what I eat.
 What office software do you use? Do you have a cell phone? (Translation:
You look like you do things the old-school way and we’re into new-school
thinking.)
I’m proficient with (current business software). I took a class for it on my
own time last year at St. Louis community College. My BlackBerry is with
me 24/7. I make it a point to stay current with such major trends in our
industry as (give one or two examples). I’m a member of the World Future
Society.
Age and money
In a world impacted by business budgets, companies may see prime-timers
as too pricey for value received, as the following two examples illustrate:
202
Part III: Actors’ Studio: Casting Your Character 

 What can you bring to this company? (Translation: You expect to earn
more money to start than we want to pay; I can hire someone at half of
what you want.)
I bring a background that includes a related degree and successful years of
experience in a similar position with another company. The contacts I have
already made in my previous positions will help me be productive immedi-
ately, saving costs and earning revenues. My background is an open book,
showing that by any measure I am a bargain!
 What are your monetary expectations of this job? (Translation: You’re a
seasoned worker accustomed to regular raises; our firm won’t be able to
make that kind of commitment, so why am I wasting time interviewing
you?)
Yes, I’ve been rewarded for my contributions to the bottom line for previous
employers. Sometimes the compensation was in the form of a raise and
sometimes it was a performance bonus for meeting goals. If you decide that
I’m the right person for this position, I believe the monetary details won’t
present a problem, and I’ll work with you on making that the case. 
Age and attitude
Prime-timers may be perceived as living in another dimension of values and
viewpoints or as set in their ways, as the following two questions and
responses indicate:
203
Chapter 17: Spotlighting Prime-Timers over 50
The health insurance put-off
Health insurance cost for employees is a mon-
ster age-related cost bite for employers who
consider hiring prime-timers. It’s a tough issue
to beat, says ace job connector Tony Beshara:
“Boomers’ inclusion in a group insurance plan
drives up the cost for an average American
company. Additionally, older workers are per-
ceived to miss more work because of their own
illness or that of their spouse.”
So what’s the answer? Other than carrying your
own health insurance plan and letting the inter-
viewer know you won’t be another policy to
feed, Beshara says the best you can do is look
healthy: “Get in shape, dress sharply, and inter-
view with energy.”
Health insurance in America is under scrutiny
for change. As I write this book, Massachusetts
is the first state to provide nearly universal
healthcare coverage. California’s talking about
it. Other states may follow. Politicians are
proposing national plans. Getting insurance
costs off the back of employers would help level
the global playing field for American enterprise
and open more employment doors for prime-
timers.

 How would you go about doing this job? (Translation: You’re accustomed
to doing things your way, which may not be our way.)
Although I’ve been quite successful in previous positions, I don’t buy the
idea of resting on one’s laurels. I’m always happy to learn new and better
ways to do things. Before suggesting any innovations, I would first make
certain that I understand company policies and ways of working. I am very
excited about this work opportunity and look forward to starting to work
with you as soon as possible.
 You look as though you’ve led too accomplished a life to be returning to
a career now (Translation: You don’t fit in with our young culture.)
I believe that my extensive experience in many productive settings will be
of great benefit to your company because (give one or two examples). I
can work effectively with people of all ages. In fact, I really like working
with young people because I respect their energy and vitality and fresh
look at challenges.
Outing the Elephant: Addressing 
Age Concerns
Have you heard the expression “If there’s an elephant in the room, introduce
it?” That’s the topic of Matt Bud’s advice to members of his networking group.
Matt Bud is chairman of The Financial Executives Networking Group. He warns
prime-timers that it’s a huge mistake to avoid an age-related issue that the
interviewer may be wary of bringing up directly. That’s because an age zinger
becomes an elephant in a small room — impossible to overlook, an obvious
truth that is being ignored. Instead, get the sensitive question out in the open
where you can take control of it.
In a communication to The FENG, Bud wrote of “Ensuring a Productive
Interview.” What follows is a part of what Bud counseled:
Among difficult questions an interviewer would like to ask you, a big one is
age related: How much longer are you planning to work?
Close to being an illegal question even if the job is potentially long term or
might involve a move, the interviewer may not ask but the question is hang-
ing out there, and until you get it out of the way, not much will happen during
an interview.
If you choose not to address it, the interviewer may be trying to think up a
way to politely ask you instead of listening to your very fine offerings about
your many talents and how they could be applied to the job in question.
204
Part III: Actors’ Studio: Casting Your Character 

Don’t wait to be put on the defensive that may cause you to flush red-faced
or stammer. My experience has been that most folks are uncomfortable
with the answers to these kinds of questions and hope they won’t come up.
Wrong! Get your story out in exactly the way you want it to be heard. When
an elephant is in the room blocking the doorway to your progress, it is in
the best interests of both parties to get this and other difficult questions out
of the way early in the interview so that more important matters can be
addressed.
The interview won’t move forward until you expose and conquer hidden
hiring objections.
Overcoming the Overqualified Label
Overqualified may be code for one of five perceptions. Interviewers may use
it to indicate that you
 Have too many years’ experience
 Have too much education
 Will want to be too highly paid
 Are too rigid with demands
 Are too rusted with obsolete skills
In my view, when you’re told you’re overqualified for a position, you can usu-
ally chalk it up to the first perception — age trouble.
But Dallas-based Tony Beshara is a job-finding whiz who disagrees that being
rated as overqualified for a position is because of age trouble, and he has
strong credentials to back up his opinion. Beshara runs Babich and Associates,
one of the nation’s most successful job placement firms, and he personally has
connected thousands of people with employment. Beshara says:
When a candidate of any age applies for a job one step or more below the
level of his or her previous position, a hiring authority is going to be con-
cerned that the candidate will be underemployed, depart as soon as some-
thing better turns up, and leave the authority holding the blame for a bad
choice. The same overqualified tag could be applied to a 35- or 40-year-old
candidate, but since the predominant numbers of people going down the
career ladder are in their 50s, the overqualified experience appears to be an
age thing, but it’s not.
In either case, whether you’re dealing with age trouble or not, why go down
with the one-word punch of being rated as “overqualified”? Come back with 
a strong response — or a pre-emptive strike to clear the air.
205
Chapter 17: Spotlighting Prime-Timers over 50

To combat concerns of overqualification, use the following tactics:
 Clarify the interviewer’s concerns. Find out whether the interviewer
really thinks you’re overqualified — or just overaged — and whether
you’ll want to earn too much money or be bored by the position.
 Enthusiastically address the interviewer’s concerns, emphasizing the
positive. Explain how you can grow in this position.
 Show how you can use your experience to benefit the company in solving
long-term problems, building profit, or assisting in other departments.
 Make sure that the interviewer understands your qualifications.
 If you’ll be working in an office full of younger people, explain how you’re
an anchor. You’re experienced, calm, stable, reliable, and you can provide
day-to-day continuity.
Here are six model responses to the overqualified put-off:
Overqualified? Some would say that I’m not overqualified but fully qualified.
With due respect, could you explain the problem with someone doing the
job better than expected?
Fortunately, I’ve lived enough years to have developed the judgment that
allows me to focus on the future. Before we speak of past years, past titles,
and past salaries, can we look at my strengths and abilities and how I’ve
stayed on the cutting edge of my career field, including its technology?
I hope you’re not concerned that hiring someone with my solid experience
and competencies would look like age bias if once on the job you decided
you’d made a mistake and I had to go. Can I present a creative idea? Why
don’t I work on a trial basis for a month — no strings — to give you a
chance to view me up close? This immediately solves your staffing problem
at no risk to you. I can hit the floor running and require less supervision
than a less experienced worker. When can I start?
This job is so attractive to me that I’m willing to sign a contract committing
to stay for a minimum of 12 months. There’s no obligation on your part.
How else can I convince you that I’m the best person for this position?
My family’s grown. And I’m no longer concerned with title and salary — I
like to keep busy. A reference check will show I do my work on time and do
it well as a team member. I’m sure we can agree on a salary that fits your
budget. When can we make my time your time?
Salary is not my top priority. Not that I have a trust fund, but I will work for
less money, will take direction from managers of any age, will continue to
stay current on technology and will not leave you in the lurch if Hollywood
calls to make me a star. And I don’t insist that it’s my way or the highway.

Top Hints for Prime-Timers
As good actors and actresses grow older, they no longer have to prove their
talent, but they do have to prove that they still have what it takes to play a
demanding role.
Take the following A-game hints to heart, two of which are suggested by con-
tributing experts Liz Ryan, acclaimed speaker and writer on networking and
the new-millennium workplace, and Tony Beshara, author of Acing the
Interview: How to Ask and Answer the Questions That Will Get You the Job!
(AMACOM, 2008).
 Experiment with statements clarifying that contributing to the employer’s
goals is your first priority.
 Storytell — prepare examples of your high energy, fresh enthusiasm, and
willingness to compete.
 Carry yourself with a young attitude. Enter the room with pep in your
step.
 Liz Ryan advises that you think of concrete examples of times when you
overcame an obstacle, made a save, and had a breakthrough solution.
Talk about how you deal with change. Work these things into the conver-
sation before they’re asked. Overcome any sense that people your age
can’t hustle.

Radio babies and retirement reversal
Are you way over 50? If so, you may be in the
generation born in the years 1930-1945, some-
times called radio babies (guess why). Perhaps
you decided to opt out of the workforce for a
period of time and now want back in. How do
you best answer the following question?
Why are you looking for a job after being
retired for three years?
The effective answer is not that you need the
money or that you were bored out of your mind
with your job.
For a ShowStopper answer, follow this line of
persuasion:
 Retired? Who retired? Explain that you
didn’t actually do the R-word. Discuss pos-
itive reasons for taking time off. Everyone
needs to refresh and refill from time to time.
Now you’re opting back in.
 Discuss work with enthusiasm and declare
that you’re itching to get back to it.
 Describe how you can contribute to the
company in chapter-and-verse detail. 

 Tony Beshara suggests that you build rapport with an interviewer by
mirroring his or her body language in the first few minutes. If the inter-
viewer crosses arms or leans back in the chair, you cross arms and lean
back in the chair. But as the interview develops, present yourself in an
open, direct, and assertive manner. Keep your feet planted on the floor,
your arms open at your sides or on the arms of a chair, and lean forward
just enough to make good eye contact. If your body language isn’t appro-
priate, your words may never be heard.
 Don’t enter an interviewing room with the attitude that your experience
should speak for itself. Merely listing your tasks doesn’t impress employ-
ers. Instead answer the so-what question: Explain what difference you
made and how your experience translates to their needs right now.
 Downplay ancient history. Unless you have a compelling reason to look
way back in your career, focus your comments on the past 10 or 15 years.
Talk only about your past experience that relates to the job at hand.
 To get around being seen as a tiresome know-it-all, don’t constantly say
“I know.” Instead, acknowledge an interviewer’s statement with “That’s
interesting.” “You make a good point.” “I see what you mean.”
 Don’t fall into the trap of thinking “uppity child” when you’re being inter-
viewed by a younger hiring manager. Your interview mindset should
realign your ideas of authority: Mutual respect is the right tone — even
when the interviewer is young enough to be your kid.
 Use the question technique to avoid seeming to take charge of the inter-
view: “Did I fully explain how I can make a difference in solving the prob-
lem we’ve just discussed?” or “Have I left unanswered any questions that
you may have about my being the best person for this position?” When
the answer indicates no reservations remain, smile and ask “When do I
start?”

When the boss is your kid’s age
Tony G., a reader of my newspaper column,
wrote to me to say that at age 60 he had just
landed an excellent position with a start-up
company after being interviewed by the 33-
year-old company president, who coincidentally
is the same age as his son. The other three
employees are in their late 20s, as are Tony’s
daughters. Tony credits his success to his lack
of neophobia (fear of new things).
“I think I was offered the job because of my atti-
tude during the interview. I made it clear to the
young boss that I would rather work with people
in ‘your age bracket’ because there is so much
energy and new, fresh ideas. That’s the envi-
ronment where I want to work,” Tony said with
conviction.
Advising other prime-timers, Tony added: “Think
young, think responsibly, and always be pre-
pared to put something solid and attractive on
the interview table.”

Keep Your Career Fit and 
Stay Out of Corners
Everyone 50 and over knows that scooping up choice jobs isn’t the cinch it
often was when you were younger. As a prime-timer, you can greatly improve
your odds of being chosen by learning new and improved job search skills,
particularly the A-game interviewing techniques that determine what comes
next in your life.

Greener pastures
Do you know that the Federal government is the
nation’s largest employer, is age diverse and
that 85 percent of federal jobs are located out-
side of the Washington, D.C., area (including
Virginia and Maryland)? Being accepted into
the federal workplace is complex. Before you
hit the 143 federal job boards (federal
jobs.net/federal.htm), get the whole
picture. Two books excel in shepherding you
through the thicket of merit hiring practices.
They are
 The Book of U.S. Government Jobs: Where
They Are, What’s Available & How to Get
One, Tenth Edition, by Dennis V. Damp
(Bookhaven Press, 2008). This excellent
guide contains an instructive chapter on
federal interviewing.
 The Federal Resume Guidebook: Strategies
for Writing a Winning Federal Electronic
Resume, KSAs, and Essays, by Kathryn
Kraemer Troutman, Fourth Edition (JIST
Works, 2007). This is a must-have book for
the serious federal job hunter who hopes to
get as far as the interviewing stage.

Q
uestions and answers are dialogue on the stage of job interviews. This
chapter is devoted to questions and answers that spotlight you and
your dreams, talent, and motivation in reaching your audience.
Many of this chapter’s questions attempt to examine the kind of person you
are. For example:
 Interviewers want to know what’s right with you: Are you team-oriented
about rolling up your sleeves to get a project done even when it’s not in your
job description? Can you give me an illustration of when that was the case?
 Interviewers want to know what’s wrong with you: If I brought up your
name with former coworkers, what would they say about you?
To unearth that information, interviewers often start with one agony-inducing
question. In this chapter, I show you how to address that question with a
“personal commercial” that makes you a must-hire.
Answering a Very Broad 
Question Specifically
In trying to figure out whether you’re the right person to hire, interviewers
usually open fire with the big bazooka of self-revealing questions, often
phrased as a statement:

Tell me a little about yourself.
No matter how the question is worded, take care to get your act together for
it because it comes early in an interview — at the very time when an inter-
viewer is forming an initial impression of you.
A good beginning sets the stage for the halo effect to kick in (see Chapter 9).
The halo effect happens when an interviewer is impressed with you right off
the bat and may assume that if you excel in one area, you excel in others.
When you start to tell about yourself, focus on aspects of your life that illus-
trate your value as a candidate for the position you seek. In addition to know-
ing you have competencies, skills, and experience related to the potential
work, employers want to feel confident that you’re the sort of person who
 Can do the job
 Will do the job
 Gets along with others while doing the job
Employers want to know how well you accept management direction. They
want to know whether you have a history of slacking off as you get too com-
fortable on a job. They want to know whether — despite their lack of long-
term commitment to you — you will jump ship at an inconvenient time if
another employer dangles more money before your eyes.
When answering the Tell Me About Yourself question, bear the following
thought in mind:
Focus on the Best You.
In sticking to the Best You theme, you may ask, “But isn’t that kind of like
lying?” No. Lying is a time bomb that doesn’t travel well.
I know a woman who did not inflate her previous salary — instead, she did
the opposite, lowering it because she didn’t want to be considered overquali-
fied for a job she wanted. After 11 months she was fired for lying when her
reference checks finally caught up with her. The week before that she had
been offered a promotion!
Always be honest about the wonderful parts of you. But don’t blurt out any-
thing that could make you look like a poor hiring choice. Neither should you
wildly exaggerate your best traits to the extent that your performance bears
no relationship to your promise — remember that the piper who lives down
the road will demand to be paid.
214
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

Shading your answers packs a punch
A careful questioner hears not only your lyrics, or content, in response to the
self-defining question. The questioner also listens to your music, or where
you choose to play fortissimo:
 Do you focus on your competencies and skills, your education and train-
ing as they relate to the job? The interviewer is likely to conclude —
hooray! — that you’re work-oriented.
 Do you focus on your hobbies? The interviewer may decide that you’re
more interested in your leisure hours, working only because you don’t
want to starve to death.
 Do you focus on your present job? The employer may think that you’re
still attached to your current haunts and not ready to move on. Or 
that you’ll cynically use a job offer merely to leverage a counteroffer
from your boss.
Narrow the question
You can jump right in and answer the Tell Me About Yourself, or you can ask
for prompts:

Chapter 18: What Can You Tell Me about Yourself?
A contrarian expert speaks
In the Different-Strokes-for-Different-Folks
Department: Ace placement professional Neil 
P. McNulty (www.mcnultymanagement.
com) of Virginia Beach, Virginia, has made hun-
dreds of individual placements over 25 years.
McNulty is a cut-to-the-chase kind of guy who
advises his candidates to stick to business.
Here’s McNulty’s take on the Tell Me About
Yourself question:
“Job hunting book experts say the question is
asked because the interviewer wants to hear
how you organize your thoughts, learn how you
articulate your career ambitions, and see how
you present yourself when under pressure.
That’s not always the case.
“The real reason it’s asked is often because the
interviewer is unprepared, doesn’t know where
to begin, and while you are speaking, he or she
is trying to figure out what to ask you next.
“I teach candidates to give a two-minute (max)
chronological rundown of their professional 
history — no personal information — just a list
of positions held, ending the rundown with this
statement: This brings us to today. Tell me, what
exactly do you want someone to do for you in
this position? The tactic gives the interviewer 
a direction to go and also gives the candidate a
‘needs target’ to shoot at as the interview 
develops.”

I can tell you about experience and accomplishments in this industry, or the
education and training that qualify me for this position, or about my per-
sonal history. Where shall I start?
Employers typically answer that they want to hear about both your work and
relevant background — or a little bit of everything.
Write Your Marketing Pitch
The sensible way to make star tracks in responding to a request to tell about
yourself is to memorize — literally memorize — a personal commercial about
yourself. Your “show and sell” bit should run between one and two minutes.
Think for a few seconds about what a commercial does. It focuses on selling a
product in a blink of time. It grabs your attention fast with information of
interest to you. Then it tells why you should buy the product.
Your personal commercial works exactly the same way by enabling you to
 Grab employers’ interest with a confident statement about yourself and
your value related to the job you want.
 Support that statement with specific facts.
 Sell employers on why they should hire you instead of someone else.
I wasn’t kidding about memorizing your personal commercial. Practice 
until it sounds natural. Just like an actor, you need to learn your script and
deliver it in character. No stumbling. No ad-libbing.
Perhaps you’re not so sure about that advice. Won’t all this memorization
make you sound as canned as a tin of tuna? Maybe. But which would you
prefer — to sound a bit stiff or to flounder about as though you have no idea
why you’re there or why you’re right for the job or why you have marbles in
your mouth? Duh.
Depending on your experience level and the job you’re trying to land, your
personal commercial can include any or all of the following information:
 Competencies, skills, and experience for the job
 Academic degree
 Positions of leadership
 Specific job training
 Date of expected graduation (if applicable)
216
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

 Honors or achievements
 General goals 
 A branding brief (See the sidebar, “New tool: A branding brief,” at the
end of this chapter.)
Sample Personal Commercials
A prospective new graduate applying for a Web news site start-up might use a
personal commercial something like this:
Your need for a Web editor who can handle breaking news deadlines is just
what I want and am qualified to handle. Working and attending school full
time taught me to organize and prioritize for superior time management
skills — I wouldn’t have succeeded without mastering these skills.
Considering the demand of deadlines, I see multitasking skills as especially
important in a journalism career.
I will graduate in May from the University of Kansas with a Bachelor of Arts
in Journalism. I was a feature writer on the school’s Web site and the student
newspaper. I would have been named editor, but I worked throughout my
education to pay for 80 percent of my school expenses. At the same time, I
managed to maintain a high GPA, so I expect to graduate cum laude.
A seasoned manager’s personal commercial highlights accomplishments and
experience. For example:
I am an experienced line manager with extensive knowledge in team-build-
ing that ranges from organizing project teams to informally encouraging
people to work together. I’ve developed solid skills in hiring and retaining
employees.
I also have incorporated technological advances into a company where
such advances require a significant amount of employee retraining.
Additionally, my track record is substantial in major presentations to clients,
which has led to as much as an 87 percent increase in product adoption
from the year I took over.
In summary, I believe I have the required skills and experience you seek for
this position, as well as the technological savvy and a positive attitude
toward implementing change. Is my background on the mark?
You can create one all-purpose personal commercial (think core commercial)
and edit it on your feet to make it fit the requirements of the position you seek.
217
Chapter 18: What Can You Tell Me about Yourself?

Or if — like me — you’re not too hot at instant editing, prepare several differ-
ent personal commercials aimed at related but different types of jobs. Tweak
the appropriate version and rehearse yourself before each interview. 
Admittedly, this tip is a no-brainer, but recruiters tell me that surprisingly few
candidates include personal commercial prep in their interview planning.
Try writing your own personal commercial. Describe your experience, com-
petencies, and skills that are relevant to the type of position you want. Make
the information interesting and remember to sell rather than tell employers
what you’ve got and why they should want it.
The Questions
Readers of previous editions of this book tell me that they need more help
with two other questions: What is your greatest weakness? Why should I hire
you? This edition elaborates on those puzzlers.
For the following questions in this chapter, ShowStoppers are answers that
work for you; Clunkers and Bloopers are answers that work against you.
What is your most memorable accomplishment?
ShowStoppers
 Relate an accomplishment directly to the job for which you’re 
interviewing.
 Give details about the accomplishment, as if you’re telling a story.
 Describe results.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Give a vague or unfocused answer.
 Discuss an accomplishment with no connection to the job you want.
 Discuss responsibilities instead of results.
Where do you see yourself five years from now? How does this position fit
with your long-term career objectives?
ShowStoppers
 Say you hope your hard work has moved you appropriately forward on
your career track.
218
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

 Answer realistically: In a changed business world where a long-term job
may mean three years, speak of lifelong education to keep abreast of
changes in your field and self-reliance for your own career.
 Describe short-term, achievable goals and discuss how they will help
you reach your long-term goals.
 Explain how the position you want will help you to reach your goals.
 Strive to look ambitious, but not too much so that you threaten the
hiring manager.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say that you want the interviewer’s job.
 Describe unrealistic goals.
 State goals that aren’t consistent with the company’s needs or ability to
satisfy.
What is your greatest strength?
ShowStoppers
 Anticipate and prepare to discuss up to five strengths, such as
• Skill in managing your work schedule
• Willingness to do extra
• Ability to learn quickly
• Proactivity in solving problems
• Team-building
• Leadership
• Cool-headed temperament under pressure
 Discuss only strengths related to the position you want.
 Use specific examples to illustrate. Include statistics and testimonials.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Discuss strengths unrelated to the job you want.
 Fumble around, saying that you don’t feel comfortable bragging on 
yourself.
 For women only: Bring up the fact that you’re president of your child’s
PTA, (unless you’re interviewing for a job selling school supplies).

What is your greatest weakness?
ShowStoppers
 Because of the corrective action you took, you were able to transform a
starting point of failure into a success story of strength. Three examples
follow: 
• I didn’t always know what I was doing — right or wrong — when I
took my first managerial position. So I took online classes in manage-
rial techniques, read management books, and paid attention to how
managers whom I admired operated. As a result, I give careful
thought to the quality of guidance that I give my direct reports before
launching a project. I’m not yet perfect and may never be — I’m my
own toughest critic — but, as the record shows, my leadership has
improved dramatically in motivating the productivity achievements
of my teams.
• Not being a natural techie, I was underperforming when I first worked
with X word processing software. So I took a class in that software
program at a community college on my own time and now I’m the
best administrative assistant in my office.
• I’ve had trouble in the past with remembering the timing of every
appointment when I had to move like lightning across town from
one sales call to another sales call. But I’ve corrected that scheduling
problem with this terrific digital device — let me show it to you.
I haven’t missed a call since I got it.

Expert contrarian discusses strengths
Virginia Beach, Virginia placement pro Neil P.
McNulty notes that placement experts advise
you to have at least two or three significant
achievements to describe, preferably in mini-
story format.
“That is good information,” McNulty says.
“What they leave out is the fact that most of the
entire job-hunting populace consists simply of
average, hardworking, everyday people —
most of whom have not done anything of
tremendous importance. I teach such candi-
dates that I place to answer this way:
I have done many things that I consider signifi-
cant, but nothing that really rocked the business
world. The bottom line is that I am a hardwork-
ing, results-oriented, high-energy individual
who gets the job done — and done right. My
work is always on time, of correct quantity and
quality, and if you hire me, you can expect noth-
ing less, whatever the task.
My two cents: Rarely is there a job search
question so universal in outcome that any given
rule must always be followed. Thanks, Neil
McNulty, for another slant.

 I’m not a global thinker. But, being detail-minded, I’m a topnotch staffer to
an executive who is a big-picture guy.
 I don’t pretend to be a gifted trial lawyer. But I’ll stack my legal research
and business structure skills up against any other lawyer in town.
 As a newcomer to this city, I can’t bring a clientele to this job but I can use
my talent for public presentations to build one faster than you can say
“Give me a quote.” I have a plan to attract clients by quickly becoming
known as a speaker at local club meetings and civic events.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Mention a brutally honest negative, such as you’re hard to work with,
you’re easily bored, you don’t get along well with minority coworkers,
you have a poor memory, or that stress exhausts you.
 Fall back on clichés. Examples: You’re a workaholic. (My boss has to
shove me out the door every night to make me go home.) You’re a perfec-
tionist. (The devil is in the time-eating details and I sweat every one.) But
even clichés sometimes work for very young candidates.
 Say you have no weaknesses.
 Volunteer key weaknesses that are likely to go unnoticed in the hiring
decision.
What are your outside interests, including sports? Do you IM (instant 
message)? What books/magazine/blogs have you read recently? What
movies/TV have you seen?
ShowStoppers
 Be enthusiastic.
 Tell why you enjoy the activities you mention.
 Focus on team-oriented, active hobbies — usually sports over reading.
 If possible, show how your hobbies or reading materials help you in
your work.
 Focus on traditional or new media that relate to personal growth.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say that you don’t have any outside interests. Just work.
 Discuss extreme solo sports, unless applicable to the job you want.
 Mention vampire-like fiction, horror, or violent media. (Stick to business
and news.)

 Mention the importance of every team member’s contribution.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Let the interviewer think that you’re a pushover, willing to carry the load
of team members who don’t contribute.
 Say you don’t like to work on teams.
What is your definition of success? Of failure?
ShowStoppers
 Show that your success is balanced between your professional and per-
sonal lives.
 Relate success to the position you want.
 If you have to talk about failure, do so positively. Show how you turned
a failure into a success or discuss how and what you learned from the
failure.
 Demonstrate that you’re a happy person who thinks the world is more
good than bad.

things (Because I live nearby) or mumble threadbare clichés (Because I’m
honest and show up).
223
Chapter 18: What Can You Tell Me about Yourself?

The best because it’s an invitation to repeat your strengths and other factors
that distinguish you as the perfect person for the job.
Moreover, because it’s usually the last question, your answer may stick in the
interviewer’s memory.
Your basic answer relates the work (in the workplace or in school) that you’ve
done to the work you’re going to do. It covers your unique combination of
specific skills, knowledge (including education and training), and experience.
Get ready to own this question with the help of these four steps:
1. Review your research on the company (see Chapter 6). Review the job
description.
When you lack a job description or research, ask questions: Can you tell
me a bit about what problems you need solved? What would you expect
the person hired for this position to accomplish in the first six months? 
2. Show how the work you’ve done relates to the work you’re going to
do. Or, if you’re a rookie or a career-changer, show how your skills
cross over.
Explain how your education qualifies you. Make the connection memo-
rable with behavioral storytelling (see Chapter 5). Refer to your per-
sonal commercial or branding brief (the latter is described at the end of
this chapter).
3. Mention shared values, which you glean from the company’s mission
statement and reputation: I totally agree with and applaud the company’s
strong stand against setting up debt traps for the nation’s working poor.
4. Declare your interest in wanting the job.
Here are three examples of how you might style your answer:
 Your job posting says you’re looking for an administrative assistant who
can help keep the IT department functioning smoothly. That’s what I’ve
done almost all of my career, which means I have 12 years’ experience in
exactly this function. I am very familiar with software, contract administra-
tion, and sleuthing out trouble spots. My former and present employers say
I helped them grow their business each year. I feel confident that I can do
the same for you.
 You told me earlier in this meeting that your main concern in filling this
position is that the customer service trainee manager focuses on improving
communications with our customer base. I can do that! During my intern-
ships at X and Y Corporations, I observed a number of techniques that you
may want to think about implementing here. For example, (name two tech-
niques). The techniques are credited with boosting customer satisfaction
and retention by 14 percent.

In addition to my management studies (name them) that provided the useful
knowledge to do this job better than the typical applicant, I showed leader-
ship in restructuring the mechanics of my college’s student government office
while serving as secretary. Additionally, I was one of five senior students
voted most likely to succeed in business. I want this job, and I hope I have
given you the reasons why you want me in this job.
 As I understand your needs in this law firm, you’re looking for an attorney
who can provide specialist topnotch legal research to meet a challenge to
one of a client’s best-selling drugs. In addition to my five years of general
research experience at respected law firms, my work on the Excalibur vs.
Marston case last year was described in law journals as central to the
client’s win.
I share your enthusiasm for chasing down every last lead to maintain qual-
ity advocacy, counsel and integrity in client service. I’ve got my eye on this
position. How do I rank in the candidate pool at this point?
As you work out your own unique response, you may have to think on your
feet if the interviewer surprises you with new facts or a call for skills you
hadn’t anticipated. In the meantime, review the basics to answer Why Should
I Hire You?
ShowStoppers
 Prepare at least three key reasons to roll off your tongue that show how
you’re better than the other candidates.
 Use specific examples to illustrate your reasons.
225
Chapter 18: What Can You Tell Me about Yourself?
Do performance reviews belong at a job interview?
Displaying actual copies of your review data on
an interview is risky for two reasons, advises
James M. Lemke, director of organizational
development for Opportunity International, and
this book’s technical reviewer.
First, the review data is usually considered a
company’s proprietary information. Second, a
perfect review is rare and Murphy’s Law (If any-
thing can go wrong, it will.) periodically sur-
faces in job interviews.
“Most review documents include spaces to
suggest areas that need improvement, such as
organizational skills or written communication
abilities,” Lemke says. “If Murphy is at work the
day you show off your review, you may lose 
out on a job opportunity by giving too much
information.”
Here’s a better way to get your points across.
Compile a quotation sheet (Q sheet) with
excerpts of complimentary statements from
your reviews. Hold your Q sheet until the inter-
view is drawing to a close. You need not go into
detail about the source. Just suggest: “Perhaps
you’d like to see what some of my previous
managers have said about me.” A well-done Q
sheet adds extra punch to your exit.

New tool: The branding brief
Kathryn Kraemer Troutman, executive career
consultant and CEO of The Resume Place, Inc.
(www.resume-place.com) in Baltimore,
recommends that job seekers devise an abbre-
viated personal marketing message, one that
she terms a branding brief. The length of a
branding brief is 20-30 seconds, or about 100
words.
A similar synoposis may also be called an ele-
vator speech, personal branding message, or
profile summary; all these terms refer to a cap-
sule of your “story” as it relates to an employer.
All are shorter than your personal commercial,
which I describe earlier in this chapter.
Consider incorporating a branding brief within
your one-to-two minute personal commercial
for interviews, or use it as a stand-alone state-
ment in networking.
A branding brief headlines what you are known
for. It identifies your special characteristics and
achievements of interest to an employer. You
can use a branding brief to help people remem-
ber who you are, why you’re memorable, and
when they should seek you, Troutman explains.
“In constructing a branding brief, describe your
top characteristics and how they can contribute
to the mission of an organization that you hope
to join. And clearly state how you can help
achieve the organization’s mission.” Here are a
half-dozen of Troutman’s examples:
 As a kid, I listened to old radio programs
that said things like “The Shadow Knows . . .”
Right then I developed a life-long passion
for radio. In a complex media marketplace,
you can count on me as a proven program-
ming manager to target and deliver larger
audiences.
I offer expert marketing and distribution
skills that I’ll stack up against anyone’s in
the business. As a programming chief, I’ve
got the whole package of skills, from affili-
ate contract negotiation and content, to
audience and technology. In short, I hope
you’ll agree that I know more about leading
a programming effort than the Shadow ever
knew . . . although the Shadow knew a lot!
 My name is Keri Bright and I formerly
taught English at Martingale High School,
where I was known for establishing com-
munity literacy programs to teach immi-
grants how to read and write English. My
bilingual skills would be useful as an aide in
the Congressman’s office.
 I’m JoAnn Thomas Reed, and I’m a people-
friendly IT specialist. I offer expert consult-
ing services to your staff and managers for
data management services you can be
proud of. Think of me when you want a real
pro who speaks plain English. I’ve always
believed that geek is chic and nerd is nice.
Give me a chance to prove it and you’ll be
glad you did.
 I’m a cosmos professional. After managing
Space Shuttle Orbit Operations for 16 years,
I’m well qualified to contribute to Space
Station operations. My number-one goal
will be the efficient, cost-effective manage-
ment of resources to achieve our mission
objective of building a new shuttle by 2010.
My 16 years of NASA science includes
direction of space engineering technology,
leadership of engineers and technicians,
and performance measurements. I am pas-
sionate about contributing to the opera-
tional success of the Space Shuttle
missions now and in the future.

227
Chapter 18: What Can You Tell Me about Yourself?
 Tell something unusual or unique about you that will make the inter-
viewer remember you. You can use a branding brief, described in the 
sidebar “New tool: The branding brief,” for this purpose.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Dance around this question (Because I want the job.), leaving without
really addressing it.
 You would be an asset to the company bowling team; you have a win-
ning smile; you are tired of living with your parents; you can lie with a
straight face; your house payment is overdue; your brother needs help
paying off his gambling debts.
 Say, “Because you’re trying to fill a position.”
 I successfully worked as a library techni-
cian in the James River Free Library, with
diverse accomplishments ranging from
multimedia productions and program
development, to speaker recruitment and
publication selection for special markets.
After getting real library experience for six
years, I invested in a library science degree
program to upgrade my professional com-
petencies and skills. Now I am ready to
begin work on blending technology,
archives and library services in efficient
and affordable programs to excite library
patrons.
 My career as a logistics specialist — some
people call that supply-chain specialist —
is very rewarding as I work to see that
important materials and resources get to
the right place at the right time for the right
price. I’m a perfect fit for your position,
where I would continue working my magic
for your customers — managing inventory,
distributing goods, and monitoring the qual-
ity of materials provided.

What Do You Know about This
Job and Our Company?
In This Chapter
 Proving that you understand the job
 Showing savvy about the company
 Confirming that you know the industry
 Answering sample questions for practice
W
hen you’re aiming for a professional or managerial job, expect a
number of questions to be fired across the footlights that test your
knowledge of the position, company, and industry.
Even when your aspirations are less lofty and your goal is to be hired as a
supporting player, knowing something about some of the topics in this chap-
ter can put you in the take-a-bow category of candidates.
Understand Job, Company, Industry —
and How They All Fit Together
Employers expect you to grasp what the job entails and how the job fits into
the overall company picture. For responsible professional jobs, they’re even
more impressed if you have looked into what the company does and where it
stands in its industry.
An interviewer may test your knowledge with questions like this:
Where would you rank this company in the marketplace and why?

Such a question requires you to go into some detail about the company’s
place in the scheme of things — its products, profitability, industry position,
goals, and vulnerability to buyout.
An interviewer may not look at your answers for definitive details, but he is
interested in how you arrived at your conclusions. You could say:
You ranked second in the industry in total earnings last year, so that’s a pos-
itive. Your level of debt is a little high, but that was the result of tooling up
for your next line of products due out in June. If the new line is as successful
as forecast, then most of the rest of the company debt will be wiped out by
new sales, leaving the company with a shot at being the most financially
secure in the industry. Plus, you still enjoy an enormous potential for growth
in the near future.
If you mention problems in the company’s performance, offer general solu-
tions (additional training, financial fixes, workforce restructuring, and the
like). Otherwise you appear clueless, or as some interviewers may say: Nice
cage, no bird. Or, all foam, no beer. Or, all hat, no cattle. You get the idea.
To model credibility, you can beef up your general solutions with specifics
that suggest you’re doing more than merely guessing. That is, cite statistics
and figures to back up the problems you note along with your bright ideas to
remedy them.
A caution: Reflect before following interviewing advice you may have read
elsewhere that urges you to Superman-leap tall problems in a single bound.
Certain difficulties may have eluded resolution by company managers for
good reasons. On the outside looking in, chances are you don’t have all the
facts on the ground.

What Are Your Skills 
and Competencies?
In This Chapter
 Spotting skills questions
 Addressing competencies questions
 Responding to skills and competencies questions
 Practicing with sample questions
W
ith job security in today’s market going the way of the ozone layer, the
operative words are skills (what you can do) and, increasingly, a newer
and broader employment concept termed competencies (how well you do
what you do using natural talents).
The competencies concept includes skills and such related characteristics
and natural abilities as motivation, industriousness, and attitudes.
In other words, the competency-based interviewing approach attempts to look
at the whole package where you’re concerned. Suppose, for example, that
you’re a certified expert in Java and there’s no question about your skill level.
Competency questions attempt to uncover whether you also have the soft
skills you need to pursue successful work projects where organization, coop-
eration, and communication ease are essential. (Or whether your quirky 
personality drives colleagues to the aspirin bottle.)
Competency-based models fall into two categories:
 Work-based competencies describe job-specific characteristics, skills,
and abilities, such as fluency in the English language or the ability to
read topographical maps.
 Behavior-based competencies describe all the other personal stuff you
need, in addition to technical skills, to do the job well. Competencies
include abilities like:

• Prioritizing and planning work
• Using time efficiently
• Planning for additional resources
• Adapting to new technologies
• Keeping technical skills up to date
A competency-based interview is highly-structured and based on the premise
that past success is the best predictor of future success. Many questions
designed to reveal behavioral competencies begin with “Tell me about a time
when . . .” (See Chapter 5 to find out about the behavior-based interview.)
How much must you know about competency-based interviewing? That
depends upon where you’re interviewing. The competency-based interview-
ing approach is on the rise but isn’t yet a mainstream interviewing method
for the majority of jobs in the United States. You can expect competency-based
interviewing at larger companies and the federal government.
By contrast, small and medium-sized employers (where most of the jobs are)
tend to stick to skills discovery in their interview questions. Their interview-
ers make informal judgments about how well candidates will use their skills
on the job.
Be aware that some overlap in everyday usage of terminology occurs: That 
is, one interviewer’s skills is another interviewer’s competencies. To keep it
simple, in this chapter I use the s-word — skills.
When you expect to be heading into a competencies-based quizzing, consider
reading an entire book on the approach: Competency-Based Interviews: Master
the Tough New Interview Style and Give Them the Answers That Will Win You
the Job, by Robin Kessler (Career Press, 2006).
Recognizing Questions about Your Skills
Accomplishments, like some wines, don’t always travel well. You catch an
employer’s eye with accomplishments, but when you change jobs, you leave
your accomplishments behind.
What you do pack along with you are the skills that enabled you to achieve
those accomplishments: subject mastery, meeting deadlines, and researching
on the Internet, for instance.
Experienced interviewers move past the citations of what you did to discover
how you did it — the essence of your skills.
236
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

Interviewers may be straightforward in trying to determine your skills through
questions about specific work experiences:
Tell me about a time that a supervisor gave you a new project when you
were racing the clock to complete an earlier-assigned project.
Or you may be tossed a pretend workplace scenario and asked how you’d
handle the situation:
You’re monitoring and integrating control feedback in a petrochemical pro-
cessing facility to maintain production flow when the system suddenly goes
down; what do you do?
Other questions are less direct, going in a conversational side door to see
how you react using such skills as conflict-management and interpersonal
relationships:
How would you deal with a difficult boss?
To pull off a ShowStopper interview, learn to recognize questions that spot-
light the skills you bring to a job stage.
Answering Questions about Your Skills
Use storytelling (Check out Chapter 5.) to comprehensively answer skills
questions. Remember, too, that social, or soft, skills (people skills) play a sig-
nificant role in determining the winning candidate. Take pains to convince the
interviewer that you’re a pleasant individual who gets along with people.
Take that question in the previous section about how you’d deal with a diffi-
cult boss. Here’s an answer, underscored with storytelling that makes you
look like a reasonable and conscientious person:
I would first try to make sure that the difficulty isn’t walking around in my
shoes. Then I’d read a few books on how to interact with difficult people.
I’ve never had a boss I didn’t like, but I have had to use tact on occasion.
On my last job, my boss and I didn’t see eye to eye on the best software for
an office application. I researched the issue in detail and wrote a short, fact-
filled report for my boss. Based on this new information, my boss then
bought the software I recommended.
This answer centers on research skills but also highlights patience and
acceptance of supervision.
237
Chapter 20: What Are Your Skills and Competencies?

The Questions
The sample skills questions in this chapter are generalized for wider applica-
tion, although in an interview you should expect skills questions that relate
to your career field: What computer skills do you have? Why do you think your
technical skills are a match for this job? When is the best time to close a sale?
What was your most difficult auditing problem and how did you solve it? Tell me
about your typical workday as a probation officer.
Note that questions in this chapter may seem to be close relatives of the
questions in Chapter 19. The difference is that those in Chapter 19 are
intended to draw out your qualities as a human being; those in this chapter
go after your skills. Is it a big goof if you mix them up? Not at all. Both are
reminders to keep your self-marketing pitch up and running.
What is the toughest job problem you’ve ever faced?
ShowStoppers
 Recall a problem, the skills used in your action to deal with it, and the
successful results; this is a skills-detailed version of PAR (problem,
action, result).
 Explain how you could apply those same skills to the prospective job.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Recall a problem but not an accomplishment or skill related to it.
 Say you’ve searched your memory and can’t recall a problem you couldn’t
handle.
What do you like least about gathering information to deal with a problem

 Comment that wanting to do a first-rate job, you’re uncomfortable when
you’re uncertain that you’ve compiled enough research to quit and make
a decision that affects the well-being of others.
 Reveal that you enjoy solving problems but become impatient with
repetitive sameo-sameo answers leading to dead ends.
 Explain that you use multiple resources — Web, books, journals, and
expert people — and you become frustrated when key resources 
aren’t adequate.

Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say that you never do them because you’re terrified of speaking in front
of large crowds.
 Admit you were roundly booed at your last political protest speech.
How would you rate your writing skills in comparison to your verbal skills?
ShowStoppers
 Discuss how both skills — as well as listening — are important to being
a good communicator, and that while one or the other may be your strong
suit, you’re working to become strongly proficient at both speaking and
writing. Explain how you’re doing so — class work, independent study,
membership in Toastmasters International or a writing group; show brief
writing samples.
 Concretely explain a real communication situation in your past; describe
how you communicated the information and the result.
 If you’re a weak communicator, give a compensatory response that sub-
stitutes another skill for writing or verbal skills; for example, in a techni-
cal call center, problem-solving outweighs the need for golden tonsils
and laudable business writing.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Rate your skill in one area as better than the other and clam up.
 Say public speaking gives you sweaty palms and you don’t like it.

How do you deal with unexpected events on the job?
ShowStoppers
 Discuss how you immediately reprioritize your assignments in 
emergencies.
 Mention specific instances where you were able to complete a project
(or projects) on time despite unforeseen complications.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Tell how you just keep doing what you were doing until you’re finished.
 Discuss an instance when an unexpected event resulted in disaster.
How do you organize your time?
ShowStoppers
 Affirm that you put first things first. Each day you identify A-level tasks
and get those done before moving on to B-level tasks. You return voice-
mail messages once or twice daily and urgent messages immediately.
 Comment that you use up-to-date planning products. These include plan-
ning software such as PlanPlusOnline, and PDA (personal digital assis-
tant) hand-held devices, such as a BlackBerry. These kinds of mentions
show that you are techno-current. If you organize yourself on paper,
mention a formal business product such as a Franklin Planner. (Pulling
out a pocket calendar is like pulling out a slide rule.) Conclude with true
examples showing that you completed multiple tasks on time.
 Discuss how you went through a typical day on one of your previous
jobs.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say that you don’t usually handle more than one task at a time.
 Reply that you don’t wear a watch.
How do you delegate responsibility?

 Mention your belief that a task will be done right only if you do it 
yourself.
What’s your experience with group projects (teamwork)?
ShowStoppers
 Mention a specific project, including the group goals and your particular

 Summarize point-by-point why your qualifications match the employer’s
needs to a tee, adding any additional competitive edge you can honestly
claim. (Rehearse in advance to avoid stumbles.)
 Include accomplishments and the skills that facilitated those accom-
plishments, plus relevant experience and training.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Fail to make the “perfect match” connection.
 Offer only clichés, such as “I’m honest, hardworking, and a fast learner”
without factual backup illustrations.

Chapter 21
How Does Your Experience 
Help Us?
In This Chapter
 Recognizing questions that target experience
 Focusing your answers on an employer’s needs
 Sample questions for practice
I
n the classic adventure film Raiders of the Lost Ark, Karen Allen (playing
Marion Ravenwood) hasn’t seen Harrison Ford (playing Indiana Jones) for
awhile when she comments that he’s not the same man she knew ten years
ago. Ford’s Indiana Jones has a great comeback: 
It’s not the years, honey, it’s the mileage.
And so it goes with experience. You can have ten years of skill-building 
experience — or you can have one year’s experience with nine years of
reruns. Solid experience is yet one more confirmation of your ability to 
do a job.
Make Your Experience Relevant
Psychologists insist that past behavior predicts future behavior. True or not,
interviewers look at your yesterdays for clues on how well you’ll perform
tomorrow.
Simply reciting your experience isn’t going to wow an employer. You have to
make the connection between then and now. You have to show exactly how
your experience-based accomplishments make you the perfect candidate for
the job opening. Here’s a straightforward example:

As you’ll note on my resume, I’ve had five years of praised experience as an
instructor and training coordinator. I’d like to tell you a few details about my
work as an office-work trainer for military spouses, which has a direct appli-
cation to your project to retrain a portion of the company’s plant workers.
Would you like to hear a bit about that? 
Whether you have a lot or a little experience, employers want to hire people
who will continue to learn and grow to the benefit of their company. So as you
answer the experience questions, focus not only on your experience, but also
on how your efforts served the changing needs of your previous employer.
I started training the military wives on word processing programs from 9 am
until 12 noon, three days a week. After several months I was asked to add
evening hours two nights a week to train a class on spreadsheet programs,
which I myself had to quickly get up to steam on — and was glad to do so.
When you can show how you’ve successfully adapted in the past, convincing
employers that you have what it takes to adapt your experience to their
workplaces is easier.
After the interviewing Q & A begins, what should you do if you don’t under-
stand one of the questions? Don’t be afraid to ask for clarification — I’m not
sure I understand your question, and I don’t want to give you an irrelevant or
incorrect answer.
The Questions
Questions that you may be asked about your work experience, along with
suggested answering techniques (ShowStoppers) and definite mistakes
(Clunkers and Bloopers) include the following:
What kind of experience do you have for this job?
ShowStoppers
 Gather information before answering. Ask what projects you would be
working on in the first six months. Relate your experience to those pro-
jects, detailing exactly how you would go about working on them.
 Give specific examples of your success in dealing with similar projects in
the past, focusing on results.
 Show how transferable skills drawn from even seemingly unrelated expe-
rience (waiting tables or planning club functions) apply to this project.
You learned the value of being reliable, of coordinating efforts, of organi-
zation, and so forth.
244
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say you have no experience. Next question!
 Show that your experience overreaches this particular job — unless you
know your overqualification is a plus or your real agenda is to angle for
a higher-level position.
In what ways has your job status changed since you got into this field?
ShowStoppers
 Mention that you’ve worked in X number of positions — from small to
larger employers — with increasing responsibility; this position is a 
logical next level in your upward track record.
 Describe how you’ve continued your education and training to be sure
you’re moving forward with the technology and the times. 
 With brief, broad verbal brush strokes, sketch advances in your line 
of work over the years. The point is to show that you recognize epic
change.
 Ask whether you failed to cover any key responsibilities. If there’s a gap,
show how you’ve handled missing responsibilities, perhaps in earlier
positions.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Leave out important functions in your move upward. You’ll look like you
may need to catch up.
 Confirm that you’ve held the same job for 10 years with little change.
245
Chapter 21: How Does Your Experience Help Us?
When you’re technically great but quiet and shy
Some people, including those who have techni-
cal talents, are sometimes very shy at inter-
views, appearing introverted and timid. Is that
you?
Here’s a trick around that problem from Martin
Yate, author of Knock ‘em Dead: The Ultimate
Job Seeker’s Guide (Adams Media Corporation,
2005) and other best-selling job search books.
Yate says that if you reach across the desk to
hand the interviewer papers, graphs, and
reports from your portfolio of work samples, the
interviewer will ask you questions about the
samples. Your answers will keep the flow of
conversation going — and you’ll answer the
questions and won’t come across as, well,
bashful.

How long would it take you to make a contribution to our company?
ShowStoppers
 Ask the interviewer to explain which areas need the greatest contribution,
perhaps focusing on a specific project.
 Estimate how long it would realistically take you to get settled and get
working. Then detail how you would go about working on the particular
project, showing how much time you estimate that each step would
take. Be realistic, yet optimistic, in your time estimation.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say you’ll make a contribution the very first day, unless you can support
that claim with facts.
 Estimate that you won’t become productive for at least four months
(unless you’re headed for an incredibly complex job in which a settling-
in period lasting beyond three months is normal).
What are your qualifications?
ShowStoppers
 Connect your close fit between the job’s requirements and your 
qualifications.
 Ask whether you should first focus on academic and training or job-
related qualifications.
 Ask what specific projects or problems you may be expected to deal
with and which have the highest priority.
 Identify the projects you’ve accomplished in the past that qualify you to
work successfully on the projects the interviewer mentioned.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Assume you know what the interviewer wants to hear about, plunge in,
and fail to check the interviewer’s interest after a minute or so.
 Speak only of your education when you have the wrong or limited work
experience without working in nuggets of experience in your school lab
work, volunteer work, or student jobs.
How did you resolve a tense situation with a coworker? Have you ever had
to fire someone?
246
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

ShowStoppers
 Discuss your analytical process for solving any problem involving
coworkers (as advocated in conflict-resolution guides).
 Give a specific example of a difficulty that you’ve dealt with (conflict res-
olution or discipline), focusing on how you used your analytical skills to
effectively solve the problem.
 Illustrate how you go about collecting information, stating the steps you
took to help the fired person improve and save his or her job before
making a termination decision.
 Emphasize that you follow company policy and that you’re fair and tact-
ful in dealing with employee problems.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Explain that colleagues unfairly ganged up on you.
 Discuss an example where you fired someone because you just didn’t
like the person.
 Focus on how horrible the problem or employee was, naming names.
Give a specific example of a time that you had to put your needs aside to
help a coworker (teamwork).
ShowStoppers
 Mention teamwork and the importance of coworkers being able to rely
on each other.
 Give a specific example, showing that the reliance wasn’t one-sided.
 Show either how your efforts contributed to getting the work done or
how the help you gave didn’t cause problems with your own work.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Comment that it happens all the time and leave it at that.
 Say you can’t recall any examples.
What did you like best at your last job?
ShowStoppers
 Mention specific work experiences you were good at and enjoyed that
are likely to be present in the prospective position (leading the inter-
viewer to see a match from past to future).
247
Chapter 21: How Does Your Experience Help Us?

 Speak about opportunities to plan your own day or think out of the box.
(If you’ve made a hit, the interviewer may encouragingly say you’ll find
similar opportunities in this position.)
 Confirm that you enjoyed the accomplishment opportunities, that you
liked being visible in a high-stakes effort, knowing that your contribu-
tions directly affected the company’s bottom line.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Blast your ex-job as a loser and say that’s why you’re here. (Unless your
previous employment was at Enron or your former boss is doing hard
time.)
 Explain that nothing stood out as being especially rewarding.
Based on your experience, what problems do team-focused companies face?
ShowStoppers
 Document, with storytelling, that your experience includes being a suc-
cessful leader or member of teams.
 Discuss teams as an overall positive factor in the work world of the 21st
century.
 Discuss a minor negative aspect of teams and show how that negative
aspect can be overcome. (Magazine articles and books about teamwork
are helpful for developing teamwork language skills.)
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say that you’ve always preferred to work alone or to let the people who
report to you handle the grunts down the line.
 Explain why teamwork is overrated in business today.
Describe a time that you had to work without direct supervision. Have you
ever had to make department decisions when your supervisor was not
available?
ShowStoppers
 Discuss your decision-making process. You don’t rattle easily.
 Show that you’re self-directed and self-motivated, but still willing to
follow others’ directions or to ask for assistance when needed.
 Storytell: Discuss a specific example of a time you had to make a decision
without supervision. Preferably, discuss a time that you anticipated
company needs and finished a project ahead of time or made a beneficial
decision.

 Briefly discuss a specific — but minor — example.
 Briefly discuss what the mistake taught you and how it led you to improve
your system for making decisions or solving problems.
 After talking about your example and what you learned from it, refocus
the discussion on your accomplishments.

 Discuss an example of being challenged where you listened politely 
but supported your decision with research or analytical data and you
prevailed.
 Add that even though you supported your decision, you were open to
suggestions or comments. You’re confident in your abilities but not
closed-minded or foolishly stubborn.

 Explain why the three accomplishments are your top picks, adding that
you can expand the list. Reach across the desk to hand over an index
card with your name and as many as 10 accomplishments.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Laughingly remark that you have so many accomplishments that it’s
hard to choose just three.
 Admit that you’re not sure what counts as an accomplishment.
Your experience doesn’t exactly match our needs right now, does it?
ShowStoppers
 Don’t agree. Instead, say that you see your fit with the job through a
rosier lens. Your skills are cross-functional. Speak the language of trans-
ferable skills and focus on how you can easily transfer your experience
in other areas to learning this new job.
 Stress that you’re dedicated to learning the new job quickly. Give two
true examples of how you learned a job skill much faster than usual.
 Say you don’t have any bad habits to unlearn and discuss your good
work habits that will help you get the job done efficiently and well.

Chapter 22
What Education Do You Have?
In This Chapter
 Applying education skills to your job interview
 Focusing boomers on adaptability and updated education
 Focusing recent college graduates on educational experience
I
nterviewers glean more from your answers about education and training
than just the facts. What you say reveals your decision-making processes,
your values, your ability to keep up with the times, and your willingness to
adapt to a technology-driven global economy.
In addition to dealing with touchy issues that job seekers of any age or expe-
rience level may encounter — like not having a degree or other educational
credential — this chapter homes in on inquiries often directed at two specific
groups:
 Boomers, a young-at-heart generation toting around a few extra years of
experience. (See Chapter 17 for interviewing tips for people over 50.)
 Millennials (those born after 1980), fresh faces on the work scene and
typically recent college gradates. (See Chapter 15 for interviewing tips
for new college graduates.)
When You Are Degree-less
What can you do when all the jobs you want seem to require a college degree
and you don’t have one? Or you have an undergraduate degree and the job
requires a graduate degree? Or you have the “wrong” degree?
Your moves depend upon whether you want to make a play for the degree-
requiring job without additional education or make a commitment to higher
learning.

Talking around an education obstacle
If you must address your lack of required education, discuss your experience
and skills as education. Speak of experience-based knowledge and skills, for
instance, and redirect the conversation to your self-teaching efforts. Assure the
interviewer that your degree-less state does not affect your ability to do 
the job well. Use specific examples from your experience to prove this point.
Using experience as education won’t change anyone’s mind when the educa-
tion requirement is rigid — as it is in health fields, for example. But it may
keep your candidacy afloat when an educational requirement is simply a 
convenient screening device.
You have at your disposal three more strategies that don’t require returning
to school:
 Persevere: Continue interviewing at companies too small to operate a
human resource department. HR staffers are paid to exclude applicants
who miss job criteria, including education.
 Work short-term: Seek staffing firms that will send you on temporary or
contract assignments so that employers can see how good you are and
offer you a regular-status job.
 Network: Try an online career network, such as LinkedIn.com to find a
contact within your target company who will see that you’re interviewed
by a hiring manager. The hiring manager is advised that you are so tal-
ented that your experience is more than equivalent to a degree.
For talented liars, warnings against telling big, fat lies fall on deaf ears. But
rarely a month passes without headlines revealing that yet another liar has
been busted. As I write this, stories are in every newspaper about an often-
quoted dean of admissions for a top East Coast university who was canned
for claiming imaginary degrees from three institutions of higher education.
Although her lies didn’t catch up with her for 28 years, the time period of dis-
covery may shrink dramatically as Google and other search engines make
headway on providing Internet surfers easy access to reams of public 
records — including education.
Heading back to school
If you enroll in a formal degree program, be sure to mention this fact when
explaining that you don’t have a sheepskin now but are hot on the trail of
a degree.
252
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

My experience in the point-of-sale industry more than compensates for my
present lack of a marketing degree. (Cite several examples showing you
know what you’re talking about.) However, I can see that a degree is impor-
tant to you, and I want to mention that I’m enrolled in a degree program
now, with expected graduation in 20XX. So you have the best of both worlds
with me — heavy-duty experience, plus current academic knowledge.
But if smoothing out the scratches on your blackboard with a heavy schedule
of classes at a four-year campus while pounding away at your day job is more
than you can tackle right now, consider these options:
 Kick off your educational comeback in slow motion. Begin with one class
in a modestly-priced community college course.
 Enroll in distance education degree programs. Costs vary considerably,
from such private institutions as the University of Phoenix on the high
end, to such public institutions as New Jersey’s Thomas Edison State
College on the low end. Look online at www.geteducated.com and
www.petersons.com/distancelearning.
 Take advantage of a new kind of free online “auditing” opportunity
offered by some of the nation’s finest colleges and universities.
The trend started with Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Open-
CourseWare in 2003; by the end of 2007, MIT hopes to publish materials
from virtually all of its 1,800 courses.
Joining the list of name colleges and universities offering free course
materials online are Yale, Notre Dame, Bryn Mawr, University of
California, Berkeley, and Stanford. Specifics vary by school but institu-
tions are posting everything from lecture notes and sample tests to
actual audio and video.
 Sign up for lectures. These are not degree-granting programs, but if you
enroll in one for the joy of learning, you can mention in a job interview
that you are “enrolled at MIT, 2007, Physics II.”
You’re probably besieged with Internet spam advertising “overnight” delivery
of impressive college degrees: Get a Harvard law degree tomorrow, only $29.95.
Don’t fall for such nonsense. Degree-mill documents are suitable for shredding.
In a new age of instant Internet sleuthing, truth will out.
Boomers: High on Adaptability
Interviewers concentrate on your work experience, but you should still expect
them to ask about your education or training. They want to know whether
you’re rusted out or ready to keep up with your industry by making the effort
to learn new skills.
253
Chapter 22: What Education Do You Have?

Education and training come in many forms. In addition to colleges and uni-
versities, vocational-technical institutions, private career schools, and mili-
tary schools, discuss other learning resources such as the following:
 Company training programs you’ve participated in and what you learned
in those training programs.
 Trade or professional journals that you read regularly, in print or online.
 Professional conferences, seminars, and workshops that you’ve
attended recently (or plan to attend soon), especially those offering
CEUs (continuing education credits).
 Teleseminars and Webinars through which you find new information.
 Computer training that you’ve had, are taking, or expect to take; when
appropriate, use computer jargon during your interviews.
However you address employers’ questions about education and training,
communicate that although you’re focused, you’re flexible about the way you
get the work done. You don’t expect to do a job the same way tomorrow that
you did yesterday. You’ve continued to learn new trends and developments in
your field throughout your career — and certainly you’re always willing to
learn more.
The Questions
What do you do to keep up to date in your job? How do you improve your-
self professionally?
ShowStoppers
 Describe your participation in professional associations, seminars,
meetings and activities, and Internet professional discussion groups.
 Say you study professional magazines and online professional sites, look
for technical breakthroughs, and seek certifications that document your
continued skill-building (describe certifications).
 Discuss classes and programs in which you’re enrolled.

 Comment that when matched with solid experience, the degrees are
excellent.
 Remark that degrees are essential but you must continue to learn
throughout your life.
 If you have no degree, assert that human traits and skills are as impor-
tant as education and that your record shows you have the background
to succeed in this position.
 Reply that you’ll let your work achievements and interpersonal skills
speak for you.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Knock the value of formal education. Say it’s overrated.
 Observe that you’ve been too busy at home raising a family to stay 
current with all the things changing in the world today.
I see you’ve been attending a training program online. Do you believe 
distance education is as beneficial as sitting in a classroom?
ShowStoppers
 Say yes. Defend your education. Be positive, responding that what you
know is the important issue — not where you learned it.
 Identify the institution’s accreditation. Say that your study was designed
by the best minds in the field. Mention any honors accorded your online
program.
 Be confident, noting that some educators think online students are more
committed than campus students — that their motivation is stronger.
Say that from personal perseverance, you agree.
 Add that the experience immensely improved your computer skills.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Apologize, lamenting that distance education was the only way you
could manage to work and learn.
 Explain that your only online class was really for life enrichment, not for
work.
255
Chapter 22: What Education Do You Have?

Millennials: High on Education, 
Low on Experience
Education is magnificent, but you can’t count on education.
You have to look focused. You have to look passionate about what you want
to do. You have to show how your education has prepared you for the job
you target.
Whenever possible, present your education as work experience. If that seems
like a reach, think of it this way:
 You have experience working with deadlines and with applying skills that
you’ve learned throughout the years as you completed various projects.
 You’ve probably given at least one presentation, so you’ve had experi-
ence preparing it, and you have experience communicating to a group 
of people.
 To get through school without killing yourself, you probably had to
develop some type of time schedule, so you have valuable experience 
in time management — organizing your time for greatest efficiency.
Don’t neglect any of these important experiences.

that can contribute to your success.
 Remark how your GPA gradually rose as you learned better study habits
and say that you wish you had learned them sooner.
 Answer the question and quickly redirect the discussion to your skills
and how you can apply those skills to the job.
 Give specific examples of your success in job-related pursuits, outside of
your GPA.
If you have an impressive GPA
 Emphasize that your education extends beyond the classroom. Discuss
extracurricular activities and what you learned from them that you can
apply to the job.
 Explain the factors that are common between a high GPA and success on
the job, such as organizing, prioritizing, and commitment to goals.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Say you don’t know why you got a low GPA.
 Confess any weaknesses, unless you can show how you have overcome
them.
 Offer transparent alibis for poor grades.
 Assert that grades aren’t important or be defensively arrogant.
What extracurricular activities did you participate in? What leadership
positions did you hold?
ShowStoppers
 Emphasize goal-oriented activities or groups over “fun” ones. About
sororities and fraternities — carefully mention only leadership and
doing good works, not the social aspect; otherwise, nonmembers may
think “party animal” and write you off.
 Discuss all leadership roles, teamwork, and self-motivation; explain how
those experiences will help you in the job.
 Discuss skills you learned from the activities or groups and how those
skills apply to the job.
 Explain that you had to work so many hours that being active in campus
groups would have left you with too little time for your course work.

 Mention all elected offices you held.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Mention only good-time social activities without articulating leadership
or teamwork experiences drawn from them.
 Dwell on membership in political or religious groups (unless you know
you are talking to a kindred soul who shares your beliefs).
If you could do it over again, would you change your university/major?
What didn’t you like about school?
ShowStoppers
 Say you made the right choice and discuss why.
 Discuss education as more than just courses and college life; it’s a broad
base for learning and a training ground for meeting challenges.
 You liked everything about your school — except maybe the high cost of
tuition. You have student loan money to pay back and look forward to
working hard at a job to do so.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Be negative about the school or faculty.
 Admit that you made a poor decision.
In what areas could your education have better prepared you for your
career?
ShowStoppers
 Your academic studies did not include the quality of hands-on experi-

prepared you for this job.
 Explain how you made up for lack of experience with student jobs, co-op
education, internships, or unpaid work with campus organizations or
nonprofit organizations.

Situation?

T
he job of the interviewer is two-fold:
 To find the best match at the best price between the position’s require-
ments and your qualifications
 To ferret out disqualifications about you — which can range from a mild
to serious stumbling block in the interviewer’s perception — even though
you’re not anxious to talk about a particular topic
Perhaps you’ve been in the same job too long, making you appear to be
unmotivated. Maybe you have employment gaps or too many jobs hanging
around your neck.
Conceivably you’re battling bias against a disability or sexual orientation.
Could be that you’re a woman who knows an underlying concern may be
parental absenteeism — or whether you can supervise men. Or suppose
you’re in alcohol or drug recovery and crashing into brick walls.
Sometimes you’re pretty sure that you’re running into rejection because you
were fired for cause or demoted. You’re very sure that you don’t know what
to say because you’ve been convicted of a crime. 

Think carefully before discussing special issues. Even a question that seems
innocent may cause you to reveal things you didn’t mean to tell. For non-sen-
sitive questions, asking for more time to think about your answer is okay. But
for special issue answers, you seem more straightforward and sure of your-
self when you anticipate the question and are ready with a good answer.
This chapter provides comments and response strategies to help shape your
special issue.
When You’ve Long Been in the Same Job
What could be considered stability by some is increasingly seen as fossiliza-
tion by others. Your chief strategy is to look industrious, ready to take on any
challenge that comes your way, and adaptable to new ideas.
Because you’ve been with your last employer for so long, do you think you
may have a hard time adjusting to a new company’s way of working?
ShowStoppers
 Not at all. Give examples of how you’ve already learned to be adaptable —
how your previous job was dynamic, provided a constantly changing
environment, and shared common links with the new company. Note
parallels of budget, business philosophy, and work ethics. You plan to
take up mountain climbing and sky diving when you’re 80 — figuratively
speaking.
 Emphasize your commitment to your previous company as one of many
assets you bring with you to the new position — and then name more of
your assets.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Discuss your relief at escaping that old awful job — at last!
 Say you’re ready to try something new.
You’ve been in your previous position an unusually long period of time —
why haven’t you been promoted?
ShowStoppers
 Present the old job in modules (by clusters of skills you developed
instead of by your periods of employment). Concentrate on all increases
in responsibility (to show upward mobility within the position) and on
relevant accomplishments. Note raises.
264
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

 Say that you’re interested in this new job precisely because of the inertia
of your previous position. Mention any lifestyle changes (grown kids,
second family income) freeing you to make a vigorous move at this time.
 Agree that your career hasn’t progressed much, but note that many tal-
ented people are forced to root or to accept lateral moves because few
upwardly mobile job slots are available. Say your career plateau gave
you time to reflect, lighting a fire under your motivation.
 Explain that you had reached the highest position the company offered
individuals in your specialty.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Complain about office politics keeping you down.
 Say you were happy where you were and ask, “Why fix what isn’t broken?”
When You’ve Served Prison Time
The key to dealing with prison time is to make the experience as positive as
possible. Work double-time to outshine the other candidates with your posi-
tive outlook and qualifications for the job.
Here are several tips you may find useful:
 Find the best collection of resources that address the criminal record
employment dilemma on the following Web site: www.exoffender
reentry.com. The resources include books, DVDs, free articles and
more. An especially helpful book is Ex-Offender’s Job Hunting Guide: 10
Steps to a New Life in the Work World, by Ron and Caryl Krannich, PhDs
(Impact Publications, 2005). Inmates without access to the Internet will
have to rely on family and friends to obtain these resources.
 Don’t count on expungement — the court sealing of criminal records —
to keep employers from knowing that you’ve served time in prison.
Expungement is no longer a reliable strategy for ex-offender job seekers
because in this digital era, commercial databases are slow to update what
courts have forgiven; expunged records now often turn up in criminal
background checks ordered by employers.
 Job seekers with prison records should be aware of the Federal Bonding
Program (www.bonds4jobs.com). It basically provides insurance guar-
anteeing worker honesty — an incentive to employers to hire an at-risk
applicant.
 The Work Opportunity Tax Credit is a tax break for employers who hire
certain workers, including ex-offenders. Learn more at this Web site:
www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax.

Chapter 23: What about Your Special Situation?

 The U.S. Military accepts enrollments from those who have served time
for misdemeanors and felonies. The pathway to enlist begins with apply-
ing for a moral waiver. The moral waiver process varies with each military
service. Ask military recruiters for more information.
Tell me about your incarceration.
ShowStoppers
 Describe how it was one of the best learning experiences you’ve ever had.
Explain the crossover (transferable) skills and education you acquired in
prison.
 Say that it helped you make changes in your life so that the behavior that
got you in trouble is history. Part of your old problem was hanging out
with the wrong people. In your new life you hang out with a different
group of people who do not get into trouble.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Lie about your conviction, figuring no one will learn about it until after
you’ve been hired. (Why risk a firing on top of your criminal record?)
 Say you’re a victim of bad police work and never should have been in
prison (unless technology has cleared you of all charges).
When You’re Shoved out the Door
The number-one rule in explaining why you were fired is to keep it brief, keep
it honest, and keep it moving. Say what you need to say and redirect the con-
versation to your qualifications. As for what you should say, you have two
core options.
Were you fired from your last job?
ShowStoppers
 If it wasn’t your fault:
Explain the firing as a result of downsizing, mergers, company closure,
or some other act beyond your control. Sometimes firing happens sev-
eral times in a row to good people who figuratively happen to be stand-
ing on the wrong street corner when the wrong bus comes along. So
many people have been on that bus these days that being terminated is
no longer a big deal. Being let go wasn’t your fault, so you have no
reason to feel guilty. Go on with the interview.
266
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

 If it was your fault:
Say you learned an enormous lesson during the experience. You messed
up, but you know better now, and you won’t make the same mistakes
again. Explain briefly how you benefited from this learning experience.
Then quickly turn the interview back to the better you and go on to
explain how you’re the best candidate for the job.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Give interviewers the impression that you’re hiding something, that
you’re not being absolutely honest and open with them.
 Bad-mouth your former boss. Say your former coworkers were a freak
show.
 Tell the interviewer that you’ve had personality conflicts on more than
one job. That admission sets off blaring smoke detectors warning that
you’re a fiery troublemaker.
Have you ever been asked to resign? Why?
ShowStoppers
 Being allowed to resign (a gentler process than being fired for cause)
suggests that you may be able to work out a mutually agreeable ratio-
nale with your former employer. Do so and stick to that rationale.
 When you have no rationale, admit your mistake and say it was a painful
lesson that caused a change in your work habits.
267
Chapter 23: What about Your Special Situation?
Sidelining a series of firings
If you’ve been fired from a significant number of
jobs, few employers will be willing to give you a
second chance; understandably, they don’t
want to deal with the same problems your pre-
vious employers did.
The best course for you to take in this situation
is to call on a third party’s help. Appeal to your
family and friends to step in and recommend
you to people they know personally who can
hire you. Make sure that the people with hiring
power are aware of your past mistakes and
assure them (honestly) that you’ve learned from
the experiences and have reformed your
wicked ways.
Your other most likely options are to obtain addi-
tional education or training for a fresh start or
consider self-employment.

Clunkers and Bloopers
 Lie or give excuses to justify why you shouldn’t have been treated so
unfairly.
 Rip on your ex-bosses or coworkers for forcing you out.
 Give multiple examples of your interpersonal conflicts.
When Sexual Orientation 
Is up for Discussion
“A record number of U.S. companies are competing to expand benefits and
protections for their gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) employ-
ees . . .” says a 2006 Human Rights Campaign Foundation (www.hrc.org)
report.
In a statement the following year, HRC measured the progress of workplace
fairness finding that nine out of ten Fortune 500 (the largest U.S.-based corpo-
rations) included gender identity in their non-discrimination policies in 2007.
That’s ten times as many as were doing so in 2001.
Observers of GLBT employment trends believe that many mid-sized compa-
nies also have established formal non-discrimination policies concerning
sexual minorities. Arguably, as Monster.com writer Dan Woog put it: “The
workplace has come a long way from the days when homosexuality was the
elephant in the cubicle.”
My research suggests that a generational component is an influential factor in
the spread of fairness in workplace sexual orientation issues. As a generality,
most younger interviewers seem to be flat-out neutral — not affected one
way or the other by a candidate’s sexuality. Some older interviewers, who’ve

lived through changing times, may be affected but lean over backwards
making sure that all questions are job-related. 
But another group of interviewers — of any age— continues to form the “third
rail” of interviewing for you. Because of their belief systems or the culture that
produced them, these interviewers operate with hard-wired predispositions
against sexual minorities, rain or shine.
Even in companies or locales where sexual orientation discrimination is for-
bidden, homophobic interviewers get away with it because that won’t be the
reason they give when you’re turned down (if you ever even hear back). They
find other reasons for your rejection when they have any reason to suspect
your sexual orientation is one they disapprove of.
Don’t be lulled into complacent mistakes because of the rapid acceleration
during the past decade of sexual orientation as a protected class by both
company declarations and government (state and local) laws. Discrimination
is alive and well.
When you suspect that for a screening interview you’ve been paired with a
closet homophobic whom you’ll never see again, don’t worry too much
because that individual could be an anomaly; if the interviewer is the hiring
manager to whom you’d report, worry.
As you evaluate how to move forward in your job search, note that a growing
number of job seekers with same-sex orientation reject out of hand the
notion of working for companies where they can’t be open about their sexual
orientation. They say the effort to hide sexual orientation takes a toll on their
productivity, as well as their emotional and physical health.
But sometimes the need for employment takes over. When you can’t find a
workplace where your sexual orientation won’t be used against you, and you
have rent to pay, you may choose not to disclose.
Here are a few suggestions to smooth your interviewing experience:
 If you choose to disclose, wait until the interviewer either shows enor-
mous interest in your qualifications and you know an offer is eminent, 
or until the offer is actually made. Some savvy advisers recommend 
that you wait until you have a written offer letter in hand.
 Thoroughly research the company’s culture and civil rights policies
before the interview. Look for companies that proclaim a nondiscrimina-
tory policy on sexual orientation. Look for a company that offers a
domestic partner benefits plan to life partners.
269
Chapter 23: What about Your Special Situation?

 How can you tell whether fairness happy talk is real or window dressing?
Ask members of GLBT support networks what they know about a com-
pany where you plan to interview. And look at GLBT Web sites and job
boards for lists of friendly employers and detailed job hunting advice.
Key resources include the following:
• Human Rights Campaign (www.hrc.org)
• Gay Financial Network (www.gfn.com)
• Progayjobs.com (www.progayjobs.com)
• GayJob.biz (www.gayjob.biz)
• Diversity Working (www.diversityworking.com)
• Monster.com (career-advice.monster.com/gay-lesbian-
bisexual-transgender/home.aspx) and in Canada (diver
sity.monster.ca)
Although you won’t be asked directly about your sexual orientation, an inter-
viewer may — inadvertently or purposely — nibble around the edges with
inappropriate personal questions.
ShowStoppers
Is there a special woman in your life? How’s your marriage?
 A nondisclosure answer: You consider a number of women special in your
life (meaning your mother, your sister, and your aunt), or just say 
you’re not married yet.
 A confirming but neutral answer: Say you’re gay and in a stable relation-
ship. Your sexual orientation bears no relationship to your work. It’s not
a problem for you and you hope it isn’t a problem for the company.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Bluntly refuse to discuss your personal life.
 Ask whether the interviewer is married.
I see you that when you were a college student, you were president for a
year of the Fairness Group — can you tell me about that?
ShowStoppers
 Note that the Fairness Group is a campus anti-discrimination organization.
It has 75 members. As president for two years, you were the group’s repre-
sentative in student government and participated in official greeting
events with visiting dignitaries. All your duties weren’t so visible — you
also led planning for fundraising activities, balanced the checkbook and
helped clean up after events.

 State that the Fairness Group is an organization purposed to be fair to all
students in all ways.
When You’ve Worked Everywhere
In an era of contract workers and just-in-time temporary hirings and tossing
employees overboard to boost already healthy profits for stockholders, I’m
always surprised to hear employers object to “job hopping.” I shouldn’t be.
Employers favor candidates with a track record of staying a “reasonable”
amount of time at previous jobs. They assume the past predicts the future
and so the candidate will stay as long as they’re wanted at their company.
The kicker is the meaning of “reasonable amount of time.” The current group-
think narrative places a minimum stay in a job at two to three years. This
arbitrary time frame does not mean that you shouldn’t cut your losses and
leave if you’re in a bad job — circumstances vary widely. It does mean you
need to give plenty of thought to how you handle a job-hopper question and
deal with it in a logical, convincing, and upbeat answer.
You’ve changed jobs more frequently than is usual — why is that?
ShowStoppers
 List accomplishments on each job that relate to the position you seek.
Note that you built new skills in each job. Say that you’re a person who
contributes value wherever you go.
 Give acceptable, verifiable reasons why you changed jobs so frequently —
project-oriented work, downsizing, dead-end positions, company sold
out, or the department shut down.
 Say that you’ve become more selective lately, and you hadn’t been able
to find the right job until this opportunity came along; explain your
employment travels as a quest for a fulfilling job.
 If this move is a career change for you, show how your experience and
skills support this change and how the position fits your revised career
goals.
271
Chapter 23: What about Your Special Situation?

 If your positions were for temporary agencies, cluster them by responsi-
bility and recast them as evidence of your use of cross-functional skills
in many situations.
 Ask whether this is regular-status employment. If so, admit you’ve lacked
some commitment in the past, but now you’re ready to settle down with
a good company such as this one. If not, say a temporary job is just what
you have in mind to keep your skills refreshed with experiences gained at
various companies.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Complain about what was wrong with each of your ex-employers that
made you quit. Say you didn’t want to waste your time working for 
dysfunctional people and organizations.
 Show a lack of focus — you just couldn’t get into your jobs.
 Say you’re looking for something that pays more.
When Gaps Shred Your History
Employers may rush to judgment when gaps are found in your job history.
If your job history has as many gaps as a hockey player’s teeth, try to find
growth experiences (self-directed study or broadening travel). If you must
blame your jobless patches on sick leave, emphasize that you have recovered
and are in excellent health. If personal problems take the hit (ill parent or
sick child), again follow up with facts that indicate the personal problems 
are history.
When your record is spotty beyond belief, try to get on with a temporary job
and then prove by your work record that you’ve turned over a new leaf.
Sometimes the gaps in your record are of recent vintage — you’ve been look-
ing for employment without success for a very long time. In current periods
of unemployment, your posture is commitment — you throw yourself heart
and soul into your work and you want to be very sure to find a good fit.
Explain your waiting period as a quest for a fulfilling job.
How long have you been job hunting? Wow! That’s a long time — what’s
the problem? Why haven’t you had any job offers yet?

 Say you’ve become more selective lately, and you hadn’t been able to
find the right job until this opportunity came along.

When You’re Demoted a Notch
Oddly, demotion carries more negative weight than does firing today. Demotion
suggests personal failure; firing doesn’t, unless you’re fired for cause.
Do I read this resume right — were you demoted?
ShowStoppers
 Your best move is to deal with demotions before you reach the interview.
Ask your demoting boss for a positive reference (see my book, Resumes
For Dummies, 5th Edition) and come to an agreement about what hap-
pened that’s favorable to you — assuming your boss knows you’re look-
ing around and doesn’t mind helping you leave.
 Explain honestly and as positively as possible the reasons for your send-
down.
 Admit that you weren’t ready for the responsibility at that time, but now
you are. Describe the actions you have taken to grow professionally —
school courses in deficient areas, management seminars, management
books, and introspection.

Chapter 23: What about Your Special Situation?

 Affirm that you’re looking for a good place to put your new and improved
management skills to use, and you hope that place is where you are
interviewing. Quickly remind interviewers that you’re qualified for the
job you’re interviewing for, and back that up with examples of your skills
and quantified achievements.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Lie or try to shift the blame to ABY (anybody but you).
 Accuse management of unreasonable expectations.
When People in Recovery Interview
Networking is the way many people in substance recovery get job interviews,
with the result that the referring party often has revealed your background to
the interviewer.
When you’re sure that the interviewer is well aware of your substance history,
find a way to introduce the topic on your terms: I am a better-than-average qual-
ified candidate for this job. As you know, I have fought the substance abuse battle
and won.
Emphasize that you are a tested, proven individual who has survived a cru-
cible, taken control of your life, and grown into a stronger person. Try not to
become mired in interminable details of your recovery, but stick to your main
theme of being a well-qualified applicant who overcame an illness and is now
better equipped to meet new challenges.
As soon as you think you have tapped into the interviewer’s sense of fairness,
redirect the conversation to reasons that you should be hired. But until you
calm the interviewer’s anxiety about your recovery, the interviewer won’t
truly hear anything you say about your strengths and qualifications.

such as drug or alcohol abuse in your background. Read Job Interview Tips

When Women Are Put on the Spot
News flash! Young women of child-bearing age battle questions about family
matters.
Research companies for family-friendly policies before you apply. For exam-
ple, women’s magazines regularly run stories identifying the best of national
companies that promote work-life balance. Use your networks and search
local newspaper stories to find similar small and mid-sized companies where
you live.
When you have small fry and you choose to stay home with them but you
still need the pay, contemplate alternatives: working part-time, pairing up
with another person to do the same job (job sharing), taking your work home
(telecommuting), and rearranging work schedules without cutting productive
hours (flextime).

Clunkers and Bloopers
 Give a vague answer on management style revealing your naiveté.
 Out-macho a male interviewer or seem to be too lightweight for the job.
When Disabilities Are up for Disclosure
The Americans with Disabilities Act severely limits what interviewers can ask
people with disabilities prior to offering a job. If you have a visible disability,
you may benefit by giving an explanation of how you’re able to do the job.
Essentially, the ADA permits an interviewer to ask you about your abilities to
perform a job, but not about your disabilities. As an astute employer once
said, “We are not interviewing a disability. We are not hiring a disability. We
are looking to hire a person who can do the job we want done.”
Suppose an interviewer asks: “How is your health?” Just explain that you’re
able to perform tasks that the job requires. (But if you have an obvious dis-
ability, the ADA makes the question illegal at the pre-offer stage.)
For a quick brush-up on your rights in job interviews, scour the federal Labor
Department’s Office of Disability Employment Policy (www.dol.gov/odep;
click on Frequently Asked Questions).
Examples of questions to expect include the following:
You say you can do the job. How would that work? Can you explain more?
ShowStoppers
 When practical, ask to give a demonstration — if practical, bring your
own equipment.
 When a demonstration is impractical, pull an example from your last job
(paid or volunteer) or educational experience. Storytell: Recount a true
tale of your having been there, done that.
 Anticipate essentials to job performance (anything in the job description)
the interviewer may be worried about — such as physical mobility, safety,
and motor coordination. If you have vision or hearing impairment, expect
some concerns that you’ll miss visual or aural cues essential to job perfor-
mance. Explain how you’ve adapted in these areas or will overcome 
obstacles.
 Suggest a few references (previous teachers, counselors, employers, or
coworkers) who can testify to your abilities to do the job.

Chapter 23: What about Your Special Situation?

Clunkers and Bloopers
 Show you’re offended by the question — soapbox about unspoken bias.
 Explain that your coworkers have always set aside their work to assist
you with problematic tasks.
 Without examples to support your claims, assert you have no 
problems with job performance.
Because you’re our first applicant with a disability, we’ve never dealt with
accommodations before. How much are these accommodations going to
cost us?
ShowStoppers
 Promise that your requirements are minimal and give examples of how
your skills will merit the company’s small investment. Get cost estimates
on the Job Accommodation Network (www.jan.wvu.edu).
 Offer to provide some of your own equipment (you aren’t required to do
so, but the offer shows serious interest in contributing to the company).
 Offer information on accommodations, such as telephone numbers for
companies that sell accommodations devices or consultant organiza-
tions specializing in accommodations.
Clunkers and Bloopers
 Name a costly price for all the equipment you could possibly need,
assuming the company can afford the expense.
 Act demanding because you think that the ADA is protecting you — the
interviewer on the lookout for litigious types won’t hire a bad attitude.
 Cite the ADA requirements and threaten to sic your attorney on them. If
you sue, hope you win enough money to not need a job — ever!
(Companies have access to databases of individuals who have sued
other employers, and they resist hiring litigious applicants.)

Chapter 24
How Should You Answer an
Inappropriate Question?
In This Chapter
 Tilting toward amiable answers 
 Defining discriminatory questions
 Recognizing unwise questions
Is that a Spanish name?
What year did you graduate from high school?
Are you a Christian?
A
ll of the above are foolish questions in a job interview. Every human
resource specialist in America knows this. But other interviewers who
don’t deal with employment issues on a regular basis and who are unsophisti-
cated cross the line and ask personal, intrusive, discriminatory questions all
the time.
You find a sample of risky questions in Table 24-1. But, in general, employers
shouldn’t ask about any of the following topics:
 Age
 Birthplace
 Color
 Disability
 Marital/family status
 National origin
 Race
 Religion
 Sex

Should you set off sirens if an interviewer has the audacity to toss you a pos-
sibly discriminatory question that shouldn’t be asked? Should you flame the
transgressor with passive-aggressive answers like the following:
How is my marital status a factor in the selection process for this job?
As you know, under Title VII, basing employment decisions on sex is illegal,
and I feel that this question is discriminatory in nature.
Think twice about verbally punching out an interviewer — especially if job
talk is going well otherwise and you’re thinking that this could be the right
place for you.
The landscape has changed during the past decade, and maybe you should
revise your attitude about the need to stand up for your rights in response 
to every single questionable question — for your own advantage. Consider
these factors:
 People incautiously are posting their inner moments and life events on
social networking and blog Web sites. That’s where recruiters are dis-
covering revelations about family plans, church activities, health issues,
personal disasters, and more. When so much voluntarily announced per-
sonal information is posted online for all eyes, there’s no need for
employers to resort to asking risky questions.
 More ways your past and current situation can be revealed include the
employment background check, of which a credit report may be a part.
From a relatively few employers who did so a dozen years ago, today
most companies conduct employment background checks on potential
employees. The check-ups range from criminal records searches and
civil litigation history to educational background, job history, credit
reports, and Social Security verifications.
The use of employment background checks has skyrocketed because of
three main reasons:
• Post-9/11 security cautions.
• Workplace violence concerns about hiring potentially violent
people.
• Lack of information from references. Background checks serve as
the reference of last resort in a time of tight-lipped employers.
(Employers are stingy with reference information to avoid legal lia-
bility by revealing more about former employees than the
“name/rank/serial number” basics.)
 People who suspect their rights have been trampled aren’t so quick to
pull the legal trigger these days in part because of the growing realiza-
tion that employment discrimination litigation isn’t famous for big
money awards.
280
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions

And employment litigation can drag on and on. Even preliminary action
by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission doesn’t happen
overnight (if ever).
When you sue, your name is likely to end up in a civil litigation database
that future potential employers may see, perhaps causing them to
decide that you’re a troublemaker. Can you spell pariah?
Defining Illegal Questions
Let’s talk terms. An illegal question is one that the interviewer has no legal right
to ask. Most states and large cities have laws restraining employers from
going hog-wild with intrusive questions covering civil rights — age, sex, reli-
gion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and so forth. Asking illegal questions
can get the interviewer (in a company that retains lawyers) in big trouble.
To find out what’s what in your locale, get the facts. You can inquire at your
state or city attorney general’s office. A library may have a list of questions
that shouldn’t be asked, according to state or local laws.
Why Interviewers Ask Inappropriate
Questions
In large companies where interviewers should know better but don’t, inter-
viewers may go on fishing expeditions, hoping that weird, unexpected ques-
tions catch candidates without prepared answers, causing them to make
unintended revelations.
In companies where interviewers do know better, some go ahead and ask
risky questions because they want the information and are willing to gamble
that they won’t be challenged.
An inappropriate question is one the interviewer can legally ask, but probably
shouldn’t. Depending on whether the information is used to discriminate,
inappropriate questions set up employers for lawsuits, a threat their corpo-
rate lawyers constantly warn against. Inappropriate questions range from
civil rights and privacy issues to hard-to-classify bizarre inquiries:
 Is your girlfriend white?
 How would you go about making a pizza?
 If you were at a departmental meeting and a coworker put his hand on your
thigh, what would you do?
281
Chapter 24: How Should You Answer an Inappropriate Question?

Illegal questions are always inappropriate, but inappropriate questions are
not always illegal.
Redirect Inappropriate Questions
If you’re a crusader and fighting injustice is your priority, by all means tell the
interviewer the illegal or inappropriate question is off-base and shame on the
interviewer.
But perhaps another, frankly foxier, approach will work better for you, espe-
cially if you think the interviewer’s questions come from ignorance rather
than bias. Redirect the offensive question. 
Suppose the interviewer asks a question about age:
I see you went to the University of Colorado. My son’s there now. When did
you graduate?
The smooth candidate directly responds to the question, sort of:
I don’t think your son and I know each other. I’m sure he’s a fine young man.
As for me, fortunately, I’ve been out of school long enough to have devel-
oped good judgment. Would you like to know a little about how my good
judgment saved a previous employer $25,000?
282
Part IV: Lights, Camera, Talk! Answering Questions
Club fed’s forbidden questions
Discrimination law is ever-changing and com-
plex. Contrary to popular understanding, no
such thing as a list of questions prohibited 
by federal law exists, except for these two
questions:
1. Have you ever been arrested?
2. How’s your health?
An employer can’t ask about your arrest record
because an arrest isn’t an admission of guilt.
The Americans with Disabilities Act forbids 
pre-employment questions asking about a can-
didate’s health, but asking about an individual’s
ability to perform job-related tasks — Can you
stand for long periods of time? — is okay.
Other than questions about arrests and health,
interviewers can ask any questions they wish
as far as the feds are concerned. (Of course,
they may pay a stiff penalty for bias.) Federal
law merely notes subjects — based on disabil-
ity and civil rights, such as visible and invisible
impairments, race, sex, age, and so on — that
can be the basis for bias complaints and pro-
hibit discriminatory treatment on these grounds.

Another way to redirect is to answer the question you want to answer, not
necessarily the question that’s asked. (Politicians do so all the time.) Using
the same situation, here’s an example of how a smooth candidate cherry-
picks the conversation:
You mention the University of Colorado, such a fine school. In addition to
taking my undergraduate degree there, I returned last summer for an inten-
sive executive management course that prepared me for exactly the kind of
position we’re discussing now. Would you like to hear more about how I am
a good match for the financial oversight functions of this position?
Religion is another slippery-slope question not to answer directly. Suppose,
for example, you’re asked if you’ll need time off to celebrate Passover — or
any religious holiday. Try this approach:
I understand your concern about the time I will need to observe my religious
beliefs, but let me assure you that if this time has any bearing on my job per-
formance at all, it will only be positive, because the inspiration of my beliefs
will help me stay renewed, fresh, and mentally focused.
Notice the answer makes no mention of specific religious holidays, it doesn’t
refuse to answer, and it doesn’t confront the interviewer with the discrimina-
tory nature of the question.
If a question is repugnant or blatantly discriminatory, don’t answer it at all 
or answer it your way — unless the question is off the wall, and then you 
may need to stand firm. For example, an in-your-face answer to an earlier
question — Is your girlfriend white? — might be
I do not feel that specific, intimate details of my personal life would be
appropriate to discuss here. They do not affect my ability to effectively per-
form the duties of this position. (Translation: Back off.)
Sometimes you have to establish your boundaries firmly. But in general, if
you want the job, avoid becoming confrontational and answer all the ques-
tions to your benefit. If the questioner would be your boss and is such a jerk
that you don’t want the job, find a polite way of uttering your exit line and
just get out.
Inappropriate and Illegal Questions
Table 24-1 illustrates inappropriate or illegal questions you hope you never
hear. Decide in advance how you’ll respond to clunkers like these — just in
case. When the question is expressed in an appropriate version, give a
straightforward answer.

Ten Tips to Avoid Wretched
Reviews
In This Chapter
 Making a terrific impression 
 Avoiding interview spoilers
 Prepping properly for a killer show
T
hink klieg lights sweeping the Hollywood sky, stretch limos pulling up to 
a theater entrance, and celebrities being interviewed by television enter-
tainment show hosts as they make their way up a red carpet into a much 
ballyhooed movie premiere.
Crazy exciting, right? Until the next morning when the reviews appear. Uh 
oh. Critics think the movie was a dog. The film’s actors and their colleagues
are spun off center with verbal depth charges instead of hoped-for praise.
Wretched reviews affect job interviewees too, even though shortcomings in
their performances won’t become public. When interviewees just don’t hear
back, they feel the same way as panned actors: awful.
Don’t let that unhappy ending happen to you. Do everything you can to make
your interview performance earn rich reviews. And to help, a master of 
job search, Joe Turner (www.jobchangesecrets.com), CEO of Swenson
Turner, Inc., a career coaching firm in Phoenix, shares 10 ways you can do
just that.
Bring Storytelling into Prime Time
An interview is a conversation. Don’t fall into an answers-only rut. That’s why
you’ve spent time learning to storytell with true prepared stories that high-
light your accomplishments (see Chapter 5). Remember, a conversation is
really a series of questions and answers. As soon as you answer a question,
try following up with a question of your own.

Go In Knowing Your Lines
About 90 percent of candidates “didn’t get the wiki” that their purpose in an
interview is to do infinitely more than ask for a job. Not you. You got the wiki.
Your goal is two-fold: First, to demonstrate that you are a good “fit” for the
organization — like salt and pepper, bread and butter, Arnold Schwarzenegger
and Hummers.
Second, you’re looking for breaking news on whether the position is really
something you want to invest your life in.
Leave the Begging to Others
Neediness is one of the all-time deal killers in the job market. Whisper in your
own ear before walking in the door: “I don’t need this job. I do need air, food,
and water.” Keep things in perspective. Sell your strengths and your ability to
do the job. Employers don’t hire because they feel sorry for you; they hire
because they want you to solve their problems.
Share the Stage with Dignity
Generally speaking, participate in an interview as an equal, not as a subordi-
nate of the person conducting the interview. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t
show courteous respect to the interviewer, especially if the interviewer is a
general and you’re a buck private. Participating as an equal is a subtle matter
of self-perception, so remind yourself of your status before the interview
begins.
Remember How a Star Is Born
From the moment you walk into an interview room, demonstrate confidence.
Your first impression makes a difference. Stand up straight, make eye contact,
and offer an enthusiastic handshake with your interviewer. If you don’t
remember names well, jot down the interviewer’s name on your notepad as
soon as you’re seated. Ditto for any other person you’re meeting with.
290
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Avoid Ad Libbing Ad Infinitum
Although you should always do your share to keep the conversational flow
going, droning on loses your audience. Telling your interviewer more than 
he or she needs to know could be fatal.
Your stories should be no longer than 60 to 90 seconds and they must —
repeat, must — have a relevant point related to your topic. Stick with your
rehearsed stories, your research, your adequate answers, and the questions
you need to ask.
You’re looking for an easy give-and-take in your interview without coming
across as a motor-mouth.
Keep in Mind That “Friends” 
Is a Television Show
Don’t make the mistake of being overly familiar. A good interviewer is skilled
enough to put you at ease within the first 10 minutes of the interview. That
doesn’t mean that the interviewer has become your best friend. Never let your
guard down. Remember that you’re there to give and receive information about
a position that you may want. From start to finish, treat this encounter as the
professional business meeting that it is.
Know That Faulty Assumptions 
Equal Faulty Interviewing
Think about this scene on a stage: The leading lady is supposed to rush to the
leading man as he enters stage right; for some reason, she assumes he’ll enter
stage left and rushes to an empty space. She looks as though she doesn’t know
what she’s doing.
The same is true when you make a wrong guess at what your interviewer has
in mind with a particular question. When in doubt, ask! You don’t lose points
at an interview for asking questions when you don’t have a clear understanding
of a point.
291
Chapter 25: Ten Tips to Avoid Wretched Reviews

Keep Emotions out of the Interview
Sure, this might be a time of stress in your life. The rent’s due, the car’s on
the fritz, or you recently had an argument with your significant other.
Put it all behind you while you’re on stage in the spotlight. Here’s why: The
interviewer may at times consciously attempt to provoke you into a tempera-
mental outburst. Don’t fall for it or take it personally. This may be only a part
of the interviewing process. Remember, your role is to be cool, calm, and col-
lected — so play the part. When emotions enter an interview, failure follows.
Ask Questions That Show 
You Care Where You Go
You want to be sure you’re getting the true picture of what this job is really
about and whether you want it. Arrive with a list of several prepared questions
about the company, the position, and the people who work there. Ask ques-
tions that begin with “what,” “how,” and “why.” Avoid simple “yes” or “no”
questions. Take notes. Most interviewers are unimpressed by a candidate
who has no questions — are you disinterested, or do you think you already
know everything?

Ten Interviewer Personality Types
In This Chapter
 Interviewer styles you may encounter
 Amusing but useful information
L
iking people who are like you is human nature. Moreover, job interview-
ers for companies tend to be representative of the kinds of people at
their respective companies.
Using general perspectives (see Chapter 1) as a starting point, look over the
following personality types, presented according to my “Latin” designations.
Without resorting to a personality transplant, try to strike a pose harmo-
nious with that of your interviewer. For example, if your interviewer is full 
of courtly charm, let honey drip from your lips; if your interviewer is brisk to
the point of brusqueness, stick to the verbal point with virtually no detours.
Heed this mirroring strategy, and you have a better chance of establishing a
good rapport.
Achieveus Youngius (Young Achiever)
Achieveus youngius: A twentysomething, fresh-faced, conservatively
dressed, preppie type most commonly seen on college campuses during job
fairs; easily tamed; demeanor is cheerful and positive — friendly.
Approach these specimens with down-home charm, and you have them eating
out of your hand. Encourage conversations about extracurricular activities,
common interests, leadership positions, admiration for the company, and a lot
of enthusiasm. But not for too long.
Specimens of this type have little or no interviewing experience, so help out
by asking questions. Doing so puts them at ease. To get the job, focus on
demonstrating traits, skills, goals, and experiences that the achieveus
youngius can relate to.

Businessius Serious (Serious
Businessperson)
Businessius serious: Gray-haired, successful, most often seen wearing a
slightly rumpled, expensive suit; females are less common than males;
demeanor is serious and businesslike.
Approach these specimens with confidence and humility and let them know
that you’re willing to work your way to the top. Discuss your academic or
work achievements, strict work ethic, steadfast dedication to a goal, and
leadership skills. Let the businessius serious see that you have broad knowl-
edge of the company.
Let this specimen control the interview. To get the job, focus on showing the
businessius serious exactly what skills you bring to the company and how you
can apply those skills toward the position you seek.
Caution: Most specimens of this type are friendly. However, a few have a
mutant gene that makes them very dangerous. Watch out for the ones who
try to bite you with stress-inducing situations and off-the-wall questions.
Bossus Potentialus (Potential Boss)
Bossus potentialus: Of variegated descriptions; similar to businessius seri-
ous; usually found at top of department, looking for help; demeanor is seri-
ous and practical.
To identify these specimens, ask whether the businessius serious interviewing
you would be your direct boss. If so, ask questions about management philos-
ophy. Then present your skills as compatible with that philosophy. For 
example, if the bossus potentialus mentions teamwork, show yourself as a
team player.
The bossus potentialus values common sense, work experience, and a positive
attitude and despises arrogance and immaturity. Use level-headed practical-
ity when approaching these specimens and let them control the interview.
298
Part V: The Part of Tens 

Contemplativius Coldius 
(Cold Contemplator)
Contemplativius coldius: Usually found in comfortable, uninteresting
clothing in a practical environment; doesn’t collect personal items; likes to
be alone; methodical, precise, and work-oriented; demeanor is quiet and
self-sufficient.
If you have any discrepancies on your resume, beware — contemplativius
coldius wants a logical explanation. These specimens are thinkers — 
analytical and critical. Approach them with reserve and self-confidence.
Don’t talk too much and don’t try to be their new best friend. Focus your
answers so that you do not stray into irrelevant information — doing so
drives contemplativius coldius crazy.
Do give plenty of information for them to mull over; they love details, so tell
them the who, what, why, when, and how. These specimens love analyzing,
but they need something to analyze. Offer your skills, achievements, and
experience as a rich analytic possibility, more interesting than any other yet
offered, and they’ll be happy.
Fuzzius Warmus (Warm Fuzzies Person)
Fuzzius warmus: Nonthreatening, friendly, likes people; several personal
items in office; usually involved in several things at once; smiles often and
genuinely; demeanor is concerned, comfortable, and thoughtful.
These specimens make sure that you’re happy and comfortable before they
start the interview. In fact, you may find that they spend so much time caring
for you that you never get interviewed.
Start by establishing a connection and then steer the interview toward more
serious matters. Fuzzius warmus is delighted to follow your lead; after all,
they just want you to be happy. Don’t expect them to be very skilled at inter-
viewing — they hate making decisions. So be ready to present all of your
qualifications for the job.

Chapter 27: Ten Interviewer Personality Types

Interviewus Incompetus (Incompetent
Interviewer)
Interviewus incompetus: Of all shapes, colors, and sizes; found in various
environments; identified by a poor interviewing technique; demeanor varies.
Unlike its distant relative, the interviewus competus, the interviewus incompe-
tus either has little training or experience in interviewing or has personality
problems. If your interview seems unfocused, or you find yourself asked
unethical or irrelevant questions, or you’re faced with an arrogant brute who
never lets you speak, you can be fairly sure that you’ve entered the lair of
interviewus incompetus.
To escape this specimen unscathed and leave the best impression possible,
gracefully take control of the situation by repeating the questions for focus,
asking questions that demonstrate your skills or knowledge in a particular
area, staying calm, and initiating discussion of your skills and their applica-
tion to the position you seek. Don’t overestimate this specimen’s ability to
uncover your potential.
Intimidatus Serious (Serious Intimidator)
Intimidatus serious: Impeccably dressed, conservative; very neat and
organized; prefers expensive, classic furnishings; work-oriented; always on
time; demeanor is reserved, dedicated, and critical.
Approach these specimens quietly and seriously. Don’t scare them away with
chatter, false friendliness, or insincerity. Intimidatus serious doesn’t go to
work to make friends, but to work — only work. So don’t waste time with
pleasantries; get right to the point as succinctly as possible.
Whatever you do, don’t let these specimens see your fear or intimidation.
They’ll kick you right out and race to the next interview.
Recruiterus Professionalus 
(Professional Recruiter)
Recruiterus professionalus: Suave, professional, well dressed; demeanor
is quiet and confident, measuring.
300
Part V: The Part of Tens 

These specimens spend their days interviewing people for specific companies.
Their goal is more to screen you out than in, as they narrow their list of appli-
cants. They won’t let you ask many questions, so concentrate on answering
their questions with as many specifics as possible about your skills, experi-
ence, and accomplishments.
To get this specimen on your side, focus on presenting the best possible you.
Make sure that your appearance is impeccable and that your enthusiasm and
interest in the job shine forth. Answer confidently and communicate clearly.
Talkus Alotus (Person Talks a Lot)
Talkus alotus: Fashionable, often individualistic in dress; hoards sentimen-
tal items like pictures or mementos; prefers clutter to order; often runs late;
demeanor is talkative and upbeat.
The talkus alotus enjoys company. These specimens gravitate toward busy
offices where they’re surrounded by many others. They like to talk and they
talk fast, so keep up.
Start by establishing a personal connection with these specimens. They prob-
ably won’t pay much attention to you if they don’t like you, so work on creat-
ing a friendly foundation by pasting a wide, sincere smile on your face and
exuding enthusiasm. Focus on keeping these specimens interested through-
out the interview — beware of boring them.
Technicus Strictus (Strictly 
Technical Person)
Technicus strictus: No definite description; look for pencils, notepads, and
gadgets, like a pocket calculator or laptop computer; often found behind a
technical title, like accountant, marketing assistant, or chemical engineer;
demeanor is friendly but distant.
The technicus strictus doesn’t mix well with other species, so camouflage
yourself in the tools of your trade. Focus on your technical knowledge and
achievements. Get this specimen excited by discussing common interests in
your field.
These specimens usually have little interviewing experience, so make sure
that you discuss your skills in detail. Don’t assume that they will be able to
uncover all of your strengths — technicus strictus are undoubtedly skilled in
their fields, but not in interviewing, so be ready to ask good questions.
301
Chapter 27: Ten Interviewer Personality Types

Too Muchus of a Good Thing?
If you’re not flatlined after reading this good but goofyius list of interview
types, reinforce your understanding by trying to think of a person you know
who fits each category. Or meet with friends and pretend you’re trying out
for the cast of a sitcom. Each friend assumes a personality type and role-
plays an interview with you. Good luck with contemplativus coldius and 
technicus strictus.
