GASTROINTESTINAL 
SYSTEM- GENERAL  
STRUCTURE & FUNCTION 
Learning Objectives 
1. Describe the functional anatomy.  
  
2. Describe the movement of food and associated gut 
secretions from “mouth to anus”. 
 
3. Identify the cells of the stomach and their secretions. 
  
4. Explain the mechanism of acid secretion.

GASTRIC ACID (HCl) & 
“ALKALINE TIDE” 
pH of blood = alkaline;  pH of stomach lumen = acidic 

ACID SECRETION IN  
FED & FASTED STATES 

GENERAL CONCEPTS 
1. Gastrointestinal tract is a muscular tube in which 
nutrients move in a unidirectional manner (mouth to anus). 
2. Regional specialization enables fragmentation of food,  
digestion and absorption of nutrients.  
3. Acid is secreted by the parietal cells of the stomach.  
This process requires carbonic anhydrase activity to generate  
H+ and HCO3- from water and CO2. Protons are pumped into  
stomach lumen by the H+/K+ ATPase (“proton pump”).  
Bicarbonate is secreted into the blood in exchange for chloride 
Ions resulting in the “alkaline high of feeding”.      
4. Acid secretion is increased in fed states and decreased  
in fasted states.
