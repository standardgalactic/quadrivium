Introduction
F
 
lying was a pleasure meant only for birds or for fools jumping off a cliff 
with homemade wings. The stuff of fancy and fantastical tales. In 1903, 
a couple of brothers put that kind of talk to rest with the first flights of their 
Flyer in North Carolina.
Computers in the home was something only seen in science-fiction films until 
a few kids got together in one of their parents’ garage and created a little 
thing they called the Apple I. According to Forrest Gump, that little “fruit 
company” has done quite well since those days.
Staying on that theme, folks used to think that teleportation was only possi-
ble in Star Trek, but just yesterday I was beamed from my local transporter to 
our secret moon base in no time flat! It was really — uh oh! I’m not supposed 
to talk about that yet . . . just forget you read that last paragraph, please.
Nothing to see here. Moving on.
The point is that when it comes to technology, fiction can often become 
reality. The fiction of being able to automate our homes became a reality a 
few decades ago, but it was something only the very (and I do mean very) 
well-heeled could afford. Since the advent of the smartphone (there’s that 
“fruit company” again) and the proliferation of cellular networks, we have 
had greater access to each other and our world than we’ve ever dreamed. 
As smartphones and apps have grown in popularity, so has the need to use 
them in ways many of us couldn’t have conceived of before. Today we not 
only can make calls and send texts, but we also use our smartphones (and 
tablets) for watching movies, catching up on the news, checking weather 
forecasts, viewing live sporting events, listening to our favorite music, and 
many more tasks that Isaac Asimov couldn’t have thought of.
Wi-Fi networks and the Internet have also opened the door (in some cases 
literally) to a whole new level of home accessibility: using our smart devices 
and apps with our home’s Wi-Fi network to remotely control and automate 
tasks in our home. You can use your iOS or Android device to adjust the tem-
perature, set the mood with customized lighting schemes, preheat the oven 
so you can cook your meal the moment you walk in the door, and even tell 
your lawn mower to start cutting your grass. That’s just scratching the sur-
face of what you can do with today’s smart home automation technology — 
and in this book, I happily tackle the subject with you.

Home Automation For Dummies 
About This Book
This book introduces you to the smart home revolution, which is today’s way 
of automating and/or remotely controlling common, everyday tasks via your 
smartphone or tablet (and in some cases, your computer), your home’s Wi-Fi 
network, and the Internet. My aim throughout the tome is to explain why you 
want to automate, how you can do so, and just what you can accomplish with 
it. This book also shows you a multitude of the aforementioned tasks that 
you can accomplish using automation and/or remote control, and how to go 
about the process of automating those tasks. I discuss not only tasks and the 
technologies, but also the companies that are the major players in today’s 
emerging smart home market.
The For Dummies series of books has been helping folks (like me) make 
the most of technology and other things that enhance our lives when we 
are properly taught how to utilize them, and I’ve written this book using 
those wonderful time-tested methods. The organization of this series is stuff 
of legend, and I’ve made sure not to deviate from them. Feel free to jump 
around as you like, or follow along in exact page order — whatever suits your 
needs. After all, this book is for you to learn about smart home automation, 
and it’s designed to help folks at various levels learn as they see fit.
Some items in the book, such as sidebars and Technical Stuff, are simply 
there because I thought they were neat. Don’t get me wrong, they do contain 
helpful information, but feel free to skip them if you like.
You’ll find this book is absolutely chock-full of URLs (otherwise known as 
webpage addresses) that you can use to check out the products I discuss. All 
of them were functional at the time of this writing, but trust me when I say 
that URLs can — and do — change often.
While reading this book, you may notice that some web addresses break across 
two lines of text. If you’re reading this book in print and want to visit one of 
these webpages, simply key in the web address exactly as it’s noted in the text, 
pretending as though the line break doesn’t exist (this might be hard for some 
English majors, but give it a try anyway). If you’re reading this as an e-book, 
you’ve got it easy — just click the web address to go directly to the webpage.
Foolish Assumptions
Dear reader, you assume a certain amount of knowledge and expertise from 
me as the author of this book. I, too, have certain expectations of you, my 
audience, when it comes to your ability to put the information contained 
herein to good use.

3

 Introduction
I assume that you are familiar with the Internet, and have at least a cursory 
knowledge of your home’s Wi-Fi network (which I also naturally assume you 
have). If you don’t know diddly about either of these things, you’ll definitely 
want to bone up on the subjects before delving into this tome too deeply. I 
don’t expect you to know how to create a website, how to run Ethernet cable 
throughout your home, or how to set up a network that even the federal 
government couldn’t crack into. However, you should at least know how to 
surf the web and how to successfully connect to and use your computer and 
smart devices, like phones and tablets, with your Wi-Fi network.
If at this point you’re wondering what all this talk is about computers and 
smart devices, my advice to you is to immediately put this book down after 
completing this paragraph. Next, peruse your local bookstore (I’m safely 
assuming you’re not reading this book’s introduction on Amazon.com) for 
other For Dummies titles that will catch you up to the rest of the world in 
those subjects of interest. When you’re ready, I’ll be here waiting to guide 
you on into the wonderful world of the smart home.
I do not assume that you have any clue about how to rewire your home’s 
electrical system or network cabling. For the record, neither is required to 
perform any of the tasks in this book.
Icons Used in This Book
Throughout this book I highlight items that I think deserve your attention 
just slightly outside of what I discuss in the primary material, or maybe I 
expand on a topic. I use the following icons to accomplish this:
Give close attention to items beside this icon. They generally will help you 
achieve results being covered more easily, or may help you avoid pratfalls in 
the process. Tips also may point you in a different direction entirely.
I know folks who use anything from reminders on their smartphones to 
writing notes on their hands with Sharpies to make sure they don’t forget 
important goings-on. The Remember icon is the For Dummies way of doing 
something along those lines, helping you to remember important things 
­relevant to the topic at hand.
When you see this icon, watch out! There’s something here that I really want 
to alert you to regarding the current topic of discussion. An example would 
be if a certain home automation protocol would conflict with other protocols 
in your current home automation setup, I would certainly make you privy to 
that knowledge in a Warning icon.

Home Automation For Dummies 
Geeks rejoice! This icon alerts you to items that may be of interest to you in 
your quest for home automation. Topics featured with this icon may or may 
not be exactly relevant to the one being discussed in the chapter, or may be 
something pertaining to topical trivialities. I just couldn’t help myself and 
thought you might be interested in them, so there.
Beyond the Book
I’ve put a ton of information between the covers of this book, but there’s 
even more information that you can access on www.dummies.com, such as
✓
✓I provide you with a Cheat Sheet at www.dummies.com/cheatsheet/
homeautomation that lists the following:
•	The best home lighting devices
•	The top smart thermostats
•	Wi-Fi routers to use with your smart home automation system
✓
✓You also will find extra helpful online articles at www.dummies.com/
extras/homeautomation that discuss
•	The best smartphones and tablets
•	Streaming media providers
•	Ten top whole-home automation companies (they do all the work 
for you, in other words)
•	A list of links to all the outdoor home automation products  
I ­mention in Chapters 11 and 12
Where to Go from Here
I wrote Home Automation For Dummies with the idea in mind that you, dear 
reader, would be able to tackle the subject either in the order that it’s writ-
ten or in bits and bites as you desire. In other words, there is no one way in 
which you must read this book. I will say, however, that if you’re a complete 
newbie at this whole smart home thing, you’ll be best served to start at  
Part I; from there you’ll have enough of a frame of reference to understand 
the subjects in the other four parts.
Congratulations on automating and remotely controlling your home. Ain’t 
technology great? I guarantee you’ll think so when you’re enjoying a nice 
­evening on the town with a loved one and you receive a text from your 
robotic lawn mower letting you know the mowing has been finished.

ow do we make life better?”
“How do we make more time for what really matters?”
“Why can’t television commercials for technology companies incorporate music 
that doesn’t involve finger snaps, hand claps, xylophones, and ukuleles?”
Those three questions haunt me every day, as I’m sure they do you, gentle 
reader. However, only the first two issues are ones that I think mankind 
will actually be able to do anything about in the near future. That said, 
I concentrate on those in this book.
People have always had to work, and we’ve always tried to find ways to make 
that work easier, whether by developing better tools and technologies to do the 
work or by making other folks or things do the work for us. Sick of digging up 
dirt with your bare hands to plant seeds? Let’s invent the plow and make our 
cattle do the heavy lifting. No longer want to beat your clothes with a rock in 
the nearest creek? We’ll invent the washing machine, then. Don’t want to carry 
ten jugs with you to the river to gather water? By George, I think aqueducts and 
plumbing might be a good idea. We are always on the lookout for ways to do 
tasks better or shirk them altogether — and that’s a good thing, if you ask me.
Home automation is yet another step in this struggle for making life better. 
Some folks may scoff at the idea that automation means life is better, but I’ll 
bet those same folks don’t mind using a gas or electric mower when it comes 
time to cut the lawn. I’ll wager a pretty penny that they really appreciate their 
automatic dishwashers and their refrigerators, too. Time marches on — and 
so does technology.

Let’s see . . . if I were to give my own definition of what home automation 
is, I’d first look at the definitions for each of the two words that make 
up the phrase. For that task, I consult the Merriam-Webster website  
(www.merriam-webster.com):
✓
✓home (noun): the place (such as house or apartment) where a person lives
✓
✓automation (noun): automatically controlled operation of an apparatus, 
process, or system by mechanical or electronic devices that take the 
place of human labor
Combining the two definitions, I initially conclude that home automation 
is the act of automatically controlling tasks within the home that are nor-
mally performed through an act of human labor. While this sounds neat and 
orderly, it actually isn’t so (but it’s getting there, and quickly). Home automa-
tion has been around for a long time, but it’s beginning to really take off for 
consumers at all price points in this Internet age.
That said, and before I get too far ahead of myself, let’s take a brief look at 
how home automation has been achieved in the past and how it’s getting 
done these days.
Doing it the old-fashioned way
“Is there an old-fashioned way of doing home automation?” you ask. My 
reply: “Yes, indeed.”
Before I get too far afield, allow me to define what I mean by “old-fashioned” 
in terms of home automation: spending thousands (and sometimes tens of 
thousands) of dollars to implement customized automation solutions within 
a section of your home (such as the entertainment room seen in Figure 1-1) 
or throughout the entire space.
Home automation has been around for quite a while, but some of its 
technology tended to be available primarily for folks with fat bank accounts. 
Why? Glad you asked.
✓
✓Home automation used to be a specialty premium service, requiring a 
great deal of money to manufacture.
✓
✓Installing a home automation system often required extensive rewiring 
and other electrical work.


 Chapter 1: Home Automation 101
✓
✓Ongoing support and maintenance of a customized home automation 
solution was (and in some cases, still is) expensive by nature.
✓
✓Systems were truly customized to the individual home, creating 
higher costs.
These are just some of the reasons for the super-high cost of past systems, 
and for the still-high costs of similar comprehensive home automation 
solutions today. Controlling your entire home’s lighting just wasn’t 
something that most of the housing market was doing until recently. 
Also, old-fashioned home automation was something you did within the 
confines of your home; rarely were you able to handle tasks remotely. 
Some home automation technologies, such as intercoms and garage door 
openers, were never as expensive as others to implement, and therefore 
more prevalent in homes. However, they were the exception rather than 
the rule.
Before I finish this section, I want to make it understood that I see nothing 
wrong with whole-home, customized automation, and many companies today 
excel at it (and bully for you if you have the moola to do it!).

Automating homes today
I don’t know about you, but most people would jump at the chance to auto-
mate more things in their lives if doing so were affordable and could be 
achieved with reasonably minimal effort. Well, you’re in luck. Most of us are 
able to automate at least certain aspects of home life today because they 
don’t cost an arm or a leg, and they aren’t difficult to install.
Home Automation For Dummies focuses on how you can simply and rela-
tively inexpensively control many of your daily tasks. Not only that, most of 
what I cover can be handled remotely, meaning you don’t even have to be at 
home to do this awesome stuff. 
Today, all you need to implement a home automation system is an Internet 
connection and (in some cases, but not all) a device to control it, such as a 
smartphone, table, or computer. Of course, you have to purchase a system 
Self-installing a home automation system
I’m certain some of you handier folks reading 
this book (for which I humbly thank you, by 
the way) are thinking about implementing the 
type of whole-home system I just described 
yourself, and that’s certainly a possibility. 
However, depending on the extent you want to 
automate your home, the time needed will be 
great, the work involved will be monumental, 
and the cost will still be up there a bit. I’m not 
trying to discourage do-it-yourselfers at all, if 
that’s truly what you want to do, but if you think 
you might be even the slightest bit concerned 
about my earlier caveats, either let companies 
that specialize in these kinds of installations 
handle it for you, or please do read on with an 
expectation that you can learn how to automate 
your home without tremendous headaches and 
hassles.

Benefitting from Home Automation
The idea of home automation is really cool and futuristic, but if that’s your only 
motivation to automate the things in your home, you just might be missing the 
forest for the trees. Sure, you can impress friends by turning on your fireplace 
with a tap of your iPhone, but benefits of home automation go way beyond 
bragging rights.
Convenience is key!
Convenience is indeed the key; otherwise, what’s truly the point? The  
words “home” and “automation” fit together perfectly to describe how to  
get things done easier, better, and faster than ever before, which equates  
to convenience.
or appliances, but many of them that utilize your Wi-Fi network (or even 
your home’s power lines) are inexpensive. Another bonus with today’s home 
automation technology is that you can start as small as you like and build 
up to as large as you like. For example, with a kit such as the WeMo Switch + 
Motion kit from Belkin (see Figure 1-2), you can begin with just a smart wall 
outlet and a motion detector, but can add more and more WeMo devices to 
your heart’s content.

Want a few examples of how today’s home automation is convenient? Okay, 
here you go:
✓
✓Your teenage son calls from a friend’s cellphone and tells you he’s 
locked his keys and everything else he owns in the car you let him 
borrow. This kid is 30 minutes away — not good. Suddenly you 
remember you had installed a device in your car that enables you 
to unlock it (and even start it) from a million miles away with your 
smartphone. A few taps and swipes on your phone, and your son is  
back in the car. Convenience.
✓
✓The lawn needs mowing before company arrives this weekend, but 
you’ve been in meetings all week on the other side of the country, and 
now you’re stuck in the airport. Whip out your Android phone, open 
your robotic lawn mower’s app, and tell it to get to work. The lawn’s 
done before your plane even lands. Convenience.
✓
✓You and the family are singing “Let It Go” of Frozen fame for the 100th 
time on your road trip to Disney World when it dawns on you (three 
hours away from home) that you left the lights on and an electric heater 
running in the bathroom. You calmly fire up your iOS tablet, open the 
app for your home automation system, and turn off the lights and the 
outlet the heater is plugged in to. Dare I use the “C” word again? You 
bet I do. Convenience.
Here are a few other things you can do conveniently from anywhere with 
today’s home automation:
✓
✓Adjust your home’s thermostat.
✓
✓Control your sprinkler system.
✓
✓Preheat your oven from anywhere, with an app like GE’s Brillion (along 
with supported appliances, of course), seen in Figure 1-3.
✓
✓Unlock or lock your front door.
✓
✓Raise or lower the window shades.
✓
✓Change the schedule of your coffee pot.
✓
✓Initiate a washing or drying cycle.
✓
✓Clean your aquarium.
✓
✓Control how much television your kids watch.
✓
✓Keep tabs on how much electricity you’re using.
✓
✓Be alerted to a water leak in your bathroom.
✓
✓Find out if someone enters your home unannounced.
✓
✓Clean your cat’s kitty litter.

I’m sure things are starting to click for you when I say that remotely 
controlled home automation affords a level of convenience that most people 
have not yet experienced. And that list just scratches the surface!
S-E-C-U-R-I-T-Y
Fewer things in life are more appreciated than security — in this case, 
knowing (or at least feeling) that you’re more safe doing things a certain 
way or using certain devices. Today’s Internet-based home automation 
technology gives one just that kind of security.
Sure, home security companies have been in existence for decades now,  
and they are great at what they do. People also have had personal means  
of protection that usually work as intended, provided they’re used properly. 
Security cameras have also been providing more home security for some 
time, although they typically were expensive to install. With today’s tech, 

14
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
however, you can secure your home in myriad ways you never were able  
to before:
✓
✓Wi-Fi cameras provide a look into your home from anywhere you have 
an Internet connection.
✓
✓Motion detectors keep you privy to any activity in your home.
✓
✓Smart locks and security apps, such as the one from alarm.com shown 
in Figure 1-4, allow you to lock and unlock your doors, no matter 
whether you’re home or visiting family halfway around the globe.
✓
✓When coupled with the use of door and window sensors, apps can alert 
you via text or email when someone enters your home uninvited.
✓
✓You can control lighting within your home from anywhere you have a 
connection to the Internet, making it appear to folks outside that some-
one is home.
And these are just some of the things that Internet-enabled home automation 
systems and devices can do to help raise your level of personal and family 
security.

The bottom line: $
Sooner or later, I have to delve into the bottom line: money. Now is as good a 
time as any.
Today’s Internet and network-based home automation technologies are much 
more wallet-friendly than whole-home options. The savings between the two 
home automation routes is astronomical: I’m talking low hundreds for the 
former and well into the thousands for the latter. Of course, the amount you 
spend on either totally depends on what you want to do, but the gap is still 
significant no matter how high-powered you go with Internet and network-based 
solutions. Attaining an equal amount of control with a whole-home solution will 
run your initial costs sky high due to the labor and technology involved.
Here’s how today’s home automation technology can help you save your 
precious and hard-earned cash:
✓
✓Probably the most obvious money savings can be achieved by a 
reduction in lighting costs. With today’s solutions, you can remotely 
control lighting to the nth degree:
•	Turn lights on or off with a touch of your smartphone or tablet’s 
screen.
•	Create lighting schedules so that lights come on and go off at 
designated times.
•	Tie your lights into motion sensors so that lights come on when 
you enter a room and go off when you leave it.
•	Dim lights automatically based on other lighting conditions in 
the room, such as sunlight directly coming through windows or 
skylights during certain hours of the day.
•	Smart, low-wattage LED bulbs, like INSTEON’s 2672-222 
(see Figure 1-5), can provide nearly or the same amount of light 
as standard bulbs running at much higher wattages.
•	Smart LED bulbs don’t need replacing nearly as frequently as 
standard bulbs, saving you tons in bulb costs over the life span of 
the LED.
•	Smart LED bulbs put off much less heat, so cooling and heating 
costs are affected.
✓
✓Water leak detection can prevent a high water bill, and also the some-
times enormous costs of water damage.
✓
✓Keeping home temperatures level saves a chunk of change over fluc-
tuating temps. Also, turning thermostats on or off remotely can save a 
bundle, too.

16
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
✓
✓You save fuel when you don’t have to turn around and go home because 
you did something like forget to lock the front door when you ran out. 
Just use the app on your smartphone to lock the deadbolt while motor-
ing along on your merry way.
✓
✓Robotic mowers save money on gas because they use electricity. With 
prices like they are at the pump, this can translate into big savings.
As long as you use your home automation technology in an intelligent way, 
you will save money compared to operating things status quo. There’s no way 
around it.
Understanding the Tech Involved  
in Home Automation
As with everything else in the world of computers and electronic devices, 
home automation only gets better as it moves forward. Technology in 
modern computers has jumped light-years over the decades, as has tech 
used in how people make and listen to music. In the same way, home automa-
tion tech has moved from the Stone Age to something most of us are totally 
at home with: the Internet.
The technical state of home 
automation today
Home automation technology has changed a great deal over the decades. 
Certain communication protocols (more on those as you continue to

read) used for home automation have been around for a long time and, 
unfortunately, some are getting rather long in the tooth. Others, though, 
have retained their popularity and are still in widespread use.
The way that home automation worked in whole-home solutions of the past 
was that a central controller was placed in the home and the user controlled 
it through wall-mounted keypads and remote control boxes.
These days, whole-home solutions are much improved and incorporate 
Internet and network-based technologies to connect you to your home. 
You can also remotely control your home using smartphones and tablets. 
The operating systems are typically customized for their clients, though, 
as is everything in a whole-home system.
Modular Internet and network-based solutions that utilize apps and the web 
are taking the market by storm, due to affordability, convenience, and the 
capability to be added on to.
Another factor in their growth is that folks are familiar with their modes 
of usage. Lots and lots of people have smartphones and tablets today, and 
most of those devices are running on iOS or Android operating systems. 
The modular home automation solutions allow you to buy products that 
you interact with through other products (your smart devices and home 
network) that you’re already familiar with. You know how to tap and swipe 
touchscreens, right? Most apps work the same, or at least similarly, to other 
apps, so the learning curve isn’t steep.
Current home networking protocols
A protocol is a set of rules, or standards, that a technology employs 
to ensure stability. For example, networking utilizes protocols to keep 
­communications consistent across devices, and those protocols are adhered 
to across the various platforms they are running within. This same concept 
applies to home networking technologies, too, with the aim of making  
sure that various types of automation devices can be controlled by a  
central device.
Many companies today use more than one home automation protocol in  
their controller systems, ensuring compatibility with a greater number  
of devices.
Let’s take a look at the most common protocols used in home automation 
today.

18
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
X10 has been around for as long as I have, since the 1970s, and that can be 
taken either in a good way or a bad way (much like me, too, I guess). Here’s 
what you need to know about X10:
✓
✓X10 originally was intended solely to use your existing home wiring to 
communicate with devices.
✓
✓X10 does now have a wireless communication component, but it isn’t as 
robust as others on the market.
✓
✓X10 wasn’t originally designed to be used in environments with 
competing signals and communication protocols, so it doesn’t have the 
same security measures that other protocols do.
Go to www.x10.org to find out more about the protocol and devices that 
support it.
Because power lines are more complex than they used to be, and since X10 
is a much older protocol, its speeds aren’t all that good. As a matter of fact, 
if you’re new to the home automation game and don’t already have an exist-
ing X10 environment, it’s best to skip X10 and move on to one of the newer 
protocols.
UPB


 Chapter 1: Home Automation 101
Universal Powerline Bus (UPB) was created by PCS Powerline Control 
Systems in 1999. Like X10, UPB is designed to work over your home’s existing 
power lines, but unlike X10, it does appear to be fairly stable when it comes 
to transmitting information. UPB is dissimilar in still another way to X10, but 
this time, it isn’t necessarily a good thing: UPB doesn’t support any form of 
wireless communication. Needless to say, insofar as your search for the right 
home automation protocol for your needs, UPB shouldn’t be too high on the 
list. (In fact, I don’t even discuss it any further.)
Z-Wave
Z-Wave is one of the most popular protocols in use today; it was developed in 
2007 specifically for home automation devices. Well more than 200 com-
panies around the world use Z-Wave. I’d say it’s a big deal (as far as home 
­automation goes). More about Z-Wave:
✓
✓Products that support Z-Wave work with each other seamlessly, 
regardless of manufacturer, which makes Z-Wave an even bigger deal.
✓
✓Z-Wave devices use very little power, so if they’re battery-powered 
they’ll last longer than you might expect. Some products list battery 
lives in terms of years.
✓
✓Z-Wave utilizes a mesh network for communication, meaning that one 
device passes along information to the next device, and so on down the 
line.
A really nice website dedicated to all things Z-Wave is www.z-wave.com. If 
you’re considering going with Z-Wave products during your home automation 
investigation, you’ll certainly want to visit the site more than once.
Z-Wave is owned by the Z-Wave Alliance, which has done a great job in 
getting developers the help they need to create products using the Z-Wave 
standard. If you’re a developer looking to jump into Z-Wave, check out

ZigBee
Like Z-Wave, ZigBee is another relatively new protocol for home automation, 
and it is also enjoying a certain amount of popularity right now. A few inter-
esting tidbits about ZigBee:
✓
✓ZigBee was developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics 
Engineers (IEEE), the same folks who brought you the networking proto-
cols used by your computers and smart devices.
✓
✓The ZigBee Alliance is tasked with getting the word out about the ZigBee 
protocol. The Alliance is comprised of a team of businesses, universities, 
and government agencies interested in pushing the ZigBee message to 
the masses.
✓
✓ZigBee uses a mesh network to communicate among devices running the 
protocol, meaning its range and power increase with every device you 
add to your home automation network.
Intrigued? Visit www.zigbee.org for a smorgasbord of information on the 
protocol.
ZigBee is quite popular, but you must be careful to purchase all your ZigBee-
enabled devices from the same manufacturer. Reliability between ZigBee 
devices made by different companies is suspect, at best, since companies  
are not forced to deploy ZigBee in the same manner.

 Chapter 1: Home Automation 101
The good people at SmartLabs, Inc., came up with INSTEON in 2005, so it is 
also a relative newcomer to the home automation market. Here are some 
important things to know about INSTEON:
✓
✓Since INSTEON is owned by SmartLabs, it is able to run a tight ship, as 
all its devices work together with ease.
✓
✓INSTEON boasts over 200 products that run the home automation 
gamut:
•	Light bulbs
•	Light switches and dimmers
•	Motion sensors
•	Thermostats
•	Wi-Fi cameras
•	Sprinkler controls
And so much more, I promise!
INSTEON uses dual-band communication in many of its devices, which means 
it can communicate over both your home’s existing power lines and via RF 
(radio frequency), doubling its effectiveness.
Wi-Fi
The newest protocol, at least in terms of its use in home automation, is (are 
you ready?) Wi-Fi. Obviously, Wi-Fi has been around for quite a while and 
most of us have used it with laptops and smartphones and tablets for years. 
Image courtesy of Wi-Fi Alliance.

22
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
However, only fairly recently have manufacturers begun to develop home 
automation devices that use it. A bit about Wi-Fi as it pertains to home auto-
mation (the good and the bad, by the way):
✓
✓Many people already have a Wi-Fi network in their homes, so there’s no 
need to purchase a separate hub to control home automation devices 
that use Wi-Fi.
✓
✓Wi-Fi is fast — maybe. I say maybe because your Wi-Fi network only has 
so much bandwidth to go around. If your home automation devices are 
sharing bandwidth with every other conceivable Wi-Fi gadget you own 
on the market (smartphones, tablets, laptops, game consoles, televi-
sions, you name it), you may experience disruptions and slowdowns in 
controlling your home auto devices.
✓
✓Wi-Fi is a power hog, so you can’t use it reliably with devices that need 
battery power to work. It drains batteries much too quickly.
The Wi-Fi Alliance is a worldwide organization of companies that develop  
and support Wi-Fi. They’re also the folks who came up with the famous  
Wi-Fi logo you all see whenever you go to Starbucks and your favorite 
­bookstores. To learn more about the Alliance, as well as Wi-Fi itself, check  
out www.wi-fi.org.
The future of home automation technology
All these aforementioned protocols have their pluses and minuses. By 
themselves, they don’t play very nicely with one another. Other companies, 
such as Apple and Revolv, have seen this problem coming and are tackling it 
head on by creating environments that can control several, if not all, of the 
home automation protocols, tying all your devices together and eliminating 
the need for you to stick with just one manufacturer. For more in-depth 
information, read Chapter 14, which covers what I call “home automation 
oneness.”

reparation is key to most things we do: There’s no getting around it, 
unless you’re one of those folks who just “wings it.”
Your girlfriend has just accepted your invitation to marriage. What do you 
think happens next? Now, there may be that infinitesimally small faction out 
there who did just “wing it,” finding the local parson and getting hitched right 
away. But for the most part, the newly minted fiancée (with the help of every 
other female she’s ever met) immediately sets about the tasks that any bride-
to-be should: finding a dress, caterer, reception hall, baker, flowers, invita-
tions, music, and on and on the list goes. By the time she’s ready to walk 
down the aisle, everything imaginable has been checked, double-checked,  
triple-checked, and checked once more for good measure. Your fiancée’s hard 
work may look like nothing more than a big hoopla at the time, but it will be 
the reason you have beautiful memories of that day 30 years from now.
How about kids and school? More than a little preparation goes into the first 
day of school, especially if you have more than one child. Your school makes 
a list, seemingly as long as your arm, and off you go to the store. You dive 
into the sea of other parents, which resembles a mosh pit of sorts, searching 
for the items on your list. Of course, your child’s teacher has listed the rarest 
birds in school supplies, such as the three-subject winged college-ruled hot 
pink notebook with built-in cup holder. Regardless, once you’re home with 
your hard-won supplies and get everything for that glorious first day, some-
thing just feels good about it — really good. Of course, if you’re smart like my 
wife, you skip the stores and do your shopping online, but I digress.
If “winging it” is your cup of tea, this chapter might not be, but I still encour-
age you to read on. You might discover a nugget or two tucked away in here 
that will spark you to at least be kinda sorta prepared for setting up your 
home automation system.

Happiness Is a Wireless Network
Are you old enough to recall a day when you had to sit with your computer, 
whether it was a laptop or not, at a dedicated location where you could con-
nect it to a network cable? Of course you are; it wasn’t that long ago that 
Wi-Fi came into the main. While the capabilities to quickly transfer files to 
servers, email your buddies, and surf the web were awesome, you still were 
tethered to that one spot.
While Wi-Fi was slowly gaining more steam thanks to better and less expensive 
laptops, it wasn’t until the advent of the smartphone that Wi-Fi began to prolif-
erate. Once Steve Jobs first introduced the world to the iPhone, and the only 
way to connect it to the Internet was wirelessly, you immediately knew the 
world and the way you communicated in it were about to change. Even though 
the full ramifications of a truly wireless world hadn’t quite yet hit home for 
most of us, you couldn’t help but know that life was better without the tether.
Nowadays most people with Internet access in their homes run a Wi-Fi net-
work of some kind using a wireless router (like the two shown in Figure 2-1). 
We can now walk around the house as we listen to streaming music on our 
smartphones without a wire visible (save for the headphones’ wires, unless 
they’re Bluetooth).
Preparing your network for the extra load
A wireless network is like any other in that it can efficiently handle only so much 
workload. Thankfully, routers can handle pretty hefty workloads due to high 
bandwidth support. Bandwidth, for those who don’t know, is the measure of the 
amount of information a network device can pass through at any one time.
In today’s homes, wireless networks are being put to the test. A single home 
wireless network may be doing all the heavy lifting for a plethora of devices:
✓
✓Multiple smartphones are common in homes today, and more often than 
not, those folks who don’t have unlimited data plans with their cell pro-
vider will want to use their Wi-Fi network for surfing the web and con-
ducting other Internet-based tasks.
✓
✓Multiple tablets in a home translate into a heavier load on a wireless 
­network; there’s no other way to connect them to the Internet.
✓
✓Multiple laptops in a home also cause a drag on your wireless  
network.

25

 Chapter 2: What You Need to Get Started
✓
✓Other devices, such as streaming media players like Roku devices 
(shown in Figure 2-2), Apple TV, and Google’s Chromecast, place a high 
demand on your wireless router. Your kids may be streaming a Disney 
movie in one room, your spouse may be checking out the latest season 
of Downton Abbey, and you might be streaming the big game in your man 
cave. That kind of activity would make most wireless networks struggle 
to catch their breath.
Recognizing network problems
All the preceding examples were to say that your wireless network already 
may be working very hard to keep up with your needs, and adding more to 
the load with a home automation system could cause enough extra strain 
that the whole thing comes to a crawl. Please understand, I’m not saying this 
is the case for all: You may never need to change anything on your network. 
You may be able to incorporate all the home automation devices you can 
get your hands on without noticing so much as a hiccup in your network’s 
­performance. On the flip side of that argument, though, you might add a 
single device to your system and find it unusable (doubtful, but never say 
never).

Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
How can you recognize that your network is having problems due to over-
load? Here are a few telltale signs to look for:
✓
✓Simply enough, you can’t seem to browse the Internet and load web 
pages as fast as you have before.
✓
✓Things start to get wonky, such as a streaming video begins to get 
choppy with a noticeable degradation in quality, or transferring files 
from your computer to another takes dramatically much more time  
than it has before.
✓
✓You lose your Internet connection altogether.
Before adding devices to your network, test your network speed by com-
municating with other devices and browsing the web. Run the exact same 
tests after you add a device to your network. If everything is more or less the 
same, your network is running well, even with the additional device. If every-
thing comes to a near-halt, the newly added device is most likely the culprit. 
Remove the device and see if everything instantly returns to normal. If so, 
you will need to do something to increase your network’s bandwidth in order 
to use the device.
Another issue you may run into with your home automation devices is that 
your network’s range may not be sufficient. For example, you might place 
a device in a room that doesn’t get a good signal from your router. In this 
case, the device may not get enough signal to communicate reliably, if at all.

 Chapter 2: What You Need to Get Started
Speeding up and extending your network
How to resolve this network issue, especially if you’re bent on getting  
this home automation thing off the ground? Here are a few ways to get the 
job done:
✓
✓Upgrade your wireless router. If your current router is made of wood or 
has “Moses wuz here” carved on the bottom of it, it’s probably a good 
idea to do so anyway.
✓
✓Relocate your router, or at least place it higher than it may be. It cur-
rently may be located in an area that isn’t conducive to sending a strong 
signal. Finding a different place for it to reside, preferably a central loca-
tion, could alleviate the problem.
✓
✓Get a second router (or access point). If getting a new router or relocat-
ing your current one isn’t something you can or want to do, getting a 
second router (or access point) is the way to go. Connect the two via 
Ethernet cable, and your woes will be history.
✓
✓Purchase a wireless range extender. Wireless range extenders, like 
that seen in Figure 2-3, do just what their name implies: They extend the 
range of your current router by picking up the signal and rebroad­casting 
it at greater strength. Strategically placing one or more of these may 
instantly make your problems disappear. Be aware that these little guys 
don’t always work as well as you’d like, since they are receiving and 
sending signals using the same channel.
Being cautious when adding new devices 
to your network
In case you didn’t know, the Internet isn’t the most secure place in the world. 
Many folks think they’re anonymous on the web, or that their home network 
is privy to them and them alone. Well, I’m sorry, but nothing could be further 
from the truth. There are folks out there — bad folks, I don’t mind saying — 
who are out to exploit the Internet for their gain and your loss. They have 
ways of getting into your life that you may not be aware of.
Did you know that folks can access your Wi-Fi from outside your home? 
Depending on your network’s signal strength, they could even be sitting in a 
car on the street outside your home, using your Wi-Fi signal to do all kinds of 
nefarious things.
They don’t necessarily have to get into your network directly through your 
router itself; they can use devices that are connected to your Wi-Fi to get 
inside. Folks, these people can even view what you see on your webcams

or monitors. Did you hear about the couple in Texas who discovered that 
hackers had been spying on their baby using the camera they installed in the 
baby’s room? Scary, scary stuff.
Securing networked devices
This is a book about home automation, not about setting up secure networks. 
Plenty of great tomes on the market cover the topic, and there are also a slew 
of websites that can tell you how to lock down your home network. I humbly 
advise you to look into some of these resources. My aim with this section of 
the book is to make you aware that your privacy is at risk and that adding 
devices that I discuss in this book to your network can further expose you if 
you don’t take precautions.
Here are a few tips for securing your network from prying eyes:
✓
✓Many devices come with default usernames and passwords that you’re 
supposed to change, but lots of folks don’t bother to do so. Leaving 
these default usernames and passwords on your devices is like leaving 
your front door wide open.


 Chapter 2: What You Need to Get Started
✓
✓Use a firewall between your Internet connection and the devices on your 
network as a first defense against intruders. The firewall can typically 
be enabled on your router, but that isn’t the only one you can enable. 
Computers usually have firewalls on them, too; consult your operating 
system’s Help sources for more information.
✓
✓Enable security protocols on your router when setting up your Wi-Fi.  
Be sure to use a robust password for connecting to the network, too.
✓
✓Many home automation devices that connect to your Wi-Fi network may 
not have any security features at all, which is problematic, to be sure.  
Be sure to ask vendors about security features included in their devices, 
as well as how to best set them up for your network.
✓
✓Turn on whatever network security and privacy functions your  
smartphones or tablets may feature, such as those in iOS (shown in 
Figure 2-4).
If you aren’t familiar with home network security, I highly suggest getting up 
to speed on the subject or bringing in a professional who is.

Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
Monitoring your network for intrusions
It’s creepy to think that someone could be on your network without your 
knowledge. Who knows what he’s doing on it or what he may be accessing?
Knowing if anyone is on your network unauthorized is actually not all that 
complicated:
1.	Log in to your router.
	If you don’t know how, consult the documentation that came with it or 
contact the manufacturer.
2.	Go to the section within the router software that shows what devices 
are connected to it.
	Some devices in the list may look familiar and others may not. However, 
just because something doesn’t look familiar to you doesn’t mean it isn’t 
one of your devices. Here’s how to determine what the devices con-
nected to your network are:
•	One at a time, turn off the Wi-Fi connection on wireless devices 
you’re using. When a device disappears from the list, you know it 
was the device you just disabled Wi-Fi on.
•	One at a time, disconnect the network cable from computers 
or other devices that are wired to your router. As with wireless 
devices, when a device disappears from the list you know it was 
the one you just disconnected.
•	Once you’ve performed this inventory, if there are any devices in 
the list you can’t account for, you can feel confident that someone 
with bad intentions is connected to your network.
Should you find devices connected to your network that aren’t authorized, 
consult your router’s documentation, or the manufacturer’s support team, 
for ways to block those devices from gaining access.
It’s a good idea when performing this inventory of devices connected to your 
network to write down the names of each device. That way you won’t have to 
go through this routine every time you decide to perform this check.
Having the Right Tools for the Job
Tools are items you use to get a job done. That said, there are several man-
ners of tools that you will need to set up and operate your home automation 
system, and that’s exactly the function of this section of the chapter.

31

 Chapter 2: What You Need to Get Started
Actual tools you’ll need
When the word “tool” is bandied about, most folks automatically think of 
­hammers and nails and such. Well, indeed, you may need some actual tools 
when getting your home automation equipment up and running. Some items, 
such as webcams and light bulbs, don’t need tools at all. Webcams simply sit 
somewhere and light bulbs just screw into your light sockets. Other devices, 
like thermostats and locks, require tools — tools that most folks have in their 
toolbox.
Here’s a basic list of tools you need for some jobs related to installing your 
home automation system:
✓
✓A screwdriver set that includes several sizes of both flathead and 
Phillips head screwdrivers
✓
✓Pliers, including those of the needle-nose variety
✓
✓Wire cutters
✓
✓A voltmeter for measuring voltages in wires
✓
✓A sledgehammer for taking out your frustrations on a tree stump outside 
if everything doesn’t go as planned (better to pound a tree stump than 
toss a $300 home automation device off the balcony)
Computers and smartphones  
and tablets, oh my!
Yes, computers, smartphones, and tablets are indeed tools. Most of us use 
them every day for anything from getting our jobs done to talking with Mom 
1,000 miles away to playing games. They are tools, and as such, are up next  
in the discussion of home automation tools.
The majority of home automation devices in this book connect with one or 
all of the aforementioned tools, and even more, they are controlled by them 
to varying degrees:
✓
✓Most home automation devices supply their own apps for smartphones 
and tablets.
✓
✓Others work with third-party apps and controllers, like the Wink hub 
and app shown in Figure 2-5, to ensure success on such devices.

32
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
✓
✓Some manufacturers, though very few, provide computer operating 
system-specific applications to control their devices. (I don’t understand 
why they would waste the resources to develop such a tool, especially 
in light of the next point, but that’s just me.)
✓
✓Still others incorporate web pages (like that shown in Figure 2-6) that 
users can connect to and control devices via the Internet from any 
device (computer, smartphone, or tablet) that is connected to the web.

Home automation companies support these operating systems:
✓
✓iOS: The operating system that controls Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices
✓
✓Android: Controls a large segment of non-Apple smartphones and tablets
✓
✓OS X: Operating system that runs Apple’s line of personal computers
✓
✓Windows: Microsoft’s operating system that runs a majority of non-
Apple personal computers
✓
✓Linux: The most popular free operating system that comes in many  
different forms

 Chapter 2: What You Need to Get Started
See Chapter 13 for much more detailed coverage about these devices, their 
operating systems, and how to keep them up and running so your home 
­automation system is at peak performance.
Power to get the job done
Home automation devices require power from some source, whether it be
✓
✓Directly wired (like a thermostat)
✓
✓Plugged into an outlet (like WeMo’s Smart Switch, shown in Figure 2-7)
✓
✓From batteries (water detection sensors, for instance)
Today’s home automation devices are designed to jump right into your home 
as it is, with little to no wiring of any kind needed. However, that doesn’t 
mean that you might not need electrical work of some type performed in 
­certain cases. Here are some examples:
✓
✓You need more outlets to take full advantage of new home automation 
devices.
✓
✓Your present wiring is faulty or dangerous. If you have frequent electri-
cal issues, make sure that your home’s electrical system can handle the 
extra load.

✓You live in an older home that retains most of its original wiring. Up­grading 
wiring might be necessary if you want to install some devices, like the 
INSTEON thermostat in Figure 2-8, which requires low-voltage wiring and 
won’t work with older high-voltage wiring.

 Chapter 2: What You Need to Get Started
Should you find that you need wiring, if you don’t know what you’re doing, 
seek the help of a licensed electrician. While you may not relish the expense 
involved in obtaining the services of an electrician, it sure beats paying a doctor 
to correct your body’s electrical system (assuming you don’t fry it, that is). 
Am I correct? I should also mention that you need to be absolutely certain that 
doing your own wiring is even something you can legally do in your neck of 
the woods. Many areas require certified electricians to do any electrical work 
needed, so be sure to check with local authorities before you do anything.
This will not come as an epiphany to those of you who know what you’re 
doing when it comes to electrical work, but will be a good reminder for those 
who don’t do this sort of thing regularly: Be absolutely certain to cut the 
power at the main electrical panel in your home! If you aren’t sure what I’m 
talking about in this case, in the name of all that is good, do not attempt any 
electrical work on your own.

Determining Your Home 
Automation Needs (and Wants)
In This Chapter
▶
▶Considering which factors are important to your home automation needs
▶
▶Determining what you want to automate in your home
To be prepared is half the victory.
— Miguel de Cervantes
I
 
 
t’s all about the preparation, friend.
Do you think General George S. Patton was prepared when his troops went 
into battle? Can you imagine one of the greatest leaders in United States 
military history just showing up with a few guys he picked up at the bar on 
the way to the front lines? No, I don’t think so. Patton knew his troops and 
they knew him, and as such they were prepared for whatever was thrown  
their way.
If you ever saw the late Steve Jobs at an Apple event launching a new 
product, like the iPhone, I doubt the word “unprepared” comes to mind. 
The man was a master showman and salesman, and every pitch had been 
made to perfection. I’ll bet Jobs knew where every crease and wrinkle in his 
turtleneck was.
Julia Child could cook, I’ll have you know. As one of the world’s premiere 
chefs in her day, she was also an international celebrity with her own cook-
ing show. When she cooked on her show, every single ingredient was already 
Chapter 3

38
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
measured and prepared, and all she had to do was reach for everything she 
needed, keeping the show running smoothly and allowing her to use her fan-
tastic wit and charm to quickly whip up a bit of this and a bit of that.
The three preceding examples illustrate that you must be prepared for what-
ever comes your way when you undertake any task. Patton never could know 
what his adversaries were going to do, but he had to be prepared to face and 
combat whatever it may be. Steve Jobs handled hiccups during his presenta-
tion with a cool head and his professionalism. Julia Child handled any and 
every issue that came about while making her show and during interviews 
with her usual humor and grace, just like I’m sure you’ll do when running  
into minor bumps on the road to home automation.
Considering Factors Before You Buy
Being prepared is the only way to avoid the monkey wrenches life likes to 
throw our way, and even when you’re prepared as best you can be, life will 
still find a crazy way to toss one more curve ball at you. This is especially 
true when it comes to home projects. Luckily, the home automation I discuss 
in Home Automation For Dummies doesn’t involve needing to wire a home 
while it’s being built from the ground up (although that’s easier than wiring 
after the house is built), so you don’t have to worry too much about con-
struction issues. However, there’s still a lot to think about.
Identifying your automation goals
It’s good to have goals in life, for sure, and a big part of preparation is defin-
ing those goals. What are your home automation goals? Only you can answer 
that question, but in the next sections, I provide you with a few things to 
think about to help you narrow them down.
A little at a time or all in
Are you planning to do everything at once or a bit at a time? I discuss this in 
depth later in this chapter, but you may want to begin thinking about it now.
Multiple manufacturers
Do you mind buying multiple products from multiple manufacturers? Some 
folks like to stay with the same brand (such as buying your computer, smart-
phone, and tablet from the same company), while others don’t mind mixing it 
up a bit. The best approach when it comes to home automation is to only buy 
products from one manufacturer. It may not be possible to do so, based on 

39

 Chapter 3: Determining Your Home Automation Needs (and Wants)
what you want to automate in your home, but if it is possible you’ll do well to 
heed my advice.
Definitely stick with one manufacturer when it comes to devices running the 
ZigBee protocol. ZigBee is a bit loose when it comes to making manufacturers 
stick to their standards, so there is a possibility of incompatibility if purchas-
ing from different makers.
Committed versus tinkering
Are you automating for novelty or functionality? Be honest with yourself: 
Do you really want to automate your home and simplify your life, or are you 
more into tinkering with the latest and greatest technology? This is important 
for you to determine because it will affect how you search for devices.
If you want to make your life better through home automation, then your 
search will certainly encompass the more practical devices, such as light-
ing controls, security devices, thermostats, and the like. An example of 
a practical device for someone who is serious about saving money and 
controlling her home’s temperature, but she doesn’t have central heat and 
air, is the Quirky Aros smart window air-conditioner, shown in Figure 3-1. 
The Aros can be controlled remotely via your smartphone or tablet using 
the Wink app, which you can download from the iOS or Android App Store. 
(See Chapter 4 for more on controlling the heat and air-conditioning in 
your home.)

40
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
If you’re a tinkerer, then you can afford to be more adventurous in your quest 
for home automation quirkiness. For example, how about a self-cleaning kitty 
litter box, like the Classic Self-Cleaning Litter Box from LitterMaid (shown in 
Figure 3-2)?
Or how about the Pivot Power Genius from Quirky (see Figure 3-3), which is a 
power strip unlike any you’ve used before: It bends at each outlet to accom-
modate differing plug sizes and to fit into odd spaces. Another cool feature is 
that you can control it, and by extension, the devices plugged into it, through 
the use of an app on your smartphone or tablet.
More than one key master
Will more than one person be controlling your devices? Most home automa-
tion devices can be controlled by more than one smartphone or tablet (or 
computer), but some can’t. If you plan to allow multiple people to have  
control over your home automation devices, be certain to verify with the 
manufacturers that they support this capability.
Most companies require you to create an account with them. These accounts 
allow you to log in to their systems and register your home automation 
devices with them. Once your device is registered with the account, you can 
then log into the account via an app on your smartphone or tablet, or from a 
web browser on your computer. Logging in to the account gives you control 
over your devices, whether you’re in the home or not. To allow more than 
one user to control your home automation devices remotely, you can use the 
account on each of their smart devices. Of course, each account user must 
know the username and password of each account.


 Chapter 3: Determining Your Home Automation Needs (and Wants)
Keep in mind, too, that although you may have more than one person who 
can control your devices, you will most likely want someone to be the pri-
mary user. Some manufacturers do allow this kind of control; be sure to 
check with them if this is an important feature for you.
As you can imagine, if you have several different devices from different manu-
facturers you’re going to end up with a ton of usernames and passwords. Be 
sure to jot down information about each account so you don’t forget it, and 
keep that info in a safe location.
One app to rule them all, or not
How much space do you have available on your iOS or Android device? Go 
ahead and check. I’ll wait.
Whistling . . . twiddling of thumbs . . .
Okay! How much do you have? Whatever the number, I just wanted you to 
have a look so that you would know exactly how much capacity you have. 
You see, once you wade into the home automation pool, you might drown in 
a sea of apps, and whatever storage space you may have had at the start of 
your home automation adventure will significantly decrease afterward.
Having made you aware of the space hit your smartphone and/or tablet will 
take, you should also know that there’s an alternative. First, ask yourself, 
“Self, do I mind multiple apps on my (insert type of smart device you have 
here) controlling my home automation stuff, or do I want to minimize the 
number of apps I’m tied to?” Only you can answer that to your satisfaction.

If you decided that having an app for each and every thing is okay, then keep 
on truckin’, partner. However, if you determined that having as few apps as 
necessary is a better idea, then you’ll be glad to know that minimizing the 
number of apps you have is actually easy to do. Several home automation 
companies develop solutions for you. Chapter 14 covers this subject in detail, 
but I wanted to give you a heads up here so that you wouldn’t sweat the 
“one app per device” horror. Understand, though, that most of the “one-app” 
solutions out there depend on another device to help keep the individual 
devices in line: a hub. This is not a bad thing at all. I just want you to be 
aware of that. Here are a few companies that offer a one-app solution for  
your home automation endeavors:


 Chapter 3: Determining Your Home Automation Needs (and Wants)
More and more solutions seem to pop up every day, so keep your eyes peeled 
for more app-only and app/hub solutions for your home automation needs. In 
my opinion, having one of these options beats the heck out of having to flip 
through your smartphone trying to find the app that controls your lights, and 
then flip to another app for your thermostat, then flip back to your lights to 
turn one on or off . . . what a hassle.
Assess your needs
Once you have a handle on how you want to go about managing your home 
automation devices, you need to figure out what your needs are before 
incorporating a home automation system into your abode. Following are 
several things to consider, and I’m sure that you’ll probably think of a few 
more yourself.
Your home’s size
What is the size of your home? This is a really important question when it 
comes to figuring out how many devices you’ll need to cover the bases in 
your home.
If you have a really large home, you’re going to need many more devices than 
someone with a smaller home. You’ll naturally have more needs:
✓
✓More lights to control
✓
✓Possibly multiple floors with multiple thermostats
✓
✓More area to cover, so you’ll need to make sure you have sufficient 
signal strength throughout your home for your Wi-Fi (if your home auto 
system uses Wi-Fi for its primary means of communication)
✓
✓More locks due to more doors
✓
✓More motion sensors and door sensors, if you’re beefing up security in 
your home automation system
There’s plenty more I don’t list here, but you get the drift.
Yard duty
Do you have a yard to care for? Do you plan on automating any of your lawn 
care? You know, you may say you enjoy cutting the grass, but why not let a 
robot do the job for you, like you see in Figure 3-5? (I devote all of Chapter 12 
to automating yard work.)

44
Part I: Introducing Home Automation 
Outlets and switches
Do you need extra outlets and switches installed? During the course of your 
home automation assessment, you may find that you want to place devices 
or your system’s hub in a location that doesn’t already have an outlet or a 
wall switch. If you do need them and know what you’re doing, by all means 
go for it. If, however, you are someone who asks your nephew to come over 
and plug up your new appliances, you most definitely will want to contact a 
professional electrician to handle the job.


 Chapter 3: Determining Your Home Automation Needs (and Wants)
Do you need to beef up your Wi-Fi network before you begin to install your 
home automation system? How can you tell?
Chapter 2 discusses network issues, but here are a few reminders:
✓
✓Most home automation systems use hubs that connect to your Wi-Fi 
router so that you can communicate with the system remotely. In many 
situations, your hub should be located centrally in the home so that 
its range extends to the point that it can communicate with as many 
devices as possible.
✓
✓Anything can block Wi-Fi signals, but some materials are much worse 
than others. Wood, plaster, glass, and cinder blocks aren’t too bad on 
your signal, but brick, concrete, ceramic and metal are deal breakers. You 
may need to strengthen your network signals using range extenders —  
or adding a second router in some cases.
✓
✓Does your current router support the networking standards your home 
automation system needs? You need to contact both the router manu-
facturer and the home automation system manufacturer to find out. 
Consulting their support websites should provide sufficient information, 
but if not, don’t hesitate to call them.
Existing home automation systems
Do you have an existing home automation system already installed? I know 
this sounds like a silly question, but the reality is that if you do already have 
a system in place, you want to make sure that any new devices you get will 
work with that system. That is, unless you plan on scrapping the old system 
totally in favor of something new.
Now, when I say that you want to make sure new devices work with your 
current system, I don’t mean that they necessarily have to be from the same 
manufacturer as that of the current system. I do mean, though, that they 
should mesh with the current system, or at least work independently of it. 
New devices also shouldn’t hinder the current system’s operation.
Current operating systems in use
What computers and smart devices do you currently have? Which operating 
system(s) does your new home automation stuff need to support?
These are definite considerations you need to make, in spite of the fact that 
most home automation devices today support both the iOS and Android 
operating systems for smartphones and tablets. You will find the occasional 
vendor that doesn’t support Android, but you’ll rarely find one that doesn’t 
support iOS. That is not a slam on Android devices, by the way — it’s just the 
truth of the matter.

On the flipside, you’ll find few vendors that support native apps for OS X, but 
several (although still relatively few) do support native applications for their 
products on Windows. Virtually no vendors support Linux, as shameful as 
that may be.
If a home automation vendor provides a web interface for you to interact 
with its devices (which most do), the operating system your computer runs 
bears little consequence. As long as you can open a web browser on your 
computer, you should have no problem accessing the web interface for your 
home automation device.
Chapter 13 has more information on using your smartphones, tablets, and 
computers with your home automation goodies.
Deciding How Much You Want  
to Automate
Before you can begin getting prepared, you need to understand what you’re 
preparing for. It’s decision time, folks: Exactly how much do you want to 
automate in your home?
Do you want to just start off with a simple smart outlet that controls what-
ever device you see fit to plug into it? Or are you ready to go whole hog into 
home automation, decking out every room of your home with every bit of 
home automation technology you can scrounge up?
Starting small
Starting small simply means you’re just getting your feet wet in home automa-
tion, not that you’re somehow not putting sufficient effort into it. If you’re at 
all hesitant about home automation, I suggest going the small route, anyway.
If you decide to start small, I recommend going a more universal route, rather 
than tying yourself to one specific automated task. An example would be 
starting with something like the WeMo Switch, seen in Figure 3-6. This device 
is simply an outlet that you can control with your smartphone or tablet using 
the WeMo app.
This kind of universal product enables you to see how home automation 
works at its most basic level, while pairing control with a simple, but  
powerful, app.

 Chapter 3: Determining Your Home Automation Needs (and Wants)
There are other smart outlets out there, and plenty of other devices of this 
general type, that will help you get an idea of what home automation can do 
for you.
Going LARGE
So, you’re thinking about just diving right in with both fins, eh? That’s what 
I’m talking about! Going for the gusto is how you roll.
In this scenario, I suggest you confine your home automation products to 
as few manufacturers as possible, such as going with INSTEON products 
throughout your home. The object of sticking with one manufacturer is to 
avoid any pitfalls that may occur due to incompatibility between products 
of various makers. Figure 3-7 shows the INSTEON Hub Home Automation 
Starter Kit (you can find it at www.smarthome.com/insteon-hub-home-
automation-starter-kit-premium.html), which contains everything 
you need to get going:
✓
✓One INSTEON Hub (allows you to control all your devices from a  
central one)
✓
✓Two remote control dimmer switches
✓
✓Two on/off modules
✓
✓Two LED bulbs
✓
✓Two wireless motion sensors

Other home automation companies provide starter kits of their own products, 
too, so find the kit that best suits what you’re looking for before committing to 
one. Other starter kits to consider:
✓
✓Iris Smart Kit: Search for it at www.lowes.com.
✓
✓SmartThings: Go to shop.smartthings.com and click the Kits tab to 
find several starter kits.

✓INSTEON: Visit http://www.insteon.com/retail-starter-kits.
html to check out its selection of starter kits.
Many others are available, too. Just search for home automation starter kit in 
your favorite search engine and investigate the results.
Read the Chapter 2 section on home automation protocols. It’s a good idea 
to find a protocol you like and stick to devices that run that protocol (as best 
you can, of course).

t’s a million degrees outside (literally, a million degrees!) and you’re on 
your way home after a ridiculously tough day at work. The AC in your 
car is on the fritz, and even with the windows rolled down it feels like you’re 
peering over the lip of a volcano’s crater. You can’t wait to get home, where 
you can finally kick up your feet and cool off. You unlock the door, open  
it just a crack, and a rush of steamy, scorching air greets you instead of  
the cool, polar breeze you were expecting. Your husband turned off the  
thermostat before he left for work, and now you have to come home to a 
boiler room!
On the flipside of that scenario, it’s a million degrees below zero outside  
(literally!) and you’re again on your way home. You know that once you pull 
in your driveway, you’ll only have a few seconds to dash from your car to the 
front door before your body is flash-frozen and you become a statue until  
the spring thaw. The thought of the warmth on the other side of your front 
door is what propels you from car to doorstep before the ice can begin to set 
on you. You unlock the door, bust open the front door, and are greeted by  
a wintry blast. Your husband (I’m picking on us guys because only we do 
these kinds of things) turned off the thermostat before he left the house  
this morning, leaving you to cope with subzero temperatures as you help  
the kids with homework.
Wouldn’t it be great if you could just whip out your smartphone on the way 
home and check the temperature in your home from ten miles away? You 
could then set the temp from your device so your home will be waiting to

cool you down or warm you up once you pull in the driveway. While that 
wasn’t an option a few years ago, the advent of the smartphone and the 
­proliferation of Wi-Fi has pushed us into the future, making such dreams  
a reality.
Controlling Your Thermostat from Afar
Temperature has long been a bone of contention in most households, as 
almost any couple can attest. One wants the temp at 85 in the winter and 55 
in the summer. The other loves a happy medium of 72 degrees all the time. 
One believes the air-conditioning or heating should be cranking at all hours 
of the day and night, while the other would rather melt or freeze, depending 
on the season. Today’s smart thermostats will benefit all involved, as you’ll 
discover in the remainder of this chapter.
How setting temps remotely benefits you
I know what some of you are saying: “What’s the big deal? Just set your 
­thermostat to a reasonable temperature and when you get home all is well.” 
To that I would refer you to the husband in the examples at the beginning  
of this chapter who can’t stomach the thought of the thermostat running  
all day when no one’s home. And what about those of us who don’t have 
­central heat and air?
The smart thermostats and other smart temperature devices on the market 
today will help ensure that when you need your heating or cooling on, you 
can take care of it with no problem from wherever you may be — provided 
you have an Internet connection of some kind. Let’s talk about some of the 
benefits of controlling your home’s temp smartly and remotely.
Saving money
Can you really save money with a smart thermostat? The answer may seem 
to be an obvious yes, but it actually depends a great deal on how you already 
control your home’s temp.
If your thermostat is the old manual kind where you slide a switch marked 
C or one marked H to a certain temperature marking, then the answer is an 
emphatic “yes!” Smart thermostats don’t require you to frequently bother 
with them to set your home’s temp, and they’re much more accurate when 
it comes to actually maintaining the temp you set. The smart thermostat will 
quickly pay for itself once you begin realizing the savings to your heating and 
cooling bills.

53

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
If you already own a standard programmable thermostat, then the answer 
may be “maybe.” If you’ve diligently programmed your thermostat to turn 
on and go off at certain times of the day, and you maintain a reasonable  
temperature setting in the home when the thermostat is running, then your 
money savings using a smart thermostat over a programmable one probably 
won’t be substantial (unless your programmable thermostat is faulty, of 
course). However, the capability to turn off your heating and cooling systems 
remotely could save you money if you aren’t concerned about maintaining  
a constant temp in the home. For example, if you forgot to turn off the 
­thermostat when you left your home, or if you later decide that you wish  
you had turned it off for the weekend instead of it running with its current 
programmed settings, you could easily handle the issue with a few taps on 
your smartphone. Money saved.
Another advantage of a smart thermostat over a programmable one is  
that many of the models give you real-time views of your energy usage, and 
provide other monitoring and reporting tools to keep you on top of your 
energy bills.
Saving time
Remotely controlling your smart thermostat, and simply employing a smart 
thermostat, will indeed save you time.
Sure, there’s the initial installation and setup, but that’s required of any 
­thermostat. After your smart thermostat is up and running, though, you 
rarely will have to make changes unless you simply want to. But here’s 
where the time saving comes in: You don’t have to be in front of your smart 
­thermostat to make those changes. There’s no need to panic in the airport 
because you forgot to turn the thermostat off; just do it on your smart-
phone. No need to waste time calling neighbors or family members so they 
can adjust your thermostat; just whip out your trusty smartphone and 
get it done. If your mother is in town visiting, you won’t need to give her 
­instructions on running the thermostat; you’ll be able to keep her warm and 
toasty from work using your smartphone. I could go on with example after 
example, but I think you get the drift by now.
The tech behind the thermostat
Thermostats have long been a staple in most households, but the technology 
has certainly improved over the decades.
Back in the day, the only thermostat one had at his or her disposal was what 
I call the “wake up and jerk back the covers test.” Thankfully, over the last 
century or so we’ve graduated beyond that to more sophisticated methods. 

54
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Mechanical thermostats have long used purely mechanical means (hence 
their name) to determine the temperature of a room:
✓
✓Wax pellets
✓
✓Bulbs filled with gas or air
✓
✓Bulbs filled with mercury
✓
✓Bimetallic strips
Since those devices of Stone Age days, today’s digital thermostats employ 
much more reliable electronic sensors to detect temperature with far greater 
accuracy. This increased accuracy can actually save you money in the long 
run by keeping temps in your home more consistent. These electronic ­sensors 
are also used by today’s smart thermostats, which account for their excellent 
performance.
Introducing the Big Players  
in the Thermostat Arena
The smart thermostat arena is getting crowded with technical gladiators all 
vying for the emperor’s attention (or yours, as the case may be). You now 
are going to explore the ever-expanding world of smart thermostats, visiting 
some of the well-known and not-so-well-known players in the market.
Honeywell
Some of you may be surprised that I’m not starting this section with Nest — 
considered to be the pioneer in smart thermostats. Instead, I thought we’d 
start off with the folks who gave us the iconic round thermostat (actually 
called “The Round”) so many of us grew up with. Honeywell makes more than 
thermostats, to be sure, but the company will forever be synonymous with 
those little round gadgets.
Honeywell has certainly not been sitting idly by in this new age of smart 
doodads. They very much have their game on regarding this new phase of 
keeping up with room temps, as is evidenced by their newest little round 
thermostat, the Lyric.
While Honeywell has produced Wi-Fi–capable and digital/smart thermostats 
for a while now, Lyric, shown in Figure 4-1, is its first real dive into the new 

55

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
world of thermostats controlled by smart devices. Honeywell gets that many 
folks today are just as comfortable controlling their home technologies 
remotely from their smartphones as they are standing in front of the control 
itself: Thus, Lyric was born.
Lyric is designed to replace your current thermostat. In fact, Honeywell 
claims that 97 percent of existing thermostats can be replaced with the  
Lyric with little effort (in other words, complete rewiring not required). 
Another plus is that no power wire is needed for Lyric, so that’s one  
less thing.
To be sure about Lyric’s compatibility with your current wiring, your  
network, and your smart device, visit http://lyric.honeywell.com/
get-started/ and check out the great information provided by Honeywell. 
It does a great job of making you aware of whether the Lyric will truly be a 
good fit for you and your home.
Lyric installation
When you first get your Lyric and open the box, you might be surprised  
at how little information is actually contained therein. That’s because 
installation instructions don’t come in the box, but are instead part of  
the Lyric app (for iOS and Android devices), which is necessary to use 
your Lyric anyway. It’s a good idea to go ahead and download the Lyric 
app from the iOS or Android App Stores before you get too far along  
with installation.

56
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Honeywell claims you need a remarkably short list of tools to install your Lyric:
✓
✓Philips screwdriver
✓
✓Ballpoint pen
✓
✓Pencil
✓
✓Lyric app
✓
✓Your Wi-Fi password
That’s a short list! However, if you’re like me, your current thermostat has 
had so many coats of paint applied around its wall plate over the years that 
you’ll also need a hammer and chisel to remove it from the wall.
Once you’ve downloaded the Lyric app, create an account with Honeywell  
by following the on-screen instructions. Once you’re done, tap Install on the 
app (see Figure 4-2) and just follow along step by step until the job’s complete. 
There are also instructions on the http://lyric.honeywell.com/ 
get-started/ website, including some helpful videos. Of course, Honeywell 
has folks standing at the ready to help you with your installation questions, 
too: Just visit the aforementioned website and scroll to the bottom of the 
page to see all the ways you can contact the support team.
Setting up and using your Lyric
After you install the Lyric, you need to connect it to your smartphone or 
tablet and configure it for day-to-day use.
To connect and configure your Lyric:
1.	Connect your smart device to the Lyric network.
	
	Find the Lyric’s network using your iOS or Android device’s network 
connection settings.
2.	Lyric will walk you through several questions regarding your heat-
ing and cooling system, your desired temperatures for when you are 
home or away, and more.
3.	Connect the Lyric to your home’s Wi-Fi network using the options 
within the app.
	
	Be sure to have your network password on hand. Patience is recom-
mended during this process; it may take a few minutes for the Lyric to 
connect to your network and sync with Honeywell’s servers.
4.	Register your thermostat with Honeywell, which ties the device to the 
account you created when you first installed and opened the Lyric app.

57

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
Your Lyric is now ready to roll! Now all you have to do is sit back and relax  
as your Lyric controls the temperature in your home, whether you’re  
there or not.
A great feature of Lyric is its Geofencing feature, which allows the Lyric to 
adjust the temperature in your home based on your proximity to it. If you’re 
away from home, Lyric will know it because it’s tracking your smart device’s 
location. At that time, Lyric will heat or cool your home depending on the 
temperature presets you make on it. When the Lyric detects that you’re 
within a certain distance from your home (again, this distance is something 
you preset), it will then begin cooling or heating your home to your  
specifications.
While I would consider the Lyric to be Honeywell’s best competitor in this field, 
the company does have a range of other Wi-Fi–compatible thermostats that 
you can control via your smart device. Visit http://wifithermostat.com/ 
for more information about those devices. You can also get more ­information 
on Lyric by going to http://lyric.honeywell.com.

Nest
Onward to Nest!
Nest is the best-known self-learning programmable thermostat that you can 
control via your smart device. When the Nest thermostat (owned by Nest 
Labs, by the way) was introduced in 2011, it was an instant hit. Today, the 
company that started in 2010 has boomed into a bona fide big boy in the 
home automation market (especially now that Google has bought Nest  
Labs for a few jillion dollars).
The Nest Learning Thermostat, shown in Figure 4-3, can actually learn how 
you like your temperature to be set at various times of the day, including  
whether you are home or away. This cool gadget does everything a conven-
tional thermostat can do, only better. And you can also control it remotely 
via your iOS or Android device; let’s not forget that little nugget.
A user directly interacts with the Nest Learning Thermostat via its control 
wheel, which can be spun and tapped to access heating and cooling con-
trols, make device settings, set schedules, and more. And since the Nest is 
connected to the Internet, Nest can push software upgrades to your device 
­automatically, keeping you up-to-date without so much as lifting a finger.
Installing your Nest
Before you get all giddy on me and rush out to purchase a Nest, I recommend 
that you visit https://widgets.nest.com/compatibility/ to make 
sure your current heating and cooling systems will work with the device.

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
Once you have your Nest in hand, installing it is much like installing other 
thermostats:
1.	Remove the old thermostat.
	
	Be sure to first take a picture of the wires while still connected to the 
old thermostat so you’ll know where to connect them to your Nest (or 
where to reconnect them to the old thermostat should you run into an 
issue with the Nest).
2.	Install the base for your Nest Learning Thermostat.
	
	Nest provides a level built into the base itself to make sure it’s properly 
leveled before attaching the base to your wall.
3.	Connect the wires as instructed for your wiring setup.
4.	Connect the display to the base.
	
	Just push the display onto the base until it clicks.
By the way, if you have problems when installing your Nest, or if you would 
simply like to have a professional install your Nest for you, go to https://
nest.com/thermostat/installation/ to find a local Nest guru.
Nest features
Nest is loaded with features that you’re going to love. I mention a few of them 
here for you, but to get the full understanding of just how good the Nest 
Learning Thermostat is, check it out at the aforementioned website.
Nest includes these features:
✓
✓The Nest programs itself in about a week, based on your preferences 
and input.
✓
✓Auto-Away automatically turns off heating and cooling when you’re away 
from home.
✓
✓Nest can learn how long it takes to heat or cool your home, and it will 
even display the time it takes to do so.
✓
✓While you can indeed control your Nest directly, you will love the Nest apps 
for your iOS and Android devices. The app helps you make adjustments to 
your thermostat and also view energy statistics for your home (illustrated 
in Figure 4-4). You can even control your Nest from your computer.
✓
✓The Nest Learning Thermostat uses sensors and Internet information to 
help keep you comfortable:
•	Temperature sensors detect how warm or cool your home is (as if 
I needed to tell you that!).

60
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
•	Humidity sensors help you see the humidity in your home.
•	Activity sensors detect when someone is in the home. When Nest 
detects that no one is present, it will activate its Auto-Away mode.
•	Nest gets weather information from your home’s network, so it’s 
able to learn how weather conditions outside affect the temperature 
inside your home, and make adjustments accordingly.
✓
✓A single Nest Account, which you create when setting up your Nest, can 
control up to ten thermostats.
There’s so much more to know about the Nest Learning Thermostat that 
I simply cannot go into within the pages of this tome. I highly encourage you 
to check out everything Nest at www.nest.com to find out all the ways Nest 
can help keep your home comfy and cozy.
When you see Nest’s famous Leaf logo on the thermostat’s display, it means 
that you’re currently saving energy. It’s Nest’s way of giving you a virtual pat 
on the back for saving energy and to give you a heads up on times that your 
wallet should feel a little heavier.

Belkin
You now have the scoop on two of the best thermostats around, but what  
if you’re someone who doesn’t have a thermostat? What if your preferred  
(or not) methods of heating and cooling your home are through electric  
heaters and window unit air-conditioners that don’t use thermostats to make 
everything all nice and automatic? Don’t worry, folks, Belkin’s got your back!
Belkin has come up with an ingenious little device called the WeMo Switch, 
which is part of the broader WeMo line of awesome products. Here, I focus 
on the switch (see Figure 4-5) because it will help you control your non-­
Internet-friendly devices remotely.
The WeMo Switch (I call it the switch from here on) plugs into any standard 
120-volt outlet. You can then connect any electrical device to the switch and 
control it from anywhere you have an Internet connection. What a cool idea!
When I say any electrical device (up to 120 volts, that is), I do mean it: From 
irons to televisions to heaters, you can turn them on or off, and even monitor 
their usage, using the free WeMo app for iOS or Android devices. If it can plug 
into an outlet, it can plug into your switch, and as long as your Wi-Fi is up and 
running, you have full control wherever you happen to be.
Here’s how simple it is to get your switch up and running with your smartphone 
or tablet and your network:
1.	Plug your switch into any outlet, and then plug the electrical device it 
will be controlling into it.
2.	Download the WeMo app on your smart device.
3.	Go to your network settings on your smart device and connect to the 
WeMo network.
4.	Open the WeMo app on your smart device and select your home’s  
Wi-Fi network (enter the password, if necessary).
	
	This connects your switch to your home’s network.
5.	Give your Switch a descriptive name so you know which electrical 
device it controls in your home (for example, Heater in My Room or 
Living Room AC), select an icon for the switch to use, and tap Done.
	
	Your switch will appear in your list of controlled electrical devices.
6.	Tap the power switch button next to your electrical device in the list 
to turn it on or off.
	
	Green indicates the device is on, as illustrated in Figure 4-6.

That’s all there is to it! You can now turn your electric heater or your  
AC unit on or off remotely without any other devices. I implore you to visit  
www.wemothat.com to see the entire lineup of WeMo devices, access  
WeMo support, and more.
WeMo devices can utilize the IFTTT (If This Then That) service to automate 
tasks with your Switch. IFTTT connects your devices to each other and to 
other websites to make things work together using “recipes.” For example, 
you could connect your switch to the IFTTT Weather Channel so that it is 
alerted when the sun sets, and your switch can automatically turn on a hall 
light that’s connected to it. For more information on what IFTTT is and how 
to use it with your WeMo Switch, check out www.belkin.com/us/support-

ecobee
Stuart Lombard and his company, ecobee, introduced the world to smart 
thermostats in 2007. Ever since, it has become one of the companies to watch 
in today’s home automation market, but its market share has dwindled over 
the last few years because of its competitor, Nest. However, with the intro-
duction of the ecobee3, ecobee has ratcheted up its offerings to compete 
with Nest. To be honest, it is more than an answer: The ecobee3, shown in 
Figure 4-7, is a veritable shout from the rooftops!
Figure 4-7: 
The sleek 
new 
ecobee3 
does its job 
well.

64
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
The ecobee3 takes the concept of thermostats like the Nest and Honeywell’s 
Lyric to the next level. Don’t get me wrong: Those are great devices, as are 
those I’ve yet to discuss, but in my humble opinion, the ecobee3 goes one 
level better because of its remote sensors, which I touch on in a bit.
Like its competitors, the ecobee3 is a learning thermostat and is compatible 
with the heating and cooling systems in most houses. Go to www.ecobee.
com/compatibility/ to walk through a couple of simple steps to find out if 
your system is compatible.
Installation and setup
Installation of the ecobee3 is very much like the other smart thermostats:
1.	Remove the old thermostat, making sure to label the wires.
	
	Better yet, take a picture of the wiring before you remove the thermostat.
2.	Insert the wires into the ecobee3 base according to the appropriately 
marked terminals.
3.	Snap the faceplate onto the base and you’re ready for action.
Of course, things may need to be adjusted for whatever wiring you may  
have in your walls, and ecobee has you covered with much more detailed 
installation instructions should they be warranted.
Once you power on your ecobee3, you should be greeted by the ecobee “bee” 
logo, which is a good sign. If you don’t see the bee, the wire ­connections  
may have issues.
If the wires behind your thermostat are connected to a high-voltage system, 
your system won’t be compatible with ecobee3 (or the Nest or Lyric, for 
that matter). You can easily tell if your system is high-voltage by looking for 
a sticker somewhere on or inside it that indicates it’s 110 volts or higher. 
Another simple way to tell is if the wires are tied together with wire nuts, 
which look like plastic caps. If so, again, the system won’t be compatible.
The ecobee3 walks you through the process, making sure it has detected 
your wiring correctly, helps you set up other devices you may have con-
nected (such as a humidifier), and learns what equipment your system uses.
The touchscreen on the ecobee3’s front panel is great; it looks and feels 
like the touchscreen on your smartphone or tablet. The screen is clean and 
simple to understand, as well, so you won’t be searching all over the place 
or pushing knobs or rings to find the settings you need. What makes it even 
better is that the interface on the thermostat is almost identical to the inter-
face of the ecobee3 app (see Figure 4-8), so no matter which interface you’re 
using, you still know how to get around.

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
The interface is simple, yet fully functional:
✓
✓The current temp is seen in the middle.
✓
✓An icon above the current temp shows whether the system is heating or 
cooling.
✓
✓The slider on the right side can be adjusted by tapping and scrolling up 
or down on the touchscreen.
✓
✓Tap the menu in the lower left of the screen to see the full menu. Some 
items on the thermostat menu pertain to the actual hardware itself and 
don’t appear in the menu of the app, for good reason.
✓
✓Tap the cloud icon at the lower middle to see current weather in your 
area, including a forecast.
✓
✓Tap the Quick Changes button in the lower right (it looks like a gear) to 
make fast settings changes, such as instantly putting the thermostat into 
Home or Away mode.

The ecobee3 also has a web interface that you can use to control your 
­thermostat. All you need to use it is a web browser and an Internet ­connection, 
and you’re golden. The web interface is not identical to the thermostat and 
app interface, but it really can’t be since the user interacts with it in such 
a different manner. Regardless of that, it’s still a nice interface and does 
­everything you need it to.
ecobee3’s remote sensors
What sets the ecobee3 apart from its competitors is its implementation of 
remote sensors, which you can see in Figure 4-9.
These sensors can be placed anywhere in the house, and you can use up to 
32 of the little fellows. These sensors are used by the ecobee3 to determine 
the temp in other rooms so that it can make adjustments to make the house 
as comfortable as possible for all involved. The sensors not only detect  
temperature, but they also detect when a room is occupied. Here’s how  
the sensors work with the thermostat:
You’re in the living room and your spouse is in the kitchen. Each room 
has a remote sensor, and the thermostat is in the hall. The thermostat is 
set to 72 degrees. Problem is that the living room is typically a bit cooler 
than in the hall, but the kitchen is characteristically warmer than both 
areas. The ecobee3 senses the differences in room temps and that both the 
kitchen and living room are occupied, so it takes an average of the temps 
and works to make sure that both rooms are as close as they can be to the 
desired whole-house temperature you’ve set. Your spouse then leaves the

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
kitchen to join you in the living room, leaving the kitchen unoccupied. The 
sensor in the kitchen detects that the person has left and reports it to the 
­thermostat. The thermostat then makes adjustments to how it cools or 
warms the house based on no longer needing to concentrate so much on 
the typically warmer kitchen. Nifty, huh?
Visit www.ecobee.com to see the ecobee3, as well as the company’s other 
fine thermostats for both home and office. You can also purchase more 
remote sensors on the site. It’s worth a view just for ecobee’s claim to save 
up to 23 percent on your energy bills, don’t you think?
Lennox
Until now, you haven’t read about any of the major HVAC hardware manu-
facturers. However, Lennox has a really great smart thermostat itself, called 
iComfort.
iComfort, shown in Figure 4-10, is a touchscreen unit like the ecobee3, but the 
interface is much different. The touchscreen is wider than the ecobee3, and 
looks almost like an iPad mini or similar tablet.

iComfort features
iComfort is packed full of features:
✓
✓Remotely control your home’s temperature using the iComfort app for 
iOS or Android (see Figure 4-11), or log onto www.myicomfort.com and 
make settings adjustments via the web.
✓
✓One-Touch Away mode puts your system into a deep sleep, so no energy 
is needlessly spent heating or cooling your home while you aren’t there.
✓
✓The touchscreen interface works very much like your iOS or Android 
device.
✓
✓Weather-on-Demand gives you a five-day forecast right on the thermostat.
✓
✓Whenever there’s a problem, your iComfort will alert you via email, 
text, or through your mobile app. It can even contact your local Lennox 
dealer directly if you allow it to.

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
While Lennox would prefer you only use its thermostat with its HVAC units, 
have no fear that your non-Lennox system won’t work with the iComfort. 
Lennox does say that you’ll have a better experience with the overall system 
if you use only its premium products, but I leave that decision up to you, dear 
reader.
Don’t think the default look of the Lennox will do it for you? Rest easy, 
gentle reader, Lennox has your back. Nuvango covers are available for 
your ­iComfort, and they give you the customizable look you want. The 
Nuvango covers fit around the outside edges of your iComfort and meet 
at the edges of your touchscreen. When the screen saver kicks in on the 
iComfort, it matches the pattern of your edge cover, as illustrated in 
Figure 4-12.
iComfort installation
I have to say that to me there is one major chink in the armor of the iComfort, 
and that’s its installation. Actually, it’s the fact that Lennox doesn’t give you 
the option to install it yourself; the iComfort is installable only by a Lennox 
dealer. Even if you just want to check compatibility of your current HVAC 
units with iComfort, Lennox still pushes you to a dealer.
Don’t get me wrong; I understand that the iComfort is Lennox’s baby and the 
company wants to be sure installation is done right, but I still think it should 
offer the option to do-it-yourselfers who have the know-how to get the job 
done themselves.

iHarmony zoning
I just finished giving Lennox a bit of a hard time for the dealer-only installation, 
but I’m about to balance that with a hearty pat on the back for its iHarmony 
Zoning System.
The iHarmony Zoning System is a great option for your home’s HVAC 
system that allows you to heat or cool specific rooms or areas of your 
home by zoning off certain areas with their own thermostats, shown in 
Figure 4-13. These separate thermostats enable you to set custom temps 
for zoned areas: That’s right, these areas are heated or cooled strictly to 
your specifications.
iHarmony works in conjunction with your iComfort thermostat. Whenever you 
make a settings change to one of the iHarmony thermostats, zone dampers 
(which are basically flaps or valves) in your HVAC system’s ductwork open or 
close as needed to direct airflow to precisely the room that needs it. It’s a nice 
feature that certainly ups the Awesome Factor for the iComfort system.
Lennox has offered a great home automation product in the iComfort system. 
Check out www.lennox.com/icomfortwifi/ to read about all the specs.
Trane
Trane is another hardware manufacturer that is offering its own version of a 
smart thermostat, the ComfortLink II XL950 (see Figure 4-14).

71

 Chapter 4: Keeping Your Cool or Turning Up the Heat
Trane’s ComfortLink (that’s what I call it from now on to keep from getting 
too tongue-tied) system touts itself as not just a thermostat, but an “energy 
command center.”
This is not a slam of the ComfortLink system when I say that it does pretty 
much what the Lennox iComfort does — the difference being (of course) that 
it’s built primarily for Trane by Trane. If you already have Trane equipment 
and are pleased with it, it makes sense to stay with a brand you’re familiar 
with. Having said that, the ComfortLink works with any HVAC brand.
Check out www.trane.com/residential/en/products/thermostats-
and-controls/connected-controls/comfortlink_ii.html for more 
information on the base system itself.
Third-party apps and self-installation blues
As with other devices of its kind, there’s an app for the ComfortLink. 
However, this app is developed by Nexia, which is a home automation 
company that develops apps for several other companies. The Nexia Home 
Intelligence app, seen in Figure 4-15, can handle all sorts of home automation 
tasks, and controlling your Trane smart thermostat is one of them.
I have to say, it’s a bit off-putting to have one company’s app control another 
company’s thermostat, but hey — that’s just my opinion. If you’re someone 
who’s used to using Nexia’s app for controlling home automation devices,

then this will probably not be a deal breaker for you, but if you aren’t famil-
iar with Nexia, this might be a strong factor when considering the Trane 
ComfortLink thermostat for your home’s heating and cooling needs. Again, 
that’s just my two pence.
One more thing that kind of gets my goat is that Trane also wants installation 
of your ComfortLink system to be performed by a dealer only. Again, I under-
stand the company wants this work for its dealers, but it seems there should 
be a user-installable option to go along with the dealer-installable one.
ComfortLink zoning
One big plus for the ComfortLink system is the inclusion of zoning. Like 
Lennox, Trane provides all the hardware for a system, ensuring that every-
thing works together seamlessly.
Zoning allows your Trane HVAC system to direct heating and cooling to 
­specific rooms in specific amounts, effectively reducing your energy costs 
over the long haul. Like the Lennox zoning features, dampers inside your air

leaning house is simply the most fun one can have on a daily basis. 
I don’t know anyone who would rather be at the beach or taking a 
Caribbean cruise when he or she could be cleaning windows or vacuuming 
the floor. There’s simply no comparison: laundry detergent over tanning 
lotion any day of the week, right?
Oh, who am I kidding? The previous paragraph was aimed more at impress-
ing my mom than expressing the actual disdain of most folks for breaking 
their backs cleaning the house every evening after a long day at the office. 
Truth be told, if we could just close our eyes and twitch our noses to make  
all the trash go away, we’d all be quite pleased.
Let’s step out of fantasyland for a moment. There’s always washing of some 
kind to be done, trash of some kind to be tossed out, items of some kind  
to be put away, flooring surfaces of some kind to be cleaned, and glass of 
every kind that needs wiping. And if you have children, multiply those tasks 
exponentially!
Let’s step back into fantasyland again. Wouldn’t it be awesome if some  
(or even better, all) of your everyday cleaning needs could be taken care of 
automatically? Instead of pushing a vacuum all over your apartment, why not 
catch up on your reading or do some Netflix binge watching while the carpet 
is cleaned without your having to lift a finger? What if your aquarium could 
be cleaned by a robot and you didn’t even have to hand it the Windex? Did I 
say, “Let’s step back into fantasyland?” This is no fantasy, folks — indeed, it’s 
a reality!

Cleaning Up While You’re Away
We are truly stepping into the future that we, and even our parents, all 
dreamed about as kids when we begin automating typical household chores. 
George Jetson and family can’t be more than a couple of generations away, 
I’m thinking. Let’s talk about the benefits of automating your daily chores and 
which ones can be automated today.
Keeping clean while on the go
Some of you may be thinking that this is the biggest no-brainer chapter head-
ing in Home Automation For Dummies, but I might have come up with a ben-
efit or two you haven’t considered. Please bear with the more obvious points 
in this list:
✓
✓The job gets done, even if you don’t feel like it because of illness, your 
crazy-busy schedule, or what-have-you.
✓
✓Saving time is certainly a huge benefit, and may be the top “duh” com-
ment in this short list. There are simply too many ways in which these 
devices can save you time to mention here, but I bet you can think of a 
million of them on your own.
✓
✓People who suffer from a disability can use automated cleaning devices 
to clean their homes with little effort on their part. They’ll also save 
money by not having to employ other folks to do the jobs for them.
Automating cleaning chores
Myriad cleaning chores can be automated these days. The following list is a 
good one, but by no means do I claim it to be an exhaustive one:
✓
✓Dust mopping
✓
✓Damp mopping
✓
✓Vacuuming
✓
✓Floor scrubbing
✓
✓Cleaning your grill
✓
✓Removing muck from your aquarium

77

 Chapter 5: Nice and Tidy Does It!
Many more cleaning chores can be automated, but we would be here all day 
listing and reading them. In Chapter 17, I discuss ten others that are done 
less frequently than on a daily basis.
Understanding how it all works
Unfortunately, most of the automated home cleaning products don’t allow 
for control via smartphones, tablets, or computers. The majority of them are 
devices that you set into motion and they complete tasks for you. While this 
isn’t the ultimate ideal, it’s certainly better in many respects than doing it all 
yourself. The technology behind each device basically includes some sort of 
wheels or treads for locomotion, sensors to prevent bumping into things, and 
some form of cleaning apparatus (sucking, scrubbing, wiping, and so forth).
While the upcoming product recommendations are extremely helpful and 
time-saving, keep in mind that nothing replaces good old-fashioned elbow 
grease. Still, you may find that you tackle cleaning chores more often if all 
you have to do is push a button!
Introducing a Who’s Who of the 
Remote Cleaning World
Computers and smartphones have Apple, automobiles have General Motors, 
kitchens have Betty Crocker, dolls have Barbie, and home-automated clean-
ing has the following list of companies and their products that are fast 
becoming its icons.
iRobot
iRobot has been in the automated home cleaning business for more than a 
decade, and it is the creator of the famous Roomba, the world’s first auto-
mated vacuum.
The Roomba (shown in Figure 5-1) was, and still is, a runaway success, and as 
a result, iRobot (www.irobot.com) has blossomed into much more than just 
a vacuum company. Boasting of several products for home use, iRobot also 
develops products for the defense and security sectors (they’re pretty cool 
devices; check them out on iRobot’s website if you’re interested).

78
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
From this point forward I mention different flooring types that can be cleaned 
by the devices in this chapter. But before making any purchase — and cer-
tainly before turning any of these devices loose in your home — check with 
the manufacturer to make absolutely certain that your flooring is supported 
for use with its device. This is in no way meant to deter you from using these 
devices; I just want you to be certain that the flooring in your home is pro-
tected from possible damage.
Roomba
More than 10 million units have sold since its introduction to the market; 
that’s a bunch of robotic vacuums!
The basic idea behind the Roomba is to let it do the vacuuming while you do 
something else: That’s it. The neater features of a Roomba include:
✓
✓Press the Clean button on the top of the Roomba unit and it begins 
cleaning, not stopping until either the job is complete or it needs a  
battery charge.
✓
✓Roomba automatically returns to the charging station once a job is  
finished or its battery is too low.
✓
✓The unit is smart and knows where to go. Roomba won’t fall down stairs 
and can detect walls, furniture, and other items that it should go around.

daddy of

vacuums.

79

 Chapter 5: Nice and Tidy Does It!
✓
✓An indicator light on the top of the unit alerts you when the dust bin is 
near full.
✓
✓You can program a daily schedule for Roomba so that you’re not having 
to push the Clean button every time you want Roomba to get on the job.
✓
✓Roomba doesn’t just have to do an entire room or area; it’s also great for 
spot cleaning.
Roomba is currently offered in one of three series (600, 700, and 800), and its 
features grow as the series number grows. The 600 series includes the most 
basic models, the 700 models are a step above, and the 800 series are the 
crème de la crème of robotic vacuuming. You can learn more about Roomba, 
its features, and the models offered by visiting www.irobot.com/us/
learn/home/roomba.aspx.
iRobot offers a product it calls the Virtual Wall that prevents your Roomba 
from venturing where you don’t want it to. The Virtual Wall emits an infrared 
beam that the Roomba detects; when it sees the beam, Roomba will turn 
around, as if it has run into a real wall or obstacle. iRobot offers a “smart” 
version of the Virtual Wall called the Virtual Wall Lighthouse. The Lighthouse 
will keep Roomba in one room until the job is finished, and then allow it to 
move on to other rooms. Check with iRobot to see which versions of the 
Roomba will work with the Virtual Wall Lighthouse.
Scooba
Scooba is much like its cousin, Roomba, in that it cleans your floors auto-
matically. These two cousins can even use the same charging stations and 
accessories, such as a Virtual Wall (discussed in the preceding section). The 
difference is that Roomba is meant for vacuuming dust and debris, while 
Scooba (shown in Figure 5-2) is meant to scrub the muck and grime from your 
hard floors. (See the following list of the kinds of floors that Scooba works on.)
Scooba does use water (or iRobot’s special cleaning solution for hard floors) 
to scrub your floors automatically. That said, be careful when walking on 
slick, wet floors while the Scooba is cleaning.
Scooba’s fluid tank is super-easy to fill with either water or a cleaning solu-
tion formulated for hard floor surfaces. Here’s how Scooba gets the job done:
✓
✓First, Scooba gives your floor a quick sweep to remove any loose debris, 
and then gives the floor a presoak to help loosen any stuck-on gunk.  
(I hope I’m not getting too technical.)
✓
✓Second, the unit scrubs (and I mean scrubs) your floor with a brush that 
spins at over 600 RPM! After the scrubbing, Scooba’s squeegee vacuum 
sucks up any dirt, debris, and leftover water.

80
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
✓
✓Finally, Scooba gives your floor another once-over with the squeegee to 
be sure that everything possible has been cleaned from the floor.
According to iRobot, this process helps Scooba to remove up to 99.3 percent 
of household bacteria — and it can run either a 40-minute or a 20-minute cycle. 
Your Scooba will also be able to clean most hard floor surfaces, including:
✓
✓Linoleum
✓
✓Tile
✓
✓Slate
✓
✓Sealed hardwoods
✓
✓Stone
✓
✓Marble

learn/home/scooba.aspx.
iRobot sells the DryDock Charging and Drying Stand as an accessory for your 
Scooba. The advantages to this stand over the basic power adapter/charger 
is that it will dry your Scooba, preventing bacteria buildup, and it also pro-
vides a compact storage area.

Braava
Have you gotten the impression that the folks at iRobot like clean floors?  
So far, you have the Roomba for vacuuming, and the Scooba for removing 
stuck-on gunk you often find on hard floors. Next up: Braava.
Braava, shown in Figure 5-3, is your hard floor’s mopping buddy, and it does 
the everyday mopping chores that tend to break your back. The Braava won’t 
even break a sweat. Bravo for Braava!
Braava can mop your floors using either a dry or damp cloth:
✓
✓When using a dry cloth, Braava moves around the room in a straight 
path to simply sweep up dust and debris.
✓
✓When in damp-cloth mode, Braava moves in small back-and-forth 
motions, which helps it to better clean the surface of the floor.
Braava uses what amounts to a customized GPS system to navigate your 
rooms. iRobot developed the NorthStar Navigation System (housed in their 
NorthStar Navigation Cubes, one of which comes with your Braava), which 
bounces a signal off your ceiling, and the signal is then received by the Braava. 
This helps the Braava to map the room, and even know and remember its loca-
tion within it. If you have to stop your Braava to change cleaning pads, you can 
just set Braava back down on the floor and it will remember where it left off in 
the room. That is both cool and a little scary that a mop is so doggone smart.
You can purchase multiple NorthStar Navigation Cubes, which will extend 
the cleaning range of your Braava.

LG
Most everyone recognizes LG, a company that has its proverbial fingers  
in all the technology pots, from cellphones to refrigerators. For the topic 
of this book, however, take a quick look at how LG can help you do  
your laundry.
LG’s line of Smart ThinQ appliances brings the Internet into devices that at 
one time had no interaction with anything or anyone unless he was standing 
directly in front of the unit. However, Smart ThinQ appliances, which run the 
gamut from refrigerators to ranges to laundry devices, can use the Internet to 
update their software and to allow communication with their owners. Smart 
ThinQ technology allows the following interactions:
✓
✓Your washer and dryer can download new and improved wash and dry 
cycles from LG, as well as any other software updates, through your 
home’s Wi-Fi. And did I mention for free?
✓
✓The washer and dryer can notify you when cycles begin, finish, or are 
interrupted.
✓
✓The LG Smart Laundry app, shown in Figure 5-4, allows you to monitor 
and control washer and dryer cycles no matter where you are. You can 
also use it to download the aforementioned wash and dry cycles and 
software updates.
For more information on LG’s line of Smart ThinQ washers and dryers, visit 
www.lg.com/us/discover/smartthinq/laundry.jsp. And if cooking is 
(or is not) your thing, check out Chapter 8, where I discuss LG Smart ThinQ 
kitchen appliances.
RoboMop
You’ve seen some pretty high-tech devices up to this point in the chapter, 
and there are more to come. However, I thought I’d change the pace just a 
tad and move to a decidedly low-tech automated home cleaning solution: the 
RoboMop.

83

 Chapter 5: Nice and Tidy Does It!
RoboMop has one function in life: to keep your hard floor surfaces clean 
from dust and small debris. But that’s not the low-tech part I’m speaking of. 
You’ll have to get a load of RoboMop’s ultra-simplistic design, on display in 
Figure 5-5, to appreciate just how low-tech I’m going.

much to 
RoboMop, 
but it gets 
its simple 
job done.

84
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
RoboMop isn’t designed to look cool or feel like it will last for decades. It’s 
made for chasing those rabid dust bunnies while remaining extremely afford-
able. RoboMop uses a robotic (I use the term loosely) ball placed inside a 
plastic frame that holds a cleaning pad. Here are the steps to follow to get 
RoboMop embarking on its dust-bunny sentry duty:
1.	Charge the ball for three hours.
2.	Secure the cleaning pad to the bottom of the plastic frame and place it 
on the floor.
3.	Use the ball’s built-in timer to select how long you want RoboMop to 
clean.
4.	Place the ball in the top opening of the frame, and away it goes.
	RoboMop will run for the selected amount of time, hopefully having 
completely eradicated your dust bunny problem.
In spite of how neat an idea and inexpensive RoboMop is, it isn’t just some-
thing for which you can run down to the local store and grab off the shelf. 
However, you can order RoboMop through several online retailers, including 
Amazon. You can also view a short video about how to use RoboMop at the 
company’s website, www.robomop.com.
And just in case you’re wondering, no, the RoboMop is not accompanied by 
an iOS or Android app.
Neato Robotics
Before you even know about its products, you’ve gotta love its name: Neato 
Robotics. Any kid growing up in the 1970s and 1980s who was a sci-fi aficio-
nado or computer geek has used the word “neato” to describe cool technol-
ogy at one point or another. The fact that someone incorporated it into a 
company name just makes sense.
Neato Robotics does what its name implies: It makes neato robots. However, 
its robots have simple missions in life: to keep your hard floors and carpets 
clean, clean, clean. Neato Robotics is also not an iRobot clone; while the 
robotic vacuums may resemble those of iRobot in the fact that they’re small 
and can automatically go back to their charging stations when they need 
more juice in the batteries, they do have significant differences:
✓
✓Neato Robotics’ vacuums use a flat edge on the front of their robots, 
making for a wider brush. That, of course, means it covers more ground.
✓
✓Neato uses lasers to scan and map the room it’s cleaning (the technology 
is called BotVision), and develops a plan to tackle the job. As the com-
pany points out on its website, its robots aren’t “just bumping around.”

 Chapter 5: Nice and Tidy Does It!
✓
✓Neato supplies you with Boundary Markers — magnetic strips that you 
can place on your floor to make a boundary that the Neato ’bots won’t 
cross over. You can cut the Boundary Markers to fit your doorways and 
other areas that may need a custom fit.
✓
✓Neato believes in the “bigger is better” approach to some things. The large 
dirt bin, extra-large filters, and wider brushes attest to that philosophy.
Neato has two lines of vacuuming robots: the BotVac series and the XV 
series. The BotVac series (one of which is shown in Figure 5-6) includes 
higher-end machines with wider brushes, and are therefore more expensive 
than their XV brothers. But honestly, you really can’t go wrong with either 
model type. These devices have all been praised by the likes of CNET, and 
you can read a slew of reviews in the News section of the Neato website: 
www.neatorobotics.com.
Grillbot
Listen up, all you Masters of the Grill: Cleaning everyone’s favorite cooking 
device just got awesome-easy. I’m talking ROBOTIC-easy. That’s right: No 
more stabbing yourself with a thousand tiny metal bristles or scrubbing your 
knuckles off; we have a robot that can clean the grill for you!
The Grillbot is the dream gizmo of everyone who loves to grill but hates to 
clean up the darned things. Grillbot comes standard with three brass bristle 
brushes, which it uses to blast the grate of your grill for up to 30 minutes. 
The brushes are dishwasher safe and easy to remove and reinstall.

Grillbot offers stainless steel brushes that are a bit more durable than the 
brass brushes. (Stainless steel brushes can handle the tougher jobs without 
wearing out as quickly.) You can purchase them from the Grillbot website, 
www.grillbots.com.
Here’s how the whole thing goes down:
1.	Grill your favorite meat and veggies and enjoy!
2.	Allow your grill to cool down to at least 250 degrees Fahrenheit 
(cooler is better).
	NEVER use the Grillbot over an open flame!
3.	Place the Grillbot on the grill’s grate, as shown in Figure 5-7.
4.	Press the button on the Grillbot once for a 10-minute cycle, twice for a 
20-minute cycle, and three times for 30 minutes of grate-grinding fun.
5.	Grillbot will begin cleaning after a 5-second delay, to give you time to 
close the grill’s lid before it gets started.
6.	Grillbot will stop when the cycle is complete and will emit an alert to 
inform you it’s done its job.

Be sure to close the top of the grill! Grillbot will start churning away on 
your grate five seconds after you set the timer. When it starts to work, 
there’s very little shielding to keep the bits and pieces of grill-gunk from 
flying in your eyes.
Hopefully, someday the people at Grillbots will come up with a device that 
cleans the ashes for charcoal grills. Until then, you’d be hard-pressed to find 
a better Father’s Day gift than this puppy. Hint, hint, wink, wink to my family.
RoboSnail
I can imagine that there’s some segment of my readers who saw the title of 
this section and simply put the book down or skipped ahead a few pages.  
If you’re one of those who stuck around, I’d like you to know that I won’t be 
talking about slimy critters in this section — just slime. Aquarium slime, to 
be more precise. RoboSnail is not an ill-conceived sequel to the Robocop 
movies, in which a fatally wounded snail is paired with robotic technology 
that renews its life and turns it into a super-snail that cleans up crime-ridden 
gardens. As cool as that sounds, the real RoboSnail will sound just as awe-
some to aquarium owners.
RoboSnail cleans not your floors or even your grill, but your aquarium. The 
device (see Figure 5-8) is the world’s first automatic cleaning tool for aquari-
ums, taking on the daily mission of scouring the glass in your aquarium to 
keep it free from algae buildup.

RoboSnail consists of two moving parts that work in tandem to keep algae from 
overtaking the denizens of your aquarium. The first is the RoboSnail apparatus 
itself, which attaches to the outside (dry side) of your aquarium. This appara-
tus is what actually drives the whole show. The second part of the RoboSnail 
partnership is the Sweeper unit, which attaches to the inside (wet side) of the 
aquarium’s glass. The two units are held together through the glass by a very 
strong magnet. No worries about the magnet affecting your fish, though, unless 
they happen to be alien robots that are using your aquarium as a launching 
pad for their invasion of Earth, in which case it’s a bonus for us.
RoboSnail (www.robosnail.com) cleans your glass on a daily schedule, so 
it will need periodic maintenance to keep up the pace. However, the main-
tenance is a small price to pay when compared to the time and expense of 
cleaning the algae out of your aquarium once it’s built up on the glass. That’s 
a nasty job that all aquarium hobbyists loathe. Rejoice, people: RoboSnail is 
here to save the day!

t was a dark and stormy night . . .
And there you were, hiding under the covers.
Whether you consider the “dark and stormy night” line to be one of the best 
or worst in the history of novels, dark and stormy nights are no laughing 
matter to some folks.
Especially if, amid the clatter of the storm raging outside, you hear another 
clatter. Only this time, it’s coming from the general direction of the kitchen. 
Chances of you getting up to see what’s going on? Zero. Zilch. Nada.
Wouldn’t it be great if you could turn on the lights without even having to 
get out of bed? How cool would it be to flip on the lights in the kitchen to see 
if someone lets out a “yelp” and takes off? It sure beats going in there, you 
know, where it’s dark.
Suddenly you remember that you have newly installed automated lighting, and 
you can simply grab your smartphone off the nightstand and turn on the kitchen 
lights using your trusty app, coupled with a few swipes and taps of your finger!
Click! The lights come on and you hear a scramble! Just then you see your 
husband running from the kitchen, freshly made turkey sandwich in hand, 
bolting for the garage to hide the fact that he’s been cheating on his diet 
again. That scoundrel would’ve gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for your 
automated lighting. Technology to the rescue!

Lighting Your Life Automatically
From the first sparks of fire in a cave who-knows-how-many years ago right 
up until the late 1870s, fire has always been how we lit up the darkness in our 
lives. From campfires to wooden torches to candles to oil-filled lamps, the 
flame was how we made cave paintings, read parchments, and conducted 
outdoor events in the dark of night.
That changed forever, though, in 1879, when Thomas Edison finally struck a 
notion to use carbonized bamboo as the material for the filament in his new-
fangled electric light bulbs. From that moment on, we’ve taken great strides 
in lighting our way in dark places. I love to look at photos taken from space of 
the dark side of our planet and see all the lights dotting the earth. As you can 
see in Figure 6-1, most of us owe Thomas Edison an incredible amount of grati-
tude. Like most conveniences, we rarely give lighting much thought until we 
have a problem with it or don’t have access to it. Then all heck breaks loose.
Now that we have electric lighting, we must learn how to maximize its 
potential while minimizing its impact on the environment and our wallets. 
Automated lighting is a great step in the right direction.
Reasons for automatic lighting
As technology gets better and people’s knowledge grows, so does the need to 
be more responsible with the world’s resources. Since the bulk of energy use 
is tied to lighting people’s homes and the places we frequent, it only makes 
sense to move to automatic lighting.
Figure 6-1: 
This NASA 
photo 
shows how 
much of 
our world is 
lit at night. 
Stunning!

 Chapter 6: I’m in the Mood for . . . Anything: Automated Lighting
The benefits of automatic lighting are obvious — and not so obvious. Consider:
✓
✓Automated lighting helps keep lights on when they need to be and off 
when they should be. Although it sounds elementary, simply turning 
lights on when entering a room and off when leaving it saves a ton of 
money and energy.
✓
✓Lighting often deters folks from doing things they ought not be doing. 
Lighted houses are much less likely to be broken into than those that aren’t. 
Automated lighting helps you keep a light on when you may not be home.
✓
✓Lights that automatically dim based on other lighting conditions  
(sunlight, for example) save you big time on your energy bill.
✓
✓Being able to remotely control your lights is nothing short of awesome. 
If you accidentally leave the lights on all over the house when you dash 
out the door for work, just pull out your trusty smartphone and turn the 
lights off when you get a moment. Why fill the energy company’s coffers 
any more than necessary?
✓
✓Automated lighting ups the safety value of your home. For example, 
when your little ones get out of bed at night, motion sensors can trigger 
lights to come on and go off through the house, following your child to 
and from her night-time destinations.
Auto-lighting technology
Automated lighting is one of the “it” factors when it comes to home automa-
tion. Everyone automatically thinks of turning the lights on and off when the 
subject of home automation is broached, and for good reason: It’s really, 
really awesome to remotely and/or automatically control anything, especially 
something so prevalent in our lives as lighting. Now is a good place to start 
exploring what you can do with today’s automated lighting technologies.
Some of the lighting technologies I’m about to discuss employ specific types 
of bulbs, and others do not. To max out your power savings and achieve a 
superior experience with your automatic lighting solution, it’s always best to 
use energy-saving light bulbs. It saves you money in both the power they  
consume and the infrequency with which they need to be replaced.
Here are just a few of the things that you can do today in your home once 
you implement an automated lighting solution:
✓
✓Set schedules for your home’s lights to turn on or off when you want 
them to.
✓
✓Dim lights automatically, saving you on your power bills and also  
dramatically extending the life of your bulbs.

92
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
✓
✓Use a series of preset conditions that adjust your home’s lighting to fit 
certain conditions. For example, if you are planning to have a romantic 
evening with that special someone, you can use your Date Night setting 
to immediately set the lights in certain rooms to low, turn other lights 
off completely, and otherwise turn your pad into the most romantic  
getaway in town. Other settings ideas include:
•	Sleep: These settings turn off most of the lights in the home,  
leaving just a few on in strategic places like the bathroom and  
front porch.
•	Party: This combination of settings turns most of the lights in  
the house on, setting a few to dim and creating specific moods. 
You can even use this setting to control your lava lamps and 
disco ball.
•	Morning: This setting turns on the bathroom and kitchen lights, as 
well as those in the garage, so you can make your way safely to the 
car in those wee early hours.
✓
✓Motion sensors can be employed in your home auto-lighting solution. 
As you enter one room, the lights come on for you, and after you  
leave the previous room, its lights go off. The lights appear to follow 
you throughout your home as you move from room to room, and  
the energy company begins to wonder how you’re getting away with 
using so much less electricity lately. Motion sensors also detect  
when the residence is occupied, adding even more control to your 
lighting solution.
These are but a few of the things that automated lighting can do to make 
your life better. Check out the following section of who’s who in the field of 
automated lighting, and begin improving the quality of your life and the sum 
in your bank account today. Something tells me that your power company 
won’t go belly up any time soon, so you can switch to automated lighting 
with a clear conscience.
Illuminating the Kings of  
Automatic Lighting
Automated lighting has some heavyweight contenders who want you to light 
up your life with their products. You’ve probably heard of some of these 
folks before, but others might be new to you. Rest assured, though, that 
when it comes to smart home lighting, these folks know their stuff.

Philips
Philips has long been a giant in the lighting world, and it’s taken quite a large 
step into the world of automated lighting. Philips has developed a system  
of automated lighting that changes the way you see your world. That sounds 
like one big overblown statement to make, but once you see what the  
company is up to, I suspect you’ll be inclined to agree.
hue
The fine folks at Philips have conjured up a little thing they call hue. The hue 
isn’t a single device, but rather a line of devices that redefines how you light 
the spaces around you. “Redefines” seems like an awfully bold word to toss 
around when it comes to something like lighting, but I can’t gush enough 
about Philips’s hue products and how they work to affect your daily life.
Next, I explain what hue products do.
The hue range of products uses LED lighting, so they aren’t conventional 
bulbs, but they will fit into your current light sockets because they are the 
same size as standard A19 (the same size as most incandescent bulbs we’re 
all used to) bulbs. But that’s not all.
The hue bulbs connect wirelessly (using ZigBee, which you can find more 
about in Chapter 1) to the hue bridge (all of which can be seen in Figure 6-2), 
which connects to your Wi-Fi, allowing you to control your hue system via 
your smartphone or tablet with the hue app.

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
A hue bulb is able to light your home with brilliant white light. But that’s not 
all. It also can light your home with every shade of color in the spectrum. 
That’s right, I said it: every shade, from one bulb.
Here are a few other tidbits about hue:
✓
✓You can control 50 hue bulbs from one bridge.
✓
✓Mix and match colors throughout your home to make incredible  
combinations of colors.
✓
✓Use the hue app to create Lighting Recipes. These recipes are groups 
of settings that you can combine to make a recipe, which the app can 
easily recall and implement. Here are some recipe ideas that are already 
built into the app:
•	Reading: Your hue lights will automatically give you the perfect 
light for reading conditions.
•	Concentrate: This combination of lighting helps you maintain  
your focus.
•	Energize: This is perfectly suited to giving you that extra pep when 
you need it.
✓
✓The hue app enables you to easily customize colors by increasing or 
decreasing combinations of color within the app.
✓
✓You can set your hue bulbs to pulsate, or flicker, or any combination of 
flashes to help remind you of events or alert you about activities. For 
example, you could set your hue bulbs to flash three times when you 
receive an important email.
✓
✓Set up schedules to automatically turn your hue bulbs on or off at  
preset times.
✓
✓Geofencing capabilities let hue know when you’re close to home so that 
when you are within a preset distance to the house, the lights will be on 
and waiting to welcome you.
✓
✓The app enables you to create custom colors that match those in pictures 
that reside on your smartphone or tablet, as shown in Figure 6-3. For 
example, if the sky is so perfectly blue that you just have to take a picture 
of it so that you don’t forget it, you can use the hue app to “see” that par-
ticular shade of blue and it will create that same color in your bulb(s).
The hue’s recipes are based on sound science. Color really can impact you 
and your moods in ways most of us have never thought of, or at least don’t 
spend much time dwelling on. Philips has put together a great site aimed at 
teaching you all about lighting and how it can help you (as well as hurt you). 
That site is the Lighting University, and you can access it by going to www.
lighting.philips.com/main/connect/lighting_university/.

Setting up hue
Setting up a hue system is ridiculously simple:
1.	Replace your old standard bulbs with hue bulbs and turn on  
the light switch.
2.	Connect the hue bridge to your Wi-Fi hub using the Ethernet cable 
provided by Philips.
3.	Download the hue app to your iOS or Android device.
4.	Fire up the hue app and find your bridge on it.
5.	Once you’ve selected your bridge, you can discover the bulbs you 
installed in Step 1.
Now you have complete control over your hue system. It’s simple to add 
more bulbs to the mix as you see fit, too. You can even add other hue prod-
ucts to your system; you don’t have to be stuck with standard A19 bulbs, or 
other styles, if you started your hue system with one of the starter packs.

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
hue tap
If there could be a con to owning the hue lighting system, it would have to 
be this: The only way to control your lights is via the app on your iOS or 
Android device. You can no longer turn your light switches on and off like 
you’ve done from the time Mom and Dad first started pestering you about 
it way back when. You can imagine what a hassle this could potentially turn 
into, especially if you aren’t the only person occupying your home. Your kids 
will dutifully turn lights on and off at the switch as you taught them to, your 
spouse will have his own lighting ideas and recipes, and all other manner of 
higgledy-piggledy will take place. Bank on it.
The folks at Philips heard the complaints and totally understood, so they 
went to work doing something about it. That something is the hue tap. The 
tap, seen in Figure 6-4, is a four-button switch that you can take anywhere in 
the home with you, or you can mount it in a location of your choosing. The 
tap controls your hue system without the need of your app (once you’ve set 
it up, that is). Don’t worry, though: Your hue system still works with your 
app. It’s just that with the tap you won’t have to constantly be on the lookout 
for your smartphone or tablet.

I mention earlier that the tap has four buttons; at first glance, though, it only 
looks like there are three. The other button is actually the biggest part of the 
tap; the other three buttons are actually inside of the larger button.
Features of the hue tap include:
✓
✓Use the hue app to set up your tap. You can assign different functions to 
its four buttons from here.
✓
✓Take tap with you anywhere in the house; it’s completely portable.
✓
✓The tap never needs batteries! It actually uses kinetic energy as its 
power source, meaning that it’s powered by your touch. That, my 
friends, is worth the price of admission.
You can find the entire line of hue products, including where to buy them,  
at www2.meethue.com/. It has great videos and support materials, too.
INSTEON
INSTEON has been doing the home automation thing for more than 20 years, 
and that experience shows in its polished and expansive line of home  
automation products. If it’s home automation, INSTEON dabbles in it.  
Here are several examples of the company’s offerings:
✓
✓Security
✓
✓Motion sensors
✓
✓Sprinkler controls
✓
✓Energy monitoring
✓
✓Wi-Fi cameras
✓
✓Smoke detection
✓
✓Thermostats
✓
✓Remote controls
In my opinion, INSTEON shines with its work in home lighting. From bulbs to 
dimmers to switches, INSTEON has this automated lighting stuff down cold. 
The LED bulbs save tons of money and energy. INSTEON excels at dimmers and 
switches, which also save you money and energy by using less of the latter — 
even in lighting devices that don’t support dimming themselves. The company 
also has developed a smart hub that enables you, dear reader, to control all the 
lighting devices remotely. You’re about to dive head first into INSTEON’s home 
automated lighting and see for yourself what I’m raving about.

98
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
As you begin to investigate INSTEON you’ll most likely run into the term 
dual-band. Dual-band refers to how INSTEON manages communications 
among its devices in your home. INSTEON uses a dual approach, utilizing 
your home’s built-in wiring as well as RF (radio frequency) to converse 
among devices. This ensures that no matter how far an INSTEON device may 
be from other INSTEON devices or hubs, they’ll still stay in contact. Thumbs 
up, INSTEON!
LED bulbs
Since this chapter concentrates on lighting, I start the INSTEON section with 
a look at its LED light bulbs, one of which you can see in Figure 6-5. INSTEON 
LED bulbs are much more energy efficient than standard light bulbs, using 
anywhere from 9 watts to 12 watts (depending on the bulb) and providing 
light that’s equivalent to a 60-watt standard bulb.
INSTEON’s LED bulbs are the world’s first networked dimmable bulb, and 
there’s more to them than meets the eye:
✓
✓LED bulbs fit right into your standard bulb sockets (A19 for typical bulbs 
and PAR38 for recessed lights), so there’s no need to buy new lighting 
sockets.
✓
✓Create custom lighting scenes using different levels (preset brightness) 
and ramp rates (how long it takes your bulb to turn on or off).


 Chapter 6: I’m in the Mood for . . . Anything: Automated Lighting
✓
✓Color temperature for INSTEON bulbs are set to 2,700k, which gives you 
a rich, warm light (the same as the incandescent bulbs that we’re all 
used to).
✓
✓INSTEON LED bulbs are built to last for 52,000 hours, compared to only 
1,000 hours for typical bulbs. “Cha-ching,” says the wallet.
✓
✓According to INSTEON, its bulbs will cost an average of 96 cents a year 
to operate, compared to more than $7 a year for standard bulbs.
✓
✓INSTEON bulbs are built to dim, which is not something that all LED 
bulbs can boast.
INSTEON bulbs do indeed dim, but you need INSTEON dimmers, or the 
INSTEON hub paired with the INSTEON app, to perform this action. And no, 
you cannot use INSTEON bulbs with your standard dimming switches; they 
simply won’t work.
Find out more about INSTEON bulbs here: www.INSTEON.com/267x-led-
bulbs.html.
Couple your INSTEON light bulbs with INSTEON motion sensors. With this 
kind of setup, you can have your lights come on when motion is detected in 
the room you’re entering, or to go off once you leave the room.
INSTEON dimmers and switches
INSTEON LED bulbs are great, but to maximize their usefulness you need to 
get your hands on INSTEON dimmers and switches, too. These little fellows 
are built to work with INSTEON products, so they fit seamlessly into your 
INSTEON environment.
INSTEON’s SwitchLinc dimmers and switches are award-winning devices. 
Four models are available, each with a slightly different purpose in mind:
✓
✓2474DWH: This puppy is designed for junction boxes that have no 
neutral wire. The first caveat is that it will only communicate in RF, not 
dually through RF and your home’s wiring. The second is that it will only 
work with dimmable incandescent lights, not LEDs.
✓
✓2477DH: This bad boy is the dimmer switch for high wattage needs. It 
can dim and switch up to 1,000 watts. It does require the presence of a 
neutral wire in the junction box.
✓
✓2477S: This on/off switch does only two things: turns them on or off, no 
dimming available. However, it does still connect to your INSTEON net-
work, and it does enable you to remotely control more than just lights, 
including items such as ceiling fans.

100
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
✓
✓2477D: This dimmer, shown in Figure 6-6, is the most popular of the 
four. It is used to dim and switch on or off most of the lighting in your 
home. If your lights are dimmable and you have a neutral wire in the 
junction box you want to install it in, this model is for you.

Those of you who like a bit of style to go along with your tech, have no fear: 
INSTEON dimmers and switches don’t just come in white. They come in a 
variety of designer colors to suit almost any decor need.
See more of these really innovative dimmers and switches by visiting  
www.INSTEON.com/2477-wall-switches.html.
INSTEON app and hub
INSTEON is rocking with the lights, dimmers, and switches, but this is  
the age of the smartphone, where people demand that everything from 
controlling their lights to making a pot of coffee can be done with a tap  
or swipe of the screen. This isn’t lost on the good people at INSTEON, as 
evidenced by their attention to detail in their smart hub and apps for iOS 
and Android devices.
The INSTEON hub, shown in Figure 6-7, is the center of your INSTEON-
enabled home. It not only connects all your INSTEON devices in one  
location, but also provides access to your devices via the previously  
mentioned app.

While INSTEON’s hub does handle a slew (yes, that’s a numeric term, 
where I come from) of functions, this chapter is mainly concerned  
with lighting, of course. The hub can help you with lighting control in  
several ways:
✓
✓You are always connected to your home’s lighting, whether you’re  
there or halfway around the world (as long as you have Internet access, 
of course).
✓
✓All your settings are stored in the cloud, so no matter how many  
smartphones or tablets you have, you can use and access the same  
settings from all of them.
✓
✓Receive email or instant message alerts whenever a problem or other 
incident arises.
✓
✓Your purchase of the hub is a one-time expense; no monthly fees with 
INSTEON! (That’s a huge advantage of INSTEON, in my opinion.)
✓
✓The hub also utilizes the dual-band technology I discuss earlier. Dual-
band allows INSTEON to use both the power lines in your home and RF 
to communicate among INSTEON devices.
✓
✓Access your hub and interact with your INSTEON devices via the iOS  
or Android app on your smart devices, or via a web browser on your 
computer.

I mention the INSTEON app several times in this chapter, so let’s take a 
peek at it now. The INSTEON app, shown in Figure 6-8, allows you to  
control all your INSTEON devices from your smart device, whether a phone 
or tablet, as long as it runs a relatively recent version of an iOS or Android 
operating system. In terms of controlling your INSTEON lighting, though, 
here’s what you can do:
✓
✓Control individual lighting devices within your home, including  
bulbs and/or dimmers and switches.
✓
✓Set up lighting scenes, and implement them whether home or away.
✓
✓Make schedules for your lights to come on or go off as you please, 
depending on the time of day or night.
✓
✓Adjust levels and ramp rates on the fly.
To see the myriad ways the INSTEON hub can help you control your lighting 
and most other home automation needs, go to www.INSTEON.com/hub. Tell 
‘em Dwight sent you.
TCP
TCP has been a player in the energy-efficient lighting market for more than 
20 years, and it’s put its hat in the smart home ring with its line of Connected 
light bulbs.

The Connected system uses LED bulbs (see Figure 6-9) to brighten your day 
(and night), and those bulbs are quite nice. Here are some of their features:
✓
✓The brightness of the bulbs is 800 lumens, which is about as bright as a 
standard 60-watt bulb. The Connected bulbs are among the brightest of 
those discussed so far in this chapter.
✓
✓These bulbs are also smart, communicating with the Connect Lighting 
Gateway so that you can control them from anywhere in your home  
(or out of it, as you see in a bit).
✓
✓The bulbs come in two sizes: A19 to fit standard bulb sockets, and BR30 
for recessed lighting.
✓
✓Both sizes come in either soft white or daylight, and you can mix the two 
if you like.
The best way to get going with a TCP Connected system is by getting a 
starter kit, which consists of:
✓
✓Three bulbs (two starter kits are available, one for each bulb size)
✓
✓One Lighting Gateway
✓
✓One remote control

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Setting up your Connected system is simple:
1.	Turn off power to the light sockets at the wall switch.
2.	Replace your existing bulbs with new Connected bulbs.
3.	Turn the wall light switches back on.
4.	Hook the Lighting Gateway to your Wi-Fi router using the supplied 
Ethernet cable and the power cable.
5.	Download the TCP Lighting app from the iOS or Android App Store.
6.	Walk through the on-screen instructions for setting up your Connected 
bulbs.
	The app will automatically discover the bulbs once you open it on your 
smart device.
I implore you to run, not walk, to the nearest computer and use your favorite 
browser to check out the home automation goodies on TCP’s site at http://
go.tcpi.com/GetConnected.
The TCP Connected bulbs are compatible with the Wink system (see 
Chapter 14 for more information about Wink). This means that if you already 
have the Wink hub, all you now need to purchase are individual TCP bulbs, 
as opposed to needing a starter kit. The Wink hub takes the place of TCP’s 
Lighting Gateway, and the Wink app can handle the remote control of your 
lights on both iOS and Android devices.
SmartThings
SmartThings is another company with an eye on home automation. Not 
to say that others aren’t on top of the home automation game, too, but 
SmartThings has been a company on the move for a few years now, and  
it continues to grow in popularity.
Its home automation philosophy revolves around the SmartThings Hub, 
which is the control center for devices that are compatible with the 
SmartThings universe. The Hub, shown in Figure 6-10, is, of course,  
interacted with by use of a really great app.
“Okay, so it has a hub and an app, but so do other companies.”
I knew you were going to say that!

105

 Chapter 6: I’m in the Mood for . . . Anything: Automated Lighting
The SmartThings app may be one of the best home automation apps out 
there, in my humble opinion. The interface alone is just beautiful to look at, 
but its functionality is also second to none. However, it isn’t just the hub and 
the app that make SmartThings, well, smart; it’s the number of vendors who 
work with them to supply cutting-edge home automation products for you. 
Since this chapter focuses on lighting, I stick to that topic here. Some of the 
companies that have teamed up with SmartThings include:
✓
✓GE
✓
✓Aeon Labs
✓
✓Jasco
✓
✓SmartPower
SmartThings offers stand-alone products and offers starter kits that cater to 
how you might want to kick-start your home automation habit. There are kits 
for water leak detection, security, and energy saving. For the purposes in this 
chapter, though, I talk only about the lighting automation kit, which you can 
see in Figure 6-11. This kit contains one of each of the following items:
✓
✓SmartThings Hub: Control all the SmartThings-compatible devices 
you’re sure to invest in once you get your feet wet (not literally, of 
course — water and electricity don’t mix!).

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
✓
✓SmartPower Outlet: You can plug your lights (or any other electrical 
device, for that matter) into it. You can then control the outlet itself, 
turning your lights on and off with it, and even get alerts if you’ve left 
the lights on. And of course you can use the SmartThings app to turn 
them off.
✓
✓Jasco Pluggable Light Dimmer Outlet: This outlet plugs into a standard 
wall outlet, giving you one additional outlet along with a Z-Wave AC 
outlet that you can control through your SmartThings hub and app. This 
baby works as advertised, allowing you to control and even dim your 
connected lights.
✓
✓Aeon Labs Minimote: This is essentially a remote control for your 
SmartThings-compatible devices. You can control lighting with this 
remote instead of having to use your smartphone or tablet, which is  
convenient if you’re charging your device or just don’t want to have to 
go through a myriad of swipes and taps to turn your lights on or off.
You can download and take the SmartThings Mobile app for a trial spin if you 
want to just see how it works. I stand by the facts that it’s both functional 
and beautiful, and giving it a test run is free, so why not?

Belkin
Chapter 4 shows you how Belkin’s WeMo products can help you control your 
thermostats, but now you’re going to find out how the exact same apps and 
products can make you master of your home’s lighting.
WeMo’s LED Lighting Starter Set
WeMo’s LED Lighting Starter Set (is there an echo in here?) comes loaded 
with everything you need to get started in the world of automated lighting — 
the WeMo way.
The Starter Set, shown in Figure 6-12, comes with the following goodies:
✓
✓Two WeMo Smart LED Bulbs: The bulbs give off roughly the same 
amount of light as a typical 60-watt bulb. They can also be dimmed to 
help set the mood and save your cash.
✓
✓One WeMo Link: The Link acts as the central control hub for up to  
50 WeMo Smart LED Bulbs, so your whole house can get into the act.

108
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Your lighting is then controlled via the WeMo app. Simply install your bulbs, 
connect the Link to your home’s Wi-Fi network, and download the app. When 
you fire it up, it will automatically find your bulbs and get you rolling.
The WeMo Switch
Another option from Belkin is the WeMo Switch, which allows you to control 
whatever electrical device you see fit to plug into it. The Switch plugs into a 
standard 120v outlet in your home, at which time you can connect any electrical 
device to it. You can plug any lamp into the Switch and control it from a  
million miles away, so long as your Internet connection reaches that far.
The free WeMo app for iOS or Android devices allows you full control over 
whatever lighting device you plug into your Switch. This is how to do it:
1.	Plug your Switch into the outlet of your choice (or your dreams,  
if you’re really into outlets).
2.	Download the WeMo app on your iOS or Android smartphone  
or tablet.
3.	Your Switch will create a WeMo network; just connect to the  
WeMo network as you would any other network on your device.
4.	Open the WeMo app and choose your home’s Wi-Fi network to  
connect your Switch to it.
5.	Name your Switch with a descriptive name so you can easily tell 
which lighting device it controls in your home.
	Choose an icon for the Switch to indicate the type of device it controls 
(a light, in this case), and then tap Done. The newly configured Switch 
will appear in your list of controlled devices.
6.	Tap the power switch icon next to your device in the list to turn  
it on or off.
	Green shows you the device is on, and gray is off.
While this is probably the simplest lighting automation setup this chapter 
explores, it is by no means less. The WeMo Switch does what it is intended to 
do, and does it very well.

to offer.

J
 
oe the caveman (yes, Joe’s been a common name for quite a while, it 
seems) has it all:
✓
✓Jane, his lovely cavewife
✓
✓Three adorable cavekids
✓
✓This round stone thing that’s good for getting around quickly (he’s 
thinking about calling it a wheel or a cog, but he’s having a tough time 
deciding which)
✓
✓A group of other cavemen with whom he likes to go hunting every day
✓
✓A set of clubs that would make Tiger Woods jealous (but used for 
entirely different purposes, of course)
✓
✓A great job down at the quarry (apologies to the Flintstones)
✓
✓A three-bedroom/two-bath cave on the south side of the mountain 
where the breeze doesn’t blow in
Life is great for Joe, but in an instant his life could change if threatened. 
That’s why Joe is heavy into modern security for his home and loved ones:
✓
✓Brutus, his trusty pet dinosaur, has been trained as an attack dino, but 
he’s also great with the kids.
✓
✓Joe has an awesome fire pit situated right near the cave entrance, so 
it not only keeps the cave warm, but it also wards off any critters that 
might be skulking around.
✓
✓His collection of clubs are strategically placed around the cave so he 
can get to them quickly should the need arise.

110
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
As you can see, Joe is all about keeping those he loves, and the possessions 
he has, safe.
You and I are just as concerned about security for the people and things that 
matter the most to us, just as Joe was back in the day. But we do things a 
little differently.
Establishing Security in the  
Automatic Age
Passwords are everywhere. If passwords were tangible things, our world would 
be one huge alphanumeric soup, with letters and numbers and ­symbols lying 
all about, falling from the sky, dangling from trees, and ­generally creating all 
manner of chaos. They proliferate everything in our ­digital lives. You, I, and 
everyone else with electronic devices have ­passwords (and usernames — we 
mustn’t forget those) for accessing the ­following and more:
✓
✓Computer
✓
✓Smartphone
✓
✓Tablet
✓
✓Email
✓
✓Bank account
✓
✓App store accounts
✓
✓Social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and the list  
goes on and on)
✓
✓Streaming video subscriptions (Netflix, Hulu, and so forth)
✓
✓Online retail stores (Amazon and the like)
✓
✓Viewing your kids’ grades online
✓
✓Internet service provider account
✓
✓Television service provider account
✓
✓Accounts for all the home automation devices you’ll purchase after 
reading this book
There are even software constructs, such as Apple’s Keychain in its OS 
X operating system, which keeps all the passwords you have for all your 
accounts in one encrypted, safe place. Of course, you have to remember your 
Keychain password, but remembering one is better than remembering 50.

111

 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
Keeping electronic things secure has become a way of life for most of us, and 
keeping our homes secure has been a priority since man moved into his first 
cave a few millennia ago.
Keeping your eyes homeward
There are any number of scenarios you can dream up for keeping tabs on 
your home while you aren’t there:
✓
✓What happens if your kids are home but don’t have their keys? They can 
call you and you could use the passcode on your iPhone’s app to unlock 
the deadbolt, or they could use their own smartphones to do so.
✓
✓You’re on vacation and no one is home, but you get a motion-detection 
alert on your Android tablet. Time to call the police to check it out.
✓
✓The baby is sleeping but you’re afraid to go wash clothes on the other 
end of the house because you might not hear her if she wakes. No 
­problem: Just use the Wi-Fi camera in her room and its app on your 
smart device to keep an eye on and an ear out for her.
That barely scratches the surface of what homeowners and parents can 
­imagine when it comes to security needs, but you get the picture.
Locking things down
You have four main ways to making your home more secure, and I quickly 
explore them all in this section of the chapter.
Alarms
Home alarms have been around for decades, but these days, your alarm 
won’t just make a loud noise to wake the neighbors, or alert only the security 
company. You can now be advised, via an app on your smart device, when 
an alarm has been triggered. You can also reset the alarm from afar, without 
having to get up from your beach chair when on vacation.
Locks
You can lock or unlock smart locks with an app on your smart device. Some 
of them even allow access to your locks from computers through a web 
browser. And for those moments when you feel like going old school, you can 
also still use a key.

112
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Cameras
Web cameras have been around for a while, too, and you’ve even been able 
to view their streams from remote computers using web browsers. Now 
that smartphones and tablets are here, you can view your webcam from just 
about anywhere, provided you have access to the Internet.
Motion detectors
Again, motion detectors are nothing new for some folks, but the way you 
can interact with them from your smart devices opens a whole new world of 
security possibilities.
Staking Out the Wardens  
of Home Security
As smart home technology takes off, home security is one of the areas that 
has seen a real proliferation in devices. Security is more important to most 
folks than, say, vacuuming the floor or cleaning the fish tank, so devices 
catering to that market tend to spring up faster than some others. In this 
part of the chapter, you meet a few of the major players in the arena of smart 
home security.
SmartThings
One of the more popular functions of the SmartThings home automation 
system is home security. So much so, in fact, that the company has ­developed 
a kit that caters specifically to home security. Actually, it has three separate kits 
for catering to those concerned with home security: Smart Home Security kit, 
Smarter Home Security kit, and the Smartest Home Security kit (see Figure 7-1). 
Take a look at what each kit offers.
The Smart Home Security kit contains:
✓
✓One SmartThings hub: This is the nerve center of the SmartThings 
home automation system. You need this so that you and your devices 
can communicate.
✓
✓One SmartSense Motion Sensor: This will detect movement in whatever 
room you place it in.
✓
✓One SmartSense Moisture Sensor: This will help you know when 
­potential leaks are occurring.

113

 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
✓
✓One SmartPower Outlet: You can plug any electrical device into it and 
control how and when it operates.
✓
✓One SmartSense Presence Sensor: This little device is something that 
people or animals (as shown in Figure 7-2) carry on themselves. When 
they come within, or go outside of, range of the SmartThings hub or 
other sensor in your home automation environment, the system will 
­trigger an alert or some other action.
✓
✓One SmartSense Open/Closed Sensor: This sensor will alert you when a 
door or window is opened or closed. You can even configure it to trigger 
your heating or cooling units if they are attached to a smart thermostat, 
which you read about in Chapter 4.

The Smarter Home Security comes with everything the Smart Home Security 
kit does, plus:
✓
✓One FortrezZ Siren Strobe Alarm, intended to scare the socks off of 
anyone who may be entering your home without your permission
✓
✓Three additional SmartSense Open/Closed Sensors (total of four)
✓
✓One additional SmartSense Motion Sensor (total of two)
✓
✓One additional SmartPower Outlet (total of two)
Now it’s time to get really smart, with the Smartest Home Security kit, 
­containing the same items as the Smart and Smarter Home Security kits, 
along with the following:
✓
✓One Jasco Pluggable Light Dimmer Outlet
✓
✓One additional SmartSense Motion Sensor (total of three)
✓
✓One additional SmartSense Moisture Sensor (total of two)
✓
✓One additional SmartSense Presence Sensor (total of two)
As you can see, SmartThings has you covered in the security department. 
Controlling your home security devices is a snap using the SmartThings 
app on your iOS or Android smart device. Visit www.smartthings.com/­
benefits/home-security/ for more information on getting smart about 
your home security.
SmartThings offers other home security devices as well, other than those 
included in the kits, so browse its website for more items that might fit  
your needs.
Belkin
Belkin’s WeMo home automation system is a great one for the budget-­
conscious. That’s not to say the devices are cheap by any means; they are 
simply more affordable than some others and they get the job done well.
In the home security arena, Belkin has what you need when it comes to  
the basics:
✓
✓Webcams that allow you to see the goings-on inside your home, even 
when you aren’t there
✓
✓Motion sensors to alert you when movement is detected in certain areas 
of your home

115

 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
I discuss Belkin’s NetCam web cameras in detail in Chapter 15, so I urge you 
to mosey on over there to learn more about them.
The WeMo Motion motion sensor is a great little device that just does what 
it advertises: It detects motion and reports it to you on your iOS or Android 
smart device. Unfortunately, you can’t buy the Motion sensor by itself; you 
have to buy it with a WeMo Switch as a bundle (see Figure 7-3).
The Motion can be paired with the Switch to turn lights, fans, or other 
devices on or off when motion is detected. This is a great way to get started 
with home automation and enhance your personal level of security, all at the 
same time. You can also tell the Motion to send you text messages when it 
detects movement.
Check out the Switch + Motion at www.belkin.com/us/F5Z0340-Belkin/

Alarm.com
If you’re someone who doesn’t want to skimp on accessories, does want 24/7 
monitoring by a third-party security company, and the cost of the whole 
thing is something you aren’t overly concerned about, then Alarm.com just 
may be what you’re looking for.

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Alarm.com provides every security feature a smart home owner could need 
or want:
✓
✓The Alarm.com system uses wireless cellular technology to communi-
cate your home’s status to third-party security teams. This ensures that 
even if an intruder cuts communication lines going into your home, your 
system is still up and running wirelessly. This alone is a great feature of 
Alarm.com.
✓
✓The entire system has a battery backup should the power go out. So,  
for up to 24 hours after a power interruption, your family and home are 
still safe.
✓
✓Alarm.com’s Image Sensor not only alerts you when motion is detected 
in a certain area of the home, but it also takes a high-quality picture 
and allows you to view it on your smart device or on your personalized 
Alarm.com website.
✓
✓You can tie your home security and home automation together in ways 
others can’t do. One example from Alarm.com’s website states that 
you can configure your system to shut down your HVAC in the event 
that carbon monoxide or smoke is detected, helping to slow down their 
spread throughout the home.
✓
✓You have full control over your Alarm.com system through the Internet 
using your smartphone, tablet, or computer, as shown in Figure 7-4.

 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
I could say so much more about Alarm.com, but there’s just too much infor-
mation to give you in this format. Alarm.com is a full-service security and 
home automation outfit; it can do it all, and it also gives you full control over 
your security solution through its apps and website. You owe it to yourself to 
at least give this company and its products a look by visiting www.alarm.com.
Alarm.com does more than home security; it also is quite fluent in the  
languages of home automation, energy management, personal wellness,  
and more.
ADT
ADT has been in the security business for more than a century; we’ve all seen 
the company’s signs in yards of customers who use its systems. You don’t 
stick around that long unless you’re good at what you do, and ADT is among 
the best when it comes to home security. As a forward-thinking company, 
ADT has made the move into home automation as well, blending the  
convenience of home automation with top-notch home security.
ADT’s Pulse system combines security and automation into one package. 
ADT provides the following features:
✓
✓Monitors your Pulse system 24/7.
✓
✓Sends alerts to your smartphone or tablet.
✓
✓Enables you to control your home’s lights and thermostats.
✓
✓Allows you to remotely arm and disarm the system.
✓
✓Uses Z-Wave technology, so it may be compatible with your existing 
home automation devices.
✓
✓Utilizes a wall-mounted touchscreen for easy control in your home.
✓
✓The Pulse web portal allows you to access your system from any web 
browser on any computer, so long as you have Internet access.
✓
✓Pulse Voice allows you to speak commands to your security system, 
such as “Arm the security system” or “Unlock the front door.”
✓
✓View live camera feeds from your computer or smart device  
(see Figure 7-5).
✓
✓Use the Pulse app on your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet to 
remotely control and adjust settings for your system.

118
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Of course, ADT charges a monthly fee to monitor your home. If that’s not 
something that puts you off, however, then ADT Pulse is well worth looking 
into. Check out more information, including some very nice video tutorials,  
at www.adt.com/pulse.
Vivint
Once upon a time, there was a company called APX Alarm. APX changed its 
name to Vivint in 2010, combining the words “vive” and “intelligent,” which 
means “to live intelligently.” It was an apt name change, as helping its  
customers to live intelligently is exactly what Vivint does.
Vivint has become one of the biggest players when it comes to home automa-
tion, insofar as a company that does the whole thing for you. Vivint installs 
the components and quotes you a monthly price for monitoring. This isn’t a 
bad thing, but it’s the reason you don’t see this company mentioned in other 
parts of this book: The book focuses mainly on do-it-yourself smart home 
automation. But since I’m talking about security, and I mention companies 
like ADT and Alarm.com, which provide 24/7 monitoring for a fee, I would be 
remiss to leave out a group as good at the craft as Vivint.
Here are some of the best features of Vivint’s Smart Home Security package:
✓
✓Vivint’s team monitors your home 24 hours, 7 days a week, 365¼ days a 
year (and all day February 29 in leap years when there are 366 days).
✓
✓The entire system is wireless, so no need to worry about intruders  
cutting wires or any such nonsense.

 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
✓
✓A touchscreen mounted on a wall in your home allows for easy access to 
your security settings.
✓
✓Create nonemergency alerts that tell you when an event occurs, such as 
when a certain door, like the one to your toddler’s room, is opened or 
closed.
✓
✓Motion detectors let you know when activity is taking place in a part of 
your home that you want to keep an eye on.
✓
✓Receive text alerts when potential problems arise, such as a smoke 
alarm being triggered or the system’s alarm going off.

I don’t know about you, but not including the yard sign would’ve been a deal 
breaker for me. While the preceding list doesn’t sound like much, you are 
able to add more devices as you see a need. Some optional devices include:
✓
✓Smoke detectors
✓
✓Carbon monoxide detectors
✓
✓Panic pendants, which you wear on your clothing or carry in your 
pocket. It can be used in case of an accident to notify Vivint you have an 
emergency, so long as you’re in range of your system.
✓
✓Glass-break detectors, which alert you to broken glass in your home. 
No, it won’t go off if you knock a glass off the kitchen counter, but it will 
monitor windows for breakage. This is a pretty neat and unique device: 
two thumbs up.
If the idea of 24/7 monitoring sounds like your idea of home security (and 
who wouldn’t think so?), go to www.vivint.com/solutions/packages/
home-security to find out more.
As of this writing, you’ll find a chart on Vivint’s website that compares its 
offerings to other home security providers, but pay it no mind. Either it’s 
simply outdated and needs revision, or it is comparing apples to oranges. For 
example, the chart claims that Vivint provides a touchscreen panel and ADT 
does not, but that is not the case. There are other such discrepancies in the 
chart, so simply pay it no mind in determining which company you’ll want to 
use for monitored home security options.
Schlage
Walter Schlage began creating door locks way back in 1909, and the company 
bearing his name remains one of the stalwarts of door locks to this day. His 
first patent was for a door knob that not only locked but could turn lights on 
and off — in 1909! This kind of innovation is what has kept Schlage on top of 
its game over the years, and it continues into the age of the smart home.
Schlage has introduced the Connect and Touch lines of keyless locks, which 
also offer you connectivity with many of the major home automation com­
panies so that you can control your electronic locks remotely.
The Connect line, one of which can be seen in Figure 7-7, is a bit pricy, but 
also a bit more top-of-the-line, offering the following features:
✓
✓It has been awarded the highest security grade in the industry, a Grade 
1 rating.
✓
✓It features a motorized deadbolt.

121

 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
✓
✓You can create and delete up to 30 access codes at a time.
✓
✓It uses Z-Wave technology to connect with home automation systems 
from third parties.
✓
✓You can remotely control your lock using your home automation 
­system’s app.
✓
✓It comes with a built-in alarm that sounds when the lock is tampered with.
✓
✓Activity Alerts let you know when folks come in or go out.
✓
✓It can tell when someone is using a lot of force to open the door, and 
then instantly send you a notification on your smart device.
✓
✓It enables you to go totally keyless or use a key, whichever you prefer.

The Touch line, shown in Figure 7-8, is also a great line of locks, but there are 
some key (pun intended) differences in features:
✓
✓It sports a Grade 2 security rating, which is high — but it ain’t a 1.
✓
✓When Schlage says this lock is keyless, it means it; there is no key  
with the Touch line of locks. You use the keypad, an app, or you stay 
locked out.
✓
✓According to Schlage, this line is 100 percent pick-proof.
✓
✓It remembers up to 19 codes at a time.
✓
✓A built-in light helps you see what numbers you’re pressing on  
the keypad.

Schlage electronic locks work with quite a few home automation systems  
that provide apps for controlling smart home devices. Some of those systems 
that make nice with Schlage include:

✓Elan

✓Honeywell

see if it’s compatible with the Schlage line of electronic locks before purchasing 
a Schlage lock.
Visit www.schlage.com/en/home/keyless-deadbolt-locks.html 
to learn more. But be warned: The website is extremely clunky to navigate. 
Scrolling is cumbersome and some links tend to overlap. A bit surprising, really, 
but don’t let a website deter you from the product. Schlage is good stuff.

August
While August has been around for only a short time (just a few months at the 
time of this writing), I have to confess that I’m intrigued by the company and 
its Smart Lock. This little guy (shown in Figure 7-9) is a nifty piece of engi-
neering, and is a welcome addition to any smart home automation setup.
The August Smart Lock lets you unlock or lock your deadbolt with your 
iOS or Android smartphone. You can either manually use the August app 
on your smartphone to control the lock, or you can program it to automati-
cally unlock when you (and your phone) are within a certain range of the 
deadbolt.
The August app and the August website (www.august.com) allow you to 
change codes for your lock, and to also invite others to use your lock by 
sending them their own codes. You can use this feature in a variety of ways:
✓
✓Give your housekeeper a key that only works during certain hours of the 
day, and adjust the hours if you need to.
✓
✓Create individual keys for each family member so that you know who’s 
coming and going.
✓
✓Allow your trusted neighbors to have a temporary key while you’re 
away, say, on vacation or a business trip. Don’t worry; you’ll be notified 
the moment anyone enters the house using the key, so you can keep 
tabs on who’s in the house and when.
Those are just a few examples, but you get the idea.
Figure 7-9: 
August’s 
Smart Lock 
allows you 
to lock or 
unlock it 
with your 
smartphone.

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
The August Smart Lock works with Bluetooth, so you won’t have to worry 
about wiring the new lock or whether electrical outages will be a problem. 
The only downside to that is you have to leave Bluetooth running on your 
smartphone, which could diminish its battery life. It’s fairly simple to turn 
Bluetooth on and off on most smart devices, but who wants the hassle? Just 
leave it on and deal with having to recharge more often.
The encryption August uses in its locks and key codes is the same stuff used 
by banks to secure online banking transactions. I’d say that’s pretty safe, 
wouldn’t you? Nothing’s foolproof, of course, but neither is your current 
deadbolt.
Here’s the genius of the August Smart Lock, though: It replaces the interior 
portion of your currently installed deadbolt, as shown in Figure 7-10. Nothing 
changes on the outside of your door, and you can still manually open the 
door from the inside by simply turning the outer rim of the Smart Lock, just 
like you would a door knob.
Installation is simple and only takes about 15 minutes per lock. The Smart 
Lock even comes with three different adapters and three different mounting 
plates to ensure a proper fit to your current hardware. The folks at August 
have really thought this thing through.
The process of setting up an account involves several steps, which include 
verifying your identity through both text message and email, but as August 
explains on its support site, the goal is to make sure you are safe and secure 
with your purchase. A few extra steps to ensure my family’s safety? Sounds 
good to me.
If you want to take a look at the lock in a retail setting, cruise on over to your 
local Apple Store, where you’ll find an August Smart Lock sitting on a shelf.


 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
At the time of this writing, August isn’t able to function remotely using third-
party home automation systems, but the company is planning to unveil that 
feature in the future. For now, all updates to the lock’s software must be done 
through the app with the phone in close proximity. That really is my only 
beef with the August Smart Lock, and it won’t be a problem for long, it seems.
Curious about whether your iOS or Android device (yes, iPads are supported 
after initial setup, but no Android tablets are listed) will work with your  
new August lock? Visit www.august.com/phones to see if your device 
makes the grade.
I implore you to go to www.august.com to see more information on August, 
as well as viewing the four different styles offered to suit any decor.
Use your smartphone’s security features, such as a passcode or fingerprint 
recognition, to protect your phone and your home in case your smartphone 
is lost or stolen. In the event that this does happen, you can also log in to 
your account at www.august.com and change the codes to your lock.
Yale
Yale claims to be the “world’s favorite lock,” and it’s hard to argue that claim 
since the company’s products are available in more than 125 countries. As 
one of the oldest and most trusted brands of locks in the world, it’s only 
natural that Yale would join the fray with its own line of smart locks.
The Yale Real Living line of products is designed to work with your current 
home automation setup. Yale offers touchscreen and push-button varieties of 
deadbolt locks, including both keyed and keyless types, that work with your 
existing (or soon-to-be-installed) Z-Wave- or ZigBee-compatible home automa-
tion system. Offering both Z-Wave and ZigBee options is a good move by Yale.
The Touchscreen Lever Lock, seen in Figure 7-11, offers the convenience of 
keyless entry, the functionality of a lever lock, and remote control through 
your home automation system.
Yale partners with several of the most popular home automation companies. 
If you have a system from one of these companies, chances are your Yale 
smart lock will work with it:
✓
✓Alarm.com
✓
✓Control4
✓
✓ELK Products

126
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
✓
✓HomeSeer
✓
✓Honeywell

✓Vera
Although they aren’t listed on Yale’s website, I’m confident that other Z-Wave- 
and ZigBee-compatible home automation systems will work with the Yale 
Real Living locks. Still, I urge you to speak to someone at Yale or the manufac-
turer of your system to find out more before you invest in a Yale product.
Check out the Yale Real Living lineup of locks (there are several models,  
each with various styles to suit your home’s needs) by going to www.
yaleresidential.com/en/yale/yaleresidential-com/Residential/ 
and clicking the Yale Real Living link on the left side of the browser window. 
While Yale’s site isn’t as fancy-shmancy as some of the others in this chapter, 
it does what it should: give you the facts about each product in the Yale Real 
Living lineup.
Lockitron
The folks at Lockitron have something really cool going on. They have only 
been at the smart lock game for a while, but they are already creating a 
splash when it comes to remotely controlling your deadbolts.
Like the August Smart Lock I mention earlier, Lockitron works with your 
­currently installed deadbolt. However, unlike the August Lock, Lockitron 
doesn’t replace the interior hardware: It fits over it. That’s right; I said “fits

over it.” The Lockitron people have put tons of research and Q&A into the 
product, and it shows.
Lockitron, shown in Figure 7-12, will fit over most locks, which is good. But 
unlike August, Lockitron does communicate via Wi-Fi right out of the box. 
(Again, as of this writing, August promises this for the future.) This means 
that you can control your Lockitron from anywhere you have a smart device 
or a computer, which is huge.
Installing your Lockitron is fairly straightforward:
1.	Download the Lockitron app for your iOS or Android smart device, 
create an account, and register your Lockitron.
2.	Insert the included batteries into the Lockitron.
	It will power on automatically.
3.	Follow the instructions in the Lockitron app to set up your Lockitron 
with your Wi-Fi.
4.	Loosen, don’t remove, the two screws on your deadbolt’s inner plate.
5.	Slide Lockitron’s C-plate behind the deadbolt’s plate.
6.	Tighten the two screws on your deadbolt’s plate to hold it and the  
C-plate in place.
7.	Place the main body of your Lockitron over the C-plate and line the 
notches up. Turn the main body clockwise until they lock, but be 
­careful not to force it.

8.	Unlock your deadbolt and tell the Lockitron app on your smart device 
that it is unlocked.
9.	Slide the Lockitron rubber insert over the deadbolt’s knob and line it 
up with the inner notches of Lockitron’s main body.
10.	Line the knob on the Lockitron faceplate with the deadbolt’s knob and 
snap it into place.
	Done! All that’s left to do is give the whole thing a try using the Lockitron 
app, as shown in Figure 7-13.
Now that your Lockitron is in place, there are a few things you should know 
that it can do:
✓
✓Share access to your home by having others download the Lockitron 
app and use the codes you give them.
✓
✓Lockitron can automatically lock and unlock doors, depending on your 
phone’s proximity to it.
✓
✓Lockitron will tell you when someone is knocking on your door.
✓
✓Receive notifications whenever anyone enters or leaves your home.
✓
✓For $5 a month, you can set up Lockitron to use SMS text messages to 
lock and unlock. This is for those in your circle of trusted individuals 
who don’t have a smart device on which to download the Lockitron app.
✓
✓Batteries can last up to six months before needing replacement. If they 
give up the ghost before you can replace them, don’t sweat it: Just use 
the knob on the inside of your home and use the key on the outside 
(don’t worry, it’s only temporary).

Kwikset
If you’ve ever gone shopping for locks in a hardware store, you’ve run into 
the good products at Kwikset. Kwikset has been doing locks for a long time, 
and it’s got a new one that has folks talking: the Kevo.
Kevo is a deadbolt that is smart enough to work with your smart devices 
to secure your home. It has lots in common with other locks that I discuss 
throughout this chapter:
✓
✓Share ekeys (electronic keys) with other folks in your life so they can 
gain access to your home.
✓
✓Use your smartphone or tablet to gain access to your lock: no key 
required.
✓
✓Key fobs can be used to gain access if you or someone you want to have 
access doesn’t have a supported smartphone.
✓
✓You can use a real honest-to-goodness physical key if you like.
✓
✓The Kevo app, shown in Figure 7-14, allows you to control your home’s 
access, view a history of folks who have come and gone, change ekeys, 
send ekeys, and more.
August Smart Lock versus Lockitron
First, believe me when I say that I have no 
dog in this fight. I think both products are very 
good at what they do. However, they are both 
similar in their approach to automating locks, 
in that they work with your currently installed 
deadbolt. On the plus side for August, its Smart 
Lock seems to be a much cleaner approach 
and is much more visually appealing. On the 
minus side for August, coming to market with-
out Wi-Fi access is not the best idea in my 
humble opinion. Positives for Lockitron are 
that Wi-Fi is included out of the box and this 
solution seems to make more sense for those 
who travel a lot and want to take their locks 
with them, or for those who are renting. (The 
Lockitron won’t damage the current dead-
bolt hardwire.) A negative for Lockitron has 
to be its outward appearance. While not just 
straight-up ugly, it doesn’t seem to fit the stan-
dard design for door hardware; to be honest, 
it sticks out like a sore thumb, but I still like 
the device. This one basically comes down to 
what features you deem the most important to 
you at decision time.

130
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Kevo does have some features that set it apart from the other locks in this 
chapter, though:
✓
✓A colored light ring around the keyhole of the Kevo indicates when actions 
are taking place or when the system needs to alert you to something, 
such as low battery life. The Kevo support site includes a video, along 
with written details that explain the functionality of the lights and what 
the ­different colors mean. You can access that information by going here: 
www.kwikset.com/kevo/support/articles/200732416-What-do-
the-colors-on-the-light-ring-mean-.
✓
✓Kevo is pick-resistant and bump-proof.
✓
✓Kwikset’s SmartKey technology makes it easy for owners to rekey their 
own locks.
✓
✓Grant access to as many users as you can come up with, and grant 
­different levels of access to them all on a case-by-case basis.
✓
✓Kevo’s Inside-Outside technology is a real boon, preventing anyone who 
is unauthorized to unlock the door when authorized users, with their 
phone or key fob on them, come into range on the inside of the door.


 Chapter 7: Safe, Sound, and Hunkered Down
In other words, if someone knocks on your door and you walk up to it 
while inside your home, your Kevo won’t automatically unlock for the 
person on the outside. You must calibrate your fobs and phones in 
order for this functionality to enable, but a little extra time when install-
ing and setting up your Kevo is well worth it these days.
One thing I haven’t told you is how Kevo unlocks your door. Yes, you can 
use a key, but what about when you have a fob or an authorized phone? 
Simply walking within range of the Kevo, which you see along with a fob 
in Figure 7-15, won’t lock or unlock the deadbolt. A user must first touch 
the lock with his or her finger, prompting the Kevo to look for authorized 
devices in the vicinity. Once Kevo recognizes an authorized user, the door 
unlocks or locks, as the case may be.
The Kevo smart lock is a great device, and has won numerous awards 
because of Kwikset’s level of attention to detail and functionality. It comes in 
three finishes, so it’s sure to match your home’s decor, too. You can get your 
hands on a Kevo by ordering one from several online stores (or by visiting 
the brick-and-mortar stores):

✓Amazon

✓Apple

✓Build.com

T
 
rekkie (or is it Trekker?) or not, you’ve most likely seen how the folks 
on board the U.S.S. Enterprise get their nachos and cheese: just push 
a button and — voila! — a steaming pile of crunchy nachos smothered in 
melted cheese.
Okay, I honestly can’t recall ever seeing a character on any of the Star Trek 
episodes or movies eating nachos, but I can’t claim to have watched them 
all, either. Plus, I understand that nachos and cheese is considered an under-
ground delicacy on Vulcan, but those who indulge in the yummy crunchies 
won’t admit to it.
The idea of a food replicator has both intrigued and terrified food lovers for 
decades. Popular shows like Star Trek and The Jetsons made it look to be 
truly the simplest of tasks, and the characters at least acted as though they 
enjoyed the “food stuff” it produced for them, so why not? Cooking would 
just be one less thing to bother with, right? Well, actually some folks would 
say no to such tech, because cooking is a pure joy, and even therapeutic in 
some cases, for many people.
But let’s be honest: Although the replicator may not be ideal for many of us, 
we do love it when gadgets come along that help the cooking process to go a 
bit smoother. This is especially true when one is working late or has a family 
to prepare a meal for.
Chapter 8

136
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
How about automating some of your cooking? Well, that’s the subject I tackle 
in this chapter, but have no fear, dear reader. None of the devices I discuss 
produce some kind of foodlike substance, unless, of course, that’s what you 
put into them.
Cooking Without Being in the Kitchen, 
and Other Kitchen Awesomeness
I need to go ahead and burst the bubble on this idea: No, remotely and auto-
matically performing some cooking tasks doesn’t mean that you’ll be able  
to outfit your kitchen with robotic arms that will whir about your kitchen, 
grabbing ingredients from here and there, throwing them all together and 
then placing the whole thing in the oven. I’m not sure you would want such 
a contraption anyway, especially if you have pets or small children; things 
could get a bit dicey.
However, home automation and smartphones and tablets are making the 
kitchen a place where things can get done faster and simpler than ever, as 
you’re about to find out.
If you’re already saying, “What good is any of this if it can’t do it all for me, 
without requiring me to step into the kitchen, much less even lift a finger?” 
then this chapter might not be for you. But if you are truly intrigued by how 
today’s kitchen technology can help better your life, here are a few good 
­reasons to proceed:
✓
✓You’re running behind because of heavy traffic, and the kids are texting 
and calling, barely able to speak because they are so weak from waiting 
for you to cook something (never mind they just ate a snack two hours 
ago). When you get home, you’ll just toss a pizza in the oven, but it takes 
longer for your oven to preheat than it does to cook the pizza. Hang up 
on the kids, open up your oven’s app, and begin preheating the oven 
while you’re sitting in traffic. Hopefully, none of the kids will pass out 
before the pizza’s ready, but at least you’ll lower the chances with this 
little trick.
✓
✓You’ve set your oven to begin cooking at a certain time, but your flight is 
running late (as usual). The answer to this problem is to open an app on 
your iOS or Android tablet and change the schedule. Done.
✓
✓You want to preheat your oven remotely, but you can’t remember the 
correct temperature. No worries; your oven can recall the recipe that 
you uploaded to it and set the correct temp by itself.

✓The kids call and tell you the milk has ice floating in it. Adjust your 
refrigerator and freezer temperatures from work without getting up.

✓How neat would it be to have your refrigerator keep up with the  
items inside of it? And even neater, what if it would alert you on your 
smartphone or tablet when it was time to buy more butter?
These are but a few of the benefits of automating the most important room 
in your home, the kitchen. Another benefit of the automated kitchen comes 
from the tried and true adage, “nobody’s happy unless momma’s happy.” If 
momma knows how to use a smart device, rest assured she’ll be happy with 
outfitting her kitchen with devices that can communicate with it.

Automation Chefs
With home automation on the rise around the world, the best-known appli-
ance makers are already on the ball developing products that are not only 
practical for the kitchen but also tie into today’s Wi-Fi and Internet lifestyle. 
The wave of smart devices has also given rise to new companies that have 
innovative ideas on transforming old technology into things useful to those 
of us who are beginning to get used to the mobile way of doing stuff. Time 
to meet a few of the companies, both old and new, vying to better your lives 
through bettering your kitchen.
Crock-Pot with WeMo
Before you know it, Belkin’s WeMo will have its hands into just about every 
kind of device you can think of. It’s already working with light bulbs and 
humidifiers, and now it’s in the kitchen with its partnership with one of your 
mother’s and her mother’s favorite cooking appliances: the Crock-Pot. Crock-
Pot slow cookers have been around for more than 40 years, and with the 
inclusion of WeMo, they’ve stepped into the connected world and appear to 
be headed for another 40-plus years (at least) in the world’s kitchens.
The Crock-Pot Smart Slow Cooker, shown in Figure 8-1, is enabled with WeMo 
technology, which means you can control it from your smartphone or tablet 
using the WeMo app.

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
As you already know, convenience is the key to a good home automation 
device, and this one certainly fits the bill. Sure, you have to put the ingre-
dients into the cooker, but that’s a given until the day comes when kitchen 
robots can do that part of the job.
Crock-Pot’s WeMo-enabled slow cooker sports the following features:
✓
✓6-quart capacity, which is plenteous, to say the least.
✓
✓Enables you to adjust cooking time and temperature, set your food 
to warm only, or simply turn the cooker off. You can do this from the 
cooker itself or via the WeMo app.
✓
✓And more typical Crock-Pot goodness:
•	Cool-to-the-touch handles.
•	Cord storage on the side of the cooker.
•	Dishwasher-safe lid and stoneware.
If you’ve ever tasted the goodness that comes from a slow cooker, you don’t 
need me to talk you into this one. If you’ve never eaten a roast, chicken, or 
anything else from a slow cooker, I implore you — nay, I beseech thee — 
please do so now. Do not go through life depriving yourself of one of the 
modern kitchen’s true joys.
If you find yourself in the market for a slow cooker, check out www. 
crock-pot.com/wemo-landing-page.html and give the Crock-Pot Smart 
Slow Cooker some serious thought.

I think I know what’s for dinner in the Spivey home tonight. I just typed 
myself into some slow-cooked “deliciosity.”
LG
Chapter 5 explains how LG’s Smart ThinQ washer and dryer can fit right into 
the automated home, but LG wants to occupy your kitchen, too. The com-
pany applied Smart ThinQ technology to a refrigerator and an oven, bringing 
those appliances to life for you and your family, too.
Smart ThinQ helps you connect with your refrigerator and oven via your 
Wi-Fi network and the Internet. No matter where you are, as long as you have 
an Internet connection you can control your appliance from your smartphone 
or tablet, and you will receive alerts about those smart devices, too.
Smart ThinQ Refrigerator
The Smart ThinQ Refrigerator connects to your home’s Wi-Fi so that it can 
communicate with you wherever inside or outside the home you may be. 
There are several reasons to call this refrigerator “smart”:
✓
✓Keep track of what food is in your refrigerator, using the built-in touch-
screen display (see Figure 8-2) or the Smart Access app on your smart 
device.
✓
✓Be alerted to food expiration dates on your smart device or from the 
touchscreen.
✓
✓Use the touchscreen to create a shopping list, which is sent to your 
smartphone or tablet for convenience.
✓
✓Discover new Food Channel recipes based on what ingredients your 
refrigerator knows it already contains.
✓
✓Send your chosen recipe to your Smart ThinQ Range so that it can begin 
heating up for action.
✓
✓Customize the touchscreen by uploading favorite pictures to it.
✓
✓Check the weather using the weather app on the touchscreen, or check 
your schedule using the calendar feature. I have to say, though, that nei-
ther of these features sells the refrigerator. You can already do this with 
your smart device or computer anyway. I don’t know many folks who 
will hang out to read the fridge’s weather report, but I could certainly be 
wrong. Believe me, if these two items are what tilts you in favor of the 
Smart ThinQ, there are other technology issues we need to resolve for 
you before you start thinking about a smart refrigerator.

I would advise heading on over to www.lg.com/us/discover/smart-
thinq/refrigerator.jsp to learn more, or head out to your nearest LG 
appliance dealer to see one in action firsthand.
Oh, and yes, it does keep your food cold, too.
Smart ThinQ Range
You’ve got that shiny new Smart ThinQ Refrigerator sitting over there full of 
food; now you need something equally as smart to cook that food, right?
LG’s Smart ThinQ Range, which you can see in Figure 8-3, makes the perfect 
companion to the refrigerator, and I don’t mean just because they come from 
the same company and have stainless steel looks. The Smart ThinQ devices 
really do work with one another, making things that much more convenient.
LG has packed this range with the great cooking technology you would 
expect from a high-end device:
✓
✓Faster cooking times
✓
✓A huge 6.3 cubic feet capacity
✓
✓Convection heating
✓
✓Infrared grilling
✓
✓An element dedicated to fast boiling times

What really makes this a smart range, though, is its capability to connect to 
you, and you to it, through your home’s Wi-Fi and the Internet. You can use 
the Smart Access Range app to:
✓
✓Set cooking times and temps.
✓
✓Check on your food as it cooks.
✓
✓See when the oven is in use.
✓
✓Make sure everything is off.

Whirlpool
Whirlpool is one of the tried and true brands that we all are familiar with. It’s 
been around as long as it has for a good reason: It’s one of the best at what it 
does, and that’s making appliances. Whirlpool also is obviously very forward-
thinking, as it’s moving ahead with connecting its appliances to your Wi-Fi 
and smart devices.
Whirlpool’s foray into smart appliances starts with a refrigerator and a 
dishwasher. Each appliance uses Whirlpool’s 6th Sense Live Technology

to ­communicate with your home’s Wi-Fi network, and you can monitor and 
­control it from your iOS or Android smart device. You can also view the 
appliance from a web browser on your favorite computer.
Whirlpool Smart Side-by-Side Refrigerator  
with 6th Sense Live Technology
Whirlpool incorporates its 6th Sense Live Technology into its Smart refrigera-
tor (see Figure 8-4) so that you can know, via the My Smart Appliances app, 
what’s going on with your fridge at all times.
The 6th Sense Live tech notifies you of the goings-on of your fridge through 
what Whirlpool dubs Smart Nudges and Smart Alerts. Smart Nudges are 
friendly reminders that something minor is going on, such as someone leav-
ing the fridge door open. Smart Alerts, though, barge in and tell you when 
something is really wrong with your fridge, such as the power being out.
What’s better, the smart fridge helps you monitor the energy you’re using to 
keep things cool, and will even tell you an estimate of how much your energy 
costs will be for the device. This feature will at least give you more “real-
time” information than the little tag that’s on the refrigerator when you see it 
in a store.
Whirlpool Smart Dishwasher with 6th Sense Live Technology
How would you like your dishwasher to tell you when the washing cycle is 
over? Or when someone opens the door on it? Whirlpool’s Smart Dishwasher 
will tell you that whether you’re close by or far away, using the My Smart 
Appliances app, shown in Figure 8-5.

GE
General Electric has been in the appliance ball game for quite the while, and 
that’s probably a huge understatement. Everyone is familiar with the GE logo; 
it’s a cultural icon, instantly recognizable for most folks who weren’t raised

GE is known for quality products, and the company’s braving the waters 
of the connected smart home with its Brillion technology. As of this writ-
ing, GE has only three types of appliances on the Brillion team: single-wall

The Brillion app is available for iOS and Android smart devices. As GE 
releases more Brillion-enabled devices, I’m certain the app will be updated 
with the capability to control their features. For now, though, the Brillion 
app, shown in Figure 8-7, is very good at what it does: controlling your single-

✓Be alerted when food is finished cooking.
✓
✓Start cooking remotely.
✓
✓Adjust temperatures and cooking times on the fly.
✓
✓Control top and bottom sections of a double-wall oven.
GE takes the security of your networked appliances seriously. It has built 
security functions into its Brillion-enabled appliances, and is working hard

iDevices
iDevices is one of those companies that sprang up with the advent of the 
smartphone. Since the company’s introduction of the iGrill in 2009, iDevices 
has taken off, introducing a series of smart cooking devices that are catch-
ing on at an amazing rate. And with Apple’s announcement of HomeKit (see 
Chapter 14 for more on that), iDevices is ramping up for even more home 
automation goodness.
iGrill
The iGrill was the brainchild of iDevices founder Christopher Allen way 
back in the dinosaur days of 2009. iGrill has since garnered the praises and 
attention of folks ranging from professional grilling teams, such as the 
Smokin’ Hoggz BBQ Competition team, to the weekday morning stages of 
NBC’s Today show.
iGrill 2

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
I’m glad you asked! iGrill is the dream of every person who’s ever grilled meat 
or vegetables on a grill of any kind. iGrill (shown in one of its latest incarna-
tions as the iGrill 2 in Figure 8-8) is a thermometer for your grill, and there 
isn’t another like it anywhere.
Figure 8-8: 
iGrill 2 will 
keep an 
eye on the 
grill for you, 
freeing you 
up to work 
on other 
food you 
might be 
preparing.

iGrill 2 communicates with your smartphone via Bluetooth, which is a 
­communication protocol that creates local wireless networks between two 
devices running it — in this case, your iOS or Android Bluetooth-enabled 
smartphone or tablet and the iGrill 2.
Here’s how iGrill makes your grilling life even sweeter than it already is:
1.	Fire up your grill and get it good and hot!
2.	Prepare your meat for cooking.
3.	Insert the iGrill temperature probes into the thickest part of the food 
you’re cooking.
4.	Connect the temp probes to the iGrill 2.
5.	Make sure that Bluetooth is turned on for your smart device.
6.	Power on your iGrill 2.
7.	Open the iDevices Connected App on your smart device and select iGrill 2 
from the Devices Manager. The iGrill 2 automatically pairs up with your 
smart device.

147

 Chapter 8: Home, Home on the Automatic Range: The Automated Kitchen
8.	In the iDevices Connected App, select the type of meat you’re cooking 
and the desired temperature.
Do not place your iGrill 2 on the surface of the grill or on any surface that is 
too hot for you to touch. While the probes are meant to withstand the heat, 
the iGrill 2 itself can take only so much before going belly up.
“I’ve already got a food thermometer, so why in the world do I need this 
little guy?”
I’m glad you asked that, too, dear reader!
It’s at this point that iGrill 2 shows its quality. Snap up your smart device 
and walk away. That’s right, I said walk away. There’s no need to hover over 
your grill with a food thermometer in hand, poking holes in the meat every 
couple of minutes to see what the temperature is (although you might need 
to flip it occasionally). iGrill 2 monitors the internal temperature of the meat 
for you, and you can keep track of it from the iDevices Connected APP (see 
Figure 8-9). What’s more, when the meat reaches the temperature you set 
back in Step 8, the app will notify you that it’s time to snatch the perfectly 
cooked meat off the grill and dig in (it might not put it in those terms, but 
you get my drift).
The iGrill 2 comes with two temperature probes, but if you’re a pro or have a 
large number of folks to feed, you can add up to two more probes. Of course, 
if you need more, you can always get another iGrill 2 . . .
iGrill mini
iDevices has another iGrill that will meet the needs of people who live alone 
or those who don’t grill more than a few pieces of meat at a time: the iGrill 
mini. The iGrill mini uses the iDevices Connected App to report temps to 
your smart device, just like the iGrill 2. But unlike the iGrill 2, iGrill mini only 
supports one temp probe.
iGrill mini has a really cool feature to help you keep tabs on how soon your 
meat will be done. The LED light on top of the iGrill mini changes colors 
based on the meat’s temp:
✓
✓Green means you’re just getting started.
✓
✓Yellow lets you know you’re about 15 degrees away.
✓
✓Orange tells you when you’re 5 degrees from the temperature you need.
✓
✓Red means it’s time to eat!

148
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
The iGrill mini, shown in Figure 8-10, is able to detect when you’re too far 
away to see its LED light (based on the proximity of your smart device), at 
which time it will go into a low power mode and won’t display the colors. 
Saving battery power is saving wallet power, and that’s always good.

iGrill is good for smoking, too
iGrill is not only for grillers, but also for folks 
who prefer to smoke their meats. iDevices sells 
an ambient temperature probe that sits in your 
smoker or your grill to detect the temperature 
within it. Using the iDevices Connected App, 
you set the minimum and maximum tempera-
tures for your smoking session, and iGrill will 
notify you if temperatures drop below it or get 
too high. The ambient temperature probe works 
with both the iGrill 2 and iGrill mini.

 Chapter 8: Home, Home on the Automatic Range: The Automated Kitchen
Kitchen Thermometer
While iDevices do great on the grill, they are equally as great in the kitchen. 
iGrill is the choice when grilling or even smoking your favorite meats, but 
when it comes to working in the kitchen, the iDevices Kitchen Thermometer, 
shown in Figure 8-11, is where it’s at.
The Kitchen Thermometer (the name says it all, doesn’t it?) works like the 
iGrill, in that it uses temperature probes inserted into the meat you’re cooking 
to keep up with internal temps. The difference: It is designed for cooking in the 
home, not outside in the elements (you do grill in the snow and rain, right?).
Figure 8-10: 
While only 
able to use 
one temp 
probe at a

of us.

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
The Kitchen Thermometer supports up to two temperature probes, so you 
can either use it to monitor two different meats at the same time, or to make 
sure that something large, like a good-sized turkey, cooks evenly.
Again, the iDevices Connected App is how you stay in touch with your 
meat’s temps if you’re away from the Kitchen Thermometer, which also uses 
Bluetooth to communicate with your iOS or Android smart device. If you’re 
near the Kitchen Thermometer, though, you can just use its touch interface 
to see the temperatures being reported by one or both probes.
When cooking, a real foodie might want to share the dish he’s been working­ 
over for the last hour or more. Well, the iDevices Connected App allows you 
to do that with ease. You can share your culinary creations with other 
­iDevices users via the iDevices community, or you could use your social 
media accounts to do your braggin’, as shown in Figure 8-12.
The iDevices Connected App also lets you see what others in the iDevices 
community are cooking up, and helps find great new recipes for you to try. 
And you get all this for free with the app. Can’t beat that!

The Kitchen Thermometer mini
The Kitchen Thermometer mini is to the Kitchen Thermometer what the iGrill 
mini is to the iGrill 2: a smaller, but still very powerful and fun-to-use version 
of its big brother.
The Kitchen Thermometer mini supports only one temperature probe, and it 
also uses the same LED lighting method as the iGrill mini when you are near 
it: green telling you it’s just getting going and red letting you know it’s done, 
while yellow and orange fit in the middle, letting you know when cooking is 
nearing completion.
The Kitchen Thermometer mini, shown hard at work in Figure 8-13, also uses 
the iDevices Connected app to communicate with you from a distance. You 
also use the app to select a target temperature for the KT mini.
A great feature of all the iDevices thermometers, iGrill’s included, is that they 
can mount on metal surfaces with a built-in magnet. I know it sounds like no 
big deal at first, but when your countertops and your stovetop are covered 
with cooking utensils, dishes, and other assorted cooking “stuffs,” being able 
to mount the thermometer to the side of the oven or some other surface is a 
bonus. The probes are stored in wraps, which are also magnetized, so when 
you go to store your iDevices thermometer you can just stack the probe 
wraps onto it and keep everything organized and in one spot. The iDevices 
folks are thinking this stuff through, people. Great job!

One more thing
My Mamaw can make fudge and other candy like nobody’s business, and my 
mom learned how to do it just as well from cooking with her. While they both 
are still flawless with their confections, I’ll bet they both would love to get their 
hands on another little doodad from the folks at iDevices: its Pro Candy Probe.
The Pro Candy Probe (see Figure 8-14) is a probe designed specifically for 
gauging the temperature in candies as they’re cooking. This little wonder 
takes the guesswork out of the temps needed to make perfect candies. Pro 
Candy Probe works with the iGrill and Kitchen Thermometer line of devices, 
including the mini versions of both.
This probe isn’t just for candy making, though: It can also be used to moni-
tor the temperatures in frying oils! Grandmama Spivey would have loved 
this thing, too! I think the designers and engineers at iDevices must have had 
their mothers and grandmothers in mind when they created this probe.
Pro Candy Probe can be found on the iDevices store, along with a lot of  
other accessories, including additional temperature probes: http://store.

This unfortunate scenario could have been avoided entirely had you, 
one, remembered what she said about the eggs the night before, and two, 
invested in the Quirky Egg Minder, like your best friend told you to do over 
a month ago. You see, the Egg Minder would have reminded you, via your 
iOS or Android smartphone, that the eggs were near or entirely empty, and 
you would have at the same time remembered your wife’s words, saving you 
another trip and from missing the entire first quarter of the game.
The Quirky Egg Minder, shown in Figure 8-15, is the brainchild of one Rafael 
Hwang, and it is saving folks from similar scenarios the world over. Here’s how:
1.	Purchase your Egg Minder.
2.	Turn on the Egg Minder once you get it (there’s a switch on the bottom).
3.	Download the Wink app on your iOS or Android device (if you don’t 
already have it) and open it.
4.	Click Add a New Device in the Wink app.
5.	Find the house icon on the top of the Egg Minder; it should be blinking 
orange.
6.	Start the countdown when prompted in the Wink app and hold your 
smartphone right over the blinking orange house icon on the Egg Minder.
7.	Once the Egg Minder has been registered with your Wink app, you’ll 
hear a chime and will be greeted by “Success!” on the smartphone.
8.	Place your eggs into the Egg Minder and place the lid on top.
9.	When you’re ready to use some eggs, take the lid off the Egg Minder 
and a light near the oldest egg will blink. That’s the egg you should start 
with so that you’re using the oldest eggs first. Whenever you remove the 
oldest egg, the light near the next oldest egg will blink, and so on it goes.

▶Detecting leaks before they get out of hand
▶
▶Wading through automated water-monitoring products
I
 
n my experience, there aren’t many monthly bills that elicit as much of a 
jolt response as that of an unexpectedly high water bill. When other bills, 
such as electric or natural gas, are high, the reason is almost always that 
you simply consumed more than usual of the resource. But when it comes to 
water, the mind immediately starts racing:
✓
✓Is there a leak somewhere?
✓
✓Are the kids taking hour-long showers?
✓
✓Is the neighbor using our water hose to fill his pool again?
While each of those is troublesome, water leaks tend to strike the most 
terror into the heart of a homeowner. You scramble around the house, 
checking every pipe, fixture, commode, and spigot for that steady “drip . . . 
drip . . . drip . . .” that causes you to grip your wallet ever so tightly.
This chapter discusses water usage and how you can use today’s technology 
to not only keep an eye out for leaks (and therefore prevent the subsequent 
damage), but also how to keep tabs on your daily use of one of the most  
precious resources.

Watching Your Water Usage
Few things are as important to people on a daily basis as water, and that 
is no stretch of the truth. Water is so much a part of daily life that humans 
simply don’t think about it much until it’s time to pay for it or they are  
without it. This section examines the need for monitoring your usage of 
water, as well as how you can go about it.
The why’s of monitoring water
Take a moment to think seriously about the role that water plays in your life 
and how much you actually use it. Some of your most basic daily activities 
involve water:
✓
✓You drink water every day, in some form or another. Even if you don’t 
pour yourself a glass of cold water, it’s near a guarantee that if you drink 
a liquid it will include some level of water. Iced tea, coffee, soft drinks, 
and even adult beverages all contain some measure of water in them.
✓
✓You wash your dishes, clothes, cars, and your body with water.
✓
✓Water keeps crops from drying up, thereby keeping you not only 
hydrated, but also fed.
✓
✓You use water when you go to the restroom, both in the toilet and when 
you (hopefully) wash your hands.
✓
✓You brush your teeth and rinse with water.
✓
✓You incorporate water into your leisure activities, whether at the beach 
or simply in the backyard with a water hose.
Water enriches people’s lives in countless other ways every day. Suffice to 
say, it’s probably a good idea to keep an eye on how much of this incredible 
resource you use. Not only do you want to maintain this resource, but you 
also want to maintain your monthly budgets (water’s not expensive, but it 
isn’t free either).
Coming at this from another viewpoint, for as much as people benefit from 
water, it can also be very damaging if not kept in check. Water damage in a 
home can be catastrophic, leading to expensive fixes, the loss of a home, or 
even personal injury. Finding a water leak too late can be devastating to a 
homeowner’s pocketbook and even lead to health issues caused by mold and 
mildew. Knowing when a leak first occurs can prevent a world of problems.

 Chapter 9: Monitoring Water Use and Detecting Leaks
So, water should be monitored for two main reasons:
✓
✓Discover inordinate amounts of water usage to prevent waste and  
unexpectedly high monthly bills.
✓
✓Make yourself aware of leaks before serious damage can be inflicted on 
your property.
The how’s of monitoring water
The best way for you to monitor water usage (call it Plan A) is to station 
one member of your household, armed with a walkie-talkie, at every major 
water outlet. Place your spouse in the master bath, your oldest daughter at 
the spigot in the backyard, your son next to the kitchen sink, your youngest 
daughter should spy the washing machine hoses, and grandma can man the 
bathroom in the front of the house.
Okay, I sense that some of you might be objecting to that plan for one reason 
or another, so let’s move on to Plans B and C.
Plan B consists of detection devices that discover leaks and report them to 
you instantly via text, email, or some other notification on your smartphone, 
tablet, or computer. These devices are simple sensors that detect the pres-
ence of water where it shouldn’t be, and they report the moisture to a smart 
hub or similar device, which then relays the problem to you.
Plan C employs the help of a “smart” water meter that tracks real-time water 
usage and reports it to your smartphone, tablet, or computer. Through the 
use of an app, you can see the amount of water that you’re using on a daily 
basis, and review various statistics, such as an estimate of your monthly bill 
or comparisons of monthly water usage.
The upcoming section details companies that excel in monitoring water in 
such ways, and will free your family members from their duties outlined in 
Plan A earlier in this chapter.
Assessing the Water Monitoring Mavens
Several companies monitor water usage and detect leaks, but many of 
them are either not the most user friendly or are geared more toward 
industrial uses for their technologies. Those that I discuss in this ­section 

158
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
are aiming to benefit homeowners with brilliant new technologies that 
make the chore of water monitoring almost entertaining, for lack of a 
better description.
Wally
The name “Wally” may bring your thoughts to the gentle robotic fellow 
of Pixar fame, but the two don’t bare any resemblance. No, the Wally I’m 
discussing with you, shown in Figure 9-1, will spare you from many a water-
leakage headache, not entertain you in the movie theater.

Wally’s hub 
and sensors

Wally, a product by the good people at SNUPI Technologies, serves one  
purpose in life: to warn you about any water leaks in your home. Wally  
performs its only job quite well, and feels right at home within your home 
automation environment.
Wally does its job through the assistance of its own smart hub and sensors 
that you place in areas of your home most likely to experience a water leak. 
The sensors report detected water to the hub, and the hub notifies you 
with a text or an email. The sensors communicate with the hub through 
the copper electrical wiring that already exists in your home, and their 

159

 Chapter 9: Monitoring Water Use and Detecting Leaks
­batteries can last for up to ten years. Wally’s sensors report on the tempera-
ture, humidity, and moisture of the area in which they’re placed.
I implore you to visit www.wallyhome.com to learn about Wally and how 
it works. Click the Buy Now link in the upper-right area of the page to go 
to the Wally Store. Once there, you can purchase WallyHome, which is the 
basic Wally starter kit. WallyHome includes everything you need to get 
started:
✓
✓One hub
✓
✓Six sensors
✓
✓One power cord
✓
✓One Ethernet cable
You can also purchase individual sensors or multipacks of sensors after, or 
in addition to, your initial WallyHome purchase. The hub can communicate 
with up to 1,024 sensors (wow!), so you most likely won’t have to worry 
about needing too many sensors.
SNUPI Technologies is the company behind Wally, and it’s the SNUPI tech 
that makes the whole thing click. SNUPI stands for Sensor Nodes Utilizing 
Powerline Infrastructure. For those of you who really want to know the inner-
workings of the tech in your WallyHome units, go to www.wallyhome.com, 
click the How It Works link near the upper-right area of the page, scroll all the 
way down the next page, and click the Download Whitepapers button to get a 
PDF detailing the technology.
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the main way that you actually interact 
with Wally: through the Wally app. The Wally app, shown in Figure 9-2, not 
only alerts you (in detail, I might add) to water leaks, but also:
✓
✓Instructs you on the best areas of your home to place your Wally sen-
sors.
✓
✓Allows you to make sensitivity adjustments to the sensors.
✓
✓Enables you to activate and deactivate sensors.
✓
✓Helps you keep track of multiple Wally hubs and sensors in more than 
one location (such as a vacation home or your office).
You can also administer your My Wally account(s) from the Wally app, along 
with several other tasks.

Driblet
The folks at Driblet have two lofty goals: They want to help you and the 
world save money and water. For some, the idea of saving money may 
trump that of conserving water, and for others, the main concern is the 
­conservation of nature’s most precious resource. I think most people’s pref-
erences fit somewhere in the middle: They recognize the immense impor-
tance of water to daily life, but the need to keep money in the bank ranks 
pretty high, too. Regardless of your personal motivations, Driblet is a com-
bination hardware/software product that will help you achieve both. Mind 
you, Driblet will not control the amount of water you use; Driblet alerts you 
to how much water you are using, helping you to create better water habits 
in your daily routines.
The hardware part of Driblet is a smart meter that connects to water pipes 
in your home, such as a showerhead (see Figure 9-3) or a sink. Driblet keeps 
track of how much water is passing through the meter and sends this infor-
mation to cloud-based servers.
Figure 9-2:  
The Wally 
app allows 
you to keep 
tabs on all 
your Wally 
sensors.

161

 Chapter 9: Monitoring Water Use and Detecting Leaks
A few things to note regarding the Driblet meter:
✓
✓The meter is self-powering, using the water that passes through it to 
generate power. There’s never a need for batteries or to charge the 
meter. How cool is that?
✓
✓You can connect the meter to any half-inch pipe.
✓
✓The meter measures not only the amount of water passing through, but 
also its temperature.
✓
✓The meter communicates with Driblet’s cloud-based servers through 
your Wi-Fi connection.
This is where the software part of Driblet kicks in: The information collected 
by the meter can be accessed through your favorite web browser on a com-
puter or by using the Driblet app on your smartphone or tablet. At this point, 
you can monitor your water consumption from each Driblet meter in your 
home. The information is transmitted in real-time to your smartphone or 
tablet, or you can view it on your computer’s web browser.
Using the software in the app (see Figure 9-4) or on the browser, you can 
create alerts for each Driblet meter so that you will be notified when certain 
user-defined thresholds are met. For example, you can set the Driblet in your 
shower to notify you once a certain amount of water has been used. Once the 
alert has been given, you can then alert your teenager that he won’t be able 
to drain Lake Erie with the shower this time because you’re keeping an eye 
on how much water he’s using.

INSTEON
INSTEON fans, rejoice! There’s a water leak sensor tailor-made for your home 
and the INSTEON hub you’re already using.
The INSTEON Leak Sensor, which can be found at www.insteon.com/2852-
222-leak-sensor.html, is a sturdy device that does one thing and does 
it well: It detects water leaks (the name speaks for itself, no?). While it may 
seem similar in function (identical, really) to you if you already read the  
earlier Wally section of this chapter, the INSTEON Leak Sensor does have one 
very obvious advantage over similar devices: If you’ve already incorporated 
INSTEON hubs and devices into your home, then you won’t need to purchase 
a hub to begin monitoring for water leaks.

163

 Chapter 9: Monitoring Water Use and Detecting Leaks
To get started with the INSTEON Leak Sensor, follow these steps:
1.	Purchase one or more sensors at www.insteon.com, or from another 
reputable INSTEON dealer.
2.	Place the sensor in a location where it might discover a water leak. 
INSTEON recommends the following locations as potential leak 
­hazards:
•	Basements
•	Dishwashers
•	Refrigerators
•	Sinks
•	Toilets
•	Washing machines
•	Water heaters
•	Water softeners
3.	Open the INSTEON app on your smartphone or tablet, and follow the 
on-screen instructions for adding the sensor to your INSTEON hub.
4.	Configure the app to alert you when the sensor detects a water leak.
Your INSTEON Leak Sensor, shown in Figure 9-5, will make it easy for you 
to own it. The only time you need to check it is if it does indeed alert you 
to a leak, or ten years from now when it needs a new battery. Yes, you read 
it correctly: The INSTEON Leak Sensor only needs one AA lithium battery 
every ten years.

The Creek Watch app helps track water conditions
IBM has developed a great app that helps local 
and national watershed groups, scientists, and 
other concerned agencies keep track of water 
conditions. The app is called Creek Watch, and is 
available for download on the Apple App Store.
If you’re concerned about helping keep track 
of water conditions in your area, you can help 
by downloading the Creek Watch app to your 
iPhone or iPad and collecting four conditions 
of your water: a picture of the water body, the 
amount of trash it contains, how fast the water 
is flowing, and how much water is contained 
in the body.
Doing something so simple can go a long way 
toward keeping the earth’s water clean and 
usable for generations to come.

M
 
ost of us recall at some point being told by our parents, and espe-
cially our grandparents, how things have changed in the world and 
just how easy we have it in this day and age.
The “We Used to Walk Barefooted 10 Miles in the Snow, Uphill, Both Ways to 
Get to School” story has been passed down from generation to generation, ad 
nauseam. And sadly, I find myself repeating it to this day, faithfully passing 
the “oh, woe is my generation” torch to my kids, and most assuredly to their 
kids. Gotta keep the flame going, you know!
Although I can’t tell my kids I had to trek through the snow barefooted for 
miles, I can give them my own sordid tale of woe. You see, I can still remem-
ber the days when we had to get off the couch or chair we were sitting in 
to change the television channel (all three or four . . .). To make matters 
worse, there were these knobs labeled VHF and UHF: Turn the wrong one 
and — KABLOOEY! — you’d have to call one of the adults to come change the 
channel back from something that vaguely resembled a digital snow storm. 
Imagine the horror! I remember how my eyes welled up with tears the first 
time I saw a TV remote control in our local Montgomery Ward store. And I 
can’t begin to adequately explain the euphoria that swept through our home 
the first time we brought a remote control into our own abode. Pure. Sheer. 
Ecstasy. Period.
These days, my kids fight over whether to watch streaming video from Netflix 
or Amazon Prime, and should they watch it on the iPad or cast it to our 
Internet-enabled television using our Google Chromecast.
The times they are a-changin’.
Chapter 10

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Modernizing Home Entertainment
Most of you probably have at least vague memories of the televisions I 
describe in the introduction to this chapter, but other than having to turn 
knobs on TVs, how else has technology changed in regards to entertainment? 
I can think of a few areas:
✓
✓Remember CDs? These shiny little discs seemed like something straight 
out of Star Trek when we first saw them.
✓
✓How about cassette tapes? Or, dare I ask, 8-tracks?
✓
✓Vinyl records were the best way to listen to music for decades. (There 
was a time where you just couldn’t find vinyl anywhere, but as fate 
would have it, vinyl is making a comeback.)
✓
✓My children’s first introduction to the Sony Walkman occurred in 
summer 2014, while watching Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy in 
our local cinema. The film’s main character frequently listened to his 
Walkman so as to remind him of good things in his past.
✓
✓My grandparents had one of those ornate wooden entertainment  
consoles that included a turntable for vinyl records, an 8-track player, 
an AM/FM radio, and internal storage of records and 8-tracks, all book-
ended by a pair of really good speakers (for the time). The thing took 
up as much space as their couch. (It was probably just as heavy to 
move, too!)
Needless to say, that’s not how we roll these days.
Home entertainment today
Apple single-handedly changed entertainment forever with the advent  
of the iPod and iTunes. Ever since then, Apple and its competitors have  
transformed how you get and consume your music, books, movies, and  
even television.
You get your entertainment digitally, and in several different ways:
✓
✓Purchasing media through an online store like iTunes or Google Play
✓
✓Streaming media via Internet-connected players (or “set top boxes,” as 
some may refer to them) like Roku or Apple TV
✓
✓Subscribing to media services like Netflix and Hulu
✓
✓Buying electronic books on a Kindle or similar device

167

 Chapter 10: Smart Home Entertainment
After you acquire your entertainment of choice, you can enjoy it in several 
new ways:
✓
✓On your computer through web browsers and dedicated apps
✓
✓Using apps from various providers (such as Netflix, Amazon, or even 
television service providers, like DirecTV) on your smartphone and 
tablet, like those in Figure 10-1
✓
✓On your television using media players like Roku, Apple TV, or even a 
gaming console
✓
✓Through dedicated apps from Hulu and the like, if you have a “smart” 
Internet-enabled television

Smart home entertainment technology
Wi-Fi and the Internet are the way many folks are choosing to view or listen to 
their entertainment options these days, and this is only going to be a growing 
market. Many people (myself included), and more every single day, are saying 

168
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
goodbye to the old way of doing things (cable and satellite providers) and 
are relying on the newest technologies:
✓
✓Wi-Fi networks and Wi-Fi–enabled televisions, stereos, and speakers  
are making it easier to stream Internet content to your entertainment 
appliances.
✓
✓Subscription services, like those offered by Amazon (Amazon Prime) 
and Netflix, allow you to pay a low monthly or annual fee to enjoy  
unlimited streaming of their video content. Others, such as Pandora, 
offer free alternatives for listening to music.
✓
✓Online social media sites like YouTube (one of the three most popular 
in the world, behind only Google and Facebook) have changed the way 
people get their video fix.
✓
✓Devices, such as Google’s Chromecast, allow you to open a video or 
website on a device such as your computer or tablet and play it through 
a Wi-Fi network on your televisions.
✓
✓Many sound system manufacturers, such as Bose and Pioneer, have 
developed Wi-Fi–enabled systems that you can control with an app on 
your smartphone or tablet.
And this is how we’re doing things at the beginning of this home entertain-
ment revolution. As the tech gets smarter, so do our homes and the way we 
bring entertainment into them.
Introducing the Smart Home 
Entertainment Gurus
Some of the companies you read about in this chapter are those that have 
been in the tech game a long time and are just expanding their brand into 
today’s new frontiers. However, some of these are companies are relatively, 
and in some cases, totally new to your entertainment lexicon. Regardless, 
they all have something rather interesting to add to your home’s smart  
entertainment options.
Roomie
So you have a television, huh? And I’ll bet you probably have a cable or satel-
lite television provider, too. A top-of-the-line sound system probably hangs 
out with the television. You might even have a streaming media player so you 

169

 Chapter 10: Smart Home Entertainment
can watch Internet-based video on your TV. There’s a game console of some 
sort, as well. Don’t forget about all the other televisions and other entertain-
ment equipment scattered throughout your home.
So there you are with all your entertainment options before you. Too bad you 
can’t see or otherwise use them because of the mountain of remote controls 
that sits between you and them.
“I know how to solve this dilemma,” you confidently say, with a nod and a sly 
wink to boot: “I’ll get one of those universal remotes!”
To which I respond, “Ah, my friend, that would have been a great idea — ten 
years ago. You see, these days one universal remote won’t do the job for all 
the different devices you have. Not to mention, those remotes only work with 
infrared devices, not those that use Wi-Fi to communicate.” That’s the real 
killer: the capability to control devices that are Wi-Fi connected.
What would you say if I told you there is a remote control that could control 
all your devices, even those using Wi-Fi? That’s right, even your infrared 
ones. Well, there is: the Roomie. Roomie (see Figure 10-2) is a virtual remote. 
More accurately, Roomie is an app that you install on your iOS smartphone 
or tablet (or both), giving you access to virtual remote controls for just about 
any device you own.
No, I’m not kidding. This is for real, I promise.
Roomie even has a list of compatible devices so that you can take a gander 
to see if your home entertainment devices are supported. The list is divided 
into three sections:
✓
✓IP Compatibility lists devices that connect to your Wi-Fi network 
natively
✓
✓Infrared (IR) Compatibility lists infrared devices that you can control 
using Roomie. Infrared devices require a Roomie Blaster adapter to work.
✓
✓Serial Compatibility lists devices that connect using the RS-232 serial 
connector, which is the connector older computer monitors use to con-
nect to your computer. These devices require both a Roomie Blaster 
adapter and a Roomie Serial Cable to work with the Roomie remote.
Table 10-1 lists a small portion of device manufacturers supported by the 
Roomie remote and the types of devices they manufacture (IP, IR, or serial).
Table 10-1 is not an exhaustive list — not even close. Literally thousands of 
devices can be controlled by Roomie. Suffice it to say, no matter whether 
your home automation device is remotely modern, a little worn, or nearly 

170

 Chapter 10: Smart Home Entertainment
worn out, the odds are pretty good that it will work with Roomie. Not many 
products can purport that level of compatibility.
And Roomie can even control other home automation devices, such as your 
window shades and lighting. Told you it was good.
It’s not all wine and roses, though. The one beef I have with Roomie is that 
you can only contact its support team via email. No phone number. No 
human voice. If you need help right now, well . . . you’ll just have to wait, 
unfortunately.

Go to www.roomieremote.com to get the skinny on this great remote con-
trol alternative. Remember, click or tap on the Compatibility tab to make sure 
that your home entertainment components are supported.
Currently, Roomie is an iOS-only device (at the time of this writing). However, 
Roomie does state on its site that Android compatibility is something it hopes 
to incorporate in 2015. The company claims this has allowed the development 
process to proceed much faster than it would have had Roomie supported 
Android from the outset, and I can’t fault that argument.
Blumoo
Blumoo is another company that is providing an escape from the remote  
control blues by offering its own version of the universal remote. And this 
time, Android users aren’t excluded: Blumoo supports Android and iOS right 
out of the box.
Blumoo also goes about its business in a slightly different manner than 
Roomie. Blumoo uses Bluetooth to manage communications between  
your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet and the Blumoo base station  
(see Figure 10-3).
Figure 10-3:


 Chapter 10: Smart Home Entertainment
Since Blumoo doesn’t use Wi-Fi to communicate, that’s one less drain on your 
network’s bandwidth. Another plus is that the Blumoo won’t stop communi-
cating with your devices if your Wi-Fi isn’t working.
The Blumoo base station contains an IR (infrared) blaster that awesomely 
bounces IR commands off your walls, cabinets, and just about anything else 
it needs to in order to make your home entertainment devices jump at every 
command.
Another cool feature about Blumoo is that you can connect a speaker directly 
to the base station so you can stream music from your smart device. Connect 
the Blumoo to your home sound system and you can stream throughout the 
joint. Sweet.
The Blumoo app allows you the freedom to take control of your home theater:
✓
✓Download preconfigured virtual remotes for all your entertainment 
devices. More than 225,000 devices are supported!
✓
✓Customize the virtual remotes by moving, deleting, or adding buttons.
✓
✓Create macros that enable you to perform multiple actions with the 
touch of just one button. For example, create a macro that will power all 
your entertainment devices on or off at once.
However, the same complaint I have regarding Roomie applies here: The 
only way to get support for your Blumoo is through email. The actual quote 
I heard on one of the support videos was that you could send an email if 
you ran into problems or had questions during setup and someone “will get 
back to you shortly.” Shortly? What does that mean, exactly? A few minutes 
after you send the email? As soon as possible on the next business day if 
you happen to be setting up your Blumoo after the company’s support team 
has gone home for the evening? Believe me, I understand that Blumoo isn’t 
a company that staffs its support center 24/7. No problem. But the customer 
should at least be given a better response time than “shortly.”
Do not let my support rant deter you from checking out the Blumoo site at 
www.blumoo.com. The site actually makes for fun reading.
Logitech
“You know, Dwight,” I can hear some of you saying, “I kind of like having a 
remote control in hand. I have to deal with my smart device all day long, and I 
like feeling the heft of a remote control chock-full of actual physical buttons.”
I hear you, friend, and so does Logitech.

174
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
Logitech is the creator of the Harmony line of universal remote controls, 
and they can scratch right where you itch when it comes to your actual (as 
opposed to virtual) remote control obsession.
Harmony universal remote controls are IR only, so you won’t be able to con-
trol any Wi-Fi devices with them. For example, the Google Chromecast is a 
Wi-Fi–only device, so your Harmony remote won’t work with it.
Logitech’s Harmony devices vary in their capabilities, and therefore in price, 
but they all perform quite well in their intended roles.
The Harmony Ultimate One, seen in Figure 10-4, is the sole control you need 
to command your entertainment system.
Ultimate One features include:
✓
✓You can control up to 15 entertainment devices from just one remote.
✓
✓Button functions can be customized.
✓
✓The built-in touchscreen allows you to swipe through the menu, similar 
to your smartphone or tablet.
✓
✓It’s compatible with more than 270,000 home entertainment devices!
✓
✓It uses a charging station to recharge its batteries, so you will rarely ever 
change a battery for this remote, which is certainly a welcome change.
✓
✓You can add up to 50 favorite channels so all you need to do to change 
the channel is touch the icon for the channel you want to view.

Apple
Streaming video has been around on the Internet for quite the while, but only 
recently has it begun to be viewed on televisions and smart devices by a sig-
nificant amount of folks. This is due to the advent of streaming media devices 
that make it simple to put streaming content onto your TV.
One such device, and one of the most popular in its category, is the Apple TV 
(see Figure 10-6).

Apple TV’s features are as long as my arm:
✓
✓It supports up to 1080p HD video.
✓
✓Set up your iTunes account information to access your iTunes content 
on your television.
✓
✓Play your iTunes music on your TV or speakers.
✓
✓Access content through the apps of your favorite providers, such as:
•	Crackle
•	Disney

✓
✓Stream content from your Mac or iOS devices using AirPlay.
✓
✓View content you have stored in iCloud, such as your photos or personal 
videos.
✓
✓Watch movies you’ve created with your Mac with iMovie Theater.
✓
✓Share content that other family members have purchased using Apple’s 
Family Sharing.
✓
✓Mirror content from your other devices so that others can watch the 
action on your TV, as shown in Figure 10-7.
There’s even more to Apple TV than I have space to discuss, but you get the 
picture by now.
Apple TV simply connects to your television with an HDMI cable. Once 
they’re connected, enable Bluetooth on your iPhone or iPad and hold it close 
to the Apple TV; the Apple TV uses this momentary connection to glean your 
Wi-Fi network’s settings from the iPhone or iPad. Everything will be up and 
running in no time.
Once you have it working, you can control Apple TV using its remote con-
trol, which is included, or you can download and use the Remote app on 
your iOS smart device. Whether you’re an Apple fan or not, whether you 
have a Mac or Windows PC, you should give the Apple TV a look. Check 
it out at www.apple.com/appletv, or you can see it at your local Apple 
Store. (Other stores, such as Best Buy, also may have demos of Apple TV 
for you to see.)

178
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
The Apple Remote app does much more than just control your Apple TV. 
You can stream music directly to speakers that are attached to an Airport 
Express (a wireless network device that plugs into any outlet), synchronize 
content across devices, queue music or other videos from anywhere in the 
house, and much more. Go to www.apple.com/apps/remote to see all that 
can be done with this free app.
Roku
Founded in 2002, Roku is one of the first companies to put forth a streaming 
media player. As such, it is also one of the most popular, having sold literally 
millions of its Roku players, like the Roku 3 in Figure 10-8, over the years.
The idea is simple: Build a little box, fill it with streaming media apps from 
various outlets, connect it to the Internet and your television, and open a 
world of streaming media that is hard to beat. You’ll have thousands of tele-
vision shows and movies right at your fingertips, and you can watch them all 
whenever you feel like it.
Roku’s been at this a while, and it also doesn’t have ties to any other internal 
interests. For example, Apple wants you to use iTunes, and as such, you can 
only use Apple TV with it. There are other examples of this practice, as well, 
Figure 10-7:

but Roku doesn’t have any other interests than selling you a streaming media 
player. Roku doesn’t care what TV you use to play the video or listen to the 
music on (it also supplies music channels, not just video). More than 1,800 
channels are available for your perusal on Roku. I know that sounds like an 
amazing array of TV nirvana, and in some ways, it is (Roku gives you most of 
the main streaming channels you could hope for, with the notable exception 
of iTunes), but please understand this: The vast majority of the channels are 
jokes. Not the funny kind either, but the roll-your-eyes-and-pass-on-by-with-
a-disgusted-look kind. But that shouldn’t detract from Roku’s other shining 
features. Just don’t expect that you’ll find something for you and your family 
on every channel. Ain’t gonna happen.

You can take your Roku with you when you travel! Your Roku box remembers 
your credentials, so whenever you go somewhere that has Internet access, 
you can also hook up your Roku to a television and watch your favorites.
Roku currently offers four versions of its player:
✓
✓Roku 1
✓
✓Roku 2
✓
✓Roku 3
✓
✓Roku Streaming Stick, shown in Figure 10-9

Every Roku player comes with the following:
✓
✓1,800+ channels of streaming multimedia
✓
✓Up to 1080p HD
✓
✓Built-in Wi-Fi to stream content from your network
✓
✓Access to the Roku app for your smartphone or tablet
✓
✓A Roku remote, some with built-in headphones (depending on the  
model)
You can view a head-to-head comparison of all the Roku models so you can 
determine which best suits your needs: Just visit www.roku.com/products/
compare.
The Roku app affords you another way of controlling your Roku device. You 
can search for content and instantly send it to your Roku, switch between 
more than one Roku device, and more. But the best feature to me is that you 
can use the app as another remote (see Figure 10-10), because in a home with 
four children you’re bound to lose the physical remote at some point. With 
the Roku app, just fire up your smart device, open the Roku app, and you’re 
back in business.
Roku’s website, www.roku.com (fancy that), can answer all your Roku ques-
tions, and will also let you see the cornucopia of channels available.
Your smartphone or tablet must be using the same network as your Roku 
in order for the app to work with it. If you have a problem connecting your 
smartphone to the Roku, be sure that it’s actually on the network and not 
just using your cellular carrier’s signal for its Internet connection.

Google
Google is another of the technology big dogs that started out doing some-
thing altogether different (Internet search engine) and has morphed into a 
company that dabbles in quite a diverse range of ventures. One of those ven-
tures is into television sets.
Google stepped into the television market with the advent of Google 
TV in 2010, but that might have been better categorized as a slight mis-
step. Google TV is fading away (as of 2014), and Google has launched the 
Nexus Player running the Android TV operating system. The Nexus Player, 
shown in Figure 10-11, has a lot of promise, but since it was just released 
in November 2014, it has some catching up to do in regards to its competi-
tors. Nexus Player provides the standard apps for watching streaming 
Figure 10-10:

media, such as Netflix and Hulu, and you can cast shows from your smart 
devices to it (like Google’s own Chromecast, which I discuss next), but 
more developers need to get on board for the Player to really put a dent in 
the market.
One big thing about Nexus Player, or more accurately, the Android TV oper-
ating system, is that you will be able to use your standard Android apps with 
it. In other words, apps that you install on your Android smartphone or tablet 
can also be installed on your Android TV. This will give you tons of flexibility 
and consistency between your Android devices.
However, Google’s main attention-grabber when it comes to getting Internet 
and computer-based content to your TV is its Chromecast. The Chromecast, 
shown in Figure 10-12, is a dongle that you plug into the HDMI port on the 
back of your television.
Chromecast was an instant hit for Google. It has a small footprint and a small 
price point: $35 is all you need to start casting to your television.

 Chapter 10: Smart Home Entertainment
Chromecast is easy to set up. Follow these steps:
1.	Plug your Chromecast into one of the HDMI ports on your television.
2.	Chromecast uses USB for power, so you can either plug its USB  
connector into a USB port on your television or connect it to the USB 
power adapter and plug the adapter into a standard outlet.
3.	Go to www.google.com/chromecast/setup from any Mac or 
Windows computer, or from any iOS or Android smart device, and 
then download the Chromecast app for your device when prompted.
4.	Open the downloaded Chromecast app and follow the instructions for 
setting up your Chromecast to work with your network.
I almost forgot to mention one tiny thing: In order to cast from your Mac or 
PC, you’ll need to download and install Google’s Chrome web browser. It’s 
the only browser that can (currently) cast its content to the Chromecast. 
However, you will need to install the Google Cast extension in order to do so. 
To get and install the extension, follow these steps:
1.	Open the Chrome browser on your computer.
	The extension is not supported on mobile web browsers.
2.	Visit www.google.com/chrome/webstore and click the blue Visit 
Chrome Web Store button.
3.	Type Google Cast into the search field in the upper-left corner of the 
resulting page and press Enter or Return on your keyboard.

4.	Find Google Cast under the Extensions heading and click it.
	You may need to scroll down a bit to find it. A new window opens within 
the browser window to extol all the features that Google Cast can offer.
5.	Click the blue Free button in the upper-right area of that window to 
install the extension.
6.	Restart Google Chrome (completely quit and reopen it) to activate  
the extension.
7.	To cast the contents of a page in your Chrome browser, click the Cast 
button in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window, circled in 
Figure 10-13.
The cool part is that anything you view in the Chrome browser can be  
displayed on your television using the Chromecast.
The Chrome browser, while it is currently my favorite and the favorite of 
many a web surfer, is known as being a bit of a memory hog. When Chrome 
was first released, I loved its speed and interface, but eventually had to walk 
away because it was simply overtaking my computer’s memory. (I had this 
experience on both Macs and Windows machines.) However, I did come 
back after a few updates had been made to Chrome and have found it more 
manageable. From time to time, though, I do find myself having to restart the 
browser to reclaim huge chunks of memory. Chrome is a great browser, but 
when you first start to notice everything on your computer slowing down, 
completely quit and restart Chrome to see if that does the trick.

Bose
If you’ve ever heard Bose speakers, you’ve never forgotten the great sound 
they put out. I’m not saying other speaker makers aren’t as good as Bose, 
but I’m not sure that there are many (if any) that surpass it. Bose has been 
around for 50 years, and it is still a leading innovator in sound technology.
The Bose SoundTouch line of Wi-Fi–enabled speakers, shown in Figure 10-14,  
are wireless speakers that you can place throughout the house and wire-
lessly play your tunes on, using your iOS or Android smart device to run 
the show.

SoundTouch speakers come in three flavors, shown from left to right in 
Figure 10-14:
✓
✓SoundTouch 30 is made to fill larger spaces with rich Bose sound.
✓
✓SoundTouch 20 is designed for average-sized rooms.
✓
✓SoundTouch Portable is also for average-sized rooms, but is also por-
table, so you can take it to any room of the house with ease.
All the models share the following features:
✓
✓Connect directly to your favorite streaming music platform (such as 
Pandora, Spotify, and others) or Internet radio stations.
✓
✓Stream music from your personal music library.

186
Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
✓
✓Each model comes with six preset station options. You configure 
the stations using the SoundTouch app, which comes free with your 
SoundTouch system, and you can access stations with the press of a 
single button on the speaker itself.
✓
✓SoundTouch speakers connect to other SoundTouch speakers, creat-
ing their own speaker network throughout your home. You can play 
the same song throughout your home or play different songs on each 
speaker.
The SoundTouch app is available for iOS and Android systems. The one 
feature where iOS users will have an advantage over Android users is that 
SoundTouch speakers incorporate Apple AirPlay compatibility natively.
Check out the SoundTouch range of speakers, as well as other SoundTouch 
devices, by going to www.bose.com and clicking on the Wi-Fi Music Sys­
tems tab.
Sonos
Since I’m discussing speakers, I would be remiss not to mention the folks who 
really got the Wi-Fi speaker craze started: Sonos.
Sonos has been on top of its game, and this market segment, since 2002, and 
it shows no signs of slowing down. While competitors are continually launch-
ing products that come close, so far none have surpassed Sonos’s line of 
Wi-Fi–enabled sound systems.
Sonos offers a full range of what it calls HiFi wireless speakers to suit  
your needs:
✓
✓SUB is a wireless subwoofer that gives you as much bass as you can 
stand. The SUB, shown in Figure 10-15, pairs with any of the Sonos line 
of speakers.
✓
✓PLAY:1 is a compact speaker that delivers big sound in a small pack-
age. This little guy offers what Sonos simply labels as Loud Sound. Get 
two PLAY:1 speakers to deliver rich stereo sound in small spaces, or to 
complement a home theater system as great rear speakers.
✓
✓PLAY:3 is the Sonos speaker that delivers what the company terms as 
Really Loud Sound. This speaker is designed for average-sized rooms 
and provides a deeper level of bass than the PLAY:1, but it can also be 
used in a home theater system as a great rear speaker.

187

 Chapter 10: Smart Home Entertainment
✓
✓PLAY:5 is the big boy of the bunch, providing Crazy Loud Sound (Sonos’s 
description) and Crazy Deep Bass (also from Sonos). The PLAY:5 is 
meant for larger spaces and is designed to be the main player in your 
music system.
✓
✓Already have an existing wired music system, but want to make it wire-
less? The CONNECT:AMP connects to your system and does just that, 
allowing you to broaden your wired horizons.
✓
✓PLAYBAR, shown in Figure 10-16, is the ultimate offering from Sonos. 
This bar not only connects to your music system, but also to your televi-
sion, and the sound that issues forth from it is nearly flawless.

Part II: Automating Inside Your Home 
The entire Sonos system can be controlled from your iOS or Android smart 
device using the Sonos app. You can control as many Sonos devices as you 
like using the app, playing different songs on separate speakers, or playing 
the same tunes throughout your home.
Sonos allows you to connect your speakers directly to your Wi-Fi, but a 
feature that you’ll really love is the capability to create your own separate 
Sonos Wi-Fi network. This prevents the Sonos devices from using valuable 
bandwidth that your other wireless devices so desperately crave; it makes 
your wireless sound more stable (which Sonos devices are already known 
for being); and it extends your Sonos wireless network with every device 
you install.
Check out the Sonos website, www.sonos.com, for more information on its 
wonderful devices than I could ever pack into this chapter.
Happy listening!

Everyone complains about the weather, but nobody ever seems to  
do anything about it.
— Willard Scott
E
 
veryone loves Al Roker, and Willard Scott is simply a legend (the “Walter 
Cronkite of weather,” if you will), but sadly, most of us don’t keep tabs 
on our favorite weather personalities anymore. Mobile devices changed that 
forever.
The advent of awesome weather apps for smartphones and tablets has made 
retrieving up-to-the-minute weather information as simple as tapping an app’s 
icon on a screen. In just a few seconds, you can know what’s going on right now 
weather-wise in your hometown or in Rome, Italy (or both simultaneously, if 
Rome happens to be your hometown, but I digress). But how many times have 
you checked your favorite weather app, looked at your local weather and was 
told it was sunny and 0 percent chance of rain, only to be startled by a massive 
thunderclap and look out your window as drops of rain the size of baseballs 
hurtled toward you? Once is one time too many, if you ask some folks.
Keeping Tabs on the Weather
Some people collect baseball cards and comic books. Others listen to emer-
gency radio scanners at all hours of the night, keeping up with local law 
enforcement happenings. Still others steep themselves in sports or hobbies. 
Chapter 11

Part III: Automating Outside Your Home 
We all have our favorite pastimes, and for some of us, keeping up with the 
weather and understanding every last aspect of it is what floats our boat 
(pardon the pun).
While it might be neat to know how windy it is in Chile, or how much snow  
is falling in Siberia, what’s it like in your own neighborhood? Or your own 
backyard, or even inside your home?
“Why in the world would I want to know the weather in my own home? Isn’t 
that what the thermostat is for?”
Great question! And yes, the thermostat can tell you what the temperature is 
like — in the exact spot it’s located. However, it cannot tell you what the tem-
perature is like in your basement, or in the upstairs playroom. Knowing the 
exact temperature in a given area of your home is just one of many good rea-
sons that you’ll want to add personalized weather to your automated home. 
Here are a few more reasons for your consideration:
✓
✓Check carbon monoxide levels in your home or specific areas of it.
✓
✓Keep up with humidity levels throughout your home.
✓
✓Be informed when your plants need watering.
✓
✓Know the exact wind speeds and direction in your own backyard.
All of the preceding readings (and more) can be accomplished with today’s 
home weather stations and technology. There are even wearable items that 
can make you aware of when you’ve had enough sun. Read on to find out 
more about personal weather stations and other ways today’s technology 
can help better your life.
We have personalized music lists and customized cars. You can get a burger 
made “your way.” I think that something as important as weather is to our 
daily lives is at least as worthy of such close and personal attention and 
detail as the amount of lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles we imbibe. 
Don’t you agree?
Checking the Weather Automatically
The market for personal weather stations and other personalized weather 
apparatus (and even apparel) is surprisingly robust. I say “surprisingly,” 
because I’m willing to bet that most of us don’t even realize the market exists. 
It most certainly does exist, and it is full-to-bursting with companies that 
want to deliver up-close-and-personal weather reporting that is ­unbeatable

another when it comes to personal weather for your automated home, but to 
simply open your eyes to the many possibilities you have for bringing auto-
mated personal weather observation and forecasting to your life.
Netatmo
Netatmo has only been around since 2011, but the company has already 
earned quite a name for itself. The range of Netatmo products garners 
great reviews around the globe and the numbers of those great reviews are 
increasing quite rapidly. For our purposes, we’ll stick to just a couple of 
Netatmo products that will help keep you in the know about local and per-
sonal weather conditions.
The Netatmo Weather Station
Netatmo does personal weather, and it does so with style. One peek at the 
Netatmo Weather Station’s indoor and outdoor modules and you’ll know 
what I mean. Their slick silver aluminum cases look really great on the patio 
and on the sofa table. Blending in with your decor won’t be a problem for 
these devices, as you can tell from Figure 11-1.
You begin building your personalized weather base with Netatmo’s Urban 
Weather Station (that’s what Netatmo calls its starter kit). The box ships  
with one indoor module and one outdoor module, and a USB-adaptable 
power supply for the indoor module. (The outdoor module operates with  
two AAA batteries that last up to a year.)

Part III: Automating Outside Your Home 
The way it works is really simple, but the amount of information you can 
gather is anything but. While said info isn’t complicated, it is certainly  
in depth.
The indoor module helps you keep track of:
✓
✓Indoor temperature
✓
✓Indoor relative humidity
✓
✓Indoor air quality
✓
✓Carbon monoxide levels
✓
✓Noise meter
The outdoor module reports the following:
✓
✓Outdoor temperature
✓
✓Outdoor relative humidity
✓
✓Outdoor air quality
✓
✓Barometric pressure
✓
✓Weather
Here’s how the whole thing gets done:
1.	The outdoor module sends its information to the indoor module.
2.	The indoor module uses your Wi-Fi connection to send info from both 
modules to Netatmo’s cloud computing service. You can force an instant 
information update by pressing the top of the indoor module.
3.	You access the information in real time via the Netatmo app on your 
smartphone or tablet (see Figure 11-2), or in your favorite web browser 
(see Figure 11-3) by visiting mynetatmo.com, signing in to one or the 
other (or both, if you please) with your account information.
Windows Phone users, rejoice! Netatmo provides support for you (as well as 
for iPhone and Android users) — as long as you have Windows Phone 8.0 or 
newer installed, that is.
The indoor module can also display information on the amount of carbon 
monoxide in the room directly:
1.	Press the top of the unit to begin a manual measurement process.

2.	The long, slender light on the front of the unit will glow with one of 
the following indicators:
	
•	Green means the carbon monoxide levels are perfectly normal in  
the room.
	
•	Yellow lets you know that the carbon monoxide levels are a bit 
higher than normal.
	
• 	Red is a warning that carbon monoxide levels are too high and that 
the room should be ventilated.
Visit www.netatmo.com/en-US/product/weather-station to discover 
all that you can do with the Weather Station. There’s also a nice video on the 
site that gives an overview of the Weather Station’s features and a real-life 
perspective on how it can be used.
After you kick the tires with the Urban Weather Station starter kit, you may 
find that one indoor module isn’t enough for your needs. Should that be the 
case, you can order additional modules. For the outdoor monitor, you can 
even purchase a rain gauge that works seamlessly with your Weather Station, 
too. Just go to www.netatmo.com and click the Shop button in the upper 
right to load up your shopping cart.

The Netatmo JUNE
The preceding section explains the personal weather experience that the 
Netatmo Weather Station affords you. But wait! There’s more! Netatmo can 
get even more personal than that. How would you like to wear a beauti-
fully designed device that keeps up with how much sunlight you are being 
exposed to, warns you when it is too high, and even suggests the level of 
sunscreen protection you should be wearing to prevent sunburn? Sun wor-
shippers, prepare to beam with excitement: The Netatmo JUNE (shown being 
worn on the wrist of the person in Figure 11-4) is precisely that device.
The JUNE is a device that you can wear on your wrist much like a watch, 
using a leather or silicon band, or you can even attach it to your clothing, like 
a pendant or broach. JUNE was crafted by a professional jewelry designer  
(so you know it looks mighty nice) and comes in three colors: platinum, gold, 
and gunmetal.

The good news: JUNE keeps up with how much sunlight you’re being exposed 
to throughout the day, and it will communicate that information to you 
through your iPhone via Bluetooth. The bad news: As of this writing, the 
app does not work with Android devices. (Perhaps Netatmo will release an 
Android-friendly version in the future. We can hope for that, at least!)
The JUNE app asks you a few questions about your skin type after you first 
install it and sign in to your Netatmo account, as illustrated in Figure 11-5. 
After you’ve charged your JUNE using the USB charger it comes with, you can 
sync your JUNE with your iPhone. Once configured, your JUNE will happily 
keep you informed about your sun exposure — and what you should do to 
minimize it.
ARCHOS
ARCHOS is a French technology company that dabbles in the tablet, smart-
phone, and smartwatch markets. However, the company also has quite a 
good handle on the personal weather front (another dastardly pun I just ask 
you to excuse).
The ARCHOS Weather Station utilizes indoor and outdoor modules that sense 
the weather and other environmental factors wherever you place them, and 
they report the information back to your smartphone or tablet using the 
ARCHOS Weather app. The information is uploaded to the ARCHOS Cloud (isn’t 
the name “Cloud” great for information from weather apps?) through your 
home’s Wi-Fi connection, and can be accessed by your devices at any time.

The indoor module, shown in Figure 11-6, captures a great deal of information 
within the room or space it occupies, such as:
✓
✓Temperature
✓
✓Relative humidity
✓
✓Atmospheric pressure
✓
✓Noise level
✓
✓Air quality
The outdoor module allows you to know the temperature and relative humid-
ity on the outside of your home.
You can get instant feedback from the indoor module regarding air quality by 
simply waving your hand in front of it. The dome will light green if your air 
quality is just fine, yellow if it’s getting iffy, and red if you need to fling all the 
doors and windows in your home wide open.

 Chapter 11: Checking the Weather
So far, I’m sure you’re thinking that the ARCHOS Weather Station sounds quite 
a bit like the Netatmo Weather Station — and you’re right. They function  
similarly. But if you think about it, most products are created by more than 
one manufacturer. For example, General Motors and Honda both make cars 
that perform nearly or the same functionality, and Samsung and Sony both 
make televisions. So although both companies make similar products, you 
may prefer how one company goes about it than the other. It comes down to 
personal preference.
One thing ARCHOS does differently from Netatmo is that ARCHOS includes 
a soil module. The soil module, shown in Figure 11-7, is placed in the soil 
around your plants (yes, you can use multiple modules) to detect tempera-
ture and humidity/moisture. The module will alert you when it’s time to 
water your plants, taking the guesswork out of the tedious (at least for me) 
task. ARCHOS just may be your green thumb’s best pal.
For more information on the ARCHOS Weather Station and its modules, go 
to www.archos.com, click the Connected Objects tab, and then click the 
Weather Station link. There you’ll find a video, a photo gallery, and technical 
specifications for the modules.
AcuRite
AcuRite, owned by Chaney Instrument Company (which has been around 
since 1943), has been a purveyor of weather stations for a long time — 
long before Apple and others even knew what a smartphone or tablet was.

The AcuRite Weather Environment System consists of the following set of 
devices:
✓
✓A weather station display
✓
✓An AcuLink Internet Bridge
✓
✓The AcuLink app and website
✓
✓A 5-in-1 weather sensor
The AcuLink Internet Bridge, shown in Figure 11-8, gathers the data 
reported to it by the 5-in-1 sensor and makes it available via the Internet. 
You can access the data through the AcuLink website, or you can use the 
AcuLink app, which you can download to your iPhone, iPad, or Android 
device.
The weather station display is a tabletop device that detects and reports 
indoor temperature and humidity on its own (unfortunately, it does not 
detect air quality), and it also displays information sent to it by the 5-in-1 
sensor. You can quickly determine the outdoor and indoor weather comings 
and goings with a quick view of the display. That said, be sure to place it in 
an easily viewable location in your home.

 Chapter 11: Checking the Weather
As you can see in Figure 11-9, the 5-in-1 sensor not only looks like it means 
business, but it also works as well and professionally as it appears. This bad 
boy includes five impressively named sensors that work all sorts of weather-
gathering wizardry:
✓
✓Thermometer (okay, that’s not too impressive, but it gets better)
✓
✓Hygrometer (that’s kind of impressive-sounding)
✓
✓Wind speed anemometer (now that’s impressive!)
✓
✓Wind direction vane (not impressive at all, but certainly useful)
✓
✓Rain gauge (ditto)
“Yes, Dwight, it looks cool and the sensors have neat names (some of them, 
anyway), but what can a hygrometer and anemometer do for me?”
I’m glad you asked, dear reader! The 5-in-1 sensor uses its coolness to report 
the following for you:
✓
✓Your very own personalized weather forecast for morning, noon, and 
night conditions

Your Grandfather’s Dream,  
Your Reality: Automating  
Lawn Care
In This Chapter
▶
▶Discovering which lawn care tasks can be automated
▶
▶Cutting your grass while watching from the kitchen window
▶
▶Watering the lawn while reading the paper
S
 
ome jobs around the house are stereotypically seen as being handled by 
one of the genders:
✓
✓Mom cooks the meal while dad fixes the sink.
✓
✓Grandfather installs new shelves while grandmother finishes her sewing.
✓
✓Big brother cleans the toilets while little sister watches television.
Just kidding about that last one. It occurs to me that I must have expressed 
a repressed memory from my childhood — or, to be fair to my parents and 
sister, at least a repressed perception of a childhood memory.
Males have been firmly affixed as the stereotypical gender that cares for the 
lawn, hence the title of this chapter. However, I can recall more than a time 
or two when I’ve seen my grandmothers, my mom, and my wife handle many 
a lawn care task. So this chapter’s for you, too, ladies.
Many folks love to work on their lawns, but if push came to shove, most of  
us would prefer to put a couple of cows in the yard and let them take care of 
it. But since most folks these days don’t live in an area that’s cow-friendly, 
we’d love the next best thing: for the tasks to be automatically done using 
today’s tech.
Chapter 12

Caring for Your Lawn Doesn’t  
Have to Break Your Back
We like to think that the more our technology advances, the more time we 
have for the things we love and the less work we have to put into the tasks 
that drive us crazy. So far, you have seen how home automation can help 
with the cooking, cleaning, and other chores inside the home. Now it’s 
time to discover what home automation can do for you when it comes to 
jobs that are outside the confines of your abode’s walls, be they humble or 
­otherwise.
Reasons for automating lawn care
You awaken to the sounds of birds chirping on a beautiful Saturday morning 
and relish the idea of whipping that lawn of yours into shape. You are a lawn 
connoisseur, having acquired the taste for an immaculately shaped, perfectly 
cut, and gorgeously green yard from several generations stretching all the 
way back to your kin in the old country. You grab a cup of coffee, open the 
garage door, and step into the dew-covered grass to survey the task at hand 
between sips of java. The coolness of the breeze complements the warmth 
of the spring sun as you pull the crank cord on your mower. As the mower 
starts up, you push it to where you’ll begin the first row of what will soon be 
the most manicured yard in the neighborhood.
It’s now late afternoon. Your hands are aching from pushing and pulling your 
mower all over God’s creation. Gallons of water have been consumed in the 
name of keeping you hydrated. Hours have been flushed away trying to fix 
the mower’s blade after you ran over a petrified stump from the stone ages, 
only to end up having to buy a new blade at the hardware store. Your knuck-
les are battered and bloody from banging them against your mower’s engine 
in an attempt to remove the gas tank so you could clean the gunk out of it, 
which you discovered is what’s causing the sorry thing to quit on you every 
couple of laps around the lawn. You’re also sporting a nice new bandage on 
your left ankle after stepping into that hole your 5-year-old dug in the yard 
last winter, which you didn’t see because the grass had grown over it. The 
sun’s beginning to go down, and you now realize you’ll have to get back out 
here again tomorrow to finish the job.
Weekend. Shot.
If you’ve had much experience with cutting your own grass, the scenario I’ve 
just described is an all-too-familiar one. That in itself should explain the basic 

207

 Chapter 12: Your Grandfather’s Dream, Your Reality: Automating Lawn Care
reasons for automating your lawn care, but here are a few more reasons 
should you need further convincing:
✓
✓Automation will save you money!
✓
✓Robotic mowers are very low maintenance.
✓
✓Work can be performed at any time, day or night.
✓
✓Robotic mowers are electric, eliminating the need for gasoline.
✓
✓Automation frees up your time.
✓
✓And finally, the most obvious reason: Why break a sweat if you don’t have 
to? (I hope the fitness buffs in the audience will forgive me for that one.)
Now, I know what many of you are thinking, primarily because I had this 
thought myself: “Don’t these kinds of devices just contribute to a lazier soci-
ety and eliminate what was once a good excuse to go outside and get some 
exercise?” Let me answer your question with another: “Would you like to give 
up your clothes washer and dryer, or perhaps your dishwasher?”
I thought not.
Lawn care tasks that you can automate
Well, when it comes to the list of lawn care tasks that you can automate, it 
won’t take very long to read:
✓
✓Mow
✓
✓Water
That’s right: There are only two tasks as of this writing, but they’re the two 
biggies. I’ve researched and researched, but try as I might, I’ve been unable 
to discover a robotic lawn edger or a robotic hedge trimmer. I’m sure some-
one’s trying to build them, but as of now they’re only a dream for consumers. 
Believe me, I can feel your disappointment as I type this.
Getting to Know the Top Companies  
in Lawn Automation
When I was a kid, I had a weird thought (that kind of goes without saying): 
I envisioned C3PO pushing our lawn mower around the yard while R2D2 

208
Part III: Automating Outside Your Home 
weeded the flower bed and trimmed the hedges. R2D2 even wore a big 
straw hat — no kidding.
I gave you that semi-disturbing look into my psyche to illustrate the point 
that people have been hoping and dreaming of ways to more easily get the 
yard work done for quite the while. While the famous robot duo from the  
Star Wars universe aren’t about to cut your grass, their distant cousins, 
today’s robotic lawn mowers, will be more than happy to do the job. Robotic 
mowers are a reality, and many can even be controlled via your smartphone 
or tablet. The next few sections look into some of the most popular robotic 
mower companies and explain how each can help you automate that oh-so-
burdensome task, keeping the grass nice and trim.
Robomow
Robomow started in 1995 as a company called Friendly Machines, which 
developed the first robotic lawn mower. Since then, Robomow has become 
one of the top brands in the robotic mowing world. These mowers can handle  
the cutting of most lawns that can be cut with a standard push mower. One 
of Robomow’s former taglines reads: “It mows, you don’t.” In my opinion, the 
company should have stuck with that one. It says all there is to say about 
Robomow’s products.
Speaking of products, Robomow offers robotic mowers for small yards (one 
model), medium yards (two models), and large yards (two models). Each 
model is designed to tackle yards of certain sizes:
✓
✓RM510: yards up to 5,500 square feet
✓
✓RC306: yards up to 6,500 square feet
✓
✓RS612: yards up to 12,900 square feet
✓
✓RS622: yards up to 23,700 square feet
✓
✓RS630 (shown in Figure 12-1): cuts every yard in your neighborhood. 
Okay, not really, but it does handle yards up to 32,300 square feet.
For yards larger than 32,300 square feet, you will need more than one 
Robomow. Dual robotic mowers are able to work together in the same yard, 
but their setup procedures are a bit different than if setting up a single 
mower. You can contact Robomow for more information on dual mower 
setups by visiting www.robomowusa.com/contact.html.

Determine which mower you need
Just how do the good folks at Robomow expect you to go about measuring 
your yard’s dimensions to find out which mower is best for your needs? Well, 
I’m surprised at you, gentle reader! You should have known that Robomow 
has made it super simple for you to get a good idea of how large your yard is 
by using Google Maps. This is the 21st century we’re living in, after all, where 
knowledge is often a click or a tap away!
Using your favorite web browser, hop on over to http://robomap. 
robomow.com/?site=en-US to begin measuring your yard using the 
Robomap. Here’s how to easily measure your yard:
1.	Once on the site, enter your address information so Robomap can pull 
up a satellite image of your property. Click Next.
2.	Center the image of your property in the window by clicking-and-­
dragging the map image. Click Next.
You can also use the zoom slider on the left of the window to help center 
the image.
3.	Select a brush size from the options on the left side of the screen.
4.	Using your mouse pointer or trackpad, click-and-drag over the 
­portions of your yard that you typically mow, as I’ve done for Elvis 
Presley’s yard in Figure 12-2.
 The light green highlights are the sections of your yard that you’re 
­measuring.
5.	Select the eraser tool to remove any areas you mistakenly highlighted.

6.	When you’re finished highlighting, click Next to see a neat illustra-
tion of a Robomow mower at work cutting the area of your lawn you 
­highlighted.
7.	Click the Skip button when asked if you want to share the animation 
with your Facebook friends (unless you just have to show your friends 
which part of your yard you’re going to mow . . .).
Robomap will show you a picture of the model it recommends for you 
and your yard.
You’ve got to admit: The yard measurement tool is a great resource to help 
you determine which model suits your needs. It’s also kind of fun to search 
for famous lawns (like the White House or London’s Wembley Stadium) to see 
what Robomap recommends. In case you’re wondering, Wembley Stadium 
threw the Robomap tool for a loop: “BAD MODELS DATA!” it screamed.
Keeping your mower in your yard
You might be wondering how the mowers stay in your yard, and don’t take 
off down the street, or worse, run over your neighbor’s carefully manicured 
flower beds. The secret is perimeter wire, which is part of the initial setup 
of your Robomow mower. You’ll need to run the wire around your property, 
creating a virtual fence with the wire that your mower dare not cross. The 
wire can either be simply pegged to the ground around your yard, or you 
can bury it. Whenever your mower runs into this virtual fence, the machine 
simply turns around and heads in another direction, just as it does when it 
bumps into obstacles such as trees and bushes.

Setting up a perimeter can be a little tricky, especially if your yard is irregu-
larly shaped. If you should need help designing a perimeter, Robomow is 
happy to assist you by designing a custom perimeter plan for your yard  
(for a reasonable charge).
Other great Robomow features
The Robomow stable of mowers affords you tons of great features:
✓
✓The mowers are so quiet they can even go about their task when the 
rest of your neighborhood is sleeping. Won’t your buddy next door be 
green with envy when he wakes up on Saturday morning to find your 
lawn is already in tip-top shape?
✓
✓Mowers immediately return to their charging station after the job is 
completed or if they’re running really low on charge.
✓
✓You can decide whether to cut your lawn in the rain or not (no umbrella 
required!)
✓
✓Your mower can be programmed to require a PIN before it will 
­operate.
✓
✓The Robomow app lets you take control of your mower from your iOS  
or Android device. Visit www.robomow.com/en-USA/mobile-app-
en-us for compatibility information.
✓
✓The mowers incorporate safety features to keep your automated 
mowing a positive experience:
•	If the mower is lifted or turns over, it will automatically shut off.
•	A Child Lock feature keeps the mower from being operated by just 
anyone (children definitely fit that category).
Head on over to www.robomow.com to find out much more about Robomow 
and its mower models.
Husqvarna
No self-respecting home gardener or lawn care expert is unfamiliar with the 
name “Husqvarna.” These folks have been in the lawn and garden game since 
the early part of the 20th century, and have been around as a company for 
nearly 400 years! And no, I didn’t know that either, until I researched the 
information. Over the years, Husqvarna has become known as a top-of-the-
line manufacturer of lawn and garden tools, and its reputation is intact when 
it comes to automatically mowing your lawn, too.

212
Part III: Automating Outside Your Home 
Husqvarna has been robotically cutting lawns for 20 years, and suffice it to 
say that it has become quite skilled at the task. An interesting tidbit is that 
Husqvarna’s first robotic mower, introduced in 1995, ran on solar power: 
hence its Solar Mower moniker.
These days, Husqvarna’s robotic mowers are called Automowers, and 
they’re excellent tools to have in your home automation arsenal. Backed 
by Husqvarna’s outstanding reputation and quality, these little puppies 
(the Automower 220 AC shown in Figure 12-3) can take care of your lawn’s 
­trimming without you having to lift a finger.
Image courtesy of Husqvarna AB.
Figure 12-3: 
Husqvarna’s 
Automowers 
have 20 
years of 
research 
and develop-
ment behind 
them. 
The Automower line of mowers can cut your grass on a continual basis. You 
set up your mower, start it on its merry way, and it will cut your lawn, stop-
ping only to recharge when needed. Once recharged, the Automower will 
continue to cut your lawn. Automower cuts in a random pattern — which 
eliminates track marks in your lawn and helps your grass to grow stron-
ger since it’s being cut from different directions. The Automower also uses 
­razorlike blades that slice through your grass with ease, utilizing a mulching 
process to feed your lawn its own clippings (no bag!). Over a period of a few 
weeks, this random pattern and mulching cutting method will return a beauti-
ful lawn that has been strengthened and fertilized by your Automower.
Here are some other features that will cause you to consider Husqvarna’s 
Automower closely before making a decision on which manufacturer will get 
the honor of keeping your lawn immaculately trimmed:
✓
✓Uses a very low amount of energy, so recharging and mowing don’t cost 
a fortune.
✓
✓Automowers are weatherproof, so you can rest easy during your area’s 
rainy season: The lawn will be kept nice and neat.

213

 Chapter 12: Your Grandfather’s Dream, Your Reality: Automating Lawn Care
✓
✓Husqvarna’s engineers have figured out how to equip the Automower to 
handle steeper inclines than some of its competitors.
✓
✓Like other robotic mowers, Automower uses a boundary wire that you 
place around your yard to guide it along.
✓
✓If someone tries to swipe your beloved Automower, it uses an alarm and 
a secured PIN to make sure that the thief doesn’t get far.
✓
✓Husqvarna has outfitted Automower with safety features to keep life 
as simple as possible. Should the mower be tilted up or lifted, the 
blades will automatically shut off. No missing fingers or toes with the 
Automower on duty.
✓
✓The built-in settings panel allows you to easily modify Automower’s 
behavior, such as when it cuts and how.
✓
✓A guide wire helps the Automower find its way back to the charging 
­station more quickly, reducing the chances of Automower not making it 
back to the station before it runs out of power.
✓
✓It’s super-simple to adjust the cutting height of your Automower. Turn 
the knob on top of the mower, shown in Figure 12-4, to the desired cut-
ting height. You no longer have to adjust the height of each individual 
wheel, as you do on the typical push mower.
Many Automower owners can also use Husqvarna’s My Automower app to 
program and keep track of their Automower. The app can also alert you when 
there’s a problem, such as the mower becoming stuck or having to fend off 
the neighbor’s kid.

LawnBott
LawnBott, by Kyodo America, hasn’t been around as long as Husqvarna, or 
even as long as Robomow, but its lineup of robotic mowers is impressive. Not 
only does LawnBott have the most models to choose from of the three manu-
facturers discussed up to this point, but its products also can handle a wider 
range of lawn sizes than the others.
When it comes to style, LawnBott’s models leave a little something to be 
desired (with the exception of the Spyder; it’s a pretty neat-looking crit-
ter). However, this isn’t about style; it’s about getting the yard cut with-
out breaking a sweat, and LawnBott does that as well or better than most 
anyone else.
LawnBott’s models include:
✓
✓LB1200 Spyder: This little fellow is intended only for small lawns (up to 
5,500 square feet); however, it is the only robotic mower on the market 
to date that doesn’t require the use of a perimeter wire. The Spyder 
(shown in Figure 12-5) uses special sensors to determine when it’s no 
longer over a grassy area.
✓
✓LB75DX: This model cuts yards up to 7,000 square feet, and does 
employ the use of a perimeter wire (as do the rest of the upcoming 
models).
✓
✓LB85EL: The 85EL can take care of yards up to 24,000 square feet.
✓
✓LB200EL: The 200EL handles lawns up to 38,000 square feet. To com-
pare, that’s nearly 6,000 square feet more than Robomow’s best-range 
mower, the RS630.
✓
✓LB300EL: This bad boy of the backyard (and any other yard, for that 
matter) is unparalleled in the amount of lawn it can cover: 64,000 square 
feet! This is one mean grass-eating machine.

215

 Chapter 12: Your Grandfather’s Dream, Your Reality: Automating Lawn Care
LawnBott’s way of getting the job done is similar to the way other robotic 
mower makers go about it:
✓
✓Perimeter wire is used to mark the cutting boundaries for your LawnBott 
(with the exception of the Spyder, as mentioned). Having said that, 
LawnBott’s machines also work within enclosed areas, such as a fenced-
in yard, without the need for the perimeter wire, if you wish. Just be 
careful that you don’t have an area within the area (such as a flower 
bed) that you don’t want to be sliced and diced.
✓
✓LawnBott will follow the perimeter wire back to the recharging station 
when its batteries are low or when it’s completed cutting duty for the 
day. Again, this isn’t applicable to the Spyder.
✓
✓Based on battery life, cutting time can range from 45 minutes to 10 hours, 
depending on the model you’re using (the 75DX is the shortest time, and 
the 300EL has the longest).
✓
✓All models except the Spyder include a rain sensor, which allows the 
mower to cut or not when it rains, based on your instructions.
✓
✓LawnBotts can all receive software updates via the Internet using your 
Wi-Fi connection. That’s just awesome.
✓
✓LawnBotts can be secured with a PIN, without which they will not 
­operate if you choose this security option.
✓
✓An optional GPS unit can be installed so that you can track down the 
location of the LawnBott should it be stolen, or shall we say, removed 
from your property without prior authorization.
✓
✓LawnBotts can all work on yards with slopes up to 25 degrees, which is 
to say they can handle a hill pretty well.

✓
✓Safety is as much a concern to LawnBott as it is to other manufacturers. 
The device will simply shut off if tilted or picked up.
✓
✓Each of the EL models also supports SMS as an option, which allows 
you to receive text notifications from your LawnBott on your cellphone, 
whether it’s “smart” or not.
✓
✓All models are compatible with the Ambrogio Remote app for iOS and 
Android, shown in Figure 12-6. Use it to remotely control your LawnBott 
and to get notifications if things go awry.
It’s obvious that LawnBott has covered most, if not all, of the bases when it 
comes to automatically mowing your lawn. Check out www.lawnbotts.com

than that for those who do live here. Let’s take a look at three of the bigger 
and better brands.
John Deere
I’ve lived in the Southeastern part of the United States my entire life, and few 
companies are more synonymous with these parts than John Deere. Whether 
it’s tractors or riding mowers, John Deere has been right in the thick of things 
for as long as I can remember. But I have to admit that I was a bit surprised to 
find out that the company is just as good at robotically mowing a lawn as it is 
at tilling a field.
John Deere’s TANGO E5, seen in Figure 12-7, is the venerable company’s foray 
into the world of automated lawn care and, by most accounts, it’s a good  
one. However, you can’t get your hands on one in the Southeastern United 
States — or any other part of the United States, for that matter.
That you can’t buy a particular John Deere product in the United States 
sounds strange, for sure, but it’s not the only company following the practice. 
The fact is this: Robotic or automatic mowing is super-popular in Europe and 
in other countries around the world, but it’s yet to really take off in the U.S. 
This is reason enough for some manufacturers to make their products avail-
able in places around the world, excluding the United States.
For more information on the TANGO E5, visit www.deere.com/en_INT/
products/equipment/autonomous_mower/autonomous_mower.page.
Two more examples of big-name manufacturers whose automated lawn 
mowers can’t be purchased in the U.S. are Honda and Bosch.

Honda
Honda’s Miimo is a slick grass-cutting hombre, coupling Honda’s reputation 
for reliability with its experience in the area of robotics. The Miimo is quite a 
machine in both looks and functionality.
You would think that with the popularity of Honda’s other products in the 
U.S. that the company would offer the Miimo within the country’s borders, 
but that isn’t the case as of this writing. But if you’re someone living in 
Europe — congratulations! — you can get your hands on one of these little 
gems with little to no problem.
The Miimo, shown in Figure 12-8, covers the basics of what the other 
­automated lawn mower manufacturers do:
✓
✓It provides a safe mowing experience, with automated shut-off when the 
device is lifted or tilted too much.
✓
✓It’s quiet, so mowing can be performed any time of the day or night 
­without disturbing the neighbors.
✓
✓The Miimo is self-charging, meaning that once its power is low it will 
seek out the charging station on its own and recharge.
✓
✓Rain is not a problem; the Miimo is waterproof and the blades will cut 
wet grass as well as dry.
A couple of other features really stand out on the Miimo:
The blades are made of (in Honda’s words) “high quality ductile heat-treated 
steel.” This means that should the blades hit a solid object they won’t 
­shatter, but instead will either bend or rotate inward.

 Chapter 12: Your Grandfather’s Dream, Your Reality: Automating Lawn Care
You can choose to have your lawn cut in one of three cutting patterns: 
random, directional, or a mix of the two.
Check out the Miimo at www.honda.co.uk/garden/miimo/.
Bosch
The Bosch Indego is yet another great robotic mower option from yet another 
great company with a reputation for quality. This little blue-green baby can 
tackle your (non-U.S.) lawn as autonomously as the next robotic mower, and 
has all the features you’ve come to expect from these yard-mongers:
✓
✓The Indego can charge itself, returning to the charging station of its own 
accord.
✓
✓Cutting slopes is a breeze (slopes up to a 35 percent grade, that is).
✓
✓Perimeter wire is used to make certain the Indego never loses its way.
✓
✓A PIN code and alarm prevent folks from sneaking off with your Indego.
✓
✓A yaw sensor helps the Indego regain its footing should it slip on slopes 
or wet grass.
The Indego (shown in Figure 12-9) has lots of other features, too, including 
the standard safety features like automatic shut-off. One of the coolest has to 
do with the cutting technology employed by Bosch: Logicut. You see, Bosch 
follows the philosophy that a directional pattern is better than a random one, 
citing time, energy, and cost savings. The Logicut technology has the Indego 
first map out the lawn and then create an efficient mowing plan that tells the 
Indego to cut the lawn using parallel lines where possible.

Take a virtual look at the Indego at www.bosch-indego.com. Bosch has 
packed a great deal more information into its web pages than I can divulge here.
Don’t forget your Indego’s PIN! If you forget the PIN and attempt to enter 
it too many times incorrectly, the Indego will shut down. The only way to 
recover it is to take it and the charging station to a certified Bosch dealer.
Watering Your Lawn Automatically
It doesn’t matter what your preference of robotic mower is if you don’t have a 
lawn for it to mow. Moving from mowing your lawn to watering it, let’s take a 
look at how best to automate your lawn-watering tasks. Sure, there have been 
automatic sprinkler systems since the Stone Age, but only recently have you 
been able to control your sprinklers via your smartphone.
Cyber Rain
Cyber Rain is a company that connects your existing sprinkler system to the 
Internet, and since it can do that it allows you to control your system from 
anywhere you have an Internet connection. Cyber Rain’s software and infor-
mation is entirely cloud-based (get it, “cloud”-based?), which lets you access 
your irrigation system from any device with an Internet connection and a web 
browser. Cyber Rain also saves you money over your existing system because 
it uses your local weather forecast to adjust its watering schedule automati-
cally. Your existing sprinkler system waters on a set schedule, regardless of 
whether you’ve just survived a torrential downpour or not.
Here’s how to put Cyber Rain to work:
1.	Replace your existing sprinkler system controller with a Cyber Rain 
controller.
2.	After mounting the Cyber Rain controller, connect the wires for your 
irrigation system’s water valves to the controller.
3.	Connect the Cyber Rain Gateway to your home network.
 This allows the controller and gateway to communicate with one 
another and share information about your irrigation system.
 You can use as many Cyber Rain controllers as you like with your 
Cyber Rain Gateway.
4.	Log in to your Cyber Rain account from any computer or smart device 
that can run a web browser.

221

 Chapter 12: Your Grandfather’s Dream, Your Reality: Automating Lawn Care
5.	Monitor your water savings, change your irrigation schedules, initiate 
a manual watering cycle, and more from Cyber Rain’s cloud-based 
software.
 Sit back and open your next water bill with confidence that you’ll see 
results of savings both in your water consumption and in your bank 
account.
The Cyber Rain system will alert you to problems encountered in your irriga-
tion system. For example, should the irrigation pipes spring a leak, Cyber 
Rain will note that water is being used when it shouldn’t be, send you a noti-
fication of the problem, and shut down watering functions until the alert is 
cleared.
That you can access your irrigation system’s controls through the Internet 
is a boon, but one might also consider that using an app to control the 
whole thing is a pretty awesome deal, too. However, the Cyber Rain app 
(see Figure 12-10) isn’t nearly as functional as the web-based version of the 
controller software. As a matter of fact, the app itself isn’t garnering a lot of 
love from its users, based on feedback I’ve found on the iOS and Android 
Figure 12-10:

App stores. The biggest problem with the app is that it is so simplistic, and 
I’ve read complaints that some of the features don’t work as advertised. The 
latest version of Cyber Rain’s app as of this writing is 1.6; I hope it’s been 
updated since I wrote this book and that the reviews are on the upswing.
I suggest checking the Cyber Rain website (www.cyber-rain.com) so you 
can further investigate its fine irrigation system products. You will find lots of 
information there, not only about Cyber Rain’s residential products, but also 
about its commercial irrigation systems.
Rachio
Rachio is all about the business of saving you money and conserving water. It 
goes about these two tasks in much the same way as Cyber Rain:
✓
✓It keeps a real-time look at your area’s current weather conditions before 
scheduling a lawn-watering session, and makes automatic adjustments to 
said schedule as needed.
✓
✓Rachio uses the Internet and the cloud to exchange information between 
your irrigation system and your devices (smart devices and computers 
grant you access to your personalized info).
✓
✓It replaces your current sprinkler system controller with one of its own, 
called the Iro (see Figure 12-11).


 Chapter 12: Your Grandfather’s Dream, Your Reality: Automating Lawn Care
At first blush, Rachio and Cyber Rain might seem like two companies with the 
same idea. However, Rachio is aiming to separate its product in a couple of 
important ways:
✓
✓Rachio’s Iro doesn’t require the purchase of a gateway. It simply con-
nects to your Wi-Fi with the help of your smartphone. You use your 
smartphone to flash the Iro, giving it the same information your smart-
phone uses to access your home’s Wi-Fi network.
✓
✓While Cyber Rain’s smart device app seems to be an afterthought in 
regards to its functionality, Rachio primarily uses apps on iOS and 
Android devices to operate the Iro, as illustrated in Figure 12-12. You 
can access a web-based page dedicated to the Iro on the Rachio website 
(https://rach.io) as well, but anything you need to do with your 
Iro was designed to be controlled by an app first. Rachio’s app is clean, 
easy to navigate, and packed with features.

he UPS guy just dropped off enough boxes full of smart home automation 
devices to keep you busy for the next few weeks, and that’s just unboxing 
everything.
Time zips by and you’ve got all your home automation gear unboxed and 
ready to go. You decide to connect your smart hub first so that the other 
devices can connect to it.
Halfway through the installation process, you get to the part where your iOS 
or Android smartphone or tablet is required to download an app and create 
an account.
“Aw, who needs that fancy-shmancy stuff?” you ask, as you whip out your 
tried-and-true Motorola flip-phone from 2004. You poke around the menu a 
bit, get frustrated, and even call your cellphone provider for help. Alas, you 
find no App Store to download your app from. “Bummer,” you say, with a 
tinge of despondency.
And then you notice in the instructions that you can also register your smart 
hub on the company’s website. Eureka! You dash inside, sit down at your desk, 
pop open a can of your favorite soft drink, and proceed with the five-minute 
process of booting up your good ol’ Commodore 64 computer. After much bal-
lyhoo, the C64 is up and running, but again you’re stymied in your attempt to 
register your smart hub: There’s no Internet connection or web browser on 
your C64! (How’d you ever find this book about smart home ­automation in the 
first place? Geez!)

Sorry, Methuselah, but it looks like you might need to upgrade a few electronic 
thingies around the house: In particular, you’ll need a smartphone, a tablet, 
and/or a contemporary computer to not only register your products, but to 
even be able to use them.
Discovering Devices Commonly Used 
for Smart Home Automation
Having the right devices handy will make getting started with and using your 
smart home automation devices that much easier. In this chapter, I give you 
an overview of which smart devices and computing platforms are most fre-
quently supported by home automation companies, and also tell you how to 
get apps and keep them updated.
Smartphones
Most folks using smart home automation tech will find themselves reaching 
for their smartphones when they need to open a lock or adjust a thermo-
stat remotely. Although most smartphones work quite well with today’s 
home automation tech, some devices might not quite be able to cut it. Take 
a look at which smartphones and operating systems are most frequently 
supported and which ones are sketchier in their capability to control your 
home automation.
iOS
Apple’s iOS is the smartphone operating system that started the smartphone 
craze with the release of the first iPhone in 2007.
There simply can be no denying that iOS changed how many of us live our 
daily lives. Many of the following tasks we perform with our phones today 
first became commonplace because of iOS and the first iPhone:
✓
✓Surfing the Internet
✓
✓Taking and sending pictures and videos
✓
✓Sending and receiving email
✓
✓Watching Internet-based videos
✓
✓Listening to and purchasing music and other multimedia

229

 Chapter 13: Working with Mobile Devices and Computers
✓
✓Connecting to Wi-Fi networks
✓
✓Creating and sharing events on your calendar
✓
✓Synchronizing content with your computer
✓
✓Listening to podcasts
There is so much more, too; I’m only scratching the surface. “You could do 
some of that before the iPhone!” some of you might retort. You and I both 
know that you could do some of those things on old-fashioned cellphones 
(such as taking and sending pictures), but the difference between perform-
ing those tasks on the old devices and performing them on the iPhone is as 
great as that of using pigeons to send messages and using email. Don’t get 
sassy, please.
I spend much time discussing iOS and the iPhone because, frankly, without 
them, this book might not be written and home automation might still be in 
the dark ages. That is no exaggeration. Who knows what might have hap-
pened if Steve Jobs and company hadn’t decided to go forward with the 
iPhone? Although Android devices are good products these days, who knows 
where they would be today if not for the push they were given by Apple to up 
their game?
The iPhone is the only smartphone in the world authorized to use the 
iOS operating system. While that may turn off some folks, Apple believes 
its hardware will run its own operating system better than anyone else’s 
hardware will — and you can’t argue with results. Most home automation 
technology companies today support both iOS and Android smart devices, 
but there are some that still only support iOS. The main reasons for that 
disparity are:
✓
✓iOS has been at the game for longer.
✓
✓iOS is generally more stable than Android.
✓
✓Hardware and software compatibility issues are kept to a bare minimum 
since both are from the same manufacturer, Apple.
What is a smartphone?
A smartphone is a cellular phone that is smarter 
than you and I put together, or at least it seems 
so sometimes. Actually, they are cellular 
phones, but they also perform some of the same 
functions as your computer, use a touchscreen 
interface, and can connect to the Internet with 
ease, whether through your cellular provider’s 
network or via your Wi-Fi network.

230
Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
✓
✓Many home automation developers cut their teeth on iOS and are 
­reluctant (and some downright refusing) to work on the Android 
­platform.
Having said all that, these are the iPhone versions most likely to be sup-
ported by the majority of the home automation companies on the market:
✓
✓iPhone 4
✓
✓iPhone 4s
✓
✓iPhone 5
✓
✓iPhone 5c
✓
✓iPhone 5s
✓
✓iPhone 6 (shown in Figure 13-1 on the left)
✓
✓iPhone 6 Plus (shown in Figure 13-1 on the right)
All iPhone versions in the preceding list support at least iOS 7, which is cru-
cial when running most of the home automation apps today. Anything older 
than iOS 7 just won’t do for most of them. Sigh.

 Chapter 13: Working with Mobile Devices and Computers
The current version is iOS 8, so if you’re thinking you’ll just get an iPhone 4 
from your friend, think twice. Sure, the iPhone 4 supports iOS 7, but it doesn’t 
support iOS 8, and in a year or two app versions will only support iOS 8. That 
trend is just part of the technology game, so be ready for it now and don’t 
force instant obsolescence on yourself by trying to save a few bucks on an 
old iPhone.
For more on iOS 8 and the iPhone, check out www.apple.com/iphone.
Android
After reading the preceding section on iPhones and iOS, you might think I 
have a complete aversion to Google’s Android operating system, but I assure 
you that is not the case. Android is a great mobile operating system, par-
ticularly the newest versions, and it does everything iOS can do. Granted, 
Android doesn’t enjoy the same stability as iOS, and the fact that multiple 
hardware vendors use the operating system can play havoc from time to 
time, but Android as a platform is a good thing.
Android versus iOS reminds me of the battles between Apple’s Mac OS and 
Microsoft’s Windows years ago. You don’t hear much about that old-time 
squabble these days, but you do hear and read Android versus iOS compari-
sons all the time.
Android will do all that you want it to, but the question is, does it do what 
you want it to in the way that you want it to? That same question can be 
applied to iOS, as well. It all comes down to your personal preference. I’ll 
leave it at that.
Here’s something to be wary of, though: The versions of the Android oper-
ating system supported by home automation companies vary wildly. Some 
companies, like SmartThings, say the versions of their apps you need to 
install and the version of the Android operating system you need on your 
smartphone vary by device, as shown in Figure 13-2.
The reason? Smartphone manufacturers that use Android on their phones 
can tinker with the original Android OS version, and sometimes that tinker-
ing can make things a little less stable than they otherwise would be. In some 
cases, you may have an app that works great on Phone 1 but has all kinds 
of issues on Phone 2, even though they are both running the same version 
of the app and the same core version of Android. Android is open-source 
software, meaning that anyone can use it and modify it (within reason) to 
his or her own needs. So companies that use Android can take a core release 
of the software from Google and pretty much do whatever they want with 
it. Of course, these manufacturers want more people to buy their smart-
phones more than their competitors’ devices, so they try hard not to break

­compatibility with other apps — but it’s something you need to be aware of. 
If your home automation app works differently on one Android phone than 
it does on another, don’t automatically assume the app developer is the one 
that goofed things up.
Most home automation companies do support Android, so chances are good 
that if you already have an Android smartphone that you’ll be able to use it 
with the system you’re considering purchasing (or have already purchased). 
If you aren’t sure, please find out before plunking down your hard-earned 
cash on a system you can’t use.
Having offered my take on the Android platform, allow me to give you a list of 
some of the latest smartphones (as of this writing) that run it:

Windows Phone
It seems strange to think that Microsoft is lagging behind rather than being 
one of the leaders in the field of operating systems, but when it comes to 

233

 Chapter 13: Working with Mobile Devices and Computers
smartphones, the company is trailing Apple and Google by a mile. That isn’t 
to say that the Windows Phone operating system isn’t good, but Microsoft 
got into the game a little late.
Figure 13-3:

This being the case, many home automation companies have paid little to no 
heed to the cries from Windows Phone users for support of their devices. If 
you are a Windows Phone user, don’t be discouraged, though. Some home 
automation companies, like SmartThings and Alarm.com, are coming around, 
while others are still holding off, like Belk and Wink. All I can tell you in terms 
of availability is to contact the companies directly to voice your need for 
Windows Phone apps. Because availability is a concern, this does limit your 
choices of home automation systems and devices, I’m afraid.
Another issue you need to be aware of is that those home automation compa-
nies that do support Windows Phone tend to favor the latest version, which 
is 8.1 as of this writing, but there is some support out there for version 8. 
Good luck finding any support for version 7, though. It’s not my intent to 
bring you down, but I do want you to be informed about the current state of 
affairs concerning Windows Phones and home automation.

234
Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
If you don’t have a Windows Phone app for your home automation system, 
you may have an alternative. Most home automation systems have dedicated 
websites you can log into, allowing you to monitor and control everything 
from there. Your Windows Phone comes with a web browser, right? Well, 
there you go!
Now, onto the phones! A number of Windows Phones are on the market, but 
you’ll notice after a quick search that the vast majority are by one manufac-
turer, Nokia. Culling through a list of Windows Phones on Microsoft’s website 
is like taking a tour through Nokia-land (Figure 13-5 sports one of the Nokia 
models). I kid you not. It’s kind of funny when you look for a list of the best 
Windows Phones and almost all of them are Nokia models (and in one case, 
one review I found listed nothing but Nokia models).
Fear not, though, if Nokia isn’t your thing; other Windows Phone makers 
includes the likes of HTC and Samsung.

 Chapter 13: Working with Mobile Devices and Computers
Tablets
As I mention earlier in the chapter, most of you will probably stick to your 
smartphones when it comes to making adjustments and checking in with 
your home automation systems, especially when on the go. However, it may 
be a different story in the home: The tablet may take center stage.
Tablets are essentially overgrown smartphones, without the phone part (at 
least in most cases). But it is precisely their size that makes them so useful 
and makes them viable alternatives to full-blown laptop computers. Tablets 
are lightweight, durable, and have a touchscreen, so getting your work done 
or catching up on your entertainment is now done in a portable way.
Many of the traditional home automation companies have utilized touch-
screens for years with their products, but they were completely customized 
devices that were specific to the home automation tasks alone: Nothing else 
could be done with them. Plus, they were often mounted on walls and you 
were unable to take them around the house with you, much less outside the 
home.
Today’s tablets do offer you the mobility that the old-fashioned kind didn’t, 
plus you can customize them to your heart’s content. Check out the following

iOS
Hello, Apple! Nice to see you again.
Yep, the Cupertino Fruit Company also has the inside track with tablets in 
the home automation space, and for the same reasons it holds the slight edge 
over Android with smartphones.
Apple’s tablets run the same operating system that its phones do — iOS. 
The same version issues apply as well, with version 8 being the most 
­current.
Apple currently offers two models of its popular iPad, the iPad Air (shown in

Android
Android apps are available for tablets just as they are for smartphones, so 
don’t think you might be missing something when it comes to being able to 
control your home automation devices.
Apple currently offers a total of five iPads, but if you’re in the market for an 
Android tablet, you are about to hit the mother lode, my friend. There are 
more Android tablets on the market than there are grains of sand on the 
beach (at least it seems that way). And this is a good thing, because it means 
a tablet is available for nearly every budget.
Again, the only issue I would advise you to be wary of is the version of the 
Android OS your tablet is running. Generally speaking, when it comes to 
­compatibility with the latest home automation devices, newer is better.

Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
Here is a list of some of the best Android tablets on the market:
✓
✓Nvidia Shield Tablet (http://shield.nvidia.com/gaming-tablet/): 
Don’t let the “gaming” tagline fool you; this tablet is just as good for 
home automation as it is gaming.
✓
✓Samsung Galaxy Tab S (www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-tab)
✓
✓LG G Pad (www.lg.com/us/tablets)
✓
✓Sony Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact (http://sonymobile.com/us/
products/tablets/xperia-z3-tablet-compact/): This puppy’s 
waterproof!
✓
✓Google/HTC Nexus 9 (www.htc.com/us/tablets/nexus-9/ or  
www.google.com/nexus/9/): This one’s shown in Figure 13-7.
Do your homework before buying your Android tablet, though; they are 
definitely not all created equal. You can pretty much bet on those in the 
­preceding list, but if you’d like to check out offerings from other tablet 
makers, please do.
When it comes to most things, the adage “you get what you pay for” applies. 
That is definitely the case when it comes to Android tablets, dear reader.

 Chapter 13: Working with Mobile Devices and Computers
Computers
Now, this book has focused on remotely controlling your home automation 
system from smart devices, such as those I just discussed. However, with the 
Internet and the World Wide Web at your fingertips, computers can be pretty 
handy, too.
Although most home automation companies don’t make native applications 
for computer-based operating systems (there are some exceptions), they do 
provide access via a dedicated web page. You can, for example, access your 
Alarm.com home security system or your Netatmo weather station through a 
web browser.
Suffice it to say, if you have a relatively modern computer in your home (or 
office, or wherever else), along with Internet access, you should be able to 
at least access your home automation system from it, and most likely be 
allowed to control it, too.
If you have trouble viewing or accessing a site from one web browser, just 
download and try another.
Macs and OS X
Apple’s Mac line of computers running the OS X (that’s pronounced OH ESS 
TEN, for those of you who are new to Apple’s parlance) operating system 
should work with no issues when it comes to accessing and using any home 
automation company’s dedicated website.
OS X comes with the Safari browser, but there are plenty of others to choose 
from. For example, you can search for any of the following browsers, in 
OS X’s App Store:
✓
✓Google Chrome
✓
✓Mozilla Firefox
✓
✓Opera
If none of those suit your tastes, just keep searching; there are plenty of 
browsers out there for Mac.
When it comes to native apps that run on your Mac to control your home 
automation system, there aren’t very many. And rightly so for the most part, 
since you can already do most, if not all, of the tasks I discuss in this book via 
the Internet (provided the home automation company offers the option, of 
course).

240
Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
One exception that comes to mind: Indigo Domotics (www.indigodomo.com). 
These folks are out to help the serious (and advanced) home automation guru 
get the job done. The company’s software is Mac-only, and it is extensive. 
I definitely advise you to give Indigo Domotics a look if you really want to dig 
deep into home automation and to run several different home automation 
protocols from one piece of software.
The next question is, which Mac do you need? Apple offers several models, 
desktop and laptop alike:
✓
✓MacBook Air (ultra-slim laptop)
✓
✓MacBook Pro (full-featured laptop)
✓
✓iMac (the iconic all-in-one computer)
✓
✓iMac with Retina 5K display (the iMac, but with a crazy-great display; 
shown in Figure 13-8)
✓
✓Mac Pro (loaded to the gills with features for the graphics professional; 
not necessarily for the average home user)
✓
✓Mac mini (compact unit that comes with nothing else; you have to 
supply the keyboard, mouse, and monitor)
Visit your local Apple Store or check it all out at www.apple.com/mac.
PCs and Windows
Any PC capable of running Windows 7 or newer should have no problem 
viewing and using websites by home automation companies that allow you to 
control your system from the web. Heck, I would even say that if you can run 
Windows XP, you’re pretty safe.
As with OS X, Windows is not in short supply when it comes to compatible 
web browsers. As you probably know, Internet Explorer is Microsoft’s default 
browser of choice, but you can find others if it doesn’t fit the bill, such as:
✓
✓Google Chrome
✓
✓Mozilla Firefox
✓
✓Apple Safari
✓
✓Opera
As far as stand-alone home automation software goes, there are a few options 
for Windows users, but like the Mac, few of them are necessary unless you 
want to use your computer (as opposed to the cloud) as your primary

Windows Tablets
“Why isn’t this section on the other pages with iOS and Android tablets?” I 
can hear my readers and my editors all asking that question right about now.
Well, the reason is simple. Windows tablets are indeed tablets, but you could 
understandably be misled into thinking they are like iOS or Android tablets. 
Actually, Windows-based tablets that run Windows 8 are indeed running 
the full-blown version of Windows 8, not a separate mobile version of the 
Windows OS. They are completely Windows computers, operating-system-
wise, so they belong in the computers discussion.

242
Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
I won’t rehash what I discuss under the previous PCs and Windows section. 
However, if you want to use a Windows-based portable device that doesn’t 
include a keyboard (or at least has one you can tuck away) to control your 
home automation system, then a Windows tablet, like the Lenovo ThinkPad 2 
shown in Figure 13-10, will be right up your alley. Anything you can do on a 
Windows PC can be done on the tablets, too.
PCs and Linux
Linux has come a long way in the last few years. The term would generate 
looks of disgust or apathy among computer users who were used to doing 
things on Windows or Mac machines. Let’s face it: Linux used to be the ugly 
duckling of the computing world, but much has changed. Linux has become 
a viable and attractive alternative for folks looking for an inexpensive way to 
keep their PC up-to-date and for getting things done. Linux itself is free, and 
it will run on computers using Intel or AMD processors. Today’s computer 
users are able to do what they need to, with tasks such as email, editing 
pictures, surfing the web, listening to music, watching streaming video, and 
the like becoming much more user friendly of late. Linux distributions, such 
as Ubuntu (shown in Figure 13-11), have made installing and using Linux a 
­million times easier than ever before.
When it comes to Linux home automation software, there are several  
choices out there, but they are not for the faint of heart or the Linux newbie. 
Choices such as Minerva (www.minervahome.net) and Pytomation (www.
pytomation.com) are for the seasoned Linux and home automation veteran.

Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
Remember, though, that most home automation companies do offer 
web logins to your home automation system, so if you’re running Linux, 
there’s a good chance you’ll be able to control things through your web 
browser. However, if the home automation system uses technologies 
such as Adobe’s Flash or Microsoft’s Silverlight, you’ll need to install 
those ­software packages.
Chromebooks
The latest PCs to hit the market are Chromebooks, which are slimmed down 
and inexpensive computers that run Google’s Chrome OS. Chrome OS is 
designed to be super-user-friendly, providing an almost browserlike experi-
ence. It’s not meant to be a business workhorse or a graphics powerhouse, 
but it does the basics and does them well. Chrome OS gives you access to 
all the standard Google apps, such as Docs, Gmail, and Calendar, as well as 
thousands more via the Chrome Web Store.
Chromebooks, such as Toshiba’s Chromebook 2 (shown in Figure 13-12), are 
great for those who want a laptop, need just the basic computing experience, 
and aren’t tied (for one reason or another) to OS X or Windows.
When it comes to home automation, you’re pretty much tied to just accessing 
your home automation system through the manufacturer’s dedicated web-
site. You can’t install software on a Chromebook: It is what it is (or maybe 
I should say it’s WYSIWYG, “What you see is what you get”).
If the home automation company uses Java or Microsoft’s Silverlight to 
power its website, you’re out of luck. Chrome OS doesn’t support Java or 
Silverlight, but Adobe’s Flash does come as part of the Chrome browser, so 
you’re in the clear there.

 Chapter 13: Working with Mobile Devices and Computers
Keeping Apps Up-to-Date
Keeping your apps updated to their latest and greatest versions is a good 
thing. I know I risk stirring the ire of those who are on the other side of 
that fence, but I’ve always believed that updates are good things. Don’t get 
me wrong: I’ve had my share of some not-so-delightful experiences after 
p­erforming an update (and sometimes while in the middle of one), but the 
vast majority of the time it’s been a positive thing.
I’ve found it to be especially true that updating iOS and Android apps is a 
good idea, because they generally are trying to fix bugs more than they’re 
adding features. You might be more wary of updates that jump from one ver-
sion to the next (such as from version 2 to version 3), but updates to estab-
lished versions are almost always a great idea (for example, updating from 
version 3.1 to version 3.2).
The remainder of this chapter delves into how to update your apps for 
the devices you’ll be using to access your home automation system and 
devices.
iOS
iOS uses its App Store to keep track of updates to apps you have installed on 
your iPhone or iPad. The App Store is able to keep track of the apps you’ve 
Automatic updates
iOS and Android both allow you to auto-
matically update apps, but I personally don’t 
enable it. Why not? Because I like to have con-
trol over the whole process; it’s that simple. Go 
ahead, call me a control freak. It won’t bother 
me (“sticks and stones”). I have a bunch of 
apps on my phones, but they don’t update 
often enough and in such a quantity that it 
discourages me from updating manually. 
However, if you’ve got a ton of apps and they 
do update frequently, it will probably save you 
from headaches if you allow updates to occur 
automatically. Also, if your smartphone’s or 
tablet’s data plan isn’t unlimited, it’s a good 
idea to only allow automatic updates when 
you’re connected to Wi-Fi so you don’t use up 
your allotted data. To enable or disable auto-
matic updates on iOS, go to Settings➪iTunes 
& App Store and toggle the Updates switch. 
For Android devices, go to Google Play 
Store➪Menu➪Settings, and under General 
find and tap Auto-update apps; make a selec-
tion. The Menu icon looks like three stacked 
parallel lines, by the way.

downloaded and of those you currently have installed by using your Apple 
ID. Whenever a developer updates an app that you have installed, the App 
Store lets you know in one of two ways:
✓
✓By displaying a red badge in the upper-right corner of the App Store icon 
when you’re not in the App Store.
✓
✓By displaying a red badge on the Updates tab when in the App Store; 
the Updates tab is found at the bottom right of the screen, as shown 
in Figure 13-13.
You can update your apps in one of two ways:
✓
✓Update an individual app by tapping the Update button to the right of 
the app’s name in the list.
✓
✓Update all the available apps at once by tapping the Update All button in 
the upper right of the screen.

Android
Updating apps that are installed on your Android device is also a simple ­process:
1.	Open the Google Play Store app.
2.	Tap the Menu icon (looks like three stacked parallel lines).
3.	Tap My Apps.
4.	Scroll through your list of apps.
Apps that have updates available will be labeled as such.
5.	Tap the app you want and then tap Update.
OS X
If you are running home automation software on your Mac, or if your web 
browser is getting long in the tooth and things aren’t rendering on-screen 
properly, it’s a simple process to update:
1.	Open the App Store (yep, there’s one in OS X as well as iOS).
2.	Click the Updates button at the top right of the window, shown in 
Figure 13-14.
The App Store will check to see if there are updates for any of the apps 
you have installed. If so, they will appear as a list.
3.	Click the Update All button in the upper-right corner of the list of 
available updates to do just that, or click the Update button next to 
each app to update them individually.
Some software updates require a restart of your computer. If you aren’t at a 
place in your work where you can restart, simply postpone the updates until 
a better time.
OS X allows you to direct it in how it should install updates to your com-
puter. Go to the Apple menu in the upper left of the screen and select System 
Preferences, then click App Store. Read through the options and determine 
those that you prefer to use.

Windows
Windows 8 has certainly changed how Windows users get around, so updat-
ing your software might not be as intuitive if you’re new to it. Here’s how to 
check for and install updates in Windows 8:
1.	In the upper-right corner of the screen, you will see Updates; the 
number of apps you have installed that can be updated appears in 
parentheses. Click Updates.
2.	Select the apps you want to update by clicking (or tapping, if you’re 
using a touchscreen) them in the list. You can click or tap Select All 
in the lower left of the screen to update all the apps at once.
3.	Click or tap the Install button at the bottom of the screen to install 
your updates.
The Installs screen will show the progress of each individual app as it is 
updated.
4.	Exit the Store app when finished.
Done!

ou’ve done your homework on what systems will make your home auto-
mation dreams come true, and you’ve probably installed some home 
automation goodies. Life couldn’t be sweeter!
Or could it?
Think about it: You’ve got gadget after gadget, each from a different manufac-
turer, and each with its own way to control the items inside and outside your 
home. You have an app that controls your light, another that automates your 
stove, one that operates the door locks, yet another that coordinates the secu-
rity system, still another handling the thermostat, and on and on it goes. Where 
it stops, nobody knows. I think you catch my drift: It’s exhausting just thinking 
about opening an app, closing another one, opening yet another (oh no, the 
interface is entirely different!) — closing that app, lather, rinse, and repeat.
What to do, my weary home automation friend? What knight in shining armor 
will save us home automation junkies from the crushing weight of all those 
apps? It’s my aim in this chapter to introduce you to those potential knights 
who will rescue you from your app distress and make your life much easier.

Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
You discover how several of the top home automation companies are work-
ing hard to solve the problem of unity, and how each of the solutions can 
benefit you now and in the long run.
Examining the Lack of Unity
The word “unity” can be defined in several ways, including:
✓
✓The quality or state of not being multiple
✓
✓A condition of harmony
✓
✓The quality or state of being made one
✓
✓A totality of related parts
✓
✓An entity that is a complex or systematic whole
Why dedicate a chapter of this book to unity? Well, if you’re one of the folks 
I mention in the introduction who have already acquired several home auto-
mation products, you will totally understand the reason: Without some kind 
of cohesion of control over your home automation environment, things can 
get a little higgledy-piggledy, to use a highly technical term.
Recognizing the “higgledy-piggledy”  
state of home automation
The focus of Home Automation For Dummies is on the burgeoning “smart do-
it-yourself” home automation market, where people control their automation 
products via their smartphones, tablets, or computers. The upscale and cus-
tomized whole-home type of systems offered by companies like Crestron and 
Savant provide their own all-in-one control systems that take care of all your 
automation control needs. The smart do-it-yourself market is a fairly new 
one, so there hasn’t been much push (until very recently) to make everything 
work together from a central controller. There are myriad reasons for this 
pickle in which we find ourselves:
✓
✓Individual companies may like you to use only their product offerings.
✓
✓A manufacturer may cater only to specific home automation needs (their 
apps control your lighting but not your locks, for example).
✓
✓Products may incorporate different communication technologies.

251

 Chapter 14: Controlling Your Home from One Platform
Several home automation communication protocol standards have been 
around for years, but they don’t usually play nice with one another of their 
own accord. If you buy a device that uses ZigBee, don’t expect it to work with 
other devices in your home that are using Z-Wave, INSTEON, X10, or the like, 
unless assisted by one of the options mentioned in this chapter.
Seeing ways to achieve platform unity
The obvious need for some sort of unity among the home automation big-
wigs won’t be accomplished by making everybody sit around a campfire 
singing “Kumbaya” (although that would be pretty entertaining, I’m sure). 
Let’s be honest: Business is business, even if said business claims to be 
looking out for you, the consumer. This home automation unity is going to 
take someone from the outside stepping up, then, before it can be achieved, 
right? Well, that might be an answer, but that isn’t necessarily the only 
way; established home automation companies are also joining others in the 
search for unity.
How will this unity be accomplished? There is no one right way, but having 
many different ways is better than having none at all, I’m sure you’ll agree.
Two potential methods for achieving this unity are as follows:
✓
✓Develop a single platform that manufacturers incorporate when devel-
oping and designing their products. This platform will almost certainly 
coexist with other competing platforms within a product, but that isn’t 
something that will concern the homeowner so long as the whole thing 
simply works as it should.
✓
✓Incorporate most or all of the communication protocol standards 
(including necessary software and hardware) into one controller device, 
or hub. This hub would be able to automatically distinguish which pro-
tocols devices in the home are using and control them via specialized 
“bridge” software. This bridge software acts as a translator between the 
hub and the devices it is controlling.
Choosing the Single-Platform Path
This unity hiccup in the home automation universe just screams for someone 
to fix it, and several folks are stepping up to the plate to do just that. I show 
you a couple of companies that are working to help you in the quest for home 
automation harmony by providing a single-platform solution.

252
Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
Peeling Apple’s HomeKit
“Did he say ‘Apple’?”
Indeed, I did say Apple! And yes, I’m talking about the Mac and iPad maker. 
I totally understand if you’re confused by me leading this part of the chapter 
off with a company that hasn’t been a player in the home automation market 
on a large scale — at least not when it comes to controlling the devices in your 
entire home. Sure, Apple has more than dabbled in the home entertainment 
world (as I describe in Chapter 10), but the late, great Steve Jobs never showed 
any interest at all in totally running the show in regards to home automation.
Well, the good folks in Cupertino have very recently announced a little thing 
they call HomeKit, and it will become many a home automation fan’s best 
friend, particularly those using their iPhones or iPads to run their smart 
home (and let’s be honest — that’s most of us). With HomeKit, Apple is 
providing a common communication protocol that home automation device 
makers can incorporate into their products. When consumers purchase 
HomeKit-enabled devices, they can use the HomeKit app in iOS 8 to control 
them all. However, HomeKit does more than just offer simple on and off com-
mands to devices, as you soon discover.
Starting with HomeKit basics
Before I explain how HomeKit strong-arms your smart home into harmonic 
submission, take a look at what you need to get started:
✓
✓An iPhone or iPad
✓
✓iOS 8 installed on said iPhone or iPad
✓
✓The HomeKit app
✓
✓A bevy of HomeKit-enabled devices

The first three items on the preceding list are all provided by Apple, but what 
about the little gems mentioned in that last item? Apple has announced a 
who’s-who list of its initial partners who have all glommed on to the HomeKit 
initiative, and I’m more than happy to provide that list for you. Table 14-1 
gives you the name of Apple’s partners and their primary product focus (this 
does not represent the entirety of some of the company’s offerings, mind 
you) in the home automation market.
Making a scene with HomeKit
Yes, HomeKit can say “light, turn on” and “light, turn off,” but it’s up to doing 
more than just those menial chores. HomeKit provides you freedom from 
ever having to flick or adjust a light switch (and other devices) again by 
enabling you to program “scenes.”

Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
Scenes in HomeKit are sets of commands that you program for single or 
­multiple devices so that they turn on or off or adjust when given a single 
command. For example, if you’re having folks over for a dinner party you 
could program the following devices to perform the following tasks:
✓
✓Front and back porch lights turn on at full strength.
✓
✓Hall lights adjust to 75 percent strength.
✓
✓The thermostat is set to a comfy 72 degrees.
✓
✓The shades are all set to mid-height.
✓
✓Music and speakers are turned on and set to a particular station and 
volume level.
✓
✓Lights in the dining room are set to 50 percent.
✓
✓Ceiling fans on the back porch are engaged.
Once you’ve programmed these settings in HomeKit, you give them the 
title of Dinner Party. When the time comes for guests to begin arriving, you 
can tell Siri (the name of Apple’s voice recognition program used in iOS) 
to engage the Dinner Party setting. All the commands in the preceding list 
are enacted instantly, providing your guests with an entertainment atmo-
sphere they’ll tell their children’s children about. These settings are fixed, 
­changing only when you want them to, so if you frequently host dinner 
­parties you’ll be armed and ready the next time you feel like throwing a 
little soirée.
Of course, you can create all kinds of scenes to set up as you become more 
familiar with HomeKit, such as:
✓
✓Nighttime: Lock all the doors, set the alarms, turn out most of the lights, 
set the bathroom lights to low, turn on the baby monitor, and other 
sleepy time stuff.
✓
✓Morning: Get the coffee brewing, set the lights to brighten progressively 
as the morning marches on, set the kids’ alarms to wake them up (so 
hopefully you don’t have to), and so forth.
✓
✓Away from Home: Set certain lights (perhaps those on the porch, in 
the kitchen, the garage — you get the drift) to come on at various times 
of the day or night, set the alarms and locks, enable motion detectors, 
charge up the electric fence (hey, you never know what some folks will 
use to secure their homes), and the like.
✓
✓Date Night: Oh, yeah . . . pipe in the Barry White tunes (yes, he’s still 
the smoothest and the coolest), dim all the right lights, get the fire-
place going, and whatever else you can dream up to make the night 
right.

255

 Chapter 14: Controlling Your Home from One Platform
✓
✓Annoying Company: Make your lights flick on and off like your home  
is infested with a poltergeist, crank up the stereo with the most annoy-
ing sounds known to man (or create a track of your kids at the peak  
of a Halloween-candy-induced sugar craze), lower the thermostat to  
40 degrees, and set your smoke alarms to test. This combination is sure 
to make even the most ardent of annoying houseguests uncomfortable 
enough that they’ll be seeking asylum elsewhere in mere moments.
The number of scenes you can set up are limited only by your imagination 
and by the number of home automation devices that occupy your residence.
Much more will be forthcoming from Apple regarding HomeKit. Check their 
website at www.apple.com for updates. However, if you’d like to know

Wink-ing at Home Depot
It was only a matter of time before Home Depot jumped into the home 
automation ocean, and when it did it made quite a splash by partnering 
with Wink. Wink makes the mechanism for unifying your home automation 
devices, while Home Depot is working to be the provider for Wink-enabled 
devices from all manner of manufacturers; the two are working quite well 
together, it seems.
How Wink works
Wink has developed an API (application programming interface) that home 
auto-device manufacturers can incorporate into their devices. Once the API is 
part of a device, said device can be controlled via the Wink app, which runs 
on your iOS or Android smartphone. You can then control your home devices 
from anywhere in the world, so long as you have a connection to the Internet.
Will Apple take over the world (again)?
Apple is looking to be the company that bridges 
home automation devices for its users, and it 
has the brand recognition, resources, drive, 
talent, and business savvy to do just that. 
Since Apple is so deeply embedded into so 
many digital lives already, it only makes sense 
that the company would attempt to take this 
next step as a business. Of course, time will 
tell which of the companies in this chapter (or 
some other player yet to jump into the fray) 
becomes the company of choice in this area 
of home automation, but based on past experi-
ences with other markets, don’t bet against the 
Apple folks.

The whole thing basically works like this:
1.	Go to your local Home Depot or visit www.homedepot.com.
2.	Comb the store shelves or the website for products that feature the 
Wink app or Wink Hub logo (shown in Figure 14-1) on their packaging.  
A white logo (instead of blue) indicates that a Wink hub is required to 
use the product with the Wink app and other Wink-compatible devices.
3.	Download the Wink app to your iPhone or Android smartphone. Open it 
and create a Wink account. (There is currently no support for the iPad 
or for Android tablets, but that will be alleviated soon. Check with Wink 
at www.winkapp.com for availability.)
4.	If you purchased the Wink hub, install it per the instructions in the Wink 
app (download it before trying to set up your hub). You can get more 
information here: www.winkapp.com/faq#winkhub. Once your Wink 
hub is installed, it will communicate with the Wink Cloud. (Wink keeps 
up with your account and devices through the company’s cloud comput-
ing network.)
Since the Wink app and hub work through the Wink Cloud, if your 
home’s Internet connection goes down you will not be able to control 
your Wink-compatible devices via the Wink app. That doesn’t mean your 
house is under some kind of Wink-induced lockdown; it simply means 
you have to revert to doing things the old-fashioned way until your 
Internet connection is restored.
5.	Set up or install the Wink-compatible product you purchased from Home 
Depot.
6.	Follow the super-simple (for most products, anyway) instructions found 
in the Wink app for adding the product to your list of Wink-controlled 
devices.
7.	Sit back and relax while Wink makes your life simpler by a hundred fold.

 Chapter 14: Controlling Your Home from One Platform
The Wink App logo has a light blue background with a white picture of a 
house, and indicates that the product will work directly with the Wink app 
with no need for a Wink hub. The Wink Hub logo has a white background 
with a light blue picture of a house, and indicates that the product must be 
used in conjunction with a Wink hub.
Home Depot’s partnership with Wink
Your local Home Depot store or the Home Depot website (www.homedepot.
com) are the best places to go to find products that are Wink-compatible. The 
advantage of going to the store is obviously the hands-on experience, but the 
advantage to the website is the capability to see all Wink-compatible prod-
ucts quickly and in one location.
For information about the Wink app or hub, skip Home Depot and go directly 
to Wink’s website. The site has tons of information on how the app and hub 
work together and with compatible products, and the FAQ section is great for 
finding answers to your more technical questions. Visit www.winkapp.com 
for more info.
Wink supports a wide range of devices and manufacturers. The Wink hub cur-
rently works well with Z-Wave, ZigBee, Bluetooth LE, Wi-Fi, Lutron ClearConnect, 
and Kidde home automation communication protocols. However, not all proto-
cols are supported (such as INSTEON), so do your due diligence.
Opting for Multi-Protocol Solutions
Perhaps you’ve been tinkering with home automation for a little while and 
you have a few devices that don’t speak the same language (protocol). Or 
maybe you’ve found several items you’d like to use but are worried that 
you’ll be swimming in a sea of apps since none of them seem to be compat-
ible with one another. Whatever the case, in the following sections, I intro-
duce you to some folks who are able to tie up all your loose home automation 
ends into neat bows of automation goodness.
Revolv-ing around a hub
Revolv is a company on a mission: to make any device you own work with 
and through its solution, which is the Revolv hub and its accompanying 
app. Since manufacturers of home automation equipment often use different 
types of communication protocols (ZigBee, INSTEON, and so forth), Revolv’s 
approach to bridging the communication and interaction gap is to simply 
include all those protocols (along with their necessary hardware) into the 
Revolv hub. Once a device is connected to the hub, it can be controlled and 

258
Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
paired with other devices using the Revolv app, which is supported by both 
iOS and Android devices.
Setting up a Revolv hub
The folks at Revolv have developed a nice product for creating unity among 
your home automation devices, and it’s obvious they’ve put a lot of effort 
into their “one hub, one app” solution.
Out-of-the-box setup of the hub is simple and straightforward:
1.	Place the hub in a central location of your home to provide maximum 
wireless coverage for your devices.
2.	Connect the hub to a power supply.
3.	Download the Revolv app for your preferred device (smartphone or 
tablet) from the iOS or Android App Store.
4.	Link the hub to your Wi-Fi.
This can be done through a really cool process involving your smart-
phone “flashing” (called “FlashLink” by Revolv) the security credentials 
for your wireless network into the Revolv hub using the LED flash on 
your smartphone, as shown in Figure 14-2.
5.	Use the Revolv app to automatically discover devices that have 
­connected with the hub, or manually find them on your network.


 Chapter 14: Controlling Your Home from One Platform
You may now control your devices using the Revolv hub and app solution. 
Easy peasy, as my daughter says. I think Revolv is on to something here.
Updates and compatible devices
You can acquire the Revolv hub and app for a one-time price; it charges 
no monthly subscription fee to use the services (as some companies may 
charge), which is a very nice plus in my estimation. All updates to the sup-
ported protocols and the app are also free, and those are additional high 
marks for the Revolv solution.
Revolv has compiled quite a nice list of compatible devices, manufactured by 
the likes of:
✓
✓Belkin
✓
✓GE
✓
✓Honeywell
✓
✓INSTEON
✓
✓Leviton
✓
✓Nest
✓
✓Philips
✓
✓Sonos
✓
✓Trane
. . . and the list keeps growing! Visit www.revolv.com/devices for an up-to-
the-minute listing of manufacturers and devices.
Of course, I recommend you check out www.revolv.com for more informa-
tion, including a great video that shows how to set up a Revolv hub and dem-
onstrating the “flashing” technique I describe earlier in this chapter.
Building your CastleOS
CastleOS is seeking to bring unity into the home automation space by doing 
things a bit differently than Apple or Revolv, mainly because it is a Microsoft 
Windows–based system. CastleOS can also use a Microsoft Kinect system, 
which allows you to deliver speech commands to your home automation 
devices. So if you’re someone who is completely anti-Apple and gung ho, 
­pro-Microsoft, CastleOS will be right up your alley! (That’s intended as a joke, 
by the way.)

260
Part IV: Taking Command of Your Home Automation Systems 
The aforementioned computing platform prejudices are in no way prerequi-
sites for using CastleOS. The basic system software runs from a Windows-
based computer, but the software that controls your home automation 
devices can run on any device that has a web browser. This means that 
if you have a Mac, a Linux-based computer, an iOS device, or an Android 
device, you can still use CastleOS for your home automation needs. I should 
also mention that if you don’t own a Windows-based computer but still want 
to use CastleOS, the company does provide stand-alone mini-computers that 
run the CastleOS software.
How CastleOS works
CastleOS states that it is a “protocol-agnostic system” and its product is 
intended for use with “any and all home automation protocols,” which is a 
very good thing for you and me. So, if you’re someone who has a plethora 
of devices running the gamut of home automation protocols (or if you’re 
still working on purchasing said plethora), CastleOS just might be a good 
bet for you.
The first part of the CastleOS puzzle is the Core Service, which acts as the 
central hub for controlling all the home automation devices in your house. 
The Core Service software is installed on a Windows-based computer and 
communicates with your home automation devices via your network.
Accessing the apps
The second piece that is needed to control your devices is one of the 
CastleOS remote access apps. Currently, CastleOS works with an HTML app 
(shown in Figure 14-3) and the Microsoft Kinect (for voice control); CastleOS 
is working on providing native iOS and Android apps as of this writing.
Any device that can run a web browser can access the HTML app:
✓
✓Computers: Any web browser will do to access the CastleOS HTML app.
✓
✓iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod): Safari is the recommended browser, 
but other web browser apps can be tried if Safari isn’t your cup of tea.
✓
✓Android devices (smartphones and tablets): Google’s Chrome browser 
is recommended, since it is the native browser for the Android system.
✓
✓Windows Mobile, BlackBerry, and others: Use your browser of choice.
The Kinect app is where the coolness factor is kicked up a notch. Using 
your Kinect, you can tell CastleOS exactly what to do. If you’re a fan of Star 
Trek you’ll instantly pick up on the verbiage: “Computer, turn on the lights,” 
“Computer, turn on the television,” and so on. The Kinect relays your voice 
commands to the CastleOS Core Service software in an instant and executes 
them with authority!

CastleOS turns EPIC
Chris Cicchitelli is the brains behind CastleOS. 
His idea for home automation was so cool that 
Destination America’s EPIC television program 
featured Chris and his family on the show! Mind 
you, the segment does show Chris doing a bit 
more than simply setting up the CastleOS soft-
ware, such as installing wiring and all that jazz, 
but don’t be put off by that. CastleOS is meant 
to be a simple do-it-yourself home automation 
control and unification solution, not a home 
wiring nightmare.

as in-depth product information and support, at

Link(sys)ing with Staples Connect
Staples and Linksys have partnered together to create the Staples Connect 
brand of home automation unification. Connect is yet another app-hub com-
bination, but it does distinguish itself from the competition in a few ways that 
you’ll soon discover.
Staples has partnered with several home automation companies to make 
sure that their products work with the Connect system, and the Connect 
hub comes with several of the most common home automation protocols 
installed, so you have a wide range of products to choose from should you go 
with the Staples/Linksys solution.
How Staples Connect works
The Connect app talks to the Connect hub, which in turn talks to the 
Connect-compatible devices in your home. This is pretty standard, as you’ve 
seen so far with other companies in this chapter, but a couple of differences 
make Connect stand out:
✓
✓Connect uses a web app, along with iOS and Android apps, to control 
your devices. This affords more options for control of your devices than 
some of the other folks discussed so far. You can get the app at both the 
iOS and Android App Stores.
✓
✓The iOS and Android apps can run on the iPad and Android-enabled tab-
lets, respectively, while others are currently limited to the iPhone and 
Android smartphones.
The Connect hub contains hardware and software needed to control devices 
running Wi-Fi, Z-Wave, and Lutron ClearConnect protocols. While this seems 
more limited than other options, plans to add support for INSTEON, ZigBee, 
and Bluetooth are in the works.
The Staples Connect system is as simple as any other on the market to put 
into action:
1.	Head over to your local Staples store or visit the Staples Connect site to 
find compatible devices and to purchase the Connect hub.
2.	Download the Staples Connect app from the Apple App Store or Android 
App Store, depending on your device.
3.	Create an account by tapping the Sign Up button, as seen in Figure 14-4, or 
use your credentials to sign in with an existing account if you have one.
4.	After you create and activate your account, you will receive a setup 
guide that walks you through simply and quickly adding devices to the 

263

 Chapter 14: Controlling Your Home from One Platform
Connect hub. This guide is a great help, so bookmark it in your browser 
or create a PDF of the page and save it for future use.
5.	Install the Connect hub to your existing Wi-Fi router and follow the 
instructions in your app or the setup guide for completing setup.
6.	Add devices to your Connect hub as instructed, and start home 
­automating!
A successful partnership
I’ll be honest: I’ve always thought of Staples as a place to go to purchase 
office products and the like, not as a go-to store for my home needs. 
However, I must say that through its partnership with Linksys, Staples has 
done as good a job as anyone with its Connect initiative. I give especially 
high marks to the Staples Connect website (www.staples.com/sbd/cre/
marketing/staples-connect/), which is a great place to learn not just 
more about Connect, but also about home automation in general. The site 
has some great articles and a nice FAQ that help home automation newbies 
hit the ground running. Kudos to Staples for educating the public about 
home automation!

The end-all, be-all in home automation?
You may be wondering why a product or ser-
vice you’ve heard of or even used is nowhere 
to be found in this chapter. I believe that the 
companies I mention in this chapter are the 
best folks out there in the unification game. 
That’s not to say others aren’t doing a good job 
of bringing the home automation chaos into a 
more controlled state, though.
None of the products and services I mention 
is a catch-all for every little (and not-so-little) 
home automation need. Some do a better job at 
supporting protocols, while others do a better 
job with their app interfaces. In short, there is 
no end-all, be-all company. The home auto-
mation game is still in its infancy, so there are 
bound to be bumps in the road along the way to 
home automation harmony.
That said, don’t be surprised if one of them, or 
perhaps an unforeseen newcomer, does take up 
that “end-all, be-all” mantle in the near future.

U
 
p to this point, I’ve discussed the 411 on home automation in today’s 
technical environment, and I’ve covered the gamut from the simplest 
of devices to install and set up to the more labor-intensive ones (even some 
that require professional installation). What I now want to do is wade you 
gently into the smart home automation pool.
Some folks like to take things easy when venturing into something new or 
different, especially when it comes to technology. I have family who were 
hesitant about getting cellular phones, and when they bought their first one 
it was just the most basic of devices: phone calls only, thank you very much, 
with the Internet button avoided like the plague. Now, those same folks have 
the latest and greatest in smartphones, and are even finding themselves fre-
quently using Facebook and downloading apps at a rapid-fire rate. Sometimes 
all it takes is getting your feet a little wet to make you want to dive headlong 
into the deep.
If that description sounds like you, then this chapter is right up your alley. 
I want this to be your jumping-off point if you aren’t sure where to begin or if 
you just want to get a feel for the technology. In this chapter, I go over some 
of the simplest surefire devices that you can use to start automating your 
home quickly and easily. Please keep in mind that I am in no way endorsing 
these devices over any others, with the exception, of course, that they are 
the simplest home automation devices that I’ve found when it comes to how 
quickly you can be up and running after you unbox them. Onward!

Wink
I speak a bit about Wink (and its relationship to Home Depot) in Chapter 14, 
but now I’d like to introduce you to some of the great products Wink offers.
The Wink platform allows you to use some home automation devices with-
out need of the Wink hub (see Figure 15-1), while other devices require it. 
Whether a device needs the hub or not depends on how its manufacturer 
designed it. In some cases, it isn’t a matter of whether the manufacturer 
wants the device to use the hub or not, but the hub may simply be a 
­necessity based on the nature of the device.
The Wink hub connects to your Wi-Fi router so that it not only can connect 
Wink-enabled devices in your home to your smart device, but also so that 
you can control your smart devices when you’re away.
A Wink-enabled device is one that incorporates the Wink software. Wink  
software allows the device to communicate with the Wink hub and Wink app 
on your smart device, as well as with other Wink-enabled devices. For example, 
a motion sensor from one company will work with a lighting system from 
another company to trigger the lighting based on movement within the home.
I first take a look at some of the Wink-enabled products that don’t require the 
use of the Wink hub in order for you to control them with the Wink app on 
your iOS or Android smartphone or tablet.

 Chapter 15: Ten Easy Ways to Begin Automating Your Home 
As I mention in Chapter 14, items that do not require the use of the Wink hub 
will have the light blue Wink logo with white lettering on their packages.
Philips Hue products
You meet the Philips Hue line of smart LED light bulbs back in Chapter 6, but 
that chapter mainly focuses on the A19 size bulbs, which replace standard 
60-watt bulbs that you screw into an everyday lamp socket. That isn’t all that 
Philips has to offer when it comes to automated lighting, though. However, 
I first want to tackle some reasons I think the Hue products belong in this 
chapter:
✓
✓They’re great products. Hue products are not only simple to use and set 
up, which is a criterion for this chapter, but they also work exactly as 
advertised.
✓
✓Hue devices work nicely with other home automation platforms or on 
their own.
✓
✓What could be simpler than screwing in a light bulb?
Using standard A19 Hue bulbs is a great idea for your entire home, but 
Philips also has other Hue lighting devices that are worth checking into, 
and they’re just as simple to set up as the A19 bulbs. Philips refers to these 
devices as Friends of Hue (FoH, for the cool kids in the audience).
The LivingColors Iris, shown in Figure 15-2, and the LivingColors Bloom are 
wonderfully stylish lamps that incorporate the Hue technology. All you  
have to do is plug them in and link them to the Hue bridge, and you can  
then control them using the Hue app or the Wink app.
Why use the Wink app?
Your automated lighting comes with its own 
app, as does your front-door lock. Come to 
think of it, your motion sensors have their own 
apps, too. So why bother with the Wink app? 
I answer that with another question: “Why 
not use one app instead of three?” That’s 
what the Wink app can do for you. As long 
as your devices are Wink-enabled, they will 
work within the Wink ecosystem, meaning 
you can control all the devices from one app, 
even though they may all be made by different 
manufacturers.

270
Part V: The Part of Tens 
Another awesome Hue product is the popular Philips LightStrips (see 
Figure 15-3). LightStrips are strips of light (flexible plastic strips that contain 
LED lights) that you can bend and shape into whatever form you like, allowing 
you to place them in areas most lights just can’t go. You can give your home 
an incredible new look by placing them under cabinets, behind beds, and 
other areas you normally wouldn’t think of placing a light. And don’t forget, 
you can change their colors to match your mood, decor, or whatever else 
strikes your fancy. They make really great night lights, too.

271

 Chapter 15: Ten Easy Ways to Begin Automating Your Home 
You will need a Hue starter kit, which comes with the Hue bridge, in order 
to use the Iris, the Bloom, and the LightStrips with your Hue network. It’s 
this bridge that connects your Hue devices to your W-Fi, and therefore the 
Internet and your smart devices.
The lights in the LivingColors Iris and Bloom do not use the same type of 
LEDs as the original Hue bulbs. Instead, they use RGB to create their colors, 
which can explain why the colors they generate may sometimes slightly differ 
from the original bulbs, even when choosing the same color from the color 
picker in the app.
Dropcam
Security is one of the major reasons folks are moving toward home automation, 
and webcams are a large part of the solution.
Dropcam is one of the leaders in the field of webcams for home automation, 
like the one shown in Figure 15-4, and its cameras work hand-in-hand with 
the Wink app. The original Dropcam, along with the Dropcam Pro, provide 
streaming video and audio so that you can see and hear what’s going on in 
your home, even when you’re a million miles away (as long as you have an 
Internet connection that far away, of course).

Here are some of the features that come with Dropcam:
✓
✓The original Dropcam has a great 107-degree viewable area, while the 
Pro has an impressive 130-degree view. You’ll be able to view most areas 
in any room of your home.
✓
✓Both cameras can zoom in so you can get a closer look. Dropcam has a 
4X zoom, while the Pro sports up to 8X.
✓
✓Dropcams also act as a spy, detecting motion and sound in a room and 
sending you notifications upon detection.
✓
✓Dropcams contain a microphone and a speaker, allowing you to 
­communicate with the folks in the room where the Dropcam is located. 
Wouldn’t it be cool to tell Fido to get off the furniture when you are 
across the country?
✓
✓Night vision is built into the Dropcams, so even at night you’ll get clear 
streaming video. Dropcam Pro may be the better of the two in terms of 
night vision clarity.
You can do much more with Dropcam cameras, and they’re a cinch to set up:
1.	Plug in your Dropcam’s power cord.
2.	Discover the Dropcam with your Dropcam app.
3.	Begin watching and listening to the goings-on in the room where your 
Dropcam resides.

Nest Protect
You’re probably familiar with the Nest thermostat, as is most of the free 
world, but what about the newest Nest product, the Nest Protect?
Nest Protect (see Figure 15-5) is a smart smoke and carbon monoxide ­detector, 
providing alerts to you on your iOS or Android device if there’s a problem. 
Nest Protect will even talk to you in a remarkably human-sounding voice!
Nest Protect comes in two models: one battery-powered and the other wired. 
Both use a variety of methods to alert you to a potential problem:
✓
✓Voice alerts
✓
✓Alarms
✓
✓Notifications on your smartphone or tablet

273

 Chapter 15: Ten Easy Ways to Begin Automating Your Home 
Voice alerts are very specific to the problem. You’ll hear something like 
“Heads up, there’s smoke in the dining room” and other warnings that tell 
you the nature of the problem and where it is.
Nest Protect also has a light ring around the Nest button, which helps identify 
the level of the threat based on the color of the light. A really neat feature  
of the light is that when the Nest Protect detects motion at night it can 
turn on the light ring to help illuminate your way. I think that’s just a really 
thoughtful feature from the folks at Nest, demonstrating their attention to 
detail and functionality. Thumbs up, Nest!
Setting up your Nest Protect is simple, too:
1.	Unbox the Nest Protect.
2.	Download the Nest Mobile app from your iOS or Android App Store.
3.	Open the app and create a Nest account, or sign in to your existing 
account.
4.	Tap the icon for adding a smoke and CO alarm.
5.	Scan the code on the back of your Nest Protect with your smartphone or 
tablet’s camera.
6.	Pull the blue tab all the way out of your Nest Protect.
7.	Open your smartphone’s or tablet’s network settings and connect to the 
Nest Protect network.

8.	Go back to the Nest app on your device and enter information for your 
home Wi-Fi when prompted. You’ll want to have your Wi-Fi network’s 
password handy.
9.	Your Nest Protect will literally tell you when it’s successfully connected 
to the Internet.
10.	Tell your Nest Protect which room it is in; you do this through the  
Nest app.
11.	Install your Nest Protect in the room, following the directions needed 
based on the model you have.
Now that the Nest is set up, you can use the Wink app to control it without 
having to revert back to the Nest app.

Quirky, Inc., is a company that helps inventors make their dreams come true. 
Denny Fong of Toronto, Canada, was the inventor of one of Quirky’s niftiest 
devices, the Spotter, shown in Figure 15-6.

 Chapter 15: Ten Easy Ways to Begin Automating Your Home 
The Spotter is a sensor. Okay, to be more accurate, it’s a really smart sensor. 
Fine, you dragged it out of me: The Spotter is actually five sensors in one  
awesome and small package. Because Spotter is so small (it’s not tiny, 
mind you), you can place it almost anywhere, and because its design is so 
­streamlined, it won’t be an eyesore. The Spotter uses sensors to detect:
✓
✓Sound
✓
✓Motion
✓
✓Humidity
✓
✓Light
✓
✓Temperature
These sensors will keep an eye on any area of the home in which you place 
them. If you really want to keep tabs on the place, get multiple sensors and 
place them all over.
You set up Spotter using the Wink app on your smartphone or tablet, and 
it’s as easy as turning the Spotter on and holding your smart device close 
enough to detect it. Once your Spotter is activated, you can set up rules for 
it, such as alerting you when the clothes dryer is finished, or when a door is 
opened. The number of uses for Spotter are limited only by your imagination.
Spotter can be placed virtually anywhere, too, since it can be mounted in 
three different ways:
✓
✓Screws
✓
✓Adhesive backing
✓
✓Built-in magnet
I think Spotter is one of the more useful of what I consider to be “bare-bones-
basic” home automation technologies. Check out more about Spotter at  
www.quirky.com/shop/609.
Quirky+GE Pivot Power Genius
Quirky’s at it again, but this time with the help of GE, with the Pivot Power 
Genius (see Figure 15-7). The Pivot Power Genius is a power strip that does 
so much more than the traditional rectangular kind that we’re all used to. 
Pivot Power Genius is a smart device, meaning you can control the power for 
each outlet on the strip, effectively allowing you to turn connected devices 
on or off from your smartphone or tablet.

276
Part V: The Part of Tens 
While I love the capability to work with smart devices, my favorite feature 
may be its least technical: the fact that the power strip bends at each outlet. 
This allows you to accommodate various plug sizes and to also fit nontradi-
tional spaces. With old-fashioned power strips, you have to place the large 
blocky plugs in the last outlet or you would end up covering another outlet, 
and sometimes the blocky plugs are so heavy they don’t stay in the outlet 
because there’s no support for them at the end of the strip. Pivot Power 
Genius corrects those issues, and looks pretty cool, too.
Go to www.quirky.com/shop/633 to see a video showing how easy it is to 
set up the Pivot Power Genius using the Wink app on your smart device.
The next two devices I describe require the Wink hub be installed on your 
network to use them, but I don’t consider that a bummer. The Wink hub opens 
the proverbial door for you to add so many other devices to your home auto-
mation system that it’s worth the relatively low cost to purchase it.
Leviton Dimming Plug-In Lamp Module
Don’t want to install new wiring to automate your lamps? Prefer to use your 
traditional bulbs as opposed to the smart LED variety but still want the ease 
and benefits of home automation? Do you have a Wink hub or are strongly 
considering getting one?
If you answered yes to those questions, Leviton has just what you need: the 
DZPD3 Dimming Plug-In Lamp Module, shown in Figure 15-8.

 Chapter 15: Ten Easy Ways to Begin Automating Your Home 
This thing couldn’t be any simpler:
1.	Plug your lamp into the DZPD3.
2.	Plug the DZPD3 into an electrical outlet.
3.	Fire up the Wink app on your smartphone or tablet and discover the 
DZPD3. You now have full control over the dimmer using your Wink app.
Since your Wink hub is Z-Wave–compatible, your DZPD3 will work with it and 
the Wink app, allowing you to dim, turn on or off, or set up rules and scenes 
for your module. Buy multiple dimmers so that you can control the lights 
throughout your home.
Find the DZPD3 at Wink’s product site: www.wink.com/products/leviton-

Quirky Tripper
How would you like to use your smartphone or tablet as a personal security 
guard? It won’t be able to toss unwanted intruders out on their ears, but it 
can alert you to a problem so that you or someone else can handle it. How 
can such a magical wonder be?
The folks at Quirky are rather busy, and they show up in this chapter yet 
again with another fine product: the Tripper. Tripper is a good-looking, and 
surprisingly small, sensor that you place on any doors, cabinets, or windows 
that you want to keep up with. You can dream up countless ways to use 
Tripper, shown in Figure 15-9.

✓
✓Place it on cabinets to alert you when the kids are trying to get snacks 
(or worse, into the cleaning supplies).
✓
✓Place one on your front and back doors to alert you when someone 
enters the home.
✓
✓Put a Tripper on windows so that you know when they’re open 
and closed.
✓
✓Combine Tripper with your lighting system so that your lights come on 
when a door is opened.
✓
✓Tripper can be linked to your thermostat so that when a window is 
closed your thermostat will automatically begin cooling or heating, or 
when a window is opened your thermostat can shut off, saving you some 
serious coin on your electric bill.
Tripper works with your Wink hub and app to provide you with control and 
alerts no matter where you are, with the standard caveat that an Internet 
connection is required.
Uses for Tripper are almost endless: All you have to do is think of what you’ll 
do with it. Quirky has done it again, in my humble opinion. Take a gander at 
the Tripper at www.quirky.com/shop/706.

WeMo
This isn’t the first time I mention WeMo in this book, for sure, but since this 
chapter is about devices that are crazy-simple to start your home automation 
adventure, WeMo has to be included.
Belkin’s WeMo line of affordable home automation products are some of the 
simplest to set up and use, and they’re also just plain good devices. WeMo 
devices don’t need a hub, either — even better! WeMo devices communicate 
with your iOS or Android smart device through your Wi-Fi network and the 
Internet, with nothing in between.
Time to meet a few of the WeMo devices that the home automation newbie 
would be wise to investigate before splurging on something else.
Insight Switch
Belkin’s WeMo Insight Switch is much like other smart switches in the fact 
that it enables you to remotely turn on and off any devices that are plugged 
into it. But that’s where similarities begin to fade.
Belkin also offers a WeMo Switch, which does much of what the Insight 
Switch does:
✓
✓Turns electronic appliances on and off.
✓
✓Uses the WeMo app on your smartphone or tablet to control and 
­monitor devices.
✓
✓Can schedule times for devices to power on or off.
✓
✓Plugs into any standard 120-volt electrical outlet.
However, the Insight Switch, shown in Figure 15-10, also gives you insight 
(clever of me, don’t you think?) into how much power your devices are using, 
which makes it kind of like a technical tattletale, but when it’s your dollars 
going to the power company you’ll be glad to overlook the tattling part. 
Insight Switch does more than just tattle, though:
✓
✓Insight monitors usage of devices, such as the amount of time a device 
has been on.
✓
✓Insight provides an estimate of the power costs for devices plugged into it.
✓
✓Insight can send you an email detailing power consumption for devices 
you’re using with it.

Visit www.belkin.com/us/F7C029/p/P-F7C029/ (sorry for the weird 
URL, but that’s how Belkin rolls) to learn more about the Insight Switch and 
ways you can use it in your home automation environment.
The WeMo Insight Switch can use IFTTT (IF This Then That) recipes to 
customize your automated lighting experience. Scroll to the bottom of the 
aforementioned website for the Insight Switch to see more information about 
using it with IFTTT.
NetCam
Belkin’s NetCam Wi-Fi–capable web camera is also part of the WeMo universe 
of home automation products. There are actually two models of NetCam 
cameras, but I want to point you to the NetCam HD+ Wi-Fi Camera with Glass 
Lens and Night Vision.
Yes, that is the actual name of the camera. Don’t fret, though; I just call it the 
NetCam from here on.
As you can see in Figure 15-11, the NetCam is one cool-looking device, 
and you can place it just about anywhere; you can even mount it on  
a wall.
Figure 15-10:


 Chapter 15: Ten Easy Ways to Begin Automating Your Home 
Belkin has packed a lot of good stuff into this little camera:
✓
✓Night vision helps you clearly see who’s sneaking snacks from the fridge.
✓
✓The built-in microphone and speaker enable you to justly scold the 
scoundrel you caught sneaking a snack in the middle of the night, and 
even hear his whimpering retort.
✓
✓Motion sensors help you know when activity is taking place, such as 
someone skulking around in said kitchen.
✓
✓A wide viewing angle ensures you’ll see as much of your room as  
you need.
✓
✓Use the WeMo app to control your NetCam.
In addition to those great features, you can subscribe to Belkin’s Cloud+ 
Premium Services, which lets you store your streaming video in the cloud. 
This allows you to view the video at your leisure.
Setting up the NetCam is almost laughably (in a good way) easy:
1.	Install the NetCam app on your iOS or Android smart device.
2.	Plug your NetCam into an electrical outlet.
3.	Flip up the switch on the back of NetCam.
4.	Join the NetCam network by going to the network settings on your iOS 
or Android smart device.

282
Part V: The Part of Tens 
5.	Open the NetCam app and follow along with the instructions for adding 
your NetCam to your network.
6.	Create a Belkin account so you can register your NetCam. You’ll 
be able to use this account to view your NetCam’s video on other 
devices, too.
7.	Flip the switch on the back of your NetCam downward, and now you’re 
done with set up.
Keep your Wi-Fi network’s password close at hand if you don’t know it. You 
need it in Step 5 of the setup process.
Once setup is complete, you can begin immediately viewing streaming 
video from your NetCam on your smartphone or tablet. Just a heads-up 
for parents: Your kids will grow to hate NetCam because they won’t be 
able to get away with nearly as much stuff as they used to. You, however, 
will love it.
Thanks (the most sarcastic kind you can imagine) to Belkin for giving me 
another odd URL to pass along to you to discover more about NetCam:  
www.belkin.com/us/F7D7606/p/P-F7D7606/.
LED Lighting
Way back in Chapter 6, I introduce you to the WeMo way of automating your 
home’s lighting using Belkin’s LED Lighting Starter Set. I’m not going to bore 
you with the details since they are discussed in the aforementioned chapter, 
but I do want to remind you about it in this chapter.
I also want to clue you into something else, though: A little company called 
Osram Sylvania likes WeMo’s LED lighting so much that it has decided to 
partner with Belkin on making home automation lighting even better. To 
kick off the partnership, Sylvania has released a WeMo-compatible bulb, 
the Ultra iQ LED BR30 smart light bulb. (Why can’t these home automation 
folks come up with better names for this stuff?) The Ultra iQ LED BR30, 
shown in Figure 15-12, is intended for recessed lighting needs, so Sylvania 
and Belkin are beginning to fill in gaps in the WeMo line of lighting products. 
Ultra iQ bulbs are long-lasting: up to 50 years of life (based on using them 
for 3 hours a day)! There is much more automated lighting goodness to 
come from this partnership, but for now, the Ultra iQ LED BR30 is the only 
fruit borne of it.

283

 Chapter 15: Ten Easy Ways to Begin Automating Your Home 
The Ultra iQ LED BR30 works with the WeMo app and the WeMo Link, just as 
Belkin’s own WeMo smart bulbs do:
✓
✓Control your Ultra iQ bulb remotely.
✓
✓Set a schedule for your Ultra iQ to turn on or off.
✓
✓Pair the Ultra iQ bulbs with your other WeMo lights to create lighting scenes.
If you already have a WeMo Link and are using WeMo bulbs, give the Ultra 
iQ a look if you also have recessed lighting that you’d like to control from 
the WeMo app. As ever, I leave you with an ever-annoyingly vague URL for 
this WeMo-compatible product: www.belkin.com/us/72627-Belkin/
p/P-72627/.

Ten Great Websites for  
Home Automation
In This Chapter
▶
▶Discovering the best sites on the web for home automation
▶
▶Finding out what each site offers
▶
▶Shopping for home automation products online
I
 
n this day of everything-is-connected-ness, most of us frequently hit the 
Internet when we want to learn more about a certain topic, find the best 
shopping bargains, get quick tips on performing a task, catch the latest news, 
find out how the latest movies fared with the critics, and so on. It’s no differ-
ent with home automation, to be certain. The web is packed with information 
on home automation topics, covering anything from task how-to’s to buying 
the latest products at the best prices.
In this chapter, I introduce you to ten of my favorite home automation sites 
on the web. Some of them are great places to shop, others are chock-full of 
info for getting things done, and still others are a mix of these and more. I can 
attest to having become well acquainted with each of these sites, and they are 
the ten best that I’ve found as of this writing for covering the ever-broadening 
topic of home automation.
By the way, these sites are discussed in no particular order. I’m not playing 
favorites here: just giving you lots of great information.
Smarthome
The folks at Smarthome have been doing the home automation thing since 
1992, so I’d say they know a thing or two about the subject. Their website, 
Chapter 16

286
Part V: The Part of Tens 
www.smarthome.com, has been a home automation staple on the Internet 
since 1995.
Smarthome.com, shown in Figure 16-1, offers a huge range of home automation 
devices covering the following and more:
✓
✓Lighting controls
✓
✓Security
✓
✓Home theater
✓
✓Thermostats and energy controls
✓
✓Pet care
Smarthome.com also provides other products for making life within your 
home “smarter,” such as:
✓
✓Smart clothing
✓
✓Personal safety products
✓
✓Weather stations
✓
✓Items for your automobile
Smarthome.com really wants to be your one-stop online shop for all things 
home automation; its range of product choices is impressive. However, 
there is one potential sticking point: Smarthome.com is owned by SmartLabs, 
Figure 16-1:   
Smarthome.
com offers a 
huge range 
of products, 
focusing 
mainly on 
INSTEON 
technologies.

287

 Chapter 16: Ten Great Websites for Home Automation
Inc., which manufactures its own line of home automation products. The 
potential sticking point I mention has nothing to do with SmartLabs, which 
is a fine company, but with its reliance on INSTEON as its home automation 
­communication protocol of choice. Don’t get me wrong — INSTEON is great. 
But if you are someone who doesn’t already incorporate INSTEON devices 
into your home automation environment or you simply have an aversion to 
them in general, then Smarthome.com may not be the best place on the web 
for you.
CNET
If you’re a tech-savvy person, CNET may already be a site that you check out 
on a frequent basis. Being someone who fancies himself in the tech-savvy 
category, I often pay CNET a visit, but I must confess my surprise at just how 
much CNET knows about home automation. Everyone knows that CNET is a 
great place to go for reviews on software and computing, smartphones, and 
other tech devices, but it’s only been relatively recent that most folks have 
started thinking of their homes as part of their tech lives. Since our homes 
are becoming as technical as seemingly everything else in the known universe, 
CNET is on board with a great site for product reviews: www.cnet.com/
topics/smart-home.
A visit to CNET’s Smart Home site is prescribed for anyone who wants the 
lowdown on the latest and greatest home automation devices. My favorite 
part of the site is the list of best home automation devices, in which it  
ranks the top-of-the-line products in several categories, including (but  
not limited to):
✓
✓Smart hubs
✓
✓Smart thermostats
✓
✓Security monitoring
✓
✓Locks
You can access this list by clicking the Best Smart Home Devices tab on the 
site, shown in Figure 16-2.
CNET excels (in my humble opinion) in its video reviews. The video reviews 
are great because they give you a sense of seeing the product in action — an 
almost hands-on approach to investigating a product.

CEA
The stated mission of the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) is to grow 
the consumer electronics market, and since home automation definitely fits 
within the consumer electronics spectrum CEA is very much interested in its 
comings and goings.
CEA deals with both the companies that produce electronics devices and 
the folks who consume them (I bet you that’s how it came up with its name). 
Since this is the case, you can trust the CEA to look out for the interests of 
both parties. As consumers, you’re mainly interested in what CEA can do for 
you in that respect.
A visit to www.ce.org (note there’s no “a” in the URL) will present you with 
a huge amount of information. You can easily navigate to the home automa-
tion content by holding your mouse pointer over the Consumer Info tab on 
the home page and selecting Home Systems from the list of items (shown in 
Figure 16-3).
CEA’s Home Systems web page provides several great videos for helping you 
gain an understanding of home automation systems and what you can do to 
enhance your home.
A couple of other areas of interest on the Home Systems web page are the 
Want It? and Got It? sections.

 Chapter 16: Ten Great Websites for Home Automation
The Want It? section lists several articles that deal with home automation 
technologies that you may be interested in. Each article explains how each 
technology works and how to get started.
The Got It? section sports articles that discuss devices you already have and 
how to get the most use out of them.
SmartThings
Smart Things, found at www.smartthings.com, is one of the better-known 
companies working in the “Internet of Things” space, and it is a major player 
in the home automation arena. Its website is also quite a place for home auto-
mation junkies to hang out and learn a thing or ten about making things “just 
work.”
The site offers a multitude of fare:
✓
✓You can download the SmartThings app, which is quite nice for running 
your home automation environment.
✓
✓Shop the entire lineup of SmartThings products, including the popular 
Home Starter Kits.
✓
✓Share your experiences with SmartThings devices and gain knowledge 
from other SmartThings aficionados in the Community section.

My favorite section is the blog. The SmartThings blog is jam-packed with  
information on how to use your SmartThings devices, understanding technolo-
gies that will make your foray into home automation more productive (such as 
learning about wireless network repeaters and range), and more.
The blog also touts SmartThings’ affection for IFTTT. IFTTT is pronounced 
“ift” (like “gift” without the “g”), and it stands for If This Then That. IFTTT 
uses commands called recipes that enable you to make connections between 
web apps. SmartThings has a channel on the IFTTT website that boasts of 
180+ IFTTT recipes that will tie your SmartThings devices together with other 
web applications seamlessly. Check out the channel, shown in Figure 16-4,

Amazon
At first blush, Amazon might seem out of place in this chapter: “What do 
those book guys know about home automation, anyway?” Well, actually, 
Amazon knows quite a bit about the topic, thank you very much, and it has 
quite a nice site dedicated to home automation and relevant products. I’ll 
even go so far as to say that Amazon probably does the topic as much justice 
as anyone else on the web.

 Chapter 16: Ten Great Websites for Home Automation
First of all, it’s Amazon, so the product selection is out of this world when it 
comes to shopping for home automation devices. Amazon doesn’t just carry 
devices for one company; it carries devices for all of them! And the prices at 
Amazon are just plain tough to beat, as you probably already know.
Secondly, Amazon does a great job of educating its customers when it 
comes to learning not only the technologies behind home automation, but 
also understanding what options are available when it comes to specific 
home automation tasks. The Home Automation Resources & Buying Guides 
section is a great place to go for comparing solutions and devices. The 
Communication Protocols guide, shown in Figure 16-5, is by itself worth the 
price of admission (if there were one, that is).
Amazon lists more than 3,000 home automation products, so be sure to leave 
some breadcrumbs on the trail if you decide to go venturing into the vast 
forest of home automation goodness. You’ll find items covering the gamut of 
home automation, and Amazon has done a great job of organizing them into 
the following categories:
✓
✓Energy & Lighting

✓Network Accessories
There’s also a Shop & Learn category that offers a wonderful Solution Center, 
Home Automation Guide, New and Innovative devices, and much more to 
­further immerse you into your smart home experience.
Amazon is a massive website, and giving you the URL to the Home 
Automation section would be a grueling ordeal for both you and me, dear 
reader. To get to the Home Automation section of Amazon’s site:
1.	Go to www.amazon.com in your favorite web browser.
2.	Click the Shop By Department button in the upper-left corner of the 
page and select Full Store Directory.
3.	Browse the directory page for the Home, Garden & Tools section and 
click the Home Automation link.
It may seem like a lot of work to get there, but it’ll be worth your while, 
I promise.
Home Controls
Home Controls is a company that’s been in the home automation business for 
a long time: 25 years, to be exact! These folks know more than a thing or two 
about the subject, and they’re more than willing to share their ­knowledge with 
you (and sell you some home automation goodies at the same time).
When I say Home Controls likes home automation, I’m not kidding. Allow 
me to quote a couple of lines from its website in case you need convincing: 
“Would you even consider throwing out your TV remote in favor of getting 
up to change the channel or volume? Not us! You’d have to pry our remotes 
away from us, kicking and screaming.” Now, that’s dedication to the automation 
and convenience lifestyle, folks.
The Home Controls site offers some great features:
✓
✓An up-to-date blog that informs customers and seekers alike about the 
latest and greatest products offered by this fine company

Home Controls also offers Inside A Smart Home, which gives the layout of a 
typical smart home and all the wonder it can behold. It’s a really neat docu-
ment that lists major areas of home automation, labels, and locations in the 
home that are affected by them, and gives an explanation of how technolo-
gies can benefit you. This nifty diagram (you can see part of it in Figure 16-6)

Z-Wave.com
I discuss home automation protocols in Chapter 1, but there are also sites 
that are dedicated to informing the public and developers alike on the merits 
of specific protocols. Z-Wave.com is one such site, and as its name implies,  
it is solely dedicated to all things Z-Wave.
Z-Wave is a popular protocol, as evidenced by the number of companies 
that are implementing its technology into their home automation products. 
Companies such as ADT, Ingersoll Rand, Bosch, Honeywell, LG Electronics, 
Verizon, and literally scads (and yes, I do literally mean scads) of others are 
all on the Z-Wave bandwagon. Z-Wave.com provides a link to the Z-Wave 
Alliance website, which is www.z-wavealliance.org; the Z-Wave Alliance 
is the place where all the companies that use Z-Wave hang out, discuss 
their wares, and the like. According to the Z-Wave Alliance itself, it is “com-
prised of industry leaders throughout the globe that are dedicated to the 
development and extension of Z-Wave.” You can see a list of those scads of 
­companies that participate in the Alliance by checking the Members section 
of the site.
Z-Wave.com is a great jumping-off point for people interested in learning 
more about the protocol, products it supports, and how you can incorporate 
it into your home automation environment. The site explains what Z-Wave is 
and how it works, and offers product videos to help you determine the best 
fits for your home.
If you’re bent toward the more technical side of Z-Wave, and may even 
want to discover how to develop products using the protocol, I recommend 
clicking the Z-Wave Developers link in the upper right of the Z-Wave.com 
home page to visit the Z-Wave site for developers (shown in Figure 16-7). 
The Developers site offers tons for the Z-Wave nerd and other interested 
­parties:
✓
✓A technology comparison to other home automation protocols
✓
✓Access to the Z-Wave Developers Kit
✓
✓Explanations of the Z-Wave technology: How and where it works
✓
✓Details on the Z-Wave market and how to position products within it
✓
✓The latest news and information about Z-Wave events
And now for potentially the most obvious part of this entire chapter:  
You access Z-Wave.com by visiting — wait for it — www.z-wave.com.

ZigBee Alliance
Oh, it’s on now! I discuss Z-Wave.com in the preceding section, so it’s only 
fair that I throw the ZigBee protocol a bone, too, right?
ZigBee Alliance is certainly aimed at those interested in the more technical 
aspects of home automation, and is focused with laserlike precision on the 
implementation of the ZigBee protocols’ standards.
Go to www.zigbee.org (shown in Figure 16-8) and check out the links on 
the left side of the page. These links provide a mountain of information about 
ZigBee, including the following:
✓
✓Alliance membership
✓
✓White papers that discuss ZigBee tech in great detail
✓
✓The vast market for ZigBee-compatible devices
✓
✓A massive list of products that incorporate the technology
✓
✓How to become a certified ZigBee developer
✓
✓The scoop on the latest ZigBee news and events
ZigBee standards cover much more than just simple home automation. ZigBee 
standards have been developed for many other markets, too, such as commer-
cial building systems, remote controls, health care monitoring, and more.

Lowes
The big-box home stores for do-it-yourselfers have finally gotten into the 
home automation games for themselves, and this has resulted in them 
­offering some great products and home automation information on their 
respective websites.
I kick it off with Lowes, which is as good a place as any to start. Lowes 
has just recently launched Iris, which is the company’s proprietary Home 
Management System. Iris is Lowes’ offering to help DIY home automators 
control their homes with a smart hub and app from anywhere they may 
happen to be. Lowes does offer some non-Iris-related products, but the 
majority of them are centered around it.
Aside from learning about Iris and how it works to join your home automa-
tion tasks under one controlling app and hub, there’s not much in the way  
of basic home automation technology explanations or tips. However, I do 
still recommend the site, especially if you’re someone who has an affinity  
for Lowes and will be going with Iris for your home automation needs. To 
learn more about Iris, visit the site (shown in Figure 16-9) at www.lowes.

Home Depot
In the interest of full disclosure, I admit that I prefer Lowes to Home Depot 
(just barely, though) when it comes to a bricks-and-mortar store where I can 
purchase my home project needs and speak with knowledgeable associates  
if I have questions. But when it comes to the approach to home automation, 
I’m leaning toward Home Depot, both in its own implementation of home  
management technology (Wink, discussed in Chapter 14) and in its home 
automation product offerings.
The Home Depot site offers a great selection of items that fit within the Wink 
family of home automation products, and they cover the gamut of features 
you use in your home:
✓
✓Energy management

✓Lighting

✓Security and locks

✓Motion sensors

y this point, you have discovered all about how home automation 
works and how you can control it via your smartphone, tablet, and 
computer. Life is great, your home is whirring away without a care, and 
you know all the tasks you need to keep scratching your home automation 
itches.
Or do you know them all (home automation tasks, that is)? Might there be 
some other home automation gems that didn’t fit so neatly into the earlier 
categories and chapters up? Could you be missing out on the one, super-
cool home ­automation trick that could keep you from ever going back to 
the days without automatic ovens? Will I ever stop asking questions and get 
on with this chapter?
The answer to the first question is no, but to the rest I resound with  
a hearty “yes!”
The devices you’re about to discover do indeed exist, and they are actually 
quite helpful, no matter how odd one or two of them may seem.

Cleaning Your Home’s Gutters
Ah, yes, it’s “that time of the year” again: The gutters on your house are 
choked with leaves, pine straw, and goodness knows what else, so it’s time to 
grab the ladder and get to work. Here’s how it typically goes:
1.	Place a ladder close enough to reach a section of your home’s gutters.
2.	Climb said ladder.
3.	Clean gunk out of the gutter.
4.	Climb down said ladder.
5.	Reposition the ladder.
6.	Repeat Steps 1 to 5, ad nauseam, until the grim task is complete.
Surely — surely — there must be another way, right? You bet there is, friend: 
Clean those gutters automagically!
iRobot is known for making mundane household chores something that 
robots can do for us, saving us time as well as our backs. They’ve done it 
again with yet another great (and dare I say, cool) tool: the Looj. The Looj, 
shown in Figure 17-1, is a robotic gutter cleaner that does the vast majority 
of the work for you. Sure, you still have to climb the ladder to place the Looj 
in your gutter, but after that you can sit back and sip a glass of iced tea while 
Looj does all the grungy toiling.
The Looj senses the debris in your gutter and knows how best to go about 
using its auger to churn the junk right out. It even comes with a remote con-
trol, built into its detachable handle, that you can use to tell it when to get to 
work and when to stop, or to even allow you to manually control its actions. 
Other great features include:
✓
✓A 50-foot operating range between the Looj and its remote control, 
meaning much fewer ladder moves
✓
✓Interchangeable auger flaps that are customized to the type of cleaning 
you need to do
✓
✓Capability to clean a 30-feet section of gutter in an average of 5 minutes
Check out the Looj by visiting www.irobot.com/us/learn/home/looj.

shows you just how the Looj works its gutter-cleaning magic.

 Chapter 17: Ten Other Options for Automating Your Life
The Looj fits into most K-style gutters (the most common type) with ease. 
However, if you want to be sure it will work in your gutters, iRobot has 
­provided a PDF template that you can print and use to determine if the Looj 
will fit. That’s mighty fine pre-sales customer service, in my humble opinion.
Making a Robot Part of Your Family
Remember Rosie the Robot from The Jetsons? Most of us used to wonder 
how awesome it would be to have R2D2 and C3PO be our pals, right? Lost in 
Space’s Will Robinson was always under the watchful eye of his friend, Robot 
(who could even sing and play a guitar). For decades, the prospect of having 
a robot not just be a tool but be part of your family has been a dream of geeks 
the world over. Heck, let’s don’t kid ourselves: Most of us, geek or not, think 
that a truly interactive robot that works within our family dynamic would be 
pretty awesome to own. That day is coming sooner than some of us thought.
Allow me to introduce JIBO (see Figure 17-2).
JIBO (pronounced JEE-bow) is the brainchild of famed MIT robotics pioneer, 
Dr. Cynthia Breazeal. JIBO’s going to work his way into your family’s heart. 
JIBO is being hailed as the world’s first family robot, and once you meet him 
you’ll know why. JIBO can do all sorts of things with and for you:
✓
✓Built-in cameras allow JIBO to recognize members of the family and 
interact with them individually. For example, JIBO can recognize you 
and remind you of tasks that you have scheduled, then moments later 
can recognize your child and tell him or her a story.

✓
✓The cameras also allow JIBO to act as an avatar for video calls; it feels as 
though you’re in the room with those you’re communicating with.
✓
✓You can carry on a conversation with JIBO from anywhere in the room.
✓
✓JIBO learns how to interact with you as he gets to know you.
✓
✓JIBO expresses himself naturally and with emotive cues.
✓
✓The JIBOAlive Toolkit allows you to customize JIBO even more, making 
your JIBO truly your own.
✓
✓The JIBOAlive SDK allows developers to create new and innovative 
­content for JIBO.

ily’s new

And this is only the tip of the JIBO iceberg. JIBO’s potential to be the first 
truly interactive family robot is through the roof, as evidenced by the intro-
duction video that you can view at www.myjibo.com. The video is truly the 
best way of demonstrating just how innovative JIBO is and how it can affect 
your daily life.
As of this writing, the only downside to JIBO that I can find is that you can 
only pre-order him for now. JIBO is such a potentially game-changing experi-
ence in the realm of robotic interaction that I just had to share the news now, 
even before you can purchase one. (Please check www.myjibo.com for news 
on shipping dates.) JIBO could truly revolutionize the home and will be a 
wonderful addition to any home that employs automation.

Feeding Pets While You’re Away
You’re going to be away from home for the day or two (or more), but you 
can’t take Fido or Fluffy with you. What to do when it comes to feeding 
your furry companion? Well, you could just tear open the pet food bag and 
leave it on the kitchen floor for him, or ask your neighbor’s completely 
unreliable teenager to “watch after” your pawed pal. If neither of those 
sounds like a viable option, consider the SmartFeeder from Petnet, shown in 
Figure 17-3.
The SmartFeeder is true to its name: This device feeds your pets accord-
ing to the schedules you set and with the amounts of food you determine. 
There’s no worrying that beloved companions will either starve or engorge 
themselves.
The SmartFeeder app, seen in Figure 17-4, plugs you into the device from  
anywhere and allows you the ultimate in pet-feeding convenience:
✓
✓The Dashboard can be accessed from your smartphone, tablet, or com-
puter’s web browser.

✓
✓Set completely customizable feeding times and portion amounts from 
anywhere at any time.
✓
✓Be notified of your pet’s feeding activities, including when feedings are 
scheduled, when they’ve completed, and how much food remains in the 
feeder.
✓
✓You can actually monitor your pet’s caloric intake and compare it to 
other animals of similar breeds and ages!
You likely have tons of questions about a device like this (no, it won’t supply 
water; they’re developing a separate device for that), and Petnet has the 
answers to your questions in the Support section of its website. Visit Petnet 
at www.petnet.io to learn more about this really great ­product.
Do you have more than one pet? Each SmartFeeder device will work with 
only one pet at a time, so you’ll need multiple feeders. The good news is that 
they can all be controlled via one app.

Cleaning Up Kitty Litter
Of course, I just had to follow up the automatic pet feeder with the obvious 
device: an automatic kitty litter cleaner. Makes sense, no? These devices 
don’t use app or web technology, but they do automate (quite well) what 
used to be one of the most unpleasant tasks of a cat lover’s life.
Using standard litter
There are automatic kitty litter machines, and then there is the Litter-Robot 
II from Automated Pet Care Products, Inc. This is the crème-de-la-crème of 
automatic kitty litter cleaners that use standard clumping kitty litter. And 
while it won’t connect with your iPhone or Android device so you can moni-
tor your kitty’s business (does anyone actually want to do that?), it will keep 
the rest of your home from smelling like a sewer — bonus! — without ever 
having to gets your hands messy. The Litter-Robot II, shown in Figure 17-5, 
doesn’t rake your kitty’s “stuff” away; instead, it sifts it, which means it gets 
all the litter and leaves nothing to chance. The only thing you have to do is 
empty the discard drawer of the machine into your wastebasket. Done.
Cat lovers, head on over to www.litter-robot.com to check out this  
great product.

A kitty toilet? Why, yes, indeed!
Tired of dealing with litter altogether? Wish you never had to buy another 
bag of the stuff again? Wouldn’t it be great if your cat could not only use the 
toilet, but that she could even flush it?
The CatGenie is your answer! CatGenie is a self-flushing, self-­washing kitty 
litter box that utilizes reusable litter. You can set the thing to automatic and 
it acts as your kitty’s own customized toilet. No kidding!
What makes CatGenie different is that you connect to a water supply in  
your home. It will actually use water and a sanitizing solution to flush your 
cat’s business away. There’s a great video on the CatGenie website, www.
catgenie.com, in the Newsroom section, that shows you how the CatGenie 
can be set up with its own water lines or you can have it flush directly into a 
human litter box (also known as your toilet).
This warning isn’t anything more than a heads-up, so don’t be alarmed. 
Although you may no longer need to buy kitty litter, you will need a steady 
supply of the sanitizing solution the CatGenie uses to clean itself. According 
to the CatGenie’s creator, PetNovations, the cost of the solution is actually 
less than what you’d spend on litter in a year.
Cleaning Your Pool the Robotic Way
The fine folks at iRobot are about to make another appearance in this chapter; 
they’re just too good at what they do to keep them out. This time, instead of 
helping with your gutters, they effortlessly clean your pool for you.
Anyone who’s ever owned a swimming pool knows the horrible feeling that 
comes when you realize it’s time to clean it. The time, the chemicals, the 
effort, and the money spent almost make you wish you just had a robot to do 
it all for you.
iRobot to the rescue! iRobot’s Mirra is the perfect robotic solution to clean-
ing your pool, and all you have to do is drop it in and it will get to work. No 
more scrubbing the sides of your pool with a brush, or scraping the surface 
with a net to clean out debris, hair and other yuckiness. With Mirra, all you 
need to do is empty the canisters that collect the stuff it gets out of your 
favorite swimming hole.

✓iRobot’s iAdapt Nautiq technology allows Mirra to determine all on its 
own how to best clean your pool, regardless of its size or shape.
✓
✓Mirra is equipped with all it needs to work in any in-ground pool, regard-
less of its surface type.
✓
✓Mirra’s floating power cord won’t get tangled; built-in sensors determine 
Mirra’s orientation in the pool.

✓Large cleaning canisters are available for purchase if you need some-
thing for heavier cleanup jobs.

Waking Up to a Fresh Cup of Joe
Any truly dedicated coffee drinker worth his or her weight in coffee beans 
knows you can automatically create your own brews with a programmable 
coffeemaker. You had to know that at some point you’d be able to use your 
smartphone or tablet to handle the task, too, right?
Mr. Coffee (of course; who else?) is bringing the app-controlled coffeemaker 
to your kitchen with its Smart Optimal Brew Coffeemaker Enabled with 
Wemo. And yes, that’s the real name of this coffeemaker (I just stick to call-
ing it the Smart Brew for the sake of saving you reading time and sparing a 
couple of trees in the printing of this book).
The Smart Brew can do exactly what you’d expect: automatically brew your 
coffee on your schedule, which you set from anywhere in the world using the 
Wemo app on your smartphone or tablet. Figure 17-7 shows a person doing 
just that, as a matter of fact.
The Wemo app, coupled with your Smart Brew coffeemaker, allows you to 
do some neat tricks with your coffeemaker you’ve never been able to do 
remotely before:
✓
✓Check the Smart Brew’s status and even turn it off.
✓
✓Receive notifications when the Smart Brew needs to remind you of a 
scheduled or finished brew.
✓
✓Create brewing schedules for up to one week, and adjust the schedule as 
needed.

Starting Your Vehicle Remotely
I think by now it’s pretty obvious that most things in or around your home 
can be remotely controlled in some fashion. How about automobiles? They’re 
kind of like second homes, aren’t they? Many of you probably spend as much 
or more of your waking hours in your automobiles as you do in your homes 
anyway. And besides, since you park your automobiles on the property, 
they’re more or less an extension of your home. If you can start your coffee 
automatically with an app, heat the house with an app, check foods on the 
grill with an app, and pretty much everything else with an app, why not start 
your car with an app?
If this sounds like something that might be up your alley, Viper has the right 
tool for you: SmartStart.
SmartStart is a system that will connect your car to the cloud, allowing you 
to start your car and even track its movements from anywhere using the 
SmartStart app (see Figure 17-8). With the SmartStart system, you can:
✓
✓Lock and unlock your automobile.
✓
✓Remotely start your automobile.
✓
✓Arm or disarm your alarm system.
✓
✓Instigate your automobile’s panic alarm.
✓
✓Open the trunk remotely.
✓
✓Control multiple vehicles from a single app.
✓
✓Allow multiple users to control a single vehicle.
✓
✓Use keyless entry into your automobile.
Sure, your vehicle probably comes with some of these features built in to its 
remote, but those functions will only work if you’re in a certain proximity to 
the vehicle. With SmartStart, you can be anywhere in the world and use these 
features, as long as you and your automobile are within range of a cell tower. 
This system has a bounty of advantages:
✓
✓If you’re locked out of your vehicle somehow, another authorized user 
can unlock it for you using his or her SmartStart app.
✓
✓Your automobile can be toasty in the winter or frosty in the summer 
before you even walk out of the grocery store.
✓
✓You can keep tabs on where your kids of driving age are on a Friday or 
Saturday night.
✓
✓Find your car easily in a crowded parking lot (the value of this will be 
more than obvious come Christmastime, I promise).

The list can go on and on, but you get the drift. For much more information, 
visit www.viper.com/SmartStart. Check out all the systems the company 
offers, and even customize a system to your needs.
I must make you aware that Viper charges a monthly fee for service (you’ll 
need to find the plan that suits your personal needs), which is understand-
able, since Viper is using its servers and must access cellular networks to 
offer you the SmartStart services.
Extend your SmartStart’s features with Viper’s SmartStart GPS, which allows 
you to locate your car anywhere, set speed limit alerts, be notified when the 
vehicle is located in certain areas, and more.

Automatically flushing toilets! Yes, I went there (if you’ll pardon the pun).
Being the mature folks that we are, I’m sure we can navigate this topic with 
some modicum of decorum. Let’s just dive right in!
Surely, it’s everyone’s dream to be able to go to the restroom without having 
to worry about actually flushing the toilet, correct? I can’t imagine how such 
an invention wouldn’t rank right up there with fire, the wheel, and life in 
­general. I don’t know about you, but my life’s so hectic I just don’t want to 
waste the time necessary to push that little handle down on the side of the 
toilet every time I use it. What a hassle!
Okay, all kidding aside, while at first the idea of an automatic flushing toilet 
may sound a little silly, in truth it is a very good idea. Here are a few reasons 
why an automatically flushing toilet is something worth considering:
✓
✓Sanitary reasons are reason enough alone, if you ask moi.
✓
✓Anyone with children in the home (regardless of their ages) knows that 
more often than not the simple job of flushing is often ignored or forgot-
ten altogether.
✓
✓Anyone with a man in the home (regardless of his age) knows that more 
often than not the simple job of flushing is often ignored or forgotten 
altogether.
Now that I’ve gotten the utmost attention of the moms and wives in the audi-
ence, I’d like to introduce you to Rubbermaid’s Auto Flush Tank. The Auto 
Flush Tank (the sensor for which is shown in Figure 17-9) is easy to install on 
almost any toilet that uses a standard water tank. Some features of the Auto 
Flush Tank include:
✓
✓Battery life of up to 3 years or 100,000 flushes (that’s a lot of flushes, 
ladies and gentlemen).
✓
✓Operates in one of three user-settable modes:
•	Object detection, meaning it will automatically detect when a person 
is moving away and it will flush.
•	Object detection with extended delay, meaning it will wait a few sec-
onds before flushing once it detects someone has moved away (so as 
to avoid any surprises, if you know what I’m saying).
•	Wave only, meaning that the toilet will only flush when someone 
waves a hand in front of the sensor, which is placed on the wall 
behind the toilet.

Pulling the Shades from  
Across the Room
We’ve all seen sci-fi movies where the windows dim or shades close at the 
clap of a hand or when a simple voice command is given, only to go home 
and look at the shades and blinds in our homes and wonder, “Why can’t you 
do that?” You’ll be thrilled to know that they actually can!
Hunter Douglas is a well-known company to anyone who’s shopped for 
window blinds and shades, and they’re the good people I want to bring to 
your attention in this part of the chapter. Hunter Douglas has developed a 
system that will adjust your shades or blinds to your liking with the use of an 
app on your iOS or Android devices. This app is called Platinum, and it works

to control shades or blinds in). The app, shown in Figure 17-10, allows you full 
control of all the motorized Hunter Douglas blinds and shades in your home.
Here are some of the advantages to using the Platinum app to automatically 
control your blinds and shades:
✓
✓Lowering your blinds when it’s hot outside helps keep your home cooler 
when you’re away. In the same line of thought, raising your blinds in the 
daytime when it’s cold out helps keep your home warmer. Can you say 
“energy bill savings”? I knew you could!
✓
✓Set up different scenes so that shades raise and lower automatically to 
your specification at given times.
✓
✓You can raise or lower your blinds from anywhere in the world; no need 
to be in the home or even near it for the app to work.

blinds and

without you 
ever leaving

Please check out www.hunterdouglas.com/platinum-app-info to find 
out more about the app:
✓
✓Find answers to commonly asked questions in the handy FAQ section.
✓
✓Discover the lines of blinds and shades that are supported.
✓
✓Locate a Hunter Douglas dealer near you.
The app is rather large at almost 100MB, so don’t be alarmed if it takes a few 
minutes to download to your iOS or Android device. Actual time depends on 
your Internet connection speed, of course.
Controlling Your Home’s Humidity
Your home’s humidity is no trifling matter, as anyone with gas heating or 
who lives in a really dry climate can attest to. If you’re like me, allergies can 
be severely affected, depending on how humid the air is. Humidifiers are a 
necessary commodity in some households; wouldn’t it be nice if you could 
automate those darned things?
Holmes has developed a humidifier that you can control, and you can do it 
from your iOS or Android device, no less! The Holmes Whole House Smart 
Humidifier Enabled by Wemo (there’s good old Wemo again) allows you to 
control your home’s humidity like never before. The Wemo app is all you 
need to run the show (once you’ve acquired the humidifier, of course), and  
it does a dandy of a job:
✓
✓Get notifications when water levels in the humidifier reach low levels.
✓
✓Check on the filter life level so you know when it needs to be changed. 
You can even order new filters from the app.
✓
✓Adjust the humidity levels in your home from anywhere, and I do mean 
anywhere.
✓
✓Set the humidifier’s schedule to operate only when you want it to.
✓
✓Create preset humidity levels that the humidifier will work to maintain.

About the Author
Dwight Spivey (Mobile, Alabama) has been a technical author and editor for 
nearly a decade, but has been a bona fide technophile for close to three of 
them. He’s the author of How to Do Everything Pages, Keynote & Numbers 
(McGraw-Hill, 2014), OS X Mavericks Portable Genius (Wiley, 2013), and many 
more books covering the tech gamut. His technology experience is extensive, 
consisting of OS X, iOS, Android, Linux, and Windows operating systems in 
general; desktop publishing software; laser printers and drivers; color and 
color management; and networking. His love of tech led him to discover the 
smart home and the wizardry behind what makes them tick, and Home 
Automation For Dummies was the fruit borne thereof.
Dedication
For Granddaddy, Grandmama, Dad, Aunt Faye, Uncle Preston, Uncle Winston, 
Uncle Frank, Uncle Larry, and Uncle Kenneth.

Author’s Acknowledgments
Many sincere thanks to my agent, Carole Jelen of Waterside, and Wiley’s own

The crew behind this book was so truly critical to its completion, and I want 
you all to know how grateful I am for your professionalism, dedication, hard 
work, and patience in working with me. Thank you to the following wonderful 
people, from the bottom of my heart: Katie Mohr, Senior Acquisitions Editor; 
Lynn Northrup, Project Editor; Earl Boysen, Technical Editor; Sheree 
Montgomery, Project Coordinator; and Debbye Butler, Copy Editor.
Finally, I must thank my wife, Cindy, and our four blessings from God, Victoria, 
Devyn, Emi, and Reid, for being so patient with me. Through late nights, early 
mornings, and many absences during this project, they’ve been my rock and 
my reason. I love you guys.
