Truth table for material conditional
A material conditional formula (A ⊃B) is true exactly when
in every case that A is true, then B is also true.

Truth table for material conditional
A material conditional formula (A ⊃B) is true exactly when
in every case that A is true, then B is also true.
It asserts a truth-transferring directed connection from A to B.

The conditional (A ⊃B) has the same truth table as ∼(A & ∼B).
It is true in all cases except for when A is true and B false.

Reasons for the Material Conditional
The material conditional is the truth-functional core of the
“implies” or “if...then...” connective in English,
with the truth of the conditional expressed purely in
terms of the truth or falsity of antecedent and consequent.

In natural language usage, we assert “A implies B” or
“if A then B” when we mean there is a content
connection leading from A to B, in addition to a
truth-transfer connection from A to B.

An Unintuitive Consequence
The formula p ⊃(q ⊃p) is always true!!

Let p be “I am a penguin”, and let q be “Elvis is dead”.

Exercise: Truth Table with Conditionals
Compare the formulas
(p ⊃∼q)
and
∼(p ⊃q)
by completing their truth tables. For 1, mark the check-box, and
for 0, leave the check-box unmarked.

When p is false, (p ⊃∼q) is true while ∼(p ⊃q) is false, but
when p is true, (p ⊃∼q) and ∼(p ⊃q) have same truth value.

Truth table for biconditional
A biconditional formula (A ≡B) is true precisely when
A and B have exactly the same truth value; (A ≡B) is false
precisely when A and B have different truth values.

Exercise: The Biconditional
Let A and B be any formulas.
Compare
(A ≡B) with
((A ⊃B) & (B ⊃A)) by
completing the truth table. For 1, mark the check-box,
and for 0, leave the check-box unmarked.

Result:
(A ≡B) same TT as
((A ⊃B) & (B ⊃A)).
The formula
(A ≡B) ≡((A ⊃B) & (B ⊃A))
is always true!!
