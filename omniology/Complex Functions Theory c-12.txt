Introduction
Introduction
In this volume we give some examples of the elementary part of the theory of the Laplace transfor-
mation as described in Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5, The Laplace Transformation II. The
chapters and the sections will follow the same structure as in the above mentioned book on the theory.
The examples have been collected about 30 years ago from some long forgotten book on applications.
It was then pointed out by the author, and repeated here that one should not uncritically apply the
Laplace transformation in all cases. Sometimes the simpler methods known from plain Calculus may
be easier to apply.

Example 1.1.5 Find all real constants a, b, α, β and λ, for which
L

a t−α + b t−β
(z) = λ ·

a z−α + b z−β
.
If a = −b and α = β, then the relation is trivial for all λ, because both the left hand side and the
right hand side are 0.
We assume that this is not the case. Then we must have 0 < α, β < 1, and it follows that
L

a t−α + b t−β
(z) = a Γ(1 −α)

a Γ(1 −α)
z1−α

zα
and
b · Γ(1 −β)
z1−β
= λ · b · 1
zβ .
We have three possibilities.
a) If a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0, then 1 −α = α and 1 −β = β, so α = β =
1
2, which implies that
λ = Γ(1 −α) = Γ

b) If a = 0 and b ̸= 0, then α is arbitrary, while we still have β = 1
2 and λ = √π, and b ̸= 0
arbitrary.
c) If a ̸= 0 and b = 0, then β is arbitrary, while we still have α = 1
2 and λ = √π, and a ̸= 0 is
arbitrary.
2)
a · Γ(1 −α)
z1−α
= λ · b · 1
zβ
and
b · Γ(1 −β)
z1−β
= λ · a · zα
,
hence α + β = 1 (or, equivalently, β = 1 −α), and
λ = a
b Γ(1 −α) = b

so

the proof is that g ∈C1 and that g(0) = 0.

Example 1.5.7 We deﬁne the modiﬁed Bessel function of order 0 by I0(t) := J0(it), which makes
sense, because J0(t) has a convergent series expansion which can be extended to all of C.
Compute
L {I0(a t)} (z)
for a ∈R+.
It follows from the rule of change of scale that
L {I0(a t)} (z) = 1
a L {I0}
z
a

.
It therefore suﬃces to compute L {I0} (z).
Clearly,
I′
0(t) = i J′
0(i t),
thus
J′
0(i t) = −i I0(t),
and
I′′
0 (t) = −J′′
0 (i t),
thus
J′′
0 (i t) = −I′′
0 (t).
By insertion into the Bessel equation of order 0 we obtain the following diﬀerential equation for I0,
0 = it J′′
0 (it) + J′
0(i t) + it J0(i t) = −it J′′
0 (t) −i I′
0(t) + it I0(t),
so the diﬀerential equation of I0 becomes
−t I′′
0 (t) −I′
0(t) + t I0(t) = 0,
and I0(0) = 1.

Linear ordinary diﬀerential equations
Example 2.1.1 Find the general solution of the diﬀerential equation
t f ′′(t) + 2 f ′(t) + t f(t) = 0.
We assume that f(t) and f ′(t) are deﬁned by continuity for t = 0. Then put F(z) := L{f}(z), and
we get by the Laplace transformation of the given diﬀerential equation,
−d
dz

z2 F(z) −z f(0) −f ′(0)

+ 2 {z F(z) −f(0)} −d
dz F(z) = 0,
hence
−2z F(z) −z2 dF
dz + f(0) + 2z F(z) −2 f(0) −dF
dz = 0,
from which
dF
dz = −f(0)
z2 + 1.
On the other hand, it follows from the rule of multiplication by t, that
L{t f(t)}(z) = −dF
dz = f(0)
z2 + 1 = f(0) · L{sin t}(z),
from which we get by the inverse Laplace transformation,
f(t) = f(0) · sin t
t
.
The diﬀerential equation is singular at the point t = 0, because the coeﬃcient t of the term of
highest order of diﬀerentiation, f ′′(t), is (trivially) 0 at t = 0. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the
diﬀerential equation has two linearly independent solutions at t = 0.
One may of course, using plain ordinary Calculus, compute another linearly independent solution for
t ̸= 0 by the well-known formula,
ϕ(t)

rangement,

f(t) = 0,

We immediately recognize the equation as a Bessel equation of ﬁrst order, so its bounded solutions
are given by
f(t) = c J1(t),

It follows from f(1) = 2 that s = 2/J1(1), so the bounded solution is given by

The Laplace Transformation II c-12

2  Applications
Example 2.1.6 A particle P of mass 2 g is moving along the X-axis. The particle is attracted by a
force directed towards 0, and it is numerically of the size 8|x|. The particle is at time t = 0 lying at
the point x = 0. Find the position of P at every time t ∈R+ in each of the following two cases:
1) The particle P is not subjected to any other force.
2) The particle P is subjected to a damping, which numerically is 8 times the speed.
1) Based on the conditions above the problem is described by
2 d2x
dt2 = −8x,
x(0) = 0,
thus by a rearrangement,
d2x
dt2 + 4x = 0,
x(0) = 0,
x′(0) unspeciﬁed.
There is no need to apply the Laplace transformation, because one immediately realizes from
elementary Calculus that the diﬀerential equation has the complete solution
x(t) = c1 sin 2t + c2 cos 2t,
c1, c2 arbitrary constants.
Since x(0) = 0 and x′(0) is unspeciﬁed, the searched solution becomes
x(t) = c1 sin 2t = x′(0)
2
sin 2t.
2) In the second case with damping the diﬀerential equation with its initial conditions becomes
2 d2x
dt2 = −8x −8 dx
dt ,
x(0) = 0,
x′(0) unspeciﬁed,
thus by a rearrangement,
d2x
dt2 + 4 dx
dt + 4x = 0,
x(0) = 0,
x′(0) unspeciﬁed.
The Laplace transformation is not needed in this case either, because the characteristic polynomial
becomes λ2+4λ+4 has the root of second order λ = −2, so the complete solution of the diﬀerential
equation is according to ordinary Calculus given by
x(t) = c1 t e−2t + c2 e−2t.
It follows from x(0) = 0 that
x(t) = c1 t e−2t,
so from 4x′(t) = c1(−2t + 1)e−2t follows that c1 = x′(0), and the solution is
x(t) = x′(0) t e−2t.

It should here be added that if we had applied the Laplace transformation in the two cases, then we
would have obtained
1)

z2 + 4

L{f}(z) = x′(0) z,
and
2)

z2 + 4z + 4

L{f}(z) = · · · .
In both cases we get the characteristic polynomial as a factor of the Laplace transform L{f}(z), while
the initial conditions are put on the right hand side of the transformed equation as coeﬃcients of
a polynomial of smaller degree. The results of course become the same in both methods, but an
application of the Laplace transformation in such simple cases may seen a little elaborated, when the
problem can be solved straightaway by plain Calculus. This example should therefore be seen as a
warning that one should not forget what one has learned earlier. Such “primitive methods” could
indeed in some cases be more easy to apply. ♦

Assuming that the particle starts from rest at t = 0 at the point x = 0 one shall ﬁnd the position and
the velocity of the particle at any t ∈R+.
The problem is described by the following initial problem,
m d2x
dt2 = F(t),
x(0) = 0,
x′(0).
It is immediately judged that it like in Example 2.1.6 will be too much to apply the Laplace transfor-
mation on this problem, because we for e.g. t ∈

Example 2.1.8 A coil of 2 henry, a resistance of 16 ohm and a capacitor of 0.02 farad are connected
in a circuit with an electric force of E volt. At time t = 0 the capacity of the capacitor is zero, and
the current in the circuit is zero. Find the charging and the current at any later time in the following
cases,
1) E = 300 volt;
2) E = 100 · sin 3t volt.

Example 2.1.10 A beam is suspended as indicated on Figure 5 on page 62 with its endpoints at x = 0

f(0) = f ′′(0) = 0,
f(ℓ) = f ′′(ℓ) = 0.
In this case there is absolutely no need to apply the Laplace transformation, and one would even get
into troubles with it, because we have not speciﬁed f ′(0) and f (3)(0), which are needed.
We get by four successive integrations that the general solution is given by
f(x) = 1

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

The Laplace Transformation II c-12

Example 2.1.12 Solve the boundary value problem
t f ′′(t) + 2 f ′(t) + t f(t) = 0,
lim
t→0+ f(t) = 1,
f(π) = 0.
We must be careful here, because we have a singular point at t = 0, where the coeﬃcient of the highest
order term f ′′(t) is zero. It will later follow that the problem is even ill-posed, because the solution,
based on the condition limt→0+ f(t) = 1 alone will automatically satisfy f(π) = 0. Similarly, even if
it follows from the diﬀerential equation itself by letting t →0 that f ′(0) = 0 is easily derived, and yet
it is not used in the derivation of the solution. The point is, of course as mentioned above, that we
have a singular point at t = 0, and that even if the linear equation for t ̸= 0 is spanned by two linearly
independent solutions, at most one of these is also a function in the class F of functions, which can
be Laplace transformed.
When the diﬀerential equation is Laplace transformed, we get

L{t f(t)}(z) −1,
from which
L{t f(t)} =

z2 + 1 = L{sin t}(z).
Using the inverse Laplace transformation we therefore conclude that t f(t) = sin t, so
f(t) = sin t
t

t ∈R+,
with f(0) = limt→0+ f(t) = 1 by continuity. ♦

We shall assume that x(t), y(t) ∈F. Then we write for short
X = X(z) := L{x(t)}(z)

Y = Y (z) = L{y(t)}(z).
Using the Laplace transformation we get


hence by a rearrangement,

where

hence c = 0.




y1(0) = 1,
y2(0) = 0.
First method It follows by inspection that
d
dt (y1 + y2) + (y1 + y2) = 0,
thus y1 + y2 = c1 e−t,
and
d
dt (y1 −y2) −(y1 −y2) = 0,
thus y1 −y2 = c2 et.
It follows from the initial conditions that c1 = c2 = 1, so
y1(t) = cosh t
and
y2(t) = −sinh t.
Second method It follows by the Laplace transformation that



zY1(z) −1 + Y2(z) = 0,
zY2(z) −0 + Y1(z) = 0,
hence



z · Y1(z) + 1 · Y2(z) = 1,
1 · Y1(z) + z · Y2(z) = 0.
The determinant is z2 −1, so it follows from Cramer’s formula,

y′

y2 = 3

It is absolutely no reason here to solve the problem via the Laplace transformation, because it is much
easier to start by integrating the ﬁrst equation to get
x(t) + y(t) = t2
2 + c = t2
2 + 3,
from which
−y(t) = x(t) −t2
2 −3.
When this is put into the second equation of the problem, we get
d2x
dt2 + x(t) = e−t + t2
2 + 3,
where we guess a particular integral of the form
x(t) = 1
2 e−t + 1
2 t2 + a.
Then by insertion,
d2x
dt2 + x(t) = e−t + t2
2 + 1 + a = e−t + t2
2 + 3,
so it is indeed a particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation, when we choose a = 2. Then we

It is seen by inspection that it is not necessary to apply the Laplace transformation in this example
either, because the ﬁrst equation can be rewritten in the form
d
dt (x −y) −2(x −y) = sin t.
The complete solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation is c e2t, and we guess a particular
solution of the structure
x −y = a cos t + b sin t.
We get by insertion,
d
dt(x −y) −2(x −y) = −a sin t + b cos t −2a cos t −2b sin t = (−a −2b) sin t + (b −2a) cos t,
which is equal to sin t for b = 2a and a = −1
5, so b = −2
5. Since x(0) −y(0) = 0, the solution is
x(t) −y(t) = −1
5 cos t −2
5 sin t + c e2t = 1
5

−cost −2 sin t + e2t
.
Thus,
2(x −y) = −2
5 cos t −4
5 sin t + 2
5 e2t,
and so by a diﬀerentiation,
2 dx
dt −2 dy
dt = 2
5 sin t −4
5 cos t + 4
5 e2t.
When this expression is added to the second equation of the system we get
d2x
dt2 + 2 dx
dt + x(t) = 2
5 sin t −4
5 cos t + 4
5 e2t.
The corresponding homogeneous equation has the complete solution
c1 e−t + c2 t e−t.
A particular solution of this equation must have the structure
x(t) = a sin t + b cos t + k e2t,
thus
x′(t) = −b sin t + a cos t + 2k e2t,

and
x′′(t) = −a sin t −b cos t + 4k e2t,
and we get by insertion
d2x
dt2 + 2 dx
dt + x(t) = −2b sin t + 2a cos t + 9k e2t.
This expression is equal to 2
5 sin t −4
5 cos t + 4
5 e2t for a = −2
5 and b = −1
5 and k =

45. Hence, the
complete solution of the diﬀerential equation in x(t) alone is given by
x(t) = −2
5 sin t −1
5 cos t + 4
45 e2t + c1 e−t + c2 t e−t.
By a diﬀerentiation,
x′(t) = 1
5 sin t −2
5 cos t + 8
45 e2t + (c2 −c1) e−t −c2 t e−t.
Then we use the initial conditions to get
x(0) = 0 = −1
5 + 4
45 + c1,
thus
c1 = 1
5 −4
45 = 5
45 = 1

and
x′(0) = 0 = −2

45 + c2 −c1,
thus
c2 = 1
9 + 2

45 = 5 + 18 −8

Summing up, we have proved that
x(t) = −2
5 sin t −1
5 cos t + 4
45 e2t + 1
9 e−t + 1
3 t e−t,
from which we derive that

5 e2t = −1

x(t) = 1 −e−t −2 dy

so by eliminating x(t) in the second equation,

dt −y(t) = 1,

Hint. First ﬁnd y(0).
When we put t = 0 into the ﬁrst equation, we get y(0) = −1. Then we see that it is absolutely no
need to use the Laplace transformation, because it follows from the second equation that
(6) y(t) = dx
dt −e−t,
thus
dy
dt = d2x
dt2 + e−t,
and hence by insertion into the ﬁrst equation,
t x(t) + dx
dt −e−t + t d2x
dt2 + t e−t = (t −1)e−t,
which is reduced to the Bessel diﬀerential equation
t d2x
dt2 + dx
dt + t x(t) = 0,
the bounded solutions of which are given by c0 J0(t). Since both J0(0) = 1 and x(0) = 1, we get that
x(t) = J0(t). Hence, by (6),
y(t) = J′
0(t) + e−t = −J1(t) + e−t,
and the solutions become
x(t) = J0(t)
and
y(t) = −J1(t) + e−t

The inductances of 2 henry and 4 henry are chosen for convenience, so the solutions do not become
too complicated. It will in practice be diﬃcult to realize these very large inductances.

Linear partial diﬀerential equations
Example 2.3.1 Solve the equation
ddu
∂t = 2 ∂2u
∂x2 ,
given that
u(0, t) = u(5, t) = 0
and
u(x, 0) = 10 sin 4πx.
Figure 9: The boundary conditions of Example 2.3.1.
The structure of the partial diﬀerential equation is that of the heat equation.
We denote the partial Laplace transform of u(x, t) with respect to t by U(x, z). Then it follows that
z U(x, z) −u(x, 0) = 2 ∂2U
∂x2 ,
thus
∂2U
∂x2 −z
2 U(x, z) = −1
2 u(x, 0) = −5 sin 4πx.
In this equation we consider z as a parameter, so when we guess a solution of the form c(z) · sin 4πx,
then we get
c(x) ·

−16π2 −z

sin4πz = −5 sin4πz,
so a particular integral of the equation is given by
U0(x, z) =

If we choose the usual branch of the complex square root, then the complete solution becomes for

However, the latter is not possible for z ∈C\(R−∪{0}), because we have chosen the usual branch of
the square root with its branch cut along the negative real axis. Hence, we conclude that the partial
Laplace transform is uniquely given by
U(x, z) =

corresponding to the solution

Check of solution! Given u(x, t) above, we clearly have u(0, t) = 0 and u(5, t) = 0 and u(x, 0) =
10 sin 4πx. Furthermore, by partial diﬀerentiations,
∂u

Then by the inverse Laplace transformation,
f(t) = 1
2 sin 2t + 1
2 sin(2{t −2}) · H(t −2).
Check of the solution. Since f(t) is continuous for x ≥0, and diﬀerentiable for x ̸= 2, we get
f ′(t) = cos 2t + cos(2(t −2)) · H(t −2)
for t ̸= 2.
We see in particular that f(0) = 0 and f ′(0) = 1, so the initial conditions are fulﬁlled.
The derivative f ′(t) has a jump at t = 2, so the trick is to add and then subtract H(t −2) to get
f ′(t) = (cos 2t + {cos(2(t −2)) −1} · H(t −2)) + H(t −2).
The ﬁrst term is continuous and diﬀerentiable for t ̸= 2, so
f ′′(t) = −2 sin 2t −2 sin(2(t −2)) · H(t −2) + δ(t −2).
Then ﬁnally,
f ′′(t) + 4 f(t) = δ(t −2).

Example 2.4.8 A beam has its endpoints at x = 0 and x = ℓclamped. The beam is subjected to a

This example was found in a long forgotten book as an exercise in application of the Laplace trans-
formation. However, a boundary value problem is considering a ﬁnite interval, while the Laplace
transformation requires an inﬁnite interval, so we cannot apply the Laplace transformation here. It
is not possible to reconstruct the original exercise. It was probably included due to the occurrence
of Dirac’s delta function. In order not to make the reader disappointed we solve the given classical
problem by simply integrating the equation successively,

Example 2.5.4 Find the z transform of the function
f(t) = tan t,
t ≥0 and t ̸= π
2 + pπ,
p ∈N0,
when T = π
3 .
The point is of course that f(t) is not deﬁned at t = π
2 + pπ, p ∈N0, and that no sample time is
of this form. We therefore obtain a fairly nice z transform below, in spite of the fact that f(t) is
discontinuous at inﬁnitely many points, so we also lose some information in this case.
We get by the deﬁnition of the zz transformation for |z| > 1 that

Example 3.2.6 Given 0 < λ < a. Find the inverse Laplace transform of
cosh (λ√z)

First notice by using series expansions that the function in spite of the occurrence of the square root
is analytic without branch cuts and a simple pole at z = 0 and either simple poles of removable
singularities for a√z = i

Example 3.2.8 Consider the circuit on Figure 29, where the generator is speciﬁed by
E(t) = (−1)n E0
for t ∈[n1, (n + 1)a[,
n ∈N0.
We assume that the current I(0) is zero for t = 0. Find the current I(t) at any later time t > 0.
Hint. The result does not have a nice description.
We ﬁrst set up the governing diﬀerential equation
(11) L dI
dt + RI = E(t),
where I(0) = 0.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

4.1
Trigonometric formulæ
We repeat the formulæ known from e.g. Ventus, Calculus 1-a, Functions in one Variable. The addition
formulæ for trigonometric functions are
(15) cos(x + y) = cos x · cos y −sin x · sin y,
(16) cos(x −y) = cos x · cos y + sin x · sin y,
(17) sin(x + y) = sin x · cos y + cos x · sin y,
(18) sin(x −y) = sin x · cos y −cos x · sin y.
Remark 4.1.1 One remembers these important rules by noting that cos x is even, and sin x is odd.
Therefore, since cos(x ± y) is even, the reduction must contain cos x · cos y (even times even) and
sin x · sin y (odd times odd). Then we shall only remember the change of sign in front of sin x · sin y.
Analogously, sin(x±y) is odd, so the reduction must contain sin x·cos y (odd times even) and cos x·sin y
(even times odd). Here there is no change of sign. ♦
The antilogarithmic formulæ. These are derived from the addition formulæ above.
sin x · sin y = 1
2 {cos(x −y) −cos(x + y)},
even,
cos x · cos y = 1
2 {cos(x −y) + cos(x + y)},
even,
sin x · cos y = 1
2 {sin(x −y) + sin(x + y)},
odd.
4.2
Integration of trigonometric polynomials
The task is to ﬁnd the integral

sinm x · cosn x dx,
for m, n ∈N0.
We shall in the following only consider one single term of the the form sinm x · cosn x, where m and
n ∈N0, of a trigonometric polynomial, because we in general can ﬁnd the result by linearity.
We deﬁne the degree of sinm x · cosn x as the sum m + n.
When we integrate such a single trigonometric product of degree m + n, we ﬁrst must answer the
following question: Is it of even or odd degree? These two possibilities are then again subdivided
into to subcases, so we have four diﬀerent variants of method, when we integrate a trigonometric
polynomial.

1) The degree m + n is odd.
a) m = 2p is even, and n = 2q + 1 is odd.
b) m = 2p + 1 is odd, and n = 2q is odd.
2) The degree m + n is even.
a) m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q + 1 are both odd.
b) m = 2p and n = 2q are both even.
We shall in the following go through the four possibilities.
1a) m = 2p is even and n = 2q + 1 is odd.
Use the substitution u = sin x (corresponding to m = 2p even) and write
cos2q+1 x dx =

1 −sin2 x
q cos x dx =

1 −sin2 x
q d sin x,
thus

sin2p x · cos2q+1 x dx =

sin2p x

1 −sin2 x
q d sin x =

u=sin x
u2p ·

1 −u2q du,
and the problem is reduced to an integration of a polynomial, followed by a substitution.
1b) m = 2p + 1 odd and n = 2q even.
Apply the substitution u = cos x (corresponding to n = 2q even) and write
sin2p+1 x dx =

1 −cos2 x
p cos x dx = −

1 −cos2 x
p d cos x,
from which

sin2p+1 x · cos2q x dx = −
 
1 −cos2 x
p · cos2q x d cos x = −

u=cos x

1 −u2p · u2q du,
and the problem is again reduced to an integration of a polynomial followed by a substitution.
2) When the degree m + n is even, the trick is to use the double angle, using the formulæ
sin2 x = 1
2 (1 −cos 2x),
cos2 x = 1
2 (1 + cos 2x),
sin x · cos x = 1
2 sin 2x.
2a) m = 2p + 1 and n = 2q + 1 are both odd.
Rewrite the integrand in the following way,
sin2p+1 x · cos2q+1 x =
1
2 (1 −cos 2x)
p 1
2 (1 + cos 2x)
q
· 1
2 sin 2x.
This is a reduction to case 1b) above, so by the substitution u = cos 2x we get

sin2p+1 x · cos2q+1 x dx = −
1
2p+q+1 · 1
2

u=cos 2x
(1 −u)p(1 + u)q du,
and the problem is again reduced to an integration of a polynomial followed by a substitution.

2b) m = 2p and n = 2q are both even.
This is the most diﬃcult one of the four cases. First rewrite the integrand in the following way,
sin2p x · cos2q =
1
2 (1 −cos 2x)
p 1
2 (1 + cos 2x)
q
.
The degree of the left hand side is 2p + 2q in the pair (cos x, sin x), while the right hand side only
has the degree p+q in the pair (cos 2x, sin 2x) with the double angle as new variable. The problem
is that we at the same time by a multiplication get many terms on the right hand side of the
equation, which then must be computed separately.
However, since the degree is halved, whenever 2b) is applied, the problem can be solved in a ﬁnite
number of steps.
We shall illustrate the method of 2b) in the following example.

Example 4.2.1 We shall compute the integral

The degree 0 + 6 = 6 is even, and both m = 0 and n = 6 are even. Thus we are in case 2b). By using
the double angle the integrand becomes

Table 1: The simplest Laplace transforms
4.3
Tables of some Laplace transforms and Fourier transforms
The simplest Laplace transforms were already derived in Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-4, The
Laplace Transformation I. These are given in Table 1.
We collect in the following tables the results from Ventus, Complex Functions Theory a-5 where
we always can use σ(f) = 0, so there is no need to specify σ(f) in the tables. The ﬁrst table is
ordered according to the simplicity of the function f(t), and the second one is ordered according to
the simplicity of L{f}(z). Instead of σ(f) we include a reference to where the function is handled in
the text.
