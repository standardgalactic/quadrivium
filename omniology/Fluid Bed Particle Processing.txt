Fluid Bed Particle Processing
Fluid Bed Particle Processing 
The present text introduces the use of fluidised bed processing in the context of wet granulation and 
coating. The text also covers introductory information about the mechanical properties of dry granules. 
This is a scientific field rarely taught at universities or engineering schools around the world although it 
has enormous and ever increasing relevance to the chemical and biochemical industries. Often students 
are left with nothing but qualitative tendencies and hands-on experience as no textbook yet covers all 
relevant subjects treated in this text. 
Being part of the powder technology field it is the aim of this text to narrow the gap between applied 
engineering and quantitative models and theory. The text is aimed at undergraduate university or 
engineeringschool students working in the field of chemical or biochemical engineering. Newly graduated 
as well as experienced engineers may also find relevant new information as emphasis is put on the 
newest scientific discoveries and proposals presented in recent years of scientific publications. In order 
to provide a firm theoretical background several of the relevant formulas have been derived in the 
appendix which is often impossible to find elsewhere even in scientific literature. It is the hope that such 
theoretical considerations may help the reader to understand how particle technology is closely related 
to other branches of chemical science and chemical engineering. The literature list may also hopefully 
be an inspiration for further reading in the small but highly important field of fluid bed processing.
I alone am responsible for any misprints or errors but I will be grateful to receive any critics and 
suggestions for improvements.

Introduction to fluid bed processing
1	 Introduction to fluid 
bed processing
The principle of a fluid bed is to maintain particles in suspension in a close area by blowing air through 
the particle bed. The state of the bed depends thereby on the air velocity and on the particle properties. 
A fluidised bed behaves like a boiling liquid. For instance will an object placed in the fluid bed float 
depending on its density, and the upper limited surface of the fluid bed remains horizontal if the bed is 
inclined (Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). Agglomeration in fluid beds is achieved by spraying the binder liquid 
onto the bed. The agitation forces combined with the drying air will ensure permanent collisions between 
the wetted particles thereby causing agglomeration. Drying in fluid beds can likewise be achieved by 
agitating the bed with hot air but without liquid addition. The drying end-point is detected by a sudden 
rise in the outlet air temperature and an equalization of the outlet air dew point to that of the inlet air. 
Coating in fluid beds is analogous to the agglomeration process and the coating liquid is sprayed onto 
the bed as well, although process conditions are changed in order to hinder agglomeration (Faure et al., 
2001). The principle of a typical fluid bed set-up can be seen in figure 1.
Figure 1: The principle of a typical (top spray) fluid bed set-up 
Sketch of a typical top-spray fluid bed with a conical fluidisation chamber that makes sure that the fluidisation 
velocity in m/s is greatest in the bottom of the chamber and lowest nearest the nozzle

Introduction to fluid bed processing
Fluid bed granulation is in some ways different from other types of mixer granulation because the gas 
supplied to produce particle agitation also is responsible for binder/coating solvent evaporation and 
heating of the particles. In addition the increase in particle size and the liquid addition to the bed is 
associated with many changes in fluidisation characteristics, especially the mixing properties of the fluid 
bed. Other phenomena of the like and the fact that trajectories of particles are not predictable, makes 
fluid bed processing difficult to model and optimise without extensive use of experiments. Nevertheless, 
fluid beds have found many applications and a range of types have been developed for different purposes, 
not only in the biotech industry (Tardos et al., 1997). 
1.1	
Types of fluid beds
Fluid beds used for granulation or coating are classified according to the nozzle position (top, bottom 
or side) and to the operating conditions (continuous or batch) (Guignon et al., 2002). Continuous fluid 
beds are widely used in the food industry but rarely in production of enzymes. Batch fluid bed reactors 
have a cylindrical or conical shape. Air is distributed through a bottom grid with an adequate partition 
and size of holes. Reactors are equipped with one or several nozzles and sometimes with a mechanical 
stirrer as well (Guignon et al., 2002). In general there exist four basic types of batch granulation systems 
useable for enzyme granules. The four types can be seen in figure 2. 
Figure 2: Different types of batch fluid beds. 
a) Top-spray, b) Bottom-spray, c) Wurster type, d) Rotor with side-spray (Teunou & Poncelet, 2002).
Top-spraying is the oldest and simplest technique with the spray nozzle placed at the top of the chamber 
and air blowing from the bottom. It is still widely used for wet granulation but the efficiency and quality 
regarding coating is generally poor and it is now often replaced by bottom-spray or the Wurster type 
(Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). Generally, granules prepared by top-spray have a looser structure and are 
more porous than granules prepared from the other fluid bed types (Rubino, 1999).
The collisions between particles and liquid droplets are considerably increased with the use of the bottom 
spray type. Introducing liquid from the bottom gives a shorter distance between nozzle and bed thereby 
reducing the premature drying of binder/coating liquid before impact and leads to a larger coating 
efficiency. This type of fluid bed is very efficient for coating but the risk of unwanted agglomeration 
during coating is higher than in a top spray due to the higher concentration of wet particles (Teunou & 
Poncelet, 2002).

Introduction to fluid bed processing
Work by Wurster in the fifties led to an improvement of the bottom spray bed called the Wurster system. 
By inserting a fixed cylinder into the chamber the circulation of the particles is changed and the drying 
rate increased, reducing the risk of agglomeration. This fluid bed type is particularly suited for coating 
(Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). 
A fourth type of reactor is called the rotor system. The reactor consists of a disc rotating in the fluidising 
chamber and the liquid solutions are added tangentially from the top of the reactor. The combination of 
rotation and bottom-up air flow provides specific properties such as higher spherical shape and density 
to the resulting particles. This type of fluid bed system is mainly used for coating, although the coating 
quality is similar to that obtainable with the Wurster type (Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). 
1.2	
Important fluid bed parameters
The most important parameters regarding air velocities in a fluid bed are the minimum fluidisation 
velocity Umf and the settling or terminal velocity Ut both in m/s. Umf is the velocity at which fluidisation 
is incipient. It is one of the most important design parameters and is used for processes as drying, coating 
and agglomeration. In general Umf can be described by the Ergun equation (Linoya et al., 1990):

The settling velocity Ut is the air velocity over which transportation by dragging or pneumatic conveying 
occurs. Above this high velocity the fluidisation will stop and the particles will be blown out of the bed. 
It is often desired to operate at a bed velocity between Umf and Ut to avoid carryover of particles (Kunii 
& Levenspiel, 1991). Rules of thumb state that a proper fluidisation velocity should be found in the range 
of 0.2 to 0.5 times of Ut and that Ut is at least ten times larger than Umf (Niro, 1992). Kunii & Levenspiel 
(1991) suggest the following equation for Ut:

It can be seen from equation 3.1 and 3.2 that besides the gas properties, it is the size and density of the 
particles that determine the fluidisation velocity needed to obtain a homogenous fluidised bed. The 
larger and denser the particles are, the higher the fluidisation velocity must be to keep the particles 
fluidised (Guignon et al., 2002). During the agglomeration process Umf will increase as the granule 
diameter increases. As a result, the excess gas velocity2 Ue will decrease and so will the overall bed mixing 
(Schaafsma et al., 1999).

The Geldart classification of particles
Recognizing the importance of particle size and density on fluidisation properties, Geldart has found 
four overall fluidisation modes and determined a general particle classification chart. For any particle 
of known density rp and mean particle size 
p
d , the Geldart chart indicates the type of fluidisation to be 
expected (Kunii & Levenspiel, 1991). The Geldart chart can be seen in figure 3:

Introduction to fluid bed processing
From the smallest to the largest particles, the four groups in figure 3 are: C, A, B and D. The group C 
particles are cohesive or very fine powders, which are often very difficult to fluidise. Starch and flour are 
e.g. group C particles. Materials having a small mean particle size and/or densities less than 1.4 g/cm3 are 
grouped into group A. Particles from this group fluidise well and as group A particles have the aeration 
properties required for coating purposes, particles suited for coating often come from this group. The 
group B particles are sandlike particles with mean particle diameters roughly between 40 mm and 500 
mm and density between 1.4 and 4 g/cm3. The fluidisation mode of this type of particles is highly affected 
by the formation of gas bubbles in the bed and group B particles often fluidise well. Particles from group 
D are large and/or dense particles and often difficult to fluidise. As the air flow rate required to fluidise 
group D particles is necessarily high, group D particles are not normally processes in conventional fluid 
beds (Kunii & Levenspiel, 1991 and Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). 
Although the division of powder particles into the four groups may seem unambiguous and rigid, it 
is important to note that at operating conditions above ambient temperatures and pressure, a particle 
may appear in a different group from that it occupies at ambient conditions. This is due to the effect 
of gas properties in form of rgas in the classification chart in figure 3. As far as fluid bed processing is 
concerned, changes in rgas in respect to ambient conditions often occur and thereby must be taken into 
consideration when using the Geldart chart (Rhodes, 1998). Nevertheless, the Geldart chart is widely 
used as an indication of the fluidisation possibilities for a given particle sample and often particles are 
simply referred to as “Geldart A particles” etc. The chart has proven useful at fluidisation conditions 
up to ten times Umf (Kunii & Levenspiel, 1991), and although the chart has been further developed to 
contain areas subdividing the four particle groups, the present chart in figure 3 may serve as a helpful 
and quick tool concerning the choice of fluidisation operating conditions for a given particle sample 
with known density rp and mean particle size

Advantages and disadvantages of fluid bed operations
Fluid bed processing has many advantages over conventional wet massing and drying equipment. All the 
granulation processes including agglomeration, drying and coating, which require separate equipment 
in traditional granulation methods, can be performed in one unit saving time, transfer losses and labour 
costs (Summers & Aulton, 2004). Other advantages are temperature homogeneity and a fast mass and 
heat transfer (Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). Uniformity between e.g. the final enzyme granule batches is a 
necessity both regarding agglomeration and coating. Unfortunately these requirements cannot always be 
fulfilled and most agglomeration and coating equipment is associated with sieves and grinders to control 
the particles size with some possible recycling. Fluid beds have however usually low recycling ratios  
(< 5%) compared to other types of equipment, which is an obvious advantage (Guignon et al., 2002).

Introduction to fluid bed processing
A drawback is that fluid beds are expensive and that optimisation of process and product parameters needs 
extensive experimental work, not only initially but also during scale-up from development to production 
(Summers & Aulton, 2004). There are numerous apparatus, process and formulation parameters that 
affect the quality of the final granule produced in a fluid bed. Some of the basic parameters are listed in 
table 1. The extent of this list3 coupled with the fact that interactions between the parameters are intense 
and not yet fully understood, makes fluid bed processing still a field between science and empirical 
technology (Litster, 2003).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
2	 The process and principles of 
Wet agglomeration
In the process of understanding and controlling the numerous stages and possible mechanisms taking 
place in a fluid bed, knowledge of the agglomeration process is essential. Whether or not agglomeration 
is the desired goal one should know at least the qualitative effects of the many parameters involved in the 
granulation process. In the following sections the stages of the agglomeration process will be presented 
and focus is brought onto the mechanisms and formulation and process parameters governing the granule 
properties and the effect upon their change. 
2.1	
Introduction to the stages of the granulation processes
The process of granulation has traditionally been described in terms of a number of different mechanisms, 
some of which is shown in figure 4 a). Such a picture of many competing mechanisms is confusing 
however, because the borderline between these mechanisms arbitrarily depends on the cut off size 
between granule and non-granular material, which again depends on the measurer’s interests. Instead 
it has become more common to view the granulation as a combination of only three sets of separate 
processes: Wetting and Nucleation, Consolidation and Coalescence4, and Attrition and Breakage (Iveson 
et al., 2001a). The principle of this modern approach can be seen in figure 4 b). Even though many types 
of enzyme granules are not made by agglomeration, much of the theory behind the nucleation, growth 
and breakage mechanisms has direct parallels to the coating process of larger granules. Hence each of 
the three sets of processes will be presented in the following sections.

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
2.2	
Wetting and nucleation
The initial step in all wet agglomeration processes is the process of bringing liquid binder into contact 
with dry powder and attempt to distribute this liquid evenly throughout the powder. For simplicity 
the top-spray fluid-bed situation is considered although many of the following principles easily can be 
applied to more advanced bottom-spray or Wurster fluid beds (Rubino, 1999 and Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Initially liquid droplets are formed at the spray nozzle from which they fall and impact the bed. After 
the initial impact the droplet wets and penetrates the bed surface by capillary action. Due to the mixing 
forces in the bed, the binder liquid and powder particles are mixed together to form a nucleus granule 
referred to as the nucleus. If the droplet is slow to penetrate the bed surface or if the flux of droplets on 
the surface is high, droplets will overlap and coalesce5. This will lead to a broad nuclei size distribution 
causing a broad final granule size distribution, which is often unwanted. Ideal nucleation conditions occur 
when one droplet produces one nucleus. This situation is referred to as “Drop controlled nucleation” 
(Litster et al., 2001). The principle of these five possible steps in nucleation can be seen in figure 5.
Figure 5: The five possible steps in nucleation.  
1) Droplet formation at the spray nozzle. 2) Droplet impact on the powder bed surface, wetting and 
possible breakage of the droplet. 3) Droplet penetration into the powder bed pores). 4) Mixing of the 
liquid and powder by agitation forming a nucleus. 5) Possible droplet coalescence at the powder bed 
surface (Based on Hapgood et al., 2002).
The area of the bed where the liquid binder and powder surface first come into contact is called the 
spray zone6. Two processes are important in the spray zone. Firstly, there is the nuclei formation, which 
is a function of wetting thermodynamics and kinetics. Secondly, there is the mixing of the powder and 
binder referred to as “binder dispersion”. This latter phenomenon is a function of mainly process variables 
whereas nuclei formation primarily is a function of the formulation properties (Iveson et al., 2001a). 
These two processes are the subjects of the following sections.

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
2.2.1	
Nucleation thermodynamics
Whether or not the binder wetting on the powder surface is energetically favourable is determined by 
thermodynamics. Especially two aspects have been found to have major importance. Firstly, the contact 
angle between the solid particle and the liquid binder and secondly, the spreading coefficient of the liquid 
phase over the solid phase (Iveson et al., 2001a). Both terms will be introduced in the following sections. 
Sufficient surface wetting as well as spreading is necessary, since a non-wetting/spreading binder liquid 
will either not adhere to the powder particles or only be present on or cover a very small area, thereby 
restricting nuclei formation (Tardos et al., 1997).
When a drop of liquid is placed in contact with a solid, three interfaces are present: The solid/liquid gsl, 
the solid/vapour gsv and the liquid/vapour interface glv. Each of these interfaces has their own interfacial 
energy7. The situation can be seen in figure 6. For a droplet that partially wets a solid, as it is the case 
with the liquid binder impacting of the powder bed, the total interfacial energy is minimal when the 
horizontal components of the interfacial tensions are in equilibrium. This situation can be described by 
the Young equation (Kontogeorgis, 2004), where q is the contact angle8 in degrees:

Thus by the combination, a relation between the work of adhesion and the contact angle is achieved. 
It is thereby obvious that if the contact angle is large (a large contact angle indicates poor wetting) 
the work of adhesion is small. With a low value of WA the nuclei are expected to be small and fragile 
resulting in weak and friable final granules. Indeed several authors report a direct connection between 
the solid-liquid contact angle and the characteristics of the final granulate product. It was e.g. proved 
experimentally that as the contact angle of the powder–liquid mixture increases the mean granule size 
and strength decreases (Teipel & Mikonsaari, 2004 and Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Figure 6: Droplet-solid-vapour interface.
The three interfaces present when a drop of liquid is in contact with a solid (Teipel & Mikonsaari, 2004).
The spreading coefficient l is a measure of the tendency of a liquid and a solid combination to spread 
over each other. Spreading coefficients indicate whether spreading is thermodynamically favourable or 
not. It is related to the works of adhesion and cohesion10 being the difference between them. There are 
three possibilities in spreading between a powder and a liquid. Firstly, the liquid may spread over the 
powder particles and create a surface film (lls) or secondly, the powder particles may spread or adhere 
to the liquid but no film formation occurs (lsl). The third possibility is that both the liquid and powder 
have high works of cohesion. The solid-liquid interfacial area will then be minimised or nonexistent 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). It is only the two first possibilities, which is interesting concerning nucleation. 
The lls and lsl is given by the difference between the work of adhesion and the work of cohesion for a 
liquid and a solid respectively (York & Rowe, 1994):

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Spreading will occur spontaneously when the spreading coefficient is positive. When lls is positive the 
binder will spread and form a film over the powder surface, and liquid bridges will form between most 
contacting powder particles creating a strong dense nucleus. When lsl is positive bonds will form only 
where the liquid and powder initially touch, because the liquid will not spread or form a film. Granules 
formed in this case have fewer bonds and consequently will be weaker and more porous (Iveson et al., 
2001a). Several investigations confirm that differences in granule properties can be correlated with the 
spreading coefficient (Rowe, 1989 and Zajic & Buckton, 1990).
2.2.2	
Nucleus formation kinetics
In practice the liquid-solid-vapour interface may not have sufficient time to reach its equilibrium state 
due to the interference from the agitation forces and drying occurring simultaneously in the fluid bed. 
Besides thermodynamics and wetting, the nuclei formation is hence also a function of kinetics. First of 
all the relative size of the droplets to primary powder particles will influence the nucleation mechanism. 
Nucleation with relatively small droplets compared to the powder bed particles will occur by distribution 
of the droplets on the surface of the particles, which then afterwards may start to coalesce. It will often 
lead to nuclei with air trapped inside (Iveson et al., 2001a). The principle can be seen in figure 7 a). This 
idea of distributing a liquid onto each particle is used intensively in the coating process, where the idea 
in that case is to avoid the subsequent coalescence from taking place, but to ensure at the same time that 
each granule is coated efficiently. The coating process is described in detail in later sections. 
Figure 7: The dependence of the nucleation formation mechanism on the relative size of the 
droplets to powder particle sizes. 
a) Distribution mechanism. b) Immersion mechanism (Iveson et al., 2001a).
If the droplet is large compared to the powder particles, nucleation will occur by immersion of the 
smaller particle into the larger droplet. The principle can be seen in figure 7 b). This produces nuclei 
with saturated pores. Once a large droplet of liquid binder impacts the powder bed, it penetrates into the 
pores of the powder bed surface to form a highly saturated initial agglomerate as indicated in figure 8. 
The immersion case is hence the most wanted situation in wet agglomeration (Iveson et al., 2001a).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Liquid penetration into the pores between the powder particles is driven by surface tension, contact 
angle and pore radius. The liquid will advance into the powder bed by flowing down successively smaller 
pores (Hapgood et al., 2002). Prior to depletion of the liquid, the liquid droplet has spread onto the bed 
surface. Denesuk et al. (1994) have showed that the spreading time ts is far smaller than the time of 
droplet penetration11 td indicating that as the liquid droplet contacts the bed surface, it will immediately 
spread to a semi-static12 configuration followed by a slower depletion process. Each of the time constants 
is viscosity dependent but the ratio ts/td has been proven not to depend on viscosity (Denesuk et al., 
1994). The time it will take for a liquid droplet of binder to spread, penetrate and saturate the pores of the 
powder bed, and thereby prepare the initial nucleus for growth, is thereby in practice solely dependent 
on the droplet penetration time (Schaafsma et al., 1998).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
No models have yet been developed for the absorption of droplets into agitated porous powder beds 
but a theory exists for the penetration of a single droplet into a porous surface. A first approach for the 
description of a theoretical droplet penetration time td was suggested by Denesuk et al. (1993 & 1994)13:

glv is the liquid surface tension, hliq is the liquid viscosity, q is the solid-liquid contact angle and Rpore is 
the effective pore radius based on the assumption of cylindrical parallel capillary pores in the porous 
structure given by Kozeny approach:

where s0 is the particle specific surface area expressed in m2/kg and rp is the particle density (Denesuk 
et al., 1993).
Hapgood et al. (2002) have showed that the Kozeny approach is only valid in a well-packed powder 
bed with homogeneous bed structures and narrow pore size distributions. Powders in fluid beds are 
however agitated in motion and extremely loosely packed. Loosely packed powder beds tend to have a 
heterogeneous bed structure containing irregular pore structure and macrovoids between the powder 
particles, which will affect the flow of depletion. Taking this into account, the Denesuk approach was 
extended with new expressions for the Rpore and epmsp and the expression of the theoretical droplet 
penetration time td then became14 (Hapgood et al., 2002):

This equation is based on the assumption that the powder particles are approximately spherical. Application

diameter of a sphere with the same surface to volume ratio as the irregular particle (Hapgood et al., 
2002). Hence the combination of d32 and f can be seen as an analogy to the inverse of the product of s0

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Based on the Hapgood model the penetration time is directly proportional to the viscosity and inversely 
proportional to the surface tension. In accordance with these predictions it was proven through numerous 
experiments that this was indeed the case. The droplet penetration time dependence on the droplet 
volume in the power of ⅔ was proved to be quite accurate (Hapgood et al., 2002 and Litster, 2003).
In characterizing and determining the wetting behaviour of a liquid onto the powder bed the droplet 
penetration time is a widely used parameter in that it contains both a thermodynamic and kinetic 
dependence. The wetting thermodynamics dependence is represented by (glv . cos q) and the wetting 
kinetics by the viscosity hliq and the effective pore radius Reff.
2.2.3	
Binder dispersion
The degree of binder dispersion indicates the quality of the mixing between the powder and the binder 
fluid, and it is strongly affected by the binder delivery method. Hence the binder dispersion is a matter 
of process properties and especially four operating variables are important and will be presented below: 
droplet size distribution, binder spray rate, the size and position of the spray zone and last, the size of 
the powder flux (Iveson et al., 2001a).
A narrow and well-defined spray droplet size distribution results in a controlled final granule size 
distribution, as the size and distribution of the binder droplets determines the nuclei size distribution 
(Tardos et al., 1997). Especially in fluid bed granulators15 a strong correlation between the droplet size 
and nuclei size distribution have been found according to the relation between the nucleus diameter16 
dn and the liquid binder droplet diameter dd:


(2.10)
in which k is a correlation coefficient ranging between 0.80 and 0.89 depending on the type of powder 
particles and binder solution (Waldie, 1991). In addition Schaafsma et al. (1998 & 2000a) have found 
that there is an approximately linearly relationship between the final mass of a granule and the mass of 
binder liquid sprayed:
b
g
m
J


(2.11)
where mg is the mass of the granule and mb the mass of the liquid binder sprayed. J is a proportionally 
constant called the “nucleation ratio”, which depends on material properties such as powder particle size 
distribution and the wettability of the liquid-powder interface. The better the binder liquid binds particles, 
which is reflected in a high nucleation ratio J, the less amount of liquid has to be used to granulate the 
same amount of material. This saves process time as well as money (Schaafsma et al., 2000a).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
One of the most widely studied variables affecting the binder distribution is the volumetric binder spray 
rate V. In fluid bed experiments the rate of nucleation increases as the binder spray rate increases. 
There is a general agreement among different authors that an increase in spray rate causes an increase 
in the final mean granule size, although the direct effect of the binder solution spray rate is difficult to 
determine separately (Schaafsma et al., 1999, Litster, 2003 and Liu et al., 2000). This is due to the fact 
that a change in spray rate usually is accompanied by a change in droplet size distribution. The droplet 
size may increase or decrease as the flow rate is increased depending on the type of nozzle used (Iveson 
et al., 2001a). Schaafsma et al. (1999) have showed in agreement with Heinrich & Mörl (1999) that 
spraying the binder in short pulses instead of continuous spraying leads to narrower final granule size 
distributions. The rate of nucleation or granule growth rate doesn’t seem to be affected by this. 
The location and shape17 of the spray zone is governed by the nozzle position and spray angle. Large spray 
angles and high nozzle positions in respect to the bed both increases the area of the bed exposed to the 
binder spray and increases the premature drying of binder liquid droplet before impact. This reduces 
the likelihood of binder droplets coalescing and reduces the sizes of the nuclei produced. There is no 
general agreement of how large the effect of changing the nozzle height is on the final average granule 
size, but some authors claim that by raising the nozzle position the average granule size is only slightly 
decreased (Iveson et al., 2001a and Litster et al., 2001).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Efficient powder mixing is essential to binder dispersion in all types of granulators. High powder flux 
through the spray zone allows more uniform distribution of the powder and the binder fluid by carrying 
local patches of high binder contents away and providing a constant supply of fresh powder into the 
spray zone. An increased powder flux through the spray zone reduces the final granule size, as there is 
less time and less binder volume available for nuclei formation per unit powder. Schaafsma et al. (1999 
& 2000a) found that the surface mixing resulting from the powder flux was the primary determining 
factor to avoid overwetting of the powder resulting in a bed collapse.
Litster et al. (2001) have combined the volumetric binder spray rate with the powder flux into an 
equipment independent parameter called the “dimensionless spray flux”18 ya :
d
a
d
A
2
V
3








(2.12)
where Ais the powder flux through the spray zone, V the volumetric spray rate of spherical droplets 
produced by the nozzle and dd is the liquid droplet diameter.
The dimensionless spray flux is a measure of binder coverage on the powder surface. A high value of ya 
indicates that the binder solution is being added too quickly compared to the powder flux rate (Iveson 
et al., 2001a). Droplets will overlap each other on the powder surface causing droplet coalescence and 
a broad nuclei size distribution. A low value of ya indicates on the other hand that the ratio of powder 
flux to binder spray rate is sufficiently high so that each liquid droplet lands separately and the nuclei are 
swept out of the spray zone before being rewet by another droplet. Size analysis and experiments shows 
that ya is a parameter for the control of size and shape of the nuclei size distribution, besides being a 
parameter to be kept constant during equipment scaling (Litster, 2003 and Mort & Tardos, 1999). This 
will become more obvious with the introduction of the nucleation regime map.
2.2.4	
Nucleation regime map
As described in previous sections, nucleation is a combination of single droplet behaviour (e.g. the liquid 
droplet penetration, contact angle, surface tension and other material properties) and multiple droplet 
interactions (e.g. the liquid spray flux, spray zone characteristics and other process variables). Depending 
on the powder and binder formulations and operating conditions, different nucleation mechanisms may 
dominate. Based on values of the liquid droplet penetration time td, the dimensionless spray flux ya and 
the particle circulation time19 tc, Litster et al. (2001) have proposed a nucleation regime map. The map 
is based on the postulation that three possible nucleation regimes exist: drop controlled, mechanical 
dispersion controlled and an intermediate regime. The nucleation regime map can be seen in figure 9.

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Figure 9: Nucleation regime map. 
Three types of nucleation regimes have been proposed:  
Droplet controlled, Intermediate and Mechanical Dispersion Regime (Litster, 2003).
In the drop controlled regime the controlling parameter is the liquid droplet size. The binder droplet 
penetrates into the powder bed pores almost immediately and the nuclei size distribution is reflected by 
the binder droplet size distribution. This is the desired region to be in. In this region one droplet tends 
to form one nucleus provided that two key conditions are met. The first condition is that the powder 
flux through the spray zone must be fast enough so that droplets, which hit the powder surface, do not 
overlap. This means that a low value of ya is essential. Secondly the droplet must wet and penetrate into 
the bed completely before bed mixing brings it into contact with another partially absorbed droplet on 
the bed surface. This situation can be achieved having a small droplet penetration time. The borders of 
the drop-controlled zone have been proven by different authors (Litster, 2003 and Iveson et al., 2001a).
In the mechanical dispersion regime, nucleation and binder dispersion occurs by mechanical mixing and 
agitation. The binder solution delivery method and thereby the effect of droplet size distribution, nozzle 
height etc. on the nuclei properties is negligible. In the extreme cases either liquid droplet coalescence 
will happen, if the droplet penetration time is very large (and ya is low), or caking of the powder bed 
will be the result, if the value of ya is too high (and td is low). In the mechanical dispersion regime often 
very broad nuclei size distributions are created, which is why it is undesired to operate in this regime. 
This type of regime is not typical to occur in fluid beds, although droplet pooling and caking can happen 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). 
In the intermediate regime both droplet penetration dynamics and forces of dispersion are significant. 
Clumps of unevenly distributed binder will form if the binder flow rate exceeds the binder dispersion 
rate. This regime has proven to be the most difficult to control thereby being an unwanted regime to 
operate in (Iveson et al., 2001a).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
The fact that the droplet penetration time is largely a function of formulation properties and that the 
dimensionless spray flux is largely a function of operating variables, makes the combination of these two 
parameters in a regime map a valuable and useful tool in the design of optimal nucleation and granule 
conditions. Based on the nucleation regime map it is possible to give reasonable predictions of the effect 
of changing formulation properties or operating conditions. This has proven useful in the design and 
scale-up or scale-down of granulation equipment (Litster, 2003). 
2.3	
Granule growth behavior
If wetting and nucleation is well controlled then the extent of nuclei consolidation and coalescence into 
granules will affect the final properties. As granules and nuclei collide with other granules/nuclei and 
equipment surfaces they gradually compacts. This reduces their size and porosity and squeezes liquid 
binder to the surface from the interior. This phenomenon is called consolidation (Iveson et al., 2001a). 
The low agitative forces in fluid beds are however only able to compact the granules to a confined level 
and the extent and importance of consolidation is limited. As an indication, the final granule porosities 
achieved in fluid bed granulation are often about twice the porosities20 achieved in high shear mixers or 
mixer drums (Schaafsma et al., 2000a). A high porosity has an importance regarding mechanical strength21 
but plays a minor role during coalescence. Hence the main focus regarding fluid bed granulation should 
be on coalescence rather than on consolidation phenomena (Schaafsma et al., 1998).

2.3.1	
Granule coalescence
Granule growth behaviour depends in general on the availability of liquid at or near the granule surface 
and the deformability of the colliding granules. In fluid beds where the impact forces are relatively 
small, little permanent deformation occurs during granule collisions. Granules coalesce by viscous 
dissipation in the surface liquid before the granule core surfaces contact (Liu et al., 2000). As the two 
particles approach each other, first contact is made by the outer liquid binder layer. The liquid will 
subsequently be squeezed out from the space between the particles to the point where the two solid 
surfaces will touch. A solid rebound will occur based on the elasticity of the surface characterized by a 
coefficient of restitution22 e. The particles will start to move apart and liquid binder will be sucked into 
the interparticle gap up to the point where a liquid bridge will form. This bridge will either break due to 
further movement in the bed or solidify leading to permanent coalescence (Tardos et al., 1997). In the 
described principle, granule coalescence will occur only if there is a liquid layer present at the surface 
of the colliding particles. This growth principle continues until insufficient binder liquid is available at 
the surface to bind new particles (Schaafsma et al., 1998). The relative amount of binder liquid present 
at that stage is called the wetting saturation Sw and it depends on the contact angle of binder liquid and 
the pore structure of the granule (Tardos et al., 1997). The wetting saturation reflects the wettability of 
the particle and it is often approximated by the binder droplet volume divided by the pore volume of a 
particle, under the assumption that no drying occurs (Schaafsma et al., 2000a). Schaafsma et al. (2000a) 
have showed that Sw is inversely proportional to the nucleation ratio J and the mean granule porosity
g . 
Ennis et al. (1991) have modelled the situation of coalescence in a fluid bed by considering the impact 
of two solid non-deformable spheres each of which is surrounded by a thin viscous binder layer. The 
situation can be seen in figure 10.

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
The model assumes successful coalescence to occur if the kinetic energy of impact is entirely dissipated 
by viscous dissipation in the binder liquid layer and only elastic losses in the solid phase. The model 
predicts that collisions will result in coalescence when the viscous Stokes number (Stv) is less than a 
critical viscous Stokes number (Stv

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
The Stokes viscous number Stv can be seen as the ratio of kinetic energy to the viscous dissipation. During 
fluid bed batch granulation Stv increases as the granules grow in size. This leads to three possible situations. 
The first so-called “non-inertial regime” occurs when Stv << Stv
*. All collisions result in successful 
coalescence regardless of the size of the colliding granules, granule kinetic energy or binder viscosity. As 
the granules grow larger the “inertial regime” occurs when Stv ≈ Stv
*. The likelihood of coalescence now 
depends of the size of the colliding granules, and granule kinetic energy and binder viscosity begin to 
play a role (Iveson et al., 2001a and Abbott, 2002). It can be seen from equation 2.15 and 2.13 that the 
collision between two small or one small and one large granule is more likely to succeed in permanent 
coalescence than the collision between two large granules due to the size of rharm and thereby the size 
of Stv versus Stv
*. This is a convenient way to understand why small particles agglomerate into larger 
ones (Tardos et al., 1997). Eventually the system enters the “coating regime” when Stv >> Stv
*. Here all 
collisions between granules are unsuccessful and any further increase in the Stv will maintain the size of 
the granules (Iveson et al., 2001a and Tardos et al., 1997). The existence of the three regimes has been 
proved experimentally in different types of granulators (Ennis et al., 1991). 
Granule growth is promoted by a low value of Stv and a high value of Stv
*. For instance, increasing the 
binder content will increase the binder layer thickness h which will increase Stv
* and hence increase the 
likelihood of successful coalescence. The effect of the binder viscosity is not easily predictable in that e.g 
increasing the value hliq (lowering Stv) alters the coefficient of restitution e decreasing Stv
* as well (Iveson 
et al., 2001a). Although the model is limited by its many assumptions25 it gives a rough number for the 
indication of the limit between no-agglomeration and successful agglomeration. 
Tardos et al. (1997) have related the Stv to the degree of consolidation acons defined as the distance Dx 
at which two coalesced particles get closer by consolidation divided by the initial distance equal to the 
binder layer thickness 2h. Hence for a given binder layer thickness h on each particle, the higher the Dx 
the higher the degree of consolidation. The relation is given by:

(2.18)
From equation 2.18 and the expression for the Stv in equation 2.13, it is obvious that if the collision velocity 
u0 is relative small (as it is the case in the low agitative fluid beds) the Stv will be small leading to acons ≈ 
0. Hence through the introduction of the Stv number it is possible to give a mathematical justification 
for not giving much attention to the consolidation phenomenon in fluid beds.

2.3.2	
Effects of different process and formulation parameters on granule growth behaviour
Although the Stv and the Stv
* are important parameters in the prediction of coalescence they are only valid 
for predicting the maximum size of granules which can coalesce. The parameters state nothing about the 
rate of granule growth. Different authors have showed however, that fast growth rates are attributed to 
the non-inertial regime while a slower growth is attributed to values of Stv close to or above Stv
* (Ennis 
et al. 1991 and Cryer, 1999). Schaafsma et al. (1998) have proved that in fluid beds the coalescence of 
granules is a much slower process than the initial formation of nuclei. Concerning rates of the whole 
granulation process, the rate of the growth stage is thereby often considered rate limiting. 
Experiments by Ennis et al. (1991) have indicated that the rate of granule growth is not affected by 
increase in binder viscosity when operating in the non-inertial regime. The granule porosity is however 
increased by increasing the viscosity. Keningley et al. (1997) found in addition that a large viscosity inhibits 
initial growth but aids granule growth on a longer time scale, and that increased binder viscosity leads 
to increased granule strength even though porosity is high and pore saturation low. Further Keningley 
et al. (1997) found that application of low viscosity binders results in lower granule porosities as well as 
a faster overall growth rate. Experiments conducted by Schaafsma et al. (1998) showed that the physical 
shape of granules depends on the viscosity of the liquid binder. As the viscosity decreases, an increase 
in the deformation of the final granule shape occurs. Decreasing the viscosity leads to agglomerates, 
which are more susceptible to forces in the fluid bed. The final granule were found to be oval instead of 
spherical when a low viscous binder was used.

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Rambali et al. (2001) have showed that the chance of coalescence is correlated with the moisture contents 
in the fluid bed. Relative high moisture contents give large granules whereas low moisture contents result 
in small size granules. This is due to the fact that high moisture contents will keep the binder liquid on 
the granule surfaces wet for a longer time thus increasing the chance of successful coalescence. This is 
in agreement with results found by other authors (Schaafsma et al., 1999, Iveson et al., 2001a and Faure 
et al., 2001) although results found by Cryer (1999) indicates that the correlation between granule size 
and moisture contents is far from linear and more likely consists of three domains. Schaafsma et al. 
(1999) have showed that increasing the relative bed humidity (rH) leads to increased deviations and 
scattering in the final granule size distribution. In addition they showed that rH has a high influence on 
the mixing behaviour in fluid beds and that above a certain critical value ranging from 45 to 60 rH% 
the minimum fluidisation velocity Umf increases, resulting in a decreased mixing. Increasing the rH 
beyond the critical value will eventually lead to collapse of the bed because the bed material becomes 
so cohesive that fluidisation becomes impossible. 
Schaafsma et al. (1999) found a distinct effect of the inlet temperature of the fluidising air on the granule 
growth. At lower inlet temperature of 40 °C the granules grew faster than at 60 °C due to lower drying 
rate at lower temperature, although the overall productivity decreased at the low temperature due to a 
longer drying period. In accordance with this, Härkonen et al. (1993) showed that the final granule size 
increases with decreasing temperature in the fluid bed, having a constant processing time. It was showed 
in addition, that the decrease in mean particle size at higher temperatures could be compensated by 
increasing the spray rate of the binder solution without overwetting the bed.
The fluidisation velocity has a complex effect on granulation growth behaviour because it alters both the 
frequency and energy of collisions between granules. Hence it can directly affect both the kinetics and 
the extent and mechanism of growth. Iveson et al. (2001a) report that increasing the excess gas velocity 
Ue in a top spray fluid bed leads to a decrease in the final granule size. This in agreement with what other 
authors report (Schaafsma et al., 1999 & 2000b) but the effect cannot be separated from the breakage 
and attrition phenomena which most likely also increases with increasing gas velocity, thus helping to 
decrease the final granule size (Watano et al., 1995).
2.4	
Breakage and attrition 
In the last step of the granulation process the granules grow too large to resist the agitative motions 
in the bed. Coalescence will be counteracted by either an attrition of debris of the granule surface or 
fracture of the granule either partly or totally. This is due to insufficient binder distribution or simply 
due to drying of the granules (Iveson et al., 2001a). A total fracture of wet or dry granules is seldom 
a problem in fluid bed granulation however. The low shear properties in the bed rarely give sufficient 
kinetic energy to fracture the granules completely (Waldie, 1991 and Schaafsma, 2000b).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Another more interesting destructive mechanism is the attrition and fracture chipping of dry granules. 
These phenomena lead to the generation of dusty fines. As the aim of granulation processes is to hinder 
dust, the attrition process is a situation to be avoided (Iveson et al., 2001a). There is limited fundamental 
work on fracture and attrition of wet and dry granules in fluid beds, but most of the basic theory regarding 
mechanical strength and breakage mechanisms is similar to breakage of the coating layer and will be 
discussed in combination with this in coming sections.

Simulation of the agglomeration process – a brief review on population 
balance theory
As an alternative to the agglomeration models generated by experimental work, the use of population 
balance (PB) models has received considerable attention during the last ten to fifteen years (Faure et 
al., 2001). A PB follows the change in granule size distribution from the birth of nuclei over granule 
coalescence until the granules leave the control volume, and a PB on particles can include kinetic 
expressions for each of the mechanisms responsible for changing the particle size (Cryer, 1999). The 
PB focuses only on the particle size distribution of the granules and fundamentally the entire size 
distribution is divided in small intervals. As the model follows the evolution of the granule growth, 
the model can compute how many granules that exist in each size interval at a given time. At the core 
of the problem with PB lies the estimation of the probability of coalescence when a granule or nucleus 
from interval i collide with a granule or nucleus from interval j. This probability of coalescence has 
been represented by a parameter b referred to as the coalescence kernel (Faure et al., 2001). The choice 
of kernel can dramatically affect the rate of coalescence and it is typically a function of time and the 
volume of the colliding particles. Much work has been done to optimise the kernel and more than ten 
different suggestions for an expression of b exist today (Cryer, 1999 and Liu & Litster, 2002 & 2004). 
There is no a priori justification of which kernels are appropriate for the given granulation system and 
a physical interpretation of the coalescence kernel is still missing (Faure et al., 2001 and Cryer, 1999). 
Hounslow et al. (1988) proposed one of the first population balance equations used for granulation 
based on geometrical scaled size intervals in which the volume of the particles in the next size class is 
twice the volume of the particles in the current interval. The Hounslow population balance is given by 
(Hounslow et al, 1988):¨

At the moment the PB models are used more as a learning tool to understand processes and mechanisms 
rather than being a final unambiguous optimisation tool. The models are often extremely complex and 
require several assumptions to be made for simplification and solving. These assumptions are often 
made on the probability of coalescence with time and they are usually compared with experimental data, 
thereby confirming the validity of the models or highlighting which assumptions are valid or not. The use 
of PB looks promising for granulation process control but the use of PB as a tool for scale-up purposes 
or for the description of the breakage mechanisms has not been proven useful yet (Faure et al., 2001).

Summing up on wet agglomeration – Qualitative guidelines for parameters 
influencing agglomeration
Now that the basic principles of wet agglomeration have been presented it would be convenient to sum 
up all the important formulation and process tendencies extracted from the previous sections in one 
place. Some of the most important formulation and process parameters and their effect and influence 
on agglomeration are stated in table 2. It should be noted that the majority of the parameters are 
interlinked meaning that a change in one parameter may cause a change in one or several others. Many 
of the interactions and correlations between the different parameters are either not tested or still not 
fully understood. The tendencies stated in the table should thereby function only as a rough qualitative 
guideline for the design and optimisation of the granulation process.

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Adjustable parameter
Qualitative prediction of the effect caused by change
Formulation parameters
Binder viscosity (hliq)
The influence of viscosity is complex. A high hliq seems to inhibit initial 
agglomeration but aid the long-term agglomeration tendency, increase 
strength but also increase porosity and decrease the growth rate. A low hliq 
will lead to a low droplet penetration time and low porosity, high pore and 
wetting saturation and increased overall agglomeration rate but also to 
increased deformation (Keningley et al., 1997 and Schaafsma et al., 1998). 
Besides having influence on Stv, growth rate and extent of consolidation 
etc., the influence of viscosity is complicated by the fact that binder viscosity 
changes during drying (Abbott, 2002).
Binder and powder surface 
tension (g)
To ensure adequate wetting, the surface tension of the liquid binder must be 
lower than the surface tension of the powder (Kontogeorgis, 2004). Granule 
strength however decreases as binder liquid surface tension is lowered 
(Abbott, 2002).
Binder droplet penetration 
time (td)
A low td is essential to ensure drop controlled nucleation and thereby a narrow 
final granule size distribution (Litster et al., 2001 and Iveson et al., 2001a).
Size of the initial powder 
particles 
Agglomerate strength is inversely proportional to powder particle size. The 
initial powder particles should be at least ten times smaller than the size of 
the desired granules in order to ensure appropriate final granule density and 
strength (Abbott, 2002).
Powder – liquid contact 
angle (q)
The contact angle q between binder and powder particles should be as small 
as possible to ensure adequate wetting (Kontogeorgis, 2004 and Teipel & 
Mikonsaari, 2004). Granule strength decreases as the contact angle increases 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Spreading coefficient (l)
Having lls as large as possible while at the same time lsl is negligible will 
ensure that the binder liquid is spread properly and that a liquid film is formed 
on each powder particle surface. This will maximise the chance of coalescence 
(Iveson et al., 2001a).

The process and principles of Wet agglomeration
Process parameters
Volumetric binder spray 
rate ( V)
Increasing the spray rate will increase the chance of agglomeration but a 
change in spray rate is usually accompanied by an ambiguous change in 
droplet size distribution (Schaafsma et al., 1999 and Liu et al., 2000).
Binder droplet size 
distribution
A uniform droplet size distribution is a prerequisite for a narrow final granule 
size distribution. To ensure that the nucleation occurs by immersion instead of 
distribution, the liquid droplets should be considerably larger than the initial 
powder particles (Waldie, 1991 and Iveson et al., 2001a).
Binder droplet volume (Vd)
A small binder droplet volume Vd will help to lower the droplet penetration 
time td but a too low Vd will lead to coating of the powder particles and result 
in fragile nuclei (Iveson et al., 2001a).
Spray nozzle height 
The effect of changing the nozzle position in vertical direction is ambiguous 
but there are indications that raising the nozzle height will decrease the 
chance of agglomeration resulting in smaller final granules (Iveson et al., 
2001a and Litster et al., 2001).
Powder flux ( A)
A high powder flux through the spray zone will help to hinder binder droplet 
overlap and ensure a narrow nucleus/granule size distribution. The chance of 
agglomeration decreases with increasing powder flux (Iveson et al., 2001a and 
Litster, 2003).
Fluidisation velocity (U)
The effect of the fluidisation velocity is complex because it influences both 
powder flux, drying rate and breakage phenomena. Tendencies indicate 
however that increasing the fluidisation velocity decreases the final granule 
size (Schaafsma et al., 1999 and Schaafsma, 2000b). 
Inlet temperature (Tinlet)
A decreasing inlet temperature often leads to faster agglomeration and larger 
granules although a too low inlet temperature will lead to overwetting and 
bed collapse (Schaafsma et al., 1999 and Abbott, 2002).
Fluid bed temperature 
(Tbed)
Decreasing the bed temperature leads to increased agglomeration and 
thereby an increase in granule size. At high temperature the chance of 
agglomeration is low (Härkonen et al., 1993, Guignon et al., 2002 and Iveson et 
al., 2001a).
Relative bed humidity (rH)
A high bed rH value increases the chance of agglomeration although 
increasing rH may also cause scattering in the final granule size distribution. 
Above a critical value the rH affects the fluidisation velocity (Watano et al., 
1995 and Schaafsma et al., 1999).
Dimensionless spray flux 
(ya)
A low value of ya is necessary to ensure that the powder flux A is high enough 
to avoid binder droplet overlap on the powder bed surface. Having a value of 
ya below 0.1 combined with a low droplet penetration time td will ensure drop 
controlled nucleation (Litster, 2003).
Stv versus Stv
*
The size of Stv versus Stv
*will determine the chance of coalescence. To ensure 
successful coalescence one should operate in the non-inertial regime having 
Stv << Stv
* (Simons & Fairbrother, 2000 and Iveson et al., 2001a).

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
3	 Granule coating principles and 
properties in fluid beds
The initial step of the coating and agglomeration process is always the same: The successful collision 
between a liquid droplet and a particle. In analogy with wet agglomeration a liquid coating is sprayed 
onto the agitated particle bed during coating. Where it was the coalescence phenomenon, which was 
desired in the agglomeration process, much effort is put into the coating process to avoid coalescence 
(Link & Schlünder, 1997). In the coating process it is desired to let the surface of solid granules be covered 
completely by a solid layer (as indicated in figure 8 a.) and this is achieved by exposing the granule to 
many succeeding spraying-drying cycles. This shell- or onion-like structure will capsule the original 
granule more or less homogeneously depending on the choice of process and formulation parameters 
and the number of spraying-drying cycles (Guignon et al., 2003). Coating of solid granules may be 
considered as an active packaging located on the surface of the granules. For particles of 0.1 to 10 mm 
in diameter the coating layer is often only about 10 to 15 mm thick. Nevertheless the coating layer has 
several important purposes (Guignon et al., 2002).

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
There are many advantages of granule coating. The coating layer can protect unstable ingredients in 
the granule from degradation factors such as heat, moisture, air and light. It can provide controlled 
or delayed release and reduce hygroscopicity. The coating layer also helps in changing the physical 
characteristics of the original material such as dust reduction, appearance and density modifications 
(Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). In addition the compressibility and mechanical strength of the granules 
can be improved through coating. Coating can also result in a more uniform particle size distribution 
and smoother granule surfaces, which improves handling, flowability and further processing (Guignon 
et al., 2003 and Kerkhof, 2000).
3.1	
Parameters describing the coating process and result
There is a significant analogy between the coating phenomena and the phenomena existing in the wet 
agglomeration process, including wetting, adhesion, spreading, drying, chance of coalescence, attrition 
and more. A description of the coating system should ideally take all these aspects into account, which 
is difficult not just because of the number of simultaneous phenomena, but also due to the fact that 
many process and formulation parameters are interlinked and in addition change during the process. 
One way to describe the coating process is to find the thickness of the coated layer. Assuming spherical 
coated granules, Dewettinck (1997) and Dewettinck et al. (1999a) have found a relation to calculate the 
coating thickness zc based on measurable parameters27:

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
As indicated in equation 3.3, Ec is a type of material efficiency expressing relations between masses. Other 
types of efficiencies28 can be derived as well, but it is often the coating efficiency, which is interesting 
regarding the final granule properties. The coating efficiency Ec itself depends on many factors in and 
around the bed. Among the important factors are: Bed temperature, bed humidity, coating droplet 
size, coating spray rate, fluidisation velocity and the composition of the coating material (Maronga & 
Wnukowski, 1997a), each of will be described in the next section. 
3.2	
Product, system and operating parameters affecting the coating process 
and efficiency
The temperature and humidity inside the fluid bed are the driving force behind the drying of the coating 
solution on the granule surface. When the temperature is too high there is little or no coating growth 
because of rapid surface drying and premature spray-drying of the coating solution before impact 
(Guignon et al., 2002). At too high humidity and/or low temperature on the other hand, the bed is 
likely to collapse due to wet quenching (Maronga & Wnukowski, 1998). It is often a basic assumption 
that all granules have the same temperature and moisture contents and that for all granules the coating 
and drying history is the same. This might be a reasonable overall assumption if the granule circulation 
time tc is low (Kerkhof, 2000). Results by Maronga & Wnukowski (1998) indicate however, that the 
temperature and humidity during the coating process in a top spray fluid bed varies significantly with 
radial and vertical position. During the coating process pockets of low temperature and high humidity 
are formed deep inside the bed, causing fluctuations in temperature of more than 10% on a °C scale. 
Based on these systematic fluctuations, the top spray fluid bed was formally divided into four zones, 
which can be seen in figure 11.
Figure 11: Zones in a top spray fluid bed during coating. 
Basically four zones exist in a top-spray fluid bed during wet granulation being the 
spraying zone, Primary drying zone, the Non-active zone and the Heat transfer zone 
(Based on Maronga & Wnukowski, 1998).

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
As seen in figure 11, the highest humidity and the lowest temperature are situated closest to the bed 
surface in the spraying zone. The size and rate of transfer to this zone are important factors because 
granules are coated if and only if they visit this zone. Maronga & Wnukowski (1997b) report that the 
actual size of the spraying zone is only a few percent of the bed volume. Increasing the size of the 
spraying zone decreases the variance of the coating distribution (Maronga & Wnukowski, 1997b). The 
highest T and rH fluctuations are reached in the drying zone although zones of low temperature and high 
humidity not always are correlated or identical. In the heat transfer zone the conditions are that of the 
inlet air. Between the inlet heat transfer zone and the drying zone a non-active zone exits, where neither 
temperature nor humidity changes significantly (Maronga & Wnukowski, 1998). The minimisation of this 
zone may at first seem advantageous to the coating process in order to decrease the particle circulation 
time. Nevertheless the non-active zone acts as a safeguard against the chance of wet quenching the bed. 
Hence the fluid bed coating process has to be operated with a significant size of the non-active zone 
(Maronga & Wnukowski, 1997b). 
Dewettinck et al. (1999a) proved that the size of the liquid coating droplet has an effect on the coating 
efficiency as well. A large droplet size results in less premature droplet evaporation before impact and 
therefore a higher coating efficiency Ec. This can also be understood through equation 3.2 and 3.3. As 
the coating content of the granule w increases in equation 3.2 with increasing droplet size, the coating 
efficiency Ec in equation 3.3 will increase as well. Larger droplets may however also increase the chance 
of agglomeration. Kleinbach & Riede (1995) suggest that small droplets with a narrow size distribution 
favour homogeneous final coating and Guignon et al. (2002) report that the droplet-granule size ratio 
must be at most 1 to 10.
The liquid spray rate increases with the air pressure through the nozzle. Experiments have showed that 
air pressure Pnozzle during coating should be between 0.5 and 3.5 bar depending on coating liquid viscosity, 
size of the particles being coated, distance from the nozzle to the bed etc. The higher the pressure the 
smaller the jet angle is, leading to small droplets and higher penetration depth into the bed. Above 3.5 
bar the droplets become less than 10 mm and a too high extent of premature drying occurs (Dewettinck 
et al., 1999a and Guignon et al., 2002). Increasing the coating spray rate means a shorter wetting time 
but also a necessary longer drying time in order to avoid agglomeration (Guignon et al., 2002). Low 
viscosity is a necessity in order to facilitate proper pumping through the nozzle. The coating solution 
is often added at ambient temperature, but preheating may be used to decrease the viscosity further 
(Guignon et al., 2002).

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
The fluidisation air is used to ensure a homogenous partition of all granules and also to dry the coating 
solution sprayed onto the granules. The granule flow pattern will directly affect the amount of coating 
liquid a granule will receive (Abbott, 2002). Hence the fluidisation velocity is an important parameter 
in coating as well. Giugnon et al., (2002) report that in a top spray fluid bed, the fluidisation velocity 
should be significantly higher than the minimal fluidisation velocity Umf in order for the coating growth 
rate to depend primarily on the coating spray rate and at the same time have negligible agglomeration. 
During the coating process by repeated wetting-drying cycles, the quantity of coating deposit is rather 
small leading to a variation in granule size and density of usually only a few percent. This does not 
affect the fluidisation in the same manner, as it is the case during agglomeration. Hence adapting and 
adjusting the fluidisation velocity during coating may not be as important as during agglomeration 
(Guignon et al., 2002). 
The composition and properties of the coating material is vital not just for the mass based coating 
efficient but also for the quality of the final coating. The optimisation of the coating liquid is more 
of a fundamental chemical rather than a process challenge and several attempts have been made 
to find the right coating compositions with sufficient properties. A selection of additives such as 
surfactants, plasticisers, texturisers, emulsifiers, anti-adherent agents and stabilisers can indeed improve 
the coating properties and avoid unwanted agglomeration. Such additions will however often cause other 
problems such as decreased adhesion on the granules and/or reduced mechanical or leaching properties 
(Abbott, 2002).

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
In industrial scale it is often difficult to add new compounds. Compromises must be found between the 
composition of the coating solution, economics, process conditions and legislation. Hence it is often a 
limited amount of new additives, which in practice may be chosen from. Often the choice is to optimise 
on the already given coating solution. One idea is to simply change the solute concentration (Teunou 
& Poncelet, 2002). Guignon et al. (2002) report that the chance of adhesion of the coating layer to the 
core material increases with solute concentration and surface tension for a number of coating materials. 
Both are parameters that increase during coating droplet drying. The stronger the adhesion is, the more 
likely is the tendency of unwanted agglomeration however. In the pursuit of suppressing agglomeration 
tendency in coatings Nakano et al. (1999) have added small concentrations of widely used salts to an 
existing type of polymer coating HPMC (hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose). It was found that granule 
agglomeration was strongly suppressed by adding even small concentrations (0.01 M) of salt to the 
polymer coating liquid, and the tendency increased with increasing concentrations. The coating efficiency 
increased with increasing concentration as well (Nakano & Yuasa, 2001). The suppressing effect was 
suggested to result from a reduction in viscosity of the coating solution caused by a salting-out of the 
polymer coating. Especially potassium citrate and sodium citrate proved superior to other well-known 
and used salts as: Na2SO4, NaCl, K2SO4 and CaSO4. Na2SO4 was the third best salt in full accordance with 
the ranking based on salting-out power of anions given in the Hofmeister series29 (Nakano et al. 1999). 
The final coating including sodium/potassium citrate showed however decreasing mechanical strength 
with increasing salt concentration (Nakano & Yuasa, 2001).
3.3	
Influence of product and formulation variables on coated 
granule morphology
Link & Schlünder (1997) have used SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy) to study the coating process 
using different coating materials and drying-wetting conditions. First the same types of particles were 
coated under identical conditions with different coating solutions. Using a low viscous lactose or PVP 
solution led to the formation of uniform non-porous surfaces without holes. This indicated that after 
impact the coating droplets spread evenly over the granule surface and the dried coating remained 
attached to the granule as small patches. A layer was gradually developed as the wetting-drying cycle 
was repeated. The PVP coating layer however had fine cracks caused by shrinkage of the coated layer 
perhaps due to too fast drying-wetting cycles. If drying happens very fast, the coated layer dries first 
at the surface to form a shell-structure containing unvaporised coating solution inside. As the solvent 
inside the solid shell starts to evaporate, the volume inside the shell will decrease causing shrinkage and 
cracking in the surface shell-structure.

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
Using solutions of NaCl and Ca(OH)2 with higher viscosity than PVP led to rough and raspberry-like 
structures. This indicated that after impact, capillary forces in the granule quickly dewatered the droplets. 
As a result the dewatered droplets stick on the surface almost unchanged in their original shape. The 
raspberry effect however decreased as the salt concentration decreased due to the decrease in viscosity 
and increase in drying time. This led to an increase in the merging of droplets before drying and a 
smoother surface. Guignon et al. (2002) report that the chance of a smooth and homogenous coating 
layer is improved if the granule surface before coating is smooth and with few pores, although adhesion 
of the coating liquid is improved by surface roughness. Examples of SEM pictures of smooth, raspberry-
like and crackled coatings can be seen in figure 12.

a) Smooth coating by aqueous solution of lactose. b) Smooth coating with cracks by aqueous solution of PVP.  
c) Raspberry structure by aqueous solution of NaCl (Link & Schlünder, 1997).
Next the liquid properties were kept constant and only the drying and wetting conditions were varied. 
The coating under high drying temperatures and long drying times led to highly porous surfaces with 
sharp-edged crystal structures, whereas coating under low temperatures and short drying cycles produced 
less porous surfaces with almost amorphous crystal structures. Reducing the droplet impact velocity 
to one half while keeping the drying-wetting cycle conditions constant led to an increase in raspberry 
structures. Further experiments with bed temperatures up to 120 °C and addition of surfactants to 
the coating solution created smooth and uniform coating layers with amorphous structures (Link 
& Schlünder, 1997). Whether or not the coating layer forms crystals is of great importance. Besides 
changing important properties as hygroscopicity and solubility, the mechanical properties of the coating 
layer is highly influenced by the extent of crystal formation. The formation of crystals will often lead to a 
stratified, porous and flaky coating layer with a high possibility of being degraded by attrition (Canselier, 
1993). In later sections more on the mechanical properties and types of coating destruction mechanisms 
will be described in detail.

Agglomeration or Coating?? – Qualitative trends and attempts of finding a 
boundary parameter
As discussed in previous sections, agglomeration in fluid beds is caused by collisions between 
wetted surfaces establishing a liquid bridge that gradually solidifies. One way to hinder the chance of 
agglomeration is to ensure that the moisture contents of the granules is low (Guignon et al., 2003). The 
moisture contents of the fluidised granules depend on the wetting and drying conditions. Besides coating 
spray rate, fluidisation velocity and bed temperature, the circulation rate of the granules determines the 
moisture contents of the granules at the moment of collision. Rowe (1972) reports a simple equation30 
for the calculation of the average circulation time tc during fluidisation with moderate gas velocities:

(3.4)
where hmf is the bed height at minimum fluidisation velocity Umf, Us is the superficial gas velocity 
(measured on an empty vessel basis) through the bed and Ubr the bubble rise velocity of gas bubbles in 
the bed. Usually tc should be only a few seconds to keep the moisture contents low and hence reduce the 
chance of agglomeration (Link & Schlünder, 1997). Abbott (2002) reports that the uniformity regarding 
size of coated granules is highly affected by the value of tc in a batch fluid bed. If the circulation time is too 
high, the number of time each granule will pass through the spray zone varies form granule to granule. 
This will lead to significant variations in coating levels and increase the chance of agglomeration even 
when the initial granule size distribution prior to coating was narrow. The tendency of agglomeration 
seems to increase drastically after a number of drying-wetting cycles indicating that agglomeration is 
negligible without a certain amount of coating layer (Teunou & Poncelet, 2002). 
Dewettinck et al. (1999a) & Maa et al. (1996) report that unwanted agglomeration during coating 
primarily is influenced by the type of coating and its hygroscopicity, water binding capacity and viscosity. 
Link & Schlünder (1997) report in addition in agreement with Giugnon et al. (2002) that the probability 
of agglomeration is correlated with viscosity. With increasing viscosity the adhesion-probability and hence 
the chance of coalescence is increased. This is somewhat in agreement with results found by Keningley 
et al. (1997) presented earlier.
Experiments by Maa et al. (1996) showed that the larger the coating chamber is, the less likely is the 
chance of agglomeration. In addition their results indicate that top spraying always causes higher degrees 
of agglomeration than with the Wurster coater. Further Maa et al. (1996) report that the higher the 
granule/droplet ratio, the lower is the extent of agglomeration. Agglomeration tendency was found to 
increase as the granule diameter decreased.

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
From experiments with a top spray fluid bed, Dewettinck et al. (1999a) found that the agglomeration 
was an all or nothing phenomenon meaning that for some conditions no agglomeration happened but at 
another condition severe agglomeration occurred accompanied by coverage of reactor walls and nozzle 
with agglomerated granules. The boundary was found to correlate with the evaporation efficiency Eevap 
given as:

where aHinlet is the inlet air absolute humidity, aHoutlet the outlet air absolute humidity and aHsat,bed the 
saturated air absolute humidity at the given bed temperature. One of the advantages of defining the 
coating-agglomeration boundary by Eevap is that the inlet humidity and bed temperature in some fluid beds 
quite easily can be changed step by step thereby accurately determining the agglomeration boundary value 
for Eevap. Typically values for Eevap where agglomeration occurs lies in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 depending 
on process and coating formulation conditions. Eevap is however only an empirical parameter, and it is 
still not possible to find the critical value for Eevap based on initial formulation or process parameters 
(Dewettinck et al., 1999a).

Granule coating principles and properties in fluid beds
Other authors have defined the boundary between coating and agglomeration by means of a critical 
or maximum liquid spray flow rate 
max
m
 (Guignon et al., 2003). It indicates the maximum amount 
of coating liquid that can be sprayed on the bed pr. min without agglomeration. Guignon et al. (2003) 
have found that 
max
m
 is dependent on the granules as well as the chemical properties of the coating 
droplets such as surface tension, viscosity and drying characteristics. This dependency on numerous 
parameters makes the maximum liquid flow rate unsuitable for other things than comparing different 
coating solutions during experiments. 
Based on statistical considerations, Litster (2003) has related the fraction of particles that agglomerate 
to the dimensionless spray flux by:

(3.6)
Although first validations in high shear mixers seems promising, the formula has still not been validated 
in fluid bed experiments. 
As mentioned earlier, the Stokes viscous number versus the critical stokes number can be used to 
distinguish between agglomeration and coating. The coating regime occurs when Stv >> Stv
*. In this 
regime all collisions between granules are unsuccessful meaning that agglomeration is negligible (Simons 
& Fairbrother, 2000). The difficulties in determining the coefficient of restitution e and the collision 
velocity u0 makes the viscous Stokes theory difficult to apply without experiments (Abbott, 2002).
All in all there is still no single parameter for the unambiguous determination of the boundary between 
agglomerating and coating based on simple process or formulation parameters. The need for empirical 
experimental work is thereby still extensive.

Qualitative description of key parameters governing the coating process – a 
first attempt to encircle an operating window
As indicated in previous sections, it is still not possible to state the quantitative optimal conditions 
for each of the parameters involved in the coating process. Based on the tendencies found in reported 
coating experiments in literature, it is however possible to give rough qualitative guidelines to avoid 
agglomeration and at the same time ensure proper coating. In a first attempt to encircle an operating 
window, some of the most important parameters are presented in table 3:

Adjustable parameter
Qualitative prediction of the effect caused by change
Formulation parameters
Coating liquid viscosity (hliq)
As it is the case for wet agglomeration theory, the effect of viscosity is complex 
because the viscosity plays many roles in different phenomena during coating. 
Experiments indicate that increasing the viscosity increases the chance of 
agglomeration. In addition, increased viscosity can lead to rough and raspberry 
structures. Low viscosity coatings may on the other hand mean that the coating 
droplet size becomes too small thereby causing a high degree of premature 
drying prior to droplet impact on the core surface. A low coating droplet 
viscosity may further cause a high extent of droplet drainage into the core 
material if the core has a significant porosity. Hence either a too high or too low 
viscosity may cause poor coating quality (Link & Schlünder, 1997 and Guignon 
et al., 2002).
Granule surface prior to 
coating
In order to improved the chance of a strong, homogenous and smooth coating 
layer the granule surface before coating should be rather smooth and with few 
pores. Adhesion of the coating liquid is however improved by granule surface 
roughness (Guignon et al., 2002). 
Coating additives
Additions of surfactants, emulsifiers, anti-adherent agents etc. may reduce 
the chance of agglomeration but also reduce the mechanical and leaching 
properties of the final coated granule (Abbott, 2002, Nakano & Yuasa, 2001 and 
Nakano et al., 1999).
Granule size vs. coating liquid 
droplet size
The chance of agglomeration is reduced as the granule diameter is increased and 
the droplet-granule ratio should be at most 1 to 10 in order to reduce the chance 
of agglomeration and at the same time ensure homogenous coating (Maa et al., 
1996, Guignon et al., 2002 and Kleinbach & Riede, 1995).
Process parameters
Type of fluid bed
The Wurster fluid bed seems to produce more homogenous coating layer 
than top spray especially with granule diameter less than 125 mm. In addition, 
the chance of agglomeration is lowered the larger the coating chamber is 
(Maa et al., 1996).
Bed temperature and drying 
time
Experiments have shown that if the bed/drying temperatures are too high, 
porous, raspberry-like and crystalline coating layers may result. The chance 
of agglomeration is however significantly smaller at high temperatures 
(Guignon et al., 2002). Amorphous coatings with lower porosities and 
improved mechanical properties can be achieved by combination of high bed 
temperatures, short drying cycles and the addition of surfactants to the coating 
solution (Link & Schlünder, 1997).
Fluidisation velocity (U)
Experimental indications suggest that U should be significantly higher than Umf. 
This will ensure that the circulation time tc is low enough to reduce the chance 
of agglomeration and at the same time enhance the chance of uniform coating 
(Guignon et al., 2002). 
Coating spray rate ( V) 
and nozzle pressure (Pnozzle)
The pressure through the nozzles governs the spray rate and experiments 
indicate that the nozzle pressure should be between 0.5 and 3.5 bar. This will 
ensure proper coating droplet size and proper droplet impact velocity. If the 
droplet impact velocity is too low, raspberry structure may result (Dewettinck et 
al., 1999a, Guignon et al., 2002 and Link & Schlünder, 1997).
Particle circulation time (tc)
Link & Schlünder (1997) suggest that tc should not exceed a few seconds in order 
to keep the moisture contents low and reduce the chance of agglomeration. If tc 
however becomes too small, shrinkage and cracking in the coating may happen 
due to inhomogeneous drying of the coated layer (Link & Schlünder, 1997).
Size of the spray zone
Maronga & Wnukowski (1997b) have showed that as the size of the spray zone 
increases, the variance of the coating distribution decreases.

Mechanical properties of granules and coating

Fluid Bed Particle Processing
4	 Mechanical properties 
of granules and coating 
layer – strength and 
breakage mechanisms 
As indicated in previous sections, a final coated granule consists of typically several different species 
combined in a heterogeneous way. In a physical sense a granule is often considered a composite material 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). Given the heterogeneity of coated granules, it is not obvious that their mechanical 
properties can be described by the properties used for the description of metals, ceramics and other 
conventional solids. Granule deformation and destruction mechanisms are however fundamentally 
similar to other solids (Bika et al., 2001). As in other composite materials, the stress in a granule is 
transformed non-uniformly, meaning that it is concentrated in preferred paths, where some areas 
experience high stress loads and others little or no load. Another common characteristic is the distribution 
of defects (e.g. pores or grains) and internal and surface cracks that may dominate the macroscopic 
response to stress (Bika et al., 2001). These similarities imply that the description of failure in conventional 
solids can be applied to granules as well and that granule strength is directly related to failure mechanisms 
(Scarlett et al. 2002). Likewise can the mechanical properties of a granule crudely be described by the same 
set of properties used for characterising solids: The Young´s modulus31, yield strength, tensile strength, 
ductility/brittleness, fracture toughness and hardness (Bika et al., 2001). Each of these properties will 
briefly be introduced in the following section in respect to granules. 
4.1	
Properties characterising the granule strength
The degree to which a structure deforms or strains, depends on the magnitude of the imposed stress. 
For some materials that are stressed in tension at low levels, stress and strain are proportional through 
(Callister, 2001):

E




(4.1)
where G is the strain, s is the stress and E is the Young´s modulus. This modulus may be thought of 
as stiffness or the resistance of a material to deform elastically. The stiffer the material, the greater the 
modulus. The Young´s modulus in granules is often determined by compression or indentation tests32 
(Jørgensen, 2002).

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
Deformation in which stress and strain are proportional is called elastic deformation, which is a non-
permanent deformation meaning that as the applied load is released, the granule returns to its original 
shape (Callister, 2001). Increasing the stress-strain rate further will lead to permanent plastic deformation 
and eventually to breakage. The point where plastic deformation starts to occur is called the yield stress or 
yield strength sy. Some of the simplest tests for determining sy are indentation or confined compression 
tests (Iveson et al., 2001a).
The maximum point in the strain-stress curve is called the tensile strength st. This point corresponds 
to the maximum stress that can be sustained by a structure in tension. If this stress is applied and 
maintained, fracture will result (Callister, 2001). The stress to failure sf of a spherical agglomerate with 
uniform structure of radius Rsph under compression load Fc in one dimension can be found as:

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
Experimental tensile strength is not always a readily measured property in granules because stress 
concentration may cause brittle fracture at much lesser values than the true tensile strength. The 
experimental determined tensile strength of granules has long been known to be a variable depending 
on the specimen size but not linearly. Hence a statistic data treatment is necessary. The Weibull two-
parameter distribution can be used to express the probability Ps(s) of a granule sample to survive a 
given stress s (Bika et al., 2001):

where nWeibull is the Weibull modulus related to the range of flaw sizes present in the granule. The nWeibull 
can be considered as a measure of the brittleness of the sample. The smaller the value of nWeibull, the 
more brittle the sample. The second parameter s0 is the Weibull constant being a characteristic strength 
value of the material. More precisely it is the stress at which 1/exp(1) = 37% of the specimens remain 
unbroken (Bika et al., 2001).
Brittleness and ductility are important terms in describing the mechanical properties of a granule. 
Ductility is a measure of the degree of plastic deformation that has been sustained at fracture. A material 
that experiences very little or no plastic deformation upon fracture is termed brittle. Ductile materials 
on the other hand may experience large extent of plastic deformation without fracture (Callister, 2001). 
Granules are often considered semi-brittle in that limited plastic deformation can occur besides brittle 
fracture (Iveson et al., 2001a). 
The fracture toughness Kc of a granule defines the elastic stress field in the granule ahead of a propagating 
crack. In other words it is a measure of granule resistance to crack propagation. Fracture toughness is 
typically measured on a macroscopic scale in a special indentation test in which a specimen containing 
a sharp crack of known length is subjected to an applied load F, which is increased during the course 
of the test until the specimen fails. For such specimen, the magnitude of the stress near the crack tip 
is described by the stress intensity factor K, which in turn depends on the stress to failure sf, the crack 
length c, the radius of the granule rg and a dimensionless specimen dependent factor M according to 
(Efunda, 2005):

The fracture toughness Kc is defined as the magnitude of the stress intensity factor K at the point of

where c is the proportionality constant depending on the indenter dimensions and H is the hardness. 
The hardness is a measure of a granule resistance to plastic deform. It is defined as the applied load 
divided by the projected area of the indent after unloading (Jørgensen, 2002). A hard material is often 
brittle and typically less resistant to propagation of cracks. As seen from equation 4.5 a hard granule 
should have a low fracture toughness, which indeed has been reported by Bika et al. (2001). The inverse 
proportionality between Kc and the radial crack length c is obvious. The longer the crack length the 
weaker the material gets, resulting in lower fracture toughness. 
Having defined some of the most important properties and parameters for characterising the mechanical 
properties of granules, the next section is devoted to the description of breakage mechanisms.
4.2	
Types of breakage mechanisms
The existence of cracks and the extent of crack propagation is of high importance in semi-brittle materials 
as granules. Several types of destruction can be traced back to the existence of cracks in the granule 
surface or cracks in the core. A distinction between lateral and radial cracks has been made by Ghadiri 
& Zhang (2002). Radial cracks propagate radially from the surface to the inner of the granule whereas 
lateral cracks propagate closely parallel to the granule surface. 
The principle of a granule failing by radial crack propagation can be seen in figure 13. The tensile stress 
concentrates near the crack tip and is much higher than the applied stress leading to local yielding near 
the crack tip. This zone is called the “process zone33” (Iveson et al., 2001a). The crack will thereby gradually 
propagate from the edge of the process zone to the interior of the granule causing degradation of the 
granule mechanical strength. The principle of lateral crack propagation is analogous but the strength 
degradation only concerns the outer layer of the granule. Often radial and lateral cracks propagate 
simultaneously (Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Figure 13: Fracture of a granule (semi-brittle) by radial crack propagation. 
As the granule impact a rigid target or simply just another granule the crack will propagate in the opposite direction 
of the direction of the impact velocity (based on Iveson et al., 2001a and Jørgensen, 2002).

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
The process zone plays a large role in the mechanisms of granule breakage. The size of the process zone 
in respect to the granule size along with the main type of crack propagation will determine the type of 
destruction. E.g. will granules with a small process zone in comparison to the size of the granule break 
by a brittle fracture mechanism. This mechanism is called fragmentation or fracture34 (Iveson et al., 
2001a). Fracture of a granule is major internal breakage due to the application of very large or repeated 
external forces head-on. Due to fracture there is drastic reduction in the granule size and the resulting 
daughter particles are large compared to the original mother granule (Pitchumani et al., 2003). Fracture 
is the most severe kind of breakage because the original granule structure is completely destructed and 
the granule core is exposed to the surroundings (Jørgensen et al., 2004). 
For fracture to occur, the granule must be able to concentrate enough elastic energy to propagate single 
radial cracks throughout the granule structure. This is harder to do as the size of the process zone 
increases. Hence fracture will only occur if the process zone is significantly smaller than the granule size 
(Iveson et al., 2001a). Thornton et al. (2004) and Mishra & Thornton (2001) have showed that fracture 
is often associated with dense granules whereas other more porous and more loosely packed granules 
destruct by other type of mechanisms.

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
Another type of fracture is chipping. If the granule is applied to large external forces tangentially instead 
of head-on35, deep lateral cracks will propagate and the surface area of the granules is damaged and some 
material is chipped off. Next to fracture chipping is a very severe type of damage. Due to chipping, the 
granule surface will become rougher and exposure of the inner coating layers and even the granule core 
may occur, although the inner granule core structure is usually kept intact (Jørgensen et al., 2004 and 
Pitchumani et al., 2003). A formal classification of the different types of breakage mechanisms can be 
seen in table 4. The last two types are presented below. 
Force 
Normal force 
Tangential force 
Wear 
Small force 
(only local damage) 
Attrition  
(by erosion, peeling or fatigue)
Abrasion 
Fracture 
Large force  
(widespread damage) 
Fragmentation 
Chipping 
Table 4: Formal classification and summary of possible granule breakage mechanisms. 
Basically four types of granule failure mechanisms have been proposed being attrition, abrasion, fragmentation and chipping 
(Based on Beekman, 2000 and Pitchumani et al., 2003).
For many granules the process zone is of the order of the granule size and fracture of granules and 
especially coated granules is rare (Ennis & Sunshine. 1993). Instead other types of destructive mechanisms 
occur. Wear is the overall term for gradual surface damage that merely peels off or polishes the granule 
leaving the original shape more or less unchanged (Pitchumani et al., 2003). Abrasion is wear caused 
by low magnitude tangential forces. The small tangential forces lead to polishing and rounding of the 
granules. This will generate fine particles and the mother granules become more and more spherical 
and smoother with time by gradually loosing primarily the coating layer (Jørgensen et al., 2004 and 
Pitchumani et al., 2003). 
Wear caused by low magnitude of head-on forces leading to the propagation of lateral cracks is called 
attrition. The forces acting on the granule result in the removal of sharp edges producing a more spherical 
granule shape. Beekman (2000) have subdivided the attrition phenomena into two subgroups: attrition 
by fatigue and attrition by erosion. Often impact forces causes attrition and it is often observed that 
it takes many impact events before any damage of the granules can be observed. During the impact 
events, cracks propagate and finally lead to damage with an ever-increasing rate of loss of mass with 
time (Beekman, 2000). This type of attrition damage is called fatigue and depending on the depth of the 
crack propagation this may eventually lead to chipping or even fracture.

Erosion is the attrition mechanism occurring when a granule gradually losses mass mainly from the 
outside of the granule. Uneven parts of the granule surface are eroded and the rate at which the granule 
loses mass is constant or decreasing with time (Beekman, 2000). When erosion only affects a specific 
surface layer it is called peeling. Initially the rate of erosion will be constant but decrease after the weak 
layer is removed. Peeling is often observed for granules that have a layered structure such as coated 
granules (Beekman, 2000, Jørgensen, 2002 and Jørgensen et al., 2004). 
4.3	
Towards a quantitative prediction of breakage mechanisms 
In order to try to quantify the different breakage mechanisms it is desirable to describe the mechanisms 
by fracture mechanical parameters such as the fracture toughness Kc and by mechanical properties that 
define deformability (Young´s modulus E, yield strength sy and hardness H). It has long been realised 
that the type of breakage mechanism is also controlled by external factors such as temperature, pressure, 
impact velocity, type of load application (e.g. shear, tensile or compression impacts) and most importantly 
loading rate and granule history (Bika et al., 2001). The limited number of experiments so far allows 
only approximate relations to be suggested. These relations are however an important step towards a 
thorough quantitative prediction of the extent and type of breakage mechanism.
Iveson et al. (2001a) suggest in agreement with Bika et al. (2001) the following relation based on 
experimental studies between the fractional volume removed by abrasive wear Vabrasion per granule impact 
and the following parameters:
1/2
3/2
c
g
n
g
abrasion
H
K


d
V


(4.6)
where rg is the granule density, dg is the granule diameter, n is the impact velocity and n is a number 
ranging from 2.5 and 4. An unambiguous velocity dependence has however not been determined yet due 
to severe problems in testing abrasive wear mechanisms without the influence of other types of destructive 
mechanisms. Instead another more widely proved relation for indentor analysis of abrasion has been 
suggested by Bika et al. (2001) based on fracture mechanics theory as well as experimental data fitting: 
5/4

3/4
c

F


(4.7)
where Ai is the apparent area of indentor contact and F is the total applied indentor load. 
It is worth noting that in both equation 4.6 and 4.7, Vabrasion is inversely dependent on both the fracture 
toughness Kc and the hardness H. Several authors have proved these tendencies (Bika et al., 2001 and 
Ennis & Sunshine, 1993) although Mullier et al. (1991) suggest that Vabrasion should depend on 1/Kc instead 
of 1/Kc
3/4 in equation 6.7.

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
Attrition is the most studied of the four overall breakage phenomena possible because it is the most 
observed mechanism in fluid bed equipment. Another reason may be that experiments exposing granules 
to head-on forces by impact tests are easier to conduct than tangential force tests. Unfortunately some 
attrition experiments show signs of surface deterioration by several of the mechanisms simultaneously. 
This is especially the case when large numbers of granules are tested together in bulk tests. It is thereby not 
always possible to determine the mechanisms individually and often the observed breakage mechanism 
is simply referred to as attrition without further specification (Beekman, 2000). As indicated, “attrition” 
should only refer to wear by head-on forces, but the widespread use of the term has resulted in the 
use of “attrition” to describe all kinds of material losses from attrition by fatigue to fracture. Hence 
the attrition relations presented below may also be applied for the description of fracture mechanisms  
(Bika et al., 2001). 
There still exists no unified description or method to assess, quantify or predict attrition although several 
attempts have been made. Ghadiri & Zhang (2002) suggests the following proportionality between the 
fractional volume removed per impact by attrition Vattrition and the following parameters36:

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
It is interesting to notice from equation 6.8 that the fractional loss is proportional to the impact kinetic 
energy rgn2 and that it varies linearly with particle size dg. That rgn2dg should be depend linearly with 
Vattrition complies fully with results found by Beekman et al. (2002) who showed a direct proportionality. 
Comparing equation 6.6 with 6.8 indicates that impact attrition is more sensitive to fracture toughness 
Kc than abrasive wear. The velocity dependence in both equations are in accordance with experimental 
evidence. The higher the velocity the more material is lost, meaning that the more severe the type of 
breakage mechanism is. There is a general agreement in literature that breakage of granules increases 
with increasing impact velocity (Subero et al., 1999, Mishra & Thornton, 2001, Scarlett et al., 2002 and 
Jørgensen et al., 2004). At increased impact velocity, the primary breakage mechanism is changed from 
attrition/abrasion to chipping and finally fracture. In addition it can be seen by comparison that the 
effect of hardness H on attrition is the opposite of that for abrasion. It can be seen from equation 6.8 
that a high value of H promotes chipping/fragmentation. Hardness acts to concentrate stress for fracture 
during impact and it is seems plausible that the fractional volume of a granule removed by attrition 
depends linearly on the hardness H (Iveson et al., 2001a). The dependence on hardness is however not 
ambiguous. Liu et al. (2003) have tested several polymer coatings and found that the degree of attrition 
increases (although not much) with decreased coating hardness, whereas Ghadiri & Zhang (2002) suggest 
a direct linear relationship between H and Vattrition.
As late as 1969 by Gwyn et al. proposed an empirical model for the prediction of the weight fraction Y 
of a granule sample, that has undergone attrition as a function of time t in a fluid bed. The parameter 
Y thereby goes from zero at no attrition to the size of one at point where all the granules in the sample 
have undergone attrition. The empirical relation was found to be (Gwyn, 1969):
Gwyn
n
attrition
t
Q
Y



(4.9)
where nGwyn is an empirical constant and Q is a constant dependent on the initial granule size. Where Q 
represents the severity of attrition and the initial attritability of the granule, nGwyn concerns the change 
in attritability with time. Hence the two parameters are descriptive of both the material properties and 
the attrition process (Neil & Brigdwater, 1999). Results by Neil & Brigdwater (1999) indicate that nGwyn 
could be split up into two parameters such that nGwyn = x . fattrition where x is a term describing the rate of 
granule degradation and fattrition is a material property of attrition. This expansion should help adapting 
the formula to different types of equipment and take into account the different attrition rates in erosion 
and fatigue. The Gwyn formula has been studied intensively and it has been found to characterise the 
extent of attrition successfully in many types of equipment besides fluid beds.

As it is the case with the Gwyn formula, the previously presented relations describing the volumetric 
wear rates are primarily found on the basis of homogenous granules with an isotropic structure. The case 
is somewhat more complicated when dealing with coated granules. Hence the presented relations may 
only help to give a qualitative prediction of the effect of the different parameters. There are still extensive 
needs for empirical experience concerning the mechanical properties of coated granules. 
4.4	
Qualitative trends of parameters affecting breakage 
Although only very few attempts have been made to quantify the types of breakage mechanisms, a 
number of qualitative trends (besides the already mentioned) have been reported in literature. These 
tendencies have not yet been incorporated into models or equations but knowledge of them is nevertheless 
important. A brief review of some of the most interesting trends is presented below.
Guignon et al. (2002) report that in fluid bed experiments the extent of attrition is lowered the more 
uniform the shape of the granule surface is. In addition, experiments by Jørgensen et al. (2004) indicate 
in agreement with Pitchumani et al. (2003) that the type and extent of breakage depends on surface 
friction as well as initial granule shape. Further Jørgensen et al (2004) showed that the stronger the core 
the better the breakage resistance of the final coated granule. Coating layers of inorganic salts and water-
soluble polymers enhance the breakage resistance of the granules tremendously (Jørgensen et al., 2004). 
This is in agreement with results found by Liu et al. (2003) and Beekman et al. (2003). Their experiments 
indicate that the coating attrition rate is highly affected by both the core granule composition as well as 
the binder properties of the coating layer. 
Experiments by Scarlett et al. (2002) indicate that the type of breakage mechanism is nearly independent 
of granule size. This is somewhat in contradiction to Guignon et al. (2002) who report that in fluid bed 
experiments, the extent of attrition is lowered the smaller the granules are. Guignon et al. (2002) report 
further that attrition during the drying-wetting cycles is decreased by combining a short intense drying 
time with the addition of a surfactant to the coating solution to improve adhesion.
Impact tests of granules made by Salman et al. (2004 & 2002) showed that change of impact angle away 
from normal 90° had little influence on the type and extent of breakage mechanism. However for impact 
angles less than 10° no fragmentation was observed regardless of the impact velocity. Other interesting 
aspects regarding fragmentation were found by Salman et al. (2002). Experiments showed that the impact 
target thickness and material has a significant effect on particle fragmentation. In order to reduce the 
chance of fragmentation, the impact target should be thin and/or soft. This becomes relevant not just 
for the fluid bed design, but also when designing storage tanks and conveying systems.

Modern approach – a brief review on computer simulation of 
granule breakage
Besides the attempts to find experimental-based relations, some researchers have taken a different 
approach to predict granule breakage behaviour using primarily DEM (Discrete Element Models37) 
(e.g. Subero et al., 1999, Thornton et al. 2004 and Mishra & Thornton, 2001). In DEM, particles are 
treated as discrete entities, which interact with each other at the interface when they are in contact. The 
used particle interaction principles are based on well-established contact mechanics theories (Mishra & 
Thornton, 2001). This simulation technique can be used to simulate two-dimensional breakage behaviour 
in granules with randomly generated spherical packing. The breakage pattern upon impact with a rigid 
target is then studied (Salman et al., 2004). Improvements by Subero et al. (1999) have made it possible 
to simulate three-dimensional granules upon impact. Problems in quantifying the breakage phenomena 
makes the use of population balance modelling difficult although first attempts have been reported by 
Salman et al. (2003). Potapov & Campbell (1994) have used another approach to simulate the breakage 
behaviour of homogeneous elastic solids impacting against a rigid wall. Instead of discrete elements, 
the elastic solid is divided into contiguous polygonal elements, which are considered broken when the 
tensile force is found to exceed a certain limit. This type of approach made it possible to simulate and 
study fracture patterns for a number of solids.

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
Simulations have primarily been used to support qualitative trends found by experiments. Only in the 
last few years, simulations have been used for the investigation of the effect of the macroscopic granule 
mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity, hardness and fracture toughness. In general, the 
results from computer simulations rely heavily on the accuracy of the equipment producing the empirical 
data, which the simulation results are held up against. Recent use of fine scale equipment such as nano-
indentation and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) along with faster computers, have allowed advanced 
simulation of impact breakage on three-dimensional granules with random packing (Subero et al., 1999). 
Still no simulation is able to take into account all the random breakage phenomena that can take place 
during fluid bed processing and many of the tendencies found by simulation are only valid as qualitative 
support for the specific equipment (Thornton et al., 2004). Industrial granules consisting of several 
materials with different mechanical properties are still too complex to simulate (Beekman, 2000). There 
is however no doubt that the combination of computer simulation with careful fine scale measurement 
remains an open area for future research in the coming years. 
4.6	
Strength test methods – a brief review
In early literature most of the attention was focussed on the energy used to cause breakage and some 
of the tests used were small scale grinding machines operated at prescribed conditions. These test were 
unfortunately very dependent on the equipment and poor repeatability was often a problem. In later 
improvements the operating, equipment and material variables were to be separated and focus was 
brought onto mechanical strength as a function of load, velocity and stress (Linoya et al., 1990 and 
Beekman, 2000). Modern tests are often optimised to determine tendencies with high repeatability and 
little equipment dependence (Beekman et al., 2002 and Beekman, 2000). A general challenge for particle 
tests is that granules often are of a complex structure containing different materials in the core and 
coating layer (Pitchumani et al., 2003). Modern tests are conveniently divided into either bulk or single 
particle tests. There are numerous test methods in both categories and the following sections will not 
go into detail with each method. Instead a brief overall introduction will be given in order to present 
the possibilities, advantages and limitations of the different granule test types.

4.6.1	
Bulk test methods
A bulk test is useful for determining the average strength of a sample of particles. Multiple particle tests 
offer the advantages of testing a great number of particles simultaneously and they show the closest 
resemblance to particle handling in process equipment (Jørgensen et al., 2004). The types of equipment 
used for bulk tests are often closely related to the process equipment used to produce the granules. 
Examples of different bulk test methods can be seen in figure 14:
Figure 14: Examples of bulk particle test methods. 
Rotary drum apparatus, ball mill and rotating tube (Linoya et al., 1990).
Much attention must be attained to secure that each granule experiences approximately the same 
treatment in the test. Otherwise the results are statistically useless. There are several problems associated 
with bulk tests. E.g. are many of the tests highly dependent on the initial particle size distribution. One 
of the newest approaches by Beekman (2000) indicates however that it is in fact possible to design a 
bulk test method, which is independent of granule properties. Other interactions between the tested 
granules can result in complex mechanical effects leading to unsystematic breakage phenomena. The 
building up of static charge e.g. has been known to influence to reproducibility of results from bulk tests 
(Beekman, 2000). 
Bulk particle tests often give statistically reproducible results but are more empirical in nature (Beekman, 
2000). A bulk test is sometimes sufficient for quality control purposes and to provide data that is useful 
for direct applications in the industry, but a specific strength value usually cannot be interpreted and used 
to develop a better process or product. Neither do bulk tests usually reveal the basic failure mechanisms 
(Salman et al., 2004). This is due to the fact that bulk test often show large breakage variances and results 
difficult to generalise. In the case of product optimisation, the use of single particle tests is needed as 
well (Beekman et al., 2002). 
4.6.2	
Single particle test methods
Any single particle test method aims to first subject the particle to a controlled but variable stress and 
then to determine the damage caused. Modern single particle methods are categorised on the basis of 
the stress mechanisms e.g. normal, tangential, compression or impact. The single particle tests measure 
each particle individually and only by testing a number of particles, statistically predictions of a whole 
sample can be made (Beekman et al., 2002 & 2003).

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
In general, most single particle breakage tests exert the stress on the particle either by compression or 
by impact. In a single-particle crushing test a single granule is compressed between two hard platens 
and the stress-strain behaviour is recorded until fracture. The compression test measures the applied 
stress directly. In an impact test a granule is accelerated to a certain velocity and smashed into a rigid 
target. An impact test does not usually record the force that causes failure but rather indicates the chance 
that breakage will occur at the given velocity (Beekman et al., 2002). Although not as accurate as the 
compression test there are two major advantages of the impact test. Firstly, the granule is not necessarily 
destructed completely by the impact. This is an advantage when surface damage is to be analysed. Secondly, 
there is only one point of contact meaning that crack propagation only will origin from one position on 
the granule surface. In repeated impact tests the same granule is exposed to a well-defined number of 
impacts. It is thereby possible to investigate fatigue and erosion phenomena closely (Beekman et al., 2003). 
Impact and compression tests are complementary. The major difference between impact and compression 
tests is that the rate of strain is inevitably high during impact but can be controlled during compression. 
The impact test determines attrition better and the compression test determines fracture better. The 
impact test is often more convenient to use than compression tests (Beekman et al., 2003).

Mechanical properties of granules and coating 
layer – strength and breakage mechanisms
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
The primary disadvantage with single-particle test is that granules in practice never exist as isolated entities 
but rather in bulks. Results from bulk tests show clearly that interparticle interactions are likely to have a 
large effect on granule breakage types and rates. It is only through single particle studies however, that a 
mechanistic understanding of granule breakage can be achieved (Salman et al., 2003 and Beekman, 2000). 
4.7	
Summing up on granule strength 
The diversity of the reported trends and approaches presented in the previous sections imply that the 
mechanical strength of particles and especially coated granules is a fairly unexplored area and that 
quantitative descriptions and predictions lie far ahead. Nevertheless, the identity between several of the 
reported trends should help to demonstrate that qualitative predictions of granule breakage are possible 
to a limited extent. Some of the most important properties and parameters concerning granule strength 
and breakage are summed up in table 5: 
Parameter
Qualitative description
Hardness (H)
Although not unambiguously determined, it seems that the higher the value 
of H, the more severe the type of breakage mechanism. A hard granule is often 
brittle and less resistant to crack propagation (Ghadiri & Zhang, 2002 and 
Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Fracture toughness (Kc)
A high value of Kc will hinder crack propagation and reduce the amount of the 
fractional volume removed per impact (Ghadiri & Zhang, 2002).
Mean granule porosity (
g
 )
and density (rg)
The suggested formulas indicate that the smaller the density the less material 
is removed per impact. A correlation with porosity however cannot be made 
directly because highly porous granules often destruct by an all or nothing 
fracture mechanism. Granules with high porosity are generally weak and fragile. 
(Bika et al., 2001 and Iveson et al., 2001a). 
Size of the process zone
The larger the process zone is compared to the granule diameter, the less 
severe is the type of breakage mechanism (Bika et al., 2001 and Guignon 
et al., 2002). 
Granule diameter (dg)
Although not fully agreement among the authors, there are indications that the 
extent of attrition is lowered as the granule diameter decrease (Guignon et al., 
2002 and Beekman et al., 2002). 
Granule surface 
The more uniform the granule surface is, the less severe is the amount and type 
of breakage (Guignon et al., 2002).
Impact velocity (n)
There is general agreement that the higher the impact velocity the more 
severe is the type of breakage mechanism (e.g Subero et al., 1999 and Mishra & 
Thornton, 2001).
Impact angle and impact material
The smaller the impact angle and the softer and thinner the target material is, 
the less severe will the type of damage be (Salman et al., 2002 & 2004)
Influence of coating layer
The coating layer can enhance the breakage resistance of the whole granule 
depending on the coating material and amount and type of coating solution 
additives (Liu et al., 2003, Beekman et al., 2003 and Jørgensen et al., 2004).

Summary
5	 Summary
Besides providing an overall introduction to fluid bed processing and parameters, the text gives a 
comprehensive presentation of agglomeration and fluid bed coating theory and principles regarding 
strength and breakage mechanisms of granules. Focus is brought onto theoretical considerations and 
models as well as practice and experience presented in the scientific literature. Selected results from some 
of the newest articles are cited in order to give an up-to-date presentation of the fluid bed granulation field. 
The variety of parameters influencing the granules makes fluid bed granulation seem somewhat chaotic. 
The situation is complicated not just by the variety of influencing parameters but also because many of 
the parameters are interlinked and influence each other. The text does however indicate that it is possible 
to give rough qualitative indications of the effect of some of the main parameters governing coating/
agglomeration and granule coating strength. A summary of these trends and tendencies are presented 
in the text in three main tables concerning respectively: Parameters important for agglomeration, key 
parameters governing the coating process and product and last, important properties and parameters 
concerning granule strength. These tables may function as rough initial guidelines for an operating 
window, where successful coating of granules leads to unagglomerated granules with high mechanical 
strength. The validation of these guidelines seems nevertheless to be highly dependent on verification 
by systematic experimental results. 
Interestingly, it was seen from the study of modern scientific articles that fluid bed agglomeration and 
coating still is a widely unexplored field and to some extent still more of an empirical-based technology 
rather than science. Many experiments and attempts have been conducted in order to explain some of the 
phenomena taking place in a fluid bed during coating/agglomeration, but no single model contains all the 
parameters needed for a full description. In addition, it was seen that yet no model or single parameter 
makes it possible to predict whether or not excessive agglomeration will occur during the coating process. 
Nor is it possible to precisely predict the mechanical strength of coated granules based on initial process 
and formulation parameters. Both issues are highly relevant subjects in the process of improving the 
mechanical strength of granules while at the same time reduce the tendency of agglomeration during 
processing. Such models may further help to verify and explain some of the various fluid bed product 
and process tendencies emphasised in the present text.

Appendix A1: Derivation of the equation 2.5
Appendix A1: Derivation of the 
equation 2.5
Based on: Denesuk et al. (1993 & 1994), Iveson & Franks (2003), Rumpf (1990), Hansen (1999), Teipel 
& Mikonsaari, 2004 and Hapgood et al. (2002).
Consider the three phases present when a liquid droplet is in contact with a porous media as indicated 
in figure A1:
Figure A1: Droplet-Solid phase-vapour interface. 
The three interfaces present when a liquid droplet is in contact with a porous solid media  
(Based on Teipel & Mikonsaari, 2004 and Denesuk et al., 1993).
As long as the gsl is smaller than gsv, surface energy considerations will favour the replacement of solid-
vapour interfaces by solid-liquid interfaces and liquid will be drawn into the pores at a rate determined 
by the pore geometry, surface energies and the viscosity of the liquid. 
The interfacial interactions constitute a pore liquid penetration pressure DP that can be expressed in 
terms of the partial change in free energy for a given volume of liquid taken into a pore:

Appendix A1: Derivation of the equation 2.5
Equation A.3 is the Young-Laplace equation describing the capillary pressure driving force. 
Neglecting any droplet curvature as well as gravitationally38 induced pressure, one may take the above 
pressure relation in equation A.3 to constitute the total pressure difference driving the advance of the 
liquid and use the Hagen-Poiseuille law to obtain the rate of droplet advance. This will be shown below. 
The Hagen-Poiseuille equation describes the viscous resistance to laminar flow and is given by:

(A.6)
This solution thereby expresses the depth of liquid penetration into a given pore as function of time.
Assuming radial symmetry of the liquid and of the porosity parameters, a differential volume of liquid 
drawn into the pores dVp can be expressed as the product of the differential volume of liquid in a single 
pore (given as pRpore
2dhp) and the differential number of pores in a thin annulus of the porous substrate 
between r and r + dr (given as rpore2prdr):

Equation A.8 can be integrated to give the total volume of liquid drawn into the porous solid. Hence the

t´ = t and from r = 0 to r = rf, where rf is the radius of the footprint of the droplet on the porous surface:

Appendix A1: Derivation of the equation 2.5
Besides the volume of liquid in the porous solid, there is a volume of liquid present at the porous media 
surface Vs which may be expressed as a function of an apparent surface contact radius39 rapp(t) and the 
contact angle q between the porous media and the wetting liquid. Hence the total droplet volume may 
at a given time be expressed as:
(t)
V
(t)
V


(A.10)
By further manipulation it is possible to obtain a general complex equation describing how the apparent 
radius rapp varies as a function of Vd, Rpore, q, rf and time. This relationship is a pseudo indication of the 
drop penetration time but the equation cannot easily be solved because of the difficulty of determining 
how the droplet footprint on the porous media surface rf varies as a function of time.
It has however been observed that during imbibition, droplets often have a constant drawing area (CDA) 
meaning that the three-phase contact line remains stationary. Hence the droplet radius is constant during 
drainage (and rf may be considered constant and equal to the droplet radius rd), whereas the contact 
angle slowly decreases as the liquid drains from the droplet into the porous surface. The principle can 
be seen in figure A2.

Appendix A2: From equation 2.5 to

Based on: Hapgood et al. (2002) and Denesuk et al. (1993).
Although not obvious at first, the Hapgood equation 4.7 describing the droplet penetration time td is 
basically the Denesuk equation 4.5 in a different form. The main differences between the two equations 
are the expressions describing the pore radiuses (Rpore and Reff) and the porosities (epmsp and eeff). It will 
be shown below how the Hapgood equation is derived from the Denesuk equation. Beginning with the

Appendix A4: Derivation of the Stokes viscous number

Fluid Bed Particle Processing
Appendix A4: Derivation of the 
Stokes viscous number and the 
Stokes critical viscous number
Based on: Ennis et al. (1991), Tardos et al. (1997) and Wedel, (2005).
Consider two individual spherical granules with masses and radiuses m1, r1 and m2, r2 respectively, as 
indicated in figure A3:
Figure A3: Colliding granules.  
Schematic of two colliding granules each of which is covered by a viscous binder layer of thickness h  
(Based on Ennis et al., 1991).
Assuming that the two granules are approaching one another at an initial relative velocity of 2u0 and 
that each are covered with a binder layer thickness h. As the individual binder layers come into contact a 
dynamic pendular bridge will form between the colliding granules now separated by a gap of distance 2h. 
For sufficiently large binder viscosity, the bridge will dissipate the relative kinetic energy of the colliding 
granules preventing rebound. To determine the minimum velocity required for particle rebound, a force 
balance on an individual granule can be considered. Ignoring the effect of capillary forces and assuming 
creep flow between the two granules, the force balance equation of motion (Newton’s second law) for 
the approach stage can be expressed as:

Appendix A4: Derivation of the Stokes viscous number 
and the Stokes critical viscous number
Fluid Bed Particle Processing
For rebound of the colliding granules to occur, the Stokes number must exceed a critical value of Stv
*. 
With the initial velocity of u0, let the velocity of the colliding granule upon reaching a distance of ha be 
ua, where ha represents a characteristic length scale of surface asperities. The initial rebound velocity is 
then e×ua where e is the particle coefficient of restitution with the presence of binder layer. Realising 
that the granule velocity u is a scalar velocity and thereby a sign-depend parameter42, the situation of 
the two granules colliding and afterwards rebounding can be split up into two situations analogously 
to equation A.22:

Appendix A5: Derivation of 
equation 3.1 describing the 
coating thickness 
Based on: Depypere (2005) and Dewettinck et al. (1999a).
Although equation 5.1 seems somewhat confusing at first, it is basically nothing more than a calculation 
of what the coating thickness zc theoretically would be if a known mass of coating mdep were added to 
a known mass of core particles mcore, assuming hereby that all the core particles have equal diameters 
dcore and that the core particles as well as the coated particles are spherical. First the mass of a coating 
as well as the mass of a core particle in terms of density and volume are expressed as:

Appendix A6: Derivation of equation 3.4
Appendix A6: Derivation of 
equation 3.4
Based on: Kunii & Levenspiel (1991), Rowe (1972) and Link & Schlünder (1997).
It has been well proven among different authors that gas bubbles in fluidised beds causes an upward drift 
of particles along its vertical path and also carries particles upwards in a captive wake. Examinations by 
Rowe (1972) indicate that the upward drift is a roughly conical shape with a volume of approximately 
0.35 times the gas bubble volume Vb, whereas the wake volume is approximately 0.25 times the bubble 
volume. Hence, each gas bubble displaces upwards a total volume of particles of approximately 0.6 . Vb. 
Figure A4 illustrates the different volumes as well as the different types of motion occurring during the 
rise of a bubble.
Figure A4: Model of particle movement due to the rise of a bubble in a bubbling fluidised bed.  
Notice how part of the particles are moved by the wake and another part by the bubble itself 
(Based on Rowe, 1972).

1.	
The sphericity is defined as the surface of a sphere divided by the surface of an irregular particle both 
having the same volume (Kunii & Levenspiel, 1991).
2.	
The excess gas velocity Ue is the part of the gas above minimum fluidisation that is not necessary for 
fluidisation. Ideally it is defined as the given fluidisation velocity U minus Umf. In practice an adjustment 
for the volume fraction of the bed occupied by gas bubbles has to be made (Schaafsma, 2000b). 
3.	
The list is expanded and further specifications are made in coming sections.
4.	
This second set of the granulation process is sometimes referred to as “Consolidation and Growth” (e.g. 
Iveson et al., 2001b) or ”Growth and Compaction” (e.g. Pietsch, 1991). 
5.	
This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as “Drop pooling” (Iveson et al., 2001a).
6.	
Sometimes referred to as the “Wetting zone” or “Nucleation zone” (Schaafsma et al., 1999).
7.	
Even though this theory is developed for a plane solid surface there is a complete analogy to the wetting 
of spherical particles (Marmur et al., 1992).
8.	
The contact angle depends on the composition of the binder solution and the physical properties of 
the powder particle, especially roughness, porosity and affinity for the binder solution (Guignon et al., 
2002). Contact angles of powder particles are generally determined by either Goniometry or Wilhelmy 
tensiometry. In both principles the particles are compressed to produce a flat surface before being wet by 
a drop and determination of the resulting contact angle (Marmur et al., 1992).
9.	
The work of adhesion WA is the work required to separate an interface into two separate surfaces 
(Kontogeorgis, 2004).
10.	
The work of cohesion WC is the work required to separate a unit cross-sectional area of a material from 
itself. For a solid WCS = 2lsv and for a liquid WCL = 2llv (Iveson et al., 2001a).
11.	
The droplet penetration time is defined as the time it takes for the liquid droplet to penetrate completely 
into the porous substrate with no liquid remaining on the surface. Besides the “droplet penetration time” 
it is often referred to as the “time of depletion” (Denesuk et al., 1994) or “Wicking time” (Hapgood 
et al., 2002).
12.	
It is considered a semi-static configuration in the sense that it changes very little on a time scale comparable 
to the depletion time (Denesuk et al., 1994). 
13.	
Please refer to appendix A1 to see the formal derivation of equation 2.5.
14.	
Please refer to appendix A2 to see the how the Hapgood formula is obtained from the Denesuk formula. 
15.	
The droplet size has a negligible effect on nuclei size in other types of high agitation granulation equipment. 
In high shear mixers e.g., the granule product size appears almost independent of the binder droplet size, 
as the intensive shear forces crush the initial flocks and agglomerates formed during the nucleation stage 
(Iveson et al., 2001a).
16.	
The nucleus diameter obviously cannot be measured during processing. Instead particle samples are 
taken from the fluid bed at different early stages of the spray process. The sample thereby contains nuclei 
rather than final agglomerated granules. Size measurements of these samples will thereby give the nucleus 
diameter (Waldie, 1991 and Iveson et al., 2001a).

It may be circular, flat or annular depending on the nozzle type, nozzle position and spray angle (Iveson 
et al., 2001a).
18.	
Please refer to appendix A3 to see the derivation of equation 2.12.
19.	
The time it takes for a particle to circulate a complete wetting-drying cycle. It depends primarily on the 
fluidisation velocity and bed height (Link & Schlünder, 1997), as it will be presented in section 3.4. 
20.	
The porosity of fluid bed granules varies typically between 0.4–0.5 whereas granules made in high shear 
or drum mixers have porosities in the range of 0.2 to 0.3 (Schaafsma et al., 2000a).
21.	
High porosities are often correlated with weak and friable granules (Schaafsma et al., 1998). 
22.	
The coefficient of restitution is the ratio of the difference in velocity before and after the collision. In the 
case of two colliding particles it is the difference in the velocities of the two colliding particles after the 
collision divided by the difference in their velocity prior to collision. Perfect elastic collisions has e = 1 
(Christensen et al., 2000). The coefficient of restitution e thereby accounts for the viscous dissipation in 
the binder phase being sufficient to dissipate the energy of collision (Liu et al., 2000).
23.	
Please refer to appendix A4 to see the derivation of equation 2.13 and equation 2.14.
24.	
The difficulty of determining a uniform value of e for granules means that precise values of Stv
* has to be 
determined experimentally or by numerical integration (Tardos et al., 1997).
25.	
For instance that there exists a uniform granule collision velocity or that in coalescence, capillary forces 
can be neglected (Ennis et al., 1991). Especially the difficulty of determining a precise collision velocity 
u0 makes the viscous Stokes theory difficult to exploit fully in practice (Abbott, 2002).
26.	
The original Hounslow model is hereby made a special case where q = 1 (Cryer, 1999).
27.	
Please refer to appendix A5 to see the derivation of equation 3.1.
28.	
e.g. energy efficiency, quality efficiency, evaporation efficiency or productivity efficiency etc. 
29.	
The order of salting-out power is generally known as the Hofmeister series. It governs many colloidal 
phenomena including the viscosity of hydrosols such as polymers in salt solutions. The salting-out power 
increases from the left to the right in the following series for anions bounded with the same cation: 
citrate3- > SO4
2- > acetate- > Cl- > Br- > I- > SCN-. The smaller the cation associated with the given anion 
in the series, the larger the salting-out effect (Goodwin, 2004 and Nakano et al., 1999).
30.	
Please refer to appendix A6 to see the derivation of equation 3.4
31.	
Often referred to as the “modulus of elasticity” (Callister, 2001).
32.	
In an indentation test a conical diamond point is indented into the material with a known maximum 
applied force F. After that, the length of radial cracks c is measured versus F. This test can be used on real 
granules down to 50 mm to determine several strength parameters (Iveson et al., 2001a and Jørgensen, 
2002).
33.	
In some articles referred to as the “Damage zone” or “Yielding zone” (Bika et al., 2001).
34.	
Actually the term “fracture” is the overall term for “chipping” as well as “fragmentation”, but almost all 
authors mix fragmentation and fracture or use the terms as synonyms. 
35.	
Chipping is sometimes also used as a general term for small fracture damage even when the applied force 
is not tangential (Jørgensen et al., 2004).

The proportionality is derived on the basis of various observed proportionalities gained from experimental 
studies. Although derived on the basis of indentation tests on cubes of uniform material, the relation has 
proven well when compared to granule data (Iveson et al., 2001a and Beekman et al., 2002).

Notes
38.	
The neglect of gravity may seem wrong at first, but Denesuk et al. (1993) have made rough estimations 
of the effect and concluded that the neglect of gravity should be valid for essentially all porous media.
39.	
This radius is the contact radius associated with the spherical droplet cap (please refer to figure A1). It 
decreases as the droplet is drained into the porous media but not linearly.
40.	
An assumption analogue to the assumption of rf = rd stated in the derivation of td in appendix A1.
41.	
Often approximated by the product of the powder velocity past the spray in m/s and the width of the powder 
being wet in m. Both are apparatus/process dependent parameters that can be found experimentally.
