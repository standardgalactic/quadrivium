Cleaning Up After Docker

Cleaning Up After Docker
• With Development Use Docker can leave behind a lot of ﬁles. 
• These ﬁles will grow and consume a lot of disk space. 
• This is less of an issue on production systems where containers aren’t 
being built and restarted all the time. 
• There are 3 key areas of house keeping: 
• Containers 
• Images 
• Volumes 

Containers

Cleaning Up Containers
• Kill all Running Docker Containers 
• docker kill $(docker ps -q)
• Delete all Stopped Docker Containers 
• docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

Images

Cleaning Up Images
• Remove a Docker Image 
• docker rmi <image name>
• Delete Untagged (dangling) Images 
• docker rmi $(docker images -q -f dangling=true)
• Delete All Images 
• docker rmi $(docker images -q) 

Volumes

Cleaning Up Volumes
• Once a volume is no longer associated with a container, it is 
considered ‘dangling’. 
• Remove all dangling volumes 
• docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -f 
dangling=true -q)
• NOTE: Does not remove ﬁles from host system in shared volumes.
