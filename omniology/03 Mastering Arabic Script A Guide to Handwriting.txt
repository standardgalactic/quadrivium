Introduction 
The history of the Arabic script 
The Arabic alphabet and written language has remained 
remarkably constant since the sixth or seventh century AD, 
largely due to the unifying factor of the Qur'an. There is no 
clear documented progression in the development of the script 
before this time and only a limited number of original pre-
Islamic Arabic texts exist, sometimes as scraps of stone or 
parchment. 
Arabic is a Semitic language related to Aramaic and Hebrew. 
The language has its roots in the nomadic oral tradition of the 
desert, which largely explains the lack of early examples of the 
Script. 
Although spoken Arabic dialects have diverged in the same 
way that Romance languages such as Italian and French have 
diverged from Latin, the Modem Standard Arabic of today's 
media is close to the language of the Qur'an and Classical 
literature. The spelling and grammar have not changed 
significantly over the centuries. 
Different styles of writing 
Arabic calligraphy is a highly respected art form with hundreds 
of different styles. Many of these calligraphic styles a re very 
ornate and intended more for decoration than comprehension. 
The calligrapher relies on the reader already knowing the text, 
often a verse from the Qur'an, and can concentrate on making 
the sCript as beautiful and balanced as possible. 
As for as everyday written Arabic is concerned, there are two 
significant styles: naskh, the basic script used for most printed 
material; and ruq'a, the script used for most handwritten 
material. Although it is possible to typeset ruq'a or handwrite

Introduction 
An example of highly decorative calligraphy showing text from the 
Qur'an (Professor Mohammed Hamaam, Head of the Academy of 
Arabic Script, Cairo) 
naskh, this does not huppen commonly. 
Most Arab children will initially learn to read and write naskh 
in a similar way to English children learning to read and write 
using infant letters. At about 11 or 12 years old, secondary 
school students in the Arab world will graduate to writing ruq'a, 
which is an eagerly anticipated step and a sign of having 
joined the 'adult' club. 
Ruq'a is a more flowing script than naskh and designed for 
speed and efficiency. Good handwriting is much admired as an 
Introduction 
extension of the respect paid to calligraphy. As a learner you 
will find a mastery of the ruq'a script will help you to be 
regarded as a serious student of the language, as well as being 
a more efficient way of handwriting. 
vii 
This book sets out to compare and contrast naskh and ruq'a 
and to teach you a fluid and mature ruq'a writing style, using 
models produced by one of the leading experts on handwriting 
in the Arab world and providing extensive practice material. 
There are obvious similarities between naskh and ruq'a, but 
there are also some important differences to be mastered when 
writing ruq'a. For example, ruq'a script largely floats above the 
line whereas elements of naskh fall below the line. Also, many 
of the fiddlier and more time-consuming elements of naskh are 
rationalised in ruq'a for the sake of speed. For example the 
separate dots above and below the main script are joined 
together.

Introduction 
How to use this book 
This script book can be beneficial at different stages of the 
learning process. It can be used by complete beginners who 
wish to master the ruq'a script simultaneously with the printed 
naskh, supplementing the early stages of study of the Arabic 
language, whether in a classroom or home setting. Beginners 
often find the script quite easy to master in principle but still 
find it tokes a long time to become fluent in reading and 
writing. This book can help you overcome the script barrier 
much more quickly. 
Alternatively, you may have already studied Arabic and be 
proficient in reading naskh. But you may not yet have had the 
opportunity to improve your own writing or to decipher the 
handwriting of native speakers. This book can take you to the 
next level by concentrating on making your Arabic 
handwriting more mature and fluent. 
At whatever stage you approach this book, it is best to work 
your way through the units methodically. There are three main 
parts to the book. The first part covers how to form and join 
individual letter shapes; the second covers special combinations 
of letters; and the third part is an activity section for further 
practice. Features included are: 
• clear explanation and graphics showing how the letter 
shapes are formed 
• numerous practice exercises to help you achieve fluency in 
writing 
• Master calligrapher tips: expert hints on writing in ruq'a from 
Professor Mohammed Hamaam, head of the Academy of 
Arabic Script in Cairo. Follow the instructions in this guide 
and you will have good ruq'a handwriting. Follow Professor 
Hamaam's tips and you will have even better ruq'a writing! 
• 'extra' sections covering features of the Arabic script such as 
writing vowels and hamza ( .. ) 
• photos and illustrations showing the script in context 
• Write on!: additional stimulating and useful activities to 
improve recognition and fluency of writing. 
Introduction 
Basic principles of Arabic script 
There are a few basic principles of Arabic script which apply 
whichever style of writing is used: 
• There ore 28 letters in the alphabet. 
• The sCript is written right to left. 
• There are no capital letters. 
• Words are written in cursive, or 'joined up', writing. All letters 
join to the letter before in a word and all but six join to the 
letter after also. 
Once you have mastered the various forms of each letter shape 
in both naskll and ruq'a you will find you can write and read 
Arabic in most everyday contexts. 
Finally, make sure you have a good ink pen, drawing pen, 
gel pen or a soft pencil to write Arabic. The Arabic sCript usually 
looks better when written with a thicker nib or tip. Arabic is a 
flowing script and it is difficult to achieve a good hand with a 
cheap biro.

For the first few units of Part I, you will be practising how to 
write individual Arabic shapes and letters. When you have 
mastered enough letters, we will introduce complete words to 
recognise and copy. 
Practise forming the letter shape above, first by tracing the 
shape and then by copying what you see. Pay special attention 
to where you start the shape.

The shape of the initial ba', ta' and tha' is one of the most 
important in Arabic writing. The stroke is fundamental to 
handwriting and forms the basis of a number of Arabic letter 
shapes. Pay attention to the starting and finishing positions.

This letter shape can be joined together in different 
combinations. Compare the printed and handwritten

Notice that the 'dots' over or under the script may move 
around in handwriting, sometimes ending up to the left of 
where they should be (see the dots on ~I above). This 
movement happens because the dots are added after the main 
word has been completed and is comparable to what happens 
in English handwriting when you might find the cross stroke of 
a 't' has moved to the right.

~- extrCl 
"'. ,. 
I Vowel and doubling signs 
I Most modem Arabic is written without short vowels, in a 
similar way to the language of mobile text messages ('en u 
em tdy?'). So a word such as ~ 
bint (girl) is actually written 
as bnt and ~ 
bayt (house) as byt. 
It is possible to add signs above and below the main script 
showing the short vowels, and these are sometimes included 
for clarity or in material aimed at learners, as well as being a 
feature of classical and religious texts. 
The vowel signs are: 
~fat~a 
~9amma 
b~ kasra 
a dash above, pronounced as a short 'a' 
after the letter, for example ... ~ ba 
a comma-shape above, pronounced as a 
short 'u' after the letter, for example ... ~ bu 
a dash below, pronounced as a short'i' 
after the letter, for example ... -' bi 
-. 
There ure also two additional signs: 
~sukon 
-
';J!. shadda 
a small circle above sho:ving that no vowel 
follows the letter, e.g. ~ 
bint (girl) 
a small 'w' shape above showing that the 
" 
letter is doubled, e.g. ~ bunn (coffee beans) 
Don't confuse these signs with the dots above and below 
letters. The dots are an integral part of the script, 
distinguishing one letter from another. The vowels and 
doubling signs are a discretionary feature. 
------_. 
extra: vowel and doubling signs 
Practise writing the signs, following the direction of the arrow, 
and making sure you move your pen from right to left. Only

Now practise tracing and copying these words with the vowel

The letter alit is the first letter of the Arabic alphabet and one of

alit does not represent a single consistent sound. It has two 
functions: 
• as a 'carrier' for one of the short vowels (a, U, i), usually at 
the beginning of a word 
• to indicate a long a vowel. 
Joining up 
Most Arabic letters join to the letters either side of them in a 
word. aljf is one of six Arabic letters that only join to the letter 
before (on its right). This effectively means that the alif retains its 
shape wherever it falls in a word, with just a small joining

c) -J 
The letter following an alif (to the left) must be written in the 
initial form, or in the isolated form if it is the only remaining 
letter in the word. 
An alit at the beginning of a word is usually written with a 
hamza symbol (~) over it if the vowel is a or ll, or under it if the 
vowel is i: 
I 
a or u: I

Complete the whole word before adding the hamza (see extra

Long vowels 
You have met the short vowel marks on pages 14- 15. These 
marks are written above and below the main script and aTe 
I discretionary. 
, 
However, if a vowel is long, for example a long 0 as in 
I 'bQ.Qt', this requires an additional letter to be added to the 
I word: 
long a (as in '(gther') I alif added after the letter: ~ ba

long 0 (as in 'bQQt') 
long T (as in 'm~t') 
,J waw added after the letter: Yo bo

extra: hamzD 
The Arabic hamza ( ... ) is sometimes described as a 'half-letter'. 
It represents the short intake of breath that an English 
speaker would naturally make before a word starting with a 
vowel (e.g. 'instant', 'egg'). In Arabic script, the hamza is 
usually written together with an alif when a word starts with 
a vowel: above the alif if the vowel is a/aa or ufu and below if 
the vowel is iii:

The letter ..!l kaf does not shore its shape with any other letter. 
Compare the usual printed and handwritten forms. Notice how 
the handwritten version usually joins the hamza shape in the

Unit 14 
When writing words containing initial or medial keUs you 
should write the lower part of the letter, but leave the upper 
slanted stroke as an addition to be completed when you have 
finished the whole shape of the word, along with any dots on 
other letters:

General principles 
Working your way through Part 1 of this book, you have 
already encountered some of the general prindples involved in 
handwriting Arabic. Here Is a summary of the moin points you 
have met: 
• Double and treble dots above and below letters become 
dashes and 'caps': ,. _ . 
• The 'w' shape at the beginning of Sin U'" and shTn J.. 
generally becomes a smooth line: tJ"". ' 
• Some final letters have alternative final forms, e.g. 
CJ / N
, C>- / N'4 ,and ,JP / ",P . 
• Each group of letters needs to end with the final character in 
the correct position on the line - the height of preceding 
letters should be adjusted to achieve this. 
• In addition, some spedal shapes have developed to join 
particular combinations of letters. 
Implementing all of these principles requires practice and time. 
You will start by only recognising some of the more complicated 
combinations. However, the more you can apply the principles, 
the more your handwriting will resemble that of a native 
Arabic speaker, and so the more credibility you will acquire. 
You need to imagine how you would regard a foreigner who 
writes you an English note in printed infant letters as opposed 
to a fully formed adult hand. 
Final letters 
In this unit we will look as a whole at final letters and how they 
affect the letters that come before. The 'final letter' could be the 
last letter in a word or it could be a non-joining letter, making it 
the lost letter in a combination. 
I 
Unit 17 
Some final letters are written along the line and there is no 
special odjustment needed to the letter(s) that come before: 
, 
-ut-- = ...j + '":-' 
-~- = .!l + ...j + f' 
-~ - = I + 'f + ~ 
77 
But others are joined higher to allow the final tail to fall in the 
correct position: 
~ - = J + '":-' 
-~ - = J +...j 
.L? __ =.) + ~ 
Compare the position of the initial ba' ~ in ~ and ~ 
above. 
When joining to ta' ~ you can start the ba' on the line, but 
when joining to qat J you should raise the ba' In antidpation, 
so that the deeper tail of the qat falls back on the line. The 
ability to antidpate is one of the features of good Arabic 
handwriting. 
Here are the final letters like qat that are joined to above the line: 
-t.-. 
" ~-" 6 '

Units 18-20 will cover joining to t / c./ r;:, t" and ~ . In this 
unit we will practise the other final letters.

In Unit 7 you saw how the initial letter shope...::o. joins to 
following letters. This shape is shared by the letters ~ jim, ( hol'

In this unit we will look in more detail at the medial and final 
shapes for these letters.

You can see that the medial and final letter shapes are joined to 
the letter before with a diagonal right-ta-Ieft stroke joining at 
the top left-hand side of the main letter. This requires 
anticipation when joining . 
Practise tracing and copying the medial and final shapes, 
taking care to start where indicated by the arrow:

The letter mTm f" is one of the trickiest letters to master. You 
have already seen in Unit 9 that when it loses its tail it is 
reduced to a small circle or blob: 
mirn in isolation: __ .(
_ 
initial mrm:

In addition, when mTm is in the medial or final position, with a 
letter following it, it tends to become tucked under the letter in

Joining to final tJ 
In Unit 3 you saw how the initial ~ shape combines with a 
final ya' to produce this shape: tJ'. 
Other letters combine with the final ya' in a similar way. Look at 
how the final ya' combines with these ten initial letter shapes:

on its 
left), In addition, don't forget to add any dots and the 
downwards stroke of the .b and ..s: after you have completed the 
whole of the moin shape. 
Try tracing and then copying those shapes. Start at the black dot.
