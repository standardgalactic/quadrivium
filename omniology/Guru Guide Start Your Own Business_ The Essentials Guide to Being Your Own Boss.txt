Welcome!
…to the only guide you need to get grounded, 
confident and ready to start your business
The world of business is 
progressively looking more 
attractive as we gradually claw 
our way out of recession and 
enter what will hopefully be 
more fruitful times for small-
time entrepreneurs. Governments 
on both sides of the Atlantic are 
becoming more supportive of private enterprise, and 
the public at large – most importantly – is finally 
getting up the confidence to open its wallet and 
enjoy things again. 
What does this mean for you? Well, there’s the 
obvious – that it’s finally the right time to turn that 
idea into a proper business – and the not so obvious 
too. Venture capitalists and angel investors may be 
more willing to take a punt. Worldwide platforms like  
Kickstarter are going great guns, allowing those 
with money to invest to choose from potential 
platforms around the world. Your public can be 
drawn in to your product or service before it even 
exists, help you get started, and give you a faithful 
user base right from the start.
So let’s get started on that journey. We’ve filled 
this Guru Guide with everything you’ll need to get 
your feet wet in the business world, and the only 
thing we can’t offer is specific advice on setting up 
your specific niche business. Actually, scratch that, 
we can: you should do it, you can do it, and we really 
hope you enjoy doing it.
Guru Guides are designed to help 
experienced technology users dive 
deeper into a subject. Whether you’re 
learning a new programming language 
or planning to start a new business, each 
book aspires to be…
Ȼ A reference you can keep on your desk or 
next to your computer and consult time and 
time again when you need to know how to 
do something or solve a problem 
Ȼ A teacher – helping you develop your skills 
and take with you through your life, applying 
them at home or even in the workplace
Ȼ A challenge – we know that you know 
the basics so instead of patronising you we’ll 
suggest new things to try and help you take 
your knowledge to the next level
Ȼ Available anywhere – you can take  
your Guru Guide everywhere thanks  
to the free digital edition you can  
download and read on your tablet, 
smartphone or laptop – see page 178 for 
more details

Business 
basics
Starting a business has 
become something anybody 
can do. In today’s changeable 
economy, being a small 
business owner is no longer 
the preserve of the risk-taker. 
All you need to start your  
own enterprise is a great  
idea and the nous to see it 
through. And maybe some 
cash. And good contacts.  
And a business plan. Oh,  
and a marketing strategy…
You’ve got a great idea. But you need more than that to build a business.  
Read on to discover how to transform your concept into a solid enterprise

STARTING BLOCKS
Some of us are guilty of 
having serial epiphanies  
and mentally retiring for the 
next 20 years before we’ve 
actually done anything about 
it. But before you throw 
everything at your wonderful 
idea, it’s crucial to do some 
research. Sometimes you can 
get so excited about the dream 
that you lose all objectivity. 
The best way to stay 
productive is to be really  
clear about what you want to 
achieve, and put something 
into action immediately. 
Clarify your goals as soon as 
you can in order to get your 
mind focused. Put your idea 
down on paper to make it 
more manageable. 
Then you need to question 
your idea as much as possible. 
Be ruthless. Do thorough 
research into the industry.  
If you don’t know the industry 
well, engage the services of 
someone who does, sharpish. 
A Google search for similar-
sounding products simply 
isn’t enough. Don’t fall into 
the trap of thinking that just 
because something’s not on 
the internet it doesn’t exist. 
Go to the trade associations, 
look in industry magazines, 
and attend trade shows. 
Zoom in and then zoom out. 
Make sure you see your idea 
from as many different angles 
as possible. What does your 
idea look like as an insider,  
a consumer, an employee,  
a competitor, a critic?  
How can you make it better?  
Then get a second opinion.
WRITING A BUSINESS PLAN
Your research into the market 
and your product should form 
the backbone of your business 
plan. If you haven’t got time 
to research and write your 
business plan, you haven’t  
got time to run a business. 
Not only does a business plan 
serve as a reference document 
for you, for investors and for 
future staff, it also helps you 
focus your mind and strategy. 
It enables you to see the 
figures written down, too.
If you simply don’t know 
where to start, you can 
download free templates from 
sites such as www.gov.uk. 
A good business plan 
comprises the following…
THE EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
Your executive summary is 
the first thing people read. 
Sometimes it’s the only bit 
they read. So it needs to be 
clear, precise and jargon-free. 
The summary will be read by 
potential investors, so it’s 
also important not to assume 
too much prior knowledge of 
the industry. The summary 
should feature the most 
important points of your 
business or product and 
should sum up the following: 
Ĩ#\rxu#vhuylfh#ru#surgxfw#dqg#
what its strengths are; 
Ĩ#Zkhuh#|rxu#rssruwxqlw|#lv# 
in the market; 
Ĩ#Zkr#|rxu#pdqdjhphqw#whdp#
is and how it’s structured; 
Ĩ#\rxu#wudfn#uhfrug#lq# 
business and what your 
experience in the field is;
Ĩ#Zkdw#|rxu#ilqdqfldo#
projections are;
Ĩ#Zkdw#|rxu#ixqglqj#
requirements are and what 
returns are expected. 
Funders will read this bit 
and often make provisional 
SOURCING  
AN OFFICE
When you’re looking for a workspace, be 
realistic about where you think you’ll be  
in five years’ time. Consult your business 
plan carefully and look at your projected 
growth. Will the space you choose be  
right for the business as you see it in five 
or ten years’ time? If not, will you be able 
to cope with the upheaval of a move if 
you’re expanding?
Always get a break clause built into 
your contract and push for a rent-free 
period. Never be afraid to negotiate to  
get the space on the terms you want.
Is the location right for the employees 
you have and the employees you want?  
Is it going to be a turn-off for the talent 
you hope to attract? What’s the public 
transport like? Is it safe? Will security cost 
more than anything you might save?
If you can, get a space near like-minded 
businesses. This could be good for your 
enterprise’s productivity, morale and 
general networking.

assumptions or decisions on 
your company’s viability.  
The rest of the business plan 
should be devoted to proving 
them right or wrong.
THE REST OF THE BUSINESS PLAN
The rest of the plan should 
comprise an extrapolation of 
each of the points above,  
and include a background to 
the idea, work carried out to 
date, experience, and the 
proposed ownership structure 
of the business. 
It is really important to 
cover any disadvantages or 
weak points you feel the 
business may have. Being 
honest about these inspires 
confidence. Explain key 
features of the industry,  
like applicable regulations, 
and effective cartels.
Explain the market 
segments you want to target 
(identify the size of each 
segment and the direction it’s 
heading in). Here, you should 
also put how many customers 
you have lined up and sales 
you’ve already made. Quote 
minimum order figures, if you 
can. You need to demonstrate 
how long you predict each sale 
or transaction will take.  
Also discuss the likelihood of 
repeat orders and how this 
works with volume. Include 
details of the contributions 
each part of your business  
will make. Identify where you 
expect to make your profits 
and where there might be 
scope to increase. 
The business plan is 
designed to attract investors, 
so remember to list the 
reasons buyers will come to 
you over your competitors.  
If you can’t do this, then you 
might want to think about 
your business idea again.  
You also need to include a bit 
“COVER ANY WEAK 
POINTS YOU FEEL THE 
BUSINESS MAY HAVE”

 Start your own business  |  15 
in your plan about how you 
expect to promote your 
product and what marketing 
plan you have in place.
Once you’ve finished your 
business plan, read it. Does it 
give you a comprehensive 
overview of your idea and 
business? Show it to a friend 
and ask them for comments.
USING PROTECTION
Once you are satisfied that 
your idea is a sound one,  
you need to protect it. There 
are many ways to protect a 
new business idea and the 
best approach for you will 
really depend on what you are 
doing. Some ideas can be 
protected by a patent, which 
is a form of intellectual 
property registration, for 
which it may be possible to 
apply where there is a new 
invention. This is most 
obviously true of physical 
products, although software 
can be patented, too, in some 
cases. Registration of a patent 
can give its owner exclusive 
rights for a long period, which 
can obviously be a great 
benefit. However, many good 
ideas do not involve an 
invention – for instance,  
a new method of doing 
something, which it may not 
be possible to protect under 
intellectual property law but 
DEMAND  
YOUR SUPPLY
Get your supply chain right and your 
business will run a lot more smoothly. 
Henry Freeman, commercial director at 
TradeRiver, an online provider of supply-
chain finance, says, “Being a cash buyer 
can help you to negotiate better rates with 
suppliers because they benefit from 
immediate cash-flow, the life blood of any 
business. Using this as leverage can save 
you hundreds or even thousands of pounds 
in purchasing and service costs. We have 
also found that, in the long term, 
relationships between companies using 
supply-chain finance are strengthened as 
suppliers like to sell to companies that can 
immediately settle their trades.”
Use local suppliers where you can. This 
isn’t only good for your green credentials, 
but it’s good for quality, too. Using smaller, 
local suppliers can mean they are 
passionate about their work and put in extra 
effort. It’s also always better to be able to 
meet and talk to your suppliers, and makes 
life easier if you have issues to iron out.
If you’re going to go further afield, 
consider the challenges of working 
overseas before choosing new suppliers in 
far-flung climes. Be sure to think carefully 
about shipping costs, timing issues, supply 
chain complexity and cultural differences, 
and make sure they don’t negate your 
labour costs.
If you are going overseas, make sure you 
keep up to date with localised supplier 
needs, rules and regulations, as well as 
global events, which could cause 
disruptions down the line. Gen up on all 
major festivals and holidays in the country 
you choose.

simply needs to be kept quiet 
in the development phase.  
In that case, the best course of 
action is to reveal the 
confidential aspects to as few 
people as possible, and to do 
so only where the other party 
is trusted and has signed a 
non-disclosure agreement 
(NDA) prepared by a lawyer. 
Tim Summers, partner at 
Temple Bright, says, “The 
first legal issue to consider is 
the fundamental one: could 
the business be entirely 
prevented, or else made 
impractical, by a requirement 
of the law?”
This is more likely to be a 
possibility in the context of 
business activities that are 
regulated, such as financial 
services. However, says 
Summers, “There may be laws 
you don’t know about in 
other, more general contexts, 
and these may need to be 
factored into your strategic 
planning. So it’s worth talking 
to a firm of solicitors early on, 
confidentially describing your 
plans and asking if there are 
any fundamental legal 
obstacles they can foresee.”
If there is nothing 
fundamental that requires you 
to rethink the business plan, 
the rest of the detail  
(for example, setting up the 
trading vehicle, terms and 
conditions, employment 
contracts) may be able to wait 
a while. However, if you have 
a name in mind for your 
business, you should ask an 
Image ©Thinkstock

intellectual property lawyer to 
run some checks and advise 
you whether it’s a problem if 
someone else is using a 
similar name. Summers says, 
“If the name is available for 
you to use, there are ways of 
securing it before you start 
trading – for instance, setting 
up a company, registering a 
trademark and buying a 
domain name.”
It’s natural for a start-up to 
have legal matters a little way 
down the list of priorities, but, 
says Summers, “Having legal 
matters such as the small 
print of your customer terms 
in pristine form on day one 
may seem like a counsel of 
perfection, particularly given 
that lawyers can be expensive 
and start-up funds are often 
limited, but the big two early 
stage oversights are, firstly,  
a poor or non-existent 
founders’ agreement,  
and secondly, not properly 
securing intellectual property 
used in the business – in 
“There may be laws you 
don’t know about, and 
these may need to be 
factored into your strategic 
planning. It’s worth talking 
to solicitors early on, 
confidentially describing 
your plans and discovering 
any fundamental legal 
obstacles they can foresee”
particular, that which is 
created for the business by 
other people.” 
When everyone is good 
friends at the start, it may 
seem that having a founders’ 
agreement (such as a 
partnership agreement or 
shareholders agreement)  
is unnecessary. But once you 
start building the business, 
you may find that this 
pressing and perhaps rather 
uncomfortable matter is 
deferred, so that by the time 

18  |   Start your own business
problems start to emerge 
among the founders, it is too 
late to agree a framework for 
resolving them.
As for intellectual property, 
it’s possible to have a false 
start with a name or logo 
because you have not done 
the checks for use by others 
or have not registered your 
own trademark. Where 
written text or designs have 
been created by others,  
it’s all too common for a 
young business to appoint 
creative contractors 
informally, without realising 
that ownership of intellectual 
property may remain with the 
creator rather than passing to 
the business – even when the 
business is paying for it. 
Should you take the chance? 
Says Summers, “Of course, 
entrepreneurship involves 
risk-taking. However, I’d 
make a distinction between 
the calculated commercial 
risks that are inherent to a 
new venture, and the kind of 
recklessness that could result 
in a good business being 
destroyed for avoidable 
causes. Not taking legal 
advice on important things 
early on is in the reckless 
category, and I hope most 
successful entrepreneurs 
would say the same.”
However, if you want to 
keep things friendly, it’s 
worth shopping around for a 
lawyer who can create legal 
documents which are short, 
user-friendly and attractive. 
Says Summers, “This is a 
much better course than 
relying on a combination of 
cut-and-pastes from the 
internet, items passed to you 
by friends and nothing at all.”
Instructing lawyers is in 
itself a potential minefield. 
It’s worth considering price 
(but don’t make it the only 
consideration). You should 
also consider quality and 
expertise, location and 
personal rapport, and you 
should talk to several firms 
before choosing one. The best 
indicators of quality and 
expertise will be the firm’s 
presentation and reputation, 
the testimonies of others who 
have used it for similar work, 
and its answers to searching 
questions put by you. 
“The temptation for 
solicitors,” warns Summers, 
“particularly junior ones, is to 
present every aspect of your 
situation as needing urgent 
attention. This may result 
from the cautious legal 
temperament, the fear of 
being sued unless every 
“INSTRUCTING  
LAWYERS IS A  
POTENTIAL MINEFIELD”

possible risk is dealt with, or 
the fact that more legal work 
generally means more fees. 
However, the reality may be 
that there are relatively few 
tasks requiring immediate 
work. A commercial view is 
one that measures the real 
risks against the size of your 
budget. A good solicitor is  
one that gives you such a 
commercial view, and not 
simply an expensive wish list 
to ensure that you are 100 per 
cent watertight on all points, 
however obscure, and 
establish the price.”
WHEN’S MY YEAR-END? 
When you start, you need to 
pick your year-end – that is, 
the end of your accounting 
period. You don’t have to 
choose 5 April (the standard) 
– you can choose any date you 
like – but if you do, you won’t 
end up being double taxed. 
You are legally required  
to register for VAT if your 
turnover exceeds £82,000.  
If you reach this without 
realising, you must register 
within 30 days. The good  
news is that if you’re VAT-
registered, you can claim back 
VAT on things such as car and 
printing expenses. However, 
you have to complete VAT 
returns quarterly, and charge 
your clients VAT, which can be 
time-consuming. 
One way to help your cash 
WORK-LIFE 
BALANCE
It can be really hard to achieve work-life 
balance in the early days of a start-up, 
especially if there’s only one of you working 
on everything. But there are ways of making 
sure you don’t let your business rule your 
personal life. Monica Parker of workplace 
specialist Morgan Lovell says, “Make sure 
you keep certain things sacrosanct, such as 
the school run, the ballet recital and date 
night. You will have your family longer than 
you’ll have this job.”
Learn early on what you can control and 
what you can’t. “Instead, create processes,” 
says Parker. “Schedule and time-keep the 
aspects of your life you can control. Then 
release the aspects you can’t so they don’t 
make you crazy.”
Get to know your rhythm. Are you an owl 
or a lark? Learn this about yourself before 
you start, so you can tackle jobs when you 
know you are at your most productive.
Studies have shown that a 20-minute 
nap in the afternoon has a bigger impact  
on your energy levels than an extra 20 
minutes of sleep in the morning. Learn the 
power of a quick kip.
Be vulnerable and share your fears and 
failures with those closest to you. You will 
spring back more easily from the lows, and 
your friends and family won’t feel alienated 
from what’s going on.

DEBT 
MANAGEMENT
Don’t get bogged down by debt. Paul Byett 
from Hacker Young says that one way of 
making sure this never happens is,  
“Simply, to collect your debts from  
people who owe you and make sure you 
understand your own terms and conditions. 
General business practice is that people are 
paid 30 days after the date of the invoice.” 
Make sure you know this when you send the 
invoice out, and make your actions the 
same as your words.
If you’re confident with your service, you 
should be able to ask for a deposit up-front 
from some clients. Says Byett, “Everyone 
else is probably being chased for payment. 
Why should you be embarrassed for asking 
for financial security?”
Don’t scrimp on costs. Good cash flow 
isn’t about saving cost, it’s about having 
more sales and builds. Continue to do  
your marketing during the lean times.  
Work smarter and make use of downtime  
to promote your services.
Practise budgetary discipline. Says Byett, 
“If you suddenly get a large payment, bear 
in mind when you’re next going to be paid. 
This large sum may just mean that you  
owe others money. It doesn’t mean it’s 
actually yours.”
flow is to register for the VAT 
cash accounting scheme, in 
which you do not need to pay 
VAT until your customer has 
paid you. If your customer 
never pays you, you never 
have to pay the VAT. You can 
use this method if your 
estimated VAT taxable 
turnover during the next tax 
year is not more than £1.35m.
A PROBLEM SHARED 
You might want to go it  
alone entirely but never 
underestimate the power of 
the right advice. 
Kathleen Saxton is founder 
of The Lighthouse Company 
and chair of the advisory 
board Advertising Week 
Europe. She says, “Within any 
SME, investing in consultancy 
or external advisors is always 
a serious consideration.  
Any capital expenditure  
needs to have a positive 
impact on the business almost 
immediately. Whilst most 
businesses have a breadth of 
skillset within the leadership 
team, there will always be 
specialist areas or indeed 
blind spots that need careful 
consideration, so identify 
them early and be honest and 
open about where you need to 
seek counsel.” Saxton adds, 
“Don’t be tempted to only 
rely on your most immediate 
network. Trusting outside 
advisors with your deepest 
company issues or concerns  
is always daunting and 
sometimes exposing, but 
seeking, finding and engaging 
with the best advisors you  
can afford is always the 
smarter option.”
And don’t balk at the idea  
of going straight to the top, 
either. Human nature dictates 
that we fundamentally like to 
be respected and needed, says 
Saxton, so you will probably 
find that even the most senior 
or high profile people enjoy 
being consulted or asked their 
opinion: “Don’t be daunted by 
stature or profile – you will be 
surprised how many people 
want to help you to succeed, 
paid for or otherwise.”
Once you have asked for 
help, Saxton says it’s crucial 
to listen to it. “Be willing and 
ready to take the advice you 
are given,” she says, adding, 
“When we put our heart and 
soul into a business, it can be

hard to hear criticism or 
challenging views. Try to see 
those views as a gift to take 
your business further, faster.” 
Sometimes your customers 
and clients will be your best 
consultants. Listen to what 
they ask of you and feed that 
into your business plans. As a 
small business, you have the 
luxury of direct contact with 
your audience, so make sure 
you benefit from this as much 
as you can. Also, make sure 
you speak to other business 
leaders within your industry: 
“The spirit of camaraderie  
can melt the competitive 
boundaries,” says Saxton. 
“Be willing and ready to 
take the advice you are 
given. When we put our 
heart and soul into a 
business, it can be hard  
to hear criticism or 
challenging views. Try to 
see those views as a gift  
to take your business 
further, faster.”
If you are paying for an 
external consultant, be clear 
on the brief and how you are 
going to measure their 
impact. Don’t fall prey to the 
creeping brief – one that gets 
added to and altered subtly 
along the way. Be absolute in 
your request and expectations 
from the start.
It could be worth creating an 
advisory board. Although the 
idea might sound very grand, 
it can be a smart way to attract 
advisors or investors. This 
needn’t be as onerous as it 
seems. Saxton explains: “We 
have just four meetings a 
year, arranged in advance and 
with a time limit. We have 
been able to attract some of 
the finest brains in the 
advertising industry to sit 
together and impart valued 
wisdom, which had a very 
positive impact on the final 
event itself.”
THE GREEN BACKS
The idea and the business 
plan are the easy bit. Getting 
the financial backing, not so 
much. If your business can 
manage without borrowing 
money, this can be a great way 
to proceed (though it’s very 
much dependent on how well 
you will be able to start up 

24  |   Start your own business
without, and what your 
overheads will be). When 
trying to make this decision, 
make sure you weigh very 
carefully the profits you might 
make against the risk that you 
will be taking. If you’re going 
to be required to charge your 
home to the bank in order to 
raise the money, can you 
survive if it all goes down  
the proverbial? 
It’s worth doing a bit of 
basic research into the 
different types of financing 
available on the market. 
Business finance falls into two 
categories: debt and equity. 
Debt is, in short, borrowing 
money that will be paid back 
over time with interest. Equity 
is finance provided by you or 
your investors and doesn’t 
have to be repaid as such 
(though investors usually 
expect some sort of return). 
The ratio of debt to equity is 
called gearing, and the terms 
highly geared or highly 
leveraged mean that the 
business has a higher 
proportion of debt compared 
with equity. 
Banks and finance 
companies offer a range of 
debt financing, including 
overdrafts and loans. An 
overdraft is a borrowing 
facility linked to an existing 
account and designed to help 
with short-term borrowing 
needs. It’s worth being aware 
that a bank can demand 
repayment on an overdraft in 
full at any time (although if 
you’re keeping up repayments 
and your credit rating is 
stable, it’s unlikely). 
Overdrafts are usually agreed 
for six to twelve months, and 
then renewed by negotiation. 
Overdrafts are also usually 
“IT’S STILL POSSIBLE  
TO GET GOVERNMENT 
GRANTS IN SOME AREAS”
more cost-effective than 
credit cards, because the 
interest is only paid on the 
amount borrowed at a margin 
above the Bank of England 
base rate. 
Most banks offer business 
loans – a large amount of 
money repayable over an 
agreed period. These are 
obviously better than 
overdrafts and can be more 
cost-effective if interest is 
fixed (usually on loans under 
£25,000). Business credit 
cards operate in a similar way 
to personal credit cards, and 
are a useful way to help with 
cash flow (if managed 
properly). The advantage of 
debt funding is that you don’t 
have to give up a share in your 
business to a lender, and your 
obligation is only to pay back 
the amount borrowed, with 
interest, so if you become a 
zillionaire, you don’t have to 
do any depressing maths 
about how much less you will 
actually be getting. Another 
thing to consider is that 
interest payments might be 
deductible against tax. 
One great finance initiative 
for smaller businesses is 
invoice finance, a way of 
freeing up cash from invoices 
raised. The amount of money 
available can grow 
automatically as sales 
increase. How it works is that 
you submit invoices to a 
factoring company, which 
advances a pre-agreed 
percentage of the invoice 
amount. The factoring 
company then collects the 
payment from the customer 
once it falls due, then releases 
the balance back to you. 
Similarly, invoice discounting 
(where you collect the 
payments yourself) is aimed 
at larger companies with a 
turnover in excess of £1m.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
You will have undoubtedly 
heavily researched whether 
your sector offers grants. 
Believe it or not, it’s still 
possible to get government 
grants in some areas. 
Research geographical hubs 
and consider whether it’s 
worth relocating to take 
advantage of any cash going. 
You may also want to consider 
whether it’s worth tweaking 
your business idea to meet the 
funding goal (within reason, 
of course). 
Grants can be 
geographically allocated, 
sector-based and even given 
to people such as former 
armed services personnel, so 
it’s really worth doing some 
research into what criteria you 
or your business might fit.
Applying for grants can be a 
long and time-consuming 
business but the money can 
come in incredibly useful at 
the start of your business, you 
don’t have to pay it back, and 
being a grant recipient can 
also act as an excellent 
marketing tool. 
Obviously, finance providers 
have different lending 
requirements. Banks usually 
look at your ability to pay back 
the amount borrowed as well 
as interest, plus any 
additional fees (watch out for 
these). Equity investors look 
for good growth potential and 

 Start your own business  |  25 
profitability. Investors tend to 
concentrate on growth 
businesses rather than on 
small businesses but in order 
to secure decent investment, 
your idea or product needs to 
be innovative or within a 
niche market that is known to 
the investor.  
It’s worth remembering 
that businesses are typically 
pretty worthless when they 
are very small but investors 
can add to this value very 
quickly with additional capital 
and know-how. It’s therefore 
important not to scare them 
off by insisting on keeping 90 
per cent of your business. A 
decent stake between 26 and 
49 per cent should be enough 
to please them. 
GOING WITH THE (CASH) FLOW
Many businesses are now 
going down the online 
accounting route. Emily 
Coltman, FCA, chief 
accountant for online 
accounting system FreeAgent, 
says the spreadsheet way is 
becoming a thing of the past.
“If you’re starting out in 
business on your own, it’s 
likely that you’re counting the 
pennies,” she says, “So an 
ongoing expense, such as 
paying for a subscription to an 
online accounting service, 
may not be high on your list of 
priorities, especially if you 
think you can keep your 
business books free of charge 
on a spreadsheet. But an 
online accountancy solution 
can save you both time and 
accountancy fees.” When you

spreadsheets every week, 
number-crunching and 
dealing with an accountant, 
the time and cost involved 
quickly add up. 
Says Coltman, “I had a 
client, in my days as an 
accountant in practice, who 
kept his records on a series of 
spreadsheets of his own 
design. It used to take me 
several days to just add up 
everything that had gone in 
and out of his bank account, 
and make sure that the 
amount he thought was in his 
bank account was what really 
was in his bank account, 
because he always put these 
transactions in several 
different workbooks. I moved 
him on to a nice simple piece 
of purpose-built accounting 
software designed for small 
businesses, and at the end of 
his first year, I was able to 
check his banking was 
accurate in five minutes flat. 
The client saved a lot of 
money and our relationship 
improved vastly.” 
Most online accounting 
products are updated 
automatically to reflect 
government tax rate changes, 
reducing the risk of error. 
Another advantage of a 
system like this is that your 
accountant can log in at any 
time and offer advice. A 
system such as FreeAgent can 
also generate invoices using 
an automatic numbering 
service with recurring 
invoices, which, as anyone 
who’s hastily cobbled 
together an invoice on the 
train and come up with a 
made-up invoice number will 
know, makes you look much 
more professional. 
WHAT CAN I CLAIM?
You need to know what you 
can and can’t claim through 
your business. Steve Theaker 
is senior tax partner at UHY 
Hacker Young. He says, “Any 
expense that is incurred 
wholly and exclusively for the 
purposes of the company’s 
trade is generally allowable. 
This can include equipment 
purchases, travel expenses 
and product development; in 
short, the necessary day-to-
expenses associated with 
running a business.” 
Travel expenses are 
allowable for all legitimate 
business journeys, including 
travel to temporary 
workplaces, although there 
are some complicated rules 
around this. Theaker explains, 
“Subsistence payments of up 
to £25 a day can be paid to 
directors and employees 
without proof of expenditure, 
to cover the cost of breakfast, 
lunch and dinner where they 
are travelling away from their 
base for more than 10 hours. 
The costs of parking spaces 
near the workplace are 
deductible and not taxable on 
the employees.”
Enhanced tax relief on 
expenditure on research and 
development (R&D) is 
becoming more and more 
important for a number of 
companies, says Theaker: 
“Qualifying expenditure  
GET YOUR HEAD  
IN THE CLOUD
Cloud computing is where it’s at. Lori 
Williams, general manager, Europe,  
at cloud services company Appirio, says,  
“Small businesses were among the earliest 
adopters of cloud technology and first to 
witness its business benefits.” She says 
that cloud technology frees SMEs from the 
restraints of on-premise technologies.  
“They can purchase IT application services 
on demand, which helps them spend less, 
manage their cash flow and innovate more 
quickly without having to expend significant 
start-up costs on hardware or perpetual 
licences. Crucially for companies wanting 
to grow and differentiate themselves,  
the cloud enables business agility by 
immediate provisioning of functionality of 
core business needs, such as email and 
CRM, as well as access to cutting-edge 
social and mobile functionality.”

28  |   Start your own business
(and it’s surprising what 
qualifies) is uplifted by 125 per 
cent for tax purposes. In other 
words, if your qualifying 
spend is £10,000 you pretend, 
for tax purposes, that it is 
£22,500.”
Keeping yourself and staff 
up to date with training is 
crucial for any business. 
Luckily, payments for work-
related training are claimable, 
as are wellbeing initiatives, 
such as sports and gym 
facilities for employees. Staff 
events can be claimed for, as 
long as the VAT-inclusive cost 
in a tax year does not exceed 
£150 a head. The same is also 
true for non-employee guests.
GOING FOR GROWTH
So it’s all going swimmingly 
but how do you make the leap 
from a small business to a 
medium business? 
Daniel Callaghan is founder 
of MBA & Company, which 
connects large and small 
businesses with highly skilled 
professionals for project work.  
“Expand carefully,” he says. 
“Demand for your product or 
service is fantastic but there’s 
always a danger you simply 
won’t be about to fulfil orders, 
or deliver the level of service 
your clients expect.” 
If you can’t meet demand, 
you’ll lose clients and, in turn, 
demand will plummet. Some 
small businesses find they can 
accommodate an uplift but 
they can’t provide a service to 
a high enough standard, 
which creates customer 
service issues. “Quality can 
really set your firm apart from 
the competition,” says 
Callaghan, “So businesses 
need to ensure they can 
deliver the same quality 
service whether they have 5 
employees or 500.” 
One potential problem is 
that most SMEs don’t have 
concrete systems or 
hierarchies in place. This is,  
of course, fine when you have 
12 members of staff, but add 
12 more into the mix and 
suddenly you need to clarify 
lines of communications, and 
implement structure and 
processes. You also need 
someone to check people are 
following these processes, 
something that SME owners 
commonly overlook.
If your goal in setting up a 
business is simply to free  
up time and improve your 
quality of life, you shouldn’t 
feel pressurised to go for 
growth. Says Callaghan, 
“Entrepreneurs with big 
ambitions work round the 
clock to reach the dizzy 
heights, so growing a business 
is not for the faint-hearted. 
Lifestyle businesses can still 
be lucrative.”
But if you do want to 
expand, you will have to hand 
over some responsibility at 
some point. Says Callaghan, 
“Check in with your contacts 
regularly, to keep yourself in 
the loop. Your expertise won’t 
necessarily be diluted – you’ll 
be passing on your wisdom to 
your employees.” O
LIMITED COMPANY
If you know from the start that you’re likely to 
be making more than £20,000 of profit (not 
turnover), you should probably consider setting 
up as a limited structure, simply because it’s 
more tax efficient. If you do run a limited 
company and you want to take money out,  
it’s worth operating on a mixture of dividends 
and salary. You can set your own salary to 
whatever you want, and you don’t have to 
comply with minimum wage. The smaller the 
salary you take, the less tax you pay on it.  
Then take the rest as dividends (effectively 
making you a shareholder and director).
SOLE TRADER
If, for whatever reason, you can’t be a limited 
company (if you’ve been bankrupt recently or 
been disqualified as a director) or simply want 
to start small, you can register as a sole trader. 
As a sole trader, you’ll pay income tax and 
National Insurance contributions on your 
UHVSHFWLYHVKDUHVRIWKHSURƛWVDQGJDLQV 
of your business. If you are a sole trader  
and you want to continue using a personal 
bank account, it’s a good idea to keep any  
bank account you use for your business 
separate, just to make it easier for yourself.  
It’s completely legal to use a personal bank 
account if you are a sole trader, but some 
banks won’t allow you if they discover that you 
have a lot of trade income. However, if you are 
a limited company, you must use a business 
account by law.
LLP
If there’s more than one of you and you’re a 
limited company, you could also set up as an 
LLP (Limited Liability Partnership). This means 
that one partner is not responsible or liable for 
another partner’s misconduct or negligence. 
Any new or existing firm of two or more people 
can incorporate as an LLP.

blunders

These days, it’s relatively easy 
for digital practitioners to 
start up a business of their

government documents, buy 
some computers and software 
licenses, create a studio

Whether it’s an employee-

company not filing the right

or a client holding back key 
information required to make 
your project successful, you’ll 
have to become adept at 
damage control. We’ve been 
running shops collectively for 
almost two decades, and one 
thing we’ve learned is that 
watching others screw up is 
one of the best ways you can 
learn not to.
Two years ago, we started a 
retreat called Owner Camp 
(ownercamp.com) for people 
who own their own digital 
studios. Each retreat is three 

 Start your own business  |  31 
days of open and honest 
discussion, much of which 
centres around lessons we’ve 
all learned the hard way.  
In the spirit of those 
conversations, we’d like to 
provide a glimpse of some  
of the mistakes we’ve 
experienced, a few that our 
peers have endured, and the 
lessons we’ve all learned.
TRUSTING YOUR GUT
Many of us are creative-
minded people who didn’t go 
to business school. Concepts 
like cash or accrual method 
accounting, depreciation and 
billability can make our heads 
spin. No matter the size of 
your company, a good 
accountant or bookkeeper is 
vital. In the beginning, both 
of us ran separate shops 
before combining. When our 
offices ran independently,  
one of us hired a small 
accounting firm to handle all 
of the bookkeeping, financial 
planning and tax filings.
At first, the relationship 
went smoothly. Then, the 
firm was shaken when a 
partner left. Things got 
progressively worse as 
the weight of the operation 
overburdened the remaining 
partner. Rather than hiring 
more people or scaling back 
the client roster, he delivered 
late, apologising each time. 
The final straw came when 
he filed tax returns with only 
minutes to spare. Despite 
having a strong suspicion that 
money was owed to the 
government, the accountant 
insisted that a substantial 
refund was on the way. Sure 
enough, the cheque arrived a 
couple of weeks later. After 
the firm hired a new 
accountant, they found 
“a discrepancy”. Instead of 
receiving a $14,000 refund, 
$77,000 was owed.Jaw-
dropping. Fortunately, 
contingencies were put in 
place to handle an outcome 
like this.

experience? When you sense

things going south, look for 
other options immediately. 
Go with your gut. If it feels 
wrong – guess what? – it’s 
likely wrong.
KEEPING MONEY FLOWING
Managing cash flow can be the 
bane of a business owner’s 
existence. Most of us start out 
relatively small, with a 
handful of employees and a 
workload that enables us to 
get by without angel investors 
or lines of credit. Once the 
business grows, things get 
trickier. For instance, clients 
might sit on your invoice for a 
week or more, even if you 
delivered it to them promptly. 
Before you know it,  
your 30-day payment 
arrangements have been 
extended. One such 
experience happened to 
Owner Camp alumnus  
Warren Wilansky, who owns 
and runs Plank (plankdesign.
com), a digital design studio 
in Montreal:
“In year two of running 
Plank, we made the mistake 
of not planning well (or, make 
that: at all) for the tax bill that 
hit our desks one day. We 
didn’t have enough money in 
the bank to pay it, and at that 
point we didn’t even have any 
kind of monetary safety net or 
line of credit.”
Thankfully Wilansky 
managed to find a way to 
make his payment and avoid 
further trouble.
A line of credit can be an 
extremely useful tool in 
helping to manage cash flow. 
Banks like to see a 
demonstrated history of 
creditworthiness, and it’s 
worth the effort to apply 
ahead of time. The process 
can take several weeks, so 
don’t wait until you’re in dire 
need of cash. Plan for things 
to go wrong when things are 
not going wrong.
BEING TRANSPARENT
Transparency can be difficult 
to manage, whether it’s with a 
single business partner or a 
hundred-person organisation. 
Determining what (and what 
not) to share with your 
colleagues is a decision you 
need to make for yourself. It 
can be a damned-if-you-do 
and damned-if-you-don’t 
proposition.
We’ve found that some level 
of transparency is necessary 
to get the most out of your 
team members and to help 
them grow as leaders. If you 
do it right, you’ll earn their 
respect. However, too much 
transparency – no matter how 
good your intentions – can 
create feelings of entitlement 
which can undermine your 
relationships with your 
colleagues.
We worked with an 
individual with whom we 
chose to share increasing 
amounts of information. 
When we encountered a slow 
There are key moments in your life 
when you get the opportunity to make a 
vital first impression. After hundreds of 
hours of work and six months without 
revenue, nGen Works was ready to say 
hello to the world in late 2003. 
We sourced thousands of email 
addresses from business cards and old 
emails. We created a three-minute Flash 
movie showcasing our animation 
talents. We spent weeks crafting the 
perfect email. We fine-tuned our 
message within an inch of its life. 
Then, the day before hitting ‘Send’, 
we learned there were ways to track 
email messages in order to gain extra 
insights. A quick AltaVista search led us 
to a company in California that looked 
amazing. Not only could it help us track 
the success of our messaging, it could 
help us personalise the emails – we 
went with them. We spent the final 24 
hours before launch manually entering 
names into our spreadsheet so we could 
personalise our messages. 
With great anticipation, we waited for 
launch time. Beers were chilled and 
operators were standing by. We scanned 
the message one final time. Then, 
whoosh. It was away.
Within a minute, we got our first 
response. “Hey, I clicked on this link 
and it doesn’t work.” We took a look. 
None of the links worked. It turned out, 
our new email partner’s system was 
completely down.

would have created too much 
anxiety.
The employee questioned 
why we were taking on more 
work, and strongly objected to 
it. Our increasing levels of 
transparency had created an 
expectation, and we now felt 
obligated to share the reasons 
behind the difficult decisions 
we were making as business-
owners. The employee was 
not aware that the two of us 
had not paid ourselves for two 
months in order to pay them, 
provide them with health  
care and keep making 
contributions to their 
retirement accounts. It was 
incredibly stressful.
Since then, we’ve been 
continuously evaluating how 
much information to share 
with our co-workers. We’ve 
been more forthcoming with 
sharing financial information, 
and we’ll likely continue to do 
so. Some companies are 
completely transparent about 
salaries. We don’t feel like 
we’re there yet.
MANAGING DOWNTURNS
Earlier this year, Greg Hoy 
wrote about how tough the 
economy has been for digital 
agencies (netm.ag/
economy-257). The first 
quarter of 2014 was disastrous 
for many. When encountering 
times like these, it means 
having to make tough 
decisions which can lead to 
crippling debt and a 
demoralised team.
James Archer, of Phoenix-
based UX design firm Forty 
(forty.co), recently faced this 
challenge and came away with 
some strong advice:
“The brutal truth of 
business ownership is that 
“Some level of 
transparency is 
necessary to get the 
most out of your 
team members and 
to help them grow 
as leaders.”

sometimes layoffs are totally 
appropriate, not just for the 
business itself, but for 
everyone involved. Nobody 
had ever told me that, though, 
so when things got rough I 
started digging a deep hole in 
our credit line, trying to keep 
the team together when I 
should have just recognised 
that we were overstaffed for 
the work we had coming in.
To make it worse, some 
team members eventually got 
nervous about the financial 
imbalance caused by trying to 
preserve their jobs, and 
wound up quitting anyway. In 
retrospect, everyone would 
have been better off if I’d  
let some of them go six 
months earlier.
If you’re thinking about 
whether you need to consider 
layoffs, it’s probably already 
time. Get it done, and keep 
your business strong for 
the future.”
CHARGING RIGHT
When starting a studio, 
possibly the biggest unknown 
you need to face is figuring 
out how much to charge for 
your services. We’re asked 
this question all the time. 
Happy Cog founder Jeffrey 
Zeldman used to tell us, 
“You’ll work just as hard for a 
$5,000 website as you do for a 
$50,000 website.” He was 
absolutely right. Clients want 
what they want, so get  
ready for it.

Aaron Quinn, co-founder of 
eHouse Studio (ehousestudio.
com) in Charleston, South 
Carolina, has a great story to 
illustrate this point: 
“In the first year of 
business, we were asked to 
price a redesign of a large 
website for an organisation. It 
had recently launched its site, 
but was unhappy with it.
“At the time, the four team 
members of our company 
worked together to detail 
every hour and task to price 
the project. 
“It was one of the largest 
projects we had taken on to 
date. Our expectation was that 
the client wouldn’t be pleased 
with the sticker price, having 
just built its existing site.
“In the presentation we 
nervously approached the 
final price tag of $30,000, all 
we could say was, ‘It’s going 
to be around 30’. The client’s 
reply was, ‘30? Thousand? 
I paid over three times that 
for the first one, where  
do I sign?’
“That was our first 
realisation that we were 
under-pricing what we had to 
offer and we could actually 
charge the correct value.”
TACKLING EMAIL
With all of the methods we 
have to communicate with 
now, there is one that 
consistently causes problems: 
email. It’s simply too easy to 
screw up on email if you’re 
not paying attention.
Years ago, we were asked to 
participate in a pitch to 
redesign the website of a very 
prestigious organisation. 
After weeks of dialogue and 
prep work, we made it to  
the final selection round. 
On a Sunday morning, the 
prospective client emailed us 
to ask if we could answer a  
list of follow-up questions  
she provided.
As we read the email, a  
reply hit our inboxes from a 
business development person 
we were working with. These 
words, included in the email 
response, are tattooed on our 
brains: “These guys are being 
a pain in the ass, but they’re a 
world class organisation and 
they’ll look great in our 
portfolio.” The problem?  
He’d hit “Reply to all”. The 
response went to the client 
too. Ugh.
We spent the rest of the day 
carefully drafting the most 
thoughtful and humble 
apology we could muster.  
One person, hurriedly typing a 
response, had just insulted a 
group of people who do the 
work of angels. On Monday 
morning, we gracefully 
removed ourselves from 
consideration, wished the 
client well, and let the 
business development  
person go.
NOT DROPPING THE MIC
Last year, our company went 
through a good deal of 
change. In years past,  
we’d tackle client projects 
geographically – our  
Austin office would handle 
work near there, and our 
Philadelphia office would 
focus on work in the north-
eastern US.
As our company grew, it 
became clear that this 
structure didn’t scale well. 
After carefully considering a 
new team-based approach, 
one of us published a long, 
energetic post that outlined 
all of the juicy details with a 
new organisation chart. After 
clicking ‘Submit’ , he closed 
his laptop and went on a 
week-long vacation. Needless 
to say, few people were 
completely freaked out by 
such a substantial change and 
immediately asked questions 
that a few of us didn’t have 
detailed answers for. 
When the vacation was over, 
our management team talked 
about what happened. Know 
that if you are conveying 
life-changing information to 
your staff that they’ll have 
questions about it. Be 
available for them.
MAKING MISTAKES
None of these situations have 
a one-size-fits-all solution. 
The one common 
denominator that business 
owners have is the fact that 
they own businesses. Apart 
from that, things can be quite 
different. The secret is 
sharing information and 
applying what makes sense 
for you. 
We encourage you to talk to 
each other. There’s plenty of 
work out there. Sharing a 
secret or two won’t put you 
out of business, it’ll make you 
stronger. Mistakes are a good 
place to start. O

Quick

Let’s be positive. Forget the 
credit crunch and the age of 
austerity – we’re going to help 
you make some money. Don’t 
worry if you’re no Alan Sugar; 
thanks to the internet and 
your PC, all you need is a good 
idea. If you don’t even have 
one of those, you can 
transform your spare time 
into cash – legally. 
This isn’t a guide to selling 
old vinyl on eBay or flogging 
knackered paperbacks on 
Amazon. We’ve done our 
homework, trawled the web 
and put together a list of new, 
exciting and innovative ways 
in which technology can help 
you make money. 
We’ll explore topics such as 
human intelligence tasks – 
jobs that computers and 
software can’t do, but are 
Stuck for ideas or cash? Help get your business off the 
ground and make quick money from home with your PC
essential to the functioning of 
an electronic business. All you 
need do is sign up for a 
service, set aside a few hours 
and do the jobs you’re 
assigned. It might not be 
glamorous work, but if you 
have a PC and some time to 
spare, it’s a great way of 
earning a few quid. 
If you’re feeling brave, we’ll 
also explore how to start your 
own electronic business in a 
thoroughly modern way. Back 
in the pre-wired age, the 
banks held all the cards. If you 
wanted to start a business, 
you had to convince your bank 
manager that your great idea 
was profitable. Today you can 
forget the big four. If you have 
an ambition to launch an 
amazing venture, all you need 
to do is convince a community 
of lenders. If they’re happy 
with your plan, the cash will 
turn up. The equation works 
the other way, too. If you have 
some savings and fancy being 
a venture capitalist, read on.
Before we get stuck into 
making our fortunes, a word 
of warning: keep your wits 
about you. The web is 
groaning with scams and 
scammers. We’ll look at a few 
classic examples, but it pays 
to be aware of potential cons 
and fraud. The internet is a 
great place to make cash – 
just remember the old adage: 
if it sounds too good to be 
true, it probably is. You’re 
putting your livelihood on the 
line starting a new business. 
Either hit these schemes 
prepared to lose, or take a 
small risk.

Services such as Zopa make it possible to borrow 
and lend without the bankers taking a cut
Peer-to-peer 
lending
Peer-to-peer lending, or 
social banking, uses the 
principle of crowdsourcing. 
Let’s say you want to borrow a 
couple of grand to start an 
online T-shirt business. Sign 
up to Zopa (www.zopa.com) 
and you can get a loan at a 
very attractive rate of interest, 
plus a flat fee. 
The money comes from a 
network of lenders, not a 
bank, and it pays to be a 
lender, too. At Zopa, for 
example, the average return at 
the time of writing is 5.0 per 
cent, which is actually a lot 
better than most short-term 
savings accounts.
What if a borrower can’t pay 
back the money? So far, Zopa 
has done pretty well on that 
front, with a paltry 0.28 per 
cent default rate. But your 
investment doesn’t go to one 
person – it’s seeded 
throughout the community at 
no more than £10 per 
borrower. If one person 
defaults, it’ll have little 
impact on your return as a 
lender. Zopa is the front-
runner in this area, but other 
sites offer a similar service. 
You may get a better return 
from Funding Circle (www.
fundingcircle.com), for 
example. The main difference 
for borrowers is that there’s 
no flat fee. Instead, a portion 
of the loan is paid to the 
service. Funding Circle prefers 
business customers, while 
Zopa is open to anyone who 
has a good credit rating.
You can get a better return if 
you’re willing to take a higher 
risk. That’s how it works at 
FundingKnight (www.
fundingknight.com). 
Borrowers post loan requests 
and you can choose who you 
GOLD FARMING
Turn in-game currency into cash
Rather ridculous it may be, but online 
gamers know in-game currency is a 
serious matter. It lets you unlock features, 
buy items and advance in the virtual 
world. You could work for it, or buy it from 
someone who’s done all the work for you. 
The practice is called gold farming and 
it’s a real business, with Asia and Eastern 
Europe leading a market worth millions of 
dollars. But is it a real shortcut to cash in 
a more developed economy? If you 
assume that 10,000 units of gold in WoW 
are advertised for as little as $9 – then 
consider that with exploits these guys are 
probably making fewer than 300 units an 
hour – the answer is probably no.
Savvy players recommend playing the 
in-game market like the stock exchange, 
but if you’re that skilled, why not dabble 
in real financial markets instead? 
want to lend money to. You 
put in a bid for that loan, 
setting your own interest rate. 
The return on investments 
averages at 10.8 per cent, but 
although all borrowers are 
screened, it’s somewhat 
riskier than lending to the 
crowd. If a borrower defaults, 
a debt collector may called in 
to pursue your investment.

5 PER CENT – BETTER THAN 
SAVINGS ACCOUNTS”

Computers are becoming ever more powerful, but some jobs still need a 
human touch. Work at your own pace with Human Intelligence Tasks
Make money 
for tiny tasks
Computers have removed lots 
of boring and repetitive tasks 
from the workplace, but 
they’ve created a fair few,  
too. That’s where Amazon’s 
Mechanical Turk comes in 
(www.mturk.com). Small 
tasks that can’t be performed 
by software are farmed out to 
its subscribers, who turn the 
job around for a few cents at a 
time. That name? It’s from an 
18th century sideshow 
attraction. A chess-playing 
robot was toured around 
Europe, amazing audiences 
with its apparent skill. It was, 
however, controlled by a 
human hidden from view.
The micro-jobs that are 
tendered at Mechanical Turk 
(called HITs or human 
intelligence tasks) could be 
any quick, computer-related 
duty. In a typical session, a 
user might do a bit of data 
entry or fill in a questionnaire.  
The more HITs you complete 
in the allotted time, the more 
you earn. With many HITs 
offered at just a few cents a 
task, it requires dedication to 
earn a crust – but there are 
advantages, too. You can work 
from home doing as much or 
as little as you want, at any 
time of day you want. And 
tasks that require more 
thought and effort pay more. 
If Mechanical Turk’s 
rewards seem too paltry, there 
are similar, more specialised 
services to choose from. 
MicroWorkers (www.micro 
workers.com) offers higher 
rates, but the tasks are in the 
grey marketing category, with 
HITs requiring that you sign 
up for dating sites and blogs, 
or review items on Amazon.
CloudCrowd (www.cloud 
crowd.com) is an unusual-
looking enterprise. You sign 
up through Facebook and 
much of the work on offer is 
proofreading and translation-
based. Human intelligence 
tasks pay up to $3, though 
many of the jobs on offer are 
less. Payment is through 
PayPal and support is offered 
through Get Satisfaction. 
Finally, there’s Just Answer 
(www.justanswer.com). The 
model here is a little different, 
but still nestles in the same 
broad category as other HIT 
sites. Here, you get to use your 
expertise to answer live 
queries from users. Of course, 
DON’T BE A MULE
Beware of money laundering jobs
We’ve all had the emails or seen the adverts 
on Craigslist, but job titles such as Money 
Transfer Agent disguise the fact that anyone 
who accepts such an offer is a mule: an 
unwitting party to money laundering. You’ll 
be asked to accept transfers to and from 
your bank account for a percentage in 
commission. The crooks are using you to 
cover up a paper trail that leads back to 
them and the origin of the fraudulently 
obtained cash. Ignorance of the crime is no 
defence. You’re receiving stolen goods. Be 
safe: report scams like this to reports@
banksafeonline.org.uk.
you need some qualifications 
in the field you choose and 
your credentials are displayed 
to users. The system works on 
a bidding basis. As a provider, 
you scan the listings for live 
questions you can answer. If 
you can help, you set a price. 
It’s up to the user whether 
they agree to pay that price or 
continue looking for a better 
deal. New providers take 25 
per cent of the fee, while more 
seasoned experts get a 50 per 
cent cut.

44  |   Start your own business
ADVERTISE ON YOUR WEBSITE
The easiest way to start serving ads from your site, and earning 
money, is Google’s AdSense (http://adsense.google.com). A 
chunk of code is provided for you to paste into your site when 
you sign up. People browsing your site see adverts that fit its 
content and keywords. 
The cash-per-click model means that every time a visitor 
clicks on a link, you get a share of the fee the advertiser paid. 
Google doesn’t publicise the exact percentage of the pie that 
you’ll get, but some keywords offer a bigger slice than others. 
Some AdSense users have seen earnings over £1,000 a month.
It’s hard to track which keywords are the real winners, even 
though there are several blogs and websites that claim to list 
the highest paying AdSense keywords. Is it worth shelling out 
for these lists? You can use Google’s own AdWords tool to 
suggest related keywords for free. It’ll help you optimise your 
content for more targeted ads.
Don’t click ads on your own page, and don’t think asking 
your friends to click on them will help you either. Google 
considers this click fraud, and employs sophisticated tracking 
mechanisms to protect its revenue. You’re more likely to get a 
swift, permanent ban than any extra income. If you want to 
make money with AdSense, just make good, consistent 
content aimed at a small audience.
For more control over ads, try affiliate linking. You either 
take a percentage of all the sales you refer to the service 
provider, or you get simple cash for clicks. Amazon Associates 
is a highly visible example. Sign up at http://affiliate-program.
amazon.co.uk for access to tools that let you create banners, 
badges and text links to any item on the site – just make sure 
the products you choose are relevant to the content you 
already carry. When someone clicks an Amazon affiliate link 
on your site, you’ll get nine per cent of the cash they spend. 
Easy money.
MAKE MONEY WITH VIDEOS
Technically, it’s easy for anyone to prepare a home video for 
publication online. You can upload video at HD resolutions on 
YouTube, for example – and the service takes care of the 
compression at various resolutions for you. YouTube also 
accepts video in QuickTime, MPEG, Windows Media format or 
as an AVI file. Keep in mind that HD resolution is 1,920 x 1,080, 
so there’s no point going over that. Once you’ve clicked the 
‘Upload’ button, it’s really straightforward. The tough part 
isn’t making videos – it’s growing an audience. You’ll need 
that audience to make money.
It’s easy to see which are YouTube’s most popular videos. Go 
to http://bit.ly/200KW37, where you can pick the most popular 
videos. There are several common threads. First, cuteness. 
Cute kids and cute animals. If it’s funny as well as cute, it’s 
YouTube gold. The number one video of all time is Psy’s music 
video for ‘Gangnam Style’.
One way to hedge your bets is to ride the slipstream. For a 
short time, Rebecca Black parodies and mashups were nearly 
as popular on YouTube as the original video. Catch the next 
viral smash at the beginning of its ascent, then make a video 
that rides its coat-tails and your efforts will benefit from the 
reflected glory. It’s tricky to time correctly but pays dividends 
if you do.
Instructional videos do well, too, but that subject really 
deserves a separate discussion because there’s an entire 
secondary market in tutorial videos.
Get the video views and those eyeballs on your work can be 
translated into cash. The YouTube Partner Program (www.
youtube.com/partners) enables you to place advertising on 
your clips and earn money for every viewing. Be aware, 
though, that it’s really tough to get in. What’s more, YouTube 
doesn’t reveal hard figures but it does publish testimonials. 
There are alternatives to YouTube that let you earn revenue 
from adverts without having to build a following first. Try sites 
like blip.tv and vimeo.com.

SELL YOUR PHOTOS
Digital photography enjoys a brilliant synergy with PCs and 
the web. Millions of us enjoy uploading pictures to photo 
sites such as Flickr, or sharing images with friends on 
Facebook and Twitter.
That’s not all you can do, though – with a little extra work, 
you could be earning cash with your camera taking stock 
photographs and selling them online. There are two markets 
in stock photography. At the high end are images produced 
by professionals. These include shots of news events, 
celebrities and difficult setups. Usage rights for these sell 
for hundreds of pounds.
Your entry point is through microstock – where royalty-free 
images are licensed for commercial use at very low prices, 
from which you take a percentage cut.
Like many other online enterprises, this is a volume 
business, with pennies per sale rather than pounds. The key is 
to create popular images that lots of people will want to use. 
Handily, several microstock sites publish guidelines revealing 
exactly what kinds of image they’re after and what they don’t 
want. iStockPhoto (www.istockphoto.com), for example, 
reveals that seasonal themes and corporate imagery are big 
sellers, while shots of fruit on white backgrounds are passé. 
However, the main requirement is that your shots should be 
well composed, at a sufficiently high resolution, well lit and in 
focus. Basic photography skills will serve you well here.
Other potential markets include Shutterpoint (www.
shutterpoint.com). This is a community-orientated stock 
repository, with a ‘stack ’em high, sell it low’ ethos that 
works well if you can produce popular images that will 
sell in volume. 
Another particularly good bet is Shutterstock (www.
shutterstock.com), a more formal and established presence 
that enables you to make up to $30 for each image sold – 
and images can be sold for use multiple times.
If you’d rather go straight for the higher end of the market, 
you can sell your photography direct to users from your own 
site. PhotoShelter (www.photoshelter.com) offers a set of 
tools that enable you to do so, taking care of digital photo 
storage and payment systems, while you have control over 
what you sell. The catch is a fixed fee, from $9.99 a month.
PUBLISH AN EBOOK
Self-published ebooks are an ideal format for niche ideas. 
Secrets of mind reading and make-up techniques of the stars 
are ideal topics. Arcane expertise could net you a profit, too. 
Perhaps you rebuilt an old car from scratch. There are probably 
a few hundred other people who’d tackle the same project with 
your guidance.
Self-publishing with ebooks is easier than ever – especially 
with iTunes and Kindle publication now real options. You don’t 
even have to create a special format for Kindle books. The 
Kindle Direct Publishing program (http://kdp.amazon.co.uk) 
accepts digital manuscripts in plain text, HTML or Microsoft 
Word DOC formats. That’s the older Word format, by the way, 
not DOCX. You can use PDF, but Amazon book publishers have 
reported problems with formatting.
There’s a form to fill in, enabling you to categorise the book, 
add an ISBN and add Digital Rights Management. Authors 
report that making changes to the submission after the fact is 
laborious, so make sure every detail is correct and your text 
has been proofread. Next you set a price and keep 70 per cent 
of the mark-up from every sale.
Formatting books for Apple iBooks – the free book store app 
for the iPad – is more involved. You need to output to the ePub 
protocol, supported in Apple’s Pages application, Adobe 
InDesign. Alternatively, you can convert to ePub using the 
open source tool Calibre. From there, the submission system is 
similar to KDP.
One final service that is more than worth a mention is 
Smashwords (www.smashwords.com). It makes the process of 
publishing to multiple formats and outlets easier – and it 
accepts digital manuscripts in DOC format. With one 
submission to Smashwords, you can have that all-important 
ISBN number sorted out and publish your book to the Nook 
and Sony’s eReader store, as well as the Smashwords site. It 
even publishes to Apple iBooks.

QUIRKY
www.quirky.com
Got a good idea but don’t know how 
to get it off the ground? That’s what 
Quirky is for. The website helps 
nurture inventions from initial 
concept through to manufacturing 
and sale. Not all ideas make it 
through the process – but Quirky 
aims to bring two new products to 
market every week. The process is 
similar to open source software 
design. Your idea is mooted to a 
community of users, and if they 
think it will be successful, they help 
with research, design and testing. 
Once it goes to market, everyone 
gets paid. Inventors receive a little 
more cash than the influencers who 
develop the design.
FIVERR
www.fiverr.com
What would you do for five dollars? 
The microworking concept is 
stretched to silly extremes with 
Fiverr, a website that allows people 
to post adverts that offer any 
service they can think of. The rule is 
that it should cost five dollars. 
You’ll find folk making Kermit the 
Frog birthday videos, creating 
one-minute voiceovers – even 
doing dream interpretation. This is 
the fun side of the Mechanical Turk 
concept. Users can post their own 
requests for tasks, too. It’s 
fascinating to see the gulf between 
what people are prepared to offer 
for $5 and what others expect to 
receive for that amount.
ELANCE
www.elance.com
Elance is the most prominent of a 
new breed of websites that enable 
prospective employers to find 
freelance workers for their creative 
projects. Designers, illustrators, 
copywriters, proofreaders, ghost 
writers, coders, developers and 
more all ply their trade here. 
Companies and individuals place 
job listings on the site, soliciting 
bids for the work from members of 
the community. Good freelancers 
who use the service build up a 
reputation on the site, using a 
system similar to the star ratings on 
eBay, so prospective employers can 
make an informed choice about the 
contractors they use.
ETSY
www.etsy.com
If you’ve never visited Etsy before, 
imagine a craft fair packed with 
stalls run by hipsters. Etsy is a 
virtual version of that. Sellers who 
sign up build their own online 
shops full of handmade jewellery, 
knitted monkeys, repurposed 
knick-knacks and art prints. For 
buyers, it’s a way to find unique and 
quirky items. For sellers, it’s a step 
up from marketing their wares on 
eBay; Etsy is a specialist outlet with 
its own identity and branding that 
transfers on to its users. Get on 
there while it’s still cool, because it 
certainly won’t be long before Etsy 
is trumped by the next trend in 
online crafts.
THREADLESS
www.threadless.com
For designers, Threadless is a 
superb showcase for their wit and 
skills. Again, there is a competitive 
edge. You submit your designs and 
the community votes for its 
favourite ones. The most popular 
designs are then made into 
T-shirts. Why put yourself through 
all that when there are websites 
such as CafePress that enable you to 
start your own T-shirt shop? 
Threadless gives you better 
exposure. It’s like putting your 
video on YouTube instead of Daily 
Motion – you’ll get more traffic, 
more hits, more kudos and more 
money. If your design is successful, 
you’ll get a cool $2,500.
KICKSTARTER
www.kickstarter.com
Kickstarter is like an online 
equivalent of Dragon’s Den, 
specialising in creative, 
entrepreneurial projects. It’s a way 
to connect people who have big, 
potentially commercial ideas with 
real investment. Every project 
comes with its own web page, 
where creators can sell the benefit 
of their idea, whether it’s an 
ice-cream business or a web 
service. Money is crowdsourced 
from Kickstarter’s community. 
Successful examples include Julia 
Nagle, a comedian with a big 
YouTube following who’s had nearly 
$60,000 pledged towards her new 
album release.

VIDEOJUG
www.videojug.com
You could make kitten juggling clips 
for YouTube and hope they go viral, 
or you could set up a profile on 
Videojug Pages and make videos 
that people want to see. The site 
specialises in video tutorials. 
Although plenty are also on 
YouTube, Videojug cuts contributors 
in on a share of the advertising 
revenue they attract. The more 
viewers, the more you’ll get paid. A 
recently introduced feature enables 
you to set up your own tutorial sites 
on Videojug, too. So, if you have 
elite skills that you can 
demonstrate in front of your 
camcorder, Videojug helps you turn 
them into cash. 
HIREWRITERS
www.hirewriters.com
There’s a good chance you write. 
Maybe you’ve got a blog on the go 
or just a penchant for stringing 
words together in a creative way. 
Good news! You can make money 
writing commissioned pieces, and 
you don’t need any experience or 
contacts. There is a downside, that 
being that you will be paid peanuts 
when you start out working for 
HireWriters, and the money doesn’t 
get much better. The maximum is 
$20 when you’re established with 
the service, so unless you’re a 
proficient and quick writer and can 
handle a lot of work without your 
brain melting, this is unlikely to 
become a way to make a living.
LULU
www.lulu.com
Kindle, Smashwords and iBooks are 
brilliant for wordy projects, but 
we’re still a while away from the 
viable coffee table ebook. At Lulu 
you can turn ebooks into real, 
tangible volumes made of paper. 
It’s ideal for image-rich tomes, and 
you can take a cut of every copy sold 
after Lulu has absorbed production 
expenses and taken its share of 
profit. Using the service takes a 
little more savvy than Kindle 
publishing. You need to create a 
PDF with a fixed layout, but Lulu 
provides templates and guides for 
all its most popular book sizes. It’s 
not the only bespoke publisher out 
there, but it’s the biggest.
CROWDOLOGY
www.crowdology.co.uk
People want to know what you 
think, so much so that they will pay 
money to hear it. Think that sounds 
ludicrous? Well, it’s not. There are 
countless services you can sign up 
for that will reward you for filling in 
sometimes long and tedious 
surveys. Crowdology is just one of 
these services, but we like it 
because you can use it the other 
way, too; if you’ve got a business 
that you’re trying to get off the 
ground, you can arrange with 
Crowdology to have one of your own 
surveys put to its eager audience of 
paid info-givers. You should be 
prepared for a few spurious 
answers, though.
PAY PER POST
www.payperpost.com
If you blog, why not get paid to 
write about advertisers’ products? 
Some people argue that reviewing 
products and services favourably, in 
exchange for money, is unethical. 
We counter that there’s not a great 
deal of difference between what Pay 
Per Post does and what affiliate 
services provide. As a blogger, you 
can choose to just write about 
products you like, and write posts 
that you would have written in any 
case. With an account on Pay Per 
Post, you are just adding to the ways 
in which you can make money from 
your blog, and because payments 
are small, you need to use as many 
methods as possible. O

The art of 
crowdfunding
All the best businesses begin 
with a brilliant idea, but many 
just stop there. Ideas remain 
ideas. This is unpleasant but 
understandable – moving 
from an epiphany in the 
shower to a fully-fledged 
product takes nerve, 
perseverance and plenty of 
cash to start the ball rolling. 
Securing finance has, of 
course, become a lot more 
difficult since the credit 
crunch. Previously, banks 
would lend money with 
comparative abandon. Today, 
From prog rock albums to computer games and glamorous gadgets, 
crowdfunding is changing the way new businesses raise funds
they’re more reticent, despite 
government interventions 
and encouragement. 
There is, however, another 
way of raising cash to fuel 
your business dream: 
crowdfunding. You’ve 
probably heard the term  
and maybe even explored  
sites such as Kickstarter  
(www.kickstarter.com). If not, 
crowdfunding enables you to 
present your business plan to 
a potentially huge audience of 
internet users. If they like 
what they see, they may help 
you finance your dream.  
As you read on, we’ll explore 
crowdfunding. We’ll look  
at how and why it started,  
and how you can use 
crowdfunding in its many 
different forms to finance 
your new business. We’ll 
explore how to access the 
crowd correctly and how to 
ensure your project makes the 
best possible start. We’ll also 
look at how you can invest in 
other people’s dreams. So, 
come with us as we explore 
the crowdfunding revolution.

THE NOT SO SILENT REVOLUTION
Crowdfunding – the business 
of borrowing cash from a pool 
or crowd of investors – is big 
business. In a recent report, 
business consultants Deloitte 
claimed that in the UK alone, 
crowdfunding portals or pools 
raised £1.9 billion of 
investment capital during 
2013. This compares with just 
under £1 billion in 2011. 
Globally, crowdfunding’s 
vital statistics are simply 
astounding. Reliable figures 
are hard to come by, but 
Kickstarter’s own metrics 
suggest its users have pledged 
$1,423,220,414 at press time. 
That’s just Kickstarter; many 
other platforms have risen 
since its inception. 
If you want further 
persuasion that crowdfunding 
is a sector you need to 
understand and watch, take 
the case of Elevation Lab. The 
company wanted to make 
docking stations for Apple 
devices. Don’t imagine some 
kind of piano-black Apple 
pastiche here, though. Think 
manufacturing processes that 
would make Rolls Royce blush 
and products that would make 
Jonathan Ive cry tears of joy. 
According to Massolution, 
Elevation’s Kickstarter 
funding drive was the first 
individual campaign to reach 
the $1 million milestone.  
In all, it pulled in a total  
of $1,464,706 from  
Kickstarter investors.
A few months later –  
in April 2012 – Pebble 
Technology, maker of 
boutique smartwatches, drew 
in $1 million of investment in 
just 28 hours. Overall, Pebble 
pulled in an amazing 
$10,266,845 of funding. 
THE HISTORY OF CROWDFUNDING 
In some regards, it’s easy to 
pass off crowdfunding as a 
reaction to, and a symptom  
of, a recession mindset. 
Crowdfunding is, however, 
much more than just a new 
wave of business people 
looking to circumvent 
tarnished banks, which  
have lost their nerve  
for investment. 
Indeed, students of 
crowdfunding’s history  
often point to the Statue of 
Liberty as an early example  
of gathering investment  
from the masses. 
Back in 1885, funding for the 
statue dried up and work 
stopped. Determined to help, 
Joseph Pulitzer – a journalist 
and publisher – announced a 
drive to raise $100,000 in New 
York’s World newspaper. 
Pulitzer promised to print  
the name of anyone who 
contributed money to the 
statue project, no matter how 
small their donation. Money 
flooded in, Pulitzer generated 
his $100,000 and work began 
once again.
Beyond tapping a crowd of 
people for small sums in the 
hope of generating a big 
tranche of capital, Pulitzer’s 
initiative was prescient for 
another reason, too. He gave a 
gift to the contributors and 
this, as we shall see, is a 
cornerstone of the way 
crowdfunding works today.

I DID IT! THE GOCARSHARE STORY
Let’s start easy: why don’t you introduce your business 
goCarShare and tell us what’s so special about it?
I had the idea for goCarShare when I was walking down the street 
close to where I live in west London. I noticed a stationary traffic 
jam, and nearly every car had only one person in it, and the whole 
situation didn’t really make a huge amount of sense.
It was at the beginning of the credit crunch, and I just felt  
that it was an opportunity to help people travel in a more 
cost-effective, sustainable way. Specifically, you could help 
people find other people who were heading the same way and 
allow them to choose who they travelled with based on Facebook 
information, such as musical taste or shared friends.
Is there something special about your business that 
makes it perfect for crowdfunding?
Our business is a community and a marketplace. For it to work 
well, it is all about getting as many people as possible to get 
involved. I think it helps that goCarShare is an exciting concept 
– it is using Facebook and it is an online solution to solve  
 
 
real-world problems, such as high travel costs, congestion and 
carbon emissions.
With crowdfunding, we are getting lots of investors involved 
who will become active proponents of the business, and who will 
help the concept spread by word of mouth.
How was the experience?
It was an amazing feeling when we reached our target – we 
managed to get 145 different people to invest in the company,  
so it is great validation.
We’ve also had a lot of people tweeting about us, and the  
press seem very interested, which is helpful for us getting the 
word out.
What advice would you give to somebody with a great 
idea and a need for funding?
Be ready for it to take much longer than you expect; a lot of 
people, myself included, underestimated the amount of time it 
takes to fundraise.
Drummond Gilbert, founder of the London-based goCarShare car-sharing site, 
recounts how he worked with the funding platform Seedrs to rev up his business

It was, however, the growth 
of the internet that gave 
crowdfunding a proper 
jumpstart. Back in 1997 – at 
around the time Internet 
Explorer 4 arrived on the 
scene – fans of the prog rock 
group Marillion raised 
$60,000 so the band could 
record a new album. The 
campaign was a success, 
Marillion made their record 
and continued to tap their 
fans to help finance their 
future projects.
Fast-forward to today and 
crowdfunding is growing at a 
huge rate. To find out more 
about the sector, we spoke 
with Julia Groves, managing 
director of the UK 
Crowdfunding Association 
(www.ukcfa.org.uk). 
“The UK Crowdfunding 
Association is a trade 
association formed in 2012  
by 12 of the leading UK 
crowdfunding platforms,” 
Groves explained. “Our 
mission is to promote 
crowdfunding as a viable  
and valuable way for UK 
businesses, projects and 
ventures to raise funds from 
the contributions of the 
people… At present, we  
have 24 members who are 
operating UK platforms, and 
10 affiliated members, which 
are pre-operational.” As we 
spoke, she explained that 
crowdfunding is very much an 
umbrella term for four key 
types of cash-generating 
approaches. The first, she

EIS
The Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) is a 
government-backed scheme designed to 
help start-ups raise cash by offering tax 
relief to investors who buy shares in them. 
Visit www.hmrc.gov.uk/eis/ for more 
information.
EQUITY
Generally, the term ‘equity’ is used to mean 
shares or an ownership interest in a 
business. An equity or share in a 
crowdfunded company, however, is not 
traded on the London Stock Exchange like 
other shares. 
EXIT
An exit is simply selling the shares you’ve 
bought in a business. You might hear this 
process of cashing-out being referred to as 
a ‘liquidity event’ or a ‘harvest strategy’.
FCA
The Financial Compliance Authority is the 
UK’s financial services regulator. It is 
endowed with rule-making, investigative 
and enforcement powers. 
LANDING PAGE
The shop-front page that explains to 
prospective investors what’s great and 
what’s unique about your project. 
SEIS
The Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme 
was designed to increase economic growth 
in the UK by promoting entrepreneurship 
and new enterprise. For more information, 
visit www.hmrc.gov.uk/seedeis/.
JARGON BUSTERS
told us, is referred to as  
the donation model. Here, 
supporters simply give cash  
to a start-up and don’t have 
any expectation of a return. 
Just Giving’s Yimby.com is a 
prime example of this style  
of working. 
Next up, we have reward-
based crowdfunding, where 
givers donate with the 
expectation of receiving 
something in return. 
This style of funding was 
embraced by David Braben, a 
man famous in computer 
gaming circles as the co-
maker of the 1980s classic 
space-trading game, Elite. In 
an effort to fund a remake of 
the game – Elite: Dangerous 
– Braben launched a 
Kickstarter campaign. A 
donation of 10 pounds bought 
you a regular newsletter and 
updates on the project. If you 
gave 30 pounds, you’d receive 
a digital copy of the finished 
game. Contribute more and 
you’d get bigger and better

returns. In all, the project 
pulled in over £1.5 million in 
donations, and Elite: Dangerous 
is now on sale, with several 
expansion packs available too. 
If you’re interested in this 
kind of funding, Groves 
pointed to Crowdfunder, 
Indiegogo, Zequs and 
Sponsorcraft (now Hubbub) as 
firms that you could explore. 
Next up is the loan or debt 
model. Here a business 
borrows its funding and 
promises to repay the money 
with interest. Abundance 
Generation, Funding Circle, 
Funding Empire, Money&Co 
and Trillion Fund offer 
start-ups access to this kind 
of funding. 
The fourth type of 
crowdfunding is equity 
funding. Here, Groves told us, 
“Support is provided in return 
for an equity stake [or share] 
in the business.” Funding 
platforms such as Crowdcube, 
Seedrs, Angels Den and 
Syndicate Room embrace this 
kind of model.
 
PICKING THE RIGHT PLATFORM 
Choosing the correct 
crowdfunding platform can 
appear daunting, particularly 
when you add in another type 
of platform: hybrid. Here a 
funding platform might offer 
a mix of donation, gift, debt 
and equity based deals. 
So, how do you pick the 
right fund for your business? 
Groves explained: “One of the 
real beauties of crowdfunding 
is that not only can you raise 
money but you can galvanise 
an army of ambassadors who 
will feel connected and part of 
your project. If you plan to 
operate your business in the 
UK, then having such a 
supporter base here in the UK 
will probably better serve your 
needs than a US platform.”
Beyond patriotism and 
convenience, there are also 
legal considerations to bear in 
mind. Groves told us: “Also, 
you need to be aware that in 
terms of equity crowdfunding, 
the UK is the world leader and 
this is largely down to 
supportive regulation. The US 
does not currently allow 
equity crowdfunding by 
ordinary investors, so you 
really need to consider where 
you intend to be based and, 
indeed, where your future 
customers will be based, who 
may well turn out to be your 
biggest investor fans.”
It’s also worth considering 
how the individual 
crowdfunding platforms make 
their cash, too. Most of them 
charge commission. Rates 
typically vary from around  
3.5 to 8 per cent.
So, when looking for a 
funding platform, you’ll need 
to choose between donation, 
gift, equity, debt and hybrid 
platforms. Which one is right 
for your business comes down 
to your personal ethics, 
ambition and the type of 
project you’re planning.

LEGAL IMPLICATIONS
Why don’t you introduce yourself?
I’m a lawyer for Pinsent Masons and Out-Law.com, having spent 
most of my career looking into technology, data protection and 
intellectual property law issues. As the business models of more 
and more banks, insurers and other financial services firms 
become dependent on technology, I’m finding that I am 
spending more and more time assessing the legal implications 
of the intersect between technology and financial services.
Is a crowdfunding campaign something a new 
entrepreneur can manage themselves without specific 
professional legal advice?  
In the UK, it is important to determine whether or not a 
crowdfunding platform is authorised to provide financial 
services in accordance with financial services regulation. Not all 
crowdfunding platforms necessarily need to be. For example, 
pure donation and rewards-based platforms may not. Other 
platforms can take advantage of statutory exemptions, which 
allow certain financial services related activities to be performed 
without authorisation. But if entrepreneurs use unregulated 
platforms, they should make sure that they are not being 
involved in illegal activities, such as the making of unauthorised 
financial promotions, failing to provide adequate risk warnings, 
or issuing shares or other forms of financial security without 
authorisation.
What are the key responsibilities a start-up has towards 
people who fund it through a crowd-based platform? 
It depends on the type of platform. Generally, an entrepreneur 
must be clear about what he or she is committing to, and be 
prepared to honour those commitments. While it is often 
suggested that 50 to 70 per cent of start-ups fail, this does not 
mean that an entrepreneur will escape liability if he or she fails 
to meet commitments given. If, for instance, the entrepreneur 
has failed to set up a legal entity for the project, it is possible 
that funders could bring a claim against him or her personally.
 
 
 
Do responsibilities change if you’ve raised funds by 
selling equity, as opposed to soliciting donations 
accompanied by the promise of a gift (perhaps a free 
copy of the product you’re trying to make)?
The nature of your commitments will be different. Equity 
investments result in the creation of a particular type of legal 
relationship to which some specific obligations attach. 
Essentially, though, it is best to view all obligations to investors 
as legal obligations, no matter what incentive you have provided 
for investing. Be transparent about the risks of investing in your 
business, the barriers and the likelihood of success. Ensure that 
you understand everything you have committed to in writing.
What is the best way to protect yourself if your  
business fails?
It is important to ensure that you have set up a legal entity that 
separates your personal liability from that of your business or 
project, and you should observe general principles of good 
business practice. For example, no matter what the project, it is 
preferable if you use a crowdfunding platform that enables 
investors to track their money, where it is kept and transactions 
that have taken place.
And, looking down the other end of the rifle, what rights 
do you have if you’ve invested in a company that fails?
Well, the risks can include a total loss of investment; the lack of 
a secondary market for investments means that funders could 
have to wait until a management buy-out, a flotation or the sale 
of the business takes place before getting a return. In some 
instances, an equity investment may be diluted. Given these 
risks, the Financial Conduct Authority is proposing that only 
certain categories of investors (‘sophisticated investors’, ‘high 
net worth investors’, those who have received regulated 
financial investment advice, and some others) be able to engage 
in equity crowdfunding in the future. The FCA is consulting on 
this matter at the moment.
Crowdfunding is a serious business. We talk with Luke Scanlon, a technology lawyer, 
about your legal duties and responsibilities when accessing crowd cash

58  |   Start your own business
When you’ve decided upon 
the type of funding you’d like 
to use, you need to find a 
funding website or platform 
that supports it. This can 
appear daunting, because 
there’s an ever-expanding 
number of funding platforms 
to choose between. You can 
find a handy list of firms  
on the UK Crowdfunding 
Association’s website –  
www.ukcfa.org.uk/members.
NICE TO MEET YOU 
Your initial approach to a 
platform is then very 
important. We spoke to  
Alysia Wanczyk, Seedrs’ 
marketing director, about 
what actually happens when 
an entrepreneur and a funding 
platform meet each other for 
the first time. 
She explained, “Once a 
business completes their 
online investment campaign, 
it comes through to our review 
team. The team then goes 
through and initially rejects 
any campaigns that are 
patently unviable, incomplete 
or plain silly. Those that 
proceed are carefully reviewed 
to ensure that every 
statement they make is fair, 
Like the sound of crowdfunding? Then read 
on to find out how to get started
Get the  
ball rolling
clear, not-misleading  
and truthful.” 
Unlike eBay, where the 
process of adding sales  
posts or landing pages is 
highly automated, Seedrs’ 
registration system is much 
more human.  
Wanczyk continued: “This 
[checking process] often 
requires a bit of a back-and-
forth email and phone 
exchange between us and the 
entrepreneur, to ensure we 
receive supporting evidence 
for every statement. Once 
both parties are happy with 
the campaign, we set it live to 
potential investors to review 
– with the peace of mind that 
what they’re reading is 
reliable. From there, it is up to 
investors to look around, ask 
questions and decide for 
themselves if a business is 
worth investing in.”
PASS OR FAIL?
Funding campaigns usually 
last for around three months, 
Wanczyk told us. The question 
is, of course, what happens if 
you’re successful? We asked 
Wanczyk whether the cheque 
arrives the next day. She 
explained: “Once a campaign

HOW TO INVEST 
FOR PROFIT
Let’s be clear: investing in start-ups is incredibly 
risky. The Financial Conduct Authority suggests 
that 50 to 70 per cent of new enterprises fail. But 
with risk, of course, comes reward. And it’s for this 
reason that crowdfunding is sometimes viewed as 
a goldmine by canny investors. So, if you’re sitting 
on some cash, how can you turn a profit? 
Seedrs’ Alysia Wanczyk explained the rules of 
investing via her platform: “Adults over the age of 
18 who pass our investment authorisation 
questionnaire or self-certify as high net worth or 
sophisticated can invest.” Assuming you satisfy 
the questionnaire’s requirements – a document 
prepared with the FCA, so not to be taken lightly 
– you can invest anything from £10 up via Seedrs. 
Julia Groves of the UK Crowdfunding 
Association told us about her approach to 
investing: “My rules are: I have a fixed amount of 
money I invest each business year – money I can 
afford to lose.” She also viewed investing in 
different products, to spread risk, as important. 
Finally, she told us to invest in things you know 
about and want to support. “I can and do put as 
much money as I can into renewable energy, 
because I have been working in that sector for 10 
years and I am an environmentalist.” 
Bill Morrow from Angels Den (www.angelsden.
com) also explained the importance of investing in 
firms who have SEIS (Seed Enterprise Investment 
Scheme) and EIS (Enterprise Investment Scheme) 
approval. He told us: “Having SEIS or EIS approval 
makes a business so much more investable, 
because it offers huge tax benefits for UK 
investors. Most investors will want SEIS or EIS 
deals to make up a significant part of their 
portfolio. It also means that you don’t get taxed 
when you exit the business.” 
Also, consider dilution. In the first round of 
funding, you may buy 10 per cent of a firm. But as 
they grow, start-ups tend to launch other fund- 
raising drives. If they do, they may issue more 
shares, meaning you’ll be left holding a reduced 
proportion of the whole. And with a reduction in 
holding comes a reduction in dividend income.
has hit its funding target, we 
conduct a further due 
diligence process to ensure 
that all legal and structural 
matters are in order with the 
company. It is all very 
straightforward.” What this 
boils down to is essentials 
such as registering the 
company with Companies 
House, setting up a company 
bank account, and completing 
taxation documents. And if 
you’re not so lucky? Wanczyk 
told us, “If a start-up doesn’t 
reach their target [within 
three months], their 
campaign is taken down and 
each of the investors is given 
their investment back and 
notified. Sometimes, a 
business is given feedback 
from investors and potential 
investors and they take down 
the campaign themselves to 
change it and re-submit it.”

THE ANATOMY OF A LANDING PAGE
The landing page is a 
crowdfunding project’s shop 
window. It’s where an 
entrepreneur hopes to catch 
the eye of an investor and 
quickly persuade them to  
get their chequebook out. 
There are lots of different 
crowdfunding websites, so 
landing pages will all look 
subtly different. There are, 
however, some essential 
pieces of information that 
occur across nearly all the 
different platforms.
Here are the key elements 
that you will need to think 
about when building your  
own landing page.
PROJECT NAME
Give your project a 
pithy but immediately 
obvious name. Don’t 
try to be too clever  
or investors might  
be confused.
UPDATES
Crowdfunding is all 
about building a 
community. As  
your funding drive 
develops, it’s a good 
idea to post blog-style 
or video updates about 
the successes that 
you’re having.
COMMENTS
It’s important that 
entrepreneurs talk 
with their investors, 
allaying their fears and 
feeding their interest.

your project.
PLEDGE AND GOAL
Here you’ll see how 
much money has been 
promised and the 
funding target you 
need to meet. Hit your 
target and all the funds 
will be released. Miss 
your target and you 
may get nothing.
TIME TICKER
Most funding drives 
last for a few months. 
Your landing page will 
have a countdown 
ticker that shows how 
much time investors 
have left.
THE ENTREPRENEUR
Projects aren’t just 
about products, 
they’re about people. 
You need to be the face 
of your project and 
champion it at every 
possible opportunity.
THE VIDEO
There’s no better way 
than using a video to 
communicate your 
pitch and its key 
points. Project videos 
are usually three 
minutes long.
THE PROMISE
A product pitch needs 
to identify a problem 
and explain how it will 
solve that problem. 
You need to think hard 
about your project’s 
pitch and promise.

Planning, persuasion and research are essential 
ingredients of a successful crowdfunding campaign
8 tips to make your 
campaign a success
RESEARCH, RESEARCH, RESEARCH
You need to understand the market you’re 
planning to launch into. This means 
scoping out your competitors and any 
hurdles that might need to be overcome. In 
essence, think about doing a SWOT analysis 
of your idea (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
SWOT_analysis). Going through this 
process is essential because you’ll most 
definitely be quizzed about these sorts of 
business fundamentals as you progress 
from the idea stage through to funding. 
And don’t think investors will go easy on 
you just because you’ve never been through 
the process before. Investors will certainly 
have lost money before and they’ll be 
mustard keen to avoid doing so again.
GET THINKING STRAIGHT
An idea doesn’t have any value, no matter 
how good it is. It is the execution of the idea 
that creates value. So, don’t get hung up on 
your initial concept. Rather, think and talk 
about the business that you’re building 
around the idea. You should also be able to 
explain your business succinctly, maybe in 
just one sentence. Be sure you can explain 
the problem you’re looking to solve and 
how your business will solve it. If an 
investor doesn’t understand your business 
– even if it’s amazing – they’ll pass it by. 
Your business’s reasons for being – its 
mission statement - should be echoed 
consistently across all communication 
channels at all times.
RAISE JUST WHAT YOU WANT
Spending other people’s money is fun, but 
you’ll have to pay it back. So, it pays to 
work out exactly how much money your 
business is going to need. This means you 
will have to pay less back and, also, it will 
serve to convince prospective investors. 
Anyone looking to invest their own money 
in a project is much more likely to trust 
somebody who can show that they’re 
serious about cash management. So, get 
your calculator out, fire up Excel and then 
work out the exact sum of money your 
business needs to work, and – at this stage 
– no more.
PLANNING AND MILESTONES
Taking a project from an idea to a fully-
fledged business can seem very daunting. 
For this reason, Tim Davies – investment 
director of Seedrs (http://blog.seedrs.
com/2012/05/) – writes about giving 
yourself a series of achievable goals. 
Beyond providing you with both 
encouragement and direction, having a 
solid plan also looks good to investors. You 
might, for example, raise capital so you can 
achieve phase one, and then return to the 
funding market and ask for cash to begin 
phase two. If the first chapter of your 
business story was a success and your 
investors are happy, you should find it 
easier to entice a second wave.

MAKE A VIDEO
The most potent way to tell your business’s 
story to prospective investors is to make a 
video. You don’t need to make an epic – 
consider three minutes the maximum 
length of time you have to convince people. 
When you’re planning your video, ensure 
you communicate your business’s key 
pledges and the problems you’re looking to 
solve very clearly. It also helps to have a 
logo at this point, too, because it conveys 
permanence and solidity. If you’d like more 
guidance about making your video, head 
over to Videohive (http://bit.ly/17HwfIX). 
There you’ll find some excellent resources. 
(All that thinking and research you did in 
steps one and two should come in handy!)
DON’T GO LIVE JUST YET 
Veequo founder Matt Warren – writing on 
his firm’s blog (http://bit.ly/15cz7eK) – 
offers a great tip. Before you launch your 
funding campaign, talk with your friends 
and family, and persuade them to promise 
some small contributions. When your 
campaign does go live, their financial 
support will give your project an instant 
lift. This is beneficial because investors 
don’t generally like to be the first to pledge 
money. Rather, they prefer to see a project 
that’s already generating some momentum 
and is already going somewhere. So, don’t 
hurry into going live as soon as you can. It 
pays to get some early, pre-backers primed 
and ready first.
DON’T FORGET OFFLINE, TOO
It’s easy to rely purely on digital promotion 
to promote digital products. There is, 
however, no substitute for getting out and 
meeting prospective investors face to face. 
There are lots of meet-ups where new 
businesses can network with professional 
investors. To find out about such gatherings 
near you, try visiting http://lanyrd.com. It’s 
a site that chronicles a huge number of 
professional events that happen around the 
world. In many regards, it’s the ultimate 
diary. Alternatively, look up Silicon 
Roundabout on www.meetup.com, log on 
to http://citymeetstech.com, and research 
Seedrs’ Monthly Mixer. The point is, don’t 
just sit back and expect investors to find 
you – there’s a dizzying array of projects 
vying for their attention. 
EMBRACE SOCIAL MEDIA
When your campaign is up and running, 
you need to be able to create a real buzz 
around it. Just sending out a press release is 
probably not going to be enough. You need 
to be fanning the flames with social media. 
There is, of course, a huge number of 
platforms to choose from. If you have 
limited resources, you need to focus your 
attention on the ones that investment 
professionals are likely to use: LinkedIn 
and Twitter. Get your team involved, too. 
The key is to have a constant output of 
messages. Don’t splurge and then go quiet. 
And don’t view social media as a one-way 
street. Talk with people who take the time 
to message you.

There’s little doubt that crowdfunding can be an incredibly effective 
way to raise cash, but where many succeed, others inevitably fail…
Greatest triumphs 
and failures
OUYA 
Funding target: $950,000
Sum raised: $8,596,474 
Ouya billed its device as “a new kind of 
video game console”. The small, silver box 
was powered by the Android operating 
system and fans really bought into the idea. 
In all, a total of 63,416 backers helped the 
project rocket past its funding goal of 
around $1m. While product itself didn’t 
quite live up to expectations, it did at least 
appear post-funding.
NFC RING 
Funding target: £30,000
Sum raised: £241,947
The NFC Ring is proof that geeks love 
funding technology products that solve 
real-life problems. The device is a clever 
piece of jewellery that enables you to 
unlock everything from your phone to 
specially designed locks. Just tap them with 
the ring and you’re in. A pledge of just £8 
bought you 3D printing plans, while £18 got 
you a ring and the app.
MOTORCYCLE-POWERED CHARIOT 
Funding target: $40,000
Sum raised: $50
Watch out Ben-Hur, or maybe not. This 
creative, petrol-headed entrepreneur 
dreamed of making a street-legal chariot 
that could be pulled along by a motorbike. 
The plan was to give the charioteer full 
control of the bike’s steering, throttle and 
brakes, while the rider himself was 
standing in the attached chariot. 
Thankfully, the crowd saw sense.
UBUNTU EDGE
Funding target: $32,000,000
Sum raised: $12,814,216
Ubuntu Edge was to be a smartphone that 
doubled as a desktop computer. Not shy of 
technical ambition, its makers were also 
brave crowdfunders. The group set out to 
raise $32m, which is a world record for a 
fixed funding campaign. In the event, over 
20,000 people pledged cash totalling just 
shy of $13m. It seems harsh to call Ubuntu 
Edge a failure…

THE VERONICA MARS MOVIE PROJECT 
Funding target: $2,000,000
Sum raised: £5,702,153
A colossal 91,585 backers helped push this 
movie project well past its funding target of 
two million dollars. If you’re looking for a 
blueprint for a successful funding drive, 
this is one to study. The team embraced the 
whole playbook: social networking, video 
and merchandising. During the life of 
the funding campaign, they made 
nearly 60 campaign updates.
PEBBLE E-PAPER WATCH 
Funding target: $100,000
Sum raised: $10,266,845
The Pebble smartwatch is ground-breaking 
in many ways. Technically, it’s the perfect 
companion for your smartphone. At its 
most basic, it manages calls. If you’re 
adventurous, you can even develop apps for 
it. The Pebble is also the first funding 
project to smash the $1m barrier, which it 
did at a canter. 
NEW YORK CITY OPERA
Funding target: $1,000,000
Sum raised: £301,019
The majority of large-scale crowdfunding 
campaigns are for technology projects. 
However, facing deep financial problems, 
the New York City Opera turned to 
Kickstarter in the hope of boosting its 
flagging fortunes. Sadly, the drive, which 
hoped to raise $1m, fell well short of its 
target, netting just over $301,000.
DARCI’S WALK OF SHAME
Funding target: $2,000,000 
Sum raised: $51,605
Melissa Joan Hart – the star of television’s 
Sabrina The Teenage Witch – hoped to tap the 
crowd to fund her new TV series. Called 
Darci’s Walk Of Shame, the show was penned 
as a romantic comedy. Sadly, however, 
Melissa’s legions of fans obviously 
preferred seeing her in more familiar  
roles, and the project fell well short of  
its $2m goal. O

A £5,000 project for one client could easily be a £20,000 job 
for another. So how do you know how much to charge?
Set the  
right rates
One of the biggest mistakes a 
commissioned company can 
make is not to bill enough for 
its work. But every project is 
different, so what’s the best 
way to calculate your fee? 
A lot of elements come  
into the equation: project 
specification, usage and 
rights, your level of expertise, 
turnaround time, overhead 
costs, expenses and how 
much you feel the final project 
will be worth – not to mention 
how badly you want the job. 
Your reputation has a value, 
too, which will affect your 
billable rate. You know you’re 
a talented business, so reflect 
that in your pricing structure. 
But first? Determine your base 
fee. Here’s how…
PRICING THE NINE-TO-FIVE
The most basic form of billing 
is an hourly rate. Essentially, 
it’s the value of your work 
time based on the number of 
hours spent on a project, 
inclusive of all calculable 
expenses. It works well for 
smaller companies because it 
factors in various overhead 
costs such as staff wages, 
premises and so on. It’s also 
flexible for more open-ended 
jobs, where a client might 
request several revisions after 
the initial work is done.
CLEVER CALCULATIONS
Broadly speaking, an hourly or 
daily rate can be calculated  
by taking your annual 
business costs (include 
absolutely everything that’s 
necessary to run your 
business, from your 
accountancy, legal and 
banking fees to annual 
insurance and travel costs, 
utility fees, any promotion 
and marketing, and also 
non-accountable costs, such 
as filing fees for tax returns), 
adding your desired yearly 
pre-tax income (be realistic) 
and dividing by your annual 
billable time, remembering  
to factor in both holiday and 
sick days. 
WORK IN THE EXTRAS
While an hourly rate is sound, 
it can mask the true cost of 
work and planning, omit 
usage fees and doesn’t 
necessarily take into account 
any extra expenses that might 
be incurred – the price of 
materials, for example. 
However, it does give a 
simple, justifiable set fee, 
which many businesses  
use as a basis on which to 
generate their initial quote. 
Any extra time or expenses 
incurred outside of this are 
scrupulously recorded and 
billed for in the final fee.
FLATTEN IT
Charging a flat fee for a 
project, based on your hourly 
rate multiplied by the time 
the job takes, can work well 
for regular work when you 
have a good idea of the time 
involved – a regular 
production of a similar item, 
say. But if the client suddenly 
demands endless rounds of 
time-sapping revisions, then 
your company is immediately 
out of pocket. Be very clear 
about what you are prepared 
to do when negotiating a flat 
fee. As with an hourly fee, 
make sure that you’re able  
to adapt to any changing 
project demands; don’t be 
afraid to revisit your original 

Start your own business  |  69 
ROYALTIES
In any job involving royalties paid to you for use of your 
work – on clothing, for instance – ensure the terms are 
made absolutely clear. The ‘normal’ royalty rate is 
anywhere between two and ten per cent of the item’s 
retail price, depending on the item. Rates can increase 
after a certain number of items have been sold, too. 
Negotiating royalties can be tricky, so it’s always best to 
consult your accountant or legal advisor beforehand.

estimate if the requirements 
of a project change – this 
should be written into your 
terms and conditions. 
NAME YOUR PRICE
It isn’t just about charging for 
time – your professional 
reputation hangs on your 
ability and prowess, so factor 
your unique skills into your 
fee. As your company’s 
reputation or size grows, it 
might make more sense to 
move to a more ad hoc 
approach to billing; that is, 
varying it from client to client 
and project to project. 
WHAT’S THE BUDGET?
This becomes particularly 
relevant once you know that 
the client has approached you 
specifically for the distinctive 
style of your business. In this 
case, you know they’re willing 
to pay for that style, enabling 
you, to some extent, to name 
your price. Similarly, if you 
know your client is working 
with a sizeable budget, an ad 
hoc approach will enable you 
to take this into account when 
calculating a fee.

Invest time in 
terms & conditions
EXPLAIN PAYMENT TERMS
Include information about how and when 
you will deliver, and how and when you 
want to be paid (30 or 60 days from the 
date of the invoice, for instance).
ACCOUNT FOR LATE PAYMENTS
Assert your right to charge interest on late 
payments, and include a cancellation and 
rejection fee clause.
KNOW WHEN TO TERMINATE
Specify when and how you can terminate a 
brief with a client. Such provisions usually 
state that either party may terminate the 
agreement with a set period of notice; and 
detail when it can be ended immediately, 
such as failure to make payment.
NEGLECT YOUR RIGHTS
Make sure you have retention of title and 
retention of copyright clauses in your 
T&Cs. These mean that no rights will be 
transferred until you receive full payment. 
WAIT UNTIL IT’S TOO LATE
To legally incorporate your T&Cs, they 
must be included at the point of contract. 
Email them to prospective clients when 
responding to an initial enquiry and also on 
accepting a brief. 
FORGET SPECIAL TERMS
If a client insists an agreement is subject to 
its standard terms, read the contract 
carefully. If necessary, try to negotiate 
some special terms in writing that protect 
your business primarily. Don’t put yourself 
at risk.

Being in control of what’s flowing in and out of your 
bank account is vital if you want to be a success
&DVKįRZ
is king
WHAT’S IN THE BANK?
Perhaps a more important 
question is: what’s coming 
out of the bank? And when is 
that going to happen? Even if  
you don’t handle the day-to-
day finances yourself in detail, 
having an overall view  
of your company’s money 
matters at any given time is 
crucial – you are the one in 
charge, after all.
INVOICE IN DETAIL
When invoicing, make your 
payment terms very clear, 
both in terms of when you’ll 
be paid and how – a direct 
transfer, for example, is much 
quicker than a cheque. Ensure 
the client doesn’t have any 
unusual or lengthy payment 
clauses that they might have 
‘forgotten’ to mention. For 
more top invoicing tips, turn 
the page.
STAGGER PAYMENT
Whenever possible, try to 
negotiate an up-front 
payment, particularly when 
working on a fixed-cost 
project. This can help 
massively with your cash  
flow, and will be a lifesaver if 
anything delays the project or 
if you incur further expenses. 
But don’t get into the 
situation of relying on these 
kinds of payments just to pay 
the bills.
SET ASIDE TAX
No, that doesn’t mean 
ignoring it… You need to 
make sure that you budget 
monthly for your tax bill, 
which will be paid once or 
twice yearly, depending on 
your situation. Unpaid tax is 
not only a massive financial 
worry, it can also snowball 
due to penalty charges and 
interest on the amount due.
PAY YOUR STAFF FIRST
Your team members should 
take priority over any other 
expenses, so always pay them 
first, followed by any 
freelancers or other 
outsourced contractors. Pay 
other bills as soon as you can 
– you don’t want your team to 
be homeless. As the business 
owner, your own wage should 
be the last one that comes out 
of the bank account.
ADD INTEREST
The Late Payment of 
Commercial Debts (Interest) 
Act 1998 means that UK 
businesses are entitled to 
charge interest on late 
payments after a certain 
period of time. In the US, the 
law is made at state level. 
Consult your legal advisor 
about this. Clearly, though, 
this is something to be used 
as a last resort because it’s 
unlikely to endear the client 
in question to you.

clever invoicing
MAKE IT EASY
Every invoice should have a job reference, 
your postal address, an email address and 
the amount, with a tax breakdown if 
appropriate. If you run a limited company, 
you need to list the registered office – often 
that of your accountant – your company 
number and, in the UK, your VAT number.
VET YOUR CLIENTS
If you’re concerned, research a client before 
taking on a job. Check with allied or similar 
businesses for stories of late payment. In 
the UK, Companies House will supply its 
most recent accounts for a small fee and 
you can also check online for any county 
court judgements against them.
HOW WILL THEY PAY?
Find out how every new client will pay. In 
the UK, direct electronic BACS payment is 
popular; include your account name, sort 
code and account number on your invoice. 
For cheques, your business name is 
enough. Smaller clients might offer PayPal, 
but you’ll lose about five per cent of the fee. 
AGREE TERMS
Standard payment terms are 30 or 60 days 
from delivery; the same applies if work is 
broken up into delivery stages. If you don’t 
get a contract, send an email stating your 
terms and explain that late payment 
attracts interest. If you don’t, legally 
speaking you’ll have accepted their terms.

STAY ON TOP
Always keep track of who owes what and 
when the money is due. At the very least, 
you need a list of projects, amounts due, 
invoice dates, the dates when you sent the 
invoices and those who’ve paid up. Keeping 
on top of your own finances is important, 
even if you employ an accountant.
CHASE LATE PAYMENT
An extra month is cheeky, but not unusual. 
If payment is a week late, make a call to 
find out why, then repeat this process every 
seven days. If payment is a month late, 
send a repeat invoice and statement of 
account, along with a reminder that 
interest is payable on any late settlements.
TAKE LEGAL ACTION
After three months, send the company a 
repeat statement or invoice, with interest 
included, and threaten legal action in the 
local small claims court. Call again 
immediately afterwards. Allow a couple of 
weeks, call and email them one last time, 
then start legal proceedings.
VERY LATE PAYMENT
In the UK, small companies are legally 
entitled to claim interest of eight per cent 
over the base rate for late payment, plus a 
fixed compensation fee and debt-recovery 
costs. You can find calculators online that 
work this out for you. Check your state laws 
in the US if considering this option.

If you intend to keep your financial affairs 
in-house, it pays to keep things simple
Everyday 
accounting
Bookkeeping is a legal 
requirement. But from a 
business perspective, being 
able to balance the books is 
also fundamental for 
controlling your cash flow and 
keeping your business afloat. 
Fortunately, bread-and-
butter bean-counting and 
basic financial forecasting 
aren’t difficult – you simply 
need to know what’s coming 
in and what’s going out, and 
be prepared to make financial 
decisions as soon as the need 
arises. From managing your 
company’s daily accounts to 
budgeting and planning for 
the future, read on for how to 
keep your business on track.
IN AND OUT
While your accountant can 
handle the broader side of 
your finances, you need to 
have a good grasp of exactly 
what money is coming in and 
what expenses are going out.
Smaller companies often 
find that basic bookkeeping is 
practical to do in-house. 
Whether you do this yourself 
or another member of the 
team handles it depends on 
your patience with 
accounting. Regardless, as a 
company director you should 
check the accounts regularly.
Bookkeeping involves 
keeping a record of what 
money is coming in and from 
whom, what is due to come in 
and when, and your outgoing 
expenses. The latter includes 
things such as rent, wages, 
software/hardware purchases, 
materials costs, fancy herbal 
tea bags… Anything and 
Make accounting

WHAT’S WHAT?
In short, UK sole traders and partnerships are charged income tax on 
their profits; limited companies are charged corporation tax on profits, 
with employees charged income tax on their income. In the UK, if your 
firm turns over more than £82k in a financial year, you also have to 
register for VAT. It’s complicated but a good accountant will ensure you 
get it right and advise on what can be claimed.
ASK AROUND
Like good builders and plumbers (there are a few), accountants thrive 
on good word-of-mouth to gain new business. Ask other similar 
businesses in your local area for recommendations. Usually, people are 
only too pleased to share positive experiences with financial pros, just 
as they are more than likely to warn you off incompetent ones. 
SEEK OFFICIAL BODIES
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (www.
icaew.co.uk), the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (www.
icas.org.uk), the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
(www.aicpa.org) and the Association of International Accountants 
(www.aiaworldwide.com) will advise on any accountant-based queries.
DON’T CHOOSE ON PRICE
Always find out how much – and when – an accountant will charge. 
They normally bill by the hour, although some opt for annually – but 
many will be flexible about payment terms. Bear in mind that while a 
partner in a firm will cost more than a junior member, it’s all about 
service. You need someone who will tell you the truth without being 
patronising or intimidating.
GET IT IN WRITING
Once you’ve appointed an accountant, make sure they send you their 
terms and conditions, and specify precisely what they will do for you. A 
good one will be in touch regularly, not just at tax time. Similarly, you 
should contact them as soon as possible to let them know of any 
problems, queries or change of circumstances. Don’t be afraid to ask 
seemingly stupid financial questions.
OUTSOURCE OR NOT?
As your business grows, you might prefer to hand over more of the daily 
financial affairs to an accountant. Larger firms will handle everything 
from data input and VAT to staff payment. Alternatively, services such 
as Mazuma let you do your accounts online – including invoicing, 
expenses, payments and tax – through a web-based app for a fixed fee.

Taxes are an integral part of your budget process but they can 
present a legal minefield. Unless you have an excellent grip on 
exactly what you’re liable for, you’ll need a good accountant
everything related to the 
business should be recorded.
THE NUMBERS GAME
At the most basic, 
bookkeeping can be done with 
an accounts book, but this 
isn’t ideal as mistakes can be 
made and it’s not particularly 
flexible. A better bet is to use 
a spreadsheet in a program 
such as Excel, which has 
templates that you can alter if 
necessary. Once you get more 
familiar with a spreadsheet, 
you can start using the more 
sophisticated functions for 
financial planning.
Or you could invest in 
dedicated financial software. 
You can use a cheaper and less 
complex online service, paid 
for monthly, or invest in a full 
package, which keeps track of 
income, VAT, payroll and so 
on. The learning curve can be 
steep, but it’s time well spent.
PAID WITH THANKS?
Send out invoices as soon as 
you’ve completed a job, and 
keep a record of when that 
money is due. If payment is 
delayed, contact the client as 
soon as possible. Invoices can 
get lost, or held up for reasons 
that might not have been 
passed back to you.
HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS
As a limited company in the 
UK, you’re required by law to 
keep all paperwork, such as 
invoices, receipts and 
financial records, for the past 
six years (five years for a 
partnership). If the Inland 
Revenue finds these records 
aren’t available, you could be 
in for a stiff penalty. Back up 
and archive all electronic 
records and paperwork.

You don’t just need to know how much money 
you’ve got – you need to plan for the future, too
Financial  
planning
As well as dealing with 
day-to-day finances and 
accounting, you also need a 
sound financial plan in place 
for the future. This is a 
forecast of how much you 
expect income to be versus 
how much your outgoings are. 
Ideally, you want the former 
to rise as your business 
develops, while keeping the 
latter fairly constant 
throughout the short term. 
PLAN A SENSIBLE BUDGET
Begin with a list of overheads 
and admin expenses. This 
includes things such as rent, 
utilities (if not included in the 
rent), computers, software, 
office equipment (desks, 
chairs, printers and so on), 
legal and accounting 
expenses, staff wages, 
insurance and everything else 
that you’ll be paying out on a 
regular basis. You’ll probably 
also want to factor in any 
promotional and publicity 
costs for helping spread the 
word about your business and 
increasing your exposure. 
Next, work up projected 
income statements for the 
next month, three months, 
year and then the next three 
years. It will be tricky to judge 
a typical month’s income 
during the early days but try 
to be as realistic as you can.
Comparing the two amounts 
gives you your profit – or, as 
will inevitably be the case for 
perhaps the first year of 
business, your loss. On a 
monthly basis check that 
these figures are roughly 
within your target plan and 
that the business is growing 
as you forecast it would. It’s 
vital to constantly review in 
this way, and even more vital 
to act on the results if they’re 
not as good as they should be.
ARE YOU ON TRACK?
If your profit is drastically 
lower than you anticipated, or 
a loss much greater, you’ll 
need to make changes to your 
business plan. If it doesn’t 
look as though you’ll have 
enough work coming in, you 
might want to ramp up your 
PR to drum up more business, 
for example. Or, there might 
be areas where you can cut 
back on spending – perhaps 
by using fewer outsourced 
freelancers, or putting off a 
planned software upgrade. 
The one thing you can’t afford 
to do is bury your head in the 
sand and hope for the best, 
even in the short term. The 
first three years are the most 
crucial to any small business, 
because that’s when the 
failure rates are highest.
As with your day-to-day 
bookkeeping, project 
management software will 
help you stay on top of your 
plans by keeping track of time 
and money spent on existing 
projects, as well as making 
forecasts for the future. A 
typical package can track 
hours worked on a project, 
expenses for individuals and 
more, and many can tie into 
your day-to-day accounting 
software, such as Sage. There 
are lots of options available, 
so check out the list opposite 
for a closer look at some key 
options. These aren’t your 
only choices – you could also 
try going free…
Base current 
spend on current 
income, not 
future income. 
Consider 
personal financial 
protection, in the 
event that you 
can’t work for  
any reason.
Underestimate 
the importance of 
cash flow, or turn 
a blind eye to 
shortfalls in your 
financial 
predictions.

No matter your budget or focus, a plethora of project 
management packages exist to take the edge off

spotlight
SOLO
From £10/month   www.thrivesolo.com
As the name implies, Solo is designed for 
“the modern freelancer” – but it could also 
work for smaller businesses. It has project 
management functionality, a somewhat 
basic planner, invoicing and timesheet 
tools, and a barebones contacts section. 
STREAMTIME
£29/month   www.streamtime.net
At £29 per month, per user, this project 
management heavyweight is good value. It 
includes resource planning, timesheets, a 
quoting tool, CRM and integration with 
popular accounting software. There’s no 
asset management or versioning, though.
BASECAMP
Starts at $29/month   www.basecamp.com
Basecamp’s relative simplicity and simple 
pricing has made it remarkably popular. It 
has messaging, file sharing and time 
tracking in spades. Pricing starts at $20 per 
month, for up to 10 projects, and a rather 
measly 3GB of file storage space.
PAPRIKA
£Individual   www.paprika-software.com
Paprika is a business-minded set of tools 
with serious clout. Client management, 
estimating, resource scheduling, billing, 
timesheets, purchasing and reporting are 
all covered. Prices are quoted individually 
– contact the company for more details. O

STOCK YOUR SHOP
Since we’re making a shop, let’s start by adding some stock. Select 
‘Shop’ from the menu at the top and you’ll see a list of example 
products. Click ‘Edit’ beside one of these and change the details to suit 
one of your products.
CHOOSE SOME PRODUCT SHOTS
You can upload up to five different images for each of your products. As 
on Etsy, it’s best to use all of these slots to show your products in as 
much detail as possible, using a combination of full and close-up shots. 
Spend some time getting the best shots possible.
UPLOAD YOUR IMAGES
Click ‘Add images’ and you’ll see a list of the pictures used on your site. 
It’s a good idea to make a folder specifically for product photos, so select 
‘New folder’ and give it a suitable name. Select the folder, then click 
‘Upload’ and find the product photos on your hard drive.
FILL YOUR IMAGE GALLERY
The images will be uploaded and processed. Be careful – your free site 
only gives you a small amount of storage space, and you can easily 
exceed it if your images are very large. Select a photo and click ‘Use this’ 
to add it to your product’s image gallery.
APPLY SOME KEYWORDS
The description and keywords will affect how easily people can find your 
item on Google - check the article on page 96 for a detailed guide to 
search engine optimisation (SEO). SKU is a unique code to identify a 
particular item in your shop, but don’t worry about it for now. 
WRITE A PRODUCT SUMMARY
Use the ‘Description’ box on the right to provide a summary of your 
product for search engines, and enter some keywords in the box 
underneath. Moonfruit recommends using no more than seven. If there 
are categories you’re not sure about, click the ‘i’ for more information.

prompted to confirm your email address and currency, and asked 
whether you want to open a Facebook site (skip this for now). You can 
now return to your product list and update the rest of your stock.
PREVIEW YOUR SITE
Once you’ve finished adding your products, click ‘View my site’ in the 
top-right to see a preview of your shop. To edit any piece of text on the 
page, double-click it and type away. To move something, click it and 
drag it to a new location.
FINE-TUNE YOUR SITE
Click the menu links on the left (‘Home’, ‘Menu’, ‘What we do’ and  
‘Get in touch’) to edit each page. Click ‘Insert’ to add new pictures, text 
boxes, shapes and widgets such as forms and YouTube videos, which  
can give your site some extra zing.
EDIT YOUR MASTER PAGES
To edit the elements that appear on every page of your website (the logo, 
links and description), click ‘Page master’ and change them there. Once 
you’re happy with how everything is looking, save it and click ‘View my 
site’ on the top-right to see how your finished website will look.
MAKE SOME FINAL TWEAKS
Click the links to explore and make sure everything looks and works as 
you expect it to. Click ‘Exit preview’ to return to the editor and make any 
tweaks you think are necessary. When you’ve finished, select ‘Keep your 
site for free’ at the top of the page.
GO TO YOUR NEW SITE!
You’ll see a message informing you that you can keep your site for free, 
provided you update it at least once every six months. Click ‘Keep your

Straightforward   
storefront SEO
You’ve taken the plunge and created your own website to showcase and  
l^eerhnk`hh]lƂyghprhng^^]mhfZd^lnk^rhnk\nlmhf^kl\Zg_bg]bm
Building your own website 
offers lots of advantages – 
you have full control over 
how it looks, you can add 
a blog if you like, and you 
don’t need to worry about an 
online marketplace changing 
its policies unexpectedly. 
However, it also means you 
have to tackle the tricky 
issue of SEO (search engine 
optimisation) on your own to 
ensure that people can find 
your site on Google and Bing 
– there are no built-in tools to 
help. Don’t be put off, though 
– it’s not hard once you know 
how it works.
RESULTS EXPLAINED
When you search for 
something on Google or 
Bing, you receive two types 
of results – organic and paid. 
Paid results are labelled with 
the word ‘sponsored’, and as 
the name suggests, they 
appear prominently because 
the site’s owners have paid  
a fee. We’re going to focus on 
organic listings, which appear 
underneath and are generally 
considered more trustworthy.
Search engines use pieces 
of software called ‘web 
crawlers’, which follow links 
in web pages and index the 
resulting pages. When you 
type a word or phrase into  
a search engine, it uses the 
index it’s created to find the 
most relevant results. The 
search engine uses complex 
equations, known as ranking 
algorithms, to decide the 
order in which the results 
will appear. These algorithms 
take into account hundreds of 
different factors, but there are 
steps you can take to ensure 
the crawlers can find your 
site, and that the algorithms 
rank it highly. To get your site 
to appear on search engines, 
you can either wait for it to be 
found by crawlers, or submit 
it manually via www.google.
com/submityourcontent and 
www.bing.com/toolbox/
submit-site-url. That’s the 
first step taken care of!
Search engines aim to show 
people the most useful sites, 
so the most important part 
of SEO is having good quality 
content that’s updated 
regularly. However, the 
crawlers aren’t human, so 
there are some extra factors 
to consider. The crawlers 
must be able to interpret your 
site, so there’s no point in 
having nothing but images 
or Flash content – you need 
to have actual text that the 
software can interpret.
This is also important for 
your users; if they can’t see 
the images for any reason, 
they won’t be able to use your 
site if there’s no text. 

Start your own business  |  87 
Your website’s sections 
should also be named in a 
logical way. For example, a 
page showing scarves should 
be called scarves.html, while 
one showing hats should be 
hats.html – don’t call them 
page1.html and page2.html. 
Again, this is useful for your 
customers, because they can 
immediately see which part of 
your site they’re on. Try not to 
duplicate any pages or text on 
your site. Nobody wants to 
read the same thing twice.
KEYWORDS
One of the most important 
parts of your SEO strategy is 
your use of keywords. These 
are words and phrases that 
people who will be interested 
in your products are likely to 
be searching for. You should 
aim to use these in your site’s 
text so these people will find 
you. It can be tricky to know 
which keywords you should 
use, but the best advice is to 
think like a customer. If you 
were looking for handmade 
bridal shoes, for example, 
possible search terms could 
include ‘bridal shoes UK’, 
‘handmade bridal shoes’ and 
‘bridal shoes ivory’.
There are also tools that 
are designed to help. One 
of the most useful is Google 
AdWords Keyword Planner 
(http://adwords.google.com/
keywordplanner). Despite its 
name, this isn’t just a tool for 
buying advertisements on 
Google – it can also help you 
find words and phrases that 
your customers might be 
searching for, and provides  
a guide to incorporating them 
into your site. 
Sign in using your Google 
account, click the ‘Tools’ tab 
and select ‘Keywords planner’ 
to get started. O
SEO TRICKS TO AVOID
Keyword stuffing
Be careful with keywords – don’t just 
use as many as possible. Above all, 
your site needs to be useful to your 
customers. If your text sounds strange 
or stilted because there are too many 
keywords, visitors will be turned off.
Link farms
Links are important, but only if they’re 
relevant and natural. Don’t pay money 
for links from other sites, submit your 
site to big directories, or take part 
in lots of ‘link me and I’ll link you’ 
schemes. These are not only unhelpful 
to your customers, but Google can 
penalise you for it as well.
Comment spam
Don’t post comments on forums or 
blogs for the sole purpose of linking 
your site. This is annoying to other 
visitors who want to read opinions on 
the topic, and will only serve to earn 
you a bad reputation.

Check your facts 
and avoid making 
defamatory 
statements, or you 
could find yourself 
in hot water.
Keep  
it legal
Selling online? Here’s how to keep your business – and the  
products you’re putting out – on the right side of the law
WHAT IS INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY?
Intellectual property (IP) 
rights protect original ideas or 
creations, such as a brand, an 
invention, a design or a song. 
Intellectual property usually 
resides with the person who 
created those ideas, but IP 
can be bought and sold.
WHAT’S WRONG WITH COPYING  
A DESIGN I’VE SEEN ONLINE?
If you copy a design, you risk 
infringing the designer’s 
IP, which could have legal 
consequences. However, 
many designers, companies 
and bloggers will have 
information on their website 
about how you can use their 
designs, and some will even 
permit a limited amount 
of copying (see question 
on Angel Policies). Some 
designers will offer you 
‘free designs’ on their website 
that you may copy for 
personal use. 
WHAT’S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
BEING INSPIRED AND COPYING?
This is the difference between 
a design being original (and so 
qualifying for protection as an 
IP right), and being identical 
or substantially similar to an 
existing design (and so 
infringing the rights of the 
owner of that existing design).
In the UK, a design may be 
protected as copyright and as 
a design right (there are four 
types of unregistered and 
registered design rights in the 
UK and European Community 
that might apply – you can 
read about these at www.bit.
ly/9upBEM). For a design to 
be protected by copyright, it 
must be original (“the result 
of independent creative 
effort”) and not copied.  
Whether or not your design is 
protected or capable of being 
protected by any of the 
standard design rights, the 
difference is often important 
only if you try to make 
commercial gain. 
This means that a design 
can inspire you to create your 
own, new design that has key 
differences. Copying a design 
involves using the same or 
similar materials in the same 
or a similar way to achieve a 
very similar result. Designs 
that are for sale as books, 
magazines, kits or PDF 
downloads have been made 
available for copying – when 
you pay for them, you buy the 
right from the designer to 
copy them exactly. 
HOW CAN I PROTECT MY DESIGNS 
IF I POST THEM ONLINE?
You can lodge your design as a 
UK registered design with the 
Intellectual Property Office 
(www.ipo.gov.uk) for a fee, 
provided certain criteria are 
met. You could also register 
your design as a European 
Community design with 
OHIM (www.oami.europa.eu). 
If you do not wish to register 
your design, provided certain 
criteria are met, it will 
automatically be protected as 
an unregistered UK and EC 
design right, and be protected

This information 
is provided as an 
introduction to 
some of the rules 
governing your 
online activities  
in the UK –  
this is not a 
comprehensive or 
exhaustive guide 
to the legal 
implications 
involved in online 
activities, and 
you should not 
rely on the 
information 
provided. If in 
doubt, do your 
own research or 
consult a 
qualified solicitor.
PLEASE 
NOTE
by copyright. You don’t have 
to apply for these rights, but 
there are a few things you can 
do to help protect your design. 
Mark your work, and images 
of it, with the © symbol, plus 
your name and the year you 
created it. This offers other 
people information about the 
project and who to contact if 
they want permission to use 
the work, plus it demonstrates 
that you take protection of 
your design seriously. 
You could also lodge your 
work with a bank or solicitor, 
or send yourself a copy of 
the work by special delivery 
post and leave the envelope 
unopened – this will offer 
proof of the date of creation. 
IF I SEE A DESIGN I LIKE, CAN I 
SHARE IT WITH MY FRIENDS?
IP laws apply on the internet 
in the same way as in the 
‘real’ world. This means if you 
want to distribute material 
that belongs to other people, 
you should get permission.
However, most designers 
are happy for you to share 
designs on Facebook, Twitter 
or your blog, as long as your 
comments are positive and 
you include a credit or link 
back to the designer’s 
website. Most designers see 
this as good online publicity, 
but check the designer’s 
website for any information or 
policy they may have on this.
If you run a blog, remember 
that it’s still good etiquette to 
email other people if you want 
to mention them in a post.
CAN I REMAKE SOMEONE ELSE’S 
DESIGNS AND SELL THEM FOR  
A PROFIT?
Designs for sale online (or in 
books or magazines) usually 
have a notice that states that 
you may remake the designs 
for your own personal use, but 
not for profit. If you wanted to 
profit from these designs, 
you’d have to ask the designer 
for permission. You’ll find 
that charity fundraising is 
often allowed – but, usually, 
profiting from someone else’s 
intellectual property is not.
CAN I USE A COMPANY’S 
PRODUCTS TO CREATE DESIGNS TO 
SELL FOR PROFIT?
A company’s products may 
include a statement about 
whether you can use them for 
profit or personal use. Most 
raw materials – such as yarn, 
thread, paper and fabric – are 
fine for creative personal use 
and for profit. However, some 
pre-designed craft products 
(such as rubber stamps) have 
restrictions (called an Angel 
Policy) on how you can use 
any designs you create with 
those products, if you intend 
to sell them for profit. 
WHAT IS AN ANGEL POLICY?
An Angel Policy gives details 
of when and how you can 
use a company’s products to 
make and sell items for profit, 
plus any copyright notice 
you might have to include 
regarding the artist or the 
manufacturer. You can usually 
find details of a company’s 
Angel Policy on their website, 
and typical restrictions. If a 
company has no Angel Policy, 
this usually means the 
products are for personal use 
and not commercial gain. 
If you want to use a 
company’s products for 
personal gain or charity 
fundraising, it’s a good idea  
to get their permission.
WHAT IS DEFAMATION?
Defamation is a complex legal 
issue, but it’s a good idea to be 
aware of the basic principle. 
Put simply, defamation 
is when you say or write 
something about a person 
or group that gives them a 
negative image. A statement 
is defamatory if it holds the 
person or group up to hatred, 
ridicule or contempt; causes 
them to be shunned or 
avoided; disparages them 
in their office, profession 
or trade; or tends to make 
right-thinking people think 
less of that person or group.  
It must also be reasonably 
understood to refer to the 
person or group, and it must 
be communicated to other 
people. However, a statement 
will not be defamatory if it is 
proved to be true. 
CAN I WRITE WHATEVER  
I WANT ONLINE?
Use common sense and a bit 
of etiquette when writing or 
saying anything on the 
internet. Firstly, you need to 
avoid breaking any of the laws 
described already and, 
secondly, you need to avoid 
saying anything morally 
offensive. A simple test for 
this is to ask yourself, “Would 
I feel OK if someone said this 
to me?” O

in a crowded market. Read on to find out how to master it
was released. Many of these 
same webmasters were hit 
again little more than a year 
later, when the search giant’s 
Penguin update followed – 
targeting low-quality, 
spammy link-building tactics. 
Pigeon and Payday followed, 
again targeting spam, and in 
late 2015 a machine-learning 
AI system known as 
RankBrain was introduced to 
interpret searches and provide 
results that may not include 
the words searched for but are

still relevant. With all these 
changes, many SEO 
techniques turned out to be 
less than optimal. Sites were 
penalised; traffic lost, and 
so-called ‘SEO experts’ fired.
Since then there’s been a 
new tone in the SEO industry. 
Not all of us were creating 
low-quality content and links; 
but for those who were, these 
two updates were a wake-up 
call. And for those of us who 
have always been focused on 
high-quality, relevant content 
and links, it was something 
like redemption. Our sites 
soared while so many fell.
This is the new normal for 
SEO. Yes, there are still some 
who call themselves SEOs but 
focus on manipulative tactics 
with short-term revenue 
goals; yet there are also many 
who are part of a large and 
growing industry of specialists 
in a highly complex discipline 
that requires marketing, 
technical, research and 
communication skills.
So how big is SEO? Believe it 
or not, it’s bigger in the minds 
of Google searchers than web 
design. Once considered a 
subset of web design, searches 
for SEO now eclipse those of 
web design worldwide. 
The total projected value of 
the North American search 
marketing industry (SEO and 
paid search) in 2013 was  
$26.8 billion, according to 
industry trade organisation 
SEMPO (www.econsultancy.
com/us/reports/sempo-state-
of-search), and 13 per cent of 
companies have SEO budgets 
of half a million to more than 
three million a year (up from 
8 per cent in 2011). 
As budgets increase, there’s 
more to lose, and many 
companies have become more 
risk averse – forgoing the 
shady tactics they may have 
pursued in the past.
In cutting out the garbage, 
we start to see what SEO is 
good for (and has always been 
good for): connecting relevant 
content with relevant 
searchers, and making 
content discoverable through 
accessibility and marketing.
For those of you who still 
think of SEOs as greasy 
algorithm-chasers in cheap 
suits or parents’ basements, 
consider the new reality.
ENGINES ARE NOT ENEMIES
Ten years ago, there were 
many people who were a little 
nervous about what we were 
doing. Nothing was against 
the Google guidelines … 
Because there were no such 
guidelines in existence. At 
that time, there were a few 
books, but SEO was largely 
something that was spoken of 
covertly, and certainly never 
to search engines, which, it 
was thought, would likely 
think of it as manipulation. 
Today we know better. 
Google and Bing have both 
published extensive 
webmaster guidelines, and 
Google has even published a 
guide to SEO for beginners 
(http://netm.ag/
seostarter-238). In August 
2011, Matt Cutts, Google’s 
head of webspam, released a 
video statement (http://netm.
ag/spam-238) saying that 
Google does not consider SEO 
by itself to be spam. This 
sentiment now appears in 
Google’s definition of search 
engine optimisation (http://
netm.ag/seodef-238), in 
which it says: “Many SEOs 
MULTIMEDIA SEO 
CASE STUDY
Background: an enterprise wanted to 
increase natural search traffic to its 
car image-sharing site. 
CHALLENGE 
 
O
The images were hidden behind JavaScript 
and not indexed. 
 
O
The images were hosted on another domain 
(a common CDN) making it impossible to 
create image sitemaps. 
 
O
Title tags were branded, making it difficult 
for the engines to understand what keywords 
the site was relevant for. 
 
O
Most common search phrases were not used 
in content.
 
O
As a new website, there was a lack of  
any authority.
STRATEGY 
 
O
Rewrote the URLs so that they would  
appear to the engines to be hosted on the 
enterprise’s own website to get more 
content indexed.
 
O
Made images more accessible by adding 
noscript tags to the download page.
 
O
 Used sitemaps and image sitemaps to 
ensure that the engines were aware of the 
content and the structure of the site. 
 
O
Changed the title tags of the major  
pages so that they included relevant 
keywords, and changed the copy in  
these pages when necessary to include 
popular relevant keywords. 
 
O
Followed Google’s image search  
best practices (http://netm.ag/
imagesearch-238), and added structured 
markup to all the images to ensure that  
the engines had as much information  
about what the images were relevant  
for as possible. 
RESULTS
 
O
 In the first four weeks after implementation, 
the number of images indexed went from 
10,000 thumbnail images to 54,000 
images. In six months, 403,000 images 
were indexed.
 
O
Doubled relevant organic search traffic in 
four weeks, taking organic traffic from 11 per 
cent to 22 per cent of the total visits. 
Organic search was 41 per cent of visits in 
six months.
 
O
The clickthrough rate from organic search 
increased 460 per cent in the first four 
weeks alone. 
 
O
Monthly organic visits grew 4,198.61 per cent 
from 1,083 to 46,554 in six months.
 
O
In a year, the site sat on Google page one for 
relevant high-volume terms such as ‘pictures 
of cars’ ‘pics of cars’ and ‘car wallpapers’.

and other agencies and

Still, because of a few 
spammers who call 
themselves SEOs, SEOs in 
general have the reputation of 
being charlatans, and have 
been portrayed as such on 
television shows such as The 
Good Wife and Dexter. 
“SEO has got a bad rap, and 
it’s due to questionable SEO 
practitioners who perpetuate 
the ‘snake oil’ stereotype by 
making customers believe 
there’s some magic ‘black 
box’ that ‘tricks’ the search 
engines,” says Gord 
Hotchkiss, chief strategy 
officer for Mediative (www.
mediative.com) and columnist 
for Search Insider. Hotchkiss, 
and the other experts involved 
in this article, explain that 
SEO is simply about getting 
relevant content indexed, and 
making sure it’s visible to 
search engines. 
All of the veteran SEOs who 
we spoke to understand why 
SEO still has the reputation in 
some circles of being snake 
oil. But they insist that it has, 
now, become much more 
mainstream and credible. 
Rand Fishkin, founder of 
SEO software company 
SEOMoz (www.seomoz.org), 
discusses his favourite 
reasons for SEO being 
something other than snake 
oil, including that, “SEOmoz 
has more than two million 
monthly visits, nearly all from 
web marketers looking to 
learn more about the practice. 
And our software, which bills 
monthly, has more than 
18,000 subscribers. If SEO 
were just snake oil, I suspect 
folks would stop paying.”
SEO, in its legitimate form, 
is now a more accepted part of 
the web design process, and in 
many organisations is finally 
getting a seat at the table 
when it comes to designing 
professional, search engine-
friendly websites.
A PROCESS, NOT A PROJECT
In our experience, there are 
many instances in which the 
SEO team is brought in after 
the website has been 
completed, and told to 
magically make it search 
engine friendly. This is far 
from ideal.
The really competitive sites 
understand this, and integrate 
DANNY SULLIVAN
How would you convince doubters that SEO is a 
legitimate marketing strategy?
SEO has been around for two decades and is recommended by 
Google, which even provides its own guide for it. The world’s 
largest search engine isn’t going to be pushing snake oil – it has 
every reason not to. The fact that it does is probably the best 
reason beyond the many out there about why SEO is important. 
Ignore it, and you’re ignoring what the actual search engines you 
want to be listed in are telling you to do to improve your chances.
Many designers see SEO as extra work and may add it at 
the end of the web design process if they’ve added it at 
all. Why should these people take SEO seriously?
If you build it, they don’t necessarily come. Creating a shiny, 
wonderful new website doesn’t matter if you’ve built it in a way 
to make it invisible to search engines. Designers often test to 
ensure their sites work well in different browsers like IE, Firefox 
and Chrome. Well, I’ve long written about search engines as 
being the most important browser of all, because everyone uses 
them to find sites. But if you’ve not designed your site for the 
unique things the search engine browser wants, people won’t 
locate them.
A lot of software has been introduced in the past couple 
of years that seeks to automate aspects of the SEO 
process. Will SEO ever be completely automated? 
Software can’t automatically tell the type of content readers are 
interested in, the type of words they’ll use to seek that content, 
create the quality content itself to serve them – and that’s just 
the foundational part of SEO. Tools are nice. But we’ve had tools 
for years to build houses, yet we haven’t completely automated 
house building. I think humans will long be involved in SEO.
What would you say are some promising trends in SEO 
today and why?
The use of more social data as a potential additional signal 
beyond looking at links to identify quality content is most 
promising to me. The greater use of structured data is also 
encouraging, as are the new possibilities opened up as people 
search on mobile devices and with mobile apps.

SEO into every stage of the 
planning process, from 
information architecture to 
content strategy to design, 
development, launch and 
post-launch.
A lot of web designers  
and developers are hesitant 
about integrating SEO further 
into the process, because 
doing so effectively produces 
extra work. But the rewards 
can be great, reminds Vanessa 
Fox, founder and CEO of  
Nine by Blue and author of 
Marketing in the Age of 
Google. “Organisations are 
losing 1) tremendous insight 
into their customers and 
potential customers if they 
don’t take advantage of the 
free search data that’s 
available from the millions of 
searches we do each day; 2) 
the opportunity to reach a 
significantly larger audience 
through being visible in 
search results.”
Would you put the Mona 
Lisa in a closet? Would you 
spend hours cooking beef 
wellington, and as it emerges 
perfect from the oven throw it 
in the bin? Then why on earth 
would you build a website 
without considering how it 
will be found?
There’s another reason for 
making SEO a priority in the 
web design process, advises 
Hotchkiss: “It forces you to 
create a better website! Good 
SEO optimisation should be 
baked into your information 
architecture. It will force you 
to think about common 
content themes. It requires 
you to consider how all digital 
assets (such as videos and 
user-generated content) will 
be integrated into the overall 
user experience. It helps 
eliminate user experience 
dead ends such as gratuitous 
Flash interfaces and, my 
personal pet peeve, content 
locked in PDFs. It extends 
your perception of your  
online footprint beyond the 
bounds of your website, 
including things like social 
media. It will also instil a 
healthy rigour when it comes 
to thinking about how your 
site links together. Good  
SEO practices mean a better 
user experience.”
From our experience, more 
organisations than ever are 
learning these lessons, and 
are no longer thinking of SEO 
as a project, but as an ongoing 
process that ensures a website 
will be as visible in search as 
possible. This is good for web 
design because it gives it a 
larger audience, but also good 
for business.
IT’S NOT JUST ABOUT LINKS: 
EMERGING SEO TRENDS
While many commentators 
have claimed that SEO is dead 
since it began around 1997, 
the truth is that it doesn’t die; 
it evolves with the search 
engines. While SEO is 
constantly evolving, at the 
moment it seems focused  
on mobility, utility, the 
audience and automation, 
among other things.
One of these trends is the 
dissolving distinction between 
SEO, user experience and 
content strategy. In one 
recent Webmaster Tools 
YouTube video (http://netm.
ag/cutts-238), Matt Cutts even 
suggested that those looking 
to change the name might 
consider “searcher experience 
optimisation” to differentiate 
from the ‘snake oil’ variety  
of SEO.
Some, such as Vanessa Fox, 
have suggested that SEO need 
not proceed as a separate 
activity from UX and content 
strategy: “I think that both 
disciplines should incorporate 
best practices from search 
rather than thinking of it as 
something tacked on later,” 
she says. “Particularly, the 
data available from search is 
extremely valuable. Also, 
understanding that many 
visitors begin with a major 
search engine and that any 
page of the website can 
therefore become the 
homepage of the site can shift 
how we look at both page 
design and content.”
At the same time, Vanessa 
Fox – and all of the other SEOs 
that we spoke to – recognise 
that content strategy and 
usability, while essential for 
reputable SEO, need technical 
and other elements from  
SEO to be useful as a way of 
getting incremental search 
engine traffic.
“When SEO is done the  
right way, usability and 
content is a huge part of the 
plan,” opines Eric Enge, 
founder and CEO of 
Massachusetts-based Stone 
“WHY BUILD A WEBSITE 
WITHOUT CONSIDERING 
HOW IT WILL BE FOUND?”

IMPLEMENTING OPTIMISED FACEBOOK SHARING
Facebook’s Open Graph (the overarching name of the algorithm 
that handles third-party content on Facebook) relies on a series 
of meta tags, which need to be present in the <head> section of 
every web page to guide how content should be displayed when 
shared. There are specific parameters that these meta tags need 
to adhere to in order to be activated in search results. There are 
essentially four lines of code that need to be present wherever 
there’s sharing functionality: 
 
O
og:title – the title of your object as it should appear within the graph, 
for example ‘SEO Mentioned Again on The Good Wife’;
 
O
og:type – the type of your object, such as ‘article’. Depending on the 
type you specify, other properties may also be required. In the case of 
an article, additional information can be included in the graph*;
 
O
og:image – an image URL that should represent your object within the 
graph. These should be consistent with the article (for instance www.
brysonmeunier.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/seo-from-the-good-
wife.jpg;
 
O
og:url – the canonical URL of your object that will be used as its 
permanent ID in the graph, such as www.brysonmeunier.com/
seo-mentioned-again-on-the-good-wife.
*When these pieces of data are known or available publicly (note: 
never push information in an Open Graph tag that is not visible 
on the page in question – this could be flagged as a form of 
cloaking), include these pieces as part of the lines in the 
Facebook Meta Tag: 
 
O
article:published_time - datetime – when the article was  
first published;
 
O
article:modified_time - datetime – when the article was  
last changed;
 
O
article:expiration_time - datetime – when the article is going  
out of date;
 
O
article:author - profile array – the writers of the article.
LIVE EXAMPLE
For the example, this is what should be in the <head> section of 
the URL (this format should be included for all pages on the site). 
The content title and description should carry through to the 
Open Graph tags:
 <html prefix=“og: http://ogp.me/ns#”> 
 <head profile=“http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml/ 
 
 vocab”> 
 <meta http-equiv=“Content-Type” content=“text/

Temple Consulting and 
co-author of The Art of SEO. 
“This is something that the 
snake-oil SEO people don’t 
worry about. For long-term 
success as a web publisher, 
the use must come first. 
However, for success as a 
business, you need more.”
With this concentration on 
content strategy and usability 
comes a focus on the audience 
as well. For Hotchkiss, this is 
a shift from word-matching 
to utility, and follows the 
search engines’ own 
evolution. “Today, good  
SEO is about making sure  
that when a prospect uses a 
word (or words) to search for 
something, you match that as 
best as possible,” he says. 
“But in the future, SEO will be 
about ensuring that when 
your prospect wants 
something, you deliver it. It 
may not be content. It may be 
a movie ticket, hotel booking, 
restaurant reservation or a 
downloaded TV show.”
A CHANGE IN ANALYSIS
Delivering on this promise 
frequently requires a new  
type of analysis. In the past, 
marketers have done keyword 
research to uncover keywords 
as proxies for user intent. In 
Marketing in the Age of 
Google, Vanessa Fox describes 
the process of creating 
searcher personas that get 
beyond simple keyword 
matching and search volume 
exercises. And still others, 
such as iCrossing’s Core 
Audience (www.coreaudience.
com) and Resolution Media’s 
ClearTarget (http://
resolutionmedia.com/us/
cleartarget/) try to understand 
characteristics of audiences, 
including but not limited to 
the keywords they use. For 
some businesses, mobility will 
not change user intent. For 
example, news is not going to 
be rewritten for a separate 
platform, as Karen McGrane 
and other adaptive content 
advocates frequently point 
out. However, for some 
businesses it does; and if 
marketers want to get the 
most traffic and conversions 
from the mobile platform (in 
other words, be optimised for 
that) the devil is in the detail, 
and understanding the 
differences between mobile 
and desktop audiences is key.
There are technical 
considerations as well, which 
make a type of SEO geared 
towards these differences – 
what is commonly called 
mobile SEO – what it is. Many 
people in the SEO world, as

Start your own business  |  97 
with their counterparts in the 
design world, believe that 
responsive design is the 
answer to these differences 
– and Google stated a 
preference for responsive 
design in June 2013. However, 
responsive design is not 
always best for the user, and 
Google wouldn’t prefer it in 
those cases. If mobile and 
desktop search behaviour is 
significantly different, Google 
supports using dynamic 
serving or switchboard tags  
as well. 
Cindy Krum, CEO of 
Denver-based mobile 
marketing agency Mobile 
Moxie and author of Mobile 
Marketing: Finding Your 
Customers Wherever They  
Are agrees that responsive 
design is one of many 
solutions for mobile search 
engine optimisation. “I have 
been recommending a mixed 
solution for most of my 
clients,” she says, 
“Leveraging responsive 
design when it makes  
sense, and special mobile-
only landing pages when 
keywords or use-cases  
cannot be appropriately 
addressed with a responsive 
design approach.”
TOOLS OF THE TRADE
Another big shift in SEO has 
been the introduction of more 
automation to the process. 
SEO software has been around 
as long as SEO has, but the 
sophistication and breadth of 
tools has increased in the last 
year or two. 
Now there are tools to help 
you optimise the long-tail 
through semantic relevance 
(BloomReach – www.
bloomreach.com), reporting 
tools (Conductor  – www.
conductor.com; BrightEdge – 
www.brightedge.com; and 
SEOMoz), link building tools 
(Ontolo – www.ontolo.com; 
Ahrefs – www.ahrefs.com; 
Open Site Explorer – www.
opensiteexplorer.org; Majestic 
SEO – www.majesticseo.com) 
and more, all geared towards 
automating various aspects  
of the search engine 
optimisation process.
When this happens, 
inevitably someone in the 
press will claim that the tool 
will allow you to fire your 
redundant SEO; but none of 
the SEO experts or software 
providers we’ve spoken to 
agree. “Great SEO starts with 
human beings who are 
creative, tenacious, and 
empathetic to the needs of 
searchers,” says Fishkin. “No 
software can ever automate 
those processes.”
There are other trends in 
search engine optimisation 
that are important as well, 
among them the integration 
of social signals into ranking 
algorithms, and SEO that is 
not just text-based, but about 
understanding and optimising 
images and videos – perhaps 
eventually for wearable 
computing purposes (Google 
Glass, for example). 
All in all, legitimate SEO has 
evolved with the search 
engines – and it continues to 
do so. As we’ve said, 
understanding and applying 
this new information requires 
a new type of SEO 
practitioner, and a different 
kind of user-focused SEO. The 
next time someone tells you 
something different, you now 
have the knowledge to set 
them straight. O

LINK BUILDING MEANS 
EARNING ‘HARD’ LINKS, 
NOT ‘EASY’ LINKS
Danny Sullivan explains the rationale behind his 
rant from SMX Advanced 2012, about the concept 
of link earning (http://netm.ag/sullivan-236).

98  |   Start your own business
We all want to get our site to 
the top of Google. But that’s 
only half the story – what 
happens when people click 
through to your site? 
Do they hang around and 
check out what you have to 
offer – or quickly move on to 
the next result? Obviously, we 
want the former to happen, so 
how can we make sure it does?
When visitors find nothing 
of interest on your site at first 
glance and leave immediately, 
this is known as a bounce. 
A site with a high bounce 
rate from good quality traffic 
sources is an indicator that 
the website isn’t performing 
up to visitors’ expectations. 
SOURCES OF TRAFFIC
Reducing your website’s 
bounce rate is a great 
first step in improving its 
overall performance 
and conversion rate. 
First you need to analyse the 
bounce rates of the different 
traffic sources. Focus your 
efforts on improving the 
bounce rates of the highest 
converting traffic sources, 
such as:
 
O
Search engine traffic;
 
O
Email marketing campaigns; 
 
O
Affiliate campaigns.
Ignore the bounce rate from 
unqualified sources, such as: 
 
O
Unknown referrer sites;
 
O
Social networking sites; 
 
O
Random directory sites.
LANDING PAGE DESIGN
How you design your landing 
pages can make a difference 
to your bounce rate. Take the 
example of Real Gap (www.
realgap.com), which provides 
gap year and travelling ideas 
in over 35 countries for those 
youngsters wishing to take  
a year off before, during or 
after university. 
The website uses specially-
designed landing pages for its 
pay-per-click (PPC) accounts. 
The PPC page has a strong call 
to action, whereas the SEO 
page just contains general  
gap year information. Not 
surprisingly, the bounce rate 
CASE STUDY
Jamster (www.jamster.com) was a website 
aimed primarily at a young audience, which 
provided them with ringtones, dial tones, 
mobile games, screensavers and music for 
mobile phones. It tried three different 
landing page designs: an interactive page 
powered by Flash, a rock-themed page and 
a generic landing page. Using PPC as the 
only source of traffic, we were able to 
determine that Flash interactivity was the 
key to a very low bounce rate and high 
conversion rate. 
The Flash landing page used a great call 
to action and Flash interactivity. Providing a 
fun and exciting Flash widget alongside a 
strong call to action delivered a very high 
return on investment. 
The rock-themed page not surprisingly 
appealed to rock fans but was a static page 
without Flash interactivity. The generic page 
was designed with no specific genres of 
music and it  used light, friendly colours. 
The results (from PPC sources) indicate 
that neither of these were the right 
approach for Jamster consumers. The Flash 
page had a 17.4 per cent bounce rate, 
compared to a bounce rate of 22.1 per cent 
for the rock page and one of 49.8 per cent 
for the generic landing page.
Keep people 
on your site
How do you keep visitors on your site longer once they’ve clicked

for the PPC page is far lower 
than for the organic page: 
18.24 per cent for the former 
compared with 25.44 per cent 
for the latter. It’s a clear 
demonstration of how the 
design of the page people land 
on influences the bounce rate. 
So what’s the secret to 
designing a page with a low 
bounce rate? Here are some 
helpful tips.
 
O
Make sure your headline 
refers directly to the place 
where your visitor came  
from or the ad copy that  
drove the click.
 
O
It’s vital to provide a clear call 
to action. Here’s a good 
example: ‘Only £99 per night 
at the Hilton Hotel in Paris. 
Book now.’ Here’s a bad 
example: ‘Cheap hotels in 
Paris, the most romantic city 
in the world. Choose from 300 
hotels in Paris, France.’
 
O
You need to write clear, 
specific and targeted content 
that’s geared specifically 
towards your visitors. Don’t 
write content that is vague or 
general. Your visitors are here 
to read about a specific 
subject, so they won’t thank 
you for wasting their time.
 
O
Hierarchy – place the most 
important information at the 
beginning of paragraphs and 
bullet lists.
 
O
Keep it simple. Remove all 
extraneous matter from your 
landing page. Ask for only 
enough information to 
complete the desired action.
TESTING
How do you know what’s 
working and what isn’t in 
terms of keeping visitors on 
your site? Answer: you don’t. 
So assume nothing, and  
test everything. 
Thanks to Google’s Content 
Experiments (in Analytics), 
we can create, test and 
monitor the performance of 
landing pages. The purpose of 
testing your landing pages is 
to reduce bounce rates and 
increase conversion rates.
Setting up an A/B split  
test on Google Content 
Experiments is very easy and 
free. Here’s a basic overview 
of the steps involved:
 
O
Create a campaign to test 
landing pages against  
each other.
 
O
Upload the URL of the original 
page that you’re testing.
 
O
Upload the URLs of the other 
landing pages you want to 
test against the original.
 
O
Copy the JavaScript codes 
provided by Google and paste 
them into the relevant pages 
you’re trying to test. (This 
requires access to the HTML 
code of the pages.)
 
O
Send at least 500 visitors to 
the primary URL and Google 
will separate those visitors 
randomly for you to test the 
performance of the pages in a 
non-biased way. You can do 
this by using AdWords, email 
campaigns or even affiliates 
to send traffic from specific 
keywords through the funnel.
GOLDEN RULES
Finally, here are some golden 
rules to remember when 
you’re designing and testing 
landing pages:
 
O
No idea is a bad idea until 
you’ve seen it in action. If you 
get an idea for a landing page, 
try it! Try them all. 
 
O
Make a different landing page 
for every keyword that gets at 
least 500 clicks per month. 
This ensures your highest 
converting keywords get all 
the attention they deserve. 
 
O
Send at least 500 visitors 
from the same traffic source/
keyword to each landing  
page, to accurately gauge  
its performance. 
 
O
Once you’ve tested several 
landing pages, try improving 
them by testing different 
versions of the best 
performing pages.
 
O
The best landing pages can 
then be tested to varying 
degrees using multivariate 
testing. This is where you  
test specific elements of the 
page rather than entirely  
new pages.
Creating landing pages that 
encourage visitors to stay 
longer can sometimes be 
time-consuming and 
expensive, but it’s absolutely 
essential to high converting, 
high performing websites. In 
the words of Samuel Beckett, 
“Ever tried. Ever failed. No 
matter. Try Again. Fail again. 
Fail better.” O

Why social 
media matters
Thanks to social media, the way we do business has changed for ever. 
If you’re not using social networks right now, you’re missing out
With Facebook boasting 1.59 
billion active monthly users 
and Twitter steady at around 
300 million active monthly 
users, social media is here to 
stay. It has forever changed 
the way products are 
marketed. A marketing 
strategy that doesn’t make 
use of social media is out of 
date. To take advantage of this 
huge pool of easily accessible 
and instantly available 
customers, you need to learn 
the secrets that can get your 
brand noticed online, which is 
why we’ve created this guide.
Whether you have a product 
to sell, a brand to promote or a 
cause to champion, this guide 
will show you how to leverage 
the power of the big social 
networks, such as Facebook, 
Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr, 
to help get you noticed and 
spread the word. With our help 
you’ll be producing content 
that has global appeal.
CONTENT MARKETING
In a nutshell, social marketing 
is about using the various social 
networks to build up a buzz 
about your brand or product. 
Content marketing is an 
important part of the social 
marketing mix. Essentially, 
this means taking the content 
you probably already produce 
and using it in your social 
marketing. There’s no point 
shouting, no matter how loudly 
you do it, unless you’ve got 
something to shout about. 
For example, say you’re an 
illustrator and you’ve created a 
great series of illustrations for a 
client. You could share one of 
those illustrations on your 
social media accounts as a 

Start your own business  |  103 

104  |   Start your own business
promotional activity, along 
with a link to your website. If 
the illustration is good enough 
and plenty of people like it, 
they’ll start to share it on 
their social media accounts, 
and this can create a buzz 
about your work.
In most cases, there’s an 
initial spike in activity, which 
steadily tails off over a long 
period. However, in rare 
situations this growth can be 
dramatic, and at some point it 
becomes self-sustaining. If an 
image, video or campaign 
achieves the status of ‘going 
viral’, it can be enough to 
launch a whole new business. 
See our feature starting on 
page 108 for more information 
about creating viral content. 
While a viral hit can boost 
your product or brand into the 
stratosphere very quickly, it’s 
a rare event and exceptionally 
hard to artificially engineer. 
It’s impossible to predict what 
will go viral, and it’s for this 
reason you shouldn’t count on 
it as part of your social media 
strategy. In most cases, you 
need to ensure your social 
marketing is done as part of 
an organised campaign, which 
builds up a decent amount of 
interest over time, steadily 
growing your brand. Keep in 
mind that social marketing is 
a marathon, not a sprint.
The guide you’re reading 
right now has everything you 
need to understand social 
marketing across the major 
social networks and share 
your content effectively, but 
don’t underestimate how 
important it is to have great 
content in the first place. 
Without great content that 
people are proud to share with 
their friends, you will fail. If 
people see great content being 
shared, then chances are high 
that they’ll want more of it, 
and that they will head to your 
website to learn more. 
Of course, not everybody 
has an instantly accessible 
stream of memorable content 
that’s reliably shareable. If 
the thought of content being 
key to your social strategy 
makes you nervous, it might 
be time to investigate the 
power of storytelling.
WHY STORYTELLING IS YOUR 
SECRET WEAPON
Simply put, people respond to 
stories - it’s in our genes. You 
can imagine our distant 

Start your own business  |  105 
ancestors huddled around a 
fire, telling stories to their 
children over the dying 
embers. The same approach 
works well on social media.  
For example, if you’re 
looking for funding to start or 
finish a film project, make a 
short video to explain why 
this project is so important to 
you, and how you arrived at 
the point where you need 
more funding to finish it. 
Straight-up demands for  
cash won’t impress anybody, 
but fundraising videos are 
eminently shareable, so long 
as they tell a story that gets 
underneath people’s skin. 
If you need inspiration, 
check out the fundraising 
video produced by Tippy Tap 
(http://tippytap.org), at  
https://youtu.be/
Qdpd3roZjYw. It’s a great 
example of a storytelling 
video that shows a Tippy Tap 
being created out of very basic 
materials. It’s engaging 
because it makes you wonder 
what they’re going to make 
while you watch it.
The video hooks you right 
to the end, at which point it 
delivers the stunning message 
that in India more than 1,000 
children die every day from 
diarrhoea, half of which could 
be prevented by something as 
simple as handwashing with 
soap. It’s a beautifully 
executed message that 
screams to be shared.
MEASURE YOUR SUCCESS
A great benefit of social 
marketing is that you can 
measure its success by leads 
and customers, rather than 
the more traditional web 
metrics, such as page views, 
time spent on a page, and 
bounce rate.
The various social networks 
have their own analytics to 
help you assess the impact of 
your efforts. For example, you 
can see immediately how 
many times a Facebook post 
has been shared, and how 
many times your most recent 
tweet has been retweeted, but 
you also get a much more 
direct feel for how successful 
social marketing has been by 
how your sales or customer 
contacts are doing. What you 
do on social media has a direct 
effect, and the results should 
be instantly apparent.
A major advantage of social 
marketing is that there’s no 
charge to post on social 
networks, and provided your 
posts are interesting and 
they’re being viewed and 
shared, your message is 
getting out there without you 
having to pay for it. Of course, 
while the medium is free, your 
time isn’t, and you will need 
to invest a significant amount 
of it in your social marketing 
efforts if you want to get it 
right. An important part of 
social marketing is managing 
the conversation you have 
with your customers, and 
there’s no more direct, or 
public, way of doing this than 
via social media.
Of course, social networks 
aren’t averse to taking your 
money to display adverts or to 
promote your messages. Your 
initial reaction might be that 
it makes no sense paying for 
promotion when you can get it 
for free with good content, but 
take time to consider this 
option. Facebook advertising 
and promoted tweets can 
prove very cost effective in 
the right circumstances. 
WITH GREAT POWER COMES  
GREAT RESPONSIBILITY
Also, let’s not forget, the 
power of social media can be 
used for bad, as well as good. 
If ever there was a cautionary 
case that demonstrated the 
way social media can make or 
break a business or brand, it 
was that of The Shed café 
close to where this book was 
produced, in Bath, UK. 

106  |   Start your own business

Start your own business  |  107 
One of the café’s customers 
posted a balanced three-out-
of-five review on The Shed’s 
Facebook page, accompanied 
by a comment that she would 
not be having any of the cakes 
by the till, as they were in 
danger of being breathed on 
by customers because they 
were not covered up. 
Unfortunately, The Shed’s 
Facebook page responded to 
the criticism by replying: 
“You would need to be a 
midget with the neck of a 
giraffe to be able to breathe all 
over them - stupid woman!” 
It went on to mention libel 
and defamation in subsequent 
posts. Within days, the spat 
had gone global, being shared 
all over Twitter and Facebook. 
It quickly appeared in local 
newspaper websites, and 
nationally on the Mail Online 
website (http://dailymail.co.
uk), under the headline 
“Great Twittish cake off!”
Interestingly, there were 
supporters on Twitter for both 
sides of the argument, but you 
just knew that The Shed would 
rather the conversation was 
not happening at all.
A few days later, The Shed 
issued an apology via its 
Facebook page, concluding 
with a direct apology to the 
customer who originally 
provided feedback. This 
response ended: “…in 
hindsight we wouldn’t have 
posted the Facebook response 
we did and therefore would 
like to move on by offering a 
heartfelt apology …”. This 
case shows that all you need is 
one slip up in the way you 
engage with your customers 
to damage your business.
Even big brands are not 
immune to social media 
slip-ups. MasterCard’s PR 
company once made a total 
hashtag of things by asking 
that all journalists seeking to 
attend the 2014 Brit Awards 
make at least one tweet with 
mention of MasterCard, and 
that they include the hashtag 
#PricelessSurprises in it. The 
request instantly backfired, 
and journalists started to use 
the hashtag to criticise the 
request. The PR agency 
defended its actions, but you 
should consider the difficulty 
in shaking off negative 
publicity that’s generated by 
making a social faux pas.
BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME
Social marketing has to lead 
somewhere. Even if it is your 
job is to promote your brand 
and to get it into as many 
people’s minds as possible, 
somewhere there is a product 
you need to sell, and most of 
the time, that product is on a 
web page. A landing page is 
the place where anybody 
engaged with your social 
marketing will arrive when 
they click on a link to your 
website. It must be part of 
your strategy, and you need  
to do everything possible to 
make your customer’s 
experience of your website  
as good as possible.
Perhaps the most important 
thing to remember about 
social marketing is that we 
stand on shifting sands. At 
the moment, Facebook is by 
far the largest social network, 
with Twitter nipping at its 
heels, but the social media 
landscape could look very 
different five years from now. 
It’s possible that an entirely 
new medium for social media 
could emerge and take over 
the space in the public’s 
consciousness that is occupied 
by the current big players.
Photo sharing networks 
such as Instagram appear to 
have strong momentum right 
now, and Facebook’s roughly 
$16 billion acquisition of the 
messaging app WhatsApp 
demonstrates that instant 
messaging shows signs of 
becoming a dominant 
communication medium.
Inevitably, social networks 
will continue to evolve, and 
it’s those businesses and 
brands that correspondingly 
evolve their social marketing 
message that will succeed. O

How to make 
a viral hit
We look at how you can create easily sharable 
content to promote yourself or a brand
We’ve all heard of the concept 
of content going viral. But 
what does that phrase actually 
mean? In essence, it’s quite 
simple - the repeated sharing 
of a piece of content and its 
continual spread across the 
internet. Viral content might 
be an image, a link, or the 
contents of an email. But the 
thing that ties all viral content 
together is shareability. It 
must be compelling, but it 
doesn’t have to be longform. 
There are two key elements 
to getting content to go viral. 
Firstly, you need to create 
great content, although it 
doesn’t have to be totally 
original. Secondly, you need 
to get it noticed. We’ll cover 
the secrets to both, and some 
success stories to learn from.
Viral content has been 
around almost as long as the 
internet – certainly the 
concepts were first written 
about in the mid to late 1990s. 
The first viral videos began 
circulating around that time, 
with Dancing Baby, a 3D 
animated rendering of its 
titular subject matter, being a 
notable example.
SOCIAL SHARING
These days, it’s easier to 
upload and share video using 
sites such as YouTube and 
Vimeo, and social networks 
have totally changed the way 
we share all kinds of content. 
No longer does sharing take 
the form of a round-robin 
email to friends. It is now a 
much simpler act, and we’re 
more than happy to promote 
links that we would not have 
forwarded to friends in the 
past simply because there is a 
distinct, temporary nature to 
shared content, though it has 
more permanence than 
people often think. However, 
it is hard at first to get people 
sharing your content, and you 
will need to lean on friends to 
get things going. If they look 
at the content and are keen to 
share it, then it’s likely to be 
good content. If they are 
reluctant to share the content, 
that probably means it isn’t as 
shareable as it should be.
MAKE YOURSELF VISIBLE
Content doesn’t stay in view 
for long now, so it’s worth 
thinking of zeitgeisty ways to 
promote yours. People search 
for current trends, both on 
social networks and on the 
web more broadly, and it’s 
good to tap into that. Check 
out the popular hashtags and 
trends on Twitter. Facebook 
recently added a spotlight on 
trending topics as well.

Start your own business  |  109 
The main concern, though, 
is that your content must be 
compelling. It must speak to 
people without the need for 
accompanying paragraphs of 
text. It must have an engaging 
headline or tagline that will 
make people wake up and take 
notice. It needs to be short 
and pithy, so that it is as 
effective in a tweet as it is on a 
web page. It’s important to 
think about the keywords and 
hashtags you attach to your 
content, but it’s important 
not to over-egg the situation 
in any accompanying text. 
‘Check out this amazing video 
about a cute dog’ is far more 
likely to appeal to people than 
something that’s heavy on 
keywords or hashtags. 
BE POSITIVE
Having said that, make sure 
you have done enough to 
make the content searchable. 
Be careful to sense check 
everything, and come from 
the point of view that people 
will be cynical. Corporate and 
commercial hashtags attached 
to viral content can get abused 
and backfire on the brands 
that use them. For example, 
in 2012 the #McDStories 
hashtag was intended for 
people to share positive 
stories about fast food chain 
McDonald’s. Instead, people 
posted somewhat negative 
things, subverting the brand’s 
efforts into a bashtag. Make 
sure your hashtags can’t be 
misappropriated like this. 
Most viral content uses  
feel-good tactics to encourage 
sharing. Humour tends to go a 
long way, too. Check out 
BuzzFeed (http://buzzfeed.
com) for examples of this. 
That site is so successful it has 
branched out with several 
country-specific editions.
VISUAL STIMULUS
Visual content is popular, 
whether it’s a video that plays 
where it is shared, or a photo 
that gives a taste of what’s 
to come when you click on it. 
Visuals are compelling. After 
all, discovering eye-catching 
content is a key reason to be 
on social networks. Viral 
videos have proved successful. 
Look at the music video for 
Gangnam Style (2.1 billion 
YouTube views) or the 
humorous Charlie Bit My 
Finger – Again (805 million 
views). Often, as in the latter 
case, the video was never 
intended to go viral, and the 
father of the two boys 
featured in the video said he 
initially thought the clip was 
unremarkable. But it’s a cute 
clip that has broad appeal. 
Exercise extreme caution 
about sharing shocking, 
controversial or downright 
mean content. Pranks that go 
wrong can be seen as being 
very negative, while shock 
without the backup of humour 
or resultant compassion can 
be looked down upon and be 
damaging to your brand. 
That’s why positive content is 
the best for sharing. That said, 
some of the most shared viral 
content is of real-life events 
such as freak weather.
Over the last few years, viral 
marketing has somewhat 
taken over the whole concept 
of ‘going viral’ – for every 
#McDStories that exists there 
are numerous other successful 
viral marketing campaigns, 
and agencies get paid a lot of 
money to come up with new 
and effective ideas. They don’t 
always have to be complex. 
Nike employed Brazilian 
footballer Ronaldinho to run 
through a two-minute 
repertoire of football skills. 
That video has been shared 
millions of times. 
However, you don’t need big 
cash to succeed with social 
marketing. You need to 
ensure that your content is 
supremely shareable. Sounds 
easy, doesn’t it? It can be 
surprisingly difficult, but turn 
over to find further examples 
of shareable content and tips.

110  |   Start your own business
Key tips to help you get your content noticed 
and get it shared widely on social networks
Top tips for 
making virals
IS IT SHAREABLE?
Imagine your content coming from 
somebody else’s Facebook account. If 
you can’t picture yourself clicking 
‘Share’ to put it on your wall, that 
content isn’t shareable enough. Step 
out of your own bubble, and ensure 
your content is appropriate for people 
beyond your friends. Would somebody 
in another country understand it?
THINK OF A HASHTAG
Hashtags are a great idea. Try to come 
up with something original, but heed 
our warning and don’t use one that 
could be confused with something 
else. Simple hashtags are the best,  
but don’t be afraid to have a longer 
hashtag to distinguish it from others. 
Acronyms can be dangerous if they 
mean something else as well.
IT COULD BE PARODY
Internet memes spread rapidly. They 
often mimic other things by offering 
alternative versions of embarrassing 
moments to spread across YouTube 
and communities such as Reddit and 
Tumblr. Hitler parody videos adapted 
from the film Downfall are the perfect 
example of this, albeit one that has 
been used rather a lot.
USE SHOCK TACTICS WITH CARE
Be careful when you attempt to shock. 
Consider whether it will it leave a bad 
feeling. It’s no coincidence that 
corporate virals are overwhelmingly 
positive. They’re designed to leave you 
with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Even when 
a shock factor seems appropriate, 
such as to encourage charitable 
donations, it can reduce shareability.
GET NOTICED
Once you’ve created your content, the 
challenge is to get it shared so it can 
stand a change of spreading. One of 
the best ways to do this is to get it 
shared by someone who has a lot of 
followers, or by several people who 
have a reasonable number of followers 
each. Remember that all virals need to 
start from somewhere.
IMAGES WORK
Videos are shared the most, but 
images can work just as well. Many 
memes are based on modified images. 
The great thing about images is how 
they enhance a Facebook or Twitter 
post. If people don’t necessarily need 
to click through to other content, 
images are great for people to share 
on other networks such as Instagram.

Making 
a video
Short and impactful video can 
make your content explode
If you’re specifically targeting 
a social network where posts 
stick around for a little while, 
such as Facebook or Google+, 
video is a great thing for 
people to share, provided it is 
done well. Making your own 
video is the best way to make 
something sharable, although 
it’s not the easiest thing to 
create, and it certainly isn’t 
the cheapest type of content.
People love original content. 
That is content that’s newly 
originated, rather than 
necessarily being novel in 
concept. The first thing you 
need to have is a clear idea of 
what it is you want to achieve 
in the video – or at least, an 
impactful idea.
SHAREABILITY IS FOREMOST
Make sure you keep the 
concept of shareability at the 
heart of your idea. There’s no 
point in producing something 
that’s difficult for people to 
get their heads around. The 
production of the video needs 
to be simple and relatively 
short. If a video is too long, 
people stop watching, and the 
impact will be lost. You need 
people to want more of your 
video, not less. And you also 
want them to reach the end 
thinking the video was really 
good, and to click ‘Share’. 
GOOD PERSONALITY 
Most of the best viral videos 
are parodies, from the Hitler 
movie Downfall to putting 
new words over old songs and 
movies. Combining famous 
video clips, song lyrics and 
movie lines are also popular.
Entertainment is key with 
almost every well-shared 
video. The videos that are 
most successful don’t need 
captioning or a voiceover, but 
in those that feature them, 
the captions are simple. If you 
want to put a voice on your 
video, make sure the words 
are spoken slowly and don’t 
confuse. Simple concepts are 
what you need.
The human element is very 
important in video. It is a 
common factor in the success 
of a huge proportion of the 
most shared videos. For 
commercial videos, you need 
to make sure that it doesn’t 
damage your brand or 
company. Also make sure your 
video is genuine. You may 
come up with an excellent 
prank, but if it’s faked, people 
will see through it. 
ACCESSIBILITY
Where you choose to host 
your video is also important. 
YouTube is a common option 
as it integrates with most 
other services, but your video 
can be hosted elsewhere. If 
you want to target Facebook 
specifically, there’s no reason 
why you can’t upload your 
video to that site instead. 
Videos hosted in this way look 
a lot better on Facebook walls. 
If your video is successful, you 
can always upload it to 
YouTube afterwards.
Consider search terms and 
search results when naming, 
captioning and keywording 
your video, especially for 
zeitgeisty videos. You’ll get a 
real benefit if people can find 
your video in search results. 
Also, don’t forget to add a 
website link in your video’s

marketing
Twitter can be about more than just chatting to your friends but, 
crucially, using it for marketing shouldn’t be all that different
CAN BUY ME LOVE
As well as building an audience organically, 
Twitter lets you reach people directly by 
buying ads. Just sign in with your Twitter 
account at http://ads.twitter.com. Here 
you can run two kinds of campaigns. You 
either promote your account itself – the 
idea being you’ll get more of the right kinds 
of followers – or you promote specific 
tweets, so that you can spread the word 
about new products, sales and the like.
You decide how much you want to spend 
overall, and then target the sort of people 
you want to attract, such as by listing other 
Twitter usernames (competitors, for 
example) whose followers you’d like to be 
following you as well.
At the last count, Twitter had 
around 300 million monthly 
active users, which gives you a 
huge community to which you 
can market your products just 
by bashing out 140 characters; 
the five minutes you spend 
waiting for a bus can become 
an opportunity to market your 
brand from your mobile 
phone. It’s not quite as simple 
as that, but the good news is 
that it really isn’t that much 
more complicated either.
Assuming you’re already 
familiar with Twitter, the 
mental gear-change that’s 
required to switch from using 
it for personal reasons to 
business marketing isn’t as 
pronounced as you might 
think. Lots of people, when 
they start tweeting as a brand, 
get stiff and formal, and treat 
Twitter like it’s a one-way 
broadcast platform from 
which they can tell the world 
about their company. But  
your customers and potential 
customers are more likely to 
engage with your brand when 
it’s warm and passionate 
about the type of products it 
makes, and its business, too.
STRATEGIC PLANNING
The most important thing is 
to decide what your strategy 
is. Why are you using Twitter 
as a marketing tool, and what 
do you hope to get out of it? 
Perhaps it’s specifically to 
drive sales, which is a valid 
and understandable reason, 
but be careful with your 
approach, because people 
dislike being hounded to buy 
things. Maybe it’s to build up 
your brand’s personality. You 
may want to be part of a 
community of people and 
brands involved with a 
subject. Or you might simply 
want to share your passion for 
something with others.
Your motivation is likely to 
be a mix of all those things 
and more. That’s fine, but 
make sure you have clearly 
defined your goal for 
marketing via Twitter. Be 
prepared to adapt and refine 
your strategy as you go. Do  
so in response to customer 
engagement with your tweets, 
and as a reaction to broader 
trends on Twitter, in your 
marketplace and in the 
macroeconomic world, but do 
have a strategy to begin with.

Start your own business  |  113 
Regardless, your brand 
needs to have a personality 
and a human quality, so even 
before you start tweeting 
about your products, make 
sure you are establishing that 
personality. Tweet behind-
the-scenes glimpses of how 
your products are made, 
retweet stuff you think is 
interesting or cool, or make a 
meme. Don’t be afraid to be a 
little whimsical or irrelevant. 
Remember that it’s called 
‘Twitter’, so not every tweet 
needs to be important or 
grand. Think about what sort 
of tweets you like to see and 
retweet, and try to replicate 
that sort of thing. Ultimately, 
people will only retweet you if 
they find your tweets funny, 
useful or interesting.
It’s usually a bad idea to 
hook up your Twitter account 
to an auto-post service that 
will tweet headlines and story 
snippets from your blog or 
news site. The results almost 
always feel impersonal and 
ill-fitting for what you are 
trying to achieve. Tweet the 
stories, sure, but craft the 
tweets by hand, and try to 
include a picture – now that 
http://twitter.com and all the 
official and unofficial apps 
display pictures, it’s a great 
way to make tweets stand out. 
You can use any image, but for 
best results make your picture 
1,024×512 pixels.
ASSESS YOUR SUCCESS
Don’t obsess about how many 
followers you have. Although 
it’s a useful metric, it isn’t the 
only one. Lots of accounts 
that have many thousands of 
followers have used some 
slightly shady tactics to 
acquire them, and the good 
news is that most of those 
followers aren’t actually 
valuable – or even real people 
in some cases. It’s far better 
to have a small number of 
followers who engage with 
you and who can be persuaded 
to buy from your brand.
Services such as Favstar 
(http://favstar.fm) let you 
track how many people like 
and retweet your tweets. If 
your tweets get more likes and 
retweets than an account with 
ten or a hundred times the 
number of followers you have, 
you’re doing it right.
It’s important to use 
analytics services such as 
Favstar to get a clear idea of 
what you’re doing that works 
well. Twitter provides simple 
analytics at http://analytics.
twitter.com, which can 
highlight successful tweets, 
and you don’t have to buy ads 
to use it. Followerwonk 
(http://followerwonk.com) 
can, among other things, help 
you identify which followers 
are most influential. You 
might want to show them 
some special attention.
MEANINGFUL FOLLOWERS
If you want to attract more 
real followers, you can do it 
either by just posting stuff 
that people will want to share 
to their followers, or by more 
overt means. The latter often 
means paying to get your 
brand in front of followers 
(see ‘Can buy me love’ on the 
opposite page), or by using 
something like a competition. 
Be careful to list terms and 
conditions, and unless you 
state otherwise, be prepared 
to send the prize anywhere in 
the world. Here’s an example, 
which would have a picture 
attached: “Win our three 
best-selling organic beers: 
bathbrewco.com/threefaves 
Follow and RT to enter; ends 
12 May 10am GMT.” Existing 
followers will retweet this, 
exposing the competition and 
the brand to new people, who 
might become new fans. 
Avoid the ambiguity of digits 
in dates as this may cause 
confusion between the USA 
and the UK. If you mention a 
time, also state the timezone.
Use Twitter to talk with 
customers, both existing 
and potential. Some will use 
your @username in their 
tweets, making it easy to 
respond to praise or criticism, 
but you can also keep an eye 
on more under-the-radar 
chatter by using Twitter’s 
search feature. 
Simply searching for your 
business name can show up 
lots of irrelevant tweets, but 
you can string together 
operators to narrow the 
search. See http://support.
twitter.com/articles/71577 
for details on how to do this. 
Responding to someone 
who is talking about but not 
to you might seem creepy, 
however, so bear that in mind 
when replying!
Analyse activity using services such as Followerwonk to get an idea of when 
your followers are most active, so you can target them efficiently.

It’s a good idea to follow a few successful brand accounts on Twitter 
to learn their methods – but who should you follow?
What makes a 
good account?
Innocent Drinks (@innocentdrinks) is one of 
the best examples of a brand on Twitter. First 
and foremost, it has personality, and that’s 
reflected by everything it posts.
Innocent tweets about promotions and 
partnerships, but always with cheery character, 
and engaging photos, videos and illustrations. 
This stuff might seem irrelevant, but it’s what 
people retweet, and each appearance in a 
stranger’s feed is marketing in the brand’s 
tone. It’s all about engendering good feeling so 
that people will feel they have a relationship 
with the brand when presented with a choice of 
a supermarket’s own-brand orange juice or a 
more expensive bottle of Innocent.
What you don’t see as a follower of the 
account, unless you also follow a person it is 
talking to, is how actively the team responds to 
customers. Innocent is fortunate to be seen as 
a nice company, in part due to its efforts on 
INNOCENT DRINKS
By mixing timeliness, brand values and humour, this 
tweet has so far been retweeted over 2,700 times.
http://twitter.com/innocentdrinks
social media. It proactively monitors Twitter 
for implicit and explicit mentions. Perhaps  
this is more PR than marketing, but it steers 
conversations and corrects what Innocent 
perceives to be misinformation about, say, the 
sugar content of its drinks.
It’s important that your marketing on Twitter 
is part of a broader and coherent campaign. For 
example, Innocent often sets up at a location to 
give away free smoothies, which it tells the 
wider world about using Twitter, which 
amplifies the message through retweets.
Some of Innocent’s most successful tweets, 
such as http://bit.ly/1gAZsvG and http://bit.
ly/1n4r8GM, show a relentless focus on brand 
personality, but note the focus on its products, 
too. Other non-traditional brand accounts 
include @betfairpoker, @wstonesoxfordst and  
@arenaflowers. Arena Flowers explains its 
approach at http://bit.ly/1QwuVer.

Follow these six simple rules when you’re marketing your business using 
Twitter, to give your social media campaigns the best chance of success!
The six rules 
of Twitter
BE AUTHENTIC
If you remember nothing else from 
this section, remember this: we used 
to idolise ‘brands’ but now we’re 
suspicious of them, so don’t use 
corporate-speak. Be passionate, 
excited and friendly. In many cases, 
it’s better to be cheery and interested 
in the world around you than trying to 
appear professional – or, to put it 
another way, stuffy.
ENGAGE!
A common mistake with any social 
media network is to treat it as a 
broadcast medium. That is, people 
have stuff they want to tell the world 
about, so they just blast messages out. 
This may work in a very few cases, but 
most companies need to engage on a 
more personal level on Twitter. Reply 
to mentions of your brand, follow 
interesting people, and don’t forget to 
talk to them as well. 
USE ANALYTICS
You’ve likely got very good instincts 
about what your audience will be 
interested in, what time of day people 
are most active, and so on, but don’t 
rely solely on intuition. Analytics 
platforms such as Buffer, Favstar and 
even Twitter’s simple analytics at 
http://analytics.twitter.com can help 
you understand what is successful, so 
you can do more of it.
IT CAN’T SOLELY BE A MARKETING CHANNEL
If the only thing your Twitter account 
is used for is to tweet news about your 
company, any real followers you 
manage to attract are likely to tire 
quickly and leave you. Tweet stuff 
that’s valuable and engaging for your 
audience, such as tips, funny stuff 
and, yes, even news from competitor 
brands. If they can trust you to bring 
them everything, they will stay.
AVOID NEGATIVITY
If you get into a slanging match in real 
life, few people will hear about it, and 
fewer still will see it for themselves. 
But on Twitter, any bitchiness or 
negativity can be retweeted in an 
instant, and if it’s juicy, people will 
share and talk about it. Your bad 
tweets can be redistributed just as 
easily as good ones, and the spread 
will take on a life of its own. The PR 
fallout can be disastrous.
DON’T RETWEET PRAISE (TOO MUCH)
We all like to be told we’re doing a 
good job, and retweeting the 
occasional bit of praise into your 
followers’ feeds can be helpful to 
remind them you’re a good brand, 
especially if it aligns with your 
strategic goals. However, think about 
this from the perspective of your 
followers. They didn’t follow you to 
hear how great you are. O

HOW TO GET MORE 
FACEBOOK LIKES
Engaging fans to spread the word through 
shareable content will put you on the fast 
track to acquiring new Likes. The most 
noticeable change in Likes will come from 
content you create, so share eye-catching 
images, be relevant, be authentic and 
update your page frequently. Keep your 
page worth a visit by starting conversations 
and adding exclusive Facebook content to 
your audience’s news feeds, such as 
competitions and offers. Use Facebook 
Insights to understand your audience’s 
reactions to individual posts and do more of 
what works best.
From leading brands that 
boost TV campaigns with 
Facebook engagement, to 
growing businesses that host 
creative online offers to keep 
fans excited, any business 
– big or small – can use 
Facebook as a marketing tool.
Social media platforms such 
as Facebook bridge the gap 
between businesses and 
consumers, improving 
communication between 
them and leaving brands with 
a better understanding of 
their audience. Whether 
you’re a freelance illustrator, 
successful independent 
restaurant or a globally-
recognised brand, Facebook 
should be at the top of your 
marketing strategy.
FACEBOOK GROUPS AND PAGES
Facebook groups and pages 
each have their own 
strengths. Groups are ideal for 
intimate communication in 
communities – to discuss a 
topic, and to share ideas and 
opinions – while pages are 
designed to help businesses, 
organisations and 
professionals create an 
authentic presence online  
to represent their values. 
Therefore, creating a 
Facebook page for your brand 
or business is the first step 
towards getting yourself 
noticed on the social network.
KEY STEPS TO PROMOTING 
YOURSELF, YOUR BUSINESS 
OR A BRAND ON FACEBOOK
Suggesting your page to 
friends, putting up signs in 
your bricks-and-mortar store, 
adding a Like button to your 
website, and including links to 
your page wherever possible 
will all contribute to page 
growth. However, the most 
noticeable change in Likes will 
be as a result of the content 
you post on your page. 
Let’s look at ways to 
optimise your Facebook 
marketing effort by 
identifying your audience, 
creating compelling content, 
and analysing your strategy. 
01 IDENTIFYING YOUR AUDIENCE
Having a clear understanding 
of your audience will help you 
tailor your Facebook posts to 
suit its interests. Most brands 
have customer profiles 
outlined through authorised 
data collection, but as a 
growing business or 

Start your own business  |  117 
freelancer, taking time to 
identify your ideal customer 
will help you to find more  
of them.
HOW TO IDENTIFY YOUR AUDIENCE:
 
O Create a description of 
your ideal customer. 
Decide on age, gender, 
personality, occupation, 
hobbies, spending 
habits, likes and dislikes. 
 
O Locate your online 
audience. Which 
websites interest them? 
What are they reading? 
What are they likely to 
search for online? 
 
O Determine their end 
goals. What is it about 
your product or service 
that they like? 
 
O Write a more detailed 
outline of each 
identifiable customer. 
Give them each a name 
and backstory. Write a 
short day-in-the-life-of 
paragraph about each 
one that you can refer to.
These are just a few 
questions to get you started. 
There are hundreds of 
customer profiling templates 
online that can help you build 
a more comprehensive 
portrait. Piecing together a 
clear picture of who you’re 
‘talking’ to online will help 
determine the tone for each 
post and what customers are 
likely to respond to.
02 CREATE YOUR FACEBOOK 
CONTENT STRATEGY
A Facebook content strategy is 
a daily outline of page updates 
scheduled for the week or 
month ahead which include 
things you want to promote or 
share. For example, you know 
next week you’ll publish a 
blog post about an offer 
available on your website’s 
shop, which will start on 
Saturday and end on the 
following Monday. For your 
Facebook strategy you could 
schedule the following: an 
announcement of the 
upcoming offer the Thursday 
before, share a link to the blog 
post on Saturday, and post a 
product image on Sunday 
evening as a reminder to 
those who haven’t already 
taken advantage.
Map out your Facebook 
strategy by determining your 
weekly or monthly goals and 
devising daily content around 
it. Remember to look at your 
customer profile to find ways 
of working in content that 
would interest them. Your 
goals may be to drive traffic to 
your online store, to increase 
your reach and Page Likes, or 
to build brand awareness. 
They may be all of these 
things, so a strategy is central 
to creating posts that get 
attention and get results.
BEST POST EVER
According to Posting Best 
Practices (http://on.fb.me/ 
1z1c0Bi), rich photography 
and captivating videos, asking 
questions, and Facebook 
Offers (a paid-for service) – or 
offers of your own – receive 
the best response. If you think 
about your personal use of 
Facebook, are these the same 
things that catch your eye? 
Arizona-based State Bicycle 
Co. has been featured on 
Facebook’s Success Stories 
page. Each week it shares a 
stunning image of a bike with 
an inspiring quote dropped 
over the top. This generates a 
lot of shares and plenty more 
comments and likes. The 
company calls it Motivational 
Monday. Not only is it the 
perfect day for inspirational 
posts that banish Monday 
blues, the content is visually 
striking. Most importantly, 
it’s shareable, which extends 
the reach of the page and 
potentially leads to new fans.
03 ANALYSE YOUR PROGRESS 
WITH FACEBOOK INSIGHTS
With your page in place and 
content being published 
regularly, you can measure 
your success using Facebook 
Insights. Facebook’s easy-to-
use analytics service helps you 
evaluate different aspects of 
your page. Tools such as 
Engagement, Page Likes and  
Post Reach help with tracking 
your best-performing content 
by discovering who’s engaging 
with you, and at what time. 
Use these tools to find out 
what’s working well, write 
your own best practice, then 
replicate it. These steps are 
simple, but it takes an active 
page to make discoveries that 
lead to growth.
State Bicycle Company creates content that inspires and motivates while 
building awareness of its limited edition bikes.

Tatty marketing 
on Facebook
Tatty Devine is an independent British jeweller 
whose studios are located in London and Kent. 
It specialises in expressive, standout jewellery 
with hints of retro fashion. The brand used 
Facebook to bring the products from its British 
studios to a global audience. Its aim: to turn 
Facebook Likes into online purchases, shop 
visits and brand awareness.
A quick scan over the brand’s Facebook page 
makes it clear that Tatty Devine knows its 
audience. Its page is kept fresh by varying  
post types from anything between new 
collections, sneak peeks and discounted item 
announcements, all of which are accompanied 
by gorgeous images and enthusiastic copy.
In spring/summer 2013, Tatty Devine 
launched the successful Wishing Tree 
campaign. It encouraged fans to leave 
comments on its Facebook page with their 
springtime wishes. These comments would be 
written out and pinned to an in-store wishing 
tree, photos of which were uploaded soon after. 
This simple idea worked to bring a community 
of fans together by getting them to engage 
around a theme that wasn’t about a new offer

or competition, but which resulted in increased 
online sales and improved store footfall.
Tatty Devine’s sample sales have fans in 
screeches of sheer excitement. To promote the 
event, it created a public Facebook event 
(http://on.fb.me/1c6tkbz) and invited fans to 
visit its London store. It soon had more than 
400 guests attending. Other posts about the 
event included an announcement that 
newsletter subscribers would receive early 
access to buy ‘Lucky Dip’ boxes online, and an 
invitation to fans to submit song requests for 
the Sunday sample sale through comments. 
Many happy customers shared images of 
their Lucky Dips, and those wishing they’d got 
something else were given a means to swap 
items with other Tatty Devine shoppers 
through a one-month-only Swap Shop event.
Through both the Wishing Tree and Sample 
Sale campaigns, Tatty Devine created great 
excitement around its products using Facebook 
as the medium between it and its audience. It 
uses Facebook as the channel for driving online 
sales through good posting strategies and 
learning what its audience responds best to.

Six simple rules for promoting 
your Facebook page
Top 6 
Facebook tips
CREATE SHAREABLE CONTENT
Shareable content is a post that 
directly benefits your audience. When 
a fan shares your post, it appears on 
their timeline and their friends’ news 
feeds, so creating shareable content is 
important for page exposure and 
acquiring new Likes. People respond 
to a business or brand with a ‘human 
side’, so don’t be afraid to add your 
own flair. Combine your (clean) 
humour with content that helps your 
fans express their own identity. Now 
more than ever it’s important to put 
yourself in their shoes.
MEASURE AND ADJUST
Once 30 people have liked your  
page, you’ll be able to see your Page 
Insights, which tell you all about how 
your audience is responding to your 
content. Page Likes, Post Reach and 
Engagement tools are just some of  
the things you can use to track your 
best-performing posts. 
BE AVAILABLE
People love an authentic presence 
online, so be conversational and share 
what you’re genuinely interested in 
– it’s about quality, not quantity. 
Respond to both good and bad 
feedback. Experiment with post types 
and times. You can schedule posts on 
Facebook, which is a godsend for 
businesses with little digital resource.
FORGET FORMALITY
Say goodbye to formalities and loosen 
up already! People on Facebook are 
there primarily to catch up with 
friends, so if you want their attention, 
you have to talk with them as though 
you’re just another pal to encourage 
interaction, rather than sounding like 
a marketer. This is not to say that you 
shouldn’t be professional, but have a 
little fun with your status – what have 
you been up to?
REFERENCE
Do not take credit for any content that 
does not belong to you! This is not to 
say that you can’t share an image you 
think your audience would love to see 
on your page, even if you didn’t take it 
yourself. It simply means that you 
should, at all times, give credit where 
credit is due. Adding a link to the 
original source builds credibility and 
trust with your audience.
DON’T IRRITATE
Facebook likes an active page but 
people are quick to hit the Unlike 
button. The aim is to be consistent 
and to post regularly to counter this, 
but don’t overdo it. Ask yourself, 
“Would my audience share this?”, 
“Would they find it interesting?”, 
“Would they like to see this in their 
news feed?” – if the answer is yes 
(honestly), then go ahead. O

with a blog
Your website is about more than displaying your products. Adding an 
active blog establishes you want a deeper dialogue with customers
Developing a new website? 
Then make sure you don’t 
forget to build a blog into  
your marketing plan. It’s a 
powerful way to help visitors 
discover your website, it’s 
great at helping to build trust, 
and it makes keeping in touch 
with customers much easier.
Getting found in Google  
is a top marketing priority. 
Blogging brings a number of 
SEO benefits and plays an 
essential part in the drive  
to get high search engine 
rankings. New blog posts 
being placed on your website 
make Google happy in its 
quest to find fresh content. 
The blog content tends to 
stick to a central theme, 
which means there is going to 
be topical keyword density 
and relevance.
Blogs also tend to acquire 
links from other blogging 
websites, whether in the form 
of explicit links from other 
sites, trackbacks or links from 
blog directories. Of course, 
RSS feeds can ping Google  
the moment new content is 
published, triggering rapid-
fire indexing of the content.
One key benefit to a blog is 
the ability to keep in touch

MATT DAVIES
What’s your top priority when 
creating a new blog?
Each element of text needs to be styled 
in a legible way, which is easy on the 
eye and clearly differentiates each area 
of text. Think about using fonts, line 
spacing, sizes and colours effectively.
How should developers work 
with designers to build a blog?
My number one tip is for developers 
and designers to go through a 
wireframe process together before any 
designing or coding begins. After 
wireframes are in place, the designer 
can get creative on styling the elements 
and the developer can sit back and be 
content to know that what the designer 
comes back with will be possible.
What’s the future for blog design? 
Technology is moving us onwards into 
live microblogging, which is like Twitter 
but through blogs, with users 
exchanging small snippets of 
information quickly. This new 
technology will mean that layouts will 
probably become more conversation-
like as opposed to walls of text, which 
is the norm at the moment.

with your customers. Blog 
comments are a great two-
way communication channel. 
And unlike other forms of 
social media, you can 
moderate and edit comments 
before they go live, which 
appeals to many businesses 
worried about negative or 
libellous comments.
Do you want to ensure  
that your content can reach 
customers’ iPads? Then the 
Flipboard iPad app provides  
a fantastic interface to blog 
content just by providing  
the app with the address of 
your blog’s RSS feed.
There is a new marketing 
trick up the collective sleeve 
of the blogger: the principle of 
authorship. Photographs of 
authors appearing in search 
results alongside the articles 
they have written creates a 
more prominent and 
trustworthy search result. 
Google looks for good content 
from great authors, and it 
knows there is lots of that  
in blogs. By linking your 
Google+ profile to your blog, 
you can gain the additional 
benefit of being highly visible 
in search results. 
A blog hosted on your own 
domain gives all of the key 
SEO benefits: content on your 
domain, inbound links to your 
blog posts, and a customer 
experience where visitors are 
right in the mix of your own 
site’s marketing messages.

The right 
environment
Don’t let valued employees get away! Give them the work environment 
they deserve and they’ll love coming to work every day
Losing a valued employee can 
have an adverse effect on a 
business, especially those in 
specialist, niche areas, where 
it’s hard to find skilled 
employees. Not only does it 
mean that you have to put the 
business on hold while you 
recruit, but there’s also the 
time lost to you while you 
recruit, and there’s the cost of 
running recruitment adverts. 
According to a 2012 survey by 
the British Chambers of 
Commerce, over 40 per cent 
of companies estimate the 
cost of recruiting a new 
employee is more than 
£2,000, and in more than half 
(53 per cent) of the businesses 
surveyed, the business owner 
is responsible for recruitment. 
The simple way to reduce 
the effect of losing staff is to 
keep staff for longer. It’s not 
quite that simple, but that 
should be your primary aim. 
You stand to save a lot of time 
and money, and you’ll also be 
creating a loyal and happy 
workforce. If you do it right, 
you’ll produce better work as 
well as better workers. 
THERE’S NO I IN TEAM
An important skill worth 
developing is team work. 
Business owners are used to 
doing things and making 
decisions on their own; for 
many business owners, the 
ability to do what you want, 
when you want, was one of 
the main driving forces 
behind starting a business. 
Creating teams, however, is 
one way of reinforcing loyalty. 
If an employee works as part 
of a team that they feel happy 
with, the decision to move 
will be harder to make than if 
they work on their own. 
Additionally, people like 
working in teams and believe 
they’re more effective in 
them. A Vodafone survey from 
2012 showed that employees 
were clear about the negative 
impacts of not working 
effectively as a team. The 
most serious of these were 
delayed decision-making 
(named by 31 per cent), 
unhappy customers through 
poor response (29 per cent), 
missing targets because of 
lack of timely input from 
colleagues (28 per cent), and 
making the wrong decisions 
because of lack of access to 
the right people and 
information (28 per cent). 
Creating teams involves 
understanding the different 
personalities in the team, and 
helping them work together. 
It also involves working in 
close proximity to your staff. 
You can’t create teams if you 
sit in a separate office all day. 
You need to get out and about, 
and be part of the team. 
CREATING STAFF INCENTIVES
Although they may carry a 
financial cost, staff initiative 
schemes can also be highly 
effective. A well thought-out 
system of incentives and 
perks – discounts at stores, 

Start your own business  |  125 
DELEGATE  
AND LISTEN
Too many business owners refuse to pass 
on responsibilities and this can have a 
negative effect on your employees. 
Delegation is one way of building trust in 
the workforce. Don’t micro-manage your 
employees; instead, allow them to use their 
own initiative and they in turn will feel 
empowered to make decisions and meet 
their goals. Micro-management can lead to 
frustration and resentment, particularly if it 
looks as though you, as a manager, are not 
doing your part.
Tactfully listening to and encouraging 
people, while giving positive credit where 
it’s due, are also key elements of good 
communication. This includes avoiding 
excessive criticism or blame – even if you 
might be handing it out in your own head – 
but finding out what the root problem is and 
addressing it, and perhaps introducing 
training as required. Training staff and 
investing in expanding and improving their 
skills may be expensive, but it helps them 
to understand that you value them and that 
you want them to be the best at what they 
do. Investing in professional training 
courses can help with this; don’t be 
concerned that staff with training will leave 
– if they’re happy and valued, they’ll stay.
health benefits, and the like 
– can help to retain staff. They 
can also be used to recognise 
good work and initiative, and 
encourage staff and teams to 
compete for the prize.
Perks often carry tax breaks 
for the business. These 
include occupational 
pensions, health insurance, 
season tickets and social 
events. Subsidies for training 
might also be available, as 
well as membership of social 
clubs or a gym. All of these 
can help staff feel valued, 
while giving them a more 
enjoyable working experience.
Rewards can also take other 
forms. For example, there are 
many award schemes for best 
business teams and best 
employees. Why not enter 
your teams or your best 
employee for an award? Even 
if they don’t win, it still shows 
that you care enough to regard 
them as valuable, both to you 
and the business. 
FLEXIBLE WORKING
Being able to work flexibly is 
one of the key things that new 
employees are looking for. 
According to a 2010 study by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, 
flexible working was more 
than twice as important to 
staff than more traditional 
benefits such as performance-
related bonuses. In the 
survey, flexible working was 
rated as the most important 
benefit by 47 per cent of 
respondents, while bonuses 
came in second with 19 per 
cent. That’s a significant 
figure, and it doesn’t take into 
account those employees who 
might have rated it second 
most important. Basically, 
everybody likes to work 
around their personal lives, 
rather than the other way 
around. You don’t have to 
make work completely 
optional, of course – just give 
your employees a little 
freedom when they need it.
Just because you offer 
flexible working doesn’t mean 
you’re losing staff or work 
time; there are plenty of 
technologies such as laptops, 
tablets, smartphones, cloud 
technologies, remote email 
and the like that enable staff 
to work from home or on the 
move, and there’s plenty of 
data to show that staff 
working from home are more 
effective because there are 
fewer interruptions and it’s 
easier to concentrate away 
from the office. Be sensible, 
though; if an employee with 
young children is asking to 
work from home on a regular 
basis, a restructuring of 
working hours may be a more 
realistic option for their 
productivity. Work with your 
employees to find the balance.
MAKE IT A HOME FROM HOME
Finally, getting the working 
environment right can really 
help, particularly if employees 
are going to spend long hours 
in the office. An attractive 
office, kitchen and rest area 
improve morale massively. 
Features that can help here 
include colourful and leafy 
plants, beautiful paintings 
and interesting lighting. Even 
desks make a difference, 
because it’s where your 
employees are likely to spend 
most of their days. A rickety 
old flat-pack table isn’t going 
to have the same impact as a 
stylish professional design. 
Invest in good office chairs, 
too, because ergonomics can 
make the difference between 
a healthy employee and a 
hunched-over one.
You may also want to create 
a business culture where 
people work hard and play 
hard. If this is the case, it 
could be worth investing in a 
decent pool table or a games 
console and flat-screen, or a 
relaxing area with beanbags 
and sofas. Give staff the 
freedom to work where they 
want. Put desks on wheels. 
Make work fun and your staff

Finding  
staff online
Looking for digital employees you can depend upon? Cast your eye online 
to find the very best in digital-savvy workers, quickly and easily
You buy goods online, you 
work online, you get your 
news online, so why not get 
new employees online as well? 
We look at some of the key 
places to advertise on the 
internet and offer basic advice 
on recruitment on the web – 
and the good news is that 
many of the places to 
advertise are free.
The traditional way of 
attracting new talent to your 
business was through the 
local press; however, while 
that may still provide some 
good candidates, it won’t get 
you the best. It may not even 
get you in front of all the ideal 
candidates in your area. Ask 
yourself whether you ever 
read the local press. If you 
don’t, how do you expect to 
attract the right staff through 
a local advert? By using the 
internet, you widen your 
scope to be able to recruit 
candidates from all around 
the country and even the rest 
of the world, and it doesn’t 
need to be complicated or 
expensive either.
ADVERTISE ON YOUR WEBSITE
One of the most effective 
places for recruiting is your 
own website. Your customers 
are a really good pool to 
recruit from – they already 
know your business and like 
your products, and the only 
cost involved is the time it 
takes to add a jobs section to 
your site. You can advertise 
your post for as long as you 
like, and put a lot of effort 
into making it look really 
attractive, something you 
won’t get the chance to do 
with other job sites.
If your business also has  
its own Facebook page or 
LinkedIn group, you should 
also advertise the job position 
there, because many of your 
potential candidates may only 
ever view your Facebook and 
LinkedIn pages and never 
actually pay a visit to your 
main website. 
ADVERTISE ON LINKEDIN
LinkedIn (www.linkedin.com) 
is one of the largest business 
networks online and is a great 
place to find new staff for your 
business. There are several 
ways to recruit on LinkedIn. 
Firstly, you can go through 
the jobs part of the website 
and post a job online. 
Alternatively, you can use 
your own networks to widen 
your scope and find potential 
candidates by using other 
people’s contacts, and then 
approach your potential 
employees directly.
Your network is the best 
place to begin raising 
awareness about your jobs – 
that’s where you’ll find your 
strongest referrals. Your 
connections might be 
interested in the job 
themselves, or they may know 
some good candidates. Use 
LinkedIn status updates to tell 
your network about open 
positions, and add a link to 
the post itself. As well as your 

Start your own business  |  127 
USING 
NEWSLETTERS
If you produce an email newsletter or send 
regular emails to your customers, you’ve 
got the perfect outlet for people specifically 
interested in your brand or product. And 
maybe they’re the sort of people you’d like 
to work with. Next time you produce a 
newsletter, add in a link to the job. A 
prospective candidate may read your 
newsletters but might not have enough 
time to visit your website regularly. Make 
sure you use the language and style that 
your company traditionally employs, but 
remember that you’re in a non-formal 
environment; you could afford to make your 
job opening look exciting and fun, more so 
than you might in a standard job ad.
own pages, LinkedIn interest 
groups are a good place to 
advertise. Look at the 
professional groups that cater 
for your industry, as well as 
the groups that cater for the 
particular sector you’re 
interested in. For example, if 
you’re looking for a sales 
person for your publishing 
business, look at both the 
sales groups and any 
publishing related groups.
Be careful that you don’t 
jump into every relevant 
group to put up a job advert. 
That will be viewed as spam 
and will do nothing for your 
business reputation, and it 
could even be enough to get 
you banned from some 
groups. So make sure that  
the group is appropriate, and 
that you follow any guidelines 
on recruiting on that group – 
most are happy to allow job 
adverts, but others only want 
jobs in certain parts of the 
group or on specific job 
boards. If in doubt, contact 
the group owner.
ADVERTISE JOBS ON TWITTER
Twitter is a quick way to get 
your message out to all your 
followers and on to the wider 
world. Unfortunately, most 
jobs can’t be described in the 
140 characters available on 
Twitter, so try to get as many 
details in as you can and add a 
short link through something 
such as Is.gd (http://is.gd), 
Owly (http://ow.ly) or Google 
(http://goo.gl) to the full job 
description on your site. 
To widen the scope of your 
job tweet, use appropriate 
hashtags. For example, the 
tweet “Wanted office temp for 
business in Leeds area £18k 
http://is.gd/TRBC1” will be 
more effective on Twitter if 
you add a few hashtags and 
change the wording slightly. 
“#recruiting office temp for 
business in #Leeds area £18k 
http://is.gd/TRBC1” has a 
much wider reach, so it’s 
worth experimenting with 
what you write. This last tweet 
will be seen by people 
following either of the words 
‘recruiting’ or ‘Leeds’, and 
will get your advert out to a 
much wider audience. 
Typical hashtags for job 
listings include #jobs, 
#recruiting, #jobposting, but 
to narrow it down, use more 
specific hashtags, such as or 
#prjobs or #salesjobs. These 
are only really effective if your 
target is actually searching for 
them, but you can be sure 
people are.
Don’t make the tweet too 
long because ideally you’ll 
want people to retweet it to 
their friends, so try to make 
the whole ad no more than 
120 characters, and don’t 
over-tag a single tweet. 
Twitter recommends using  
no more than two hashtags 
per tweet.
PUT YOUR JOB ON A JOB SITE
Sites such as Jobsite (www.
jobsite.co.uk), Monster (www.
monster.co.uk), or Total Jobs 
(www.totaljobs.com) replace 
the traditional role of a job 
agency, or a national or local 
newspaper. You can post job 
opportunities as you would in 
a paper, or you can match 
your job requirements to CVs 
posted by people already 
looking for jobs. 
They also offer a whole raft 
of free tools that can help you 
decide what salary to offer  
for the role. Total Jobs, for 
example, has a jobs barometer 
service that enables you to see 
how popular a particular job 
sector is in a particular 
location, while Monster has a 
Salary Calculator tool to tell 
you whether you’re offering 
the right sort of salary for 
your area.
As well as the big national 
job boards, there are also 
numerous sites aimed at 
specific niches that are worth 
looking at – for example, 
Simply Sales Jobs (www.
simplysalesjobs.co.uk) for 
sales roles and Workmates 
(www.workmates.co.uk) for 
construction jobs. Wherever 
you look, the job market is in 
a difficult place at the 
moment; be prepared to wade 
through a swathe of 
applications, many of which 
will be from candidates who 
don’t fit your company. It’s up 
to you to find the right person 
for the right job. Make your 
interview process fit your

Build the 
perfect team
Staffing is a dark and 
mysterious art. Anyone can 
recruit, but nurturing your 
team, inspiring them and 
managing them in order to get 
the best out of them is a rare 
skill set. Bringing staff into 
your business is about strong, 
compassionate leadership. 
It’s also about sympathetic 
and intelligent people-
A business is only as good as the people who work for 
it, but how do you find and keep the best employees?
management, and knowing 
how to build and keep a 
happy, productive team. 
There comes a point when 
every company must decide 
whether or not to expand. In 
this feature, we explore 
exactly what the best ways of 
staffing, managing and 
keeping a crack team of 
professionals involve.

Start your own business  |  129 

130  |   Start your own business
Growing your crack squad doesn’t just mean adding more people for more 
of the same work. It’s important to evolve your capabilities as you expand
Expanding  
your team
You’d think it would be easy 
to recognise when more staff 
are required for your business. 
It’s when you have more work 
than your existing team can 
handle, right? Not so. Growing 
a team has only a little to do 
with capacity and everything 
to do with capability.
Success hinges on finding 
the right people. You don’t 
simply want more of the same 
skills; you want to be able to 
expand the amount of work 
you can handle, while at the 
same time developing the 
type of work you do – and  
the way to achieve that is 
through smart management 
and team building. 
THINK VARIETY
The first few people you hire 
should offer the skills your 
current setup lacks; not just 
more hands. If you and your 
existing team have the 
creative design skills nailed, 
for example, bring in someone 
to handle things such as new 
business development and 
client relationships, leaving 
you free to work.
FREELANCE FLEXIBILITY
If your need is purely 
capacity-based and you need 
more people to do the same 
work, then consider hiring 
freelance staff. More hands 
means freeing up the creative 
directors in your team, 
enabling them to focus on 
bigger ideas. But...
KEEP THE GOOD ONES
Hang on to those who make 
themselves indispensable. 
Freelancers might cost more 
to get in full-time, but if they 
bring the necessary skills, 
complement your team’s 
existing skill sets and fit with 
the general vibe, try to get 
them on a contract. It’s far 
cheaper than recruiting. 
THINK AHEAD
Staff hiring tends to be an 
accounting decision, based 
upon previous years’ financial 
performance and the next 
year’s financial forecast. Your 
STRATEGY GAME
Age, energy and experience are relevant, 
but someone who has a strong grasp of 
strategy is a dream find, and that should 
always be your number one employment 
credential. If someone can articulate why 
their approach is better than an existing 
option, what they can deliver and where 
they can take a project, they are really 
worth employing. What you don’t need are 
more hands. You need different hands and 
better hands.

Start your own business  |  131 
decision to hire should be 
based on these metrics 
(boring as that sounds) 
because, ultimately, hiring 
more staff is an expansion of 
your business.
COMPLEMENTARY CHARACTERS
Always look for a good 
personality mix among your 
staff, particularly within 
departments. You don’t want 
two strong leaders in the 
accounts department, or a 
team of autoworkers who 
can’t take a decision. Identify 
what’s missing, then make 
sure you hire accordingly. 
DON’T BE SEDUCED BY A CV
Talent spotting isn’t as easy as 
it seems, and a CV ultimately 
proves little more than 
blagging ability. Assess 
character and look out for 
people who display the three 
WRITE A JOB DESCRIPTION
Describing the role, the key challenges involved, the knowledge and 
skills required and the employee’s position in the business is hugely 
important to a successful interview. This will weed out anyone vastly 
unsuitable, as well as making sure the candidate knows what they’re 
letting themselves in for.
ASK YOUR CONTACTS
Word of mouth recommendations are a very important way of bringing 
in good staff. People often pass on tips about skilled workers, and 
Twitter or LinkedIn can winkle out applicants, too. It might also be 
worth attending graduate shows to find emerging talent before anyone 
else does.
FREELANCERS
You may already have freelancers working with you. If they’re doing a 
great job, why not look into making them permanent so they don’t take 
their knowledge and experience with them when they leave? 
Freelancers often enjoy the freelance way of working, but they might be 
flattered that you value them so much you want to keep them around.
CV REVIEW
Looking at a portfolio or CV can only teach you about an applicant’s 
skills in self promotion, but a discussion about it will provide insight. 
Getting them to prepare a presentation of their work and talk through 
their past roles will enable you to gauge their passion for your area of 
business, and how they could fit into your company.
WORK EXERCISE
A work exercise can be a valuable part of any interview but many 
candidates baulk at the idea, seeing it as working for free or worrying 
about the legal implications if they are under exclusive contract. 
However, getting a candidate to narrate their process gives a strong 
idea of their working methods.
LET THEM ASK QUESTIONS
Asking the right questions is helpful, but deliberately leaving out 
important points so the interviewee can bring them up can be effective, 
and will help establish whether you’re both on the same wavelength. Be 
prepared to jump in rather than allow important points to go 
unaddressed, though. Nervous candidates can easily clam up in 
interview situations.

Es: education, energy and a 
degree of eclecticism. No 
environment will be stale with 
a good mix of people.
AIM HIGH
Always employ people who 
are better than you and your 
existing team. Why? Because 
they will share their skills, 
bring others up to their own 
level, benefit the entire 
company culture and drive 
your enterprise forward. It 
seems obvious, but you’d be 
surprised how many 
employers allow their 
superiority complex to 
prevent this happening. 
BE OPEN-MINDED
Don’t ignore word of mouth 
recommendations or even 
unsolicited CVs and portfolios. 
Keep an open mind when 
recruiting, particularly when 
it comes to transferable skills. 
Just because someone has no 
directly relevant experience it 
doesn’t mean that they won’t 
be the perfect candidate for 
your business.
WATCH OUT FOR EGOS
They might be hard to spot in 
an interview scenario, but be 
sure to avoid hiring the type 
of person who will look to 
dominate your existing team, 
or throw their toys out of the 
pram at the drop of a hat. It’s 
an unworkable relationship.

It might be tempting to place cash in hand or avoid the rigmarole of filling 
in employment paperwork, but it’s a bad idea. Follow these tips
Keep it legit 
when employing
REGISTER AS AN EMPLOYER
In the UK you need to tell the HMRC and 
set up a PAYE scheme; in the US you’ll 
need an employment identification 
number (EIN) from the US Internal 
Revenue Service.
PAY THE RIGHT TAXES
You’re responsible for taking out your 
employees’ taxes with each salary payment 
and ensuring the government gets its 
share. Do not neglect your tax and 
reporting duties.
GET INSURANCE
As soon as you become an employer, you 
need employers’ liability insurance – or 
workers’ compensation insurance in the 
US. Make sure you know your country’s 
specific legal requirements. 
EMPLOY SOMEONE ILLEGALLY
You’ll face a crushing fine if you fail to 
carry out employment checks to ensure 
new staff are legally entitled to work in the 
country your business is based in. Keep 
copies of passports or proof of citizenship 
on file. 
FOOL YOURSELF
What constitutes an employee isn’t as 
straightforward as you might think. There 
are criteria such as level of control and how 
they’re paid – check the HMRC’s 
employment status checker. 
FORGET HEALTH AND SAFETY
Make sure you carry out a full risk 
assessment and fill out the relevant legal 
paperwork. In the UK, for instance, that’s 
form OSR1.

134  |   Start your own business
There are many aspects to consider when structuring a business. Ensure your 
team gets what it deserves by considering the key areas of staff wellbeing
Keep your team 
healthy and happy
If you’ve decided to recruit 
new staff, you’ll need to be up 
to scratch with employment 
law. Sickness, maternity 
leave, redundancy and more 
– you need to have policies in 
place to deal with typical 
situations that could arise 
before they do. Your team 
members have rights, but it’s 
also about seeing the bigger 
picture – happy employees are 
more productive. So what do 
you need to consider? Here are 
some issues to start with…
SICK LEAVE
Illness is a fact of life, so set 
out a comprehensive absence 
policy and make sure your 
team has access to it. You 
need to monitor all sick leave 
– not just long-term. Make 
sure you know who is absent, 
when and why. This helps if 
you need to address frequent 
absentees and can also flag up 
any problems in your 
business; you have a duty of 
care to ensure workload is 
acceptable and the 
environment is healthy. Sites 
like www.bit.ly/XhnuQT (UK) 
and www.1.usa.gov/Zh5lGe 
(US) provide a wealth of info. 
GRIEVANCES
As with sick leave, you need 
clear policies in place to deal 
with any grievances that may 
arise and could result in a 
disciplinary procedure. Make 
sure your staff are aware of 
what is and isn’t acceptable in 
terms of performance and 
behaviour. If an employee 
comes to you with a grievance, 
an informal discussion is 
often the best way to resolve 
the situation – make notes, in 
case the matter escalates. 
DISCIPLINE
With good performance 
management, disciplinary 
action should usually be 
avoidable. The government 
provides good advice at http://
bit.ly/1oul9hHe, as does the 
Labour Relations Agency at 
www.bit.ly/LRA-PDF.
REDUNDANCY
It’s tough, but sometimes you 
might need to make a member 
of staff redundant. If this is 
the case, there are strict 
guidelines to follow (see www.
gov.uk/staff-redundant). For 
example, you need to show 
there is a legitimate reason  
for redundancy (it’s not 
legitimate to get rid of people 
just because they aren’t 
performing well). Make sure 
that you document everything 
and communicate the process 
thoroughly at all stages – 
there’s nothing worse than 
employees being kept in the 
dark about the future of their 
employment.
FLEXIBLE WORKING
Your employees have the right 
to request flexible working – 
and you can choose whether 
or not to accept their request. 
It may be necessary for your 
employees to start or finish 
SPECIALIST HELP
Specific legal requirements vary depending 
on the country in which your company is 
based, so it’s a good idea to consult a 
lawyer or HR specialist for help in drawing 
up your policies. You’ll have to pay for this, 
but investing in the wellbeing of your 
employees – and making sure you’re 
covered for all eventualities – is money well 
spent. In the UK, free advice is provided by 
the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration 
Service (www.acas.org.uk).

Start your own business  |  135 
work later, for example. You 
have a legal duty to accept 
flexible working requests 
from any member of staff who 
you’ve employed for at least 
26 weeks – not just those with 
children. However, how you 
deal with this is really 
dependent on your company, 
the requirements of your 
output, and your management 
style. In America, more than a 
quarter of employees work to 
flexible schedules.
EQUAL OPPORTUNITIES
Write an equal opportunities 
policy, and make sure that  
you are completely up on the 
definition of bullying and 
harassment. You need to 
make sure that your job 
adverts and recruitment 
processes don’t discriminate.
MATERNITY LEAVE
This a complex area, so make 
sure you’re aware of your legal 
obligations – services such as 
ACAS can help (www.acas.org.
uk). In the UK, you must offer 
statutory or enhanced 
maternity pay and all 
pregnant employees are 
entitled to maternity leave.
OFFER BETTER SALARIES
Financial reward is the number one reason for staff members becoming 
disillusioned and looking for other opportunities. If you’re not paying 
the market rate, you won’t be able to keep good employees, so review 
your salary bands at regular intervals throughout the year with your 
finance team.
TREAT PEOPLE FAIRLY
Be transparent with your salary banding as well. That means paying 
similar salaries to those undertaking similar roles. If you have two 
account managers, for example, with varying income levels, chances 
are you’ll lose one very quickly. Be honest and open about how you pay 
your staff.
INVEST IN YOUR TEAM
Show commitment to staff through training and development. That 
means conducting appraisals and salary reviews, and encouraging 
people to progress professionally. Offer at least one paid-for training 
opportunity a year. Remember that if you invest in the skill sets of your 
staff, it’s your business that benefits in the short term.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
Hold open forum discussions with your staff at regular intervals, and 
keep them abreast of business news. Make all your employees feel 
involved with the managerial aspects of the company and offer a place 
for them to air their concerns with senior management, either publicly 
or anonymously.
CREATIVE OUTLETS
Foster free time for your staff to take on creative challenges and 
become a sponsor. These could be local events, self-initiated projects, 
or work for community or charity projects. Encourage your team 
members to conduct their own projects and give them adequate time to 
work on them.
DON’T FORGET THE FUN AND GAMES
Make sure your company is talked about as a fun and rewarding place 
to work. Take your staff for away days, Christmas excursions and 
summer holidays. Invite in guest speakers and interesting guests to 
inspire them. Make competing businesses envy your reputation for

Internships are a great way to foster new and exciting talent. But don’t 
be fooled – bringing an intern into your business isn’t straightforward
Thinking of taking 
on an intern?
UNDERSTAND INTERNSHIPS
They’re always paid and must involve 
on-the-job training in some capacity. 
Cheap labour it is not.
KNOW THE LAW
In the UK, interns with set hours or a 
schedule of work will likely be classed as 
workers. You’ll face a hefty fine if you 
don’t make the right contributions.
AGREE RESPONSIBILITIES
Treat your intern as part of your core team 
– discuss working hours and objectives – 
and a good intern will act the part.
THINK LONG TERM
An internship should be seen as a trial to a 
full-time position, so treat it as such.
THINK IT’S WORK EXPERIENCE
Work experience tends to be a shorter 
engagement and generally involves a wider 
range of tasks. 
ASSUME IT’S UNPAID
Unless you’re very specific, interns are 
likely to be classed as workers and entitled 
to minimum wage.
BE UNAVAILABLE
Interns want experience and nurturing – 
don’t expect them to hit the ground 
running. Ensure someone is available and 
suitable to mentor them.
THINK CHEAP LABOUR
An internship is a charitable, benevolent 
position aimed at helping a young worker 
gain experience.

It’s a role that shouldn’t be underestimated.  
We talk to designer and writer Adrian Shaughnessy
The benefits of a 
good manager 
Don’t think of project management as an 
irksome in-house overhead. Think of it as a 
key factor in the way you look after your clients 
and produce top quality output. Viewed like 
this, project management becomes a way of 
boosting your income – so it pays to employ 
someone in this role. 
“A project manager needs production and 
project management skills, sophisticated and 
sympathetic communication skills, and 
ruthless efficiency backed up by 360-degree 
vision,” says designer, writer and industry 
commentator Adrian Shaughnessy. “Their 
remit includes the following: scheduling; 
budgeting; profitability reporting; invoicing; 
IT; booking freelancers; managing timesheets 
and, most important, keeping accurate records.
“However, no project manager is worth 
employing if he or she can’t combine an 
internal co-ordination role with an ability to 
ADRIAN SHAUGHNESSY
Co-founder of progressive publishing venture Unit Editions
www.uniteditions.com
deal with outsiders – clients, suppliers and 
freelancers all need to be treated with tact and 
professionalism. If a project manager has poor 
communication skills, your clients will speak 
to one of the other workers instead, reducing 
the value of a dedicated manager.
“It’s also imperative project managers know 
how to cost a job, supply a quote, negotiate a 
fee, alert clients to extra charges, prepare 
invoices, monitor costs, alert you to problems 
and work with suppliers.
“Once when my studio was working on a 
large print project and the task was near 
completion, our client mentioned they hadn’t 
yet organised distribution. Our project 
manager said: ‘Would you like me to get you a 
quote for this?’ A few days later, our client 
asked us to undertake the UK distribution and 
sent us a purchase order for £87,000. Now 
that’s what I call good management.” O

Your business needs a platform for creativity 
while still ensuring the work gets done
Nail your 
workflow
Perfect project management 
– the idea might put a damper 
on your enthusiasm, but being 
organised is the key to turning 
out great work, on time, every 
time. Your business needs to 
be on top of deadlines and 
demands, budgets and billing, 
files and feedback – not to 
mention any staff you might 
bring in along the way. So 
what’s the secret? Whether 
they’re manual or digital, you 
need some efficient systems 
and processes in place that 
will ensure your projects are 
approached logically.

LONG-TERM 
PLANNING
Anyone who’s completed two major projects 
in the same week knows that clashing 
deadlines can be a killer. If possible, develop 
a cycle so that your major projects conclude 
every two weeks or so. That way, your 
attention isn’t divided, and you can give the 
best to each client.
If you undertake work for external clients, you need to keep 
on top of jobs or risk being swamped by your workload
Plan your projects 
with precision
ANALYSE THE BRIEF
Once you’ve won a project, 
analyse the brief and work out 
what you need to do to get it 
done. How much research do 
you need to do into the 
market your client operates 
in, its brand, business, 
competitors and so forth? 
Plan time for research and 
inspiration, sketching out 
ideas and refining them.
GET THE DETAILS RIGHT
Be as specific as possible with 
establishing the brief and 
what you’re offering for the 
fee. This can take time but 
often saves a lot of pain in the 
long run. The more you can 
open up about your processes, 
the more the client will see 
the value in what you do.
LOG THE CONVERSATION
Make notes while talking to 
clients and keep a document 
logging feedback. After you’ve 
had a meeting or phone call, 
send an email outlining what 
you agreed. If anything has 
been misunderstood, the 
client can clarify it.
SHARE THE LOAD
If you’re running a business 
with other people, split the 
project management 
workload. Each of you could 
take ownership of one project 
at a time and see it through to 
completion. Agree an overall 
system, though. If each 
person’s system is different, 
it leads to confusion.
GET OTHER PEOPLE GOING FIRST
If you need to assign parts of 
your project to others, brief 
them and get them started 
before you sit down to work 
yourself. You won’t feel 
there’s something hanging 
over you, and it also prevents 
bottlenecks and last minute 
‘why isn’t this done?’ bedlam.
TIMESHEETS 
Record how many hours your 
business spends on each job 
with weekly timesheets, and 
use this data to calculate if 
you’re working efficiently and 
charging the right amount.
GIVE CLIENTS DEADLINES
Sometimes your client has to 
meet deadlines, too, or you 
won’t be able to deliver. If you 
require any information or 
components from your client, 
communicate with your 
contact very early on about 
what you need and agree 
deadlines regarding when 
you’ll receive it all.
TIME FOR FEEDBACK
Don’t estimate how long each 
stage is going to take based 
solely on how long you think 
it would take you personally. 
Build in time for you and your 
employees to discuss and 
develop the work, and for 
client feedback. Amendments 
take longer than expected.
A LITTLE PESSIMISM
What can go wrong will go 
wrong isn’t always true, but 
anticipating problems is 
crucial. Listen to what clients, 
staff and suppliers tell you. If 
they say ‘yes’ to a deadline but 
add that they’re very busy, it’s 
worth asking questions to find 
out if they’re being realistic.

You’ll face conflicting demands on your time, so 
a bit of forward-planning will pay dividends
Essential time 
management tips
FIRST THE WORST
Many people find that 
tackling the jobs they don’t 
like first thing gets them out 
of the way. Know when you’re 
most productive and slam-
dunk the tedious, tricky or 
more taxing tasks while 
you’re at your peak.
STICK TO THE LIST
Effective project management 
begins and ends with 
managing your own time. 
Make a to-do list every day, 
and stick to it. Include back-
up entries – things you can 
get to if something on your 
list is delayed or falls through.
LEARN TO PRIORITISE
Tasks will vary from day to 
day but some will be more 
important than others, so 
when you draw up your to-do 
list, mark the jobs that really 
must be done that day.
BRING IN A PROJECT MANAGER
Bringing in a decent project 
manager is the fastest way to 
improve efficiency in your 
business if you find it tricky. 
WORK IN FLEXIBILITY
Some days things won’t go as 
planned, so allow flexibility to 
swap things around. And  
be realistic – don’t set 
unachievable goals. Can  
you delegate any tasks? 
EAT, DRINK AND BE MERRY
It’s important to balance  
the pressures of running a 
business with taking time out 
to relax; exercising, eating 
healthily and getting enough 
sleep all help boost your 
overall productivity. 
REGULATE EMAIL
Checking your email every 
five minutes is the fastest way 
to reduce your efficiency. Set a 
schedule for dealing with 
email – perhaps first thing in 
the morning and again in the 
afternoon, depending on 
where in the world your 
clients are based. 
BE STRICT WITH CLIENTS
Once you’ve got an email 
schedule in place, let your 
clients know so that they 
don’t inundate you with 
phone calls instead. If you 
find one client is taking up 
more time than is reasonable, 
be firm and politely explain 
that their requests are 
becoming unproductive.

“A CHART WILL TELL YOU 
WHEN YOU NEED HELP”
Less labour-intensive than expensive project management 
programs, a Gantt chart will track your progress
Gantt chart  
masterclass
BREAK IT DOWN
You can set up a Gantt chart in 
Excel or Word, or draw it on a 
whiteboard. The first thing 
you need to do is break your 
job down according to the 
tasks that need to be done 
– by you, your team, and by 
the client. More information 
about creating a Gantt chart in 
Excel can be found at www.
bit.ly/Gantt-Excel.
LIST IT ALL
Write the tasks in a list down 
the left-hand side. What the 
list comprises will, of course, 
depend on the type of 
business you’re in and what 
kinds of products or services 
you provide. However, you’ll 
also need to factor in any time 
your work is being checked by 
clients, and any amendments 
that may be necessary.
FACTOR IN TIME
Time is represented left to 
right across the top of the 
chart. Most projects rely on 
contributors’ time measured 
in days, so it’s best to have 
small columns headed ‘M’, 
‘T’, ‘W’, ‘T’ and ‘F’ – and 
above that block them out 
into weeks. It’s up to you if 
you include weekends.
SET UP AN ORDER
Now work out which bits of 
the project can be done 
independently, and which 
ones rely on one another. If 
you run a design studio, for 
example, the layout of a 
brochure could be started, but 
it can’t be completed without 
the copy, photography and 
illustrations. Re-order tasks 
in the order you need them 
completed down the left-
hand side.
COLOUR CODE
The tricky bit is estimating 
how much time is required for 
each element. Plot this in, 
colour coding the days as you 
fill them in on the chart going 
from left to right. Staying 
with the design studio 
example, concepts might take 
four days, client approval two 
days, layout five days, and 
copywriting two days. A 
dependency pattern will  
then emerge. 
FORMULA
Estimating how long a section 
of a project will take comes 
with experience. One rough 
formula is to take an 
optimistic assessment of each 
element of the project and a 
worst-case view, and then 
average the two.
COST IT
Cost the project by 
multiplying the amount you 
expect to spend per day on 
each part of the project by the 
number of days blocked out 
for it. Photography might cost 
£300 per day, design £150, 
copywriting £200, web 
development £200 and so 
forth. The chart will also tell 
you when you’re going to need 
to get external help in, such as 
a photographer or web 
developer, so you can book 
them well in advance. 
SUBJECT TO CHANGE
Update your Gantt chart as 
you go along because things 
are bound to change. 
However, make sure you keep 
your original, so when the 
project is complete, you can 
go back and see where your 
projections were correct, and 
where they were shaky.

Great communication is the key to running a successful business, 
say Marc Atkinson and Anna Ekelund of MARC&ANNA
Case study: 
MARC&ANNA
Nine years ago, Marc Atkinson and Anna 
Ekelund set up MARC&ANNA, a studio working 
mainly in print design. They do a lot of work 
for major charities and cultural bodies 
including Arts Council England, English 
Heritage, Cancer Research UK and the World 
Wildlife Fund.
“One of us will manage each project,” 
explains Atkinson, “from clients to suppliers 
and designers. Each job usually runs in the 
following order, one leading to the next: 
briefing meeting or discussion, agreeing  
costs and schedule with client, briefing 
designers, managing the creative process, 
presentation, receiving feedback and managing 
the design development.”
There are often slight adjustments that need 
to be made depending on the nature of the 
project. If this is the case, the pair then 
conducts extra research to make sure they can 
MARC ATKINSON AND ANNA EKELUND
Co-founders, MARC&ANNA
adequately cover what’s required. Based in the 
Hackney area of east London, the studio has 
three full-time designers. Over the years 
they’ve honed their process but still can’t 
legislate for everything – once, 20,000 bags 
failed to arrive with a client, while paper 
samples regularly go missing. “We’ve both 
been managing print for over 10 years, but 
there are still things that surprise us, or 
happen unexpectedly. It can be bloody 
annoying, but you just have to embrace it and 
get on with things,” smiles Ekelund.
“Communication is key,” adds Atkinson. 
“You really have to regularly keep in touch 
with everyone – clients, suppliers and 
designers. You’ll never anticipate everything, 
so talking things through lessens the chance  
of any surprises. You’ll learn stuff this way, 
too, which you can then take into your  
next project.” O

development of the Macintosh 
famously took more than 
three years because of his 
insistence and obsession  
over the smallest details. 
Apparently, in the 1980s, Jobs 
insisted that in adverts and on 
packages the Apple logo was 
printed in six colours, not 
four, which was considerably 
more expensive. He would 
also reportedly sit in a 
restaurant and send his food 
back three times, or arrive at 
hotel suites for interviews and 
then decide that the piano 
needed repositioning at the 
last minute. 
STAY FOR THE LONG HAUL
Warren Buffett, one of the 
most successful investors of 
the 20th century, is known for 
his ability to make very few 
investment decisions and 
stick with them until the 
bitter end. All his bets are for 
the long-term. In 1993 he 
said, “I believe every business 
school graduate should sign 
when you show up for work.  
If you allow people to be 
themselves at work, they will 
enjoy what they are doing.”
The inimitable Steve Jobs is 
also in there, of course: 
“Picasso had a saying: ‘Good 
artists copy, great artists 
steal.’ We have always been 
shameless about stealing 
great ideas. Part of what made 
the Macintosh great was that 
the people who were working 
on it were musicians, poets, 
artists, historians, zoologists, 
who also happened to be the 
best computer scientists in 
the world.”
So what does unite the 
entrepreneurs we revere? 
What do their personality 
traits say about how to make 
it big?

an unbreakable contract 
promising not to make more 
than 20 major decisions in a 
lifetime. In a 40-year career, 
you would make a decision 
every two years.”
HAVE COURAGE
It takes a lot of guts to turn 
your back on a degree from 
one of the world’s best 
universities in pursuit of a big 
dream. But the expensively 
educated Bill Gates abandoned 
his studies at Harvard in 
favour of setting up his own 
company, Microsoft. Which 
did pretty well.
Similarly, Mark Zuckerberg 
dropped out of Harvard in his 
sophomore year to complete 
work on Facebook, rejecting 
offers from major 
corporations to buy his 
company for megabucks. In 
1971, one year after enrolling, 
Steve Wozniak (Apple) 
withdrew from the University 
of California, Berkeley. He 
made the right decision. 
MAKE HEADLINES
Virgin boss Richard Branson 
never shies away from being 
at the forefront of his brand 
– hell, he is his brand. He’s a 
kitesurfing, kilt-lifting 
attention-lover who showed 
up nearly nude in Times 
Square to promote Virgin 
Mobile. He’s also posed as a 
Malay warrior, worn his own 
brand of cosmetics and ridden 
a camel to promote his flights 
to the Middle East. 
In short, Branson knows full 
well the power of personality 
as PR and uses every 
opportunity to exploit it fully 
(read more on page 156).
DO THE RIGHT THING
Google founders Sergey Brin 
and Larry Page found 
themselves under immense 
pressure when they initially 
abided by Chinese requests to 
censor search results. But in 
2010 they decided to end 
dealings with China. They  
did the right thing, and 
demonstrated to their already 
loyal following that they  
really were a brand fighting 
for the greater good. See  
also Google’s attempts to 
eradicate global poverty and 
save the environment.
The Bill and Melinda Gates 
Foundation is the largest 
transparently operated 
private foundation in the 
world, with an endowment  
of more than $36bn. The 
$800m that the foundation 
gives every year for global 
health is almost as much as 
the annual budget of the 
United Nations World Health 
Organisation (WHO). 
CREATE YOUR MARKET
“If I’d asked the market what 
they wanted, they would have 
said ‘faster horses’,” Henry 
Ford famously said. He 
created the need for cars  
and also the wealth with 
which to buy the cars, while 
Jeff Bezos revolutionised the 
way the western world buys 
books when he left his cushy 
finance job to launch an 
online bookseller (with no 
advertising and no press), 
which has gone on to become 
the most successful internet 
retail site ever. In doing so, he 
created the territory that he is 
now king of.

LinkedIn’s Reid Hoffman

similar interests, like golfers 
who were looking for partners 
in their neighbourhood. 
Nobody was interested, but he 
wasn’t put off. LinkedIn is 
now the world’s largest 
business network.
HAVE FAITH
James Dyson famously made 
more than 5,000 prototypes of 
his vacuum cleaner, getting 
himself into considerable 
debt. But he never gave up.  
He tried to sell his invention 
to the major manufacturers 
but nobody wanted to know. 
Still he persevered. He 
encountered meeting after 
meeting with negative 
executives before deciding to 
manufacture them himself, 
testing them himself,  
ad nauseam.
Though he has always 
claimed not to be a 
businessman, Dyson exhibits 
one of the most advantageous 
business entrepreneurial 
traits, that of complete and 
utter faith in his product.
THINK DIFFERENTLY
Apart from the fact that it’s 
nearly the Apple slogan, you 
can pretty much bet that most 
of the entrepreneurs on John 
Byrne’s list at some point 
have ‘thought differently’, 
whether that’s been the 
organising of small companies 
into large distribution 
networks or the niggling idea 
that people might like to 
compare two students as 
being ‘hot’ or ‘not’.
As we’ve seen here, the 
ability to think differently  
and embrace change is usually 
the deciding factor between 
those who succeed and those 
who struggle. O

Richard 
Branson
Anyone else who called 
themselves Dr Yes would find 
themselves the object of 
ridicule. But Sir Richard 
Branson is the oldest person 
to kitesurf across the English 
Channel and the first person 
to hot air balloon across the 
Atlantic and the Pacific. It’s 
hard to find fault with anyone 
so enthusiastic about life. 
The self-proclaimed ‘tie-
loathing adventurer’ is as 
known for his daredevil 
pursuits as he is his business 
success. But the Virgin  
brand is one of the most 
recognisable in the world and 
it exceeds its products. As its 
figurehead, Branson is one  
of the most recognisable 
business ‘celebrities’ and an 
icon of can-do.
Born in London in 1950, 
Branson went into business 
aged 16 with youth culture 
magazine Student, from the 
crypt of a church. Though he 
dropped out of school, he’d

streak and it’s been reported 
that he tried and failed to sell

In his (bestselling, naturally) 
autobiography, Losing My

parents continually set us 
challenges. My mother was 
determined to make us 
independent. When I was four 
years old, she stopped the car 
a few miles from our house 
and made me find my own 
way home across the fields.  
I got hopelessly lost. My

teach me the importance of 
stamina and a sense of 
direction. I remember setting 
off in the dark, and I have a 
vague recollection of staying 
the night with a relative.  
I have no idea how I found 
their house, or how I got back 
to Shamley Green the next 
day, but I do remember finally 
walking into the kitchen like a 
conquering hero, feeling 
tremendously proud of my 
marathon bike ride and 
expecting a huge welcome. 
‘Well done, Ricky,’ Mum 
greeted me in the kitchen, 
where she was chopping 
onions. ‘Was that fun?  
Now, could you run along to 
the vicar’s? He’s got some 
logs he wants chopping and

I told him that you’d be back 
any minute.’”
RECORD BREAKER
Branson started Virgin as a 
mail order record retailer in 
1970, before opening a shop 
on Oxford Street in London. 
He founded Virgin Records  
in 1972. The label’s first 
recording artist, Mike 
Oldfield, recorded Tubular Bells 
at the Virgin recording studio, 
The Manor. The label went on 
to sign the likes of the Sex 
Pistols and The Rolling Stones 
and became the world’s 
biggest independent label. 
In his autobiography, 
Branson tells of a Mike 
Oldfield concert that was to 
take place at Queen Elizabeth 
Hall. Oldfield had decided he 
didn’t want to do the gig, 
despite the fact it was 
designed to showcase the 
label and its star. Branson 
took Oldfield for a drive that 
day in Branson’s Bentley and 
asked the musician if he’d like 
the car as a gift. Oldfield said 
he would and Branson said all 
he had to do was drive it to 
Queen Elizabeth Hall and go 
on stage. Tubular Bells sold 13m 
copies and became one of the 
bestselling records ever.
In the mid-1980s, Virgin 
was floated on the Stock 
Exchange but, reportedly, 
Branson’s style didn’t fit  
the way the shareholders 
expected him to behave, so he 
bought it back. 
Branson founded Virgin 
Atlantic in 1984, and in 1992, 
to keep the airline company 
afloat, Branson sold the  
Virgin label to EMI for £500m.  
In 1993, his Virgin Trains 
company obtained the 
franchises for the former 
InterCity West Coast and 
Cross-Country parts of British 
Rail. He went on to become 
the only person to build eight 
billion-dollar companies in 
eight different sectors. (He 
also launched Virgin Mobile 
in 1999, and Virgin Blue in 
Australia – now named Virgin 
Australia – in 2000.) He was 
made a knight in 1999. In

HIGHS  
AND LOWS
Richard Branson has lost more money 
than most of us will ever see. He’s quite 
happy to talk about the millions he’s lost 
over the years, and it’s for this reason  
that we are happy for his billions. “If you 
want to be a millionaire, start with a 
billion dollars and launch a new airline,”  
he famously said. One of his biggest 
mistakes was the ill-fated decision to 
take on multinational giant Coca-Cola 
when he launched Virgin Cola. In the US, 
despite Branson’s Times Square billboard, 
Virgin Cola could only secure a 0.5% 
market share by volume. 
GREATEST 
ACHIEVEMENT
Branson has done what many have tried 
and failed to do. He’s built a fortune on 
being a rebel and maintained his integrity 
in the process. If (or probably when)  
he pulls it off, Virgin Galactic, his 
commercial aerospace business, is  
likely to be his finest moment and the 
fulfilment of every small boy’s dream.
NET 
WORTH
As of March 2013, Forbes had Sir Richard 
as being worth $4.6bn.
2011, Virgin Money bought 
Northern Rock, in a move  
that some described as 
‘bittersweet’. In 2013, he sold 
Virgin Media to John Malone 
of Liberty Global for $400m.
No stranger to records – 
vinyl and daredevil – Branson 
has made the fastest ever 
Atlantic Ocean crossing, and 
kitesurfed across the Channel. 
He has said that his interest in 
life “comes from setting 
myself huge, apparently 
unachievable challenges and 
trying to rise above them”.
But it’s his space adventure, 
Virgin Galactic, that he’s 
described as the “greatest 
adventure of all”. Branson 
registered the name Virgin 
Galactic way back in 1999, and 
testing for commercial service 
is currently underway. 
Branson is the most 
followed person on LinkedIn 
(according to the Virgin 
website), with more than 
11.5m followers across five 
social networks, and manages 
to find time to write a daily 
blog, which covers everything 
from his house renovations 
through observations of 
beasts in the wild to take-
away inspirational quotes 
such as, “Think small to grow 
big. Keep your eye on the 
bigger picture, but don’t slip 
on attention to detail.”
“Back when I was a 
teenager, I thought that with 
the right bunch of people 
anything was possible, and 
that turned out to be the 
case,” said Branson in a 
recent Entrepreneur article. 
This sums up his attitude. 
“The people I surrounded 
myself with made the 
difference,” he says. “If you 
treat your employees right, 
they will treat your customers 
right, and sustained profits 
will follow.”
PEOPLE POWER
Says Charlotte Sweeney, co- 
author of business book The 
Executive Diet and founder of 
Charlotte Sweeney Associates, 
“No matter what someone’s 
background is, where they’re 
from, their job title or gender, 
Branson is known for hiring 
people with vision. He takes a 
far more inclusive approach 
than many, looking for great 
ideas and skills that will be an 
asset to the organisation. 
Branson is a real pioneer, and 
takes his employees along for 
the adventure.”
Branson’s management 
style is famously personal. He 
has said, “In the same way 
that I tend to make up my 
mind about people within 30 
seconds of meeting them,  
I also make up my mind about 
whether a business proposal 
excites me within 30 seconds 
of looking at it. I rely more on 
gut instinct than researching 
huge amounts of statistics.”
Sweeney agrees that this is 
key to his success, “Trust and 
professional respect are the 
best motivators in the modern 
workplace. This is the type of 
environment that Richard 
Branson seems to forge. We 
see it played out time and 
again in the values of his 
brands, and the way he talks 
about his ventures.”
Sweeney adds, “Branson 
knows he doesn’t have all the 
great ideas, or all the answers; 
he is not scared to make 
mistakes, and knows there are 
lessons to be learnt from 
them. This style of leadership 
really empowers people to 
think for themselves and 
push the boundaries.”
There are now more than 
100 Virgin companies 
worldwide, employing 
approximately 60,000 people 
in more than 50 countries. 
Branson lives on Necker 
Island, with his second wife 
Joan, and has two children, 
Holly and Sam. O

Haraldur
Thorleifssone
Despite dabbling in 
everything from philosophy 
to finance and structural 
engineering in his younger 
years, design has been the one 
constant in Haraldur 
Thorleifsson – aka Halli’s – 
life. And once he’d settled on 
a career pushing pixels around 
the internet, there was 
nothing half-hearted about 
his efforts. 
So far he’s racked up a client 
list that includes the likes of 
Google, The Economist, 
YouTube and Microsoft, set up 
his own full-service agency 
– Ueno – and picked up 
Webbys, Awwwards and FWAs 
– not to mention a net 
magazine award for his 
outstanding portfolio site 
(haraldurthorleifsson.com). 
The prolific web designer not confined by 
geographical location or razors
UENO.CO
We chatted to the nomadic 
designer to find out how he 
got started, the key to a great 
personal site and what it was 
like working with Santa.
Hello! Why don’t you 
introduce yourself and  
your work?
HT: Hey there! My name is 
Halli, I’m a creative director 
and designer of things that 
appear on screens. I’m the 
founder and principal of Ueno 
(ueno.co), a full-service 
digital agency. I’m originally 
from Iceland but for the last 
few years I’ve been working 
mainly for international 
clients. Our current clients at 
Ueno include great companies 
like Google, Fitbit, Reuters, 
Medium and Dropbox.
When did you first become 
interested in design?
HT: I started designing after I 
took an IT course as part of my 
studies in finance at the local 
university. I quickly moved 
on to Flash, where I stayed for 
a few years, and then I came 
back to design. I’ve really only 
ever designed pixels. I can’t 
draw much on a piece of 
paper, and print design has 
never interested me – there’s 
way too much physical stuff in 
the world.
What has your career  
path been?
HT: For a long time I had an 
on-again, off-again 
relationship with design.  
I used design to support 
myself through university, 

Start your own business  |  155 
finishing a BA in philosophy, 
a BS in finance and then I 
went on to an MS degree in 
economics. Around the time 
I was looking for topics for my 
dissertation in economics I 
realised I didn’t want to be an 
economist, so I put that on 
hold and started to design 
again. At one point or another 
I have studied construction 
engineering, development 
studies for the Third World 
and song-writing. I guess you 
could say I’ve been all over  
the place, but for the last  
five to seven years most 
of my professional work has 
been in some way related  
to design.
In 2007 I moved to New 
York to work for Cuban 
Council, which was a small 
digital agency with some very 
big clients. I stayed there for 
about a year before moving 
back to San Francisco to focus 
on my freelance career. I did a 
lot of work with Upperquad,  
a SF-based agency, and then 
late last year I started my own 
digital agency, Ueno, based  
in Iceland.

Village life 
Thorleifsson 
helped create a 
site for Google 
Village at SXSW, 
including 
illustrating  
the site.
What prompted you to start 
your own agency? Did it 
throw up any unexpected 
challenges?
HT: I had been working on my 
own for about seven years and 
the projects were getting 
bigger and more complicated. 
I always had collaborators that 
I would bring in on projects, 
as needed, so in a way I was 
already running an agency. 
But I realised I was hitting a 
ceiling on scale, and I also  
had problems explaining to 
potential clients that they 
weren’t just getting me,  
it was a full digital offering.  
So I gathered some of my 
collaborators, found a few 
new people and brought it all 
into a single entity. I think the 
challenges are there but none 
that I wasn’t expecting. To be 
honest I was expecting it to be 
harder than it has proven to 
be. But it’s early days yet, 
check back with me in a  
few months!
So far in your career you’ve  
worked with a huge number 
of top tech companies.  
How do you go about landing 
such big clients?
The first steps are always the 
hardest, but once you have a 
good track record and some 
solid projects under your  
belt, you can use those as 
proof of your ability. We get  
a lot of work referred to us,  
so it helps to have good 
relationships with clients – 
my tips would be to deliver on 
time, be nice and help them 
achieve their goals. I also get 
a lot of project requests 
through my personal website 
and Dribbble account. My site 
has been featured here and 
there and I’ve managed to 
build up a large Dribbble 
following, which helps.
Again, with such a roster of 
clients, how do you keep 
yourself creatively fresh?  
Do you ever feel burned out?
HT: I sometimes work too 
much and it almost always 
leads to burnout. I think 
the 40-hour work week is 
there for a reason. You need to 
spend time with your family 
and friends. Travel, listen to 
music, meet new people. 
Basically take time to enjoy 
life before it’s over. 
What advice would you  
give a senior designer 
looking to step up and 
become a creative director? 
HT: Know your strengths and 
weaknesses. Build your own 
team and know their 
strengths and weaknesses, 
too. Trust the people you work 
with, give them as much 
creative freedom as possible 
but know when to nudge them 
onto the right track. Have a 
vision for the project and be 
prepared to fight for it. 
Realise that the client has 
business objectives that might 
not necessarily fit your 
original creative vision. 
Adapt. Realise you are very 
likely living in a designer-
developer bubble, so you 
might want to expand your 
circle of friends. 
You won Best Online 
Portfolio in this year’s  
net magazine awards. 
Congratulations! What’s  
the secret to a winning  
portfolio site?
HT: Thanks! Well, having 
good projects to show off is 
obviously a plus. I try to build 
a story around the projects, 
draw out interesting assets 
and concepts, give a bit of a 
glimpse of what happened 
behind the scenes and show  
a bit of my character.  
I also had quite a bit of help 
from my good friend James 
Dickie, who did all the coding 
and had some great ideas  
and insights. 
The Google Santa Tracker 
(google.co.uk/santatracker) 
was a big hit. How did 
the project come about?
HT: The Google Maps team 
came to Upperquad in the 
autumn of 2012 and asked if 
the team had some good

OFFICE CULTURE
WHAT’S ON YOUR DESKTOP TODAY?
Soda water, Mac Mini, Apple display, 
iPhone, iPad Mini. A banana. 
LITTLE THINGS THAT MAKE YOUR LIFE 
WORTHWHILE
Websites: Twitter, TED, Dribbble, Wikipedia 
Apps: Spotify, Gmail, Flipboard, 
Google Maps, InstagramReading: Anything 
by Haruki Murakami or Paul Auster. I’ve just 
read Creativity Inc, which was pretty good.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON THE WALLS?
At the moment they’re totally blank.
WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR LUNCH?
I usually work from home and eat with my 
wife and our daughter, but I’m working from 
the Ueno office in Iceland for the next 
couple of months. I try and invite a friend or 
colleague over a few times a week to eat 
with us, so I can catch up with the people I 
know here before I leave the country again.
WHAT HOURS DO YOU WORK?
Depends on where I am in the world.  
Most of my clients are in the Bay Area so I 
need to adjust to their schedule. When I 
was in Japan that meant waking up 5-6am.  
In Europe it means staying up until close  
to midnight.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO?
The Ueno office is really nice. We have 
a shared space with a few other tech 
companies. There’s a fussball table, board 
games, and on Fridays there is music, 
games and beer.

holiday ideas. The core idea  
of the Santa Tracker – a site 
where kids could follow Santa 
as he travelled the world, 
handing out gifts – was 
already there. But we quickly 
realised that we needed some 
kind of platform to build 
suspense before the 24th,  
so we came up with the idea  
of Santa’s Village. In 2012, 
Santa’s Village had a few 
games and scenes but in 2013 
we went all out, created 24 
unique experiences and 
turned the whole village into 
an advent calendar. 
And – without using the 
word ‘magic’ – how does the 
site work?
HT: For me ‘magic’ is pretty 
much the right word. I don’t 
code, myself, so I can’t really 
go into the specifics of it but 
we had such an amazing group 
of developers and they pretty 
much were able to pull off all 
the insane ideas we threw at 
them. By the end they even 
managed to make the whole 
site (games and all) fully 
responsive which I think is  
a truly remarkable feat. 
The Santa project team was 
distributed all around the 
globe. What challenges did 
this present?
HT: Most of the work I’ve

Thorleifsson takes an IT course as part of 
his university studies, which involves 
creating a simple HTML page.
MAY 1998
Gets his first paid-for project as 
a designer and developer.
MARCH 1998
Launches his first agency with a few other 
people. It goes bust a year later.
OCTOBER 2004
Starts working at a local bank’s marketing 
department as a designer.
SEPTEMBER 2006
Moves to New York to work for boutique 
agency Cuban Council.
DECEMBER 2007
Starts freelancing.
MARCH 2009
Works on his first Google project 
as a freelancer with Upperquad.
MAY 2012
His daugher is born: a very successful 
personal project launched!
SEPTEMBER 2012
Starts focusing on building his own brand: 
developing his personal site and building 
a Dribbble following.
2013
Launches Ueno, lands a lot of good 
projects and wins some prestigious 
awards: a pretty amazing year.
A run-down on what Haraldur Thorleifsson did and when
done in the last seven years  
or so has been done off-site  
so at this point I am pretty 
used to it. For me it means 
spending a lot of time on 
Google Hangouts and I have 
come quite good at calculating 
what time it is in different 
parts of the world. When we 
did the first Santa project I 
was in Tokyo and I decided 
that I wasn’t going to let 
geography get in the way 
when sourcing the talent.  
So I started building the  
best team I could find.  
By the end we had a lead 
illustrator over in New 
Zealand and key people in 
Sydney, Chicago, Reykjavik, 
London, Stockholm and a 
bunch of other places.  
There were some early 
mornings and late nights, 
but in the end I think it all 
worked out. 
What’s the biggest lesson 
you’ve learned about 
working with a team spread 
across the world?
HT: I spend about half my  
day on Google Hangouts.  
It’s probably the one piece  
of software I couldn’t really 
work without. It’s simple  
and easy to set up for new 
people, but the killer  
feature for me is the  
focused screen sharing.  
I’ve also tried to use  
project management tools 
like Basecamp but I always go 
back to good old email.  
The simplicity and flexibility 
of it is hard to beat!
Looking across the web, 
whose work is impressing 
you most at the moment?
HT: On the agency side I  
think Hello Monday is at the 
top of its game. B-Reel, Fi, 
Odopod (now Nurun) usually 
produce great work as well.  
I always enjoy the work of 
people like Claudio Guglieri, 
Anthony Goodwin and Brijan 
Powell, and I’ve actually been 
fortunate enough to work 
with all of them on different 
projects.
The killer question: 
What’s the secret to  
growing the best beard?
HT: Don’t shave. O

Having spent her childhood 
visiting galleries with her 
grandfather and being taught 
the subtleties of good 
craftsmanship by her father, 
it seems that Meagan Fisher 
(for the record, it’s M-ee-gan, 
but she won’t correct you if 
you get it wrong) was always 
destined for a high-flying 
creative career. Her journey 
has seen her flitting between 
studio jobs and freelance 
work, switching between 
cities and keeping night-owl 
hours. We caught up with her 
ahead of her talk at Generate 
London on 26 September, to 
find out about her decade in 
design so far ... 
Hello! Why don’t you 
introduce yourself and  
your work? 
MF: Hi! I’m Meagan Fisher, a 
freelance web designer 
working in Brooklyn, New 
York. I’ve been designing 
since 2004 – a whole 10 years! 
I’ve done work for a wide 
range of companies – 
nonprofits, agencies, big 
brands, you name it. Lately 
I’ve been doing a lot of 
marketing work for startups, 
and some frontend work 
creating responsive and 
Sass-based sites.
You have a thing for owls…
MF: I do, it’s true. The owl 
obsession developed slowly 
from several directions. I used 
to do most of my design work 
from 10pm to about 6am, 
because that’s really my most 
productive period of the day. 
So I identify with nocturnal 
creatures on that level. Also, 
when I left for college my 
father told me an owl had 
moved into the big tree in 
their backyard, and it 
reminded him of me because 
it kept him up half the night 
and made a lot of noise. It 
seemed like a sign that the 
owl was meant to be my 
symbol. Plus, I aspire to be 
more wise, and owls are a 
great reminder of that.
How and when did you first 
become interested in design?
MF: When I learned how to 
write, probably. One of the 
earliest memories I have of 
‘designing’ is sitting in church 
services and sketching on the 
backs of the programmes, 
trying to mimic the different 
font styles I could see in the 
chapel. Also, when I was 
young my grandfather –  
who was a New York City 
advertising designer in the 
60s and 70s – would take me 
to art museums around the 
city. My father, who collected 
antiques, taught me to note 
the lettering, patina, finish 
and craftsmanship that went 
into making his treasures. 
These things shaped my 
appreciation of the details 
that make something 
beautiful, so I think I was 
trained to look for the design 
in everything from an  
early age.
And the web – when did you 
start thinking that tech 
might be your medium?
MF: I never thought I could 
make a living from my love  
of design. I’d considered 
studying graphic design in 
college, but I thought it’d 
mean a career creating 
billboards and magazine  
ads, which I wasn’t much 
interested in. So I majored in 
English Literature instead,  
but I also started doing Flash 
tutorials for fun (when I was 
meant to be doing 
homework). A few friends

New Look  
Fisher completed 
a total redesign of 
Piquora’s site, 
including 
responsive, 
Sass-based 
markup
asked me to make Flash 
websites for them, and 
I realised I enjoyed making 
websites more than studying, 
so I dropped out of school and 
found a job. During my 
internship at a software 
development company, I was 
introduced to web standards 
and Photoshop (thank God!), 
so I moved away from Flash.
Do you code? 
MF: I ‘code’ in that I work in 
HTML, CSS and sometimes 
Sass or Less to create in-
browser prototypes of my 
designs. Sometimes these 
markup-based design 
prototypes end up being the 
finished product that gets 
launched, other times a ‘real’ 
developer will use them as 
a jumping-off point. 
I think I’m a better designer 
because I know how to do 
most of the frontend 
development for my work. I 
understand the medium I’m 
designing for (browsers), and I 
don’t have to rely on other 
people to see my ideas come 
to life. When I’m making a 
site that’s responsive, I don’t 
have to create 12 different 
PSDs per page to show how a 
design should adapt to 
different screens. I can simply 
make the design responsive in 
the browser, and test my ideas 
live on different devices. I’ll 
always consult and defer to a 
specialist when it comes to 
development work, I just 
think it helps that I can speak 
their language.
How do you think your style 
changed over the years?
MF: I think ‘style’ is a largely 
superfluous thing, at least in 
the way the term gets used 
today (as in “We want the site 
to have a flat/textured/
big-photo-based style”).  
I focus on having a more 
intimate understanding of the 
timeless principles of good 
design, and be thoughtful 
about how they can be applied 
to each new project. 
But maybe that’s a bit of a 
cop-out answer. I’d say I 
certainly have a better 
developed sense of white 
space than I used to. Initially 
my work had small fonts and  
I filled every available pixel, 
now I take away more ‘stuff’ 
and give the meatiest content 
plenty of breathing room. 
There are also aspects of  
my ‘style’ that have remained 
consistent for much of my 
career: I’ll always love a bit of 
detailed ornamentation to 
draw the eye to key elements. 
I’ve always focused on 
typography first, and let  
that guide the design. I lean 
towards muted, earthy tones 
or deep, bold blues in general, 
because that’s a palette I’ve 
developed a feel for, and can 
easily do colour magic with.
And do you feel your 
approach to your career  
has changed?
MF: Starting out, work was 
perhaps the most important 
thing in my life. For the first 
six years or so I was happy to 
sacrifice my personal health 
and sanity for design, because 
proving I could ‘make it’ as a 
designer made up much of my 
self-worth. Naturally this led 
to burnout, especially once I 
moved to New York and was 
so overwhelmed by the city’s 
possibilities. 
The two years I spent at 
Chartbeat provided a 
wonderful space for me to 
focus on one product and 
continue to learn about 
design, but also to develop 
other interests (including a 
perhaps unfortunate 
proclivity for wine and 
karaoke). Now I’m in a place 
where I’m craving the 
challenges of freelance work 
again, but hopefully this time 
around it’ll be with a more 
mature eye towards living a 
balanced life.
What’s your workflow? Do 
you start with ink on paper 
and arrive at pixels or is it 
digital all the way?
MF: My process is a fluid, 
project-by-project thing. I 
usually start by creating an

WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON THE WALLS?
Oh man, so much weird stuff. I collect

WHAT WILL YOU DO FOR LUNCH?
Whatever leftovers are hanging around the

WHAT HOURS DO YOU WORK?
I don’t have a strict schedule, but usually 
it’s about 1pm to 8pm. Since a lot of my 
clients have been on the West Coast, this 
works out nicely for them.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO?
The office is my house, and even though I 
have an ‘office’ space, I work in every room. 
I get the most done in the kitchen and in 
bed, because these rooms have the best 
light and the comfiest seating.

Designer
HTML and CSS wireframe with 
as much real content as is 
available. The goal in this 
phase is to see the content 
laid out in the browser, and to 
get a feel of the structure. 
Once we’re comfortable with 
the hierarchy and flow, I use 
Photoshop to create rough 
mockups and style tiles. I see 
Photoshop as a sketching tool, 
and I test things out for real in 
the markup. Some clients 
struggle with wanting to see 
pixel-perfect mockups, but 
most are excited to see their 
site coming to life directly in 
the browser. 
Do you feel design is being 
reduced to science by 
analytics, data and research? 
Is there any room left for  
gut feeling?
MF: I mostly look at analytics 
and data before beginning a 
project to get an idea of where 
most of a site’s current users 
live: on their phones, their 
tablets, in Internet Explorer, 
and so on. It helps me think 
about creating the best 
experience possible for users 
across the spectrum of the 
web, and I think that’s a key 
component of design. I also 
use analytics tools after a 
design change, to see how it’s 
resonating with people. I view 
data and analytics as a tool for 
getting a sense of who the 
users are, and then as a way to 
evaluate my ideas. I can’t see 
anything reductive about that.

Returns to original dream of running 
a design studio
How Meagan Fisher got to where she is today
As far as ‘research’ ... I do 
think spending too much time 
researching can get in the way 
of rapidly iterating on 
a design. That said, once we 
are mindful of the landscape 
of our designs – who the users 
are, what their interaction 
with our sites are like, and 
what they need – then we can 
let the “gut feel” have its fun, 
within those constraints.
You’re a designer. How easily 
does the business side of 
things come to you?
MF: The business part is the 
hardest part, by far. Finding 
clients who are a good fit, 
managing proposals and 
contracts, figuring out how to 
keep consistent pay coming in 
– these things are huge 
challenges for me. I often 
wish I could hire someone to 
manage the business side of 
things for me. Maybe one day 
I will. For now it’s still a skill 
I’d like to develop, so I read a 
lot about running a business 
and try to think through the 
lessons I can take from every 
mistake or success.
What’s the biggest mistake 
you’ve made as a 
businessperson? And what’s 
been your biggest success?
MF: The biggest mistakes are 
not clearly defining the 
parameters of a project, and 
not insisting on regular 
payment for my work 
throughout the project. It’s 
taken some time to build up 
the confidence to say: “Here’s 
exactly what I will and won’t 
do, and here’s how often I 
have to be paid for it”. 
The biggest success I’ve had 
is probably just that I’m still 
running my own studio, even 
though I’ve thought about 
going back to being a full-
time employee at least  
once a week. 
Surely kittens are cuter than 
owlets ... 
MF: That’s maybe the hardest 
question so far! Owlets are 
adorable, but since my 
primary work companion is 
my cat Theo, I might have  
to say kittens win out.  
Otherwise Theo will probably 
throw up on my pillow. O

BEARDED.COM
If there’s one thing Bearded is 
really lacking in, it’s beards. 
Only one of its members can 
be truly described as hirsute. 
Luckily, what it lacks in facial 
hair, it makes up for in design 
excellence. Founded in 2008 
by Matt Griffin (the proud 
owner of the aforementioned 
single beard), the web 
design agency has been  
honed into a crack team of 
five talented individuals,  
each specialising in a 
particular field. 
Working alongside Griffin 
are designer Matt Braun, 
content strategist Caralyn 
Green and developers Brett 
Bender and Patrick Fulton. We 
caught up with some of the 
team to find out the thinking 
behind their mission to move 
the web forward, and the real 
– slightly geeky – story 
behind that agency name...
Why don’t you start off by 
describing Bearded, its 
personality and values… 
MG: We started Bearded in 
2008 as just a designer and a 
developer. From the 
beginning our central idea was 
that of collaboration. We’ve 
always been single-team sized 
– right now those five people 
represent research, UX, 
content strategy, design and 
full-stack web development. 
No one person can be 
hero-level at all of the things 
that go into making great web 
experiences, so collaboration 
between people who each 
specialise in one part of the 
system is the key. Since we 
started, I gave up the idea of 
‘my work’. But ‘our work’ is 
so much better than anything 
I’ve done on my own. 
The other big thing we 
wanted was to do work that 
we could feel good about at 
the end of the day. Which  
is why you see so many 
nonprofits on our roster.  
It’s not really where the big 
bucks are – but my feeling is 
that no one can pay you 
enough to dislike what you’re 
doing with your time. 
Time is really all that any of 
us have, so you better make 
sure you’re having 
experiences you feel good 
about during that time. For 
me that means doing quality 
work, learning and growing as 
craftspeople, enjoying the 
interactions with each other 
and our clients, and making 
the world a little better if we 
can while we’re at it. 
Wow. That got kind of  
heavy, huh?
Where did that unusual name 
come from?

Start your own business  |  167 
MG: Well, I’ve had a beard for 
most of my years since high 
school, so it seemed like a safe 
bet. But there’s a more arcane 
explanation that involves 
type. Fair warning: aside from 
being a citizen of the internet, 
I’m also a letterpress printer. 
Ready? Here we go. We’re all 
familiar with the term 
‘typeface’ right? Well, all 
physical type has an anatomy. 
The face is the surface that 
gets inked, the ledge the 
letterform emerges from is 
the shoulder, and the slope 
between the face and  
shoulder is the beard. It isn’t 
particularly noticeable, and it 
isn’t the part that prints. But 
without it there, supporting 
the face, you couldn’t print 
anything. So that’s my long 
and rarified metaphor for 
Bearded. It doesn’t make 
a very good elevator pitch.
How did the agency start?
MG: Two guys in our homes 
making sites and a logo for 
next to nothing. Not long into 
it we got a leaky office and a 
third dev. It was humble 
beginnings for sure. We really 
had no idea what we were 
doing with pretty much 
anything, which was kind of 
an asset. If we’d known how 
ignorant we were about 
running a business I may have 
never recovered from the 
resulting panic attack. 
What’s the web design scene 
in Pittsburgh like?
PF: Awesome! The community 
here is close-knit, vibrant and 
excited about the web.

Date Night

Museum of 
Pittsburgh 
website, featuring 
a responsive 
calendar
There are so many web and 
tech-related meetups here 
that one could attend a 
different event on nearly any 
weeknight. Pittsburgh itself is 
great, too. Many people think 
of it as an American football-
crazed, dirty, smoky steel 
town – but that’s not really 
the case any more. We still 
love our sports teams, but the 
city and surrounding region 
are beautiful.
You say: “We do more than 
incorporate future-friendly 
technologies – we help move 
the web forward.” Can you 
give us some examples?
MG: Everything we come up 
with that seems remotely 
useful we write about, speak 
about or put on GitHub for 
people to use. Which to me is 
just what one should do on 
the web. We’ve all received so 
much great free knowledge 
from everyone before us, as 
well as our contemporaries 
– anything we can do to give 
back will only be a drop in the 
bucket, compared to what 
we’ve already received. We’re 
just trying to balance the 
scales a little.
What’s the key to a good 
agency-client relationship?
MG: Honesty. That’s the big 
one. If something’s bugging 
you, don’t bottle it up and 
make assumptions about the 
client’s intent. Tell them 
about it. They’re on your 
team, after all! They want the 
same thing you do – a 
startlingly successful project.
A smart friend of mine, 
Norm Goldberg, who works at 
another Pittsburgh agency, 
said a client once told him 
there were only two things 
they wanted from him: “Don’t 
surprise me, and don’t make 
me cry.” Even good surprises 
aren’t a good thing, because 
they mean the client’s out of 
the loop.
That’s pretty good advice. 
Bring them into the team so 
they’ll never be surprised. 
Because they’re embedded in 
the process. There will likely 
be less crying that way. Hey, 
this is pretty good marriage 
advice, too. Do you guys have 
a magazine for that?
How do you run your initial 
meetings with a client?
MG: That’s a whole article 
right there! Not long ago we 
brought Seven Heads Design’s 
Kevin M Hoffman in on a 
project, and he really

Founder, Bearded
workshopped us on kick-offs. 
It’s totally changed the way 
we work. Before our first 
meeting we do a series of 
stakeholder and user 
interviews to get the lay of the 
land. Then we design a custom 
one- or two-day workshop to 
explore those themes through 
various collaborative 
activities. It’s probably 
currently the most fun and 
exhausting part of my job.
How do you ensure you and 
your client are on the same 
page before you start?
MB: Over the last year we’ve 
really refined our research and 
discovery phase. It’s 
important to know what 
problems you’re trying to 
solve before you start trying to 
solve them. So before we get 
into design we ask a lot of 
questions. This includes the 
interviews and the kick-off 
workshop, and a lot of IA, UX 
and content strategy work 
where we get to know the 
client, and why we’re making 
what we’re making. 
We explore who the client 
is, who it’s not, and who it 
wants to be. We also attempt 
to define who the users are, 
what their stories are, and 
how they’ll find a use for what 
we’re making. With this we 
can define the overall 
direction, and potential 
hurdles become more evident. 
Do clients sometimes find it 
hard to understand your 
creative direction?
MB: For the most part, no. We 
never have a ‘big reveal’ on 
our projects. Clients are able 
to view their site’s wireframes 
and mockups in a browser, so 
they’re exposed to ‘real’ stuff 
very early in the process. Our 
clients are our partners, and 
we’ve found it works best to 
keep the process transparent 
and let them in on things 
early. If we have an off-the-
wall idea, we might do a quick 
mockup or sketch and just 
show it to them early. But 
more often than not, it’s an 
idea that might have already 
been discovered together in 
our kick-off meetings or 
presented in the research 
phase, so they’re expecting it.
Are all your sites built from 
scratch or do you have a 
WHAT’S ON YOUR DESK?

Display, an external keyboard, and a

and mouse with wrist rests (totally

Time, A Happy Meal toy of Speed Racer’s

WHAT’S ON YOUR WALLS?
A lot of letterpress prints by friends, a bike 
map of Pittsburgh done by our friends at 
Deeplocal, Kevin Cornell’s original 
illustration from one of my first A List Apart 
articles, and a Jacques Cousteau CED.
WHAT HOURS DO YOU WORK?
Burnout can be a real problem – especially 
when you love what you do – so we keep to 
normal business hours. We almost never do 
nights and weekends, because that will cut 
into the next week’s productivity.
WHAT ELSE HAPPENS?
We have a decent video game 
setup. We haven’t had time to play in 
a while, though. Or maybe it’s just because 
Matt Braun destroys everyone at Goldeneye 
every time.
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HANG OUT?
We hang out all day during the week! We 
mostly spend time with friends, spouses 
and kids on the weekends. We have a great 
time at the office when we’re here, though.

Bearded’s story: from launch to the present day
menu of elements and 
components that you  
draw together?
PF: We begin building our 
sites with the help of Stubble, 
our starter kit. Stubble is a 
simple collection of our most 
commonly used patterns – 
it’s Bearded’s boilerplate. 
Stubble helps us quickly put 
together our wireframes, 
and make a consistent and 
clear start on our mockups.
Tell us about What Comes 
Next is the Future...
MG: Well, we’re making a 
movie. It’s a documentary 
about the people who build 
the web, which gives me an 
excuse to nerd out with people 
whose work and ideas I very 
much admire. The main 
things I’ve done so far are 
upgrade my gear and schedule 
more interviews. 
One of the biggest 
realisations we’ve had is that 
to make a watchable film, 
we need more than just a 
bunch of expert interviews. 
We need characters, story – 
a real narrative arc.
So twe’re taking a first stab 
at that with Ethan Marcotte in 
Boston. There will be more 
than just a person in a chair 
talking about the web. I mean, 
now we’ll have multiple 
people walking around and 
talking about the web! Totally 
different right?
So what’s on the horizon  
for Bearded?
MG: Well, by the time this 
prints we’ll have launched our 
new two-page website.  
We had been building a 
massive new Bearded site for 
more than a year, and recently 
decided to scrap it. In two 
weeks we totally redesigned 
everything as a simple site 
that’s the absolute MVP for 
us. It says who we are, what 
we’re good at, and how to get 
a hold of us. 
Bearded has changed a 
whole bunch in the past year, 
and the big site we’d been 
slowly chipping away at 
between projects just didn’t 
represent us any more. It’s 
always a tough thing to do, 
letting go of things you really 
like and have been working on 
for a long time. But it was also 
a huge relief because we knew 
it wasn’t right any more. 
It reminds me of a 
Hemingway quote that came 
to me via Hillman Curtis’ book 
MTIV: “take out the good 
parts, and see if it still 
works.” If you like something 
too much to throw it away 
when it’s outlived its use, 
that’s a problem.
Especially with the web 
which is so mercurial, you’ve 
got to be ready to toss it all out 
and start over, should the 
need arise. Hey, that’s pretty 
good. I should write that on 
my bedroom mirror or 
something. O

Drew
Wilson
Designer, developer, proud 
stay-at-home dad, 
entrepreneur, brewery owner, 
healthy living advocate: Drew 
Wilson’s job titles are long 
and varied. But his work ethos 
is simple – create things you 
would use, and design them 
how you’d like them to be 
designed. The approach 
has worked well for him so far 
– after kick-starting his 
entrepreneurial career by 
being the first to the icon 
party with Pictos, Wilson is 
now busy living up to his early 
success with payment service 
Plasso. How does he do it?
So, introduce yourself and 
tell us what you do? 
DW: Hey! Thanks for having 
me. I’m Drew Wilson and I’m 
The California-based entrepreneur on building tools to 
solve your problems and investing in your wellbeing
DREWWILSON.COM
a dad, designer and developer 
who makes various things.  
I have a handful of apps I’ve 
built for the web, Mac and iOS, 
as well as a brewery, winery 
and a restaurant. I consider 
myself an entrepreneur, as  
I make a living from my 
ventures.
When did you first discover 
design?
DW: I started designing out of 
my passion for art when I was 
a kid. My dad used Photoshop 
(version two) to lay out his 
comic book catalogue – he 
created the first ever mail-
order comic catalogue. 
I started playing with 
Photoshop from a young age, 
and started designing with it 
when I was around 14. I built 
my first website in 1996, and 
the rest is history.
What about technology and 
the web – when did they first 
make an appearance?
DW: I grew up on Macs and we 
never had a PC in the house, 
so my computer experience is 
very different to most at my 
age. I was home-schooled, so 
educational games on the 
Mac were a part of my 
curriculum. I got on AOL in 
around 92, when you had to 
pay per hour! The internet to 
me then was just chat rooms 
and email – a very different 
world compared to today.
Ever since then I’ve been 
interested in technology and 
making things interactive, but 
it wasn’t until 2003 that I bit 

Start your own business  |  173 
the bullet and learned 
backend code. Before then I 
just did HTML/CSS and Flash. 
I never wanted to code – it 
seemed so nerdy and boring!
What does your typical day 
look like?
DW: My wife and I switch who 
gets up with the kids each 
day. I hang out with the 
kiddos (I have three) until 
around 9:30am, when I start 
work. I work from home and 
my door is usually closed, but 
the kids come in a few times a 
day to say hi, and I see them 
for lunch as well. I’m off work 
at 5pm. Once we’re done 
getting the kids down to bed 
(it takes a long time!), I’ll 
either hang with the wife and 
watch a movie, or if we both 
have lots to do I’ll hop back on 
the computer for a night shift.
Also, I don’t take full 
weekends off – instead I take 
off one day during the 
weekend (usually Sunday) and 
then one in the week. It’s 
fantastic because a day off 
during the week means we can 
do anything with our kids, and

Photo-ready  
The soon-to-be-
released Filtron 
enables users to 
create, use and 
share photo filters 
Wilson describes it 
as “super-radical”
never worry about crowds. 
I’ve been doing it for years 
now and I’ll never go back to 
two-day weekends.
How do you juggle 
fatherhood and work?
DW: It’s true, I am a stay-at-
home dad and my wife is a 
stay-at-home mom. We love 
it, and so do our kids. Some 
people have told me it “must 
be hard”, but that’s only if 
you consider ‘work’ the 
primary focus. I used to be of 
that same train of thought. I 
had to train myself that my 
kids are the primary focus, 
and work is secondary. Armed 
with that mindset, it becomes 
very easy and enjoyable to 
work from home. 
I’m fortunate to have the 
opportunity to be around my 
kids 24/7, so I want to take full 
advantage of it. I also don’t 
get stressed out easily, which 
is a convenient trait if you 
work from home and have 
three little kids!
Lumo, Plasso, Pictos, Valio 
Con: you make lots of stuff! 
From where do your ideas 
and motivation come?
DW: Almost everything I’ve 
built has started as a desire to 
solve a problem for myself. I 
built all the apps you 
mentioned because I needed 
something like them, and the 
existing options weren’t a 
good fit for me, or didn’t exist. 
It’s easy to be motivated when 
building for yourself, which is 
one of the main reasons I can 
build so much. 
 
Do your products share DNA? 
DW: They’re all a part of me. 
They are the way I would do 
things. Valio Con (valiocon.
com), for example, is an 
extension of myself. If you 
come to the conference you’ll 
be treated to a vacation and 
conference in the style I would 
most prefer. It’s very laid-
back and fun – no ‘VIPs’, no 
stage, custom-brewed beer, 
local food, situated on the 
beach. So I guess my products 
all share my DNA.
Do you have a template or  
is every product started  
from scratch?
DW: I don’t try to build 
products or apps around a set 
of rules. I’m not an organised 
person so that idea never even 
enters my brain. I just figure 
out the way I would want to do 
things and then base the core 
feature set on that. When it 
comes to the actual code 
implementation, I do have a 
mini framework (really just a 
set of classes and functions) 
that I copy and paste. With 
each project it gets better and 
more robust, and cuts down 
on dev time. I don’t have that 
for HTML/CSS though.
When inspiration strikes, 
how do you harness it? 
DW: I have a book on that: 
Execute (executebook.com)! 
I build immediately when 
inspiration strikes – at least 
the design, so I can flesh out 
my ideas. Over time I’ve 
gotten less free time, so I’m a 
bit more picky about what I 
spend my time on now. I let 
things sit in my head for a few 
days to a week before acting 
on them, to see if they really 
stick with me. 
This also gives me an 
opportunity to outline (in my 
head) how long it will take to 
build, and how much return I 
would see. And I can judge if it 
would be worth my time to 
prototype something, rather 
than adding to existing 
products. It’s a balancing act. 
These days I’m trying to focus 
more on only a few things, 
and get away from building 
new stuff all the time, but  
it’s hard.
Do you make all of your 
projects in their entirety, or 
do you work with others? 
DW: I usually try to partner up 
with a developer. Tackling a 
product all on your own is 
only good if you’re doing one 
thing. If you’re doing multiple 
things it becomes too much

work for a single person with 
only 24 hours in a day. Plus, 
partnering gives you the 
benefit of having someone 
else’s talents and ideas 
contributing to the product. 
It’s much better to do 50:50 
than any other arrangement 
(and I’ve tried ’em all). I do 
have a few products that are 
100 per cent me, including 
Plasso and Pictos.
Which product makes you 
feel most proud and why?
DW: Plasso (plasso.co). 
Because its success is a result 
of skill and not luck. Pictos  
(pictos.cc) was a stroke of 
luck. I was one of the first to 
sell icons, so I made tons of 
money – but only because I 
was one of the first. If I were 
to launch an icon set today, 
it would make nowhere near 
what I made with Pictos. I was 
lucky enough to be early.
Plasso is different. There are 
a number of other services in 
the same space, yet it is doing 
well (well enough that it is 
where I draw my salary). I 
launched a similar app back in 
2010 called Quixly, but it 
failed to make money. Then I 
launched Space Box, and it 
failed to make money. So I 
changed the business model 
and branding and re-launched 
Space Box as Plasso, and it’s

WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON  
THE WALLS? 
Nothing right now since I just moved, but 
typically a few pieces of art.
WHAT HOURS DO YOU WORK?
Typically I start at 9am and go until 5pm, 
with a break or two for lunch and to see the 
kiddos. Depending on how busy I am, I’ll go 
back to work after putting the kids to bed 
for another four hours or so.
WHAT ELSE DO YOU DO IN  
THE OFFICE?
My wife and I watch movies on the TV, but 
it’s mostly a work space.
HOW OFTEN DO YOU HANG OUT WITH 
OTHER DESIGNERS?
I love hanging out with fellow tech people, 
but I’m a dad of three little kids, so I barely 
get out of the house at all!

MAY 2014
Launches Plasso: payments made 
easy. This now finances Wilson  
and his career
How Drew Wilson went from designer to entrepreneur
doing really well. This shows 
me it isn’t luck, but my 
experience that has made it 
successful. That’s why I’m 
most proud of it.
Do you do client work?
DW: I used to. I stopped in 
2008 to work full-time on my 
first software product I was 
going to sell. But it didn’t 
work out and I had to take on 
some client work in 2009. 
I also had to sell off furniture 
and all my camera gear – it 
was a very tough time. When I 
launched Pictos, that brought 
in enough money to finance 
me, and now Plasso is doing 
well enough that I don’t need 
to do client work. That said, 
building your own products 
isn’t all rainbows and 
chocolate baths – it’s hard. 
You will be poor. But if you’re 
smart and continue to push 
through, it will be worth it.
What’s your take on the 
web’s caffeinated attitude to 
work and health? 
DW: I hear ya. I personally 
don’t drink coffee, but I do eat 
chocolate! We all work in an 
industry that kills human 
bodies. The analogy I like to 
use is this: a construction 
worker buys and wears a hard 
hat to keep him safe on the 
job. We need to pay for and 
participate in exercise and 
healthy food to keep us safe 
on the job. 
Looking at it that way, it’s 
much easier to spend money 
on these things, because it is 
worth it. I’ve had a personal 
trainer for over three years.  
It forces me to leave my desk 
because I have to be on time 
to meet up and to work out. 
I’m also fortunate that my 
wife is into healthy eating and 
is an amazing cook. So unless 
I go buy pizza or a burger,  
I eat about as healthily as a 
human can.
Do you manage to build  
time into your day to keep 
yourself healthy?
DW: Most definitely. I work 
out with my buddy and trainer 
Rhett Andersen three days a 
week. But the kids keep me 
active on my days off too! O
Early icons Pictos was one of the first icon sets for sale online, and was successful enough 
for Wilson to give up client work altogether. He describes it as “a stroke of luck”
