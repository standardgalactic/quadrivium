Part of Ariolasoft's new range
The sky's the limit
ARIOLASOF'S RECENT SUCCESS, SKY-
fox, has now been released on cassette
priced at £9.95. The game was originally
only available on disk and the cassette
version eventually released was the third
attempt at maintaining the standard of
Skyfox since two earlier conversions were
rejected by the manufacturers as being
not up to scratch.
Skyfox is only one of a number of new
releases from Ariolasoft. The latest titles
are Racing Destruction Set, Pinball Con-
struction Set, Adventure Construction
Set, Music Construction Set, Seven Cities
of Gold and Mail Order Monsters. So far
these titles are only available on disk and
are all priced at 04.95.
Ariolasoft can be contacted at Suite
105/105 Asphalte House, Palace St.
London SW1E 5HS.
Chatting up
COMPUNET IS DEVELOPING A NEW SER-
vice scheduled for a late autumn launch.
It is a scrolling. CB style chat facility. The
chat lin e  w ill allow  users t o  h o ld
conversations in real time with other users
all over the country.
Contributions are typed into a window
at the bottom of the screen while a second
window above displays messages from
other users. By scrolling back and forth
the whole conversation can be reviewed.
Users with similar interests can form
groups by  using individual chat lines
which will be provided and those wanting
a chat can monitor various conversations
before deciding which one to join.

The in-store terminal
Errata
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE SEEM TO BE
having problems entering the Sketch
Pad program which appeared in  the
September issue of Your Commodore.
There are no errors in  the program
but some of the codes that our printer
interface uses seem to be causing the
problems.
In line 1450 the [2551 is actually the
character code for pi ( ) .  This character is
to be found on the key next to the
RESTORE key. Wh en  entering t h e
program you should type in the pi and not
[2551.
Another line that is causing problems
is 620. It appears that in some issues of the
magazine this has not reproduced very
well. Line 620 should start with IF XC =
256 THEN
A number of people also seem to be
having problems ﬁnding the I character
on their keyboard this is the up arrow I to
be found on the key next to the RESTORE
key. The printer that we use does not print
the downstroke of the arrow.

have been told on many occasions that it
is possible to make all of the keys on the
C64 keyboard repeat, as on the Spectrum.
This seems to be a very handy facility as
you could enter long strings of the same
character without having to press the key
for each letter.
However, I  d o  hav e o n e  s light
problem, nowhere can I ﬁnd mention of
how to do this. Would it be possible to
provide me with the necessary commands
or program t o  make the C64's keys
repeat?
Mike Atkinson

Yes, it is possible to make all of the keys on
the C64 repeat and it is very easy to do. All
you have to do is POKE into a few memory
locations. The locations are as follows

I suggest that you take it back to the dealer

In am writing a program in machine code
that requires a lot o f  data storage. I
understand that there is  BK o f  RAM
'underneath the Basic Kemal. This would
be an ideal place to store my data and
machine code routines.
Could you please explain how I access
this area of memory as when I try I only get
the Basic ROM and not the numbers
have stored beneath it?
As you have already found out you can't
use the area of memory beneath the Basic
Kernal when Basic is running as any peeks
or calls to that area will just go to the
kernal. If however you are using machine
code you can turn off the Basic kernal and
use the memory that sits beneath it quite
easily.
First you must switch off the Basic
ROM. To do this you unset the lower bit
of memory location one. This can be done
simply by subtracting one from it. If this
action was to take place in Basic your
program would crash. However, i n
machine code i t  will not affect the
program.
If your machine code routine was to
start at — or your data was stored at —
location 40960 ($A000), then this small
routine would allow you to access it.

Stuart Cooke has
spent hours slaving
over a red hot
[Commodore 128 and 1
[he's decided that it I
L
I the effort.
COMMODORE ARE ALL SET
to prove that three into one
does go with their new Com-
modore 128 computer.
The C128 is essentially three
computers in one. Inside a case
that looks as though it would
be quite at home on the ﬂight
deck of some futuristic space-
ship there is a good old C64.
Secondly we have what can
only b e  described a s  a n
upgrade of the CM, 128 mode,
Hardware-wise this is the same
as the C64 with only a few
changes. Thirdly there is  a
machine that has also been
around for quite a long time,
but n o t  fr om Commodore.
This is  a  C P/ M computer.
CP/M has been around for a
number o f  years and is  the
name given t o  an operating
system that is used on some Z80
based business systems to allow
a great deal of  compatibility
between manufac tur er s .
Perhaps o n e  o f  t h e  mos t
famous business packages that
runs under CP/M is the word-
processing package Wordstar
which is in use in thousands of
ofﬁces around the world.
First Impressions
The ﬁrst thing that you notice
about the C128 is that you are
not getting some fantastic new
machine for your money. What
you do get are two very well
established machines and one
very good up grade.
The machine itself has been
designed to achieve as much
compatibility as possible with
the CM and other Commodore
products. For this reason many
of the expansion connectors
will be familiar to owners of
other Commodore machines.
There are connectors on the
machine f o r  t w o  joysticks,
Commodore's own serial peri-
pheral connector, TV interface,
•
In Use
-
composite video video interface, a
standard Commodore cassette
interface, a  user port and a
cartridge por t. N e w  items
obvious on the sides of the
machine are a reset switch and
a RGB monitor interface.
Even though Commodore
has tried to make the C128 as
compatible as possible with the
CM, the cassette interface is in
a silly position. If you plug a
Commodore modem into the
cartridge port the casing of the
modem obscures the cassette
interface preventing a cassette
recorder from being plugged
in,
The keyboard bears only a
slight resemblance t o earlier
Commodore machines as there
are more keys available. Added
keys include a numeric keypad
and a large number of function
keys.
When powering up you are
able t o decide whether you
wish to boot up the C128 in 40
or 80 columns, CP/M, 128 or 64
modes. Here we come across
the ﬁrst problem with the C128.
The 80 column display can only
be viewed on a monitor that is
plugged into the RGB interface
while the 40 column display
can only be viewed on a TV or
monitor plugged i n t o  t h e
composite video socket. If you
wish to use both 40 and 80
columns then you will need
two different monitors. Com-
modore has produced a new
monitor that will allow you to
switch between the two modes
of operation. A monochrome
composite signal is present on
the RGB socket so you can plug
a monochrome monitor t o
view 80 columns if you already
own one. Using a monochrome
monitor w ill not cause any
problems especially when you
realise that t h e  80 column
mode is  tex t only  and n o
graphics are available.
CM mode offers nothing
new, what it does do however
is allow you to use all of the
packages that ar e currently
available for the CM on your
C128 computer. This is great
news for people who already
own C64s and are thinking
about upgrading. O v er  100
pieces of software were tried
on the review machine and all
of them worked correctly. The
only problem that we found
was with programs that used
keyboard overlays as the keys
are in different positions. This is
especially noticeable with Com-
modor es  M u s i c  M a k e r
package as the keyboard will
not ﬁt the new design. Even so
it appears that all problems will
work with no faults.
An o n  board Z80 micro
processor allows you t o run
CP/M Plus version 3.0. CP/M
Plus w i l l  giv e y our  C P/ M
programs full access t o  the
128K of RAM that is built into
the machine as standard, Com-
modore has  ma d e  a  f e w
changes to CP/M Plus, mostly
by adding some new corn-
C

mands. Because of this total
CP/M c o m p a t a b i l i t y  i s
something that will have to be
proved. Unfortunately t h e
review machine did not come
with any CP/M software so this
was something that I  was
unable to test.
As I  have already men-
tioned, 1 2 8  m o d e  offer s
nothing very new apart from an
excellent Basic a n d  a n  8 0
column display. Basic 7.0 can
only be described as the Basic
that should have been imple-
mented on the C64 as it allows
total control of all the facilities
offered b y  t h e  hardware
without having t o  resort t o
POKEs or machine code.
The new disc drive is also a
great improvement on the old
1541 when used in  C128 or
CP/M mode as it will LOAD
and SAVE programs around
three to four times faster -  a
great relief to anyone who has
used a  1541. Unfortunately,
when used in C64 mode the
drive works at the same slow
speed that we all know and
hate.
Basic 7.0
Basic 7.0 contains a  large
number of commands that are
designed to ease the use of
sound and graphics together
with a large number of 'toolkit'
commands. For example the
AUTO command will automat-
ically giv e l i n e  numbers.
BLOAD and BSAVE allow you
to lo a d  a n d  save speciﬁc
sections o f  m e m o r y .  A
renumber function helps with
the development o f  lo n g
programs. Programs that d o
not work correctly are easier to
debug with the HELP command
which w ill show you where
your error has occurred or the
TRON and TROFF commands
which w ill display t he line
number of the line that is about
to be executed.
Error trapping is provided
by t h e  T R AP c ommand.
Whenever an error is detected
this command will cause the
program t o  j u m p  t o  t h e
speciﬁed program line rather
than 'bombing out'. You will
then be able to ﬁnd Out what
error has occurred and take the
appropriate ac tion. T his
command w i l l  mak e idiot-
prooﬁng your Basic programs
very easy.
Finding out what the con-
trollers are doing is also made
very easy. JOY will tell you
which direction a  speciﬁed
joystick is  pointing i n  and
whether t h e  ﬁr e button is
pressed. The position of  the
paddles and light pen is also
easy to ﬁnd Out with the POT
and PEN commands respec-
tively.
Machine code buffs will be
pleased to hear that a machine
code monitor is included. This
will allow you to display, alter
and move sections of memory.
There is even a machine code
assembler and disassembler.
The Basic keywords HEX$ and
DEC will also prove to be very
handy as they will allow you to
convert decimal numbers to
hex and vice-versa.
A number of new structure
commands have been added to
the standard FOR/NEXT loop.
These in c lu d e  D O / L O O P
which will repeat a section of
your Basic program UNTIL a
speciﬁc condition is  met or
WHILE a speciﬁc condition is
met. IF/THEN will only allow
one statement after the THEN
instruction,
BEGIN/BEND will
allow a  number
of program lines
to be included after a
THEN statement.
Graphics
Budding artists are well catered
for inside Basic 7.0 by a large
number of graphic commands.
GRAPHIC is used to turn on
one of the six different graphics
modes that are available. The
six modes are, 40 column text,
standard bit- map graphics,
standard bit-map w it h s plit
screen, multi-colour with split
screen and 80 column text. As
previously mentioned the 80
column screen can only  be
used with a monitor plugged
into the RGB socket. The split
screen modes are very int-
eresting as they allow you to
use a section of the screen in
one o f  t he graphic modes
while still retaining a speciﬁed
segment for text only. This type
of feature has been used many
times on the C64, especially in
graphic adventures, but is now
extremely easy to use on the
C128.
Drawing lines or shapes on a
graphic screen is  also very
simple. The COLOR command
allows you to set up the colours
that y o u  r equir e f o r  any
plotting etc . T h e  LOCATE
command can be used to posi-
tion the graphics cursor at any
point o n  t h e  screen, a n d

 RGR will tell you which

 position of the graphic
cursor or  the colour of  the
graphic cursor. You can even
ﬁnd o u t  t h e  w i n d o w
parameters by  means of the
RWINDOW command.
BOX makes i t  extremely
easy t o  d r a w  rectangular
shapes on the screen, all that is
necessary is to specify the top
right hand and bottom left
hand co-ordinates together
with the rotation of the box.
You can even specify if you
want the box to be ﬁlled in with
a certain colour.
CIRCLE is  used t o  draw
circles, ellipses and 'other '
shapes. This may seem to be a
weird statement but when you
see how complex the circle
command c an b e  y ou w ill
understand what I mean. The
CIRCLE command can have up
to nine parameters, these are,
the colour source, the centre of
the circle, the X radius, the Y
radius, the starting arc angle,
the ending ar c  angle, t h e
rotation in clockwise degrees
and the number of  degrees
between segments. This does
appear very complicated at ﬁrst
glance but playing around with
the parameters will soon show
you h o w  v e r s a t ile t h i s
command really is. Not all of
the parameters need to be used
every time that the command is
used. The following example is
from the manual and will draw
a diamond s hape o n  t h e
screen:
SPRITES
As with the CM there are eight
sprites available for use on the
C128. These can be either hi-
res o n e  c olour, o r  multi-
colour. H ow ev er , u n lik e
the C64, you'll never have to
perform a  single POKE t o
memory as Basic 7.0 supplies all
of the commands that you'll
ever need. You don't even
need a sprite editor as there is
one built into Basic.
SPRDEF is  the command
that turns on the C128's sprite
editor. O n  e n t e r in g  t h e
command t h e  screen clears
and a sprite grid is displayed on
the screen. Facilities available
in the editor are: turning on
and o f f  multicolour mode,
changing the colours, expan-
sion of the sprite in X and Y
directions, copying sprites and
saving sprites. In fact all of the
commands that you are likely
to need are implemented. One
fairly major omission from the
sprite editor is the ability to
move the sprite around in the
grid. You cannot, for example,
rotate a sprite or shift it left by
CIRCLE  1,260,40,20,30,„,90. o n e  pixel_ No doubt someone

Another handy command is  SSHAPE command can then

size of this rectangle can also als o lets y ou set the sprite
be set up outside a program by colour, whether it passes over
using [SC T to set the top left o r  beneath the background,
whether it is hi-res or multi-
colour and if it is expanded in
either the X or Y directions.
Moving a sprite around is
also made child's play with the
MOVSPR command. MOVSPR
can take a number of forms. It
can place a sprite at a speciﬁed
point on the screen. It can be
used to move a sprite to a new
position relative to its old one,
move a sprite a certain distance
at a  speciﬁed angle and,
perhaps its most powerful use,
it can set a sprite moving in a
speciﬁed direction at speciﬁed
speed and k eep i t  moving.
As you can probably see, the
MOVSPR command will be a
great boon t o  anyone w ho
wishes t o  w r it e  a  g a m e
program. Moving your latest
deadly creation across t h e
screen can now be done by one
command r ather  than t h e
numerous lines of code that
C64 users are used to.
Looking after your sprites is
no longer a problem as the
COLLISION c ommand w i l l
cause a jump to a speciﬁed line
number when a sprite hits the
background or another sprite.
The BUMP command can then
be used to return the values of
any sprites that have collided
since the last BUMP command.
Finding o u t  t h e  speciﬁc
details of any sprite is also made
easy w i t h  a  n u m b e r  o f
commands. RSPCOLOUR
returns t h e  c o lo u r  o f  a
speciﬁed sprite. RSPOS will
return the X, Y co-ordinates of
a sprite, very handy after a
BUMP in s t r u c t io n ,  a n d
RSPRITE will tell you whether a
sprite is on, off, expanded etc.
As you can no doubt see
from the brief mention of the
sprite manipulation commands
that ar e mentioned above,
writing any sort of program that
uses sprites is now extremely
simple. Before very long we
should s tart t o  s ee s ome
excellent g ra p h ic p ro g ra ms
written totally in Basic.
Sound
The sound chip that is used in
128 mode is exactly the same as
in t h e  C 6 4 ,  t h e  m a j o r
difference being that there are
now a  lar ge n u mb e r  o f
commands available to make
control of it easy. There are ﬁve
commands available for sound
manipulation_ SOUND is used
to place quick and easy sound
effects i n  y o u r  programs.
SOUND can have up to eight
parameters. These ar e, t h e
voice number (one to three),
the frequency of the note, the
duration of the note, whether
the sound is to be incremented
or decremented while playing,
the minimum frequency the
note can go to, how big the
step up or down is, the type of
waveform to use and the pulse
width if you are using a square
wave. As you can see, some
very interesting effects can be
made by using this command.
Another command is designed
to make the playing of music
easy, this is the PLAY statement.
PLAY allows you t o  set u p  a
string o f  synthesiser control
characters inside quotes. Char-
acters allowed are the musical
notes ABCDEFG, characters
which tell the synthesiser what
type o f  note is playing and
characters to specify the voice,
octave, envelope volume and
ﬁlter. T en predeﬁned enve-
lopes ar e available ranging
from harpsichord to xylophone
and you are able to deﬁne your
Own us ing t h e  ENVELOPE
command. TEMPO deﬁnes the
speed of the song being played
and VO L t h e  volume. T he
command FILTER will also let
you set u p  the ﬁlters para-
meters very easily.
Adding a  musical accom-
paniment and sound effects to
your programs is  now  very
easy. Even a beginner will soon
be producing sounds that are
the same quality as those that
the t o p  programmers hav e
been producing on the CM.
Verdict
Obviously I have not been able
to cover all of the details of the
C128 and its Basic, there are
many commands that I have
not covered. However, from
the few that I have mentioned I
think it should be fairly obvious
that the C128 is a powerful
machine, o r  s hould I  say
machines? The fact that it will
run all CM software, and that
thous ands  o f  b u s in e s s
packages ar e available with
CP/M, make the machine a
bargain f o r  t h e  beginner,
hobbyist and businessman
alike.
Commodore seems to have
a winner.

Language Lab

Our resident linguist, David
'Janda, gives you a breakdown
[of Pascal packages for the 1
PASCAL WAS INVENTED BY ONE MAN.
Niklaus Wir th o f  t h e  ETH Technical
Institute of Zurich in 1970. It is a compiled
language that was designed as an aid to
teaching good programming practice.
Because the language is very concise,
institutions found it easy to implement on
their systems. Software houses also dis-
covered that it was possible to implement
Pascal on many home micros, hence the
reason for its early appearance on the
micro scene.
Program Body
Unlike Basic, where you have a free hand
in program structure. Pascal requires the
programmer to 'section' his programs.
There are three main sections to a Pascal
program.
PROGRAM - header declarations
BEGIN -  Main body
END
The ﬁrst section i s  t h e  program
header. Every Pascal program must start
with the reserved word 'PROGRAM',
which is followed by the name of the
program. This can be optionally followed
by I / O  declarations, implemented in
various ways in different compilers.
The next section is the declarations.
There are a number of these. First there is
the reserved word 'CONST', used t o
deﬁne a symbolic constant:
CONST
PI=.14159;
AGE=23;
In the example. two constants have been
declared. F ollow ing t h e  c ons tant
declarations, come the more common
variable declarations:
VAR
PI R E A L ;
SUM,WEIGHT.TOTAL : INTEGER;
SWICH : BOOLEAN
INITAL : CHAR;
The four data types are integer, real, stri ng
and boolean. Pascal requires all variables
to b e  declared explicitly. F or  Basic
programmers this may come as a bit of a
shock. It's very easy in Basic to declare yet
another variable as you need it, but in
Pascal this is not the case. The good point
in declaring variables is that you need to
do some thinking and plan on how many
variables you will need in the ﬁrst place!
The next declaration is probably one
of the most powerful features of Pascal -
type deﬁnition. As you can see from
above; there are four data types in Pascal.
These are pre-deﬁned data types, and if
you wish you can declare more:
TYPE
DAY =(SUNDAY, MONDAY. TUESDAY.
WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY,
SATURDAY);
To make this a little clearer imagine the
following:
TYPE
INTEGER=(1,2,3,4 65534,65535);
In other words, deﬁning your own data
type is a convenient means of giving a
name to an ordered sequence of known
elements. To add the icing to the cake, a
SET can be declared which is a collection
of objects of the same type:
TYPE
CAPS=SET OF
Now we can have the following in a VAR
list:
.VAR
LETTER : CAPS:
The last two items in the declarations
section o f  a  Pascal pr ogr am a r e
procedures and functions. Basically, a
procedure is a sub-program (a sort of
subroutine), which contains other state-
ments and so on. Functions are a means of
declaring new operations that Pascal does
not have. _
So far, the main program body has not
been discussed. As  y ou might have
already guessed. Pascal programming
requires a lot of thought. This is a good
thing because people tend to program at
the keyboard without think ing ﬁrst.
Thinking about what data types and
variables y ou'll need w ill encourage
thought, and a good program can be the
ﬁnal result.
Pascal Syntax
The third section in a Pascal program is the
main body of the program. Here, the ﬁrst
and last reserved words are BEGIN and
END, with the ﬁnal END followed by a full
stop. I  say 'ﬁnal' because there are
normally more than one set. To under-
stand this better, here is a very simple
Pascal program:
PROGRAM Greeting;
BEGIN
WRITELN('Hello Yo u r  Commodor e
readers!)
END
Notice that there is  n o  declaration
section. The two statements in our small
example are the ﬁrst line and WRITELN.
Statements are separated by a semi-colon.
The exception to this case is the statement
preceding and END:
PROGRAM Greeting;
BEGIN
WRITEEN('Hello);
WRITELN('How are you today?')
END
In the example, the ﬁrst statement
after BEGIN ends with a  semi-colon
because the next line contains another
statement. Now look at this example:
PROGRAM Count;
VAR
I INTEGER;
BEGIN
VvRITELN Matc h this!');
FOR I:=1 TO 10 DO
WRITELN( Ying)
END
This simply prints 'Watch this' followed by
'Ying' printed 10 times. However, if I
wanted to print 'Ying' followed by 'Yang'
on the next line a nested BEGIN..END
has to be used:
PROGRAM YingYang;
VAR
I : INTEGER;
BEGIN
WRITELN('Watch this!):
FOR I: =1 TO 10 DO
BEGIN
VVRITELN('Yi ng);
WRITELN(Yang)
END;
WRITELN('That's all folks.)
END
The t w o  statements between t he
second BEGIN. END are considered as a
compound statement i.e. treated as one.
This example also demonstrates the use of
identation. This is NOT compulsary, but it
does make the program easier to read and
= = = = = = = = = = = = = =

follow through logically. The normal rule
of thumb is that when nesting occurs
(more BEGINs) you indent, and as the
END is matched on the same column
indentation occurs:
BEGIN
statements
BEGIN
statements
BEGIN
statements
END
END
END
Procedures and Functions
Tables one and two list the standard Pascal
reserved words as well as pre-deﬁned
procedures and functions. There are not
many, but they are pretty powerful. Pascal
provides the features to deﬁne your own
procedures and functions made up from
existing procedures and functions.
In essence, procedures and functions
are mini-programs. They may have their
own declarations and program blocks just
like the main program. Although similar,
there are a couple of differences between
the two. Procedures do not have to have a
parameter passed to them, although it is
possible to pass parameters to and from
procedures. Functions on the other hand,
must have a parameter and can be used in
comparisons whilst procedures cannot.
Here is an example of a program that
uses a procedure. All it does is print the
numbers one to 10, 10 times:
PROGRAM Test;
VAR
1 : INTEGER;
PROCEDURE Count;
VAR
I : INTEGER;
BEGIN
FOR I:=1 TO 10 DO
WRITE (I)
END;
BEGIN
FOR I:=1 TO 10 DO
Count
END
Notice that the procedure and the main
program use a variable with the same
name. This is OK, because variables are
local to procedures and functions. Also
note that the procedure 'Count' is called
from the main program just like any other
procedure (no line numbers like Basic!).
A function is declared in a similar
manner, although it s  operation i s
different:
PROGRAM Table;
VAR
I : INTEGER;
FUNCTION Square (N :  INTEGER)
INTEGER;
BEGIN
N:=N*N
END;
BEGIN
FOR I :=1 TO 10 DO
BEGIN
WRITE (I);
WRITELN(Square(I))
END;
END
In the example, I have used the function
'Square' directly, but as with normal
functions it is possible to pass the result to
a variable.
Control Structures
Commodore Basic is a bit limited as far as
control structures are concerned. Pascal
on the other hand,offers the programmer
some very elegant means of controlling
program ﬂow.
One control structure whic h has
already been covered in the examples is
the FOR..130 loop. which is similar to the
Basic FOR..NEXT:
FOR i:=1 TO 10 DO
WRITELN(I);
DOVVNTO is used to reverse the loop:
FOR I:=10 TO 1 DO
WRITELN(I);
To include more than one statement
within the loop boundaries, a compound
statement is used:
FOR I:=1 TO 20 DO
BEGIN
Statement;
Statement;
YI
I P
Statement
END;
One last point about a FOR..D0 !lop is
that unlike Basic, Pascal does not like the
index (the variable after the FOR) to be
altered within the loop itself.
Probably the major drawback with the
FOR..D0 type of loop is that you have to
specify an end to the loop. That is, a
FOR..D0 l o o p  m u s t  h a v e  ﬁx e d
boundaries - even if passed by variables.
Pascal offers a  couple more control
structures which are more ﬂexible.
The ﬁrst o f  these ﬂexible control
structures is REPEALUNTIL:
REPEAT
A:=A+1;
WRITELN(A)
UNTIL A=10
Notice that A  would have been
initialised before entering the REPEAT
loop. A l s o  n o t e  t h a t  c o mp o u n d
statements d o  not have t o  b e used.
Instead, statements are merely separated
by the semi-colon. Can you see why this is
the case?
You can see from the example that a
boolean tes t is  performed after t he
UNTIL. Any of the boolean operators can
be used in this test including " ,  '=' and so
on. The most important point worth
remembering about the REPEALUNTIL
loop is that the statement(s) within it will
be performed at  least once. This is
because the test is done at the end of the
loop.
The second 'ever-so-ﬂexible' control
structure is the WHILEADO loop which
takes the following form:
WHILE level desirable DO
BEGIN
level:=Ievel+1;
mix
END;
Notice that the boolean test is performed
before any statements are executed so
that i f  the boolean test is  false no
statement will be executed. A ﬁnal point
to note is that, unlike the REPEALUNTIL
loop, multiple statements must be treated
as compound statements i.e. w ith a
BEGIN..END.
The ﬁnal control structure t o  b e
considered is the CASE statement. This is
used in situations where the number of
alternatives is greater than two. It is best
understood by example;
CASE month OF
1:WRITELN('lanuary');
2:WRI TELN('February');
3:WRITELN('March');
12:WRITELN('Decemben
END;
In the example the variable 'month' has a
certain value. Depending on what that
value is, perform a different action. That is
exactly what the CASE statement does. If
'month' is equal to ﬁve, then 'May' will be
•
printed, and so on.
Oxford Pascal
Oxford Computer Systems
Disk
Not all compilers produce native machine
code, some produce what is known as P-
code. The version of Pascal from Oxford
Computer Systems does just that. The
result is  an executable program that
doesn't run very fast. However, it should
be noted that there are numerous Pascal
P-code compilers because they are easy to
implement.
Although O x for d Pascal i s  quite
expensive, you d o  get a lot for your
money. First, it follows the Pascal standard
almost to the letter. Because of this it
I

L a n g u a g e s
could be used as a serious Pascal training
tool.
A major problem with disk based
compilers is the time it takes from writing
the program to running it! Because of this,
Oxford Pascal offers two methods o f
running Pascal programs.
The ﬁrst method is to use the resident
compiler. This is the default option when
the compiler is ﬁrst loaded. In this mode it
is possible to write, amend, compile and
run a Pascal program without having to
access the disk drive. This allows learners
to get their feet wet and generally muck
about.
The second method of operation is
disk mode. Here, a program has to be
developed in the standard method. That
is, entered, saved to disk., compiled and
re-edited if any errors occur. This mode
does offer numerous advantages though.
Programs c a n  b e  m u c h  lar ger  a s
compilation i s  f r o m  dis k . O t h e r
advantages include data ﬁle handling, the
availability of the full compiler syntax,
external procedures and so on. Object
code can also be converted to run as stand
alone code.
Machine dependant features include
a form of peek and poke, colour and
sound and some graphic commands.
Most notable of these is the window
command that allows the screen to be
split between the high-resolution graphic
screen and the text screen.
Pascal 64
Orpheus Ltd
Tape
Pascal 64 and Oxford Pascal are so similar
in many ways that most of the comments
in these reviews apply to both packages.
As with Oxford Pascal, Pascal 64 offers
an almost complete deﬁnition of Pascal as
deﬁned in the User Manual and Report by
Wirth & Jensen. It is however, a cassette
version and does not produce stand alone
code (i.e. does not have a disk mode).
The Pascal source is entered in an
editor which is very similar to the standard
C64 editor.
There ar e a  few  differences and
additions. Namely, source code can be
entered with indentation, thus showing
the program structure, Additions to the
standard editor include commands such
as search a n d  replac e, a u t o  lin e
numbering, renumber, delete and so on.
The source program can be compiled
with or without a listing, which can be
directed to the printer. The object code
can then be run and/or saved to tape. But
as stand alone programs cannot b e
produced, it  is necessary to have the
compiler in memory when running any
object code.
Additions to the standard are similar to
what Oxford Pascal offers. But the general
purpose DRAW command in Pascal 64 is
much faster (see benchtests). Additional
features include sprite handling, t he
ability to read a light-pen and the joystick
ports.
Both Oxford Pascal and Pascal 64 have
common faults. First, both packages are
slow (see benchtests). In fact neither of
the two compilers is that much faster than
Basic. This is a great pity as one of the
advantages of Pascal is its speed.
Other problems include ﬂickering of
the high-resolution graphics screen. But
the biggest fault is that this screen is
divided into 250 by 200 pixels,why not the
full 320?
Pascal 64
First Software
Disk
When I ﬁrst heard about this package I
though; "Great, a true Pascal compiler."
However, after using it  I  have mixed
feelings; it's both very good and really
awful.
The package consists of a disk and 70m
page poorly written manual/user guide.
The software was written by a German
company called Data Becker and the text
of the manual and software have suffered
through translation!
The compiler is very disk intensive and
takes about three stages before a program
can b e  r un. T he tasks involved i n
developing a program with this package
are; write the source, compile the source,
link the object code and save object code
to disk. On the good side the compiler
produces compact stand-alone code, but
don't expect t o  achieve that i n  ﬁve
minutes.
The bigges t let- down w i t h  t h is
package is the ﬁrst stage of producing a
program. There is no editor and it  is
necessary to enter the source code using
the standard editor. Not only is this a
bother (there ar e n o  extra editing
commands), but it is a disaster. The reason
for this is simple. Part of the 'beauty' of
Pascal is the ability to write programs that
are indented. This makes the program
look neater, easier to read and identify.
Because Pascal 64 requires the source to
be entered using the standard '64 editor
no indentation is allowed (unless spaces
are preceding by a ';' which makes the
source look ugly!).
Another w eir d t h in g  about t h e
package is that all Pascal keywords must
be followed by a space character, This is
non standard, and the more experienced
programmer will be frustrated by this,
whilst the beginner will pick up a bad
habit. Why a space is required, is beyond
me.
Although the review so far has been
negative, things get better after the
source has been entered. Once the code
has been compiled and linked a machine
code ﬁle is produced and can be run
stand-alone.
The compiler itself is the best of the
three packages reviewed, offering more
advanced features. These include com-
prehensive ﬁle  handling, ex ternal
procedure support, high-resolution plot.
sprite command etc.
An integer command enables faster
execution i f  only  integers are being
handled. Another impressive feature is
the ability t o  r un a  procedure as an
interrupt. The constraints on this are
rather limited, but it could be useful.
Table I — Pascal Reserved Words
Here is a list of Pascal reserved words.
Note that this list is the required set of
words and that some versions may have
more - but not less.
AND, ARRAY, BEGIN, CASE, CONST,
DIV, DO, DOWNTO, ELSE, END, FILE,
FOR, FUNCTION, GOTO, IF, IN, LABEL,
MOD, NIL, NOT, OF, OR, PACKED,
PROCEDURE, PROGRAM, RECORD,

Table 2  —  Standard Functions and
Procedures
Every version of Pascal should have the
following functions and procedures (with
the possible exception o f  NEW and
DISPOSE). All implementations of Pascal
on the 64 have more pre-deﬁned pro-
cedures which deal with colour and so on.
Note that t h e  brackets indicate a n
argument.

Summary
If you intend to learn computer science
then I would strongly recommend that
you get a Pascal compiler for your 64.
Pascal has a small amount of reserved
words, yet many of the up and coming
ﬁfth generation languages incorporate
Pascal-like structures.
As far as recommending one of the
three packages I can only suggest this.
If you wish to learn Pascal, then Oxford
Pascal is by far the best. Even though
'Orpheus' Pascal '64 is very similar, the
disk operation within Oxford Pascal is a
must. However, Oxford Pascal is a bit
pricey, so Orpheus' Pascal 64 would be a
very good second.
For t h e  m o r e  e x p e r i e n c e d
programmer I  would recommend First
Publishing's Pascal 64. Even though the
user interface and daft syntax require-
ments are off-putting. I say this because
the results are quite fast, and it does have a
number of advanced features not found
in the other packages.

This month we begin 1
a new series by Steve I
'Carrie. When you've I
'collected all three
'parts you'll have a full
'machine code
development system.
THE AIM OF THIS SERIES OF
programs is  t o  provide the
reader with a set of tools to aid
in t h e  production o f  6502
machine code programs on a
C64 suitably equipped with
a1541 disk drive.
There are three separate
programs; a  Machine Lang-
uage Monitor/Editor, a Macro
Processor and an Assembler.
The Monitor is essentially the
control program from which
the other two may be called
upon to process source code
written using the Editor.
The Macro Processor is not
a full implementation since it
does not handle conditional
processing. However, it does
allow sections of source code
to be written as a "macro" with
parameters for later inclusion
in source code programs.
The Assembler is a two-pass
type w h ic h  pr oduc es  a n
executable disk ﬁle which may
be loaded int o memory by
using a simple Basic command:
LOAD "ﬁlename",8,1
The Monitor
The programs ar e dis k -
based since it was necessary to
have the random access and
reliability that a  disk drive
affords.
I w ill ﬁrst deal with the
Monitor/Editor program and
then the Macro Processor and
Assembler in turn.
The four Basic listings, when
loaded and RUN in sequence
1-4 will POKE the complete
Monitor/Editor program into
memory. Each listing contains
REM statements t o  s how
E
code begin and end. I suggest
that you type in and save all
four programs befor e y ou
attempt to generate the code.

Testing the Monitor
Enter the monitor by issuing
the direct Basic command:
SYS 33280
You s hould b e  giv en t h e
message:

followed by a" " p r o m p t  and
a ﬂashing cursor. You are now
in Monitor command mode. It
is from this that you will com-
mand most of the functions of
the Monitor/Editor and t he
other programs.
A summary of commands is
given later but for now try the
following commands.
Type DERR followed b y
return. The disk status is given
on screen in a form similar to:
DISK DR. :0, OK,0,0
where DISK DR. indicates that
this is  a  disk status report.
Machine reports are preﬁxed
by MACHINE.
Now t y p e  D I R .  T h e

Note that some commands,
such as COPY and RENAME
automatically produce a disk

or not the command has been
carried out successfully.
The formats o f  the disk
commands SCRATCH, COPY
etc. are the same as are given in
the 1541 disk users manual.
Note that in all cases, spaces,
and not quotes, are required
ar ound ﬁle n a m e s .  F o r
example, the command to save
a block of memory to disk is S.
Thus the format is:

machine will re-enter BASIC.
To get back into the Monitor,
simply ty pe t h e  SYS 33280
command again.
One thing to  note is that
the 6502 BRK vector is now set
to jump into the monitor. This
means that you may insert BRK
instructions into your machine
code programs to act as STOPs
for debugging purposes_ To see
the effect o f  this, type the
following;
POKE2,0:SYS 2
A zero byte is the code for
the 6502 BRK instruction. You
will be given the entry message
as before but this time it will be
preceded by:

Editor Commands
Description
Auto line numbering this is a
useful feature since it does away
with the need to type in line
numbers. Two formats are valid,
1 A : start 10, increment 10
2 A10,20 : start 10, increment 20
Format 2 may of course use other
numbers.
Delete lines there are two
methods of line deletion:
1 The usual Basic method, type a
line number.
2 The D command. An example
would be D20-60 which would
delete lines 20 through to 60.
Renumber lines this simply re-
numbers the lines of a source
code program. The format is the
the same as for the A command.
List program lines - the RUN/
STOP key may be used to termin-
ate the listing. If a line number is
supplied, listing will commence
from that line e.g. L200will begin
listing at line 200.
Merge ﬁle t h e  format is Wile-
name. The ﬁle named will be
merged onto the end of the ﬁle
currently in memory.
Scratch (delete) a ﬁle - this is
similar to the Basic command
NEW.
Initialise -  re-enter editor
deleting any ﬁle currently in
memory.
Exit editor - there are three for-
mats for this command.
: save ﬁle and exit.
: save ﬁle without save.
: save ﬁle with a new name and exit.
hex. A t  t h e  e n d  o f
execution, a  i M P  $8200
instruction will cause a re-entry
to the monitor.

The Editor
The Editor is provided so as to
allow preparation o f  source
code in the correct format for
the Ma c r o  Processor a n d
Assembler. T he basic idea
behind t h e  Editor  screen
format is  that source code
symbols, o p e r a n d s  a n d
mnemonics all have deﬁned
areas in a source line. These
areas are known as FIELDS and
both the Macro Processor and
Assembler expect to ﬁnd their
source code arranged in these
ﬁelds.
On a  normal C M screen,
there a r e  2 5  r ows  o f  4 0
characters. The editor arranges
the screen such that there are
four ﬁelds of 10 characters each
numbered one to four starting
at t h e  left side. Since the
normal screen edit or  w i l l
accept up to SO characters i.e.
two lines of text, the last ﬁeld-
ﬁeld four - may extend for up
to a maximum of 50 characters.
Field one is only used by the
Editor t o accept and display
line numbers. It is not actually
stored i n  t h e  ﬁnal source
program. F ield t w o  is  t h e
SYMBOL or LABEL ﬁeld, ﬁeld
three is the INSTRUCTION or
MNEMONIC ﬁeld and ﬁeld
four is the OPERAND ﬁeld.
The functions of these ﬁelds
will become clearer as we go
on t o  ex plain t h e  Mac r o
Processor and Assembler.
A ty pic al Editor  screen
layout is shown below. The top

not on screen.

If you're wondering how
you are going to keep all the
ﬁeld entries in the right places
then read on. When in edit
mode, the function key Fl is
used as  a  TAB key. When
pressed, it  will advance the
cursor from its present position
to the start of the next ﬁeld. For
example, suppose the line 1000
in t h e  above example was
being ty ped i n .  T h e  lin e
number would be typed in and
the F1 key pressed. The cursor
would be advanced to the start
of ﬁeld 2 -  the I  of LABEL1.
Pressing F l  a g a in  w o u l d
advance the cursor to the start
of ﬁeld 3 - the j of IISR and so
on.
This feature coupled with
an auto line numbering facility
makes for easy code entry.
Other facilities include line
renumbering, b lo c k  l i n e
delete, s our c e c o d e  ﬁle
merging and single line delete.
A program is  entered in  a
similar fashion t o  a  Basic
program w i t h  t h e  l i n e
numbers_ These numbers are
for editing purposes only and
do not affect the ﬁnal object
code g e n e r a t e d b y  t h e
assembler. A l l  t h e  normal
Commodore screen editing
facilities are supported by this
editor.
Entering and Leaving
the Editor
While in  Monitor command
mode, enter t h e  command
EDITOR. The message EDITOR.
ENTER FILENAME will appear.
You should enter the name of
the ﬁle you wish to use. If the
ﬁle exists on the current disk
the Editor will read it in and you
will be able to work on it. If
however the ﬁle does not exist
on the current disk, the messge

NEW FILE will be printed. In
both cases, a ﬂashing cursor
(no prompt) will signify Editor
command mode.
Before going on to explain
the Editor commands, a word
or two about leaving it. The
name entered as the ﬁlename,
is stored by the editor. At the
end of the editing session the
user may  simply enter t h e
command a n d  the ﬁle is saved
back t o  disk. A n  auto disk
validate is carried out.
This is  done t o  prevent
problems associated with the
1541" 0 : "  bug. In some cases
it may  take a long time t o
validate a disk especially if it is
getting dull. Some of you may
ﬁnd this a bit of a nuisance but I
personally pr efer  i t  t o  a
corrupted disk. If you want to
do away with this facility, refer
to listing seven which contains
details on removing it.
(see Editor Commands).
When y ou have the Macro
Processor and the Assembler
complete, I  w ill giv e some
programming examples to let
you get used to the operation
of the Editor and its formats.
Next month I will give listings
of the Macro Processor and a
description o f  Macros a n d
Macro processing.

Programmable characters
IT IS POSSIBLE TO USE CUSTOM DES-
igned character sets on the C-16, even
though Basic 3,5 does not have supporting
commands.
To understand how this is done, one
must ﬁrst examine how  t h e  normal
character set is  stored. Data for  the
character shapes is stored in the ROM
from address $D000 to address $D7FF
(53258 to 55295). Locations $D000 to $D3FF
(53248 t o  54271) h o ld  t h e  data f o r
character set 1 (upper case letters and
graphics). Locations $D400 to SKIM (54272
to 55295) hold the data for character set 2
(upper and lower case letters). Each of
the two character sets takes up 1K of
memory. Characters with screen codes
between 128 and 255 are reversed images
of codes 0 to 127 and are therefore not
stored in memory.
The characters are stored in the order
shown in the screen display codes in
Appendix E of the C-76 User Manual. For
set 1, the ﬁrst character is therefore '@'.
This is stored in eight bytes, one byte per
pixel line (eight dots) o f  the screen
display. Each byte of the character '@'
contains the eight bits needed for each
row of the character, stored in binarr
form (one for on, nought for off). The left-
most bit of the row is the '128' bit, the
second to the left is 'the '64' bit and so on
to the '1' bit on the far right.
The •@' sign is therefore stored as shown
in Figure 1.
For a character set to be created in
RAM, space must ﬁrst be made available
in whic h t o  p u t  t h e  character set_
Assuming the high-resolution screen will
not b e  us ed i n  c onjunc tion w i t h
programmable characters, the top 1K of
RAM (15360-16383) i s  t h e  m o s t
convenient. This is done by moving the
'Highest address used by Basic' pointer
(55-56) and the 'Bottom of string storage'
pointer (51-52) down 1K from the top of
RAM (see last month's article: T he
Memory map and where to store machine
code). Type:
POKE 56,59:POKE 52,59:CLR
As 'CLR' is used this should be done at the
beginning of the program.
Assuming you don't want to redeﬁne
all 128 characters of the new character set,
you need ﬁrst to move one of the ROM
character sets down into the 1K block.
This can be done easily by entering the
MONITOR and typing:
I  D000 D3FF 3C00 — for set 1, or:
D400 D7FF 3C00 — for set 2.
THE Cel 6
Then enter 'X' to leave the Monitor.
To move the character set down inside
a Basic program is more difﬁcult. A FOR-
NEXT loop takes over 15 seconds, so I've
written a short machine code routine
which does the task almost instantly. The
program is completely relocatable, i.e. it
will work wherever it is stored in memory.
The Start, End and Length values may be
altered a s  des ir ed f o r  dif f er ent
applications. Figure 2 shows an assembler
listing o f  the routine using the C-16
Assembler published in the June edition
of Your Commodore. It is positioned in a
free space below Basic at $600 hex, 1536
decimal (see last month: Where to store
machine code). To execute the routine
from Basic, type: SYS 1536.
To make your character set the current
one, y o u  m u s t  ﬁr s t  dis able t h e
Shift+Commodore Ke y  w it h  PRINT
CHR$(8), and then set the 'Character data
base address' pointer (at 65299)as desired.
Bits two to seven of this pointer are the
upper six bits of the high byte of the
character set address. This enables the
character set to start at any multiple of 1K.
We are using the ﬁfteenth K (15360 to
16383), so the number entered is 60 (15*4)
decimal.
To specify that the character set will be

accessed from RAM as opposed to ROM,
bit two of address 63298 must beset. As it
is important that the other bits at that
address should remain unchanged, a line
like this should be used:
POKE 65298,PEEK (65298) AND 251
to specify 'character set in RAM'. To get
back to the normal ROM character set,
the following POKEs should be entered:
POKE 65299, 208
POKE 65298,PEEK (65298) OR 4
Whenever an Error is encountered,
the ROM/RAM select bit is reset back to
ROM, creating havoc on the screen if the
'Character data base address' pointer is
not pointing to the ROM character set

Figure 3. Programmable graphics demo
This means that editing should always be
done in normal (ROM) character mode.
Also, it is a good idea to put the 'get
back t o  t h e  nor mal character s et'
commands as the destination of a TRAP
command to stop this happening (see
page 141 of the User Manual). Remember,
however, that the TRAP command must
come after the CLR command used when
lowering the top of RAM.
Entering programmable
characters
The address of the character in RAM can
be found as follows:
Address = Base address + (screen code *8)
The eight bytes for each character can be
read into memory by a simple FOR-NEXT
loop, with the numbers stored in DATA
statements. Figure 3 is a demonstration
program to illustrate the points covered in
this article. The program functions as
follows:
LINE 100 shifts the top of memory down
1K for the new character set.
LINE 110 POKEs into memory the machine
code routine SHIFT-MEM held in  the
DATA statements in line 150-170. It then
calls this routine. The routine shifts the
ROM upper case character set down into
the new RAM area.
LINE 200 READs in the Programmable
character data stored in lines 10000-10090
into the start of the new character set (ﬁrst
character to be deﬁned is '@', then 'A',
then 'BN' etc.).
LINE 210 - 'PRINT CHRS(8)' - disables the
ability to change character sets with the
Shift+Commodore Key. As  only  o n e
character set has been redeﬁned, this
disables the ability to change to a garbage
character set.
LINE 220 turns on TRAP mode to Line 250
and jumps to the Demonstration (Line
1000).
LINE 250-260 The TRAP routine.
LINE 250 prints the error and the line
number on which the error occurred.
LINE 260 ﬁrst changes the BASE address to
point to the ROM character set, then
selects 'character set to be taken from
ROM', then ENDS.
LINE 1000 deﬁnes the colours and clears
the screen.
LINEs 1010-1030 print the border.
LINE 1040 prints your base.
LINE 1050 prints the scores.
LINEs 1100-1130 move aliens right.
LINEs 1200-1230 move aliens right.
LINE 1240 performs this spectacular feat of
imagination all over again.
LINEs 10000-10090 t h e  programmable
characters.
LINEs 10000-10050 the six programmable
characters needed for the alien.
LINE 10060 the border character.
LINE 10070-10090 the base.

Listings will be much easier to
enter with our new system.
COMMODORE LISTINGS ARE RATHER
well known for the horrible little black
blobs that always abound. Unfortunately
the graphics characters which are used to
represent graphic and control characters
do riot reproduce very well and they are
also difﬁcult to ﬁnd on the Commodore
keyboard.
For this reason Your Commodore
started to precede any control characters
with a REM statement on the previous line
that explained exactly what the black
blobs were meant to be. Unfortunately
the graphic s  characters w e r e  n o t
documented and these still cause some
confusion. For this reason we are starting
to use a new method for marking the
control and graphic characters in our
listings.
In future all control and graphics
commands will be replaced by mnemonic
within square brackets. This mnemonic is
not typed out as printed in the magazine
but rather the corresponding key or keys
on the keyboard are pressed. For example
(RIGHT] means press the cursor right key,
you do not type in [RIGHT]. All of the
keywords, what keys to press and how
they are shown on the screen are shown
below.

Let some fresh air into your
graphics with this look
through windows by Allen I
Webb.
1
GREETINGS FELLOW 64 OWNERS, HERE
are some more graphics wheezes to add
that bit of power to your elbows. First,
however, it's grovelling time. Remember
part one of this series? You may have
noticed a POKE to location 1006 in the
demonstration. Much to my embarass-
ment, I didn't tell you what it does. It
holds the number of shifts executed when
you call the roll routines. A value of one
will roll the design one pixel, a value of
two rolls it two pixels, etc. Values greater
than three aren't too helpful, but the use
of this register will make your efforts that
little bit more interesting.
This month I  want t o  deal w ith
graphics windows. A  window i s  a
deﬁnable area of the screen which can be
manipulated independently of the rest of
the screen. The real value of windows is in
the generation of menus and text games
such as adventures.
As usual, the software is given as a
Basic loader in listing one. The code sits at
$C000 so it will unfortunately clash with
the character routines - abject apologies
but such is life.
The ﬁrst problem to resolve is how to
deﬁne a window. Consider Figure 1.
The rectangle represents a window of
width W characters and height H units
somewhere on the screen. The top left
hand corner is ﬁxed by the co-ordinate
XC and VC. These four values are all that is
necessary to specify the window. The
machine code allows you to reserve and
access up to 10 windows - numbered 0 to
9. Each window is deﬁned in four tables in
terms of co-ordinates of the top left hand
corner and the height and width. The
command for specifying a window has the
syntax:
SYS 49155,WN,XC,YC,W,F1
WN is the window number and the other
parameters are as speciﬁed earlier. It is
important that you set u p  a window
before manipulating i t .  W h e n  t h e
program is set up the window tables
contain zero and any action on an un
-deﬁned window will, at best, corrupt
your Basic program so be warned!!
What can you do with the window?
The next command has  t w o  forms
depending on what you wish to do. A ﬂag
decides your action and the syntax. The
ﬁrst form will ﬁll the window with a
speciﬁed character CH:
SYS 49158,WN,0,CH
G r a p h i c s
TOPDRAW
HEIGHT
( XCYC)
i.e. the ﬂag has a zero value. A non-zero
ﬂag simply reverses the contents of the
window:
SYS 49158,WN
If you use the ﬁll command with a
value of CH equal to 32, the window will
be cleared.
Finally, you can scroll the contents of
the screen. To maintain compatibility with
the normal 64 operation, the scrolling is
upwards with the bottom line of the
window being ﬁlled with blanks. The
syntax of this command is:
SYS 49152,WN
To help you see what these routines
will do, I've given two demonstrations.
The ﬁrst shows the manipulation of three
windows a t  once. Since the window
scrolls upwards, you must somehow print
text at the bottom line. In my experience,
the use of cursor control codes and TAB
are both inelegant and tiresome. It's far
better to use a routine in the 64's Kemal.
The following line will do this:
POKE 781,Y: POKE 782,X: POKE 783,0: SYS
65520
where X and Y are the co-ordinates of the
point to which you want to move the
cursor. line 230 in the demo does this.
The s ec ond demonstration us es
randomly created windows to produce a
pattern.
I have included a degree of checking
in the routine so that some illegal values
(e.g. width 40 o r  height 25) will b e
rejected. Not all possibilities are catered
for and it's up to you to ensure that silly
values are not generated in your program.
The routines should be of most value
to adventure freaks since it is simple to
create two or three text windows with
independent scrolling.
Now, I want to deal with a feature
which the BBC, C16 and Spectrum have in
common. The ability t o  use ﬂashing
characters. The simple way to implement
this is  t o  use the attribute o f  each
character to hold a ﬂash ﬂag. This is not
simple to do on the 64 because there is no
spare bit in the video matrix and it isn't
easy to use the top four bits in the colour
matrix. My solution is to let you select a
colour to ﬂash. This colour is kept in
location 1000. The routine is called every
50th of a second by the I RC? interrupt. The
screen is scanned every 25 interrupt calls,
so that the ﬂash rate is about twice a
second. The routine scans the colour
matrix and inverts every character of the
speciﬁed colour. This routine is given in
Listing two and a demonstration in demo
three.
Owners with new ROM 64s should
take a little care. These machines ﬁll the
colour matrix with the current colour
each time the screen is cleared. If the
current colour is the ﬂash colour, the
whole screen w ill ﬂash. Demo three
shows how to use the routine.
To turn off the character ﬂash, simply
enter:
SYS 52736
That's all for this time, see you again next
month. Happy hacking!

THE COUNTDOWN HAS BEGUN

Castle Lodge

Peter Thomas has been
exercising his brain on
Ocean's Summer Games
His verdict was very good.
Read on.
FOR THOSE OF YOU, LIKE ME, WHO
think that physical exercise is moving the
car an extra yard or so from the front door
each morning but w ho are mentally
capable of giving Daley Thompson and
Steve Cram a  r un for  their money,
Summer Games U is just perfect.
Owners o f  t h e  original Summer
Games -  now world leaders in the pole
vault, dab hands at the full tuck dive,
champions in the 4 x 400 metres relay and
challenging Carl Lewis's 100 metre record
- beware! If you have thrown in the towel
in the freestyle relay and consider the
gymnastics and sheet shooting difﬁcult to
master, rest assured that you can sit back
and relax w ith Summer Games I I  -
because it's twice as difﬁcult.
You start with a simple hop, step and
jump in the triple jump and if you don't
fall head ﬁrst in the sand you can watch an
action replay o f  your successful soar
across the sand while the appreciative
crowd applauds.
Oarsmen and women among you can
tackle the single sculls rowing and pit
your s k ill against y our  friends, t h e
computer or the clock. The split screen
makes this  ev ent very exciting and
realistic.
After the water you return to dry land
for the javelin where a combination of
speed, timing and power sees the javelin
ﬂy through the air across the screen.
Again a good throw gains appreciation
from the crowd.
The equestrian event brought back
memories of pony trekking on Dartmoor
when again I seemed to spend more time
on the ground than on the horse. Timing
is essential if you don't want an early
ducking in the water jump.
Once you've had enough of horsing
around you can attempt the high jump.
I'm not sure whether there was a bug in
my version of the game or whether I'm
just not cut out for the high jump, but I
only managed to get over the bar once
and that was on the lowest level.
If y ou'v e g o t  a  gr udge against
someone then you'll love the fencing.
Now you've got your chance to ﬂex your
foil and battle it out with your opponent.
Control is a little difﬁcult but after some
42 prac tic e, and a few beatings, you'll get
used to it.
If you ﬁnd that you have trouble
staying on a tricycle then the cycling event
is certainly not one for you Rotating your
joystick moves the man's legs on the
I
pedals. If you don't move your joystick at 'getting
a steady pace then you'll ﬁnd yourself
getting nowhere and see your opponent
disappear towards the ﬁnishing line.
Kayaking is certainly not an event to be
rushed. You must guide your kayak down
the white water while passing through a
number of gates. Some gates must be
passed through forward, others back-
wards, some you even have to guide
your kayak through while going up-
stream. This is certainly an event which
takes a lot of concentration. You'll soon
ﬁgure out how to guide your craft but
through the gates is a different
matter.
In each event you strive for gold silver
or bronze medals all the time attempting
new heights of glory to become the world
record holder.
Choose which country to represent
out of a possible 18, put on your sports-
wear and prepare for Summer Games IL
Alternatively, lock your bedroom door
switch on your computer and practice
each event for half an hour while going on
a strict diet until you are ready for the next
major championship.

The most powerful games in the Universe

Runecaster risks life and limb
AS I AM SURE YOU ALREADY KNOW,
adventure games can cost quite a lot of
money! Generally speaking the more
expensive games are disc based and
provide you with many hours of pleasure
for your money. The higher middle range
of tapes (around CIO plus) seem lobe the
ones that sometimes make you think.
On the other hand there are a number
of bargains around. My local Spectrum
Chain shop had a couple of good buys...
One would be loosely (very loosely)
classed as an arcade adventure - Mystic
Mansion and the other,a well presented
text adventure, was Allard's Tomb.
Respectively, E2.99 and £1.99.
The ﬁrst, US Gold, hardly comes within
the range of this column but is worth
looking at, especially if you have young
children around. It is a 20 level, ﬁnd the
treasures, avoid the monsters, type of
game with a good difﬁculty grading -
Adult, Teenager or Child.
The second, Allard's Tomb, is a neat
little adventure that does not appear to
have any hideous inconsistencies and at
the price is well worth buying. Fairly
conventional scenario.. ,dark dungeons,
in which you have to ﬁnd the aforesaid
Tomb, solving several ingenious puzzles
in the process.
Keep your eyes skinned for these and
other 'cheapies', they are often either
reissues or  are stock from defunct
software houses. You will not ﬁnd Exodus:
Ultima III, The Hobbit or Eureka but may
well ﬁnd something t o  keep you
interested.
=
Kitchen spin-off...
Down i n  the  kitchen something
stirred,. .or rather squeaked! I t  was
probably the lady of the house using one
of those reusable shopping list boards -
you know the type: plastic-faced and
supplied with a water soluble ink marker.
Make notes throughout the week on what
is required - buy them on Saturday and
wipe the 'slate' clean on Sunday.
What has this to do with playing
adventures? Well, a ﬁrm in Wales, Mapit,
has produced a plastic reusable Map
Maker. It is A3 size (two pages of Your
Commodore) and has a 13x11 grid of
14x27mm rectangles printed on it.. .just
the thing for mapping all your trips
elsewhere! There is space at the top of the
board to make 'vital notes' and the pens
supplied have a ﬁne enough point to
enable all the vital facts of a location to be
recorded in the space provided.

Over the moon
Level Nine does it again. Red Moon is the
latest from Britain's number one
adventure software house. As usual the
products are available for a number of
computers but of interest to us here is the
C64 version.
Over 200 pictures can be found as you
explore the 'magik' land of the Red
Moon. Level Nine seems to improve with
age, not only can you turn the pictures off,
saving the 'drawing' time, but with this
program you can even type in commands
whilst the pictures are being created on
the screen!
The Red Moon is about a land where
Magik works, albeit nowhere nearly as
strongly as in the past. In the past the
moon was crimson red and the source of
all the great Magiks. As the moon faded to
the grey we know today, so the Magik
wanted. A great concourse of Magicians
created a substitute -  the Red Moon
Crystal. This was mounted in the Moon
Tower of Baskalos and shone out over the
kingdom, maintaining an island of Magik
and enlightened Civilization.
But...the great Crystal was stolen. The
Red Moon is the story of how a Magician
(you!) recovered this fabulous gem and
restored hope to the World,
Not only are there hundreds of scene
setting pictures but there are also the long
and descriptive texts that have always
been the hallmark of Level Nine games.
Read, and wonder at it all., how do they
get it all into our computer's memory?
The pictures are good, better than the
rather surrealistic landscapes of Return to
Eden. They are certainly not high, hi-res
works of art but serve the very important
purpose of visually triggering recognition
of your present location.
As with all Level Nine games (and most
other good adventures!) it is important to
keep a careful map of your progress.
There is a temptation when recognizable
pictures are displayed, t o skip the
mapping procedures. .ﬁght this
temptation - draw a map!
Unlike many games where a n
apparently insoluble puzzle bars your
progress within a few steps of your entry
point, Red Moon has plenty of locations
for even the absolute novice to explore
right from the start. Do not think that this
implies a  beginners game, even
accomplished adventurers will b e
gnashing their teeth on occasions. For
those that get totally lost and confused,
Level Nine offers the best hint sheets in
the business. These are so laid out that it is
not easy to read something you wish you
hadn't!
Artefacts found soon after entry will
include t he  inevitable lamp f or
subsequent exploration in  dark and
dangerous places. Dangerous? Yes! There
are a number of decidedly aggressive
creatures just waiting for you to stumble
by. To be successful you will have to ﬁght
them. Bare hands are not t o  be
recommended, ﬁnd a useful weapon and
better still some armour to protect you.
You start your foray into this other world
with some 50 'hit points', it is surprising
how quickly these can be used up. The
use o f  Magik is  permitted, even
encouraged. To implement these spells
you must enter a command of the type
'CAST ZAP', Each spell may only be cast
successfully if you have the object that is
the 'focus' for that particular spell.
'CAST ZAP' is used to magically attack
an enemy but you must have the jewelled
dagger (or it to work. Casting spells also
uses up some of your 'hit points', so try
not to be too extravagant with them.
SAVE and RESTORE your current
position are also counted as spells! In this
case no 'focus' is required but it still uses
up your 'hit points'. A clever dodge this, as
it stops us making dozens of 'safety saves'.
Neither can y ou cast a  spell
successfully if you have iron about your
person (or at that location). You cannot
fault the logic, even if it is a little
frustrating at times!
The C64 tape version utilizes a 'rapid
loader' and takes just less than three
minutes to load this massive program. So,
even though disc versions are usually
available the gain is fairly small.
Level Nine is to be congratulated on
keeping standards at such a high level for
such an extended time...good luck and
roll on the next one - but please give me a
little time to solve this one ﬁrst!
Sore ﬁngers...
Although the range of good software
grows as time goes by, there are always
some people who like to 'do their own
thing'. Obviously if you get that good at it
we will start reading about your work in
this column!
Many others spend enjoyable hours
pounding their keyboards typing in
programs gleaned from magazines or
books. This can often be very, very good
programming practise. This is the way to
learn how a program works (often the
hard but permanent way - by having to
debug it!).
It is also often possible to see how to
improve on the published listing. The
original programmer was probably
heavily involved in his program, whereas
you will be looking at each section in a
fresh light.
There are a
market that will help you write adventure
games on the Commodore 64, On the
other hand, new ones are always
welcome, you never know what new
routines you may ﬁnd! Book is nowadays
are rarely cheap but in terms of time spent
at your computer are probably much
cheaper than the average piece of
software. Two offerings have come our
fat-,
- Ad% cntures for your Carnmi•dore Itiot

way recently, one American and one
British.
The ﬁrst is: Golden Flutes 8  Great
Escapes by DeIton T Horn, published by
dil ithi um Press, ISBN  0-8806-051-7. There
are over 200. Four complete listings are
given together with hints, tips, ﬂow charts
and possible variations to the game play.
The book is written in clear English
(American?) and presents the writing of
adventure games in a modular form that
should be understood by the reader. The
listings are in BASIC and are for text only
displays. Although I have not keyed any of
them in, they look reasonably interesting
if you are just starting out along this path.
They should give you plenty to think
about, Dilithium Press Publications are
distributed in the United Kingdom by:
Holt Saunders Ltd, 1, St Anne's Road, East-
bourne BN21 MA .  Holt Saunders has a
number of titles dealing with computers
and computing, lists o f  these are
obtainable from the above address.
The second book i s  Castles and
Kingdoms by Bob Liddil, published by
Virgin Books, ISBN 0-86369-094-7 -  186
pages cost £5.99. This book is quite
different t o  t h e o n e above as n o
explanation of each individual program is
given.
Listings for 15 (!) different adventures
are given together w it h  a  p ag e
(210x265mm) or so to set the scene for
each. Again the programs are in BASIC
and are clearly set out for you to type in.
The games are presented for you to play
rather than learn from but the inevitable
debugging i s  bound t o  teach yo u
something.
Both books appear to offer good value
for money - look Out for them and let us
know how you get on! Both publications
offer copies of the games on cassette for
the lazy amongst us!

Not for the gentle..
Do you remember Dallas by US Gold? It
dppeared in this country last year and was
acclaimed by many reviewers at the time.
If you have not played it, try to get your
computer shop to demonstrate it for you.
It is disc based only and has excellent
graphics that are called from the disc as
you proceed.
What made me think of Dallas is a
recent issu e f r o m  Activision -
Mindshadow. It too is disc based and also
has good graphics, again called from the
disc. The plot is novel too, you awake on a
desert island., not knowing who you are!
The aim of the game is to discover your
own identity and who left you to perish...
As the story unfolds you ﬁnd yourself
travelling around the world in search of
the answers. The program is well con-
ceived and presented, the puzzles are
good and the use of the function keys well
thought out.
The o n ly thing I  h ave against
Mindshadow is the underlying need to
behave i n  a  somewhat underhand
manner t o  succeed! As a  barbarian
clobbering trolls or a thief stealing deftly
through dungeons - I have no qualms...
but striking out with no provocation or
stealing from a sleeping tramp. , .1 dunno.
That gripe apart this is a good adventure
and the use of the function keys make it
very easy t o  play. T h e most used
commands are immediately a t  your
ﬁngertips. SAVE, LOAD, REPEAT, HELP,
DROP, G E T ,  Q U I C K SA VE a n d
QUICKLOAD a r e  al l  function k e y
commands.
SAVE and LOAD allow you the option
of 10 different game positions. These may
be overwritten at any time you change
your min d throughout t h e game.
QUICKSAVE a n d  QUICKLOAD a re
particularly nice features as they allow
you t o  save your present position
'temporarily' at any time you think your
next move may be your last!
HELP enlists the assistance of a wise old
bird - the Condor why a Condor I do not
know but he can be darn useful! His help
can only be given three times.. .so make
use of his knowledge carefully. You can of
course start from scratch and use the help
gained in previous games to reach your
last position, then get three new HELPs!
Although there are some devious parts
to Mindshadow, it is not a very difﬁcult
game to play. The number of locations in
each section is not large and although
mapping sh o u ld  alw ays b e  a n
adventurer's ﬁrst line of attack it is not
always necessary here. You must solve
each section before you can proceed, so
at least you know how you are doing! If
you are unable to go anywhere else then
you know you have missed something!
For all that, I still do not know who I
am.. there are n o  prizes t o  anyone
making any unkind suggestions!

C16/Plus 4 Joystick optional
This game, originally on the 64 has now
been converted to the 16. In effect, the
game is 30 Pac-man and you are
actually standing in the maze. The
scenario is as before. You must collect
C64
As its title Sky Fox might suggest it is
about a jet tighter but it's not one of the
ﬂight simulators that have become
popular lately, more of an air combat
simulator. Thus the pilot doesn't have to
concern himself with all the intricacies
of take oft and landing but can
concentrate on the important business
of zapping baddies.
This brings us onto the game itself.
The story goes that the baddies have
invaded, either from another country or
another planet, and are about the usual
invader - like things such as killing and
destroying. Your job is, of course, to -
repel the invaders and save the
world/country _ In order to achieve this
you are equipped with the Sky Fox
tighter plane, a weapon capable of
standing still in the air or zapping along
at speeds of 3000mphl The Sky Fox
boasts a full complement of baddie
blasters ranging from general purpose
laser guns to the air to air heat-seeking
mega missiles.
The screen displays a cockpit view
that has three large windows and a
radar display which shows either an all
round proximity scan or a sort of
weaponry screen complete with gun
sights. Also available is a direct link to
the main battle computer at your base.
When activated this swings out on an
expanding window to cover the whole
display. This  computer link supplies
information about the progress of the
war with the status of various
installations being displayed so that you
can judge where you are most urgently
required.
Also in the data banks is a battle plan
displaying the position and number of
your foes as well as the locations of
your base and the other establishments.
This plan may be used to navigate but
all the blue dots on the ﬂoor of tne maze
whilst avoiding the attentions of the
gloopers.
These brown creatures patrol the
maze and will munch you given half a
chance. There are a number of red dots
which empower you, for a limited time
to munch the gloopers. During this
period, the gloopers are coloured yellow
rather than their usual brown. Clear all
the dots and you move Onto another
screen.
The screen shows a perspective view
of the maze walls and side passages. A
combination of brick patterns and
coloured shading helps the effect. The
gloopers are quite simple in design but
grow nicely in size as you approach
them. In all a surprisingly neat bit of
graphics.
You can examine your immediate
using the auto pilot is much more fun as
it will either take you to a speciﬁc
location or it will ﬁnd the nearest
zappable baddie and zoom there at
3000mph.
Whilst being great fun and very
convenient, this auto pilot knows
nothing of air combat and thus usually
engages you with the enemy from the
worst possible position. Combat takes
two forms. First is the ground force
consisting of groups of ﬁve tanks. These
appear on the display as tiny little blobs
on the horizon. At this stage the blobs
may be disposed of with the lasers very
easily. This would be a shame however
because the blobs grow into very
detailed battle tanks that shoot at you as
you approach and to miss this would
spoil the fun. So my advice on the tanks
would be destroy all but one, ﬂy over
that admiring the excellent graphics and
then turn round and blow it to hell!
The other form of combat is in the
air, as you climb from ground level you
pass into the cloud layer and the screen
goes blank. At this point the disk is
being accessed but I think the cloud
idea is a nice cover for this. Once
through you are presented with a view
of clouds and are in the domain of the
enemy jet ﬁghters. These usually don't
appear at all because the auto pilot
lands you in the ﬁght with the nasties
behind you. If you do manage to get
one in front of you don't forget to be
amazed by the smooth animation of
such a large and detailed shape before
you target the heat seeker and despatch
it to the same late that the tanks
suffered. This aside, I should state that
the air combat is not easy at all and
took me many goes to get the hang of it.
The biggest and baddest of all are
the mother ships. These are like large
ﬂoating cities in the sky. The mother
ships send out all the other baddies so a
good plan is to take on the mother ships
ﬁrst to prevent them sending out
replacements for the tanks and jets that
you destroy. As big as they are they can
be taken out by laser work but a lot of
careful ﬂying is required to get past the
internal defences and they need to be
hit a number of times due to their
armour. Once you have exhausted your
supplies of missiles and fuel you can
land at your base to stock up. That is if
it still exists!
The game has a large range of
options such as difﬁculty levels from
Novice to Ace of the Base and practice
levels involving only air or only ground
combat. Also selectable is the scale of
the baddies' attack and the form of your
task. These have titles such as cornered,
The Alamo and. my personal favourite.
Massive Onslaught.
rroundings on a small map which
appears at the top of the screen. This
shows the position of dots and gloopers.
If a glooper starts to approach you, a
warning sound is given. The keyboard
or joystick is used to move about
the maze. You can move at quite a
speed but this isn't always advisable
since you can easily turn a corner
straight into the arms of a glooper.
In this world of more sophisticated
software, it's nice to play a simple but
addictive game. I found Pac-man rather
tiresome since the whole action is
visible. In this game, you have no idea
where the gloopers are. This engenders
a surprising amount of excitement. I
found this game great fun to play and
quite addictive. The graphics are simple
but most effective. At the price quit e
good value for money.

C64 — I  or 2 joysticks
This sequel to the successful Beach-
Head is not just one game, but four
games in one, for one or two players.
The evil dictator known as the
Dragon has captured some of your
men and is holding them hostage in his
heavily fortiﬁed island home. The task of
the allied forces is to storm the island.
C-16 - joystick optional
For those who like graphics without
mathematics, Paintbox is a must for
Commodore users: I say users as one
side of the tape is for the C64 and the
other for the C-16.
Loading is fast and efﬁcient and
the menu display scrolls smoothly along
the bottom of the screen. At any point
the menu is instantly accessible by
pressing the space-bar. The menu
controls a variety of options including
saving to tape or disk and a fast eraser
Now what does the program offer?
DRAWING is, of course, a standard
feature using joystick or keyboard. To
this is added:
Line - Allows a line to be drawn at any
angle,
Lines - draws a series of lines starting
from where the last one ﬁnished.
Pays - gives a series of lines starting
from the same point.
Framing - provides a rectangle of any
given size at any position on the screen
while BOX gives a solid rectangle of any
chosen colour, CIRCLE at any place,
any size and use DISC to give a colour
ﬁlled circle.
This sounds pretty much the same as
usual but, believe me, the use of
'rubber-banding' technique gives you
tremendous scope and versatility.
When we come to PAINTING the full
colour range is available for ﬁlling
enclosed areas while, in DRAWING
mode eight options are available from
very ﬁne line to very thick pen which are
really excellent. Drawing speed may also
be controlled.
For the C64 alone there are extra
rescue the prisoners and escape with
them by helicopter. You then do battle
in single combat with the Dragon
himself.
These four screens may be played in
any order, with three skill levels for
each. You may choose to play the allied
troops or the dictator's forces, so many
permutations are available.
The attack phase involves landing
your troops by parachute from a
helicopter, then advancing them
individually past two barriers under
withering machine gun ﬁre. You will lose
many of your men, and will need to
sacriﬁce some for the safety of others.
Bonus points are scored for successful
grenade attacks on the machine gun
position.
To rescue the hostages you use a
captured machine gun against a
bewildering array of forces, all intent on
killing them. This is not easy, as the
tanks and armoured trucks need to be
hit in exactly the right spot to knock
them out.
In the escape stage you ﬂy
helicopters, loaded with escapees. past
a series of obstacles while under
constant ﬁre. You can strike back, and
you score points for targets destroyed
as well as soldiers rescued. The Dragon
sets the difﬁculty level for each of the
three sorties, and the highest level is
really hard!
Finally, having tracked the Dragon to
his lair, you engage him in battle with
wooden spears called Poontas, from
opposite banks of an underground river.
You move, duck and jump, and can
control the spears in ﬂight, making them
swerve. Four hits win a round, nine of
which must be played in all.
A marvellous game - challenging
throughout, with excellent graphics and
the best software speech I've heard. It
deserves to be a great success!

C64 — joystick optional
If you have quick wits, cool hands and
an iron nerve, then this is a game you
must buy! You can experience the thrill
of high-performance motor-Cycle racing
at any of the world's top 10 circuits,
from Brands Hatch to Daytona, at
speeds of up to 250 miles per hour. And
all this from the comfort of your own
armchair!
Each of the circuits is faithfully
reproduced. with good graphical
representation of the scenery, the track
and, of Course. the bikes. You race
against 19 other riders, starting at the
back of the grid. If you collide with
another bike you crash, but can set off
again. Wandering off the roadway slows
you down too. and eventually makes
you lose control.
Your machine is equipped with six
gears, which you can change up and
down, and the sound effects
accompanying gear-changes are most
realistic. Holding down the ﬁre button
(or space bar) causes constant
acceleration. Releasing it slows you
RACING DESTRUCTION SET
Arlolasoft E14.95
C64
Have y ou ever had the urge to get in a
powerful c ar and race round a track as
quickly as possible? Destruction Set will
allow you to indulge all your fantasies and
more
The game consists of two race cars
on the same track. Each car's progress
is displayed on a separate window on
the screen so if one driver gets ahead of
his opponent he doesn't disappear off
the screen. The cars are rather like slot
cars as they will turn corners on their
own and the only control required is to
change slots and accelerate.
So what is the Construction in the
title for? Well this is because RIDS
allows the user to either choose one of
about 20 pre-formed race tracks or even
to make one up himself. This allows all
sorts of differing terrains and thus the
game can change from a Formula One
at Silverstone to a dirt track rally on the
moon!
To enable the cars to race on the
different surfaces the user can also
control the design and speciﬁcation of
his car. This allows such things as a
Corvet Stingray with an 8.2 litre engine
right down to a 250cc Bike.
Care has to be taken when choosing
a vehicle as it is very easy to construct a
car that is too heavy to get up the steep
hills or not powerful enough to get off
the ice. It is great fun however to pit two
entirely different cars against each other
on a variable track and see one catch up
on the straights due to its power but
then fall behind on the hills due to its
weight.
What about the destruction bit. I hear
you ask? Well this is great fun as well
because the game offers options to
carry oil for throwing in the path of your
opponent and land mines to blow him
up! The problem with both the oil and
the mines is that they stay where they
are and stay nasty as well so if you drop
a land mine in a place where your
opponent can't miss it he will blow up,
but on the next lap if you can't get past
it, so will you!
Although the game does a lot of very
slow disk accessing, I think that it's
excellent and I recommend it.
J.G.D.
down, but for heavy braking you will
need t o change down.
Various options are open to you. In
addition to the choice of circuit, you
may select novice, pro or champion skill
levels, and you are given a preview of
the chosen track. You may also do as
many practice laps as you wish, before
setting off under race conditions. The
length of the race may be two, foJr or
six laps. The computer records th a total
time for the race. and your fastest lap
time.
I was impressed with everything
about this game. It is very well
programmed fast and exciting. There is
plenty of scope for improving your skill
by practising, and plenty of variety. It
sets a standard for motor-cycling games
which will be difﬁcult to beat So put on
your crash-helmet and get started! P.R.B.

This is another C64 conversion from
Supersoft. From memory, I don't think
have been many alterations from
the original.
The plot is somewhat unusual in that
you must protect a cactus from the
unfriendly attentions of a swarm of
wasps and hornets. Your efforts are
hindered by interfering moles and
vultures. In effect this is a shoot-em-up
game similar in ﬂavour to centipede but
with its own attraction.
On screen you get a side view of the
cactus and the ground level. You may
move above or below the ground via
holes in the ground. The swarm of
wasps and hornets approach from above
and ﬂy from side to side slowly moving
•
 d o wn wa r d s .  You must prevent them
from reaching the base of the cactus
w h e r e t hey c a n d o t h e mos t damage.
Unfortunately, it isn't a simple matter
of shooting the wasps. Moles move from
side to side trying to ﬁll in the holes in
the ground and cut off your means of
access You, of course, can shoot them.
After screen one, vultures ﬂy across
dropping eggs. These bounce about and
will destroy you on contact.
C
 5
Graphically, the game is simple with
limited use of the C16's colour abilities.
The animation of the wasps is quite
good but overall the nasties don't really
look like the creatures they are
supposed to be. Sound is limited to
zapping noises although a nice version
of Lincolnshire Poacher starts the game.
Whilst this game doesn't break new
ground in sophistication, it presents a
real challenge. The ﬁrst screen is
deceptively easy, but our friends the
vultures make life pretty tricky later.
They seem to aim their eggs accurately
and the bouncing bomb behaviour of
the eggs is tricky to judge.
Overall, not a bad game especially
bearing in mind the lack of material for
the C16. The rather primitive graphics
do the game no favours but it does offer
a good old fashioned zapping session.

WORD PERFECT
Supersoft f.19 95 disk
C64
I dare say that a good many owners of
the 64 have considered the beneﬁts to
be derived from using a word processor
but have been deterred by the high price
of most of the programs currently
available.
Even if you don't own a printer, a
word processor can still be extremely
useful. How many of you_ for instance,
can sit down to write a letter and get it
right ﬁrst time without having to
rearrange paragraphs, correct spelling
or syntax errors, or even re-write the
entire thing, perhaps several times? With
the aid of a word processor and a little
typing practice the whole task becomes
very much easier. Using the screen as a
sort of electronic note pad, you can
organise your thoughts and correct any
errors, all without committing anything
to paper.
However, whilst appreciating the
above, many people will be unable to
justify the expense of a program which
although very useful is somewhat limited
in its application in the home Word
Perfect from Supersoft has recently
been released and seems to be aimed at
just such a market. The program is
available in both disk and tape format.
the disk version being the one reviewed
here.
Word Perfect is a scaled down word
processor and as such it is suited to any
of the uses to which you would put a
typewriter, but with most of the
advantages of word processing. The
program loaded quickly arid reliably and
resides in the protected RAM above

important features of a word processor
are there, although some of them such

option of saving your ﬁnished document

Although some of the more usual
commands are missing, right justify and

feel that their absence will cause too
much inconvenience.
The program allows the use of a wide
range of printers although, as with all
software tht uses a printer, it would be
prudent to check that your particular set
up works before buying.
Word Perfect comes complete with a
well written 16 page booklet that should
enable even the novice to quickly get to
grips with the program While perhaps
not suited to serious ofﬁce work, I feel
it has a lot to offer the home user. This
review was written with the aid of Word

the future

you are shown the map which roughly
shows your route between cities and the

encounter. You can scream across the
great American countryside/desert/

downtown conurbation like San

using the joystick, while keeping an eye
on your fuel. If you allow your RPM to
stay in the 'red-line' too long your
engine blows up but it doesn't take too
much skill to avoid this catastrophe.
Fuel consumption is, I found, another
story. This particular hazard really

Then the creatures travel to the

whilst the controllers decide what type
of combat is to be engaged. One owner
will decide the terrain, and this should
be chosen to give your creature the
maximum advantage and your
opponents the least. So if an owner has
an amphibious creature he could choose
a terrain with lots of water thus
conﬁning his opponent to the land.
The other owner must try to nullify
the disadvantages of the terrain by
selecting the type of combat. The ﬁrst
type is the simple destruction combat
where each player will ﬁght to the death
with the creatures found in the arena
and the opponent.
The second requires ﬂags to be
collected in order. Each ﬂag is defended
by an arena creature.
The third type is called the horde.

that this would not have been necessary
if the gas stations were more clearly
deﬁned, because if you only just miss
one you've got to go to the next one

infuriating!
The clever touches in this arcade
game are what make it different. As you
travel the road, conditions change along

This is when both creatures must work
together to defeat an invading horde
that comes from the top of the screen
and is attempting to reach the bottom.
The one who kills most hordlings wins.
As I mentioned, the arena contains
'Urban Defenders'. In a one player game
all these creatures are played by the
computer but in a two player game the
creature is played by your opponent. So,
if a creature runs into an urban
defender, the screen clears to a combat
screen and the two players battle to the
death. This is done by selecting
weapons and blasting the enemy. This
requires a great deal of dexterity and
practice is recommended. If the player is
victorious in his attack on the urban
defender then the screen changes back
to the large map and the game goes on.
Graphics on this game aren't
stunning but none of the construction
series are. The game is a different
matter as it is excellent and I found it
extremely addictive.

liked that. If you go too fast you attract
the attention of the fuzz and they pull

Altogether this is just another road-

places with good scrolling graphics, I
feel that once you've seen one there
isn't a lot of difference in the rest - but
this is certainly one of the best. D . F .

instance, be anyone from the controller

altogether, adds to the general

only atmosphere generated by this
attempt to mix all the aspects of micro-
gamesmanship in one package. I think
it's a shame that the game didn't live up
to my expectations especially after the
stunning graphics that are displayed
after the animation sequence.
The game is staged in central
London where the rats are swiftly taking

soon becomes very boring indeed! As all
the f un in real pinball is in the ﬂashing
lights and ping. ping, ping noise.
Anyway, bac k  t o  t h e  game.  A s  I
mentioned, t h e  g a me  allows  u s e  o f
bumpers and ﬂippers. It also has many
advanced features such as a ball hopper
which collects balls, until it's full at which
point it releases them all putting four balls
in play at once. Another interesting feature
is the AND gate that allows special scores
to be awarded for good play.
All in all I was disappointed by this
Nice idea but a boring game. J . G . D .

within London, whilst keeping the three
main characters alive and not at the
expense of every last man lack in your
defence forces. To fail in any part
results in defeat and some supposedly
horrifying graphics.
To effect the destruction of the rats
you are given various tools and
professional forces to help you and you
must put into action Foskins (one of
your main characters) strategic battle to
do this. This is done by moving a
cursor again to pick the words (your
choice of which is maddeningly limited)
to build the command. Needless to say,
I was shredded very quickly and often.
It is a good idea, but with the lack of
atmosphere and the limitations imposed
by the program I found it hard work and
It lost my interest very quickly. Like I
said, I'd read the book, seen the ﬁlm,
and now I've played the game. I think I
would have prefered the pie!—
D.P.
practically impossible, and response to
the joystick is very slow indeed. The
game proceeds at the pace of a snail
with corns!
The only sound-effect, apart from a
discordant fanfare at the start, is like
nothing so much as brushing a pair of
shoes, or perhaps a veteran washing-
machine. There is a high-score table, of
a sort, but even that is mud-coloured.
The inlay asks "Will you have the
stamina and strength to last the whole
course?" - I very much doubt it!
If I seem rather unkind, it is well
deserved. This is the poorest game I
have seen for a long time, and the best
thing to do with it is cover the tabs on
the cassette and record something else
over the top. Unless, perhaps, you suffer
from insomnia?

1E6
THIS MONTH I INTEND TO DISCUSS
THE value o f  adventures as
educational aids. In contrast to the
monthly adventure columnist, with
whom I don't want to compete, I will
be advising the uninitiated, not
preaching to the converted.
Many parents feel that programs
other than educational software
cannot be of any. beneﬁt to their
children. This is simply untrue since
we learn something no matter what
task we're performing. The noisiest
shoot the alien game may seem
pointless but it does teach eye-hand
co-ordination and helps improve
reaction times. Adventures are a
more subtle means of combining
enjoyment with learning.
Before diving into the material, it
would be best to try to describe what
is meant by an adventure. Initially,
adventures were simply word-games
programmed o n  m a in frame
computers. With the development of
home micros, the games have
changed form. First the text acquired
graphics, the n animation a nd
interaction was developed and ﬁnally
arcade/real time features appeared.
AU offer similar beneﬁts albeit in
differing proportions.
Most adventures involve placing
the player, or his alter-ego, in an
artiﬁcial scenario. By use of various
forms of  instruction, the player
endeavours to solve certain problems
or achieve certain goals. The scenario
can basically be anywhere and can be
mapped on a  piece of paper. A
building, for example. can be drawn
in terms of rooms and passages.
The ﬁrst task usually attempted in
an adventure is  t o  map. by
exploration, the area where you ﬁnd
yourself - just as you would in real
life. This means that you may need to
know such concepts as the points of
the compass and left, right etc. The
scenario is normally too complex to
memorise, forcing you to draw some
form of map. Again this is a tricky task
involving the manipulation of spatial
concepts.
The mapping operations and the
actual solution of the game need a
rather special form of skill -the ability
to think logically and apply lateral
reasoning. A simple example is how
to get past a ﬁre breathing serpent
which blocks your way when you're
carrying a sword, a bucket of water
and wearing running shoes. You
could: Kill the dragon; put his ﬁre out
with the water; out run him; or use
your map and ﬁnd another route.
The problem is to ﬁnd the correct
solution and the means to achieve it
using thought, trial and error and
patience. All useful skills for real life.
Most of the best adventures use
text t o convey information and
accept instructions. These processes
will help improve reading, increase
vocabulary, spelling, comprehension
and creative writing but not to an
extreme degree.
That's the boring bit out of the
way, let us look at what's available. It
might be easiest to deal with them in
rough age groups (this list is not
exhaustive, simply a guide).
Under-tens
The Magic Sword (Database
Publications) is a fairy tale book plus a
simple adventure. The adventure
uses simple text with graphics and the
instructions a r e  mostly k e y
commands. You must ﬁnd the prince
(who has been turned into a frog) so
that he can save Princess Poppy from
the wicked witch.
Danger Mouse in the Black Forest
Chateau (Creative Sparks) is  a
graphics/ text adventure with menu
driven command structure. There are
lots of silly puns and great fun, pretty
too. Help Danger Mouse save the
world from the Pi-beam.
Early Secondary (and Smart
Little-Uns)
This age group seems to prefer
arcade type action and there are a
doss ammo
a
range of tough graphics-only games
to choose from. All of these require
problem solving and lateral thought
Some worthy titles include
Impossible Mission (Epyx), an arcade
style game requiring both physical
and mental agility; Staff of Kamath
(Ultimate), a  magic type game
involving exploration of a tomb and
the ﬁghting of foes with magic; Elidort
(Orpheus) in which you guide the
fairy on her search for magic potions
and plants; Dungeons o f  Ba
(Quicksilva), search the dungeons,
ﬁnd the treasure kill the rustles:
Shadow ﬁre (Beyond) uses advanced
graphics techniques. You control an
inter-galactic 'A' team trying to
rescue an ambassador; Tir Na No
(Gargoyle). a Celtic legend in which
you help the hero ﬁnd the Seal of
Calum; Exodus: Ultima III (US Gold).
Dragons and Dungeons style, you
lead your band of heroes on a quest
Teens to Old-Uns
The most challenging games tend to
be text or text/graphics adventures
•Whilst graphics help brighten up a
game, you should be aware that the
pictures only rarely give clues to the
solution of the game. The list of such
games is endless. There are some
excellent software houses who are
almost guaranteed t o produce
excellent games.
Those of note are:
Infocom -  disk only, heavy use of
detailed and absorbing text - a sense
of humour vital. Those worth looking
at are the Zork Trilogy (wizards and
dungeons). Starcross and Suspended
(science ﬁction) and Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy (humorous).
Level Nine - early games text only,
later games use graphics. Complex
games with many locations -  text
compression ensures detailed
descriptions.
Adventure International -  not the
most complex games but have a very
high content of puzzles. Great variety
covering many types of scenario.
Later games include Gremlins and
Incredible Hulk.
Individual games of note are:
The Hobbit (Melbourne House) -
on the book, quite tough.
Twin Kingdom Valley (Bug Byte) -
superb graphics, complex and quite
tough.
Fourth Protocol (Hutchinson) -
amazing graphics, needs deep
thought and a devious mind.

gave all the initialisation and
wedge routines needed to add
extra commands to the Basic of
a C64 computer. Also included
in that article was a  single

article I  am giving four new
commands, APPEND, CHANGE,
DUMP and FIND. These are
very us eful ' t oolk it '  t y p e
commands for editing a pro-
gram and are consequently all
used in direct mode.
These four new commands
all require t he wedge and

Each line that is changed is
listed if there is anything left to
list.
Syntax: CHANGE dstel ddstr2d
- wher e d  i s  a  delimiter
character that does not appear
in either of the strings (stri or
str2).
Errors: Syntax error -  if the
format is not as above. String
too long -  if either MCI or str2
are longer than 40 characters.
Use: CHANGE has a number of
uses. An example would be;
CHANGE P R I N T  PRINT#4.
To change all occurrences of
'PRINT' to 'PRININ4,', or:
CHANGE "PRINT'"PRINT#4,"
which will change all occur-
rences of the text 'PRINT' to the
text 'PRINT114,'.
Note: N o t  a l l  d e lim e t e r
characters will work in all cases,
for example:
CHANGE /REM///
As the character ' / '  has two
values the ﬁrst is the token for
divide and the second is just
the ASCII slash character.
The same is true of DATA.
Other characters that will have
the same effect are: 
=
 r .
Routine entry point: $86BB
Routine operation: CHANGE
uses most of the FIND routines
to ﬁnd stri and list the line.
CHANGE r eads  i n  t h e
delimiter byte and stores it
away. The string to be changed
is then read in until the second
delimiter character is reached
and stored. The next character
is checked to see that it equals
the delimiter character and if
so the string to change to is
read i n  until t he delimiter
character is found again or the
end of command.
The rest of the routine is just
a loop ﬁnding all occurrences,
changing them and lis ting
until the end of the program.
The actual r outine that
changes the string uses the
Basic input buffer and the Basic
routines to change a line. The
routine copies the line up to
still into the buffer, the change
string (str2) is then copied to
the buffer and the remainder
of the line is copied over. The
pointers are then set so that the
next byte to check is the one
following str2,

DUMP
Abbreviated entry: D(shift)U
Affected Basic abbreviations:
None
Token: Hex SEE, SOC Decimal
238,12
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended mode: Direct
Purpose: To display the values
of all simple variations, name
functions, and display t h e
dimensions of arrays.
Syntax: DUMP
Errors: None
Use: F or  de-bugging Basic
programs, the DUMP command
may be used after the program
has r un t o  get a  list of all
variables and their values. As an
added bonus, not found in any
other DUMP command for the
Commodore 64, a l l  array
dimensions are also given. The
DUMP command w i l l  als o
display function names.
Routine entry point: $8802
Routine operation: The DUMP
routine sets a pointer to the
start of variables and checks for
the end of variables. If it does
not ﬁnd any, the variable name
is read in and displayed, the
variable type is  determined,
and the display is produced
according t o  which ty pe is
required. W h e n  a l l  s imple
variables have been processed,
arrays are handled. The array
names are read and displayed
in the same way as the simple
variables and the number of
dimensions r ead o f f .  T h e
pointer is then set to the end of
the dimension entries and,
reading bac k war ds , t h e

displayed.
FIND
Abbreviated entry: F(shift)I
Affected Bask abbreviations:

inside a Basic program.
Syntax: FIND string -where d is
the delimiter character as in
CHANGE.
Errors: Syntax error -  if the
syntax is not as above. String
too long - if the string is longer

checking Basic programs, for
example:
FIND PR IN T
which will ﬁnd and list all lines
containing t h e  c ommand
PRINT. If PRINT occurs more
than once on a line, the line will
be listed each time it is found
with the exception of the last
lines where the line will be
listed only once.
Routine entry point: $8D93
Routine operation: The string
to be found is read in within
quotes, including spaces and
colons and stored away. The
rest of the program is a loop
that searches the program until
the string has been found, lists
the line, and starts searching
from the next character.
The error message vector is
stored away and replaced with
a jump to an 'RTS' so that LIST
will return to the routine.
APPEND
Abbreviated entry: A(shift)P
Affected Basic abbreviations:
NONE
Token: Hex SEE,S03 Decimal
238,3
Modes: Direct and program
Recommended mode: Direct
Purpose: T o  load a program
into memory so that it appears
'on t o p '  o f  t h e  c ur r ent
program. This routine will work
with both disk and cassette and
the variable pointers when
loaded are set to the end of
the combined program. When
this routine is used, you should
check that the line numbers of
the APPENDed program are
larger than the line numbers of
the program in memory.
Syntax: APPEND [ﬁlename[,4
sli) -  where d  is the device
number and s is the secondary
address.
Errors: The same errors will be
encountered as in  the Basic
command LOAD.
Use: This routine would be
used mostly to add Basic library
routines onto the end of your
programs. I t  would be used
rather than MERGE because
APPEND is much faster.
Routine entry point: SE408
Routine o p erat io n :  T h e
APPEND routine uses LOAD's
parameter parsing routine to
get the ﬁlename etc. then sets
the secondary address so that it
loads at the end of the Basic
program in memory_ The load
=  
C

routine is then called and the
program r e- c hained a n d
variable pointers set.
These ex tended Bas ic
routines are all taken from the
book Advanced Commodore
64 Basic Revealed by  Nic k
Hampshire, publis hed b y
Collins.

Nick Hampshire
Although it is relatively easy to learn to program the
Commodore 64 in BASIC, advanced programmers need
to know much more than how to use the fundamental
commands. This book explains all these details and sets
out a unique library of routines to add extra commands
to BASIC. 000 383088 8 £9.95

Your Commodore's man in I
the States, Burton Rubin, _ I
'attended the launch of the I
Amiga. Here's his report plust
I Brendin Lewis's impressions
l
Amigados.
US View
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS, WISPS OF
rumours, as insubstantial as smoke, have
appeared i n  v a r io u s  magaz ines
concerning t h e  fabled, long awaited,
Amiga computer. Originally called the
Lorraine, t he product o f  t h e  Amiga
Corporation, t h e  machine, a  3 2  b it
computer w it h  fabulous graphic and
sound capability, was to be the ultimate
home computer.
Silicon Valley, as we all know, is littered
with t h e  bones  o f  "ultimate home
computers". Timex-Sinclair, Texas Instru-
ments, Coleco, Mattel, and even the
mighty IBM have all seen their offereings
for the home market wither away to a
dusty death. When Jack Tramiel left
Commodore, there was some speculation
that his plan might be to purchase Amiga,
(and with it, the rights to the wonderous
Lorraine) and use the new machine as the
saviour of the almost moribund Atari. By
purchasing, Amiga, Commodore beat
Atari to the punch.

high speed graphics are
handled by one of these
chips.

S p e c i a l  F e a t u r e

Electronics show and its speciﬁcations
were impressive. The Motorola 68000 was
chosen for the central processing unit.
This is a 32 bit chip with a 16 bit bus.
Capable of addressing up to 16 megabytes
of memory, it is the same chip that powers
the Apple Macintosh. Tramiel's riposte
was the 13051 and 520ST, 32 bit machines
running GEM, The Commodore camp
responded with.. ,silence, Sure, there was
plenty on the sparkling, rational new 128,
and even pictures and publicity on the
new n o t e b o o k  c o m p u t e r .  B u t
Commodore breathed nary a word about
the Lorraine, and the rumours continued
to ﬂy.
At the ofﬁcial premier of the Amiga
computer, hosted (quite grandly) b y
Commodore a t  the Vivian Beaumont
theatre at Lincoln Centre, the rumours all
came true.
The speciﬁcations do not convey the
power of the machine. The standard con-
ﬁguration o f  t h e  Amiga includes a
Motorola 68000 microprocessor, running
at almost eight MHz, with 256K of RAM,
internally expandable to 512K. The speed
of this microprocessor is further abetted
by a proprietary three chip set which frees
the 68000 from routine graphic and I/O
tasks_
The Amiga is controlled by an 89 key
keyboard with numeric keypad, cursor
and special function keys, or a two button
mouse. It features a built in three and a
half inch disk drive (880K formatted), 80x
25 line text display, 640 x 400 resolution
and a palette of 4,096 colours (of which,
any 16 can be on the screen at one time in
high resolution mode). There are parallel,
serial, and second drive ports, two recon-
ﬁgurable joystick ports, as well as text to
voice and professional quality  f our
channel multi-voice music synthesis
capability. ABasiC, Amiga ODS, and
Amiga Tutor will be bundled with the
machine.
Software availability, the bane of all
new computer introductions, would
seem not to be a problem here. Thanks to
the Emulator -  a software option -  the
Amiga c a n r u n  I B M  P C  compatible
software packages like Lotus 1-2-3_ Word-
star, and D Base III, in either 3.5 or 5.25
inch disk format.
In addition, when introduced in Sept-
ember, the Amiga will have available
more than 20 programs including word
processing, accounting, productivity,
education, speech synthesis, telecom-
munications, paint, animation, a n d
graphic programs. Assembler, C, Pascal,
Logo, and Lisp will be available at the time
of introduction, as well as a very powerful
version of Microsoft Basic. Third party
publishers will have more than 20 games
available when the machine hits the
shelves. Arktronics has already completed
work on a videodisk interface.
The Amiga works through the now
familiar system of menus, windows, icons,
multitasking, a n d  a  mous e -  ﬁrs t
pioneered by Apple with the Lisa. Up to 50
windows can be open and running on the
Amiga, though this is obviously more than
anyone can manipulate without going
insane. The Intuition operating system,
working through a system of "gadgets"
makes windowing an easier and quicker
task than it is on the Macintosh, or with
the GEM operating system of the Atari.
The animation power of the machine is
almost beyond description. I t  should
open new vistas for anyone who needs
professional visual aids. Its value to the
small advertising agency, or  any small
business s h o u ld b e  inc alc ulable.
Combined with the phenomenal multi-
tasking capability, Amiga should be a
formidable weapon in the business wars.
With business applications ﬁrmly in
mind, Commodor e has  chosen t o
merchandise t h e  mac hine thr ough
specialist dealers. Long ago, Commodore
pulled the plug on computer stores, in
favour of mass market merchants.
The powers  a t  Commodor e a r e
reversing the decision that made them
such a commercial success and critical
failure. It remains to be seen just how
easily Commodore will be accepted by
the same computer stores which were
abandoned a few years ago.
At a  list price of $1295, the Amiga
represents excellent value. However, it's
unlikely to be found at the local K Mart.
My feeling is that acceptance in the
computer stores may come gradually, but
it will deﬁnitely come. The machine is
simply too good to be ignored. The $1295
price tag includes a healthy mark-up for
the dealers, and Commodore has signed
up 800 RCA service locations to provide
service support. With the advent of the
Amiga, Commodore has both Apple and
IBM lined up in its sights.
Thomas Rattigan, pr es ident o f
Commodore North America, is talking
tough. "Commodore" h e  says, " is  a
strong, lean, aggressive, organization",
and h e  intends t o  have t he Amiga
showcased in 10,000 outlets within a year
of its  introduction. H e feels that the
Amiga is a great leap forward (shades of
Sir Clives QLI).
Irving G o u ld ,  Chair man o f  t h e
company, sees the future of Commodore
in "sophisticated, high end systems", with
"excellent price/performance ratios" and
"a full, rich, product line". That doesn't
sound like the marketing philosophy that
we've all grown to know and love.
The Amiga, though, is  a  machine
capable of changing the philosophy of a
company. Where the trusty old 64 was a
Ford, and the Plus Four an Ethel, the
Amiga is a Ferrari. The ultimate decisions
will be made in the marketplace. Don't
bet against the Amiga.

 T h e UK Connection
Tucked away in the corner of a small
square in Bristol is the software house
Metacomco. What is Metacomco? It is the
company which has written Amigados,
the operating system f o r  t h e  n e w
Commodore Amiga. Metacomco is not a
large company - with a staff of 25 - but it
does have a good track record, working
on software for both the Sinclair QL and
the Atari 520ST.
Upon meeting a few of the staff it's
quite easy to see that the ﬁrm's success is
based o n three main factors -  sound
management, ex pertis e a n d ,  mos t
notably, enthusiasm. Even some members
of the senior management seem like small
children playing with a newtoy whenever
the Amiga is mentioned. Even this cynical
reporter was surprised at its performance.
Though, as ever I 'm still not totally
convinced, r es er v e ﬁnal judgement for
the full production model. Metacomco's
staff, on the other hand, have had the
word cynical totally erased from their
memories. It was difﬁcult for them to see
a market into which the Amiga would not
ﬁt.
The whole story really started about
three years ago when Amiga Inc. started
work on a new machine, In November
1984, Commodore took over Amiga and
thus the machine. Previous to this though,
Commodore had already approached
Metacomco concerning Tripos (which is
the framework around which Amigados is
built). From here, Metacomco has never
looked back and has written various bits
of software for the Amiga, including a
version of Basic.
Although, for most of the day it was
difﬁcult to stop our host talking, I did
ﬁnally get an ominous silence when I
broached the subject of Amiga II. The
only reply I did get was that, due to the
open technology o f  t he Amiga, the
Japanese would be the ﬁrst to produce an
Amiga look-a-like and that ideas were
already in  the pipeline for something
within the next 12 months.
Finally, my thanks to all at Metacomco
for a  v ery  enjoyable day , and f o r
providing what Commodore UK could
not (or would not), a look at the Amiga.

WHEN USING YOUR C M TO
develop Basic programs there
are times when it would be
useful t o  h a v e  a n o t h e r
machine set up close to hand in
order t o  r u n  s mall utility
programs, f o r  instance hex
conversion, address calcula-
tion, etc. In schools, two pupils
sharing one machine must be
working on the same program
unless a  v er y  dis c iplined
approach is used. Split 64 is my
attempt t o  s o lv e  t h e s e
problems without incurring
the cost of an extra machine.
Method
The pr ogr am s plits  Basic
memory into two areas of just
over 16K allowing the machine
to hold t w o  different Basic
programs at the same time.
Switching between areas is
achieved by holding down the
shift k ey  and pressing t h e
c ontrol k e y .  Ea c h  a r e a
maintains the screen informa-
tion from the last time you used
it. The variable contents also
remain intact. T he second
screen information is stored at
the t o p  o f  memory leaving
approximately 3 K  f r e e  f o r
things like centronics interface
software. The area from SC000
is also free for utilities.
In the initial start up of the
program, I  s et t h e  screen
colours up to the normal blue
for area (a) and green for area
(b). I f  these are not to your
liking then just change them
with the normal POKEs and the
colours you set will be stored
when switching between areas.
If while using this program,
run/stop restore is  pressed,
then as normal the screen will
reset t o  b l u e  a n d  c lear.
However, t h e  s hift c ontrol
70 s witc h will no longer work so to
re-start Split 64 without losing
your programs , t y p e  SYS
(35896) [return]. SYS (35840)
resets split 64 completely.

Entering the Program
To enter the program type in
the Basic loader program, then
SAVE it, Type RUN and the
screen should ﬂash, then clear
to the normal Basic start up
message. N o t e t h e  much
reduced free memory. Type in
a short Basic program and RUN
it. Stop the program, hold
down the shift key and press
control. The screen should
now change colour and have
the Basic start up message on it.
You are now in the second
area. LIST and there should be
no trace of the program you
typed in. Shift control should
take you back to the ﬁrst screen
and LIST w ill show your
program is still there. If you
wish to make a machine code
copy of split 64 then ﬁrst make
sure you are in program area (a)
before entering your machine
code monitor. The start address
is $8C00 and the end address
S8D52.
How i t  W o r k s  —
General
Split 64 takes advantage of the
fact that the C64 operating
system allows Basic to work
within a n y  f r e e  area o f
memory. T o  w ri t e  y o u r
programs in another area of
memory it is only necessary to
change the pointers used by
Basic in zero page, Change the
pointers back and any program
that was there before will still
be there. It is also possible to
change the area of memory
used by the screen but when
writing this program it  was
decided to store the second
screen along with the second
colour m a p  above Basic
memory. T h e shift control
switch is operated by a simple
interrupt wedge.
How i t  W o rk s
Machine Code
Initialise Routine
• • • • • • • • • •
This routine sets up area (a)
colours, memory start, memory
end, and variable pointers from
values ﬁxed in Table 1. It then
puts zero in the ﬁrst three
locations of Basic memory for
areas (a) and (b). It then calls
the swap routine, which stores
the current screen and loads
the contents of  the second
screen (rubbish at this time).
Having swapped screens the
Basic start up program is called
which clears the screen and
prints the start up message. This
procedure is then repeated for
area (a). Finally the wedge
routine address is inserted into
the IRQ  vector, the normal
vector address having been
saved, then back to basic.
Wedge Routine
The wedge routine is entered
on every IRQ. It ﬁrst checks
location $0280 to see if the
shift control keys are pressed. If
not it jumps to the normal IRQ
routine. If the keys are pressed,
it checks that the cursor is off
and that the computer is not in
RUN mode. When all three of
these conditions are satisﬁed it
calls the swap routine. After
swapping areas a large delay
loop i s  executed t o  avoid
multiple swaps. Control is
then passed to the normal IRQ
routine.
Swap Basic
This is the ﬁrst part of the swap
subroutine. A loop is used to
exchange the current screen,
border and character colours,
with the contents of Table 2,
The same loop is used t o
exchange the Basic pointers
IS2B-S381 again w it h  t h e
contents of Table 2. On start up
Table 2  contains t he ﬁxed
values for area (b).
Swap Screen
Once more a loop is employed
to exchange t h e  current
screen and colour map stored
above Basic memory. T h e
exchange is done eight bytes at
a time. Not the most elegant
way t o  swap four areas o f
memory but it was chosen to
cause minimum disruption to
the screen during the swap.

Graphic landscapes
The project
COMPUTER-GENERATED GRAPHICS
are increasingly ﬁnding their way into
ﬁlms. Among the most impressive and
realistic effects that have been seen are
the entirely artiﬁcial landscapes created
for some of the Star Wars ﬁlms- This
month's project involves the creation of
an artiﬁcial landscape of this kind.
Of course, far more sophisticated (and
ex pens iv e!) e q u i p m e n t  t h a n  a
CM is needed to display graphics of a
quality that is suitable for use in ﬁlms. But
as we shall see, it is not too difﬁcult to
write programs that produce the basic
effects, and the quality of the results is
surprisingly good.
The theory the provides the basis for
the creation of these landscapes is known
as fractal geometry. Without going too
deeply into the theory, the idea behind a
fractal curve is that it is not one or two-
dimensional, but has a dimension which is
a fraction. Curves of this kind describe, for
example, r ough surfaces, w it h  t h e
degree o f  roughness determining the
fraction giving the dimension o f  the
fractal curve. They also describe many
other naturally occurring curves, such as
coast lines and hillsides, and this is what
makes t hem eminently suitable f o r
simulating landscapes.
The project involves starting with a
triangle and, b y  means o f  a  simple
procedure d e r iv in g  f r o m  fr ac tal
geometry, sub-dividing it to give a graphic
display that resembles a mountain. The
further the sub-division process is carried
out, the more realistic the result will
appear.
The solution
The basic idea o f  the procedure for
creating t h e  mountain landscape i s
illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The ﬁrst
ﬁgure shows that taking a triangle, ﬁnding
the mid-points of its sides and joining
them giv es  f o u r  smaller triangles.
Repeating the process on each of the
smaller triangles gives a ﬁner triangular
mesh, and the more it is repeated, the
PROJECTS

P r o g r a m m i n g
ﬁner the triangular mesh becomes. But
the results o f  this procedure do not
resemble any  natural phenomenon,
simply because of their regularity. This is
not a property to be found in nature,
which is characterised by randomness.
We c an produce a n  element o f
randomness by perturbing the mid-point
of each side by a random amount the
variation of which is proportional to the
length o f  it s  s ide. T h e  left- hand
illustration in Figure 2 shows the result of
doing this and drawing the four smaller
triangles produced by one sub-division.
The right-hand illustration shows what
happens a f t e r  t w o  s ub-div is ions ,
demonstrating that none of the triangles
can be drawn until all the mid-points have
been f o u n d  a n d  t h e n  per tur bed.
Continuing this process w ill give an
increasingly mountain-like display. The
range of the perturbation for the mid-
point of each side or, if you like, the
degree of proportionately between the
range and t h e  length o f  t h e  side,
effectively determines the fractional
dimension of the ﬁnal result. Different
values for the range give quite different
appearances to the mountain landscapes.
This gives us the following form for a
graphics program to draw an artiﬁcial
mountain landscape. It should declare the
arrays to be used, and there will be
several, because we must store the points
for all the triangles in the ﬁnal display as
we cannot draw any of them until all their
positions have been computed. Then it
must read the co-ordinates of the corners
of the basic triangle, prepare the high-
resolution graphics screen, and carry out
the sub-division of each side to give the
points at the corners of the resulting
triangles. To begin with, we will ignore-
the perturbations of the mid-points that
introduce the randomness. This simpliﬁes
the program a little, gives results such as
those in Figure 1, but provides a program
which we can easily generalise to produce
results like those in Figure 2. Finally, when
the program has found the points for all
the triangles, it only remains to plot them.
The main program based o n  this
scheme is:
10 DIMX(48), 1

Here, the arrays are declared in line 10.
The data, which is at line 50 and gives the
positions of  the corners of the initial
triangle, is read by lines 20 to 40. Line 60
calls the now-familiar subroutine, starting
at line 500, for  preparing the high-
resolution graphics screen.
Lines 70 to 140 calculate and store the
positions of the corners of all the triangles
that result from the sub-dividing process.
The outer loop variable, N, determines
how many stages of sub-division occur. In
the program as presented, there are Iwo
stages, which are necessary to bring us to

this way, the program is ready to be
extended t o  create m o r e  detailed
graphics).
Line 90 calls a subroutine starting at
line 4000 to sub-divide the triangles that
are repeatedly passed t o  i t .  T his
subroutine places the x andy co-ordinates
of the corners of the triangle that is being
dealt with in the arrays S and T. Then it
calls the subroutine starting at line 5000 to
do the actual sub-division. After it has
done the dividing up, this subroutine
leaves the x and y co-ordinates of the
corners of the four triangles that result
from the sub-division in the arryas LI and
V, respectively. The contents of these
arrays are then transferred to the arrays XT
and YT. This gives us the subroutine as:
4000 FOR M=1 TO 3
4010 S( M ) =X( M +3
K-1))

The i n t e r f a c e  b e t w e e n  t h e
subroutines starting at 4000 and 5000 is
illustrated in Figure 3, showing how they
communicate by means of the arrays. The
top illustration shows what happens with
the initial sub-division. This does not
exactly make it clear that all the arrays are
needed, but the bottom illustration does
so by showing how the arrays are used for
the second sub-division.
Figure 4 shows how the x co-ordinates
of the corners of a triangle are named
during a sub-division as performed by the
subroutine starting at  line 5000. The
subroutine itself is:
5000 A - 1 . 5
5010 D 4 1 5
5020 8 = 0 . 5
5030 E = 0 . 5
5040 C = 0 . 5
5050 F = 0 . 5
5060 U(1)=S(1): U(4)=S(2): U(7)=S(3)
5070 V(1)=T(1); V(4)=T(2): V(7)=T(3)
5080 U(2)A: U(6)A: U(12)=A
5090 V(2)=D: V(6)=D: V(12)=D
5100 U(3)=8: U(8)=8: U(11)=8
5110 V(3)=E: V(8)=E: V(11)=E
5120 U(5)=C: U ( 9 ) :  U(10)
5130 V(5)=F: V(9)=F: V(10)=F
5140 RETURN
After this, lines 110 to 130 copy copy
the positions of the triangles fromXT and
YT to X and Y so that they will be available
for the next round of sub-dividing.
When the positions of all the triangles
have been found they are plotted by lines
150 to 200. Here the inner loop from line
160 to 180, controlled by ), passes the co-
ordinates of each triangle in turn to the
arrays S and T  so that the subroutine
starting at line 3000 can be called to plot
the triangle. The outer loop, controlled by
K, ensures that all the triangles are dealt
with.
The triangle-plotting routine simply
calls o u r  m u c h  us ed line-drawing
subroutine (which begins at line 2000)
three times. The line drawing routine
draws a line from (Xl, Y1) to (X2, Y2) and
this gives the triangle-plotting routine as:
3000 X1=S(3): Y1=T(3)
3010 FOR P=1 TO 3
3020 X2=S(P): Y2=T(P)
3030 GOSUB 2000: REM DRAW LINE
3040 X1=X2: Y1=Y2
3050 NEXT P
3060 RETURN
Apart f r o m  t h e  previously-used
routines, this gives the complete program
for creating the regular triangular mesh. It
is now a simple matter to perturb the
points at the corners of the triangles
randomly before the triangles are plotted,
so t h a t  w e  g e t  o u r  moutain. T he
perturbing can be done in the innermost
subroutine, the one starting at line 5000,
by adding to the co-ordinates a random
amount w i t h  a  v ar iation t h a t  i s
proportional to the length of the side
being bisected. F o r  simplicity, t h e
perturbation has been taken as a random
amount between +/- 0 . 1
line in the x-direction). This gives the
amended subroutine as:
5000 A 1 = ( S ( 1 ) - S ( 2 ) )
5010 8 1 = ( 5 ( 1 ) - 5 ( 3 ) )
5020 C 1 = ( S ( 2 ) - S ( 3 ) )
5030 A 0 . 5
5040 D 4 3 . 5
5050 8 3 . 5
5060 E = 0 . 5
5070 C = 0 . 5
5080 F 4 : 1 , 5
5090 U(1)=S(1): U(4)=S(2): U(7)=S(3)
5100 V(1)=T(1): V(4)=T(2): V(7)=T(3)
5110 U(2)A: U(6)A: U(12)=A

5130 U(3)=B: U(8)=B: U(11)=B
5140 V(3)=E: V(8)=E: V(11)=E
5150 U(5)=C: U ( 9 ) :  U(10)
5160 V(5)4: V(9)=: V(10)=F
5170 RETURN
The complete listing of the program to
create the artiﬁcial landscape is given as
Figure 5.
Further developments
The program can be extended to take the
sub-division pr oc es s  f u r t h e r ,  s o
producing a  more detailed landscape.
The program only needs a few numerical
changes for this which follow at once
from the number of triangles there will be
in the new arrangement. Don't forget to
change the dimensions of the arrays? The
way that the randomness is introduced
can be made much more general, and the
constant of proportionately for the range
of the perturbations can be changed. You
may like to experiment with this to see if
you c an characterise t he differences
between the types of landscapes that are
produced by signiﬁcantly different values
for t h e  constant o f  porportionality.
Remember that because the perturba-
tions are random, each rub of a program
gives a different picture, although one
that belongs to the same family.

Use the Crsr lir  key in the
normal way  ( in conjunction
with the Shift key) to locate the
character you wish to edit. Now
press 'E' and t he character

you will be able to experiment
with the character you have
selected.
Alternatively, as mentioned
in the Function List, you may
use functions 18 and 19 (Next

Transfer Set
To transfer a set of 64 characters
to another location, ﬁrst press
CTRL & 'T'. You should now see
the Character Set no. (fourth

Using the functions 'Set +'
and 'Set -', choose the set that
you want the original to be
transferred to.
Now press 'Return', t he
transfer will be completed and
normal operation restored.
Recall
Have y o u  e v e r  m a d e  a

'Recall' is for.
Every character you use is
automatically 'buffered' so that
in the event of you using the
functions excessively, pressing
'Recall' w i l l  r es tor e t h e

with t h e  various functions,
until you become familiar with
them. I hope you enjoy using it.

Mike Hart provides a couple
of handy plotting routines for
the Vic 20 and CM.
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, MANY
people must have experimented with
their machines to see if there is an easy
way to draw graphs or plots on the screen.
There are three ways in which this can be
done and I will call them low resolutiOn,
medium resolution and high resolution
respectively.
In low-resolution plotting, one merely
takes the screen as a grid and plot points
using asterisks o r  a  similar graphic
characters. In the case of a C64 this would
obviously be a grid of 40 x 25 giving 1000
potential plot points.
If one wished to use a high resolution
screen then on the C64 one would use bit-
mapped graphics whic h allows each
individual 'dot' o n  the screen t o  be
controlled. Using this mode will increase
the resolution quite dramatically to 320 x
200 which is  64000 addressable dots.
However using the C64 in this mode is
quite complicated and needs t o  b e
approached with a degree of caution. The
approach which I am going to adopt here
is o n e  that gives pleasant 'chunky'
graphics points and is half-way between
these two extremes and which, therefore,
I shall call medium-resolution graphics.
If y ou were t o  PRINT CHR$(161),
CHRS(188), CHRS(172) and CHR$(191) as a
brief experiment you would see that a
graphics character is generated which
consists of a quarter square either by itself
or in combination with another 'quarter-
square to make up a half square. There
are 14 of these combinations altogether
and together with space and reverse
space w e  hav e a  total o f  sixteen
permutations o f  'quar ter - s quar e'
graphics. This enables us t o  make a
resolution which is twice that o f  the
normal screen and therefore instead of
having 40 x 25 we can increase this to
80 x 50 giving us a resolution of 4000 plot
points.
Let us suppose that we wish to plot a
point at the bottom left hand corner of
the screen. The complicating factor that
we have to take into account is that there
might already be a graphics character
already occupying that position and we
would wish to preserve the point that it
represents. The trick here is to PEEK the
screen at that particular point, read the
value of the character at that point, look
up its value in a table of potential values
and then work out from the same table
the value of the new character to be
poked back onto the screen which both
plots the 'new' point and the value of the
existing point. If this is a little hard to
visualise then any of Raeto West's books
have an excellent explanation under the

Lines 1 - 1 0 9 0  r e p r e s e n t  a n
implementation o f  medium-resolution
graphics using BASIC only. This is fairly
slow but is speeded up somewhat by
making use of a machine code routine to
poke the colour RAM so that we are not
concerned with two POKEs for  every
point plotted. The program is given by
default for  the C M  but the changes
needed f o r  t h e  VIC's ar e REMmed
immediately after each of the affected
lines.
Lines 10-60 ar e concerned w it h
constructing a small 'look up" table.
Lines 100-140 read in  the machine
code for subsequent changes of colour
RAM.
The major routine is in lines 300-380
which computes a sine curve and then
plots it (on the ﬁrst of the) loops) and then
'unplots' it (on the second of the) loops).
The procedure for VIC owners is to
delete the following lines: 110,120,130,
320,350,380,1050. Now take the lines that
immediately follow these i.e. 111,121,131,
321,351,381,1051-1052 and remove the
REM portion of the statement that made
these lines inoperative in the C64 version.
You will also have to decide which version
of VIC expansion you are operating with.
as the screen shifts from $1E00 to $1000
just to make life confusing. Select either
line 1051 or 1052.
Line 380 having been deleted makes
the VIC version end in line 381.
Owners o f  t he C M  now  have a
machine code version of the above which
plots a Lissajous ﬁgure in the shape of a
butterﬂy. An illustration of this is also
given.
Lines 2000-2051 read the machine
code into the cassette buffer. Then you
are given a choice of background and pen
colours (12 for background and 0 for pen
colour i.e., black on light grey is my
personal favourite).
PLOT is deﬁned as 970 and this is the
entry point.
Notice the complicated formula in line
4010 which actually follows the rubric
SYS(PLOT) x,y,on/off, colour. The ﬁrst
computed value is obviously the x value
whilst the second computed value is they
value. For a 'plot' we would then have a 1
and for an 'unplot or  'erase' we would
have a O. Finally, we have the colour
intended for the plot. You can obviously
experiment with it as much as you like.
The origin is in the bottom left-hand
corner (SYS(PLOTI0,0,1,0 whils t t h e
opposite corner is SYS (PLOT)79,49,1,0).
Finally, lines 63000-63160 constitute a
screen dump. written in BASIC but more 9 3
than adequate.

Nick Hampshire reveals the
mysteries of the TED chip in
the C-16 and Plus/4.
THE GRAPHICS DISPLAY, SOUND GEN-
eration and internal clock/timers of the
C-16 and Plus/4 computers are controlled
by a single integrated circuit, the so-called
TED chip. This is a complex device, and,
unfortunately, rather difﬁcult to use.
An equally unfortunate circumstance
is that no information on the use of this
chip is provided in Commodore's manual.
This is presumably in the belief that the
graphics and sound commands supplied
in t he extended Basic are adequate.
However, most advanced programmers,
P r o g r a m m i n g
TED CHIP
especially those writing machine code
programs, will want direct access to the
registers of this device.
The TED chip is a rather strange device.
It is located in the middle of the kernal
ROM area and overlays this ROM so that
the R O M  area covered b y  TED is
inaccessible, In addition, the TED registers
are not grouped in one continuous area
of memory. We located TED registers in
the area VINO to VHF. The reason for
this is obscure and probably related to a
quirk in the chip's design.
In operation the TED chip is not unlike
the VIC and SID chips in the C64 and it is
worth studying one o f  the advanced
books on the 64 (for instance Advanced
Commodore 64 Graphics and Sound and
The Commodore 64 Kernal and Hardware
Revealed - both by Nick Hampshire).
The following t a b le s hows  t h e
locations i n  T ED w h ic h  w e  hav e
uncovered together with the function of
each register and the bits within each
location.

Wash is a handy disk utility supplied by
Clifford Hanger of Mann ingtree in Essex.
It lets you step through all the ﬁles on a
disk one by one using the space bar. You
can delete the current ﬁle by pressing S or
rename it with R. Even better, pressing V
lets you take a peek at what's in the ﬁle so
you can ﬁgure out what it is and then
scratch it if you don't need it.
The VIEW command works with all
ﬁles though i t  cuts out any  control
characters and replaces them with full
stops. Even so, you should be able to get a
good idea of what the ﬁle is. One problem
- after viewing a ﬁle, Wash sometimes
goes back to the title of the disk - just hit
space a few times to go round again. It just
goes to show -  you can write a useful
utility in Basic!
Oh No, Not Again...
Printing at a particular position on the
screen is  still the most talked about
subject in  C64 programming. Graham
Blighe o f  Eastleigh in  Hampshire has
pointed out that David Read's routine in
Your 64 issue 13 won't let you print on the
top line of the screen because you've got
an expensive
to POKE 214,Y-1 and then PRINT_ Oh yes-
! wondered when someone would spot
that!
Graham has a neat solution -  call the
routine in the kernal ROM which re-
calculates the cursor position_ The PRINT-
AT routine then becomes:
POKE 211,X:POKE 214,Y:5Y5 58732
Meanwhile, Asmat Ullah from Glasgow
has a  ﬁendishly clever machine code
solution. It's only 12 bytes of code so it
should be no trouble to include it in your
initialisation section. Once loaded, you
can print anywhere on the screen with:
SYS(828)X,Y;"MESSAGE"
Neat huh? Asmat does point out that
there's no error checking in the routine in
order to keep it short so you should make
sure that Xis less than or equal to 40 and Y
is less than or equal to 25. Even so, it has to
be the best yet. Unless, of course, you
know different...

Choosing the right computer
is a good start b u t  can you
ﬁnd the right software?
At SUPERSOFT we're very conscious of the
fact that people who spend several hundred
pounds on computer equipment are looking
to do rather more than play Space Invaders.
Financial planning is a rather grand name
for something you've been doing all your life
— making ends meet! Perhaps i f  M r
Micawber had used BUSICALC he would
have been able to balance the books a little
better.
For home, club or  small business use
BUSICALC 'should pay for itself in no time at
all, for larger companies we recommend
BUSICALC 3, one of the few really valuable
programs that you can learn to use in a day.
Although your Commodore 64 is a power-
ful musical instrument you need to be a
pretty good programmer to understand how
it all works. Unless, of course, you buy MUSIC
MASTER!
To use MUSIC MASTER requires no prior
musical knowledge, though in the hands of
an experienced musician it will prove an
invaluable tool. You don't need to know the
ﬁrst thing about programming either! MUSIC
MASTER is the musical equivalent of a word
processor, remembering the notes you play
and allowing you to replay and edit them as
you wi5h.
INTERDICTOR PILOT is a space ﬂight
simulator. Nowadays simulators are widely
used to train pilots and astronauts because —
to be frank — it's a lot cheaper (and safer)
than the real thing!
Imagine, if  you will, life in the 22nd
century: space travel is commonplace, and
on the outskirts of the galaxy the ﬁrst war
between civilizations is being fought. A short-
age of trained pilots has prompted the Feder-
ation to develop a computer simulation that
allows raw recruits to gain experience with-
out paying for their mistakes with their lives.
With the aid of your Commodore 64 you too
can learn to pilot the Interdictor Mk 3 craft.
But be warned — this is no game!

Other SUPERSOFT products include the
MIKRO ASSEMBLER cartridge, the only
assembler that's ideal for beginners yet pow-
erful enough for the professional (most of
our competitors use it!). The VICIREE cart-
ridge adds dozens of commands to Basic
including toolkit aids and disk commands; or
on disk there's MASTER 64, a really com-
prehensive package for  the keen prog-
rammer.
•
Of course, we do also publish 'games
programs, and with classics like STIX. (WINK
and KAMI-KAZE in our range we are one of
the market leaders. But we most enjoy
coming up with the sort of programs that are
going to be in use for months and years, not
hours and days — the sort of programs that
make you glad that you bought a computer —
and glad that you bought SUPERSOFT!
You won't ﬁnd SUPERSOFT products on
the shelves of your local supermarket. But
most specialist shops stock titles from our
extensive range (and are prepared to obtain
other programs to order). However you can
also buy direct by sending a cheque (pre-paid
orders are post free!), by calling at our
ofﬁces, or over the telephone using your
ACCESS card.
