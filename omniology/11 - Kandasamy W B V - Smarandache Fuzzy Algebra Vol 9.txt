The picture on the cover is a simple graphic illustration depicting the classical algebraic structures 
with single binary operations and their Smarandache analogues. The pictures on the left, composed of 
concentric circles, depicts the traditional conception of algebraic structures, and the pictures of the 
right, with their liberal intersections, describe Smarandache algebraic structures. In fact, 
Smarandache Algebra, like its predecessor, Fuzzy Algebra, arose from the need to define structures 
which were more compatible with the real world where the grey areas mattered. Lofti A Zadeh, the 
father of fuzzy sets, remarked that: "So, this whole thing started because of my perception at that time, 
that the world of classical mathematics – was a little too much of a black and white world, that the 
principle of the 'excluded middle' meant that every proposition must be either true or false. There was 
no allowance for the fact that classes do not have sharply defined boundaries." So, here is this book, 
which is an amalgamation of alternatives.

PREFACE 
 
In 1965, Lofti A. Zadeh introduced the notion of a fuzzy subset of a set as 
a method for representing uncertainty. It provoked, at first (and as 
expected), a strong negative reaction from some influential scientists and 
mathematicians—many of whom turned openly hostile. However, despite 
the controversy, the subject also attracted the attention of other 
mathematicians and in the following years, the field grew enormously, 
finding applications in areas as diverse as washing machines to 
handwriting recognition. In its trajectory of stupendous growth, it has also 
come to include the theory of fuzzy algebra and for the past five decades, 
several researchers have been working on concepts like fuzzy semigroup, 
fuzzy groups, fuzzy rings, fuzzy ideals, fuzzy semirings, fuzzy near-rings 
and so on.  
 
In this book, we study the subject of Smarandache Fuzzy Algebra. 
Originally, the revolutionary theory of Smarandache notions was born as a 
paradoxist movement that challenged the status quo of existing 
mathematics. The genesis of Smarandache Notions, a field founded by 
Florentine  Smarandache, is alike to that of Fuzzy Theory: both the fields 
imperatively questioned the dogmas of classical mathematics. 
 
Despite the fact that Fuzzy Algebra has been studied for over fifty years,  
there are only two books on fuzzy algebra. But both the books do not 
cover topics related to fuzzy semirings, fuzzy near-rings etc. so we have 
in this book, two parts: In Part 1 we have recalled all the definitions and 
properties of fuzzy algebra. In Part II we give Smarandache fuzzy 
algebraic notions. This is the first book in fuzzy algebra which covers the 
notions of fuzzy semirings and fuzzy near-rings though there are several 
papers on these two concepts.  
 
This book has seven chapters, which are divided into two parts. Part I 
contains the first chapter, and Part II encloses the remaining six chapters. 
In the first chapter, which is subdivided into twelve sections, we deal with 
eleven distinct fuzzy algebraic concepts and in the concluding section list 
the miscellaneous properties of fuzzy algebra. The eleven fuzzy algebraic 
concepts which we analyze are fuzzy sets, fuzzy subgroups, fuzzy sub-
bigroups, fuzzy rings, fuzzy birings, fuzzy fields, fuzzy semirings, fuzzy 
near-rings, fuzzy vector spaces, fuzzy semigroups and fuzzy half-
groupoids. The results used in these sections are extensive and we have 
succeeded in presenting new concepts defined by several researchers. In 
the second chapter we introduce the notion of Smarandache fuzzy 
semigroups and its properties and also study Smarandache fuzzy 
bisemigroups. In the third chapter, we define the notion of Smarandache 
fuzzy half-groupoids and their generalizations (Smarandache fuzzy 
groupoids and bigroupoids, Smarandache fuzzy loops and biloops).   
 
Chapter four deals with Smarandache fuzzy rings and Smarandache non-
associative fuzzy rings. This chapter includes Smarandache fuzzy vector 
spaces and Smarandache birings. The study of Smarandache fuzzy 

 
6
semirings and its generalizations comprises the fifth chapter. Likewise, in 
the sixth chapter we analyze Smarandache fuzzy near-rings and its 
generalizations. In these six chapters, we have succeeded in introducing 
around 664 concepts related to Smarandache fuzzy algebra. The reader is 
expected to be well-versed with a strong background in Algebra, Fuzzy 
Algebra and Smarandache algebraic notions. 
 
The final chapter in this book deals with the applications of Smarandache 
Fuzzy algebraic structures. I do not claim that I have exhausted all the 
possibilities of applications, all that I have done here is to put forth those 
concepts that clearly have relevant applications. When I informed my 
interest in writing this book, Dr. Minh Perez of the American Research 
Press, editor of the Smarandache Notions Journal, a close research 
associate and inspiration-provider par excellence, insisted, rather subtly, 
that I try to find applications for these Smarandache notions. I was 
worried a little bit about finding the right kind of applications to suit this 
book, and then I happened to come across an perceptive interview with 
the Father of Fuzzy Sets, Lofti. A. Zadeh. Emphasizing about the long time 
it takes for a new subject to secure its place in the spotlight, he says, 
"Now: Probabilistic computing. It is interesting that within Artificial 
Intelligence it is only within the past several years that it has become sort 
of accepted. Previous to that it was not accepted. There was an article in 
the New York Times about Bayesian things. It says this technology is 276 
years old. Another example that comes to mind is holography. Garbor 
came up with his first paper in 1946; I saw the paper. No applications 
until the laser was invented! It's only after laser was invented that 
holography became useful. And then he got the Nobel Prize. Sometimes it 
has to await certain things. …. So, sometimes it's a matter of some 
application that all of the sudden brings something to light. Sometimes it 
needs that kind of thing." Somewhere between those lines, I could find 
the hope that I had longed for. It made me attest to the fact that research 
is generally a legacy, and that our effort will subsequently stand up to 
speak for itself.  
Since I am generalizing now, and speaking of hope and resurrection and 
the legacy of effort, and also about movements that challenge the dogmas 
and the irrationality of tradition, I am also aware of how all of this 
resonates with the social aspects of our life.  
Thinking about society, about revolution and revolt, and about the 
crusades against domination and dogma, I dedicate this book to Periyar 
(Literally meaning, The Great Man), the icon of rationalism. He single-
handedly led the non-brahmins of South India, to a cultural, political and 
social awakening, freeing them from the cruel bonds of slavery that 
traditional brahminism foisted upon them. He was the first political leader 
in India to fight for the concepts of Self-Respect and Social Justice; and in 
terms of social reform, he stands unparalleled. His writings and speeches, 
which I read with the rigour that is expected of serious research, are now 
a permanent part of my personal faith. Periyar's ideology and political 
praxis have influenced me overwhelmingly, and his thought drives me to 
dissent and to dare.

Chapter One 
 
SOME RESULTS ON FUZZY ALGEBRA 
 
This chapter has twelve sections. First section we introduce the concept of fuzzy sets. 
As there are very few books on fuzzy algebra we have tried our level best to introduce 
all the possible definitions of fuzzy groups, fuzzy rings, fuzzy vector spaces, fuzzy 
near rings. Section two is devoted to the definition of fuzzy groups and some of its 
basic properties. Section three solely deals with the study and introduction of fuzzy 
sub-bigroup of a group. Fuzzy rings and its properties are introduced in section four. 
Section five introduces the notions of fuzzy birings. Study of fuzzy fields is carried 
out in section six. Study of fuzzy semirings and their generalizations are given in 
section seven. Section eight gives the properties of fuzzy near-rings and its properties. 
We describe the notions of fuzzy vector spaces and fuzzy bivector spaces in section 
nine. A brief study of fuzzy semigroups is carried out in the tenth section. The 
generalization of fuzzy half groupoids and its generalizations are given in section 
eleven. The final section, which is quite radical in nature gives the miscellaneous 
properties in fuzzy algebraic structures. 
 
 
1.1 Fuzzy Subsets 
 
In 1965 Zadeh [144] mathematically formulated the fuzzy subset concept. He defined 
fuzzy subset of a non-empty set as a collection of objects with grade of membership 
in a continuum, with each object being assigned a value between 0 and 1 by a 
membership function. Fuzzy set theory was guided by the assumption that classical 
sets were not natural, appropriate or useful notions in describing the real life 
problems, because every object encountered in this real physical world carries some 
degree of fuzziness. Further the concept of grade of membership is not a probabilistic 
concept. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.1: Let X be a non-empty set. A fuzzy set (subset) µ of the set X is a 
function µ: X → [0, 1]. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.2: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a set X. For t ∈ [0, 1], the set 
{
}t
)
x
(
X
x
X t
≥
∈
=

µ
is called a t-level subset of the fuzzy subset µ . 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.3: A fuzzy set of a set X is called a fuzzy point if and only if it takes 
the value 0 for all y ∈ X except one, say, x ∈ X. If its value at x is t, (0 < t ≤ 1) then we 
denote this fuzzy point by xt . 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.4: The complement of a fuzzy set µ of a set X is denoted by µc and 
defined as µc(x) = 1 - µ (x) for every x ∈ X. 
 
We mainly give definitions, which pertain to algebraic operations, or to be more 
precise we are not interested in discussing concepts topologically or analytically like 
continuity, connected, increasing function or decreasing function. Just we proceed on 
to define when are two functions disjoint and the concept of min max functions. 
 

 
10
DEFINITION 1.1.5: Two fuzzy subsets µ and λ of a set X are said to be disjoint if there 
exists no x ∈ X such that µ (x) = λ (x). 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.6: The union of two fuzzy sets λ and µ of a set X, denoted by λ ∪ µ is 
a fuzzy subset of the set X defined as (λ ∪ µ) (x) = max {λ (x), µ (x)} for every x ∈ X. 
The intersection of two fuzzy (subsets) sets λ and µ of a set X, written as λ ∩ µ, is a 
fuzzy subset of X defined as (λ ∩ µ) (x) = min {λ(x), µ (x)} for every x ∈ X. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.7: Let λ and µ be two fuzzy subsets of a set X. Then λ is said to be 
contained in µ, written as λ ⊆ µ if λ (x) ≤ µ (x) for every x ∈ X. If λ (x) = µ (x) for 
every x ∈ X then we say λ and µ are equal and write λ = µ. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.8: A fuzzy subset µ of a set X is said to normal if  
 
sup
X
x∈
µ (x) = 1. 
 
A fuzzy subset µ of a set X is said to be normalized if there exist x ∈ X such that µ (x) 
= 1. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.9:  Let f : X → Y be a function.  For  a  fuzzy  set  µ  in  Y,  we  define 
(f –1(µ)) (x) = µ (f(x) for every x ∈ X. 
 
For a fuzzy set λ in X, f(λ) is defined by  
 
(f(λ))(y) =

DEFINITION 1.1.10: Let X be any set. A fuzzy subset µ in the set X has the sup 
property if for any subset A of the set X there exists x0 ∈ A such that µ (x0) = sup 
{µ(x)  x ∈ A}. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.11: Let λ and µ be fuzzy subsets of the sets X and Y respectively. The 
cartesian product of λ and µ is defined as λ × µ: X × Y→ [0, 1] such that (λ × µ) (x, 
y) = min {λ(x), µ (y)} for every (x, y) ∈ X × Y. A fuzzy binary relation Rλ on a set X is 
defined as a fuzzy subset of X × X.  
 
The composition of two fuzzy relations Rλ and Rµ is defined by (Rλ o Rµ )(x, y) = 
sup
X
t∈
{min Rλ (x, t), Rµ (t, y)}, for every x, y ∈ X. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.12: Let Rλ be a fuzzy binary relation on a set X. A fuzzy subset µ of 
the set X is said to be a pre class of Rλ if min {µ (x), µ (y) } ≤ Rλ (x, y) for every x, y ∈ 
X. 
 

 
11
A fuzzy binary relation Rλ on a set X is said to be a similarity relation on the set X if it 
is reflexive, symmetric and transitive that is, for every x, y, z ∈ X. 
 
Rλ (x, x) = 1 
Rλ (x, y) = Rλ (y, x)  
min { Rλ (x, y), Rλ (y, z)} ≤ Rλ (x, z). 
 
Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a set X. If µ (x) = 0 for every x ∈ X then we call µ as empty 
fuzzy set and denote it by φX. If µ (x) = 1 for every x ∈ X then we call µ as whole fuzzy 
set and denote it by 1X. 
 
DEFINITION 1.1.13: A fuzzy binary relation S on X is said to be a similarity relation 
on X if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive i.e. 
 
S (x, x) = 1. 
S (x, y) = S (y, x). 
S (x, y) ∧ S (y, z) ≤ S (x, z) for all x, y, z in X.  
 
For more about fuzzy sets please refer [17, 26, 59, 144]. 
 
 
1.2 Groups and fuzzy subgroups 
 
Rosenfield [112] introduced the notion of fuzzy group and showed that many group 
theory results can be extended in an elementary manner to develop the theory of fuzzy 
group. The underlying logic of the theory of fuzzy group is to provide a strict fuzzy 
algebraic structure where level subset of a fuzzy group of a group G is a subgroup of 
the group. [14, 15] reduced fuzzy subgroup of a group using the general t-norm. 
However, [112] used the t-norm ‘min’ in his definition of fuzzy subgroup of a group. 
Fuzzy groups are further investigated by [32, 33] who mainly studied about the level 
subgroups of a fuzzy subgroup. [109] analyzed this level subgroups of a fuzzy 
subgroup in more detail and investigated whether the family of level subgroups of a 
fuzzy subgroup, determine the fuzzy subgroup uniquely or not. The concepts of fuzzy 
normal subgroup and fuzzy coset were introduced by [98]. For more about fuzzy 
groups please refer [2, 5, 14, 16, 30, 32, 55, 73, 83, 85, 86, 89, 93, 109, 112, 136, 137, 
138, 139].  
 
DEFINITION 1.2.1: Let G be a group. A fuzzy subset µ of a group G is called a fuzzy 
subgroup of the group G if 
 
i. 
µ(xy) ≥ min { µ (x) , µ (y)} for every x, y ∈ G and  
ii. 
µ(x–1) = µ (x) for every x ∈ G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.2: Let G be a group. A fuzzy subgroup A of G is called normal if A(x) 
= A(y–1 x y) for all x, y ∈ G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.3: Let A be a fuzzy subset of S. For t ∈ [0, 1] the set At = { s ∈ S / 
A(x) ≥ t} is called a level subset of the fuzzy subset A. 
 

 
12
In consequence of the level subset we have the following theorem: 
 
THEOREM 1.2.1: Let G be a group and A be a fuzzy subgroup of G. Then the level 
subsets At, for t ∈ [0, 1], t ≤ A (e) is a subgroup of G, where e is the identity of G. 
 
Proof: Direct, refer [16]. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.2: A fuzzy subset µ of a group G is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G if 
and only if µ (xy–1) ≥ min {µ (x) , µ (y)} for every x, y ∈ G. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as it is a direct consequence of the definition. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.3: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a group G. Then µ is a fuzzy subgroup of 
G if and only if 
t
Gµ  is a subgroup (called level subgroup) of the group G for every t ∈ 
[0, µ (e)], where e is the identity element of the group G. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.4: A fuzzy subgroup µ of a group G is called improper if µ is 
constant on the group G, otherwise µ is termed as proper. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.5: We can define a fuzzy subgroup µ of a group G to be fuzzy normal 
subgroup of a group G if µ (xy) = µ (yx) for every x, y ∈ G. This is just an equivalent 
formation of the normal fuzzy subgroup. Let µ be a fuzzy normal subgroup of a group 
G. For t ∈ [0, 1], the set µ t = {(x, y) ∈ G × G / µ (xy–1) ≥ t} is called the t-level 
relation of µ. For the fuzzy normal subgroup µ of G and for t ∈ [0, 1], µ t is a 
congruence relation on the group G. 
 
In view of all these the reader is expected to prove the following theorem: 
 
THEOREM 1.2.4: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and x ∈ G. Then µ (xy) = 
µ(y) for every y ∈ G if and only if µ (x) = µ (e). 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.6: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. For any a ∈ G, a µ 
defined by (a µ) x = µ (a–1x) for every x ∈ G is called the fuzzy coset of the group G 
determined by a and µ.  
 
The reader is expected to prove the following. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.5: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. Then x
t
Gµ  = 
t
x
G µ  for every 
x ∈ G and t ∈ [0, 1].  
 
We now define the order of the fuzzy subgroup µ of a group G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.7: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and H = {x ∈ G/ µ (x) = 
µ(e)} then o(µ), order of µ is defined as o(µ) = o(H). 
 

 
13
THEOREM 1.2.6: Any subgroup H of a group G can be realised as a level subgroup of 
some fuzzy subgroup of G.  
 
The proof is left as an exercise to the reader. Some of the characterization about 
standard groups in fuzzy terms are given. The proof of all these theorems are left for 
the reader to refer and obtain them on their own. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.7: G is a Dedekind group if and only if every fuzzy subgroup of G is 
normal.  
 
By a Dedekind group we mean a group, which is abelian or Hamiltonian. (A group G 
is Hamiltonian if every subgroup of G is normal) 
 
THEOREM 1.2.8: Let G be a cyclic group of prime order. Then there exists a fuzzy 
subgroup A of G such that A(e) = to and A (x) = t1  for all x ≠ e in G and to > t1. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.9: Let G be a finite group of order n and A be a fuzzy subgroup of G. 
Let Im (A) = {ti / A(x) = ti for some x ∈ G}. Then {
itA } are the only level subgroups of 
A.  
 
Now we give more properties about fuzzy subgroups of a cyclic group. 
 
THEOREM [16]: Let G be a group of prime power order. Then G is cyclic if and only 
if there exists a fuzzy subgroup A of G such that for x, y ∈ G,  
 
i. 
if A(x) = A(y) then 〈x〉 = 〈y〉. 
ii. 
if A (x) > A(y) then 〈x〉 ⊂ 〈y〉. 
 
THEOREM [16]: Let G be a group of square free order. Let A be a normal fuzzy 
subgroup of G. Then for x, y ∈ G,  
 
i. 
if o(x)  o (y) then A (y) ≤ A(x).  
ii. 
if o(x) = o (y) then A (y) = A(x). 
 
THEOREM [16]: Let G be a group of order p1, p2, … , pr where the pi’s are primes but 
not necessarily distinct. Then G is solvable if and only if there exists a fuzzy subgroup 
A of G such that 
r
1

t

t
A

,
A
,
A
K
are the only level subgroups of A, Im (A) = {t0, t1, … , 
tr}, t0 > t1 > … > tr and the level subgroups form a composition chain. 
 
THEOREM [16]: Suppose that G is a finite group and that G has a composition chain 
〈e〉 = A0 ⊂ A1 ⊂ …⊂ Ar = G where Ai / Ai–1 is cyclic of prime order, i =1, 2, … , r. 
Then there exists a composition chain of level subgroups of some fuzzy subgroup A of 
G and this composition chain is equivalent to 〈e〉 = A0 ⊂ A1 ⊂ … ⊂ Ar = G. 
 
The proof of these results can be had from [16].

DEFINITION [98]: Let λ and µ be two fuzzy subgroups of a group G. Then λ and µ are 
said to be conjugate fuzzy subgroups of G if for some g ∈ G, λ(x) = µ (g–1xg) for 
every x ∈ G. 
 
THEOREM [139]: If λ and µ are conjugate fuzzy subgroups of the group G then o(λ) 
= o(µ). 
 
Proof: Refer [139] for proof. 
 
Mukherjee and Bhattacharya [98] introduced fuzzy right coset and fuzzy left coset of 
a group G. Here we introduce the notion of fuzzy middle coset of a group G mainly to 
prove that o(α µ α–1) = o (µ) for any fuzzy subgroup µ of the group G and α ∈ G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.8: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. Then for any a, b ∈ G a 
fuzzy middle coset a µ b of the group G is defined by (a µ b) (x) = µ (a–1 x b–1) for 
every x ∈ G. 
 
The following example from [139] is interesting which explains the notion of fuzzy 
middle coset. 
 
Example 1.2.1: Let G = {1, –1, i, –i} be the group, with respect to the usual 
multiplication. 
 
Define µ: G → [0, 1] by

for all a = –1 and b = – i. 
 
Example 1.2.2: Consider the infinite group Z = {0, 1, –1, 2, –2, …} with respect to 
usual addition. Clearly 2Z is a proper subgroup of Z. 
 
Define µ: Z → [0, 1] by

It is easy to verify that µ is a fuzzy subgroup of the group Z. For any a ∈ 2Z and b ∈ 
2Z + 1 the fuzzy middle coset a µ b is given by

Hence it can be verified that this fuzzy middle coset aµb in not a fuzzy subgroup of Z.  
 
We have the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.10: If µ is a fuzzy subgroup of a group G then for any a ∈ G the fuzzy 
middle coset aµ a–1 of the group G is also a fuzzy subgroup of the group G. 
 
Proof: Refer [137]. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.11: Let µ be any fuzzy subgroup of a group G and a µ a–1 be a fuzzy 
middle coset of the group G then o (a µ a–1) = o(µ) for any a ∈ G. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and a ∈ G. By Theorem 1.2.10 the 
fuzzy middle coset aµa–1 is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G. Further by the definition 
of a fuzzy middle coset of the group G we have (a µ a–1) (x) = µ (a–1xa) for every x ∈ 
G. Hence for any a ∈ G, µ and aµa–1are conjugate fuzzy subgroups of the group G as 
there exists a ∈ G such that (aµa–1)(x) = µ(a–1xa) for every x ∈ G. By using earlier 
theorems which states o(aµa–1) = o(µ) for any a ∈ G.  
 
For the sake of simplicity and better understanding we give the following example. 
 
Example 1.2.3: Let G = S3 the symmetric group of degree 3 and p1, p2, p3 ∈ [0, 1] 
such that p1 ≥ p2 ≥ p3. 
 
Define µ : G → [0, 1] by

Clearly µ is a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and o(µ) = number of elements of the set 
{x ∈ G | µ (x) = µ(e)} = number of elements of the set {e} = 1. Now we can evaluate 
a µ a–1 for every a ∈ G as follows:  
 
For a = e we have a µ a–1 = µ. Hence o (a µ a–1) = o (µ) = 1.  
 
For a = (12) we have

Hence o(aµa–1) = 1. For the values of a = (13) and (132) we have aµa–1 to be equal 
which is given by

Hence o(aµa–1) = 1 for a = (13) and (132). Now for a = (23) and a = (123) we have 
aµa–1 to be equal which is given by

Thus o(aµa–1) = 1. Hence o(aµa–1) = o (µ) = 1 for any a ∈ G. 
 
From this example we see the functions µ and aµa–1 are not equal for some a ∈ G. 
Thus it is interesting to note that if µ is fuzzy subgroup of an abelian group G then the 
functions µ and aµa–1 are equal for any a ∈ G. However it is important and interesting 
to note that the converse of the statement is not true. That is if aµa–1 = µ for any a ∈ G 
can hold good even if G is not abelian. This is evident from the following example. 
 
Example 1.2.4: Let G = S3 be the symmetric group of degree 3 and p1, p2, p3 ∈ [0, 1] 
be such that p1 ≥ p2 ≥ p3. 
 
Define µ: G → [0, 1] by

Thus we have (aµa–1)(x) = µ(x) for every x ∈ G. Hence aµa–1 = µ for any a ∈ G. Thus 
the functions aµa–1 and µ are identical but G is not an abelian group. It is worthwhile 

 
17
to note that in general o(aµ) is not defined since aµ is not a fuzzy subgroup of the 
group G. The reader is advised to construct an example to prove the above claim. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.12: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a finite group G then o (µ) | o(G).

the definition of the order of the fuzzy subgroup of the group G we have o (µ)o(G).  
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.13: Let λ and µ be any two improper fuzzy subgroups of a group G. 
Then λ and µ are conjugate fuzzy subgroups of the group G if and only if λ = µ. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.9: Let λ and µ be two fuzzy subsets of a group G. We say that λ and µ 
are conjugate fuzzy subsets of the group G if for some g ∈ G we have λ(x) = µ (g–1xg) 
for every x ∈ G. 
 
We now give a relation about conjugate fuzzy subsets of a group G. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.14: Let λ and µ be two fuzzy subsets of an abelian group G. Then λ 
and µ are conjugate fuzzy subsets of the group G if and only if λ = µ . 
 
Proof: Let λ and µ be conjugate fuzzy subsets of group G then for some g ∈ G we 
have 
 
 λ(x)  = 
µ (g–1 xg) for every x ∈ G 
=  
µ (g–1 gx) for every x ∈G 
= 
µ(x) for every x ∈ G. 
 
Hence λ = µ. 
 
Conversely if λ = µ then for the identity element e of group G, we have λ(x) =       
µ(e–1xe) for every x ∈ G. Hence λ and µ are conjugate fuzzy subsets of the group G. 
 
The reader is requested to prove the following theorem as a matter of routine. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.15: Let λ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and µ be a fuzzy subset of 
the group G. If λ and µ. are conjugate fuzzy subsets of the group G then µ. is a fuzzy 
subgroup of the group G.  
 
The reader is requested verify if λ , µ : S3 → [0, 1] as

Now we proceed on to recall the notions of conjugate fuzzy relations of a group and 
the generalized conjugate fuzzy relations on a group. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.10: Let Rλ and Rµ be any two fuzzy relations on a group G. Then Rλ 
and Rµ are said to be conjugate fuzzy relations on a group G if there exists (g1, g2) ∈ 
G × G such that Rλ (x, y) =

and Rµ are said to be generalized conjugate fuzzy relations on the group G if there 
exists g ∈ G such that Rλ (x, y) = Rµ (g–1xg, g–1yg) for every (x, y) ∈ G × G. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.16: Let Rλ and Rµ be any two fuzzy relations on a group G. If Rλ and 
Rµ are generalized conjugate fuzzy relations on the group G then Rλ and Rµ are 
conjugate fuzzy relations on the group G. 
 
Proof: Let Rλ and Rµ be generalized conjugate fuzzy relations on the group G. Then 
there exists g ∈ G such that Rλ (x, y) = Rµ (g–1xg, g–1yg) for every (x, y) ∈ G ×G. 
Now choose g1 = g2 = g. Then for (g1, g2) ∈ G × G we have Rλ (x, y) =

 for every (x, y) ∈ G × G. Thus Rλ and Rµ are conjugate fuzzy 
relations on the group G.  
 
The reader can prove that the converse of the above theorem in general is not true. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.17: Let µ be a fuzzy normal subgroup of a group G. Then for any g ∈ 
G we have µ (gxg–1) = µ (g–1xg) for every x ∈ G. 
 
Proof: Straightforward and hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.18: Let λ and µ. be conjugate fuzzy subgroups of a group G. Then  
 
i. 
λ × µ. and µ × λ are conjugate fuzzy relations on the group G and 
ii. 
λ × µ. and µ × λ are generalized conjugate fuzzy relations on the group G 
only when at least one of λ or µ.is a fuzzy normal subgroup of G. 

 
19
 
Proof: The proof can be obtained as a matter of routine. The interested reader can 
refer [139].  
 
Now we obtain a condition for a fuzzy relation to be a similarity relation on G. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.19: Let Rλ be a similarity relation on a group G and Rµ be a fuzzy 
relation on the group G. If Rλ and Rµ are generalized conjugate fuzzy relations on the 
group G then Rµ is a similarity relation on the group G. 
 
Proof: Refer [139]. 
 
Now we define some properties on fuzzy symmetric groups. 
 
DEFINITION [55]: Let Sn denote the symmetric group on {1, 2, …, n}. Then we have 
the following: 
 
i. 
Let F (Sn) denote the set of all fuzzy subgroups of Sn. 
ii. 
Let f ∈ F (Sn) then Im f = {f(x) | x ∈ Sn}.  
iii. 
Let f, g ∈ F (Sn). If |Im (f)| < |Im (g)| then we write f < g. By this rule we 
define max F (Sn). 
iv. 
Let f be a fuzzy subgroup of Sn. If f = max F (Sn) then we say that f is a fuzzy 
symmetric subgroup of Sn. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.20: Let f be a fuzzy symmetric subgroup of the symmetric group S3 
then o(Im f) = 3. 
 
Proof: Please refer [139]. 
 
Here we introduce a new concept called co fuzzy symmetric group which is a 
generalization of the fuzzy symmetric group. 
 
DEFINITION [139]: Let G (Sn) = { g  g is a fuzzy subgroup of Sn and g (C (Π)) is a 
constant for every Π∈Sn} where C (Π) is the conjugacy class of Sn containing Π, 
which denotes the set of all y ∈ Sn such that y = x Π x–1 for x ∈ Sn. If g = max G(Sn) 
then we call g as co-fuzzy symmetric subgroup of Sn.  
 
For better understanding of the definition we illustrate it by the following example. 
 
Example 1.2.5: Let G = S3 be the symmetric group of degree 3. 
 
Define g: G → [0 1] as follows: 
 
g(x) =

where e is the identity element of S3. It can be easily verified that all level subsets of g 
are {e} {e, (123), (132)} and S3. All these level subsets are subgroups of S3, hence g 
is a fuzzy subgroup of S3. Further g (C(Π)) is constant for every Π∈S3 and o (Im (g)) 
≥ o (Im g (µ)) for every subgroup µ of the symmetric groupS3. Hence g is a co-fuzzy 
symmetric subgroup of S3.  
 
Now we proceed on to prove the following theorem using results of [55]. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.21: 
  
i. 
If g is a co-fuzzy symmetric subgroup of the symmetric group S3 then 
o(Im(g)) = 3. 
ii. 
If g is a co-fuzzy symmetric subgroup of S4 then o (Im (g)) = 4 and  
iii. 
If g is a co-fuzzy symmetric subgroup of Sn (n ≥ 5) then o (Im (g)) = 3. 
 
Proof: The proof follows verbatim from [55] when the definition of fuzzy symmetric 
group is replaced by the co-fuzzy symmetric group. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.22: Every co fuzzy symmetric subgroup of a symmetric group Sn is a 
fuzzy symmetric subgroup of the symmetric group Sn. 
 
Proof: Follows from the very definitions of fuzzy symmetric subgroup and co fuzzy 
symmetric subgroup. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.23: Every fuzzy symmetric subgroup of a symmetric group Sn need not 
in general be a co-fuzzy symmetric subgroup of Sn. 
 
Proof: By an example. Choose p1, p2, p3 ∈ [0, 1] such that 1 ≥ p1 ≥ p2 ≥ p3 ≥ 0. 
 
Define f : S3 → [0 1] by 
 
f(x) =

It can be easily checked that f is a fuzzy subgroup of S3 as all the level subsets of f are 
subgroups of S3. Further o(Im (f)) = 3 ≥ o(Im (µ)) for every fuzzy subgroup µ of the 
symmetric group S3. Hence f is a fuzzy symmetric subgroup of S3 but f(12) ≠ f(13) in 
this example. By the definition of co fuzzy symmetric subgroup it is clear that f is not 
a co fuzzy symmetric subgroup of S3. Hence the claim.  
 
Now we proceed on to recall yet a new notion called pseudo fuzzy cosets and pseudo 
fuzzy double cosets of a fuzzy subset or a fuzzy subgroup. [98] has defined fuzzy 
coset as follows: 
 
DEFINITION [98]: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. For any a ∈ G, a µ defined 
by (a µ) (x) = µ(a–1x) for every x ∈ G is called a fuzzy coset of µ.  
 

 
21
One of the major marked difference between the cosets in fuzzy subgroup and a group 
is "any two fuzzy cosets of a fuzzy subgroup µ of a group G are either identical or 
disjoint" is not true.  
 
This is established by the following example: 
 
Example 1.2.6: Let G = { ±1, ± i }be the group with respect to multiplication. 
 
Define µ: G → [0, 1] as follows: 
µ(x) =

It is easy to see that these fuzzy cosets iµ and –iµ are neither identical nor disjoint. 
For (iµ)(i) ≠ (–iµ) (i) implies iµ and –iµ are not identical and (iµ)(1) = (–iµ)(1) 
implies iµ and –iµ are not disjoint. Hence the claim. 
 
Now we proceed on to recall the notion of pseudo fuzzy coset. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.12: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and a ∈ G. Then the 
pseudo fuzzy coset (aµ)P is defined by ((aµ)P) (x) = p(a) µ (x) for every x ∈ G and for 
some p ∈ P.  
 
Example 1.2.7: Let G = {1, ω, ω2} be a group with respect to multiplication, where ω 
denotes the cube root of unity. Define µ: G → [0, 1] by  
 
µ(x) =

It is easily checked the pseudo fuzzy coset (aµ)P for p(x) = 0.2 for every x ∈ G to be 
equal to 0.12 if x = 1 and 0.08 if x = ω, ω2.  
 
We define positive fuzzy subgroup. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.13: A fuzzy subgroup µ of a group G is said to be a positive fuzzy 
subgroup of G if µ is a positive fuzzy subset of the group G. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.24: Let µ be a positive fuzzy subgroup of a group G then any two 
pseudo fuzzy cosets of µ are either identical or disjoint. 
 
Proof: Refer [137]. As the proof is lengthy and as the main motivation of the book is 
to introduce Smarandache fuzzy concepts we expect the reader to be well versed in 
fuzzy algebra, we request the reader to supply the proof.  
 
Now we prove the following interesting theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.25: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G then the pseudo fuzzy coset 
(aµ)Pis a fuzzy subgroup of the group G for every a ∈ G. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. For every x, y in G we have 
 
 (aµ)P(xy–1)  
= 
p(a) µ (xy–1) 
≥  
p(a) min {µ(x), µ(y)} 
=  
min {p(a) µ(x), p(a), µ(y)} 
=  
min {(aµ)P (x), (aµ)P (y)}. 
 
That is (aµ)P (xy–1) ≥ min {(aµ)P (x), (aµ)P (y) } for every x, y ∈ G. This proves that 
(aµ)P is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G. We illustrate this by the following example: 
 
Example 1.2.8: Let G be the Klein four group. Then G = {e, a, b, ab} where a2 = e = 
b2, ab = ba and e the identity element of G. 
 
Define µ: G → [0, 1] as follows

It is easy to check that all the above pseudo fuzzy cosets of µ are fuzzy subgroups of 
G. As there is no book on fuzzy algebraic theory dealing with all these concepts we 
have felt it essential to give proofs and examples atleast in few cases.

THEOREM 1.2.27: A fuzzy subgroup µ of a group G is normalized if and only if µ (e) 
= 1, where e is the identity element of the group G. 

 
24
 
Proof: If µ is normalized then there exists x ∈ G such that µ(x) = 1, but by properties 
of a fuzzy subgroup µ of the group G, µ(x) ≤ µ(e) for every x ∈ G. Since µ(x) = 1 and 
µ(e) ≥ µ(x) we have µ(e) ≥1. But µ(e) ≤ 1. Hence µ(e) = 1. Conversely if µ(e) = 1 
then by the very definition of normalized fuzzy subset µ is normalized. 
 
The proof of the following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader, which can be 
proved as a matter of routine. The only notion which we use in the theorem is the 
notion of pre class of a fuzzy binary relation Rµ . Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group 
G. Now we know that a fuzzy subset µ of a set X is said to be a pre class of a fuzzy 
binary relation Rµ on the set X if min {µ (x), µ (y)} ≤ Rµ (x, y) for every x, y ∈ X. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.28: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and Rµ : G × G → [0 1] be 
given by Rµ (x, y) = µ (xy–1) for every x, y ∈ G. Then 
 
i. 
Rµ is a similarity relation on the group G only when µ is normalized and 
ii. 
µ is a pre class of Rµ and in general the pseudo fuzzy coset (a µ)P is a pre 
class of Rµ for any a ∈ G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.14: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a non-empty set X and a ∈ X. We define 
the pseudo fuzzy coset (aµ)P for some p ∈P by (aµ)P (x) = p(a) µ(x) for every x ∈ X. 
 
Example 1.2.9: Let X = {1, 2, 3, …, n} and µ: X →[0, 1] is defined by µ(x) = x
1  for 
every x ∈ X. Then the pseudo fuzzy coset (αµ)P: X → [0, 1] is computed in the 
following manner by taking p(x) = 
x
2
1 for every x ∈ X; (αµ)P (x) = 
2
x
2
1
 for every x 
∈ X. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.29: Let λ and µ be any two fuzzy subsets of a set X. Then for a ∈ X 
(aµ)P ⊂ (aλ)P if and only if µ ⊆ λ. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the fuzzy partition of a fuzzy subset. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.15: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a set X. Then Σ = {λ: λ is a fuzzy subset 
of a set X and λ ⊆ µ} is said to be a fuzzy partition of µ if  
 
i.

 and 
ii. 
any two members of Σ are either identical or disjoint 
 
However we illustrate by an example.

given by { }

The following theorem is yet another piece of result on pre class

THEOREM 1.2.31: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G and Rµ : G × G → [0, 1] be 
given by Rµ (x, y) = µ (xy–1) for every x, y ∈ G. If λ is a fuzzy subset of the group G 
such that λ ⊆ µ then (aλ)P is pre class of Rµ for any a ∈ G . 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G, a ∈ G and λ be a fuzzy subset of the 
group G such that λ ⊆ µ. 
 
For x, y ∈ G we have  
 
 min {((aλ)p)(x), ((aλ)p)y}  
= 
 min { p(a) λ(x), p(a) λ(y)} 
≤  
min {p(a) µ(x), p(a) µ(y)}(since λ ⊆ µ.) 
=  
p(a) min {µ(x), µ(y)} 
≤  
1 y µ (xy–1) (since p(a) ≤ 1) 
=  
Rµ (x, y). 
 
That is min {((aλ)p)(x), ((aλ)p)y} ≤ Rµ (x, y) for every x, y ∈ G. Hence (a λ)P is a pre 
class of Rµ for any a ∈ G.  
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of pseudo fuzzy double cosets. 
 
DEFINITION 1.2.16: Let µ and λ be any two fuzzy subsets of a set X and p ∈ P. The 
pseudo fuzzy double coset (µxλ)p is defined by (µ xλ)p
 = (xµ)P ∩ (xλ )P for x ∈ X. 
 
We illustrate this concept by the following example: 
 
Example 1.2.11: Let X = {1, 2, 3} be a set. Take λ and µ to be any two fuzzy subsets 
of X given by λ (1) = 0.2, λ(2) = 0.8, λ(3) = 0.4. µ(1) = 0.5 µ(2) = 0.6 and µ (3) = 0.7. 
Then for a positive fuzzy subset p such that p(1) = p(2) = p(3) = 0.1, we calculate the 
pseudo fuzzy double coset (µ x λ)P and this is given below.

The following theorem is left to the reader as the proof can be obtained by a routine

THEOREM 1.2.32: Let λ and µ be any two positive fuzzy subsets of a set X and p ∈ P. 
The set of all pseudo fuzzy double cosets {(µxλ)P| x ∈ X} is a fuzzy partition of (µ ∩ 
λ) if and only if p is normal. 
 
It can be easily verified that the intersection of any two similarity relations on a set X 
is a similarity relation on the set X and on the contrary the union of similarity 
relations and composition of similarity relations need not in general be similarity 
relations. 
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader to prove.

In this section we study the concept of fuzzy subgroup using the definition of [70]. 
 
DEFINITION [70]: Let G be a group and e denote the identity element of the group G. 
A fuzzy subset µ of the group G is called a fuzzy subgroup of group G if 
 
i. 
µ(xy–1) ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)} for every x, y ∈ G and 
ii. 
µ(e) = 1.  

 
28
 
Using the results of [70] we give some of the classical results. 
 
DEFINITION [70]: Let µ be a fuzzy normal subgroup of a group G and µt be a t-level 
congruence relation of µ on G. Let A be a non-empty subset of the group G. The 
congruence class of µt containing the element x of the group G is denoted by [x]µ . 
 
The set 
)
A
(
t
µ
 = {x ∈ G  [x]µ ⊆ A} and 
tµ (A) = {x ∈ G  [x]µ ∩ A ≠ φ} are called 
respectively the lower and upper approximations of the set A with respect to µt .  
 
We give some simple proofs to the results of [70] using the notions of t-level relation 
and the coset. 
 
THEOREM (EXISTENCE THEOREM): Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. The 
congruence class [x]µ of µt containing the element x of the group G exist only when µ 
is a fuzzy normal subgroup of the group G. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. [70] has proved that if µ is a fuzzy 
normal subgroup of a group G then the t-level relation µt of µ is a congruence relation 
on the group G and hence the congruence class [x]µ of µt containing the element x of 
the group G exist. 
 
Now we prove that for the existence of the congruence class [x]µ we must have the 
fuzzy subgroup µ of the group G to be fuzzy normal subgroup of group G. That is if µ 
is not a fuzzy normal subgroup of the group G then the congruence class [x]µ of µt 
containing the element x of the group G does not exist. 
 
To prove this, consider the alternating group A4. 
 
Choose p1, p2, p3 ∈ [0, 1] such that 1 > p1 > p2 > p3 ≥ 0. 
 
Define µ : A4 → [0, 1] by 
 
µ(x)  =

where e is the identity element of A4.  
 
The t-level subsets of µ are given by {e}, {e, (1 2) (3 4)}, {e, (1 2) (3 4), (1 3) (2 4), 
(1 4) (2 3)} and A4. All these t-level subsets are subgroups of the alternating group 
A4. Hence µ is a fuzzy subgroup of the alternating group A4. For x = (123) and y = 
(143), µ(xy) = µ((123) (143)) = µ ((1 2) (3 4)) = p1 and µ(yx) = µ ((1 4 3) (1 2 3)) = 
µ((1 4)(2 3)) = p2. As p1 > p2, µ (xy) ≠ µ(yx) for x = (1 2 3) and y = (1 4 3). Hence µ 
is not a fuzzy normal subgroup of A4. Let x = (1 4) (2 3) and y = (1 3) (2 4) then for t 
= p1, µ(xy–1) = p1 = t. 

 
29
 
Thus by the definition of t-level relation of µ we have (x, y) ∈µt. Further we note that 
for a = (1 2 3), µ ((ax)(ay)–1) = p2 < p1. So by the definition of t-level relation of µ we 
have (ax, ay) ∉ µt for t = p1 and α = (1 2 3). Hence it follows that µt is not a 
congruence relation on the alternating group A4. So by the definition of congruence 
class, [x]µ does not exist. That is if µ is not a fuzzy normal subgroup of the group G 
then the congruence class [x]µ of µt containing the element x of the group G does not 
exist. 
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.35: Let µ be a fuzzy normal subgroup of a group G and t ∈ [0, 1]. 
Then for every x ∈ G, [x]µ = x
t
Gµ  and 
t
Gµ  is a normal subgroup of the group G. 
 
This theorem is however illustrated by the following example: 
 
Example 1.2.13: Consider the Klein four group G = {a, b a2 = b2 = (ab)2 = e} where 
e is the identity element of G.  
 
Define µ : G → [0, 1] by

Clearly all the t-level subsets of µ are normal subgroups of the group G. So µ is a 
fuzzy normal subgroup of the group G. For t = 0.5 we calculate the following 
 
[x]µ = {e, a} for all values of x = e and x = a 
[x]µ = {b, ab} for all values of x = b and x = ab 
 
x
t
Gµ  = {e, a } for values of x = e and x = a and 
 
x
t
Gµ  = {b, a b} for the values of x = b and x = ab. This verifies that [x]µ = x
t
Gµ  for 
every x ∈ G.  
 
The following result is also left for the reader to prove.

For any two fuzzy subsets σ and µ of S; the cartesian product of µ and σ is defined by 
(µ × σ) (x, y) = min (µ (x), σ (y)) for all x, y ∈ S. 
 
Let σ be a fuzzy subset of S. Then the strongest fuzzy relation on σ is µσ defined by      
µ σ (x, y) = (σ × σ) (x, y) = min (σ (x), σ(y)) for all x, y, ∈ S. 
 
The following theorem can be easily verified. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.42: Let µ and σ be fuzzy subsets of S. Then 
 
i.

ii.

The natural question would be when we have the strongest fuzzy relation can we ever 
have the weakest fuzzy subset of S; the answer is yes and it is defined as follows: 
 
If µ is a fuzzy relation on S, then the weakest fuzzy subset of S on which µ is a fuzzy 
relation is σµ , defined by

{x  xt ∈ ξ} and ξt = At ∩ ξ∗  for all t ∈ (0, A(0)]. 
 
THEOREM 1.2.43: ξ is independent in A if and only if the fuzzy subgroup of G

Proof: Left for the reader to prove as an exercise. 
 
Now in the next section we introduce the concept of fuzzy bigroup which is very new 
and an interesting one. 
 
 
1.3 Fuzzy sub-bigroup of a group 
 
In this section we define fuzzy sub-bigroup of a bigroup [89, 135]. To define the 
notion of fuzzy sub-bigroup of a bigroup we define a new notion called the fuzzy 
union of any two fuzzy subsets of two distinct sets. 
 
DEFINITION [89, 135]: Let µ1 be a fuzzy subset of a set X1 and µ2 be a fuzzy subset of 
a set X2, then the fuzzy union of the fuzzy sets µ1 and µ2 is defined as a function. 
 
µ1 ∪ µ2: X1 ∪ X2 →[0, 1] given by 
 
(µ1 ∪ µ2) (x)  =

Now we proceed on to define fuzzy sub-bigroup of a bigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 1.3.1: Let G = (G1 ∪ G2, +, y) be a bigroup. Then µ: G → [0, 1] is said 
to be a fuzzy sub-bigroup of the bigroup G if there exists two fuzzy subsets µ1 (of G1) 
and µ2 (of G2) such that  
 
i. (µ1, +) is a fuzzy subgroup of (G1, +)  
ii. (µ2, y) is a fuzzy subgroup of (G2, y) and  
iii. µ = µ1 ∪ µ2.  
 
We illustrate this by the following example 
 
Example 1.3.2: Consider the bigroup G = {±i, ±0, ±1, ±2, ±3, …} under the binary 
operation ‘+’ and ‘y’ where G1 = {0, ±1, ±2, …} and G2 = {±1, ±i}.

That is, there exists two fuzzy subgroups µ1 of G1 and µ2 of G2 such that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2.  
 
Now we prove the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.3.1: Every t-level subset of a fuzzy sub-bigroup µ of a bigroup G need 
not in general be a sub-bigroup of the bigroup G. 
 
Proof: The proof is by an example. Take G = {–1, 0, 1} to be a bigroup under the 
binary operations ‘+’ and ‘y’ where G1 = {0} and G2 = {–1, 1} are groups respectively 
with respect to usual addition and usual multiplication.  
 
Define µ: G → [0, 1] by

We define fuzzy sub-bigroup of a bigroup, to define this concept we introduce the 
notion of bilevel subset of a fuzzy sub-bigroup.

DEFINITION 1.3.2: Let (G = G1 ∪ G2, +, y) be a bigroup and µ = (µ1 ∪ µ2) be a fuzzy 
sub-bigroup of the bigroup G. The bilevel subset of the fuzzy sub-bigroup µ of the 
bigroup G is defined as

element of the group (G2, y). 
 
Remark: The condition t ∈ [0, min {µ1 (e1), µ2 (e2)}] is essential for the bilevel 
subset to be a sub-bigroup for if t ∉ [0, min {µ1 (e1), µ2 (e2)}] then the bilevel subset 
need not in general be a sub-bigroup of the bigroup G, which is evident from the 
following example:

THEOREM 1.3.2: Every bilevel subset of a fuzzy sub-bigroup µ of a bigroup G is a 
sub-bigroup of the bigroup G. 
 
Proof: Let µ (= µ1 ∪ µ2) be the fuzzy subgroup of a bigroup (G = G1 ∪ G2, +, y). 
Consider the bilevel subset 
t
Gµ  of the fuzzy sub-bigroup µ for every t ∈ [0, 
min{µ1(e1), µ2(e2)}] where e1 and e2 denote the identity elements of the groups G1 and 
G2 respectively. Then

µ is a

Hence by the definition of sub-bigroup 
t
Gµ is a sub-bigroup of the bigroup (G, +, y). 
However to make the theorem explicit we illustrate by the following example. 
 
Example 1.3.4: G = {0, ±1, ± i} is a bigroup with respect to addition modulo 2 and 
multiplication. Clearly G1 = {0, 1} and G2 = {±1, ±i} are group with respect to 
addition modulo 2 and multiplication respectively.

such that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. Here by the term fuzzy subgroup λ of µ we mean that λ is a 
fuzzy subgroup of the group G and λ ⊆ µ (where µ is also a fuzzy subgroup of G).  
 
We illustrate the definition by the following example:

The following theorem relates the fuzzy sub-bigroup and the level subset. 
 
THEOREM 1.3.3: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy sub-bigroup of a group G, where µ1 and 
µ2 are fuzzy subgroups of the group G. For t ∈ [0, min {µ1 (e), µ2 (e)}], the level

This implies that there exists fuzzy subgroups µ1 and µ2 of the group G1 such that µ = 
µ1 ∪ µ2. Let 
t
Gµ be the level subset of µ, then we have  
 
x ∈

 µ (x) ≥ t

Now in the following theorem we give the condition for two fuzzy subgroups µ1 and 
µ2 of a fuzzy subgroup µ (µ1 ≠ µ and µ2 ≠ µ) to be such that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
THEOREM 1.3.4: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G with 3 ≤ o (Im (µ) < ∞ then 
there exists two fuzzy subgroups µ1 and µ2 of µ (µ1 ≠ µ and µ2 ≠ µ) such that µ = µ1 ∪ 
µ2. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of a group G. Suppose Im (µ) = {a1, a2, …, an} 
where 3 ≤ n < ∞ and a1 > a2 > … > an. Choose b1, b2 ∈ [0, 1] be such that a1 > b1 > a2 
> b2 > a3 > b3 > … > an and define µ1, µ2: G → [0, 1] by

Thus it can be easily verified that both µ1 and µ2 are fuzzy subgroups of µ.  
Further µ1 ≠ µ, µ2 ≠ µ and µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
Clearly the condition 3 ≤ o(Im(µ) < ∞ cannot be dropped in the above theorem. This 
is explained by the following example. 
 
Example 1.3.7: Consider the group G = {1, –1, i, – i} under the usual multiplication. 
Define µ : G → [0, 1] by 
 
µ (x) =

Then it is easy to verify that µ is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G as all of its level 
subsets are subgroups of G. Further o (Im(µ)) = 2. If µK is a fuzzy subgroup of µ such 
that µK ⊆ µ (µK ≠µ) then µK takes the following form: 
 
µK(x) =

with 0 ≤ αK < 1 for every K in the index set I. It is easy to verify that 
µ

µ
K
j
 for 
any j, K ∈ I. Thus there does not exist two fuzzy subgroups µ1 and µ2 of µ (µ1 ≠ µ and 
µ2 ≠ µ) such that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2.  
 
Now we prove a very interesting theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.3.5: Every fuzzy sub-bigroup of a group G is a fuzzy subgroup of the 
group G but not conversely. 
 
Proof: It follows from the definition of the fuzzy sub-bigroup of a group G that every 
sub-bigroup of a group G is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G. 
 
However the converse of this theorem is not true. It is easy to see from example 1.3.7 
that µ is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G and there does not exist two fuzzy 
subgroups µ1 and µ2 of µ (µ1 ≠ µ and µ2 ≠ µ) such that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2.That is µ is not a 
fuzzy sub-bigroup of the group G. Now we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition 
for a fuzzy subgroup to be a fuzzy sub-bigroup of G.  
 
THEOREM 1.3.6: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a group G with 3 ≤  o(Im(µ)) < ∞. Then µ 
is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G if and only if µ is a fuzzy sub-bigroup of G.  
 

 
39
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup of the group G with 3 ≤ o(Im (µ)) < ∞ then there 
exists two fuzzy subgroups µ1 and µ2 of µ (µ1 ≠ µ and µ2 ≠ µ) such that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
Hence µ is a fuzzy sub-bigroup of the group G. Conversely, let µ be a fuzzy sub-
bigroup of a group G, we know every fuzzy sub-bigroup of a group G is a fuzzy 
subgroup of the group G.  
 
We shall illustrate this theorem by example. 
 
Example 1.3.8: Define µ: G → [0, 1] where G = {1, –1, i, –i} by

The specialty about this section is that we have given examples to illustrate the 
theorem; this is mainly done to make one understand the concepts. As there are no 
books on bigroups and to the best of my knowledge the concept on fuzzy bigroups 
appeared in the year 2002 [135]. 
 
 
1.4 Fuzzy Rings and its properties 
 
In this section we recall the concept of fuzzy rings and some of its basic properties. In 
1971 [112, 145] introduced fuzzy sets in the realm of group theory and formulated the 
concept of a fuzzy subgroup of a group. Since then many researchers are engaged in 
extending the concept / results of abstract algebra to the broader frame work in fuzzy 
setting. However not all results on groups and rings can be fuzzified. 
 
In 1982 [73] defined and studied fuzzy subrings as well as fuzzy ideals. Subsequently 
among [148, 149] fuzzified certain standard concepts on rings and ideals. Here we 
just recall some of the results on fuzzy rings and leave it for the reader to prove or get 
the proof of the results by referring the papers in the references. Now we recall 
definitions as given by [37].

DEFINITION [145]: Let µ be any fuzzy subset of a set S and let t ∈ [0, 1]. The set {s ∈ 
S | µ(x) ≥ t} is called a level subset of µ and is symbolized by µt. Clearly µt ⊆ µs 
whenever t > s. 
 
DEFINITION [140]: Let ‘y’ be a binary composition in a set S and µ, σ be any two 
fuzzy subsets of S. The product µσ  of µ and σ is defined as follows:

DEFINITION [140]: A fuzzy subset µ of a ring R is called a fuzzy subring of R if for all 
x, y ∈ R the following requirements are met  
 
i. 
µ (x – y) ≥ min (µ(x), µ(y)) and 
ii. 
µ (xy) ≥ min (µ(x), µ(y)) 
 
Now if the condition (ii) is replaced by µ(xy) ≥ max (µ(x), µ(y)) then µ is called a 
fuzzy ideal of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.1: Let µ be any fuzzy subring / fuzzy ideal of a ring R. If, for some x, y 
∈ R, µ(x) < µ(y), then µ(x – y) = µ(x) = µ(y – x). 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition of fuzzy subring / fuzzy ideal of a ring R. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of level subring/ level ideal of µ, a fuzzy 
subring or fuzzy ideal of the ring R.  
 
DEFINITION [36]: Let µ be any fuzzy subring / fuzzy ideal of a ring R and let 0 ≤ t ≤ 
µ(0). The subring / ideal µt is called a level subring / level ideal of µ. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.2: A fuzzy subset µ of a ring R is a fuzzy ideal of R if and only if the 
level subsets µt , t ∈ Im(µ) are ideals of R.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader as it can be proved using the definition. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.3: If µ is any fuzzy ideal of a ring R, then two level ideals

Now we proceed on to recall the definition of fuzzy prime ideal as given by [99, 100]. 
 
DEFINITION [99]: A non-constant fuzzy ideal µ of a ring R is called fuzzy prime if for 
any fuzzy ideals µ1 and µ2 of R the condition µ1 µ2 ⊆ µ implies that either µ1 ⊆ µ or 
µ2 ⊆ µ.  
 
It is left for the reader to prove the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.5: The level ideal µt , where t = µ(0) is a prime ideal of the ring R. 
 
DEFINITION [99]: A fuzzy ideal µ of a ring R, not necessarily non-constant is called 
fuzzy prime if for any fuzzy ideals µ1 and µ2 of R the condition µ1 µ2 ⊆ µ implies that 
either µ1 ⊆ µ or µ2 ⊆ µ . 
 
Consequent of this definition the following result is left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.6: Any constant fuzzy ideal µ of a ring R is fuzzy prime.  
 
Now we give the characterization theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.7: If µ is any non-constant fuzzy ideal of a ring R, then µ is fuzzy prime 
if and only if l ∈ Im µ : the ideal µt , t = µ(0) is prime and the chain of level ideals of 
µ consists of µt ⊂ R. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.1: An ideal I of a ring R is said to be irreducible if I cannot be 
expressed as I1 ∩ I2 where I1 and I2 are any two ideals of R properly containing I, 
otherwise I is termed reducible.  
 
The following results which will be used are given as theorems, the proof are for the 
reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.8: Any prime ideal of ring R is irreducible. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.9: In a commutative ring with unity, any ideal, which is both 
semiprime and irreducible, is prime. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.10: Every ideal in a Noetherian ring is a finite intersection of 
irreducible ideals.  
 
THEOREM 1.4.11: Every irreducible ideal in a Noetherian ring is primary.

DEFINITION [37]: A fuzzy ideal µ of a ring R is called fuzzy irreducible if it is not a 
finite intersection of two fuzzy ideals of R properly containing µ: otherwise µ is 
termed fuzzy reducible. 
 
THEOREM [109]: If µ is any fuzzy prime ideal of a ring R, then µ is fuzzy irreducible.  
 
Proof: Refer [109]. 
 
However as a hint for the interested reader we mention the proof is given by the 
method of contradiction. We give the theorem from [109] the proof is omitted as it 
can be had from [109]. 
 
THEOREM [109]: If µ is any non-constant fuzzy irreducible ideal of a ring R, then the 
following are true. 
 
i. 
1 ∈ Im µ . 
ii. 
There exists α ∈ [0, 1] such that µ (x) = α for all x ∈ R \ {x ∈ R  
µ(x)=1}. 
iii. 
The ideal {x ∈ R µ (x)=1} is irreducible. 
 
It is important to recall some of the basic properties of fuzzy subrings and fuzzy ideals 
of a ring R. 
 
The proofs of all these results are left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.12: The intersection of any family of fuzzy subrings (fuzzy ideals) of a 
ring R is again a fuzzy subring (fuzzy ideal) of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.13: Let µ be any fuzzy subring and θ be any fuzzy ideal of a ring R. 
Then µ ∩ θ is a fuzzy ideal of the subring {x ∈ R µ (x) = µ (0)}. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.14: Let µ be any fuzzy subset of a field F. Then µ is a fuzzy ideal of F if 
and only if µ (x) = µ (y) ≤ µ(0) for all x, y ∈ F \ {0}. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.15: Let R be a ring. Then R is a field if and only if µ (x) = µ (y) ≤ µ (0) 
where µ is any non-constant fuzzy ideal of R and x, y ∈ R \ {0}. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.16: Let I0 ⊂ I1⊂ …⊂ In = R be any chain of ideal of a ring R. Let t0, t1,

given by [140].

(fuzzy subset) of a ring R. The ideal (fuzzy subring / fuzzy ideal) generated by A(µ) is 
denoted by 〈A〉 (〈µ〉). 
 
The following theorem which can be proved by a routine computation is left as an 
exercise for the reader to prove.

To define the concept of fuzzy coset of a fuzzy ideal the following theorem will help; 
the proof of which is left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.17:  
 
i. 
Let µ be any fuzzy ideal of a ring R and let t = µ(0). Then the fuzzy subset 
µ∗ of R/µt defined by µ∗ (x + µt) = µ(x) for all x ∈ R, is a fuzzy ideal of 
R/µt .  
 

 
44
ii. 
If A is an ideal of R and θ is a fuzzy ideal of R/A such that θ (x + A) = θ(A) 
only when x ∈ A, then there exists a fuzzy ideal µ of R such that µt = A 
where t = µ(0) and θ = µ∗. 
 
Now we recall the definition of fuzzy coset. 
 
DEFINITION [36]: Let µ be any fuzzy ideal of a ring R and let x ∈ R. The fuzzy subset 
µx∗ of R defined by µx∗(r) = µ (r – x) for all r ∈ R is termed as the fuzzy coset 
determined by x and µ.  
 
For more about these concepts please refer [109]. The following theorem is given, the 
proof of which is a matter of routine hence left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.18: Let µ be any fuzzy ideal of a ring R. Then Rµ , the set of all fuzzy 
cosets of µ in R is a ring under the binary compositions. 
 
µx∗ + µy∗ = µ∗x+ y and 
µx∗ µy∗ = µ∗xy for all x, y ∈ R. 
 
Now we proceed on to recall the definition of fuzzy quotient ideal of ring R. 
 
DEFINITION [109]: If µ is any fuzzy ideal of a ring R, then the fuzzy ideal µ' of Rµ 
defined by µ' (µx
∗) = µ(x) for all x ∈ R is called the fuzzy quotient ideal determined by 
µ.  
 
The proof can be had from [109]. 
 
THEOREM [109]: If µ is any fuzzy ideal of a ring R, then the map f : R → Rµ defined 
by f(x) = µx
∗  for all x ∈ R is a homomorphism with kernel µ t , where t = µ (0). 
 
THEOREM [109]: If µ is any fuzzy ideal of a ring R, then each fuzzy ideal of Rµ 
corresponds in a natural way to a fuzzy ideal of R.  
 
Proof: Let µ' be any fuzzy ideal of Rµ. It is entirely straightforward matter to show 
that the fuzzy subset θ of R defined by θ (x) = µ' (µx
∗) for all x ∈ R, is a fuzzy ideal of 
R. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy semiprime ideal. 
 
DEFINITION [109]: A fuzzy ideal µ of a ring R is called fuzzy semiprime if for any 
fuzzy ideal θ of R, the condition θ m ⊆ µ (m ∈ Z 
+) implies θ  ⊂ µ . 
 
The following results are direct and can be obtained as a matter of routine and hence 
left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.19: Let µ be any fuzzy subset of a ring R. Then µ(x) = t if and only if x 
∈ µt and x ∉ µs for all s > t. 
 

 
45
THEOREM 1.4.20: A fuzzy ideal µ of a ring R is fuzzy semiprime if and only if µ, t ∈ 
Im µ, is a semiprime ideal of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.21: An ideal A of a ring R is semiprime if and only if ψA is a fuzzy 
semiprime ideal of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.22: If µ is any fuzzy semiprime ideal of a ring R, then Rµ , the ring of 
fuzzy cosets of µ in R is free from non-zero nilpotent elements. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.23: Let µ be any fuzzy ideal of a ring R such that Im µ = {t, s} with t > 
s. If the ring Rµ has no non-zero nilpotent elements, then the fuzzy ideal µ is fuzzy 
semiprime. 
 
THEOREM [99]: A ring R is regular if and only if every fuzzy ideal of R is idempotent. 
 
Proof: Refer [99]. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.24: A ring R is regular if and only if every fuzzy ideal of R is fuzzy 
semiprime. 
 
Proof: Straightforward hence left for the reader to prove.  
 
Now we recall some results on fuzzy subrings from [40]. 
 
Now for the time being we assume that R is a commutative ring with unit and M will 
denote a maximal ideal of R. If R is quasi local, then M is the unique maximal ideal of 
R and we write (R, M), whenever we say a subring of R we assume the subring 
contains the identity of R. We let g denote the natural homomorphism of R onto R/M. 
If S is a subset of R, we let 〈S〉 denote the ideal of R generated by S. 
 
Let X and Y be fuzzy subsets of R i.e. functions from R into the closed interval [0, 1]. 
Then X+Y is the fuzzy subset of R defined by ∀ z ∈ R, (X+Y)(z) = sup{min(X(x), 
Y(y)} | z = x + y}. We say that X ⊇ Y if X(x) ≥ Y(x) for all x ∈ R. Let {Xi  i ∈ I} be 
a collection of fuzzy subset of R. Define the fuzzy subset

If U is the subset of X, we let δU denote the characteristic function of U in R. We let 
Im (X) denote the image of X. We say that X is finite valued if Im (X) is finite. We let 
X∗ = {x ∈ R  X (x) > 0} the support of X. For all t ∈ [0, 1] we let Xt = {x ∈ R | X(x) 
≥ t} a level subset of X in R.

Let A be a fuzzy subring of R and S a subring of R. Define A|s of R by (A|s) (x) = 
A(x) if x ∈ S and (A|s) (x) = 0 otherwise . It follows that A|s is a fuzzy subring of R. If 
B is a fuzzy subring of R such that B∗ is a field containg the identity of R and B(x) = 
B(x–1) for all units x in R, then B is called the fuzzy subfield in R. R is said to have a 
coefficient field with respect to M if there exist a field F containing the identity of R 
such that R = F + M. Suppose that R has a coefficient field F with respect to M. If A = 
A|F + A|M where A|F is a subfield in R then A|F is called the fuzzy coefficient field of 
A with respect to A|M. 
 
THEOREM [40]: Suppose that M is nil and R has a coefficient field. Let A be a fuzzy 
subring of R such that for all t, s ∈ Im(A) with t > s, (As ∩ F)P
∩ (At ∩ F) = (At ∩ F)P 
then A = A|F + A|M. 
 
Proof: Refer [40]. 
 
Using the above theorem one can easily prove the following theorem, which is once 
again left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM [40]: Suppose that M is nil, R contains a field K and R/M is separable 
algebraic over K. Let A be a fuzzy subring of R such that A ⊇ δK. Then A = A|F + A|M 
and A|F is a fuzzy subfield in R where F is the coefficient field containing K. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to refer [40]. 
 
THEOREM [40]: Let A be a fuzzy subring of R. Suppose that Im (A) = {t0, t1, …, tn} 
where t0 > t1 > … > tn. Suppose further that (R, M) and (At, M ∩ At) are complete 
local rings for all t ∈ Im (A) such that RP ⊂ 
0t
A . Then R has a coefficient field F such 
that A = A|F + A|M where A|F is a fuzzy subfield of R. 
 
Proof: Refer [40]. 
 
Suppose F/K be a field extension and let C and D be fuzzy subfields of F such that D, 
C ⊇ δK. If C and D are linearly disjoint over δK then we write CD = C ⊗ D where CD 
is the composite of C and D. The following results give the structure of the fuzzy field 
extension AF over AK where K⊂
0t
A . The proof of these theorems are left for the 
reader as an exercise, we only state the theorem; interested reader can refer [40]. 
 
THEOREM [40]: Let F/K be a field extension. Suppose that A is a fuzzy subfield of F 
such  that  A ⊇  δK  and  that  A is finite valued say Im(A) – {0} = {t0, t1, …, tn}  where

The reader is expected to prove the following theorems. 
 
THEOREM [40]: Let R = S[x1, x2, …, xn] be a polynomial ring over S and M = 〈 x1, 
…, xn〉. Let A be a fuzzy subring of R. Then A is a fuzzy polynomial subring of R if and 
only if A = A|S + A|M and for all r ∈ R, r ≠ 0, and for all xj , j = 1, 2, …, n. A (xj r) = 
min {A(xj), A(r)}. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
The following theorem is interesting and left for the reader to prove.

THEOREM [40]: Let R = S [[x1, …, xn ]] be a power series ring in the in determinants 
x1, x2, …, xn over S and M = 〈 x1, …, xn 〉. Let A be a fuzzy subring of R. 
 
i. 
If A is a fuzzy power series subring of R, then A = A|S + A|M and for all r ∈ 
R, r ≠ 0 and for all xj , j = 1, 2, …, n, A (x, r) = min {A(xj ), A(r)}. 
 
ii. 
Suppose that A|M is a fuzzy ideal in R. If A = A|S + A|M and for all r ∈ R, r 
≠ 0 and for all xj , j = 1, 2, …, n. A (x, r) = min {A(xj ), A(r)} then A is a 
fuzzy power series subring of R. 
 
Now we proceed on to recall some more notions on fuzzy polynomial subrings. 
 
THEOREM [40]: Suppose that R = S[x](S[[x]]) is a polynomial (power series) ring 
over S and that A is a fuzzy polynomial (power series) subring of R. If A/M is a fuzzy 
ideal of R, then A is constant on M – 〈 0〉 where M = 〈 x〉. 
 
Proof: The reader is requested to refer [40].  
 
We will also using the notation for A∗ and A∗ obtain some interesting results about 
fuzzy subrings. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.2: Let A be a fuzzy subset of R. Define

commutative ring and R/A = R/A∗.

if and only if for all but one of the Aα's is 1 on Rα and the remaining A'α is fuzzy 
maximal or fuzzy prime or fuzzy primary in Rα . 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
Now we proceed on to recall the notion of pairwise co-maximal. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.4: Suppose that R has an identity. Let {Aα | α ∈ Ω } be fuzzy ideals of 
R. The Aα is said to be pair wise co-maximal if and only if Aα ≠ δR and Aα + Aβ = δR

is called the weak fuzzy direct sum of the Aα. Now we proceed on to recall some of the 
extensions of fuzzy subrings and fuzzy ideals as given by [84], that has given a 
necessary and sufficient conditions for a fuzzy subring or a fuzzy ideal A of a 
commutative ring R to be extended to one Ae of a commutative ring S containing R as 
a subring such that A and Ae have the same image.  
 
One of the applications of these results gives a criterion for a fuzzy subring of an 
integral domain R to be extendable to a fuzzy subfield of the quotient field. To this 
end we just recall the definition of fuzzy quasi-local subring and some basic 
properties about collection of ideals. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.48: Let R be a ring and let {It | t ∈ II} be a collection of ideals of R 
such that R = ∪ It for all s, t ∈ II, s > t if and only if Is ⊂ It. Define the fuzzy subset A 
of R by for all x ∈ R, A (x) = sup {t | x ∈ It}. Then A is a fuzzy ideal of R. 

 
55
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
Notation. II is a non-empty subset of [0, 1] i.e. we use II as the index set. 
 
On similar lines the following theorems can also be proved. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.49: Let R be a ring and let {Rt | t ∈ II} be a collection of subrings of R 
such that R = ∪ Rt for all s, t ∈ II, s > t if and only if Rs ⊂ Rt. Define the fuzzy subset 
A of R by, for all x ∈ R, A(x) = sup {t x ∈ Rt}. Then A is a fuzzy subring of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.50: Let R be a ring with unity and let A be a fuzzy subring of R. Then 
for all y ∈ R, y a unit and for all x ∈ R. A(xy–1) ≥ min { A (x) , A (y)}if and only if A(y) 
= A(y–1) for every unit y in R. In either case A(1) ≥ A(y) where y is a unit. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.51: Let R be a quasi-local ring. If A is fuzzy quasi local subring of R, 
then for all t such that 0 ≤ t ≤ A(t), At is a quasi local ring and M ∩ At is the unique 
maximal ideal of At.  
 
(We say that A fuzzy subring of R to be a fuzzy quasi local subring of R if and only if 
for all x ∈ R and for all y ∈ R such that y is a unit, A(xy–1) ≥ min {A(x), A(y)} or 
equivalently A(y) = A (y–1)). 
 
THEOREM 1.4.52: Let R be a quasi-local ring. Let A be a fuzzy subset of R. If for all 
t∈ Im(A), At is a quasi local ring with unique maximal ideal M ∩ At then A is fuzzy 
quasi local subring of R. 
 
For proof please refer [84] or the reader is advised to take it as a part of research and 
find the proof as the proof is more a matter of routine using basically the definitions. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.53: Let R be a quasi local ring. 
 
i. 
If A is a fuzzy quasi local subring of R, then A∗ is quasi local and       
A∗ ∩ M is the unique maximal ideal of A∗. 
 
ii. 
If R' is a subring of R, then R' is quasi-local with unique maximal 
ideal M ∩ R' if and only if δR , is a fuzzy quasi local subring of R.  
 
Next a necessary and sufficient condition for a fuzzy subset A of a ring R to be fuzzy 
quasi local is given.  
 
THEOREM 1.4.54: Let R be a quasi local ring. Let {Rt | t ∈ II} be a collection of quasi 
local subrings of R with unique maximal ideals Mt of Rt , t ∈ II}, such that R = ∪ Rt 
and for all s, t ∈ II, s > t if and only if Rs ⊂ Rt. Define the fuzzy subset A of R by for all 
x ∈ R. A(x) = sup {t | x ∈ Rt }. Then A is fuzzy quasi local if and only if Mt = M ∩ Rt 
for all t ∈ II.  
 
Before one defines the notion of extensions of fuzzy subrings and fuzzy ideals it is 
very essential to see the definition and properties of extension of fuzzy subsets. The 

 
56
following three theorems will give explicitly all properties about extension of fuzzy 
subsets. The proof of which is once again left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.55: Let R be a non-empty subset of a set S and let A be a fuzzy subset 
of R. If B is an extension of A to a fuzzy subset of S, then At ∩ Bs = As for all s, t such 
that 0 ≤ t ≤ s ≤ 1. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.56: Let R be a non-empty subset of a set S and let A be a fuzzy subset 
of R. If B = {Bt | t ∈ Im(A)} is a collection of subsets of S such that 
 
i. ∪ Bt = S.  
ii. for all s, t ∈ Im(A), s > t if and only if Bs ⊂ Bt and  
iii. for all s, t ∈ Im(A), s ≥ t, At ∩ Bs = As, then A has an extension to a fuzzy 
subset Ae of S such that (Ae)t ⊇ Bt for all t ∈ Im (A). 
 
THEOREM 1.4.57: Let R be a non-empty subset of a set S and let A be a fuzzy subset 
of R such that A has the sup property. If B = {Bt t ∈ Im (A)} is a collection of subsets 
of S which satisfies (i) to (iii) of conditions given in the above theorem then A has a 
unique extension to a fuzzy subset Ae of S such that (Ae)t = Bt for all t ∈ Im (A) and 
Im(Ae) = Im(A).  
 
Now we proceed on to define extension of fuzzy subrings and fuzzy ideals. Let R be a 
subring of S. If I is an ideal of R, we let Ie denote the ideal of S extended by I. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.58: Let R be a subring of S and let A be a fuzzy ideal of R such that A 
has the sup property. If  
 
S

and for all s, t ∈ Im (A), s ≥ t, At ∩ (As)e = As, then A has a unique extension to a fuzzy 
ideal Ae of S such that (Ae)t = (At )e for all t ∈ Im (A) and Im(Ae) = Im(A). Let R be a 
commutative ring with identity. Let M be a multiplicative system in R. Let N = {x ∈ R 
| mx = 0 for some m ∈ M}. Then N is an ideal of R. Unless otherwise specified, we 
assume N = 〈 0〉 i.e. M is regular. Let RM denote the quotient ring of R with respect to 
M. Since N = 〈 0〉 , we can assume that R ⊂ RM. If A is a fuzzy subring of R, we 
assume A(1) = A(0). 
 
THEOREM 1.4.59: Let A be a fuzzy subring of R such that A has the sup property. 
Then A can be extended to a fuzzy subring Ae of RM such that for all x, y ∈ R, y a unit. 
Ae(xy–1) ≥ min {Ae(x) , Ae(y)} if and only if for all s, t ∈ Im (A), s ≥ t, At ∩ (At )M = As 
where Ms = M ∩ As for all s ∈ Im (A). If either condition holds, Ae can be chosen so 
that (Ae)t = (A t )M for all t ∈ Im (A) and Im (Ae) = Im(A). 
 
The following two results are very interesting and can be easily verified by the 
readers. 
 

 
57
THEOREM 1.4.60: Let A be a fuzzy subring of R such that A has the sup property. 
Then A can be extended to a fuzzy quasi local subring Ae of RP ⇔ for all s, t ∈ Im (A), 
s ≥ t, At ∩ (As )P = As where Ps = P ∩ As   for all s ∈ Im (A). 
 
THEOREM 1.4.61: Let R be an integral domain and let Q denote the quotient field of  
R. Let A be a fuzzy subring of R such that A has the sup property. Let Qt denote the 
smallest subfield of Q which contains At, for all t ∈ Im (A). Then A can be extended to 
a fuzzy subfield of Q if and only if for all s, t ∈ Im (A), s ≥ t, At ∩ Qs = As . 
 
Now we recall the definition of the extension of fuzzy prime ideals. 
 
Let R and S be rings and let f be a homomorphism of R into S. Let T denote f (R). If I 
is an ideal in R, then the ideal (f(I))e (or simple Ie) is defined to be the ideal of S 
generated by f (I) and is called the extended ideal or extension of I. If J is an ideal of 
S, the ideal Jc = f –1(J) is called the contracted ideal or the contraction of J. 
 
DEFINITION [80]: Let A and B be fuzzy subsets of R and T respectively. Define the 
fuzzy subsets f(A) of T and f –1(B) of R by f(A) (y) = sup {A(x) f(x) = y} for all y ∈ T, 
f –1 (B) (x) = B (f(x)) for all x ∈ R . 
 
THEOREM 1.4.62: Suppose A and B are fuzzy ideals of R and T respectively. Then  
 
i. 
f (A) and f –1(B) are fuzzy ideals of T and R respectively.  
ii. 
f (A) (0) = A(0). 
iii. 
f –1 (B) (0) = B(0). 
 
THEOREM 1.4.63: Let A be a fuzzy ideal of R. Then  
 
i. 
f(A∗) ⊂ (f(A))∗ 
ii. 
if A has the sup property then f (A))∗ = f(A∗). 
 
Now we proceed on to recall the definition of f-invariant. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.8: Let A be a fuzzy ideal of R. A is called f-invariant if and only if for 
all x, y ∈ R, f(x) = f(y) implies A(x) = A(y).  
 
In view of this we have the following nice characterization theorem; the proof of 
which is left an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.64: Let A be a fuzzy ideal of R. Then A is a fuzzy prime ideal of R if 
and only if A(0) = 1, 
2
)
A

 and A∗  is a prime ideal of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.65: Let A be an f-invariant fuzzy ideal of R such that A has the sup 
property. If A∗ is a prime ideal of R, then f (A∗ ) is a prime ideal of T. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.66: Let A be an f-invariant fuzzy ideal of R such that Im(A) is finite. If 
A∗ is a prime ideal of R then f (A∗ ) = (f(A))∗  . 
 

 
58
THEOREM 1.4.67: Let A be an f-invariant fuzzy ideal of R. If A is a fuzzy prime ideal 
of R then f(A) is a fuzzy prime ideal of T. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.68: Let B be a fuzzy ideal of T. Then  
 
i. 
f –1(B∗) = f –1(B)∗  .   
ii. 
If B∗ is a prime ideal of T, then f –1(B)∗ is a prime ideal of R ,  
iii. 
If B is a fuzzy prime ideal of T, then f –1(B) is a fuzzy prime ideal of R. 
 
The following are simple but interesting results on fuzzy ideals. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.69: Let I be a fuzzy ideal of S. Then (I c)∗ = (I∗ ) c.  
 
To prove the following theorem we make the assumption that if M is the 
multiplicative system in R. N = {x∈ R | xm = 0 for some m ∈ M} equals 〈 0〉. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.70: Let I be a fuzzy ideal of RM  then (I ce )∗ = ((I c)∗ ) e = (I∗ ) ce = I∗  . 
 
THEOREM 1.4.71: Let A be a fuzzy ideal of R. Then in RM , (Ace)∗ = ((Ae)∗ )c = (A∗)ec 
and if M is prime to A∗, then (A∗)ec = A∗. 
 
The reader is requested to refer [80]. 
 
We replace the interval [0, 1] by a finite lattice L which has 0 to be the least element 
and 1 to be the largest element. All the while,  fuzzy  ideals  have been defined over 
[0, 1] when we define it over a lattice L we call them L-fuzzy ideal. 
 
DEFINITION [61-64]: An L-fuzzy ideal is a function J : R → L (R is a commutative 
ring with identity L stands for a lattice with 0 and 1) satisfying the following axioms  
 
i. 
J (x + y) ≥ J (x) ∧ J(y). 
ii. 
J (– x) = J(x). 
iii. 
J (xy) ≥ J(x) ∨ J(y).

ii. 
If J: R → L is a fuzzy ideal then  
 
(a) J (0) ≥ J(x) ≥ J(1) for all x ∈ R.

If J is constant on ker f then f –1 (f(J)) = J. 
 
THEOREM (CORRESPONDENCE THEOREM): If f: R → R' is an epimorphism of rings, 
then there is one to one correspondence between the ideals of R' and those of R which 
are constant on ker f. If J is a fuzzy ideal of R which is constant on ker f, then f (J) is 
the corresponding fuzzy ideal of R'. If J' is a fuzzy ideal of R', then f –1(J') is the 
corresponding fuzzy ideal of R. 
 
Proof: Refer [61]. 
 
Now we proceed on to recall the definitions of prime fuzzy ideals, primary fuzzy 
ideals and semiprime fuzzy ideals and also some of it basic properties. For more about 
these concepts please refer [61-64].  
 
By a prime fuzzy ideal we mean a non-constant fuzzy ideal P : R → L satisfying the 
following condition of primeness  
 
P (xy) = P(x) or 
P(xy) = P(y) for all x, y ∈ R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.73: If P: R → L is a prime fuzzy ideal, then the set P(R) of membership 
values of P is a totally ordered set with the least element P(1) and the greatest 
element P(0). 
 
THEOREM 1.4.74: A fuzzy ideal P: R → L is prime if and only if every level cut Pα = 
{x ∈ R | P(x) ≥ α} is prime for all α > P(1) For α = P(1) , Pα = R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.75: Let Z be a non-empty subset of R. Z is a prime ideal of R if and 
only if χz : R → L is a prime fuzzy ideal. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.76: Let R be a principal ideal domain (PID). If P : R → L is a prime 
fuzzy ideal and PP (0) ≠ 0, then P (R) has two elements. P is properly fuzzy if and only 
if P(R) has three elements. We see a properly fuzzy prime ideal of a PID R is 
equivalent to the fuzzy ideal P : R → L of the following type: 
 

 
60
P(0) = 1,  
P (x) = α  
 
for all x ∈ P1 \ {0}. P(x) = 0 for all x ∈ R \ P1 where P1 is a prime ideal of R and 0 < 
α < 1. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.9: A finite strictly increasing sequence of prime ideals of a ring R, P0 
⊂ P1 ⊂ P2 ⊂ …⊂ Pn is called a chain of prime ideals of length n. The supremum of 
the lengths of all chains is called the dimension of R . 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.10: Let R be a ring. Then ∨{ |P(R) |  P: R → [0, 1] is a prime fuzzy 
ideal} is called the fuzzy dimension of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.77:  
 
i. 
The dimension of R is n (< ∞) if and only if its fuzzy dimension is n + 2. 
ii. 
An artinian ring has no properly fuzzy prime ideal. 
iii. 
A Boolean ring has no properly fuzzy prime ideal.  
 
The following results are relation on homomorphism and epimorphism of rings. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.78:  
 
i. 
Let f : R → R' is an epimorphism of rings. If P: R → L is a prime fuzzy 
ideal which is constant on ker f then f (P) : R' → L is a prime fuzzy ideal.  
ii. 
If f : R → R' is a homomorphism of rings. If P' : R' → L is a fuzzy prime 
ideal then f –1 (P') is a prime fuzzy ideal of R. 
iii. 
Let f : R → R' be an epimorphism of ring. 
 
(a) 
Let P : R → L be a fuzzy ideal which is constant on ker f. Then P is 
prime if and only if f(P) : R' → L is prime. 
(b) 
Let P' : R' → L be a fuzzy ideal. Then P' is prime if and only if               
f –1(P') : R → L is prime. 
 
The proof can be got by simple computations and hence left for the reader as exercise. 
Now we proceed on to give the definitions of primary fuzzy ideals of a ring. 
 
DEFINITION [149]: A fuzzy ideal Q : R → L is called primary if Q(xy) = Q(0) implies 
Q(x) = Q(0) or Q(yn) = Q(0) for some integer n > 0. 
 
DEFINITION [77]: A fuzzy ideal Q : R → L is called primary, if either Q is the 
characteristic function of R or  
 
i. 
Q is non-constant and  
ii. 
A o B ⊆ Q ⇒ A ⊂ Q or B ⊆ 
Q  is the intersection of all prime fuzzy 
ideals. 
 
DEFINITION [146]: A fuzzy ideal Q : R → L is called primary, if  

 
61
 
i. 
Q is non-constant and  
ii. 
for all x, y ∈ R and r, s ∈ L if x, y ∈ Q then xr ∈ Q or 
n
sy  ∈ Q for some 
positive integer n. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.11: A fuzzy ideal Q : R → L is called primary if Q is non-constant 
and for all x, y ∈ R, Q(xy) = Q(x) or Q(yn) for some positive integer n. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.79: 
 
i. 
Let Q be an ideal of R. The characteristic function χQ is a primary fuzzy 
ideal if and only if Q is a primary ideal.  
ii. 
If Q : R → L is primary then its level cuts Qα = {x∈ RQ(x) ≥ α}, α ∈ L, 
are primary.  
iii. 
Every prime fuzzy ideal is primary. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove. 
 
As in case of prime ideals and its relation with epimorphism and homomorphism, we 
give here without proof the relation of primary ideals and the epimorphism and 
homomorphism. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.80: 
 
i. Let f :  R → R' be an epimorphism of rings. If Q : R → L is a primary fuzzy 
ideal of R which is constant on ker f, then f(Q) is a primary fuzzy ideal of 
R'. 
ii. Let f : R → R' be a homomorphism of rings. If Q' : R' → L is a primary 
fuzzy ideal of R' then f –1(Q') is a primary fuzzy ideal of R . 
iii. Let f : R → R' be an epimorphism of rings and Q: R → L and Q' : R' → L 
be a fuzzy ideals.  
(a) 
Q' is primary if and only if f –1(Q') is primary.  
(b) 
If Q is constant on ker f, then Q is primary if and only if f (Q) is 
primary. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of weak primary fuzzy ideals. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.12: A fuzzy ideal J: R → L is said to be weak primary or in short w-
primary if J(xy) = J(x) or J(xy) ≤ J(yn) for some integer n > 0. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.81: Every primary fuzzy ideal is w-primary. In particular, every prime 
fuzzy ideal is w-primary. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definitions, hence left for the reader to prove.  
 
We give the following two nice characterization theorems. The proofs are left for the 
reader as an exercise. 
 

 
62
THEOREM 1.4.82: A fuzzy ideal is w-primary if and only if each of its level cuts is 
primary. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.83: Let Q be an ideal of R. The characteristic function χQ is w-primary 
if and only if Q is primary. 
 
Finally we give the following result the proof of which is easy by simple 
computations. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.84: Let f : R → R' be a homomorphism of rings, and Q : R → L and   
Q' : R' → L be fuzzy ideals. 
 
i. 
If φ is w-primary then so is f –1(Q'). 
 
ii. 
Let f be an epimorphism. Then Q is w-primary if and only if f(Q) is 
w-primary. 
 
iii. 
Let f be an epimorphism then Q' is w-primary if and only if f –1(Q) 
is w-primary.

Now we recall the notion of prime fuzzy radical. 
 
DEFINITION 1.4.13: Let J : R → L be a fuzzy ideal and P : R → L denote a prime 
fuzzy ideal containing J. The fuzzy ideal r (J) = ∩ {PJ ⊆ P} is called the prime fuzzy 
radical of J.

DEFINITION 1.4.14: A fuzzy ideal S: R → L is called semiprime fuzzy ideal if S(x2) = 
S(x) for all x ∈ R.  
 
The following results are left as an exercise for the reader to prove.

iii. 
Let f : R → R' be a homomorphism. If S' : R' → L is a semiprime fuzzy 
ideal of R then f  –1(S') is a semiprime fuzzy ideal of R. 

 
64
iv. 
Let f : R → R' be an epimorphism and S : R → L be a semiprime fuzzy 
ideal of R which is constant on ker f. Then f(S) is a semiprime fuzzy ideal 
of R'. Thus by the correspondence theorem between semiprime fuzzy ideals 
of R' and those of R which are constant on the kernel of f. 
v. 
Every prime fuzzy ideal is semiprime fuzzy ideal.  
vi. 
Intersection of semiprime fuzzy ideal is a semiprime fuzzy ideal. In 
particular intersection of prime fuzzy ideals is a semiprime fuzzy ideal. 
vii. 
If S : R → L is a semiprime fuzzy ideal, then the quotient ring R/S is prime. 
 
Now we formulate certain equivalent condition of a fuzzy ideal. The proof of these 
relations is omitted. 
 
THEOREM 1.4.90: If S: R → L is a fuzzy ideal then the following are equivalent  
 
i. 
S is semiprime. 
ii. 
Each level cut of S is semiprime. 
iii. 
S(xn) = x for all integers n > 0 and x ∈ R. 
iv. 
J2 ⊆ S implies J ⊆ S for all fuzzy ideals J : R → L.  
v.

vi. 
S =

S  is the fuzzy nil radical of S when L is totally 
ordered each of the above statements is equivalent to the following: 
 
a. S coincides with its prime fuzzy radical.  
b. S = ∩ { P P ∈ C} where C is a class of prime fuzzy ideals.  
 
 
 
1.5 Fuzzy birings 
 
In this section we just introduce the notion of birings and fuzzy birings. The very 
concept of birings is very new [135] so the notion is fuzzy birings is defined only in 
this book. So we first give some of the basic properties of birings and then give the 
fuzzy analogue of it. As the main aim of this book is to introduce the notion of 
Smarandache fuzzy algebraic structures we do not stake in discussing elaborately the 
concepts other than Smarandache structures. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.1: A non-empty set (R, +, y) with two binary operations ‘+’ and 'y' is 
said to be a biring if R = R1 ∪ R2 where R1 and R2 are proper subsets of R and  
 
i. 
(R1 , +, y) is a ring. 
ii. 
(R2 , +, y) is a ring. 
 
Example 1.5.1: Let R = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 3, 9, 15} be a non-empty set. (R, 
+, y) where ‘+’ and ‘y’ are usual addition and multiplication modulo 18. Take R1 = {0, 
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, } and R2 = {0, 3, 6, 9, 15, 12}; clearly (R1, +, y) and (R2, +, 
y) are rings. 
 
A biring R is said to be finite if R contains only finite number of elements. If R has 
infinite number of elements then we say R is of infinite order. The biring R given in 

 
65
example 1.5.1 is of finite order and has 12 elements. We denote the order of R by 
R or o(R). 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.2: A biring R = R1 ∪ R2 is said to be a commutative biring if both R1 
and R2 are commutative rings. Even if one of R1 or R2 is not a commutative ring then 
we say the biring is a non-commutative biring. We say the biring R has a monounit if 
a unit exists which is common to both R1 and R2. If R1 and R2 are rings which has 
separate unit then we say the biring R = R1 ∪ R2 is a biring with unit. 
 
It is interesting to note that the biring given in example 1.5.1 has no units but is a 
commutative biring of finite order. 
 
Example 1.5.2: Let R2×2 denote the set of all 2 × 2 upper triangular matrices with 
entries from the ring of integers Z i.e.  
 
R2×2 =

DEFINITION 1.5.3: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring. A non-empty subset S of R is said to 
be a sub-biring of R if S = S1 ∪ S2 and S itself a biring and S1 = R1 ∩ S and S2 = R2 ∩ 
S.

Clearly S is a sub-biring of R. 
 
The following theorem is very important which is a characterization theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.1: Let R be a biring where R = R1 ∪ R2. A non-empty subset S = S1 ∪ 
S2 of R is a subring of R if and only if R1 ∩ S = S1 and R2 ∩ S = S2 are sub-biring of 
R1 and R2 respectively. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.4: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring. A non-empty subset I of R is said to 
be a right bi-ideal of R if I = I1 ∪ I2 where I1 is a right ideal of R1 and I2 is a right 
ideal of R2. I is said to be a left bi-ideal of R if I = I1 ∪ I2 are left ideals of R1 and R2 
respectively.  
 
If I = I1 ∪ I2 is such that both I1and I2 are ideals of R1 and R2 respectively then we say 
I is a bi-ideal of R, then we say I is a bi-ideal of R. Now it may happen when I = I1 ∪ 
I2 , I1 may be a right ideal of R1 and I2 may be a left ideal of R2 then how to define 
ideal structures.  
 
For this case we give the following definition. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.5: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring. We say the set I = I1 ∪ I2 is a mixed 
bi-ideal of R if I1 is a right ideal of R1 and I2 is a left ideal of R2. Thus we see only in 
case of birings we can have the concept of mixed bi-ideals i.e. an ideal simultaneously 
having a section to be a left ideal and another section to be right ideal. 
 
Example 1.5.4: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring given in example 1.5.2 Take I = I1 ∪ I2 
where 
 
I1 =

DEFINITION 1.5.6: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring. A bi-ideal I = I1 ∪ I2 is called a 
maximal bi-ideal of R if I1 is a maximal ideal of R1 and I2 is a maximal ideal of R2. 
Similarly we can define the concept of minimal bi-ideal as J = J1 ∪ J2 is a minimal 
ideal if J1 is a minimal ideal of R1 and J2 is a minimal ideal of R2. It may happen in a 
bi-ideal. I of a ring R = R1 ∪ R2 that one of I1 or I2 may be maximal or minimal then 
what do we call the structure I = I1 ∪ I2. We call I = I1 ∪ I2 a bi-ideal in which only I1 
or I2 is a maximal ideal as quasi maximal bi-ideal. Similarly we can define quasi 
minimal bi-ideal. 
 
We call a bi-ideal I = I1 ∪ I2 to be a prime bi-ideal of R = R1 ∪ R2 the biring if both I1 
and I2 are prime ideals of the rings R1 and R2 respectively. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.7: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 and S = S1 ∪ S2 be two subrings. We say a map φ 
from R to S is a biring homomorphism if φ = φ1 ∪ φ2 where φ1 = φ | R1 from R1 to S1 
is a ring homomorphism and φ2 : φ | R2 is a map from R2 to S2 is a ring 
homomorphism. We for notational convenience denote by φ = φ1 ∪ φ2 though this 
union ‘∪’ is not the set theoretic union. We define for the homomorphism φ : R → S 
where R = R1 ∪ R2 and S = S1 ∪ S2 are birings the kernel of the homomorphism φ as 
biker φ = ker φ1 ∪ ker φ2 here ker φ1 = {a1 ∈ R1  φ1(a1) = 0} and ker φ2 = {a2 ∈ R2 
φ2(a2) = 0}.  
 
The following theorem is straightforward hence left for the reader to prove. 
 

 
68
THEOREM 1.5.2: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 and S = S1 ∪ S2 be two birings and φ a biring 
homomorphism from R to S then biker φ = ker φ1 ∪ ker φ2 is a bi-ideal of the biring R.  
 
We may have several other interesting results but we advise the reader to refer [135]. 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy birings and give some basic and important results 
about them. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.8: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2 , +, y) be a biring. The map µ : R → [0, 1] is 
said to be a fuzzy sub-biring of the biring R if there exists two fuzzy subsets µ1 (of R1) 
and µ2 (of R2) such that  
 
i. (µ1 , +, y) is a fuzzy subring of (R1 , +, y) 
ii. (µ2 , +, y) is a fuzzy subring of (R2 , +, y) 
iii. µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.3: Every t-level subset of a fuzzy sub-biring µ of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 
need not in general be a sub-biring of the biring R. 
 
Proof: The reader is requested to prove by constructing a counter example. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.9: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2 , +, y) be a biring and µ (= µ1 ∪ µ2) be a fuzzy

The condition t ∈ {0, min {µ1(0), µ2(0)}. is essential for the bilevel subset be a sub-
biring for if t ∉ {0, min {µ1(0), µ2(0)} then the bilevel subset-need not in general be a 
sub-biring of the biring R. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.10: A fuzzy subset µ of a ring R is said to be a fuzzy sub-biring of the 
ring R if there exists two fuzzy subrings µ1 and µ2 of µ (µ1 ≠ µ and µ2 ≠ µ) such that µ 
= µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.4: Every fuzzy sub-biring of a ring R is a fuzzy subring of the ring R 
and not conversely. 
 
Proof: Follows by the very definitions. 
 
It is however left for the student to prove that the converse of the above theorem is not 
true. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.11: A fuzzy subset µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring R = R1∪ R2 is called a 
fuzzy bi-ideal of R if and only if µ1 is a fuzzy ideal of R1 and µ2 is a fuzzy ideal of R2. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.12: A fuzzy subset µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring R = R1∪ R2 is a fuzzy sub-
biring (fuzzy bi-ideal) of R if and only if the level subsets µ t , t ∈ Im (µ) = Imµ1 ∪ 
Imµ2 are subrings or ideals of R1 and R2.

It can be easily verified that µoθ is a fuzzy bi-ideal of R = R1∪ R2. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.14: A fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring R = R1∪ R2 is called 
fuzzy prime if, the bi-ideal µt = (µ1)t ∪ (µ2)t where t = µ1 (0) and t =µ2 (0) is a prime 
ideal of R1 and R2 respectively. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.15: A non-constant fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring R = R1∪ R2 
is called fuzzy prime if, for any two bi-ideals σ and θ of R the condition σ θ  ⊆ µ 
either σ ⊂ µ or θ ⊂ µ (where θ = θ1 ∪ θ2 and σ = σ1 ∪ σ2 by σ ⊂ µ we mean σ1 ⊂ µ1 
and σ2 ⊂ µ2 similarly σ θ ⊂ µ implies σ1 θ1 ⊂ µ1 and σ2θ2 ⊂ µ2). 
 
THEOREM 1.5.5:  
  
i. 
If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a fuzzy prime bi-ideal of a biring R = R1∪ R2 then the 
ideal µt = (µ1 ∪ µ2)t = (µ1)t ∪ (µ2)t , t = µ1(0) that is t = µ1(0) and t = 
µ2(0) is a prime bi-ideal of R = R1∪ R2.

THEOREM 1.5.6: A non-constant fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring R = R1∪ R2 is 
fuzzy prime if and only if card Im µ1 = 2 and card Imµ2 = 2, 1 ∈ Im µ1 and 1 ∈ Im µ2 
and the ideal (µ1 )t  and (µ2 )t where t = µ1 (0) and t = µ2 (0) is prime. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of ideals as each of µi, i = 1, 2 are non-constant fuzzy ideals 
so is µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.16: Let R = R1∪ R2 be a biring. Let µs and µt be two level sub-birings 
and level bi-ideals (with s < t) of a fuzzy sub-biring (fuzzy bi-ideal), µ of a biring R 
are equal if and only if there is no x in R such that s ≤ µ(x) < t (that is s < µ1(x1) < t,   
s < µ2(x2) < t, x1 ∈ R1 and x2 ∈ R2). 
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.7: Intersection of any family of fuzzy sub-birings (fuzzy bi-ideals) of a 
ring R is a fuzzy sub-biring (fuzzy bi-ideal) of R. 
 

 
70
Proof: µi : R → [0, 1] where R = R1∪ R2 and µi = µi1 ∪ µi2 each µi1 is a fuzzy subring 
of R1 µi2 is a fuzzy sub-biring of R2 then by usual results on fuzzy ideals we see 
intersection of µij is a fuzzy subring of fuzzy ideal for j = 1, 2. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.8: If µ is a fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R = R1∪ R2. Then µ + µ = µ. 
 
Proof: The result follows as in case of fuzzy ideal. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.9: If µ is any fuzzy sub-biring and θ is any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R 
= R1∪ R2.Then µ ∩ θ is a fuzzy bi-ideal of the biring µt = { x ∈ R  µ(x) = µ(0)}. 
[µ(x) = µ(0) will mean for all x ∈ R1 , µ1(x) = µ1(0) and for all x ∈ R2, µ2(x) = µ2(0)]. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.10: Let µ be any fuzzy subset of a bifield F = F1 ∪ F2. Then µ = µ1 ∪ 
µ2 is a fuzzy bi-ideal of F if and only if µ (x) = µ (y) ≤ µ (0) for all x, y ∈ F \ {0}. (i.e. 
µ1 (x) = µ1 (y) ≤ µ1 (0) for all x, y ∈ F1 \ {0} and µ2 (x) = µ2 (y) ≤ µ2 (0) for all x, y ∈         
F2 \ {0}). 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of ideals in fields. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.11: Let R = R1∪ R2. be any biring . Then R is bifield if and only if µ(x) 
= µ(y) < µ(0) where µ is any non-constant fuzzy bi-ideal of R and x, y ∈ R \ {0}. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of rings. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.12: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is any fuzzy sub-biring (fuzzy bi-ideal) of a biring R 
= R1 ∪ R2 and if µ(x) < µ(y) for some x , y ∈ R then µ(x – y) = µ(x) = µ(y – x). 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.17: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be any fuzzy subset of a biring R = R1∪ R2. The 
smallest fuzzy sub-biring (fuzzy bi-ideal) of R containing µ is called the fuzzy sub-
biring (fuzzy bi-ideal ) generated by µ in R and is denoted by 〈µ〉 = 〈µ1 〉 ∪ 〈µ2 〉. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.13: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be any fuzzy subset of a biring. Then the fuzzy 
subset µ∗ of R = R1 ∪ R2 defined by µ∗(x) = sup {k / x ∈ 〈µk 〉 } (µ∗(x) = µ1
∗(x) ∪ 
µ2
∗(x)) is a fuzzy sub-biring (fuzzy bi-ideal) generated by µ in R according as 〈µk 〉 is 
the sub-biring (bi-ideal) generated by µk in R. (In other wards µ∗(x) = t when ever x ∈ 
〈µk 〉 and x ∉ 〈µ s 〉 for all s > t). 
 
We just define for any fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring, R = R1 ∪ R2 with t = 
µ(0). Then the fuzzy subset µ∗ of R/µt is defined by µ∗(x + µt) = µ(x) for all x ∈ R is a 
fuzzy bi-ideal of R/µt.

 where µ(0) = t. 
 
Now we proceed on to define level bi-ideal fuzzy prime bi-ideal, fuzzy maximal bi-
ideal and so on and give some interesting results on them. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.19: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 
such that each level bi-ideal µt , t ∈ Im µ is prime. If µ(x) < µ(y) for some x, y ∈ R then 
µ(xy) = µ(y) (Here µ(x) < µ(y) ⇒ µ1(x) < µ1(y) if x, y ∈ R1 and µ2(x) < µ2(y) if x, y ∈ 
R2). 

 
72
 
THEOREM 1.5.16: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is any fuzzy prime bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 
then µ(xy) = max (µ(x) , µ(y)) for all x, y ∈ R. 
 
Proof: As in case of prime ideal we get the proof. 
 
Now we give a nice characterization theorem, the proof of which is to be supplied by 
the reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.17: If µ and θ are any two fuzzy prime bi-ideals of a biring R, then µ ∩ 
θ is a fuzzy prime bi-ideal of R if and only if µ ⊆ θ or θ ⊆ µ . 
 
(Hint µ = µ1 ∪ µ2, θ = θ1 ∪ θ2, µ ∩ θ = (µ1 ∩ θ1) ∪ (µ2 ∩ θ2), R = R1∪ R2, so µ1 ⊆ θ1 
µ2 ⊆ θ2 or µ1 ⊆ θ1 or µ2 ⊆ θ2 ; µ1 : R1 → [0, 1], µ2 : R2 → [0, 1], θ1 : R1 → [0, 1] and 
θ2 : R2 → [0, 1]). 
 
THEOREM 1.5.18: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R such that I ∈    
Im µ and let θ = θ1 ∪ θ2 be any fuzzy prime bi-ideal of the biring R. Then, µ ∩ θ is a 
fuzzy prime bi-ideal of the biring µt = {x ∈ R  µ(x) = I}= {x1 ∈ R1 µ1(x1) = 1} ∪ 
{x2 ∈ R2  µ2 (x2) = 1}, where µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 such that µ1 : R1 → [0, 1] and µ2 : R2 → 
[0, 1] and Im µ = Im µ1 ∪ Im µ2. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of fuzzy prime ideals. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.19: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a fuzzy prime bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪  R2 
then Rµ is an integral bidomain. 
 
Proof: Follows from the fact that each of µ1 : R1 → [0, 1] and µ2 : R2 → [0, 1] is such 
that 
1
R µ and 
2
R µ are integral domains so Rµ = 
1
R µ ∪ 
2
R µ  is an integral bidomain . 
 
THEOREM 1.5.20: Let µ be a fuzzy bi-ideal of biring R = R1 ∪  R2 such that Im µ = 
{1, σ } where σ ∈ [0, 1). If Rµ is an integral bidomain then µ is a fuzzy prime bi-ideal. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of rings. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.20: A fuzzy bi-ideal µ of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 is called fuzzy maximal 
bi-ideal if Im µ = {1, σ } where σ ∈ [0, 1) and the level bi-ideal µt = {x ∈ R µ (x) = 
1} is maximal. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.21: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2. Then 
µ is a fuzzy maximal bi-ideal if and only if Rµ is a bifield. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by definitions and using fuzzy ideal analogous of a ring. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.22: Let R be a biring α ∈ [0, 1) and X = {µ µ is a fuzzy bi-ideal of the 
biring R with Im µ = {1, σ }}. Then µ ∈ X is fuzzy maximal if and only if for each β ∈ 
X either β ⊆ µ or else (µ + β) (y) = 1 for all y ∈ R. 
 

 
73
Proof: Follows directly from the definitions and results on rings. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.23: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 and σ = σ1 ∪ σ2 any two distinct fuzzy maximal 
bi-ideals of a biring R such that µ(0) = σ (0) and Im µ = Im σ then µ ∩ σ = µσ . 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy semiprime bi-ideal of a biring. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.21: A fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 is called 
fuzzy semiprime if for any fuzzy bi-ideal θ of R the condition θ n ⊆ µ implies θ ⊆ µ 
where n ∈ Z+. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.24: Intersection of fuzzy semiprime bi-ideals of a biring R is always a 
fuzzy semiprime bi-ideal of the biring R. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.25: If µ is any fuzzy semiprime bi-ideal of a bring R then Rµ is free 
from non-zero nilpotent elements. 
 
Proof: Follows by results as in case of rings. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.26: Let µ be any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R with Im µ = {t, j} such that 
t > j. If the biring Rµ has no non-zero nilpotent elements then the fuzzy bi-ideal µ is 
fuzzy semiprime. 
 
Proof: Follows by definitions and proofs as in case of rings. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.22: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring R is said to be regular if and only if 
both R1 and R2 are regular rings. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.27: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring; R is regular if and only if every fuzzy 
bi-ideal of R is idempotent i.e. both R1 and R2 are idempotent. 
 
Proof: Follows directly by definitions and results on rings. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.28: A biring R = R1∪ R2 is regular if and only if every fuzzy bi-ideal of 
R is fuzzy semiprime.  
 
Proof: Direct by definitions. 
 
Next we proceed on to define fuzzy primary bi-ideals and semiprimary bi-ideals of 
birings. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.23: A fuzzy bi-ideal µ of a biring R is called fuzzy primary if for any 
two fuzzy bi-ideals σ and θ of the biring R = R1 ∪ R2 the condition σ θ   ⊆ 
µ and     

 
74
σ ⊆/ µ together imply θ ⊆

The following theorem is straightforward and hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.29: Every fuzzy prime bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 is a fuzzy 
primary bi-ideal of R. 
 
Thus we are guaranteed of the existence of fuzzy primary bi-ideal in a biring. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.30: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is any fuzzy primary bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 
then µt = (µ1)t ∪ (µ2)t , t ∈ Im µ is a primary bi-ideal of R.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.31: If A = A1 ∪ A2 is a primary bi-ideal of the biring R = R1 ∪ R2 ,

µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a fuzzy primary bi-ideal of R. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of rings with simple modifications.  
 
 
Now following the results in the above theorems we get the following characterization 
theorem; the proof of which is left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.32: A necessary and sufficient condition for a bi-ideal A = A1 ∪ A2 of a 
biring R = R1 ∪ R2 to be fuzzy primary is that χA is a fuzzy primary bi-ideal of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.33: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is any fuzzy primary bi-ideal of a biring R then 
µ  
is fuzzy prime. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of rings with appropriate modification. The fact that a biring 
R1 ∪ R2 = R is called primary if the zero ideal of both R1 and R2 are primary. 
 

 
75
THEOREM 1.5.34: If µ is any fuzzy primary bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2, then the 
biring Rµ = (R1)µ ∪ (R2)µ is primary. 
 
Proof: Straightforward hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.35: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 such 
that Im µ = {1, α } with α < 1. If every zero divisor in Rµ is nilpotent then µ is fuzzy 
primary. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of rings. 
 
We now present a sufficient condition for a fuzzy bi-ideal to be fuzzy primary. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.36: Let µ be any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 such that Im µ 
= {1, α } with α < 1. If 
µ  is a fuzzy maximal then µ is fuzzy primary.

THEOREM 1.5.39: A bi-ideal A = A1 ∪ A2 of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 is semiprimary if 
and only if χA is a fuzzy semiprimary bi-ideal of R. 
 
Proof: Follows from definitions and also using the method of rings we can get the 
proof. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.40: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is any fuzzy semiprimary bi-ideal of a ring R then 
the biring Rµ is semiprimary. 
 
Proof: The result follows by proving the zero bi-ideal of Rµ =

THEOREM 1.5.41: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 by any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 such 
that Im µ = {1, α} where α < 1. If the ring Rµ is semiprimary then µ is a fuzzy 
semiprimary bi-ideal of R. 
 
Proof: Follows by the very definitions. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.42: If µ is any non-constant fuzzy semiprimary bi-ideal of a regular 
biring then Imµ = {1, α}, α ∈ [0, 1). 
 
Proof: Follows directly by the definitions and by routine methods, hence left for the 
reader as an exercise. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the notions of fuzzy irreducible bi-ideals of a biring R. 
 
DEFINITION 1.5.25: A fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 is called 
fuzzy irreducible if it is not an intersection of two fuzzy bi-ideals of R properly 
containing µ ; otherwise µ is termed as fuzzy reducible. 

 
77
 
THEOREM 1.5.43: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is any fuzzy prime bi-ideal of a biring R then µ is 
fuzzy irreducible. 
 
Proof: Use the fact µ1: R1 → [0, 1] and µ2: R2 → [0, 1] are fuzzy prime ideals of R1 
and R2 respectively and they are fuzzy irreducible so µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is fuzzy irreducible. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.44: Let µ be any non-constant fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal of a biring R. 
Then there exists α ∈[0, 1) such that  
 
i. 
Im µ = {1, α } and  
ii. 
the level bi-ideal {x ∈ R / µ(x) = 1} is irreducible. 
 
Proof: The proof is a matter of routine as in case of rings. Hence it is left for the 
reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.45: If A = A1 ∪ A2 is any irreducible bi-ideal of a biring R, A1 ≠ R1 ,   
A2 ≠ R2 where R = R1 ∪ R2  , then the fuzzy ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of R defined by

(where µ = µ1 ∪ µ2) where α ∈ [0, 1) is a fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal of the biring R. 
 
Proof: Straightforward as in case of rings. 
 
In view of the earlier theorems we have the following nice characterization theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.46: A necessary and sufficient condition for a bi-ideal A = A1 ∪ A2 of a 
biring R = R1 ∪ R2 to be irreducible is that χA is a fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal of R. 
 
Now we give condition for a fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal to be fuzzy prime. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.47: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is any fuzzy bi-ideal of a biring R which is both 
fuzzy semiprime and fuzzy irreducible then µ is fuzzy prime.  
 
Proof: Straightforward, hence left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 1.5.48: In a regular biring every fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal is fuzzy prime. 
 
Proof: It is left as an exercise for the reader to prove using earlier results and the 
definition of fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal.

We say a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 to be Noetherian if both R1 and R2 are Noetherian rings. 
Every bi-ideal of a Noetherian biring R = R1 ∪ R2 can be represented as a finite 
intersection of fuzzy primary bi-ideal of R i.e. every ideal of R1and R2 can be 
represented as a finite intersection of fuzzy primary ideals of R. Now we give a 
condition for a biring R = R1 ∪ R2 to be Noetherian.  
 
THEOREM 1.5.49: If the cardinality of the image set of every bi-ideal of a biring R = 
R1 ∪ R2 is finite then the biring R is Noetherian.  
 
Proof: Using the fact that the biring R = R1 ∪ R2 where R1 and R2 are rings, it is 
enough if we can prove that each of R1 and R2 satisfies the Noetherian ring property. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.50: A biring R is artinian if and only if every fuzzy ideal is finite 
valued.  
 
Proof: As in case of rings the result follows.  
 
THEOREM 1.5.51: If µ is any fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal of a Noetherian biring R then 
µ is fuzzy primary.  
 
Proof: Easily follows as in case of rings.  
 
THEOREM 1.5.52: Let µ be any fuzzy bi-ideal of a Noetherian biring R = R1 ∪ R2 
such that Im µ = {1, α }, α < 1. Then µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 can be written as a finite 
intersection of fuzzy irreducible bi-ideals of R. 
 
Proof: Let µ t = (µ1)t ∪ (µ2)t = {x ∈ R1 | µ1(x) = 1} ∪ { x ∈ R2 | µ2(x) = 1}, then by 
hypothesis we have

1 ≤ i ≤ n. It easily follows each µi is fuzzy irreducible. Thus µ = µ1 ∩ … ∩ µn that is µ 
= (µ11 ∩ µ21 ∩ … ∩ µn1) ∪ (µ12 ∩ µ22 ∩ … ∩ µn2).  
 
Now the following theorem can be easily established by any innovative reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.5.53: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a fuzzy bi-ideal of a Noetherian bi-ring R = R1 ∪ 
R2 such that Im µ = {1, α}, α < 1, then µ can be expressed as a finite intersection of 
fuzzy primary bi-ideals of the biring R. 
 
Several more results on fuzzy subrings and fuzzy sub-birings can be obtained; but as 
the main aim of the book is only study on the Smarandache fuzzy algebra, we have 
restrained ourselves from giving several results. Here also only proofs are hinted and 
it is left for the readers to prove. 
 
 
1.6 Fuzzy Fields and their properties 
 
The concept of fuzzy subfield is recalled in this section. For more about fuzzy 
subfield please refer [75, 79]. 
 
DEFINITION 1.6.1: Let F be a field, A fuzzy subfield of F is a function A from F into 
the closed interval [0, 1] such that for all x, y ∈ F 
 
(A(x – y) ≥ min {A(x), A(y)} and 
A(xy –1) ≥ min {A(x), A(y)}; y ≠ 0. 
 
Let A be a fuzzy subset of F and let A≠ = {x ∈ F / A(x) ≥ A(1)} where 1 denotes the 
multiplicative identity of F. Let K be a subfield of F and let S(F/K) denote the set of 
all fuzzy subfields, A of F such that K ⊆ A≠. Here we just recall certain properties of 
field extensions F/K in terms of fuzzy subfields and conversely.  
 
Let A be a fuzzy subset of the field F. For 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, let At = {
}t
)
x
(

F

≥
∈
. Then 
A≠ = At when t = A(1). 
 
The following results are given without proof for the reader. However the interested 
reader can refer [75]. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.1:  
 
i. 
If A is a fuzzy subset of F and s, t ∈ Im (A), the image of A, then s ≤ t if and 
only if As ⊇ At and s = t if and only if As = At .  
ii. 
If A is a fuzzy subfield of F, then for all x ∈ F, x ≠ 0, A(0) ≥ A(1) ≥ A(x) = 
A(–x) = A(x–1). 
 
THEOREM 1.6.2: Let A be a fuzzy subset of F. If At is a subfield of F for all t ∈ Im (A), 
then A is a fuzzy subfield of F. Conversely, if A is a fuzzy subfield of F, then for all t 
such that 0 ≤ t ≤ A(1), At is a subfield of F. 
 

 
80
THEOREM 1.6.3: Let S be a subset of F such that S (Cardinality of S) ≥ 2. Then S is 
a subfield of F if and only if χS , the characteristic function of S, is a fuzzy subfield of 
F. 
 
Recall if K be a subfield of F i.e. F is an extension field of K then the field extension 
is denoted by F/K. S(F/K) denotes the set of all fuzzy subfields A of F such that A≠ ⊇ 
K and A≠ is a subfield of F. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.4: Let F1 ⊂ F2 ⊂ …⊂ Fi … be a strictly ascending chain of subfields of 
F such that ∪ Fi = F. Define the fuzzy subset A of F by A(x) = ti, if x ∈ Fi \ Fi–1 where 
ti > ti+1 for i = 1, 2, … and Fo = φ. Then A is a fuzzy subfield of F. 
 
Proof: Let x, y ∈ F. Then x – y ∈ Fi \ Fi – 1 for some i. Hence either x ∉ Fi – 1 or y ∉    
Fi – 1. Thus A(x – y) = ti ≥ min {A(x), A(y)}, similarly A(xy–1) ≥ min {A(x), A(y)} for 
y ≠ 0. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.5: Let F = F0 ⊃ F1 ⊃ … ⊃ Fi ⊃ … be a strictly descending chain of 
subfields of F. Define the fuzzy subset A of F by A(x) = ti – 1 if x ∈ Fi – 1 \ Fi where ti – 1 
< ti < 1 for i = 1, 2, … and A(x) = 1 if x ∈ ∩ Fi. Then A is a fuzzy subfield of F. 
 
Proof: Direct, hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.6: Let F / K be a field extension and let B be a fuzzy subfield of K. Let    
r = inf {B(x) x ∈ K}. Define the fuzzy subset A of F by A(x) = B(x) for all x ∈ K and 
A(x) = m for all x ∈ F \ K where 0 ≤ m ≤ r. Then A is a fuzzy subfield of F. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
The following theorem can be easily proved by any reader. The reader is also advised 
to refer [75] for more information . 
 
THEOREM 1.6.7: If F is a finite field, then every fuzzy subfield of F is finite valued. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.8: Let F/K be a field extension. Then [F : K] < ∞  if and only if every A 
∈ S, (F/K) is finite valued. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.9:  
 
i. Suppose that F has characteristic p > 0. Then F is finite if and only if every 
fuzzy subfield A of F is finite-valued. 
 
ii. Suppose that F has characteristic 0. 
 
Then [F : Q] < ∞  if and only if every fuzzy subfield A of F is finite valued. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.10: Suppose that F/K is finitely generated. Then F/K is algebraic if and 
only if every A ∈ S(F/K) is finite valued. 
 

 
81
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.11: F/K has no proper intermediate fields if and only if every A ∈ 
S(F/K) is three valued or less. 
 
Proof: Please refer [75]. 
 
The following theorem which gives equivalent conditions is left as an exercise for the 
reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.12: The following conditions are equivalent.  
 
i. 
The intermediate fields of F/K are chained.  
ii. 
There exists C ∈ S (F/K) such that for all A ∈ S (F/K). LA ⊆ LC. 
iii. 
For all A, B ∈ S (F/K) and for all At ∈ LA and Bs ∈ LB either At ⊆ Bs or Bs ⊆ At. 
 
We give a necessary and sufficient condition for F/K to be simple. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.13: F/K is simple if and only if there exists c ∈ F such that for all A ∈ 
S (F/K) and for all x ∈ F, A(c) ≤ A(x). 
 
Proof: Direct by the regular computations. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.14: Suppose that [F : K] < ∞. Then the following conditions are 
equivalent. 
 
i. 
F/K has a finite number of intermediate fields. 
ii. 
There exists C1, C2, …, Cn ∈ S(F/K) such that for all A ∈ S(F/K).

i.

Now we proceed on to define the concept of fuzzy bifields. The concept of the 
algebraic structure bifields is itself very new [135]. So the notion of fuzzy bifield is 
defined for the first time in this book. We just for the sake of completeness recall the 
definition of bifields. 
 
DEFINITION 1.6.2: A biring (R, +, y) where R = R1 ∪ R2 is said to be a bifield if (R1, 
+, y) and (R2, +, y) are fields. If the characteristic of both R1 and R2 are finite then we 
say R = R1 ∪ R2 is a bifield of finite characteristic. 
 
If in R = R1 ∪ R2 one of R1 or R2 is a field of characteristic 0 and one of R1 or R2 is of 
finite characteristic we do not associate any characteristic with it. If both R1 or R2 in 
R = R1 ∪ R2 is zero characteristic then we say R is a field of characteristic zero. 
 
Thus unlike in fields we see in case of bifields we can have characteristic prime or 
characteristic zero or no characteristic associated with it. 
 
Example 1.6.1: Let R = Z11 ∪ Q the field of rationals Q and Z11, the prime field of 
characteristic 11. R is a bifield with no characteristic associated with it. 
 
Example 1.6.2: Let R = (
)
Q

Q
∪
. Clearly R is not a bifield as

Q ⊆

Example 1.6.3: Let

Q
R

=
. Clearly R is a bifield of characteristic 0. 
 
Example 1.6.4: Let R = Z11 ∪ Z19; R is a bifield of finite characteristic. 
 
DEFINITION 1.6.3: Let F = F1 ∪ F2 be a bifield, we say a proper subset S of F to be a 
sub-bifield if S = S1 ∪ S2 and S1 is a subfield of F1 and S2 is a subfield of F2. If the 
bifield has no proper sub-bifield then we call F a prime bifield. 
 
Example 1.6.5: Let R = Q ∪ Z7, clearly R is a prime bifield. 
 
Example 1.6.6: Let

 are sub-bifields of R. 
Thus R is not a prime bifield. 
 
DEFINITION 1.6.4: Let (D, +, y) with D = D1 ∪ D2 where (D1, +, y) and (D2, +, y) are 
integral domains then we call D a bidomain. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.16: Let (R, +, y) be a bifield. R = R1 ∪ R2. Now (R[x], +, y) where 
R[x] = R1[x] ∪ R2[x] is a bidomain. 
 
Proof: Straightforward hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
Now having seen the definition of bifield we now define fuzzy bifield. 
 

 
83
DEFINITION 1.6.5: Let (F = F1 ∪ F2 , +, y) be a bifield. µ : F → [0, 1] is said to be a 
fuzzy sub-bifield of the bifield F if there exists two fuzzy subsets µ1 (of F1 ) and µ2 (of 
F2 ) such that  
 
i. 
(µ1 , +, y) is a fuzzy sub-field of (F1 , +, y). 
ii. 
(µ2 , +, y) is a fuzzy sub-field of (F2 , +, y).  
iii. 
µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
DEFINITION 1.6.6: Let (F = F1 ∪ F2 , +, y) be a bifield and (S = S1 ∪ S2 , +, y) be a 
sub-bifield of F. Let B (F/S) denote the set of all fuzzy sub-bifields; A = A1 ∪ A2 of F, 
such that A1≠ ⊇ S1 and A2≠ ⊇ S2. We say A ∈ B (F/S) is finite bivalued if the image of 
A1 is finite and the image of A2 is finite where A = A1 ∪ A2 is a fuzzy sub-bifield. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.17: Let (F = F1 ∪ F2 , +, y) be a finite bifield; then every fuzzy sub-
bifield of F is finite bivalued. 
 
Proof: Follows from the definition.  
 
In view of this we have the following results. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.18: Suppose that (F = F1 ∪ F2 , +, y) has finite characteristic bifield 
(i.e. characteristic of the field F1 is a prime p1 > 0 and the characteristic of the field 
F2 is a prime p2 > 0). Then F is finite if and only if every fuzzy sub-bifield A of F is 
finite valued. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove, following the steps of finite fuzzy subfield. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.19:  
 
i. Let A be a fuzzy subset of the bifield F and s, t ∈ Im (A) the image of A 
where A = A1 ∪ A2, then s ≤ t if and only if As ⊇ At and s = t if and only if 
As = At . (that is  if (A1 ) s ⊃  (A1 ) t  and (A2 ) s  ⊇ (A2 ) t  then only we say As 
⊇ At , similarly for As = At ). 
 
ii. If A is a fuzzy sub-bifield of F (A = A1 ∪ A2 and F = F1 ∪ F2) then for all x 
∈ F = F1 ∪ F2, x ≠ 0 we have Ai(x) ≥ Ai(1) ≥ Ai(x) = Ai (–x) = Ai(x–1) for i 
= 1, 2.  
 
Proof: Direct as in case of fuzzy fields. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.20: Let A = A1 ∪ A2 be a fuzzy subset of F = F1 ∪ F2 . If At = (A1)t ∪ 
(A2)t is a sub-bifield of F for all t ∈ Im(A)I then A is a fuzzy sub-bifield of the bifield F.  
 
Conversely if A = A1 ∪ A2 is a fuzzy sub-bifield of F = F1 ∪ F2 then for all t such that 
0 ≤ t ≤ Ai (1), i = 1, 2; At is a sub-bifield of F. If A is a fuzzy sub-bifield of F, then At is 
called a level sub-bifield of F where 0 < t < A(1). 
 

 
84
THEOREM 1.6.21: Let S = S1 ∪ S2 be a subset of the bifield F = F1 ∪ F2 i.e. (S1 is a 
subset of F1 and S2 is a subset of F2) such that

DEFINITION 1.6.7: Let F = F1 ∪ F2 be a bifield. Suppose S1 ⊂ S2 ⊂ …⊂ Sn ⊂ … be a 
strictly ascending chain of sub-bifield of F such that ∪ Si = F where Si = Si1 ∪ Si2 for i 
= 1, 2, …(i.e. S1 = S11 ∪ S12 is a sub-bifield) i.e. each S11 ⊂ S21 ⊂ S31 ⊂ …⊂ Sn1 ⊂ … 
is a strictly ascending chain of subfields of F1 and S12 ⊂ S22 ⊂ S32 ⊂ …⊂ Sn2 ⊂ … is a 
strictly ascending chain of subfields of F2. Define the fuzzy subset A = A1 ∪ A2 of F = 
F1 ∪ F2 by A(x) = ti if x ∈ Sij \ Si–1j; j = 1, 2; where ti > ti+1 for i = 1, 2, … and S01 = φ 
and S02 = φ. Then A is a fuzzy sub-bifield of F. 
 
The proof of the following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.22: Let F = F1 ∪ F2 be a bifield F = S0 ⊃ S1 ⊃ … be a strictly 
descending chain of sub-bifields of F. Define the fuzzy subset A = A1 ∪ A2 of F by 
A(x) = ti–1  if  x ∈  Si–1 j \ Sij  where ti–1  <  ti < 1 for i = 0, 1, 2, …   and A(x)  =  1  if         
x ∈ ∩ Sij. j = 1, 2 and 0 ≤ i ≤ n. Then A is a fuzzy sub-bifield of F. 
 
THEOREM 1.6.23: Let F/K be a bifield extension and let B be a fuzzy sub-bifield of K. 
Let r = inf {B(x) x ∈ K}. Define the fuzzy subset A of F by A(x) = B(x) for all x ∈ K 
and A(x) = m for all x ∈ F\K; where 0 ≤ m ≤ r. Then A is a fuzzy sub-bifield of F. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of subfield.  
 
Thus all results regarding fuzzy sub-bifields can be defined and obtained in an 
analogous way as in case of fuzzy subfields. These concepts will be once again used 
in case of fuzzy bivector spaces. 
 
 
1.7 Fuzzy Semirings and their generalizations 
 
In this section we introduce the notion of fuzzy semirings and fuzzy sub-birings. The 
study of fuzzy k-ideals in semirings started in 1985 [31] followed by several authors. 
Even [19] has studied about it. But the notion of fuzzy bisemirings in literature is 
totally absent. This concept is defined only in this book. Just for the sake of 
completeness we start to give the definition of fuzzy semirings and proceed on. 
 
An algebra (S, +, y) is said to be a semiring if (S, +) is a semigroup with identity 0 and 
(S, y) is a semigroup, satisfying the following conditions 
 
i. a y (b + c) = a y b + a y c 
ii. (b + c) y a = b y a + b y a 
 
for all a, b, c ∈ S. 

 
85
 
A semiring S may have the identity 1 defined by 1 y a = a y 1 = a and a zero 0 defined 
by 0 + a = a + 0 = a for all a ∈ S and 0 y a = a y 0 = 0. We say the semiring (S, +, y) is 
abelian if a y b = b y a for all a, b ∈ S. We say the semiring S is strict if a + b = 0 
forces a = 0 and b = 0. Let (S, +, y) be a semiring if a y b = 0 in S implies a = 0 or b = 
0 for a, b ∈ S \ {0} then we say the semiring (S, +, y) is a semidivision ring.  
 
If (S, +, y) is commutative semiring with no zero divisions which is strict then we say 
(S, +, y) is a semifield. 
 
Example 1.7.1: Let Z+ ∪ {0} = S. (S, +, y) is a semifield (Z+, set of positive integers).

Example 1.7.4: Let C11 be the chain lattice with 11 elements, C11 is a finite semiring 
in fact a finite semifield.  
 
We denote the order of the semiring S by |S| or o(S), if |S| = ∞ we say the semiring is 
of infinite order otherwise S is of finite order if |S| < ∞. 
 
Now we proceed on to define left (right) ideal in a semiring. Finally we define left k-
ideal of the semiring S. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.1: Let R be a semiring. A non-empty subset I of R is said to be left 
(resp, right) ideal if x, y ∈ I and r ∈ I imply x + y ∈ I and r x ∈ I (resp. x r ∈ I). If I is 
both left and right ideal if R, we say I is a two sided ideal or simply ideal of R. A left 
ideal I of a semiring R is said to be a left k-ideal if a ∈ I and x ∈ R and if a + x ∈ I or 
x + a ∈ I then x ∈ I. Right k-ideal is defined dually and two-sided k-ideal or simply a 
k-ideal is both a left and a right k-ideal. A mapping f : R → S is said to be a 
homomorphism if f (x + y) = f(x) + f(y) and f(xy) = f (x) f (y) for all x, y ∈ R. We note 
that if f : R → S is an onto homomorphism and I is left (resp. right) ideal of R, then 
f(I) is a left (resp. right) ideal of S. 
 
Now we proceed on to recall the definition of fuzzy ideal of a semiring.

DEFINITION 1.7.2: A fuzzy subset µ of a semiring R is said to be a fuzzy left (resp. 
right) ideal of R if µ(x + y) ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)} and µ(xy) ≥ µ(y) (resp. µ(xy) ≥ µ(x)) for 
all x, y ∈ R. µ is a fuzzy ideal of R if it is both a fuzzy left and a fuzzy right ideal of R. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.3: A fuzzy ideal µ of a semiring R is said to be a fuzzy k-ideal of R if 
µ(x) ≥ min {max {µ (x + y), µ (y + x)}, µ (y)}}  for all x, y ∈ R. 
 
It is left for the reader to prove the following theorem: 
 
THEOREM 1.7.1: Every fuzzy ideal of a semiring is a fuzzy k-ideal. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.2: Let I be a non-empty subset of a semiring R and λI the characteristic 
function of I. Then I is a k-ideal of R if and only if λI is a fuzzy k-ideal of R. 
 
Proof: The reader is advised to give the proof as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.3: A fuzzy subset µ of R is a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R if and 
only if for any t ∈ [0, 1] such that µ t  ≠  φ, µ t  is a left (resp. right) k-ideal of R, where 
µ t = {x ∈ R µ(x) ≥ t}, which is called a level subset of µ. 
 
Proof: For proof please refer [52]. 
 
Note that if µ is a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R then the set Rµ = {x ∈ R | µ(x) ≥ 
µ(0)} is a left (resp. right) k-ideal of R. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.4: Let I be any left (resp. right) k-ideal of R. Then there exists a fuzzy 
left (resp. right) k-ideal µ of R such that µ t = I for some t ∈ [0, 1]. 
 
Proof: If we define a fuzzy subset of R by 
 
µ(x) =

Since I and R itself are left (resp. right) k-ideals of R, it follows that every non-empty 
level subset µs of µ is left (resp. right) k-ideal of R. Thus by the earlier theorem µ is a 
fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R proving the theorem. 
 
Let µ and δ be fuzzy subsets of the semiring R. We denote that µ ⊆ δ if and only if 
µ(x) ≤ δ(x) for all x ∈ R and µ ⊂ δ if and only if µ ⊆ δ and µ ≠ δ. 
 

 
87
THEOREM 1.7.5: Let µ be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R. Then two level left 
(resp. right) k-ideals µs , µt (with s < t in [0, 1] ) of µ are equal if and only if there is 
no x ∈ R such that s ≤ µ(x) < t.  
 
Proof: Suppose s < t in [0, 1] and µ s = µ t. If there exists an x ∈ R such that s ≤ µ(x) < 
t, then µ t is a proper subset of µ s, a contradiction. Conversely, suppose that there is 
no x ∈ R such that s ≤ µ(x) < t. Note that s < t implies µ t ⊆ µ s. If x ∈ µs, then µ(x) ≥ s 
and so µ(x) ≥ t because µ(x) </  t. Hence x ∈ µ t and µ s = µ t. This completes the proof. 
 
For more about these concepts please refer [52]. Now for a given fuzzy k-ideal µ of a 
semiring R we denote by Im (µ) the image set of µ. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.6: Let µ be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R. If Im(µ) = {t1 , t2 , …, 
tn } where t1 < t2 < …< tn , then the family of left (resp. right) k-ideals

 constitutes the collection of all left (resp. right) ideals of µ. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader and requested to refer [52]. 
 
Now we proceed on to study some more notions. 
 
Given any two sets R and S, let µ be a fuzzy subset of R and let f : R → S be any 
function. We define a fuzzy subset δ on S by  
 
 
δ(y) =

and we call δ the image of µ under f, written f (µ). For any fuzzy subset δ on f(R) we 
define a fuzzy subset µ on R by µ(x) = δ(f(x)) for all x ∈ R, and we call µ the pre-
image of δ under f which is denoted by f –1(δ). 
 
THEOREM 1.7.7: An onto homomorphic pre image of a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal 
is a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal. 
 
Proof: Let f : R → S be an onto homomorphism. Let δ be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-
ideal on S and let µ be the pre image of δ under f. Then it was proved that µ is a fuzzy 
left (resp. right) ideal of R. 
 
For any x, y ∈ δ we have  
 
µ(x)  = 
 δ(f(x)) ≥ min {max {δ(f(x) + f(y)), δ(f(y) + f(x))}, δf (y))} 
=  
min{max { δ(f (x + y)), δ(f(x + y))}, δ(f(y))} 
=  
min{max { µ (x + y), µ (y + x)}, µ(y)}} 
 
proving that µ is a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R.

Proof: Straightforward, hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.9: Let f : R → S be an onto homomorphism and let µ be a fuzzy left 
(resp. right) k-ideal of R. Then the homomorphic image f(µ) of µ under f is a fuzzy left 
(resp. right) k-ideal of S. 
 
Proof: The proof can be got as a matter of routine; hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.4: A left (resp.right) k-ideal I of R is said to be characteristic, if f(I) = 
I for all f ∈ Aut (R), where Aut (R) is the set of all automorphisms of R. A fuzzy left 
(resp. right) k-ideal µ of R is said to be  fuzzy characteristic if µ(f(x)) = µ(x) for all     
x ∈ R and f ∈ Aut ( R). 
 
THEOREM 1.7.10: Let µ be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R and let f : R → R be 
an onto homomorphism. Then the mapping µ f: R → [0, 1] defined by µ f(x) = µ(f(x)) 
for all x ∈ R is a fuzzy left (resp. right ) k-ideal of R. 
 
Proof: It is a matter of routine once we write µf(x) = µ (f(x)) ≥ min {max {µ (f(x) + 
f(y)), µ (f(y) + f(x))}, µ(f(y))}. 
 
The simplifications are direct and simple and hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
The following theorems are also straightforward hence stated without proof; so that 
the interested reader can do them. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.11: If µ is fuzzy characteristic left (resp. right) k-ideal of R , then each 
level left (resp.right) k-ideal of µ is characteristic. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.12: Let µ be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R and let x ∈ R. Then 
µ(x) = t if and only if x ∈ µ t  and x ∉ µ s   for all s > t. 
 
We recall the proof of the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.13: Let µ be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-ideal of R. If each level left 
(resp right) k-ideal of µ is a characteristic then µ is fuzzy characteristic. 
 
Proof: Let x ∈ R and f ∈ Aut (R ). If µ (x) = t ∈ [0, 1], then by the just above theorem 
we have x ∈ µt and x ∉ µs for all s > t. 
 
Since each level left (resp right) k-ideal of µ is characteristic, f (x) ∈ f (µ t) = µ t. 
Assume µ (f(x)) = s > t. Then f(x) ∈ µs = f(µs). Since f is one to one it follows that x 
∈µs, a contradiction. Hence µ (f(x)) = t = µ (x) showing that µ is fuzzy characteristic .

Now we proceed on to define fuzzy notions on bisemirings. As bisemirings 
themselves are very new much so is the concept of fuzzy bisemiring. Just we recall 
the definitions of them. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.5: Let (S, +, y) be a non-empty set with two binary operations ‘+’ 
and ‘y’. We call (S, +, y) a bisemiring if  
 
i. 
S = S1 ∪ S2 where both S1 and S2 are distinct subsets of S,  S1 ⊄ S2 
and S2 ⊄ S1. 
ii. 
(S1, +, y) is a semiring. 
iii. 
(S2, +, y) is a semiring. 
 
Example 1.7.5: S = Z0 ∪ C2 where C2 is a chain lattice of order 2 and Z0 is a 
semiring, thus S is a bisemiring. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.6: Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. If the number of elements in S is 
finite we call S a finite bisemiring. If the number of elements in S is infinite we say S is 
an infinite bisemiring. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.7: Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. We say S is a commutative 
bisemiring if both the semirings S1 and S2 are commutative otherwise we say the 
bisemiring S is a non-commutative bisemiring. Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. We say S 
is a strict bisemiring if both S1 and S2 are strict bisemirings where S = S1 ∪ S2. Let (S, 
+, y) be a bisemiring if 0 ≠ x ∈ S be a zero divisor if there exists a y ≠ 0 ∈ S such that 
x y y = 0. We say a bisemiring S has a unit 1 in S if a y 1 = 1 y a = a for all a ∈ S. Let 
(S, +, y) is a bisemiring we say S is a bisemifield if S1 is a semifield and S2 is a 
semifield where S = S1 ∪ S2. If both S1 and S2 are non-commutative semirings with no 
zero divisors then we call S = S1 ∪ S2 to be a bisemidivision ring. It is to be noted that 
even if one of S1 or S2 is non-commutative with no zero divisors but other is a 
semifield still S is a bisemidivision ring. 
 
Example 1.7.6: (S, +, y) is a bisemiring. S = S1 ∪ S2 where S1 = C7 and S2 is the 
lattice given by  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
then S is only a bisemiring which is not a semifield. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.8: Let (S = S1 ∪ S2, +, y) be a bisemiring which is commutative and 
has unit element. The polynomial bisemiring is denoted by S[x] = S1[x] ∪ S2[x] where 
S1[x] and S2[x] are polynomial semirings.

DEFINITION 1.7.9: Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. (P, +, y) be a proper sub-bisemiring 
of S. We call P a bi-ideal if for all s ∈ S and p ∈ P, sp and ps ∈ P i.e. P = P1 ∪ P2 
with si ∈ Si, pi si and si pi ∈ Pi ; i = 1, 2. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.10: Let (S, +, y) and (S', +, y) be two bisemirings, where S = S1 ∪ S2

S′  is a semiring homomorphism or φ1 : S1 → 
2
S′  and φ2 : S2 →

S′  is a semiring homomorphism where we denote φ just by default of notation as φ = 
φ1 ∪ φ2.  
 
As our motivation is to define fuzzy bisemirings as fuzzy bisemirings is not defined 
till date we give importance only to the study of fuzzy bisemirings and Smarandache 
fuzzy bisemirings. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.11: (S = S1 ∪ S2 , +, y) is a bisemiring. We say µ : S → [0, 1] is a 
fuzzy bisemiring, µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 where both µ1 : S1 → [0, 1] and µ2 : S2 → [0, 1] are 
fuzzy semirings. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy bi-ideals in a bisemiring. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.12: A fuzzy subset µ of a bisemiring (S = S1 ∪ S2 , +, y) is said to be a 
fuzzy left (resp. right) bi-ideal of S if µ : S→ [0, 1] such that µ(x + y) ≥ min {µ(x) + 
µ(y)}, and µ (xy) > µ (y) (resp. µ (xy) > µ (x)) for all x, y ∈ S. µ is a fuzzy bi-ideal of S 
if it is both a fuzzy left and fuzzy right bi-ideal of S = S1 ∪ S2. 
 
µ1 : S1→ [0, 1] and 
µ2 : S2→ [0, 1] where µ1 and µ2 are fuzzy ideals of the semirings S1 and S2. 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.13: A fuzzy ideal µ of a bisemiring (S, +, y) is said to be a fuzzy k-
ideal of S if µ (x) ≥ min {{max µ(x + y), µ(y + x)}, µ(y)} for all x, y ∈ S. i.e. µ (x) ≥ 
min {max µ1 (x + y), µ1(y + x)}, µ1(y)} ∪ min{max µ2(x + y), µ2(y + x)}, µ2(y)} for all 
x, y ∈ S1 (x, y ∈ S2 ) where S = S1 ∪ S2. If S is additively commutative then the 
condition reduces to µ(x) ≥ min{µ (x + y), µ(y)} for all x, y ∈ S; where µ(x) = µ1(x) ∪ 
µ2(x) ≥ min {µ1(y + x)}, µ1(y)} ∪ min {µ2(x + y), µ2(y)} for all x, y ∈ S1 (x, y ∈ S2 ). 
 
DEFINITION 1.7.14: Let I = I1 ∪ I2 be a non-empty subset of a bisemiring S = S1 ∪ S2 
and λI = 
2
1
I
I
λ
λ ∪
 the characteristic function of I = I1 ∪ I2.  
 
(Here 
1Iλ the characteristic function of I1 and 
2Iλ the characteristic function of I2). 
Then I = I1 ∪ I2 is a k-bi-ideal of S = S1 ∪ S2 if and only if λI is a fuzzy k-bi-ideal of S 
= S1 ∪ S2.  
 
Now we proceed on to give some interesting results on bi-ideals. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.14: A fuzzy subset µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of S = S1 ∪ S2 is a fuzzy left (resp. 
right) k-bi-ideal of S if and only if for any t ∈ [0, 1] such that µt ≠ φ (µt = (µ1)t ∪ 

 
91
(µ2)t) µt is left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of S = S1 ∪ S2 where µt = {x ∈ S µ(x) ≥ t} =    
{x ∈ S1 µ1(x) ≥ t} ∪ {x ∈ S2 µ2(x) ≥ t} which is called a level subset of µ. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of semirings, by taking each µi ; i = 1, 2. Then as µ = µ1 ∪ 
µ2 we get the desired result. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.15: Let I be any left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of S = S1 ∪ S2. Then there 
exists a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of S = S1 ∪ S2 such that µt = 
(µ1)t ∪ (µ2)t ; I = I1 ∪ I2 for some t ∈ [0, 1].

The result follows as in case of fuzzy semiring. 
 
Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 and δ = δ1 ∪ δ2 be fuzzy subsets of S = S1 ∪ S2. We say µ ⊆ δ if and 
only if (µ1 ⊂ δ1, µ2 ⊂ δ2) if and only if µ(x) ≤ δ(x), µ1(x) ≤ δ1(x), µ2(x) ≤ δ2(x)) for all 
x ∈ S and µ ⊂ δ if and only if µ ⊆ δ and µ ≠ δ. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.16: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of S = S1 ∪ 
S2. Then two level left (resp. right) k-bi-ideals µs , µt (with s < t in [0, 1] ) of µ = µ1 ∪ 
µ2 are equal if and only if there is no x ∈ S such that s ≤ µ(x) < t (i.e. s ≤ µ1(x) < t and 
s ≤ µ2(x) < t) . 
 
Proof: As in case of semirings. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.17: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of S = S1 ∪

Given any two sets R = R1 ∪ R2 and S = S1 ∪ S2, let µ be a fuzzy subset of R and let

and we call δ = δ1 ∪ δ2 the image of µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 under f = f1 ∪ f2 written as f(µ) = 
f1(µ1) ∪ f2(µ2). for any fuzzy subset δ on f (R) = f1 (R1) ∪ f2 (R2) we define fuzzy 
subset µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 on R = R1 ∪ R2 by µ(x) = δf(x) i.e. µ(x) = µ1 (x) ∪ µ2 (x) where 
µ1(x) = δ1 (f1 (x)) for x ∈ R1 and µ2 (x) = δ2 (f2 (x)) for x ∈ R2 and we call µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 
the pre image of δ = δ1 ∪ δ2 under f = f1 ∪ f2 which is denoted by f –1(δ) = 
1
1f −(δ1) ∪ 
1
2f −(δ2) . 
 
Now we state the following theorem on pre image. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.18: An onto homomorphism pre image of a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-
ideal is a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal. 
 
Proof: f : R → S be an onto homomorphism of the bisemirings R and S where R = R1 
∪ R2 and S = S1 ∪ S2 , f = f1 ∪ f2 . f1 : R1 → S1 and f2 : R2 → S2 be onto semiring 
homomorphism. Let δ be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal on S = S1 ∪ S2 and let µ 
= µ1 ∪ µ2 be the pre image of δ under f. Then it was proved that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a 
fuzzy left (resp. right) bi-ideal of R = R1 ∪ R2. For any x, y ∈ S = S1 ∪ S2 we have 
µ(x) = δ(f(x) proving µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.19: Let f = f1 ∪  f2 be a mapping from a set X = X1 ∪ X2 to a set Y = Y1 
∪ Y2 and let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy subset X = X1 ∪ X2. Then for every t ∈ (0, 1].

THEOREM 1.7.20: Let f : R → S ( f = f1 ∪ f2 , R = R1 ∪ R2 , S = S1 ∪ S2 , f1: R1 → S1 ; 
f2 :R2 → S2) be an onto homomorphism, let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy left (respectively 
right) k-bi-ideal of R = R1 ∪ R2. Then the homomorphic image f(µ) = f1 (µ1 ) ∪ f2 (µ2 ) 
of µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 under f = f1 ∪ f2 is a fuzzy left (resp. right ) k-bi-ideal of S = S1 ∪ S2 .

DEFINITION 1.7.15: A left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal I = I1 ∪ I2 of the bisemiring R = R1 
∪ R2 is said to be characteristic if f(I) = I i.e. f1(I1) = I1 and f2(I2) = I2 for all f = f1 ∪ 
f2 ∈ Aut (R ) where Aut ( R) is the set of all automorphism of R = R1 ∪ R2. A fuzzy left 
(resp. right) k-bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of R = R1 ∪ R2 is said to be a fuzzy characteristic 
if µ(f(x)) = µ(x) (i.e. µ1 (f1(x)) = µ1(x); µ2 (f2(x)) = µ2(x)) for all x ∈ R1 (x ∈ R2 and     
f1 ∈ Aut(R1) and f2 ∈ Aut(R2), f = f1 ∪  f2. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.21: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of R = R1 ∪ 
R2 and let f : R → R be an onto homomorphism here f = f1 ∪ f2; f1 : R1 → R1 and

THEOREM 1.7.22: If µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a fuzzy characteristic left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal

The following theorem is as easy consequence of the above theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.23: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of the 
bisemiring of R = R1 ∪ R2 and let x ∈ R. Then µ(x) = t if and only if x ∈ µt and x ∉ µs 
for all s > t. (x ∈ R1 then µ1(x) = t, x ∈ (µ1)t and x ∉ (µ1)s for all s > t), if  x ∈ R2 then 
µ2(x) = t, x ∈ (µ2)t and x ∉ (µ2)s for all s > t).  
 
Proof: Follows as in case of semirings. 
 
THEOREM 1.7.24: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a fuzzy left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of the 
bisemiring of R = R1 ∪ R2. If each level left (resp. right) k-bi-ideal of µ is 
characteristic then µ is fuzzy characteristic. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of semirings. 
 
All results can be got in case of fuzzy bisemirings but as the main motivation is only 
study of Smarandache fuzzy semirings we do not exhaust all results regarding the 
fuzzy semirings or fuzzy bisemirings. 
 
Any matrix A in Mn (F) will be called a fuzzy matrix we may call Mn (F) a fuzzy 
matrix semiring. Several results can be had in this direction.

Further the fuzzy semirings can be utilized in constraint handling rules. For more 
about this please refer [51-54]. All applications of fuzzy semirings can be had from 
other research papers. 
 
 
1.8 Fuzzy near-rings and their properties 
 
In this section we recall the definition of fuzzy near-ring, give some new types of 
fuzzy near-rings and introduce the notion of fuzzy bi near-rings. Also notions like 
Fuzzy near-ring module and fuzzy congruence of a near-ring module are recalled in 
this section. For more about fuzzy near-ring literature please refer [28, 38, 56, 57, 71, 
122, 130].  
 
DEFINITION [71]: Let R be a near-ring and N a fuzzy set in R. Then N is called a fuzzy 
near-ring in R if 
 
i. 
N (x + y) ≥ min {N(x), N(y)}. 
ii. 
N (–x) ≥ N (x). 
iii. 
N (xy) ≥ min {N(x), N(y)} for all x, y in R. 
 
DEFINITION [71]: Let R be a near-ring and N a fuzzy near-ring in R. Let Y be a near-
ring module over R and M a fuzzy set in Y. Then M is called a fuzzy near-ring module 
in Y if  
 
i. 
M (x + y) ≥ min {M(x), M(y)}. 
ii. 
M (λx) ≥ min { N ( λ), M(x)} for all x, y ∈ Y and λ ∈ R. 
iii. 
M(0) = 1. 
 
If N is an ordinary near-ring then condition (ii) in the above definition is replaced by  
 
ii(a).    M(λx) > M(x) for all λ ∈ N and for all x ∈ Y. 
 
THEOREM [71]: Let Y be a near-ring module over a fuzzy near-ring N in R. Then M is 
a fuzzy near-ring module in Y if and only if M ( λ(x) + µ(x)) ≥ min {min {N (λ), M(x)}, 
min {N(µ), M(y)}} for all λ, µ ∈ N and for all x, y ∈ Y. 
 
If N is an ordinary near-ring then the above condition is replaced by M (λx + µ y) ≥ 
min{{M (x), N(y)} for all x, y ∈ Y. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise as it can be got directly by the definitions. 
 
THEOREM [71]: Let Y be a near-ring module over a near-ring R with identity. If M is 
a fuzzy near-ring module in Y and if λ ∈ R is invertible then M(λx) = M(x) for all       
x ∈ Y. 
 
Proof: If λ ∈ M is invertible then we have for all x ∈ Y. M(x) = M (λ–1 λx) ≥ M(λx) 
≥ M(x) and so M(λx) = M(x).

THEOREM [71]: Let Y and W be near-ring modules over a fuzzy near-ring N in a 
near-ring R and θ a homomorphism of Y into W. Let M be a fuzzy near-ring module in 
W. Then the inverse image θ –1(M) of M is a fuzzy near-ring module in Y. 
 
Proof: For all x, y ∈ Y and for all λ, µ ∈ R, we have 
 
θ–1 (M) (λx + µy)

M(θ(λx + µy))

By earlier theorems θ–1(M) is a fuzzy near-ring module in Y. Hence the theorem.

exists to ∈ T such that

THEOREM [71]: Let Y and W be near-ring modules over a fuzzy near-ring N in a 
near-ring R and θ a homomorphism of Y into W. Let W be a fuzzy near-ring module in 
Y that has the sup property. Then the image θ (M) of M is a fuzzy near-ring module in 
W. 
 
Proof: Let µ, ν ∈W. It either θ–1(µ) or θ–1(ν) is empty, then the result holds good. 
Suppose that neither θ–1(µ) nor θ–1(ν) is empty, then we have θ(M)(λ(u) + µν) =

Throughout the discussion from now on by a near-ring R we mean a system with two 
binary operations addition and multiplication such that 
 
i. 
The elements of R form a group under ‘+’. 
ii. 
The elements of R form a semigroup under multiplication 'y'. 
iii. 
x y (y + z) = x y y + x y z for all x, y, z ∈ R. 
 
An R-module that is near-ring module is a system consisting of an additive group M, 
a near-ring R, and a mapping (m, r) → mr of M × R into M such that  
 
i. 
m (x + y) = mx + my for all m ∈ M and for all x, y ∈ R. 
ii. 
m(xy) = (mx)y for all m ∈ M and for all x, y ∈ R. 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.1: An R-homomorphism f of an R-module M into an R-module M' is a 
mapping from M to M' such that (m1 + m2 ) f = m1 f + m2 f and ( mf ) r = (mr) f for all 
m, m1 , m2 ∈ M and for all r ∈ R . 
 
The submodules of an R-module M are defined to be kernels of R-homomorphism. 
 
THEOREM [22]: An additive normal subgroup B of an R-module M is a submodule if 
and only if, (m + b)r – mr ∈ B for all m ∈ M, b ∈ B and r ∈ R . 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.2: A relation ρ on an R-module M is called a congruence on M if it is 
an equivalence relation on M such that (a, b) ∈ ρ and (c, d) ∈ ρ imply that (a + c, b + 
d) ∈ ρ and (ar, br) ∈ ρ for all a, b, c, d in M and for all r in R . 
 
DEFINITION [98]: A non empty fuzzy subset µ of an additive group G is called a fuzzy 
normal subgroup of G if 
 
i. 
µ (x + y) ≥ min {µ (x) , µ(y)} for all x, y in G. 
ii. 
µ (–x) = µ(x) for all x ∈ G. 
iii. 
µ (y + x – y) = µ(x) for all x, y in G. 

 
97
 
Let µ be a fuzzy normal subgroup of an additive group G and x ∈ G. Then the fuzzy 
subset x + µ of G defined by (x + µ) (x) = µ (y – x) for all y in G is called the fuzzy 
coset of µ . 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.3: Let µ be a non-empty fuzzy subset of an R-module M. Then µ is 
said to be a fuzzy submodule of M if 
 
i. µ is a fuzzy normal subgroup of M and 
ii. µ {(x + y) r – x r} ≥ µ (y) for all x, y in M and for all r in R . 
 
The proof of the following two theorems are omitted as they can be easily obtained by 
the reader using direct methods. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.1: Let B be a non-empty subset of an R-module M. Then the 
characteristic function χg is a fuzzy submodule of M if and only if B is a submodule of 
M. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.2: Let µ be a fuzzy submodule of an R-module M. Then the level subset 
µt = {x ∈ M | µ (x) ≥ t}, t ∈ Im µ is a submodule of M. 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.4: Let µ be a fuzzy submodule of an R-module M. Then the 
submodules µI’s are called level submodules of M. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.3: For a non-empty fuzzy subset µ of an R-module M, the following 
assertions are equivalent 
 
i. 
µ is a fuzzy submodule of M. 
ii. 
The level subsets µt, t ∈ Im µ are submodules of M. 
 
Proof: It is a simple matter of routine. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.4: If µ is a fuzzy normal subgroup of an additive group G. Then x + µ 
= y + µ if and only if µ(x – y) = µ(0) for all x, y in G. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.5: Let µ be a fuzzy submodule of an R-module M. Then the set M / µ of 
all fuzzy cosets of µ is an R-module with respect to the operations defined by (x + µ) 
+ (y + µ) = (x + y) + µ and (x + µ) r = xr + µr for all x, y in M and for all r in R. If f 
is a mapping from M to M/ µ, defined by xf = x + µ for all x ∈ M then f is an R-
epimorphism with ker f = { x ∈ Mµ(x) = µ (0)}. 
 
Proof: Please refer [28, 39].

Thus µα is a fuzzy submodule of M. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.7: Let µ be a fuzzy submodule of an R-module M. Let αµ be the fuzzy 
relation on M, defined by αµ (x, y) = µ(x – y) for x, y in M. Then αµ is a fuzzy 
congruence on M. 
 
Proof: Since µ is non-empty it follows that αµ is non empty. Now αµ (x, x) = µ (0) ≥ 
µ (y – z) for all y, z in M = αµ (y,z). So  
 
αµ (x, x) = 
)z

Thus αµ is fuzzy reflexive. It is clear that αµ is fuzzy symmetric. Again αµ (x, y) = 
µ(x – y) = µ (x – z + z – y) ≥ Min [µ (x – z), µ (z – y)] for all z in M. So  
 
αµ (x, y)  ≥

Thus αµ is a fuzzy equivalence relation on M. 
 
Now 
 
αµ (x + u, y + ν)  
= 
µ (x + u – ν – y) 
 
 
= 
µ (–y + x + u – ν) 
 
 
 
 
≥ 
Min [µ (–y + x), µ (u – ν)] 
 
 
 
  
= 
Min [µ (x – y), µ (u – ν)] 
 
  
= 
Min [αµ (x, y) , αµ (u, ν)]. 
 
Again xµ (xr, yr) = µ(xr – yr) = µ{(y – y + x) r – yr} ≥ µ(–y + x) = µ(x – y) = αµ(x, y). 
Hence αµ is a fuzzy congruence on M. 
 
Note: αµ is called the fuzzy congruence induced by µ and µα is called the fuzzy 
submodule induced by α. 
 
Here in the following theorem FS (M) set of all fuzzy submodules of M and FC (M) 
the set of all fuzzy congruences on M. The reader is expected to refer [28] for proof. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.8: Let M be an R-module. Then there exists an inclusion preserving 
bijection from the set FS(M) of all fuzzy submodules of M to the set FC(M) of all fuzzy 
congruences on M. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.9: Let α be a fuzzy congruences on an R-module M and µα be the fuzzy 
submodule induced by α. Let t ∈ Im α. Then (µ α ) t = {x ∈ M x ≡ 0 (α t ) } is the 
submodule induced by the congruence α t . 
 

 
100
Proof: Let a ∈ M. Now a ∈(µα)t if and only if (µα) (a) ≥ t if and only if α(a, 0) ≥ if 
and only if (a, 0) ∈ αt if and only if α ∈ 0(αt) if and only if α ∈ {x ∈ M x ≡ 0(αt)}. 
Hence the theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.10: Let µ be a fuzzy submodule of an R-module M and αµ be the fuzzy 
congruence induced by µ . Let t ∈ Im µ . Then (αµ )t is the congruence on M induced 
by µt. 
 
Proof: Let β be the congruence on the R-module M induced by µt . (x, y) ∈ β if and 
only if x – y ∈ µ t.  Let  (x, y)  ∈  (α µ ) t. Therefore (α µ ) (x, y) ≥ t ⇒ µ (x – y) ≥ t ⇒ 
(x – y) ∈ µ t ⇒ (x, y) ∈ β. Thus (α µ) t ⊆ β. By reversing the above argument we get β 
⊆ (α µ ). Hence (α µ) t = β. 
 
DEFINITION [28]: Let M be an R-module and α be a fuzzy congruence on M. A fuzzy 
congruence β on M is said to be α-invariant if α (x, y) = α (u,ν) implies that β (x, y) 
= β (u,ν) for all (x, y),(u, ν) ∈ M × M. 
 
THEOREM [28]: Let M be a R-module and µ be a fuzzy submodule of M. Let α be the 
fuzzy congruence on M induced by µ. Then the fuzzy relation α / α on M / µ defined 
by α / α (x + µ, y + µ) = α (x, y) is a fuzzy congruence on M / µ . 
 
Proof: Assume that x + µ = u + µ and y + µ = u + µ . Then µ (x – u) = µ(0) and µ(y – 
ν) = µ (0).

Similarly α(u, ν) ≥ α(x, y). Thus α(x, y) = α(u, ν). Thus, α / α is meaningful. Rest of 
the proof is a matter of routine verification. 
 
THEOREM [28]: Let M be an R-module and µ be a fuzzy submodule of M. Let α be a 
the fuzzy congruence on M induced by µ. Then there exists a one to one 
correspondence between the set FCα (M) of α-invariant fuzzy congruences on M and 
the set FCα / α (M / µ) of α /α invariant fuzzy congruences on M / µ . 
 
Proof: Refer [28].

THEOREM 1.8.11: Let M be an R-module and µ be a fuzzy submodule of M. Let α be 
the fuzzy congruence on M induced by µ . Let t = sup Im α then M/ µ ≅ 
t
/
M
α  . 
 
Proof: We define a mapping θ: M/µ→M/αt by (x +y) θ = x αt where x αt denotes the 
congruence class containing x of the congruence αt, x + µ = y + µ ⇒ µ(x – y) = µ(0) 
= α(x, y) = sup Im α = t ⇒ (x, y) ∈ αt ⇒ xαt = yαt ⇒ (x + µ) θ = (y + µ)θ. So θ is 
well defined.  
 
Now (x + µ + y + µ) θ = (x + y + µ) θ = (x + y) αt = x αt + y αt = (x + µ)θ + (y + µ) θ 
and ((x + µ) r) θ = (x r + µ) θ = (x r) αt = (x αt )r = ((x + µ) θ) r. 
 
Therefore θ is an R-homomorphism. Again (x + µ) θ = (y + µ) θ ⇒ xαt = y αt = (x, y) 
∈ αt ⇒ α (x, y) = t ⇒ µ (x – y) = t ⇒ µ (x – y) = α(0, 0) = µ(0) which implies that    
x + µ = y + µ. So θ is injective. Obviously θ is surjective. Hence the result. 
 
DEFINITION [56]: Let R be a near-ring and let µ be a fuzzy set in R. We say that µ is a 
fuzzy subnear-ring of R if for all x, y ∈ R. 
 
i. µ (x –y) ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)}. 
ii. µ(xy) ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)}. 
 
If a fuzzy set µ in a near-ring R satisfies the property µ(x – y) ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)} then 
letting x = y; µ(0) > µ (x) for all x ∈ R. 
 
DEFINITION [1]: Let (R, +,y) be a near-ring. A fuzzy set µ in R is called a fuzzy right 
(resp. left) R-subgroup of R if 
 
i. µ is a fuzzy subgroup of (R ,+). 
ii. µ(xr) ≥ µ (x) (resp. µ(rx) ≥ µ (x)) for all r, x ∈ R . 
 
Example [56]: Let R = {a, b, c, d} be a set with two binary operations as follows.

Then (R, +, y) is a near-ring. We define a fuzzy set µ: R → [0,1] by µ(c ) = µ(d) < 
µ(b) < µ(a). Then µ is a fuzzy subgroup of (R,+), and we have that µ(xr) ≥ µ(x) for all 
r, x ∈ R. Hence µ is a fuzzy right R-subgroup of R.

Then (R, +, y) is a near-ring. We define a fuzzy set µ: R → [0,1] by µ(c) = µ(d) < µ(b) 
< µ(a). Thus µ is also a fuzzy right R subgroup of R. 
 
THEOREM [56]: If µ is a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R, then the 
set Rµ = {x ∈ Rµ (x) = µ (θ)} is a right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R. 
 
Proof: Let x, y ∈ Rµ . Then µ(x) = µ(y) = µ(0). Since µ is a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-
subgroup, it follows that  
 
µ(x – y)  
≥  
min{µ(x) , µ(y)} 
=  
min{µ(0), µ(0)} 
  
 
 
 
=  
µ(0). 
 
On the other hand µ(x – y) ≤ µ(0). Hence we have µ(x – y) = µ(0) so x – y ∈ Rµ Also 
for any x ∈ Rµ and r ∈ R, we get µ (xr) ≥ µ(x) = µ(0) (resp. µ(rx) ≥ µ(x) = µ(0)). 
 
On the other hand µ(xr) ≤ µ(0) (resp. µ(rx) ≤ µ(0). Hence we obtain µ(xr) = µ(0) (resp 
µ(rx) = µ(0)), which shows that x r ∈ Rµ (resp. r x ∈ Rµ) Consequently the set Rµ is a 
right (resp.left) R-subgroup of R. 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.6: A fuzzy right (resp.left) R-subgroup µ of a near-ring R is said to be 
normal if there exists x ∈ R such that µ(x) = 1. 
 
Note that if a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup µ of a near-ring R is normal then 
µ(0) = 1; hence µ is a normal fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R if 
and only if µ(0) = 1. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.12: Let µ be a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R and 
let µ+ be a fuzzy set in R defined by µ+(x) = µ(x) + 1 – µ(0) for all x ∈ R. Then µ+ is a 
normal fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R containing µ. 
 
Proof: Let x, y ∈ R. Then  
 
min{µ+ (x), µ+(y)}  
= 
min {µ(x) + 1 – µ(0), µ(y) + 1 – µ(0)} 
= 
min {µ(x), µ (y)} + 1 – µ(0) 
  
 
 
 
≤  
µ(x – y) + 1 – µ(0) 
  
 
 
 
= 
µ+(x – y)

µ+(xr)   
= 
µ(xr) + 1 – µ(0) 
  
 
≥  
µ (x) + 1 – µ(0) 
= 
µ+(x). 
 
Similarly µ+(rx) = µ(rx) + 1 – µ(0) ≥ µ(x) + 1 – µ(0) = µ+(x). Hence µ+ is a fuzzy 
right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R. Clearly µ+(0) = 1 and µ ⊂  µ+. This gives the proof.  
 
Using the fact µ ⊂ µ+ we have the following theorem: 
 
THEOREM 1.8.13: If µ is a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R satisfying µ+(x) = 0 
for some x ∈ R, then µ(x) = 0 also. 
 
THEOREM [1]: Let (R, +, y) be a near-ring and χH be the characteristic function of a 
subset H ⊂ R. Then H is a right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R if and only if χH is a fuzzy 
right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R. 
 
Proof: Refer [1]. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.14: For any right (resp. left) R-subgroup H of a near-ring R, the 
characteristic function χH of H is a normal fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R 
and 
H
Rχ = H. 
 
Proof: From the above theorem the proof of this theorem can be easily obtained. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.15: Let µ and ν be fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroups of a near-ring R. 
If µ ⊂ ν and µ(0) = ν(0) then Rµ ⊂ Rν . 
 
Proof: Assume that µ ⊂ ν and µ(0) = ν(0). If x ∈ Rµ then ν(x) ≥ µ(x) = µ(0) = ν(0). 
Noting that ν(x) ≤ ν(0) for all x ∈ R we have ν(x) = ν(0) that is x ∈ R. Hence the 
proof. 
 
The following result is a direct consequence of the above theorem; hence left for the 
reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.16: If µ and ν are normal fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroups of a 
near-ring R satisfying µ ⊂ ν then Rµ ⊂ Rν . 
 
THEOREM 1.8.17: A fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup µ of a near-ring R is normal if 
and only if µ+ = µ . 
 
Proof: Sufficiency is direct. To prove the necessary condition assume µ is a normal 
fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R and let x ∈ R. Then µ+(x) = µ(x) + 1 – µ(0) = 
µ(x) and hence µ+ = µ. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.18: If µ is a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring then 
(µ+)+ = µ+. 
 
Proof: For any x ∈ R, we have (µ+)+(x) = µ+(x) + 1 – µ+(0) = µ+(x) completing the 
proof.  

 
104
 
The following result is direct by the above definition. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.19: If µ is a normal fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring 
R, then (µ+)+ = µ. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.20: Let µ be a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of near-ring R. If 
there exists a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup ν of R satisfying ν+ ⊂ µ then µ is 
normal. 
 
Proof: Suppose there exists a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup ν of R such that ν+ ⊂ 
µ. Then 1 = ν+ (0) ≤ µ (0) whence µ(0) = 1. Hence the proof. 
 
Using the above theorem the following result is straightforward. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.21: Let µ be a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R. If 
there exists a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup ν of R satisfying ν+ ⊂ µ then µ+ = µ. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.22: Let µ be a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R and 
let f: [0, µ (0)] → [0,1] be an increasing function. Define a fuzzy set µf: R → [0,1] by 
µf (x) = f (µ(x)) for all x ∈ R. Then µf is a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R. In 
particular if f(µ(0)) = 1 then µf is normal and if f(t) ≥ t for all t ∈ [0, µ(0)] then µ ⊆ 
µf. 
 
Proof: Let x, y ∈ R. Then µf (x – y) = f(µ(x – y)) ≥ f(min µ(x), µ(y)) = min {f(µ(x)), 
f(µ(y))} = min{µf (x), µf(y)} and for all x, r ∈ R, we have µf (xr) = f (µ (xr)) ≥ f (µ(x)) 
= µf (x). Similarly µf (rx) = f(µ(rx)) ≥ f (µ(x)) = µf (x). Hence µf is a fuzzy right (resp. 
left) R-subgroup of R. If f (µ(0)) = 1 then clearly µf is normal. Assume that f(t) ≥ t for 
all t ∈ [0, µ(0)]. Then µf (x) = f (µ(x)) ≥ µ(x) for all x∈R, which proves that µ ⊆ µf. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.23: Let µ be a non constant normal fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup 
of R , which is maximal in the poset of normal fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroups 
under set inclusion. Then µ takes only the values 0 and 1. 
 
Proof: Please refer [56].  
 
Another normalization of fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R as given 
by [56] is given below. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.24: Let µ be a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R and 
let µ0 be a fuzzy set in R defined by µ0 (x) = µ(x) / µ(0) for all x ∈ R. Then µ0 is a 
normal fuzzy right (resp.left) R-subgroup of R containing µ. 
 
Proof: For any x, y ∈ R we have

. Hence the claim. Using the fact µ ⊂ µ0 the following 
results are straightforward. 
 
THEOREM 1.8.25: If µ is a fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a near-ring R 
satisfying µ0(0) = 0 for some x ∈ R then µ(x) = 0 also.

We have given several of the proofs verbatim from [56] mainly to make it easy when 
we do the proofs in case of Smarandache fuzzy near-rings and their ideals and 
subgroups. For more about fuzzy near-rings please refer [56, 57]. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of fuzzy near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.7: Let µ be a non-empty fuzzy subset of a near-ring N (that is µ(x) ≠ 0 
for some x ∈ N) then µ is said to be a fuzzy ideal of N if it satisfies the following 
conditions:  
 
i. µ (x + y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (y)}.  
ii. µ (–x) = µ (x). 
iii. µ (x) = µ (y + x – y). 
iv. µ (xy) ≥ µ (x) and  
v. µ {x (y + i) – xy } ≥ µ (i) for all x, y, i ∈ N.  
 
1. If µ is a fuzzy ideal of N then µ (x + y) = µ (y + x).  
2. If µ is a fuzzy ideal of N then µ (0) ≥ µ (x) for all x ∈ N. The above two statements 
can be easily verified for if we put z = x + y, then µ (x + y) = µ (z) = µ (– x + z + 
x) since µ is a fuzzy ideal µ (– x + x + y + x) = µ (y + x) (since z = x + y).  
 
Likewise for the second statement µ (0) = µ (x – x) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (-x)} = µ(x)  since 
µ is a fuzzy ideal (since µ (–x) = µ (x) by the very definition of fuzzy ideal).

THEOREM [130]: Let N be a near-ring and λI, the characteristic function on a subset I 
of N. Then λI is a fuzzy ideal of N if and only if I is an ideal of N.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of X. Then the set µt of all t ∈ [0, 1] is 
defined by µt = {x ∈ N / µ (x) ≥ t} is called the level subset of t for the near-ring N.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: Let N be a near-ring and µ be a fuzzy ideal of N. Then the level 
subset µt of N for all t ∈ [0, t], t ≤ µ(0) is an ideal of N if and only if µ is a fuzzy ideal 
of N.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: A fuzzy ideal µ of N is called fuzzy prime if for any two fuzzy 
ideals σ and θ of N σ oθ ⊆ µ implies σ ⊆ µ or θ ⊆ µ.  
 
Now we use the concept of fuzziness in Γ-near-rings as given by [1, 130].  
 
THEOREM [130]: If µ is a fuzzy ideal of a near-ring N and a ∈ N then µ (x) ≥ µ(a) for 
all x ∈ 〈a〉.  

 
107
 
Proof: Please refer [1, 130]. 
 
DEFINITION [130]: Let µ and σ be two fuzzy subsets of M. Then the product of fuzzy 
subset ( σ o τ)(x) = sup {min (σ (y), τ (z))} if x is expressible as a product x = yz 
where y, z ∈ M and (σ o τ) (x) = 0 otherwise.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: A fuzzy ideal µ of N is said to have fuzzy IFP if µ (a n b) ≥ µ(ab) 
for all a, b, n ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: Let µ be a fuzzy ideal of N, µ has fuzzy IFP if and only if µk is a 
IFP ideal of N for all 0 ≤ k ≤ 1.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: N has strong IFP if and only if every fuzzy ideal of N has fuzzy 
IFP.  
 
THEOREM [130]: If µ is a fuzzy IFP-ideal of N then Nµ = {x ∈ N / µ (x) = µ(0)} is an 
IFP ideal of N.  
 
Proof: We have µ (0) ≥ µ (x) for all x ∈ N; write t = µ (0). Now Nµ = µt and by 
definitions µt has IFP. Therefore Nµ is an IFP ideal of N.  
 
Notation: Let µ be a fuzzy ideal of N. For any s ∈ [0, 1] define βs : N → [0, 1] by

Results:  
 
1. βs (x) ≤ s for all x ∈ N. 
2. βs is a fuzzy ideal of N. 
3. If µ (0) = t, then s ≥ t if and only if µt = (βs)t.  
 
The proof of the above 3 statements are left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
We can still equivalently define as a definition or prove it as a theorem.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: µ is a fuzzy IFP ideal of N if and only if βs is a fuzzy IFP ideal for 
all s ∈ [0, 1].  
 
Result: A fuzzy ideal µ has IFP if and only if N(βs) has IFP for all s ∈ [0, 1].  
 
The above result is assigned as an exercise for the reader to prove.

ii. µ (-x) = µ (x).

v. µ {(x α (y + z) – x α y} ≥ µ(z)  
 
for all x, y, z ∈ M and α ∈ Γ.  
 
The following result is left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 1.8.28: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of M. Then the level subsets µt = {x ∈ M / 
µ(x) ≥ t}, t ∈ Im µ, are ideals of M if and only if µ is a fuzzy ideal of M.  
 
All results true in case of fuzzy ideals of N are true in case of fuzzy ideals of M with 
some minor modifications.  
 
The following result can be proved by routine application of definitions.  
 
THEOREM 1.8.29: Let M and M' be two Γ-near-rings, h : M → M' be an Γ-
epimorphism and µ, σ be fuzzy ideals of M and M' respectively then  
 
i. h (h –1(σ)) = σ. 
ii. h–1(h (µ)) ⊇ µ and  
iii. h–1(h (µ)) = µ if µ is constant on ker h.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: A fuzzy ideal µ of M is said to be a fuzzy prime ideal of M if µ is 
not a constant function; and for any two fuzzy ideals σ and Γ of M, σ o Γ ⊆ µ,  
implies either σ ⊂ µ or Γ ⊂ µ.  
 
Using these definitions it can be proved.  
 
THEOREM [130]: If µ is a fuzzy prime ideal of M then Mµ = {x ∈ M / µ (x) = µ(0)} is 
a prime ideal of M.

Proof: It is left for the reader to prove.  
 
Result 2: If µ is a fuzzy prime ideal of M then |Im µ| = 2.  
 
We further define fuzzy near matrix ring.

where aij.bij = aij for all aij ∈ A and bij ∈ B. Clearly (Pn×n, ☼) is a semigroup. Thus (A 
⊕ B) ☼ C = A ☼ C ⊕ B ☼ C. Hence (Pn×n, ⊕, ☼) is a near-ring, which we call as 
the fuzzy near matrix ring or fuzzy matrix near-ring.  
 
THEOREM 1.8.30: The fuzzy near- matrix ring is a commutative near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward.  
 
THEOREM 1.8.31: The fuzzy matrix near-ring is not an abelian near-ring.  
 
Proof: For A, B ∈ Pn×n we have A ☼ B ≠ B ☼ A in general.  
 
THEOREM 1.8.32: In {Pn×n, ⊕, ☼} we have In×n ≠ A where In×n is the matrix with 
diagonal elements 1 and rest 0.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.10: Let {Pn×n, ⊕, ☼} be a fuzzy near matrix ring we say a subset I of 
Pnxn is a fuzzy left ideal of Pnxn if  
 
i. 
(I, +) is a normal subgroup of Pnxn.  
ii. 
n (n' + i) + nr n' ∈ I for each i ∈ I and nr, n, n' ∈ N where nr 
denotes the unique right inverse of n.  
 
All properties enjoyed by near-rings can be defined and will be true with appropriate 
modifications.  
 
Next we proceed on to define the concept of fuzzy complex near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.11: Let V = {a + ib / a, b ∈ [0,1]} define on V the operation called 
addition denoted by ⊕ as follows:  
 
For a + ib, a1 + ib1 ∈ V, a + ib ⊕ a1 + ib1 = a + a1 + i (b + b1) where a ⊕ a1 = a + 
a1 if a + a1 < 1 and a + a1 = a + a1 – 1 if a + a1 ≥ 1 where '+' is the usual addition of 
numbers. Clearly (V, ⊕) is a group. Define ☼ on V by (a + ib) ☼ (a1 + ib1) = a + ib 
for all a + ib, a1 + ib1 ∈ V. (V, ☼) is a semigroup. It is easily verified. (V, ⊕, ☼) is a 
near-ring, which we call as the fuzzy complex near-ring.  

 
111
 
Further P = {a / a ∈ [0,1]} and C = {ib / b ∈ [0 1]} are fuzzy complex subnear-rings 
of (V, ⊕, ☼).  
 
PROPOSITION 1.8.1: V has non-trivial idempotent.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 1.8.33: Let {V, ⊕, ☼} be a fuzzy complex near-ring. Every nontrivial fuzzy 
subgroup of N is a fuzzy right ideal of V.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the fact that if N is a fuzzy subgroup of V then NV ⊆ N.  
 
It is an open question. Does V have nontrivial fuzzy left ideals and ideals? The reader 
is requested to develop new and analogous notions and definitions about these 
concepts.  
 
Now a natural question would be can we have the concept of fuzzy non-associative 
complex near-ring; to this end we define a fuzzy non-associative complex near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.12: Let W = {a + ib / a, b ∈ [0, 1] called the set of fuzzy complex 
numbers}. Define on W two binary operations ⊕ and ☼ as follows: 
  
(W, ⊕) is a commutative loop where for a + ib,  c + id ∈ W define a + ib ⊕  c + id = 
a ~ c + i ( b ~ d) where ‘~’ is the difference between a and b. Clearly (W, ⊕) is a 
commutative loop.  
 
Define ☼ on W by (a + ib) ☼ (c + id) = a + ib for all a + ib, c + id ∈ W. (W, ⊕, ☼) 
is called the fuzzy complex non-associative near-ring. ([0, 1], ⊕, ☼) ⊆ (W, ⊕, ☼) is a 
fuzzy non-associative subnear-ring.  
 
Obtain interesting properties about these non-associative fuzzy complex near-rings.  
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy polynomial near-rings.   
 
DEFINITION 1.8.13:  Let R be the set of reals. The fuzzy polynomial near-ring

definition.

 (pn ≠ 0) deg p(x) = sn . The maximal 
degree of any polynomial p(x) can take is 1. Now it is important to note that as in the 
case polynomial rings we cannot say deg [p(x).q(x)] = deg p(x) + deg q(x).  
 
But we have always in fuzzy polynomial near-ring.  
 
 
deg (p(x) q(x)) = deg p(x)  for  
 
p(x), q(x) ∈ R [x [0, 1]]  
 
as this degree for fuzzy polynomial near-rings is a fuzzy degree we shall denote them 
by f(deg (p(x)).  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.16: Let p(x) ∈ [R [x[0, 1]], p(x) is said to have a root α if p(α) = 0.  
 
Example 1.8.2: Let p(x) = 
2 – x1/2 be a fuzzy polynomial in R {x[0, 1]]. The root of 
p(x) is 2 for p(2) = 
2 – 21/2 = 0.  
 
But as in case of root of polynomial of degree n has n and only n roots which is the 
fundamental theorem on algebra; we in case of fuzzy polynomial near-rings cannot 
say the number of roots in a nice mathematical terminology that is itself fuzzy.

A study of these fuzzy polynomial near-rings is left open for any interested 
researcher. We proceed on to define fuzzy polynomial near-rings when the number of 
variables is more than one x and y.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.17: Let R be the reals x, y be two variables we first assume xy = yx.

DEFINITION 1.8.18: Let {R [x [0, 1], y [0, 1]], ⊕, y} be a fuzzy polynomial near-ring in 
the variable x and y.

DEFINITION 1.8.19: Let R {x [0, 1], y [0, 1], ⊕, ‘y’} be the fuzzy polynomial near-ring in

For example p (x, y) = 3x1/2 y2/3 + 3x2/3 y1/2. p (x, y) = xr + yr, r ∈ [0, 1].  
 
p(x, y) = xr + yr + xsyt + ytss where s + t = 1. s, t, r ∈ [0, 1]. We have like other 
polynomials we can extend the fuzzy polynomials to any number of variables say X1, 
X2, …, Xn. under the assumption XiXj = XjXi and denote it by R [X1

[0, 1]] called the fuzzy polynomial near-ring in n variables. The reader is advised to 
develop new results on these fuzzy polynomial near-rings.  
 
We have introduced the concept of complex near-ring and the non-associative 
complex near-ring now we just define yet another new notion called fuzzy non-
associative near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.20: Let {W, ⊕, ☼} be the fuzzy non-associative complex near-ring. 
Let x be an indeterminate. We define the fuzzy non-associative polynomial near-ring 
as follows: 
 
W [x] = {Σ pi xi / pi ∈ W}; we say p(x), q(x) ∈ W[x] are equal if and only if every 
coefficient of same power of x is equal i.e. if p(x) = p0 + p1x + … + pnxn and q(x) = q0 
+ q1x + … + qnxn. p(x) = q(x) if and only if pi = qi. for i = 1, 2, …, n. Addition is 
performed as follows p(x) ⊕ q(x) = p0 ⊕ q0 + … + (pn ⊕ qn) xn where ⊕ is the 
operation on W. For p(x), q(x) in W[x] define p(x) ☼ q(x) = p(x). Clearly {W(x), ⊕, 
☼} is a fuzzy non-associative complex polynomial near-ring.  
 

 
114
Now take Z0 = Z+∪ {0}. Let p: Z0→ W be defined by p(0) = 0, p(x) = x
1 for 0 ≠ x ∈ Z.  
 
Clearly p(x) is a fuzzy non-associative subnear-ring of W. Thus p is a fuzzy non-
associative subnear-ring.  Let G = Z0 × Z0. Define a map p0 : G → W[x] by  
 
p(0, 0) = 0.  
p(x, y) = 
y
1
x
1 +
, x ≠ 0, y ≠ 0.  
p(x, 0) = x
1 ;  
p(0, y) = y
1 .  
 
Then the map p is a fuzzy non-associative complex subnear-ring of G.  
 
Several interesting research in this direction is thrown open for the reader.  
 
Now we proceed on to define a special class of fuzzy near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.21: Let P = [0, 1] the interval from 0 to 1. Define ⊕ and ☼ on P as 
follows. For a, b ∈ P define a ⊕ b = a + b if a + b < 1, a ⊕ b = 0 if a + b = 1 and a 
⊕ b = a + b –1 if a + b > 1. Thus ⊕ acts as modulo 1. Define ☼ on a, b ∈ P = [0, 1] 
by a ☼ b = a; clearly (a ⊕ b) ☼ c = a☼ c + b☼ c = a ⊕ b. Clearly (P, ⊕) is a group 
and (P, ☼) is a semigroup. Hence (P, ⊕, ☼) is a right near-ring. We call {P, ⊕, ☼} 
the special fuzzy right near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.22: Let (P, ⊕, ☼) be a fuzzy near-ring. P0 = {p ∈ P / p.0 = 0} is 
called the fuzzy zero symmetric part and Pc = {n ∈ P / n.0 = n} is called the fuzzy 
constant part.   
 
THEOREM 1.8.34: The special fuzzy right near-ring {P, ⊕, ☼} has no fuzzy invertible 
elements.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
Let S = {r/p, 0 / 1 < r < p} is a fuzzy subnear-ring or to be more specific if S = {0, ¼, 
½, ¾}; S is a fuzzy subnear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.23: A fuzzy subnear-ring N of P is called fuzzy invariant if NP ⊆ N 
and PN ⊆ N we call a fuzzy subnear-ring N of P to be a fuzzy right invariant if NP ⊂ 
N.  
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise to the reader.  
 
THEOREM 1.8.35: Every fuzzy subnear-ring N of P is fuzzy right invariant.  
 

 
115
DEFINITION 1.8.24: The set P = {0, 1} with two binary operations ⊕ and ☼ is called 
fuzzy right seminear-ring if {P, ⊕} and {P, ☼} are right seminear-ring.  
 
All results can be easily extended in case of fuzzy seminear-ring.  
 
Example 1.8.3: Let {P, ⊕, ☼} be the fuzzy seminear-ring. Define ⊕ as p ⊕ q if p + q 
< 1 and p ⊕ q = 0 if p + q ≥ 1. Then (P, ⊕) is a semigroup. Define ☼ as p ☼ q = p for 
all p, q ∈ P. Clearly {P, ⊕, ☼} is a special fuzzy seminear-ring.  
 
 
Now we proceed on to define binear-rings and the concept of fuzzy binear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.25: Let (N,+, y) be a non empty set. We call N a binear-ring if N = 
N1 ∪ N2 where N1 and N2 are proper subsets of N i.e. N1 ⊄ N2 or N2 ⊄ N1 satisfying 
the following conditions: 
 
Atleast one of (Ni , +, y) is a right near-ring (i = 1, 2) i.e. for preciseness we say  
 
i. 
(N1 , +, y) is a near-ring. 
ii. 
(N2 , +, y) is a ring. 
 
We say that even if both (Ni, +, y) and (N2, +, y) are right near-rings still we call    
(N, +, y) to be a binear-ring. By default of notation we mean by a binear-ring only a 
right binear-ring unless explicitly stated. 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.26: Let (N, +, y) be a binear-ring. We call (N, +, y) as abelian if (N, 
+) is abelian i.e. if N = N1 ∪ N2 then (N1, +) and (N2, +) are both abelian. If both (N1, 
y) and (N2, y) are commutative then we call N a commutative binear-ring. If N = Nd 
i.e. N1 = (N1)d and N2 = (N2)d then we say N is a distributive binear-ring. If all non-
zero elements of N are left (right) cancelable we say that N fulfills the left (right) 
cancellation law. N is a bi-integral domain if both N1 and N2 has no zero divisors. If 
N \ {0}= N1 \ {0} and N2 \ {0} are both groups then we call N a binear field. 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.27: Let (P,+) be a bigroup i.e. (P = P1 ∪ P2) with 0 and let N be a 
binear-ring µ : N × P→ P is called the N-bigroup if for all pi ∈ Pi and for all n, ni ∈ 
Ni we have (n +ni ) p = np + ni p and (nni ) p = n(ni p) for i = 1, 2.

DEFINITION 1.8.29: Let N = N1 ∪ N2 be a binear-ring; P a N-bigroup. A binormal 
subgroup (or equivalently we can call it as normal bisubgroup) I of (I = I1 ∪ I2 ) 
(N,+) is called a bi-ideal of N if

Normal sub-bigroup T of (N,+) with (i) is called right bi ideal of N while normal sub-
bigroup L of (N,+) with (ii) are called left biideals. 
 
A normal sub-bigroup S of P is called bi ideal of N P if for si ∈ Pi (i = 1, 2) (P = P1 ∪ 
P2 ) and s ∈ Si (i = 1, 2 and S = S1 ∪ S2 ) for all ni ∈ Ni (i = 1, 2, N = N1 ∪ N2 ).         
ni (s + si) – ns ∈ Si, i = 1,2. Factor binear-ring N / I and factor N-bigroup P/S are 
defined as in case of birings. 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.30: A sub-binear-ring M of the binear-ring N is called bi-invariant if 
MN1 ⊂ M1 and M2 N2 ⊂ M2 (where M = M1 ∪ M2 and N = N1 ∪ N2 ) and N1 M1 ⊂ M1 
and N2 M2 ⊂ M2 .  
 
A minimal bi-ideal, minimal right bi-ideal and minimal left bi-ideal and dually the 
concept of maximal right bi-ideal, left bi-ideal and maximal bi-ideal are defined as in 
case of bi-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.31: Let N be a binear-ring (N = N1 ∪ N2, +, y) and S a sub-
bisemigroup of (N = N1 ∪ N2 , +) (where S = S1 ∪ S2 ). A binear-ring NS is called a

Let V denote the collection of all binear-rings and X be any non-empty subset.

for all i ∈ {1, 2, …, t}, Ni is a bi-ideal of Ni – 1.  
 
In the special case when all the Ni's are bi-ideals of the binear-ring N, we call the

ideal if for all bi-ideals I and J of N; IJ ⊂ N implies I ⊂ P or J ⊂ P. The binear-ring N 
is called a prime binear-ring if {0} is a prime ideal.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.36: Let S be a bi-ideal of a binear-ring N. S is semiprime if and only 
if for all bi-ideals I on N, I 2 ⊂ S implies I ⊂ S. N is called a semiprime binear-ring if 
{0} is a semiprime bi-ideal.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.37: Let L be a left bi-ideal in a binear-ring N. L is called modular if 
and only if there exists e ∈ N1 ∪ N2 and for all n ∈ N1 ∪ N2 and for all n ∈ N1 ∪ N2, 
n – ne ∈ L. In this case we also say that L is modular by e and that e is a right identity 
modulo L, since for all n ∈ N, ne = n (mod L).  
 
Notation: For z ∈ N, denote the bi-ideal generated by the set {n – nz / n ∈ N} by LZ. 
LZ = N if z = 0. z ∈ N is called quasi regular if z ∈ LZ, S ⊂ N is called quasi-regular if 
and only if for all s ∈ S, s is quasi regular.  
 
Let N be a binear-ring. An idempotent e ∈ N = N1 ∪ N2 is called central if it is in the 
center of (N1, y) or (N2, y) i.e. for all n ∈ N1 (or n ∈ N2) we have ne = en.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.38: A binear-ring is said to be biregular if there exists some set E of 
central idempotents with  
 
i. 
For all e ∈ N1 (e ∈ N2), N1 e (N2 e) is an ideal of N1 (or N2). i.e. N1 e ∪ {0} 
or {0} ∪ N2 e or if e ∈ N1 ∩ N2  then N1 e ∪ N2 e is a bi-ideal of N.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.39: Let N be a binear-ring; N = N1 ∪ N2 where N1 and N2 are near-
rings. The binear-ring N is said to fulfill the insertion factors property (IFP) provided 
for all a, b, n ∈ N1 (or a, b, n ∈ N2 ) we have ab = 0 implies anb = 0. The biring has 
strong IFP property if every homomorphic image of N has the IFP. The binear-ring N 
has the strong IFP if and only if for all I in N and for all a, b, n ∈ N1 (a, b, n ∈ N2), a, 
b ∈ I1 implies anb ∈ I1 (ab ∈ I2 implies anb ∈ I2 ) where I = I1 ∪ I2.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.40: Let p be a prime. A binear-ring N is called a p-binear-ring 
provided that for all x ∈ N, x p = x and px = 0.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.41: A biright ideal I of a binear-ring N is called right quasi 
bireflexive if whenever A and B are bi-ideals of the binear-ring N with AB ⊂ I then 
b(b' + a) – bb' ∈ I for all a ∈ A and b, b' ∈ B. A binear-ring N is strongly sub-
bicommutative if it is right quasi bireflexive.  
 

 
118
DEFINITION 1.8.42: Let N be a binear-ring S a subnormal sub-bigroup of (N, +). S is 
called a quasi bi-ideal of N if SN ⊂ NS ⊂ S whereby NS we mean elements of the form 
{n(n' + s) – nn' / for all s ∈ S and for n, n' ∈ N} = NS.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.43: An infra binear-ring (INR) is a triple (N, +, y), (N = N1 ∪ N2 ) 
where 
 
i. 
(N, +) is a bigroup. 
ii. 
(N, y) is a bisemigroup. 
iii. 
(x + y)y z = x y  z –  0 y z + y y z for all x, y, z ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.44: Let (N, +, y) be a non-empty set, where N = N1 ∪ N2 ∪ N3 ∪ N4 
where each Ni is a near-ring or a ring for each i = 1, 2, 3, 4. (N, +, y) is defined as 
the quad near-ring or bi-binear-ring.  
 
Example 1.8.4: Let (N, +, y) be a non-empty set, where N = Z2 ∪ Z12 ∪ Z7 ∪ Z where 
Z2 and Z are near-rings and Z12 is the ring of integers modulo 12 and Z7 is the prime 
field of characteristic 7. N is a quad near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.45: Let (N, +, y) be a binear-ring where N = N1 ∪ N2 and G = G1 ∪ 
G2 be a bigroup. The bigroup binear-ring NG = N1G1 ∪ N1G2 ∪ N2G1 ∪ N2G2 is a 
quad near-ring where each NiGj is a group near-ring or group ring, i = 1, 2 and j = 
1, 2. Similarly we can define bisemigroup binear-ring NS = N1S1 ∪ N2S1 ∪ N1S2 ∪ 
N2S2 where S is a bisemigroup (S = S1 ∪ S2) and N = N1 ∪ N2 is a binear-ring. It is 
easily verified that the bisemigroup binear-ring is also a quad near-ring where NiSj 
are semigroup near-rings or semigroup rings, i = 1, 2 and j = 1, 2. All results 
connected with binear-rings can be extended in case of quad near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.46: Let (N, +, y) is a non-empty set where N = N1 ∪ N2. We say N is 
a biseminear-ring if one of (N1, +, y) or (N2, +, y) are seminear-rings. Thus for N to 
be biseminear-ring we need one of (N1, +, y) or (N2, +, y) or both to be a seminear-
ring.  
 
We can have several such biseminear-rings. All notions studied in case of binear-rings 
can also be easily studied and generalized for biseminear-rings. The only means to 
generate several new classes of biseminear-rings are as follows: 
 
DEFINITION 1.8.47: Let (S, +, y) be a biseminear-ring with S = S1 ∪ S2. G any group 
the group biseminear-ring SG = S1G ∪ S2G where SiG are group seminear-rings. 
Clearly every group biseminear-ring is a biseminear-ring.  
 
By using this definition we can have infinite class of both commutative or non-
commutative and infinite or finite classes of biseminear-rings. If in the definition of 
group biseminear-rings if we replace the group by a semigroup we get yet another 
new class of biseminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.48: Let (N, +, y) be a non-empty set. We say (N, +, y) is a quad 
seminear-ring or bi-biseminear-ring if the following conditions hold good.  
 

 
119
i. 
N = N1 ∪ N2 ∪ N3 ∪ N4 where Ni are proper subsets of N such that Ni ⊄ 
Nj for any i ≠ j, i, j = 1, 2, 3, 4. 
ii. 
(Ni , +, y) is at least a seminear-ring for i = 1, 2, 3, 4 under the operations 
of N. Then we call (N, +, y) a quad seminear-ring or bi-biseminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 1.8.49: Let (N, +, y) be a binear-ring i.e. N = N1 ∪ N2 where N1 ⊄ N1 or 
N2 ⊄ N1 such that (N1,+, y) is a near-ring and (N2,+, y) is a ring. The map µ : N → 
[0,1] is said to be a fuzzy bi near-ring if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 where µ1 : N1 → [0, 1] is a fuzzy 
near-ring and µ2 : N2 → [0,1] is a fuzzy ring; the ‘∪’ is just only a notational 
convenience.  
 
Equivalently we can define µ restricted to N1 is a fuzzy near-ring and µ restricted to 
N2 is a fuzzy ring where µ = 
2

N
N
µ
µ
∪
= µ1 ∪ µ2. Here 
1
N
µ
 denotes the restriction 
of µ to N1 and 
2
N
µ
denotes the restriction of µ to N2.  
 
All notions as in case of fuzzy near-rings can be extended to fuzzy binear-rings in an 
analogous way using appropriately the fuzzy near-ring concept and the fuzzy ring 
concept. However we will be defining in the later chapters the concept of 
Smarandache fuzzy binear-rings and their properties. 
 
 
1.9 Fuzzy vector spaces and fuzzy bivector spaces 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of fuzzy bivector spaces and recall the 
definition and properties of fuzzy vector spaces. The study of fuzzy vector spaces 
started as early as 1977; but till date the study of fuzzy bivector spaces is absent.  
 
For more about fuzzy vector spaces refer [75, 79, 91, 92, 96, 101]. 
 
Throughout this section V denotes a vector space over a field F. A fuzzy subset of a 
non-empty set S is a function from S into [0, 1]. Let A denote a fuzzy subspace of V 
over a fuzzy subfield K of F and let X denote a fuzzy subset of V such that X ⊆ A. 
Let 〈X〉 denote the intersection of all fuzzy subspaces of V over K that contain X and 
are contained in A. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.1:  
 
i. 
A fuzzy subset K of F is a fuzzy subfield of F, if K (1) = 1 and for all c, d ∈ F, 
K (c – d) ≥ min {K(c), K (d)} and K(cd –1) ≥ min { K( c), K (d)} where d ≠ 0. 
 
ii. 
A fuzzy subset A of V is a fuzzy subspace over a fuzzy subfield K of F, if A(0) > 
0 and for all x, y ∈ V and for all c ∈ F, A (x – y) ≥ min {A(x), A(y)} and A(cx) 
≥ min {K(c ) , A(x)}. If K is a fuzzy subfield of F and if x ∈ F, x ≠ 0, then K(0) 
= K(1) ≥ K(x) = K(–x) = K(+ x–1). 
 
In the following we let L denote the set of all fuzzy subfields of F and let AL denote 
the set of all fuzzy subspaces of V over K ∈ L. 
 

 
120
If A and B are fuzzy subsets of V then A ⊂ B means A(x) ≤ B(x) for all x ∈ A. For    
0 ≤ t ≤ 1, let At = {x ∈ V | A(x) ≥ t}. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.1: Let A be a fuzzy subset of V and let s, t ∈ Im(A).  
 
Then  
i. 
s ≤ t if and only if As ⊇ At ,  
ii. 
s = t if and only if As = At . 
 
Proof: It is a matter of routine hence left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
If A ∈ AL for every fuzzy subfield K' of K. For S a subset of F, we let δS denote the 
characteristic function of S. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.2: Let A ∈ 
S
Aδ . Then for all t such that 0 ≤ t ≤ A(0). At is a subspace of 
V. 
 
Proof: Straightforward hence left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.3: Let A be a fuzzy subset of V. If At is a subspace of V for all t ∈       
Im(A), then A ∈ 
F
Aδ . 
 
Proof: Proof is a matter of routine and the reader is expected to prove. If A is a fuzzy 
subspace of V, then At is called a level subspace of V where 0 ≤ t ≤ A(0). 
 
THEOREM 1.9.4: Let V1 ⊂ V2 ⊂ …⊂ Vi ⊂ … be a strictly ascending chain of 
subspaces of V. Define the fuzzy subset A of V by A(x) = ti , if x ∈Vi \ Vi–1 where ti > 
ti+1 for i = 1, 2, … and V0 = φ and A(x) = 0 if

 then A(cx) ≥ 0 = A(x). Suppose that x ∈ Vi \ Vi–1. 
Then cx ∈ Vi, thus A (cx) ≥ t i  = A(x) ≥ min {δF (c ), A(x)}. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.5: Let V = Vo ⊃ V1 ⊃ …⊃ Vi ⊃ … be a strictly descending chain of 
subspaces of V. Define the fuzzy subset A of V by A(x) = ti–1 if x∈ Vi–1 \ Vi where ti–1 < 
ti < 1 for i = 1, 2, …, and A(x) = 1 if

 and so A(cx) = 1 ≥ min {δF (c), A(x)}. 
Suppose that x ∈ Vi–1 \ Vi. Then cx ∈ Vi–1 thus A(cx) ≥ ti–1 = A(x) ≥ min {δF (c), 
A(x)}. If A ∈ AK ∩ AK' for K, K' ∈ L then Im (A) is fixed no matter whether we 
consider A in AK or A in AK'. 
 
Now using all the above results the following theorem can be proved which is left as 
an exercise for the reader.

Now we proceed onto recall the concept of fuzzy spanning. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.2: Let A1 , A2 , …, An be fuzzy subsets of V and let K be a fuzzy subset 
of F. 
 
i. Define the fuzzy subset A1  + … + An  on V by the following: for all x ∈ V, 
(A1 +…+ An )(x) = sup {min {A1 (x1 ), …, An (xn )} x = x1 +…+ xn , xi ∈ V}.  
ii. Define the fuzzy subset K o A of V by for all x ∈ V, (K o A)(x) = 
sup{min{K(c), A(y)} | c ∈ F, y ∈ V, x = c y }. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.3: Let S be a set x ∈ S and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. Define the fuzzy subset xλ of S 
by xλ (y) = λ if y = x and xλ (y) = 0 if y ≠ x. xλ is called a fuzzy singleton. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.8: Let A be a fuzzy subset of V and let K be a fuzzy subset of F. Let d ∈ 
F and x ∈ V. Suppose that 0 ≤ µ , λ ≤ 1. 
 
Then for all z ∈ V.

iii. (K o xλ ) (z) = sup {min {K( c), λ} | c ∈ F, z = cx } if x ≠ 0 and z ∈ Sp (x); 0 
if x ≠ 0 and z ∉ Sp(x). 
iv. (K  o 0λ ) (z) = sup {min {K(c), λ}  c ∈ F } if z = 0, (K o 0λ )(z) = 0 if z ≠ 0. 
 
Proof: Follows by simple and routine work. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.9: Let c, d ∈ F, x, y ∈ V and 0 ≤ k, λ , µ , v ≤ 1. 
 
Then,  
 
dµ o xλ = (dx)min (µ , λ), xλ + yν = (x + y)min (λ, v), dµ o xλ + cK o yv = (dx + cy)min{µ , λ, k, v}. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to refer [75].  
 
The following theorem is also expected to be proved by the reader or refer [75]. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.10: Let A ∈ AK and let B, C be fuzzy subsets of V. Let b, c ∈ F. If B ⊆ A 
and C ⊆ A then bµ o B + Cν o C ⊆ A where 0 ≤ µ ≤ K (b) and 0 ≤ ν ≤ K (c).

Now we proceed on to define the notion of fuzzy freeness. Let ζ denote a set of fuzzy 
singletons of V such that xλ , xK∈ ζ, then λ = k > 0. Define the fuzzy subset X(ζ) of V 
by the following; for all x ∈ V, X (ζ) (x) = λ if xλ ∈ ζ, and X(ζ)(x) = 0, otherwise. 
Define  〈ζ〉 = 〈X(ζ)〉. Let X be a fuzzy subset of V. Define ζ(X) = {xλ | x ∈ V, λ = 
X(x) > 0}. Then X (ζ (x)) = X and ζ X(ζ)) = ζ. If there are only a finite number of xλ 
∈ ζ, with λ > 0 we call ζ finite. If X (x) > 0 for only a finite number of x ∈ X, we call 
X finite. Clearly ζ is finite if and only if X (ζ) is finite and X is finite if and only if 
ζ(X) is finite. For x ∈ V let X \ x denote the fuzzy subset of V defined by the 
following; for all y ∈ V let (X \ x) (y) = X (y) if y ≠ x and (X \ x) (y) = 0 if y = x. 
 

 
123
DEFINITION 1.9.6: Let A∈ AK and let X be a fuzzy subset of V such that X ⊂ A. Then X 
is called a fuzzy system of generators of A over K if 〈 X〉 = A. X is said to be fuzzy free 
over K if for all xλ ∈ X where λ = X (x), xλ ⊄  〈 X \ x〉. X is said to be a fuzzy basis for 
A if X is a fuzzy system of generators of A and X is fuzzy free. Let ζ denote a set of 
fuzzy singletons of V such that if xλ, xK ∈ ζ then λ = k and xλ ⊆ A. Then ζ is called a 
fuzzy singleton system of generators of A over K. if 〈 ζ 〉 = A. ζ is said to be fuzzy free 
over K, if for all xλ ∈ ζ , xλ ⊄ 〈ζ \ {xλ}〉. ζ is said to be a fuzzy basis of singletons for A 
if ζ is a fuzzy singleton system of generators of A and ζ is fuzzy free. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.13: Suppose that A ∈ AK. Then 
 
i. 
K* is a subfield of F. 
ii. 
A* is a subspace of V over K*.

F. 
 
Proof: It is a matter of routine [75].

k*. 
 
Proof: Using the fact if A(x) = 0 for all x ∈ V \ {0} then the result holds with ζ and χ 
empty. 
 
Suppose {0} ⊂ A*. Then k* = f. Suppose ζ is maximal fuzzy free, then χ is linearly 
independent over F. Using earlier theorems we get with simple calculations that ζ is 
maximal. 
 
The following is a simple consequence of the above theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.16: Let A ∈ Ak. Suppose that inf {k(c) | c ∈ F} ≥ sup {A(x) | x ∈ V \ 
{0}}. Then A has maximally fuzzy free sets over k of fuzzy singletons of V and every 
such set has the same cardinality. 
 
The following theorem gives condition for the existence of fuzzy basis. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.17: Let A ∈ Ak. Suppose inf {k(c) | c ∈ F} ≥ sup {A(x) | x ∈ V \ {0}}. If 
A is finite valued, then A has a fuzzy basis over k. 
 
Proof: Matter of routine, hence left for the reader as an exercise.

The following results are immediate consequence of the above Theorem hence it is 
left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.18: Let A∈ Ak . Suppose that inf {k(c) | c ∈ F} ≥ sup A(x) such that         
x ∈ V  \ {0}}. If V is finite dimensional, then A has a fuzzy basis over k. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.19: Let A∈ Ak . Suppose inf {k(c)  c ∈ F} ≥ sup {A(x) x ∈ V \ {0}}. If 
A is finitely fuzzily generated over k, then A has a fuzzy basis over k.  
 
Now we define fuzzy linearly independent set. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.7: Let A∈ Ak and let ζ ⊆ {xλ | x ∈ A*, λ ≤ A (x)} be such that if xλ, xk

Now we proceed on to define the notion of fuzzy algebraically independent. Let X be 
a fuzzy subset of F, we let φ (X) = {xt t = X(x) > 0}. If φ is a set of fuzzy singletons 
such that xt, xs ∈ φ implies t = s, then we let X (φ) denote the fuzzy subset of F 
defined by (X(φ)) (x) = t if xt ∈ φ and (X(φ)) (x) = 0 if xt ∉ φ. Clearly X(φ(X)) = X 
and φ (X(φ)) = φ. We let i = (i1, …, in). If F is a field F(F) denotes the set of all fuzzy 

 
125
subfields of F. F(A) will denote the set of all fuzzy subsets X of F such that X ⊆ A 
and F(A/B) the set of all fuzzy subfields C of F such that B ⊆ C ⊆ A. 
 
We in the forthcoming definitions and results assume A, B ∈ F(F) and B ⊂ A . 
 
Now we proceed on to recall the definitions as given by [91]. The following notation 
and definition is recalled for they are used in the following results. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.8: Let A, B ∈ F(R), B ⊂ A, and let X be a fuzzy subset of R such that 
X ⊆ A. Define B[X] to be the intersection of all C ∈ F(R) such that B ∪ X ⊆ C ⊆ A. 
For A, B ∈ F(F), B ⊆ A and let X be a fuzzy subset of F such that X ⊂ A. Define B(X) 
to be the intersection of all C ∈ F(F) such that B ∪ X ⊆ C ⊆ A. B [X] is a fuzzy 
subring of R and B [X] is a fuzzy subfield of F. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.9: Let X ∈ F(A). Then X (or φ (X)) is said to be fuzzy algebraically 
independent over B if and only if for all

If Ct ⊆ A is fuzzy algebraically independent over B, then Ct is also said to be fuzzy 
transcendental over B. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.21: Let X ∈ F(A). Then X is fuzzy algebraically independent over B if 
and only if for all s ∈ (0, 1], XS is algebraically independent over BS. 
 
Proof: Suppose that X is fuzzy algebraically independent over B. Let s ∈ (0, 1], 
Suppose that 0 = ∑

and since B(bi) ≥ s and X (xj) ≥ s, bj = 0 for all i. Thus

Hence bi = 0 for all i. Thus X is fuzzy algebraically independent over B.  
 
The following theorem can also be a proved as a matter of routine. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.22: Let X ∈ F(A). Then X is fuzzy algebraically independent over B if 
and only if X* is algebraically independent over B*. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.23: Let X ∈ F(A).  
 
i. 
For all t ∈ (0, 1], Bt (Xt ) ⊆ B(X)t . 
ii. 
If B(X) has the sup property then for all t ∈ (0, 1],  
 
Bt (Xt) = B(X)t . 
 

 
126
 
Proof:  
 
i. Let z ∈ Bt (Xt), then (B(X))(z) ≥ t follows easily from properties of fuzzy sets. 
ii. Let z ∈ B(X)t. Then (B(X))(z) ≥ t and since B(X) has the sup property, z has a 
representation as an element of Bt (Xt) by results on fuzzy sets. Thus z ∈ Bt (Xt). 
 
THEOREM 1.9.24: Let X ∈ F(A). Then B(X)* = B*(X* ) and B[X* ] = B* [X* ]. 
 
Proof: x ∈ B(X)* if and only if (B(X)) (x) > 0 if and only if x ∈ B*(X*). Similarly we 
can prove B[X]* = B* [X*]. Let X ∈ F(A). We say that X is maximally fuzzy 
algebraically independent over B if and only if X is fuzzy algebraically independent 
over B and there does not exist Y ∈ F(A) such that Y is fuzzy algebraically 
independent over B and X ⊂ Y. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.25: Let X ∈ F(A). Suppose for all x ∈ X *  we have X (x) = A(x). Then X 
is maximally fuzzy algebraically independent over B if and only if X* is transcendence 
basis of A*/B*. 
 
Proof: By earlier results and routine calculations the result can be arrived.  
 
The following theorem is a direct consequence of the above result. Hence the reader is 
expected to prove the result. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.26: A/B has maximal fuzzy algebraically independent fuzzy subsets of 
F and the cardinality of each is unique. 
 
First we give some notational conventions using which we define the concept of fuzzy 
transcendental and neutral. 
 
Let ct ⊆ A, t > 0. Suppose that ct is not fuzzy algebraically independent over B. Then 
there exists n ∈ N, there exist bi ∈ B*, s, ui ∈ (0, 1] such that B(bi) = ui for i = 0, 1, …, 
n and such that 0s = ∑

 with not all bi = 0. If the only such s that exists for 
which such an equation holds are strictly less than t, then Ct is not fuzzy algebraic 
over B. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.10: Let ct ⊆ A, with t > 0 Then ct is called fuzzy algebraical over B if 
and only if ct is not fuzzy transcendental over B. If every such ct is fuzzy algebraical 
over B, then A/B is called fuzzy algebraical; otherwise A/B is called fuzzy 
transcendental.  
 
DEFINITION 1.9.11: Let ct ⊆ A, with t > 0 If there exists s ∈ (0, t] such that cs ⊆ B, 
then ct is called neutral over B. If every such ct is neutral over B, then A/B is called 
neutral. 
 
Clearly A/B is neutral if and only if A* = B*. Suppose that for c ∈ F, t = A (c ) > B(c ) 
= s > 0. Then ct + (-cs ) = 0s, so that ct is fuzzy algebraical over B. In fact we can think 
of ct as being a root of a first degree polynomial in x, x + (–cs ) with cs ⊆ B. 

 
127
THEOREM 1.9.27: A/B is fuzzy algebraical if and only if A*/ B* is algebraic. 
 
Proof: Suppose that A/B is fuzzy algebraical. Let c ∈ A*. Then there exist n ∈ N, K ∈ 
F not all 0, there exist s, υI ∈ [0, 1] such that

for i = 0, 1, 2, …, n. Thus Kn cn + … + K1 c + Ko = 0 and Ki ∈ B* for i = 0, 1, 2, …, n. 
That is c is algebraic over B*. Conversely, suppose that A*/ B* is algebraic. Let ct ⊆ A 
with t > 0. Then c ∈ A* hence there exist n ∈ N, and Ki ∈ B*, Ki not all 0, i = 0, 1, …,

where B (Ki) = υi for i = 0, 1, 2, …, n. and s = min {t, υo, υi, …, υn}. Hence ct is fuzzy 
algebraical over B. 
 
The following theorem is an easy consequence of the earlier theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.28: Let X ∈ F(A). Then B(X) = B[X] if and only if B(X)/B is fuzzy 
algebraical. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.29: Let C ∈ F (A/B). Then A/B is fuzzy algebraical if and only if A/C 
and C/B are fuzzy algebraical. 
 
Proof: A*/B* is algebraic if and only if A*/C* and C*/B* are algebraic. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.12: Let ct ⊆ A with t > 0. Suppose that c is a root of a polynomial p(x) 
= Knxn + …+ K1x + K0 over B*. We say that ct is fuzzy algebraical with respect to 
p(x) over B* if and only if 0s = ∑

for i = 0, 1, 2, …, n and s ≤ t. For s = t we say that ct is fuzzy algebraic with respect 
to p(x) over B*. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.30: Let K, b ∈ B*, K ≠ 0. If B(K) ≠ B(b) then B(Kb) = min {B(K), 
B(b)}. 
 
Proof: Follows as an easy consequence hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.31: Let ct ⊆ A with t > 0. Suppose that c is algebraic over B*. Let p(x) 
be the minimal polynomial of c over B*. If ct fuzzy algebraical (not fuzzy algebraic) 
with respect to p(x) then ct is fuzzy algebraical (not fuzzy algebraic) with respect to 
every irreducible polynomial over B* which has c as a root.  
 
Proof: Let p(x) = xn + …+ K1x + Ko. Then there exists Ki such that 0 < B (Ki) < t. Let 
q (x) be any irreducible polynomial over B* having c as a root. Then q(x) = Kp(x) for 
some K ∈ B*. Suppose that B (K) ≠ B (Ki). Then 0 < B (KKi) = B(Ki) < t suppose that 

 
128
B(K) = B(Ki), then 0 < B (K) < t and the desired result follows in this case since K is 
the leading coefficient of q (x). 
 
The following result is a direct consequence of the definitions and a matter of routine. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.32: Define the fuzzy subset B (n) of F by B (n) (x) = A(x) if x ∈ B* and 
Bn(x) = 0 if x ∉ B∗. Then Bn ∈ F (A/B). Suppose that inf {A (x) | x ∈ B*} ≥ sup {A(x) | 
x ∉ B∗}.  If A/B is fuzzy algebraical then A/B (n) is fuzzy algebraic. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy transcendence basis. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.13: Let X ∈ F (A). Then X is called a fuzzy transcendence basis of 
A/B if and only if X is fuzzy algebraically independent over B and A/B (X) is fuzzy 
algebraical. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.33: A/B has a fuzzy transcendence basis and the cardinality of a fuzzy 
transcendence basis is unique. In fact X is a fuzzy transcendence basis of A/B if and 
only if X* is a transcendence of A*/B*. 
 
Proof: Follows easily by the very definition. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy separable and fuzzy pure inseparable. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.14: Suppose that ct ⊂ A with t > 0. Then ct is said to be fuzzy pure 
inseparable over B if and only if there exists e ∈ N ∪ {0}, such that bo, b1 ∈ B*, 
where s, υ0, υ1 ∈ (0, 1]. B (bi ) = υi for i = 0, 1 such that

there exists n ∈ N, such that bi ∈ B*, there exist s, υi ∈ (0, 1], B( bi ) = υi for i = 0, 1, 
2, …, n such that 0s = ∑

is fuzzy separable algebraical over B. 
 
Now ct ⊆ A (t > 0) in neutral over B if and only if ct is fuzzy pure inseparable and 
fuzzy separable algebraical over B, yet in either event it is not necessarily the case 
that ct ⊆ B. If ct is fuzzy pure inseparable and fuzzy separable algebraic over B, then 
ct ⊆ B.  
 
The following theorems are a matter of routine and the proofs can be easily supplied 
by an innovative reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.34: 
 
i. A/B is fuzzy pure inseparable if and only if A*/B* is purely inseparable. 
ii. A/B is fuzzy separable algebraical if and only if A*/B* is separable algebraic. 
 
 

 
129
THEOREM 1.9.35: Let C ∈ F(A/B),  
 
i. 
A/B is fuzzy pure inseparable if and only if A/C and C/B are fuzzy pure 
inseparable. 
ii. 
A/B is fuzzy separable algebraical if and only if A/C and C/B are fuzzy 
separable algebraical. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.36: Let ct ⊆ A with t > 0. If ct is fuzzy algebraical (pure inseparable or 
separable algebraical) over B, then B (ct ) /B is fuzzy algebraical (pure inseparable or 
separable algebraical). 
 
Proof: Define the fuzzy subset c of F by c(x) = A(x) if x ∈ B (ct)* and c(x) = 0 other 
wise. Then c* = B (ct)* = B* ((ct)*) = B* (c) and B* (c) / B* i.e. c* / B* is either 
algebraic or purely inseparable or separable algebraic according as c has these 
properties over B*.  
 
Using earlier result the proof of the theorem is a mater or routine. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy separating transcendence basis of A / B. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.15: Let X ∈ F (A). Then X is called a fuzzy separating transcendence 
basis of A / B if and only if X is fuzzy algebraically independent over B and A / B(X) is 
fuzzy separable algebraical. 
 
The following two theorems are also a matter of routine hence left for the reader as an 
exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.37: A/B has a fuzzy separating transcendence basis if and only if A*/B* 
has a separating transcendence basis. In fact X is a fuzzy separating transcendence 
basis of A/B if and only if X* is a separating transcendence basis of A*/B*. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.38:  
 
i. 
B has a fuzzy algebraical (pure inseparable or separable algebraical) 
closure in A. In fact B(c)(B(i), B(s)) is the fuzzy algebraical pure inseparable, 
separable algebraical closure of B in A if and only if

Now similar to vector spaces are the notions of modules. We recall the definition and 
some of the properties of fuzzy modules. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.19: A fuzzy R-module ηM is an ordinary module M with a map η : M 
→ [0, 1] satisfying the following conditions:  
 
i. 
η (a + b) ≥ min { η(a), η(b)}.

DEFINITION 1.9.21: For an arbitrary fuzzy module ηD and its fuzzy submodule ηN the 
fuzzy module ηˆ D/N given by the above theorem is called the fuzzy quotient module of 
ηD by ηN. 
 
DEFINITION 1.9.22: For a fuzzy R-module ηD (note R-module D is divisible if for any 
d ∈ D and r ∈ R, r ≠ 0 there exists some d' ∈ D with rd' = d) and its arbitrary fuzzy 
submodule ηN we can define fuzzy quotient module ηˆ D/N.  
 
Its structure is in fact very complicated refer [102].

Let a vector space V be over R, where R is a field or a division ring. For any ν ∈ V 
and r ∈ R, r ≠ 0 we choose ν = r–1ν and then rν' = ν. By definition V is a divisible 
module. Further let W be a vector subspace of V. For any ν ∉ W and r ∈ R; r ≠ 0, r ν 
∈ W implies r–1 (r ν) ∈ r W = W i.e. ν ∈ W. This is contrary to the hypothesis. Hence 
rν ∉ W and so W is prime submodule. 
 
For any fuzzy module ηM we denote by 
 
M p = {a ∈ M | η(a) ≥ p, p ∈ [0, 1]} and  
M p = {a ∈ M | η(a) > p, p ∈ [0, 1)}  
 
It is well known that Mp is called p-level set of M. Moreover if Mp is a submodule of M 
and then we obtain a fuzzy submodule 
p
M
η
 for every p ∈ [0, 1]. It is easy to verify 
that M p is a submodule of M as well as we call M p strong p-level set of M. 
 
The following three results are given without proof. The interested reader is requested 
to refer [103]. 
 
THEOREM 1.9.40: Let ηM be a fuzzy module and N = Mp (a non zero p-level set of M).

1.10 Fuzzy semigroup and their properties 
 
The study of fuzzy semigroups started in 1979. Several results have been obtained in 
this direction. However to make our study most recent we recall some facts about 
fuzzy semigroups from the result of [142, 143]. Researchers have studied many 
classes of semigroups using fuzzy ideals. Here we recall most notions from [143]. 

 
133
 
DEFINITION [54]: Let S be a non-empty set completely ordered by transitive, 
irreflexive relation '<'. For all x, y ∈ S, exactly one relations x < y, x = y, y < x holds.  
 
For a, b ∈ S define  
  
(a, b)  
=  {x ∈  S /  a < x < b} 
[a, b)  
=  {x ∈  S / a ≤ x < b} 
(a, b]  
=  {x ∈ S / a < x ≤ b} and  
[a, b]  
=  {x ∈ S / a ≤ x ≤ b}. 
 
This notation we have used already we may use them as an algebraic structure viz. 
semigroups whenever the situation demands. 
 
Now we define a fuzzy semigroup.  
 
DEFINITION 1.10.1: Let (S, y) be a semigroup. A map µ: S → [0, 1] is called a fuzzy 
semigroup if µ(x y y) = min {µ(x), µ(y)} for all x, y ∈ S. 
 
From this definition we evolve the following. All algebraic structures viz. fuzzy 
groups, fuzzy rings, fuzzy near-rings, fuzzy semirings are obviously fuzzy semigroups 
as at least under one operation we have µ : X → [0, 1], X an algebraic structure we 
have µ(x ∗ y) = min{µ(x), µ(y)}. ∗ can be some closed operation on X.  
 
Let S denote a semigroup. A non-empty subset I of S is called a left-ideal of S if SI ⊂ I. 
I is called a right ideal if IS ⊂ I. I is said to be an ideal of S, if I is both a left and a 
right ideal of S. 
 
We call a non-empty subset L of S which is a left ideal of S to be prime if for any two 
ideal A and B of S such that AB ⊆ L, it implies that A ⊆ L or B ⊆ L. L is called quasi 
prime if for any two left ideals L1 and L2 of S, L1L2 ⊆ L then L1 ⊂ L or L2 ⊂ L and L is 
called weakly quasi prime if any one of the two left ideals of L1 and L2 of S such that L 
⊆ L1, L2 and L1L2 ⊂ L we have L1 = L or L2 = L. 
 
Let S be a semigroup. A function f from S to the unit interval [0, 1] is a fuzzy subset of 
S. A semigroup S itself is a fuzzy subset of S such that S(x) = 1 for all x ∈ S denoted 
by S. Let µ and δ be any two fuzzy subsets of S. Then the inclusion relation µ ⊆ δ is 
defined by µ(x) ≤ δ(x) for all x ∈ S. (1 – µ) is a fuzzy subset of S defined for all x ∈ S. 
 
(1 – µ)(x) = 1 – µ(x), µ ∩ δ and µ ∪ δ are fuzzy subsets of S defined by (µ ∩ δ)(x) = 
min{µ(x), δ(x)}, (µ ∪ δ)(x) = max{µ(x), δ(x)} for all x ∈ S. The product µ y δ is 
defined as follows: 
 
(µ y δ)(x) =

A fuzzy subset f of S is called a fuzzy left ideal of S if S o f ⊆ f and f is called a fuzzy 
right ideal of S if f o S ⊆ f. If f is both a fuzzy left and fuzzy right ideal then we call f a 
fuzzy ideal of S. Equivalently if f(xy) > max{f(x), f(y)} for all x, y ∈ S. 
 
THEOREM 1.10.1: Let f and g be fuzzy subsets of S. Then the following statements are 
true:  
 
i. 
f o (g ∪ h) = (f o g) ∪ (f o h).

DEFINITION 1.10.2: A fuzzy left ideal f is called prime if for any two fuzzy ideals f1 
and f2 ,  f1  o  f2  ⊆  f implies that fi  ⊆  f or f2  ⊆  f. 
 
The following theorem can be proved as a matter of routine.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.5: A fuzzy left ideal f of S is prime if and only if for any two fuzzy 
points xr , yt ∈ S (rt > 0), xr  o S o yt o S  ⊆   f implies that xr ∈ f or yt ∈ f.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.6: A left ideal L of S is prime if and only if fL is a prime fuzzy left ideal 
of S.  
 
Proof: Follows as a matter of routine. The reader who is not able to prove kindly refer 
[142, 143]. 
 
Now we proceed on to recall the definition of quasi prime ideals of semigroup S.  
 
DEFINITION 1.10.3: A fuzzy left ideal f is called quasi prime if for any two fuzzy left 
ideals f1 and f2; f1  o  f2  ⊆  f implies that f1 ⊆  f and f2 ⊆  f; f is called quasi semiprime 
if for any fuzzy left ideal g of S, g2 ⊆  f implies that g ⊆  f.  
 
Similar to the two theorems just stated we have the following two theorems.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.7: A fuzzy left ideal f of S is quasi prime if and only if for any fuzzy 
points xr, yt ∈ S (rt > 0), xr o S o yt ⊆ f implies that xr ∈ f and yt ∈ f.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.8: A left ideal L of S is quasi prime if and only if fL is a quasi prime 
fuzzy left ideal of S.  

 
136
 
Now we proceed on to recall the definition of fuzzy m-systems.  
 
DEFINITION 1.10.4: A fuzzy subset f of S is called fuzzy m-system if for any t, s ∈        
[0, 1) and a, b ∈ S, f(a) > t, f(b) > s imply that there exists an element x ∈ S such that 
f(axb) > t ∨ s.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.9: Let M be a subset of S. Then M is a m-system of S if and only if fM 
is a fuzzy m-system.  
 
Proof: For any t, s ∈ [0, 1) and a, b ∈ S if fM(a) > t, fM(b) > s, then a, b ∈ M. By 
hypothesis there exists an element x ∈ S such that axb ∈ M that is fM(axb) = 1. Thus 
fM(axb) > t ∨ s. 
 
Conversely let a, b ∈ M. Then fM(a) = fM(b) = 1. Thus for any t, s ∈ [0, 1), fM(a) > t, 
fM(b) > s which implies that there exists an element x ∈ S such that fM(axb) > s ∨ b. 
Therefore axb ∈ M.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.10: Let f be a fuzzy left ideal of S. Then f is quasi prime if and only if 
1 – f is a fuzzy m-system.  
 
Proof: It is easily obtainable by routine calculations, hence left as an exercise for the 
reader.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.11: A fuzzy left ideal f is called weakly quasi prime if for any two 
fuzzy left ideals f1 and f2 such that f ⊆ f1 and f ⊆ f2 and f1 o f2 ⊆  f then f1 ⊆  f or f2 ⊆  f.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.12: A left ideal L is weakly quasi prime if and only if f is weakly quasi 
prime.  
 
Proof: Please refer [143]. 
 
THEOREM 1.10.13: Let S be a commutative, f a fuzzy left ideal of S. Then the 
following statements are equivalent.  
 
i. 
f is prime.  
ii. 
f is quasi prime. 
iii. 
f is weakly quasi prime.  
 
Proof: (i) ⇒ (ii) ⇒ (iii) is obvious. (iii) ⇒ (i). Let f1 o f2 ⊂ f for any two fuzzy ideals 
f1 and f2 of S. Since S is commutative, so we have f is a fuzzy ideal of S and  
 
(f1 ∪ f) o (f2 ∪ f)  
⊆  
f1 o f2 ∪ f1 o f ∪ f o f2 ∪ f 2

THEOREM 1.10.14: Let f be a fuzzy left ideal of S. Then the following statements are 
equivalent.  
 
i. f is weakly quasi prime fuzzy left ideal of S  

 
137
ii. For any fuzzy ideals f1 , f2 ⊆ S if ( f1 ∪ f ) o ( f2 ∪ f ) ⊆  f  then f1 ⊆  f or f2  ⊆  f.  
iii. For any two fuzzy left ideals f1 , f2 ⊆ S if f1  ⊆  f and f1 o f2 ⊆  f then f1 = f or f2  ⊆  f.  
iv. For any two fuzzy ideals f1 , f2 ⊆ S, if (f1  ∪  f) o f2 ⊆  f then f1  ⊆  f or f2  ⊆  f.  
v. For any two fuzzy points ar, bt ∈ S (rt > 0) if (ar ∪ f) o S o (bt ∪ f) ⊆ f, then ar ∈ f 
or bt ∈ S.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.15: Let f be fuzzy left ideal of S and µ be a fuzzy subset of S satisfying 
that  
 
i. f ∩ µ = 0.  
ii. For any at, br ∈ µ (at ∪ f) o S(br ∪ f) ∩ µ ≠ 0. 
 
If g is a maximal fuzzy left ideal of S with respect to containing f and g ∩ µ = 0. Then 
g is a weakly quasiprime fuzzy left ideal of S.  
 
Proof: Let f1 and f2 be a fuzzy left ideal of S such that g ⊆ f1, f2 and f1f2 ⊆ g. If g ⊂ f1 
and g2 ⊂ f2 then there exists at ∈ f \ g, br ∈ f2 \ g, (rt > 0).  
 
Thus g ⊂ g ∪ L(at) ⊆ f1, g ⊂ g ∪ L(br) ⊆ f2.  
 
By hypothesis, we have  
 
(g ⊂ L(a r )) ∩ µ ≠ 0, (g ∪ L(b r )) ∩ µ ≠ 0. Let c k  ∈ (g ∪ L(a t))  ∩  µ (k > 0), dl ∈ (g 
∪ L(b r)) ∩ µ ( l > 0).  
 
Then (ck ∪ f) o S o (dl ∪ f) ⊆ (f1 ∪ f) o S o (f2 ∪ f) ⊆ f1 o S o f2 ∪ f1 ∪ S o f ∪ f o S o 
f2 ∪ f o S o f ⊆ f1 o f2 ⊆ g which contradicts with the fact that (ck ∪ f) o S o (dl ∪ f) ∩ 
µ ≠ 0. Hence the claim. 
 
Fuzzy ideals in i(f) and I(f) 
 
Let f be a fuzzy left ideal of S, we define two fuzzy subsets of S, denoted by i(f) and 
I(f) respectively as follows (∀ x ∈ S), 
 
i(f)(x) = ∨ {tα /
αt
x
∈ f, 
αt
x
 o S ⊆ f, tα ∈ [0, 1]}.  
 
 
I(f)(x) = ∨{tα / f o
αt
x
⊂ f, tα ∈ [0, 1]}. 
 
THEOREM 1.10.16: Let f be a left-ideal of S. Then i(f) is the largest fuzzy ideal of S 
contained in f.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.17: Let S be a semigroup with an identity e and f a prime fuzzy left 
ideal of S. If i(f) ≠ 0 then i(f) is a quasi prime fuzzy ideal of S.  
 

 
138
Proof: Let at and br (tr > 0) be fuzzy points of S such that at o S o br ⊆ i(f). Then (S o 
at o S) o (S o br o S) ⊆ i(f) ⊆ f.  
 
Since f is prime we have S o at o S ⊆ f or S o br o S ⊆ f. Say S o at o S ⊆ f. Using 
results we have S o at o S ⊆ i(f). Since S has an identity e so that at = (eae)t, et o at o et 
⊆ S o at o S ⊆ i(f).  
 
The following theorem is interesting.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.18: Let f be a fuzzy ideal of S. Then I(f) is the largest fuzzy 
subsemigroup of S such that f is a fuzzy ideal I(f).  
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader. Please refer [143]. 
 
THEOREM 1.10.19: Let S be a semigroup with an identity e, f a fuzzy left ideal of S but 
not a fuzzy ideal of S. Then the following statements are equivalent.  
 
i. f is a weakly quasi prime fuzzy left ideal of S. 
ii. If  f1 is a fuzzy left ideal of S such that f o f1 ⊆  f then f1 ⊆  f.  
iii. For any fuzzy point at ∈ S  if  f o (S o at ) ⊆  f, then at ∈ f.  
iv. f is the largest fuzzy left ideal of S contained in I(f).  
 
Proof: Refer [143].  
 
Now we proceed on to define the concept of strongly semisimple semigroups.  
 
DEFINITION 1.10.5: A semigroup S is called strongly semisimple if every left ideals of 
S is idempotent. A left ideal f of a semigroup S is called idempotent if f = f o f that is   
f 2 = f.  
 
The following result gives equivalent formulation of strongly semisimple semigroup. 
 
THEOREM 1.10.20: For a semigroup S the following conditions are equivalent. 
 
i. 
S is strongly semisimple. 
ii. 
For any a ∈ S, a ∈ SaSa. 
 
Proof: For any a ∈ S, since S is strongly semisimple we have L(a) = L(a)2. Thus L(a) 
= L(a)4. Since L(a)2 = (a ∪ Sa)(a ∪ Sa) ⊆ Sa ∪ SaSa then a ∈ L(a) = L(a)4 ⊆ (Sa ∪ 
SaSa), (Sa ∪ SaSa) ⊆ SaSa.  
 
Conversely let L be any left ideal of S. For any a ∈ L by (ii) we have a ∈ SaSa ⊆ 
L(a)L(a) ⊆ L2. Thus L ⊆ L2. Clearly L2 ⊂ L. Therefore L2 = L. 
 
The following theorem characterizes the strongly semisimple semigroups by means of 
fuzzy quasi prime left ideals of S. 
 
THEOREM 1.10.21: Let S be a semigroup. Then the following statements are 
equivalent.  

 
139
 
i. 
Every fuzzy left fuzzy ideal of S is idempotent. 
ii. 
For any two fuzzy left ideals f1 and f2 of S, f1 ∩ f2 ⊆ f1 o f2. 
iii. 
For any fuzzy point ar ∈ S, L(ar) ⊆ L(ar)2
. 
iv. 
For any fuzzy point ar ∈ S, ar ∈ S o ar o S o ar.  
v. 
Every fuzzy left ideal of S is a quasi semiprime fuzzy left ideal of S. 
vi. 
Every fuzzy left ideal of S is the intersection of all quasi prime fuzzy left 
ideals of S containing it.  
 
Proof: Since the proof is long, it is left for the reader to prove. The reader is advised 
to refer [143]. 
 
THEOREM 1.10.22: A semigroup S is strongly semisimple if and only if every fuzzy left 
ideal of S is idempotent.  
 
Proof: Follows easily by the definitions and the theorem.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.23: Let S be commutative. Then the fuzzy left ideals of S are quasi 
prime if and only if they form a chain and S is strongly semisimple.  
 
Proof: Let g and h be fuzzy left ideals of S. Since g o h is a fuzzy left ideal of S by       
g o h ⊂ S o h we have g ⊆ g o h ⊂ S o h ⊂ h or h ⊆ g o h ⊆ g o S ⊆ g. Thus the fuzzy 
left ideals of S form a chain. Moreover for any fuzzy left ideal f of S obviously f   2 ⊆ f. 
Since f o f ⊆ f 2 we have f ⊆ f 2 so that f 2 = f.  
 
Conversely let f, g be two fuzzy left ideals of S, and f o g ⊂ h. Since the fuzzy left 
ideals of S form a chain i.e. f ⊆ g or g ⊆ f we have f 2 ⊂ f o g ⊂ h or g2
 ⊆ f o g ⊆ h. 
By hypothesis f ⊆ h or g ⊆ h holds.  
 
Let X be an alphabet with 1 ≤ |X| ≤ ∞ and X+(X∗) is the semigroup (free monoid) 
generated from X with the operation of adjoin. F stands for 'fuzzy', and F(x) denotes 
the set of all fuzzy subsets of X. We denote the cardinality of

A where A ∈ F(X∗) by 
card A. 1 is the identity of X∗ and we let M be a monoid. For x, y ∈ M, and a given 
subset Y of a moniod M, we define 
 
x–1y = {z ∈ M / xz = y} 
xy–1 = {z ∈ M / x = zy} 
 
F(Y) = M–1YM–1 = {m ∈ M/ such that there exists u, v ∈ M, umv ∈ Y} and we use

DEFINITION 1.10.8: Let M be a monoid and let P be a F subset of F(M). An element m

DEFINITION 1.10.11: An F subset P of F(M) is called λ-complete in M if the F-
submonoid generated by P is λ-dense where λ ∈ [0, 1]. P is called F-complete if it is 
0-complete.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.26:  
 
i. 
Every λ-dense set is also λ-complete and  
ii. 
An F-subset A of F(X∗) is λ-complete if and only if F(
*
Aλ ) = X∗.  
 
Proof: Suppose that the F-subset P of F(M) is arbitrarily λ-dense. Then for any m ∈ 
M, there exists u, v ∈ M such that P(umv) > λ. So P(umv) ≥ P(umv) > λ. Thus P∗ is λ-
complete. (ii) implies, suppose that A of F(X∗) is λ-complete. Then A∗ is λ-dense and 
F(

Aλ ) = X∗ by earlier results. Suppose that F(
*
Aλ ) = X∗. Then for any m ∈ X∗ we 
have m ∈ F(

λ
A X∗, that there exists u, v ∈ X∗ such that A∗(umv) > λ. Thus 
A∗ is λ-dense and hence A is λ-complete.  
 
The following theorem is interesting but the proof is left for the reader.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.27: Let A ∈ F(X+) be an F-code. Let y ∈ X∗ be an unordered word 
such that X∗yX∗ ∩ X∗ = φ. Let U = X∗ – A∗ – X∗yX∗. Then the F-set B = A ∪ y(Uy)∗ is 
an F-complete code.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.28: Any maximal F-code is F-complete.  
 
Proof: Let A ∈ F(X+) be an F-code, which is not F-complete. If card (X) = 1, then A = 
φ and A is not maximal. If card (X) ≥ 2 consider a word u ∈

code.  
 
Now we recall the concept of λ-thin in a monoid.  
 

 
142
DEFINITION 1.10.12: An F-subset p ∈ F(M) of a monoid M that is not λ-dense (λ ∈ 
[0, 1]) is called λ-thin. P is called an F-thin set if P is 0-thin.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.29: If P is λ-thin then there is at least one element m in M that is λ-
incompletable for P. P ⇔ F(
λ
P ) ≠ M if and only if MmM ∩ 
λ
P  = φ.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.30: Let M be a monoid and PQ ∈ F(M). Then the P ∪ Q is λ-thin if 
and only if P and Q are λ-thin. If R is λ-dense and P is λ-thin, then R – P is λ-dense.  
 
Proof: It is a matter of routine, left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 1.10.31: For λ ∈ [0, 1], any finite F-subset of X∗ is clearly λ-thin. 
Furthermore if A and B are λ-thin subsets in F(X∗) then AB is a λ-thin set.  
 
Proof: Refer [72].  
 
THEOREM 1.10.32: Let A ∈ F(X+) be a λ-thin and λ-complete. λ ∈ [0, 1]. Let w be a

where G and D are the sets of right (respectively left) factors of w. Note that the set   
D × G is finite.  
 
Proof: Let z ∈ X∗. Since A∗ is λ-dense, the word wzw is λ-completable for A∗, thus 
for some u, v ∈ X∗, A∗(uwzwt) > λ. Since w is λ-incompletable for A, for any m, n ∈ 
X∗, A(mwn) ≤ λ. Thus w is not a factor of a word in 
λ
A .  
 
Here there exists two factorizations w = g1d = gd1 such that ug1, dzg, d1v ∈

THEOREM 1.10.33: Let A be an F-thin and F-complete subset in F(X∗). For any 
positive Bernoulli F-distribution Π f on X∗, we have Π f (A) ≥ 1.

A g–1) = Πf (d–1A∗g–1) = ∞. 
 
Now d(d–1A∗g–1)g ⊂ A∗. This implies Πf (d)Πf = (d–1A∗g–1)Πf (g) ≤ Πf (A∗). The 
positivity of Πf shows that Πf (dg) ≠ 0. Thus Πf (A∗) = ∞. Now Πf (A∗) ≤ ∑

THEOREM 1.10.36: Let A ∈ F(X∗) be a finite maximal F-code. For any non-empty 
subset Y of X, the F-code A ∩ Y∗ is a maximal F-code over Y. In particular, for each 
letter a ∈ X, there is an integer n such that A(an) > 0.

1.11 Fuzzy Sub-half groupoids and its generalizations 
 
In this section we recall the definition of non-closed fuzzy algebraic structures, 
namely fuzzy sub-halfgroupoids of a halfgroupoid, which is a generalization of a 
fuzzy group. Here we give the necessary and sufficient condition for the two fuzzy 
sub-halfgroupoids to have open fuzzy extension. Also we recall yet another new 
notion of the concept called anti fuzzy sub halfgroupoid and anti fuzzy extension and 
obtain some characterization theorems about them. We also recall the notion of 
normalized fuzzy extension and maximal fuzzy extension and obtain a relation 
between these two concepts. 
 
A new notion called fuzzy extension chains for half groupoids is studied 
characterization theorems for normalized fuzzy extension and maximal fuzzy 
extension are obtained. Also a relationship between fuzzy translation extension and 
fuzzy multiplication extension is given in this section.

sup{µ(x) | x ∈ P}] then {

generates the halfgroupoid P if 
and only if µ is a constant map. 
 
We denote by (P, *) the halfgroupoid where '∗' need not in general be closed or 
associative binary operation. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.1: Let P be a halfgroupoid. A map µ : P → [0, 1] is said to be a 
fuzzy sub-halfgroupoid of the halfgroupoid P if ab = c in P implies µ (c ) ≥ min {µ(a) , 
µ(b)} (Here ‘a b= c’ in P means that a, b, c ∈ P and a b = c). 
 
We illustrate this by an example.

under usual multiplication as a binary operation P is a half groupoid. Define µ: P → 
[0, 1] by µ(x) = 1 – x for every x ∈ P. Now, it is easy to verify that µ is a fuzzy sub-
halfgroupoid of the halfgroupoid P. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.1: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-halfgroupoid of a half groupoid P and a, b, c 
∈ P. Then µ (c ) ≥ min {µ(a) , µ(b)} does not in general imply a b = c in P.

DEFINITION 1.11.2: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two fuzzy sub-halfgroupoids of a 
halfgroupoid P such that  
 
i. 
µ1 (x) ≤ µ2 (x) for every x ∈ P. 
ii. 
if a b = c in P and  
 
µ1 (c) = min {µ1 (a), µ1 (b)} then µ2 (c) = min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)}. Then we say that µ2 is a 
fuzzy extension of µ1.

be a halfgroupoid with respect to usual multiplication.  
Define µ1, µ2 : P → [0, 1] by µ1 (x) = 1 – x for every x ∈ P and  µ2(x) = 1 – 2
x  for 
every x ∈ P and it is easy to verify that µ2 is a fuzzy extension of µ1. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.2: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two fuzzy sub-halfgroupoid of a halfgroupoid 
P. If µ2 is a fuzzy extension of µ1 and a b = c in P with µ2 (c) = min {µ2 (a) , µ2 (b)} 
then it need not in general imply µ1 (c) = min {µ1 (a) , µ1 (b)}. 
 
Proof: The proof is by an example. Take P and µ1 as in example 1.11.2. Define   
µ2: P → [0, 1] by µ2 (x) = 1 for every x ∈ P. Now if we take  
 
a =

It is easy to verify that µ2 (c) = 1, min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)}= 1. µ1 (c) = 2

µ1 (b)}= 0. This proves that µ2 (c) = min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)} and µ1 (c) ≠ min {µ1 (a), 
µ1(b)}. This completes the proof.

DEFINITION 1.11.3: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two fuzzy sub-halfgroupoids of a half 
groupoid P. Then the fuzzy extension µ2 (of µ1) is said to be an open fuzzy extension of 
µ if a b = c in P and µ1 (c) > min {µ1 (a), µ1 (b)} implies µ2 (c) > min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)}. 
µ2 is said to be closed fuzzy extension of µ1 if it is not an open fuzzy extension of µ1. 
 
The following example illustrates it.  
 
Example 1.11.3: Consider the halfgroupoid P = {– n, – (n – 1),  …, –1, 0, 1, …, n} 
under the usual multiplication. Define µ1, µ2 : P → [0, 1] by

It is easy to check that µ2 is an open fuzzy extension of µ1 
 
THEOREM 1.11.3: Every open fuzzy extension is a fuzzy extension but not conversely. 
 
Proof: Every open fuzzy extension is a fuzzy extension, directly follows from the 
definitions of open fuzzy extension and fuzzy extension. 
 
Converse is not true. This is explicit by the following example. 
 
Example 1.11.4: Let P be any halfgroupoid and µ1 be any fuzzy sub-halfgroupoid of 
the halfgroupoid P with o (Im (µ1)) ≥ 2. Then it is easy to verify that µ2 : P → [0, 1] 
given by µ2 (x) = 1 for every x ∈ P is a fuzzy extension of µ1. It is easily seen µ2 is 
not an open fuzzy extension of µ1. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.4: Let P be a half groupoid. A countable collection of fuzzy sub 
halfgroupoids of the halfgroupoids P, denoted by {µi | i = 0, 1, 2, 3, …} or { }

THEOREM 1.11.4: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two fuzzy sub half groupoids of a half 
groupoid P. If the fuzzy extension µ2 (of µ1) is an fuzzy extension of µ1 then µ1 (c) = 
min {µ1 (a), µ1 (b)} if and only if µ2 (c) = min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)}. 
 
We prove the converse of the contra positive method. Let ab = c in P and µ1 (c) ≠ 
min{µ1 (a), µ2 (b)} to prove µ2 (c) ≠ min {µ2 (a), µ1 (b)}. 
 
If ab = c in P and µ1 (c) ≠ min {µ1 (a), µ1 (b)}, then we have µ1 (c) > min {µ1 (a), 
µ1(b)} (since µ1 is a fuzzy subhalf-groupoid of the half groupoid P). 
 
This implies that µ2 (c) > min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)} (since µ2 is an open fuzzy extension of 
µ1). That is µ2 (c) ≠ min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)}. Hence we have proved that if ab = c in P and 
µ1 (c) ≠ min {µ1 (a), µ1 (b)} then µ2 (c) ≠ min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)}. This proves that if the 
fuzzy extension µ2 (of µ1) is an open fuzzy extension of µ1 then µ1 (c) = min {µ1 (a), 
µ1 (b)} if and only if µ2 (c) = min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)} for every ab = c in P.  
 
We illustrate the above theorem by an example. 
 
Example 1.11.6: Take µ1 and µ2 given by the half groupoid P = {– n1, – (n –1), …,–1, 
0,1,…, n} then it is easy to verify that if µ2 is an open fuzzy extension of µ1 then µ1(c) 
= min {µ1 (a), µ1 (b)} if and only if µ2 (c) = min {µ2 (a), µ2 (b)} for every ab = c in P. 
 

 
148
Since there are not many books on fuzzy algebra and especially no paper even on 
fuzzy half groupoids we are forced to give all definitions and results about them. 
 
Now we proceed on to give the definition of anti fuzzy extension. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.5: A fuzzy subset µ of a half groupoid P is said to be an anti-fuzzy 
subhalfgroupoid of the half groupoid P if ab = c in P implies µ(c) ≤ min{µ(a), µ(b)}. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.6: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two anti fuzzy subhalf-groupoids of a half 
groupoid P. Then µ2 is said to be an anti fuzzy extension of µ1 if the following two 
conditions hold good.  
 
i. µ1 (x) ≥ µ2 (x) for every x ∈ P.  
ii. if ab = c in P and µ1(c) = max {µ1(a), µ1(b)} then µ2(c) = max {µ2(a), µ2(b)}. 
 
As in case of fuzzy extension we can prove that if µ2 is an anti fuzzy extension of µ1 
and ab = c in P with µ2 (c) = max {µ2 (a) , µ2 (b)} then it need not in general imply 
that µ1 (c) = max {µ1 (a) , µ1 (b)}. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.7: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two anti fuzzy subhalf-groupoids of a half 
groupoid P. Then the anti fuzzy extension µ2 (of µ1) is said to be an open anti fuzzy 
extension of µ1 if a b = c in P and µ1 (c) < max {µ1 (a), µ1 (b)} implies µ2 (c) < 
max{µ2 (a), µ2 (b)}. 
 
If µ2 is not an open anti fuzzy extension of µ1 then we say that µ2 is a closed anti 
fuzzy extension of µ1. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.8: Let P be a half groupoid. A countable collection of anti fuzzy sub 
half groupoids of the half groupoid P, denoted by {µi i = 0, 1, 2, …} or { }
∞
=0
i
iµ
 is 
called an anti fuzzy extension chain for P if µi+1 is an anti fuzzy extension of µi for i = 
0, 1, 2, …. 
 
We give an example of an anti fuzzy sub-half groupoid and anti fuzzy extension.

take usual multiplication as the binary composition in P. Define µ: P → [0, 1] by µ (x) 
= x for every x ∈ P1. It is clear that µ is an anti fuzzy sub half groupoid of the half 
groupoid P. 
 
Define µ1, µ2 : P → [0, 1] by  
 
µ1 (x) = x for every x ∈ P and 
µ2 (x) = 2
x  for every x ∈ P 
 

 
149
Then it is easy to verify that µ2 is an anti fuzzy extension of µ1. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.5: Let P be a half groupoid. Then µ is a fuzzy subhalf-groupoid of the 
half groupoid P if and only if µc is an anti fuzzy subhalf-groupoid of the half groupoid 
P. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subhalf-groupoid of a half groupoid P and ab = c in P. Since 
µc(x) = 1 – µ (x) for every x ∈ P, we have µ (c ) ≥ min {µ (a) , µ (b)}if and only if 
µc(c) ≤ max {µc(a), µc(b)}. This proves that µ is a fuzzy subhalf-groupoid of the half 
groupoid P if and only if µc is an anti fuzzy sub-half groupoid of the half groupoid P.

Since µ2 is a fuzzy extension of µ1 and ab = c in P we have µ2(c) = min {µ2(a), µ2(b)}. 
Using the properties of min and max function we have 1 – µ2 (c) = max{1 – µ2 (a), 1 – 
µ2(b)}. That is

µ (c) = max {

µ is an anti fuzzy extension

Similarly we can prove the converse using the fact that 1 – max {a, b} = min {1 – a,  
1 – b} for all a, b ∈ [0, 1]. 
 
Proof of (ii): Let µ2 be an open fuzzy extension of µ1. To prove µc

As µ2 is an open fuzzy extension of µ1 and ab = c in P. We have µ2 (c) > min {µ2 (a), 
µ2(b)}. By the properties of min and max functions we have 1 – µ2 (c) < max {1 –

µ2(a), 1 – µ2(b)}. That is 
c
2
µ (c) < max {

2 is an open anti fuzzy

1. Conversely let µc

prove that µ2 is an open fuzzy extensions of µ1 using the fact 1 – max {a, b} = min {1

µ (x) = x for

Clearly

µ . This shows that µ2 is a fuzzy extension 
of µ1 if and only if

µ  is an anti fuzzy extension of

µ . 
 
Now we proceed on to define the concept of maximal fuzzy extension. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.9: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two fuzzy sub-half groupoids of a half 
groupoid P. A fuzzy extension µ2 (of µ1) is said to be the maximal fuzzy extension of µ1 
if there does not exist any fuzzy sub half groupoid µ of the half groupoid P such that 
µ2 ⊂ µ . 
 
Example 1.11.9: P = {1, 2, 3, …, n} be a half groupoid with respect to usual 
multiplication. Define µ1(x) = ½ for every x ∈ P and µ2(x) = 1 for every x ∈ P. It is 
easy to verify that both µ1 and µ2 are fuzzy subhalf groupoids of the groupoid P. Now 
we cannot find any fuzzy sub half groupoid µ of the half groupoid P such that µ2 ⊂ µ. 
Hence µ2 is the maximal fuzzy extension of µ1. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.10: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two fuzzy sub-half groupoids of a half 
groupoid P. A fuzzy extension µ2 (of µ1) is said to be a normalized fuzzy extension of 
µ1 if µ2(x) = 1 for some x ∈ P. 
 
In the above example the fuzzy subhalf-groupoid µ2 is a normalized fuzzy extension 
of µ1. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.7: Let µ1 and µ2 be any two fuzzy sub-half groupoids of a half 
groupoid P. If µ2 is the maximal fuzzy extension of µ1 then µ2 is a normalized fuzzy 
extension of µ1.  
The converse is not true in general. 
 
Proof: The first part of the theorem follows from the definitions of the maximal and 
normalized fuzzy extensions. The converse is not true. That is every normalized fuzzy 

 
151
extension need not in general be a maximal fuzzy extension which can be seen from 
the example in which P = {– n, – (n – 1), …, –1, 0, 1, 2, …, n},

α ∈ [0, 1 – sup{µ(x) ; x ∈ P}] then every fuzzy translation 
T
α
µ  of µ is a fuzzy sub-half 
groupoid of the half groupoid P. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-half groupoid of the half groupoid P and α ∈ [0, 1 – sup 
{µ(x) ; x ∈ P}]. For ab = c in P we have µ (c) ≥ max {µ (a), µ (b)} that is α + µ (c) ≥ 
α + min{ µ(a), µ(b)} that is α + µ (c) ≥ min{α + µ(a), α + µ(b)} (by min property) 
that is {

µ (c) ≥ min{

That is

µ  is a fuzzy subhalf-groupoid of the half-groupoid P.

Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-half groupoid of the half groupoid P and α ∈ [0, 1 – 
sup{µ(x) ; x ∈ P}]. We know by the earlier result 
T
α
µ  is a fuzzy sub-half groupoid of 
the half groupoid P. 
 
Clearly 
T
α
µ (x) ≥ µ (x) for every x ∈ P. Further if ab = c in P and µ (c) = min {µ (a),

µ (c) = min {

µ  is a fuzzy extension of µ.

be a half groupoid with respect to usual multiplication. Define µ: P → [0, 1] by µ (x) 
= 1 – x for every x ∈ P. Now it can be easily checked that µ is a fuzzy sub-half 
groupoid of the half groupoid P. For α = 3
1 we have 
T
α
µ (x) = 1 – x + 3
1  for every x ∈ 
P. It is easy to verify that 
T
α
µ  is a fuzzy extension of µ. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.10: Let µ be a fuzzy sub half groupoid of a half groupoid P and α ∈ 
[0, 1 – sup {µ(x)/ x ∈ P}]. If 
T
α
µ  is a fuzzy translation of µ then 
 
i. 
T
α
µ  is a maximal fuzzy extension of µ if and only if µ is a constant map. 
ii. 
 if µ has sup property then 
T
α
µ  is a normalized fuzzy extension of µ but not 
conversely. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-half groupoid P and α ∈ [0, 1 – sup {µ(x) x ∈ P}]. Then 
by earlier result 
T
α
µ  is a fuzzy extension of µ. 
 
Proof of (i): Let 
T
α
µ  be a maximal fuzzy extension of µ then 
T
α
µ (x) = 1 for every x ∈ 
P, that is µ (x) = sup {µ (y) | y ∈ P} for every x ∈ P. Hence µ is a constant map. 
Conversely let µ be a constant map, that is µ(x) = γ for every x ∈ P (where γ is a fixed 
element of [0, 1]. Now consider the fuzzy translation 
T
α
µ of µ 
T
α
µ (x) = µ(x) + α = γ + 
1 – γ = 1 for every x ∈ P. Hence 
T
α
µ  is a maximal fuzzy extension of µ. 
 
Proof of (ii): Let µ have sup property; that is for every subset A of P there exists x0 ∈ 
A such that µ (x0) = sup {µ(y)| y ∈ A}. If possible let as assume that 
T
α
µ  is not a 
normalized fuzzy extension of µ then 
T
α
µ (x) < 1 for every x ∈ P. That is µ(x) < 
sup{µ(y) | y ∈ P} for x ∈ P. Since µ has sup property for every subset A of P there 
exists x0 ∈ A such that µ(x0) = sup {µ(y) | y ∈ A}. So we get µ(x) < µ(x0) for every x 
∈ P. In particular for x = x0 we have µ(x) < µ(x0) which is a contradiction. Hence 
T
α
µ  
is a normalized fuzzy extension of µ. 
 

 
153
If 
T
α
µ  is a normalized fuzzy extension of µ then it does not in general imply that µ has 
sup property. This can be seen from the example given below. 
 
Consider the half groupoid P = [0, 1] under usual multiplication. Define µ : P → [0, 1] 
by µ(x) = 1 – x for every x ∈ P. It is easy to see that µ is a fuzzy sub-half groupoid of 
the half groupoid P. Let α ∈ [0, 1 – sup {µ(x) | x ∈ P}] then 
T
α
µ  is a normalized fuzzy 
extension of µ for there exists 0 ∈ P such that 
T
α
µ  (0) = 1. Take A = [0, 1] then A ⊆ 
[0, 1] and sup {µ(x) | x ∈ A} = 1. 
 
Now it is easy to verify that there is no x0 ∈ A such that µ(x0) = 1. Hence µ does not 
have sup property. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.12: A fuzzy subset µ of a set X has the weak sup property if there 
exist x0 ∈ X such that µ(x0) = sup {µ(x) | x ∈ X }. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.11: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a set X . If µ has sup property then µ 
has weak sup property but not conversely. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a set X. If µ has sup property then by the definition 
of sup property for every subset A of the set X there exist x0 ∈ A such that µ(x0) = 
sup {µ(y) | y ∈ A}. The above condition is true for every subset A of the set X. If we 
take A as X then there exists x0 ∈ A such that µ(x0) = sup {µ(y) | y ∈ X}. Hence µ has 
weak sup property. 
 
However the converse is not true this can be seen by the following example. 
 
Consider the set X = [γ, δ] where γ and δ are any two arbitrary fixed numbers in the 
interval [0, 1] with γ < δ. Define µ: [γ, δ] →[0, 1] by µ(x) = x for every x ∈ X. Then 
µ(δ) = sup {µ(x) | x ∈ X}. but for A = [γ, δ) we have sup {µ(x) | x ∈ A} = δ and there 
is no x0 ∈ A such that µ(x0) = δ. That is µ has weak sup property but µ does not have 
sup property.  
 
Hence we give the characterization for normalized fuzzy extension. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.12: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-half groupoid of a half groupoid P of α ∈ [0, 
1 – sup {µ(x) | x ∈ P}]. Then 
T
α
µ  is a normalized fuzzy extension of µ if and only if µ 
has weak sup property. 
 
Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-half groupoid of a half groupoid P and α ∈ [0, 1 – sup 
{µ(x) | x ∈ P}]. Let 
T
α
µ  be a normalized fuzzy extension of µ then by the definition of 
normalized fuzzy extension we have 
T
α
µ (x0) = 1 for some x0 ∈ P. That is µ(x0) = sup 
{µ(x) | x ∈ P} for some x0 ∈ P. Hence µ has weak sup property. 
 
Conversely let µ have weak sup property. Then there exists x0 ∈ P such that µ(x0) = 
{µ(x) | x ∈ P}.  
 

 
154
Now consider the fuzzy translation 
T
α
µ  of µ . 
T
α
µ (x) = µ (x) + 1 – sup{µ(x) | x ∈ P}.. 
Take x = x0, then we have 
T
α
µ (x0) = µ(x0) +1 – µ(x0) = 1. Hence 
T
α
µ  is a normalized 
fuzzy extension of µ. This completes the proof of the theorem.

Proof: Can be proved by similar ways using the techniques used in the earlier 
theorems. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.14: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-halfgroupoid of a half group P. If α ∈ [0, 1 –

Proof: Let µ be a fuzzy sub-halfgroupoid of a half groupoid P. If α ∈ [0, 1 – sup{µ(x)

T

µ  and the fuzzy multiplication

fuzzy sub-halfgroupoids of the half groupoid P. 
 
We see that for every x ∈ P,

µ (x) = β µ(x) ≤ µ(x) ≤ α + µ (x) =

µ (x). Also if        
ab = c in P and

µ (c) = min {

(a), α + µ(b)}(by min property) that is 
T
α
µ (c) = min{

µ  is a fuzzy extension of

β
µ  for every α ∈ [0, 1 – 
sup{µ(x) x ∈ P}] and β ∈ (0, 1]. Hence the theorem. It is to be noted that for β = 0 
the result is not true. 
 
Example 1.11.13: Consider the half groupoid P = {– n, –(n – 1), …, –1, 0, 1, …, n}

Now we introduce the notions of fuzzy equivalence relation as given by [144] and 
proceed on to recall the definition of fuzzy relation on the groupoid given by [70]. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.14: Let X and Y be two non empty sets, we call a map f: X × X → Y 
× Y a semi balanced map if  
 
i. Given a ∈ X there exists υ ∈ Y such that f (a, a) = (υ, υ).  
ii. f (a, a) = (υ, υ), f (b, b) = (υ, υ) imply that f (a, b) = (υ, υ).

A reflexive, symmetric and transitive fuzzy relation on a set is a fuzzy equivalence 
relation.

DEFINITION [70]: Let λ be a fuzzy relation on the groupoid D; λ is compatible on D if 
λ (ac, bd) ≥ min {λ (a, b), λ (c, d)} for all a, b, c, d ∈ D. 
 
A compatible fuzzy equivalence relation on a groupoid is a congruence. 
 
DEFINITION [45]: A fuzzy relation λ on the set X is G-reflexive if for all a ≠ b in X.

A G-reflexive and transitive fuzzy relation X is a G-pre order on X. A symmetric G- 
pre order on X is a G-equivalence on X. A compatible G-equivalence fuzzy relation 
on a groupoid is a G-congruence. 
 
THEOREM [45]: If λ is a G-pre order on the set then λ o λ = λ. 
 
DEFINITION [44, 45]: Let λ be a fuzzy relation on the set X and let 0 < α ≤ 1; λ is α-
reflexive on X if λ (a, a) = α and λ (a, a) ≤ α for all a, b ∈ X. An α-reflexive 
symmetric and transitive fuzzy relation on X is a fuzzy α-equivalence relation on X. 
We call a compatible fuzzy α-equivalence relation on a groupoid as α-congruence.  
 
Clearly a fuzzy α-equivalence relation is a fuzzy equivalence, if α = 1, and every 
fuzzy α-equivalence relation is α G-equivalence.  
 
Now we proceed on to recall definition of fuzzy equivalences and congruences on a 
groupoid. 
 
THEOREM [44, 45]: If µ is compatible fuzzy relation on the groupoid S and f is a 
groupoid homomorphism from D × D into S × S then f –1(µ) is a compatible fuzzy 
relation on D. 
 
Proof: Let a, b, c, d, ∈ D. Then we have f –1 (µ) (ac, bd) = µ (f (ac, bd)) = µ (f (a, b) y 
f (c, d) ≥ min {µ (f (a, b), µ (f (c, d)} = min{f –1 (µ) (a, b), f –1 (µ) (c, d)}. 
 
Hence f –1(µ) is a compatible fuzzy relation on D. 
 
THEOREM [44, 45]: If λ is a compatible fuzzy relation on the groupoid D and f is a 
groupoid homomorphism from D × D in to S × S then f(λ) is a compatible fuzzy 
relation on S. 
 
Proof: Let υ, ν, ω, r, ∈ S. In the case when either f –1(υ, ν) or f –1(ω, r) is empty we 
have f(λ)(υω, νr) ≥ 0 = min {f (λ) (υ, ν), f (λ) (ω, r)}.  
 
Now, consider the case when f –1 (υ, ν) and f –1 (ω, r) both are nonempty. Then f –1 
(υω, νr) is non-empty too. We then have

DEFINITION 1.11.15: Let X and Y be two non empty sets. A mapping f : X × X → Y × Y 
is called a semi balanced mapping, if  
 
i. 
Given a ∈ X there exists u ∈ Y such that f (a, a) = (υ, υ). 
ii. 
f(a, a) = (υ, υ) and f(b, b) = (ν, ν) where a, b ∈ X, υ, ν ∈ Y implies that 
f(a, b) = (υ, ν). 
 
One can easily verify the following result for the semi balanced mapping f. If f(a, b) = 
(υ, ν) where a, b ∈ X, υ, ν ∈ Y then  
 
i. 
f(a, a) = (υ, υ) and f(b, b) = (ν, ν).  
ii. 
f(b, a) = (υ, ν) and 
iii. 
given x ∈ X there exists a unique tx ∈ Y such that f(a, x) = (υ, tx ) , f(x, b) = 
(tx , ν) and f(x, x) = (tx , tx ). 
 
We give an example of a semibalanced map. 
 
Example 1.11.14: Let X = {a, b, c} and Y = {υ, ν, ω, r}. Consider the map f : X × X 
→ Y × Y defined by f (a, b) = f (c, b) = (υ, ν),  f (b, a) = f (b, c) = (ν, υ), f (a, c) = f (c, 
a) = f (c, c) = f (a, a) = (υ, υ) and f (b, b) = (υ, υ). Then, f is a semi-balanced map. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.16: If f is a semi-balanced map from X × X into Y × Y and µ is an α-
equivalence fuzzy relation on Y, then f –1(µ) is an α-equivalence fuzzy relation on X. 
 
Proof: Let a, b, ∈ X. Then f –1(µ)(a, a) = µ(f(a, a)) = α, because f(a, a) = (υ, υ) for 
some υ ∈ Y, and f –1(µ)(a, b) = µ(f(a, b)) ≤ α. Thus f –1(µ) is an α- reflexive fuzzy 
relation on X. 
 
Now f –1(µ)(a, b) = µ(υ, ν)(where f(a, b) = (υ, ν)) = µ (ν, υ) (by symmetry of µ) = 
µ(f(b, a)) = f –1(µ) (b, a).  
 
 

 
159
Further  
 
f –1 (µ) o f –1 (µ)(a, b)   
=  
sup min {f –1 (µ) (a, x), f –1 (µ) (x, b)}

= 
f –1(µ) (a, b). 
 
Hence f –1(µ) is an α-equivalence fuzzy relation on X. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.17: If µ is an α-congruence fuzzy relation on the groupoid S and f is a 
groupoid homomorphism from D × D into S × S which is a semi balanced map, then   
f –1(µ) is an α-congruence on D. 
 
Proof: Follows by the earlier theorems. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.16: Let f be a map from X × X into Y × Y . A fuzzy relation λ on X is 
f invariant if f (a, b) = f(a1, b1) implies that λ (a, b) = λ (a1, b1). A fuzzy relation λ on 
X is weakly f-invariant if f(a, b) = f(a1, b) implies that λ (a, b) = λ (a1, b). 
 
Clearly if λ is f-invariant then λ is weakly f-invariant but not conversely. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.18: Let f be a semi-balanced map from X × X into Y × Y. If λ is a 
weakly f-invariant symmetric fuzzy relation on X with λ o λ = λ , then λ is f-invariant. 
 
Proof: Let f (a, b) = f (a1, b1) = (υ, ν) where a, a1, b, b1 ∈ X , υ, ν ∈ Y. Given x ∈ X 
by definition there exists a unique tx ∈ Y such that f (x, x) = (tx, tx), f (a, x) = (υ, tx) = 
f (a1, x) and f (x, b) = (tx , ν) = f (x, b1). 
 
But λ is weakly f-invariant so we get λ (a, x) = λ (a1, x) and λ (x, b) = λ (x, b1). 
 
Lastly  
 
λ(a, b)  
=  
(λ o λ) (a, b)

=  
(λ o λ) (a1, b1) = λ(a1, b1). 
 
Hence λ is f-invariant.  
 
The following theorem can be deduced from the earlier theorems. 
 

 
160
THEOREM 1.11.19: Let f be a semi balanced map from X × X into Y × Y. If λ is an α-
equivalence (or G-equivalence) fuzzy relation on X which is weakly f-invariant then λ 
is f-invariant. 
 
DEFINITION [44, 45]: A mapping f : X × X → Y × Y is a balanced mapping if 
 
i. 
f (a, b) = (u, u) ⇒ a = b. 
ii. 
f(a, b) = (u, ν) ⇒ f(b, a) = (ν, u). 
iii. 
f(a, a) = (u, u) and f(b, b) = (ν, ν)⇒ f(a, b) = (u, ν) 
 
for all a, b ∈ X and u, ν, ∈ Y. 
 
A mapping f : X × X → Y × Y is a balanced mapping if and only if it is a one to one 
semi-balanced mapping. 
 
Now we give a condition under which the image of an α-equivalence fuzzy relation is 
an α-equivalence. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.20: Let f be a semi-balanced map from X × X onto Y × Y. If λ is an α-
equivalence fuzzy relation on X, which is weakly f-invariant, than f(λ) is an α-
equivalence on Y. 
 
Proof: Let u ∈ Y. But, f being an onto semi-balanced map there exist a, a' ∈ X such 
that f (a, a') = (u, u) = f (a, a). By the earlier theorem λ is f-invariant. Then we have 
here.

(λ is a symmetric fuzzy relation) = f (λ)(ν, u). 
 
Thus, f (λ) is a α-reflexive and a symmetric fuzzy relation on Y. Now, given x ∈ X 
there exists a unique tx ∈ Y such that f (a, x) = (u, tx),  f (x, b) = (tx, v) and f (x, x) = 
(tx, tx).

Consequently, f (λ) is an α-equivalence on Y. 
 
The following three results are a direct consequence of the above theorems got by 
combining a few of them.  
 
The proofs of these are left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.21: Let f be a balanced map from X × X onto Y × Y. If λ is an α-
equivalence fuzzy relation on X, then f (λ) is an α-equivalence on Y. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.22: Let f be a semi-balanced map and a groupoid homomorphism 
from D × D onto S × S. If λ is an α-congruence fuzzy relation on D, which is weakly f-
invariant then f(λ) is an α-congruence on S. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.23: Let f be a balanced map and a groupoid homomorphism from D × 
D onto S × S. If λ is an α-congruence fuzzy relation on D, then f(λ) is an α-
congruence on S. 
 
Images and preimages of fuzzy G-equivalences and G-congruences on a groupoid are 
recalled from [44] in the following. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.24: Let f be a semi-balanced map from X × X onto Y × Y. It λ is a G-
equivalence fuzzy relation on X, which is weakly f-invariant then f(λ) is a G-
equivalence on Y with δ ( f (λ)) = δ (λ). 
 
Proof: Let υ ≠ ν ∈ Y. Then there exists  a',  a  ≠  b  ∈ X  such  that  f (a, a') = (υ, υ) = 
f (a, a) and f (a, b) = (υ, ν) we then have

Thus f (λ) is a G-reflexive fuzzy relation on Y with δ (f(λ) = δ (λ). Symmetry and 
transitivity of f (λ) can be proved, as is evident from earlier theorems. 
 

 
162
The following three theorems are easily deducible from the earlier theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.25: Let f be a balanced map from X × X onto Y × Y. If λ is a G-
equivalence fuzzy relation on X, then f (λ) is a G-equivalence on Y with δ(f(λ)) = δ(λ). 
 
THEOREM 1.11.26: If f is a groupoid homomorphism and a semi-balanced map from 
D × D onto S × S and λ is a G-congruence fuzzy relation on D which is weakly f-
invariant then f(λ) is a G-congruence on S with δ ( f (λ)) = δ (λ). 
 
THEOREM 1.11.27: If f is a groupoid homomorphism and a balanced map from D × D 
onto S × S and λ is a G-congruence fuzzy relation on D, then f(λ) is a G-congruence 
on S with δ (f(λ)) = δ (λ). 
  
DEFINITION 1.11.17: Let µ be a fuzzy relation on Y and let f be a map from X × X into 
Y × Y. We say µ is f-stable, if f(a, b) = (υ, υ), where a ≠ b ∈ X and υ ∈ Y, implies that 
µ ( f (a, b)) ≤ µ ( f (x, x)) for all x ∈ X. 
 
The f-stable fuzzy relation is illustrated by the following example. 
 
Example 1.11.15: Consider the map f: X × X → Y × Y. Define the fuzzy relations µ 
and σ on Y as follows.

THEOREM 1.11.28: Let f be a semi-balanced map from X × Y into Y × Y and let µ be a 
G-equivalence fuzzy relation on Y which is f-stable. Then f –1(µ) is a G-equivalence on 
X with δ (f  –1(µ)) ≥ δ (µ). Further if f is onto then δ (f  – 1(µ)) ≥ δ (µ)). 
 
Proof: Let α ∈ X. Then f –1(µ)(a, a) = µ(f(a, a)) = µ(υ, υ) > 0 where υ ∈ Y. If a ≠ b ∈ 
X then f(a, b) = (υ, ν) for some υ, ν ∈ Y. In case υ = ν the f-stability of µ implies that

then obviously δ(f –1 (µ)) = δ (µ). As in the proof of the earlier theorem we can show 
that f –1 (µ) is a symmetric and transitive fuzzy relation. 
 
The following results also are left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.29: Let f be a balanced map from X × X into Y × Y and let µ be a G-
equivalence fuzzy relation on Y. Then f –1(µ) is a G-equivalence on X with δ (f –1(µ)) ≥ 
δ (µ). Further if f is onto then δ (f –1(µ) = δ (µ). 
 
Proof: Left for the reader. Please refer [45]. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.30: Let f be a groupoid homomorphism and a semi balanced map 
from  D  ×  D  into  S  ×  S , and  let  µ  be  a  G-congruence  on  Y  which  is  f-stable. 
Then f – 1(µ) is a G-congruence on X with δ (f –1(µ)) ≥ δ (µ). Further if f is onto then   
δ (f  – 1(µ)) = δ (µ). 
 
Proof: Follows directly by the earlier theorems. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.31: Let f be a groupoid homomorphism and a balanced map from D × 
D into S × S and let µ be a G-congruence on Y. Then f –1(µ) is a G-congruence on Y. 
Then f  –1(µ) is a G -congruence on X with δ (f – 1(µ )) ≥ δ (µ).  

 
164
 
Further if f is onto then δ (f  –1(µ) = δ (µ). 
 
For proof refer [45]. 
 
We proceed on to recall the definition of G-groupoid and P-fuzzy correspondence. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.18: Let S1, S2 and S3 be non empty sets and A : S1 × S2 → S3 a 
mapping. Then (S1, S2, S3, A) is a G-groupoid . If A1 and A2 are non empty sets and (P, 
≤ ) is a partially ordered set then a function A  : A1 × A2 → P is a binary P-fuzzy 
correspondence. By a P-fuzzy correspondence sometimes we consider a quadruple 
(A1, A2, P, A ).  
 
If A1 …, An are sets and (P, ≤) is a partially ordered set than a mapping A : A1 × …× 
An to P is an (n-ary) P-fuzzy correspondence on sets A1, …, An. Here we recall a 
special type of binary P-fuzzy correspondences such that (A1, ≤), (A2 ≤), …, (An ≤) are 
also partially ordered sets. We call such a correspondence PG- fuzzy correspondence. 
The notion of a binary PG-fuzzy correspondence is a generalization of the notion of a 
G-groupoid, since we obtain a binary PG-fuzzy correspondence when we equip all 
sets in a G-groupoid with orderings. 
 
If A  : A1 × … × An → P is a P-(or PG-) fuzzy correspondence for p ∈ P, a p-level 
correspondence is a function A  : A1 × A2 × … × An → {0, 1} defined by 
p
A (x1,…, xn ) 
= 1 if and only if A (x1, x2, ..., xn ) ≥ p.  
 
By AP we denote the corresponding p-level subset of A1 × A2 × … × An . Further more 
we denote the set of all level subsets of AP by A
p = {Ap | p ∈ P}. 
 
Since a P-fuzzy correspondence is a P-fuzzy set on a product of sets, the following 
results are recalled from [90]. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.32: If A  : A1 × A2 × … × An → P is a P fuzzy correspondence where 
(P, ≤) is a partially ordered set, then for every (x1, x2, …, xn ) ∈ A1 × A2 × … × An the 
following supremum exists in P ∨ (p ∈ P | 
p
A (x1, x2, …, xn ) = 1 and A ( x1, x2,…, xn ) 
= ∨(p ∈ P such that 
p
A (x1, x2, …, xn) = 1}. 
 
Proof: If A (x1, x2, …, xn) = q then 
q
A (x1, x2, …, xn) = 1 . If 
p
A (x1, x2, …, xn) = 1 
then A (x1,  …, xn) = q ≥ p. This means that q greater than all p for which 
p
A (x1, x2, 
…, xn) = 1, that is A  (x1, x2, …, xn) = q = ∨ ( p ∈ P | 
p
A (x1, x2, …, xn) = 1). 
  
THEOREM 1.11.33: If A  = A1 × A2 × … × An → P is a P-fuzzy correspondence then  
 
i. 
If p ≤ q for p, q ∈ P, then for every (x1, x2, …, xn) ∈ A1 × A2 × … An , 
q
A (x1, x2, …, xn) ≤ 
p
A (x1, …, xn).  
ii. 
If the supremum of a subset Q of P exists then ∩ (Ap | p ∈ Q) = A∨{p | p ∈ Q).  

 
165
iii. 
∪ (Ap | p ∈ Q) = A1 × … × An.  
iv. 
for every (x1, x2, …, xn) ∈ A1 × A2 × … × An ∩ (Ap ∈ A
p  | (x1, …, xn) ∈ 
P) belongs to the family AP of level correspondences of A . 
 
Proof: The results can be easily proved using the definitions.  
 
THEOREM 1.11.34: Let F = {Fi i ∈ I} be a family of subsets of A1 × A2 × … × An 
(crisp correspondences) such that 
 
i. 
U

ii. 
for every (x1,x2 , …, xn ) ∈ A1 × A2 × …× An ; ∩ (Fi ∈ F | (x1 , …, xn ) ∈ Fi ) 
∈ F.  
 
Let (F, ≤ ) be the partially ordered set dual to (F, ⊆ ). Then a P-fuzzy correspondence 
:
A  A1 × A2 × … × An → F defined with A (x1, …, xn) = ∩ (Fi ∈ F | (x1, …, xn) ∈ Fi ) 
has F as its family of level correspondences. Moreover for every Fi ∈ F, Fi = 
iF
A . 
 
Proof: By the condition (ii), A  is well defined. The only thing left to prove is that Fi 
= 
iF
A for all Fi ∈ F. 
 
Let Fi ∈ F then (x1, x2, …, xn) ∈
iF
A  if and only if A (x1, …, xn) ≥ Fi if and only if 
A (x1, …, xn) ⊆ Fj ; if and only if ∩ (Fj ∈ F | (x1, …, xn) ∈ Fj ) ⊆ Fi.  
 
Since (x1, …, xn) ∈ ∩ (Fj ∈ F | (x1, …, xn) is in Fj), then (x1, …, xn) ∈ Fj. On the 
otherhand if (x1, x2, …, xn) ∈ Fi, then (∩ (Fj ∈ F | (x1, …, xn) ∈ Fj ) ⊆ Fi and as 
proven above (x1, x2, …, xn) ∈ 
iF
A . 
 
Notations as given by [90]. 
 
Let A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 be partially ordered sets and B : A2 × A3 → A5 and D  : A1 
× A2 → A4, PG fuzzy correspondence. ( A , C ) where A  : A1 × A5 → P and C  : A4 
× A3 → P are PG-fuzzy correspondences and P is a partially ordered set, of the 
functional equation A (x, B(y, z) = C ( D (x, y),z) for given PC-fuzzy correspondences 
Band D . 
 
We see the equation A (x, B(y, z)) = C ( D (x, y), z) always has a nontrivial solution 
for arbitrary B: A2 × A3 → A5 and D : A1 × A2 → A4. Indeed for A  and C  we take 
arbitrary PG-fuzzy correspondences  
 
A  : A1 × A5 → L and C : A4 × A3 → L where L is a distributive lattice (i.e. partially 
ordered set). 
 
THEOREM 1.11.35: Let A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 be partially ordered set. Further more 
let B : A2 × A3 → A5 and D : A1 × A2 → A4 be PG-fuzzy correspondences which are 
surjections.

Let F be a family of ternary correspondences on A1 × A2 × A3 satisfying the following 
conditions: 
 
i. For every y, t ∈ A2 and z, u ∈ A3, x ∈ A1 and E ∈ F if B (y, z) = B (t, u) 
then E(x, y, z) = E(x, t, u). 
ii. For every x, z ∈ A1, y, t ∈ A2, u ∈ A3 and E ∈ F if D (x, y) = D (z, t) then 
E(x, y, u) = E(z, t, u). 
iii. For all (x, y, z) ∈ A1 × A2 × A3; ∩ (E ∈ F | E(x, y, z) = 1) ∈ F. 
iv. ∪(E / E ∈ F) = A1 × A2 × A3.  
v. For all E ∈ F, let the correspondence AE on A1 × A5 and CE on A4 × A3 be 
defined in the following way: 
 
   AE (x, y) = E(x, z, t) for B (z, t) = y. 
vi. CE (x, y) = E (υ, ν, y) for D (υ, ν) = x, then partially ordered sets F, FA = 
{AE / E ∈ F} and FC = {CE / E ∈ F} are isomorphic under the mappings    
f : FA → F defined f(AE) = E and g : FC → F defined by g(CE) = E. 
Solutions of the functional equation A  (x, B (y, z)) = C ( D (x, y), z) are 
PG-fuzzy correspondences.

It is important and interesting to note that PG-fuzzy correspondences such that all 
related partially ordered sets are equal (S, ≤), A  : S × S → S, B: S × S → S, C : S × 
S → S and D : S × S → S are semilattices i.e. groupoids satisfying commutative, 
idempotent and associative laws. We prove that if such A , B, C and D  are solutions 
of the functional equation then they are equal that is A  = B = C  = D .  
 
THEOREM 1.11.37: If (S, A ), (S, B ), (S, C ) and (S, D ) are semi-lattices such that 
for all x, y, z ∈ S, A  (x, B (y, z)) =C ( D (x, y), z) then A = B = C = D . 
 
Proof: Let x, y ∈ S. Then  
 
A (x, y) = A (y, x) = A (y, B(x, x)) = C ( D (y, x), x) = C ( D (x, y), x). 
A (x, B(y, x)) = A (x, B(x, y)) = C ( D (x, x), y) = C (x , y). 
A (x, y) = A (x, B(x, y))  
 
 
=  
A (x, B( B(x, y)), B(x, y)) 
 
=  
C ( D (x, B(x, y), B(x, y)) 
 
=  
C ( D ( B(x, y), x), B(x, y)) 
 
=  
A ( B(x, y), B(x, B(x, y))),  
 
 
=  
A ( B(x, y), B(x, y)). 
 
 
=  
B(x, y). 
 
Similarly we prove C  = D . 
 
This will find several applications in social groups, pattern recognitions, traffic, public 
relations and correspondences. 
 
Now using [110], we recall some results about lattice of all idempotent fuzzy subsets 
of a groupoids. 
 
We know from the definition of a fuzzy subset of a set S originally defined by [144] 
in his classical paper is a mapping from S into the real interval [0, 1]. If λ and µ are 
fuzzy subsets of S then the equality λ = µ and the inclusion λ ⊆ µ are defined 
pointwise, endowed with this partial order the set F(S) of all fuzzy subsets of S form a 
completely distributive lattice. The meet λ ∩ µ and the join λ ∪ µ the arbitrary 
supremum ∪ λi and the arbitrary infimum ∩ λi can be verified to have the following 
formulas. 
 
i. 
(λ ∩ µ) (x) = min {λ (x) , µ (x)}. 
ii. 
(λ ∪ µ) (x) = min {λ(x) , µ(x)}. 
iii. 
(∪ λi ) (x) = supi λ(x). 
iv. 
(∩ λi )(x) = infi λ(x), x ∈ S. 
 
The sup-min product of two fuzzy subsets λ and µ of a groupoid D is the fuzzy subset 
λ. µ of D defined by

If D is a semigroup and n is a positive integer, λn denotes λ y λ y … y λ (n times). 
 
Here we give some of the important subclasses of the class F(G) of all fuzzy subsets 
of a group G with identity e as follows:  
 
i. 
F–1(G) : It is the class of all λ ∈ F (G) such that 
λ

F0(G) : It is the class of all λ ∈ F (G) such that

F1(G) : It is the class of all λ ∈ F (G) such that

. It means F1 (G) 
is the set of all fuzzy subgroupoids of G. 
iv. 
F2(G) : It is the class of all λ ∈ F (G) such that λ y λ = λ. In other words 
F2(G) : F1(G) ∩ F–1 (G). 
v. 
F3(G) = It is defined by F3(G) = F1(G) ∩ F0(G). 
vi. 
F4(G) : It is the class of all fuzzy subgroups of G. 
 
It is easy to see that F4 (G) ⊆ F3 (G) ⊆ F2 (G) ⊆ F1 (G) and that F4 (G) ⊆ F3 (G) ⊆ 
F0(G) ⊆ F–1 (G). If D is a groupoid the classes F–1 (D), F1 (D) and F2 (D) are similarly 
defined. Besides, if D possesses an identity element the classes F0(D) and F3(D) are 
meaningful the figure shows the inclusion relation among the various Fi(G). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Throughout this note, D denotes a groupoid and G denotes a group with identity e, 
unless otherwise specifically stated.

for all x ∈ D. If x ∈ D and 0 < α ≤ 1, then the fuzzy subset of D that maps x to α and 
the other elements of D to 0 is the fuzzy point xα in D. 
 
For the sake of notational convenience we denote it by (x, α). Upon a moments 
reflection one realizes that the class M (D) of all fuzzy points in D is in fact the set of 
all join irreducible elements of the completely distributive lattice F (D).

Proof: Please refer [110]. F–1 (D) is not a sublattice of F(D) as is shown in by the 
example of [110]. 
 
Example [110]: We show in this example F–1 (D) is not closed under finite 
intersection. Let D = {1, –1, i, –i} with the usual multiplication of complex numbers. 
Let A = {1, i}, B = {–1, i, –i}. Let χA denote the characteristic function of A with 
domain D. We then have χA ⊂ 
2
A
χ
 = χA. χA where C denotes proper inclusion χB ⊂ 
2
B
χ
 = χB. χB, χA ∩ χB = χA∩B and (χA ∩ χB) y (χA ∩ χB) = 
2)
B
A
(
∩
χ
. Consequently χA, 
χB ∈ F–1 (D) but χA ∩ χB and (χA ∩ χB) y (χA ∩ χB) are not even comparable. 
Nevertheless F–1 (D) does not form a join – sublattice of F(D). Infact, its members 
form a complete lattice. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.41: Let D be an arbitrary groupoid. Then  
 
i. 
F–1(D) is closed under the formation of arbitrary unions. 
ii. 
F–1(D) is a complete lattice under the meet λ ∧ µ and join

λ ∧ µ = {

∩ λ2 ∩ λ3 ∩ … = µ. In other words µ ∈ F–1 (D). Let δ ∈ F–1 be such that δ ⊆ λ. 
Because δ ⊆ δ2 ⊆ λ2, by induction we obtain δ ⊆ λn for all positive integers n. Hence 
δ ⊆ µ. Consequently µ =

The class F1(D) is not a sublattice of F(D) . This is explained by the example of [110]. 
 
Example [110]: Here it is proved that F1(D) is not closed under the formation of finite 
unions. Let D = {a, b, c, d} be the set with composition table:

 respectively and let µ 
be the fuzzy subset of D that maps a, b, c, d to 1,

 respectively. Then λ, µ, ∈ 
F1 (D), because the level subsets of them are all subgroupoids of D. However λ ∪ µ 
maps a, b, c, d to 1, 
3

2

 respectively. Clearly, λ ∪ µ ∉ F1 (D) because the level 
subset {a, b, c} is not a subgroupoid of D. Neverthless F1(D) does not form a meet 
sublattice of F(D). 
 
THEOREM [110]: Let D be an arbitrary groupoid then 
 
i. 
F1(D) is closed under the formation of arbitrary intersections.

THEOREM 1.11.43: Let D be a semigroup. 
 
i. 
If λ, ∈ F–1 (D) then λn, ∈ F–1 (D) for all positive integers n. In other words 
F–1(D) is the union of all the monogenic subsemigroups generated by its 
own elements. 
 
ii. 
If λ, ∈ F1 (D) then λn ∈ F1 (D) for all positive integers n. In other words

Now we proceed on to recall the fuzzy subgroupoid as given by [47]. In this study he 
uses the concept of t-norm as given by [150]. 
 
DEFINITION [150] : A t-normal is a function T : [0,1] × [0,1] → [0,1] satisfying for 
each x, y and z in [0,1]  
 
i. T (x,1) = x. 
ii. T (x, y) ≤ T (z x) if x ≤ z. 
iii. T (x, y) = T (y, x). 
iv. T (x, T(y,z)) = T(T(x, y), z). 
 
A few t-norms which are frequently encountered are Tm , Prod and Min defined by  
Tm (x, y) = Max (x + y –1, 0), Prod (x, y) = xy and 
 
Min (x, y) = 




DEFINITION 1.11. 20: A t-norm, T1 is stronger than a t-norm T2 if and only if T1 (x, y) 
≥ T2 (x, y) for all x, y ∈ [0,1]. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.52: Min is the strongest of all t-norms. 
 
Proof: Directly proved.  
 
Let X = (X, y) be a groupoid we will denote x y y by xy. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.21: Let X = (X, y) be a groupoid. A function µ: X → [0, 1] is a fuzzy 
subgroupoid of X with respect to a t-norm T, if and only if for every x, y ∈ X we have 
µ (xy) ≥ T (µ(x), µ(y)). 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.22: Let X1 and X2 be groupoid and let µ1 and µ2 be fuzzy 
subgroupoids of X1 and X2 respectively, with respect to a t-norm T. The fuzzy 
subgroupoids µ1 and µ2 are homomorphic (isomorphic) if and only if there exists a 
groupoid homomorphism (isomorphism) φ: X1 → X2 such that µ1 = µ2 o φ.  
 
In this situation we say that µ1 is given by pull back of µ2 along φ. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.53: Let µ be a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to Min then µ is a 
fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to any t-norm T.  
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader. 

 
178
 
DEFINITION 1.11.23: Let (X, y) be a groupoid. Let G denote the family of 
subgroupoids of X. G is called a generating family if for every element x ∈ X there 
exists a S ∈ G such that x ∈ S. {X} is a trivial generating family. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.24: Let (X, y) be a groupoid. An element e ∈ X is called an identity 
of X, if ex = xe = x for all x ∈ X. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.54: Let (X, y) be a groupoid, then X has at most one identity. 
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact if e and e' are two identities e = ee' = e'. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.55: Every groupoid is a subgroupoid of some groupoid with an 
identity. 
 
Proof: Let (X, y) be a groupoid. Let e be an element such that e ∉ X. Define an 
operation 'o' on the set X' = X ∪ {e} as follows x o y = x y y if x, y ∈ X; x o e = e o x 
= x for all x ∈ X, e o e = e. Then obviously (X, o) is a groupoid with identity e and 
(X, y) is a subgroupoid of (X', o). 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.25: We call (X', o, e) the identity extension of (X, y) by e. Let (X, y) 
be a groupoid. By the virtue of the above theorem we may assume that X has an 
identity whenever necessary, without loss of generality. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.56: Let (X, o) be a groupoid then there exists a unique identity 
extension of X up to isomorphism. 
 
Proof: Let (X', o, e) be constructed as in the proof of the earlier theorem. Suppose that 
(X'', , υ) is also an identity extension of X such that X" = X ∪ {u} with identity 
element u. It is easily shown that φ: X' → X" defined by 
 
φ(x) = 




is an isomorphism of groupoid X' onto X''. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.57: Let (X, y) be a groupoid. Let µ : X → [0, 1] be a fuzzy 
subgroupoid of X with respect to a t-norm T. Then µ can be extended to a fuzzy 
subgroupoid µ' of X' with respect to the same t-norm T, where X' is the identity 
extension of X. 
 
Proof: Let (X', o, e) be constructed as in the earlier theorem Let µ' : X' → [0, 1] be 
defined as 
 
µ'(x) =

Now for any x, y ∈ X' if x, y ∈ X then x o y = x y y ∈ X; hence µ'(x o y) = µ(x y y) ≥ 
T (µ(x), µ(y)) = T (µ'(x), µ'(y)) since µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to the 
t-norm T. Further more for any x ∈ X'; µ' (xoe) = µ'(x) = T (µ'(x), 1) = T (µ'(x), µ'(e)). 
 
Therefore µ' is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X' with respect to the same t-norm µ' X = µ. 
It (Ω , A , P) is a probability space then P is infact a fuzzy subset of A . Let Ω = 
[0,1]. Let L be the set of all Lebesgue measurable subsets in [0,1] and P be the 
Lebesque measure then (Ω, L, P) is a probability space. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.58: Let (Ω,A , P) be a probability space then (A , ∩) becomes a 
groupoid and P is a fuzzy subgroupoid of A  with respect to Tm . 
 
Proof: For any A, B ∈ A , we have P(A ∩ B) = P(A) + P(B) – P(A∪B) ≥ P(A) + 
P(B) – 1. Since P(A ∩ B) ≥ 0, we obtain P (A ∩ B) ≥ Max (P(A) + P(A) – 1,0) =  
Tm(P(A), P(B)). 
 
THEOREM 1.11.59: Let (X, y) be a groupoid and let (Ω,A , P) be a probability space. 
Suppose that the mapping, ψ: X → A satisfies ψ (x y) ⊇ ψ(x) ∩ ψ(y). Set µ(x) = 
P(ψ(x)) for all x ∈ X, then µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to Tm. One says 
that µ is induced by the mapping ψ and the probability space (Ω ,A , P). 
 
Proof: For any x, y ∈ X we have ψ (x y) ⊇ ψ(x) ∩ ψ (y) therefore by the above 
theorem it follows that µ(xy) = P (ψ (xy)) ≥ P (ψ (x) ∩ ψ (y)) ≥ Tm (P(ψ(x), P (ψ(y))) 
= Tm(µ(x) , µ(y)). 
 
The following result is direct hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.60: Let (X, y) be a groupoid and let (Ω,A , P) be a probability space. 
If µ: X → A  is a homomorphism from (X, y) to (A , ∩). Set µ(x) = P (ψ(x)), then µ 
is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to Tm induced by ψ and (Ω,A , P). 
 
THEOREM 1.11.61: Let (X, y) be a groupoid and G be a generating family of X. For x 
∈ X let Sx = {S ∈ Gx ∈ S} and let W = {Sx x ∈ X}. Let A be any σ -algebra on G 
which contains the σ - algebra generated by W and let m be a probability measure on 
(G, A). Then µ: X → [0,1] defined by µ(x) = m(Sx) for each x ∈ X is a fuzzy 
subgroupoid of X with respect to Tm. A fuzzy subgroupoid obtained in this manner is 
called “subgroupoid generated”. 
 
Proof: Let x, y ∈ X. Suppose that S ∈ Sx ∩ Sy; Then S is a subgroupoid of X 
containing both x and y. Consequently x y ∈ S and hence S ∈ Sx. Therefore Sxy ⊇     
Sx ∩ Sy. Define ψ : X → A by x →Sx. Then ψ (xy) = Sxy ⊃ Sx ∩ Sy = ψ(x) ∩ ψ(y). 
Set µ(x) = m (ψ(x)) = m(Sx) then by earlier theorem µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X 
with respect to Tm. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.62: Let (X, y) and all other symbols be the same as described in the 
theorem 1.11.61. If there exists an element e of X such that e is contained in every 
subgroupoid of the generated family G, then µ(e) = 1. 
 

 
180
Proof: Obviously Se = G and hence µ(e) = m(Se) = m(G) = 1.  
 
The following result is straightforward.  
 
THEOREM 1.11.63: Let all symbols be the same as described in the above theorem. If 
(X, y) is a monoid with the identity e then µ(e) = 1.  
 
Further we have a still stronger result. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.64: If (X, y) is a group. Let e be its identity, then µ(e) = 1 and µ(x–1) 
= µ(x) for all x ∈ X.  
 
Proof: Note that

 = m(Sx) = µ(x). It is pertinent 
to note that if (X, y) is a group then µ obtained in the Theorem 1.11.64 is just the 
"subgroup generated"; fuzzy subgroup of X. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.65: Let (Ω,A , P) be a probability space and τ be a non empty set. 
Let φ : Ω → τ be a mapping. Then φ induces a new probability space (τ, A, m) where 
A = {B ⊆ τ φ –1 (B) ∈ A } and for each B ∈ A, m(B) = P (φ –1 (B)). 
 
We say that (τ, A, m) is induced by φ and (Ω,A , P). 
 
THEOREM 1.11.66: Let (Ω , A  , P) be a probability space and τ be a non empty set. 
P(τ) denotes the power set of τ. Let φ : Ω → τ be a mapping. Suppose that (X, y) is a 
groupoid and there exists a mapping ψ : X → P(τ) such that  
 
i. 
φ –1 (ψ(x)) ∈ A  for all x ∈ X  
ii. 
ψ(x y) ⊇ ψ(x) ∩ ψ(y) for all x, y ∈ X. 
 
Set µ(x) = P(φ –1(ψ(x)) for all x ∈ X, then µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect 
to Tm. 
 
Proof: By the above result φ and (Ω , A , P) induce a new probability space (τ, A, 
m). Result follows by the earlier theorems.  
 
The following result is a direct consequence of the theorems proved; hence left for the 
reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.67: Let Ω = [0,1] and L be the set of all Lebesgue measurable sets on 
[0,1]. Let P by the Lebesgue measure. Suppose that we have a non empty set τ, a 
groupoid (X, y) and two mappings as follows: 
φ : Ω → τ, ψ : X → P(τ) satisfying  
 
i. 
φ –1(ψ(x)) ∈L for all x ∈ X. 
ii. 
ψ (xy) ⊇ ψ (x) ∩ ψ (y) for all x ∈ X. 
 
Set µ(x) = P (φ–1(ψ(x))) for all x ∈ X, then µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect 
to Tm.

Now we proceed on to recall properties of a fuzzy subgroupoid of a subgroupoid of a 
direct product. 
  
THEOREM 1.11.68: Let (X, y) be a groupoid and let Y be a fixed subgroupoid of X. 
Let (Ω , A , P) be a probability space and let (F,) be a groupoid of functions 
mappings Ω into X and  defined by pointwise multiplication in the range space. A 
further restriction is placed on F by assuming that for each f ∈ F, Xf = {w ∈ Ω | f(w) 
∈ Y} is an element of A . Then ν : F → [0,1] defined by ν (f) = P(Xf ) for each f in F 
is a fuzzy subgroupoid of F with respect to Tm. A fuzzy subgroupoid obtained in this 
manner is called “ function generated”. 
 
Proof: Let f, g ∈ F. Suppose ω ∈ Xf ∩ Xg. Then f(ω) ∈ Y. Since Y is a subgroupoid 
of X. (f o g)(ω) = f(ω) o g(ω)∈ Y and consequently ω ∈ Xfog. Therefore Xfog ⊇ Xf ∩ 
Xg. Now consider the mapping ψ : F → A . f → Xf. We have ψ (f o g) = Xfog ⊇ Xf ∩ 
Xg = ψ (f) ∩ ψ(g). Set ν(f) = P (ψ(f)) = P(Xf) for all f ∈ F, then by earlier results ν is 
a fuzzy subgroupoid of F with respect to Tm. 
 
It is pertinent to mention that for each ω ∈ Ω by defining Xω = X, we can construct a 
direct product 
ω
Ω
∈
ωΠ X  then (F, ) is in fact a subgroupoid of 
ω
Ω
∈
ωΠ X . 
 
If f ∈ F and f(ω) ∈ Y, for all ω ∈ Ω then ν (f) = 1. 
 
Now we recall the fuzzy subgroupoid representations. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.69: Every function generated fuzzy subgroupoid is subgroupoid 
generated. 
 
Proof: The proof is lengthy the reader is requested to refer [47].  
 
The proof of the following theorem is omitted and the reader is advised to refer [47]. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.70: Every subgroupoid generated fuzzy subgroupoid is isomorphic to 
a function generated fuzzy subgroupoid. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.71: Let (X, y) be a groupoid with the identity e and let ν be a fuzzy 
subgroupoid of X with respect to Min such that ν(e) = 1. For each t in [0,1] let Xt = 
{x ∈ X, ν (x) ≥ t}. Let a and b be in [0,1] such that a ≤ b; then  
 
i. Xt is a subgroupoid of X for every t in [0,1]. 
ii. Xb ⊆ Xa. 
iii. if x ∈ Xa – Xb for all b in (a, 1]; then ν (x) = a. 
 
Proof:  
 
i. For each t in [0,1] since ν(e) = 1 ≥ t we have e ∈ Xt. Hence Xt is not empty. 
For any x, y ∈ Xt it follows that ν(x) ≥ t, ν(y) ≥ t. Therefore ν(xy) ≥ 
Min{ν(x), ν(y)}≥ t; hence x y ∈ Xt. This shows that Xt is a subgroupoid of X. 

 
182
ii. For any x ∈ Xb we have ν(x) ≥ b. Since b ≥ a it follows that ν (x) ≥ a and so x 
∈ Xa. Hence Xb ⊆ Xa. 
 
iii. If x ∈ Xa – Xb for all b in (a, 1] then we have a ≤ ν (x) < b for all a < b ≤ 1. 
Hence ν(x) = a.  
 
Finally we state the following two theorems from [47] the proof is left for the reader 
to refer. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.72: Every fuzzy subgroupoid with respect to Min is subgroupoid 
generated. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.73: Let µ be a subgroupoid generated fuzzy subgroupoid with (X, y) 
and (G, A, m) and set Sx for x ∈ X, as described in the theorem 1.11.72. If there exists 
G* ∈ A which is linearly ordered by set inclusion such that m(G*) = 1 then µ is a 
fuzzy subgroupoid with respect to Min. 
 
The converse of the above theorem holds if (X, y) has an identity e such that µ (e) = 1. 
In this case we set G* = {χt | t ∈ [0,1]} then from the earlier result it is obvious that 
G* is linearly ordered with measure one. 
 
Some more algebraic properties are discussed in the following: 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.26: Give a groupoid. X = (X, y) a t-norm T and set I, for each i ∈ I,

It is evident that fuzzy subgroupoids of X with respect to a t-norm T form a complete 
lattice. In this lattice, the inf of a set of fuzzy subgroupoids µi with respect to T is just 
∩µi, while their sup is the least µ (i.e. the ∩ of all µ's) which ⊇ ∪ µi, where ∪µi (x) = 
sup µi (x) for all x ∈ X. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.27: Let f: X → X' be a homomorphism from groupoid X into 
groupoid X'. Suppose that ν is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X' with respect to a t-norm T. 
Then the fuzzy set µ = ν o f (defined by µ (x) = ν (f(x)) for all x ∈ X) is called the pre 
image of ν under f. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.75: Let µ = ν o f be the preimage of ν under f as described in the 
above definition, then µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to T. 
 
Proof: For x, y ∈ X we have µ(xy) = (ν o f) (x y) = ν (f(x y)) = ν (f(x), f(y) ≥ 
T(ν(f(x)), ν(f(y))) = T (µ(x), µ(y)). So by definition µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X 
with respect to T. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.28: Let f: X → X' be a homomorphism from groupoid X onto 
groupoid X'. Suppose that µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to a t-norm T,

THEOREM 1.11.76: Let f: X → X' be a homomorphism from groupoid X on to 
groupoid X. Suppose that µ is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to a t-norm T and 
that µ has the sup property. Let ν be a homomorphic image of µ under f as described 
in the earlier definition then ν is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X' with respect to T. 
 
Proof: Given f(x), f(y) in f(X) = X', let xo ∈ f–1(f(x)), yo ∈ f–1(f(x)) be such that

since

we have xo, yo ∈ f–1 (f(x), f(y)) hence

Therefore ν is a fuzzy subgroupoid of X' with respect to T. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy bigroupoid. The concept of bigroupoid is itself 
very new so the notion is fuzzy bigroupoid is totally absent in literature. Here we 
define fuzzy bigroupoid and recall just the definition of bigroupoid. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.29: Let (G, +, y) be a non empty set we call G a bigroupoid if G = 
G1 ∪ G2 and satisfies the following: 
 
i. 
(G1 , +) is a groupoid. 
ii. 
(G2 , y) is a semigroup. 
 
Example 1.11.16: Let (G, +, y) be a groupoid where G = G1 ∪ G2 with G1 a groupoid 
given by the following table: 
 
 

 
185
 
+ 
X1 
X2 
X3 
X1 
X1 
X3 
X2 
X2 
X2 
X1 
X3 
X3 
X3 
X2 
X1 
 
And G2 = S(3) the symmetric semigroup of mappings of (123) to itself.  
 
Clearly (G, +, y) is a bigroupoid. 
 
Now we define fuzzy bigroupoid as follows. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.30: Let (G, +, y) be a bigroupoid; G = G1 ∪ G2 proper subsets of 
G; with (G1, +) a groupoid and G2 a semigroup. µ : G → [0, 1] is said to be a fuzzy 
bisubgroupoid (or by default of notation fuzzy bigroupoid) if and only if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 
where µ1 from G1 → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subgroupoid and µ2: G2 → [0, 1] is a fuzzy 
subsemigroup. 
 
Thus almost all properties true in case of fuzzy groupoids and fuzzy semigroups can 
be easily extended to the case of fuzzy bisubgroupoids. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy loops and fuzzy biloops. 
 
DEFINITION [118]: Let G be a group. A fuzzy subset µ : G → [0, 1] is called a fuzzy 
subloop if for at least a triple x, y, z ∈ G we have µ((xy)z) ≠ µ(x(yz)). 
 
Study of this type was carried out by [118].  
 
Since all groups are loops we can define fuzzy subloop in a more generalized way as  
 
DEFINITION [118]: Let L be a loop A: L → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subloop of L if atleast for 
a triple x, y z ∈ L we have A((xy)z) ≠ A(x(yz)). 
 
DEFINITION [118]: Let L be a group or a loop. The fuzzy subloop V: L → [0, 1] is 
called a fuzzy Bruck subloop if P (x (yx) z) = P(x(y(xz))) and P (xy)–1 = P (x–1 y –1) for 
all x, y ∈ L. 
 
DEFINITION [118]: Let G be a group or a loop. A fuzzy subloop P of G (P: G → [0, 1] 
is a fuzzy Bol subloop of G if P(((xy)z)y) = P(x((yz))y) for all x, y, z ∈ G.  
 
DEFINITION [118]: Let L be a loop or a group. A fuzzy subloop P: L → [0, 1] is 
called a fuzzy Moufang subloop of L if P((xy(zx)) = P((x(yz))x) for all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.77: Every fuzzy subloop of a loop L need not in general be a fuzzy 
Moufang subloop of L. 
 
Proof: Consider the loop L given by the following table:

Define V : L → [0 1] by V(0) = 0, V(i) = 0.i for all i ∈ V. V ((14) (21)) = 0.2 = V (2) 
V((1(42)1)) = 0 = V(0) . So V is not fuzzy Moufang subloop of L. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.78: Let L be a loop or a group. The fuzzy subloop V of L → [0 1] is a 
right alternative fuzzy subloop of L if V((xy)y) = V(x(yy)) for all x, y ∈ L. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definition. 
 
THEOREM 1.11.79: Let L be a loop or a group. A fuzzy subloop V of L is a weak 
inverse property loop if V((xy)z) = 0 imply V(x(yz)) = 0 for all x, y, z ∈ L. 
 
Proof: Given V: L → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subloop of L, clearly if V((xy)z) = 0 imply 
V(x(yz)) = 0 then it is the weak inverse property as the result is true for all x, y, z ∈ L 
we have V to be a fuzzy subloop which satisfies weak inverse property. 
 
As we are not able to find any other means to define fuzzy subloop as to the best of 
the authors knowledge we do not have any other definition for fuzzy subloops we take 
this as the basic definition. Also we wish to mention the definition of fuzzy subloops 
given by us is distinctly different from the classical definitions of other algebraic 
structure. 
 
Also it is pertinent to mention here that all fuzzy subloops are not subloops for they 
do not satisfy the axiom of a subloop. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of fuzzy biloop; for which first we give the 
definition of biloop. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.31: Let (L, +, y) be a non empty set with two binary operations. L is 
said to be a biloop if L has 2 nonempty finite proper subsets L1 and L2 of L such that  
 
i. 
L = L1 ∪ L2. 
ii. 
(L1, +) is a loop. 
iii. 
(L2, y) is a loop or a group. 
 
We define fuzzy biloop and request the reader to refer [135] for more properties about 
biloops. 
 
DEFINITION 1.11.32: Let (L, +, y) be a biloop. A map µ : L → [0, 1] is called fuzzy 
biloop if we have (L = L1 ∪ L2 ) with (L1 ,+) a loop and (L2 , y) group or a loop) µ = 
µ1∪ µ2 where µ1 denotes the fuzzy subloop of L1 and µ2 is the fuzzy subloop of L2 (i.e. 

 
187
µ restricted to L1 is denoted by µ1 and µ restricted to L2 denoted by µ2 the symbol '∪ ' 
in µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is only by default of notation). 
 
All fuzzy properties studied for loops can be easily extended to fuzzy biloops in an 
analogous and routine ways. 
 
 
1.12 Miscellaneous Properties in Fuzzy algebra  
 
This section is devoted to the miscellaneous properties about fuzzy algebra which has 
not been covered in the earlier eleven sections like fuzzy continuous map on groups, 
fuzzy polynomial ring, fuzzy polynomial semiring, and finally the concept of fuzzy 
opposite sets and systems. Now we proceed on to recall the concept of fuzzy 
continuous map on groups. For more about these refer [139]. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.1: A fuzzy topology τ on a group G is called a g fuzzy topology. The 
pair (G, τ) is called a g-fuzzy topological space. 
 
Example 1.12.1: Let G = {1, –1} be the group with respect to usual multiplication 
and τ = {φG , 1G, λ, µ} where λ, µ : G → [0, 1] are given by 
 
λ(x) 
 =

Now the empty fuzzy set φG and the whole fuzzy set 1G are in τ. Further, it is easily 
verified that the intersection of any two members of τ is a member of τ and arbitrary 
union of members of τ is a member of τ. Hence τ is a g-fuzzy topology on G. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.2: Let τ1 and τ2 be g-fuzzy topologies on the group G1 and G2 
respectively. A function f : (G1 τ1) → (G2 τ2) is said to be a g-fuzzy continuous map 
from G1 to G2 if it satisfies the following conditions: 
 
i. 
For every µ ∈ τ2, f –1(µ) ∈ τ1 and 
ii. 
For every fuzzy subgroup µ (of G2) in τ2 , f  –1 (µ) is a fuzzy subgroup (of 
G1) in τ1 . 
 
This definition is illustrated by the following example. 
 
Example 1.12.2: Let G1 = {1, –1, i, –i} be a group with respect to usual multiplication 
and G2 = {e, a, b, ab} be the Klein four group, where a2 = e = b2, ab = ba and e is the 
identity element of the group G. The corresponding g-fuzzy topologies are given by   
τ1 = {

This proves f –1(µ) ∈ τ1 for every µ ∈ τ2. Further, it is easy to verify that f –1(µ) is a 
fuzzy subgroup of the group G1 whenever µ is a fuzzy subgroup of the group G2. 
Hence f is a g-fuzzy continuous map from G1 to G2.  
 
Both the conditions given in definition 1.12.2 are essential for in the above example if 
we take τ1 = {

1
G

(ii) of definition 1.12.2 holds good, but not condition (i) as f –1(µ2) ∉ τ1. Hence both 
the conditions given in the definition are essential.

THEOREM 1.12.1: Let G1 and G2 be any two groups. If τ1 is a g-fuzzy topology on the 
group G1 and τ2 is an indiscrete g-fuzzy topology on the group G2 then every function 
f: (G1 τ1) → (G2 τ2) is a g-fuzzy continuous map. 
 
Proof: A fuzzy topology τ is said to be an indiscrete fuzzy topology if its only 
elements are the empty fuzzy set and the whole fuzzy set. Let τ1 be a g-fuzzy topology 
on the group G1 and τ2 be an indiscrete g-fuzzy topology on the group G2. Since τ2 is 
an indiscrete g-fuzzy topology we have τ2 ={
2
G
φ
 , 
2
G

}.  
 
Let f : (G1 τ1) → (G2 τ2) be any function. We see that every member of τ2 is a fuzzy 
subgroup of the group G2. So it is enough to prove that for every µ ∈ τ2, f –1(µ)∈ τ1.

Let as consider the function f: G1 → G2 defined by f(x) = x2 for every x ∈ G1 . Thus

Clearly λ1 and µ1 are fuzzy subgroups of the group G1. Thus f is a g-fuzzy continuous 
map from G1 to G2 . Clearly λ1 and λ2 are fuzzy subgroups of the group G1. Thus f is 
a g-fuzzy continuous map from G1 to G2. 
 
THEOREM 1.12.2: Let τ1 and τ2 be any two discrete g-fuzzy topologies on the groups 
(G1, y) and (G2,∗) respectively. Then every group homomorphism f: (G1 τ1) → (G2 τ2) 
is a g-fuzzy continuous map but not conversely.  
 
Proof: We say a fuzzy topology τ on a set X to be a discrete fuzzy topology if it 
contains all fuzzy subsets of X. Let τ1 and τ2 be any two discrete g-fuzzy topologies 
on the groups (G1, y) and (G2, ∗) respectively and f be a group homomorphism from 
G1 to G2. Since τ1 and τ2 are discrete g-fuzzy topologies by the definition of g-fuzzy 
topology we have for every µ ∈ τ2; f –1(µ) ∈ τ1, here it is important to note that f –1 is 
not the usual inverse homomorphism from G2 to G1.

 for every x ∈ G1. This proves that f –1(µ) is a fuzzy 
subgroup (of G1) in τ1 and hence f is a g-fuzzy continuous map from G1 to G2 . 
 
The following example shows that a g-fuzzy continuous map need not in general be a 
group homomorphism. 

 
191
 
Example 1.12.4: Take G1 = {1, –1} and G2 = {1, ω, ω2} to be groups under the usual 
multiplication with discrete g-fuzzy topologies τ1 and τ2 on G1 and G2 respectively.  
 
Now define f : (G1, τ1) → (G2, τ2) by f(1) = 1 and f( –1) = ω. 
 
Since τ1 and τ2 are discrete g-fuzzy topologies, clearly for every µ ∈ τ2, f –1(µ)∈ τ1. 
Now we will prove that if µ is a fuzzy subgroup (of G2) in τ2 then f –1(µ) is a fuzzy 
subgroup (of G1) in τ1. Let µ be a fuzzy subgroup (of G2) in τ2 then we have the 
following two cases. 
 
Case (i): If µ = 
2
G
φ
or µ = 
2
G
1
 then clearly f –1(µ) is a fuzzy subgroup (of G1) in τ1. 
Case (ii): If µ =

 and µ ≠

G

then µ has the following form:

Hence f –1(µ) is a fuzzy subgroup (of G1) in τ1. Thus f is a g-fuzzy continuous map 
from G1 to G2. It is easy to verify that f(xy) ≠ f(x) (f(y)) for x = y = –1 ∈ G1. This 
proves that f is not a group homomorphism. 
 
THEOREM 1.12.3: Let τ1 and τ2 be any two g-fuzzy topologies on groups (G1, y) and 
(G2, ∗) respectively. Then every group homomorphism f: (G1 τ1) → (G2 τ2) need not in 
general be a g-fuzzy continuous map. 
 
Proof: To prove this theorem it is sufficient if we prove the result to be false for a 
particular τ1 and τ2 defined on any group G as in our definition of g-fuzzy continuous 
map we have not assumed G1 and G2 to be distinct.  
 
Let G be any group. Define two g-fuzzy topologies τ1 and τ2 on the group G as

f is a group homomorphism. For x ∈ G and µ ∈ τ2 we have

Now we proceed on to define g-fuzzy homeomorphism. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.3: Let (G1, τ1) and (G2, τ2) be any two g-fuzzy topological spaces. A 
function f: (G1, τ1) → (G2, τ2) is said to be a g-fuzzy homeomorphism if it satisfies the 
following three conditions. 
 
i. f is one to one and onto. 
ii. f is a g-fuzzy continuous map from G1 to G2 and  
iii. f –1 is a g-fuzzy continuous map from G2 to G1. 
 
We now give an example of a g-fuzzy homeomorphism. 
 
The following example will illustrate the g-fuzzy homeomorphism.

topologies

We know that a fuzzy subset of a set X is said to be a fuzzy point if and only if it 
takes the value 0 for all y ∈ X. expect on one element, say, x ∈ X.  
 
If its value at x is t (0 < t ≤ 1) then we denote this fuzzy point by x1. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.4: A fuzzy subset µ in a g-fuzzy topological space, (G, τ) is called a 
Qg-neighborhood of the fuzzy point xt (for x ∈ G) if and only if there exists fuzzy 
subgroup λ (of G) in τ such that λ ⊂ µ and xt q λ (where xt q λ means t+ λ (x) > 1 and 
xt is quasi coincident with λ). 
 
This definition is illustrated by the following example: 
 
Example 1.12.6: Let G = {1, ω, ω2} be the group with respect to the usual 
multiplication, where ω denotes the cube root of unity.  
 
Let τ = {φG, 1G, λ, µ} where µ, λ: G → [0, 1] are given by

It is easy to verify that τ is a g-fuzzy topology on the group G. We observe that µ is a 
Qg - neighborhood of the fuzzy point ω0.5 as there exists a fuzzy subgroup λ ∈ τ such 
that λ ⊆ µ and the fuzzy point ω0.5 is quasi coincident with λ. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.5: A g-fuzzy topological space (G, τ) is said to be a g-fuzzy 
Housdorff space if and only if for any two fuzzy points xt and ys (x, y ∈ G and x ≠ y) 
there exist Qg - neighborhoods λ and µ of xt and ys respectively such that λ ∩ µ = φG. 
 
The following is a nice characterization theorem. 
 
THEOREM 1.12.4: Let f : (G1, τ1) → (G2, τ2) be a g-fuzzy homeomorphism. Then      
(G1 , τ1 ) is a g-fuzzy Housdorff space if and only if (G2, τ2) is a g-fuzzy Housdorff 
space. 
 
Proof: Let f : (G1, τ1) → (G2, τ2) be a g-fuzzy homeomorphism. Suppose we assume 
that (G1, τ1) is a g-fuzzy Housdorff space we prove (G2, τ2) is a g-fuzzy Housdorff

space. Let x1 and y1 be any two fuzzy points in τ2 with x ≠y (x, y ∈ G2) then f –1 (x) ≠ 
f –1(y) as f is one to one.

From the above equality we have f –1(xt) = (

Similarly we can prove that f –1(ys) = (

(
f

, are fuzzy points in τ1 we have f –1(xt ) and f –1(ys) are 
also fuzzy points in τ1 with f –1 (x) ≠ f –1 (y). 
 
By the definition of a g-fuzzy Hausdorff space there exists Qg -neighborhoods µx and 
µy of f –1(xt) and f –1(ys) respectively such that µx ∩ µy = 
1
G

i. λx ⊂ µx and f –1(xt) q λx. 
ii. λy ⊂ µy and f –1(ys) q λ y and 
iii. µx ∩ µy = 
1
G
φ
.  
 
Since f is a g-fuzzy continuous map from G1 to G2 and f –1 is a g-fuzzy continuous 
map from G2 to G1 there exists Qg – neighborhoods f (µx) and f(µy) of xt and ys 
respectively such that f(µx) ∩ f(µy) = 
2
G
φ
. Hence by the definition of g-fuzzy 
Hausdorff space (G2, τ2) is a g-fuzzy Hausdorff space. 
 
Conversely let (G2, τ2) be a g-fuzzy Hausdorft space. By a similar argument and by 
also using the fact that both f and f –1are g-fuzzy continuous maps we can prove that 
(G1, τ1) is a g-fuzzy Hausdorff space. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy polynomial rings and fuzzy polynomial 
semirings. 
 

 
195
We define it in a very different way and in fact it is also quite new. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.6: Let [0, 1] be a closed interval of the real line. Let R be a 
commutative ring with 1 or the field of reals. The fuzzy polynomial ring in the 
variable x with coefficients from R denoted by R[x 
[0, 1]] consists of elements of the 
form

In order to make a ring out of R[x 
[0 , 1]] we must be able to recognize when two 
elements in it are equal, we must be able to add and multiply elements in R[x [0 , 1]] so

R[x[0,1]

Now unlike in a polynomial ring we see in case of fuzzy polynomial rings the degree

 ∈ R[x[0, 1]] we call p(x); a

and 1. 
 
It is pertinent to note that if p(x), q(x) ∈ R[x[0, 1]] of degrees γn and sn respectively then 
the degree of p(x) o q(x) can be γn + sn or γn + sn –1 depending on the fact whether γn 
+ sn ≤ 1 or γn + sn > 1 respectively. Thus deg (p(x) o q(x)) in general are not equal to 
deg p(x) + deg q(x) in fuzzy polynomials.

We have nice results analogous to usual polynomial rings. 
 
THEOREM 1.12.5: Let R[x[0, 1]] be the polynomial ring over the field of reals R. Then 
R[x[0, 1]] is an infinite dimensional vector space over R. 
 
Proof: Follows from the fact R[x[0, 1]] is an additive abelian group for any fuzzy 
polynomial ring and we have for all r ∈ R and p(x) ∈ R[x[0, 1]],  rp(x) ∈ R[x[0, 1]]. 
R[x[0, 1]] is a vector space over R since the interval [0, 1] is of infinite cardinality we 
say R[x[0, 1]] is a vector space with infinite basis.  
 
Can we have fuzzy polynomial rings which are finite dimensional or has a finite 
basis? The answer is yes. 
 
Example 1.12.7: Let R be the ring of integers R[x[0, 1]] = {all polynomial formed by x0 
= 1 x0.2, x0.4, x0.6, x0.8 and x with coefficients from R} = {α0 + α1x0.2 + α2x0.4 + α3x0.6 
+ α4x0.8 + α5x | α1, α2, α3, α4, α5 ∈ R}.  
 
Clearly R[x[0, 1]] is a finite dimensional vector space over R. 
 
Dimension of R[x[0, 1]] is 6. One of the basis is [1, x0.2, x0.4, x0.6,x0.8 and x] 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.8: Let R[x[0, 1]] be a fuzzy polynomial ring. A non empty subset P of 
R[x[0, 1]] is said to be a fuzzy polynomial subring of R[x[0, 1]] if P itself is a fuzzy 
polynomial ring under the operations inherited from R[x[0, 1]].  
 
One more major difference between a polynomial ring and fuzzy polynomial ring is 
that R[x[0, 1]] is not an integral domain even if R is a field. 
 
THEOREM 1.12.6: Let R be a field. R[x[0, 1]] be a fuzzy polynomial ring R[x[0, 1]] is not 
a field or an integral domain. 
 
Proof: To show R[x[0, 1]] is not a field or an integral domain we have to show R[x[0, 1]] 
contains two polynomials 0 ≠ p(x), 0 ≠ q(x) ∈ R[x[0, 1]] with p(x) o q(x) = 0. Take p(x) 
= x + x0.5 and q(x) = 1 – x0.5. 
 
p(x) o q(x)  
= 
(x + x0.5) (1 – x0.5) 
  
    
=  
x + x0.5 – x0.5 – x1 
 
  
= 
x + x0.5 – x0.5 – x 
= 
0. 
 
Hence the claim. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.9: Let R[x[0, 1]] be a fuzzy polynomial ring. A proper subset I of 
R[x[0, 1]] is said to be a fuzzy polynomial ideal of the fuzzy polynomial ring if  
 
i. I is a fuzzy polynomial subring of R[x[0, 1]] 
ii. For every p(x) ∈ R[x[0, 1]] and q(x) ∈ I;  p(x) o q(x) ∈ I.

Example 1.12.8: Let Z2 = [0, 1] be the prime field of characteristic two and Z2[x[0, 1]] 
be the fuzzy polynomial ring. Can Z2[x[0, 1]] have fuzzy polynomial ideal?  
 
Several interesting results can be obtained in case of fuzzy polynomial rings. 
 
Now we proceed on to define fuzzy polynomial semirings. In this section S will 
denote a commutative semiring with unit or a semifield. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.10: Let S be a semiring. Let x be an indeterminate. We call S [x[0, 1]]

Example 1.12.9: Let p(x), q(x) be fuzzy polynomials in a fuzzy polynomial semiring 
Z[x[0, 1]]. p(x) = x0.11 + 18x0.2 + x0.7 + 3x0.9, q(x) = 3 + x0.21 + 8x0.71 + 11x. We say 
degree p(x) is 0.9 and degree of q(x) is 1, degree of p(x) o q(x) ≠ deg p(x) + deg q(x).  
 
We define fuzzy semifields in a different way not as fuzzy subsets. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.11: Let [0, 1] be a unit interval. Define operation ‘+’ and ‘y’ on   
[0, 1] by for all a, b ∈ [0, 1],

Then ([0, 1], +) is a commutative semigroup with 0 as its identity. Define ‘y’ on [0, 1] 
by a y  b as the usual multiplication. Clearly ([0, 1], +, y) is a semifield. We call this 
as a fuzzy semifield; as in our opinion when entries are from the unit interval we can 
call them as fuzzy semifield as fuzziness allows us to do so. 
 
We can also define fuzzy semirings in a different and classical way as follows. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.12: Let R be any ring and [0, 1] be the unit interval a map p : R → 
[0, 1] is said to be a fuzzy semiring if

ii. p(x y) = p(x) y  p(y). 
iii. p(0) = 0. 
iv. p(1) = 1 if R is a ring with 1. 
 
We say p is a fuzzy semifield if in p(x y) = p(x) y  p(y) = 0 i.e. p(x) y  p(y) = 0 if and 
only if p(x) = 0 or p(y) = 0. 
 
It is important to note that if R is taken as a semiring instead of a ring then any 
semiring homomorphism p from R to [0, 1] is a fuzzy subsemiring. If p is not a 
homomorphism then p is not a semiring. 
 
We have for p : R → [0, 1] which is a fuzzy subsemiring then p is said to be a strict 
fuzzy semiring if x + y = 0 implies x = 0 and y = 0 then p(x) + p(y) = 0 implies p(x) = 
0 and p(y) = 0. 
 
Once again we mention the fuzzy semiring in the usual sense has been carried out in 
the section on fuzzy semirings. Here we devote to see fuzzy semiring in a different 
perspective. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.13: Let V = [0, 1] be a fuzzy semifield. An additive abelian 
semigroup P with 0 is said to be a fuzzy semivector space over [0, 1] if for all x, y ∈ P 
and c ∈ [0, 1]; c x and x c ∈ P i.e. c[x + y] = c x + c y ∈ P. In short [0, 1] P ⊆ P and 
P [0, 1] ⊆ P. 
 
We define for the fuzzy semivector space defined in this manner the fuzzy semivector 
transformation. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.14: Let V be a semivector space over a semifield. Let F and P be 
fuzzy semivector spaces over [0, 1]. A map p : V → P is called a fuzzy semivector 
transformation if for all v ∈ V, p(ν) ∈ V. For every c ∈ F, p(c) ∈ [0, 1] such that   
p(cv + u) = p(c)p(ν) + p(u) where p(c) ∈ [0, 1] ; p(u), p(ν) ∈ P.

DEFINITION 1.12.15: Let P be a fuzzy semivector space over [0, 1]. The fuzzy 
dimension of P over [0, 1] is the minimum number of elements in P required to 
generate P. 
 
As in case of semivector spaces [134] several results in this direction can be 
developed and defined. But as in case of classical fuzzy semivector space we do not 
view fuzzy semivector spaces as a fuzzy subset. As once again we wish to state that 
our main motivation is the study of Smarandache fuzzy algebra we leave the fuzzy 
algebra development to the reader. 
 
Now we proceed on to define a system called fuzzy opposite sets and systems. This 
system happens to be opposite of the system [0, 1] denoted [0, 1] opposite. Here 1 
happens to be the least element and 0 happens to be largest element i.e. for example 
0.99 is an element closer to largest element 1 in the classical fuzzy sets and systems 
but in fuzzy opposite sets and systems 0.99 is an element closer to the least element. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.16: Let S be a set. A fuzzy subset A of S is a function A : S → [0, 1] . 
The fuzzy opposite subset or opposite fuzzy subset for the same function. A denoted by 
Aopp is a map from S to [0, 1]opp. 
 
In most of the algebraic developments the opposite fuzzy subset which is a fuzzy 
subgroup or a fuzzy subring or a fuzzy ideal or a fuzzy module or a fuzzy vector space 
happens to give way to fuzzy opposite structures i.e. if A is a fuzzy subgroup of S with 
a modification Aopp happens to be opposite fuzzy subgroup. 
 
DEFINITION 1.12.17: Let G be a group. A fuzzy subset A of G is a fuzzy subgroup of 
G. If A : G → [0, 1] such  
 
i. A (x y) ≥ min{A(x), A(y)} for all x, y ∈ G.  
ii. A(x) = A(x –1) for all x ∈ G. 
 
Now Aopp is a fuzzy opposite subgroup if Aopp : G → [0, 1] such that  
 
i. Aopp(x y) ≤ max {A(x), A(y)}  
ii. Aopp(x) = Aopp(x –1) for all x, y ∈ G. 
 
Thus the notions of fuzzy normality and other notions can be developed using Aopp 
given A to be fuzzy algebraic structure. 

 
200
 
DEFINITION 1.12.18: Let A be a fuzzy subset of S i.e. A : S → [0, 1]. For t ∈ [0, 1] the 
set At = {x ∈ SA(x) ≥ t} is called the level subset of the fuzzy subset A. Now Aopp is a 
fuzzy subset of the set S. For t ∈ [0, 1]opp, the set At
opp = {x ∈ SA(x) ≤  t} is called 
the level subset of the fuzzy opposite subset A.  
 
Most results which hold good for fuzzy level subset can be carried out for level subset 
of fuzzy opposite subset A.

Chapter Two 
 
SMARANDACHE FUZZY SEMIGROUPS AND 
ITS PROPERTIES 
 
This chapter has five sections. In section one we give the definition of Smarandache 
fuzzy semigroup, describe several Smarandache definitions and give results. In 
section two we study the Smarandache fuzzy semigroups. Here we have given 28 
Smarandache fuzzy definitions of a S-semigroup and we have developed these 
properties in about 67 theorems. Section three analyzes about elementwise S-fuzzy 
properties in S-semigroups. About 30 new definitions in this direction are given and 
the properties enunciated in 59 theorems. The fourth section is devoted to the study of 
Smarandache fuzzy bisemigroups and bigroups. Thirty-two new definitions about S-
fuzzy semigroups are introduced and its properties are analyzed in 23 theorems. The 
chief attraction is the fifth section which proposes 54 problems for the reader to solve.  
 
 
2.1. Definition of Smarandache fuzzy semigroups with examples: 
 
In this section we for the first time introduce the concept of Smarandache fuzzy 
semigroups. Smarandache semigroups are thoroughly studied in the year [123]. Fuzzy 
semigroups were introduced in the late 1970s. To get the concept of Smarandache 
fuzzy semigroups we go for the concept of fuzzy groups; as Smarandache groups do 
not exist in literature we get almost all properties of groups to be present in 
Smarandache semigroups. Just for the sake of reader we recall the definition of 
Smarandache semigroup then proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy semigroup and 
give examples. 
 
DEFINITION 2.1.1: Let S be a semigroup. S is said to be a Smarandache semigroup 
(S-semigroup) if S has a proper subset P such that P is a group under the operations 
of S. 
 
Example 2.1.1: Let S(3) be a permutation semigroup. S(3) is a S-semigroup as          
S3 ⊂ S(3) and S3 is the permutation group of degree 3. 
 
Example 2.1.2: Let Mn×n = {(aij)aij ∈ Q} be the set of all n × n matrices with entries 
from Q. Mn×n is a semigroup under matrix multiplication. Pn×n = {
}
0
|
A
|
A
)
a(
ij

=
 
is a proper subset of Mn ×n which is a group. So Mn×n is a S-semigroup. 
 
The semigroup given in example 2.1.1 is a non-commutative S-semigroup of finite 
order where as in example 2.1.2 the semigroup is an infinite non-commutative S-
semigroup. 
 

 
204
Example 2.1.3: Let Z20 = {0, 1, 2, …, 19} be a semigroup under multiplication. 
Clearly,  Z20  is  a  S-semigroup  for  P  = {1, 19} is a subgroup in Z20.   This  is  a  
commutative  S-semigroup of finite order. 
 
Example 2.1.4: Let Q[x] be the ring of polynomials; Q[x] is a semigroup under 
multiplication. P = Q \ {0} ⊂ Q[x] is a group under multiplication; so Q[x] is an 
infinite commutative S-semigroup. 
 
As our main motivation in this paper is the study of Smarandache fuzzy semigroup we 
stop at this stage and request the reader to refer [123] for complete information 
regarding S-semigroup. 
 
Fuzzy semigroups are dealt in chapter one section ten. Now we proceed on to define 
Smarandache fuzzy semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.1.2: Let S be a S-semigroup. A fuzzy subset A of S is said to be a 
Smarandache fuzzy semigroup (S-fuzzy semigroup) if A : S → [0, 1] is such that A 
restricted to atleast one subset P of S which is a subgroup is a fuzzy group. That is for 
all x, y ∈ P ⊂ S. A(x, y) ≥ min {A(x) , A(y)} and A(x) = A(x–1) for all x in P. 
 
This S-fuzzy semigroup is denoted by AP i.e. AP : P → [0, 1] is a fuzzy group. 
 
Thus in case of S-fuzzy semigroup we face several situations which are enlisted below. 
Here S denotes a S-semigroup. Suppose P1, P2, …, Pn are proper subsets of S which 
are groups under the operations of S. 
 
A fuzzy subset A : S → [0, 1] may be a S-fuzzy semigroup or sometimes may not be    
S-fuzzy semigroup. So we call all fuzzy subsets from S to [0, 1] which are not S-fuzzy 
semigroups where S is a S-semigroup as Smarandache non-fuzzy semigroup (S-non-
fuzzy semigroup). 
 
If A : S → [0, 1] such that there exist atleast one subset Pi ⊂ S which is a group and 
iP
A is a fuzzy subgroup then we call the fuzzy subset P a S-fuzzy semigroup. 
 
If the fuzzy subset A : S → [0, 1] in such that 
iP
A : Pi → [0, 1], for i = 1, 2, …, n are 
fuzzy subgroups then we call the fuzzy subset A : S → [0, 1] a Smarandache strong 
fuzzy semigroup (S-strong fuzzy semigroup). 
 
Thus we see in general a fuzzy subset A : S → [0, 1] where S is a S-semigroup may be 
a S-fuzzy semigroup or a S-strong fuzzy semigroup or S-non-fuzzy semigroup. 
 
Example 2.1.5: Let S(3) be a S-semigroup. The map µ : S(3) → [0, 1] defined by

Thus µ : S(3) → [0, 1] is S-fuzzy semigroup. Further,  it is worthwhile to note               
µ : S(3) → [0, 1] is not a fuzzy subgroup. For if

We call these S-fuzzy semigroups as level I S-fuzzy semigroups. Now we proceed on 
to define Smarandache fuzzy semigroup of level II. 
 

 
206
DEFINITION 2.1.3: Let S be a S-semigroup A fuzzy semigroup A : S → [0, 1] is called 
the Smarandache fuzzy semigroup of level II (S-fuzzy semigroup of level II) if A 
restricted to one of the subsets P of S where P is a group is a fuzzy group that is        
AP : P → [0, 1] is a fuzzy group. 
 
THEOREM 2.1.1: All S-fuzzy semigroup of level II are S-fuzzy semigroup of level I. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition.  
 
It is important to note that the converse is not true. 
 
THEOREM 2.1.2: Let S be a S-semigroup, µ : S → [0, 1] be a S-fuzzy semigroup I. 
Then µ in general need not be a S-fuzzy semigroup II. 
 
Proof: Follows by a counter example.  Take  S(3)  which  is  a  S-semigroup.  Define 
µ : S(3) → [0, 1] by

Clearly µ is a S-fuzzy semigroup I and is not a S-fuzzy semigroup II. 
 
Now we reformulate the definition of S-fuzzy semigroup II in Smarandache language. 
 
Define S-strong fuzzy semigroup II.  
 
DEFINITION 2.1.4: Let S be a S-semigroup. A fuzzy semigroup A : S → [0, 1] is called 
the Smarandache strong fuzzy semigroup of level II (S-strong fuzzy semigroup II) if A 
restricted to every proper subsets Pi  which are subgroups in S i.e. 
iP
A : S → [0, 1] is 
a fuzzy group for every proper subgroup Pi  in  S.  
 
THEOREM 2.1.3: Let S be a S-semigroup. Every S-strong fuzzy semigroup II is a       
S-fuzzy semigroup and not conversely.  
 
Proof: Straightforward.  
 
DEFINITION 2.1.5: Let S be a S-semigroup µ : S → [0, 1] be a fuzzy semigroup. µ is 
said to be a Smarandache fuzzy semigroup III (S-fuzzy semigroup III) if µ has a 
proper subset σ such that σ ≤ µ and σ is a fuzzy subgroup. 
 
The study of inter relation between these three types of S-fuzzy semigroup is left as 
an exercise for the reader.

Clearly µ is a S-fuzzy semigroup. 
 
 
2.2. Substructures of S-fuzzy semigroups and their properties 
 
In this section we introduce the notion of S-fuzzy ideals in a S-fuzzy semigroup and 
also define and introduce several properties enjoyed by fuzzy groups as all S-fuzzy 
semigroups contain S-fuzzy subgroups. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.1: Let G be a S-semigroup. µ :G → [0, 1] is said to be a 
Smarandache fuzzy ideal (S-fuzzy ideal) of the S-fuzzy semigroup µ if µ(x) = µ(yxy–1) 
for all x, y ∈ A where A ⊂ G and A is a subgroup of G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.2: Let G be a S-semigroup and µ :G → [0, 1] be a S-fuzzy semigroup 
of G. For t ≤ µ (e), t ∈ [0, 1] the set µt = {x ∈ Aµ(x) ≥ t} is called the Smarandache 
level semigroup (S-level semigroup) of the S-fuzzy semigroup µ where A ⊂ G and A is 
the subgroup of the S-semigroup G. 
 
The following results are important. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.1: Let G be a S-semigroup with A ⊂ G is a proper subset of G which is 
a subgroup of G µ : G → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy semigroup if and only if µ (xy–1) ≥ min 
(µ(x), µ(y)) for all x, y ∈ A. 
 
Proof: The result is straightforward by the very definitions of fuzzy subgroup,           
S-semigroup and S-fuzzy semigroup. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.2: Let G be a S-semigroup. For t ≤ µ (e), t ∈ [0, 1] for a given t and 
given G and fixed µ we can have several S-level semigroups depending on the number 
of subgroups A in G.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.3: Let G be a S-semigroup. If A be a proper subset of G which is a 
subsemigroup of G and A contains the largest subgroup of G; then we call the fuzzy 
subset µ : G → [0, 1] to be a Smarandache fuzzy hyper subsemigroup (S-fuzzy 

 
208
hypersub semigroup) if µ restricted to P, i.e. µ : P → [0, 1], P ⊂ A and P is the 
largest subgroup of A is a fuzzy subgroup of G.

is a semigroup. µ : S (3) → [0, 1]. The restricted map µ : S3 → [0, 1] which is a fuzzy 
group. Then µ is a S-fuzzy hyper subsemigroup. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.3: Every S-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G in general need not 
be a S-fuzzy hyper subsemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: Follows from the very definition. 
 
COROLLARY 2.2.1: Every S-fuzzy hyper subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G is a           
S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: Direct hence left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.4: Let G be a S-semigroup. We say G is a Smarandache fuzzy simple 
semigroup (S-fuzzy simple semigroup) if G has no S-fuzzy hyper subsemigroup. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy symmetric semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.5: Let S(n) denote the symmetric semigroup i.e. the semigroup of all 
mapping of a set of n elements {1, 2, …, n} to itself S(n) under composition of 
mappings is a semigroup. 
 
Let  SF(S(n))  denote  the  set  of  all  Smarandache fuzzy subsemigroups  of  S(n).  If 
µ ∈ SF(S(n)) then Im µ = { f(x) x ∈ A ⊂ S(n)} where A is a proper subset of S(n) 
which is a subgroup of S(n) under the operations of S(n) Let µ, σ ∈ SF (S(n)) we say 
if |Im(µ)| < |Im(σ)| then we write µ < σ. By this rule we can define max SF (S(n)). Let 
f be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of S(n). If f = max SF(S(n)) then we say that f is a 
Smarandache fuzzy symmetric semigroup of S(n) (S-fuzzy symmetric semigroup of 
S(n)). 
 
Now we introduce a new concept called Smarandache co-fuzzy symmetric semigroup. 
To do this we just recall the definition of co-fuzzy symmetric group. 
 
DEFINITION [139]: Let G (Sn) = {g g is a fuzzy subgroup of Sn and g(C(Π)) is a 
constant for every Π ∈ Sn} where C (Π) is the conjugacy class of Sn containing Π , 
which denotes the set of all y ∈ Sn such that y = x Π x–1 for x ∈ Sn. If g = max G(Sn) 
then we call g as co-fuzzy symmetric subgroup of Sn . 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.6: Let SG (S(n)) = {g g is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of S(n) and  
g(C(Π))  is  constant  for  every Π  ∈  Sn  }  where  C (Π)  is  the  conjugacy class of  

 
209
Sn ⊂ S(n) containing Π  which  denotes  the set of all y ∈ Sn such that y = x Π x–1 (for 
x ∈ Sn). If g = max SG(S(n)) then we call g as Smarandache co-fuzzy symmetric 
subsemigroup of S(n) (S-co-fuzzy symmetric subsemigroup of S(n)). 
 
THEOREM 2.2.4: Every S-co-fuzzy symmetric subsemigroup of a symmetric 
semigroup S(n) is a S-fuzzy symmetric subsemigroup of the symmetric semigroup S(n). 
 
Proof: Follows from the definitions of S-fuzzy symmetric subsemigroup and S-co 
fuzzy symmetric subsemigroup.  
 
Now we proceed on to define yet another new concept called Smarandache fuzzy 
normal subsemigroup of a S-semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.7: A  S-fuzzy subsemigroup  µ  of  a  S-semigroup  G  is  said  to  be  
a  Smarandache fuzzy normal subsemigroup (S-fuzzy normal subsemigroup)  of  the  
S-semigroup G if µ(xy) = µ (yx) for all x, y ∈ A, A any proper subset of G which is a 
subgroup and µ restricted to A i.e. µ : A → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subgroup of A. 
 
Now we define Smarandache fuzzy cosets of a S-semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.8: Let  µ  be  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup  of  S-semigroup  G.  For  any 
a ∈ A ⊂ G (where A is the subgroup associated with this µ), a µ defined by (aµ)(x) = 
µ(a–1x) for every x ∈ A is  called  the  Smarandache  fuzzy  coset  (S-fuzzy coset) of 
the S-semigroup (S-fuzzy coset of the S-semigroup) G determined by a and µ. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.9: Let  µ  be  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup  of  a  S-semigroup  G  and H 
= {x ∈ A ⊂ Gµ(x) = µ(0)} (where µ is the associated S-fuzzy subsemigroup with A) 
then o(µ), order of µ is defined as o(µ) = o(H). 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.10: Let λ and µ be two S-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G. 
Then λ and µ are said to be Smarandache  conjugate  fuzzy  subsemigroups               
(S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups) of G (relative to the same A) if for some g ∈ A ⊂ G 
(A proper subset of G which is a subgroup) we have λ(x) = µ(g–1xg) for every x ∈ A. 
 
The main result on S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups of a S-semigroup G is as 
follows. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.5: If λ and µ are S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups relative to a 
subgroup A ⊂ G; where G is a S-semigroup, then o(λ) = o(µ). 
 
Proof: Let λ and µ be S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups of the S-semigroup G. By the 
very  definition  of  S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups of the S-semigroup there exists 
g ∈ A ⊂ G such that λ(x) = µ(
)

is the identity element of A ⊂ G. 
 
Clearly H is a subgroup of the subgroup A, for H is a t-level subset of the subgroup A 
where t = λ(e). Similarly K is also a subgroup of the subgroup A ⊂ G. 

 
210
 
To prove that o(λ) = o(µ) it is sufficient to prove o(H) = o(K), by the definition of the 
order of the fuzzy subgroup of the subgroup A. 
 
To prove that o(H) = o(K) as the first step we prove H ⊂ gKg–1 for some g ∈ A ⊂ G. 
In the second step we prove that for the same g ∈A; K ⊂ g–1Hg. 
 
Let x be any element in H. Since λ and µ are S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups of the 
subgroup A ⊂ G (equivalently of the S-semigroup G) we have for some g ∈ G. 
 
    µ (g–1x g)    = λ(x)  
= λ(e) (since x ∈ H) 
= µ(g–1eg) (since λ and µ are S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups of G) 
= µ (e). 
 
Hence there exists g ∈ A such that µ (g–1x g) = µ(e). Now by the definition of K we 
have g–1x g ∈ K implies x ∈ gKg–1. Therefore H ⊆ gKg–1. 
 
To prove the other inclusion:   Take  x  an  arbitrary element in K. Since λ and µ are 
S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups of the S-semigroup G for the same g ∈ A ⊆ G (A a 
proper subset which is a subgroup of the S-semigroup and λ and µ are conjugate 
fuzzy subgroup relative to this A ⊂ G; i.e. S-conjugate fuzzy subsemigroups of G) 
used in the earlier result to prove H ⊆ g K g–1 we have  
 
λ (gxg–1) = µ (x) 
 
= µ (e) (since x ∈ K)  
 
= λ(geg–1) (since λ and µ are conjugate fuzzy subgroups of A ⊂ G)  
 
= λ(e). 
 
Hence gxg–1 ∈ H for the same g ∈ A ⊆ G, that is x ∈ g–1H g. Hence K ⊆ g–1 H g.  
 
From the first and the second steps we have H ⊆ gKg–1 and K ⊆ g–1Hg, i.e. Hg ⊆ gK 
and gK ⊂ Hg Thus Hg = gK so H = gKg–1. Since K is a subgroup of the group A 
contained in the S-semigroup G we have o(xKx–1) = o(K) for every x ∈ A. Now 
choose x = g. Then we have o (gKg–1) = o(K). Therefore o(H) = o(K). Hence o(λ) = 
o(µ). Hence the theorem. 
 
Recall G a S-semigroup. A and B are S-fuzzy subsemigroups of G related to the 
subgroup P in G (P ⊂ G, P a proper subset of G which is a group) such that B ⊆ A. 
Let xt ⊆ A. Then the fuzzy subset xt o B (B o xt) is called the Smarandache fuzzy left 
(right) coset (S-fuzzy left (right) coset) of B in A with representative xt where by the 
operation ‘o’ we mean the following for all x ∈ P (xt o B) (x) = sup {inf {xt (y), B(z)} 
such that x = yz}. 
 
We give the following results which can be easily extended to S-fuzzy left (right) 
cosets in an analogous way. 
 

 
211
THEOREM 2.2.6: Let G be a S-semigroup. A be a S-fuzzy semigroup of G relative to a 
subgroup P ⊂ G. B be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup relative to P, such that B ⊂ A. Then for 
all z ∈ P, (xt o B) (x) = inf {t, B (x–1z)} and (B o xt) (z) = inf {t, B (z x–1)} for xt ∈ A. 
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy subgroups the proof is straightforward. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.7: Let A, B, and G as in the Theorem 2.2.6 Let xt, ys ∈ A. Then  
 
i. 
(xt o B) = (ys o B) if and only if inf {t, (B(e)} = inf {s, B (y–1x)} and                 
inf {s, B(e)} = inf {t, B (x–1y)}. 
ii. 
B o xt = B o ys if and only if inf {t, B(e) } = inf {s, B(xy–1)} and inf {s, B(e)} 
= inf {t, B (yx–1)}. 
 
Proof: Straightforward; hence left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.8: Let A, B, G be as in Theorem 2.2.6 Let xt, yt ⊆ A. If B(y–1x) = B(e) 
then xt o B = yt o B. 
 
Proof: Since B(x–1y) = B(y–1x) = B(e); inf{t, B(e)} = inf{t, B(x–1y)} = inf{t, B(y–1x)}. 
Hence by earlier results xt o B = yt o B. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.9: Let A, B, G be as in Theorem 2.2.6 Let xt, yt ⊆ A. Then the following 
conditions are equivalent. 
 
i. xt o B = yt o B. 
ii. (y–1x)t o B = et o B. 
iii. (x–1y)t o B = et o B. 
 
Proof: By earlier results we have xt o B = yt o B iff inf{t, B(e)}= inf{t, B(y–1x)} and 
inf{t, B(e)} = inf {t, B(x–1y)}. The latter conditions are equivalent to (ii) and (iii). 
 
THEOREM 2.2.10: Let  A,  B,  G  and  P  be  as  in  Theorem  2.2.6.  Let x, y ∈ P and 
s, t ∈ [0, A(e)]. Suppose that B (e) = A(e); then  
 
i. xt o B = ys o B if and only if t = inf {s, B (y–1x)}, s = inf { t, B (x–1y)}. 
ii. xt o B = yt o B if and only if (y–1x)t ⊆ B. 
iii. xt o B = ys o B if and only if t = s ≤ B (x–1y) 
iv. xt o B = xs o B if and only if t = s. 
 
Proof:  
 
i. 
By earlier results  xt o B  =  ys o B  if and only if  t  =  inf {s, B(y–1x)} and 
s = inf{t, B(x–1y)}. 
ii. 
By (i),  xt o B  =  yt o B  if and only if and only if  t  =  inf {t, B (y–1x)},     
t  =  inf{t, B(x–1y)} if and only if B(y–1x) ≥ t, B(x–1y) ≥ t. 
iii. 
By (i) and the fact that  B((y–1x)  =  B(x–1y);  xt o B  =  ys o B if and only if 
t  = s < B(x–1y). 
iv. 
Follows immediately from (iii).

The proof of the following theorem is true hence only stated and left for the reader to 
prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.11: Let s, t ∈ [0, A(e)]. Suppose that B(e) = A(e). If t ≠ s, then {xt o B 
xt ⊂ A} ∩ {ys o B ys ⊆ A} = φ.. 
 
We define Smarandache fuzzy normal subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.11: Let G be a S-semigroup. P a proper subset of G which is a group. 
A and B S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G relative to the subgroup P ⊂ G, B ⊂ A; B is said 
to  be  Smarandache  fuzzy  normal (S-fuzzy normal) in A if and only if for all xt ⊆ A, 
xt o B = B o xt. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.12: Let A, B and G be as in Definition 2.2.11 Let xt, ys ⊆ A. If B is fuzzy 
normal in A then (xt o B) o (ys o B) = (xy)r o B where r = inf {t, s}. 
 
Proof: ‘o’ operation is associative and B o B = B. The proof follows from [73, 74].  
 
THEOREM 2.2.13: Let A, B, P and G be as in Theorem 2.2.12. Let A / B =  {x1  o B 
x1  ⊂ A and x ∈ P}. Suppose that B is S-fuzzy normal in A. Then (A / B, o) is a 
semigroup with identity. If B(e) = A(e) then A / B is completely regular, that is A / B is  
union of (disjoint) groups. 
 
Proof: If xt o B , ys o B ∈ A / B , then clearly (xy)r o B ∈ A/ B where r = inf {t, s}. 
Clearly,  eA(e)  is  the  identity of A / B. ‘o’  is  an  associative  operation.  For  fixed     
t ∈ [0, A(e)], let (A / B)(t) = {xt o B xt ⊂ A, x ∈ P}. Then (A / B)(t) is closed under o, 
et o B is the identity of (A / B)(t) and (x–1) t o B is the inverse of xt o B. Hence (A/ B)(t) 
is a group.

G is S-semigroup. Define fuzzy subsets A and B of P ⊂ G where P = {a, b, e, c} the 
klein four group by A(e) = A(a) = 1, A(b) = A(c) = ¾ and B(e) = B(a) = 1, B(b)          
= B(c) = ½ with A(x) = B(x) = 0 for all other x ∈ G \ P. Then A and B are S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups of G such that B ⊂ A and B is S-fuzzy normal in A. Now e1 o B is the 
identity of A/B but e3/4 o B does not have an inverse. Hence A/B is not a group. 
 

 
213
THEOREM 2.2.14: Let G be a S-semigroup. A and B be S-fuzzy semigroup of G 
related to the subgroup P in G. (i.e P ⊂ G is a proper subset of G which is a group 
under the operations of G) such that B ⊂ A. B is S-fuzzy normal in A if and only if for 
all t ∈ [0, B(e)] Bt is normal in At. 
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.15: Let  A, B,  P and  G be as in Theorem 2.2.14. Suppose 0 ≤ t ≤ B(e), 
xs ⊆ A and t ≤ s. Then (xs o B)t = xBt and (B o xs)t = Bt x. 
 
Proof: y ∈ (xs o B)t if and only if (xs o B) (y) > t if and only if inf {s, B (x–1y)} ≥ t if 
and only if B (x–1y) ≥ t if and only if x–1 y ∈ Bt if and only if y ∈ xBt.  
 
THEOREM 2.2.16: Let t ∈ [0, B(e)]. Suppose that B is fuzzy normal in A. (A, B, G and 
P as in Theorem 2.2.14); then At / Bt  ≅ (A / B)(t). 
 
Proof: Refer [86] and the definition to prove this theorem. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.12: Let G be a S-commutative semigroup; i.e. every proper subset P 
of G which is a group is commutative. A, a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G related to P; P 
a subgroup of G.  B  is  S-fuzzy normal  in  A.  We  say  A  is  Smarandache bounded 
(S-bounded) over B if there exists n ∈ N such that for all xt ⊂ A, (xt)n ⊆ B. A is 
bounded over B if and only if At Bt is uniformly bounded for all t ∈ [0, A(e)].  Hence 
if  A  is  bounded  over  B  then  At / Bt  is  a  direct  product  of  cyclic  groups  for all 
t ∈ [0, A(e)]. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.13: Let G be a S-commutative semigroup. A be a S-fuzzy semigroup 
of G related to a subgroup P ⊂ G, such that C ⊂ A and A = B ⊗ C the Smarandache 
fuzzy direct product (S-fuzzy direct product) of B and C i.e. A = B o C for all x ∈ P, 
(B ∩ C)(x) = 0. Then At = Bt ⊗ Ct for all t ∈ [0, A(e)] Thus A/ B ≅

 we give some conditions for B to be a Smarandache fuzzy direct 
factor (S-fuzzy direct factor) of A. 
 
Let SF (A) denote the set of all S-fuzzy subsemigroups C of G (G a S-semigroup) such 
that C ⊆ A and C(e) = A(e). Let C ∗ = { x ∈ PC(x) > 0}. Then C ∗ is a subgroup of P. 
 
We  say  that  B  is  Smarandache compatible  (S-compatible)  in  A  if  and  only  if 
A(e) = B(e) and for all s, t ∈ (0, A(e)] , s ≤ t, As = At Bs and At ∩ Bs = Bt . It is shown 
that if B is Smarandache divisible (S-divisible) i.e. for all xt ⊆ B with t > 0 and for all 
n ∈ N there exists yt  ⊂  B  such  that  (yt)n  = xt, then it need not be the case that B is 
a S-fuzzy direct factor of A.  If  B  is  S-compatible in A and B is divisible, then B is a 
S-fuzzy direct factor of A. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.17: The following conditions are equivalent. 
 
i. 
A(e) = B(e) and there exist subgroup H of G (G a S-semigroup) such that 
for all t ∈ (0, A(e)], At = Bt ⊗ H. 

 
214
ii. 
There exists C ∈ SF(A) such that A = B ⊗ C and C ∗ = C ∗ where C ∗ = 
CC(0). 
iii. 
B is S-compatible in A and there exists C ∈ SF(A) such that A ∗ = B ∗ ⊗ C 
∗. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.18: Let A and B be S-fuzzy subsemigroups of the S-semigroup G such 
that B ⊆ A, we say that B is S-pure in A if and only if for all xt ⊂ B with t > o, for all n 
∈ N and for all yt ⊂ A, (yt)n = xt implies that there exists bt ⊆ B such that (bt)n = xt. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.19: Suppose that B is S-compatible and S-pure in A. 
 
i. If An/Bn is a direct product of S-cyclic groups, then B is a S-fuzzy direct 
factor of A. 
 
ii. 
If B is S-bounded then B is a S-fuzzy direct factor of A. 
 
Proof:  
 
i. Since B is S-pure in A, B∗ is S-pure in A∗. Hence there exists a subgroup H 
if A∗ such that A∗ = B∗ ⊗ H. Since B is S-compatible in A, At = Bt ⊗ H for 
all t ∈ (0, A(e)], the desired results follows from earlier results.  
 
ii. 
B∗ is S-pure in A∗ and B∗ is S-bounded. Hence there exists subgroup H 
of A∗ such that A∗ = B∗ ⊗ H. The result of the proof is direct. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.20: Suppose that B is S-compatible in A. If B is divisible, then B is a S-
direct factor of A. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.21: Let  G  be  a  S-semigroup. H  and  K  be  subgroups  of  G  such 
that H ⊄ K and K ⊄ H, then there exists a S-fuzzy subsemigroup µ of P × P such that 
σµ is not a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. (P ⊂ G is a proper subset which is a group). 
 
Proof: Let Ho = {(e, e)}, H1 = H × G and H2 = P × P. Let 1 ≥ t0 ≥ t ≥ t2 ≥ 0. Let µ be a 
fuzzy subset of P × P such that  
 
µ (Ho) = to 
µ (H1 \ H0) = t1 and 
µ (H2 \ H1) = t2. 
 
Then  µ  is  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup  of  P  ×  P, since  µt  is  a  subgroup of  P × P for 
all t ∈ Im(µ). Now there exists h ∈ H, k ∈ K such that k ∉ H and h ∉ K then hk ∉ H 
and hk ∉ K. Hence (hk, x), (x, hk) ∉ H1 for all x ∈ G. 
 
Then σµ(hk) = t2. Now since (h, k) ∈ H1 \ H0, σµ(h) = t1 = σµ(k). Thus σµ(hk) = t2 < t1 
= min {σµ(h), σµ(k)}. Hence σµ is not a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. 

 
215
 
THEOREM 2.2.22: Let σµ be a S-fuzzy semigroup of the S-semigroup G for all S-fuzzy 
subgroups µ of P × P ⊂ G × G (P a subgroup of G). Then either G is S a S- cyclic 
semigroup of order pm for some m ≥ 1 or P = Z ( p∞). 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of fuzzy subgroup. 
 
Interested reader may refer [86]. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.23: Let µ be a S-fuzzy semigroup of P × P ⊂ G × G. Then σµ (e) = 
µ(e,e) ≥ σµ (x) for all x ∈ P and σµ(x) = σµ (x–1) for all x ∈ P. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.24: Let G be a S-cyclic semigroup having cyclic subgroups of order pm 
for some m ≥ 1, where p is a prime. If µ is a S-fuzzy semigroup of P × P ⊂ G × G then 
σµ is a fuzzy subgroup of P. 
 
Proof: Follows from [86].  
 
THEOREM 2.2.25: Let  G  be  a  S-semigroup  having  a  subgroup Z (p∞) = P. If µ is 
a S-fuzzy semigroup of P × P ⊂ G × G, then σµ  is a fuzzy subgroup of P. 
 
Proof: Refer [86]. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.14: Let G be a S-semigroup under addition. A be a S-fuzzy semigroup 
of G relative to a  subgroup  of G  relative  to  a  subgroup P,  P  ⊂  G. We assume 
A(0) > 0. If x ∈ P then A(0) ≥ A(x). For t ∈ [0, A(0)], let At = {x ∈ P  A(x) ≥ t}, then 
At is a subgroup of P. For x ∈ P and t ∈ [0, 1] we let xt denote the fuzzy subset of P 
defined by xt (y) = t if y = x and xt (y) = 0 if y ≠ x. 
 
Then  xt  is  called  a  Smarandache fuzzy  singleton (S-fuzzy singleton). If  xt  and  ys 
are  S-fuzzy  singletons,  then  xt + ys  is  defined  to  be  the fuzzy subset (x + y)r 
where r = min{t,s}. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.15: Let G be a S-semigroup. A a S-fuzzy semigroup of G relative to 
the subgroup P, P ⊂ G. A  is  called  a  Smarandache  torsion  fuzzy  subsemigroup 
(S-torsion fuzzy subsemigroup) of G if and only if for all S-fuzzy singletons xt ⊂ A with 
t > 0 there exists n ∈ N (N – set of natural integers) such that n (xt) = 0.  
 
DEFINITION 2.2.16: Let G be a S-semigroup. A be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. A is 
called a Smarandache p-primary fuzzy 
subsemigroup 
(S-p-primary fuzzy 
subsemigroup) of G if and only if there exists a prime p such that for all S-fuzzy 
singletons  xt  ⊂  A with t  >  0  there exists n ∈  N ( N-natural  integers)  such  that    
p 
n (xt ) = 0 t . 
 
THEOREM 2.2.26: A is S-p-primary if and only if A∗ is S-p-primary. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove. 

 
216
 
THEOREM 2.2.27:  A  is  a  S-p-primary  if  and  only  if  At  is  S-p-primary  for  all    
t ∈ (0, A(0)] If A is S-p-primary then A∗ is S-p-primary. 
 
Proof: Easily follows by the very definitions and a matter of routine. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.28: Let p be a prime Define the fuzzy subset A(p) of G, G a S-semigroup 
by for all x ∈ P ⊂ G (P a subgroup of G), A(p) (x) = A(x) if x ∈ (A∗)p and A(p)(x) = 0 
otherwise. Then A(p) is a S-p-primary fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G and (A(p) )∗ = 
(A∗)p. 
 
Furthermore (A(p))t = (At)p for all t ∈ (0, A (0)]. 
 
Proof: As in case of groups refer [83]. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.29: Let p be a prime. Then A(p) is the unique S-maximal p-primary 
fuzzy subsemigroup of P (P ⊂ G) contained in A a S-fuzzy subsemigroup related to P. 
 
Proof: Refer [83]. 
 
For p a prime A(p) is the Smarandache p-primary component of A. Now we proceed 
on to define Smarandache divisible fuzzy semigroup of the S-semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.17: Let G be a S-semigroup. A be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. A is 
called Smarandache divisible fuzzy subsemigroup (S-divisible fuzzy subsemigroup) of 
G if and only if for all S-fuzzy singletons xt ⊂ A with t > 0 and for all n ∈ N there 
exists a S-fuzzy singleton yt ⊂ A such that n (yt) = xt. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.30: A is S-divisible if and only if At is S-divisible for all t ∈ (0, A(0)]. 
 
Proof: Follows by the very definition. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.31: If A is S-divisible then A∗ and A∗ are S-divisible. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.32:  If  A∗  is  S-divisible  and  A  is  constant  on  A∗ \ {0}  then  A  is  
S-divisible. 
 
Proof: Let xt ⊆ A. with t > 0 and n ∈ N. Then x ∈ A∗ and so there exists y ∈ A∗ such 
that x = ny. If y = 0 then x = 0 the result is true. Let y ≠ 0. Since A is constant on 
A∗\{0}, A(y) = A(x) ≥ t. Then yt ⊂ A and xt = n(yt) Hence A is S-divisible. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.33: Let G be a S-semigroup. P a subgroup of G. For all x, y ∈ P ⊂ G 
and n ∈ N, ny = x implies that A(x) = A(y) for all S-divisible fuzzy subsemigroups of P 
⊂ G if and only if P is torsion free. 
 

 
217
Proof: Follows as in case of groups by taking the S-semigroup G to contain a proper 
subset P such that P is a torsion free group and A : G → [0, 1] is such that A restricted 
to P is a divisible fuzzy subgroup A of P. 
 
Recall for G a S-semigroup A a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G related to P.   SF (A) = 
{B B is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup P such that B ⊆ A} = {B B is a fuzzy subgroup of 
P such that B ⊂ A}. Both are equal as S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G say A acts as a 
fuzzy subgroup on P, P ⊂ G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.18: Let B ∈ SF(A) Then B is said to Smarandache pure (S-pure) in A 
if and only if for all S-fuzzy singletons xt ⊆ B with t > 0, for all n ∈ N, for all yt ⊆ A, 
n(yt) = xt implies that there exists bt ⊂ B such that n(bt) = xt.  
 
Throughout this portion G is an additive abelian group and A fuzzy subgroup of G. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.34: Let B ∈ SF(A). Then B is S-pure in A if and only if Bt is S-pure in 
At  for all t ∈ (0, B (0)]. 
 
Proof: Follows from the very definition. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.35: Let B ∈ SF(A). If B is S-pure in A, then B∗  is S-pure in A∗. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.19: Let G be a S-semigroup. P a proper subset of G which is a 
subgroup of G. Let X be a fuzzy subset of P and let n ∈ N. Define the Smarandache 
fuzzy subset (S-fuzzy subset) nX of P ⊂ G by for all x ∈ P (nX)(x) = 0 if x ∉ nP and

THEOREM 2.2.36: Let n ∈ N then 
 
i. nA(0) = A(0). 
ii. nA ⊆ A. 
iii. nA is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of P; P ⊂ G. 
iv. If A has the sup property, then Im (n, A) ⊆ Im (A) where A is a          
S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G relative to the group P; P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof: Follows as in case of fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.37: Let B and C be S-fuzzy subsemigroups of the S-semigroup G 
related to the subgroup P. Then 
 
i. 
(B ∩ C)∗ = B∗ ∩ C∗
. 
ii. 
(B ∩ C)t = Bt ∩ Ct for all t ∈ (0, min {B(0), C(0)}]. 
 

 
218
Proof: Now B and C be S-fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G related to the 
subgroup P ⊂ G. x ∈ (B ∩ C)∗ if and only if (B ∩ C)(x) > 0 if and only if inf {B(x), 
C(x)} > 0 if and only if B(x) > 0 and C(x) > 0 if and only if x ∈ B∗ ∩ C∗. 
 
ii. x ∈ (B ∩ C)t if and only if (B ∩ C) (x) ≥ t if and only if inf {B(x), C(x)} ≥ t if and 
only if B(x) ≥ t and C(x) ≥ t if and only if x ∈ Bt ∩ Ct. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.20: Let A be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G, G a S-semigroup. If A∗ is 
Smarandache torsion free (S-torsion free) and for x ∈ nA∗ (n ∈ N) we have (n A) (x) 
= A(ω) for some unique ω ∈ A∗ such that x = nω. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.38: Let n ∈ N. Then  
 
i. 
(nA)∗ = nA∗. 
ii. 
nAt ⊆ (nA)t, for all t ∈ (0, A(0)] (A is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of the               
S-semigroup G related to the subgroup P, P ⊂ G).  
iii. 
Let B ∈ SF(A) and B(0) = A(0). 
 
If A has the sup property and B is pure in A, then n Bt = (nB)t for all t ∈ (0, A(0)]. 
 
Proof: Exactly as in case of fuzzy group as A is a S-fuzzy semigroup related to P ⊆ G. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.39: Let B, C ∈ SF(A) such that B(0) = C(0) = A(0) Then we have the 
following results to be true. 
 
i. Suppose that A has the sup property. If B is S-pure in A, then for all n ∈ N, nB 
= B ∩  nA. 
ii. Suppose that A and B have sup property. If for all n ∈ N, nB = B ∩  nA, then 
B is S-pure in A. 
iii. Suppose  that  A∗  is S-torsion free,  then  B  is  S-pure in A if and only if for 
all n ∈ N, nB = B ∩  nA.  
iv. For C ⊆ B. If C is S-pure in B and B is S-pure in A, then C is pure in A. 
v. If B is S-divisible then B is S-pure in A. 
vi. Suppose  that  A  is  S-divisible. Then  B  is S-pure  in  A  if  and  only  if  B  is  
S-divisible. 
vii. Let B ∈ S F (A) be such that B(0) = A(0). If for all xt ⊆ A such that xt ⊄ B, 
there does not exist n ∈ N such that n (xt) ⊆ B, then B is S-pure in A. 
 
Proof: The proof is for the reader to prove using the definitions. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.40: Suppose that A∗ is S-torsion free. Let {Bα α ∈ Ω} be a collection 
of S-fuzzy subsemigroups of the S-semigroup G such that Bα ⊂ A, Bα is S-pure in A

THEOREM 2.2.41: Suppose that A∗ is S-torsion free. Let B ∈ S F (A) be such that B(0)

THEOREM 2.2.50: Let B, C, D ∈ S F (A) be such that D ⊆ B and D (0) = A (0). 
Suppose that A = B ⊕ C. Then 
 
i. 
for all n ∈ N, n A = n B ⊕  nC. 
ii. 
D + C = D ⊕ C and B ∩ (D ⊕ C) = D. 
 
Proof: Matter of routine once we take B, C, D to be S-fuzzy subsemigroups we get 
the proof as in case of fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.51: Let B and C ∈ SF(A). If A = B ⊕ C then B and C are S-pure in A. 
 
Proof: Suppose that  nyt = x t  where  n ∈ N,  yt  ⊆ A and x t ∈ B. Since A = B ⊕ C, 
At  =  Bt ⊕ Ct. Thus Bt ∩ n A t =  nBt. Now ny t = (ny) t. Hence  ny  =  x, y ∈ A t  and  
x ∈ Bt. Thus there exists b ∈ Bt such that nb = x. Hence nbt = xt.. Thus B is a S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup in A is S-pure in A. 
 
Thus from these results we chiefly observe that those fuzzy results true in case of just 
groups can be very easily studied in case of S-semigroups by using S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup. Thus it is important to note that except for Smarandache structure such 
study would be certainly impossible. Now we give some interesting results on S-fuzzy 
semigroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.52: Let G be a finite S-semigroup. Suppose that there exists a S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup µ of G (for some proper subset P of G with P a subgroup of G) 
satisfying the following conditions for x, y ∈ P ⊆ G. 
 
i. 
µ(x) = µ(y) implies 〈x〉 = 〈y〉. 
ii. 
µ(x) > µ(y) implies 〈x〉 ⊂ 〈y〉. 
 
Then G is a S-cyclic semigroup. 
 
Proof: For x ∈ P ⊂ G, P a subgroup of a S-semigroup G. 〈x〉 denotes the subgroup 
generated by x. 
 
µ : G → [0, 1] such that µ restricted to P denoted by µP is a fuzzy subgroup of P, µ is 
a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G i.e. µP : P → [0, 1]. 
 

 
222
If µP is constant on P then µP(x) = µP(y) for all x, y ∈ P and so 〈x〉 = 〈y〉 by (i) 
consequently  P  =  〈x〉.  Let  us  assume  that  µP  is  not  constant  on  P.  Let  Im µP = 
{to, …, tn} with to > t1 > … > tn. Then the chain of level subgroups of µP in given by

THEOREM 2.2.53: Let G be a S-cyclic semigroup having cyclic group P (P ⊂ G) of 
order pα where p is a prime. Then there exists a S-fuzzy subsemigroup µP of G 
satisfying  µP(x)  =  µP(y)  implies 〈 x 〉 = 〈 y〉 and µP (x) > µP (y)  ⇒  〈 x 〉  ⊂  〈 y〉 
where µP : P → [0, 1] and x, y ∈ P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof: Consider the chain of subgroups of P ⊂ G; (e) = Po ⊂ P1 ⊂ …⊂ Pn = P where 
Pi is the subgroup of P generated by an element of order pi, i = 0, 1, 2,…, n and e is 
the identity element of P. Define a fuzzy subset µP of P by  µP(e) = to and µP(x) = ti if 
x  ∈  Pi  \  Pi–1  for all i = 1, 2, …, n; where to, t1, …, tn are numbers lying in the 
interval [0, 1] such that to > t1 > … > tn.  It is a  routine  matter  to  confirm  that  µP  is 
a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G satisfying the desired conditions. 
 
The result which follows is a consequence of the above two theorems. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.54: Let G be a S-semigroup having a subgroup P of order pα. Then G 
is S-cyclic  if  and  only  if  there  exists  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup µP  of  G  such  that  
for all x, y ∈ P, µ (x) = µ ( y) ⇒ 〈 x〉 = 〈 y〉 and µ(x) > µ(x) ⇒ 〈 x〉 ⊂ 〈 y〉. 
 
From now onwards till we explicitly specify L denotes a completely distributive 
lattice with minimum 0 and maximum 1. X a set, the elements of the direct power LX 
are called L-subsets of fuzzy subsets of X. f0 and f1 denotes the minimum and 
maximum respectively of Lx. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.22: Let G be a S-semigroup. P ⊂ G be a subgroup in G. The 
Smarandache normal fuzzy subgroups (S-normal fuzzy subgroups) of the S-semigroup 
G i.e. the L-subsets of P whose cuts are normal subgroups of P. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.55: An  S-L subsemigroup  f  of  P ⊂  G  is  normal  if  and  only  if       
f (x–1 z x) ≥ f(z) for all x, z ∈ P. Several interesting results in this direction can be 
developed for L-subsets.

We know for a group G µ be a fuzzy set of G. Then µ is a fuzzy subgroup of G if the 
following conditions hold  
 
i. µ (xy) ≥ min { µ (x) , µ (y)} for all x, y ∈ G. 
ii. µ(x–1) = µ(x) for x ∈ G. 
 
If µ is a fuzzy subgroup then it attains its supremum at ‘e’ the identity of G that is

The range set of fuzzy subgroup we shall denote by Im µ. It is well known that for a 
fuzzy subgroup µ the level subset µt for each t ∈ [0, µ(e)] is a subgroup of the given 
group and is called a level subgroup of µ. The set of all level subgroups of a fuzzy 
subgroup forms a chain. For µ a fuzzy subgroup of G, the level subset µt, for t ∈ Im µ 
is a subgroup of G and is called the level subgroup of µ. 
 
Now we proceed on to give a Smarandache analogue for these using S-semigroups as 
we do not have S-groups. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.23: Let µ be a fuzzy set in a S-semigroup G. If µ is a S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup of G associated with a proper subset P ⊂ G, P a subgroup of G. ‘eP’ 
the identity element of P.

we call µ(eP) to be the Smarandache tip (S-tip) of the S-fuzzy subsemigroup µ of G 
relative to the subgroup P ⊂ G . 
 
Unlike in the case of fuzzy subgroup of a group G we have in case of S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups  of  the  S-semigroup G  several S-tips  associated  even  with  a  single 
µ : G → [0, 1] i.e. if P1, …, PK are K subgroups in G and if µ is such that its 
restriction on each Pi happens to be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G and if

given µ. We call such maps µ and such S-semigroups G to be Smarandache multi-
tiped fuzzy semigroups (S-multi-tiped fuzzy semigroups). 
 
Example 2.2.3: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2,…, 11}; Z12 is a semigroup under multiplication 
modulo 12. In fact  Z12  is  a  S-semigroup.  The  subgroups  of  Z12  are  P1  = {1, 11}, 
P2 = {3, 9} P3 = {1, 5} , P4 = {1, 7} and P5 = {4, 8}. 
 
Clearly one can define a µ so that Z12 has several S-tips for 1, 3 and 4 are the units of 
the subgroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.24: Let G be a S-semigroup. µ : G → [0, 1] restricted to some subset 
P of G be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. We see a S-fuzzy subsemigroup as in case of a 
fuzzy subgroup may or may not attain its infimum. We shall write inf µP for

and refer to it as Smarandache tale (S-tale) of the S-fuzzy subsemigroup 
µ. Let µ and η be two S-fuzzy subsemigroups of the S-semigroup G related to the 
same subset P ⊂ G, P a subgroup of G. We say µ and η are Smarandache similarly 
bounded (S-similarly bounded) if they have the same S-tip and the same S-tale that is 
µP(e) = ηP(e) and inf µP = inf ηP. 
 
Now we define Smarandache equivalent of S-fuzzy subsemigroups. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.25: Let G be a S-semigroup. Two S-fuzzy subsemigroup η and µ of 
the S-semigroup G related to the same subgroup P, P ⊂ G are said to be 
Smarandache equivalent (S-equivalent) denoted by µ 
η
S≈
 if µ and η have the same 
chain  of  S-level  subgroups  in  P. Thus, we  have  contrary  of  groups  in  case  of 
S-semigroups several S-fuzzy subsemigroups and S-equivalences depending on the 
subgroups P ⊂ G. The S-relation 
S≈ can be proved to be a Smarandache equivalence 
relation (S-equivalence relation) on the set of S-fuzzy subsemigroups only related to 
the same subgroup P ⊂ G. Thus on G a S-semigroup we can have several S-relations 
which are S-equivalence relations depending on P, the proper subset of G which is a 
subgroup of G. Thus we can say the maximum number of S-relations will correspond 
to the number of proper subsets in G which are subgroups under the operations of G.  
 
All properties pertaining to fuzzy subgroups of a group can be extended to S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups of a S-semigroup G. 
 
We proceed on to define Smarandache penultimate subsemigroup of a S-semigroup 
G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.26: Let µ be a fuzzy set in G then the penultimate subset P (µ ) of µ in 
G, defined by P(µ) = {x ∈ G µ(x) > inf µ}. In case µ is a fuzzy subgroup of a group 

 
225
G then P (µ) is a subgroup of G provided µ is a non-constant and P (µ) is called the 
penultimate subgroup of µ in G.  
 
For more about penultimate subgroups please refer [11]. Now on similar lines we 
define  Smarandache  penultimate  subsemigroups  of  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup µ of a 
S-semigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.27: Let  G  be  a  S-semigroup. Let  µ  be  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup  of 
the  S-semigroup  G  related  to  a  proper subset  E  of  G,  E  a subgroup  of  G.  
P(µE)  =  {x ∈ E µE(x) > Im µE}. 
 
In case µE  is  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G (E ⊂ G) then P(µE) is a 
S-fuzzy subsemigroup of E provided µE is non-constant and P(µE) is called the  
Smarandache  penultimate  subsemigroup  (S- penultimate subsemigroup)  of µE  in  E  
⊂  G. 
 
It is to be noted by S-penultimate subsemigroup of a S-fuzzy subsemigroup may or 
may not be a proper subgroup of the group E (E ⊂ G a subgroup of the S-semigroup 
G). 
 
THEOREM 2.2.56: Let µE be a non-constant S-fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup 
G. Then the S-penultimate subsemigroup P(µE) is a proper subgroup of E ⊂ G if and 
only if µE attains its infimum.  
 
Proof: µ : G → [0, 1] is a fuzzy set of G; E a proper subset of G which is a subgroup 
under the operation of G. µE denotes the restriction map i.e. µE : E → [0 1] such that 
µE is fuzzy subgroup of G or µ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G related to E. Now the 
rest of the proof is as in case of fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.57:  Let  η1 , η2  and µ  be  fuzzy sets  in  a S-semigroup G  such  that  
η1 ≤ η2. Then µ o η1 ≤ µ o η2 and µ∗η1 ≤ µ∗η2 and µ y η1 ≤ µ y η2 on some fixed 
subgroup E of G. 
 
Proof: First G is a S-semigroup. E a proper subset of G, E a subgroup under the 
operations of G. η1, η2 and µ are fuzzy sets on G satisfying the conidion η1 ≤ η2 
restricted to the subgroup E ⊂ G. 
  
Now using the proof of [7, 10] the result follows: 
 
THEOREM 2.2.58: Let η and µ be S-fuzzy subsemigroups of a S-semigroup of G. Then 
the set product η o µ contains η and µ if and only if η and µ have the same S-tip that 
is η(eP) = µ(eP) for a subgroup P in G. 
 
Proof: As in case of groups. (Hint: Using P ⊂ G and P is a subgroup µ and η 
restricted to P serves the purpose). 
 
THEOREM 2.2.59: Let  η  and  µ  be  S-fuzzy subsemigroups  with  the  same  S-tip  of 
a S-semigroup G relative P (P ⊂ G a subgroup of G). Then  the  set product η o µ is a 

 
226
S-fuzzy subsemigroup generated by the union of η and µ if ηoµ is a S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: Direct hence left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.60: Let η and µ be S-fuzzy subsemigroups of a S-semigroup G. Then 
the S-penultimate product η o µ contains η and µ if η and µ are similarly bound with 
respect to the same subgroup P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof: Please refer [11] using the subgroup P of the S-semigroup G instead of using 
the whole of G. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.61: Let  η  and  µ  be  S-fuzzy subsemigroups in a S-semigroup G. 
Then η o µ = µ o η if either η or µ is a S-fuzzy ideal of the S-fuzzy subsemigroup. 
 
Proof: If the S-fuzzy subsemigroup µ related to P, P ⊂ G a subgroup of G then we see 
µ can also be fuzzy normal so that µ is a S-fuzzy ideal of the S-fuzzy subsemigroup. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.62: Let  η  and µ  be  S-fuzzy subsemigroups of  a  S-semigroup G. 
Then η y µ = µ  y η if either η or µ is S-fuzzy ideal of the S-fuzzy subsemigroup. 
 
Proof: Analogous to the proof in case of fuzzy subgroups as S-fuzzy subsemigroup µ 
of G is also a fuzzy subgroup of G.  
 
THEOREM 2.2.63: Let η and µ be S-fuzzy subsemigroups of a S-semigroup G. Then 
the set product µ oη is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup if and only if η o µ = µ o η. 
 
Proof: Straightforward, hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.2.64: Let η and µ be S-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G. Then the 
S-penultimate product η y µ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup if and only if η y µ = µ y η. 
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy subgroups by using the very definition. 
 
Example 2.2.4: Let S(4) be the S-symmetric semigroup. Let µ and η be S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups of S(4) relative to the proper subset S4 of S(4) which is a subgroup.

η ∗ µ is a fuzzy subgroup of P. The rest of the proof follows as in case of groups. 
 
We just recall the notion of Smarandache normal subgroup of a S-semigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.2.28: Let  S  be  a  S-semigroup. Let  A  be  a  proper  subset  of  S 
which  is  a  group  under  the  operations  of  S. We  say  A  is  a  Smarandache  
normal subgroup (S- normal subgroup) of  the  S-semigroup S if xA ⊂ A and Ax ⊆ A 
or xA = {0} and Ax = {0}  for  all  x ∈  S  and  if  0  is  an  element  in  S  then  we 
have  xA = {0} and Ax = {0} . 
 
Let S be a S-semigroup µ : S → [0, 1] be a S-fuzzy semigroup of S relative to P,         
P ⊂  S; P a subgroup under the operations of S. i.e. µP : P → [0, 1] is a fuzzy group 
i.e. µP is nothing but µ restricted to P. If in addition we have µ (gx) = µ (xg) for every 
g ∈ P and x ∈ S then we call µ a Smarandache fuzzy normal subgroup (S-fuzzy 
normal subgroup) of the S-semigroup S. 
 
 
2.3 Element-wise properties of S-fuzzy subsemigroups 
 
In this section we define several of the element-wise properties in S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups.  
 
DEFINITION 2.3.1: Let G be a S-semigroup. A fuzzy subset λ of G of the form

For y in P ⊂ G, P a subgroup in G is called the Smarandache fuzzy point  (S-fuzzy 
point) with Smarandache support (S-support) x and value t is denoted by xt. 
 
It is very important to note that all elements in the S-semigroup G need not in general 
have S-fuzzy point. That is to be more precise only those elements in G which fall into 
one or more subgroups of G will have S-fuzzy point that too depending on the fuzzy 
subset λ of G. Thus  unlike  in  a  group  G  we  will  not  be  in  a  position  to 
associate S-fuzzy points. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.2: A fuzzy subset λ of a S-semigroup G is said to have Smarandache 
sup property (S-sup property) if for every non empty subset T of G where T is a 
subgroup and there exists a ∈ T such that λ(a) = sup {λ(t) t ∈ T}.

DEFINITION 2.3.3: A fuzzy subset λ of a S-semigroup G is said to be an Smarandache 
(∈, ∈∨ q)  fuzzy  subsemigroup  (S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy subsemigroup)  of  G  if  for  any 
x, y ∈ P ⊂ G (P a subgroup of G) and t, r ∈ (0, 1]  
 
i. 
xt, yt ∈ λ ⇒ (xy)M (t ,r) ∈∨ qλ  and 
ii. 
xt ∈ λ ⇒ (x–1)t ∈∨ qλ. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.4: A S-fuzzy subsemigroup λ of G is said to be  
 
i. 
Smarandache (∈,∈) fuzzy normal (S-(∈,∈) fuzzy normal) if for all x, y ∈ P 
⊂ G and t ∈ (0,1], xt ∈ λ ⇒ (x–1y x)t ∈ λ.

Smarandache (∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy normal (S-(∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy normal) (or simply  
S-fuzzy normal )   if  for  any  x, y ∈ P ⊂ G and  t  ∈  (0, 1],  xt  ∈  λ  ⇒  
(y–1x y)t ∈∨ qλ.  
 
Several relations and results in this direction can be evolved using Smarandache fuzzy 
notions. 
 
 
THEOREM 2.3.1:  
 
i. 
A fuzzy subset λ of a S-semigroup G is an S- (∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy subsemigroup 
(respectively S- (∈,∈∨ q)fuzzy normal subgroup) related to a subgroup P 
of G if and only if the (∈∨ q)- level subset λ q  of P ⊂ G is a subgroup of P 
(normal subgroup of P) for all t ∈ (0, 1] where λq = { x ∈ Pλ (x) ≥ t or 
λ(x) + t > 1}. 
 
ii. 
Let f : G → H be  a S-semigroup homomorphism. Let λ and µ be S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups of G and H respectively. Then f (λ) and f –1 (µ) are S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups of f (P) and P respectively (P ⊂ G is a subgroup of G). 
 
Proof: Refer [25]. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.2: For  any  S-(∈, ∈∨ q)  fuzzy  subsemigroup λ of S-semigroup G the 
S-(∈∨ q)-level subgroup λq = P (P ⊂ G, P a subgroup of G) for all t ∈ I if and only if 
λ(x) ≥ 0.5 for all x ∈ P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof: Straightforward. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.3: Let G be a S-semigroup. Then given any chain of subgroups P0 ⊂ P1 
⊂ …⊂ Pr = P (P a subgroup of G) there exists a S- (∈,∈∨ q)- fuzzy subsemigroup of 
P ⊂ G whose S- (∈∨ q)-level subgroups are precisely the members of the chain. 
 
Proof: Let {ti ti ∈ (0, 0.5); i = 1, 2, …, r} be such that t1 > t2 >…>tr. Let λ : P → I 
be defined as follows.

It is important to mention here that for a given S-semigroup G we can have several 
subgroups P, Q, R,…, X, Y, Z such that we have a chain of subgroups associated with 
each of the subgroups P, Q, R,…, X, Y, Z leading to many S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy subgroup 
P, Q, R,…, X, Y, Z of G. 
 
Thus only the Smarandache notion alone can give a nice spectrum of S-(∈,∈∨q) 
fuzzy subsemigroups relative to a S-semigroup G having several distinct proper 
subsets which are subgroups of G.

Then λ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of P. Note that λ0.25 = 4P = λ0.6 = λ0.7, λ0.9 = 2P = 
λ0.2, λ0.1 = P. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.4: Let λ be a S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy subgroup of G with Im µ = {t, r} where 
0 < t < r < 0.5. If λ = µ ∪ ν where µ, ν are S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy subsemigroups of G then 
either µ ≤ ν, or ν ≤ µ.  
 
Proof:  Follows as in case of (∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy subgroup. We say S-(∈, ∈∨q)-fuzzy 
subgroup of a S-semigroup G is said to be proper if it is not constant in G.

THEOREM 2.3.5: Let G be a S-semigroup that has several proper subgroup. A proper 
S-(∈,∈) fuzzy subsemigroup λ of G such that card. Im λ ≥ 3 can be expressed as the 
union of two proper non-equivalence S-(∈,∈)- fuzzy subsemigroups of G. 
 
Proof: As in case of (∈,∈)-fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.6: Let λ be a proper S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy subgroup of G such that the 
cardinality of {λ(x) λ(x) < 0.5 } ≥ 2. Then λ can be expressed as the union of two 
proper non-(∈∨q)-equivalent  S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy  subgroups of G. 
 
Proof: Follows by the same arguments as in case of fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.7: Let λ be an S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G 
such that λ(x) ≥ 0.5 for all x ∈ G. Then λ can be expressed as the union of two non-
(∈∨ q) equivalent S- (∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy subsemigroups if and only if P = H ∪ K, where 
H and K are proper S- (∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy subsemigroups of P (where P is a proper subset 
of G which is a subgroup of G). 
 
Proof: For proof please refer [23]. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.5: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a S-semigroup G. An S- (∈,∈∨q) fuzzy 
subsemigroup ξ of G is said to be the S-(∈, ∈∨q)-fuzzy subsemigroup generated by µ 
in G if ξ ≥ µ and for any other S- (∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy subsemigroup η of G with η ≥ µ it 
must be η ≥ ξ . 
 
THEOREM 2.3.8: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of the S-semigroup G where card Im µ is 
finite. Define S-subsemigroups Gi of G as follows.

THEOREM 2.3.9: Let  f : G → K  be  a  S-semigroup homomorphism. If  λ  and  µ  are 
S-fuzzy subsemigroups of G and K respectively, then f (λ) and f –1 (µ) are S-fuzzy 
subsemigroups of K and G respectively.

THEOREM 2.3.10: Let f : G → H be a S-semigroup homomorphism. Let λ and µ be 
two S-fuzzy subsemigroups of G and H respectively. Then 
 
i. 
f –1(µ) is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. 
ii. 
f(λ) is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of f(G). 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the earlier result and definitions. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache (∈,∈)-fuzzy left (resp. right) cosets.

H = {e, a, b, c, d, f} is a subgroup of G. Define λ : G → [0, 1] by λ, (e a b c d f) = 
λ(0.7, 0.75, 0.8. 0.4, 0.4, 0.4). λ(0) = 0 and λ(g) = 0. Thus λ is an S- (∈,∈∨q)- fuzzy 
normal subgroup of G. But since λ(fd) = λ(b) = 0.8 ≠ 0.75 = λ(df) = λ (a). λ is not S- 
(∈,∈) fuzzy normal.

DEFINITION 2.3.7: A S-subsemigroup H of a S-semigroup G is said to be 
Smarandache quasi normal (S-quasi normal) if for every S-subsemigroup K of H, we 
have X Y = Y X, X ⊂ H and Y ⊂ K are subgroups of X and Y respectively.

S-quasi normal. 
 
Proof: Follows by very definitions. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.13: A maximal S-quasi normal subgroup of a S-semigroup G is

Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.14: Let G be a finite S-semigroup and Q be a S-quasi normal subgroup

DEFINITION 2.3.9: A S-fuzzy subsemigroup µ of a S-semigroup G is said to be

Clearly µSp is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup called the Smarandache p-fuzzy sylow

THEOREM 2.3.15: Let ξ be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G with S-sup 
property. Then each level subset  µt,  for  t ∈  (0,  ξ(e))  is a S-quasi normal subgroup 
of P ⊂ G (ξ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup related to P ⊂ G) if and only if ξ is S-fuzzy 
quasi normal (I). 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.11: A S-fuzzy semigroup of a S-semigroup G is called a S-fuzzy quasi 
normal II if its S-level subsemigroups are S-quasi normal subsemigroups of G. 
 
Now a characterization theorem for this ξ to be S-fuzzy quasi normal II is given by 
the following Theorem; the proof of which is left for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.16: Let ξ be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G, G a S-semigroup. Then ξ  is 
S-fuzzy  quasi  normal  II  if and only if  ξ o η = η o ξ  (restricted  to  some  subgroup  
P ⊂ G relative to which ξ is defined) for any S-subsemigroup η of G. 
 
From now onwards G will denote a S-semigroup; P a subgroup of G (P ⊂ G) under 
the operations of G. Let eP be the identity element of P and λP an S-(∈,∈∨ q)- fuzzy 
subsemigroup of G. By a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G we shall mean a S-(∈,∈∨ q)- 
fuzzy subsemigroup of G. For a fuzzy subgroup λ of G there exists x and y ∈ G such 
that λ(x) ≥ 0.5 and λ(y) < 0.5. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.12: 
 

 
236
i. 
λ is said to be a S-(∈,∈)-fuzzy quasi normal if for any S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup µ of G and for all z ∈ P ⊂ G, t ∈ (0,1], zt ∈ (λ o µ) if and 
only if zt ∈ (µ o λ). 
 
ii. 
λ is said to be a S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy quasi normal if for any S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup µ of G and for all z ∈ P ⊂ G, t ∈ (0,1], zt ∈ (λ o µ) implies 
zt ∈∨q (µ  o λ) and zt ∈ (µ o λ) implies zt ∈∨q (λ  o µ). 
 
THEOREM 2.3.17: λ is S-(∈,∈) fuzzy quasi normal if and only if for any S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup µ of G and for all z ∈ P ⊂ G, (λ o µ) z = (µ o λ)z. 
 
Proof: By way of contradiction if (λ o µ)(z) ≠ (µ o λ)(z) for some z ∈ P ⊆ G and we 
arrive at a contradiction. 
 
Remark: Let  λ  be  an  S-(∈,∈)  fuzzy  subsemigroup  of  a  S-semigroup G. If λ is a 
S-(∈,∈)-fuzzy quasi normal then λ is a S-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of type I 
or II. 
 
As an S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy subsemigroup is different from the S-fuzzy semigroup it 
follows that an S-(∈,∈) fuzzy quasi normal for an S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy subsemigroup is 
different from a S-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of type I or II. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.18: λ is S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal if and only if for any S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup µ of G relative to a subgroup P ⊂ G and for all z ∈ P,  (µ  o λ)(z)  =  
(λ o µ)(z)  if  (λ o µ)(z) < 0.5 and (µ o λ)(z) ≥ 0.5 if (λ o µ)(z) ≥ 0.5. 
 
Proof: Let λ be S-(∈, ∈∨q) fuzzy quasi normal. Let z ∈ P ⊂ G. 
 
Case 1 (i): Let (λ o µ)(z) < 0.5. If  possible  let  (µ o λ) (z) ≠ (λ o µ) (z). Suppose (i) 
(µ o λ)(z) = t < (λ o µ) (z) = r. Then zr ∈ (λ o µ) but zr ∈∨q (µ o λ) a contradiction. 
 
Case 1 (ii) : Let r < t. Then there exists δ > 0 such that r + δ < t and r + δ + t ≤ 1. 
Now zr+δ ∈ (µ o λ) but zr+δ

 (λ o µ) a contradiction. So (λ o µ)(z) = (µ o λ)(z) 
for all z ∈ P ⊂ G.

z0.5

 (µ o λ) a contradiction. So (µ o λ)(z) > 0.5. The converse part follows

THEOREM 2.3.19: If µ is a S-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup (type I or II) of P ⊂ G, 
then λ is an S- (∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: Straightforward as in case of subgroups. The following theorems are stated and 
the proof is left as an exercise for the reader. 
 

 
237
THEOREM 2.3.20: Let H be any non-empty subset of the S-semigroup G.H is a S-quasi 
normal  subgroup  of  G  if  and  only  if  χH  ( the  characteristic  function  of  H) is 
an  S-(∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy quasi normal subgroup of G.  
 
THEOREM 2.3.21: Let λ be a  S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of G, G a 
S-semigroup with the sup property. Then  (∈∨ q)-level subset  λt = {x ∈ P | xt ∈∨ qλ} 
is a S-quasi normal subsemigroup G relative to P ⊂ G ( P  a  subgroup  of  G)  for  all 
t ∈ (0, 1]. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.22: Let λ be a fuzzy subset of the S-semigroup G with “sup-property” 
and for all t ∈ (0, 1], S-(∈∨ q)-level subset λt be a S-quasi normal subsemigroup of 
G. 
 
Proof: λ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G relative to a proper subset P ⊂ G; P a 
subgroup of G. Let µ be any S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G and z ∈ P. Then zt ∈ (λ o µ) 
implies z ∈ (λ o µ)t implies z ∈ λt y µt implies z ∈ µt y λt. (Since λt is S-quasi normal) 
implies z ∈ (µ o λ)t implies zt ∈∨q (µ o λ). Similarly zt ∈(µ o λ) ⇒ zt ∈∨q (λ o µ). 
Therefore λ is S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.23:  Let  G  be  a  S-semigroup   such  that  for  all  x,  y,  υ,  ν  ∈  G, 
xy y υν  = xυ y  yν. If λ µ are S-(∈, ∈∨q) fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroups of G 
then so also is λ o µ.. 
 
Proof: Refer [25] and obtain the proof analogous for S-semigroup G with suitable 
modifications. 
 
Remark: Let G be a S-semigroup such that for all x, y, υ,ν ∈ P (P a subgroup of G), 
xy y υν = xυ y yν and Q(P) is the set of all S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi-normal 
subsemigroup of P then (Q(P), y) is a commutative semigroup. 
 
Thus for a single S-semigroup G we have several commutative semigroups associated 
with them in fact depending on the number of nontrivial subsets P of G which are 
subgroups of G. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.24: Let   H   be   a  S-semigroup.  G  a  S-semigroup, suppose  f  is  a  
S-semigroup homomorphism from G onto H (i.e. f : P ⊂ G → L ⊂ H i.e. P and L are 
subgroups of G and H respectively and f is a onto group homomorphism i.e. 
equivalently f is a S-semigroup homomorphism); then  
 
i. f (λ o θ ) = f(λ) o f(θ ) where λ and θ  are S-fuzzy subsemigroups of P ⊂ G. 
ii. f (f –1(θ ) = θ  where θ  is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of f(P). 
 
Proof: Direct as in case of fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.25: Let f : G → H (H a S-semigroup), be a S-semigroup 
homomorphism). If λ is a S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy quasi normal subgroup of P ⊂ G then f (λ) 
is an S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy quasi normal subgroup of f (P). (P ⊂  G  is a subgroup of the 
S-semigroup G). 

 
238
 
Proof: As in case of (∈,∈∨q) fuzzy normal subgroups of G. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.26: Let f : G → H be a S-semigroup homomorphism and µ be a                
S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of G with sup property. Then f –1(µ) is 
an  S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of G. 
 
Proof:  Refer  [25]  and  obtain  an  analogous  proof  by  studying  the  subgroup  P  
in the S-semigroup G. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.27: S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy normality implies S (∈,∈∨q) fuzzy quasi 
normality. 
 
Proof: Direct as in case of groups. 
 
It is important to note that S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy quasi normality need not imply S-
(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy normality in case of S-semigroups also. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.13: Let  λ  be  a  S-fuzzy  subsemigroup  of  a  S-semigroup  G.  For   
any  g ∈  P  ⊂  G  let  S(λg) : P  ⊂  G  →  I   defined  by  S(λg(x)) = λ(g–1xg)  for  all

This definition is true and can be defined for every proper subset P in G, P a 
subgroup   of G. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.28: Let λ be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G. Then

For all g ∈ P ⊂ G, λg is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G.

λ is a S- (∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy normal  if  and  only  if  λg (x) ≥  M (λ(x), 0.5)  for  
all  x ∈ P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof:  
 
i. 
For any x, y ∈ P ⊂ G, λg (xy)  =  λ(g–1xyg)  =  λ(g–1xygg–1 yg  ≥  M(λ (g–
1xg),      λ–1(g–1yg), 0.5) = M (λg(x), λg(y), 0.5). Again λg(x–1)  =  λ (g–1x–1g) = 
λ(g–1xg)–1 ≥  M (λ(g–1xg), 0.5))  =  M (λg(x), 0.5). So λg is a S-fuzzy 
subsemigroup relative the subgroup P ⊂ G. 
 
ii. 
Follows directly by the very definition.

THEOREM 2.3.30: λg is an S- (∈,∈∨q) fuzzy normal subgroup of G.

Proof: As in case of groups. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.19: µp  is  called  a  Smarandache (∈,∈∨q) fuzzy p-sylow subgroup 
(S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy p-sylow subgroup) of λ. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.33: If µp  is  a  S-(∈,∈∨ q)  fuzzy p-sylow subgroup of  λ  then (µp)t = 
λt ∩ Sp for all t ∈ (0, 1]. 
 
Proof: Analogous to group. Refer [24]. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.34: Let λ be an S- (∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of a 
finite S-semigroup G. If λ is S-core-free then every S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy p-sylow subgroup 
of λ is S-(∈,∈∨q) fuzzy quasi normal. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.20: Let λ be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G. λ is said to 
be a S-(∈, ∈) fuzzy maximal. [respectively S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy maximal] if λ is not 
constant  for  any  other  S-fuzzy subsemigroup  µ  of  P ⊂ G, whenever λ ≤ µ either 
[∈ - λ0.5] = [∈ - µ0.5] or µ = χG [resp. either [(∈∨q) - λ0.5] = [(∈∨ q) - µ0.5] or µ = 
χG] where [∈ - λt] denotes the level subset or denotes [(∈∨ q)-level subset].  
 
It is important to mention here following the definition of [32] it is a [∈ - λt]-level 
subset and [(∈∨ q) - λt ] denotes (∈∨ q)-level subset following definition of [24],      
(∈∨ q)-level subset]. 
 
It is left for the reader to verify  [(∈∨q) - λ]  =  [∈-λt]  and  [(∈∨q)- λ0.5] = [∈-λ0.5] for 
all t ∈ (0,0.5). 
 
THEOREM 2.3.35: Let  λ  be  a  S-fuzzy subsemigroup  of  a  S-semigroup G.  If  λ  is 
S-(∈, ∈)-fuzzy maximal then λ (x) ≥ 0.5 for all x ∈ P ⊂ G ( P subgroup of G). 
 
Proof: If possible let there exist a ∈ P ⊂ G such that λ (a) < 0.5. Define µ : P ⊂ G → I

Then clearly µ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G such that λ < µ but [∈ - λ0.5] ≠ [∈ -

Therefore λ(x) ≥ 0.5 for all x ∈ P ⊆ G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.21: A S-fuzzy subsemigroup λ of a S-semigroup G is said to be

THEOREM 2.3.37: If λ is a S-q fuzzy maximal subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G 
such that λ(x) < 0.5 for some x ∈ P ⊂ G, then Im λ = 2. 
 
Proof:  Let  λ  be  a  S-q-fuzzy maximal subsemigroup  of  the  S-semigroup G;  let 
Im λ > 2. Let t, r, λ(e) ∈ Im λ and t ≠ r ≠ λ (e). If r < 0.5 then define a fuzzy subset µ 
of P ⊂ G as follows:

Then µ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G and µ ≥ λ. Clearly

and µ ≠ χG which 
contradicts that λ is q-fuzzy maximal. 
 
Hence r ≥ 0.5. Similarly t > 0.5. Again t ,  r  ≥  0.5  implies  that  λ (x)  ≥  0.5  for  all 
x ∈ P ⊂ G which is a contradiction. Moreover Im λ = 1 only when λ is constant. 
Therefore Im λ = 2. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.38: If λ is a q-fuzzy maximal or S-(∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy maximal subsemi-
group of P ⊂ G. Then 
λ
P and λ0.5 are maximal subgroups of P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.39: Let λ be a S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of P ⊂ G 
with sup property. If λ is q-fuzzy maximal or S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy maximal, then λ is S- 
(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy normal. 
 
Proof: Refer [25] for analogous proof. 
 
Now we define the concept of Smarandache primary fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-
semigroup G. We for the sake of completeness recall some of the definitions. 
 
DEFINITION [14]: Let A be a fuzzy subset of a group G. Then A is called a fuzzy 
subgroup of G under a t-norm T (T-fuzzy subgroup) if and only if for all x, y ∈ G. 
 

 
242
i. 
A(xy) ≥ T (A(x), A(y)). 
ii. 
A(e) = 1 where e is the identity of G. 
iii. 
A(x) = A(x–1). 
 
A is called a Min-fuzzy subgroup if A satisfies conditions (i) and (iii) only by 
replacing T with Min Let A be a fuzzy subset of the group G. Then the subset               
{x ∈ G A(x) ≥  t }, t ∈ [0, 1]  of  G is called a t-level subset of G under A and 
denoted by At. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.22: Let A be a fuzzy subset of the S-semigroup G. Then A is called a 
Smarandache fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G under a t-norm T (S-T-fuzzy 
subsemigroup) if and only if for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ G. 
 
i. 
A (xy) ≥ T (A(x), A(y)). 
ii. 
A(e) = 1 where e is the identity element of P. 
iii. 
A(x) = A(x–1) for all x ∈ P. 
 
A is called a S-Min-fuzzy subsemigroup if A satisfies conditions (i) and (ii) only by 
replacing T by Min. 
 
Let A be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G is called a t-level subset of P ⊂ G under A 
and is denoted by S(At). 
 
THEOREM 2.3.40: Let A be a S-min fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G. Then 
every S-t-level subset S(At) of P ⊂ G, t ∈ [0, A(e)] is a S-subsemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: As in case of subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.41: Let A be a S-fuzzy subset of S-subsemigroup G such that every        
t-level subset S(At) of P ⊂ G, t ∈ Im (A) and A(e)= 1. Then A is a S-Min-fuzzy 
subsemigroup of P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof: Similar to results in groups. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.42: Let f : G → H be a S-semigroup homomorphism and A be a S-T-
fuzzy subsemigroup of G. Then f(A) is a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of H. 
 
Proof: As in case of groups, hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.23: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup P ⊂ G, xA 
(Ax) be left (right) fuzzy coset of A in P ⊂ G such that  xA(g) =  A(x–1 g) A(xg)  = 
A(gx–1)), g ∈ P ⊂ G. Then  A  is  said  to  be  a  Smarandache  normal  fuzzy  
subsemigroup  (S-normal fuzzy subsemigroup)  of  G  if  and  only  if  xA = Ax for all 
x ∈ P ⊂ G and hence P/A = {x A x ∈ P} is a group (if A is normal) with the 
operation xAyA = xyA, x, y ∈ P ⊂ G. 
 
Notation: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of G, x ∈ P ⊂ G r, n, ∈ N, r > n, such 
that A(xr) = A(xn) = 1. Since r > n1 then there exists q1, q2 ∈ N such that r = q1 n1 + n2, 
0 ≤ n2 < n1. Therefore, we have two cases either n2 = 0 or n2 ≠ 0. If n2 = 0 then n1 | r

since n2 < n1, then there exists q2, n3 ∈ N such that n1 = q2 n2 + n3, 0 ≤ n3 < n2. Also 
here we have two cases either n3 = 0 or n3 ≠ 0. If n3 = 0 we get n2 | r and (n2, r) = n2. If 
n3 ≠ 0, we get

The following theorem is evident from the above definition. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.43:  Let  A  be  a  S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup  of  the  S-semigroup  G;      
x ∈ P ⊂ G, r, n1 ∈ N, r > n such that A(xr) = A (xn) = 1. Then there exists d ∈ N such 
that A(xd) = 1 where d = (r, n). 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.24: Let  A be  a  T - fuzzy subsemigroup  of  a  S-semigroup of G and 
x ∈ P ⊂ G. Then the least positive integer n satisfying the condition A(xn) = 1 is 
called the fuzzy order of x with respect to A and we use the notation A o (x) = n. If n 
does not exist we say x is of infinite fuzzy order with respect to A and write A o (x)=∞. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.44: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup  of  P ⊂  G,    
x ∈ P ⊂ G. Then 
 
i. If A(xr) = 1 then A o (x) r 
ii. If A o (x) < ∞ then A o (x)O(x). 
 
(Here A o(x) = O(x) iff A1 = {e} such that x ∈ P ⊂ G and O(x) is the order x). 
 
Proof: As in case of T-fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.45: Let  A  be  a  S-T-fuzzy subgroup  of  P  ⊂  G, G a S-semigroup and 
x ∈ P ⊂ G such that A o (x) < ∞. Then A o (x) = A o (x–1). 
 
Proof: Let A o (x)  =  n and A o (x –1)  =  m. Then  A((x –1)n)  =  A((xn)–1)  = A(x) = 1.  
From the above theorem we get m / n. On the other hand,   A(x m) = A((x m)–1) = 
A((x–1) m) = 1 and hence n / m. Therefore n = m. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.46: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup an S-commutative semigroup 
G. Then the set of all elements in P⊂ G (P a proper subset of G which is an abelian 
group of G) whose fuzzy order with respect to A are finite is a subgroup of P. 
 
Proof: Direct as in case of T-fuzzy subgroup of an abelian group. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.25: Let A be a S-T fuzzy subsemigroup of an S abelian semigroup G. 
Then the subgroup of all elements of P in G whose fuzzy orders with respect to A are 
finite is called the torsion part of P with respect to  A and is denoted by AP. 
 

 
244
THEOREM 2.3.47: If A is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G, G a S-semigroup such that for 
x ∈ P, A o (x) < ∞, n ∈ N then A o (xn) = [A o (x)]  [(n, A o (x))]. 
 
Proof: As in case of crisp case. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.48: Let  A be a S-T fuzzy subsemigroup of G and x ∈ P ⊆  G such that 
A o (x) = n1 n2 … nr , ni ∈ N, i = 1, 2,…, nr , (ni , nj ) = 1 if i ≠  j . Then there exists x1 , 
x2 ,…, xr ∈ P such that A o (xi ) = ni  for every i = 1, 2,…, r  ; x = x1 x2… xr , xi xj = xj xi 
for all i, j. 
 
Proof: Let qi = Π{nj; i ≠ j }> 1 since the greatest common divisor of q1,  q2, …, qr is 1 
then there exists ai ∈ Z such that a1q1 + a2q2 +…+ arqr = 1. Let bi = ( )

THEOREM 2.3.49: Let f :  G → H be a S-homomorphism of S-semigroups and A be a 
S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of G, x ∈ P ⊂ G. Then f(A)of(x)) | A o (x) . 
 
Proof: Let Ao(x) = n and (f(A)) o (f(x)) = m. Then (f(A)((f(x))n)) = f(A)(f(xn)) =

the result. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.26: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G, G a S-semigroup. 
Then the least common multiple of the fuzzy order of the elements of P in G with 
respect to A is called the Smarandache order (S-order) of the S-fuzzy subsemigroup A 
and is denoted by 
F
SA
. If it does not exists 
F
SA
 = ∞.

Proof: Straightforward; to prove 
F
SA
P , the reader is requested to construct an 
example for 
G
SA F
 by considering symmetric semigroups S(n). 
 
Thus in general analogous of Lagranges theorem in case of S-fuzzy subsemigroups is 
not always possible. 
 
Recall: Let A be a T fuzzy subgroup of G, p a prime. Then A is called primary fuzzy 
subgroup of G if for every x in G there exists a natural number r such that A o (x) = 
pr. Now we proceed on to define S-primary fuzzy subsemigroups of a S-semigroup G. 

 
245
 
DEFINITION 2.3.27: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G, G a S-semigroup 
and p a prime. Then A is called Smarandache primary fuzzy subsemigroup (S-primary 
fuzzy subsemigroup) of P ⊂ G if for every x ∈ P there exists a natural number r such 
that Ao(x) = pr. 
 
Clearly every S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G is S-primary if and only if there exists 
n ∈ N such that 
n
F

=
, p a prime. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.51: If A is a fuzzy subset of a S-semigroup G and every At, t ∈ Im (A) is 
a S-primary subsemigroup of P ⊂ G then A is a S-primary Min fuzzy subsemigroup of 
P ⊂ G. 
 
Proof: Let x ∈ P ⊂ G such that A(x) = t, t ∈ Im (A). Then x ∈ At and hence there 
exists m ∈ Z such that O(x) = pm where p is a prime. Since A o (x) O(x) there exists 
0 ≤ s  ≤ m  such that Ao(x) = ps i.e. A(
)
s
p
x
 = 1.  
 
Therefore A is a S-primary fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.52: Every  S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup  of  a  S-primary semigroup is also 
S-primary. 
 
Proof: Direct from the earlier theorem and the fact if the semigroup G is S-primary 
then every proper subset P ⊂ G where P is a subgroup and is S-primary. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.53: Let A be a S-primary Min- fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup 
G. Then every t-level subset At, t ∈ Im (A), of G is S-primary if Aα = {e} where α  = 
A(e), e is the identity element of P ⊂ G relative to which A is defined . 
 
Proof: Let x ∈ P ⊂ G, A(x) = t, A o (x) = Pr, where p is prime r ∈ N. Since AA(e) = 
{e}, then O(x) = A o (x) = pr. Hence A t is S-primary. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.54: If A is a S-normal T-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-primary semigroup 
G then P/ A is a S-primary semigroup (A is defined relative to P ⊂ G). 
 
Proof: As in case of T-fuzzy subgroup of a primary group G. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.55:   Let  f : G  →  H  be  a  S-semigroup homomorphism  and  A  be  
S-primary T-fuzzy sub semigroup of P ⊂ G  and  AA(e)  = {e}. Then f(A) is S-primary 
T-fuzzy subsemigroup of T ⊂ P. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.56: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-cyclic primary 
semigroup G such that A1 = {e} for x, y ∈ P ⊂ G Then 
 
i. 
If Ao(x) = Ao(y) then A(x) = A(y). 
ii. 
If Ao(x) > Ao(y) then A (y) > A(x). 

 
246
 
Proof: Since A1 = {e}. Therefore Ao(x) = O(x) and hence the proof follows by earlier 
results. 
 
THEOREM 2.3.57: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subgroup of an S-abelian semigroup G. Then 
the set of all elements whose fuzzy order is a power of a prime p is a subgroup of       
P ⊂ G.

DEFINITION 2.3.28: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of G. A is said to be 
Smarandache abelian (S-abelian)  if  for  all  a, b  ∈ P ⊂  G, A(a) > 0, A(b) > 0 
implies ab = ba. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.29: A a S-Min-fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G is called the 
Smarandache p-sylow fuzzy subgroup (S-p-Sylow fuzzy subgroup) of G if it has the 
following properties: 
 
i. Card (ImA) ≤ 2. 
ii. AA(e) is a sylow p-subgroup of P (P ⊂ G). 
 
THEOREM 2.3.58: If A is a S-p-sylow normal Min fuzzy subsemigroup of G then A is 
not a S-primary fuzzy subgroup of P ⊂ G with order as a power of p. 
 
Proof: A matter of routine as in case of subgroups. 
 
Now we proceed on to define a Smarandache p-component of a S-semigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.3.30: If A is a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G then the set of all 
elements in P ⊂ G of a fuzzy order as a power of a prime p with respect to A is called 
Smarandache p-component (S-p-compotent) of P ⊂ G with respect to A and it is 
denoted by PP(A). 
 
THEOREM 2.3.59: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy subsemigroup of P ⊂ G, G a S-semigroup. 
Then TA is the sum of PP(A), p ∈ V where V is the set of all prime and it is a direct sum 
if A1 = {e}. 
 
Proof: Refer [17] and prove it as in case of S-semigroups.  
 
In the following section we define Smarandache fuzzy bisemigroup. 
 
 
2.4 Smarandache fuzzy bisemigroups 
 

 
247
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache fuzzy bisemigroups. The 
study of Smarandache bisemigroups and Smarandache bigroups is very recent [135]. 
Several interesting properties of these concepts are studied in this section. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.1: Let (G, y, ∗) be a non empty set such that  G = G1 ∪ G2 where G1 
and G2 are proper subsets of G, (G, y, ∗) is called a Smarandache bigroup                 
(S-bigroup) if the following conditions are true: 
 
i. 
(G, y) is a group. 
ii. 
(G,∗) is a S-semigroup. 
 
Now we have got several results about them which we just recall without proof. 
 
THEOREM [135]: Let G be a S-bigroup then G need not be a bigroup. 
 
Proof: Construct an example to prove. 
 
THEOREM [135]: If G = G1 ∪ G2 is a S-bigroup then G contains a bigroup. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to refer [135]. 
 
DEFINITION [135]: Let G = G1 ∪ G2 be a S-bigroup, we say G is a Smarandache 
commutative bigroup (S-commutative bigroup) if G1 is a commutative group and 
every proper subset S of G2 which is a group is a commutative group. If both G1 and 
G2 happens to be commutative trivially G becomes a S-commutative bigroup. 
 
We say G is S-weakly commutative if the S-semigroup G2 has atleast one proper 
subset which is commutative.  
 
The following theorem is straight forward and hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM [135]: Let G = G1 ∪ G2 be a S-commutative bigroup then G is a S-weakly 
commutative bigroup and not conversely. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.2: Let G = G1 ∪ G2 be a S-bigroup. We say G is a Smarandache 
cyclic bigroup (S-cyclic bigroup) if G1 is a cyclic group and G2 is a S-cyclic 
semigroup. We call G a S-weakly cyclic bigroup if every subgroups of G1 is cyclic and 
G2 is a S-weakly cyclic bigroup. 
 
The following theorem is straight forward hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.1: Let G = G1 ∪ G2 be a S-cyclic bigroup then G is a S-weakly cyclic 
bigroup.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache hyper bigroup. 
 

 
248
DEFINITION 2.4.3: Let G = G1 ∪ G2 be a S-bigroup. If A be a proper subset of G2 
which  is  the  largest  group  contained  in  G2  and  G1  has  no  subgroups,  then  we 
call P = G1 ∪ A the Smarandache hyper bigroup (S-hyper bigroup). We say G is 
Smarandache simple bigroup (S-simple bigroup) if G has no S-hyper bigroup. 
 
We define Smarandache double cosets in bigroups. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.4:  Let  G  =  G1  ∪  G2  be  a  S-bigroup.  Let  A  =  A1  ∪  A2   and  
B = B1 ∪  B2  be  any  S-sub-bigroups of G. We  define  the  Smarandache double 
coset  (S-double coset)  as AxB  =  {A1 x1 B1 ∪ A2 x2 B2   A1 x1 B1   provided  x  =  x1  
∈  G1  if  x ≠ x1 ∉ G1 then we just take A1B1 if x = x2 ∈ G2 then take A2x2B2  otherwise 
take A2B2  for every x ∈ G} : AxB = {A1 B1 ∪ A2 xB2  if x ∈ G2 }  or = {A1 x B1  ∪  A2 
B2  if x ∈ G1} or = {A1 x B1 ∪ A2 x B2  if  x ∈ G1 ∪ G2 }. 
 
We just recall the definition of Smarandache normal bigroup.  
 
DEFINITION 2.4.5: Let G = G1 ∪  G2  be a S-bigroup we call a S-sub-bigroup A  of  G 
to  be  a  Smarandache normal sub-bigroup  (S-normal sub-bigroup)  of  G  where  A  
= A1 ∪ A2 if xA1 ⊂ A1 and A1x ⊂ A1 if x ∈ G1 and xA2 ⊂ A2 and A2 x ⊂ A2 or xA2 = {0} 
or Ax2 = {0} if 0 is an element in G2 and x ∈ G2 for all x ∈ G1 ∪ G2. We say G is 
Smarandache pseudo simple bigroup (S-pseudo simple bigroup) if G has no S-normal 
sub-bigroup. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache maximal S-bigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.6:  Let  G  = G1  ∪  G2  be  a  S-bigroup. We  say  a  proper  subset  
A = A1 ∪ A2 to be Smarandache maximal S-bigroup  (S-maximal S-bigroup)  of  G  if 
A1 is the largest normal subgroup in G1 and A2 is the largest proper subset of G2 
which is the subgroup of G2. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy bigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.7: Let  (G  =  G1 ∪ G2 , +, y)  be  a  S-bigroup. Then µ : G → [0, 1] 
is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy sub-bigroup (S-fuzzy sub-bigroup) of G if there 
exists two fuzzy subsets µ1 (of G1) and µ2 (of G2) such that 
 
i. (µ1 , +) is a fuzzy subgroup of (G1 ,+) 
ii. (µ2 , y ) is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of (G2 , y) and 
iii. µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
We illustrate this by an example.

Thus µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a S-fuzzy sub-bigroup of G = G1 ∪ G2. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.2: Every t-level subset of a S-fuzzy sub-bigroup µ of a S-bigroup G 
need not in general be a S-sub bigroup of the S-bigroup G. 
 
Proof: The proof is by an example. Take G = {0, 1, –1, 2, 4, 6,…} to be a S-bigroup. 
G  =  G1  ∪  G2 = {–1, 1}  ∪  {0, 2, 4, 6,…}.  (G1 , y)  is  a  group  and  (G2 , +)  is  a 
S-semigroup.

 of the S-fuzzy sub-bigroup µ is not a sub-

Now we proceed on to define the bilevel subset of the Smarandache fuzzy sub-
bigroup of a S-bigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.8:  Let  (G  =  G1  ∪  G2,  +,  y )  be  a  bigroup  and  µ = (µ1 ∪ µ2) 
be a S-fuzzy sub-bigroup of G. The bilevel subset of the S-fuzzy sub-bigroup µ of the 
S-bigroup G is defined as Gµ

element of P2 ⊂ G2 where P2 is the proper subset of G2 which is the subgroup of G2 
relative to which µ2 is defined.  
 
It is left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.3: Every bilevel subset of a S-fuzzy sub-bigroup µ of a S-bigroup G is a 
S-sub-bigroup of the S-bigroup G.  
 
Now we define the concept of Smarandache fuzzy sub-bigroup of a S-semigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.9: A fuzzy subset µ of a S-semigroup G is said to be a Smarandache 
fuzzy sub-bisemigroup (S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup) of the S-semigroup G if there exists 
two S-fuzzy subsemigroups µ1 and µ2 of µ (µ1 ≠ µ and µ2 ≠ µ) such that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
Here by the term S-fuzzy subsemigroup of µ we mean that λ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup 
of the S-semigroup G and λ ⊆ µ (where µ is also a fuzzy subgroup of G). 
 
Example 2.4.2: Consider the additive S-semigroup G; G = {0, ± 1, ± 2, …, 
t2
n
 | n = 
0, 1, 2, … and t = 1, 2, …}. Clearly G is a S-semigroup.

It is easily verified µ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of the S-semigroup G for we have

In view of these definitions and examples we have the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.4: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G 
where µ1 and µ2 are S-fuzzy subsemigroups of G. For t ∈ [0, min {µ1 (e1), µ2 (e2)}] 
where e1 and e2 are identity elements of P1 and P2 (P1 ⊂ G1 , P2 ⊂ G2 subgroups of G1 
and G2 relative to which µ1 and µ2 are defined. The level subset 
t
Gµ  of µ can be 
represented as the union of two subsemigroups of the S-semigroup G, that is  
t
Gµ . 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.5:  Let  µ  be  a Smarandache fuzzy subsemigroup of a S-semigroup G 
with 3 ≤  o(Im(µ)) < ∞ then  there  exists  two  S-fuzzy subsemigroups  µ1  and  µ2  of 
µ, (µ1 ≠ µ, µ2 ≠ µ) such that µ = µ1  ∪  µ2.  
 
Proof:  Let  µ  be a S-fuzzy subsemigroup  of  the S-semigroup G. Suppose Im (µ) = 
{a1, a2,…, an} where 3 ≤ n < ∞ and a1 > a2 > … > an. Choose b1, b2 ∈ [0, 1] be such 
that  a1 > b1 > a2 > b2 > a3 > b3 > … > an and define µ1, µ2: P → [0, 1], P a subgroup of 
the S-semigroup G relative to which µ is defined.

Thus it can be easily verified that both µ1 and µ2 are S-fuzzy subsemigroups of µ. 
Further µ1 ≠ µ, µ2 ≠ µ and µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 

 
252
 
It is very evident that the condition 3 ≤  o(Im µ) < ∞ cannot be dropped. 
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.6: Every S-fuzzy sub bisemigroup of a S-semigroup G is a S-fuzzy sub-
semigroup of the S-semigroup G and not conversely.  
 
THEOREM 2.4.7: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a S-semigroup G with 3 ≤ o(Im µ) ≤ ∞ 
then µ is a S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of the S-semigroup G if and only if µ is a S-fuzzy 
sub-bisemigroup of the S-semigroup G. 
 
Proof: The µ once defined, it is relative to a particular fixed proper subset P of G 
where P is a subgroup under the operations of G. The rest of the result is identical 
with the fuzzy sub-bigroup. Almost all the definitions and properties derived in case 
of S-fuzzy semigroups can be easily defined and derived for S-fuzzy bigroups and    
S-fuzzy bisemigroups. We just give very few of the related results S-fuzzy bigroups 
and S-fuzzy bisubsemigroup notions in this section. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.10: Let (G, +,y) be a S-bigroup. G = G1 ∪ G2 where (G1, +) is a 
group and (G2, y) is a S-semigroup. A: G → [0, 1] where A = A1 ∪ A2 with A1 a 
divisible fuzzy subgroups of G1 and A2 is a divisible S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G2 (i.e. 
A2 : G2 →  [0, 1] is such that A2 restricted to the subgroup P2 of G2 is a fuzzy 
subgroup G2).  Then  we  call A = A1 ∪ A2: G → [0, 1] is a Smarandache divisible 
fuzzy subgroup (S-divisible fuzzy sub-bigroup) of G. 
 
Several interesting results in this direction can be obtained. 
 
Let G be a S-bigroup; (G = G1 ∪ G2) A = A1 ∪ A2: G → [0, 1] be a S-fuzzy sub-
bisemigroup of G; i.e., A1: G1 ⇒ [0, 1] is a fuzzy subgroup of G1 and A2 : G2 → [0, 1] 
is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G2 related to S-sub-bigroup P of G.

DEFINITION 2.4.11:  Let  (G = G1 ∪ G2,  +,  y) be a S-bigroup. Let A : G → [0, 1] be 
a S-fuzzy bisubsemigroup of G. Let B ∈ S (F(A)). Then B is said to be Smarandache 
pure (S-pure) in A if and only if for all fuzzy singletons xt ⊂ B with t > 0, for all n ∈ N 
for all yt ∈ A, n (yt) = xt implies that there exists bt ⊂ B such that n(bt) = xt. 
 
Next we define Smarandache (∈,∈∨q)- fuzzy sub-bigroup of a S-bigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.12:  Let  (G, +, y)  be  a  S-bigroup. A  fuzzy  subset  λ  =  λ1  ∪  λ2 : 
G = G1 ∪ G2  → [0, 1] is said to be a Smarandache (∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy sub-bigroup       
(S-(∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy sub-bigroup)  of  G  if 
 
i.For any x, y ∈ G1 and t, r ∈ (0,1] λ1 : G1 → [0, 1], (G1,+) a group; xt, yr 
∈ λ1 ⇒ (xy)M (t ,r) ∈∨qλ1 and  

 
253
ii.xt ∈ λ1 ⇒ (x–1)t ∈∨qλ1 
iii.λ2 : G2 → [0, 1], λ2 defined on P2 ⊂ G2 (P2 subgroup of the S-semigroup 
(G2, y)) is such that for any x, y ∈ P2 and t, r ∈ (0,1], xt, yr ∈ λ2 ⇒ 
(xy)M(t,r) ∈∨ qλ2 and 
iv.xt ∈ λ2 ⇒ (x–1)t ∈∨ qλ2. 
 
The conditions in the above definition are respectively equivalent to 
 
i. 
λ1 (xy) ≥ M (λ1 (x), λ1 (y), 0.5) for x, y ∈ G1 . 
ii. 
λ2 (xy) ≥ M (λ2 (x), λ2 (y), 0.5) for x, y ∈ P2 ⊂ G2 (P2 subgroup of G2). 
iii. 
λ1(x–1) ≥ M (λ1 (x), 0.5) for all x ∈ G1 .  
iv. 
λ2(x–1) ≥ M (λ2 (x), 0.5) for all x ∈ P2 ⊂ G2 . 
 
Further we have for any S-(∈,∈∨ q) - fuzzy sub-bisemigroup  λ  = λ1 ∪ λ2  of  G  = 
G1 ∪ G2 with λ1 (x) ≥ 0.5 for some x ∈ G1, λ1 (e1) ≥ 0.5, e is the identity element of G1 
and λ2 (x) ≥ 0.5 for some x ∈ P2 ⊂ G2, λ2 (e2) ≥ 0.5; e2 identity element of P2 relative 
to which λ2 is defined. 
 
Further if λ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of G then λ is an S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy 
subsemigroup. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.13: Let (G = G1 ∪ G2, +, y) be a S-bigroup. λ a S-fuzzy sub-
bisemigroup of G. λ = λ1 ∪ λ2 : G = G1 ∪ G2 → [0, 1] such that λ1 : G1 → [0, 1] is 
fuzzy subgroup and λ2 : G2 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup relative to P ⊂ G2; λ 
is said to be a  
 
i. 
S- (∈,∈)-fuzzy normal if for all x, y ∈ G1 and t ∈ (0,1] xt ∈ λ1 ⇒ (y–1 xy)t 
∈ λ1. For x, y ∈ P2 ⊂ G2 and t ∈ (0,1], xt ∈ λ2 ⇒ (y–1 xy)t ∈ λ2. 
 
ii. 
 S-(∈, ∈∨ q)-fuzzy normal (or simply fuzzy normal). 
 
a 
if for any x, y ∈ G1 and t ∈ (0,1],  xt ∈ λ1 ⇒ (y–1 xy)t ∈∨ qλ1. 
b 
if for any x, y ∈ G2 and t ∈ (0,1] , xt ∈ λ2 ⇒ (y–1 xy)t ∈∨ qλ2. 
 
Several results derived for groups using S-(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy subgroup and S-(∈∨ q)- 
fuzzy level subgroups can be derived in an analogous way with appropriate 
modifications in case of S-bigroups.  
 
The reader is requested to refer [24] and [135] for more innovative notions and 
concepts. Now we just define the concept of  Smarandache (∈,∈)-fuzzy left (resp. 
right)  coset  of  a S-bigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.14: Let G be a S-bigroup i.e. G = G1 ∪ G2, (G1, +) is a group and

G; i.e. λ = λ1 ∪ λ2 where λ1: G1 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy semigroup and λ2 : G2 → [0, 1]

DEFINITION 2.4.16: Let G be a S-bigroup. H be a S-sub-bigroup of G. H of G is said

H y K = K y H. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.17: Let  G  be  a  S-bigroup.  A  S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup ξ  of  G =

fuzzy sub-bisemi group η of G. 
 
Unless otherwise mentioned G will denote a S-bigroup with e1 identity of G1 and e2 
the identity of P2 ⊂ G2 and λ an S-(∈, ∈∨q) fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of G. By a S-fuzzy

⊂ G2, t ∈ (0, 1], zt ∈ ( λ o µ) implies zt ∈∨q (µ o λ) and if z ∈ P2 ⊂ G2.  
 
(P2 is the subgroup relative to which G2 is defined) and zt ∈ (µ o λ) implies      
zt ∈∨ q (λ o µ). 
 
The following theorem is left an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.9: λ is S-(∈,∈)-fuzzy quasi normal if and only if for any S-fuzzy sub-
bisemigroup µ of G and for all z ∈ G1 (or z ∈ P2 ⊂ G2), (λ o µ)(z) = (µ o λ)(z). 
 
THEOREM 2.4.10: λ is a S-(∈, ∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal if and only if for any S-fuzzy 
sub-bisemigroup µ of G and for all z ∈ G1 and for all z ∈ P2 ⊂ G2 (P2 a subgroup of 
G2) we have (µ o λ)(z) = (λ o µ)(z) if (λ o µ)(z) < 0.5 and (µ o λ)(z) ≥ 0.5 if (λ o µ)(z) 
≥ 0.5. 
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy subgroups. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.11: If λ is a S-fuzzy quasi normal subsemigroup of the S-bigroup G = 
G1 ∪ G2, then λ is an S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy quasi normal sub-bisemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: Using definitions and the fact that λ = λ1 ∪ λ2 and λ1 is fuzzy quasi normal 
subgroup of G1 and λ2 is a fuzzy quasi normal subgroup of P2 contained in G2. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.12: Let H be any non-empty subset of G = G1 ∪ G2   i.e.  H =  H1 ∪ H2 
(H1 ⊂ G1 and H2 ⊂ G2). Then H is a S-quasi normal sub-bisemigroup of G if and only 
if XH (the characteristic function H) is an S-(∈,∈∨ q)-fuzzy quasi normal sub-
bisemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy subgroups.

THEOREM 2.4.14: Let λ be a fuzzy subset of a S-bigroup G with sup property and for 
all t ∈ (0,1], S-(∈∨ q)-level subset λt be a S-quasi normal sub-bisemigroup of G. Then 
λ is an S-(∈, ∈∨ q)-fuzzy quasi normal sub-bisemigroup of S-bigroup G. 

 
256
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy subgroup G the result can be easily proved for S-bigroup 
G. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.15: Let f : G → H be S-bigroup homomorphism from the S-bigroup G 
to S-bigroup H. Then  
 
i. f (λ o θ ) = f(λ) o f(θ ) where λ and θ are S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroups of G. 
ii. f(f –1(θ )) = θ where θ is a S-fuzzy sub-bigroup of f(G). 
 
Proof: Follows by the very definitions. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.16: Let f : G → H be a S-bigroup homomorphism of the S-bigroups G 
and H If λ is an S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy quasi normal sub-bisemigroups of G then f(λ) is an 
S-(∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy quasi normal sub-bisemigroup of f(G). 
 
Proof: Follows by the very definitions. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.17: Let f : G → H be a S-bigroup homomorphism and µ be an 
(∈,∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal sub-bisemigroup of H with sup-property. Then f –1(µ) is a 
S-(∈, ∈∨q)-fuzzy quasi normal sub-bisemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader to prove, using the fact f : G = G1 ∪ G2 → H = H1 ∪ H2 
where  f  =  f1 ∪ f2 where f1 : G1 → H1 is a group homomorphism f2 : G2 → H2  is  a 
S-semigroup homomorphism i.e. f2 : P2 ⊂ G2 → Q2 ⊂ H2 where P2 and Q2 are 
subgroups of G2 and H2 respectively .

Several interesting results in this direction can be obtained, some of the results are 
proposed as problems in section 2.5. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.24: Let  A  be  a  fuzzy  subset  of  a S-bigroup G. Then A is called a 
S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of G  and a  t-norm T (T-fuzzy bigroup) if and only if for all 
x, y ∈ G.  
 
i. 
A1 (xy) ≥ T (A1(x), A1(x), A1(y)) x, y ∈ G1.  
ii. 
A1(e) = 1 where e is the identity of G1. 
iii. 
A1(x) = A1(x–1).  
iv. 
A2(xy) ≥ T (A2(x), A2(y)), x, y ∈ P2 ⊂ G2 (P2 a subgroup of G2 
relative to which A = A1 ∪ A2 is defined).  
v. 
A2(e) = 1 where e is the identity of P2 ⊂ G2.  
vi. 
A1(x) = A1(x–1) for x ∈ P2 ⊂ G2, A is called the Smarandache 
Min fuzzy sub-bisemigroup (S-Min fuzzy sub-bisemigroup) if A satisfies 
conditions (i) to (vi) only by replacing T with Min. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.25: Let A be a fuzzy subset of a S-bigroup G. Then the subset {x ∈ G| 
A(x) ≥ t} of G= G1 ∪ G2 is called the Smarandache t-level subset (S-t-level subset) of 

 
258
G under A denoted by At (i.e. A = A1 ∪ A2 and At = (A1)t ∪ (A2)t with A1(x1) ≥ t if                  
x1 ∈ G1  and A2(x2) ≥ t if x2 ∈ G2). 
 
THEOREM 2.4.19: Let A be a S-Min fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of the S-bigroup G. Then 
every t-level subset At of G, t ∈ [0, A(e)] = [0, A1 (e1) ∪ A2 (e2)] where e1 is the 
identity of the group G1 and e2 is the identity of the subgroup P2 in G2 relative to 
which A is defined is a S-sub-bigroup of G. 
 
Proof: Follows by the very definitions; hence left for the reader as an exercise to 
prove. 
 
THEOREM 2.4.20: Let A be a fuzzy subset of a S-bigroup G such that every t-level 
subset At of G, t ∈ Im (A) and A(e1) = 1 = A(e2) where e1 is the identity element of G1 
and e2 is  the  identity element of P2 in G2 relative to which A is defined. Then A is a 
S-Min fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of G. 
 
Proof: As in case of groups. Hence the reader is requested to obtain the proof.

,  x1 ∈ G1 and x2 ∈ P2 ⊂ G2 (P2 subgroup relative to which  
A  =  A1  ∪  A2  is  defined) is  called  the  Smarandache fuzzy order  (S-fuzzy order) 
of x ∈ G1 ∪ G2 relative to A and use the notation A1 o (x1) = n1 and A2 o (x2) = n2.  
 
If n1  and  n2  does  not  exist  we  say  x1  and  x2  is  of  Smarandache infinite fuzzy 
order (S-infinite fuzzy order) with respect to A1  and  A2  and write A1  o (x1) = ∞ and 
A2 o (x2) =∞. From the above definition we see A1  o (x1) = O(x1) if and only if A1 = 
{e1} such that x1 ∈ G1 and O(x1) is the order of x1 and A2 o (x2) = O(x2) if and only if 
A2 = {e2} such that x2 ∈ P2 (P2 ⊂ G2 is a subgroup of G2) and O(x2) is the order of x2. 
 
Thus we see the S-fuzzy order is a complete generalization of fuzzy order which is the 
generalization of the usual order of the S-bigroup. But that is not true for all x1 ∈ G1 
and  x2  ∈  P2  ⊂  G2  as G1 (x1 ) = 1;  hence  G1   o (x1 )  =  1  which  is  clearly 
impossible. P2 (x2 )  =  1, hence P2 o (x2 ) = 1 which is once again impossible. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache torsion part of a S-bigroup G. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.28: Let G = G1 ∪ G2 be a S-bigroup. A be a S-T-fuzzy sub-
bisemigroup  of  the  bigroup G. Then the  S-sub-bigroup  of  all  elements in A whose 
S-fuzzy orders with respect to A = A1 ∪ A2 are finite is called the Smarandache 
torsion part (S-torsion part) of G relative to A and is denoted by S(TA). 
 
Several interesting results in this direction can be developed. We propose some 
problems for the reader in section 2.5. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache order of the S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup A. 
 
DEFINITION 2.4.29: Let A be a S-T-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of the S-bigroup G. Then 
the least common multiple of the S-fuzzy order of the elements of G with respect to A 
is called the Smarandache order (S-order) of the S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup A and it is 
denoted by

We call a S-bigroup G = G1 ∪ G2 to be Smarandache primary (S-primary) if G1 is a 
primary group and every proper subset P2 of G2 which is a subgroup of G2 is a 
primary group. We say the S-bigroup G = G1 ∪ G2 to be Smarandache weakly 
primary (S-weakly primary) if G1 is primary and atleast a proper subset which is a 
proper subgroup in G2 is primary.

Chapter Three 
 
SMARANDACHE FUZZY GROUPOIDS AND 
THEIR GENERALIZATION 
 
This chapter mainly introduces the notions of Smarandache fuzzy groupoid and 
Smarandache fuzzy bigroups. Several interesting results in this direction are given. 
The chapter has four sections. In section one we give some results on Smarandache 
fuzzy groupoids and around 20 definitions related to Smarandache fuzzy groupoids 
are given. Groupoids are the generalizations of loops; so, as all loops are groupoids, 
the Smarandache fuzzy loop study has become inevitable. In section two we define 
Smarandache fuzzy loop and study these notions. The third section gives in 26 
definitions the concepts about Smarandache fuzzy bigroupoids and Smarandache 
fuzzy biloops. In order to make this book appealing to researchers, in the final section 
we give 111 problems, which would make a reader master the Smarandache fuzzy 
groupoid and its generalizations. 
 
 
3.1   Some results on Smarandache Fuzzy groupoids 
 
In this section we for the first time define the notion of Smarandache fuzzy groupoids 
and illustrate it with examples. Fuzzy groupoids are studied extensively by several 
researchers like [11, 45, 47, 89, 90, 110].   
 
DEFINITION 3.1.1: A Smarandache groupoid (S-groupoid) G is a groupoid which has 
a proper subset S, S ⊂ G such that S under the operations of G is a semigroup.  
 
Example 3.1.1: G = {0, 1, 2, …, 5} be a groupoid given by the following table: 
 
o 
0

Clearly A = {0, 3} is a semigroup of G. Thus G is a S-groupoid. 
 
For several properties about S-groupoids please refer [128]. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.2: Let G be a S-groupoid. A fuzzy subset µ from G to [0, 1] is said to 
be a Smarandache fuzzy groupoid (S-fuzzy groupoid) G if µ restricted to at least one 
of the proper subsets P ⊂ G, P a semigroup under the operations of G we have µ (xy) 
≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)} for x, y ∈ P, we denote this by µP . If for every proper subset Pi of 
the S-groupoid G. Pi  a semigroup,  the fuzzy subset µ : G → [0, 1] is a such that 
iP
µ  

 
266
is a fuzzy semigroup, then we call µ : G → [0, 1] a Smarandache strong fuzzy 
groupoid (S-strong fuzzy groupoid) of G. 
 
THEOREM  3.1.1:  Let  G  be a S-groupoid. Every S-strong fuzzy groupoid µ of G is a 
S-fuzzy groupoid µ of G. 
 
Proof: Follows by the very definitions. 
 
The definition of S-fuzzy groupoids using S-groupoids will be called as the type I or 
level I S-fuzzy groupoids, by default of notation we just denote it by S-fuzzy 
groupoids. 
 
We define level II or type II S-fuzzy groupoids in the following. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.3: Let µ : X → [0, 1] be a fuzzy subgroupoid of the groupoid X with 
respect to a t-norm T. We  say  µ  is  a  Smarandache  fuzzy  subgroupoid  of  type  II 
(S-fuzzy subgroupoid of type II) of X if and only if X is a S-groupoid. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.2: Every S-fuzzy subgroupoid of type II (S-subgroupoid of type II) of X 
is a fuzzy subgroup of X. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition. 
 
THEOREM 3.1.3:  Let  X  be  a  groupoid.  Every  fuzzy  subgroupoid  X  need  not  be  
a S-fuzzy subgroupoid of X. 
 
Proof: Follows from the fact if X is not a S-groupoid then certainly even if X is a 
fuzzy subgroupoid of X, X will not be a S-fuzzy subgroupoid of X. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.4: Let X1 and X2 be two S-groupoids. Let µ1 and µ2 be S-fuzzy 
subgroupoids of X1 and X2 respectively, with respect to a t-norm T. The S-fuzzy 
subgroupoids 
µ1 
and 
µ2 
are 
Smarandache 
homomorphic 
(isomorphic)                      
(S-homomorphic (isomorphic)) if and only if there exists a S-groupoid homomorphic 
(isomorphism) φ : X1 → X2 such that µ1 = µ2 o φ . In this situation we say that µ1 is 
given by a Smarandache pull back (S-pull back) of µ2 along φ . 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.5: Let (X, y) be a S-groupoid. Let G be the family of S-subgroupoids 
of X. G is called a Smarandache generating family (S-generating family) if for every 
element x ∈ S ⊂ X (S a semigroup of X) there exists P ∈ X such that x ∈ P. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.6: Let (X, y) be a S-groupoid and let Y be a fixed S-subgroupoid of X. 
Let (Ω, A, P) be a probability space and let (V, ~) be a S-groupoid of functions 
mapping Ω into X with ~ defined by point wise multiplication in range space. A 
further restriction in placed on V by assuming that for each f ∈ V; Xf : {ω ∈ Ω | f(ω) 
∈ Y} is an element of A . Then υ : V → [0, 1] defined by υ(f) = P (Xf) for each f ∈ V is 
a fuzzy subgroupoid of V with respect to TM. If P (Xf) is a S-fuzzy subgroupoid of V for 
each f ∈ V then we say the S-fuzzy subgroupoid obtained in this manner is called 
Smarandache function generated (S-function generated). 
 

 
267
An innovative reader can obtain several interesting results in this direction. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.7: Let f  : X → X' be a S-homomorphism from a S-groupoid X into a      
S-groupoid X. Suppose that ν is a S-fuzzy subgroupoid of X' with respect to a t-norm 
T. Then the fuzzy let µ = ν o f (defined by µ(x) = ν (f (x)) for all x ∈ X) is called the 
Smarandache pre image (S-pre image) of ν under f. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.8: Let f : X  →  X'  be  a  S-homomorphism from the S-groupoid X 
onto S-groupoid X'. Suppose that µ is a S-fuzzy subgroupoid of X with respect to a       
t-norm T, then the fuzzy set ν in X' = f(X) defined by  
 
ν (y) =

for all y ∈ X' is called the Smarandache image (S-image) of µ under f. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.9: A fuzzy relation µ on a S-groupoid X is said to be fuzzy left (resp. 
right) Smarandache compatible (S-compatible) if for all x, y, s ∈ P ⊂ X, P a 
semigroup in X. µ (sx, sy) [resp µ(xs, ys)] ≥  µ(x, y). A S-fuzzy C-equivalence relation 
µ on a S-groupoid X is said to be a S-fuzzy C-congruence relation on P ⊂  X  if  
M(µ(x , y), µ(z, ω)) ≤ µ (xz, yω) for all x, y, z, ω ∈ P ⊂ X. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.10: A S-fuzzy subgroupoid λ of a S-groupoid X is called a S-fuzzy 
regular subgroupoid if for all x ∈ P ⊂ X their exist x1 ∈ Rα such that (x, t) ∈αλ 
implies (x1, t) ∈α ∨ qa , b λ for all t ∈ (a, c] or equivalently for all x ∈ λsa there exists 
x1 ∈ Rα such that λ (x1) ≥  M (λ(x), k). 
 
For more about notations please refer [34]. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.11:  A  fuzzy  inverse  subsemigroup  λ  of  a  S-groupoid  X  is  
called a S-fuzzy normal subsemigroup if 
 
i. 
λ(e) ≥  k for all idempotent e in P ⊂ X (P-semigroup in X). 
ii. 
λ is fuzzy closed. 
iii. 
(x, t) ∈α λ ⇒ (yxy–1, t) ∈α∨ qab λ for all x, y ∈ P and all t ∈ (a, c].  
 
(iii) is equivalent to λ (yx y–1) ≥ M (λ(x) , k) for all x ∈ λsα  for all y ∈ P ⊂ S. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.12: Let X be a S-groupoid. A fuzzy subset f of X is called S-fuzzy left 
ideal of X if P o f ⊆  f and f is called the S-fuzzy right ideal of X if f o P ⊆  f, P a 
semigroup of X. If f is both a S-fuzzy left and S-fuzzy right ideal of X then f is called a 
S-fuzzy ideal i.e. f(xy) ≥ max {f(x), f(y)} for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ X. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.13: A fuzzy left ideal f is called Smarandache prime (S-prime) if for 
any two S-fuzzy ideals f1 and f2 , f1  o  f2  ⊆  f implies f1  ⊆  f  or  f2  ⊆  f. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.14: A S-fuzzy left ideal f is called Smarandache quasi prime (S-quasi 
prime) if for any two S-fuzzy left ideals f1 and f2, f1 o f2 ⊂ f implies f1 ⊂ f or f2 ⊂ f. f is 

 
268
called Smarandache quasi semiprime (S-quasi semiprime) if for any S-fuzzy ideal g of 
X; g2 ⊂  f implies g ⊂  f. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.15: A fuzzy subset f of a S-groupoid X is called Smarandache fuzzy 
m-system (S-fuzzy m-system) if for any t, s ∈ [0, 1) and a, b ∈ P ⊂ X, f(a) ≥ t, f(b) > s 
imply that there exists an element x ∈ P such that f (a x b) > t ∨ s. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.16: A S-fuzzy left ideal f is called Smarandache weakly quasi-prime 
(S-weakly quasi-prime)  if  for any  two  S-fuzzy left ideals  f1  and  f2 such that f  ⊆  f1 , 
f  ⊆  f2  and  f1  o  f2  ⊆  f  then   f1  ⊆  f   or  f2  ⊆  f. 
 
Notation: Let f be a S-fuzzy left ideal of a S-groupoid X, we define two fuzzy subsets 
of X denoted by i(f) and i(f) respectively as follows : For all x ∈ P ⊂ S

DEFINITION 3.1.17: A  S-groupoid  X  is  called  Smarandache  strongly  semisimple  
(S-strongly semisimple)  if  left  ideal  of  X  is idempotent.  A  S-fuzzy  ideal  f  of  a  
S-groupoid X is called idempotent if f = f o f that is f = f 2. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.18: Let X be a S-groupoid. We call X a Smarandache fuzzy 
multiplicative groupoid (S-fuzzy multiplicative groupoid) if for any two S-fuzzy ideals 
µ and δ  of X satisfying µ ≤ δ there exists a S-fuzzy ideal λ of X such that µ = δ λ. 
 
(Recall for X a S-groupoid; λ a fuzzy subset of X is called a S-fuzzy ideal of X if 
λ(xy) ≥ max{λ(x), λ(y)} for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ X (P a proper subset of X which is a 
semigroup). 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.19: Let I = [0, 1], IX will denote the set of all mappings λ: X → I, 
M(x, y) will denote the minimum of x and y. Let λ µ ∈ IX. Then λ µ: X → I is defined 
by λµ(x) = sup {M (λ(y), µ(z)) | x = yz} for all x ∈ P ⊂ X. A S-fuzzy ideal λ of X is 
called a proper S-fuzzy ideal if λ = χX. Also for any two –S-fuzzy ideals λ, µ , λ < µ 
will mean λ ≤ µ,. λ ≠ µ. 
 
A S-fuzzy ideal λ of the S-groupoid X is called S-prime if for any two S-fuzzy ideals 
µ, δ of X µδ ≤ λ ⇒ µ ≤ λ or δ ≤ λ. 
 
For a S-fuzzy ideal λ of a S-groupoid X, the Smarandache fuzzy radical (S-fuzzy 
radical) of λ denoted by S(rad λ) is defined by  
 
S(rad λ(x)) = sup { λ (xn) n ∈ N} for all x ∈P ⊂ X ;  
 
λ defined relative to P in X. Clearly S(rad λ(x)) is a S-fuzzy ideal of X.  
 
DEFINITION 3.1.20: A S-fuzzy ideal µ of a S-groupoid X is said to be idempotent if µ 
= µ2. A S-fuzzy ideal of form xrχP where xr is a fuzzy point of the S-groupoid X is 

 
269
called a Smarandache principal fuzzy ideal (S-principal fuzzy ideal) of X. (P ⊂ X; P is 
a semigroup). 
 
Several other interesting results in this direction can be obtained. We define 
Smarandache compatible fuzzy relation on a S-groupoid X. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.21: Let X be a S-groupoid. Let P1, P2, ... , Pr be r (r >1) proper subset 
of X which are semigroups under the operations of X. Let λ be a fuzzy relation on the 
groupoid X. We say λ is a Smarandache compatible (S-compatible) on X, if λ(ac, bd) 
≥  min{λ(a, b), λ(c, d)} for all a, b, c, d in each Pi ⊂ X, i.e. for i = 1, 2, …, r. 
 
A Smarandache compatible fuzzy equivalence relation (S-compatible fuzzy 
equivalence relation) on a S-groupoid X is a Smarandache congruence                        
(S-congruence) on X. If λ is compatible on atleast one of the Pi’s then we say λ is 
Smarandache weakly compatible (S-weakly compatible). 
 
Any interested reader can obtain several exciting relations in this direction. Let λ be a 
fuzzy relation on a set X and let 0 ≤ α ≤ 1; λ is α-reflexive on X if λ (a, a) = α and 
λ(a, b) ≤ α for a, b ∈ X. An α-reflexive, symmetric and transitive fuzzy relation on X 
is a fuzzy α-equivalence relation on X. We call a compatible fuzzy α-equivalence 
relation on a groupoid, an α-equivalence. A fuzzy α-equivalence relation is a fuzzy 
equivalence if  α  = 1 and every fuzzy α-equivalence relation is a G-equivalence. A 
G-reflexive and transitive fuzzy relation on X is a G-preorder on X. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.22: Let X and Y be two nonempty set. A mapping f : X × X → Y × Y is 
called a semibalanced mapping if  
 
i. 
Given a ∈ X there exists a u ∈ Y such that f (a, a) = (u, u)  
ii. 
f(a, a) = (u, u) and f (b, b) = (v, v) where a, b ∈ X,  u, v ∈ Y 
implies f (a, b) =(u, v). 
 
Several important properties on semibalanced mapping can be derived. 
 
If f is a semibalanced map from X × X into Y × Y and µ is an α-equivalence fuzzy 
relation on Y then f–1(µ) is an α-equivalence fuzzy relation on X. 
 
DEFINITION 3.1.23: Let  f  be a map from X × X into Y × Y. A fuzzy relation λ on X is 
f-invariant if f(a, b) = f(a1 , b1 ) implies that λ(a, b) = λ(a1 , b1 ). A fuzzy relation λ on 
X is weakly f-invariant if f(a, b) = f (a1 , b) implies λ(a, b) = λ(a1 , b). 
 
We have several important properties about f-invariant fuzzy relation λ. A mapping is 
a balanced mapping if  
 
i. 
f (a, b) = (u, u) ⇒ a = b. 
ii. 
f (a, b) = (u, v) ⇒ f (b, a) = (v, u). 
iii. 
f (a, a) = (u, u) and f(b, b) = (v, v) ⇒ f(a, b) = (u, v)  
 
for all a, b ∈ X and u, v ∈ Y.  

 
270
 
A mapping f : X × X → Y × Y is a balanced mapping if and only if it is one to one 
semibalanced mapping. Let µ be a fuzzy relation on Y and f be a map from X × X into 
Y × Y. We say µ is f-stable if f (a, b) = (u, u) where a ≠ b ∈ X and u ∈ Y implies that 
µ(f(a, b)) ≤ µ f (x, x)) for all x ∈ X. 
 
Several innovative results in this direction are derived by [45]. 
 
The application of Smarandache fuzzy groupoids to the study of fuzzy automaton will 
find its place in the seventh chapter of this book. 
 
 
3.2 Smarandache Fuzzy loops and its Properties  
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache fuzzy loops. Smarandache 
loops was introduced in [129] and the concept of fuzzy loops was introduced and 
studied in [118]. The notion of Smarandache fuzzy loops enjoys more properties than 
that of the fuzzy loops: 
 
Now we just recall the definition of Smarandache loop for the sake of completeness. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.1: A Smarandache loop (S-loop) is defined to be a loop L such that a 
proper subset A of L is a subgroup (with respect to the same induced operation) that 
is φ ≠ A ⊂ L. 
 
Example 3.2.1: Let L = {e, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be a loop given by the following table.

It is easily verified L is a S-loop. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.2: Let L be a loop. If L has no subloops but only subgroups then we 
call L a Smarandache subgroup loop (S-subgroup loop). 
 
Example 3.2.2: Let L = {e, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be the loop given in example 3.2.1. All 
subloops in L are subgroups. So L is a S-subgroup loop. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.3: Let L be a loop. A proper subset A of L is said to be a 
Smarandache subloop (S-subloop) of L if A is a subloop of L and A itself is a S-loop. 
i.e. A contains a proper subset B such that B is a group under the operations of L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.4: Let L be a loop. We say a non-empty subset A of L is a 
Smarandache normal subloop (S- normal subloop) of L if 

 
271
  
i. 
A is itself a normal subloop of L. 
ii. 
A contains a proper subset B where B is a subgroup under the 
operations of L.  
 
If L has no S-normal subloop we say the loop L is Smarandache simple (S-simple).  
 
Several results in this direction can be had from [129]. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.5: Let L be a S-loop. A fuzzy subset µ of L (µ : L → [0, 1]) is said to 
be a Smarandache fuzzy loop (S-fuzzy loop) if µ restricted to at least one of the proper 
subsets  of  P  of  L  where  R  is  a  group  under  the  operations  of  L  is  such  that 
µ(xy) ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)} for every x, y ∈ P. µ(x –1) = µ(x) for every x ∈ P. i.e. we can 
denote this S-fuzzy loop by µP for µ is defined relative to P. If µ : L → [0, 1] is a fuzzy 
subset and µ is such that for every proper subset P of L which is a subgroup of L,      
µ : P → [0, 1] is a fuzzy group; then we call µ a Smarandache strong fuzzy subloop 
(S-strong fuzzy subloop) of L. 
 
THEOREM 3.2.1: Every S-strong fuzzy subloop of L is a S-fuzzy subloop of L. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader as the proof is straightforward. 
 
This definition of S-fuzzy subloop and S-strong fuzzy subloop will be known as the 
level I or type I S-fuzzy subloops or S-strong fuzzy subloops. But by default of 
notation we do not mention it as type I or level I we just say S-fuzzy subloop.  
 
We give the results related with S-fuzzy subloops. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.6: Let L be a S-loop. A fuzzy subset µ of L is said to be a 
Smarandache fuzzy normal subloop (S-fuzzy normal subloop) if  
 
i. 
µ : L → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy subloop relative to P. (P a subgroup in L 
relative to which µ is defined). 
ii. 
µ(xy) = µ(yx) for all x, y ∈ P.  
 
Let µ be a S-fuzzy normal subloop of the loop L.  
 
For t ∈ [0, 1] the set µ t = {(x, y) ∈  P × P | µ (xy–1) ≥ t} is called a Smarandache       
t-level relation (S-t-level relation) of µ. 
 
Now we define Smarandache fuzzy coset of a S-loop L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.7: Let L be a S-loop µ be a S-fuzzy subloop of L. For any a ∈ P ⊂ L, 
P a subgroup of L, a µ defined by (aµ) (x) = µ (a–1x) for every x ∈ P ⊂ L is called the 
Smarandache fuzzy coset (S-fuzzy coset) of the S-loop L defined by a and µ. Thus if µ 
happens to be a S-strong fuzzy subloop of L then we see related to this µ we will have 
as many S-fuzzy cosets as the number of proper subsets of G which are subgroups of 
G. 
 

 
272
DEFINITION 3.2.8: Let λ and µ be two S-fuzzy subloops of a S-loop L. Then λ and µ 
are said to be Smarandache conjugate fuzzy subloops (S-conjugate fuzzy subloops) of 
L if for some p ∈ P.  (P subgroup in L relative to which λ and µ are defined) we have 
λ(x) = µ(p–1xp) for every x ∈ P ⊂ L. 
 
If λ and µ are S-conjugate fuzzy subloops of the S-loop L then o(λ) = o(µ ). 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.9: Let µ be a S-fuzzy subloop of a S-loop L then for any a, b ∈ P ⊆ L 
the Smarandache fuzzy middle coset (S-fuzzy middle coset) a µ b of the S-loop L is 
defined by (aµb) (x) = µ(a–1xb–1) for every x ∈ P ⊂ L. Further we see almost all 
results true in case of fuzzy groups can be extended in the case of S-fuzzy subloops of 
level I. 
 
Now we define Smarandache fuzzy relations on the S-loop L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.10: Let Rλ and Rµ be any two Smarandache fuzzy relations (S-fuzzy 
relations) on a S-loop L. Then Rλ and Rµ are said to be Smarandache conjugate fuzzy 
relations (S-conjugate fuzzy relations) on the S-loop L if there exists (g1 , g2) ∈ P × P 
⊂ L × L (P a subgroup in L relative to which fuzzy relations Rµ and Rλ are defined) 
such that Rλ(x, y) = Rµ (
)

DEFINITION 3.2.11: Let µ be a S-fuzzy subloop of a loop L. For a ∈ P (P ⊂ L a 
subgroup of L relative to which µ is defined). The Smarandache pseudo fuzzy coset 
(S-pseudo fuzzy coset) (aµ)p is defined by ((aµ)P)(x) = p(a)µ(x) for every x ∈ P ⊂ L 
and for some prime p. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.12: A S-fuzzy subloop µ of a S-loop L is said to be a Smarandache 
positive fuzzy subloop (S-positive fuzzy subloop) of the loop L if µ is a positive fuzzy 
subset of the S-loop L.  
 
Several interesting and innovative Smarandache analogue results can be established in 
this direction. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.13: A S-fuzzy subloop µ of a S-loop L is Smarandache normalized        
(S-normalized) if and only if µ(e) =1 where e is the identity element of the subgroup 
P,   P ⊂ L, P a subgroup of L relative to which µ is defined. 
 
DEFINITION [138]: A fuzzy topology τ on a group G is called a g-fuzzy topology. The 
pair (G, τ) is a g-fuzzy topological spaces.  
 
As loops are non-associative loops the concept of analogous l-topological spaces 
cannot be directly built using loops instead of groups. To overcome this problem the 
concept of S-loops becomes handy. To this end we next define Smarandache fuzzy 
topology on a S-loop L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.14: A fuzzy topology τ on a S-loop L is called a Smarandache l-fuzzy 
topology (S-l-fuzzy topology) if τ is a g-fuzzy topology relative to atleast one proper 
subset P of L where P is a subgroup. We call τ a Smarandache strong l-fuzzy topology   

 
273
(S-strong l-fuzzy topology) if τ is a S-g fuzzy topology with respect to every proper 
subset P of L. 
 
THEOREM 3.2.2: Every S-strong l-fuzzy topology is a S-l fuzzy topology. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition hence left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.15: Let τ1 and τ2 be S-l-fuzzy topologies on the S-loops L1 and L2 
respectively. A function f: (L1, τ1) → (L2 τ2) is said to be a Smarandache l-fuzzy 
continuous map (S-l-fuzzy continuous map) from L1 to L2 if 
 
i. 
f from two proper subsets P1  and P2  of  L1  and L2  respectively  is  such  
that     f : (P1 , τ1 ) → (P2 , τ2 ) is a g-fuzzy continuous map from P1  to P2. 
ii. 
for every µ ∈ τ2 , f –1(µ) ∈ τ1  and  
iii. 
for every S-fuzzy subloop µ of L2 in τ2 , f –1(µ) is a S-fuzzy subloop of G1 in 
τ1 . 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.16: Let (L1 , τ1 ) and (L2 , τ2 ) be any two S-l-fuzzy topological spaces. 
A function f : (L1 , τ1 ) → (L2 , τ2 ) is said to be a Smarandache l-fuzzy homomorphism 
(S-l-fuzzy homomorphism) if it satisfies the following 3 conditions. 
 
i. 
f : (P1 , τ1 ) → (P2 , τ2 ) is one to one and onto. (Pi is a subgroup of Li 
relative to which τ1  is defined for i = 1, 2).  
ii. 
f is a S-l-fuzzy continuous map from P1 to P2 and 
iii. 
f –1 is S-l-fuzzy continuous map from P2 to P1 . 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.17: A fuzzy subset µ of a S-l-fuzzy topological space (L, τ) is called a 
Smarandache Ql -neighborhood (S-Ql -neighborhood) of the fuzzy point xt (for x ∈ P 
⊂ L, P a subgroup relative to which τ is defined) if and only if there exists S-fuzzy 
subloop λ (of L) in τ such that λ ⊆ µ, xt qλ (where xt qλ means t + λ (x) > 1 and xt is 
quasi coincident with λ). 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.18: A S-l-fuzzy topological space (L, τ) is said to be a S-l-fuzzy 
Hausdorff space if  and  only  if  for  any  two  fuzzy  points  xt  and  ys (x , y  ∈ P,  P a 
subset  of  L  which  is  a subgroup relative to which τ is defined x ≠ y)  there  exists  
S-Ql-neighborhoods λ and µ of xt and ys respectively such that λ ∩ µ = φ G. 
 
We have earlier defined the notion of fuzzy singletons; now we proceed on to define 
Smarandache p-primary fuzzy subloop of a S-loop L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.19: Let L be a S-loop. µ is called a Smarandache p-primary subloop 
(S-p-primary subloop) of a S-loop L ⇔ there exits a prime p such that for all fuzzy 
singleton xt ⊂ µ with t > 0 there exists n ∈ N (N-integers) such that pn(xt) = 0t . 
 
DEFINITION 3.2.20: Let L be a S-loop µ is called a Smarandache divisible fuzzy 
subloop (S-divisible fuzzy subloop) of L if and only if for all singletons xt ⊂ µ with        
t > 0, there exists n ∈ N there exists a fuzzy singleton yt ⊂ µ such that n(yt ) = xt .  
 

 
274
DEFINITION 3.2.21: Let {µα | α ∈ Ω} be a collection of S-fuzzy subloops of a S-loop

DEFINITION 3.2.22:  A  fuzzy  subset  λ  of  a  S-Loop L is said to be a Smarandache 
(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy subloop (S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy subloop) of L relative to a proper subset P 
⊂ L, P a subgroup in L if for any x, y ∈ P and t, r ∈ (0, 1]

The application of S-fuzzy groupoids and S-fuzzy bigroupoids will be described and 
discussed in Chapter VII of this book. The major application of them being in the 
fuzzy automaton theory. 
 
 
3.3  Smarandache fuzzy bigroups and Smarandache fuzzy biloops 
 
This section is fully devoted to the introduction of Smarandache fuzzy biloops and 
Smarandache fuzzy bigroupoid. In chapter I we have introduced the notion of both 
fuzzy biloops and fuzzy bigroupoids. 

 
276
 
Study of just biloops and bigroupoids is elaborately done is [135]. So here we define 
several of the properties of Smarandache biloops and Smarandache bigroupoids and 
proceed on to sketch their applications. 
 
DEFINITION [128]: Let (G, +, y) be a non empty set. We call G a Smarandache 
bigroupoid (S-bigroupoid) if G1 ∪ G2 where G1 and G2 are proper subsets of G 
satisfying the following conditions  
 
i. 
(G1 , +) is a S-groupoid. 
ii. 
(G2 , y) is a S-semigroup. 
 
Several interesting and important properties used about them can be had from [135]. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.1: Let  (G  = G1 ∪ G2 , +, y)  be  a  S-bigroupoid.  A  fuzzy  subset    
µ : G → [0, 1] is called the Smarandache fuzzy sub-bigroupoid (S-fuzzy sub-
bigroupoid) of G if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 where µ1  : G1 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy subgroupoid of 
G1 (µ restricted to G1 denoted by µ1 ) µ2 : G2 →  [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of 
G2 (µ restricted to G2 is denoted by µ2). Thus we say if µ : G → [0, 1] that is               
µ = µ1  ∪  µ2 : G1 ∪ G2 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy bigroupoid then µ1  : G1 → [0, 1] which 
is  a  S-fuzzy subgroupoid  is  defined  related  to  a  semigroup  P1  of  G1  and          
µ2  :  G2 → [0, 1] which is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup is defined related to a subgroup P2 
of G2 .  
 
Thus we can give yet another definition of the Smarandache fuzzy sub-bigroupoids 
which we choose to call it as Smarandache fuzzy sub-bigroupoids of type II. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.2: Let G be a bigroupoid. A fuzzy subset µ of G is said to be a 
Smarandache  fuzzy  sub-bigroupoid  II  (S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid II)  of  G  if there 
existsη < µ such that η is a fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of G. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.1:  Every  S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid µ of a bigroupoid G = G1 ∪ G2 is a 
S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid of type II.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions. 
 
It is left for the reader to verify whether a S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid II, µ of G is a          
S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid of G or will µ be a S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid II of G will imply 
G is a S-bigroupoid. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.3: Let (T, +, y) be a S-biquasi group. i.e. (T, +) is a S-semigroup and 
(T, y) is a semigroup. A fuzzy subset µ: T → [0, 1] is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy 
sub-biquasi group (S-fuzzy sub-biquasi group) if µ : (T, +) → [0, 1] is a fuzzy 
subsemigroup and µ : (T, y) →[0, 1] is a fuzzy subsemigroup. (Recall the set (T, +, y) 
is a Smarandache biquasi group (S-biquasi group) if (T, +) is a S-semigroup and      
(T, y) is just a semigroup). 
 
We proceed on to define type II Smarandache sub-biquasi group. 
 

 
277
DEFINITION 3.3.4: Let (X, +, y) be a biquasi group. A fuzzy subset µ of X is said to be 
a Smarandache fuzzy sub-biquasi group of type II (S-fuzzy sub-biquasi group of type 
II) of X if µ : (X, +) → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup and µ : (X, y) → [0, 1] is a 
fuzzy subsemigroup of X. 
 
Thus we have the following result, which is direct by the very definitions. 
 
THEOREM 3.3.2: Let (T, +, y) be a S-biquasi group. Let µ: T → [0, 1] be a S-fuzzy 
sub-biquasi group then µ is a S-fuzzy sub-biquasi group of type II.  
 
But if µ : T → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy sub-biquasi group of type II, will µ be a S-fuzzy 
sub-biquasi group?  
 
This problem is left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
The applications of S-fuzzy bigroupoids will be dealt in the chapter VII. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.5: Let X1 and X2 be two bigroupoids. Let µ1 and µ2 be S-fuzzy sub-
bigroupoids of X1 and X2 respectively with respect to a t-norm T. The S-fuzzy sub-
bigroupoids µ1 and µ2 are homomorphic if and only if there exists a S-groupoid 
homomorphism (isomorphism) φ : X1 → X2  such that µ1 = µ2 o φ. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.6:  Let  (X  =  X1  ∪  X2, +, y)  be  a  S-bigroupoid. A fuzzy subset λ = 
λ1 ∪ λ2 of X is called a Smarandache fuzzy bi-ideal (S-fuzzy bi-ideal) of X if 
 
λ1 (x, y) ≥ max {λ1 (x), λ1 (y)} for all x, y ∈ P1 ⊂ X1 ; P1 relative to which λ1 is defined 
and λ2 (x, y) ≥ max {λ2 (x), λ2 (y)} for all x, y ∈ P2 ⊂ X2; P2 relative to which λ2 is 
defined. 
 
A S-fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1  ∪  µ2  of  X  = X1  ∪  X2  is  called  prime  if  for  any  two 
S-fuzzy bi-ideals λ and δ of X, λδ ≤ µ ⇒ λ ≤ µ or δ ≤ µ. Let µ be a S-fuzzy bi-ideal of 
S. The Smarandache fuzzy biradical (S-fuzzy biradical) of µ denoted by S(birad µ) =

A S-fuzzy bi-ideal  µ  =  µ1  ∪  µ2  of  X  =  X1 ∪ X2 is called Smarandache primary 
(S-primary)  if   for  any  two  S-fuzzy  bi-ideals  δ  , λ of X.  δ λ  ≤  µ  ⇒ δ  ≤  µ  or     
λ ≤ S(birad µ). A S-fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of X = X1 ∪ X2 is called Smarandache 
maximal (S-maximal) if there does not exist any proper S-fuzzy bi-ideal λ of X such 
that µ < λ . 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.7: Let X be a S-bigroupoid, X is called a Smarandache multiplication 
bigroupoid (S-multiplication bigroupoid) if for any two S-fuzzy bi-ideals µ and δ  of X 
satisfying µ ≤ δ there exists a S-fuzzy bi-ideal λ of X such that µ = δ λ . 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.8: A S-fuzzy bi-ideal of the form xr χX  where xr is a fuzzy point of X is 
called the Smarandache fuzzy bi-ideal (S-fuzzy bi-ideal) of X. A S-bigroupoid X is said 

 
278
to  be  a  S-fuzzy principal bi-ideal bigroupoid  if  every  S-fuzzy  bi-ideal  of  X  is  a 
S-principal fuzzy bi-ideal .  
 
We proceed on to define Smarandache function generated in case of S-bigroupoids. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.9: Let (X, +, y) be a S-bigroupoid and let Y be a fixed S-bigroupoid 
of X. Let (Ω , A , P) be a probability space and let (F, ~) be a S-bigroupoid of 
functions mapping Ω into X with ~ defined by pointwise multiplication in the range 
space. A further restriction is placed on F by assuming that for each f ∈ F, Xf  = {ω ∈ 
Ω f(ω) ∈ Y} is an element of A . 
 
Then ν : F→ [0, 1] defined by ν (f) = P(Xf ) for each f in F is a S-fuzzy sub-
bigroupoid of F with respect to Tm. A S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid obtained in this manner 
is called the Smarandache function generated (S-function generated). 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.10: Given a S-bigroupoid (X = X1 ∪ X2, +, y) a t-norm T and a set I, 
for each i ∈ I and let µI  be a S-fuzzy sub-bigroupoid of X with respect to T define.

For notations about fuzzy regular and inverse subsemigroups please refer [34] we will 
be adopting these notions and notations in S-bigroupoids as S-bigroupoids contain 
proper subset which is a bisemigroup. Using the concept of fuzzy relation ρ on a 
semigroup S given by [117]. We develop the concept of Smarandache bifuzzy 
relation.  
 
DEFINITION 3.3.15: Let X = X1 ∪ X2 be a S-bigroupoid. A Smarandache bifuzzy 
relation (S-bifuzzy relation) ρ = ρ1 ∪ ρ2 on a S-bigroupoid X is one for which ρ1  is a 
fuzzy relation on P1 ⊂ X1; where P1 is a semigroup and ρ2 is a fuzzy relation on P2 ⊂ 
X2 where P2 is a semigroup. A S-bifuzzy relation ρ = ρ1 ∪ ρ2 on a S-bigroupoid X = 
X1 ∪ X2 is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy C-bicongruence relation (S-fuzzy C-
bicongruence relation) on X if M(ρ1 (x1 , y1 ), ρ (z1 , ω1 )) ≤ ρ1 (x1 z1 , y1 ω1 ) for all x1 , 
y1 , z1 , ω1  ∈ P1  ⊂  X1 (P1 semigroup of X1 ) and M(ρ2 (x2 , y2 ), ρ2 (z2 , ω2 )) ≤ ρ2 (x2 , 
z2, y2 , ω2 ) for all x2 ,  z2 , y2  , ω2 ∈  P2  ⊂  X2 . 
 
A S-bifuzzy relation ρ = ρ1  ∪ ρ2  on a S-bigroupoid  X  =  X1  ∪  X2  is  said  to  be  a 
S-fuzzy left (resp. right) bicompatible if for all x1, y1, s1 ∈ X1 and x2, y2, s2 ∈ X2 we 
have ρ1 (s1 x1 , s1 y1 ) (resp. ρ1 (x1 s1 , y1 s1 )) ≥ ρ1 (x1 , y1 ) and ρ2 (s2 x2 , s2 y2 ) (resp. 
ρ2(x2 s2, y2 s2)) ≥ ρ2 (x2 , y2 ). 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.16: Let X = X1 ∪ X2 be a S-bigroupoid such that X is a S-regular 
bigroupoid (i., e. X1  has a proper subset R1 which is a regular semigroup and X2  has 
a proper subset R2 which is a regular semigroup). 
 
A  S-fuzzy  sub-bigroupoid  λ  of  X  is  called  a  S-fuzzy  regular sub-bigroupoid if 
for all x1 ∈ R1 ⊂ X1 and x2 ∈ R2 ⊂ X2 there exists x'1, x'2 ∈ Tx where Tx = {x'1  ∈ R1 ⊂ 
X1 | x1 x'1 x1 = x1} ∪ {x'2∈ R2 ⊂ X2 | x1 x'2x1 = x1} (for all x1 ∈ R1 and for all x2 ∈ R2) 
such that (x1, t) ∈a λ1 ⇒ (x'1, t) ∈a∨ q(a , b) λ1 and (x2, t) ∈a λ2 ⇒ (x'2, t) ∈a ∨ q(a , b) λ2 
for all t ∈ (a, c]. 
 
Several results in this direction can be had in an analogous way. We suggest some 
problems in section 3.4. We just define Smarandache fuzzy prime bi-ideal of a S-

 
280
bigroupoid X; Smarandache fuzzy quasi prime bi-ideal of a S-bigroupoid and 
Smarandache fuzzy weakly quasi prime bi-ideal of a S-bigroupoid X. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.17: Let X = X1 ∪ X2 be a S-bigroupoid, a S-fuzzy left bi-ideal f is 
called  Smarandache  prime  (S-prime)  if  for  any  two S-fuzzy  bi-ideals  f1  and  f2 , 
f1  o  f2 ⊂  f implies f1  ⊂  f  or  f2 ⊂  f. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.18: Let X = X1 ∪ X2 be a S-bigroupoid. A S-fuzzy left bi-ideal f of X is 
called Smarandache quasi prime (S-quasi prime) if for any two S-fuzzy left bi-ideals f1 
and f2 , f1 o f2  ⊆  f  implies f1  ⊆  f  or  f2  ⊂  f ;  f is called Smarandache quasi-semi 
prime (S-quasi semiprime) if for any S-fuzzy left bi-ideal g of X; g2 ⊆  f implies g ⊆  f. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.19: Let X be a S-bigroupoid. A S-fuzzy left bi-ideal f is called 
Smarandache weakly quasi prime (S-weakly quasi prime) if for any two S-fuzzy left 
bi-ideals f1  and  f2   such that f ⊆  f1, f ⊆  f2 and f1  o f2  ⊆  f then f1  ⊆  f or f2  ⊆  f. 
 
Several important results in this direction can be obtained by using [133, 128]. We 
have given some problems for any researcher to tackle; as the book is for researchers 
to work more on Smarandache notions we restrain ourselves by giving elaborate 
proofs. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache biloops. Several properties related to 
bigroups can be easily formulated and obtained we define certain concepts about these 
new structures like S-bitale, S-bitip and S-penultimate biloops and give some results 
about them. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.20:  Let  (L, +, y)  be  a  biloop. We  call  L  a  Smarandache  biloop 
(S-biloop) if L has a proper subset P which is a bigroup. 
 
Now we define Smarandache fuzzy sub-biloop of a biloop L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.21: Let (L, +, y) be a S-biloop. We call µ : L → [0, 1] a 
Smarandache fuzzy sub-biloop (S-fuzzy sub-biloop) of L if µ related to the sub-
bigroup P in L, is a fuzzy bigroup i.e. for µP  : P → [0, 1]  is  a fuzzy sub-bigroup 
where µP denotes the restriction of µ to P. 
 
This S-fuzzy sub-biloop of L we call as type I but by default of notation we just call 
the biloop L as S-fuzzy sub-biloop of L. We now proceed on to give the Smarandache 
fuzzy sub-biloop of type II. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.22: Let L be a biloop. We call µ a Smarandache fuzzy sub-biloop of 
type II (S-fuzzy sub-biloop of type II) if the fuzzy subset µ of L is such that exists a 
fuzzy subset η of L with η < µ and η is a Smarandache fuzzy sub-bigroup of L. That is 
η on a fuzzy subset of L where η is a fuzzy sub-bigroup of L.  
 
We are requesting the reader to find relations between S-fuzzy sub-biloops of type I 
and type II. 
 

 
281
DEFINITION 3.3.23: Let (L = L1 ∪ L2 , +, y) be a S-biloop. Two S-fuzzy sub-biloops η 
and µ of the S-biloop L are said to be Smarandache equivalent (S-equivalent) denoted 
by µ ≈ η if both µ and η have the same S-chain of level subgroups. (If µ is a S-fuzzy 
sub-biloop of the S-biloop X; µt  for  each  t ∈ [0, µ (e)]  (e1  –  identity element of      
P1 ⊂ X1, P1 a subgroup of X1 relative to µ1 ; P2 is a subgroup of x2 where e2 is the 
identity  element  of  P2  ⊂  X2  relative  to  µ2  where µ = µ1  ∪  µ2 ), here  µ(e)  =     
µ1 (e1 ) ∪ µ1 (e2 ) is a S-sub-biloop of the given S- biloop L called the Smarandache 
level sub-biloop (S-level sub-biloop) of µ. The set of all S-level sub-biloop of a S-fuzzy 
sub-biloop forms a chain. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.24: Two S-fuzzy subloops η  and  µ of a S-biloop  L  are  said  to  be 
S-equivalent denoted by µ 
B≈η if µ and η have the same chain of S-level subloops. Let 
µ  be  a  fuzzy  subset  of  a  S-biloop  L. Then  the  Smarandache  penultimate            
(S-penultimate) subset SP (µ) of µ in L defined by 
 
SP (µ) = {x ∈ B ⊂ L µ (x) > inf µ} (B ⊂ L is a sub-bigroup in the biloop L). In case 
µ is a S-fuzzy sub-biloop of a S-biloop L then SP (µ) is a S-sub-biloop of L provided µ 
is non -constant and SP (µ) is called the S-penultimate sub-biloop of µ in L. 
 
Now we define yet another interesting property about S-biloop L. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.25: Let η and µ be S-fuzzy sub-biloops of a loop L. Then η is said to 
be obtained by a Smarandache shift (S- shift) of the range set Im µ if there exists a 
one to one order preserving map φ from Im µ onto Imη such that η = φ o µ where ‘o’ 
is the composition of mappings. 
 
DEFINITION 3.3.26:  Let  L  be  a  S-biloop, µ  be  a S-fuzzy sub-biloop of L. i.e. µ = 
µ1  ∪  µ2 : L1 ∪ L2 → [0, 1] is a map, that µI restricted to a subgroup Pi in Li is such 
that  
 
µi (xiyi) ≥ min {µI (xi), µI (yi)}, xi, yi ∈ Pi ⊂ Li (i = 1, 2) 
µI (

CHAPTER FOUR 
 
SMARANDACHE FUZZY RINGS AND  
NON-ASSOCIATIVE RINGS 
 
In this chapter we introduce the notion of Smarandache fuzzy rings and Smarandache-
fuzzy non-associative rings. This chapter has five sections. In the first section we 
introduce the concept of Smarandache fuzzy rings exhibited in 38 definitions and 
thirty theorems. In section two the notion of Smarandache fuzzy vector spaces are 
defined. Section three deals with Smarandache fuzzy non-associative rings. Section 
four deals with Smarandache fuzzy birings and several of its properties are defined 
and studied. In section five we have given 125 problems for the researcher. As this 
book is a research book we propose more problems. 
 
 
4.1  Smarandache fuzzy rings definitions and properties 
 
In this section we introduce the notion of Smarandache fuzzy rings. The study fuzzy 
rings [36, 37, 40, 109] is itself recent and still recent is the study of Smarandache 
rings [132]. So in this section for the first time we introduce the notion of 
Smarandache fuzzy rings. Here we give several examples and give some important 
properties about them.

Smarandache fuzzy ring (S-fuzzy ring) relative to a subset P of R where P is a field if 
µ: P → [0, 1] is such that  
 
µ (x – y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ(y)} 
µ (xy–1) ≥ min {µ (x), µ(y)} 
y ≠ 0 for all x, y ∈ P. 
 
This S-fuzzy ring will be called as type I; S-fuzzy ring. The condition of S-fuzzy ring I 
can be still tightened. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.2: Let R be a S-ring. Let µ: R → [0, 1] be a fuzzy subset of R. If µ is 
such that every proper subset Pi ⊂ R say i = 1, 2, …, n where Pi is a subfield of R; we 
have µ: Pi → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subfield of R for every Pi (i = 1, 2, …, n) then we call µ 
a Smarandache fuzzy strong ring of type I (S- fuzzy strong ring of type I). 
 
THEOREM 4.1.1: Every S-fuzzy strong ring of type I is a S-fuzzy ring of type I. 
 
Proof: Direct by definitions, the converse is not true. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.2: A S-fuzzy ring of type I need in general be a S-fuzzy strong ring of 
type I. 
 
Proof: We prove this by an example. Let Z6 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be a S-ring. P = {0, 2, 
4} is a subset of Z6 which is a field. 

 
292
 
Define µ : Z6 → [0, 1]. By

Clearly µ restricted to P is a S-fuzzy ring I which is not S-fuzzy strong ring I as µ on 
the set P1 = {0, 3} which is a field in Z6 and µ is trivial on P1. Hence the claim. 
 
We define Smarandache fuzzy ring of type II. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.3: Let R be any ring µ: R → [0, 1] be a fuzzy subset of R. We say µ is 
a Smarandache fuzzy subring of type II (S-fuzzy subring of type II) if there exist a 
fuzzy subset σ on R such that σ ⊂ µ and σ: R → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subfield of R. If for a 
given µ on a ring R no such σ exists such thatσ ⊂ µ we say µ is a Smarandache non-
fuzzy subring (S-non-fuzzy subring). 
 
Even if σ ⊂ µ is a fuzzy subring of R still we call µ only a S-non-fuzzy ring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.4: Let R be a S-ring. A fuzzy subset µ of the ring R is called a 
Smarandache fuzzy ideal (S-fuzzy ideal) of R if the following conditions are true  
 
i. 
R has a proper subset X such that  
µ (x – y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ(y)} 
µ (xy) ≥ max {µ (x), µ(y)} for all x, y ∈ X. i.e. µ on x is a fuzzy ideal. 
 
ii. 
X contains a proper subset P such that P is a field under the operations of 
R and µ: P → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subfield. 
 
Example 4.1.1: Let Z12 = {0, 1, 2, …, 11} be a S-ring under multiplication and 
addition modulo 12. 
 
X = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, µ : Z12 → [0, 1]

DEFINITION 4.1.5: A S-fuzzy ideal µ of a ring R a Smarandache fuzzy prime (S-fuzzy 
prime) if σ and θ are S-fuzzy ideals of R the condition σ θ ⊆ µ implies either σ ⊂ µ or 
θ ⊂ µ. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache level subring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.6: Let µ be a S-fuzzy subring of a S-ring R; t ∈ [0, 1] and t ≤ µ(0). 
The S-fuzzy subring (ideal) µt is called a Smarandache level subring (S-level subring) 
of µ. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.7: Let µ by any fuzzy subset of a ring R. The smallest S-fuzzy ideal of 
R containing µ is called the S-fuzzy ideal generated by µ and is denoted by 〈µ〉. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.3: Let µ be any fuzzy subset of a S-ring R. Then 〈χµ 〉 = χ〈 µ 〉.. 
 
Proof: Left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.8: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a S-ring R. Then the fuzzy subset µ* of R 
defined by µ* (x) = sup{k | x ∈ 〈µk 〉 } is a S-fuzzy ideal generated by µ in R according 
as 〈µk 〉  is a S-fuzzy ideal generated by µk  in R. i.e. µ*(x) = t whenever x ∈ 〈 µt 〉  and 
x ∉ 〈 µs 〉  for all s > t. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.9: Let µ be any S-fuzzy ideal of a S-ring R. The fuzzy subset 
*
x
µ  of R 
where x ∈ P ⊂ R (P a subfield of R) is defined by 
*
x
µ (r) = µ(r – x) for all r ∈ R, is 
termed as the Smarandache fuzzy coset (S-fuzzy coset) determined by x and µ. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.10:  A  fuzzy  subset  λ  of  a  S-ring R  is  said  to be an Smarandache 
(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy subring (S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy subring) of R if for all x, y ∈ P ⊂  R (P is a

ii. xt ∈ λ ⇒ (–x)t ∈∨ qλ .  
iii. xt, yr ∈ λ ⇒ (x y)M ( t , r) ∈∨ qλ .  
 
THEOREM 4.1.4: A fuzzy subset λ of a S-ring R is an S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy subring of R if 
and only if λ(x – y), λ (xy) ≥ M (λ(x), λ(y), 0.5) for all x, y ∈ X ⊂ R, X a proper subset 
of R. which is a field.

(Just we once again recall the notation a fuzzy point, xt is said to belong to (resp be 
quasi coincident with) a fuzzy set λ written as xt ∈∨λ (resp xt q λ) if λ (x) ≥ t (resp. 
λ(x) + t > 1), xt ∈λ or xt q λ will denoted by xt ∈∨ qλ) [25].  
 
In view of these definition the reader is expected to prove. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.5: A fuzzy subset λ of a S-ring R is an (∈, ∈∨ q)-fuzzy ideal of a S-ring 
R if and only if  
 
i. 
λ (x – y) ≥ M (λ (x) , λ(y), 0.5).

(X a proper S-subring of R i.e. X contains a subfield as a proper subset).

The following three theorems are left as an exercise for the reader. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.6: A fuzzy subset λ of a S-ring R is a S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy subring (ideal) 
of R if and only if λt is a S-subring (S-ideal) of R for all t ∈ (0, 0.5]. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.7: A S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy ideal of R is S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy prime if and only 
if Max {λ (x), λ (y)} ≥   M (λ(xy), 0.5)  for  all  x , y ∈ X  ⊂  R. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.8: A S-fuzzy ideal λ of a S-ring R is a S-(∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy semiprime (or 
S-prime or S-semiprimary or S-primary) if and only if λt is S-semiprime (or S-prime 
or S-semiprimary or S-primary) for all 0 <  t  ≤  0.5.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache (∈,∈∨q) fuzzy radical of λ. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.13: Let λ be an S- (∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy ideal of R. The fuzzy subset Rad λ 
of R is defined by

is called the Smarandache (∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy radical (S-(∈,∈∨ q) fuzzy radical) of λ.  
 
Using the definitions and results of [23] the reader is expected to prove. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.9: Let λ be an S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy ideal of the S-ring R. Then 
 
i. 
S Rad λ is an S-(∈, ∈∨ q) fuzzy ideal of R . 
ii. 
If λ has the sup-property then S Rad λt = (S Rad λ)t for all 0 < t ≤ 
0.5. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.14:  The  subset  λ t =  {x ∈ X  |  λ(x)  ≥  t or λ (x) + t > 1} = {x ∈ X, 
xt ∈∨ qλ} is called (∈∨ q)-level subset of X determined by λ and t. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.15: A Smarandache L-fuzzy ring (S-L fuzzy ring) is a function              
µ : R → L, L a distribution lattice where (R, +, y) is a S-ring that satisfies, 
 
i. 
µ ≡/  0. 
ii. 
µ(x – y) ≥  µ(x)∧ µ(y) for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R   
(P a subfield relative to which µ is defined). 
iii. 
µ (xy) ≥ µ (x) ∧ µ (y) for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R. 
iv. 
If R is unitary then µ(1) = µ(0). 
 
S (µ) is a S-subring of R where µS denotes the restriction of µ to S(µ). Let µ : R → L 
and µ' : R' → L are S-L-fuzzy ring (R and R' S-ring). 
 
A  Smarandache  homomorphism  between  µ  and  µ'  is  a  S-ring  homomorphism    
f : R → R' that satisfies µ' (f(x)) = µ(x) for all x in P ⊂ R (P is a subfield relative to 
which µ is defined )i.e. f –1(µ') = µ .  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.16:  A  Smarandache  L-fuzzy  subring  ( S-L-fuzzy  subring )  of  a   
S-L-fuzzy ring; µ is a S-fuzzy ring µ' : R → L (R a S-ring) satisfying µ'(x) ≤ µ(x) for 
all x ∈ P ⊂ R (where µ is defined relative to the subfield P in R). 
 
For µ' a S-fuzzy subring of the S-L-fuzzy ring µ with L totally ordered. We shall call 
µ' the restriction of µ' to S(µ). It can be easily proved µ' |S  is a S-fuzzy subring of µS. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.17: Let µ: R → L be a S-L-fuzzy ring. A Smarandache L-fuzzy ideal 
(S-L-fuzzy ideal) of µ is a map δ : R → L such that the following properties hold. 
 
i. 
δ ≡/  0. 
ii. 
δ (xy) ≥ δ (x) ∧ δ (y) for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R . 
iii. 
δ(xy) ≥ µ (x) ∧ δ (y) for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R . 
iv. 
δ (x) ≤ µ (x)for every x∈ P ⊂ R . 
 
(P is the subfield relative to which the S-L fuzzy ring µ is defined). 

 
296
 
As in case of S-L-fuzzy subring, for δ a S-L-fuzzy ideal of the S-L-fuzzy ring µ with L 
totally ordered, δS the restriction of δ to S (µ). It holds that δS is a S-L-fuzzy ideal 
of µS where S(µ) is a S-subring of R, µS denotes the restriction of µ to S(µ).  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.18: Let µ be a fuzzy subset and t ∈ L. The t-level cut µt will be {x ∈ R 
| µ(x) ≥ t} and the Smarandache t-level cut (S-t-level cut) Sµt will be {x ∈ P ⊂ R | µ(x) 
≥  t; P  is  the  subfield of the S-ring R relative to which µ is defined} Analogously the 
t-level  strong  cut  will  be  {x ∈ R | µ (x) > t}  and Smarandache t-level strong cut 
(S-t-level strong cut) Sµt will be {x ∈ P ⊂ Rµ (x) > t – P defined above} and finally 
µ0 will stand for {x ∈ Rµ(x) = µ (0)} and Sµ0 = {x ∈ P ⊂ Rµ (x) = µ(0), ‘0’ the 
additive identity of P}. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.19: Let S be a δ-L-fuzzy ideal of µ. We define Smarandache fuzzy 
quotient ring  ( S-fuzzy  quotient  ring )   µ / s  δ  / s  as   µ / sδ / s : S (µ)α → L 
with µ / s δ /s (x + α) = µ (x) where α is the S-ideal of S(µ), S-maximal among those 
contained in Sδ 0 ∩ Sµ0. 
 
Now the notion of Smarandache prime L-fuzzy ideals is defined. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.20: A S-L-fuzzy ideal δ of a S-L-fuzzy ring µ is said to Smarandache 
prime (or Smarandache L-prime) if δ  ≡/   1 and it satisfies δ(xy) ∧ µ(x) ∧ µ(y) < δ(x) 
∨ δ(y) for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R (P a subfield of R relative to which µ is defined). 
 
Clearly if µ ≡/  1 then we have δ (xy) ≤ δ (x) ∨ δ (y) for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R. Further a 
S-L-fuzzy ideal δ of a S-L-fuzzy ring R is S-L-prime if for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R, δ(xy) = 
δ(0) implies δ(x) = δ(0) or δ(y) = δ(0). We see if L is totally ordered then it is evident 
that δ(xy) ≤ δ(x) ∨ δ(y) implies δ (xy) = δ (o) implies δ (x) = δ (0) or δ (y) = δ (0).  
 
A Smarandache strongly prime L-fuzzy ideal (S-strongly prime L-fuzzy ideal) is 
defined as a non-constant S-fuzzy ideal δ of a S-ring µ that satisfies δ(xy) = δ(x) or 
δ(xy) = δ(y) for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ R. 
 
A Smarandache weakly completely fuzzy prime ideal (S-weakly completely fuzzy 
prime ideal) is defined when L = [0, 1] as a non constant S-fuzzy ideal δ of R that 
satisfies δ (xy) = max {δ (x) , δ (y)} for every x, y ∈ P ⊂ R. (P is a subfield relative to 
which δ  is defined). 
 
Note: This notion can be easily generalized to the case in which we have as arbitrary 
lattice L, changing maximum by supremum. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.21: A S-fuzzy ring µ is said to an Smarandache fuzzy integral domain 
(S-fuzzy integral domain) if x, y = 0 and µ(x) ∧ µ(y) > 0 implies x = 0 or y = 0, x, y ∈ 
P ⊂ R (P is the subfield of the S-ring R relative to which µ is defined). 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.22: Let δ be a S-L-fuzzy ideal of a S-L-fuzzy ring µ. The 
Smarandache L-fuzzy radical (S-L-fuzzy radical) of δ is the fuzzy subset of R defined

The following theorems are left as exercises for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.10: Let δ  be a S-L-fuzzy ideal of µ. Then Sr(δ ) is S-L-fuzzy ideal of µ. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.11: Let δ  be a S-L-fuzzy ideal of a S-L-fuzzy ring µ. Then Sr (r(δ )) = 
Sr(δ ). 
 
THEOREM 4.1.12: Let δ  be a S-prime L-fuzzy ideal of µ then Sr (δ ) = δ. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.13: Let δ  be a S-L-fuzzy ideal of µ then δ  ⊆  Sr(δ ).

If δ1  ⊆ δ2 then Sr (δ1 ) ⊂ Sr(δ2 ).

Now we proceed on to define Smarandache-primary L-fuzzy ideals. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.23:  A  S-L-fuzzy ideal  δ  is said  to  be  Smarandache  L-primary  
(S-L-primary) if δ (xy) ∧ µ(x) ∧ µ(y) ≤ δ (x) ∨ ({
N
n∈∨ δ (yn)} for all x, y ∈ X ⊂ R (X a 
proper subset of R which has a proper subset which is a subfield relative to which δ  
is defined). 
 
In case L is a totally order set i.e. L = [0, 1] then we have S-L-primary will coincide 
with the notion of S-primary. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.24: A S-fuzzy ideal λ of a S-ring R is called  
 
i. 
Smarandache semiprime (S-semiprime) if λ(x2) = λ(x) for all x ∈ P ⊂ R    
(P is a subfield of R relative to which λ is defined).

Smarandache prime (S-prime) if λ(xy) = λ(x) or λ(xy) = λ(y) for all x, y ∈ 
P ⊂ R . 
 
iii. 
Smarandache semiprimary (S-semiprimary) if for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ R,           
λ(xy) ≤ λ(xn ) for some positive integer n or λ(xy) ≤ λ(yn) for some positive 
integer n.

Smarandache primary (S-primary) if for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ R, λ(xy) = λ(x) or 
λ(yn) for some positive integer n.

v. 
Maximal if the level S-ideal { x ∈ P ⊂ Rλ (x) = 1} is maximal.  
 
DEFINITION 4.1.25: Let λ be a S-fuzzy ideal of a S-ring R. The fuzzy subset S rad λ of 
R defined by S(Rad λ) (x) = sup {λ (xn) | n > 0} is called Smarandache fuzzy radical 
(S-fuzzy radical) of λ . 
 
Several inter-relations between S-fuzzy prime, S-fuzzy primary, S-fuzzy semiprimary 
etc can be obtained as a matter of routine as in of fuzzy rings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.26: A S-fuzzy ideal µ of a S-ring R is called Smarandache fuzzy 
irreducible (S-fuzzy irreducible) if it is not a finite intersection of two S-fuzzy ideals of 
R properly containing µ. If S-fuzzy ideal µ of a S-ring R is called Smarandache fuzzy 
weakly irreducible (S-fuzzy weakly irreducible) if  it  not  a  finite  intersection  of  a 
S-fuzzy ideal and a fuzzy ideal of R properly containing µ otherwise µ is termed as 
Smarandache fuzzy reducible (S-fuzzy reducible). 
 
THEOREM 4.1.15: If µ is any S-fuzzy prime ideal of a S-ring R, then µ is S-fuzzy 
irreducible. 
 
Proof: Straightforward as in case of fuzzy prime ideals.  
 
It is left for the reader as an exercise to prove the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.16: Let µ be a S-fuzzy ideal of a S-ring R. If for some x, y ∈ P ⊂ R (P is 
the subfield relative to which µ is defined) µ(x) < µ (y) then µ (x– y) = µ(x) = µ(y – x). 
 
Just for the sake of completeness we recall the definition of coset of a fuzzy ideal and 
its Smarandache analogue. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.27: Let J: R → [0, 1] be a S-fuzzy ideal where R is a S-ring . The 
fuzzy subset x + J : R → L = [0, 1] defined by (x + J)y = J(y – x) is called a 
Smarandache coset of the S-fuzzy ideal (S-coset of the S-fuzzy ideal) J. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.17: If J : R → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy ideal ,then x + J = y + J if and only if 
J(x – y) = J(0) . In that case J(x) = J(y). 
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy ideal. Hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.18: Every  S-coset  of  a  fuzzy  ideal  J : R → [0, 1] is constant on 
every S-coset of a (non-fuzzy) ideal RJ of R. More specifically x + J (z) = J(y – x) for 
all z ∈ y + RJ. In particular x + J (z) = J (x) for all x ∈ RJ . 
 
Proof: As in case of fuzzy ideals the proof is straightforward. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.28: The ring R/J of the S-cosets of the S-fuzzy ideal J is called the 
Smarandache factor ring (S-factor ring) or the Smarandache quotient ring (S-quotient 
ring) of R by J.  
 

 
299
Let SF denote the set of all Smarandache fuzzy ideals of a S-ring R. 
 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.29:  Let  A  ∈  SF.  A  representation  of  A  is  a  finite  intersection  
A = Q1 ∩ Q2 ∩ … ∩ Qn of S-fuzzy primary ideals of R is called a Smarandache fuzzy 
primary representation (S-fuzzy primary representation) of A. If is called irredundant

and the Qi have distinct S-radicals, i = 1, 2, …, n.   
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy prime ideal divisor of A. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.30: Let µ ∈ SF. A S-fuzzy prime ideal σ of R is called a Smarandache 
fuzzy prime ideal divisor (S-fuzzy prime ideal divisor) of µ if σ ⊇ µ and σ∗ ⊇ µ∗.  
 
A Smarandache fuzzy prime ideal divisor σ  of µ is called minimal or isolated if there 
does not exist a S-fuzzy prime ideal divisor σ' of µ such that σ ' ⊆ σ and σ ' ≠ σ. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.31: Let µ be a S-fuzzy subring of a S-ring R. We say that µ is a 
Smarandache fuzzy quasi-local subring (S-fuzzy quasi-local subring) of R if and only 
if for all x ∈ R and for all y ∈ R such that y is a unit. 
 
µ(xy –1) ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)} or equivalently µ(y) = µ(y –1). 
 
The following theorem is straightforward hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.19: Let R be a S-quasi local ring. If µ is a S-fuzzy quasi local subring 
of R, then for all t such that 0 ≤ t ≤ µ (1). µt is a S-quasi local ring and M ∩ µt is the 
unique maximal ideal of µt. (M denotes a unique S-maximal ideal of R). 
 
Proof: µt is a S-fuzzy subring of R. Using µ is S-quasi local µ(x) = µ(x–1) leading to  
x–1 ∈ µt. 
 
Notation: For the sake of completeness we recall that µ* = {x ∈ P ⊂ R µ (x) > 0}is a 
S-subring of the S-ring R. Let R be a non empty subset of a set S and let A be a fuzzy 
subset of R. If B is an extension of A to a fuzzy subset of S, then At ∩ Bs = As for all 
s, t such that 0 ≤ t ≤ s ≤ 1.  A  is  an  extension  to  a  fuzzy  subset  Ae  of  S  such  
that (Ae)t  ⊇ Bt for all t ∈ Im (A). 
 
Ae(y)  =  sup {t y ∈ Bt}  where  Bt  ∈  B  =  {Bt  t ∈ Im (A)},  Ae(y)  =                
max {m y ∈ Bm}. 
 
Let I be an ideal of a ring R, S be a subring of R. Ie denotes the ideal of S generated by 
I. If A is a fuzzy ideal of R; S a subring of R, such that A has sup property. If

and for all s, t ∈ Im (A) , s ≥ t. At ∩ (As)e = As then A has a unique extension to a 
fuzzy ideal Ae of S such that (Ae)t = (At)e for all t ∈ Im (A) and Im (Ae) = Im (A). 
 
Further Ae(xy–1) ≥ min {Ae(x), Ae(y)} if and only if for all  s, t ∈ Im (A) , s ≥ t.

DEFINITION 4.1.32: Let A and B be fuzzy subsets of R and T respectively. Define the 
fuzzy subsets f (A) of T and f–1(B) of R by f(A) (y) = Sup {A(x) | f(x) = y} for all y ∈ T. 
f –1(B) (x) = Bf(x)) for all x ∈ R. 
 
DEFINITION 4.1.33: Suppose A and B are S-fuzzy ideals of R and T respectively. Then 
we have f(A) and f –1(B) are S-fuzzy ideals of T and R respectively, with f(A)(0) = A(0), 
f –1 (B)(0) = B(0); where R and S are S-rings, f a S-ring homomorphism of R into S;     
T denotes f (R).  If  I  is  an S-ideal of R , then the ideal f (I) 
e or I e is defined to be the 
S-ideal of S degenerated by f (I) and it is called the Smarandache extended ideal       
(S-extended ideal) or Smarandache extension (S-extension) of I. If J is an S-ideal of S, 
the S-ideal Je = f –1(J) is called the Smarandache contracted ideal (S-contracted ideal) 
or the Smarandache contraction (S-contraction) of J. 
 
The following result is straightforward from the very definitions.

DEFINITION 4.1.34: Let A be a S-fuzzy ideal of S-ring R. A is called Smarandache      
f-invariant (S-f-invariant ideal) if and only if for all x ∈ P ⊂ R, f(x) = f(y) implies A(x) 
= A(y) . (P the subfield relative to which A is defined). 
 
The following theorems are straightforward; hence left for the reader to prove.

such that A has the sup property. If A∗ is a S-prime ideal R, then f (A∗) is a S-prime 
ideal of T. 
 
THEOREM 4.1.23: Let A be a S-f-invariant fuzzy ideal of the S-ring R such that Im (A) 
is finite. 
 
If A∗  is a S-prime ideal of R then f(A∗ ) = f(A)∗.

THEOREM 4.1.24: Let A be an S-f-invariant fuzzy ideal of R. If A is a S-fuzzy prime 
ideal of R then f(A) is a S-fuzzy prime ideal of T. 
 
(Here f : R → S; R and S, S-rings and f is a S-ring homomorphism and f(S) = T).  
 
Several other interesting results in this direction can be obtained using the results of 
[84]. The innovative reader is expected to find several Smarandache analogous of 
these results and prove the above theorems; as the proof of these theorems can be 
done as a matter of routine using mainly the definitions.

Several interesting results in this direction can be obtained by any studious reader. 
Here it is pertinent to mention that the definition of several fuzzy concepts are defined 
in different ways by different researchers hence in this text one may find that we 
would have at many instances recalled those definitions. Also in some places we 
would have recalled the definition it is a pertinent repetition, mainly for easy reading. 
 
Finally we mention that our study is not totally exhaustive about all fuzzy algebraic 
structures. We give here only those fuzzy algebraic structures for which we are in a 
position to obtain a Smarandache analogue. Every chapter on Smarandache notions 
ends with a set of problems several of them are routine theorems and some of them 
are research problems but an innovative researcher can certainly work on them. 
 
 
4.2. Smarandache Fuzzy vector spaces and its properties 
 
The study of Smarandache fuzzy vector spaces is new as the notion of Smarandache 
vector spaces is meager. A little insight about S-vector spaces can be had from [135]. 
In this section we define S-fuzzy vector spaces and its properties. Nearly 15 
definitions about fuzzy vector spaces are given in this section. 
 
DEFINITION [135]: The Smarandache K-vectorial space (S-K-Vectroial space) is 
defined   to  be  a  S-vectorial space  (A, +, y)  such  that  a  proper  subset  of  A  is  a 
K-algebra (with respect to the same induced operation and another '×' operation 
internal on A where K is a commutative field. 
 
DEFINITION [135]: Let A be a K-vectorial space. A proper subset X of A is said to be 
a  Smarandache  K-vectorial  subspace  (S-K-vectorial subspace) of A if X itself is a 
S-K-vectorial space. 
 
DEFINITION [135]: Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over a field K. Let B = 
{ν1 , …, νn } be a basis of V. We say B is a Smarandache basis (S-basis) of V if B has a 
proper subset say A, A ⊂ B and A ≠ φ , A ≠ B such that A generates a subspace which 

 
304
is  linear  algebra  over  K  that  is  W  is  the  subspace  generated  by  A  then  W 
must be a K-algebra with the same operation of V. 
 
THEOREM [135]: Let A be a K-vectorial space. If A has a S-K-vectorial subspace then 
A is a S-K-vectorial space. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definition. 
 
THEOREM [135]: Let V be a vector space over the field K. If B is a S-basis then B is a 
basis of V. 
 
Proof: Left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
DEFINITION [135]: Let V be a finite dimensional vector space over a field K. Let B = 
{ν1 ,…, νn } be a basis of V. If every proper subset of B generates a linear algebra 
over K then we call B a Smarandache strong basis (S-strong basis) for V. 
 
DEFINITION [135]: Let V be any vector space over the field K. We say L is 
Smarandache finite dimensional vector space (S-finite dimensional vector space) of K 
if every S-basis has only finite number of elements in it. It is interesting to note that if 
L is a finite dimensional vector space then L is a Smarandache finite dimensional 
space (S-finite dimensional space) provided L has a finite S-basis. 
 
THEOREM [135]: Let  V  be  a  vector space over the field K. If A = {ν1 , …, νn } is a 
S-strong basis of V then A is a S-basis of V. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definitions hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.1: Let V be a vector space over a field F and let T be a linear 
operator from V to V. T is said to be a Smarandache linear operator (S-linear 
operator) on V if V has a S-basis which is mapped by T onto another basis V. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.2: Let T be a S-linear operator defined on the space V. A 
characteristic value C in F associated with T is said to be a Smarandache 
characteristic value (S-characteristic value) of T if the characteristic vector of T 
associated  with  C  is  in a  linear  algebra. So  the  eigen  vector  associated  with  
the S-characteristic values will be called a Smarandache eigen vectors (S-eigen 
vectors) or Smarandache characteristic vector (S-characteristic vectors). 
 
As we do not have any book or paper on Smarandache vector spaces except a section 
of it covered by [135] we have just recalled  what is very basic. All other results can 
be carried out as a matter of routine.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy vector spaces. From now onwards 
we take only Smarandache fields. 
 
DEFINITION [135]: A Smarandache field is defined to be a field (A, +, ×) such that a 
proper subset of A is a k-algebra (with respect to the same induced operations and 
external operations). 
 

 
305
But we in the paper [135] fields define differently. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.3: A finite ring (i.e. a ring having finite number of elements) is said to 
be a Smarandache Galois field (S-Galois field) if S contains a proper subset A, A ⊂ S 
such that A is a field under the operations of S.  
 
This definition is partly justified as all finite fields are Galois fields. 
 
Now for us to develop the notion of Smarandache fuzzy vector spaces we make some 
more amendments in the definition of Smarandache vector space. We will call the 
definition of Smarandache vector space given here as the classical definition of 
Smarandache vector space. We define Smarandache vector space in a Smarandache 
style so that lucid expansion of the theory is possible. This Smarandache vector space 
we call it as Smarandache vector space of type II or non classical Smarandache vector 
space. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.4: Let R be a S-ring. We call an additive abelian group V to be a 
Smarandache vector space of type II (S-vector space of type II) over R relative to       
F ⊂ R (where F is a proper subset of R which is a field) if V is a vector space over F. 
 
Thus at the first sight we may have V to be a S-vector space of type II relative to one 
subfield say F ⊂ R; but V may fail to be a S-vector space of type II over some other 
subfield F1 in R. Secondly when will it continue to be S-vector space of type II over all 
subfields in R.  
 
As the definition is very new we are constrained to give some examples of them. 
 
Example 4.2.1: Let Z12 = {0,1, 2,…, 11} be a S-ring. Let V = P [x] where P is the 
field [0, 4, 8]. P [x] is the polynomial ring in the variable x over P = [0, 4, 8]. P[x] is a 
S-vector space of type II over the Z12. 
 
As P[x] is a vector space over P = [0,4, 8] ⊂ Z12. We use this concept of S-vector 
space II to define S-fuzzy vector space. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.5: Let R be a S-ring. V be a S-vector space of type II over R relative 
to P (P ⊂  R). We  call  a  fuzzy  subset  µ  of  V  to  be  a  Smarandache  fuzzy 
vectorspace over the  S-fuzzy  ring  (S-fuzzy vectorspace over the S-fuzzy ring)  σ  of  
R (i.e. σ : R → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subset of R such that σ : P → [0, 1] is a fuzzy field 
where  P  ⊂  R  is a subfield of the S-ring R) if µ(0) > 0 and for all x, y ∈ V and for all 
c ∈ P ⊂ R, µ(x – y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ(y)} and µ(cx) = min {σ (c) , µ(x)}. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.6: Let R be a S-ring having n-subfields in it say P1, …, Pn (i.e.) each 
Pi ⊂ R and Pi is a subfield under the operations of R). Let V be a S-vector space over 
R. If V is a S-vector space over R relative to every subfield Pi in R then we call V the 
Smarandache strong vector space (S-strong vector space) over R.  
 
Thus we have the following straightforward result. 
 

 
306
THEOREM 4.2.1: Let R be a S-ring. If V is a S-strong vector space over R then V is a 
S-vector space over R. 
 
THEOREM 4.2.2: A S-vector space V over a S-ring R in general is not a S-strong 
vector space over R. 
 
Proof: By an example. Consider Z6 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} be the S-ring under addition 
and multiplication modulo 6. Take P1 = {0,3} and P2 = {0, 2, 4}; these are the only 
subfields of Z6. Let V = P1[x]; P1[x] is a S-vector space over P1 but V is not a S-vector 
space over P2. Thus V is not a S-strong vector space. Hence the claim.  
 
On similar lines we can define S-strong fuzzy space. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.7: Let R be a S-ring. V be a S-strong vector space of type II over R. 
We call a fuzzy subset µ of V to be a Smarandache strong fuzzy vector space (S-strong 
fuzzy vector space) over the S-fuzzy ring σi of R; σi: Pi ⊂ R → [0, 1] where Pi ⊂ R are 
subfields for i = 1, 2, …, n if µ(0) > 0 and for all x, y ∈ V and for all c ∈ Pi ⊂ R (i = 
1, 2,…, n), µ(x – y) ≥ min { µ(x),  µ(y)} and µ(cx) = min {σi (c) , µ(x)}, i = 1, 2,…, n. 
 
As in case of S-strong vector spaces we have the following theorem. 
 
THEOREM 4.2.3: Let V be a S-strong fuzzy vector space over the S-ring R. Then V is a 
S-fuzzy vector space over R.. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definitions. 
 
The reader is expected to construct examples and counter examples to study them.  
 
If A and B are fuzzy subset of V then A  ⊆  B means A(x)  ≤  B(x) for all x ∈ V. For 
0  ≤  t  ≤  1, let At = {x ∈ V A(x) ≥ t},  where  V  is  a  S-fuzzy vector space  over 
the  S-ring R. Let ℘ denote the set of all S-fuzzy subfield of a S-ring R. Let A P 
denote the set of all S-fuzzy subspaces of V over P ⊂ R. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.8: Let A, A1,…, An be fuzzy subsets of a S-vector space V and let K be 
a fuzzy subset of the S-ring R. Define Smarandache fuzzy subset A1 +…+ An of V by 
the following, for all x ∈ V. (A1 + …+ An)(x) = sup {min {A1(x1),…, An (xn)} x = x1 + 
…+ xn , xi ∈ V}. Define the fuzzy subset K o A of V by for all x ∈ V, (K o A)(x) = 
sup{min {K(c), A(y)}c ∈ P ⊂ R , y ∈ V, x = cy P is a subfield in R relative to which 
V is defined}. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.9: Let {Ai i ∈ I} be a non empty collection of fuzzy subsets of V, V a 
S-fuzzy subspace of V. Then the fuzzy subset

Let A ∈ A k, K a fuzzy subset of the S-ring R relative to a subfield P ⊂ R. X be a fuzzy 
subset of V such that X ⊂ A. Let 〈 X〉 denote the intersection of all fuzzy subspaces of 

 
307
V (over K) that contain X and are contained in A then 〈X〉 is called the Smarandache 
fuzzy subspace (S-fuzzy subspace) of A fuzzily spanned or generated by X.  
 
We give some more notions and concepts about S-fuzzy vector spaces. Let ξ denote a 
set of fuzzy singletons of V such that xλ, xk ∈ ξ then λ = k > 0. Define the fuzzy subset 
of  X (ξ ) of V by the following for all x ∈ V. X(ξ )(x) = λ if xλ ∈ ξ and X (ξ )(x) = 0 
otherwise. Define 〈ξ 〉 = 〈X (ξ )〉. Let X be a fuzzy subset of V, define ξ (X) = {xλ  x ∈ 
V, λ = X(x) > 0}. 
 
Then X (ξ (X)) = X and ξ (X(ξ )) = ξ. If there are only a finite number of xλ ∈ ξ with  
λ > 0 we call ξ  finite (or Smarandache finite). If X (x) > 0 for only a finite number of 
x ∈ X, we call X finite. Clearly ξ  is finite if and only if X (ξ) is S-finite and X is finite 
if and only if ξ (X) is S-finite. For x ∈ V let X \ {x} denote the fuzzy subset of V defined 
by the following; for all  y  ∈  V.  (X \ {x}) (y) = X(y)  if  y  ≠  x and (X \ {x}) (y) = 0 if 
y = x. Let A ∈ AK (K a fuzzy subset defined relative to a subfield P in a S-ring R) and 
let X be a fuzzy subset of V such that X ⊆ A. Then X is called the Smarandache fuzzy 
system of generators (S-fuzzy system of generators) of A over K if 〈X〉 = A. X is said to 
be Smarandache fuzzy free (S-fuzzy free) over K if for all xλ ⊂  X where λ = X(x),        
xλ  ⊄  〈X \ x〉 . X is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy basis {S-fuzzy basis} for A relative 
to a subfield P ⊂ R, R a S-ring if X is a fuzzy system of generators of A and X is          
S-fuzzy free. Let ξ  denote a set of fuzzy singletons of V such that if  xλ , xk  ∈  ξ  then 
λ = k and xλ ⊆ A. Then ξ is called a Smarandache fuzzy singleton system of 
generators (S-fuzzy singleton system of generators) of A over K if 〈ξ 〉 = A. ξ  is said 
to be S-fuzzy free over K if for all xλ ∈ ξ , xλ ⊄ 〈ξ \{xλ}〉. ξ is said to be a S-fuzzy basis 
of singletons for A if ξ  is a fuzzy singleton system of generators of A and ξ  is S-fuzzy 
free.  
 
Several interesting results in the direction of Smarandache fuzzy free can be obtained 
analogous to results on fuzzy freeness. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy linearly independent over P ⊂ R. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.10: Let R be a S-ring, V be a S-vector space over P ⊂ R (P a field in 
R). Let A ∈ A k, K a fuzzy field of P or K is a S-fuzzy ring R relative to P and let

Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy modules. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.11: The Smarandache R-module (S-R-module) is defined to be an R-
module (A, +, ×) such that a proper subset of A is a S-algebra (with respect to the 
same induced operations and another ‘×’ operations internal on A) where R is a 
commutative unitary S-ring and S its proper subset which is field. 
 

 
308
Example 4.2.2: Let R[x] be the polynomical ring in the variable x with coefficients 
from the real field R. Q[x] is a S-R-module for  it is a S-algebra. 
 
We just recall the definition of Smarandache right (left) module. 
 
DEFINITION 4.2.12: Let R be a S-ring I. A non-empty set B which is an additive 
abelian group is said to be a Smarandache right (left) module I (S-right(left) module 
I) relative to a S-subring I, A if D ⊂ A where D is a field then DB ⊂ B and BD ⊂ B i.e. 
bd (and db) are in B with b(d + c) = bd + dc for all d, c ∈ D and b ∈ B ((d + c)b = 
db + cb). If B is simultaneously a S-right module I and S-left module I over the same 
relative S-subring I then we say B is a Smarandache module I (S-module I).  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.13: Let R be a S-ring II. We say a non-empty set B which is an 
additive abelian group is said to be a Smarandache right (left) module II (S-right 
(left) module II) relative to a S-subring II, A if D ⊂ A where D is a division ring or an 
integral domain, then DB ⊂ B and BD ⊂ B; i.e., bd(and db) are in B. with b(d + c) = 
bd + bc ∀ d, c ∈ D and b ∈ B ((d + c) b = db + cb). If B is simultaneously a S-right 
module II and S-left module II over the same relative S-subring II then we say B is a 
Smarandache module II (S-module II).  
 
DEFINITION 4.2.14: Let (A, +, y) be a S-ring. B be a proper subset of A (B ⊂ A) which 
is a field. A set M is said to be a Smarandache pseudo right (left) module (S-pseudo 
right(left) module)of A related to B if  
 
i. 
(M, +) is an additive abelian group.  
ii. 
For b ∈ B and m ∈ M m.b ∈ M (b.m ∈ M).  
iii. 
(m1 + m2)b = m1b + m2b, (b.(m1+m2)=bm1+bm2) for m1, m2 ∈ M and b ∈ 
B. If M is simultaneously a S-pseudo right module and S-pseudo left module, 
we say M is a Smarandache pseudo module (S-pseudo module) related to B.  
 
Here also we wish to state if M1 is a S-pseudo module related to B, M1 need not be S-
pseudo module related to some other subfield B1 of A. Thus we see we can have 
different S-pseudo modules associated with different subfields in a ring.  
 
Example 4.2.3: Let Z2S4 be the group ring  of the symmetric group of degree 4 over 
the field Z2. M = {0, Σg, g ∈ S4}(Σg denotes the sum of all elements from S4). M is a S-
module II over Z2. M is a S-M-module II over Z2A4. Clearly M is also a S-ideal II and 
S-pseudo ideal of Z2S4.  
 
But to define Smarandache fuzzy module and Smarandache fuzzy algebra we have to 
strike a mediocre between the S-modules and fuzzy modules and S-algebras and fuzzy 
algebras. As the concept of fuzziness involves lots of fuzziness and Smarandache 
property involves adaptability of both richer structure as a substructure or weaker 
structure as a substructure of a richer structure we define Smarandache fuzzy modules 
and Smarandache fuzzy algebras in a very different way. 
 
 

 
309
DEFINITION 4.2.15: Let M be a S-left (or S-right) R-module over a S-ring R. (η, M) is 
called a Smarandache fuzzy left (Smarandache fuzzy right) R-module if there is a map 
η : M → [0, 1] satisfying the following conditions: 
 
i. 
η (a + b) ≥ min {η(a) , η(b)} a, b ∈ M. 
ii. 
η (– a) = η(a) for all a ∈ M. 
iii. 
η (0) = 1 (0 is the zero element of M), 
iv. 
η (ra ) ≥ η (a) (a ∈ M and r ∈ P ⊂ R, P a field) It is denoted by 
P
M
η
 where 
the S-fuzzy module is defined relative to P ⊂ R; P a subfield of R . 
 
η(M) expresses the cardinal number of all fuzzy values η(a) (a ∈ M). We are 
interested in the situation η(V) < + ∝ . It is well known fact that Noetherian modules 
are a large class of modules which play an important role in modular theory. 
 
Several important and interesting results can be obtained in this direction.  
 
 
4.3. Smarandache fuzzy non-associative rings 
 
In this section we introduce the notion of Smarandache fuzzy non associative rings 
and recall the basic notion about Smarandache non associative ring which for short 
we denote as SNA-rings. Lot of information about SNA-rings can be had from [131]. 
  
Throughout this book by a non associative ring (R, +, y) we mean a non empty set R 
endowed with two binary operations ‘+’ and ‘y’ such that (R, +) is an additive abelian 
group with ‘0’ acting as the additive identity and (R, y) is a non associative semigroup 
or a groupoid such that the distributive laws a y (b + c) = a y b + a y c and (a + b) y c = 
a y c + b y c for all a, b, c ∈ R holds true. 
 
Now we recall the definition of Smarandache non-associative ring (SNA-ring). 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.1: Let (R, +, y) be a non-associative ring R is said to be a 
Smarandache non-associative ring (SNA-ring) if R contains a proper subset P such 
that P is an associative ring under the operations of R. 
 
Example 4.3.1: Let R be a field and L be a loop given by the following table. RL be 
the loop ring of the loop L over R. RL is a SNA-ring. The loop L is given by the 
following table:

Clearly RL is a SNA-ring. We can get class of SNA-rings using loops over rings and 
groupoid over rings which we choose to call as loop rings and groupoid rings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.2: Let R be a non-associative ring. A non-empty subset S of R is said 
to be a SNA-subring of R if S contains a proper subset P such that P is an associative 
ring under the operations of R . 
 
The following theorem is straightforward. 
 
THEOREM 4.3.1: Let R be a non-associative ring. If R has a proper subset S such that 
S is a SNA subring then R is a SNA-ring. 
 
Further it is left for the reader to verify that every subring of a SNA-ring R in general 
need not be a S-subring of R. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.3: Let R be any non associative ring. A proper subset I of R is said to 
be a SNA right / left ideal of R if  
 
i. 
I is a SNA-subring of R say J ⊂ I, J is a proper subset of I which is an 
associative subring under the operations of R . 
ii. 
If I is simultaneous by both a SNA right ideal and SNA left ideal then we 
say I is a SNA-ideal of R . 
 
THEOREM 4.3.2: Let R be any non associative ring. If R has a SNA-ideal then R is a 
SNA-ring. 
 
Proof: Obvious from the fact that if R has a SNA-ideal say I then we see R has a 
subset which is an associative ring. Hence the claim. 
 
We have SNA-rings which satisfies special identities like Bruck, Bol, Moufang, right/ 
left alternative. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.4: Let R = (R ,+, ∗) be a SNA-ring we say R is a SNA-Moufang ring 
if R contains a subring S where S is a SNA subring and for all x, y z in S we have  
 
(x ∗ y) ∗ (z ∗ x) = (x ∗ (y ∗ z)) ∗ x 
 
that is the Moufang identity is true. 
 
(R, +, ∗) is said to be SNA Bol ring if R satisfies the Bol identity  
 
((x ∗ y) ∗ z) ∗ y = x ∗ ((y ∗ z) ∗ y) 
 
for all x, y, z ∈ S ⊂ R; where S is a proper SNA-subring. We say the SNA-ring R is 
said to be SNA-right (left) alternative ring if (xy)y = x(yy) [(xx)y = x(xy)]. If R is a 
simultaneously both a right and left alternative NA ring then we call R a 
Smarandache alternative (S-alternative ring) ring. 
 

 
311
DEFINITION 4.3.5: Let R be a non-associative ring. R is said to be a SNA-
commutative ring if R has a subring S such that a proper subset P of S is a 
commutative associative ring with respect to the operation of R. R is said to be a SNA 
strong commutative ring if every subset P of R which is an associative subring is 
commutative. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy non-associative rings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.6: Let R be a SNA-ring. A fuzzy subset µ : R → [0, 1] is said to be a 
Smarandache non-associative fuzzy ring (SNA-fuzzy ring) if µ : P → [0, 1] is a fuzzy 
ring where P is a proper subset of R which is an associative ring under the operations 
of R and denote it by µP. We call the fuzzy subset µ : R → [0, 1] to be a Smarandache 
non-associative strong fuzzy ring (SNA-strong fuzzy ring) if µ : Pi → [0, 1] is a fuzzy 
subring of R for every proper subset Pi ⊂ R which is a subring of R. Thus we denote 
the SNA strong fuzzy ring by just µ as µ is a SNA-fuzzy ring for every subring Pi ⊂ R 
where Pi is a subring of R . 
 
We have the following interesting theorem.  
 
THEOREM 4.3.3: Let R be a SNA-ring. Every SNA-strong fuzzy ring is a SNA-fuzzy 
ring. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.7: Let R be a SNA-ring.  A fuzzy subset µ of the SNA-ring R is said to 
be Smarandache non associative fuzzy subring (S-non associative fuzzy subring) of µ ,  
if  µ  : T →  [0, 1]  is  a  SNA-fuzzy  ring  where  T  is  a   SNA-subring   of   R.  i.e.  
µL  : L  →  [0, 1]  where  L  is  a  proper  subset  of  T  and  L  is  an  associative 
subring  of  T  ⊂  R . 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.8: Let R be a SNA-ring. A fuzzy subset µ of R is said to be 
Smarandache non associative fuzzy ideal (S-non associative fuzzy ideal) of R if for all 
x,y ∈ P ⊂ R (where P is a subset of R which is an associative subring under the 
operations of R). µ(x – y) ≥  min (µ(x), µ(y)) and µ(xy) ≥ max (µ(x), µ(y)). Recall if    
µ and θ  be any two SNA-fuzzy ideals of a SNA-ring R. The product µ o θ  of  µ  and θ 
is defined by  
 
(µ o θ )(x)  
= 
sup
i
i
iz
y
x
∑
=
∞
<
{min (min (µ(yi), θ (zi))} 
 
    
where x , yi , zi ∈ P ⊂ R }.  It is easily verified that µ o θ  is a SNA-fuzzy ideal of R and 
µ o θ  = 〈 µθ〉. 
 
Further µθ in general is not a SNA-fuzzy ideal. It is left as an exercise for the reader 
to prove the above statement. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.9: An  SNA-ideal  P  of  a SNA-ring R,  P ≠ R is called SNA-prime if 
a, b ∈ P, implies either a ∈ P or b ∈ P. 

 
312
 
DEFINITION 4.3.10: A SNA fuzzy ideal µ of a SNA-ring R is called SNA-fuzzy prime 
ideal if the ideal µt where t = µ(0) is a SNA-prime ideal of R . 
 
A non constant SNA-fuzzy ideal µ of a SNA-ring R is called SNA-fuzzy prime if for any 
two SNA-fuzzy idealsσ and θ of R (defined relative to the same P ⊂ R) the condition 
σθ  ⊂  µ  implies either σ  ⊂  µ  or θ  ⊆  µ . 
 
Recall a SNA-ring R is SNA-regular if for each element x in P ⊂ R (P an associative 
subring of R) there exists y in P such that xyx = x. We say R is SNA-strongly regular if 
for each subset P ⊂ R, P an associative ring; P is regular. It can be easily verified. 
 
THEOREM 4.3.4: If R is a SNA strongly regular ring then R is a SNA-regular ring. 
 
We have the notion of fuzzy primary ideal in case of SNA-rings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.11: Let R be a SNA-ring. A SNA-fuzzy ideal µ of R relative to P ⊂ R 
(P an associative subring of R) is SNA-fuzzy primary if for any two SNA fuzzy ideals σ 
and θ  of  R relative to the same associative subring P the conditions σ θ ⊆ 
µ  and 
σ ⊄ µ together imply θ ⊆ 
µ . 
 
Several other properties and results for SNA-rings can be developed analogous to 
associative rings. 
 
Now we just define SNA-fuzzy semiprimary ideal of a SNA-ring R. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.12: Let R be a SNA-ring. A SNA fuzzy ideal µ of the ring R relative to 
P ⊂ R is called SNA-fuzzy semiprimary if 
µ  is a SNA-fuzzy prime ideal of R relative 
to P. 
 
Almost all results in case of fuzzy semiprimary ideals of an associative ring can be 
deduced/ derived in case of SNA-rings. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the concept of fuzzy irreducible ideals in case of SNA-
rings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.3.13: Let R be a SNA-ring. A fuzzy ideal µ of the ring R relative to the 
associative subring P ⊂  R is called SNA-fuzzy irreducible if it is not an intersection 
of any two SNA-fuzzy ideals of R (relative to the same P) properly containing µ; 
otherwise µ is termed SNA-fuzzy reducible. 
 
THEOREM 4.3.5: Let R be a SNA-ring. If µ is a SNA-fuzzy prime ideal of R then µ is 
SNA-fuzzy irreducible. 
 
Proof: Using the fact µ is a SNA-fuzzy prime ideal of R relative to the associative 
subring P in R we prove µ is SNA-fuzzy irreducible relative to the same subring P.  
 

 
313
Several results true in case of S-ring can be also derived  in case of SNA-rings. This 
task is left as an exercise for the reader. This study of SNA-rings is more complicated 
and interesting as  µ a fuzzy structure can be defined relative to every associative 
subring of a SNA-ring. Each subring may possess various properties accordingly the 
µ will also enjoy distinct properties. So further research in this direction will yield 
many interesting results. 
 
 
4.4.  Smarandache fuzzy birings and its properties 
 
 
In this section we just introduce the notions of Smarandache fuzzy birings and its 
properties. We deal with both birings which are associative as well as non associative. 
We define some concepts so that the reader can develop further properties that are 
already studied in case of associative and non-associative rings. The concept of 
birings and fuzzy birings are introduced in chapter 1. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.1: A Smarandache biring (S-biring) (R, +, y) is a non empty set with 
two binary operations ‘+’ and ‘y’ such that R = R1 ∪ R2 where R1 and R2 are proper 
subsets of R and  
 
i. (R1 ,+, y) is a S-ring. 
ii. (R2 ,+, y) is a S-ring. 
 
If only one of R1 or R is a S-ring then we call (R, +, y) a Smarandache weak biring    
(S- weak biring). 
 
We define Smarandache conventional biring as follows: 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.2: Let (R, +, y) be a biring. R is said to be a Smarandache 
conventional biring (S-conventional biring) if and only if R has a proper subset that is 
a bifield. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.3: Let (R, +, y) be a biring. A proper subset P of R is said to be a 
Smarandache sub-biring (S-sub-biring) if (P, +, y) is itself a S-biring. Similarly we 
say for a biring (R, +, y) a proper subset P of R is said to be as Smarandache 
conventional   sub-biring   (S-conventional sub-biring)   if   (P, +, y)   is   itself   a       
S-conventional biring under the operations of R . 
 
The following theorem is straightforward. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.1: If a biring R has a S-sub-biring then R is itself a S-biring. If a biring 
R has S-conventional sub-biring then R itself is a S-conventional biring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.4: Let R be a biring. We say R is a Smarandache commutative biring 
(S-commutative biring)  if  every  S-sub-biring  is  commutative.  If atleast one of the 
S-sub-biring of R is commutative then we say R is a Smarandache weakly 
commutative biring (S-weakly commutative biring).  
 
The following theorem is direct hence left for the reader to prove. 
 

 
314
THEOREM 4.4.2: Let (R, +, y) be a biring. If R is a S-commutative biring then R is a 
S-weakly commutative biring. 
 
Now we define type II Smarandache biring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.5: Let (R, +, y) be a non empty set. We say (R, +, y) is a 
Smarandache biring II (S-biring II) if R contains a proper subset P such that P is a 
bidivision ring. If R has no S-zero divisors then we call R a Smarandache division 
biring (S-division biring) if R is non commutative and R is commutative then we call R 
a Smarandache integral domain (S-integral domain). 
 
We recall the definition of Smarandache bi-ideal and Smarandache pseudo bi-ideal of 
S-birings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.6: Let (R, +, y) be a biring. The Smarandache bi-ideal (S-bi-ideal) P 
of R is defined as an ideal of the biring R where P is a S-sub-biring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.7: Let (R, +, y) be a S-conventional biring. B ⊂ R is a bifield of R . A 
non-empty subset P of R is said to be Smarandache pseudo right bi-ideal (S-pseudo 
right bi-ideal) of R related to P if  
 
i. (P,+) an abelian bigroup.  
ii. For b ∈ B and p ∈ P we have py b ∈ P. 
 
On similar lines we define Smarandache pseudo left bi-ideal (S-pseudo left bi-ideal); 
if P is both a S-pseudo right bi-ideal and S-pseudo left bi-ideal. 
 
We call a S-biring (R, +, y) to be a Smarandache simple biring (S-simple biring) if R 
has no S- bi-ideals. If R has no S-pseudo bi-ideals then we call R Smarandache 
pseudo simple biring (S-pseudo simple biring). 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.8: Let (R, +, y) be a biring. A non-empty subset M is said to be a 
Smarandache bimodule (S-bimodule) if M is an S-abelian semigroup with 0 under the 
operation + i.e. M = M1 ∪ M2 and Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a biring, a non-empty set M is 
said to be a R-bimodule (or a bimodule over the biring R) if M is an abelian bigroup, 
under addition ‘+’ say with M = M1 ∪ M2 such that for every r1 ∈ R1 and m1 ∈ M1 
there exists an element r1 m1 in M1 and for every r2 ∈ R2 and m2 ∈ M2 there exists an 
element r2 m2 in M2 subject to 
 
i. r1 (a1 + b1 )  =  r1 a1 + r1 b1 ; r1 ∈ R1 and a1 , b1 ∈ M1. 
ii. r2 (a2 + b2 ) =  r2 a2 + r2 b2 ; r2 ∈ R2 and a2 , b2 ∈ M2. 
iii. r1 (s1 a1 )  
= (r1 s1 ) a1 for r1 , s1∈ R1 and a1 ∈ M1. 
iv. r2 (s2 a2 )  
= (r2 s2 ) a2 for r2, s2 ∈ R2 and a2 ∈ M2. 
v. (r1 + s1 ) a1  =  r1 a1  + s1 a1, r1 , s1 ∈ R1 and a1 ∈ M1. 
vi. (r2 + s2 ) a2  =  r2 a2  +  s2 a2 where r2, s2 ∈ R2   and  a2 ∈ M2. 
 
In short if M is a bigroup (M = M1 ∪ M2) under ‘+’ then M1 is a R1 -module and M2 is 
a R2 -module then we say M is a R-bimodule over the biring R = R1 ∪ R2. 
 

 
315
If  the  biring  R  has  unit  1 and if 1.m1 = m1 and 1.m2 = m2 for every m1 ∈ M1 and 
m2 ∈ M2 then we call M a unitial R-bimodule. Thus the concept of R-bimodule forces 
both the structures to be bistructures i.e. we demand the group should be a bigroup 
and also the ring must be a biring then only we can speak of a R-bimodule. 
 
Let M be a R-bimodule an additive sub-bigroup, A of M i.e. A = A1 ∪ A2 where A1 is a 
subgroup of M1 and A2 is a subgroup of A2 is called the sub-bimodule of the bimodule 
M if when ever r1 ∈ R1 and r2 ∈ R2 and a1 ∈ A1and a2 ∈ A2 we have r1 a1 ∈ A1  and  
r2 a2 ∈ A2. 
 
A bimodule M is cyclic if there is an element m1 ∈ M1 and m2 ∈ M2 such that for 
every m ∈ M1 is of the form m = r1m1 where r1 ∈ R1 and for every m' ∈ M2 is of the 
form m' = r2m2 where r2 ∈ R2. Thus cyclic bimodules is nothing but bicyclic groups, 
that is the bigroup G = G1 ∪ G2 is a bicyclic group if both G1 and G2 are cyclic 
groups.  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.9: Let (R, +, o) be a biring.  We say R is a Smarandache semiprime 
biring (S-semiprime biring) if R contains no non zero S-bi-ideal with square zero. 
 
Now we proceed on to define S-na biring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.10: Let (R, +, y) with R = R1 ∪ R2 be a na-biring, R is said to be a 
Smarandache na-biring (S-na-biring)  if  R  has  a  proper subset  P  such  that  P = 
P1 ∪ P2 and P is an associative biring under the operations of R. Let (R, +, y) be a 
na-biring.  
 
A proper subset P ⊂ R is said to be a Smarandache na sub-biring (S-na-sub-biring) if 
P is itself a na-sub-biring and P is a S-na-biring. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.3: If (R, +, y) has a na-sub-biring which is a S-na sub-biring then we 
say R is a S-na-biring. 
 
Proof: Follows directly from the definitions, hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.11: Let (R, +, y) be a na-biring. We say R is a Smarandache 
commutative na-biring (S-commutative na-biring) if every S- na sub-biring of R is 
commutative. If at least one S-na sub-biring is commutative then we call R a 
Smarandache weakly commutative na-biring (S-weakly commutative na-biring). 
 
THEOREM 4.4.4: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a na-biring. If R is a strongly subcommutative 
biring then R is a S-commutative biring. 
 
Proof: Straightforward, hence left for the reader to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.12: Let (R, +, y) be a na-biring, we call R a Smarandache Moufang 
biring (S-Moufang biring) if R has a proper subset P; such that P is a S-sub-na-biring 
of P and every triple of R satisfies the Moufang identity 
 
(xy)(zx) = (x(yz))x 

 
316
 
for all x, y, z ∈ P. 
 
Similarly R = R1 ∪ R2 is a Smarandache Bruck biring (S-Bruck biring) if R has 
proper subset P such that  
 
i. 
P is a S-na sub-biring of R . 
ii. 
(x(yx)) z = x (y(xz)) and (xy)–1 = x–1y –1 
 
is true for all x, y, z ∈ P. We call (R, +, y) a Smarandache Bol biring (S-Bol biring) if 
((xy z) y = x(( yx) y) for all x, y, z ∈ P, P ⊂ R is a S-na sub-biring of R. 
 
On similar lines we define Smarandache left (right) alternative birings and 
Smarandache WIP-birings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.13: Let R = (R1 ∪ R2, +, y) be a na-biring. If every S-na sub-biring P 
of R satisfies Moufang, Bol, Bruck, alternative (right / left) or WIP then we call R a 
Smarandache strong Moufang, Bol, Bruck, alternative (right/ left) or WIP biring 
respectively. 
 
Several interesting results can be obtained in this direction. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the concepts of Smarandache fuzzy birings. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.14: Let (R , + , y)  be  a  S-biring where R = R1 ∪ R2. A fuzzy subset 
µ : R → [0, 1] is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy biring (S-fuzzy biring) if the 
following conditions are true. 
 
µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 :  R1 ∪ R2 → [0, 1] is such that µ : R1 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy ring of R1 
relative to P1 ⊂ R1 and µ2 : R2 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy ring of R2 relative to P2 ⊂ R2. 
(Here P1 and P2 are proper subsets of R1 and R2 such that P1 and P2 are subfields 
of R1 and R respectively) i.e. µi : Pi → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subfield; i = 1, 2. If µ : R 
→ [0, 1] the fuzzy subset of R is such that µ is a S-fuzzy biring relative to every 
subfield in R then we call µ a Smarandache strong fuzzy biring (S-strong fuzzy 
biring). 
 
The following theorem is direct hence left for the reader as an exercise. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.5: Every S-strong fuzzy biring R is a S-fuzzy biring. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy sub-biring and Smarandache fuzzy 
bi-ideal of a S-biring R. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.15: Let (R, +, y) be a S-biring. A fuzzy subset µ : R → [0, 1] is said 
to be a Smarandache fuzzy ideal (S-fuzzy ideal) of the biring R if the following 
conditions are satisfied. 
 
µ = µ1  ∪  µ2  :  R1 ∪ R2 →  [0, 1] is such that µ1 : R1 →  [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy ideal of 
R1  and  µ2 : R2  →  [0, 1]  is  a  S-fuzzy  ideal  of  R2 . We  call  the  fuzzy  subset  µ = 

 
317
µ1  ∪  µ2 :  R → [0, 1] to be a Smarandache fuzzy weak bi-ideal (S-fuzzy weak bi-
ideal) of R = R1 ∪ R2 if atleast one µ1 or µ2 is a S-fuzzy ideal and the other is just a 
fuzzy ideal. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.6: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2, +, y) be a S-biring. µ : R → [0, 1] be a S-fuzzy bi-
ideal of R then µ is a S-fuzzy weak bi-ideal of R. 
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions. 
 
Now just we define the notion of Smarandache fuzzy sub-biring. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.16:   Let (R = R1 ∪ R2 , +, y)  be  a  S-biring.  The  fuzzy  subset  µ = 
µ1  ∪  µ2 :  R → [0, 1] is a said to be a Smarandache fuzzy sub-biring (S-fuzzy sub-
biring) of R if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 :  R → [0, 1] is such that µ1 : R1 → [0, 1] a S-fuzzy 
subring of R1 and µ2 : R2 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy subring of R2.  
 
Now if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 :  R1 ∪ R2 → [0, 1]  is said to be a S-fuzzy weak sub-biring if only 
one of µ1 of µ2 is a S-fuzzy subring and the other is just fuzzy subring.  
 
The following theorem is left as an exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 4.4.7: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2, +, y) be a S-biring. The fuzzy subset µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 :  
R1 ∪ R2 → [0, 1]   is a S-fuzzy sub-biring of R then µ is a S-fuzzy weak sub-biring of  
R . 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.17: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2, +, y) be a S-biring. A S-fuzzy bi-ideal µ of the 
S-biring R is said to be Smarandache fuzzy prime (S-fuzzy prime) if the ideal µt = (µ1)t 
∪ (µ2)t where t = µ(0) = µ1 (0) ∪ µ2 (0) is a S-prime bi-ideal of R . 
 
Following the definition of [100] we have this analogous definition for S-fuzzy prime 
bi-ideals. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.18: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2, +, y) be a S-biring. A non constant S-fuzzy bi-
ideal µ of the biring R is called Smarandache fuzzy prime bi-ideal (S-fuzzy prime bi-
ideal) of R if for any two S-fuzzy bi-ideals σ and θ of R the condition σ θ ⊆ µ implies 
either σ  ⊂  µ  or θ  ⊆  µ . 
 
A S-fuzzy bi-ideal µ of a biring R not necessarily non constant is called Smarandache 
fuzzy prime if for any two S-fuzzy bi-ideals σ and θ of R the condition σ θ  ⊂  µ  
implies either σ  ⊂  µ  or θ  ⊂  µ . 
 
Notation: Let µ and θ be any two S-fuzzy bi-ideals of a S-biring R.µ, θ : R1 ∪ R2 → 
[0, 1] the sum µ + θ = (µ1 ∪ θ1) ∪ (µ2 ∪ θ2) : R1 ∪ R2 → [0, 1] is defined by  
 
(µ + θ)(x) = (µ1 ∪ θ1)(x1) ∪ (µ2 ∪ θ2)(x2) =

DEFINITION 4.4.19: Let µ be a S-fuzzy sub-biring (S-fuzzy bi-ideal) of a S-biring R = 
R1 ∪ R2 , t ∈ [0, 1] and t ≤  µ(0) = µ1 (0) ∪ µ2 (0). 
 
The sub-biring (bi-ideal) µt is called a S-level sub-biring (S-level bi-ideal) of µ .  
 
DEFINITION 4.4.20: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a S-biring R. The Smarandache 
smallest fuzzy sub-biring (Smarandache smallest fuzzy bi-ideal) of R = R1 ∪ R2 
containing µ is called the S-fuzzy sub-biring (S-fuzzy bi-ideal) generated by µ in R 
and is denoted by 〈 µ〉 . 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.21: Let F be a S-homomorphism from a S-biring R onto a S-biring R' 
if and only if for µ and σ any S-fuzzy bi-ideals of R. We have 
 
f ( µ + σ )   
= 
 f ( µ) +  f (σ ) 
f ( µσ )      
= 
 f ( µ) f (σ ) 
f ( µ ∩ σ )  
⊆ 
 f ( µ) ∩  f (σ ) 
 
with equality if at least one of µ or σ is f-invariant. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy bi coset of a S-biring R.

is termed as the Smarandache fuzzy bicoset (S-fuzzy bicoset) determined by (x1, x2) 
and µ = µ1 ∪ µ2. 
 
We give the S-fuzzy prime ideal in yet another form. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.23: Let µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be any S-fuzzy bi-ideal of a S-biring R is said to 
be a Smarandache fuzzy bilevel ideal (S-fuzzy bilevel ideal) if and each level bi-ideal 
µt = ( µ1 ∪ µ2)t, t ∈ Im µ is prime µ1 (x1 ) < µ1 (y1 ) and µ2 (x2 ) <  µ2 (y2) for some x1 , 
y1 ∈ P1 ( µ1 is defined relative to P1 ⊂ R1 and µ2 is defined relative to P2 ⊂ R2) then 
µ1 (x1 y1 ) = µ1 (y1 ) and µ2 (x2 y2 ) = µ2 (y2 ). 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.24: A S-fuzzy bi-ideal of a S-biring R is called a Smarandache fuzzy 
maximal bi-ideal (S-fuzzy maximal bi-ideal) if Im µ = {1, α } where α ∈ [0,1) and the 
level bi-ideal (µ1 ∪ µ2 )t = {x1 ∈ P1 ⊂ R1 and x2 ∈ P2 ⊂ R2  / µ1 (x1) = 1, µ2 (x2 ) = 1} 
is maximal. 
 

 
319
DEFINITION 4.4.25: A fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a S-biring, R = R1 ∪ R2 is called 
Smarandache fuzzy semiprime (S-fuzzy semiprime) if for any S-fuzzy bi-ideal θ of R 
the condition θ n ⊂ µ (i.e. θ = θ1 ∪ θ2;

where n ∈ Z+. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.26: Let  R  be  a  S-biring. R is biregular if for each element x1 , y1 in 
P1 ⊂ R1 and x2, y2 in P2 ⊂ R2 where P1 and P2 are subfields in R1 and R2 respectively; 
we have x1 y1 x1  = x1 , x2 y2 x2 = x2. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.27: A S-fuzzy bi-ideal µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 of a S-biring  R is called 
Smarandache fuzzy primary (S-fuzzy primary) if for any two S-fuzzy bi-ideals σ  and θ 
of R the conditions σ θ ⊂  
µ  and σ ⊄ µ together imply θ ⊂ 
µ . 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.28: A S-fuzzy bi-ideal µ of a S-biring R is called S-fuzzy semiprimary 
if 
µ  is a S-fuzzy prime bi-ideal of R. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.29: A S-fuzzy bi-ideal µ of a S-biring R is called S-fuzzy irreducible if 
it is not an intersection of two S-fuzzy bi-ideals of R properly containing µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 
otherwise µ is termed as S-fuzzy reducible. 
 
Now one can study all the properties which we have defined and described for             
S-birings can be easily extended to the case of Smarandache non associative birings.  
 
Here we mention a few of the concepts and the rest of the development is left for the 
reader as research. 
 
From now onwards we denote a Smarandache non-associative biring by S-na-biring. 
We give only few definitions. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.30: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2, +, y) be a S-na-biring that is P = P1 ∪ P2 be a 
S-biring of R. A fuzzy subset µ : R → [0, 1] is said to be a S-na-fuzzy sub-biring of R 
if for all x, y ∈ P = P1 ∪ P2 we have  
 
i. µ (x – y) ≥ min (µ (x), µ (y)) and 
ii. µ (xy) ≥ min (µ (x), µ (y))  
 
or equivalently we can say if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 then µ1 is a S-fuzzy subring of P1 and µ2 is a 
S-fuzzy subring of P2. 
 
So the S-na-fuzzy sub-biring is associated with an associative S-biring contained in 
the S-na-biring. 
 
If in the definition of S-na-fuzzy sub-biring µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 only one of µ1 or µ2 (say) µ1 is 
a S-fuzzy subring and µ2 is just a fuzzy subring then we call µ a Smarandache na-
fuzzy weakly sub-biring (S-na-fuzzy weakly sub-biring) of R. 
 
The following theorem is direct and hence left for the reader as an exercise. 
 

 
320
THEOREM 4.4.8: Let (R = R1 ∪ R2, +, y) be a S-na biring. µ be a S-na-fuzzy sub-
biring of R then µ is a S-na –fuzzy weakly sub-biring of R . 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.31: Let R be a S-na-biring. A fuzzy subset µ of a S-biring R is called 
a Smarandache na fuzzy bi-ideal (S-na fuzzy bi-ideal) of R if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is defined 
relative to P = P1 ∪ P2, P an associative biring in R . 
 
If µ1 (x1 – y1 ) ≥ min (µ1 (x1 ), µ1 (y1 )), µ1 (x1 y1 ) ≥  max (µ1 (x1 ), µ1 (y1 )) and  µ2 (x2 – 
y2) ≥ min (µ2 (x2 ), µ2 (y2 )), µ2 (x2 y2 ) ≥  max (µ2 (x2 ), µ2 (y2 )) for all x1, y1 ∈ P1 and 
x2 , y2 ∈ P2 or equivalently we can say µ1 is a S-fuzzy ideal of P1 and µ2 is a S-fuzzy 
ideal of P2  or still we can say µ1 is a S-fuzzy bi-ideal of P1 ∪ P2 . 
 
If µ : R1 ∪ R2 → [0, 1] is a fuzzy subset such  that µ1 : P1 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy ideal 
of P1 and µ2 : P2 → [0, 1] is a fuzzy ideal of P2 then we call  µ  =  µ1  ∪  µ2  :   P  = 
P1  ∪  P2  →  [0, 1] as a S-na-fuzzy weakly bi-ideal of R . 
 
Thus we can say if in the definition of S-na-fuzzy bi-ideal of R only if µ1 or µ2 is just a 
fuzzy ideal and not a S-fuzzy ideal then we call µ a S-na – fuzzy weakly bi-ideal of R . 
 
THEOREM 4.4.9: Let R = R1 ∪ R2 be a S-na-biring. µ : R → [0, 1] be a S-na-fuzzy bi -
ideal of R then µ is a S-na-fuzzy weakly bi-ideal of R . 
 
Proof: Straightforward by very definitions, hence left for the reader as an exercise to 
prove. 
 
DEFINITION 4.4.32:  Let  ( R  =  R1  ∪  R2 ,  +,  y)   be   a   S-na-biring.  A  fuzzy  set  
µ : R →  [0, 1] is called a Smarandache na-fuzzy prime bi-ideal (S-na-fuzzy prime bi-
ideal) relative to P ⊂  R if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is a such that for any two S-na-fuzzy bi-ideals 
σ = σ1  ∪ σ2 and θ  = θ1 ∪ θ2  of R relative to the same P,  the condition σ1 θ1  ⊂   µ1 
and σ2 θ2  ⊂  µ2  implies that either σ1  ⊂  µ1 , σ2  ⊂  µ2   or θ1  ⊂  µ1 and θ2  ⊂  µ2 . 
 
All notions like S-na-fuzzy primary bi-ideal, S-na-fuzzy maximal bi-ideal, S-na-fuzzy 
semiprimary bi-ideal and S-na-fuzzy irreducible bi-ideal can be defined and all 
properties studied as in case of S-birings. As the aim of the text is to make a 
researcher work on these notions in several places we just define and give the possible 
properties for the reader to prove. The last section of each chapter serves this purpose.

CHAPTER FIVE 
 
SMARANDACHE FUZZY SEMIRINGS AND 
THEIR GENERALIZATIONS 
 
Study of semirings and fuzzy semirings are carried out by several researchers. But the 
notion of Smarandache semirings is new [134]. The concept of Smarandache fuzzy 
semiring is introduced in this chapter. This chapter has five sections. In section one 
we introduce the concept of Smarandache semirings and its properties. 
Smarandachaic fuzzy properties and Smarandache properties are given in semirings. 
We give about 25 definitions recalling the Smarandache-ic fuzzy properties in 
semirings. In section two Smarandache fuzzy semivector spaces are defined and its 
properties are derived. Smarandache fuzzy non-associative semirings are introduced 
and studied in section three. Smarandache fuzzy bisemirings both associative and 
non-associative are introduced and studied in section four which contains about forty 
definitions. The final part of the chapter, the fifth section contains fifty-four problems 
of interest.  
 
5.1 Smarandache semirings and its properties  
 
The study of fuzzy semirings is dealt in chapter I. In this section we just recall the 
definition of Smarandache semirings and give a few of its properties. This section 
defines the notions of Smarandache fuzzy semirings and gives some of its basic 
properties. As the main motivation of the text is to introduce the Smarandache fuzzy 
concepts and make the reader work on these concepts we have restrained  from giving 
several theorems with proofs, instead we propose them as problems in section five. 
Now we start to recollect some of the basic definitions about Smarandache semirings.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.1: The Smarandache semiring (S-semiring) S which will be denoted 
from here on wards as S-semiring is defined to be a semiring S such that a proper 
subset B of S is a semifield with respect to the same induced operations. 
 
Example 5.1.1: R0 = {set of all positive reals with 0} is a S-semiring. For Z0 ⊂ R0 is a 
semifield. Clearly we can prove all semirings in general are not S-semirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.2: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty proper subset A of S is said to be 
a Smarandache subsemiring (S-subsemiring) if A is a S-semiring. 
 
In view of these definitions we have the following theorem which is left as an 
exercise for the reader to prove. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.1: If S is a semiring which has a non-trivial S-subsemiring then S is a 
S-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.3: Let S be a S-semiring. We say S is a Smarandache commutative 
semiring (S-commutative semiring) if S has a S-subsemiring which is commutative. If 
the S-semiring has no commutative S-subsemiring then we say S is a Smarandache 
non-commutative semiring (S-non-commutative semiring).

DEFINITION 5.1.4: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache right (left) ideal (S-right (left) ideal) of S if the following conditions are 
satisfied  
 
i. 
P is a S-subsemiring. 
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and A ⊂ P where A is the semifield of P we have for all    
a ∈ A and p ∈ P, ap (pa) is in A. 
 
If P is simultaneously both S-right ideal and a S-left ideal then we say P is a 
Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) of S.  
 
The following theorem is of interest. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.2: Let S be a S-semiring. Every S-ideal of S is a S-subsemiring of S but 
every S-subsemiring of S need not in general be a S-ideal of S. 
 
Proof: By an example.

DEFINITION 5.1.5: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty proper subset A of S is said to 
be Smarandache pseudo-subsemiring (S-pseudo subsemiring) if the following 
condition is true. 
 
If there exists a subset P of S such that A ⊂ P; where P is a S-subsemiring i.e. P has a 
subset B such that B is a semifield under the operations of S or P itself is a semifield 
under the operations of S.  
 
THEOREM 5.1.3: Let S be a semiring every proper subset of S need not in general be a 
S-pseudo subsemiring. 
 
The reader is expected to prove by an example. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.4: Let S be a semiring if S contains a S-pseudo subsemiring then S is a 
S-semiring.  
 
Proof: S is a semiring and S contains a S-pseudo subsemiring A; i.e. A is contained in 
a semifield P, P contained in S. So S is a S-semiring.  
 
The concept of S-pseudo subsemiring leads to the definition of S-pseudo ideals in the 
semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.6: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo right (left) ideal (S-pseudo right (left) ideal) of the semiring S if 
the following conditions are true. 
 
i. 
P is a S-pseudo subsemiring i.e. P ⊂ A, A a semifield in S.  
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and every a ∈ A, ap ∈ P (pa ∈ P). 
 
If P is simultaneously both a S-pseudo right ideal and a S-pseudo left ideal we say P is 
a Smarandache pseudo ideal (S-pseudo ideal).  
 
Now we define two new notions about S-semiring viz. Smarandache dual ideal and 
Smarandache pseudo dual ideal of a semiring S.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.7: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache dual ideal (S-dual ideal) of S if the following conditions hold good.  
 
i. 
P is a S-subsemiring. 
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and a ∈ A\{0} a + p is in A, where A ⊂ P. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.8: Let S be a semiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo dual ideal (S-pseudo dual ideal) of S if the following conditions 
are true.  

 
336
 
i. 
P is a S-pseudo subsemiring i.e. P ⊂ A, A is  a semifield in S or 
A contains a semifield. 
 
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and a ∈ A, p + a ∈ P. Clearly P is 
simultaneously left and right S-pseudo dual ideal of S as S is 
additively commutative.  
 
The reader is assigned the work of finding examples. Of course, several examples 
exist. Here we introduce yet another nice substructure in a semiring called a 
Smarandache semidivision ring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.1.9: Let S be a S-semiring. S is said to be a Smarandache semidivision 
ring (S-semidivision ring) if the proper subset A ⊂ S is such that  
 
i. 
A is a Smarandache subsemiring which is non-commutative.  
ii. 
A contains a subset P such that P is a semidivision ring that is P has 
no zero divisors and P is a non-commutative semiring.  
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of Smarandache fuzzy semirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.10: A fuzzy subset µ of a S-semiring S is called a Smarandache fuzzy 
semiring (S-fuzzy semiring) relative to P ⊂ S where P is a field if for all x, y ∈ P  
 
µ (x + y)  ≥ min (µ (x), µ (y)) and 
µ (x y)  ≥ min (µ (x), µ (y)).  
 
Thus every S-fuzzy semiring µ will be associated with a semifield P contained in S. 
Further  we  see  µ need not be a S-fuzzy semiring relative to all fuzzy subsets µ on a 
S-semiring S. 
 
We say a fuzzy subset µ of a S-semiring S to be a Smarandache strong fuzzy semiring 
(S-strong fuzzy semiring) if µ relative to every proper subset P which is a subsemifield 
of S is a S-fuzzy semiring. 
 
THEOREM 5.1.5: Let µ be a fuzzy subset of a S-semiring S. If µ is a S-strong fuzzy 
semiring then µ is a S-fuzzy semiring. 
 
Proof: Direct by the very definition.  
 
Now we define the notion of Smarandache fuzzy ideal of a semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.11: Let S be a S-semiring. A fuzzy subset µ of a S-semiring R is called 
a Smarandache fuzzy ideal (S-fuzzy ideal) of R relative to a proper subset P of R 
where P is a semifield if µ satisfies the following conditions. 
 
µ(x + y)  ≥ min (µ(x), µ(y))  
µ(xy)  ≥ max (µ(x), µ(y))  
 

 
337
for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ R. 
 
Example 5.1.3: Consider the S-semiring which is a distributive lattice whose Hasse 
diagram is as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This has several semifields and we can define S-fuzzy ideals accordingly. Product of 
S-fuzzy ideals of a S-semiring S is defined as in case of S-rings relative to a proper 
subset which is a semifield. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy prime ideals of a S-semiring S. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.12: A S-fuzzy ideal µ of a S-semiring S is called a Smarandache fuzzy 
prime (S-fuzzy prime) if the ideal µt where t = (0) is a prime ideal of P ⊂ S (P a subset 
of S which is a semifield) or following [116] we define the S-fuzzy prime ideal of a S-
semiring in a different way. 
 
A non-constant-S-fuzzy ideal µ of a S-semiring S is called S-fuzzy prime if for any two 
S-fuzzy ideals σ and θ of P ⊂ S (µ defined only relative to the semifield P in S) the 
condition σ θ ⊂ µ implies σ ⊂ µ or θ ⊂ µ. 
 
Recall, µ be any S-fuzzy subsemiring of the S-semiring S, t ∈ [0, 1] and t ≤ µ (0). The 
S-subsemiring (S-ideal) µt is called a S-level subsemiring (S-level ideal) of µ. We just 
recall the definition of S-fuzzy quotient ideal of a S-semiring S. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.13: Let µ be a S-fuzzy ideal of a S-semiring S relative to a 
subsemifield P in S. The S-fuzzy ideal µ' of Rµ defined by µ'(
)
*
x
µ
 = µ(x) for all x ∈ P 
is designated as the Smarandache fuzzy quotient ideal (S-fuzzy quotient ideal) of the 
S-semiring S relative to the semifield P, P ⊂ S. From now onwards we will denote by 
L = { L, ≤ , ∧ , ∨} the completely distributive lattice which has ‘0’to be the least 
element and ‘1’ to be the greatest element. 
 
Let X be a non-empty set. A L-fuzzy set in X is a map µ : X→ L and F(X) will denote 
the set of all L-fuzzy sets in X. if µ, ν ∈ F (X) then µ ⊂ ν if and only if µ (x) ⊂ ν (x) for 
all x ∈ X and µ ⊂ ν if and only if µ ⊆ ν  and ν ≠ µ.

It is easily seen (F(X), ⊆ ,∨ , ∧) = F(X) is again a complete distributive lattice which 
has the least and the greatest element say 
1
and
0
. 0  (x) = 0 and 1 (x) = 1 for all x 
∈ X.  
 
We recall these concepts in order to define the notion of Smarandache normal L-fuzzy 
ideals in a S-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION [50]: Let µ ∈ F (S), S a semiring. Then µ is called on L-fuzzy left (resp. 
right)ideal of S if for all x, y ∈ S. 
  
i. µ is an L-fuzzy subsemigroup of (S,+) that is µ(x – y)  ≥ min (µ(x), µ(y))  
and 
ii. µ(x, y) ≥ µ(y) (resp. (µ(x) > µ(xy)). 
 
We give the definition of Smarandache L-fuzzy ideal of a S-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.14: Let S be S-semiring. µ ∈ F(S). Clearly F(S) is also a S-semiring. 
µ is called a Smarandache L-fuzzy left (resp. right) ideal (S-L-fuzzy left (resp. right 
ideal) of S if for all x , y ∈ P ⊂ S,  P a semifield we have µ is a L-fuzzy subsemigroup 
of (P,+) that is  
 
i. µ(x + y)  ≥ min {µ(x), µ(y)}. 
ii. µ(xy)  ≥ µ(y) (resp. µ(xy) ≥ µ(x)). 
 
Thus we assume µ ∈ F(P) ⊆ F(S). 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.15: A S-L-fuzzy left (resp. right) ideal µ of S; S a S-semiring is 
Smarandache normal relative (S-normal relative) to P in S if µ(0) = 1. 
 
Note: The 0 in P will be different for different P’s in S.  
 
For instance if we take S = {0, a, b, 1} to be the distributive lattice which is a S-
semiring. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P1 = {a, 1}, P2 = {b, 1} and P3 = {0,1} are semifields. Also one can take P4 = {0, a} 
and P5 = {0, b} to be semifields of S. Thus S has five distinct semifields. 
 
Thus in case of S-L-fuzzy ideals µ(0) is the largest value of µ only relative to each Pi 
for varying i we will have µ(0) to be varying seen from the above example. Recall, let 
1

µ be an S-L-fuzzy left (resp. right) ideal of the S-semiring S and let µ+ be an L-fuzzy 
set in S defined by µ–(x) = µ(x) + 1 – µ(0) for all x ,∈ P ⊂ S then µ+ will be a 
Smarandache normal L-fuzzy left (resp. right) ideal (S-normal L-fuzzy left (resp. 
right) ideal) of S relative to P containing µ  Thus µ+ will vary from P to P i.e. depends 
on the subsemifield P in S. 
 
Now we proceed on to develop an analogous results of isomorphism theorems and 
fuzzy k-ideals given by [52]. He calls a semiring S to be a k- semiring if for any a, b 
∈ S there exists a unique element c in S such that either b = a + c or a = b + c but not 
both.  
 
Now we define the Smarandache analogue of it. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.16: Let S be a S-semiring. We call S a Smarandache k-semiring (S-k-
semiring) if for any a, b ∈ P ⊂ S (P a semifield in S) there exists a unique element c in 
P such that either b = a + c or a = b + c but not both [52] calls a non-empty subset I 
of a semiring S to be subsemiring of I if I itself is a semiring with respect to the binary 
operations defined in S. An ideal I of a semiring S is called a k-ideal if r + a ∈ I 
implies r ∈ I for each r ∈ S and each a ∈ I. 
 
We define Smarandache k-ideal of a S-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.17: Let S be a S-semiring. A S-ideal I of the S-semiring S is called a 
Smarandache k-ideal (S-k-ideal) if r + a ∈ I implies r ∈ I for each r ∈ P ⊂ S and 
each a ∈ I. 
 
The extension k-semiring is defined by [52] as follows.  
 
Let S be a k-semiring.  Let S' be a set of the same continuality with S \ { 0 } such that  
S ∩ S' = φ  and let us denote the image of a ∈ S \ {0} under a given bijection by a'.

(It is easily verified that these operations are well defined). [52] calls if S is K-
semiring then (

,
S ⊕) is a ring called the extension ring of S. For he denotes \a 
the additive inverse of any element a ∈ S and write a ⊕\ b simply as a \ b. then it 
is clear that a' = \a and a =\a' for all a ∈ S. 
 
Now we define the Smarandache extension ring of a Smarandache k-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.18: Let S be a S-k-semiring (

S ⊕) be a extension ring of S. If

(S-extension ring) of the S-k-semiring S. For a S-k-semiring S,I a S-ideal and I' = 
{a'∈ S' a ∈ I}. Then I is a S-k-ideal of S if and only if 
'I

DEFINITION 5.1.19: A mapping f from a S-k-semiring S into a S-k-semiring R is called 
a S-k-semiring homomorphism if  
 
f (a + b) = f(a) + f(b) and 
f (a b) = f(a)  f(b) 
 
for all a, b ∈ P ⊂ S (P a semifield in S) and  f (a), f(b) ∈ P1 ⊂ R, P1 a semifield in R. 
 
Now for f : S → R a S-k- semiring homomorphism. Let S and R  be S-extension rings

Several results in this direction can be obtained by an innovative reader. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.20: Let A be a S-fuzzy ideal of a S-semiring S. Then A is called a 
Smarandache k-fuzzy ideal (S-k-fuzzy ideal) of S if A(x + y) = A(0) and A(y) = A(0) 
imply A(x) = A(0) where A is defined relative to the subsemifield P in S and 0

S-semiring R. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.21: A S-fuzzy ideal A of a S-semiring R is called Smarandache fuzzy 
prime (S-fuzzy prime) if for all a, b ∈ P ⊂ R either A(ab) = A(a) or else A(ab) = A(b), 
A defined relative to P ⊂ R.

semiprime (S-fuzzy semiprime) if A(am) = A(a) for all a, ∈ P ⊂ R and for all m ∈ Z+. 
(P is the semifield of R relative to which A is defined). 
 
Next we give the concept of S-fuzzy maximal ideals of the S-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.1.23: Let A be a S-fuzzy ideal of a S-semiring R such that all of its 
subsets are S-k-ideals of R. A S-fuzzy ideal A of R is called S-fuzzy maximal if

semifield we have x1 , x2 ∈ P such that a + ax1 a = ax2 a.

Several interesting results in this direction can be had and the reader is expected to 
define and study them. 
 
 
5.2. Smarandache Fuzzy semivector spaces 
 
The notion of semivector spaces over semifields is a recent one. Further the study of 
Smarandache semivector spaces is a very recent one [134]. Here we just recall the 
definition of Smarandache semivector spaces and some of its basic properties. The 
main motivation of this section is to introduce the notion of Smarandache fuzzy 
semivector spaces. 
 
DEFINITION [134]: Let G be a semigroup under the operation ‘+’. S any semifield G, 
be  a  semivector  space  over  S.  G  is said to be a Smarandache semivector space 
(S-semivector space) over S if G is a Smarandache semigroup.

Example 5.2.1: Let S = Q × Zo be a semigroup under componentwise addition. S is a 
semivector space over Zo, the semifield. Now we see S is a S-semivector space over 
Zo. It is important to note S = Q × Zo is not a semivector space over the semifield Qo. 
 
Example 5.2.2: Let Qo × Qo × Qo = S be a semigroup under component-wise addition. 
Clearly  S  is  a  semivector  space  over  Qo  but  S  is  not  a  S-semivector space as  
S = Qo × Qo × Qo is not a S-semigroup.  
 
THEOREM 5.2.1: All S-semivector spaces over a semifield S are semivector spaces but 
all semivector spaces need not be S-semivector spaces. 
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-semivector spaces we see all S-semivector spaces 
are  semivector  spaces. We  note  that  all  semivector  spaces need not in general be 
S-semivector spaces as seen from the above Example 5.2.2. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.1: Let V be a S-semigroup which is a S-semivector space over a 
semifield S. A proper subset W of V is said to be Smarandache subsemivector space 
(S-subsemivector space) of V if W is a S-subsemigroup or W itself is a S-semigroup. 
 
Example 5.2.3: Let V = Qo × Zo × Z, V is a S-semivector space over Zo. W = Qo × Zo 
× 2Z is a S-subsemivector space of V. In fact  W1  =  Qo  ×  {0}  ×  Z  ⊆  V is also a 
S-subsemivector space of V. But W2 = Qo × Zo × Zo ⊂ V is not a S-subsemivector 
space of V over Zo. But W2 is a subsemivector space of V over Zo. 
 
THEOREM 5.2.2: Let  V  be  a  S-semivector  space  over  the  semifield  F.  Every     
S-subsemivector space over S is a subsemivector space over S. But all subsemivector 
spaces of a S- semivector space need not be S-subsemivector space over S. 
 
Proof: By the very definition of S-subsemivector spaces W ⊂ V we see W is a 
subsemivector space of V. But every subsemivector space W of V in general is not a 
S-subsemivector space as is evidenced from example 5.2.3 the subsemivector space 
W2 = Qo × Zo × Zo ⊂ V is not a S-subsemivector space of V. Hence the claim. 
 
Example 5.2.4: Consider V = Z × Zo, V is a S-semigroup. V is a S-semivector space 
over Zo. We see the  set {(-1, 1), (1, 1)}  will  not  span  V  completely {(-1, 0) (1, 0), 
(0, 1)} will span V. It is left for the reader to find out sets, which can span V 
completely. Can we find a smaller set, which can span V than the set, {(-1, 0), (1, 0), 
(0, 1)}?  
 
Let V be any S-semivector space over the semifield S. Suppose v1, … , vn be n set of 
elements in V then we say  
 
∑

in V to be a linear combination of the vi's. We see when V is just a semivector space 
given in chapter I we could find semivector spaces using finite lattices but when we 
have made the definition of S-semivector spaces we see the class of those semivector 
spaces built using lattices can never be S-semivector spaces as we cannot make even 

 
343
semilattices into S-semigroups as x . x = x for all x in a semilattice. So we are left 
only with those semivector spaces built using Qo, Zo and Ro as semifields. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.2: Let V be a S-semigroup which is a S-semivector space over a 
semifield S. Let P = {v1 , …, vn} be a finite set which spans V and the vi in the set P 
are such that no vi 's in P can be expressed as the linear combination of the other 
elements in P \ {vi}. In this case we say P is a linearly independent set, which span V. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.3: Let V be a S-semigroup which is a S-semivector space over a 
semifield S. If only one finite set P spans V and no other set can span V and if the 
elements of that set is linearly independent, that is no one of them can be expressed in 
terms of others then we say V is a finite dimensional S-semivector space and the 
cardinality of P is the dimension of V.  
 
We see in the case of S-semivector spaces V the number of elements which spans V 
are always larger than the number of elements which spans the semivector spaces, 
which are not S-semivector spaces. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.4: Let V be a semigroup which is a S-semivector space over a 
semifield S. A Smarandache basis for V (S-basis for V) is a set of linearly independent 
elements, which span a S-subsemivector space P of V, that is P, is a S-subsemivector 
space of V, so P is also a S-semigroup. Thus for any semivector space V we can have 
several S-basis for V.  
 
Example 5.2.5: Let V = Zo × Z be a S-semivector space over Z. Let P = {0} × {pZ} 
be a S-subsemivector space of V. Now the S-basis for P is {(0, p), (0, -p)}. We see for 
each prime p we can have S-subsemivector space which have different S-basis. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.5:  Let  V  and  W  be  any  two  S-semigroups. We assume P ⊂ V and 
C ⊂ W are two proper subsets which are groups in V and W respectively. V and W be 
S-semivector spaces over the same semifield F. A map T: V → W is said to be a 
Smarandache linear transformation (S-linear transformation) if T(cp1 + p2) = cTp1 + 
Tp2 for all p1 , p2 ∈ P and Tp1 , Tp2 ∈ C i.e. T restricted to the subsets which are 
subgroups acts as linear transformation.  
 
Example 5.2.6: Let V = Zo × Zo × Zo be a semigroup under addition. Clearly V is a 
semivector space over Zo but V is never a S-semivector space.  
 
In view of this we have got a distinct behaviour of S-semivector space. We know if F 
is a field V = F × F × … × F (n times) is a vector space over F. If S is a semifield then 
W = S × S × … S = (n times) is a semivector over S. But for a S- semivector space we 
cannot have this for we see none of the standard semifields defined using Zo, Qo and 
Ro are S-semigroups. They are only semigroups under addition and they do not 
contain a proper subset which is a group under addition.  
 
THEOREM 5.2.3: Let V be a S-semivector space over Qo or Zo or Ro, then we can 
always find a subspace in V which is not a S-semivector space.  
 
Proof: If V is to be a S-semivector space the only possibility is that we should take 
care to see that V is only a semigroup having a subset which is a group i.e. our basic 

 
344
assumption is V is not a group but V is a S-semigroup. Keeping this in view, if V is to 
be a S-semivector space over Zo (or Qo or Ro) we can have V = Zo × Zo × Zo × Q × R 
× … × Zo i.e. V has at least once Zo occurring or Qo occurring or Ro occurring and 
equally it is a must that in the product V, either Z or Q or R must occur for V to be a 
S-semigroup. Thus we see if V is a S-semivector space over Zo. Certainly W = Zo × 
… × Zo ⊂ V is a semivector space over Zo and is not a S-semivector space over Zo. 
Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 5.2.4: Let V = S1 × … × Sn is a S-semivector space over Z o or R o or Q o 
where Si ∈ {Zo, Z, Q 
o, Q, R o, R}.  
 
i. 
If one of the Si is Z or Zo then V can be a S-semivector space only over Z o. 
 
ii. 
If none of the Si is Z or Zo and one of the Si is Q or Qo, V can be a S-
semivector space only over Zo or Q o. 
 
iii. 
If none of the Si is Z or Zo or Q or Q o only R or Ro then V can be a S-
semivector space over Z 
o or Q o or R o.  
 
Proof: It is left for the reader to verify all the three possibilities.  
 
THEOREM 5.2.5: Let V = S1 × …× Sn where Si ∈ {Zo, Z, Q 
o, Q, R or R o} be a S-
semigroup.  
 
i. 
If V is a S-semivector space over Zo then W = Zo × … × Zo (n times) is a 
subsemivector space of V which is not a S-subsemivector space of V.  
 
ii. 
If V is a S-semivector space over Qo then W = Qo × …× Qo (n times) is a 
subsemivector space of V which is not a S-subsemivector space of V.  
 
iii. 
If V is a S-semivector space over Ro then W = Ro × … × Ro (n times) is a 
subsemivector space of V and is not a S-subsemivector space of V.  
 
Proof: Left for the reader to do the proof as an exercise.  
 
THEOREM 5.2.6: Let  V  =  S1  ×  … ×  Sn  where  Si  ∈  {Zo, Z, Ro, R, Qo, Q} if V is a 
S-semivector space over Qo. Then W = Zo × … × Zo ( n times) ⊂ V is only a subset of 
V but never a subspace of V.  
 
Proof: Use the fact V is defined over Qo and not over Zo.  
 
We define a new concept called Smarandache pseudo subsemivector space.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.6: Let V be a vector space over S. Let W be a proper subset of V. If W 
is not a subsemivector space over S but W is a subsemivector space over a proper 
subset P ⊂  S, then we say W is a Smarandache pseudo semivector space (S- pseudo 
semivector space) over P ⊂ S.  
 

 
345
Example 5.2.7: Let V = Qo × Ro × Q be a S-semivector space over Qo. Now W = Zo × 
Zo × Zo and W1 = Qo × Qo × Qo are S-pseudo semivector spaces over Zo ⊂ Qo.   
 
Once the notion of S-semivector spaces are given the concept of Smarandache anti-
semivector spaces becomes vital. So we now proceed on to define Smarandache anti-
semivector spaces.  
 
DEFINITION 5.2.7: Let V be a vector space over the field F. We say V is a 
Smarandache anti semivector space (S-anti semivector space) over F if there exists a 
subspace W ⊂ V such that W is a semivector space over the semifield S ⊂ F. Here W 
is just a semigroup under '+' and S is a semifield in F. 
 
Example 5.2.8: Let V = Q × R × Q be a vector space over Q. We see W = Qo × Ro × 
Q is a S-semivector space over Qo. W1 = Z × Zo × Zo is not a S-semivector space over 
Qo. But V is a S-anti semivector space over Q as P = Zo × Zo × Zo is a semivector 
space over Zo. 
 
Example 5.2.9: Let V = Q × Q × Q × Q × Q, (5 times) is a vector space over Q. Now 
W = Z × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo is a S-semivector space over Zo. So V is a S-anti 
semivector space. The basis for V = Q × Q × Q × Q × Q is {(1, 0, 0, 0, 0) (0, 1, 0, 0, 
0), (0, 0, 1, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 0, 1, 0)} as a vector space over Q.  
 
Now what is the basis or the set which spans W = Z × Zo × Zo × Zo × Zo over Zo. 
Clearly the set of 5 elements cannot span W. So we see in case of S-anti semivector 
spaces the basis of V cannot generate W. If we take W1 = Qo × Qo × Qo × Qo × Z as a 
S-semivector space over Zo. Clearly W1 cannot be finitely generated by a set. Thus a 
vector space, which has dimension 5, becomes infinite dimensional when it is a S-anti 
semivector space. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.8: Let V and W be any two vector spaces over the field F. Suppose U 
⊂ V and X ⊂ W be two subsets of V and W respectively which are S-semigroups and 
so are S-semivector spaces over S ⊂ F that is V and W are S-anti semivector spaces. 
A map T: V → W is said to be a Smarandache T-linear transformation (S-T-linear 
transformation) of the S-anti semivector spaces if T: U → X is a S-linear 
transformation. 
 
Example 5.2.10: Let V = Q × Q × Q and W = R × R × R × R be two vector spaces 
over Q. Clearly, U = Z × Zo × Zo ⊂ V and X = Q × Z × Zo × Zo ⊂ W are S-semigroups 
and U and X are S-semivector spaces so V and W are S-anti semivector spaces.  
 
T : V → W  be  defined  by  T(x, y, z) = (x, x, z, z)  for  (x, y, z)  ∈ Z × Zo × Zo  and 
(x, x, z, z) ∈ X is a S-T-linear operator.  
 
Now we proceed onto define the notion of Smarandache fuzzy semivector spaces and 
Smarandache fuzzy anti-semivector spaces and obtain some interesting results about 
them. 
 

 
346
DEFINITION 5.2.9: A Smarandache fuzzy semivector space (S-fuzzy semivector space) 
(G, η) is or ηG is an ordinary S-semivector space G with a map η : G → [0, 1] 
satisfying the following conditions: 
 
i. η (a + b) ≥ min (η (a), η(b)).  
ii. η(–a) η(a). 
iii. η(0) = 1. 
iv. η (r a ) ≥ η (a)  
 
for all a, b ∈ P ⊂ G where P is a subgroup under the operations of G and r ∈ S where 
S is the semifield over which G is defined.  
 
Thus it is important to note that in case of S-semivector spaces η we see that η is 
dependent solely on a subgroup P of the S-semigroup G that for varying P we may see 
that η : G → [0, 1] may or may not be a S-fuzzy semivector space of V. Thus the very 
concept of S-fuzzy semivector space is a relative concept. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.10: A S-fuzzy semivector space (G, η) or ηG is an ordinary 
semivector space G with a map η : G → [0, 1] satisfying the conditions of the 
Definition 5.2.9. If η : G → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy semivector space for every subgroup Pi 
of G then we call η the Smarandache strong fuzzy semivector space (S-strong fuzzy 
semivector space) of G. 
 
The following theorem is immediate from the two definitions. 
 
THEOREM 5.2.7: Let η : G → [0, 1] be a S-strong fuzzy semivector space of G over 
the semifield S, then η is a S-fuzzy semivector space of G. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions hence left as an exercise for the reader 
to prove. 
 
Now we proceed on to define S-fuzzy subsemivector space. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.11: Let  (G, η )  be  a  S-fuzzy  semivector  space  related  a  subgroup 
P ⊂ G over the semifield S. We call σ : H ⊂ G → [0, 1] a S-fuzzy subsemivector space 
of η  relative to P  ⊂  H  ⊂  G  where  H  is  a  S-subsemigroup  G; and  σ  ⊂  η that 
is σ : G → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy semivector space relative to the same P ⊂  
H which we denote by ηH  i.e. σ  = ηH  ⊂  ηG. 
 
Now we define Smarandache fuzzy quotient semivector space. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.12: For an arbitrary S-fuzzy semivector space ηG and its S-fuzzy 
subsemivector space ηH the Smarandache fuzzy semivector space (G/H,

subset of S 
  
i. Define the fuzzy subset A1+…+ An of G by the following for all x ∈ H ⊂ G 
(H a subgroup of G) (A1+…+ An ) (x) =  sup {min {A1 (x1),…, An (xn)       
x = x1 +…+ xn , xi ∈ H ⊂ G}.  
 
ii. Define the fuzzy subset K o A of G by, for all x ∈ H ⊂ G (K o A)(x) = 
sup{min {K(c), A(y)}  c ∈ S, y ∈ H ⊂ G, x = cy}. 
 
Fuzzy singletons are defined as in case of any other fuzzy subset. 
 
Further almost all results related to S-fuzzy vector spaces can be developed in case of 
S-fuzzy semivector spaces.

intersection of all fuzzy subsemispaces of G (over S1) that contain X and are 
contained in A. Then 〈X〉 is called the Smarandache fuzzy subsemispaces (S-fuzzy 
subsemispaces) of A fuzzily spanned by X. We define the notion of fuzzy freeness in 
case of Smarandache fuzzy semivector spaces.

Let ξ denote a set of fuzzy singletons of H in G such that xλ , xν ∈ ξ then λ = ν > 0. 
Define the fuzzy subset X( ξ ) of H in G by the following for all x ∈ H ⊂ G, X(ξ )(x) = 
λ  if xλ ∈ ξ and X(ξ )(x) = 0 otherwise. Define 〈ξ 〉 = 〈X(ξ )〉. Let X be a fuzzy subset of 
H in G. Define ξ (X) = {xλx ∈ H ⊂ G , λ = X(x) > 0}. Then X(ξ (X)) = X and ξ (X(ξ)) 
= ξ. If there are only a finite number of xλ ∈ ξ with λ > 0, we call ξ finite. If X(x) > 0 
for only a finite number of x ∈ X, we call X finite. Clearly ξ is finite if and only if X(ξ) 
is finite and X is finite if and only if ξ (X) is finite. For x ∈ H ⊂ G, let X\{x} denote the 
fuzzy subset of H in G defined by the following, for all y ∈ H ⊂ G, (X \ x) (y) = X(y) if 
y ≠ x and (X \ x)(y) = 0 if y = x. Let S1 be a fuzzy subset of the semifield S. Let A ∈ 
1
S
A
and let X be a fuzzy subset of H ⊂ G (H a subgroup of the S-semigroup G) such 
that X ⊂ A. Then X is called a Smarandache fuzzy system of generator (S-fuzzy system 
of generator) of A over S1 if  〈 X〉 = A.  
 
X is said to be Smarandache fuzzy free (S-fuzzy free) over S1 if for all xλ ⊆ X , where λ 
= X(x), xλ ⊄ 〈 X \ x〉. X is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy basis (S-fuzzy basis) for A if 
X is a S-fuzzy system of generators of A and X is S-fuzzy free. Let ξ  denote a set of 
fuzzy singletons of H ⊂ G such that xλ xk ∈ ξ then λ = k, and xλ ⊆ A, then ξ  is called 
a Smarandache fuzzy singletons system of generators (S-fuzzy singletons system of 
generators) of A over S1 if, 〈ξ〉 = A. ξ is said to be S-fuzzy free over S1 if for all xλ ∈ ξ, 
xλ ⊆/  〈ξ  \ {xλ }〉, ξ  is said to be fuzzy free over S1 if for all xλ ∈ ξ , xλ ⊆/  〈ξ \ {xλ}〉, ξ  
is said to be a fuzzy basis of singletons for A if ξ is a S-fuzzy singleton system of 
generators of A and ξ is S-fuzzy free.  
 
For λ = 〈ξ 〉 (0), 0λ ⊆ 〈ξ 〉 for every set ξ  of  fuzzy singletons of H in G. Also x0 ⊆ 〈 ξ 〉 
for every such ξ where x ∈ H ⊂ G. Thus if ξ is a set of fuzzy singletons of H ⊂ G such 
that either x0  or 0λ ∈ ξ then ξ is not S-fuzzy free over S1 . 
 
Let A ∈

Several analogous results can be obtained. 
 
Following the definitions of [79] we give some definitions of S-fuzzy semivector 
spaces. It is left for the reader to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for these 
concepts to be equivalent or counter examples to show the non-equivalence of these 
definitions.  
 
From now onwards S will be a semifield and G a S-semigroup and G a S-semivector 
space over S. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.16: A fuzzy subset µ of the S semivector space G is a Smarandache 
subsemispace (S-subsemispace) of G if for any a,b ∈ S and x , y ∈ H ⊂ G (H a 
subgroup relative to which µ is defined ) the following conditions holds good. µ (ax +

Now we define Smarandache linear maps of S-semivector spaces. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.17: Let G and L be S-semivector spaces over the same semifield S 
and let µ : G  → [0, 1] and λ : L  → [0, 1] be S-fuzzy subsemispaces. 
 
The S-linear map relative to subgroup H in G, φ : G  → L, from the fuzzy 
subsemispaces µ to S-fuzzy subsemispaces λ if λ (φ(x)) ≥ µ (x) for all x ∈ H ⊂ G. The 
space of S-fuzzy linear maps from µ to λ is denoted by S F Hom (µ,λ). 
 
Suppose SF Hom (µ,λ) be a collection of S-fuzzy linear maps from µ to λ defined 
relative to the subgroup H in G. We define a function ν from SF (Hom (µ,λ)) into unit 
interval [0, 1] where µ : G  → [0, 1] and λ : G  → [0, 1] are S-fuzzy subsemispaces 
(relative to the subgroup H in G) G and L respectively such that ν determines the      
S-fuzzy subsemispace of SF Hom (µ , λ). 
 
The fuzzy subset ν of SF Hom  (µ , λ) is defined by

Thus if φ ≠ 0 then ν (φ) is the greatest real number α such that for every vector x in

We assume from now onwards G and L are finite dimensional S-semivector spaces 
defined over the same semifield S.  
 
 
µ : G  → [0, 1] 
λ : G  → [0, 1] 
 
are S-fuzzy subsemispaces with S-fuzzy bases {e1,…, en} and  {f1,…, fn} respectively.  
 
Then the Smarandache dual functionals (S-dual functionals) {e1,e2,…, en} and {f 1,      
f 2,…, f m} form S-fuzzy basis of S-fuzzy subsemivector spaces.

g(φ (x) ) for every g ∈ P *⊂ L* and x ∈ H ⊂ G where P* is the related subgroup of 
H* in G* in the S-semigroup L*. It is left for the reader to find out whether

Now we will just test whether we can define Smarandache fuzzy continuity of linear

of X are denoted by greek letters; in general χA denotes the characteristic function of 
a set A.

Recall (X, τ) be a topological space and ω (τ) = { f f : (X, τ) → [0, 1] is lower 
semicontinuous}, ω (τ) is a fuzzy topology on X.

S-fuzzy semivector topology if addition and scalar multiplication are continuous from 
H × H and Q o × H respectively to H ⊂ X (H an additive subgroup of the S-semigroup 
X) with the fuzzy topology induced by the usual topology  on Qo. A S-semivector space 
together with a S-fuzzy semivector topology is called a S-fuzzy topological semivector 
space.

DEFINITION 5.2.19: A Smarandache fuzzy seminorm (S-fuzzy seminorm) on a            
S-seminorm on a S-semivector space X is an S-absolutely, S-convex absorbing fuzzy 
subset of X.  
 
Obtain some interesting results in this direction using S-semivector spaces in the place 
of vector spaces. 
 
We just define the notion of Smarandache fuzzy anti-semivector spaces. 
 
DEFINITION 5.2.20: Let V be a vector space over the field F. We say a fuzzy subset µ 
on V is a Smarandache fuzzy anti-semivector space (S- fuzzy anti-semivector space) 
over F if there exists a subspace W of V such that W is a semivector space over the 
semifield S contained in F. Here µW : W → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy semivector space then 
we call µ the S-fuzzy anti-semivector space.  
 
All results can be derived in an analogous way for S-fuzzy anti-semivector spaces. 
 
 
5.3  Smarandache Fuzzy non-associative semirings 
 
In this section for the first time we introduce both the notion of non-associative 
semirings, Smarandache non-associative semirings and above all the notion of 
Smarandache fuzzy non-associative semirings and derive several interesting 
properties about them. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.1: Let (S, +, y) be a semiring. We call S a non-associative semiring if  
 
i. 
(S, +) is a commutative monoid and  
ii. 
(S, y) is a groupoid i.e. a non-associative semigroup and 
iii. 
a y (b + c) = a y  b + a y c and (a  + b) y c = a y c + b y c for all a, b, c ∈ 
S. 
 
Example 5.3.1: Let Z0 = {set of all positive integers with zero}, Z0 is a semiring. Let 
(L, y) be a loop given by the following table:

Clearly the loop semiring Z0L is a non-associative semiring. A non-associative 
semiring can also be constructed using groupoids; i.e. groupoid semirings are non-
associative semiring. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache non-associative semirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.2: Let (S, +, y) be a non-associative semiring. S is said to be a 
Smarandache non-associative semiring (S-non-associative semiring) if S contains a 
proper subset P such that (P, +, y) is an associative semiring. 
 
The class of S-na-semirings is non-empty. For consider class of loop semirings SL for 
varying loops and varying semirings. SL is a S-na-semiring. 
 
Now as our main motivation is to define Smarandache fuzzy-na-semirings, we having 
defined S-na-semiring just give the definitions of Smarandache non-associative 
subsemirings, Smarandache non-associative ideals in semirings and finally the notion 
of Smarandache non-associative k-semirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.3: Let (S, +, y) be a non-associative semiring. A subsemiring (P, +, 
y) is said to be a Smarandache non-associative subsemiring (S-non-associative 
subsemiring) if (P, +, y) itself is a S-na semiring.  
 
We have the following nice result which is of course direct. 
 
THEOREM 5.3.1: Let (S, +, y) be a na semiring if (S, +, y) has a S-na-subsemiring 
then (S, +, y) itself is a S-na-semiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.4: Let (S, +, y) be a S-na semiring. An non-empty subset I of S is said 
to be a Smarandache na-ideal (S-na-ideal) if  
 
i. I is a S-subsemiring. 
ii. pI ⊂ I and Ip ⊂ I for all p ∈ P ⊂ S where P is an associative 
subsemiring of S relative to which I is defined. 
 
Thus it has become noteworthy to mention that I may not be a S-ideal of S relative to 
all associative subsemirings of S. 
 
If in case I happens to be a S-ideal relative to every associative subsemiring of S then 
we call I a Smarandache strong non-associative ideal (S-strong non-associative ideal) 
of S. 
 
THEOREM 5.3.2: Every S-strong na-ideal of S is a S-na ideal of S. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definition hence left as an exercise for the reader 
to prove. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of Smarandache semiregular na-semirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.5: Let (S, +, y) be a non-associative semiring which is a S- na 
semiring. Let P ⊂ S be such that (P, +, y) be an associative semiring. 

 
354
 
If for each a ∈ P there exists x1, x2 ∈ S such that a + ax1a = ax2a we call S a 
Smarandache non-associative semiregular semiring (S-non-associative semiregular 
semiring).  
 
Let S be a semiring and A ⊆ S. The k-closure A  of A is defined by A  = { x ∈ Sx + 
a1 = a2, a1, a2 ∈ A} We say, A ⊆ P ⊆ S where P is an associative semiring of S to be 
Smarandache k-closure (S-k-closure) of A if A  = { x ∈ Px + a1 = a2, a1, a2 ∈ A}. If 
A is a left ideal of S then A  is the smallest left k-ideal of S containing A. If A is a S-
na-left ideal of S then A  which is a S-k-closure of a is smallest S-left k-ideal of S 
containing A. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.6: Let S be a S-na-semiring. S is called a Smarandache na-k-semiring 
(S-na-k-semiring) if for any a, b ∈ P ⊂ S (P an associative semiring in S) there exists 
a unique c in P such that either b = a + c or a = b + c but not both. Thus we see in 
case of S-na-k-semiring unlike semirings we can have several S-na-k-semirings 
depending on the number of associative semirings in the S-na-semiring which happen 
to be k- semirings. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy non-associative ideals (S-fuzzy na-
ideals) and their properties. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.7: Let (S, +, y) be a non-associative semiring. A fuzzy subset µ of the 
semiring S is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy left (resp. right) ideal of S if µ(x + y) ≥ 
min {µ(x), µ(y)} and µ(xy) > µ (y) (resp. µ(xy) ≥ µ(x)) for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ S where P is 
an associative semiring relative to which µ is defined. µ is a Smarandache fuzzy ideal 
of S if it is both a S-fuzzy left and a S-fuzzy right ideal of S. 
 
DEFINITION 5.3.8: A S-fuzzy ideal µ of a S-na-semiring S is said to be a Smarandache 
fuzzy k-ideal (S-fuzzy k-ideal) of S if µ(x) ≥ min {max {µ(x + y), µ(y + x)} , µ(y)} for 
all x, y ∈ P ⊂  S. 
 
All other notions and results related to S-na semirings can be developed in case of S-
semirings. So we leave rest of the result to be proved by the reader. 
 
 
5.4 Smarandache fuzzy bisemirings and its properties 
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache fuzzy bisemirings. The study 
of Smarandache bisemirings and the notion of bisemirings is very recent. Here we 
recall some basic properties about Smarandache bisemirings and then proceed on to 
define Smarandache fuzzy bisemirings. 
 
The notion of bisemirings is introduced in Chapter I. Here we just recall the definition 
of Smarandache bisemiring. For more about S-bisemirings please refer [135]. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.1: Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. We call (S, +, y) a Smarandache 
bisemiring (S-bisemiring) if S has a proper subset P such that P under the operations 
of S is a bisemifield.  

 
355
 
DEFINITION 5.4.2: Let S be a bisemiring. A non-empty proper subset A of S is said to 
be a Smarandache sub-bisemiring (S-sub-bisemiring) if A is a S-bisemiring i.e. A has 
a proper subset P such that P is a bisemifield under the operations of S.  
 
THEOREM 5.4.1: If (S, +, y) is a bisemiring having a S-sub-bisemiring then S is a      
S-bisemiring.  
 
Proof: Follows from the very definitions.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.3: Let S be a S-bisemiring. We say S is a Smarandache commutative 
bisemiring (S-commutative bisemiring) if S has a S-sub-bisemiring, which is 
commutative. If S has no commutative S-sub-bisemirings then we call S to be a 
Smarandache non-commutative bisemiring (S-non-commutative bisemiring). If every 
S-sub-bisemiring of S is commutative then we call S a Smarandache strongly 
commutative bisemiring (S-strongly commutative bisemiring).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.4: Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to 
be a Smarandache right (left) bi-ideal (S-right (left) bi-ideal) of S if the following 
conditions are satisfied.  
 
i. 
P is a S-sub-bisemiring.  
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and A ⊂ P where A is a bisemifield of P we have for all a ∈ A 
and p ∈ P, a y p (p y a) is in A. If P is simultaneously both a S-right bi-ideal 
and S-left bi-ideal then we say P is a Smarandache bi-ideal (S-bi-ideal) of S.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.5: Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. A proper subset A of S is said to be 
Smarandache pseudo sub-bisemiring (S-pseudo sub-bisemiring) if the following 
conditions are true:  
 
If there exists a subset of P of S such that A ⊂ P, where P is a S-sub-bisemiring, i.e. P 
has a subset B such that B is a bisemifield under the operations of S or P itself is a 
bisemifield under the operations of S.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.6: Let S be a bisemiring. A non-empty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo right (left) bi-ideal (S-pseudo right (left) bi-ideal) of the 
bisemiring S if the following conditions are true:  
 
i. 
P is a S-pseudo sub-bisemiring i.e. P ⊂ A, A is a bisemifield in S.  
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and every a ∈ A, a y p ∈ P (p y a ∈ P). If P is 
simultaneously both a S-pseudo right bi-ideal and S-pseudo left bi-ideal 
then we say P is a Smarandache pseudo bi-ideal (S-pseudo bi-ideal).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.7: Let S be a bisemiring. A nonempty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache dual bi-ideal (S-dual bi-ideal) of S if the following conditions hold 
good:  
 
i. 
P is a S-sub-bisemiring. 
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and a ∈ A \ {0}; a + p is in A, where A ⊂ P.  
 

 
356
DEFINITION 5.4.8: Let S be a bisemiring. A nonempty subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo dual bi-ideal (S-pseudo dual bi-ideal) of S if the following 
conditions are true:  
 
i. 
P is a S-pseudo sub-bisemiring i.e. P ⊂ A, A is a bisemifield in S or A 
contains a bisemifield.  
ii. 
For every p ∈ P and a ∈ A, p + a ∈ P. Clearly P is simultaneously left and 
right S-pseudo dual bi-ideal of S as S is additively commutative.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.9: Let S be a S-bisemiring. S is said to be a Smarandache 
bisemidivision ring (S-bisemidivision ring) if the proper subset A ⊂ S is such that  
 
i. 
A is a S-sub-bisemiring. 
ii. 
A contains a subset P such that P is a bisemidivision ring, that is P has no 
zero divisors and P is a non-commutative bisemiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.10: Let S be a bisemiring we say S is a Smarandache right chain 
bisemiring (S-right chain bisemiring) if the S-right bi-ideals of S are totally ordered 
by inclusion.  
 
Similarly we define Smarandache left chain bisemirings (S-left chain bisemirings).  
 
If all the S-bi-ideals of the bisemiring are ordered by inclusion we say S is a 
Smarandache chain bisemiring (S-chain bisemiring).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.11: Let S be a bisemiring. If S1 ⊂ S2 ⊂ … is a monotonic ascending 
chain of S-bi-ideals Si and there exists a positive integer r such that Sr = Sn for all        
r ≥ n, then we say the bisemiring S satisfies the Smarandache ascending chain 
conditions (S-acc) for S-bi-ideals in the bisemiring S.  
 
We say S satisfies Smarandache descending chain conditions (S-dcc) on S-bi-ideals 
Si, if every strictly decreasing sequence of S-ideals N1 ⊃ N2 ⊃ … in S is of finite 
length. The Smarandache min conditions (S-min conditions) for S-bi-ideals holds in S 
if given any set P of S-bi-ideals in S, there is a bi-ideal of P that does not properly 
contain any other bi-ideal in the set P.  
 
Similarly one can define Smarandache maximum condition (S-maximum condition) 
for S-bi-ideals in case of bisemirings.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.12: Let S be a bisemiring. S is said to be a Smarandache idempotent 
bisemiring (S-idempotent bisemiring) if a proper subset P of S that is a sub-
bisemiring of S satisfies the following conditions:  
 
i. 
P is a S-sub-bisemiring.  
ii. 
P is an idempotent bisemiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.13: Let S be a bisemiring. S is said to be a Smarandache e-bisemiring 
(S-e-bisemiring) if S contains a proper subset A satisfying the following conditions:  
 
 

 
357
i. A is a sub-bisemiring.  
ii. A is a S-sub-bisemiring. 
iii. A is a e-bisemiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.14: A bisemiring S is said to be Smarandache bisemiring of level II 
(S-bisemiring of level II) if S contains a proper subset P that is a bifield.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.15: Let R be a biring. R is said to be a Smarandache anti-bisemiring 
(S-anti-bisemiring) if R contains a subset S such that S is just a bisemiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.16: Let S be a bisemifield. S = S1 ∪ S2 is said to be a Smarandache 
bisemifield (S-bisemifield) if a proper subset P = P1 ∪ P2 of S is a S-bisemialgebra 
with respect to the same induced operations and an external operator (i.e. P1 is a       
S-semialgebra and P2 is a k-semialgebra, P = P1 ∪ P2 is a S-bisemialgebra).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.17: Let S be a bisemifield. S is said to be a Smarandache bisemifield 
of level II (S-bisemifield of level II) if S has a proper subset P where P is a bifield.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.18: Let S be a bisemifield. A proper subset P of S is said to be a 
Smarandache sub-bisemifield I (II) (S-sub-bisemifield I (II)) if P is a S-bisemifield of 
level I (or level II). 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.19: Let S be a bifield or a biring. S is said to be a Smarandache anti-
bisemifield (S-anti-bisemifield) if S has a proper subset, A which is a bisemifield.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.20: Let S be a biring or a bifield. A proper subset P in S is said to be 
a Smarandache anti sub-bisemifield (S-anti sub-bisemifield) of S if P is itself a S-anti 
bisemifield.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.21: Let S be a bifield or a biring, which is a S-anti bisemifield. If we 
can find a subset P in the sub-bisemifield T in S such that  
 
i. P is a bisemiring. 
ii. for all p ∈ P and t ∈ T, pt ∈ P, then P is called the Smarandache anti 
bi-ideal (S-anti bi-ideal) of the S-anti-bisemifield.  
 
Now we just define na bisemiring before we proceed onto define Smarandache na 
bisemirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.22: Let (S, +, y) be a bisemiring. We say S is a non-associative 
bisemiring if S = S1 ∪ S2 where S1 and S2 are semirings where at least one of S1 or S2 
is a non-associative semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.23: Let (S, +, y) be an associative bisemiring. Let L be a loop, the 
loop bisemiring SL = S1L ∪ S2L (where S = S1 ∪ S2; S1 and S2 are commutative 
semirings with unit) and S1L and S2L are the loop semirings of the loop L over the 
semirings S1 and S2 respectively.  
 
Clearly the loop bisemiring is a non-associative bisemiring.  
 

 
358
DEFINITION 5.4.24: Let (S, +, y) be a commutative bisemiring with 1 and G any 
groupoid. The groupoid bisemiring SG = S1G ∪ S2G is a non-associative bisemiring. 
(S1G and S2G are the groupoid semirings of the groupoid G over the semirings S1 and 
S2 respectively). 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.25: Let (S, +, y) be a non-associative bisemiring. We say S is a strict 
bisemiring if a + b = 0 then a = 0 and b = 0. We call (S, +, y) a na-bisemiring, to be 
a commutative bisemiring if both S1 and S2 are commutative semirings. (S, +, y) is 
said to be a semiring with unit if there exists 1 ∈ S such that 1y s = s y 1 = s for all     
s∈ S.  
 
An element 0 ≠ x ∈ S is said to be a zero divisor if there exists 0 ≠ y ∈ S such that x y 
y = 0. A na-bisemiring which has no zero-divisors but which is commutative with unit 
is called a non-associative bisemifield. If the operation in S is non-commutative we 
call S a na-bidivision semiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.26: Let (S, +, y) be a na-bisemiring. We say S is a Moufang 
bisemiring if all elements of S satisfy the Moufang identity i.e. (xy)(zx) = (x(yz))x for 
all x, y, z ∈ S. A na-bisemiring S is said to be a Bruck bisemiring if (x(yz))z = x(y(xz)) 
and (xy)–1 = x 
–1 y 
–1 for all x, y, z ∈ S. A na-bisemiring S is called a Bol bisemiring if 
((xy)z)y = x((yz)y) for all x, y, z ∈ S. We call a na-bisemiring S to be right alternative 
if (xy)y = x(yy) for all x, y ∈ S; left alternative if (xx)y = x(xy) and alternative if it is 
both right and left alternative.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.27: Let (S, +, y) be a na-bisemiring. x ∈ S is said to be right quasi 
regular (r.q.r) if there exists a y ∈ R such that x o y = 0 and x is said to be left quasi 
regular (l.q.r) if there exists a y' ∈ R such that y' o x = 0.  
 
An element is quasi regular (q.r) if it is both right and left quasi-regular.  
 
y is known as the right quasi inverse (r.q.i) of x and y' as the left quasi inverse (l.q.i) 
of x. A right ideal or left ideal in R is said to be right quasi regular (l.q.r or q.r 
respectively) if each of its elements is right quasi regular (l.q.r or q.r respectively).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.28: Let S be a na-bisemiring. An element x ∈ S is said to be right 
regular (left regular) if there exists a y ∈ S (y' ∈ S) such that x(yx) = x ((xy')x = x).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.29: Let S be a na-bisemiring. The Jacobson radical J(S) of a 
bisemiring S is defined as follows: J(S) = {x ∈ S / xS is right quasi-regular ideal of S}. 
A bisemiring is said to be semisimple if J(S) = {0} where J(S) is the Jacobson radical 
of S.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.30: Let S be a na-bisemiring. We say S is prime if for any two ideals 
A, B in S, AB = 0 implies A = 0 or B = 0.

SG = S1G ∪ S2G is a na-bisemiring having non-trivial zero divisors and idempotents.  
 
Having described the concept non-associative bisemirings we now proceed onto recall 
the definition of Smarandache non-associative bisemirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.31: Let (S, +, y) be a na-bisemiring. We say S is a Smarandache na 
bisemiring (S-na bisemiring) if S has a proper subset P, (P ⊂ S) such that P is an 
associative bisemiring.

DEFINITION 5.4.32: Let (S, +, y) be a na- bisemiring. A proper subset P of S is said to 
be a Smarandache na sub-bisemiring (S-na sub-bisemiring) if P itself under the 
operations of S is a S-na-bisemiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.33: Let (S, +, y) be a na bisemiring. We say S is a Smarandache 
commutative na bisemiring (S-commutative na bisemiring) if S has a S-sub-bisemiring 
P that is commutative. If every S-sub-bisemiring P of S is commutative we call S a 
Smarandache strongly commutative bisemiring (S-strongly commutative bisemiring) 
even if S is commutative and S has no S-sub-bisemiring then also S is not 
Smarandache commutative (S-commutative).  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.34: Let (S, +, y) be a na bisemiring. We call S a Smarandache 
Moufang bisemiring (S-Moufang bisemiring) if S has a proper subset P where P is a 
S-sub-bisemiring of S and P satisfies the Moufang identities i.e. P is a Moufang 
bisemiring.  
 
DEFINITION 5.4.35: Let (S, +, y) be a non-associative bisemiring.  
 
If every S-sub-bisemiring P of S satisfies the Moufang identity i.e. every P is a 
Moufang bisemiring then we call S a Smarandache strong Moufang bisemiring         
(S-strong Moufang bisemiring). 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.36: Let (S,+, y) be a S-bisemiring. A fuzzy subset  µ : S → [0, 1] is 
said to be a Smarandache fuzzy bisemiring (S-fuzzy bisemiring) if µ : P → [0, 1] 
where P is a bisemifield of S satisfies the following: 
 
i. µ (x + y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (y)}. 
ii. µ (x y) ≥  µ (y) and µ (x y) ≥  µ (x), x, y ∈ P ⊂ S. 
 
Thus while defining S-fuzzy bisemirings µ we have some semifield P ⊂ S associated 
with it. 
 
Now if µ : S → [0,1 ] is a fuzzy subset of S such that µ related to every subsemifield Pi 
contained in S satisfies the conditions  
 
µ (x + y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (y)} and 
µ (x y) ≥  µ (y) and 
µ (x y) > µ (x) 
 
for all x, y ∈ Pi ⊂ S then we call the fuzzy subset µ to be the Smarandache strong 
fuzzy bisemiring (S-strong fuzzy bisemiring). 
 
THEOREM 5.4.2: Every S-strong fuzzy bisemiring is a S-fuzzy bisemiring. 
  
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions. 
 
We can also define Smarandache fuzzy bisemirings in a different way. 
 

 
361
DEFINITION 5.4.37: Let (S, +, y) be a S-bisemiring. µ : S → [0, 1] be a fuzzy subset of 
S suppose S = S1 ∪ S2 is the S - bisemiring having P =  P1 ∪ P2 where P1 ⊂ S1 and P2 
⊂ S2 are semifields i.e. P is a bisemifield of S. We say µ is a Smarandache fuzzy 
bisemiring (S-fuzzy bisemiring) if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 and µ1 : S1 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy  
semiring relative to P1 and µ2 : S2 → [0,1 ] is a S-fuzzy semiring relative to S2. 
 
The reader is requested to prove or disprove or obtain conditions for the equivalence 
of the two definitions. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of Smarandache L-fuzzy bi-ideals 
Smarandache fuzzy k-bi-ideals of k-bisemirings. From now onwards we will let L 
denote the complete distributive lattice. 
 
L = (L, ≤ ,∧ ,∨) will denote a complete distributive lattice. Let (S = S1 ∪ S2, +, y) be a 
S-bisemiring. Let F(S) denote the set of all L-fuzzy sets of S i.e. F(S) = {µ : S → L}. 
For µ, ν ∈ F(S) µ ⊆ ν if and only if µ (x) ≤ ν(x) for all x ∈ P = P1 ∪ P2 ⊂ S = S1 ∪ S2 
0 (x) = 0, T(x) = 1 for all x ∈ P. It is easily verified (F(S), ⊆ , ∧ , ∨) is again a           
S- bisemiring. 
 
Now we take S a S-bisemiring F(S) the S-bisemiring associated with S and define     
S-fuzzy bi-ideals. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.38: Let µ, ∈ F(S). Then µ is called an Smarandache L-fuzzy left 
(resp. right) bi-ideal of S if for all x, y ∈ P = P1 ∪ P2 ⊂ S we have 
 
i. µ is an S-L- fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of (S,+) i.e. 
ii. µ (x + y) ≥ min {µ (x), µ (y)}.  
iii. µ (x y) ≥  µ (y) (resp. µ (x y) ≥  µ (x)). 
 
that is we can say if µ = µ1 ∪ µ2  and µ1 : P1 → L and µ2 : P2 → L then µ1 and µ2 are 
S-L-fuzzy left (resp. right) ideals of P1 and P2 respectively.  
 
All results pertaining to S-L-fuzzy bisemirings can be obtained using the definitions 
of S-L-fuzzy ideals in S-semirings as a matter of routine. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.39: Let  µ  be  a  S-L-fuzzy bi-ideal of the S-bisemiring R. We say µ is 
S-L-fuzzy normal if µ1 (01 ) =1 and µ2(02) = 1 where ‘01’ ‘02’ are zero elements i.e. 
additive identity of P1 and P2 respectively. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.40: A S-fuzzy left bi-ideal A of a S-bisemiring S is called a S-fuzzy left 
k-bi-ideal of S if for any x, y, z ∈ P ⊂ S, x + y = z implies A(x) ≥ min {A(y) , A(z)} 
where A is defined relative to P, the  bisemifield of S. Let A and B be two fuzzy subsets 
of a S-bisemiring S = S1 ∪ S2. The k-product A ok B is defined by for A = A1 ∪ A2 and 
B = B1 ∪ B2 where A1 : S1 → [0, 1]  A2 : S2 → [0, 1], B1 : S1 → [0, 1] and B2 : S2 → 
[0, 1]

bisemirings. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.41: A bisemiring S is said to be semiregular if for each ai ∈ Si ( i = 1, 
2 where S = S1 ∪ S2) there are x1i x2i ∈ Si; i = 1, 2; such that a1 + a1 x11 a1 = a1 x21  a1 
and a2 + a2 x12 a2 = a2 x22 a2 . 
 
We now proceed on to define Smarandache semiregular bisemiring. 
 
DEFINITION 5.4.42: A bisemiring (S = S1 ∪ S2, +, y) is said to be Smarandache 
semiregular bisemiring (S-semiregular bisemiring) if S has a proper subset P =         
P1 ∪ P2 where P is a semiregular sub-bisemiring of S. 
 
For the bisemiring S we define k-closure of A ⊂ S by

It is left for the reader to prove in case of bisemiring S = S1 ∪ S2, A, B ⊂ S

AB =

Further if A  is the smallest left k-bi-ideal of S containing A and if in a bisemiring S,  
if A and B are right and left bi-ideals of the bisemiring S then it can be proved 
____
AB  = 
A ∩ B. 
 
Let S be a bisemiring. A k-bi-ideal I of S is called bi prime if I ≠ S and for any two bi-
ideals A and B of S, AB ⊂ I implies either A ⊂ I or B ⊂ I. We say in the S-bisemiring S 

 
363
a k-bi-ideal I of S to be S- bi prime if I is a bi prime bi-ideal relative to a bisemifield P 
in S. 
 
We say a fuzzy k-bi-ideal P of a bisemiring S is said to be  bi prime if P is not a 
constant function and for any two fuzzy bi-ideals A and B of S A ok B ⊆ P implies 
either A ⊆ P of B ⊂ P. 
 
We say the fuzzy k bi-ideal P of S-bisemiring S is a Smarandache fuzzy k-bi-ideal     
(S-fuzzy k-bi-ideal) of S if P is a fuzzy k-bi-ideal relative a proper subset T ⊂ S where 
T is a bisemifield under the operations of S. 
 
Several interesting results in this direction can be obtained by any innovative reader. 
 
Now we know in case of Smarandache bisemirings of level II we can have all 
Smarandache fuzzy concepts related to fuzzy fields. All the more several types of 
these concepts can also developed in case of Smarandache anti bisemifield. 
 
We know a Smarandache na-bisemiring has a subset which is an associative 
bisemiring. Thus we have in case of S-na-bisemiring all properties true of bisemirings 
can be easily adopted and studied. 
 
For we can define the very fuzzy set µ from S to [0, 1] by  µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 where µ1 : S1 
→ [0, 1]  and µ2 : S2 → [0, 1]. So for defining the notions of Smarandache L-fuzzy bi-
ideals µ in case of S-na-bisemirings, we can define µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 : S1 ∪ S2 → [0, 1] and 
by µ1 : S1 → [0, 1]  and µ2 : S2 → [0, 1] to be S-fuzzy k ideals and similarly by 
defining µi : Si → [0, 1]  for i = 1,2 as Smarandache normal L-fuzzy ideals in 
semirings; so that µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 be comes Smarandache normal  L-fuzzy bi-ideals in S-
bisemirings. 
 
Thus in case of Smarandache non-associative bisemirings, we can define and derive 
the notions of S-fuzzy k-bi-ideals and S-fuzzy k-bi-ideals in S-k-bisemirings.

SMARANDACHE FUZZY NEAR-RING AND 
ITS PROPERTIES 
 
This chapter has four sections. In the first section we recall the definition of 
Smarandache near-rings and define the new notion of Smarandache fuzzy near-rings. 
Properties like Smarandache normal fuzzy-R-subgroups and S-fuzzy congruence of a 
near-ring module are defined in section 1. In section two we define these notions in 
the context of non-associative near-rings and study them. Study of bistructures is very 
important and inevitable as we do not see any proper structure given by union of two 
algebraic structures and union of two distinct algebraic structures. So section three is 
devoted to introduction and study of Smarandache fuzzy bistructures. The final 
section is completely devoted to giving problem about S-fuzzy near-rings and their 
properties. These problems will make the researcher to get more ideas and they can 
construct more and more Smarandache notions and find also suitable applications 
about them.  
 
 
6.1 Smarandache Fuzzy Near-rings 
 
In this section we just recall the definition of Smarandache near-rings and introduce 
the notions of Smarandache fuzzy near-rings and their properties. The concept of 
Smarandache fuzzy congruence of a near-ring module and Smarandache normal fuzzy 
R-subgroups in near-rings are mainly introduced and studied in this section.  
 
As in this book we have only recalled the concept of fuzzy near-rings and its 
properties, in this section we recall the notions of Smarandache near-rings and 
Smarandache seminear-rings. We also define for the first time both notions of 
Smarandache fuzzy seminear-rings and fuzzy seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.1: N is said to be a Smarandache near-ring (S-near-ring) if (N, +, y) 
is a near-ring and has a proper subset A such that (A, +, y) is a near-field.  
 
Example 6.1.1: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be the near-field. Take any group G such that Z2G is 
the group near-ring of the group G over the near-field Z2.  Z2G  is  a  S-near-ring  as 
Z2 ⊂ Z2G and Z2 is a near-field.  
 
It is important to note that in case of S-near-rings we can get several or a new class of 
S-near-ring by using group near-rings and semigroup near-rings using basically the 
near-field Z2 or any Zp.  
 
Example 6.1.2: Let Z2 = {0, 1} be a near-field and S(n) any symmetric semigroup. 
The semigroup near-ring Z2S(n) is a S-near-ring. This S-near-ring can be of any order 
finite or infinite depending on the order of the group or the semigroup which is used. 
Similarly they can be commutative or non-commutative which depends basically on 
the groups and semigroups.  
 

 
370
DEFINITION 6.1.2: Let (N, +, y) be a S-near-ring. A non-empty proper subset T of N is 
said to be a Smarandache subnear-ring (S-subnear ring) if (T, +, y) is a S-near-ring; 
i.e. T has a proper subset which is a nearfield. 
  
DEFINITION 6.1.3: Let (P, +) be a S-semigroup with zero 0 and let N be a S-near-
ring. Let µ : N × Y → Y where Y is a proper subset of P which is a group under the 
operations of P. (P, µ) is called the Smarandache N-group (S-N-group) if for all y ∈ Y 
and for all n, n1 ∈ N we have (n + n1) y = ny + n1y and (nn1) y = n(n, y). S (N P) 
stands for S-N-groups.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.4: A S-semigroup M of a near-ring N is called a Smarandache-quasi 
subnear-ring (S-quasi subnear-ring) of N if X ⊂ M where X is a subgroup of M which 
is such that X.X ⊆ X.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.5: A S-subsemigroup Y of S(N P) with NY ⊂ Y is said to be a 
Smarandache N-subgroup (S-N-subgroup) of P.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.6: Let N and N1 be two S-near-rings. P and P1 be S-N-subgroups.  
 
i. 
h : N → N1 is 
called a Smarandache near-ring homomorphism (S-near-ring homomorphism) 
if for all m, n ∈ M (M is a proper subset of N which is a near-field) we have  
 
h (m + n) = h(m) + h(n),  
h (mn) = h(m) h(n) where h (m) and  
 
h (n) ∈ M1 (M1 is a proper subset of N1 which is a near-field).It is to be noted 
that h need not even be defined on whole of N.  
 
ii. 
h : P → P1 is 
called 
the 
Smarandache 
N-subgroup-homomorphism 
(S-N-subgroup-
homomorphism) if for all p, q in S (S the proper subset of P which is a S-N-
subgroup of the S-semigroup P) and for all m ∈ M ⊂ N (M a subfield of N) h(p 
+ q) = h(p) + h(q)  and h(mp) = mh(p); h(p), h(q) and mh(p) ∈ S1 (S1  a 
proper subset of P1 which is a S-N1 subgroup of S-semigroup P1 ). 
  
Here also we do not demand h to be defined on whole of P.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.7: Let N be a S-near-ring. A normal subgroup I of (N, +) is called a 
Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) of N related to X if  
 
i. IX ⊆ I. 
ii. ∀ x, y ∈ X and for all i ∈ I; x (y + i) – xy ∈ I,  
 
where X is the near-field contained in N.  
 
A subgroup may or may not be a S-ideal related to all near-fields. Thus while defining 
S-ideal it is important to mention the related near-field.  
 

 
371
Normal subgroup T of (N, +) with (a) is called S-right ideals of N related to X while 
normal subgroups L of (N, +) with (b) are called S-left ideals of N related to X.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.8: A  proper  subset  S of P is called a Smarandache ideal of S(N P) 
(S-ideal of S(N)P) related to Y if  
 
i. 
S is a S-normal subgroup of the S-semigroup P.  
ii. 
For all s1 ∈ S and s ∈ Y (Y is the subgroup of P) and for all m ∈ M (M 
the near-field of N)  
n ( s + s1) – ns ∈ S.  
 
A S-near ring is Smarandache simple (S-simple) if it has no S-ideals. S(N p) is called 
Smarandache N-simple (S-N-simple) if it has no S-normal subgroups except 0 and P.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.9: A S-subnear-ring M of a near-ring N is called Smarandache 
invariant (S-invariant) related to the near-field X in N if M X ⊂ M and X M ⊂ M 
where X is a S-near-field of N. Thus in case of S-invariance it is only a relative 
concept as a S-subnear-ring M may not be invariant related to every near-fields in the 
near-ring N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.10: Let X and Y be S-semigroups of S(N P). (X:Y) = {n ∈ M / nY ⊂ X} 
where M is a near-field contained in N. (0, x) is called the Smarandache annihilator 
(S-annihilator) of X.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.11: Let N be a near-ring and S a S-subsemigroup of (N, +). The near-
ring Ns is called the Smarandache-near-ring of left (right) quotients (S-near-ring of 
left (right) quotients) of N with respect to S if  
 
i. 
Ns has identity.  
ii. 
N is embeddable in Ns , by a homomorphism h.  
iii. 
For all s ∈ S; h(s) is invertible in (Ns , y).  
iv. 
For all q ∈ Ns , there exists s ∈ S and there exist n ∈ N such that q = h(n) h(s)–1 
(q = h(s)–1 h(n)).  
 
The problem whether Ns is a S-near-ring is left as an open problem.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.12: The near-ring N is said to fulfil the Smarandache left (right) ore 
conditions (S-left(right) ore condition) (ore (1)) with respect to a given S-
subsemigroup P of (N, y) if for (s, n) ∈ S × N there exists ns1 = sn1 (s1n = n1s).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.13: If S = {s ∈ N / s is cancellable}, the NS if it exists and if NS is a    
S-near-ring then Ns is called the Smarandache left (right) quotient (S-left(right) 
quotient) near-ring of N. 
 
THEOREM 6.1.1:  If NS is a S-quotient near-ring then NS is a quotient near-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition.  
 

 
372
It is once again an interesting problem to obtain a necessary and sufficient condition 
for a left (right) quotient near-ring N to be a S-quotient near-ring.  
 
Let S(V) denote the collection of all S-near-rings and X be any nonempty subset 
which is S-semigroup under ‘+’ or ‘y’.  
 
We define Smarandache free near-ring as follows.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.14: A S-near-ring Fx ∈ S(V) is called a Smarandache free near-ring 
(S-free near-ring)  in  V  over  X  if there exists f : X → F  for all  N ∈ V  and for  all  
g : X → N there exists a S-near-ring homomorphism h ∈ S (Hom Fx , N) [Here            
S (Hom (Fx , N)) denotes the collection of S-homomorphism from Fx to N] such that     
h o f = g.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.2: Let Fx be a S-free near-ring then Fx is a free near-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.15:  z ∈ N is called Smarandache quasi regular (S-quasi regular)  if  
z ∈ Lz. An S-ideal P ⊂ N is called S-quasi regular if and only if for all s ∈ P, s is       
S-quasi regular.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.16: A ring R is said to be Smarandache biregular (S-biregular) if 
each S-principal ideal is generated by an idempotent.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.17: Let N be a near-ring. N is said to by Smarandache biregular      
(S-biregular) if there exists some set E of central S-idempotents with  
 
i. 
For all e ∈ N; Ne is an S-ideal of N.  
ii. 
For all n ∈ N there exists e ∈ E; Ne = (n) (principal ideal 
generated by n).  
iii. 
For all e, f ∈ E   e + f = f + e. 
iv. 
For all e, f ∈ E, ef ∈ E and e + f – ef ∈ E.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.18: Let I be an S-ideal. The intersection of all S-prime ideal P, such 
that I ⊆ P is called the Smarandache prime radical (S-prime radical) of I, i.e. S(I) =  
I
P
I
P
⊆
. 
 
THEOREM 6.1.3: Let I be a S-ideal of N. S(I) be the S-prime radical of I then S(I) is a 
prime radical of I.  
 
Now we proceed on to define the notions of Smarandache seminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.19: Let N be a seminear-ring. N is said to be a Smarandache 
seminear-ring of level II (S-seminear-ring of level II) if N contains a proper subset P 
which is a semiring. Clearly the S-mixed direct product gives S-seminear-ring II.  
 

 
373
DEFINITION 6.1.20: Let N be a S-near-ring. N is said to fulfil the Smarandache 
insertion of factors property (S-IFP for short) if for all a, b ∈ N we have a . b = 0 
implies anb = 0 for all n ∈ P, P ⊂ N, where P is a near-field.  
 
We say N has S-strong IFP property if every homomorphic image of N has the IFP 
property or we redefine this as:  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.21: Let N be a S-near-ring and I a S-ideal of N. N is said to fulfil 
Smarandache  strong  IFP  property  (S-strong IFP property)  if  and  only  if  for  all 
a, b ∈ N, ab ∈ I implies anb ∈ I where n ∈ P, P ⊂ N and P is a near-field.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.22: Let N be a near-ring. A S-right ideal I of N is called 
Smarandache right quasi reflexive (S-right quasi reflexive) if whenever A and B are 
S-ideals of N with AB ⊂ I, then b(b' + a) – bb' ∈ I for all a ∈ A and for all b, b' ∈ B.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.23: Let N be a near-ring. N is said to be Smarandache strongly 
subcommutative (S-strongly subcommutative) if every S-right ideal of it is S-right 
quasi reflexive. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.24: Let N be a near-ring. S a S-subnormal subgroup of (N, +). S is 
called a Smarandache quasi-ideal (S-quasi ideal) of N if SN ⊂ S and NS ⊂ S where by 
NS we mean elements of the form {n(n' + s) – nn'/ for all s ∈ S and for all n, n' ∈ N} 
= NS.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.25: A left-near-ring N is said to be Smarandache left-self-distributive 
(S-left self distributive) if the identity abc = abac is satisfied for a, b, c ∈ A, A ⊂ N 
and A is a S-subnear-ring of N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.26: Let R be a S-near-ring. R is said to be Smarandache equiprime 
(S-equiprime) if for all 0 ≠ a ∈ P ⊂ R. P the near-field in R and for x, y ∈ R, arx = 
ary for all r ∈ R implies x = y. If B is a S-ideal of R, B is called a Smarandache 
equiprime ideal (S-equiprime ideal) if R/B is an S-equiprime near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.27: Let (N, +,y) be a triple. N is said to be a Smarandache infra-
near-ring (S-INR) where  
 
i. (S, +) is a S-semigroup. 
ii. (N, y) is a semigroup. 
iii. (x + y)z = xz – 0z + yz for all x, y, z ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.28: Let I be a S-left ideal of N. Suppose I satisfies the following 
conditions: 
  
i. a, x, y ∈ N, anx – any ∈ I for all n ∈ N implies x – y ∈ I.  
ii. I is left invariant. 
iii. 0N ⊂ I. 
 
Then I is called a Smarandache equiprime left-ideal (S-equiprime left ideal) of N.  
 

 
374
DEFINITION 6.1.29: Let N be a S-near-ring. N is said to be Smarandache partially 
ordered (S-partially ordered) by ≤ if  
 
i.

DEFINITION 6.1.30: Let  M  be  a  S-Γ-near-ring,  then a S-normal subsemigroup I of

I.  
ii. 
a S-right ideal if i α a ∈ I for all a ∈ M, α ∈ Γ and i ∈ I and  
iii. 
a S-ideal if it is both S-left and S-right ideal.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: A non-empty set N is said to be a Smarandache seminear-ring     
(S-seminear-ring) if (N, +, y) is a seminear-ring having a proper subset A, (A ⊂ N) 
such that A under the same operations of N is a near-ring, that is (A, +,y ) is a near-
ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.31: Let (N, +, y) be a seminear-ring. If in the S-semigroup (N, +) 
every proper subset (A, +) which is a group is commutative then we say the               
S-seminear-ring N is Smarandache commutative (S-commutative). Thus if (N, +, y) is 
commutative and if (N, +) is S-semigroup then trivially (N, +, y) is S-commutative. 
Secondly if (N, +, y) is S-commutative seminear-ring then N need not in general be 
commutative.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.32: Let (N, +, y) be a seminear-ring. If (N, +) is a S-semigroup and if 
N has at least one proper subset which is a subgroup that is commutative then we say 
the seminear-ring (N, +, y) is a Smarandache weakly commutative seminear-ring    
(S-weakly commutative seminear-ring).  
 
THEOREM 6.1.4: Let (N, +, y) be a seminear-ring which is S-commutative then N is   
S-weakly commutative.  
 
Proof: Proof is direct and the reader is expected to prove. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.33: Let (N, +, y) be a seminear-ring. (N, +) be a S-semigroup such 
that every proper subset A of N which is a group is a cyclic subgroup then we say the 
seminear-ring (N, +, y) is a Smarandache cyclic seminear-ring (S-cyclic seminear-
ring). In particular (N, +, y) has at least one proper subset which is a cyclic group, 
we call (N, +, y) a Smarandache weakly cyclic seminear-ring (S-weakly cyclic 
seminear-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.34: Let N and N1 be any two S-seminear-rings. We say a map φ from 
N to N1 is a Smarandache seminear-ring homomorphism (S-seminear-ring 
homomorphism) from A to A1 where A ⊂ N is a near-ring and A1 ⊂ N1 is a near-ring 
and φ(x + y) = φ(x) + φ(y), φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y) where x, y ∈ A and φ(x), φ(y) ∈ A1 and it 
is true for all x, y ∈ A. We need not even have the map φ to be well-defined or even 
defined on the whole of N.  

 
375
 
The concept of Smarandache isomorphism (S-isomorphism) etc. are defined in a 
similar way.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.35: Let (N, +, y) be a seminear-ring. We say N is a Smarandache 
seminear-ring of level II (S-seminear-ring II) if N has a proper subset P where P is a 
semiring.  
 
DEFINITION [130]: N is said to be a Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring (S-pseudo 
seminear-ring) if N is a near-ring and has a proper subset A of N which is a 
seminear-ring under the operations of N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.36: Let N and N1 be the S-pseudo seminear-ring. A mapping φ : N → 
N1 is said to be a Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring homomorphism (S-pseudo 
seminear-ring homomorphism) if φ restricted from A to A1 is a seminear-ring 
homomorphism where A and A1 are proper subsets of N and N1 which are seminear-
rings. Thus φ need not even be defined on the whole of N.  
 
We define the concept of S-pseudo subseminear-ring and Smarandache pseudo ideals 
of a near-ring. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.37: Let N be a near-ring if N has a proper subset A which is a 
subnear-ring A and if A itself a S-pseudo seminear-ring then we say A is a 
Smarandache pseudo subseminear-ring (S-pseudo subseminear-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.38: Let N be a near-ring. A proper subset M of N is said to be a 
Smarandache pseudo ideal (S-pseudo ideal) if M is a S-ideal of the near-ring N.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.5: Let N be a near-ring. If N has a S-pseudo subseminear-ring then N 
is a S-pseudo seminear-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions.  
 
It is left for the reader to construct a S-pseudo seminear-rings which has no S-pseudo 
subseminear-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.39: Let N be a S-pseudo seminear-ring, if N has no proper S-pseudo 
subseminear-ring then we say N is a Smarandache pseudo simple seminear-ring      
(S-pseudo simple seminear-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.40: N is said to be Smarandache pseudo seminear-ring (S-pseudo 
seminear-ring) if N is a near-ring and has a proper subset A of N such that A is a 
seminear-ring under the operations of N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.41: Let N and N1 be two S-pseudo seminear-rings. h : N → N1 is a 
Smarandache pseudo seminear ring homomorphism (S-pseudo seminear-ring 
homomorphism) if h restricted from A to A1 is a seminear-ring homomorphism.  
 

 
376
DEFINITION 6.1.42: Let N be a S-seminear-ring II. An additive subgroup A of N is 
called a Smarandache N-subgroup II (S-N-subgroup II) if NA ⊂ N (AN ⊂ A) where 
NA = {na / n ∈ N and a ∈ A}. 
 
Thus we see in case of S-seminear-rings we have the concept of S-N-subgroup. We 
define S-left ideal for S-seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.43: Let (N, +, y) be a S-seminear-ring. A proper subset I of N is 
called Smarandache left ideal (S-left ideal II) in N if  
 
i. 
(I, +) is a normal subgroup of A ⊂ N where (A, +) is a group.  
ii. 
n (n1 + i) + nr n1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I, n, n1 ∈ A where nr denotes 
the unique inverse of n.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.44: A nonempty subset I of (N, +, y); N a S-seminear-ring is called a 
Smarandache ideal II (S-ideal II) in N if 
 
i. 
I is a S-left ideal.  
ii. 
IA ⊂ I (A ⊂ N; A is a near-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.45: Let N be a S-seminear ring. N is said to be a Smarandache           
s-seminear-ring II (S-s-seminear-ring II) if a ∈ Na for each a ∈ A ⊂ N; where A is a 
near ring. 
 
Now we define Smarandache fuzzy near-rings. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.46: Let R be a S-near-ring. A fuzzy set µ : R → [0, 1] is called a 
Smarandache fuzzy near-ring (S-fuzzy near-ring) related to P ⊂ R where P is a near-
field satisfying the following conditions:  
 
i. 
µ(x + y) ≥ min{(µ(x), µ(y)}. 
ii. 
µ(–x) ≥ µ(x). 
iii. 
µ(xy) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)}. 
iv. 
µ(x) = µ(x–1) for all x, y ∈ P ⊂ R.  
 
Thus while defining S-fuzzy near-rings it is also a relative concept related to which 
near-field it is defined.  
 
In view of this we have the following definition.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.47: Let R be a S-near-ring. µ a fuzzy subset of R. We call µ a 
Smarandache strong fuzzy near-ring (S-strong fuzzy near-ring) if µ is a S-fuzzy near-
ring relative to every near-field in R.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.6: If R is a S-near-ring and µ : R → [0, 1] is a S-strong fuzzy near-
rings of R then µ a S-fuzzy near-ring.  
 
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions, hence left for the reader to prove.

Now we proceed on to define the concept of Smarandache fuzzy near-ring module.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.48: Let R be a S-near-ring and µ a S-fuzzy near-ring in R. Let Y be a 
S-near-ring module over the S-near-ring R and σ a fuzzy set in Y. Then σ is called the 
Smarandache fuzzy near-ring module (S-fuzzy near-ring module) in Y if  
 
 
i. σ (x + y) ≥ min{σ (x), σ (y)}. 
ii. σ (λx) ≥ min{µ (λ), σ (x)} for all x, y ∈ Y and λ ∈ P ⊂ R . 
iii. σ (0) = 1.  
 
It is worthwhile to mention in S-near-rings the condition σ (λx) ≥ min{µ (λ), σ (x)} is 
replaced by σ (λx) > σ (x) for all λ ∈ P ⊂ R and x ∈ Y.  
 
DEFINITION 6.1.49: Let R be a S-near-ring. A fuzzy subset µ of R is called the 
Smarandache fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of R if  
 
i. µ is a S-fuzzy subgroup of (P, +); P ⊂ R a subnear-field of R . 
ii. µ(xr) > µ(x) (respectively µ(rx) > µ(x)) for all r, x ∈ P ⊂ R .  
 
The S-fuzzy right R-subgroup µ is said to be fuzzy normal whenever µ(a) = 1.  
 
 DEFINITION 6.1.50: Let µ be a S-fuzzy right (resp. left) R subgroup of a S-near-ring 
R and let µ+ be a fuzzy set in R defined by µ+(x) = µ(x) + 1 – µ(0) for all x ∈ P ⊂ R 
(P a near-field of the S-near-ring R), µ+  is called the Smarandache fuzzy right (resp. 
left) R subgroup (S-fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup) of R containing µ.  
 
The following is in easy consequence of the definition.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.7: Let µ be a S-fuzzy right (resp. left) S-fuzzy R-subgroup of R 
satisfying µ+(x) = 0 for some x ∈ P ⊂ R then µ(x) = 0 also (0 is the additive identity 
of P).  
 
Proof: Easy and straightforward, hence left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.8: Let µ and ν be S-fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroups of a S-near-
ring R. If µ ⊂ ν and µ(0) = ν(0) then Pµ ⊂ Pν (where P ⊂ R is a near-field relative to 
which both µ and ν are defined).  
 
Proof: Assume µ ⊂ ν and µ(0) = ν(0) (0 is the zero of the near-field P in R). If x ∈ Pµ 
then ν(x) ≥ µ(x) = µ(0) = ν(0), noting ν(x) ≤ ν(0) for all x ∈ P ⊂ R we have ν(x) = 
ν(0) hence x ∈ Pν. Hence the claim.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.9: A S-fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup µ of a S-near-ring R is          
S-normal if and only if µ+ = µ.  
 
Proof: Using the definition the proof is straightforward, hence left for the reader as an 
exercise.  

 
378
 
THEOREM 6.1.10: If µ is a S-fuzzy right (resp. left) R-subgroup of a S-near-ring R 
then (µ+)+ = µ+.  
 
Proof: For any x ∈ P ⊂ R relative to which µ is defined we have (µ+)+(x) = (µ+(x)) + 
1 – µ+(0) = µ+(x). Hence the claim.  
 
Note: If we change the near-field P from P to say P1 and µ is not defined relative to P1 
then the above result is not true unless otherwise µ is a S-strong fuzzy subgroup. 
Further even if x ∈ R \ P the result may not in general be true as all the axioms by µ 
are satisfied only in P and not on the whole of R. Several other interesting results in 
this direction can be defined and proved by any reader. Since when we define µ a         
S-fuzzy R-subgroup or σ a S-fuzzy right (resp. left) near-ring module we do not 
demand in any way µ or σ to be completely well defined on the whole of the S-near-
ring R what we only expect is that µ or σ is defined on the proper subsets P in R 
where P is a near-field. In this way all results will be distinct and different from fuzzy 
near-ring modules and fuzzy R-subgroups.  
 
Only when µ : R → [0, 1] happen to be well defined on R and on every proper subset 
P in R which is a near field we will have the coincidence of fuzzy and S-fuzzy 
concept.  
 
Now using the results of [28] we give the definition of S-fuzzy congruence of a near-
ring module which is slightly different from the definitions of [71]. 
  
DEFINITION 6.1.51: Let µ-be a non-empty subset of a S-R-module M of a S-near ring 
R. Then µ is said to be Smarandache fuzzy submodule (S-fuzzy module) of M if 
 
i. µ(x + y) ≥ M in {µ (x), µ(y)} for all x, y ∈ M. 
ii. µ(–x) = µ (x) ∀ x ∈ M. 
iii. µ (y + x – y) = µ (y) for all x, y ∈ M. 
iv. µ ((x + y) r – x r ≥ µ (y) for all x, y ∈ M and r ∈ P ⊂ R . 
 
P is the subnear field of the S-near ring relative to which the S-R-module M is 
defined.  
 
The following results are direct by the very definition.  
 
THEOREM 6.1.11: Let µ be a S-fuzzy submodule of a S-R-module M. Then the level 
subset µt = {x ∈ M | µ (x) ≥ t}; t ∈ Im µ is a S-sub module of M. 
 
(Hint: µ is a S-fuzzy submodule of a S-R-module M. Then the S-submodule µt’s are 
called the S-level submodule of M). 
 
THEOREM 6.1.12: Let µ be a S-fuzzy normal subgroup of M. Then x + µ = µ + x if 
and only if µ (x – y) = µ (0) for all x, y in M. 
 
Proof: Here M is a S-R-module of the S-near ring R. The proof is direct by the 
definition. 

 
379
 
DEFINITION 6.1.52: Let M be a S-R-module µ be a S-fuzzy submodule of M. M / µ = 
{all fuzzy cosets of µ with operations (x + µ) + (y + µ) = (x + y) + µ and ( x + µ) r = 
xr + µ for all x, y ∈ M and for all r ∈ P; P a proper subset of R which is a near field 
under the operations of R}, M / µ is defined as the Smarandache fuzzy quotient          
R-module (S-fuzzy quotient R-module) of M over the S-fuzzy submodule µ. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.53: Let M be a S-R-module. A non-empty fuzzy relation on M i.e. a 
mapping α from M × M → [0, 1] is called the Smarandache fuzzy equivalence 
relation (S-fuzzy equivalence relation) that is a fuzzy equivalence relation α defined 
on a S-R-module will be called as a S-fuzzy equivalence relation. A S-fuzzy 
equivalence relation α on an S-R-module M is called a Smarandache fuzzy 
congruence (S-fuzzy congruence) if α (a + c, b + d) ≥  Min [α (a, b), α (c, d)] and       
α (ar, br) ≥ α (a, b) for all a, b, c, d  in  M and for all r ∈ P ⊂ R (P is the proper 
subset in the S-near ring R relative to which the S-R-module M is defined). Let α be a 
S-fuzzy relation on a S-R-module M. For each t ∈ [0, 1] the set α t = {(a, b) ∈ M × R | 
α (a, b) ≥ t} is called the Smarandache level relation (S-level relation) of α. 
 
Now we proceed on to define the concept of Smarandache fuzzy seminear ring for the 
first time. Before we define Smarandache fuzzy seminear ring we will first define the 
concept of fuzzy seminear rings and its properties. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.54: Let T be a seminear ring. N a fuzzy set in T. Then N is called a 
fuzzy seminear ring in N if 
 
i. N(x + y) ≥ min {N(x), N(y)}. 
ii. N(xy) ≥ min {N (x), N(y)}. 
 
We now define the concept of fuzzy seminear-ring module. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.55: Let T be a seminear ring. N a fuzzy seminear ring in T. Let Y be a 
seminear ring module over T and M, a fuzzy set in Y. Then M is called a fuzzy 
seminear ring module in Y if 
 
i. M (x + y) ≥ min {M(x), M(y)}. 
ii. M (λ x) ≥ min {N(λ), M(x)} for all x, y ∈ Y and for all λ ∈ t. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.56: Let (T, +, y) be a seminear ring. A fuzzy subset µ in T is called a 
fuzzy right (resp. left) T-subsemigroup of T if 
 
i. µ is a fuzzy subsemigroup of (T, +). 
ii. µ(xr) ≥ µ(x) (resp. µ(rx) ≥ µ(x)) for all x, r ∈ T. 
 
THEOREM 6.1.13: Let µ be a fuzzy right (resp. left) T-subsemigroup of a seminear 
ring T then the set Tµ = {x ∈ T / µ(x) = µ (0)} is a right (resp. left) R subsemigroup of 
T. 
 
Proof: Straightforward by the definition. 
 

 
380
DEFINITION 6.1.57: Let µ be a nonempty fuzzy subset of a T-semimodule M. Then µ is 
said to be a fuzzy semisubmodule of M if  
 
i. 
µ(x + y) ≥ M in [µ (x), µ(y)]. 
ii. 
µ((x + y) r + xr)) ≥ µ(y) 
 
for all x, y in M and r in T. 
 
On similar lines we can define fuzzy equivalence relation and fuzzy congruence on G 
an T-semimodule over a seminear ring T. 
 
If G is a T-semimodule. A non empty fuzzy relation α on G is a mapping α : G × G → 
[0, 1] is called a fuzzy equivalence relation if 
 
α (x, x) = sup
G
z,y ∈
α (y, z) for all x, y, z in G. 
 
α (x, y) = α (y, x) for all x, y in G 
 
α (x, y) ≥  sup
G
z,y ∈
 [Min (α (x z), α (z, y)] x, y ∈ G for all x, y in G. 
 
A fuzzy equivalence relation α on an T-semimodule G is called fuzzy congruence if 
α(a + c, b + d) ≥ M in [α (a, b), α (c, d)] and α (ar, br) ≥ α (a, b) for all a, b, c, d in 
G and for all r in T. 
 
THEOREM 6.1.14: Let α be a fuzzy congruence on a T-semimodule G and µα be the 
fuzzy subsemimodule induced by α. Let t ∈ Im α. Then (µα)t = { x ∈ G / x ≡ 0 (αt)} is 
the subsemimodule induced by the congruence αt. 
 
Proof: Let a ∈ G. Now a ∈ (µa)t ⇔ (µα) (a) ≥ t ⇔ α (a, 0) ≥ t ⇔ (a, 0) t, αt ⇔ a ≡ 
0(αt) ⇔ a ∈ {x ∈ G | x ≡ 0 (αt)}. Hence the result. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.58: Let G be a T-semimodule and α be a fuzzy congruence on G. A 
fuzzy congruence µ on G. A fuzzy congruence β on G is said to  be α - invariant if 
α(x, y) ≡α (υ, ν) implies β (x, y) = β (υ, ν) for  all (x, y), (υ, ν) ∈ G × G. 
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache fuzzy seminear rings. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.59: Let R be a S-seminear ring. A fuzzy subset µ on R is said to be a 
Smarandache fuzzy seminear ring (S-fuzzy seminear-ring) if µ : P → [0, 1] is a           
S-fuzzy semiring where P ⊂ R and P is a semiring.  
 
We can define S-fuzzy seminear ring yet in another way. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.60: Let R be a S-seminear ring. A fuzzy subset µ of R is said to be a 
Smarandache fuzzy seminear ring (S-fuzzy seminear ring) if  
 

 
381
µ(x + y) ≥ µ(x) + µ(y) 
µ(–x) ≥ µ(x) 
µ(xy) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)}  
 
for all x, y ∈ N ⊂ R where N a proper subset of R is a near ring in R. 
 
The S-fuzzy seminear ring II definition will be distinguished from the other S-fuzzy 
seminear ring definition by denoting it as S-fuzzy seminear ring II. 
 
In case of S-fuzzy seminear ring II all definitions and results proved in case of fuzzy 
near rings can be easily transformed into S-fuzzy seminear rings II.  
 
Now we define Smarandache fuzzy seminear ring semimodule II. 
 
DEFINITION 6.1.61: Let R be a S-seminear ring with P a proper subset of R which is a 
near ring and N a fuzzy near ring in P. Let Y be a near ring module over P and M a 
fuzzy set in Y. Then M is called the Smarandache fuzzy seminear ring semimodule (S- 
fuzzy seminear ring semimodule) in Y if  
 
i. M(x + y) ≥ min {M(x) , M(y)}. 
ii. M(λx) ≥ min {N(λ) , M(x)} for all x, y ∈ Y for all λ ∈ P. 
iii. M(0) = 1. 
 
The following theorem is direct. 
 
THEOREM 6.1.15: Let Y be a S-seminear ring semimodule over a S-seminear ring R 
with identity. If M is a S-fuzzy seminear ring semimodule in Y and if λ ∈ P ⊂ R         
(Y defined as module over the near ring P contained in R) is invertible then M(λx) = 
M(x) for all x ∈ y. 
 
Proof: As in case of S-near rings using the definition the result is got as a matter of 
routine.  
 
Several other results can be defined for S-seminear rings and extended for S-fuzzy 
seminear ring of many other levels which we defined in [130]. The reader is advised 
to go through the results in [130] and obtain some more interesting results about these 
structures.  
 
 
6.2 Smarandache Non-associative Fuzzy near-ring 
 
In this section we just recall the definition of S-non-associative seminear-ring and 
their Smarandache fuzzy analogues. Also we proceed on to define Smarandache non-
associative near-rings and their Smarandache fuzzy analogue. We derive some 
interesting results about them.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.1: Let (N, ‘+’, ‘y’) be a non-empty set endowed with two binary 
operation ‘+’ and ‘y’ satisfying the following: 
 

 
382
i. 
(N, +) is a semigroup. 
ii. 
(N, y) is a groupoid. 
iii. 
(a + b) c = a y c + b y c for all a, b, c ∈ N; (N, ‘+’, ‘y’) is called the 
right seminear-ring which is non-associative.  
 
If we replace (c) by a y (b + c) = a y b + a y c for all a, b, c ∈ N. Then (N, ‘+’, ‘y’) is 
a non-associative left seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.2: Let (N, +, y) be a seminear-ring which is not associative. A subset 
P of N is said to be a subseminear-ring if (P, +, y) is a seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.3: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring. An additive 
subsemigroup A of N is called the N-subsemigroup (right N-subsemigroup) if NA ⊆ A 
(AN ⊂ A) where NA = {na / n ∈ N, a ∈ A}. 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.4: A non-empty subset I of N is called left ideal in N if  
 
i. 
(I, +) is a normal subsemigroup of (N, +). 
ii. 
n (n1 + i) + nn1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I, n, n1 ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.5: Let N be a non-associative seminear-ring. A nonempty subset I of 
N is called an ideal in N if  
 
i.I is a left ideal.  
ii.IN ⊂ I. 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.6: A non-associative seminear-ring N is called left bipotent if Na = 
Na2 for a in N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.7: A non-associative seminear-ring N is said to be a s-seminear-ring 
if a ∈ Na for each a in N.  
 
The following definitions about strictly prime ideals would be of interest when we 
develop Smarandache notions.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.8: An ideal P (≠ N) is called strictly prime if for any two N-
subsemigroups A and B of N such that AB ⊂ P then A ⊂ P or B ⊂ P.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.9: An ideal B of a non-associative (NA for short) seminear-ring N is 
called strictly essential if B ∩ K ≠ {0} for every non-zero N-subsemigroup K of N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.10: An element x in N is said to be singular if there exists a non-zero 
strictly essential left ideal A in N such that Ax = {0}.  
 
Several other analogous results existing in near-rings and seminear-rings can also be 
defined for non-associative seminear-rings. Now we proceed on to define 
Smarandache notions.  
 

 
383
DEFINITION 6.2.11: Let (N, +, y) be a non associative seminear-ring. N is said be a 
Smarandache non associative seminear-ring of level I (S-NA seminear-ring I) if  
 
i. (N, +) is a S-semigroup.  
ii. (N, y) is a S-groupoid.  
iii. (a + b) c = a y c + b y c for all a, b, c ∈ N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.12: Let (N, +, y) be a non-associative seminear-ring. N is said to 
have a Smarandache subseminear-ring (S-subseminear-ring) P ⊂ N if P is itself a     
S-seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.13: Let (N, +, y) be a non-associative seminear-ring. An additive      
S-subsemigroup A of N is called the Smarandache left N-subsemigroup (S-N-left 
subsemigroup) (right N-subsemigroup) if NA ⊂ A (AN ⊂ A) where Na = {na / n ∈ N, 
a ∈ A}.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.14: A non-empty subset I of N is called Smarandache left ideal (S-left 
ideal) in N if  
 
i. (I, +) is a normal S-subsemigroup of (N, +).  
ii. n (n1 + i) + nn1 ∈ I for each i ∈ I, n, n1 ∈ N. 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.15: Let N be a NA-seminear-ring. A nonempty subset I of N is called 
a Smarandache ideal (S-ideal) in N if  
 
i. I is a S-left ideal.  
ii. IN ⊂ I.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.16: A S-NA-seminear-ring N is called Smarandache left bipotent      
(S-left bipotent) if Na = Na2 for every a in N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.17: Let (N, +, y) be a NA seminear-ring. N is said to be a 
Smarandache seminear-ring I of type A (S-seminear-ring I of type A) if N has a 
proper subset P such that (P, +, y) is an associative seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.18: Let N be a NA-seminear-ring. N is said to be a Smarandache NA 
seminear-ring I of type B  (S-NA seminear-ring I of type B) if N has a proper subset P 
where P is a near-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.19: Let N and N1 be two S-seminear-rings; we say a map φ from N to 
N1 is a Smarandache non-associative seminear ring homomorphism (S-NA seminear-
ring homomorphism) if  
 
 
φ (x + y) = φ (x) + φ (y)  
 
φ (xy) = φ (x) φ (y)  
 
for all x, y ∈ N.  
 
 

 
384
DEFINITION 6.2.20: Let (N, +, y) be a NA seminear-ring, we say N is a Smarandache 
NA seminear-ring II (S-NA-seminear-ring II) if N has a proper subset P which is a 
associative seminear-ring.  
 
THEOREM 6.2.1: Let N be a S-NA seminear-ring II then N is a S-NA-seminear-ring I 
of type A.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definition. Now using the S-mixed direct product 
definition of seminear-rings we can extend it to the case of non-associative seminear-
rings. This method will help to build a class of S-NA seminear-rings of type II.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.21: Let N be a S-NA seminear-ring II. An additive S-semigroup A of 
N is said to be a S-left N subsemigroup (right-N subsemigroup) if PA ⊂ A and          
(AP ⊂ A). where P is a proper subset of N and P is a seminear-ring which is 
associative. PA = {pa / p ∈ P and a ∈ A}.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.22: Let N and N1 be any two S-NA-seminear-rings A mapping φ  from 
N to N1 is called a Smarandache-NA seminear-ring homomorphism (S-NA seminear-
ring homomorphism) if φ maps every p ∈ P ⊂ N (p a associative seminear-ring-
associative) into a unique element φ (p) ∈ P1 ⊂ N1 where P1 is an associative 
seminear-ring such that φ (p + p1) = φ (p) + φ (p1) and φ (p1 p2) = φ (p1) φ (p2) for 
every p1 , p2 ∈ P ⊆  N.  
 
It is important to note that φ need not be defined on the whole of N it is sufficient if φ 
is defined on a subset P of N where P is an associative seminear-ring. Thus if P ⊂ N 
and P1 ⊂ N1 and φ : N → N1 is such that φ is one to one and on to from P to P1 the 
two S NA seminear-rings would become isomorphic even if they are not having same 
number of elements in them.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.23: Let N be a S-NA-seminear-ring. An additive S-semigroup A of N 
is said to be a Smarandache left ideal (S-left ideal) of N if it is an ideal of the 
semigroup (N, +) with the conditions.  
 
 
p1 (p2 + a) – p1 p2 ∈ A for each a ∈ A; p1, p2 ∈ P ⊂ N; P a seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.24: A subset I of N is called a S-ideal if it is a S-left ideal and IP ⊂ I 
where P ⊂ N is the associative seminear-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.25: A S-NA seminear-ring N has Smarandache IFP (S-IFP) (insertion 
of factor property) if for a, b ∈ P, ab = 0 implies a.p.B = 0 for all p ∈ P ⊂ N since N 
is non-associative we have to restrict our selves only to the associative substructure to 
define IFP property as a (nb) ≠ (an) b in general for all a, n, b ∈ N.  
 
Now we proceed onto define Smarandache fuzzy seminear-rings and its properties.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.26: Let N be a S-non-associative seminear-ring µ : N → [0, 1] be a 
fuzzy subset of N such that if µ : P → [0, 1] is a Smarandache fuzzy seminear-ring   
(S-fuzzy seminear-ring) where P is a proper subset of N which is a S-seminear-ring 

 
385
under the operations of N. Then we call µ a Smarandache fuzzy non-associative 
seminear-ring (S-fuzzy non-associative seminear-ring) of N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.27: Let R be a S-non-associative seminear-ring. N a fuzzy seminear-
ring of R. Let Y be a S-seminear-ring semimodule over R. M a fuzzy set in Y. Then M 
is called a Smarandache fuzzy non-associative seminear-ring semimodule (S-fuzzy 
non-associative seminear-ring semimodule) (or just module) in Y if  
 
i. 
M(x + y) ≥ min{M(x), M(y)}. 
ii. 
M(λx) ≥ min{N(λ), M(x)}. 
 
for all x, y ∈ Y, λ ∈ P ⊂ R. P is the near-ring over which the module Y is defined.  
 
All properties enjoyed by S-fuzzy seminear-rings and S-fuzzy near-rings can be 
transferred in to the definitions of S-fuzzy non-associative seminear-ring with 
appropriate modifications. As we have given all Smarandache properties about non-
associative seminear-rings it would be easy for any reader to define the Smarandache 
fuzzy analogue for them. Now we proceed on to define some properties about 
Smarandache non-associative near-ring thereby paving way for the definition and 
study of Smarandache fuzzy non-associative near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.28: The system N = (N, ‘+’, ‘y’, 0) is called a Smarandache right 
loop half groupoid near-ring (S-right loop half groupoid near-ring) provided.  
 
i. 
(N, +, 0) is a Smarandache loop.  
 
ii. 
(N, 'y') is a half groupoid.  
 
iii. 
(n1 y  n2 ) y  n3  =  n1 y (n2 y  n3 )  for  all  n1 , n2 , n3  ∈  N for which 
n1 y  n2, n2 y n3, (n1 y n2) y n3 and n1 y (n2 y n3) ∈ N.  
 
iv. 
(n1 + n2) n3 = n1 y n3 + n2 y n3  for all  n1, n2, n3  ∈  N  for which    
(n1 + n2) y n3, n1 y n3 , n2 y n3 ∈ N. If instead of (iv) in N the 
identity n1 y (n2 + n3) = n1 y n2 + n1 y n3 is satisfied then we say N 
is a Smarandache left half groupoid near-ring (S-left half groupoid 
near-ring).  
 
We just say (L, +) is a S-loop if L has a proper subset P such that (P, +) is an additive 
group.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.29: A Smarandache right loop near-ring (S-right loop near-ring) N is 
a system (N, +,  y) of double composition ‘+’ and ‘y’ such that

THEOREM 6.2.2: Let N be a S-right loop near-ring then N is a S-right loop half 
groupoid near-ring.  
 
Proof: Obvious by the very definitions.  
 
THEOREM 6.2.3: Let N be a S-right loop half groupoid near-ring, then N is not in 
general a S-right loop near-ring. 
 
Proof: Obvious. (N, y) is only a half groupoid so it can never be a S-semigroup.

DEFINITION 6.2.42: Let N be a non-associative S-near-ring we say N is Smarandache 
weakly divisible (S-weakly divisble) if for all x, y ∈ N there exists a z ∈ P; P ⊂ N 
where P is an associative ring or P is a near-field such that xz = y or zx = y.

z ∈ P, P ⊂ N where P is an associative seminear-ring such that xz = y or zx = y.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.44: Let N be a S-quasi near-ring (S-quasi seminear-ring). We say N 
is Smarandache quasi weakly divisible (S-quasi weakly divisible) if for all x, y ∈ N 
there exists z ∈ R; R a ring R ⊂ N (R a semiring R ⊂ N) such that xz = y or yz = x.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.45: Let P be a seminear pseudo ring (SNP-ring) we say P is a 
Smarandache SNP-ring I (S-SNP-ring I) if P has a proper subset T ⊂ P such that T is 
a seminear-ring. Smarandache SNP-ring II (S-SNP-ring II) if P has a proper subset   
R ⊂ P such that R is a near-ring. Smarandache SNP-ring III (S-SNP-ring III) if P has 
a proper W ⊂ P such (W, ⊕, ) is a semiring. Thus we have 3 levels of S-SNP rings. 
A Smarandache SNP subring (S-SNP subring) is defined as a proper subset U of P 
such that (U, ⊕, ) is a S-SNP-ring.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.46: Let (P, ⊕, ) be a SNP-ring. A proper subset I of P is called a 
Smarandache SNP- ideal (S-SNP-ideal) if   
 
i. 
for all p, q ∈ I, p ⊕  q ∈ I. 
ii. 
0 ∈ I. 
iii. 
For all p ∈ I and r ∈ P we have p  r or r  p ∈ I. 
iv. 
I is a S-SNP-ring. 
 

 
388
DEFINITION 6.2.47: Let (R, ⊕, ) be a quasi SNP-ring. R is said to be a 
Smarandache quasi SNP-rings (S-quasi SNP-ring) if and only if R is a S-SNP-ring. 
 
DEFINITION 6.2.48: Let (R, ⊕, ) and (R1, ⊕, ) be any two S-SNP-ring, we say a 
map φ is a Smarandache SNP-homomorphism I (II or III) (S-SNP homomorphism I, II 
or III) if φ: S to S1 where S ⊂ R and S1 ⊂ R1 are seminear-ring (or near-ring or 
semiring) respectively and φ is a seminear-ring homomorphism from S to S1
  (or near-
ring homomorphism from S to S1 or a semiring homomorphism from S to S1). φ need 
not be defined on the entire set R or R1 it is sufficient if it is well defined on S to S1.  
 
Now we proceed on to define Smarandache right quasi regular element. We just 
recall that an element x ∈ R, R a ring is said to be right quasi regular if there exist     
y ∈ R such that x o y = x + y – xy = 0 and left quasi regular if there exist y1 ∈ R such 
that y1 o x = 0 = y1 + x – y1x.  
 
Quasi regular if it is right and left quasi regular simultaneously. We say an element   
x ∈ R is Smarandache right quasi regular (S-right quasi regular) if there exist y and  
z ∈ R such that x o y = x + y – xy = 0, x o z = x + z – xz = 0 but y o z = y + z – yz ≠ 0 
and z o y = y + z – zx ≠ 0.  
 
Similarly we define Smarandache left quasi regular (S-left quasi regular) and x will 
be Smarandache quasi regular (S-quasi regular) if it is simultaneously S-right quasi 
regular and S-left quasi regular.  
 
Using these definitions the reader can define the Smarandache fuzzy analogue of 
them. Just for the sake to interest the reader we give a few definitions here.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.49: Let N be a S-non-associative near-ring. A fuzzy subset µ : N → 
[0, 1]  is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy non-associative near-ring (S-fuzzy non-
associative near-ring) if µ (x + y) ≥  min {µ (x), µ (y)}, µ (–x) ≥ µ (x), µ (xy) ≥         
min{µ (x), µ (y)}  for all x, y ∈ P, P a proper subset of N and P is an associative near-
ring or a near-field.  
 
Thus we in case of S-fuzzy non-associative near-rings do not demand that µ be 
defined on the whole of the S-non-associative near-ring N, it is enough if µ is defined 
on a proper subset of N which is an associative near-ring or a near-field. Thus having 
defined the notion of S-na-fuzzy near-ring our interest would be for a given S-na-
near-ring N; how many S-na-fuzzy near-rings can be defined.   
 
DEFINITION 6.2.50: Let N be a S-na-near-ring. Let µ be a fuzzy subset of N i.e. µ : N 
→ [0, 1]. µ is said to be a Smarandache strongly fuzzy non-associative near-ring    
(S-strongly fuzzy non-associative near-ring) if µ is a S-fuzzy non-associative near-
ring if for every proper subset P in N where P is a near-field.  
 
THEOREM 6.2.4: Let N be a S-non-associative near-ring. If µ : N → [0, 1] is a              
S-strongly fuzzy non-associative near-ring then µ is a S-fuzzy non-associative near-
ring.  
 

 
389
Proof: Straightforward by the very definitions and hence left for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 6.2.51: Let R be a S-non-associative near-ring and N a S-fuzzy-na-near-
ring in R. Let Y be a S-non-associative near-ring module over R and M a fuzzy set in 
Y. Then M is called a S-fuzzy na-near-ring module in Y if  
 
i. 
M(x + y)  ≥  Min{M(x), M(y)}. 
ii. 
M(λx)  ≥  Min{N(λ), M(x). 
iii. 
M(0) = 1  
 
for all x, y ∈ Y and λ ∈ P ⊂ R where P is a proper subset of R and P is an associative 
near-ring or a near-field.  
 
THEOREM 6.2.5: Let {Mi / i ∈ I} be a family of S-fuzzy non-associative near-ring 
modules relative to a fixed associative subnear-ring P in R, all the Mi's are defined in 
Y. Then  I

Several other properties can be defined and studied in case of S-fuzzy na-near-rings.  
 
 
6.3 Smarandache Fuzzy Binear-rings 
 
In this section we introduce just the notions of Smarandache fuzzy binear-rings, 
Smarandache fuzzy biseminear-rings, Smarandache non-associative binear-rings and 
Smarandache non-associative biseminear-rings and their Smarandache fuzzy 
analogues. Several results in this direction are given.  
 
DEFINITION 6.3.1: Let (N, +, y) be a binear-ring. (N = N1 ∪ N2 ). We say N is a 
Smarandache binear-ring (S-binear-ring) if N contains a proper subset P such that P 
under the operations '+' and 'y' is a binear field; i.e., (P = P1 ∪ P2 , +, y) is a binear 
field. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.2: Let (N, +, y) be a binear-ring. A proper subset P of N is said to be 
a Smarandache subbinear-ring (S-subbinear-ring) if P itself is a S-binear-ring. 
 

 
390
DEFINITION 6.3.3: Let P be a S-bisemigroup with 0 and let N be a S-binear-ring. A 
map µ: N × Y → Y where Y is a proper subset of P which is a bigroup under the 
operations of P, (P, µ) is called the Smarandache N-bigroup (S-N-bigroup) if for all   
y ∈ Y and for all n, nl ∈ N we have (n + nl )y = ny + nly and (nnl ) y = n(nl y). S ( N 
P ) 
stands for the S-N-bigroups. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.4: A S-bisemigroup M of the binear-ring N is called a Smarandache 
quasi sub-binear-ring (S-quasi sub-binear-ring) of N if X ⊂ M where X is a 
bisubgroup of M which is such that XX ⊂ X. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.5: A S-sub-bisemigroup Y of S( N P) with NY ⊂ Y is said to be a 
Smarandache N-sub-bigroup (S-N-sub-bigroup) of P. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.6: Let N and N' be two S-binear-rings P and P' be S-N-sub-bigroups 
 
i. 
h : N → N' is called a Smarandache binear-ring 
homomorphism (S-binear-ring homomorphism) if for all m, n ∈ M we have h 
(m + n) = h(m) + h(n), h(mn) = h(m)h(n) where h(m), h(n) ∈ M' (M' is a 
proper subset of N' which is a binearfield). It is to be noted that h need not 
even be defined on whole of N.  
 
ii. 
h : P → P' is called the Smarandache N-sub-bigroup 
homomorphism (S-N-sub-bigroup homomorphism) if for all p, q in S (S the 
proper subset of P which is a S-N-sub-bigroup of the S-bisemigroup P) and 
for all m ∈  M ⊂  N (M a nearfield of N); h(p + q) = h(p) + h(q) and h(mp) 
= mh(p), h(p), h(q) and mh(p) ∈ S' (S' is a proper subset of P' which is S-N'-
sub-bigroup of S-bisemigroup P'). 
 
Here also we do not demand h to be defined on whole of P. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.7: Let (N, +, y) be a S-binear-ring. A normal sub-bigroup I of (N, +) 
is called a Smarandache bi-ideal (S-bi-ideal) of N related to X, where X is a 
binearfield contained in N if (X = X1 ∪ X2, X1 and X2 are near fields). 
 
i. 
I1 X1 ⊂ I1 ; I2 X2  ⊂  I2 where I = I1 ∪ I2 . 
ii. 
∀ xi , yi ∈ Xi and for all ki ∈ Ii, xi (yi + ki) – xiyi ∈ Ii ; i = 1, 2. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.8: A proper subset S of P is called a S-bi-ideal of S(N 
P) related toY if  
 
i. 
S is a S-normal sub-bigroup of the S-bisemigroup.  
ii. 
For all s1 ∈ S and s ∈ Y and for all m ∈ M (M the binear field of N),         
n(s + s1 ) – ns ∈ S.  
 
A S-binear-ring is S-bi-ideal if it has no S-bi-ideals. S(N P) is called Smarandache     
N-bisimple (S-N-bisimple) if it has no S-normal sub-bigroups expect 0 and P. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.9: A S-sub-binear-ring M of a binear-ring N is called Smarandache 
bi-invariant (S-bi-invariant) related to the binearfield X in N if MX ⊂ M and XM ⊂ M 
where X is a S-binear field of N. Thus in case of Smarandache bi-invariance (S-bi-

 
391
invariance) it is only a relative concept as a S-sub-binear-ring M may not be 
invariant related to every binear field in the binear-ring N. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.10: The binear-ring N is said to fulfill the Smarandache left ore 
condition (S-left ore condition) with respect to a given S-sub-bisemigroup P of (N, y) 
if for (s, n) ∈ S × N there exists n y s1 = s y n1 (s1 y n = n1y s). 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.11: Let S(BV) denote the set of all Smarandache binear-rings. A       
S-binear-ring FX ∈ S(BV) is called a Smarandache free binear-ring (S-free binear-
ring) in BV over X if there exists f : X → FX  and for all N ∈ BV and for all g : X → N 
there exists a S-binear-ring homomorphism h ∈ S(Hom FX  , N) such that h o f = g. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.12: A finite sequence N = N0 ⊃ N1 ⊃ N2 ⊃ … ⊃ Nt = {0} of S-sub-
binear-rings Ni of N is called a Smarandache normal sequence (S-normal sequence) 
of N if and only if for all i ∈ {1, 2, … , n}, Ni is an S-bi-ideal of Ni–1. In the special 
case that all Ni is an S-bi-ideal of N then we call the normal sequence a Smarandache 
bi-invariant sequence (S-bi-invariant sequence) and t is called the Smarandache 
length (S-length) of the sequence Ni–1 /Ni are called the Smarandache bi-factors (S-bi-
factors) of the sequence as

DEFINITION 6.3.13: Let P be a S-bi-ideal of the binear-ring N. P is called 
Smarandache prime bi-ideal (S-prime bi-ideal) if for all S-ideals I and J of N, IJ ⊂ P 
implies I ⊂ P or J ⊂ P. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.14: Let P be a S-left bi-ideal of a binear-ring N. P is called 
Smarandache bimodular (S-bimodular) if and only if there exists a S-idempotent        
e ∈ N and for all n ∈ N; n – ne ∈ P. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.15: Let N be a binear-ring (N = N1 ∪ N2). z ∈ N is called 
Smarandache quasi regular (S-quasi regular)  if  z ∈  S(LZ )  where  S(LZ ) = {n1 – n1 z 
| n1 ∈ N1} ∪ {n2 – n2 z | n2 ∈ N2}. An S-bi-ideal P ⊂ N is called S-quasi regular if and 
only if for all s ∈ Ps is S-quasi regular. An S-bi-ideal P is a Smarandache bi-
principal bi-ideal (S-bi-principal bi-ideal) if P = P1 ∪ P2 and each of P1 and P2 are 
S-principal ideals of N1 and N2 where N = N1 ∪ N2 is a binear-ring. A binear-ring N 
is Smarandache biregular (S-biregular) if there exists some set E of central               
S-idempotents with  
 
i. 
For all e ∈ N, Ne is a S-bi-ideal of N. 
ii. 
For all n ∈ N there exists e ∈ E; Ne = (n). 
iii. 
For all e, f ∈ E, e + f = f + e. 
iv. 
For all e, f ∈ E, ef and e + f – ef ∈ E. 
 
Now we define Smarandache binear-ring of level II. 

 
392
 
DEFINITION 6.3.16: Let N be a binear-ring. We say N is a Smarandache binear-ring 
of level II (S-binear-ring of level II) if N contains a proper subset P such that P is a 
biring under the operations of N. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.17: Let (N, +, y) be a biseminear-ring. We say N is a Smarandache 
biseminear-ring (S-biseminear-ring) if N contains a proper subset P, such that P is a 
binear-ring under the operations of N. We call this S-biseminear-ring a S-biseminear-
ring of level I. 
 
Now we define Smarandache biseminear-ring of level II. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.18: Let (N, +, y) be a seminear-ring. We call N a Smarandache 
biseminear-ring of level II (S-biseminear-ring of level II) if N contains a proper 
subset P, such that P under the operations of N is a bisemiring. 
 
We can obtain classes of S-biseminear-ring II by defining a Smarandache mixed 
direct product of a bisemirings, i.e., W = V × Z where V = V1 ∪ V2 is a biseminear-
ring and Z = Z1 ∪ Z2 is a bisemiring. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.19: Let N be a S-binear-ring. N is said to fulfill the Smarandache bi-
insertions factors property (S-bi-insertions factors property) if for all a, b ∈ N = N1 ∪ 
N2 we have a y b = 0 implies anb = 0 for all n ∈ P, P ⊂ N is a P-binear field. (if a, b 
∈ N1 then for all n ∈ P2 we have ab = 0 implies anb = 0 and if a, b ∈ N2 with ab = 0, 
then ∀ n ∈ P2 we have anb = 0). 
 
We say the S-binear-ring satisfies the Smarandache strong bi-insertion factors 
property (S-strong bi-insertion factors property) if for all a, b ∈ Ni (N = N1 ∪ N2), ab 
∈ Ii (I = I1 ∪ I2 a S-bi-ideal of N) implies anb ∈ Ii where n ∈ Pi (P ⊂ N, P a binear-
ring with P = P1 ∪ P2 ); i = 1, 2. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.20: Let p be a prime. A S-binear-ring N is called a Smarandache p-
binear-ring (S-p-binear-ring) provided for all x ∈ Pi , x p = x and px = 0, where P =  
P1 ∪ P2, P ⊂ N; P is a bisemifield. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.21: Let N be a binear-ring. A S-right bi-ideal I of N is called 
Smarandache right biquasi reflexive (S-right biquasi reflexive) if whenever A and B 
are S-bi-ideals of N with AB ⊂ I, then b(b' + a ) – bb' ∈ I for all a ∈ A and for all b, b' 
∈ B. A binear-ring N is Smarandache strongly bi-subcommutative (S-strongly bi-
commutative) if every S-right bi-ideal of it is S-right biquasi reflexive. Let N be a 
binear-ring P a S-subnormal bi-subgroup of (N, +). P is called Smarandache quasi 
bi-ideal (S-quasi bi-ideal) of N if PN ⊂ P and NP ⊂ P where by NP we mean elements 
of the from {n(n' + s) – nn' for all s ∈ P and for all n, n' ∈ N} = NP. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.22: Let (R, +, y) be a S-biring and M a S-right R-bimodule. Let W = 
R × M and define (a, s)  (β, t) = (αβ, sβ + t). Then (W, +, ) is a S-left binear-ring 
the abstract Smarandache affine binear-ring (S-affine binear-ring) inducted by R and 
M. All other notions introduced for bi-ideals can also be defined and extended in case 
of bi-R-modules. 

 
393
 
DEFINITION 6.3.23: Let N and N' be any two S-biseminear-rings. We say a map φ 
from N to N' is a Smarandache biseminear-ring homomorphism (S-biseminear-ring 
homomorphism) from A to A' where A ⊂ N and A' ⊂ N' is a binear-ring if φ (x + y) = 
φ (x)φ (y), φ (xy) = φ (x)φ (y) where x, y ∈ Ai ; i = 1, 2; and φ (x), φ (y) ∈ A'1; i = 1, 2.  
 
Thus for a Smarandache biseminear-ring homomorphism we do not require φ to be 
defined on whole of N, it is sufficient if it is defined on a proper near-ring A which is a 
subset of N. We say the biseminear-ring N is a Smarandache strict biseminear-ring if 
the subset A ⊂ N where A is a strict bisemiring. 
 
So we can define Smarandache biseminear-ring homomorphism II between two S-
biseminear-rings N and N' as φ : N → N' is a S-biseminear-ring homomorphism, φ : A 
→ A' where A and A' are bisemirings contained in N and N' respectively is a 
bisemiring homomorphism. Clearly as in case of S-homomorphism I. φ need not in 
general be defined on the whole of N.  
 
DEFINITION 6.3.24: Let N be a Smarandache pseudo biseminear-ring (S-pseudo 
biseminear-ring) if N is a binear-ring and has proper subset A of N, which is a

DEFINITION 6.3.47: Let (N = N1 ∪ N2 , +, y) be a S-binear-ring A fuzzy subset µ : N 
→ [0, 1] is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy binear-ring (S-fuzzy binear-ring) if µ =    
µ1  ∪  µ2 : N1 ∪ N2 → [0, 1] satisfies the following conditions.  
 
i. 
µ1 : N1 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy near-ring and  
ii. 
µ2 : N2 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy ring or S-fuzzy near-ring. 
 
DEFINITION 6.3.48: Let (N, +, y) be a S-binear-ring. A fuzzy subset µ : N →  [0, 1] is

µ(xr) ≥ µ(x) [resp. µ(rx) > µ(x)] for all r, x ∈ P = P1 ∪ P2 ⊂ N1 ∪ N2, the 
proper subset of N which is a binear-field.  
 
THEOREM 6.3.1: If µ is a S-fuzzy right (respectively left) N-sub-bigroup of a S-binear-
ring N then the set Nµ = {x ∈ P ⊂ N/ µ(x) = µ(0)} is a S-right (resp. left) N-sub-
bigroup of N.  
 
Proof: Proof is a matter of routine and left for the reader as an exercise.  
 
Now we proceed on to define the notion of S-fuzzy non-associative binear-ring. We 
just give the definitions and expect the reader to develop more properties about them 
as a matter of routine.  
 
DEFINITION 6.3.50: Let (N = N1 ∪ N2 , +, y) be a S-non-associative binear-ring. µ  a 
fuzzy subset of N. µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy non-associative 
binear-ring (S-fuzzy non-associative binear-ring) if µ1 : N1  →  [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy 
near-ring relative to a near-field P1 ⊂ N1 and µ2 : N2 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy near-ring 
relative to a near-field P2 ⊂ N2. Then µ = µ1 ∪ µ2 : N1 ∪ N2 → [0, 1] is a S-fuzzy 
non-associative binear-ring relative to the binear-field P1 ∪ P2. 
 
DEFINITION  6.3.51: Let (N = N1 ∪ N2, +, y) be a S-non-associative binear-ring. A 
fuzzy set µ in N is called a Smarandache fuzzy non-associative right or left N sub-
bigroup (S-fuzzy non-associative right or left N-sub-bigroup) of N relative to a bifield 
P = P1 ∪ P2 ⊂  N if  
 
i. µ is a S-fuzzy sub-bigroup of (N, +). 
ii. µ(xr) ≥ µ(x) (resp. µ(rx) > µ(x)) for all x, r ∈ P. 
 
Thus depending on every bifield we will have different S-non-associative fuzzy sub-
bigroups.  
 
Several interesting results in this direction can be derived. Now we proceed onto 
define Smarandache fuzzy biseminear-rings.  

 
397
 
DEFINITION 6.3.52: Let (S = S1 ∪ S2, +, y) be a Smarandache associative biseminear-
ring (S-associative biseminear-ring). A fuzzy subset µ : S → [0, 1] is said to be a 
Smarandache fuzzy associative biseminear-ring relative to a proper subset (S-fuzzy 
associative biseminear-ring relative to a proper subset) P in S where P is a 
biseminear-field satisfying the following conditions:  
 
i. µ(x + y) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)}. 
ii. µ(xy) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)} 
 
for all x, y in P.  
 
If µ is a fuzzy subset such that µ is a S-fuzzy associative biseminear-ring relative to 
every proper subset P which is a biseminear-field then we call µ a Smarandache 
strong fuzzy associative biseminear-ring (S-strong fuzzy associative biseminear-ring).  
 
THEOREM 6.3.2: Let (S = S1 ∪ S2, +, y) be an S-biseminear-ring. µ : S → [0, 1] be a 
fuzzy subset of S which is a S-strong fuzzy biseminear-ring of S then S is a S-fuzzy 
biseminear-ring of S.  
 
Proof: Direct by the very definitions, hence left as an exercise for the reader to prove.  
 
DEFINITION 6.3.53: Let (S = S1 ∪ S2, +, y) be a S-non-associative biseminear-ring. A 
fuzzy subset µ of S is said to be a Smarandache fuzzy non-associative biseminear-ring 
if the following conditions are true:  
 
i.µ(x + y) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)}. 
ii.µ(xy) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)}  
 
for all x, y ∈ P.  
 
P a proper subset of S which is a biseminear-field. If µ is a fuzzy subset of S-non-
associative biseminear-ring S and if µ is a S-fuzzy non-associative biseminear-ring 
for every proper subset P of S which is a biseminear-field then we call µ a 
Smarandache strong fuzzy non-associative biseminear-ring (S-strong fuzzy non-
associative biseminear-ring).  
 
DEFINITION 6.3.54: Let (S, +, y) be a S-non-associative biseminear-ring. A fuzzy set µ 
of S is called a Smarandache fuzzy right (resp. left) S-sub-bisemigroup (S-fuzzy right 
(resp. left) S-sub-bisemigroup) of S if 
 
i. 
µ is a S-fuzzy sub-bisemigroup of (S, +). 
ii. 
µ (xr) > µ (x) (resp. µ (rx) > µ (x)) for all r, x ∈ P ⊂  S  
 
where P is the proper subset which is a biseminear-field relative to which µ is 
defined.  
 

 
398
Define S-fuzzy normal S-sub-bisemigroup of S and define µ+ and obtain the results 
about µ+ when S is S-biseminear-ring. Also introduce the concept of S-fuzzy 
congruence of a S-biseminear-ring bimodule.

CHAPTER SEVEN 
 
APPLICATIONS OF SMARANDACHE FUZZY 
ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURES 
 
This chapter has three sections. In the first section we just recall the applications of 
Smarandache algebraic structures. In section two we will recall the application of 
fuzzy algebraic structures and Smarandache fuzzy algebraic structures in the 
application of automaton theory. Section three proposes problems. 
 
 
7.1 Applications of Smarandache Algebraic Structures 
 
In this section we give some of the applications of Smarandache algebraic structures 
viz. Smarandache groupoids, Smarandache near-rings and Smarandache semirings in 
automaton theory, in error correcting codes and in the construction of S-sub-
biautomaton which are given in about forty definitions. For more about these concepts 
refer [128, 130, 135].  
 
The semi-automaton and automaton are built using the fundamental algebraic structure 
semigroups. In this chapter we use the generalized concept of semigroups viz. 
Smarandache groupoids which always contains a semigroup in it are used to construct 
Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton. Thus, the Smarandache 
groupoids find its application in the construction of finite machines. Here we introduce 
the concept of Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton using 
Smarandache free groupoids. This chapter starts with the definition of Smarandache free 
groupoids. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.1: Let S be non empty set. Generate a free groupoid using S and denote it by 
〈S〉. Clearly the free semigroup generated by the set S is properly contained in 〈S〉; as in 〈S〉 we 
may or may not have the associative law to be true. 
 
Remark: Even (ab)c ≠ a(bc) in general for all a, b, c ∈ 〈S〉. Thus unlike a free semigroup 
where the operation is associative, in case of free groupoid we do not assume the 
associativity while placing them in juxtaposition. 
 
THEOREM 7.1.1: Every free groupoid is a S-free groupoid. 
 
Proof: Clearly if S is the set which generates the free groupoid then it will certainly 
contain the free semigroup generated by S, so every free groupoid is a S-free groupoid. 
 
We just recall the definition of semi automaton and automaton from  [95, 128]. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.2: A semi-automaton is a triple Y = (Z, A, δ) consisting of two non - empty 
sets Z and A and a function δ: Z × A → Z, Z is called the set of states, A the input alphabet 
and δ the "next state function" of Y.  
 

 
402
Let A = {a1, ..., an} and Z = {z1, ..., zk}. The semi automaton Y  = (Z, A, δ). The semi-
automaton can also be described by the transition table.

as δ : Z × A → Z, δ(zi, aj) ∈ Z. The semi automaton can also be described by graphs.  
 
Description by graphs:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
We depict z1, ..., zk as 'discs' in the plane and draw an arrow labeled ai from zr to zs if δ(zr, 
ai) = zr. This graph is called the state graph.  
 
Example 7.1.1: Z – set of states and A – input alphabet. Let Z = {0, 1, 2} and A =      {0, 
1}. The function δ: Z × A → Z defined by δ (0, 1) = 1 = δ (2, 1) = δ (1, 1), δ (0, 0) = 0, 
δ (2, 0) = 1, δ (1, 0) = 0. 
 
This is a semi automaton, having the following graph. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The description by table is: 
 
 
δ 
0 1 
0 0 1 
1 0 1

DEFINITION 7.1.3: An Automaton is a quintuple K  = (Z, A, B, δ, Λ) where (Z, A, δ) is a 
semi automaton, B is a non-empty set called the output alphabet and λ: Z × A → B is the 
output function.

If z ∈ Z and a ∈ A, then we interpret δ (z, a) ∈ Z as the next state into which z is 
transformed by the input a, λ (z, a) ∈ B is the output resulting from the input a.  
 
Thus if the automaton is in state z and receives input a, then it changes to state δ (z, a) 
with output λ (z, a).  
 
If A = {a1, ..., an}, B = {b1, b2, ..., bm} and Z ={z1, ..., zk}, δ : Z × A → Z and λ : Z × A → B 
given by the description by tables where δ (zk, ai) ∈ Z and λ (zk, aj) ∈ B.

This automaton is known as the parity check automaton.  
 
 
Now it is important and interesting to note that Z, A and B are only non-empty sets. 
They have no algebraic operation defined on them. The automatons and semi 
automatons defined in this manner do not help one to perform sequential operations. 
Thus, it is reasonable to consider the set of all finite sequences of elements of the set A 
including the empty sequence Λ.  
 
In other words, in our study of automaton we extend the input set A to the free monoid 
A  and 
B

 where B  is the free monoid generated by B. We also extend 
functions δ and λ from Z × A to Z × A  by defining z ∈ Z and a1, ..., an ∈  A by

The semi-automaton Y = (Z, A, δ) and automaton K = (Z, A, B, δ, λ) is thus generalized 
to the new semi-automaton Y = (Z,
δ
,
A
) and automaton K = (Z, 
λ
δ,
 ,
B
 ,
A
). We 
throughout in this book mean by new semi automaton Y = (Z, 
δ
,
A
) and new 
automaton K = (Z, 
λ
δ,
 ,
B
 ,
A
). 
 
The concept of Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton was first 
defined by the author in the year 2002. The study of Smarandache semi automaton and 
uses the concept of groupoids and free groupoids. 

 
405
  
Now we define Smarandache semi automaton and Smarandache automaton: 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.4: Ys =  (Z, 
s
s ,
A δ ) is said to be a Smarandache semi automaton     (S-semi 
automaton) if 
s
A = 〈A〉 is the free groupoid generated by A with Λ the empty element 
adjoined with it and 
s
δ  is the function from Z × 
s
A → Z. Thus the Smarandache semi 
automaton contains Y = (Z, 
δ
,
A
) as a new semi automaton which is a proper sub-structure 
of Ys.  
 
Or equivalently, we define a S-semi automaton as one, which has a new semi automaton as a 
sub-structure.  
 
The advantages of the S-semi automaton are if for the triple Y = (Z, A, δ) is a semi-
automaton with Z, the set of states, A the input alphabet and δ : Z × A → Z is the next 
state function. When we generate the S-free groupoid by A and adjoin with it the empty 
alphabet Λ then we are sure that A has all free semigroups. Thus, each free semigroup 
will give a new semi automaton. Thus by choosing a suitable A we can get several new 
semi automaton using a single S-semi automaton.  
 
We now give some examples of S-semi-automaton using finite groupoids. When 
examples of semi automaton are given usually the books use either the set of modulo 
integers Zn under addition or multiplication we use groupoid built using Zn. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.5:

A δ  ) is called the Smarandache subsemi automaton (S-
subsemi-automaton) of

Y  ≤

Y  if Z1 ⊂ Z2 and  
s'δ is the 
restriction of 
s
δ on Z1 × 
s
A  and 
'
s
Y  has a proper subset H ⊂ 
'
s
Y such that H  is a new semi 
automaton.  
 
Example 7.1.3: Let Z = Z4(2, 1) and A = Z6(2, 1). The S-semi automaton (Z,  A,  δ) 
where δ :  Z  ×  A → Z is given by δ(z, a) = z • a (mod 4).  
 
We get the following table:

We get the following graph for this S-semi automaton:

This has a nice Smarandache subsemi-automaton given by the table. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This Smarandache semi automaton is nothing but given by the states {0, 2}. 
 
Example 7.1.4: Let Z = Z3(1, 2) and A = Z4(2, 2) the triple (Z, A, δ) is a S-semi 
automaton with δ(z, a) = (z ∗ a) (mod 3) ' ∗ ' the operation in A given by the following 
table:

The graphical representation of the S-semi automaton is  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Example 7.1.5: Now let Z = Z4(2, 2) and A = Z3(1, 2) we define δ(z, a) = (z ∗ a) (mod 4) 
‘∗’ as in Z. The table for the semi automaton is given by

Thus S-automaton enables us to adjoin some more elements which is present in A and 
freely generated by A, as a free groupoid; that will be the case when the compositions may 
not be associative.  
 
Secondly, by using Smarandache automaton we can couple several automaton as

Example 7.1.6: Let Z = Z4 (3, 2), A = B = Z5 (2, 3). K = (Z, A, B, δ, λ) is a               S-
automaton defined by the following tables where  
 
δ (z, a) = z ∗ a (mod 4) and   
λ (z, a) = z ∗ a (mod 5).  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
We obtain the following graph:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus we see this automaton has 2 S-sub automatons given by the states {0, 2} and   {1, 
3}.  
 
Example 7.1.7: Consider Z5 = Z5(3, 2) , A = Z3(0, 2), B = Z4(2, 3),  δ (z, a) = z ∗ a (mod 
5), λ (z, a) = z ∗ a (mod 4). The S-automaton (Z, A, B, δ, λ) is given by the following

Thus the S-automaton direct product exists wherever a automaton direct product exists. 
We have made this in order to make the Smarandache parallel composition and 
Smarandache series composition of automaton extendable in a simple way.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.10: A S-groupoid G1 divides a S-groupoid G2 if the corresponding 
semigroups S1 and  S2 of G1 and G2 respectively divides, that is, if S1 is a homomorphic image

We proceed on to define direct product Smarandache automaton and study about them. We 
can extend the direct product of semi automaton to more than two Smarandache 
automatons.  
 
Using the definition of direct product of two automaton K1 and K2 with an additional 
assumption we define Smarandache series composition of automaton.

The Smarandache automaton composition series denoted by

K || 
2
K  of 
1
K  and 
2
K  is defined 
as the series composition of the automaton K1 = (Z1, A1, B1, δ1, λ1) and K2  =    (Z2, A2, B2, δ2, λ2) 
with 
1
K ||
2
K = (Z1 × Z2, A1, B2, δ, λ) where δ ((z1, z2), a1) = (δ1(z1, a1), δ2 (z2, λ1(z1, a1 ))  and 
λ((z1, z2), a1) = (λ2(z2, λ1(z1, a1)) ((z1, z2) ∈ Z1 × Z2, a1 ∈ A1). 
 
This automaton operates as follows: An input a1 ∈ A1 operates on z1 and gives a state transition 
into z1' = δ1(z1, a1) and an output b1 = λ1(z1, a2) ∈ B1 = A2. This output b1 operates on Z2 
transforms a z2 ∈ Z2 into z2'  = δ2 (a2 ,b1) and produces the output λ2 (z2 , b1).  
 
Then

K  is in the next state (z1', z2') which is clear from the following circuit:

Now a natural question would be do we have a direct product, which corresponds to parallel 
composition, of the 2 Smarandache automatons

K  and 
2
K . Clearly the Smarandache 
direct product  of automatons

K  since Z1, and Z2 can be interpreted as two parallel 
blocks. A1 operates on Zi with output Bi (i ∈ {1,2}), A1 × A2 operates on Z1 × Z2, the outputs 
are in B1 × B2.  
 
The circuit is given by the following diagram:    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The concept of group semi-automatons is associated with the S-syntactic near-ring to 
get a finite machine which enjoys a varied structural property.  
 
DEFINITION [31]: A group semi-automaton is an ordered triple S = (G, I, δ ) where G 
is a group, I is a set of inputs and δ : G × I → G is a transition function.  
 
Example 7.1.8: Let G = S3, where S = {p0, p1, …, p5} I = {0, 1, 2,} be the set of 
inputs. The transition function δ : G × I → G defined by  
 
δ (p0, 0)  = p0 
δ (pi, 0)  = pi for i = 1, 2, …, 5  
δ (pi 1)  = pi+1 and δ (p5 1) = 0, for i = 1, 2, …, 4 
δ (pi 2) = pi+2, for i = 1, 2, 3 and δ (p4, 2) = p0 δ = (p5, 2) = p1 
 
Clearly (G, I, δ) is a group semi-automaton.  
 
Now using the notions of [130] we define the following. [130] will give the papers 
used in this book. By using cross reference one can find it. As the main motivation of 
the book is to study Smarandache notions we just give the Smarandache books as 
main references.  
 
DEFINITION [31]: A semi-automaton S = (Q, ×, δ) with state set Q input monoid X and 
state transition function δ; δ : Q × X → Q is called a group semi-automaton if Q is an 
additive group. δ is called additive if there is some x0 ∈ X with δ (q, x) = δ (q, x0) + δ 
(0, x) and δ (q – q1, x0) = δ (q, x0) - δ (q1, x0) for all q, q1 ∈ Q and x ∈ X. Then there is 
some homomorphism  
 
 
ψ : Q → Q and some map

α : × → Q with (x0) = 0 and δ (q, x) = ψ (q) + α (x).  
 
Let δx for a fixed, x ∈ X be the map Q → Q; q → δ (q, x) then {δx / x ∈ X} generates a 
subnear-ring N (S) of near-ring (M (Q), +, y) of all mappings on Q. This near-ring    
N (S) is called the syntactic near-ring.  
 
In this section we introduce the concept of Smarandache semigroup semi-automaton 
analogous to the group semi-automaton. Further for each group semi-automaton an 
associated syntactic near-ring is also given. Here we define the Smarandache 
analogous of it.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.13: Let G be S-semigroup. A Smarandache S-semigroup 
semiautomaton (S-S-semigroup semiautomaton) is an ordered triple S(S) = (G, I, δ ) 
where G is a S-semigroup; I is a set of inputs and δ : G × I → G is a transition 
function.  
 
Clearly all group semi-automatons are trivially S-S-semigroup semiautomaton. Thus 
the class of S-S semigroup semiautomaton propertly contains the class of group semi-
automaton.  
 
Example 7.1.9: Let G = {0, 1, 2, … , 5} = Z6 and I = {0, 1, 2} be the set of states; 
define the transition function δ : G × I → G by δ(g , i) = g . i (mod 6) thus we get the     
S-semigroup semi-automaton. We give the following state graph representation for 
this S-S semigroup semi-automaton.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Now we see when we change the function δ1 for the same S-semigroup, G and I = {0, 
p1, 2} we get a different S-S-semigroup semiautomaton which is given by the 
following figure; here the transition fuctions. δ : G × I → G is defined by δ1 (g, i) = (g 
+ i) mod 6. We get a nice symmetric S-S-semigroup semiautomaton.

DEFINITION 7.1.14: Let S (S) = (G, I, δ) where G is a S-semigroup I the set of input 
alphabets and δ the transition fuction as in case of S-S semigroup semi-automaton. 
We call a proper subset B ⊂ G with B a S-subsemigroup of G and I1 ⊂ I denoted (B, 
I1, δ) = S(SB) is called the Smarandache subsemigroup semi-automaton (S-
subsemigroup semiautomaton) if δ : B × I1 → B. A S-S-semigroup semi-automaton 
may fail to have sometimes S-S-subsemigroup subsemi-automaton.  
 
Example 7.1.10: In example 7.1.9 with S = {Z6, I, δ} when we take B = {0, 2, 4} we 
get a S-S-semigroup subsemi-automaton  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
as B = {0, 2, 4} is a S-subsemigroup of Z6.  
 
Now to the best of our knowledge we have not seen the definition of group automaton 
we define it and then proceed on to get corresponding near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.15: A group automaton is an ordered quintuple A = {G, A, B, δ, λ} 
where G is a group, A is a set of inputs, B is a set of outputs δ : G × A → G and λ : G 
× A → B is the transition and output functions respectively.  
 
The Smarandache analogous of this would be as follows.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.16: A Smarandache S-semigroup automaton (S-S semigroup 
automaton) is an ordered quintuple S(A) = (G, A, B, δ, λ) where G is a S-semigroup 
and A set of input alphabets and B set of output alphabets, δ and λ are the transition 
and output functions respectively.

If δ restricted form G × A → G maps a subgroup T ⊂  G into itself δ : T × A → T then 
we can say the S-S-semigroup automaton has (T ⊂ G, A, B, δ, λ) to be a group 
automaton.  
 
We call this level I S-S-semigroup automaton. Now we proceed on to define S-S-
semigroup semiautomaton and S-S-semigroup automaton of level II.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.17: Let S = (G, I, δ ) be an ordered triple where G is only a S-
semigroup. If B ⊂ G and B is a group under the operations of G, and if S1 = (B, I, δ ) 
is a group semi-automaton with B a group, I is a set of inputs and δ : B × I → B then 
S = (G, I, δ) is called the Smarandache S-semigroup semi-automaton of level II (S-S-
semigroup semiautomaton II). Similarly we define Smarandache S-semigroup 
automaton of level II (S-S-semigroup automaton II).  
 
It is left for the reader to find any relation existing between the two levels of 
automaton. Now we proceed on to see how these concepts will produce for us the      
S-near-rings.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.18: Let S = (Q, X δ) be a S-S-semigroup semi-automaton where Q is 
a S-semigroup under addition ‘+’ i.e. G ⊂ Q is such that G is a S-semigroup under 
‘+’ and G a proper subset of Q Let δ : G × X → G is well defined i.e. restriction of δ 
to G is well defined so (G, X, δ) = C becomes a semi-automaton C is called additive if 
there is some x0 ∈ X with  
 
 
 
 
δ (q, x) = δ (q, x0) + δ (0, x) and  
 
 
 
δ (q – q1, x0) = δ (q1 x0) - δ (q1, x0) for all q, q1 ∈ G and x ∈ X.  
 
Then there is some homomorphism  
 
 
 
 
ψ : G → G and some map  
 
 
 
α : X → G with ψ(x0) = 0 and δ(q, x) = ψ(q) + α(x).  
 
Let δx for a fixed x ∈ X be the map from G → G; q → δ (q, x). Then {δx / x ∈ X} 
generates a subnear-ring N (P) of the near-ring (M (G), +, y) of all mappings on G; 
this near-ring N(P) is called as the Smarandache syntactic near-ring (S-syntactic 
near-ring).  
 
The varied structural properties are enjoyed by this S-syntactic near-ring for varying 
S-semigroups. The most interesting feature about these S-syntactic near-ring is that 
for one S-S-semigroup semi-automaton we have several group semiautomaton 
depending on the number of valid groups in the S-semigroup. This is the vital benefit 
in defining S-S-semigroup automaton and S-syntactic near-ring. So for a given S-S-
semigroup semi-automaton we can have several S-syntactic near-ring.  
 
Thus the Smarandache notions in this direction has evolved several group automaton 
for a given S-semigroup. 
 
Another application is in the error-correcting codes.

The study of how experiments can be organized systematically so that statistical 
analysis can be applied in an interesting problem which is carried out by several 
researchers. In the planning of experiments it often occurs that results are influenced 
by phenomena outside the control of the experimenter. The introduction of balanced 
incomplete block design (BIBD) helps in avoiding undesirable influences in the 
experiment. In general, if we have to test the effect of r different conditions with m 
possibilities for each conditions this leads to a set of r orthogonal latin squares.  
 
 
A planar near-ring can be used to construct balanced incomplete block designs 
(BIBD) of high efficiency; we just state how they are used in developing error 
correcting codes as codes which can correct errors is always desirable than the ones 
which can only detect errors. In view of this we give the following definition. Just we 
recall the definition of BIBD for the sake of completeness.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.19: A balanced incomplete block design (BIBD) with parameters (υ, 
b, r, k, λ) is a pair (P, B) with the following properties.  
 
a. 
P is a set with υ elements. 
b. 
B = (B1, …, Bb) is a subset of p (P) with b elements.  
c. 
Each Bi has exactly k elements where k < υ each unordered pair (p, q) 
with p, q ∈ P, p ≠ q occurs in exactly λ elements in B.  
 
The set B1, …, Bb are called the blocks of BIBD. Each a ∈ P occurs in exactly r sets of 
B. Such a BIBD is also called a (υ, b, r, k, λ) configuration or 2 – (υ, k, λ) tactical 
configuration or design. The term balance indicates that each pair of elements occurs 
in exactly the same number of block, the term incomplete means that each block 
contains less than υ - elements. A BIBD is symmetric if υ = b.  
 
The incidence matrix of a (υ, b, r, k, λ) configuration is the v ×  b matrix A = (aij) 
where

here i denotes the ith element of the configuration. The following conditions are 
necessary for the existence of a BIBD with parameters υ, b, r, k, λ.  
 
 
i. 
bk = rv. 
ii. 
r(k – 1) = λ (v – 1). 
iii. 
b ≥ v.  
 
Recall a near-ring N is called planar (or Clay near-ring) if for all equation x o a = x 
o b + c. (a, b, c ∈ N, a ≠ b) have exactly one solution x ∈ N.  
 
Example 7.1.11: Let (Z5, ‘+’, *) where ‘+’ is the usual ‘+’ and ‘*’ is n * 0 = 0, n * 1 = 
n * 2 = n, n * 3 = n * 4 = 4n for all n ∈ N. Then 1 ≡ 2 and 3 ≡ 4. N is planar near-ring; 
the equation x * 2 = x * 3 + 1 with 2 ≠ 3 has unique solution x = 3.  

 
416
 
A planar near-ring can be used to construct BIBD of high efficiency where by high 
efficiency ‘E’ we mean E = λv / rk; this E is a number between 0 and 1 and it 
estimates the quality of any statistical analysis if E ≥ 0.75 the quality is good.  
 
Now, how does one construct a BIBD from a planar ring? This is done in the 
following way.  
 
Let N be a planar ring. Let a ∈ N. Define ga : N → N by n → n o a and form G = {ga / 
a ∈ N}. Call a ∈ N “group forming” if a o N is a subgroup of (N, +). Let us call sets    
a o N + b (a ∈ N*, b ∈ N) blocks. Then these blocks together with N as the set of 
“points” form a tactical configuration with parameters  
 
(υ, b, r, k, λ) = (υ, 
|
G
|
1υ
α
 + α2 υ, α1 + α2 |G|, |G|, λ) 
 
where υ = |N| and α1 (α2) denote the number of orbits of F under the group G \ {0} 
which consists of entirely of group forming elements. The tactical configuration is a 
BIBD if and only if either all elements are group forming or just 0 is group forming.  
 
Now how are they used in obtaining error correcting codes. Now using the planar 
near-ring one can construct a BIBD. By taking either the rows or the columns of the 
incidence matrix of such a BIBD one can obtain error correcting codes with several 
nice features. Now instead of using a planar near-ring we can use Smarandache planar 
near-ring. The main advantage in using the Smarandache planar near-ring is that for 
one S-planar near-ring we can define more than one BIBD. If there are m-near-field in 
the S-planar near-ring we can build m BIBD. Thus this may help in even comparison 
of one BIBD with the another and also give the analysis of the common features.  
 
Thus the S-planar near-ring has more advantages than the usual planar near-rings and 
hence BIBD's constructed using S-planar near-rings will even prove to be an efficient 
error correcting codes.  
 
Finally we give the applications of Smarandache algebraic bistructures. Using the 
notion of Smarandache bisemigroup we build bisemiautomaton and bi-automatons.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.20: A bisemi-automaton is a triple X = (Z, A, δ) consisting of two 
non-empty sets Z and A = A1 ∪ A2 and a function δ : Z × (A1 ∪ A2) → Z, Z is called 
the set of states and A = A1 ∪ A2 the input alphabet and δ the next state function of X. 
We insist that if X1 = (Z, A1, δ) and X2 = (Z, A2, δ) then X1 is not a subsemi-automaton 
of X2 or X2 is not a subsemi-automaton of X1 but both X1 and X2 are semi-automatons. 
Thus in case of bisemi-automaton we consider the set A i.e. input alphabets as a union 
of two sets which may enjoy varied properties.  
 
Hence we see in A = A1 ∪ A2, A1 may take states in a varied way and A2 in some other 
distinct way. So when we take a set A and not the set A1 ∪ A2 = A there is difference 
for

Hence the same a1 ∈ A may act in two different ways depending on, to which Ai it 
belongs to, or it may happen in some cases in A = A1 ∪ A2  with A1 ∩ A2 = φ , so that 
they will have a unique work assigned by the function δ. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.21: A biautomaton is a quintuple Y = (Z, A, B, δ, λ) where (Z, A, δ ) 
is a bisemi-automaton and A = A1 ∪ A2, B = B1 ∪ B2 and λ : Z × A → B is the output 
function. Here also Y1 = (Z, A1, B1, δ, λ) and Y2 = (Z, A2, B2, δ, λ) then Y1 is not a 
subautomaton of Y2 and vice versa but both Y1 and Y2 are automatons. The bisemi-
automaton and biautomaton will still find its application in a very interesting manner 
when we replace the sets by free bisemigroups. We denote by

Thus we see the new biautomaton Y  can perform multifold and multichannel 
operations than the usual automaton. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.22: Y1 = (Z1, A, B, δ1, λ1) is called a sub-biautomaton of Y2 = (Z, A, 
B, δ, λ) (in symbols Y1 ⊂ Y2  if Z1 ⊂ Z and δ1 and λ1 are the restrictions of δ and λ 
respectively on Z1 × A (Here A = A1 ∪ A2 and B = B1 ∪ B2 are subsets). 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.23: Let Y1 = (Z1, A1, B1, δ1, λ1) and Y2 = (Z2, A2, B2, δ2, λ2). A

φ is called a monomorphism (epimorphism, isomorphism) if all functions ξ , α , β  are 
injective (surjective or bijective) where we make relevant adjustments when for a 
single a ∈ A1  there are two state changes.  
 
Similarly for a single a ∈ A1 we may have outputs depending on the section where we 
want to send the message. Thus we see the biautomaton can simultaneously do the 
work of two automatons, which is very rare in case of automatons. So in a single 
machine we have double operations to be performed by it. 
 
Example 7.1.12: Let Z = {0, 1, 2, 3}, A = A1 ∪ A2, where A1 = Z2 = {0, 1} and A2 = 
{0, 1, 2} = Z3. δ : (z, a) = z.a. Is Y = (Z, A, δ) a bisemi-automaton?

But if we consider the semi-automaton Y1 = {Z, A1, δ} and (Z, A2, δ) = Y2 we get  
the following graphs: 
A1 
A2 

 
419
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Suppose we take A = {0, 1, 2} and divide it as 
1
A′ = {0, 1} and 
2
A′  = {2} then we get 
the graphs as 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
But 
1
X′  = {Z,
1
A′ , δ} and 
2
X′  = {Z,
2
A′ , δ} is a bisemi-automaton. 
 
Remark: It is very important to note that how we choose the subsets A1 and A2 from 
A if A1 ⊂ A2 or A2 ⊂ A1. The semi-automaton will cease to be a bisemi-automaton. 
 
Thus the very notion of bisets should have been defined even it may look trivial. So 
we at this juncture define bisets. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.24: Let A be a set we say A = A1 ∪ A2 is a biset if A1 and A2 are 
proper subsets of A such that A1 ⊄ A2 and A2 ⊄ A1.  
 
Unless this practical problem was not illustrated, the very notion of bisets would have 
been taken up researchers as a trivial concept. Only when bisets plays a vital role in 
determining whether a semi-automaton or an automaton is a bisemi-automaton or 
biautomaton. 
 
Thus we give another formulation of the bisemi-automaton and biautomaton. Thus 
one of the necessary conditions for a semi-automaton to be a bisemi-automaton is that  
A = A1 ∪ A2 is a biset. If A = A1 ∪ A2 is not a biset then we do not have the semi-
automaton to be a bisemi-automaton. But when we construct a bisemi-automaton A =

A1 ∪ A2 where δ is a special mapping then the map gives different positions to the 
same input symbol depending on which subset the input symbol is. 
 
To this end we give the following example: 
 
Example 7.1.13: Let X = {Z, A = A1 ∪ A2, δ} be the bisemi-automaton, here Z =       
{0, 1, 2}, A1 = {0, 1} and A2 = {0, 1, 2, 3}. δ(z, 0) = z + 0 if 0 ∈ A1, δ(z, 0) = z.0 if    
0 ∈ A2, δ(z, 1) = z + 1 if 1 ∈ A1, δ(z, 1) = z.1 if 1 ∈ A2, δ(z, 2) = z.2 (mod 3), δ(z, 3) 
= z.3 (mod 3). 
 
Now the diagram for the bisemi-automaton is as follows:  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thus this is a bisemi-automaton but not a semi-automaton as the function is not well 
defined. Thus we see all semiautomaton cannot be made into bisemiautomaton and in 
general a bisemiautomaton is not a semiautomaton. What best can be observed is that 
one can see that by building in a finite machine a bisemiautomaton structure one has 
the opportunity to make the machine perform more actions at a least cost and 
according to demand the bisets can be used with minute changes in the function. This 
bisemi-automaton will serve a greater purpose than that of the semi-automaton, 
secondly when we generate the free semigroups using the bisets or the sets in a 
bisemi-automaton we get nice results. Several applications can be found in this case.  
 
Now at this juncture we wish to state that for the automaton also to make it a 
biautomatons both the input alphabets A and the output alphabets B must be divided 
into bisets to be the basic criteria to be a bi-automaton. The theory for this is similar to 
that of bisemi-automaton where in case of bisemi-automaton we used only the input 
alphabet A but in this case we will use both the input alphabets A and the output 
alphabets B. 
 
Thus while converting a automaton to biautomaton we basically demand the sets A 
and B be divided into bisets such that the bisets give way to two distinct 
subautomaton. But if we are constructing biautomaton we define on A = A1 ∪ A2 and 
B = B1 ∪ B2 such that δ and λ are not identical on A1 ∩ A2 and B1 ∩ B2 if they are 
non-empty. The reader is given the task of finding results in this direction for this will 
have a lot of application in constructing finite machines. Similarly when they are 
0

made into new biautomaton we take A to the free bisemigroup generated by A1 and 
A2 and B also to be the free bisemigroup generated by B1 and B2. We give two 
examples, one a automaton made into a biautomaton another is a constructed 
biautomaton. 
 
Example 7.1.14: Let Y = (Z, A, B, δ, λ) where Z = {0, 1, 2, 3}, A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} 
= {0, 2, 4} ∪ {1, 3, 5} = A1 ∪ A2, B = {0, 1, 2, 3} = {0, 2} ∪ {1, 3} = B1 ∪ B2. 
 
δ (z, a) = z + a (mod 4) if a ∈ A1,  
δ(z, a) = z.a (mod 4) if a ∈ A2. 
λ (z, a) = z.a (mod 4) if a ∈ B1,   
λ(z, a) = z + a (mod 4) if a ∈ B2. 
 
Now we find the graphical representation of them.

We claim Y is the biautomaton as the output functions do not tally in both the tables. 
We give one more example of an automaton, which is a biautomaton.

{0, 1, 2, 3, 4}. δ(z, a) = z.a (mod 5), λ(z, a) = 2za (mod 4).

If we take B = B1 ∪ B2 where B1 = {0, 1} and B2 = {2, 3} and A = A1 ∪ A2 = {0, 1} 
∪ {2} we get a biautomaton. 
 
Thus using bisemigroups we obtain the notion of S-bisemi-automaton.

Or equivalently, we define a S-semi-automaton as one, which has a new bisemi-
automaton as its substructure.

The 
notion 
of 
Smarandache 
sub-bi-automaton 
(S-sub-bi-automaton) 
and 
Smarandache sub-bi-semi-automaton (S-sub-bisemi-automaton) are defined in a 
similar way as that of S-subautomaton and S-subsemi-automaton. 
 
We give the use of binear-rings in case of automatons in case of automatons.  
 
Now when we proceed on to use the bisemigroup and binear-ring structure to define 
these concepts we get many multipurpose S-S-semi automatons i.e. a single S-S-
semigroup automaton can serve several purposes as a finite machine. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.28: Let (G, +, y) be a S-bisemigroup. A Smarandache S-bisemigroup 
semi bi-automaton (S-S-bisemigroup semi bi-automaton) is an ordered triple SB (S) = 
(G = G1 ∪ G2 , I = I1 ∪ I2 , δ = δ1 ∪ δ2 ) where G is a S-bisemigroup, I = I1 ∪ I2 is a 
set of inputs I1 and I2 are proper subsets of I δ1: Gi × Ii → Gi is a transition function    
i = 1, 2. 
 
Example 7.1.16: G = Z3 ∪ Z4, I = {0, 1, 2} ∪ {a1 a2}; δ = (δ1 δ2)  δ1 : Z3 × {2} → Z3, 
δ2 : Z4 × {a1, a2}→ Z4 given by the following tables:

(G, I, δ) is a S-bisemigroup bisemi-automaton. G is a S-bisemigroup under 
multiplication. 
 
Thus these two graphs together give the S-bisemigroup bisemi-automaton.

DEFINITION 7.1.29: Let SB(S) = (G = G1 ∪ G2, I = I1 ∪ I2, δ = (δ1 δ2)) be a S-S-
semigroup bisemi-automaton. A proper subset B ⊂ G where B = B1 ∪ B2, (B1 ⊂ G1 
and B2 ⊂ G2) is called the Smarandache S-sub-bisemigroup bisemi-automaton if δ /Bi 
: Bi × Ii → Bi, i = 1, 2.  
 
The above example has no S-S-sub-bisemigroup bisemi-automaton. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.30: A bigroup biautomaton is an ordered quintuple, A = {G, A, B, δ 
= (δ1  δ2), λ = (λ1 , λ2)} where G is a bigroup i.e. G = G1 ∪ G2, A set of inputs, B is 
set of outputs δi : Gi × A → Gi, λi : Gi × A → B, i = 1, 2;  is the transition and output 
functions respectively. 
 
The Smarandache analogue would be as follows: 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.31: A Smarandache S-bisemigroup biautomaton (S-S-bisemigroup 
biautomaton) is an ordered quintuple SS(A) = (G = G1 ∪ G2 , A = A1 ∪ A2, B = B1 ∪ 
B2 , δ = (δ1, δ2), λ = (λ1, λ2)) where G is a S-bisemigroup and A and B are bisets 
which are input and output alphabets δ and λ are the transition and output functions 
respectively . 
 
If δi : Gi × Ai → Gi maps a sub-bigroup Ti ⊂ Gi into itself δi : Ti × Ai → Ti then we can 
say the SS(A) bi-automaton has (T ⊂ G, A, B, δ , λ) to be a group bi-automaton. 
 
We can define level II bi-automaton in a similar way. The task of doing this is left as 
an exercise to the reader. 
 
DEFINITION 7.1.32: Let S = (Q, X , δ) be a S-S bisemigroup bisemi-automaton where 
Q is a S-bisemigroup under ‘+’ i.e. G ⊂ Q is such that G is a S-bisemigroup under 
‘+’ and G is a proper subset of Q. Let δi : Gi × X → Gi is well defined that is 
restriction of δ to Gi is well defined so that (G, X, δ) = C becomes a bisemi-
automaton. C is called additive if there is some x0 ∈ X with δ (q, x) = δ (q, x0) +         
δ (0, x) and δ (q – q', x) = δ (q, x) – δ (q', x) for all q, q' ∈ G = G1 ∪ G2 and x ∈ X. 
 
Then there is some bi-homomorphism  
 
ψ : G → G and some map 
α : X → G with 
ψ (x0) = 0 and δ (q, x) = ψ (q) + α (x). 
 

 
425
Let δx for a fixed x ∈ X be the map from G → G; q → δ (q, x); then {δx  x ∈ X} 
generates a sub-binear-ring, N(P) of the binear-ring. {M(G) = M(G1) ∪ M(G2) , +,y} 
of all mappings on G = G1 ∪ G2, this binear-ring N(P) is called the Smarandache 
bisyntactic binear-ring (S-bisyntactic binear-ring). 
 
Just as in case of S-semigroups we see in case of S-bisemigroups also we have several 
bigroup, bisemi-automaton depending on the number of valid bigroups in the S-
semigroup. So for a given S-S-bisemigroup bisemi-automaton we can have several S-
bisyntactic binear-ring. 
 
Now we see the probable applications of binear-rings to error correcting codes and 
their Smarandache analogue.  
 
DEFINITION 7.1.33: A binear-ring N = N1 ∪ N2 is called biplanar if for all equations 
xi oa = xiob + c (a, b, c ∈ Ni a ≠ b) have exactly one solution xi ∈ Ni, i =1, 2.  
 
Now we show how a biplanar binear-ring can be used to construct BIBD of high 
efficiency where by high efficiency E we mean E = λν/rk this E is a number between 
0 and 1 and it estimates the quality of any statistical analysis if E > 0.75 the quality is 
good.  
 
Here we give the construction of BIBD from a biplanar binear-ring.  
 
Let N be a biplanar binear-ring. Let a ∈ N = N1 ∪ N2. Define ga : N1 → N1 if a ∈ N1 
or ga : N2→ N2  if a ∈ N2, by  
 
n1 → n1 o a if a ∈ N1 
n2 → n2 o a if a ∈ N2 
 
and from G = G1 ∪ G2 = {ga | a ∈ N1} ∪ {ga | a ∈ N2}. Call a ∈ N, bigroup forming if 
a o N1 is a subgroup or a o N2 is a sub group of (N1, +) and (N2, +) respectively. Let 
us call sets a.Ni + b (a ∈ Ni; b ∈ Ni) blocks i = 1, 2. Then these blocks together with N 
as the set of points form a tactical configuration with parameters (υ, b, r, k, λ) =

denotes the number of orbits of F under the group G2\{0} which consists of entirely of 
bigroup forming elements. The tactical configuration is a BIBD if and only if either 
all elements are bigroup forming or just 0 is bigroup forming. 
 
 
The main advantage in using the Smarandache biplanar binear-ring is that for one      
S-biplanar binear-ring we define more than one BIBD. If there are m-binear field in 
the S-biplanar binear-ring we can build m BIBD. 
 

 
426
Thus the S-biplanar binear-ring has more advantages than the usual planar binear-
rings and hence BIBD’s construed using S-biplanar binear-rings will even prove to be 
an efficient error correcting codes. 
 
Now we proceed on to recall some of the applications of Fuzzy algebra in section two.  
 
 
7.2 Some applications of fuzzy algebraic structures and Smarandache 
fuzzy algebraic structures 
 
The application of fuzzy algebra is mainly found in finite machines or which we 
choose to call as Smarandache fuzzy automaton. Apart from this we see that there is 
no direct application of Fuzzy algebra. When we say Fuzzy algebraic structures we 
mean only fuzzy groupoids, fuzzy semigroups, fuzzy groups, fuzzy rings, fuzzy near-
rings, fuzzy seminear-rings, fuzzy semirings and fuzzy vector spaces. We don't mix 
up the concepts of fuzzy logic with fuzzy algebraic structures. The book by [95] 
entitled Fuzzy Automaton and Languages, Theory and Applications, gives an 
elaborate account of both the theory of automaton and algebraic fuzzy automaton. We 
would recall some notions of algebraic fuzzy automaton theory which will be directly 
helpful to us in constructing Smarandache algebraic fuzzy automatons.  
 
We also give the probable Smarandache fuzzy algebraic structures then and there so 
that the reader can compare them and study them and make further research on these 
concepts.  
 
A fuzzy finite state machine (FFSM) is a triple M = (Q, X, µ) where Q and X are finite 
non-empty sets and µ is a fuzzy subset of Q × X × Q i.e µ : Q × X × Q → [0, 1]. As 
usual X∗ denotes the set of all words of elements of X of finite length Q is called the 
set of states and X is called the set of input symbols. Let ∧ denote the empty words in 
X∗ and |x| denote the  length of x for all x ∈ X∗, X∗ is a free semigroup with identity ∧ 
with respect to the binary concatenation of two words.  
 
DEFINITION [95]: Let M = (Q, X, µ) be a FFSM. Define µ∗ : Q × X∗ × Q → [0, 1] by  
 
µ∗(q, ∧, p) = 


and µ∗(g, xa, p) = ∨ {µ∗(q, x, r) ∧ µ(r, a, p) | r ∈ Q} for all x ∈ X∗ and a ∈ X. Let X+ 
= X∗\{∧}. Then X+ is a semigroup. For µ∗ given in here we let µ+ = µ∗ restricted to Q 
× X+ × Q.  
 
Several results about FFSM can be had from [95].  
 
Analogous to the above definition of [95] we define Smarandache fuzzy finite state 
machine (SFFSM). Here we replace X∗ the free semigroup by S(X∗) the free groupoid 
generated by X so that it is immediate X∗ ⊆ S(X∗), further S(X∗) is a S-groupoid and 
has several free semigroups.  
 

 
427
DEFINITION 7.2.1: Let M = (Q, X, µ) be a FFSM. Define S(µ∗) : Q × S(X∗) × Q → [0, 
1] by S(µ∗)(q ∧ p) = µ∗(q ∧ p) on X∗ and on elements in S(X∗) \ X∗. S(µ∗) need not be 
even defined or it can take any value between 0 and 1 i.e. (0, 1).  
 
S(µ∗(q, xa, p)) = µ∗(q, xa, p) for all x ∈ X∗, a ∈ X. We call S(µ∗(X)) or S(M) the 
SFFSM. 
 
Now we can take the set X is FFSM to be say n sets of input symbols (n-finite). Say    
X = X1 ∪ X2 ∪ … ∪ Xn. ' ∪ ' only for notation. Now we saw from definition 7.2.1, the 
machine FFSM is completely contained in SFFSM. But if we are interested to couple 
several machines in a single piece then SFFSM becomes handy. For if we have say 
X1, …, Xn; n (n < ∞), set of distinct output symbols then the Smarandache fuzzy finite 
state machines (SFFSM) comes handy. For let S(X∗) = 〈 X1 ∪ … ∪ Xn 〉 denote the 
free groupoid generated by the set X. Clearly S(X∗) is a S-groupoid and we see S(X∗) 
has free semigroups 
*

X , …, 
*
n
X so that S(µ∗) : Q × S(X∗) × Q → [0, 1] we give all the 
n-FFSM as

thus we see all the n-FFSM are contained in the SFFSM. Further if we are interested 
in compartmenting a FFSM into submachines that also can be easily done by SFFSM. 
For if X = {x1 … xn} we want to divide this into say t machines with t < n such that the 
t sets T1, …, Tt are subsets of X with no conditions on Ti's the only condition being

Ti ∩ Tj ≠ φ even if i ≠ j in general. Then now we see S(X∗) is a S-free groupoid having 
Ti
∗ to be a free semigroups for i = 1, 2, …, n. S(µ∗) : Q × (X∗) × Q → [0, 1] gives 
restriction maps as

We see these t-machines acts as sub-FFSM to SFFSM and one can easily use this 
method in dividing the networking and still use the FFSM as a single machines which 
can perform compartmental operations.  
 
Thus in the author's opinion this will be of a great help when applied to real world 
problems. We have already defined the concept of Smarandache semi-automaton we 

 
428
now proceed on to define the notion of Smarandache fuzzy bistate finite semi-
automaton using the concept of S-bigroupoids. 
 
Suppose we are interested in constructing finite machines where X is the set of input 
symbols should operate with two distinct binary operations that too not on the whole 
set X but on some part of X then we adopt Smarandache free bigroupoids to construct 
such machines.  
 
Given Q set of state, X the collection of input symbols X = X1 ∪ X2 where X1 and X2 
are proper subsets of X may be with some overlap but still they have to perform 
actions in a different way. Now we make the free bigroupoid to be generated by X is a 
very special way. If S(X∗) denotes the free bigroupoid then S(X∗) = S(
*
1
X ) ∪ S(
*
2
X ) 
i.e. S(
*
1
X ) and S(
*
2
X ) are free groupoids on X1 and X2. Using this we build the 
Smarandache fuzzy finite bistate machines we say bistate because it can give two 
states for a same input symbols depending on from which free groupoids we pick 
them.  
 
Let SB(M) = (Q, S(X∗), S(µ∗)) where S(X∗) =  S(
*
1
X ) ∪ S(
*
2
X ) with S(
*
1
X ) and S(
*
2
X ) 
free groupoids so that S(X∗) is a Smarandache free bigroupoid (S-free bigroupoid).  
 
Define µ∗ = (

X , a ∈ X2, µ2 : Q × X2 × Q → [0, 1]. Thus we call SB(M) to be a Smarandache 
fuzzy finite bistate machine (SFFBSM). Thus the notion of Smarandache fuzzy 
bigroupoids helps in the construction of SFFBSM.  
 
All results pertaining to FFSM can be easily extended to SFFSM in an analogous 
way.  
 
Now we will just recall the definition of T-generalized state machine.  
 
A triple (Q, X, τ) is called a generalized state machine if Q and X are finite sets and   
τ : Q × X × Q → [0, 1] is such that

= 0 for all q ∈ Q and a ∈ X. M is called complete if

for all a ∈ X. Let X+ = X∗ \{∧}. Let T be a t-norm on [0, 1]. Define τ+ : Q × X+ × Q → 
[0, 1] by τ+(p, a1, …, an, q) = ∨ {τ(p, a, T1)/ τ(r1, a2, r2)T … Tτ (rn-1 an, q)/ ri ∈ Q,, i = 
1, 2, …, n – 1} where p and q ∈ Q and a1 … an ∈ X. M is called a T-generalized state 
machine when τ+ is defined in terms of T.  
 
Now we to get the Smarandache T-generalized state machine (S-T-generalized state 
machine T-generalized state machine) we replace X∗ the free semigroup by the free 
groupoid S(X∗). Since free groupoids are S-free groupoids containing free semigroup 
we replace X+ = X∗\{Λ} by S(X+) = S(X∗)\(Λ) . By using S(X∗) in the X∗ we will get the 
Smarandache generalized state machine (S-generalized state machine) as SFFSM.  
 
Clearly we can define the Smarandache generalized state machine as follows:  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.2: A Smarandache generalized state machine S(X∗) is one that 
contains a proper subset which is a generalized state machine. Thus we see all our 
Smarandache generalized state machines (S-generalized state machines) contain the 
generalized state machines properly.  
 
All results pertaining to these can be worked out as exercises. 
 
Let M = (Q, X, µ) be a FFSM. Let E(M) be equal to {[x] | x ∈ X∗} where [x] =           
{y ∈ X∗ | x ≡ y}. (E(M), ∗) is a finite semigroup with the identity.  
 
(Q, E(M), ρ) is a fuzzy transformation semigroup that we denote by FTS(M) where 
E(M) is a finite semigroup with identity [Λ]. Now using the FTS(M) we construct 
Smarandache fuzzy transformation S-groupoid (S-fuzzy transformation S-groupoid) 
associated with M. This is carried out in the following steps:  
 
i. 
X∗ will be replaced by S(X∗) the S-fuzzy free groupoid.  

 
430
 
Subsequent changes are made.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.3: Let M = (Q, X, µ) be a FFSM. Let p, q ∈ Q, p is called an 
immediate successor of q if there exists a ∈ X such that µ(q, a, p) > 0, p is called a 
successor of q if there exists x ∈ X+ such that µ∗(q, x, p) > 0. If S(M) = (Q, S(X∗), µ∗) 
be a SFFSM. Let p, q ∈ Q, p is called an Smarandache immediate (S-immediate) of q 
if there exists a ∈ X such that µ(q, a, p) > 0, p is called a successor of q if there exists 
x ∈ S(X∗) such that S(µ∗(qxp)) > 0.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.4: Let M = (Q, X, µ) be a FFSM. M is called strongly connected if for 
all p, q ∈ Q, p ∈ S(q). For more properties in this direction please refer [95]. Let M 
= (Q, X, µ) be a FFSM. Let δ be a fuzzy subset of Q. Then (Q, δ, X, µ) is called  a  
subsystem  of  M  if  for  all  p, q ∈ Q  and  for  all a ∈ X. δ (q) ≥ δ (p)  ∧  µ( p, a, q). 
Let S(M) = (Q, S(X∗), µ∗) be a SFFSM. Let δ be a fuzzy subset of Q. Then (Q, δ, S(X∗), 
µ∗) is called a Smarandache subsystem (S-subsystem) of S(M) if for all p, q ∈ Q and 
for all a ∈ X, δ (q) ≥ δ (p) ∧ µ∗(p, a, q).  
 
Properties on S-subsystems can be obtained analogous to subsystems.  
 
DEFINITION [95]: A fuzzy semi-automaton (FSA) over a finite group (Q, ∗) is a triple 
(Q, X, µ) where X is a finite set and µ is a fuzzy subset of Q × X × Q.  
 
We call (Q, X, µ) a Smarandache fuzzy semi-automaton (S-FSA) over a S-semigroup 
(Q, ∗) where X is a finite set and µ is a fuzzy subset of Q × X × Q. Thus if (Q, X, µ) is 
a S-fuzzy semi-automaton then it contains proper subsets which are fuzzy semi-
automatons. Let S = (Q, X, µ) and T = (Q1, X1, µ1) be a S-FSA over a S-semigroup Q. 
A pair of functions (f, g) where f : Q → Q1, g : X → X1 are Smarandache 
homomorphism (S-homomorphism) from S into T written (f, g) : S → T if the 
following condition hold good  
 
i. 
f is a S-semigroup homomorphism. 
ii. 
µ(p, x, q) ≤ µ1(f(p), g(x), f(q)) for all p, q ∈ Q, x ∈ X.  
 
The pair (f, g) is a Smarandache strong homomorphism (S-strong homomorphism) 
from S into T if it satisfies (i) of the above definition and the added condition µ1(f(p), 
g(x), f(q)) = ∨ {µ(p, x, r) | r ∈ Q, f(r) = f(q)} for all p, q ∈ Q' ⊂ Q, x ∈ X, Q' a 
subgroup of Q.  
 
DEFINITION 7.2.5: A fuzzy subset λ of Q is called a Smarandache fuzzy subsemi-
automaton (S-subsemi-automaton) of S if  
 
i. 
λ is a S-fuzzy subsemigroup of Q. 
ii. 
λ(p) ≥ µ(q, x, p) ∧ λ(q)  
 
for all p, q ∈ Q' ⊂ Q (Q' a subgroup of Q) and x ∈ X.

Having defined Smarandache analogue on similar lines an innovative reader can 
develop the Smarandache fuzzy analogue of all the Smarandache applications dealt in 
the section 7.1. This work is left as an exercise for the reader.  
 
 
7.3 Problems 
 
In this section we introduce only 16 problems. Each can be viewed or visualized as a 
research problem on the applications of Smarandache fuzzy algebraic structures. Not 
only these 16 problems still we can have several related ones and new ones by the 
reader.  
 
Problem 7.3.1: Define and construct Smarandache cascades using S-automaton.  
 
Problem 7.3.2: Give an example of a S-syntactic near-ring. Use it to define S-
semigroup semi-automaton.  
 
Problem 7.3.3: For a S-planar near-ring, N = (Z144, +, y) using the BIBD associated 
with N construct error-correcting codes.  
 
Problem 7.3.4: Give a general method of constructing BIBD for planar near-ring      
(Zp, +, y), p a prime.  
 
Problem 7.3.5: Give an example of a bi-automaton with 7 states.  
 
Problem 7.3.6: Define Smarandache bicascades. Illustrate with examples.  
 
Problem 7.3.7: Can two finite S-automaton be combined to get a S-bi-automaton? 
 
Problem 7.3.8: Construct a Smarandache fuzzy finite state machine.  
 
Problem 7.3.9: Construct a S-FFBSM.  
 
Problem 7.3.10: Construct the Smarandache generalized state machine using           
(Q, S(X∗), τ).  
 
Problem 7.3.11: Suppose (Q, S(X∗), τ) be a S-generalized state machine define 
congruence relation on S(X+)∗ = S(X∗\ Λ).  
 
Problem 7.3.12: Define Smarandache cascade using SFFSM.  
 
Problem 7.3.13: Define the concept of Smarandache strongly connected.

The author studies the Smarandache Fuzzy Algebra, which, like its predecessor Fuzzy 
Algebra, arose from the need to define structures that were more compatible with the real 
world where the grey areas mattered, not only black or white.  
 
In any human field, a Smarandache n-structure on a set S means a weak structure {w0} on S 
such that there exists a chain of proper subsets Pn–1 ⊂ Pn–2 ⊂ … ⊂ P2 ⊂ P1 ⊂ S whose 
corresponding structures verify the chain {wn–1} f {wn–2} f  … f  {w2} f {w1} f  {w0}, 
where ‘f ’ signifies ‘strictly stronger’ (i.e. structure satisfying more axioms). This book is 
referring to a Smarandache 2-algebraic structure (two levels only of structures in algebra) on 
a set S, i.e. a weak structure {w0} on S such that there exists a proper subset P of S, which is 
embedded with a stronger structure {w1}.  
 
a) The case of a single binary operation:  
 
Let M be an algebraic structure with a single binary operation ‘*’ (for example: a 
groupoid, or semigroup, etc.) Then, a fuzzy algebraic structure is a function µ : M → [0, 
1], such that µ(x * y) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)} for all x, y ∈ M.  
 
Let S be a Smarandache algebraic structure with a single binary operation ‘*’ (for 
example: a Smarandache groupoid, or Smarandache semigroup etc.) and P a proper subset 
of S where P has a stronger algebraic structure than S under the same operation. Then, a 
Smarandache fuzzy algebraic structure is a function µ : S → [0, 1] such that for all x, y ∈ 
P one has µ(x * y) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)} and µ(x–1) = µ(x).  
 
 
b) The case of a double binary operation:  
 
Let M be an algebraic structure with two binary operations ‘*’ and ‘•’, (for example: a 
ring, or field, etc.) Then a fuzzy algebraic structure is a function µ : M → [0, 1], such 
that: µ(x * y) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)} and µ(x • y) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)} for all x, y ∈ M.  
 
Let S be a Smarandache algebraic structure with a two binary operations, ‘*’ and ‘•’ (for 
example: a Smarandache ring, or Smarandache field, etc.) and P a proper subset of S 
where P has a stronger algebraic structure than S under the same operations. Then, a 
Smarandache fuzzy algebraic structure is a function µ : S → [0, 1] such that for all x, y ∈ 
P one has µ(x * y) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)} and, when y ≠ 0, µ(x • y–1) ≥ min{µ(x), µ(y)}.  
 
 
Properties of Smarandache fuzzy semigroups, 
groupoids, loops, bigroupoids, biloops, non-associative 
rings, birings, vector spaces, semirings, semivector 
spaces, non-associative semirings, bisemirings, near-
rings, non-associative near-rings, and binear-rings are 
presented in the second part of this book together with 
examples, solved and unsolved problems, and 
theorems.  
 
Also 
applications 
of 
Smarandache 
groupoids,         
near-rings, and semi-rings in automaton theory, in 
error-correcting codes, and in the construction of S-
sub-biautomaton can be found in the last chapter.
