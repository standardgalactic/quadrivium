Utilization of Yarosite Minerals

Development as Ethanol Gas Sensors

Introduction
Ethanol belongs to the Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) that cause some prob-
lems in human life. VOCs have been utilized by the industrial and transportation
sectors, as well as other domestic activities [1]. Therefore, the protection against the
dangers of ethanol is imperative. This protection should be broadly applied to drunk
driving detection that may prevent accidents or food processing to prevent irritation
or even poisoning to the worker [2]. Moreover, ethanol can quickly evaporate, which
causes it to become a pollutant for the environment and causes danger to the human
body. Hence, it is necessary to monitor the ethanol level in the air [3]. In addition,
Kong et al. claimed that air pollution harms human health and has become a hidden
killer [4]. These problems motivate researchers worldwide to develop sensors for
detecting harmful gases, especially ethanol.
The ethanol gas sensor has been developed using metal oxide semiconductors
(MOS). MOS have attracted attention as promising materials for gas sensor appli-
cations due to their easy fabrication, low cost, and chemical stability [5]. MOS is
divided into two types: N-type and P-type semiconductors. N-type semiconductors
provide high sensitivity. However, the stability and selectivity are still limited. There-
fore, P-type semiconductors appear to be promising materials that play an important
role in the application as sensing materials [6]. As sensing materials, P-type semi-
conductors have considerable good characteristics and provide better value in terms

of stability and maintaining a low temperature [7]. P-type semiconductors also offer
several advantages as sensing materials. Qomaruddin et al. revealed P-type semi-
conductors are beneﬁcial when applied as sensing materials. They have a higher
concentration of oxygen molecules chemisorb, can promote selective oxidation of
various VOCs, and have lower humidity dependence [8]. One form of P-type semi-
conductor is LaFeO3, which has been widely used by many researchers and is in
demand to be applied as sensing materials, especially to detect ethanol gases due to
their fast response [9]. LaFeO3 also has good conductivity and redox properties in
a wide range of temperatures, contributing to its excellent performance in detecting
gases [10]. However, LaFeO3 has a high resistance and requires considerable effort
to improve. Some researchers solved these problems with the addition of doping
[11].
The addition of doping to LaFeO3 can be accomplished using various methods
such as the addition of single doping or double-doping (co-doping). The addition of
single doping to LaFeO3 was conducted by Suhendi et al. Their work added the ZnO
as single-doping to LaFeO3. Suhendi et al. also performed the addition of co-doping
that consisted of ZnO and CaO to LaFeO3. These two studies found that the addition
of doping inﬂuences the performance of LaFeO3. It was reported that the response
of LaFeO3 also increased with doping [12, 13].
However, the cost of research with the addition of doping is higher. Therefore,
researchers are now starting to look for a way to reduce the ﬁnancing of research. One
of those ways is utilizing the extraction of natural resources. The natural resource
that has been attracting attention is the yarosite minerals because of they contain
high Fe2O3 and can be used as a precursor in the synthesis of LaFeO3. Syarif et al.
claimed that yarosite minerals are found in abundance at up to 55.9% in Indonesia
[14]. Syarif et al. also extracted the yarosite minerals to be Fe2O3 and found that there
were some impurities, as shown in Table 1, as reported by Ariyani et al. [15]. These
impurities had some effects, especially on the performance of a gas sensor detecting
ethanol gases. Impurities play an essential role in the gas sensor performances on the
surface area of the materials. Despite this, impurities caused a detrimental effect on
the gas sensor performance [16]. Therefore, modiﬁcations are required to improve
the performance. It can be conducted by adding doping. With the utilization of natural
resources, the addition of doping is not too burdensome in ﬁnancing. Doping can
help the main materials, in this case, LaFeO3, that have high impurities to bind the
oxygenatominthetarget, especiallyinethanol gases. It will increasetheresponseand
provide good performances [17]. Then, this work was aimed to obtain the material
that has a good property to apply as ethanol gas sensors.

Synthesis of LaFeO3 Metal Oxide Semiconductor
LaFeO3 offers advantages when applied as ethanol gas sensors due to their respon-
sive properties. Therefore, some researchers produced the LaFeO3 for sensor appli-
cation with several synthesis methods. One synthesis method with more advantages

for sensor application is co-precipitation. The co-precipitation method can produce
LaFeO3 with good characteristics, for instance with small grain size that is useful for
gas sensor application [18, 19]. The small grain size produces a more receptive gas
sensor with high responses and sensitivity, but the excessive decrease of grain size
provides a negative impact, such as the decreased stability of the material’s struc-
tures [20]. The co-precipitation method can be achieved using several procedures as
illustrated in Fig. 1. These illustrations explain several steps required in producing
LaFeO3. For some modiﬁcations or when needed for their application, doping can
be added to LaFeO3 for several speciﬁc purposes. One of them is to improve the
performance of gas detection.
Some precursors can be used to produce LaFeO3. For example, in the study
conducted by Suhendi et al. in 2019 [21], LaFeO3 is produced from the precursor
consisting of LaCl3 · H2O and Fe2O3, obtained from the yarosite minerals extraction.
Each precursor is dissolved in distilled water and an acid solution, respectively, for
LaCl3 · H2O and Fe2O3. These dissolving processes are conducted for about 30 min
for LaCl3.H2O and 20 h for Fe2O3. The Fe2O3 is hard to dissolve because of the
impurities contained in it. These impurities originate from the yarosite minerals, as
explained in introduction. Then, these two solutions are mixed and stirred using a
magnetic stirrer for about 30 min until the solution becomes homogeneous. Further-
more, the homogeneous solution is slowly added with ammonia hydroxide (NH4OH)
at 25% until the pH = 7. After that, the solution is left for a night to produce the
precipitation. The precipitate produced is then ﬁltered and dried for 6 h at 100 °C.
Lastly, the precipitate is also calcined. In this work, Suhendi et al. carried out the
calcined process twice, respectively at 600 °C for 2 h and 800 °C for 3 h. To obtain
the uniform particle of LaFeO3, the calcined product is then crushed into powder.
Furthermore, Yin et al. declared that LaFeO3 that has been produced can be
explored, and its performances can be improved with the addition of doping [22].
These addition processes are conducted during the synthesis processes, as evident in
the ﬁrst step. For example, to produce LaFeO3 with Sr doping, Suhendi et al. mixed
three solutions: LaCl3 · H2O solution, Fe2O3 solution, and SrCl2 · 6H2O solution
[21]. The next step is conducted similar to the LaFeO3 synthesis procedures.

Several variables in this synthesis procedure, such as dissolving time, drying
temperature, and calcined temperature, can be changed according to the require-
ment or the desired yield of the LaFeO3 product that is adjusted according to the
application.

LaFeO3 Properties and Sensing Mechanism
To ensure the performance of LaFeO3 synthesized from natural resources, some char-
acterizations need to be conducted. The characterizations include crystal, morpho-
logical and electrical properties characterization. As mentioned above (in Sect. 1),
to improve the performance of LaFeO3, some modiﬁcations are required, namely
the addition of single-doping or co-doping. These studies were reported by Suhendi
et al. in 2021 and 2022, respectively.

Suhendi et al. [13]
The single doping is conducted using ZnO that is added to LaFeO3. The studies
reported that the impurities still remain and inﬂuence the performance. It is detected
from the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) pattern, which shows the existence of the Fe2O3.
It also occurs in co-doping studies, as shown in Fig. 2. In the synthesis process,
the Fe2O3 is not perfectly dissolved. However, these materials still provide reliable
performance in detecting ethanol gases.
Then, the crystal structure characterization also informs that single-doping or
co-doping also inﬂuences the crystallite size. The LaFeO3 crystallite size decreases
when the single-doping or co-doping is added. This is reported in Table 2. This
information is a positive effort to improve its performance. The smallest crystallite
size will increase the response of sensing materials to detect the gases [12].
The other characterization is Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). This char-
acterization informs the morphological structure. It is the particle size that can be
calculated from the image with a certain magniﬁcation, as shown in Fig. 3. Suhendi
et al. also informed that the doping inﬂuences the particle size. The particle size
of LaFeO3 decreases when the single-doping or co-doping is added [12, 13]. The
LaFeO3 has the particle size of about 0.56 μm, it is decreased to 0.36 μm and 0.29 μm
respectively due to single-doping and co-doping.
The performance test can be initiated with resistance measurement of the mate-
rials, namely LaFeO3 and LaFeO3 with single-doping or co-doping. This process
produces the graphic of the resistance function to the temperature, as shown in Fig. 4.
It informed that the resistance would increase as the concentration of the ethanol gas
increases, conﬁrming that LaFeO3 and LaFeO3 with single-doping or co-doping are

gas concentration [26]. In addition, the dopant also strongly affects the gas response.
It supports the ﬁndings by Gao et al., who found that the dopant increases according
to the response of the gas sensors [27].

Fig. 5 The inﬂuence of ethanol gas concentration on the response of LaFeO3 and LaFeO3 with
single or co-doping
Table 3 informs that co-doping provides the highest response to ethanol gases.
Apart from that, doping subsequently decreases the operating temperature of the
gas sensors. It means that co-doping plays an important role in the performance of
LaFeO3. Nevertheless, excessive doping will decrease performance.
This work also studied the inﬂuence of ethanol gas concentrations. This study was
tested each material that consist of LaFeO3 and LaFeO3 with single-doping or co-
doping to the ethanol gas in the range concentration of about 100 ppm, 200 ppm, and
300 ppm. The test informs that the responses were increasing as increased the ethanol
gas concentration as shown in Fig. 5. This results also shows the best response of
co-doping and it can conclude that the co-doping play an important role in the ethanol
gas sensor studies. It known from each concentration that the co-doping exhibited
the best responses.
This results also detailed in Table 4. The co-doping shows the best result caused
by the characteristics of the materials that produce more holes. That conditions were
facilitate the electron on the material becoming more energetic to jump from the
valence band to the conduction band. Also, this condition makes the materials was
easy to bind the target to increasing the response [13].
Then, the sensing mechanism through which LaFeO3 detect ethanol gases is
explained by the adsorption and desorption of gas molecules on the surface of mate-
rials When the surface of materials was exposed to air (in the condition without
ethanol gases), oxygen molecules absorbed on the material’s surface to produce
chemisorbed oxygen. The chemisorbed oxygen caught the electrons of the conduc-
tion band (CB). These processes can be explained by the reaction shown below

These reactions are caused by the gas sensors’ operating temperature, which is
100–300 °C. If the operating temperature is more than 300 °C, the reaction should
be explained below:
O−(ads) + e−(CB)O2−(ads) (> 300 ◦C)
Next, when the material surface is exposed to ethanol, the adsorbed oxygen reacts
with ethanol and releases the trapped electrons to the gas-sensing material, in this
case, LaFeO3 and LaFeO3 with single-doping or co-doping. These processes caused
the gas-sensing material’s resistance to increase when exposed to ethanol gas, as
shown in Fig. 4. The interaction of the adsorbed oxygen and ethanol can be explained
in the reaction shown in the equation below [31]:
C2H5OH (gas) + 6O−2CO2 + 3H2O + 6e−

Conclusions
The LaFeO3 materials have been introduced as one of the promising sensing mate-
rials, especially for detecting ethanol gases, due to their advantages. LaFeO3 has
been claimed to provide good responses and sensitivity. Then, as explained above
(in Sect. 2), LaFeO3 can be obtained from several precursors, and one of the unique
things is the utilization of natural resources from yarosite minerals. The yarosite
minerals are extracted to be Fe2O3. The utilization of yarosite mineral extracted as
Fe2O3 precursor in the LaFeO3 synthesis offers several advantages, such as decreased
cost of research, and it has become a research novelty. However, several problems
have emerged; for instance, the high impurities contained in it cause the Fe2O3
to become hard to dissolve. It has become a challenge, and future works should
focus on rectifying this problem. The solution may be found in the extraction of
yarosite minerals processes that aims to obtain the Fe2O3 with high purities or with
a longer dissolving process in the synthesis to produce the Fe2O3 solution that can
be completely dissolved.

Introduction
Gas sensors function by converting the presence of gases into electrical signals
through various chemical and physical reactions, which helps in identifying the
gas type and its concentration. These sensors are widely employed for detecting
ﬂammable, explosive, toxic, and harmful gases, and are also used in environmental
monitoring [1]. Recently, sensors that rely on surface-controlled resistance have
gained popularity. These devices predominantly utilize metal oxide semiconductors
as their sensing elements [2]. The high adsorption capacity and strong reactivity of
these materials are attributed to the plenty of free electrons in their conduction bands
and the presence of oxygen vacancies on their surfaces, which facilitate electrical
measurements [3]. Metal oxide materials are preferred in gas sensing applications
due to their low production costs, favourable chemical and physical properties, and
ease of preparation [4].

Types of Gas Sensors
Figure 1 illustrates the basic design of a gas sensor (or chemical sensor). The sensor
includes a ﬁlter that isolates the response to the target gas (also known as the analyte)
from other gases or parameters. This ﬁlter may be a physical barrier that permits
only speciﬁc molecules to reach the detection area or could be a simpler mechanism

Fig. 1 The basic
components of a gas sensor
based on a characteristic feature of the target gas, such as its absorption spectrum
wavelength. The sensor’s output may be either a single measurement or a more
complex, time-varying signal that has been processed through electrical ﬁltering or
other methods.
A review of the sensor technologies and their principles of operation will be
discussed in this section.
2.1
Semiconductor Sensors
Semiconductor gas sensors detect target gas concentrations by evaluating variations
in electrical resistance that occur when metal oxides are heated. These sensors operate
on the principle of reversible adsorption of gases onto a heated oxide surface, typi-
cally made of tin oxides applied to a silicon base through chemical vapour deposition.
When the target gas adsorbs and undergoes catalytic oxidation on the oxide surface,
the resistance of the material changes. This resistance variation is then used to deter-
mine the concentration of the gas. The sensor maintains a stable operating tempera-
ture of around 200–250 °C through a heater at its base. N-type semiconductors are
particularly effective for detecting reducing gases due to their signiﬁcant conduc-
tance changes when electrons are introduced, while p-type semiconductors are more
suited for detecting oxidizing gases. Commonly used oxides for n-type semicon-
ductors include SnO2, ZnO, In2O3, MoO3, and WO3, which are often employed
to detect toxic gases like carbon monoxide, hydrogen, oxygen, and alcohol. When
combustible gases interact with metal oxides, they introduce new electron states
within the material, leading to changes in its electrical resistance. Jin Huang and Qing
Wan reviewed recent developments in gas sensors featuring one-dimensional (1D)
nanostructures made from semiconducting metal oxides. Their review highlighted
advancements in device design, including innovations like self-heated low-power
sensors and electronic noses, as well as improvements in response analysis thanks
to progress in microelectronics [5]. Enhancing sensitivity and selectivity can be
attained by incorporating trace amounts of noble metals. For instance, A. Khodadadi
and colleagues found that adding 5% K2O–SnO2 samples improved sensitivity to

2
Gas Sensor: An Overview
13
methane and carbon monoxide by 40% [6]. In contrast, SnO2 with 5% Na2O showed
diminished sensitivity to carbon monoxide, whereas platinum addition enhanced the
sensor’s response to methane.
The sensitivity of thick-ﬁlm semiconductor gas sensors for detecting methane
and butane can be enhanced through the use of doping agents. These sensors can be
conﬁgured with either one-electrode or two-electrode setups. According to Korot-
cenkov [7], the one-electrode conﬁguration involves a metal resistor that serves as
both the heater and the measuring electrode. This is similar to hot-wire or pellistor
sensors, where a semiconductor oxide coating on a metal spiral connects with a plat-
inum (Pt) wire. To achieve optimal performance, the resistance of the semiconductor
should match Pt resistor at the operating temperature. Effective sensor performance
at these temperatures requires metal oxides with high conductivity, such as SnO2 and
In2O3. The two-electrode conﬁguration is less common and will not be covered here.
Shimanoe et al. [8] successfully developed a semiconductor nano-sized oxide using
MEMS technology and low power for detecting combustible gases, odours, and other
atmospheric gases. Takada et al. [9] introduced a new technique for detecting gases
like H2, CO and CH4. Additionally, Byeongdeok Yea et al. [10] highlighted advance-
ments in incorporating artiﬁcial intelligence into gas sensors, which has improved
sensitivity through techniques such as thermal modulation, novel sensor elements,
innovative sensor structures, new ﬁlter layers, and sensor arrays.
2.2
Catalytic Sensors
Catalytic sensors have been employed to detect volatile chemicals for nearly a
hundred years, with the ﬁrst catalytic combustion sensor created by Jonson in 1923
to monitor methane in mines [11]. Many metal oxides and their compounds exhibit
catalytic characteristics, but certain gases may ignite at lower temperatures if a partic-
ular chemical reaction happens. Usually, combustible gas mixtures ignite only when
they reach a speciﬁc temperature, a phenomenon referred to as catalytic combustion.
Catalytic gas sensors function based on this principle and use a Wheatstone bridge
to measure the output.
Catalytic gas sensors generally fall into two categories: thermoelectric and
pellistor. Early sensors used coil-shaped platinum wires, which, while generating
signiﬁcantheatandstrongsignals,wereinefﬁcientcatalystsforhydrocarboncombus-
tion. Issues such as platinum evaporation, which increased wire resistance, and brit-
tleness at temperatures above 1000 °C, led to performance problems. To enhance
stability and resistance to shock, platinum wires were coated with metal oxides and
treated with catalysts like platinum, palladium, or thoria compounds.
Recently, micro hotplates have largely replaced platinum coils in gas sensors
due to their lower power consumption. These sensors feature a catalyst surface on
a hot plate, heated by a platinum resistor, which elevates the temperature to ignite
combustible gases. The concentration of gases is determined by monitoring resis-
tance changes in the platinum caused by temperature ﬂuctuations. Li et al. [12] have

14
P. Gupta et al.
made signiﬁcant advancements in this area by developing a two-beam microplate
for catalytic gas sensors using MEMS technology. Their design, which demonstrates
a sensitivity of 2.4 mV per percent methane at 50% LEL and a 30% reduction in
power consumption compared to traditional micro hotplates, represents a notable
improvement in efﬁciency and performance.
2.3
Thermal Conductivity Gas Sensor
Thermal conductivity measurements have been used in gas analysis for an extended
period [13]. This technique is especially effective for identifying gases with thermal
conductivities greater than that of air, such as methane and hydrogen. However,
it is less effective for gases with thermal conductivities similar to or lower than
air, including ammonia, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and butane. The method
involves evaluating heat transfer between a hotter element and a cooler one, based
on the thermal conductivity of the medium.
The early design of thermal conductivity gas sensors, known as “pellistor-like
sensors,” includes two inert resistor beads with an embedded thermoresistor. These
beads are placed in a gas chamber containing a reference gas and are connected via a
Wheatstone bridge circuit, similar to catalytic gas sensors. When exposed to a target
gas mixture, the sensor’s resistor experiences changes in heat loss based on the target
gas’s thermal conductivity compared to the reference gas. These changes in heat loss
result in variations in the resistance and temperature of the beads, which are detected
as imbalances in the Wheatstone bridge.
The second type of thermal conductivity sensor simpliﬁes the design by omitting
the reference cell. It features a hot element and a cool element, with heat transfer
between them governed by the thermal conductivity of the gas. Pascal Tardy and
colleagues developed a dynamic thermal conductivity sensor for detecting carbon
monoxide, hydrogen, and methane using the transient response of a SiC microplate
[14]. Isolde Simon and Michael Arndt created a micromachined thermal conductivity
sensor, which showed promising results in tests and was integrated into an automotive
hydrogen detector due to its compact size and low power requirements [15]. Recently,
G. de Graaf and team advanced this technology with a MEMS-based thermal conduc-
tivity gas detection system. Their system features highly sensitive thermal sensors
for hydrogen detection, with surface-micromachined devices providing better perfor-
mance compared to bulk-micromachined ones [16]. The micro-TCD, built on a
silicon wafer, uses thermopile temperature sensors to detect changes in effective
thermal resistance caused by the gas’s thermal conductivity, incorporating a central
heating element resistor on a thin membrane.

2
Gas Sensor: An Overview
15
2.4
Electrochemical Gas Sensors
These sensors facilitate the diffusion of gases through a permeable membrane to an
electrode, where they engage in either reduction or oxidation reactions, depending on
the sensor type. When a target gas interacts with the sensor, it produces an electrical
signal that correlates with the gas concentration. Typically, an electrochemical gas
sensor features a working electrode (or sensing electrode) and a counter electrode,
separated by a thin layer of electrolyte. The gas traverses a hydrophobic barrier and
a small capillary opening to reach the electrode surface and react with the sensor.
The membrane’s role is to ensure a strong electrical signal at the detecting elec-
trode while preventing the leakage of liquid electrolytes. It also includes a reference
electrode, which maintains a consistent potential at the sensing electrode through
ongoing electrochemical reactions. The target gas interaction results in a current
ﬂow between the working and counter electrodes, with ionic charges moved by the
electrolyte.
Various electrochemical sensors have been developed to detect different gases.
For instance, J. F. Currie and colleagues designed a micromachined, thin, solid-
state sensor that can detect CO2, NO2, and SO2 simultaneously [17]. Sathiyamoorthi
and team created a sensor for ﬂuorine and chlorine detection [18]. Tian Gan and
Shengshui Hu reviewed the use of graphene materials in electrochemical sensors
to enhance sensitivity [19]. Lu et al. highlighted that nanomaterials, owing to their
high surface-to-volume ratio, small size, and low power consumption, are ideal for
gas-sensing applications [20]. Recent advancements include integrating microelec-
tronic systems (MEMS) into electrochemical microsensors, with suggestions to boost
sensitivity by applying polymer coatings to carbon nanotube-based nanosensors. For
carbonmonoxidedetection,theelectrochemicalsensorundergoesaspeciﬁcchemical
reaction.
CO + H2O →CO2 + 2H+ + 2e−
(1)
Equation 1 illustrates the process of an oxidation reaction at the sensor electrode,
where CO2 diffuses into the surrounding environment and positively charged ions
migrate into the electrolyte.
2O + 4H+ + 4e−→2H2O
(2)
Equation 2 shows that the reduction reaction at the counter electrode offsets the
oxidation reaction occurring at the working electrode. Electrons generated at one
electrode lead to water absorption at the other, with this process being reversed at
each electrode. Positively charged hydrogen ions move through the electrolyte as
carbon monoxide diffuses through the air. Similarly, Eq. 3 depicts the electrochem-
ical reaction for hydrogen, where hydrogen gas diffuses to the sensor electrode and
undergoes oxidation. According to Eq. 4, this reaction changes the potential of the
detecting electrode, resulting in the reduction of oxygen.

where Z is the number of electrons or molecules exchanged, Q is the rate of hydrogen
conversion in moles per second, and F is the Faraday constant = 96486.7 As per
mol.
2.5
Optical Gas Sensors
This sensor type relies on detecting optical absorption or emission scattering at
speciﬁc wavelengths. Typically, an optical gas sensor includes a light-emitting
component, a photodetector, a light-responsive gas-sensing element, and a ﬁlter to
measure ﬂuorescence or phosphorescence. These sensors often use thin layers of
materials like palladium or thermochromic oxides applied along an optical ﬁber,
known as an “optode.” One common optical gas sensor is the infrared gas sensor,
which will be discussed further. Optical sensors have been utilized for detecting
combustible gases such as hydrogen for some time. These often feature an optical
ﬁber coated with palladium and titanium, using interferometry to detect hydrogen.
For instance, Crawford Massie and colleagues developed an affordable, portable
optical sensor for methane detection, showing high sensitivity and reliability in chal-
lenging conditions [21]. L. N. Acquaroli and team created an optically porous silicon
sensor tested with isopropyl alcohol vapour, capable of detecting very low concen-
trations [22]. Manap and others designed an optical ﬁber sensor for ammonia, inves-
tigating the effects of CO2 and O2 on detection [23]. S. Okazaki and colleagues
developed a ﬁber-optic hydrogen sensor using tungsten trioxide (WO3) catalysts,
demonstrating effective hydrogen detection even at room temperature [24]. M.
Girschikofsky and team introduced a planar Bragg grating sensor that detects chem-
icals such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, showing excellent sensitivity to these
substances [25].

Gas Sensor: An Overview

2.6
Infrared Gas Sensor
An infrared sensor relies on detecting electromagnetic radiation and can utilize
various types of detectors, such as thermoelectric, thermistor-bolometer, pyroelec-
tric, or photon detectors. The sensor system includes an infrared source, like an
incandescent lamp or a heated ﬁlament, which helps in detecting gases such as CO2,
CO, and various hydrocarbons. The optical component of the sensor can be either
dispersive or non-dispersive. Dispersive optical ﬁbers use elements like prisms or
gratings, while non-dispersive ﬁbers use optical bandpass ﬁlters for gas detection.
The gas cell within the sensor allows the light path to interact with the target
gas. Infrared gas sensors can identify a range of gases, including methane, ethane,
propane, butane, benzene, toluene, xylene, and alcohols such as methanol and
ethanol. For example, H. Okajima and colleagues developed an infrared gas sensor
that effectively measures gas absorption between 0 and 97% [26]. Dong Chen and
team created a tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy system for hydrogen
sulﬁde detection [27], while Guangjun Zhang and colleagues designed a compact
CO2 sensor using infrared absorption techniques [28].
Infrared CO2 sensors generally use two main optical conﬁgurations: time-double
beam and space-double beam. The space-double beam setup emits one infrared beam
from the source and detects it with two parallel plate detectors. The time-double beam
conﬁguration involves emitting a single infrared beam and capturing two photons at
different times and wavelengths. In the space-double beam design, a cone-shaped
air chamber can enhance performance. This design includes two sapphire windows,
an air chamber, an infrared source, and an infrared detector, allowing for precise
CO2 measurements from 0 to 3% with an accuracy of 0.026%. Naoya Kasai and
colleagues explored a system using a carbon infrared emitter and an infrared camera
for detecting propane, a ﬂammable gas [29].
3
Properties of Gas Sensors
Key performance indicators for gas sensors include sensitivity, selectivity, response
and recovery times, detection limit, resolution, stability, and operating temperature
[30]. For gas sensors that use semiconducting metal oxides (SMOxs), these factors
can be improved by techniques such as reducing particle size to the nanoscale, doping
(altering) the sensing material, and reﬁning the sensor design.
Sensitivity measures how the physical or chemical properties of the sensing mate-
rial change in response to a target gas. It is typically expressed as the ratio of the
sensor’s resistance when exposed to the target gas compared to its resistance in air,
assuming the target gas acts as an oxidizing agent:
S = Rg/Ra
(6)

18
P. Gupta et al.
For a reductive gas, sensitivity is deﬁned as the ratio of the device’s resistance in air
to its resistance in the presence of the target gas:
S = Ra/Rg
(7)
In this context, Rg represents the resistance of the sensor element in the target
gas atmosphere, measured in Ohms, while Ra denotes the resistance of the sensor
element in air, in Ohms [31]. Additionally, the analytical signal can be expressed
as the absolute difference between the sensor’s resistance in the target gas and its
resistance in air [32]:
S = (Ra −Rg)/Ra
(8)
The effectiveness of gas sensors is signiﬁcantly impacted by factors such as the
porosity of the sensing material, operating temperature, presence of dopants, and
crystallite size. Since sensing reactions mainly occur on the surface of the mate-
rial, controlling the particle size of semiconductor materials is crucial for improving
sensor sensitivity. Nanocrystalline materials, with their increased speciﬁc surface
area, enhance sensitivity due to greater adsorption capacity. For example, reducing
particle size has enabled the detection of hydrogen at sub-ppm levels [33]. Addition-
ally, nanostructured TiO2-based materials have shown potential for humidity detec-
tion at room temperature and exhibit high selectivity towards gases like H2S, CH3OH,
and C2H5OH at lower temperatures. These materials offer excellent mechanical
stability, rapid response and recovery times, and low energy consumption.
Selectivity is the sensor’s ability to distinguish between different gases or identify
a speciﬁc gas within a mixture. Improving selectivity often involves surface modi-
ﬁcation or bulk doping with catalytic additives to enhance target gas adsorption.
Research indicates that sensors utilizing SnO2 and TiO2 nanostructures achieve high
selectivity through nanoparticle loading or the addition of redox-active elements,
which create new active sites or alter the material’s electronic structure for more
selective gas detection [34].
Stability, or reproducibility refers to a sensor’s ability to maintain consistent
performanceovertime.Preheatingsensorstotemperatureshigherthantheiroperating
conditions can improve the stability of their sensitive layers.
Response time is the interval required for a sensor to detect a change in gas
concentration and register a certain percentage of its initial value. Doping metal
oxides with nanoparticles can reduce this response time. For instance, Pd-doped
SnO2 sensors have demonstrated response times of less than 10 s [35], while Pt-
doped SnO2 nanoﬁbers respond to H2S in about 1 s, compared to 2–7 s for undoped
SnO2 nanoﬁbers [36].
Recovery time is the duration needed for a sensor to return to its baseline value
after the target gas concentration drops to zero. Longer recovery times can result
from slow surface reactions but can be accelerated by doping with metal catalysts
like Pd and Ag. Pd-doped SnO2 hollow nanoﬁbers, for example, exhibit reduced

2
Gas Sensor: An Overview
19
recovery times for gases such as H2, CO, CH4, and C2H5OH, due to the catalytic
effect of Pd, which speeds up oxygen adsorption.
Both response and recovery times are inﬂuenced by the sensor’s operating temper-
ature. Studies show that increasing the temperature of an SnO2 single nanobelt-based
sensor from 60 to 80 °C reduces response time from 220 to 60 s, though recovery
time more than doubles [37]. Similarly, research has shown that while sensitivity
to NO2 decreases with higher temperatures, response time improves with elevated
temperatures and NO2 concentrations for TiO2 nanoﬁbers [38].
The detection limit of a sensor is the lowest concentration of gas it can iden-
tify, while resolution refers to the smallest detectable change in concentration.
The working temperature range is where the sensor shows optimal sensitivity.
The design and dimensions of the sensor, including heater material and thickness,
are also crucial for performance. Temperature impacts sensitivity, selectivity, and
response time because adsorption and desorption processes, along with their activa-
tion energy, are temperature-dependent [39]. Effective gas sensors should minimize
power consumption and heat loss, with platinum being a promising material due to
its high-temperature performance and power efﬁciency [40]. Reducing heater elec-
trode thickness and optimizing heater design can improve temperature uniformity
and reduce power consumption.
Electrode geometry and gap size are also key factors inﬂuencing gas sensing.
Variations in electrode gap size can affect resistance and sensitivity. Research has
shown that the optimal gap size varies with gas concentration, with larger gaps being
more sensitive to high NO2 concentrations and smaller gaps improving selectivity for
lower concentrations [41]. Increasing electrode width can further enhance selectivity,
as demonstrated by studies showing that sensors with wider electrodes (50 µm)
exhibit greater sensitivity compared to those with narrower electrodes (10 µm) [42].

Applications of Gas Sensors
Although it is included under “Environment,” monitoring interior air quality might
just as easily be considered a long-term health use. Several industries are united by
the automotive industry, which is actually large enough to be taken into account
separately.
4.1
Healthcare
For centuries, distinctive odours have been linked to various human ailments, but
only recently has this connection gained recognition as a diagnostic tool. This shift
is largely due to advancements in analytical instruments capable of reliably detecting
the primary components of these odours. Future sensors could become as compact
and affordable as breathalyzers used by law enforcement to measure alcohol levels,

20
P. Gupta et al.
potentially replacing traditional diagnostic methods in medical practice. For instance,
the presence of ammonia in breath, produced by Helicobacter pylori in the stomach
to neutralize acidity and create a favourable environment, can indicate an H. pylori
infection, a known cause of stomach ulcers. Detection of ammonia might lead to a
referral to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation, even if the infection is only
mildly present.
Instrumentation is critical because the oral cavity can contain various volatile
substances that might interfere with ammonia detection. Another example is the
measurement of nitric oxide (NO) in exhaled breath, which can serve as an early
indicator of asthma. CHEMFETs or carbon nanotube-based resistors that detect
NO through resistance changes could potentially be integrated into smartphones,
allowing for preliminary self-diagnosis. The development of an “electronic nose,”
capable of simultaneously detecting a range of volatile compounds, is expected to
be a valuable asset in medical diagnostics. Eventually, such technology could evolve
into a clinical diagnostic system, utilizing a database to compare sensor array proﬁles
with clinical diagnoses.
4.2
Security
Gas sensors have diverse applications that often intersect with multiple domains.
One prominent use is the early detection of explosives by analyzing trace amounts
of volatile compounds in travelers’ luggage. Despite restrictions imposed by the
Geneva Convention, poisonous gas sensors continue to be crucial in speciﬁc military
scenarios, as well as in private bomb shelters and civil defense organizations.
In forensic investigations, which often focus on solid, non-volatile materials due
to the ephemeral nature of many analytes, gas sensors can still have valuable appli-
cations. More commonly, gas sensors are essential for ensuring safety in domestic
settings, particularly where combustion takes place and ventilation may be inade-
quate, such as with carbon monoxide detectors. They also play a key role in indus-
trial safety, monitoring a wide array of gaseous substances. Many countries have
established health and safety regulations that require stringent monitoring standards.
It’s important to clarify that the breathalyzer used by police to detect recent alcohol
consumption is technically categorized as a dosimeter rather than a sensor, as it
provides an irreversible measurement of ethanol concentration.
4.3
Environment
This category includes a wide range of applications related to monitoring air quality.
It covers both indoor air quality (IAQ), which pertains to environments within homes,
ofﬁces, and transportation settings such as airplanes, trains, and cars, and outdoor air
quality(OAQ),withaparticularemphasisonurbanpollutionwherevehicleemissions

are a major concern. Optical sensors are employed to oversee processes such as stack
emissions, ventilation systems, and both indoor and outdoor air quality assessments.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from synthetic materials like carpets
and upholstery are increasingly recognized as health risks. The variety of these
compounds complicates their measurement and control. One strategy involves moni-
toring indoor carbon dioxide levels; if these levels are comparable to outdoor levels,
it suggests proper ventilation and helps prevent VOC buildup. In humid regions like
Hong Kong, controlling indoor humidity is essential to prevent mold growth, which
can release additional VOCs. Although some VOCs are not harmful, they can cause
allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.
Outdoor air quality sensors focus on detecting ozone and nitrogen oxides, while
ﬁne particulate matter—primarily from diesel engines and construction activities—
represents a signiﬁcant urban issue. These tiny particles, due to their small size,
behave similarly to gases and present challenges for accurate measurement with
existing technology.

Conclusions
Human ability to detect gases can be signiﬁcantly enhanced through advancements
in sensor technology. This chapter reviews the most widely used gas sensor tech-
nologies and their key applications, including catalytic, electrochemical, optical,
thermal conductivity, and acoustic gas sensors. The ideal sensor characteristics, such
as high sensitivity, selectivity, rapid response time, and quick recovery, drive the trend
towards miniaturizing sensors. Modern sensors are predominantly fabricated using
microfabrication techniques, which produce sensors that are compact, cost-effective,
energy-efﬁcient, and low-power. Various methods like sputtering, airbrushing, spin
coating, and spraying have been utilized to create active layers in sensors.
Future research should focus on directly synthesizing the sensing layer onto the
substrate, as sensors with directly synthesized layers exhibit greater sensitivity due to
better nanoparticle adhesion. Additionally, employing gas sensor arrays with multi-
sensing capabilities can further enhance performance by providing faster response
and recovery times. This approach is particularly valuable for creating energy-
efﬁcient, low-power, and compact sensors that can simultaneously detect multiple
gases or atmospheric pollutants, making it a promising area for future exploration.

Introduction
Rapid fast-growing development due to industrialization and urbanization has some-
what directly or indirectly led to the urge of using various chemical products, particu-
larly their extensive usage in households and industries. A major concern lies because
of the formation and release of harmful chemicals that gives rise to various diseases
[1–5]. Thus, detecting these chemicals is majorly a challenge and in order to sufﬁce
the challenge there is need of precise and highly sensitive detection devices which
are otherwise undetectable by human ability. A lot of work in the past witnesses the
ﬁeld of chemical sensors that are capable of detecting harmful substances in the envi-
ronment. In the recent past, chemical sensors have been extensively used in the life
environmental pollution measurement, environmental monitoring, and biochemical
sensors [6–8].
The entire measurement of the chemical constitution of the environment whether
it be a state of a liquid or gas [9] can be easily computed with a device which we
refer to as a chemical sensor. With greater stability, high sensitivity, good reaction
time and lifespan [10–12] chemical sensors have all marked its way in various appli-
cations. The two-step operation in sensors includes ﬁrstly a change in their electrical

properties due to the changes in the external environment or chemical reactions and
secondly converting the signals to those which are easily perceived and recognized
by humans [13]. The principal element of a chemical sensor is the electrode material,
made typically of metal oxide semiconductor. With easy manufacturing, remarkable
electrical properties in environmental conditions, high sensitivity, low detection limit,
the use of metal oxide semiconductor helps us to measure multiple types of sensing
materials at the same time. Many materials like ZnO [14], SnO2 [15], Co3O4 [16],
Fe2O3 [17], Ca2O3 [18], In2O3 [19], have been actively researched so far.
Another n type structure belonging to II–VI group is Zinc oxide (ZnO) semi-
conductor with its extraordinary properties including wider bandgap, high excita-
tion binding energy and electron mobility [20], high stability, environmentally safe,
biocompatibility and low cost synthesis [21], is a widely accepted material used for
detecting toxic and harmful gases. It has therefore become the most popular choice in
gas sensing research. Due to the crystalline nature of ZnO, there is possibility of the
growth of various nanostructures viz. nanoparticles and 1D, 2D, and 3D structures
[22].
Due to the composition and structure of a number of transition metal oxides
(TMOs), like TiO2, ZnO, NiO, Fe2O3, and SnO2, with their intriguing physical
properties viz. high-temperature superconductivity, piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity,
magneticity, multi-stiffness, and resistivity [23–25], these can be variedly used in
semiconductors and in industries constituting sensors, solar cells, LEDs, and elec-
tronics.SynthesisofTMOscanbedonebyadoptingavarietyoftechniques.However,
their physical properties largely depend on the internal electronic structure and are
greatly inﬂuenced by element conﬁgurations, defects, and lattice distortions.
Graphene another promising 2D material has exceptional properties including
fairly high carrier mobility [26, 27], remarkable electrical and thermal conductivity
[28], large surface area [29], optical transmittance [30], and Young’s modulus signif-
icantly large. Due to its signiﬁcantly large surface area and atomic thickness, it stands
as an excellent material for sensors, especially more sensitivity for graphene-based
sensors [31]. The current chapter discusses therefore the chemical sensors made of
ZnO, binary metal oxide, and graphene oxide-based electrodes. These sensors can
effectively detect harmful organic substances and heavy metals.

features are some of its exemplary attributes. By altering the morphology of ZnO
nanomaterials, characteristic properties like transport rate of electrons, surface area,
electrical characteristics, and electrochemical stability [34, 35] are largely affected
and improved. Altering the size and morphology of ZnO nanomaterials also affects
the efﬁciency of electrochemical sensors for detecting unfavorable toxic chemicals.
In organic synthesis, Dichloromethane (DCM) as a common solvent plays a
very important role. It is also useful in metal surface degreasing, and electronics
industry [36]. Being highly toxic, it is a source of various health problems [37–
39] and thus considered as a probably carcinogenic for humans [40]. It is therefore
required to have a technique which is quick and cost wise effective so that even
low concentrations of DCM can be detected easily. The choice of electrochem-
ical methods owing to their extreme sensitivity, wider linear range, mobility, and
easy operation unavoidably can be used in semiconductor based electrodes. Many
alternative methods like gas chromatography [41], high-performance liquid chro-
matography [42], capillary electrophoresis [43], and spectrophotometry [44] can be
wisely used for detecting harmful VOCs, but their limitations like complex nature,
non-reasonable, and restricted mobility [45] cannot be neglected at any stage.
Figure 1 shows two FESEM images of ZnO nanostructures. The ﬁrst image
(Fig. 1a) shows a low magniﬁcation image of nano-pyramids (NPys) with a high
aspect ratio. The second image (Fig. 1b) shows a high magniﬁcation image of hexag-
onal pyramid-shaped structures with an average size of approximately 2–3 µm, a
base length of approximately 2 µm, and a top length of approximately 600 nm. The
inset in Fig. 1b shows a close assembly and accumulation of several hexagonal discs
transformed into pyramid-like structures.
The morphology of the hexagonal ZnO NPys can be analyzed using various
techniques such as TEM, high resolution (HR) TEM, and selected area electron
diffraction (SAED) as presented in Fig. 2. The size of the pyramids as seen through
low resolution TEM image in Fig. 2a, and those observed in the FESEM analysis
(Fig. 1) are similar in size with each other. The HRTEM image in Fig. 2b provides
a clear view of lattice fringes indicating that the as-grown hexagonal ZnO NPys

have excellent crystal quality. The Fast Fourier transform (FFT) from the HRTEM
image (Fig. 2c) reveals a well-deﬁned lattice fringe pattern with spacing between
the planes as ~0.26 nm corresponding to the typical hexagonal wurtzite ZnO crystal.
These lattice fringes are found to be directed towards (100) planes, suggesting that
the hexagonal ZnO NPys preferably orient themselves in the direction of [0001] axis.
The corresponding SAED pattern (Fig. 2d) displays the same pattern as that of the
FFT image in Fig. 2c, further conﬁrming the crystalline wurtzite hexagonal phase of
the synthesized hexagonal ZnO NPys.

ture and lattice constants a = b = 0.40014 nm, c = 0.52338 nm [47, 48]. The

lattice parameters obtained resembled Wurtzite bulk ZnO, because of the absence of
diffraction peak, conﬁrming ZnO NPys hexagonal with Wurtzite structure. At plane
(101), a strong diffraction peak signiﬁes the growth of ZnO NPys along the c-axis.
Using FTIR spectroscopy, the chemical constitution and structure of the synthesized
hexagonal ZnO NPys can be analysed in the range 400–4000 cm−1, as shown in
Fig. 3b. Formation of ZnO can be conﬁrmed by observing an intense IR band at
~497 cm−1 assuring the presence of metal to oxygen (M–O) stretching [49]. The
low-intensity IR band of absorbed water at ~1640 cm−1 denotes bending vibration,
while the broad IR band of the hydroxyl group at ~3356 cm−1 corresponds to its
stretching mode with a single bond [50]. Also, the IR band for carbonate ions at
~876 cm−1 signiﬁes the bending vibration and stretching frequency [51]. Raman
spectroscopy is conducted to further conﬁrm the structure of the crystal and defects
of the grown hexagonal ZnO NPys. As seen in Fig. 3c, the most prominent Raman
band at ~437.7 cm−1 indicates ZnO, hexagonal wurtzite structure representing E2
mode as the strongest non-polar optical phonon [51]. Raman band at ~331.87 cm−1
corresponds to [E2 (high)-E2 (low)] as a phonon scattering process and ~540.26 cm−1
corresponding to E1 (LO) modes [52]. During the process of synthesis sometimes,
the bands are formed due to the presence of some structural or surface defects such
as zinc interstitials, oxygen vacancies, or their complexes [51]. The observed high
intensity E2 mode in the synthesized hexagonal ZnO NPys holds for a remarkable
structural and brilliant quality of crystal.
The current study aims in detecting the presence of dichloromethane (DCM),
a harmful chemical that acts as a dangerous element affecting and impacting the
humans, wildlife and the environment. The detection involves an electrochemical
method via cyclic voltammetry (CV). To achieve this, a hexagonal ZnO NPys modi-
ﬁed disposable SPE is used. The results of the study, as shown in Fig. 4, indicates
a signiﬁcant growth in current, especially in the cathodic current, when the modi-
ﬁed electrode is exposed to DCM and conversely, a low current without DCM. This
indicates the hexagonal ZnO NPys modiﬁed disposable SPE show excellent sensing
response that can be used for detecting low concentrations of DCM.
The electrochemical method is used for the detection of DCM using cyclic voltam-
metry(CV)ondisposableSPEmodiﬁedbyhexagonalZnONPysasshowninFig. 5a–
d. The sensing parameters can be evaluated by a range of CV plots, by altering both
the DCM concentrations as well as the scan rates in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte. With a
satisfactory retention coefﬁcient (R) ~ 0.982055, the disposable SPE modiﬁed by
hexagonal ZnO NPys derived chemical sensor with a sensitivity as high as ~293.5
μA/µM/cm2, an outstanding limit of detection (LOD) ~17.3 µM and linearity in
the range of ~100 nM–200 µM. A correlation can be established between the scan
rate and the cathodic peak current. At higher scan rates, enhanced electrocatalytic
activity and transfer of electron at a faster rate occurs due to greater surface area
and distinctive morphology of hexagonal ZnO NPys. Due to the diffusion-controlled
reaction, the electro-oxidation of DCM takes place over the surface of disposable
SPE modiﬁed by hexagonal ZnO NPys.
The disposable SPE modiﬁed by hexagonal ZnO NPys and the DCM chemical
sensor showing its high sensing performance is discussed here. The Fig. 6 represents

the steps of the fabricating DCM chemical sensor. The adsorption of the dissolved
oxygen in PBS takes place over the entire ZnO surface as it gets attracted towards its
surface. The adsorption of oxygen leads to ionization to active oxygenated species
such as O−, O2−, OH−, etc. which results in extracting electrons of hexagonal ZnO
NPys [53] from their conduction band. Consequently, depletion layer of an electron is
formed on the surface of hexagonal ZnO NPys [54, 55], and thus resistance increases.
There is a continuous decrease of the trapped electrons as they go to the conduction
band during an electrocatalytic reaction of DCM. Eventually, there is a decrease in
the conductance of the system with an increase in the conductance of hexagonal
ZnO NPys, escalating the electrochemical response seen in the CV results so as to
evaluate the selectivity of hexagonal ZnO NPys.
An experiment is conducted by testing the current-voltage characteristics in 0.1 M
PBS electrolyte with a mixture of chlorobenzene, toluene, benzene and DCM. The
sensitivity of the chemicals is plotted and compared, as shown in Fig. 7a, b. As
compared to DCM chemical showing maximum current responsivity and sensi-
tivity, the hexagonal ZnO NPys based electrode surfaces showed very less current
responsivity and sensitivity towards toluene, benzene, and chlorobenzene chemicals.

Results on analysis indicates excellent selectivity of the ZnO NPys electrode-based
sensor towards DCM chemical.
To test the consistency of the chemical sensor, six electrodes are produced using
the same fabrication process and are subjected to cyclic voltammetry (CV) measure-
ments using PBS electrolyte containing approximately 50 µM DCM. The Fig. 8a, b
shows that all six electrodes have similar responses to DCM, indicating good repro-
ducibility and consistency. For stability testing, CV measurements are taken up after
every 5 days for a period of 30 days, and cathodic peaks decreases to around 3–
5%, indicating high sensor stability. Therefore, the hexagonal ZnO NPys modiﬁed
disposable SPE sensor shows high reproducibility, repeatability, and stability for
DCM detection.

Iron-Nickel Doped Zno as FET Electrodes for Detection
of Harmful Hexahydropyridine Solvents
A variety of metal oxide semiconductors, including SnO2 [56–58], ZnO [59–61],
In2O3 [62–64], Fe2O3 [65, 66], Co3O4 [67, 68], TiO2 [69], and WO3 [70], are efﬁ-
ciently used as electrode materials in various applications including electrical and
optoelectronics like in sensors, transistors, solar cells, etc. ZnO exhibits remarkable
chemical and physical properties, and hence being extensively used in sensor appli-
cations [71] as an excellent electrode material. Several shapes and dimensions of
ZnO confers it to be used as one of the ﬁnest sensing electrode material used for
detecting a range of toxic substances.
In spite of metal oxides-based chemical sensors being promising, they register
certain demerits like corrosivity and non-detection of very low concentrations of
dangerous chemicals and hence the surface of metal oxides can be modiﬁed so as to
seek their usage as electrode material. The sensing performance of metal oxide-based
chemical sensors can be enlarged by proper integration of various metal impurities
or by doping various metal oxides. The use of metals like Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt or
some transition metals like Mn, Al, Cr, Cu, Ni, Fe, and Co [72–74] can modify the
surfaces of metal oxide semiconductors that has largely inﬂuenced various properties
including electrical, magnetic, and optical responsible for increased sensing applica-
tions [75, 76]. In addition to above, ZnO nanostructures can be doped by a transition
metal like nickel (Ni), for increasing the sensing response with shorter response or
recovery time [77]. When the ZnO nanostructures are doped with Ni, similarity in the
ionic radii of Ni2+ (0.69) and Zn2+ (0.74), leads to the possibility of replacing Zn2+
with Ni2+ in the ZnO lattice. This replacement or substitution ampliﬁes donor defects,
simpliﬁes charge separation, and improves transport characteristics [78]. As a result
of doping of metal oxides with Iron (Fe), formation of Fe2+ and Fe3+ as valence states
takes place modifying the band gap along with the electrical characteristics [79, 80].

FESEM analysis is used to characterize the morphology of the synthesized Ni, Fe-
doped ZnO NPs, as illustrated in Fig. 9. At low magniﬁcation, the extremely uniform
spherical shape particles are visible (Fig. 9a, b). The high magniﬁcation image in
Fig. 9c of the generated Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs reveals that the as-grown material
comprises spherical and hexagonal NPs. The Ni, Fe-doped ZnO nanoparticles can
have an average size between 40 and 60 nm.
The optical properties of the synthesized Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs are analyzed
by UV-vis spectroscopy, as shown in Fig. 10a, b. Compared to pure ZnO [82], the
UV-vis absorption at 364 nm for the as -grown Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs exhibits a
slight shift which could be due to the combined doping effects of both Fe–Ni in
ZnO NPs. The absorption band at 364 nm in bulk ZnO conﬁrms its hexagonal shape
wurtzite structure [83]. The larger absorption band in Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs may
potentially be attributable to the substitution of Zn2+ with Fe2+ and Ni2+ in the ZnO
lattice [84]. As compared to bulk ZnO having band gap 3.37 eV, Ni, Fe-doped ZnO
nanoparticles have a band gap value ~3.4 eV which is slightly more. The optical
behavior of Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs was studied using the photoluminescence (PL)
spectroscopy showing precisely emission at 430 nm and a broader green emission
at 575 nm. These emissions corresponding to the near-band edge (NBE) emissions
originate by recombining free excitons of ZnO [85] with the oxygen vacancies (VO+)
[86] that are singly ionized.

The UV-absorption results also support the exchange of Zn2+ ions with Fe2+ and
Ni2+. The suppressed green emission band and lower intensity of UV-emission in case
of Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs however arises because of the absentia of large number of
defect transitions in the band gap and greater increase in defects like Zn interstitials,
impeding the exciton emission of Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs [87] respectively.
Figure 11a depicts the fabricated Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor,
connected with two Ag electrodes. Figure 11b represents a plot between drain current
(Id) versus gate voltage (V g) for as—grown Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-
sensor in 10 ml of 0.1 M PBS with and without 100 nM hexahydropyridine chemical
and a gate voltage range of 0–2 V. In the absence of hexahydropyridine chemical,
a feeble current is recorded by this FET sensor. In contrast to this however, adding
about 100 nM hexahydropyridine chemical in PBS solution causes a sharp growth
of current, demonstrating a strong response to hexahydropyridine chemical by Ni,
Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor. This could be explained on the basis of
good hexahydropyridine chemical adsorption on the surface of the synthesized Ni,
Fe-doped ZnO NPs.
The sensing behavior can be investigated for as-grown Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs
modiﬁed FET-sensor by carrying out multiple tests consisting of an extensive range
of hexahydropyridine from 100 nM to1 mM in 10 ml PBS solution (0.1 M, pH = 7),
as shown in Fig. 12a. A linearity in the current is observed as the concentration of
hexahydropyridine from grows from 100 nM to 1 mM in 10 ml PBS. This gradual
increase in the current enhances the ionic strength of the solution as the electrode
surface registers large ion formation on it. With a positive gate voltage, number of
conducting electrons increases in the channel due to which channel conductivity
increases and so the drain current (Id) [88]. The sensing parameters of the Ni, Fe-
doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor can be easily calculated from the calibration
plot using a gate voltage of 2.0 V. With increase in the concentration of hexahy-
dropyridine, there is a linear response in the Id–V g response as shown in Fig. 12b.
The current response ﬁrst increases up to a concentration of 50 μM and then linearly
increases till the concentration is maximum i.e. 1 mM due to the large ion formation

on the surface of the Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor [89]. The sensi-
tivity of a FET-sensor can be calculated from the plot of the linear region. Sensitivity
as high as 62.28 μA μM−1 cm−2 could be obtained for Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs modi-
ﬁed FET-sensor in the dynamic response range of 100 nM–50 M. A Ni, Fe-doped
ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor can witness a good detection limit of 79 μM, with
a shorter response time (10 s, as depicted in the inset of Fig. 12b). The sensing
performance(10.37 × 10–2 μA μM−1 cm−2) is high for such type of sensor when
compared to undoped ZnO NPs. Using pyrrole, tetrahydrofuran, and pyrrolidine
chemicals, the sensing responses of a Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor
can be represented as shown in Fig. 12c. The sensitivities for tetrahydrofuran, pyrrole
and pyrrolidine chemicals are 8.77, 11.67, 3.23 μA μM−1 cm−2 respectively. This
indicates that Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor exhibits an appreciable
sensing response towards the hexahydropyridine chemical. This is due to combined
doping of both Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs and good optical, electronic and effective
adsorptive properties towards hexahydropyridine chemical. The stability of Ni, Fe-
doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor can be veriﬁed from its Id–V g characteristics
measured two times in a day for around four weeks. While detecting hexahydropy-
ridine, there is no noticeable drop in Id–V g cha characteristics as shown in Fig. 12d,
thereby conﬁrming good stability of the fabricated sensor.
Hexahydropyridine and the other inhibiting species have ﬁxed concentrations,
pyrrolidine (C4H9N, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), pyrrole (C4H5N, 98%, Alfa Aesar) and
tetrahydrofuran (C4H8O, 99.8%, Alfa Aesar), in PBS decides the selectivity of Ni,
Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor as determined by measuring the Id response
to V g in PBS. For the test, 50 μM hexahydropyridine is diluted ﬁrst with 10 ml of PBS
comprising various inhibiting species like pyrrolidine, pyrrole and tetrahydrofuran
followed by checking and measuring the proper Id–V g responses.
A relatively high current response is obtained as seen from Id–V g studies shown
in Fig. 13a, b, using hexahydropyridine chemical in PBS but a marginally reduced

current response for PBS containing hexahydropyridine/pyrrolidine and hexahy-
dropyridine/pyrrole/tetrahydrofuran. Due to some of the interfering species, the
current decreases and hence Ni, Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor being
extraordinarily sensitive to the hexahydropyridine chemical. The measurements
conducted are not affected even if the interfering species are taken into consideration.
In addition to determining the practical and analytical dependability of the Ni,
Fe-doped ZnO NPs modiﬁed FET-sensor, various samples including mineral, DI, and
tap water are chosen so as to synthesise 0.1 M hexahydropyridine buffer solutions
with them. Id–V g measurements as shown in Fig. 14a, b indicates the best recovery
of 24.8% using DI water and 22.6% and 22.4% for mineral and tap water respec-
tively. This drop in the latter samples is accounted due to the intrusion of numerous
contaminants or foreign elements thereby showing high stability and selectivity of
our FET-sensor in detecting hexahydropyridine in real water samples too.

The magnetic properties of ZnO doped with transition metals can be tailored,
resulting in the understanding a new class of material and device. According to
the literature, such doped nanomaterials of ZnO as ZnFe2O4 are promising candi-
dates due to their low resistance, fascinating optical and electrochemical properties

due to high surface-area and have encouraged researchers to develop electrochem-
ical sensors. Formaldehyde detection is critical for human life protection because it
has been found as one of the lung cancer markers that can be detected from exhaled
human breath [2, 5, 90–92]. As a result, both air quality and healthcare applications
require formaldehyde detection systems to be extremely selective to levels as low as
100 ppb or lower [93]. Rahman et al. used I–V chemical detecting of formaldehyde
over silver electrodes with a thin ﬁlm of ZnFe2O4 nanorods. A linear response over
a wide range, sensitivity of 4.10 μA μM−1 cm−2, and detection limit of 0.0089 μM
[94] is reported. Another study was using ZnFe2O4–ZnO composites in the form
of hollow microspheres having diameters in the range of 1–2.5 μM and numerous
small cubic ZnFe2O4 nanoparticles to create a gas sensor for widespread volatile
organic contaminants such as ethanol, n-butanol, methanol, and acetone as probe
gases. Sensor based on such composite hollow microspheres has better reversibility,
faster response, reproducibility, and recovery characteristics than a pure ZnO sensor
[26]. It is revealed that more research on ZnFe2O4-based sensors in the form of an
electrochemical device resulting in a quick and selective sensing element is required.
The surface morphology and as grown spinel size can be determined using
FESEM. The microstructures in Fig. 15 show that the particles have a distorted
spherical shape that forms a lump-like structure, which is predicted to aid in sensing
as the analyst adsorption increases. High to low magniﬁcation images are shown in
Fig. 15a–c. The image obtained using HR-TEM and selected area diffraction pattern
(SAED) shown in Fig. 15d–e, conﬁrms the ZnFe2O4 heterostructures with a lattice
distance of 0.413 nm. The SAED pattern (Fig. 15e) shows ﬁve distinct rings, which
correspond to the planes (104), (222), (400), (422), and (440) of polycrystalline
ZnFe2O4.
The FTIR spectrum (Fig. 16a) demonstrates a prominent band at 570 cm−1, indi-
cating Fe–O/Zn–O bonding, corresponding to a metal–oxygen bond region. The
bands seen at 1633 cm−1 and 3452 cm−1 are associated with O–H vibration and
stretching mode, respectively [96]. The diffraction pattern obtained using Rigaku’s
X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with CuKa, = 1.54178 Å radiation conﬁrmed the phase
and crystallinity of the synthesized material, and the pattern is shown in Fig. 16b.
According to the diffraction analysis, the synthesized powder contains a mixed phase
of ZnFe2O4 and Fe2O3. A large number of peaks (JCPDS #322-1012) are indexed
to ZnFe2O4, while three peaks (JCPDS #39-1346) are indexed to Fe2O3. The crys-
tallinity of the synthesized material was discovered to be low, making it a suitable
material for adsorption-based sensors. The observations are similar to FESEM obser-
vations in that lump-like structures are observed. Figure 16c depicts the UV-Vis
absorbance spectra of the synthesized material, with the absorption peak located at
311 nm. According to this spectrum, the optical band gap value is 3.98 eV. Figure 16d
depicts the photoluminescence spectrum obtained at room temperature, with absorp-
tion peaks appearing at 397 and 683 nm, which are attributed to the characteristic
peak of ZnO and Fe2O3, a mixed phase material, as observed from XRD studies.
The ground states of the synthesized material are also investigated using a wide
scan X-ray photoelectron spectrum (Fig. 17a), which shows the Zn 2p, Fe 2p, and
O 1s binding energy peaks with a weak C 1s binding energy peak. The narrow

scan Zn 2p XPS spectrum (Fig. 17b) indicates binding energy for two peaks at
1022.8 eV and 1045.8 eV, corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 and Zn 2p1/2. Figure 17c depicts
the Fe 2p narrow scan spectrum, with peaks at 711.56 eV, 724.37 eV, and 726.58 eV
corresponding to Fe 2p1/2, satellite peak of Fe3+, and Fe 2p1/2, respectively. Moreover,
the narrow scan spectra for the O 1s peak (Fig. 17d) show a broad asymmetric peak
with three binding energies of 532.6 eV, 531.3 eV, and 530.1 eV. Figure 17b, c show
the de-convoluted peaks obtained by data ﬁtting data from the Zn, Fe, and O regions,
respectively. The peaks at 1044.98 and 1022.05 eV in the Zn 2p spectrum (Fig. 17b)
are correlated to Zn 2p1/2 and Zn 2p3/2, respectively, due to the presence of the Zn2+
state of Zn element in ZnFe2O4. The ﬁtting of Fe peaks (Fig. 17c) reveals sub-peaks
at 712.87 and 710.77 eV belonging to Fe 2p3/2, most likely due to tetrahedral and
octahedral sites. Additionally, peaks at 724.97 and 718.72 eV indicate Fe3+ oxidation
states for Fe 2p1/2 deconvolution. With O 1s peak, Fig. 17d, the peak associated to
lattice oxygen in the Zn–O or Fe–O structure is assigned at 529.47 eV, while the peak
related to surface adsorbed oxygen is assigned at 530.14 eV. Also, it is evident that
a defect in the nanostructure low oxygen coordination resulted in a de-convoluted
peak at 532.48 eV.
Figure 18a depicts a typical I–V curve as a function of source voltage with and
without graphene on ZnFe2O4 heterostructures at a ﬁxed formaldehyde concentration
(12.5 μM). The graphene spray over the ﬁlm makes it more conductive for charges,
resulting in a boost in current. The sensing capabilities of ZnFe2O4 heterostructures
with graphene-coated ﬁlms are studied. Current variation as a function of voltage and
formaldehyde concentration (12.5, 50, 100, and 200 μM) is displayed in Fig. 18b. It is

shown that ﬂuctuations in current are minimal until I–V, when the voltage grows from
1 to 1.5 V. Hydrolysis of the formaldehyde/PBS is expected to occur at a slightly
higher voltage, resulting in an increase in current. To determine the sensitivity of
the modiﬁed electrode, a current value at 1.5 V was selected from the I–V curves
(Fig. 18b) and plotted against the formaldehyde concentration. Figure 18c exhibits
the resultant curve, which serves as the calibration curve. It is revealed that the
concentration response is linear (0.99 regression constant), which is required for the
creation of such a sensor. The sensitivity was then estimated by approximating the
slope, which was found to be an acceptable ~1.36 μA/Mcm2. The detection limit
computed using the slope is 14.7 μM. Due to the synergistic impact of ZnFe2O4
heterostructures and graphene oxide, ZnFe2O4 heterostructures are a viable probe
candidate for the detection of hazardous compounds.

Synthesized 3-Dementional ZnGa2O4 as Transition
Binary Metal Oxide for Highly Sensitive Semiconductor
Electrodes to Detect N,N-Dimethylmethanamide
Chemical
Zinc gallate (ZnGa2O4) with a cubic spinel (AB2O4) structure, is a binary compound
oxide and the most attractive electrode material [97]. ZnGa2O4 is composed primarily
of tetrahedrally organized Zn and octahedrally organized Ga with O atoms [98,
99]. Fundamental research on the application of ZnGa2O4 as an electrode mate-
rial for supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, vacuum ﬂuorescent displays, liquid
crystal displays (LCDs), ﬁeld emission displays (FED), solar cells and photocata-
lysts is reported [100, 101]. ZnGa2O4 semiconductors with 4.4 eV band gaps exhibit
improved thermal stability, chemical stability with enhanced capacity and theoretical
conductivity [102, 103]. Synthesis of ZnGa2O4 structures can be accomplished using
conventional solid-state reactions [104, 105], hydrothermal methods [106], sol-gel
[107], chemical vapor deposition (CVD) [108], pulsed laser deposition [109], and
so on. ZnGa2O4 stands as a promising material because of its secondary engineering
[110–112]. These materials show a larger variation in morphologies viz assembling
three dimensional nanostructures from either 0D, 1D or 2D building blocks. There is
always room for developing 3D ZnGa2O4 structures for application in sensor appli-
cations. The electrode and electrolyte interaction can be improved using 3D structure
of ZnGa2O4 which builds the mechanical stability too. The use of 3D structures in
electrochemical systems [113–117] lowers down the diffusion length of electrons
as well as ions both. The electrochemical performance is strongly affected by the
electrode materials having strong mechanical properties along with the active surface
sites. It is well understood that the 3D structures could well prevent material structure
losses during electrochemical testing, thereby improving electrochemical capability
[118, 119].
The surface shape and size of as grown ZnGa2O4 microstructures are studied
using FESEM and TEM analyses. After 16 h of reaction, the sample takes on a shape
resembling nanosheets (Fig. 19a). Figure 19b represents self-assembly of gener-
ated nanosheets to peony-like 3D morphology of ZnGa2O4 microstructures when
the reaction time increases to 24 h. As a result, the ﬁnal product phase and shape
growth is highly sensitive to the H2O/ethylenediamine volume ratio (2:1) [120]. Due
to its hydrolysis to −OH in solution, ethylenediamine functions as a Lewis base,
which could favor the production of nanosheets structure from the particles in a high
concentration of H2O. Figure 19c, d, refers to the magniﬁed images of ZnGa2O4
microstructures that are produced from the nanosheets having thickness range 20–
30 nm and are densely packed to form peony-like shapes. Peony-like morphology of
3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures are formed when these nanosheets get interconnected
to each other such that the porosity and surface area of ZnGa2O4 microstructures
[121, 122] is greatly affected.
Interestingly, the nanosheets are interconnected to form a peony-like morphology
of 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures, which could be essential for producing high surface

area and porous ZnGa2O4 microstructures [121, 122]. The mechanical strength and
ﬁssures created by this shape are critical for allowing rapid diffusion of electrolyte
ions [124].
The morphology of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures can be explored
using various techniques like SAED, TEM and HRTEM. Figure 20a shows consis-
tency of TEM image with the FESEM image, showing different sizes of spheres of
ZnGa2O4 ranging from 600 to 700 nm. The morphological analysis of peony-like
3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures can be carried out using HRTEM. The lattices with a
lattice fringe spacing of 0.28 nm indexed to the (3 1 1) facet of ZnGa2O4 is obtained
as shown in Fig. 20b, c. The bright diffraction spots as obtained in FFT (Fig. 20d)
conﬁrms the inter-planar distance between two adjacent fringes of ZnGa2O4 phase.
The chemical state of as-grown peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures can be
easily understood by carrying out XPS measurements as shown in Fig. 21. The survey
spectrum, in Fig. 21a, indicates Zn 2p, Ga 2p, and O 1s peaks conﬁrming the synthesis
of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures from Zn, Ga, and O species. The doublet
bindingenergiesforZn2p3/2 andZn2p1/2 comesouttobe1044.68eVand1021.59eV
respectively as they are related to Zn2+ oxidation state [125]. This is conﬁrmed using
high resolution Zn2p XPS of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures in Fig. 21b.
Figure 21c however, represents binding energy peaks of Ga 2p3/2 and Ga 2p1/2 at
1144.08 eV and 1117.08 eV, respectively making the measured values consistent to

those reported earlier [126]. The difference in their energies comes out to be 27.0 eV,
which is in close approximation to the value 26.84 eV as calculated for the Ga2+ state
[125] and likewise the spin orbit difference between Zn 2p3/2 and Ga 2p3/2 energy
states comes out to be 99.40 eV, validating the bond of O atoms [126] with Zn and
Ga atoms. Figure 21d shows the O 1s spectrum proving the presence of oxygen in
various chemical states. The binding energy of 530.27 eV veriﬁes the presence of
lattice oxygen, while the presence of hydroxyl oxygen is conﬁrmed by the peak at
531.38 eV. These ﬁndings are supported by FTIR and XRD analysis.
The optical properties of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures can be
explained using UV-vis and the photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopies. Figure 22a,
exhibits a sharp absorption peak of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures at
291 nm. The band gap (Eg) of as grown peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures
comes out to be ~4.25 eV which is in close agreement to the earlier measured Eg

value of ZnGa2O4 [127]. At 410 nm, there is presence of strong blue emission in
the PL spectrum results (Fig. 22b), due to transfer of charge at regular octahedral
symmetry and its O2−ligands [128] arising due to the self-activation at the Ga–O
octahedral group. However, at 580 nm, wide and a weaker green emission arises
in peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures as the electron valence band (VB) and
oxygen deﬁcit (VO) recombines. The results of PL emission on analysis veriﬁes that
these as-grown microstructures have a higher crystal quality [129].
According to morphological characterizations, the surfaces of 3D ZnGa2O4
microstructures resembling peony are porous. The N2 adsorption–desorption along
with the pore size distribution plots can be observed in Fig. 23. Surface analysis and
determination of the surface area of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures can
be very well understood using Brunauer Emmett Teller (BET) and Barrett Joyner
Halenda (BJH) methods. Due to extremely large relative pressure (P/Po) in the range
0–1, a typical IV isotherm is observed verifying the mesoporous structure [130]. The
computation of speciﬁc surface area of as grown microstructures comes out to be
62,3 m2 g−1. The Inset of Fig. 23 demonstrates the matching pore size distribution
with a very broad distribution of pore diameter ranging from 5 to 32 nm, signi-
fying distinctive mesoporous structure of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures.

The electrochemical characteristics of these microstructures can be enhanced greatly
with more number of electro-active sites and surface area.
Based on various consequences, the growth mechanism can be put forward for
peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures. In the ﬁrst step, metal ions (Zn2+) react
with OH anions so as to form the precursor nanoparticles. Due to the hydrol-
ysis of ethylenediamine, release of −OH anions take place slowly from the given
aqueous solution. Further, during the interaction with gallium nitrate, self-assembly
of nanoparticles leads to formation of solid spheres. The solid microspheres recrys-
tallizes and dissolution takes place outside leading to coarsening of their surfaces.
Also, the phase growth and morphology of ZnGa2O4 is decided by the H2O/
ethylenediamine volume ratio which comes out to be 2:1. H2O/ethylenediamine ratio
is inﬂuenced greatly by the hydrothermal treatment as well as high-water volume,
the nanosheets so formed acts as building blocks and spreads substantially large.

The hydrothermal treatment plays a crucial role in the dissolution-recrystallization
process till the microspheres are obtained.
The electrochemical behavior can be easily measured using potassium chloride
(KCl)-potassium ferricyanide K3 [Fe(CN)6] electrolyte taking latter 2 mM in 0.1 M
KCl for a peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures-based disposable screen printed
electrode (SPE). From Fig. 24a it can be seen these microstructures show a large
peak current at anode and cathode with an appropriate peak-to-peak separation.
Peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures-based SPE shows an efﬁcient electron
transfer and very superior electrochemical reversibility as seen from the CV plot.
Using N,N-dimethylmethanamide chemical along with peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4
microstructures based SPE in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7.0), their current–voltage (I–V)
response can be measured in the scan range of 0.0–3.0 V. When the chemical N,N-
dimethylmethanamide is added in PBS electrolyte as in Fig. 24b it shows a current of
~1.57 mA which is in contrast to blank PBS where a very feeble current is recorded.
The high current response indicates that the chemical N,N-dimethylmethanamide
exhibits a greater sensing response, and hence veriﬁes that peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4
microstructures show fast redox efﬁciency with good electro-catalytic oxidation
behavior [131, 132]. The electrochemical performance depends on the variable chem-
ical concentrations of N,N-dimethylmethanamide varying from 1 nM to 10 mM as
shown in Fig. 24c. By successively adding N,N-dimethylmethanamide chemical say
from 1 nm to 10 mM in PBS electrolyte, the current amplitude increases signiﬁcantly
for peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4/SPE as the electrolytic ionic strength increases consid-
erably. Thus, there is a strong correlation in between N,N-dimethylmethanamide
chemical concentration and the response of current due to analyte concentrations.
A calibration curve showing the calibrated current versus different concentration of
the chemical N,N-dimethylmethanamide in Fig. 24d depicts linear growth of current
with an increase in analyte concentration for extensive studies of sensing behavior.
With sensitivity as high as 154.2 mA mM−1 cm−2, LOD as low as 0.14 M, full LDR
of 1 nM–10 mM along with 0.6968 as a regression coefﬁcient (R2), Peony-like 3D
ZnGa2O4/SPE are outstanding. The measurement of the current in the on/off state,
as shown in Fig. 24e describes the dependence of a chemical sensor on peony-like
3D ZnGa2O4/SPE. Reliability and stability increases for peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4/
SPE under ‘on’ conditions due to the linear variation of current varies with time.
The differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) as shown in Fig. 25a can be used
to investigate the analytical capability of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures-
based SPE. Taking variable concentrations of N, N-dimethylmethanamide chemical
in a 10.0 ml of 0.1 M PBS buffer (pH = 7), a number of DPV plots are analysed
for peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures based SPE. The I–V results clearly
show the increase in the current with an increase in the concentration of N,N-
dimethylmethanamide. As seen from the calibration plot in Fig. 25b obtained from
DPV plots, up to 1 mM the relationship is linear and value for retention coefﬁcient
(R2) comes out to be 0.88564. By using linear ﬁtting method and using the formula
LOD = 3 standard deviation (SD)/slope (s), LOD comes out to be 0.13 μM. LOQ
(the limit of quantiﬁcation) is given as: = 10 SD/s, an approximate value out to
be 1.26 μM. The electrochemical behavior can be easily known by calculating the

reﬂecting good chemical sensing ability.
The sensing mechanism can be judged for peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstruc-
tures by knowing the reaction at their surfaces. As shown in Fig. 26, the sensing

mechanism involves ﬁrst the adsorption of oxygen species at the surface of peony-
like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures trapping the electrons available in the conduction
band of ZnGa2O4 that gives rise to formation of atomic O−(ads)/O2−(ads) or molec-
ular O2−(ads) oxygen ions on the surface of ZnGa2O4. In peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4
microstructures, when the electrons with relatively low energies are excited from
the valence band (VB), the fabricated sensor shows a decrease in the resistance due
to hole accumulation that forms a layer. When an analyte is exposed, the reaction
of adsorbed oxygen ions with chemical N,N-dimethylmethanamide takes place and
thus releases their captured electrons according to the following equations:
O2(g) + ↔O−

During an oxidation process [133], when the free electrons are released in the
conduction band of ZnGa2O4 due to the presence of analyte species, an increase
is registered in both the electrical conductivity and current. The morphology of
peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures is unique consisting of several porous
nanosheets with enormous active sites for the chemical accessibility of N,N-
dimethylmethanamide, resulting in a good sensing response. The unique features viz.
excessively large porosity and pore volume of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstruc-
tures makes N,N-dimethylmethanamide move around easily on the surface acceler-
ating the electrocatalytic activity and shortening the path of the ions when they move
around. For proper understanding of the electrochemical sensors which often show
a recovery time of 10 s, there is a need to understand the above explained processes.
Due to improvisation in sensitivity and LOD, charge extraction also improves over
peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures/SPE.
A highly stable and sensitive chemical sensor depends purely on the stability of
peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4/SPE. The I–V responses are investigated for the stability and
reliability of the chemical 10 M N,N-dimethylmethanamide in PBS (pH = 7). The
experiment involved preparation of ﬁve peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4/SPE for measure-
ments under similar conditions. For all the ﬁve electrodes, Fig. 27a, b shows the I–V
responses which are quite similar in terms of relative standard deviation. This ensures
the stability of electrodes with only minute changes in successive I–V measurements.
Under same electrochemical condition, there is no degradation in the electrode. The
outstanding reproducibility of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4/SPE is due to its exceptional
morphology and large surface area. Another parameter foe measuring stability is by
taking all the fabricated ﬁve electrodes at room temperature for around six weeks

and carrying out measurements involving sensing. Figure 27c shows the histogram
of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4/SPE depicting current retention up to 94% as compared
to the current measured for N,N-dimethylmethanamide sensing on the ﬁrst day.
The stability in the structure of peony-like 3D ZnGa2O4 microstructures, as well as
an efﬁcient interaction between the active material and N,N-dimethylmethanamide
chemical, can contribute to their long-term stability. In order to realize the reliability
and preciseness of the electrochemical method for the real world applications, stan-
dard recovery method was adopted with DI, tap water and mineral water samples
as shown in Fig. 27d. I–V characteristics were measured by taking various concen-
trations of the chemical N,N-dimethylmethanamide after the samples were spiked.
Toxic chemicals can be detected very easily in real water samples as known N,N-
dimethylmethanamide concentrations gives satisfactory recoveries, thereby proving
the efﬁciency of the proposed sensing electrode.

NiCo2O4 Hexa-Nanoplates as Transition Binary Metal
Oxide-Based Sensor for 3-Methoxypropionitrile Tracking
Many oxidation state oxides like transition binary metal oxides particularly cobalt
based spinel oxides, i.e. MCo2O4 (M = Cu, Ni, Mg, Zn, Cd, Mn, etc.) [134–139]
exhibit unique characteristics including less toxicity, cost efﬁciency, easy manufac-
turing, outstanding durability in alkaline electrolytes etc. There is an extensive usage
of these transition binary metal oxides in various energy storage technologies viz.
Li-ion batteries, chemical sensors, and other devices based on energy conversion in
past years [140]. The combined effects of both Ni and Co considerably improves the
chemical composition of the so formed mixed-valence oxides of cobalt (Co) included
nickel (Ni), as the most efﬁcient and demanding binary oxides so found [141–144].
The electrochemical performances of nanostructured nickel–cobalt oxides are often
dependent on an extensively bigger surface area and larger porosity [145–150].
The various oxidation states of the Ni and Co atoms contribute to a binary effect
that is effective to the electrochemical behavior and redox reaction. In addition to
this, in binary nickel cobalt oxides, the substitution of cobalt atoms (with a smaller
radius) with nickel atoms (with a larger radius) increases the electron accommoda-
tion in 3d orbit, resulting in different crystal shapes [151, 152]. Recently NiCo2O4
nanomaterials have drawn a lot of attention towards their use in electrochemical elec-
trodes in a number of electrochemical devices like sensors, biosensors, etc. [153–155]
due to their structures and morphologies, their excellent electronic conductivity, low
cost processability and primarily being bio-degradable. A high electronic conduc-
tivity of NiCo2O4 due to existence of a large number of oxidation states affects both
electrochemical reactions and their performances [156]. The as-discussed exclusive
properties makes NiCo2O4 as a suitable electrochemical material but with certain
anomalies viz. low surface area, intrinsic poor electronic conductivity [157] and
pore volume. These drawbacks can be easily overcome by choosing materials based
either on 2D or they have sheet-like morphology having short pathways with a large
surface area and pore volume, and very fast reaction kinetics for the redox process
[158–160]. Keeping in view of the above deﬁned properties, NiCo2O4 can serve as
a great electrode material with either 2D or sheets morphology and can be exclu-
sively used in chemical sensors. Electrode components play a signiﬁcant role in
electrochemical devices [161–163] due to their exclusive electrocatalytic proper-
ties. Binary metal oxides [164] with large electrical conductivity along with good
electrochemical capabilities [163, 165] makes them more suitable if compared to
transition metal oxides. Their use can thus be proved as a cost-effective way so as to
get high-performance electrochemical devices [166, 167].
The as-grown NiCo2O4 materials were investigated for the morphological prop-
erties using FESEMs. Figure 28a, b shows FESEM images with low magniﬁcation
with distinct structure of a hexagonal nanoplates having high aspect ratio. Figure 28c
however shows a high magniﬁcation image conﬁrming the average size of as-grown
NiCo2O4 stacked structures to be 200–300 nm. As shown in Fig. 28d, the as-grown
NiCo2O4 comprises numerous porous nanosheets approximately with a thickness of

around 20–30 nm. With a large active area, as- grown binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs
can be useful in charge storage and transfer which can alter the electrolyte pathways
contributing to high-rate capability.
The XRD pattern of binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs is shown in Fig. 29a.
There is consistency in between the characteristic peaks at 18.7°(111), 31.2°(220),
36.7°(311), 44.1°(400), 54.9°(422), 59.04°(511), 64.7°(440), and 76.8°(533) and
between (JCPDF card no: 20-0781), corresponding to the FCC (face-centered cubic)
lattice with Fd3m space group [169]. Due to lesser degree of crystallinity, the ﬁltration
of ions in the electrolyte and diminishing diffusion distance [170] (assumptions), can
be considered well. The XRD peaks with all NiCo2O4 phases indicate that the binary
oxides can be easily produced with cobalt nitrate and nickel nitrate. The crystallite
size (D) of as-grown materials can be calculated using the Scherrer equation as:
D = Kλ(β cos θ)
where D tells us about the size of the crystallite in nm; K the shape factor of
crystallite (0.9), λ the X-ray wavelength, β about the full width at half the maximum
(FWHM) in radians of the XRD peak and θ the Braggs’ angle (in degree). Using
Scherer equation, the crystallite size approximately comes out to be 21.2 nm for
binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs. The spectrum obtained contains no other peaks

HNPs. shows The FTIR spectra of binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs is shown in
Fig. 29b. The signal at 3426 cm−1, suggests the OH group. At 665 and 567 cm−1,
there lies two infrared bands, the former representing metal–oxygen stretching from
tetrahedral sites and the latter for octahedral sites and conﬁrms the existence of Ni–O
and Co–O in NiCo2O4 [183].
The optical observations as acquired by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy measure-
ments is shown in Fig. 30 for binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs. Figure 30, shows a
very strong absorption peak near 400 nm in as-grown binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs
resulting in an electronic transition by the tetrahedral high spin Co2+(Eg4T2g3) and
octahedral low spin Co3+(t2g6) and Ni3+(t2g6eg1).For the valence band, these band
structure can be related to O 2p orbital and in the conduction bands [171], to Ni 3d
and Co 3d orbitals. Using the onset wavelength in Fig. 32 which shows consistency
with the past works [172], the band gap (Eg) calculated is 2.31 eV for binary NiCo2O4
stacked HNPs.
Various surface properties that affect the electrochemical performances can be
easily calculated for as-grown binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs viz. pore volume,
pore size and speciﬁc surface to volume ratio. From Fig. 31a, binary NiCo2O4
stacked HNPs show N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms with speciﬁc surface area
78.8 m2g−1 and pore volume as large as 18.1 cm (STP) g−1. Binary NiCo2O4
stacked HNPs exhibiting mesoporous nature can be veriﬁed from the distribution
of pore size (Fig. 31b) ranging from ~15 to 30 nm. As per the XRD measurements,
using the above discussed results, large speciﬁc area corresponds to a small crystal
size which enhances the exposure of active sites and speeds up further the transit
of an electrolyte. Consequently, NiCo2O4 HNPs layered in a binary conﬁguration
promote effective energy storage and distribution. A disposable SPE coated with
binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs show remarkable electrochemical sensing properties
including limit of detection, sensitivity, linear dynamic and correlation coefﬁcient
for 3-MPN chemical sensor application. By altering the concentrations of 3-MPN

chemical and taking 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS, pH = 7.0) as a test
electrolyte, I–V characteristics can be known for the sensing measurements.
From Fig. 32a, no characteristic peak is shown by pristine PBS (blank) in the
given voltage range. Also, when 3-MPN chemical (10 μM) is added to the solution
containing electrolyte current increases considerably showing excellent electrocat-
alytic ability of binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs modiﬁed electrode in terms of chem-
ical sensing of 3-MPN. Figure 32b infers a linear current ranging from 10 to 100 μM
for 3-MPN concentrations and increased current intensity for about 50 times the
concentration of 3-MPN in the electrolyte with the minimum concentration. Expla-
nation to this lies on the fact that there is an increase in the ionic strength when
3-MPN chemical is added which shows fast transfer of electrons [173] exhibiting
excellent electronic characteristics. During transfer of charge in binary NiCo2O4
stacked HNPs, the Co3+/Co2+ and Ni3+/Ni2+ are conductive. In the process, ﬁrst
through the electrolyte oxidization of Ni2+ takes place, the oxidized Ni3+ species

then becomes potential centers for OH adsorption. The interaction of this adsorbed
OH and 3-MPN chemical produces N2 and H2O [174]. Also, the dual combination
of Ni and Co atoms provides a remarkable catalytic surface for the 3-MPN chem-
ical. Tocalculatethesensingcharacteristics of thefabricated3-MPNchemical sensor,
Fig. 32c depicts a plot of calibrated current versus 3-MPN concentration. When there
is increase in 3-MPN concentration from 10 to 100 μM, current linearly increases
due to larger active sites on the modiﬁed binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs electrode as
larger adsorption of 3-MPN takes place at the maximum concentration of 100 μM. By
dividing the slope value with the electrode’s active surface area, sensitivity of binary
NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs. With sensitivity ~605 μA μM−1 cm−2, limit of detection
(LOD) ~11.8 μM, an outstanding limit detection range (LDR) varying from 10 to
100 μM, and a regression coefﬁcient (R) of ~0.99502 are obtained. Hence, there is
a strong correlation between high sensitivity and large surface area that can result
into analyte adsorption on the surface of electrode [175]. The stability of a binary
NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs-based electrode can be judged after studying the sensing
performance while detecting the chemical 3-MPN over a time span of one-month

period by knowing the I–V characteristics at 5–10 day intervals. Figure 32d, infers
that as the number of days increases, electrochemical sensor sensitivity of binary
NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs drops down slightly showing their increased stability and
durability with respect to the 3-MPN chemical. These stability outcomes suggest
the long lasting adsorptive and electrocatalytic capabilities of the binary NiCo2O4
stacked HNPs based electrode for the detection of 3-MPN chemical.
The sensing mechanism of a binary NiCo2O4 HNPs electrode [176, 177] can
be well understood by understanding adsorption and desorption of oxygen species
over binary NiCo2O4 HNPs electrode. The reaction takes place through an analyte
(3-MPN) which increases the electrode resistance. Figure 33 depicts the 3-MPN
chemical sensing behavior on the surface of a binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs elec-
trode. By determining the number of oxygenated species along with defect density
which is needed to support the oxygen adsorption, the chemical sensitivity of 3-MPN
can be understood clearly. According to Fig. 33, adsorption of molecular oxygen ﬁrst
takes place on the electrode surface for binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs producing
numerous active oxygenated ions that are needed in the oxidation of 3-MPN chem-
ical. These active oxygenated ions on the binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs interact
with the 3-MPN chemical and oxidize into carbon dioxide (CO2), ammonia (NH3),
and water (H2O) in various electrochemical experiments. The sensitivity of 3-MPN
chemical depends entirely on the production of oxygenated ions active enough by a
binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs electrode. This results in faster oxidation of 3-MPN
along with the high oxidizing ability causing annihilation of free electrons into the
NiCo2O4 conduction band.

Figure 34a represents the stability of binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs electrode
using 3-MPN chemical in PBS electrolyte. The Figure shows, increasing the I–V
testing by 10–40 times results in almost identical or marginally decreased current
responses for the binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs electrode, indicating a large elec-
trode stability. By analyzing the current response with respect to the applied voltage,
the selectivity study can be primarily conducted as shown in Fig. 34b. I–V responses
were analyzed by taking 20 μM of 3-MPN, 20 μM concentrations of various species
including resorcinol and dimethylformamide in 10 ml PBS electrolyte. Figure 34b
confers the presence of different interfering species in the same electrolyte as the
3-MPN chemical, but out of all, the 3-MPN chemical shows a very strong current
response. According to Fig. 34c, maximum sensitivity ~100% is shown by 3-MPN
chemical followed by resorcinol exhibiting ~75% sensitivity and DMF with least of
~63% sensing sensitivity. By fabricating six electrodes with binary NiCo2O4 stacked
HNPs-based electrodes their current responses can be easily tested to 3-MPN chem-
ical detection showing large stability and repeatability. Consequently, the developed
3-MPN chemical sensor using binary NiCo2O4 stacked HNPs electrode exhibits
higher sensitivity, reproducibility and stability for the detection of 3-MPN chemical.

Heavy metal ions in water are extremely harmful to both people and the environment.
As a result of rapid urbanization and widespread manufacturing, there is an increased
amount of toxic metal ions in the water supply [178–182]. These metal ions are highly
poisonous, non-ecofriendly, bio-magnifying, and can constitute hazard to the health
of humans, plants, and animals as they may enter living organisms readily through
the food chain [183–188]. For instance, even minute amounts of Cu2+ and Fe3+ ions
released into the environment can disrupt human cells ability to function normally
and their metabolism. However, the release of such large amounts can cause liver and
kidney damage, in their acute form, can lead to conditions like Parkinson disease,
anemia, and Alzheimer [189, 190]. There should be no more than 0.003 mg/L of
Cd, 0.01 mg/L of Pb, 0.05 mg/L of Cu, and 0.05 mg/L of Cr in human consumption
water, as stated by the World Health Organization (WHO).
Zinc oxide (ZnO) materials show their widespread use in photovoltaics, Field
EmissionTransistors,varioussensors,lasersandphotodiodesduetotheiroutstanding
electrical conduction, photoelectric properties, optical transparency, and piezoelec-
tricity [191–194]. The electrical conduction and efﬁcient charge transfer capabilities
of a carbon material nanocomposite like GO, rGO, CNTS and MWNTs are signiﬁ-
cantly improved [195–197]. In particular, nanocomposites based on GO or rGO show
promise as a means of improving sensing properties [198–201].
FESEM images as shown in Fig. 35 represents the surface analysis of nanocom-
posites of ZnO-(nanoglobules)NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO. The ZnO NGs are
dispersed across the GO surfaces when the magniﬁcation is low (Fig. 35a). Here,
ZnO NGs are made up of aggregated nanoparticles that are on the order of 150–
200 nm in size. Figure 35b shows a distribution of ZnO NGs on the surface of rGO
that is comparable to that explained above. High-magniﬁcation FESEM images of
ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocomposites shows distinctive hollow ZnO
NGs attached to the surfaces of GO and rGO (Fig. 35c, d). In addition, ZnO NGs
are spread over GO/rGO and introduced in between the layer spaces to generate
one-of-a-kind nanocomposite called ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO. In this
case, there is no indication of free GO/rGO sheets and the GO/rGO in the nanocom-
posite demonstrates strong attraction to ZnO-NGs. The element determination of the
nanocomposites using the EDS analysis is shown in Fig. 35e, f. Zn, O, and C element
peaks in the EDS proﬁle plots unequivocally verify the production of ZnO-NGs@GO
and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocomposites.

The Raman spectra in Fig. 36a displays ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO
nanocomposites. It shows that the nanocomposites exhibit peaks in the Raman spec-
trum that are characteristic of both GO and ZnO. The peak formed at 468 cm−1,
signiﬁes Raman mode known as E2 mode for wurtzite ZnO [203, 204]. The peaks
observed at 324 and 1108 cm−1 [205, 206] suggests the presence of second-order
multiple phonon modes in ZnO. D and G band at 1346 cm−1 and 1584 cm−1 respec-
tively indicates the Raman peaks that can be observed in nanocomposites; the E2g
phonon of sp2 carbon atoms [45, 207] causes ﬁrst order scattering giving rise to G
band. Furthermore, ZnO-NGs@GO has a higher intensity-to-dispersion ratio (ID/
IG) of ~0.99 compared to ZnONGs@rGO ~0.93. The larger ID/IG ratio infers larger
disorderness in carbon materials, and is thus the ratio often employed as a tool to
quantify the degree of disorder and defects in a wide variety of carbon materials [208,
209]. The results indicate that ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocomposites
is successfully synthesized. FTIR spectroscopy can conﬁrm the structural behavior of
ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocomposites. Figure 36b displays the FTIR
spectra of ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocomposites. The C=O double
bond stretching vibration, which peaks at roughly 1725 cm−1 [210]. C–C double
bond and C-O vibrational bands account for the 1569 cm−1 and 1223 cm−1 peaks,
respectively [211], but the 548 cm−1 peak is ascribed to ZnO [212]. ZnO vibrational
peak appeared at 548 cm−1 in both ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocom-
posites. Since quite a signiﬁcant amount of ZnO shields the low rGO/GO content,
reduced intensities of other peaks (1569 and 1223 cm−1) can be observed. From the
FTIR spectra, ZnO and GO/rGO moieties interact if both of their peaks are present.
Further investigations on the electrochemical relationships between ZnO and GO/
rGO on the surface of electrode, can be understood using EIS integration. The inset
as shown in Fig. 37a, corresponds to the circuit in which the semicircle shows the
charge transfer resistance (RCT) at the graph [213] in high frequency region and low
frequency region [214] by the tail. Despite the fact that well-deﬁned semicircles are

displayed on a conventional EIS plot, some other semicircles are distorted and expan-
sive. In comparison to ZnO/GO electrode, ZnO-NGs/rGOs electrode show consid-
erably greater electron transfer capacity owing to a smaller diameter semi-circle
showingreducedchargetransfer resistance. This reducedchargetransfer resistancein
turn enhances the heterogeneous electron transfer process when rGO is added to ZnO
showing symbiotic coupling effect between the two. The electrical conductivity of
ZnO-NGs@rGO is measured with a two-probe resistivity measurement equipment to
verify its continued good electrical characteristics. From Fig. 37b, the conductivity of
pure FTO is very small, coming in at only ~2.48 mS/cm. ZnO-NGs@rGO (4.36 mS/
cm) and ZnO-NGs@GO (3.96 mS/cm) exhibit enhanced conductivities, indicating
the nanocomposites were deposited over an FTO substrate. The as-grown nanocom-
posites shows the electrical conductivity values which are in close agreement to
those reported earlier for GO nanocomposites with ZnO [215]. Figure 37c also
shows the results of analyzing the surface hydrophobicity of ZnO-NGs@GO and
ZnO-NGs@rGO by calculating contact angle for water. In the nanocomposite, GO
contributes to a contact angle of ~13.89° and ZnO NGs@rGO to ~25.61° indicating
greater dispersion of nanocomposite ZnO nanocrystals throughout rGO, increasing
eventually the surface hydrophobicity.
The use of ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensors can
help in determining 6 different target metal ions, and sensor measurements can be
further carried out with an electrolyte with mixed-ions of Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Bi3+,
and Cr3+ ions. As indicated in Fig. 38a, b the presence of Cr3+ ions can be easily
detected by ZnO-NGs@GO modiﬁed MI-FETs inspite of availability of numerous
other metal ions. These modiﬁed MI-FETs outstands the presence of Cu2+ions with
RSD of ~2.6% for Cr3+ and ~2.5% for Cu2+ions. The results after analysis concludes
that ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensor exhibit superior
and a better selectivity and accuracy for simultaneous detection of a number of ions
at a single platform.

The sensing tests is normally conducted under optimal experimental conditions
and at room temperature. By knowing the drain current (ID) versus gate voltage (V G)
characteristics, the performance can be easily measured for the solution-gated ZnO-
NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensors. Both of these exhibit
a higher electron mobility, showing a good conduction pathway. As observed in
Fig. 39a, an increase in the concentration of Cr3+ ions in the electrolyte causes an
increase in the current in ZnO-NGs@GO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensor. The increased
current could be explained on the basis of good ion concentration and electron inter-
activeness during the reaction [216]. Figure 39b depicts the behavior of a ZnO-
NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensor for the detection of Cu(II) ions at room temper-
ature. The presence of Cu(II) ion concentration can vary from 10 to 80 μM due to
fast rapid change in current and charge conduction resulting due to outstanding
electron interaction throughout the reaction. The GO/rGO nanocomposites can be
considered as active sites for metal ion anchoring [217] if their surfaces are attached
with hydroxyl and carboxylic groups. The calibration curves as seen in Fig. 39c, d
for ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensors can be plotted
taking the visible current changes into account followed by calculating the mean
value of currents over the total potential range. Cr(III) and Cu(II) can be detected very
easily by critically analyzing numerous factors contributing to the enhanced sensing
response of the MI-FETs sensor. Firstly, deposition of ZnO-NGs takes place over
GO/rGO, with no free GO/rGO (as conﬁrmed by FESEM), afﬁrming their agglom-
eration and effective contact area reduction with Cr3+or Cu2+ [218, 219]. As a result,
uniform dispersion of ZnO-NGs can be attributed after the inclusion of GO/rGO in
the nanocomposite thereby providing an ideal level of metal ion penetration along
with its transport. Also, the nanocomposite electrical conductivity under study (as
evidenced by measurements on conductivity) [199, 205, 206, 220–225] can be greatly
affected by adding Go/rGO. The FTIR studies conﬁrms the presence of Zn–O–C
chemical bonds at the interface of ZnO-NGs/GO or ZnO-NGs/rGO promoting quick
and speedy electron transfer [226]. As the surface area for GO/rGO is more, more
of metal ion adsorption [227, 228] can take place.
Figure 40 suggests a mechanism for eliminating metal ion using ZnO-NGs/GO
or ZnO-NGs/rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs. On applying a strong electrostatic ﬁeld to
modiﬁed MI-FETs sensor, the physio-adsorbed water molecules gets segregated
from PBS so as to form hydronium and hydroxide ions. The active adsorption
sites are formed at the electrodes due to the presence of OH−group. According
to Wang et al., the aqueous solution comprising metal cations can react immediately
with as formed OH−groups so as to form a narrow layer at the electrode mate-
rial surface [229]. After a period of time, with increase in the number of negative
adsorptive sites on the electrode material surface, the adsorption process achieves
saturation thereby resulting in poor adsorption. The difference in work function
between ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocomposites causes an impact on
various properties like conduction, electro-catalytic activity, and extent to which a
metal ion solvation and adsorption can take place. Due to their surface carboxyl and
hydroxyl groups, ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO nanocomposites modiﬁed
MI-FETs sensors generate more oxygenated groups than pristine ZnO. This results

in strong hydrogen bond formation on the exterior of oxygen-rich GO and water
molecules. These hydrogen bonds in nanocomposites causes bonding between GO/
rGO and ZnO, by producing high density of adsorbed water molecules, which can
help enhancing fast sensing behavior to multiple ions [230]. Both ZnO-NGs@GO
and ZnO-NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensors stands reliable when fabricating
ﬁve MI-FETs sensor devices that can be tested for Cr3+ and Cu2+ ion detection.
The ID–V G plots for ﬁve devices are shown in Fig. 41a, b. The current values are
almost invariable, indicating very less visible differences in the performance of ﬁve
devices-based MI-FETs sensors. Figure 41a, b insets show that all the ﬁve devices
containing both the electrodes show nearly equivalent current, concluding that both
ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensors show large relia-
bility for metal ion detection. The fabricated MI-FETs sensors were monitored for
40 days using stability tests so as to determine their sensor performances. Figure 41c
represents, the plot of sensitivity versus days for both ZnO-NGs@GO and ZnO-
NGs@rGO modiﬁed MI-FETs sensors. With high stability and showing almost no
change in sensor response, trace detection of Cr(III) and Cu(II) ions can be done
easily. With new MI-FETs sensors having greater sensitivity and lesser LOD, Cr3+
and Cu2+ ions can be quickly and easily detected.

Indandione Oligomer@Graphene Oxide Based Sensor
for Heavy Metals Detection
The ever increasing demand of various organic semiconducting or electronic mate-
rials due to their unique properties like chemical and electrochemical ﬂexibility, have
paved lot of attention these days towards the ﬁeld of electrochemistry. Electrochem-
ical sensors with excellent features are widely known for their easy operation, quick-
ness, remarkable detection performance, cost-effectiveness, and selective analytic
technique [231]. Designing a new electrode material is signiﬁcant as the sensing
performance largely depends on the electrode materials used. Doing so can increase
the catalytic effects and can eliminate interferers.
Conjugated organic semiconductors exhibit high electrical conduction, have
increased efﬁciency, possess charge transport characteristics that can be tailored
accordingly with an effective and a fast signal transduction, and thus cannot be
ignored while developing electrode materials [232–236]. The enhanced sensitivity
and selectivity in case of conjugated organic semiconductors is due to the presence
of π-conjugation [237, 238], that can help in more interaction with the constituent
elements in any reduction-oxidation process.
Synthesis of an electrode material like indandione oligomer is the main area of
concern in the present study because of its relation to conjugated organic semicon-
ductors. The idea is to develop a small molecule semiconductor made of 2-(5′′-hexyl-
[2,2′:5′2′′terthiophen]-5-yl)methylene)-1H-indene-1,3(2H) dione, HTD, containing
three thiophene (3 T) unit and 1,3 indandione along with a single hexyl side chain.
Hexyl side chains in synthesized HTD not only improves the solubility in common
organicsolventsbutalsoimproveschargetransportproperties,molecularpackingand
thin ﬁlm formation [239]. The sensing performance can be improvised by a number
of electrode surface modiﬁcations. The electrode modiﬁcation can be done using
graphene oxide (GO) [240, 241] because of its peculiar properties like higher total
surface area per unit mass of a material, chemically invariable, signiﬁcantly larger
conjugation and non-polar attributes. Aim of the current work is to modify GCE
by functionalizing indandione oligomer (HTD) with GO. HTD oligomer comprises
a π-bond facilitating GO surface adsorption via hydrogen bonds and interactions
via π–π* stacking and Vander Waals both [242]. The electroanalytical qualities of
the system can be greatly enhanced using carbonaceous material to HTD oligomer
which causes surface area increase and affects the mass transport of the analyte. The
interaction of HTD oligomer and GO not only improves the electrical conductivity
but dispensability too.
The FESEM analysis however veriﬁes the morphologies of HTD oligomer and
functionalized nanocomposite HTD@GO. The typical morphology of an organic
small molecule [243] can be easily understood by studying the morphology of
an HTD oligomer with irregular small rods as shown in Fig. 42a. The function-
alized nanocomposite HTD@GO is a composite formed by uniform mixing of HTD
oligomer and GO as shown in Fig. 42b, c. As shown in Fig. 42d, large grains result
due to rod and GO agglomeration because of large concentration of GO (1 mg) in

an HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite. Well uniformly mixed thin ﬁlm of GO
(0.5 mg) in HTD@GO nanocomposite can be obtained by taking an optimized ratio.
UV-Vis absorption of HTD oligomer and HTD@GO functionalized nanocompos-
ites was quantiﬁed in chloroform solution. According to Fig. 43a, the synthesized
HTD oligomer shows an absorption band at ~355 nm and another prominent one at
~515 nm corresponding to π–π* transition and n–π* transitions respectively [245].
On the other hand, three absorption bands are observed for HTD@GO function-
alized nanocomposite at ~251 nm, ~355 nm, and ~525 nm, corresponding to GO
and HTD oligomer characteristics bands, respectively [246]. The π–π* interaction
in HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite between GO and HTD oligomer [247],
causes absorption band to slip towards higher absorption edge. Figure 43b shows
that in comparison to other ratios of HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposites, GO
(0.5 mg) in HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite has the maximum absorp-
tion intensity assuring a uniform mixing of GO and HTD oligomer. HTD oligomer
and HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposites are investigated using PL spectra
having 350 nm excitation wavelength, as shown in Fig. 43c, d. A distinct PL peak is
observed in the green region [248] centered at ~635 nm indicating the presence of the
benzenoid groups in HTD oligomer. With PL quenching, there is a shift from ~635
to ~656 nm as observed in HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite. The singlet
excitons that are produced are described by this quenching [249]. GO interaction

further with HTD oligomer causes quick accelerated quenching process. This is the
largest quenching being measured for HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite with
GO (0.5 mg), ensuring the emission process of HTD oligomer, a conjugated organic
semiconductor.
FTIR spectra in Fig. 44a represents HTD oligomer and HTD@GO functionalized
nanocomposite. At ~2922 and ~2861 cm−1, HTD oligomer exhibits C–H stretching
(aliphatic) and at ~1716 and ~1672 cm−1 we obtain C=O stretching, similarly at
~1576 cm−1, C=C stretching, at 1432 cm−1 C=C (aromatic) stretching, and H–
C–H bonding at ~1380 and ~1337 cm−1 [250]. A peak is obtained at 1196 cm−1
for C–S–C bending, and likewise two peaks are observed for C–S stretching at
~797 and ~726 cm−1 [251]. The link between GO and HTD oligomer can be
conﬁrmed observing the IR bands in HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite that
shift negatively to ~1708, ~1568, and ~1231 cm−1. The marginal shifting at ~1568
and ~1708 cm−1 in the IR band suggests the π–π* interactions in GO and HTD
oligomer and presence of partial hydrogen bonding [252]. The structural behavior of

the HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite can be well explained by Raman spec-
troscopy as shown in Fig. 44b. At 1356 cm−1, GO Raman bands are obtained corre-
sponding to the D band or K-point phonons of A1g symmetry and at 1595 cm−1, the
RamanactiveGbandofsp2 hybridizedcarbon(theE2g phonons),areobtainedrespec-
tively [253, 254]. As seen from Fig. 44b, there is a visible shift of the Raman bands
in HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposites, for D from 1356 cm−1 to 1347 cm−1
and for G from 1595 cm−1 to 1540 cm−1, conﬁrming a correlation between HTD
oligomer and GO via C–S+ interaction with the carboxylate group [255] of HTD
oligomer and GO respectively. The above discussed results were in close agreement
to those with the FTIR results.
Different chemical states like O 1s, S 2p, and C 1s can be explored in HTD@GO
functionalized nanocomposite using XPS measurements. As shown in Fig. 45a, the
survey XPS spectrum shows 164 eV, 284.5 eV, and 520.2 eV as three binding energy
peaks representing S 2p, C 1s and O 1s peaks respectively. An extensive structural
interaction between HTD oligomer and GO can be concluded from XPS high reso-
lution at C 1s, S 2p, and O 1s. As shown in Fig. 45b, C 1s XPS spectra shows binding
energies of HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite positioned at deconvoluted
peaks 289.1 286.3, 284.8 eV and 283.4, referring to –O–C=O, C–O, C–S, C–H, and
C–C bonds [255, 256]. Binding energy at 284.8 eV is represented in Fig. 45b with
sp2 type C–C bond in GO and benzonoid ring in HTD oligomer. This suggests GO-
S (thiophene unit in HTD oligomer) bonding and intermingling of C–C aromatic
bonds in GO and HTD oligomer. The deconvoluted O 1s XPS of an HTD@GO
functionalized nanocomposite is shown in Fig. 45c showing three binding energy
peaks and one at the center. The binding energy of around 530.9 eV is appropriate
for C=O or C–OH group [248] in case of carbonaceous materials and 531.8 eV for
C=O and O=C–O−functional groups in HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite.
Also, greater binding energy peak at 532.4 eV [249] is obtained for bound water
molecules. S 2p XPS spectrum of an HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite as
shown in Fig. 45d with binding energies at 165.1 eV (S 2p1/2) and 163.8 eV (S 2p3/2)

because of the presence of C–S bond [250]. The presence of thiophene (S) in the
HTD oligomer is conﬁrmed by the binding energy peak at 162.5 eV. In comparison
to S 2p XPS of GO-S bond [251], the above discussion shows a slight shift towards
higher binding energy specifying the interaction of sulphur in HTD oligomer with
carboxylate group of GO, forming hydrogen bonds partially.
For detection of heavy metal ion, at a scan rate of 50 mV/s, CV measurements are
taken so as to analyse the selectivity of the HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe. A variety
of metal ion solutions containing ions like K+, Cu2+, Cr2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Al3+ can be
taken under study with 0.1 M PBS solution as a supporting electrolyte. As seen from
(Fig. 46a), the sensing behavior of the HTD@GO functionalized nanocomposite can
be investigated by plotting CV plots of bare GCE, GO/GCE, and HTD@GO/GCE
in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte with 0.05 M KCl. In comparison to bare GCE electrodes
showing a feeble response of current because of the poor conductivity of the GCE
electrode, GO/GCE produces a slightly stronger response of current due to presence
of GO, which possess numerous active sites over the electrode surface. Figure 46a
represents an oxidation current peak which represents a high current response for the
HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe. The improved surface properties and higher electron
transfer rate of this probe is subjected to good bonding between HTD oligomer and
GO (conﬁrmed by XPS results), GO having large surface area, uniform dispersion of

E.-B. Kim et al.
HTD oligomer into GO (conﬁrmed by FESEM results). Thus, the current response
characteristics can be greatly enhanced by modifying the GO/GCE surface with
conjugated organic semiconductors by increasing electrode conductivity. Through
charge injection barrier depletion, HTD oligomer charge hopping transport mecha-
nism improves HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe. Figure 46b represents CV responses
of the HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe for determining 6 metal ions at 1 μM concentra-
tions depicts the CV responses of the HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe to the determi-
nation of six metal ions at 1 μM concentrations namely K+, Mn2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Cr2+,
Al3+. Among all ions, Cr2+ ions show a strong anodic current response at −0.31 V,
and for Cu2+ ions at 0.21 V. Thus, Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions can be detected easily in 0.1 M
PBS electrolyte by HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe. More adsorption of target ions
takes place by HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe with a stronger signal for both Cr2+ and
Cu2+ ions because of I HTD oligomer negative charges and C–S- and C=O−. Also,
high surface-to-volume ratio allows GO moieties for providing a larger effective
active area for nucleation [252]. From Fig. 46c, d, by using stripping voltammetry,
Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions can be detected using the same electrode in 0.1 M PBS (pH = 7)
so as to verify the usefulness of electrochemical method for detecting various metal
ions. It is found that −0.29 V and 0.24 V and are the peak potentials for Cr2+ and
Cu2+ ions respectively. Also, Cu2+ peak detection intensity is more in comparison
to the peak intensity of Cr2+ ion in the supporting electrolyte. This reduction could
be explained on the basis of origination of intermetallic compounds and a number
of active sites of the HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe between analytes and interfering
ions [257]. The above results reveal that with a greater sensitivity of the fabricated
HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe detection of multiple heavy metal ions (such as Cr2+
and Cu2+ ions) can be done simultaneously.
Figure 47 depicts the proposed mechanism for determining Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions.
As previously discussed, the interaction of HTD oligomer with a large surface area of
GO considerably improves the electrical conductivity of the electrode as number of
active sites increases substantially. This is needed for the adsorption of heavy metal
ions like Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions thereby improvising the electron transfer properties
at the electrode, and their easy interaction with the surface of the HTD@GO/GCE
sensor probe, leading to both current and conductance increase.
A number of CV plots for different ion concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 μM in
PBS electrolyte were taken so as to analyse the sensing properties of the HTD@GO/
GCE sensor probe for Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions. The CV plots of the HTD@GO/GCE
sensor probe as shown in Fig. 48a represents plot of various Cr2+ ion concentrations
in 0.1 M PBS electrolyte. With the increase in the concentration of Cr2+ ions, the
anodic current gradually increases at −0.31 V thereby indicating an increase in
the ionic strength of an electrolyte. Figure 48b on the other side represents quite
a similarity of the HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe for the detection of Cu2+ ions.
As its concentration increases the corresponding anodic current also increases. By
altering the ionic concentrations, the anodic current thus can be easily known from
the CV plots that helps explaining the sensing characteristics of the HTD@GO/GCE
sensor probe for determining Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions. These ions can be detected from
CV measurements as shown in Fig. 48c, d depicting the calibration plots of anodic

current responses. For Cr2+, sensitivity ~483.3 μA μM−1 cm−2, limit of detection
(LOD) ~3.65 μM and regression coefﬁcient value is ~0.90113 and that for Cu+2 ions
it is ~101.47 μA μM−1 cm−2, ~2.25 μM, ~0.95867, respectively. A linear increase
in the current with ionic concentration can be easily seen in the calibration plots
for Cr2+ and Cu+2 ions. For Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions, the linear dynamics can be seen as
1–100 μM and limit of detection as 3.65 μM for Cr2+ and 2.25 μM for Cu+2 ions.
The reliability of HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe as seen from Fig. 49a, b, can be
determined by knowing the sensing responses from six electrodes all under same
conditions. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) are 10% for Cr2+ and 6.40% for
Cu2+ ions. If compared to the standard values, HTD@GO/GCE sensor probes differ
almost negligible proving their reproducibility and reliability as sensor electrode for
detecting Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions. Their stability can be tested for 30 days by checking out
their sensing behavior. From Fig. 49c, sensor sensitivity is similar even after 30 days
of testing i.e., 92.5% and 91.4% for Cr2+ ions and Cu2+ ions respectively conﬁrming
good stability of the fabricated electrochemical sensor. The sensor sensitivity remains

that the developed electrochemical sensor is stable.
Figure 50 shows the electrochemical performance in the real sample for deter-
mining Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions in 0.1 M PBS so as to check the practical application
of HTD@GO/GCE sensor probe and the developed fabricated sensor. The feeble
anodic currents of Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions in bare tap water implies lesser concentrations
at ~0.31 and ~0.21 V. With the concentration as low as 1 mM, the HTD@GO/GCE
sensor probe as shown in Fig. 50a, b exhibits the clear, deﬁned and distinct stripping
peaks and signals for Cr2+ and Cu2+ ions.

Conclusions
The presence of heavy metal contamination poses a signiﬁcant risk to human health,
and there is an urgent need for technology that can rapidly and accurately detect toxic
heavy metals. This chapter introduces an electrochemical sensor-based approach to
detect heavy metals, with a particular emphasis on recent applications using various
electrode modiﬁcation materials, such as metal oxides and graphene-based nanocom-
posites. The use of graphene nanocomposites as electrode materials has several

advantages, including mechanical strength, high surface area, and excellent elec-
tronic transport ability, in addition to the beneﬁts of metal oxides. The electrochem-
ical sensors are commonly used to detect heavy metals in water samples. Therefore,
future efforts to design and develop electrochemical sensors should not only focus on
improving sensitivity and speciﬁcity but also on minimizing interference in complex
samples and enabling simultaneous detection of multiple targets. By doing so, this
technique can be widely applied outside the laboratory to detect heavy metals and
protect the environment and human health.

Breath Analyzer and Toxic Gas Detection
Sensor Design by Using Nanomaterial
Multilayered Structure

Introduction
Different types of multilayered structures [1–6] are at the forefront of technology
research these days. These multilayered structures can have applications in optical
sensing. In my previous work [7], I have designed a blood glucose sensor for the
determination of concentration of glucose in blood by using a particular type of
multilayer structure. In this chapter, another multilayer structure is used to design a
breath analyzer and a toxic gas detection sensor. In this multilayer structure, there are
18 layers of three different dielectric materials followed by an air groove in sequence
with 18 layers of the same three materials’ combination. In this multilayer structure,
the variation in refractive index is in one direction only, as compared to 2D and 3D
multilayered structures [8–10] so, this multilayer structure is easy to fabricate and
has a low cost. As discussed before, in this chapter, this multilayer structure is used
to design two devices: a breath analyzer and a toxic gas detection sensor. A breath
analyzer is an important device that is used to detect the presence of alcohol content
in blood by analyzing the breath sample. The structure for breath analyzer is shown
in Fig. 1. To use this structure as a breath analyzer, the structural parameters are
mentioned in Figs. 2 and 3. A normal breath sample without alcohol content can be
passed through the air groove in this structure and a reference light spectrum can be
computed. If a breath sample with alcohol content is passed through the air groove,
then, the output light spectrum will be different from the reference light spectrum.
Here, the light spectrum of the nanomaterial multilayered structure depends on the
refractive index of breath sample and the parameters of nanomaterial multilayered
structure. The parameters of the nanomaterial multilayered structure will be constant

in both cases, so, the variation in the light spectrum will be there due to change in
refractive index of breath sample due to the presence of alcohol (as the refractive
index of breath sample with alcohol content will be different from the breath sample
without alcohol content).
This multilayered structure can also be used to design a toxic gas detection sensor.
To use this structure as a toxic gas detection sensor, the structural parameters are
mentioned in Figs. 4 and 5. A gas sensor is a sensing device that is used to detect the
presence of a particular gas in atmosphere. Speciﬁcally, a toxic gas detector is used
to sense or detect the presence of a toxic gas in atmosphere due to accidental leakage.
To use this toxic gas detection sensor, a reference light spectrum can be computed
when there is no toxic gas present in the air in the surrounding atmosphere. Now,
if there is a leakage of toxic gas in the surrounding atmosphere then the o/p light
spectrum of multilayered structure will immediately change and it will be different

from reference light spectrum observed earlier. Here, the o/p light spectrum of the
nanomaterial multilayered structure depends on refractive index of the air groove
and other structural parameters (layer thicknesses and other layer refractive indices)
of nanomaterial multilayered structure. Since other parameters of the nanomaterial
multilayered structure will remain constant, so, if there is any toxic gas present in
the surrounding atmosphere, then, the variation in the light spectrum will be there
due to change in refractive index of air groove due to the presence of toxic gas in the
surrounding air (as the refractive index of air with toxic gas will be different from
the normal air without toxic gas).

Theory and Results
The optical Transfer M. Model [7] can be used to compute the spectrum of nanoma-
terial multilayered structure breath analyzer. The spectrum of this breath analyzer
nanomaterial multilayered structure with normal breath sample which is without
alcohol content is shown in Fig. 2. This will be a reference light spectrum. The spec-
trum of this breath analyzer nanomaterial multilayered structure with breath sample
containing alcohol content is shown in Fig. 3. It can be clearly seen here that as
soon as breath sample with alcohol content is passed through this breath analyzer
structure, the o/p transmission spectrum changes immediately. The o/p transmission
spectrum shifts due to the presence of alcohol content in breath.

Similarly, the optical transfer M. model can also be used to compute the spectrum
of nanomaterial multilayered structure toxic gas sensor. The spectrum of this toxic
gas detection sensor nanomaterial multilayered structure in normal atmospheric air
is shown in Fig. 4. This will be reference light spectrum. The spectrum of this toxic
gas detection sensor nanomaterial multilayered structure with toxic gas present in
the surrounding atmosphere is shown in Fig. 5. It can be clearly seen here that
as soon as toxic gas leaks in the atmosphere o/p transmission spectrum changes
immediately. The o/p transmission spectrum shifts due to the presence of toxic gas
in the atmosphere.

Conclusions
In this chapter, designs of breath analyzer and toxic gas detection sensor were demon-
strated by using a nanomaterial multilayered structure. The breath sample to be tested
can be passed through the air groove in this structure and the light spectrum can be
observed. The breath sample without alcohol content will generate a normal light
spectrum. The breath sample with alcohol content will generate a light spectrum
different from normal light spectrum. Thus, the presence of alcohol content in breath
sample can be immediately detected by using this breath analyzer structure. Further,
in toxic gas detection sensor structure, the air to be tested can be passed through
the groove and the light spectrum can be observed. The air without toxic gas will
generate a normal light spectrum. The air with toxic gas will generate a light spectrum
different from normal light spectrum. Thus, the presence of toxic gas in atmosphere
can be immediately detected by using this toxic gas detection sensor structure. This
kind of toxic gas detection sensor ﬁnds potential application in industry and factories.
This idea can also be used to detect domestic cooking gas leakage.

Introduction
Nanobiotechnology/bionanotechnology is the branch of nanotechnology with the
manipulation of biological and biochemical organisms or their uses. Nanobiotech-
nology frequently examines natural components with the goal of constructing novel
devices. The term bionanotechnology is occasionally employed as a substitute for
nanobiotechnology, but the two concepts are occasionally differentiated from one
another. When drawing a distinction between the two, typically nanobiotechnology
pertains to the utilization of nanotechnology to advance biotechnology objectives,
whereas bionanotechnology may encompass any crossover between biology and
nanotechnology, encompassing the utilization of biomolecules as a component of, or
inﬂuence for, nanotechnological devices [1–3]. Nanobiotechnology, also known as
biological nanotechnology, involves the integration of nanoscale devices into living
organisms with the goal of enhancing the organism’s overall well-being. To date,
the limited techniques in number exist for manufacturing nanodevices that could

focuses on ﬁnding infections in the human body and eliminating these harmful cells,
delivering drugs to sick cells, and employing nanodevices to treat and prevent cancer
[1–3].
1.1
Application Areas of Nanobiotechnology
The application area of the nanobiotechnology is very vast and diversiﬁed including
cosmetics, skincare, DNA interaction, drug delivery, cancers, tissue engineering,
nanomedicines, molecular biology, markers, therapeutics, clinical bio-analytical
diagnostics, imaging, non-viral gene carriers, photosensitizer in photodynamic
therapy, and so on [4–12], we are here discussing some major areas of nanobiotech-
nology.
1.2
Biosensors
An analytical device, biosensor precisely interacts with an analyte using biolog-
ical materials. This interaction results in some observable physical change, which is
detected and turned into an electrical signal by a transducer. Ultimately, the ampli-
ﬁed electrical signal is analyzed and exhibited as the concentration of the analyte
within the solution or mixture. In the context of biosensors, an analyte is a substance
whose concentration is intended to be assessed. Enzymes are typically the biolog-
ical materials utilized, although other substances such as nucleic acid, lectins, entire
organs or slices of tissue, antibodies, whole cells, may also be employed. There are
two possible types of interaction between the biological components utilized in the
biosensors and the analyte. The analyte may be changed by enzymes into a different
chemical molecule, in which case the biosensor is referred to as a catalytic biosensor
or (ii) it could merely attach to the biological components on the biosensors (e.g. to
antibodies, nucleic acids; those biosensors are called afﬁnity biosensors).
For a biosensor to be considered successful, it needs to possess certain charac-
teristics, which include the following: (i) it must exhibit high speciﬁcity towards
the analyte, (ii) the reaction mechanism employed should be largely unaffected by
factors such as pH, temperature, and stirring to the extent that is feasible, (iii) the
response generated by the biosensor should demonstrate linearity over a variety of
analyte concentrations, (iv) the sensor device must be compact and biocompatible,
especially if it is intended for use within the body, (v) the biosensor should be inex-
pensive, small, and user-friendly, and (vi) it should be durable enough to permit
repeated use [13–15].

1.2.1
Types of Biosensors
Generally, ﬁve types of biosensors that are mostly used, viz (i) calorimetric, (ii)
potentiometric, (iii) amperometric, (iv) optical, and (v) piezoelectric biosensors.
1.2.2
Calorimetric Biosensors
The most generally used kind of biosensor is based on enzyme-catalyzed reactions,
which are frequently exothermic wherein the heat produced by these processes can
be used to measure the rate of reaction and, consequently, the analyte concentration.
It is customary to use thermometers to record temperature variations at the entry and
exit of compact columns that hold immobilized enzymes and are kept at a constant
temperature. When the reaction is conducted in such tightly regulated conditions, as
much as 80% of the heat produced during the process can be detected as a temperature
shift in the sample stream. This may be readily determined by computing the enthalpy
change and the quantity of reactants consumed.
1.2.3
Potentiometric Biosensors
The utilization of ion-selective electrodes in potentiometric biosensors is to translate
the biological response into an electrical output. In essence, this is enclosing the pH-
meter probe with an enzyme membrane surrounding it, where the catalyzed reaction
generates or consumes hydrogen ions. As the reaction takes place near the delicate
glass membrane sensing electrode, there is a pH’s change that can be read off in
the display of pH meter. These electrodes are typically employed under conditions
of extremely high impedance, which results in virtually zero current ﬂow, thereby
avoiding any interference with the reaction.
1.2.4
Amperometric Biosensors
Amperometric biosensors work by generating an electric current wherein a poten-
tial is applied across two electrodes. These usually have dynamic ranges, sensi-
tivities, and response times to potentiometric biosensors that are comparable. One
commonly used type of amperometric biosensor is the Clark oxygen electrode, which
is very simple in design. It comprises of a reference electrode made of silver and
silver chloride and a platinum cathode where oxygen is reduced. When a potential
is applied to the platinum cathode relative to the Ag/AgCl electrode, the current
to oxygen concentration is generated. Usually, both electrodes are immersed in an
electrolyte or a saturated solution of KCl and parted from the bulk solution via
a permeable plastic membrane that allows oxygen to pass through (for example,
Teﬂon or polytetraﬂuoroethylene).

98
R. Wahab et al.
Due to the effective oxygen reduction at the cathode surface, the concentration
of oxygen there is nearly zero. As a result, the rate of electrochemical reduction is
dependent on the rate of oxygen diffusion from the bulk solution that in turn, depends
on the concentration gradient and the bulk concentration of oxygen. Because of this,
changes in temperature have a more considerable inﬂuence on the sensitivity of
oxygen electrodes compared to potentiometric sensors.
1.2.5
Optical Biosensors
These techniques need to evaluate the variations in light absorption between a reac-
tion’s reactants and products or spotting light released during a luminous process.
Recent trend is to use patterned optical waveguides or optical ﬁber with immo-
bilized enzymes. The light generated can be detected using costly high-voltage
photomultiplier tubes or more affordable low-voltage photodiode systems.
1.2.6
Piezoelectric Biosensors
Piezoelectric crystals, like quartz, vibrate in the presence of an electric ﬁeld. Because
every crystal has a different resonance frequency, the thickness and cut of the crystal
affect the oscillation’s frequency. The adsorption or desorption of molecules from the
crystal’s surface alters its resonant frequency. Any piezoelectric crystal will exhibit
a frequency change that is proportionate to the mass of material absorbed. These
electronic circuits can easily detect the change in frequency. However, the primary
challenge of these devices is that they are vulnerable to interference caused by atmo-
spheric humidity and not suitable for determining materials in solution. Nevertheless,
thesedevicesareaffordable,compact,durable,andcapableofproducingquickresults
[14].

Application of Metal Oxide Nanostructures
as a Biosensor Material
Zinc oxide (ZnO), a versatile semiconductor material, has gained attention for its
diverse applications in electro-sensor devices, solar cells, luminescent technologies,
and more. As a nanoporous substance belonging to the richest family of nanostruc-
tures, nanoporous materials can also serve as a substrate for the biomolecule immo-
bilization. Zhao et al. [16] employed effective immobilization of GOx on nanoclus-
ters of ZnO:Co ﬁlms by cross-linking method. Liu et al. [17] used ZnO ﬂower-like
structure synthesized by hydrothermal method as substrate for horseradish perox-
idase immobilization. In continuation, Zhang et al. [18] immobilized urease on
ZnO nanorods for uric acid sensing. In another report, Zhao et al. [16] presented

a novel amperometric glucose biosensor by using ZnO:Co nanoclusters, which
are synthesized with particle size of 5 nm via nanocluster-beam deposition. The
GOx was immobilized via naﬁon-assisted cross-linking technique on the surface of
ZnO:Co thin ﬁlms. The researchers noticed that the glucose biosensor they made
demonstrated a remarkable sensitivity of 13.3 µA/mA cm2. They calculated that the
minimum detectable concentration was 20 µM (S/N = 3), and they also determined
the Michaelis-Menten constant to be 21 mM, which indicates that the enzyme has
a strong attraction to glucose when attached to ZnO:Co nanoclusters. In another
report, Liu et al. [17] presented a simple hydrothermal preparation of nanosized
ﬂower-like zinc oxide formation for the H2O2 biosensors formation. The composite
of ZnO/chitosan composite has been prepared by adding synthesized ZnO in chitosan
solution for the fabrication biosensor. A composite that combines the advantages of
an inorganic species (ZnO) and an organic polymer (chitosan). The authors found
that the sensor had a low detection limit of 2.0 µM, with a signal-to-noise ratio
of 3. They also observed that the biosensor had good reproducibility and stability,
retaining approximately 78% of its original response after 40 days of storage in a
phosphate buffer at 4 °C. Zhang et al. [18] presented the uric acid biosensors immo-
bilized on ZnO nanorods. They found that the electrode made from ZnO nanorods
preserved the activity of the enzyme and facilitated electron transfer between the
enzyme and the electrode. The sensor was able to maintain its performance at high
temperatures of up to 85 °C and also showed the ability to catalyze the uric acid
oxidation without requiring an electron mediator. The uric acid sensor displayed a
linear relationship between uric acid concentrations ranging from 5.0 × 10−6 to 1.0
× 10−3 mol L−1, with a low LOD of 2.0 × 10−6 mol L−1 at 3σ. Uric acid sensor
presented the apparent KMapp value of 0.238 mM, explaining its high afﬁnity. An
important consideration in constructing electrochemical biosensors is to immobilize
bio-derived molecules on the transducer without affecting their activity and structural
conformations. Several techniques can be used to immobilize biological components,
such as self-assembled monolayers (SAM), co-immobilization, ferrocene (which
serves as an electron mediator), and electrocatalytic oxidation, among others. These
methods have been explored in studies [19–23]. The effectiveness and dependability
of the biosensor produced can be inﬂuenced by the chosen immobilization method
[24, 25]. The main parameters are normally crucial for sensing behavior of these
biomaterials, in particular, their device-based application like FETs or electrochem-
ical biosensors, is nothing but the work function, contact potential or generally called
surface potential of the semiconductor. The role of surface potential of semiconduc-
tors in determining the performance and properties of semiconductor-based devices
and sensors involving surface chemistry is widely acknowledged. Understanding of
the surface potential would be vital in realizing the behavior of these materials and
their application. In general, the chemical characteristics of material’s surface are
primarily inﬂuenced by the active chemical groups present, not by the crystal struc-
ture. As we know that the type and quantity of surface functionalities on material’s
surface are determined by both the material’s chemical compositions as well as any
subsequent chemical modiﬁcations and treatments. For example, to date it is made

clear that surface treatment can induce various functional groups that help in immo-
bilizing/interacting with organic materials. Chemical functionalization of carbon
nanotubes(CNTs)doesnotneedanyintroductiontothereaderswhereonecancontrol
the functional group on the surface/edges of CNTs by simple methods. Bardeen and
Morrison [25] reported and numerous subsequent studies by other researchers have
conﬁrmed that the addition of speciﬁc functionalities or surface chemical functional-
ization leads to unique physicochemical properties of the semiconductor. Some of the
parameters which could be important for electrochemical biosensor are: (i) chemical
reactions with electron transfer, (ii) adsorption, and (iii) surface conductance-channel
effect. External chemical stimuli can substantially modify the surface properties of
the semiconductor, and therefore, these altered properties resulting from surface
chemical functionalization can serve as the fundamental framework for developing
the devices. Surface current, potential, and impedance of electrode can be moni-
tored which are usually associated to the chemical stimuli due to the interaction/
immobilization of organic material on the semiconductor sensing surface. Given
these circumstances, semiconductors are highly suitable matrices for sensor elements
and transducers in the creation of diverse chemical sensor and biosensor systems.
These interactions would normally tend in affecting the electrochemical character-
istics like space charge, ﬁeld and potential on the surface, which are very important
parameters. One instance of this is with amperometric sensors, which rely on alter-
ations in either the conductance of the material or the activity of redox species
present in the sensor element. As a result, it is evident that the creation of chemical
sensors or biosensors utilizing semiconductors necessitates meticulous regulation
of surface chemistry. In these situations, it is possible to optimize the analytical
characteristics of sensor, including selectivity, sensitivity, detection limit, reaction
time, and signal stability. The identiﬁcation and detection of analytes are achieved
by disturbing the electro-optical characteristics of both the surface and subsurface
layers of the semiconductor. To enable this, the analyte must undergo a speciﬁc and
reversible chemical interaction with the semiconductor sensing element. With the
advancement of material science and improved regulation of the growth process,
semiconductors have become increasingly utilized in the creation of sensors. Nanos-
tructured inorganic materials are becoming steadily crucial in the advancement of
biosensors, owing to their chemical inertness with biomolecules, thermal stability,
and ability to operate at low temperatures. Small sizes of materials result in a large
surface area, enhancing sensitivity and performance, enabling swift in vivo analysis,
and facilitating the manufacturing electrochemical sensors, biosensors, or biochips.
Applying nanotechnology in architecture of electrode, sensors such as glucose or
urea sensors, can prove to be superior to conventional spectroscopic methods, as
they can be integrated into an online monitoring system and provide beneﬁts for indi-
viduals with diabetes or urinary-related diseases, among others. Glucose/urease is a
widely used enzyme in biosensor construction, particularly for glucose/urea detec-
tion, which is in high demand. Diabetic individuals typically have glucose levels of
around 360 mg/dl, whereas a normal physiological range is 110 ± 25 mg/dl [26,
27]. Urea, a carbon containing compound, contains carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
hydrogen element. The discharge of nitrogen waste from the catabolism of protein

and amino acid is a concern for most organisms. Normal urea levels in serum range
from 3 to 7 mM (15–40 mg/dl), while patients with renal insufﬁciency have serum
urea concentrations ranging from 30 to 80 mM (180–480 mg/dl), and hemodialysis
is required at levels exceeding 180 mg/dl. High concentrations of glucose and urea
in the bloodstream can damage bodily organs, making their analysis of signiﬁcant
importance.
This article describes a methodical investigation into the identiﬁcation of urea by
employing zinc oxide that has been immobilized with urease. ZnO thick ﬁlms were
produced on an aluminum sheet using a doctor blade method. The research examined
the impact of urea on the electrical characteristics of the urease immobilized zinc
oxide ﬁlms, by changing the potential across the ﬁlm and measuring the resulting
current. Tin oxide is a type of oxide material that is frequently utilized in various
industries, such as sensor technology, opaciﬁers, and solar cells. It is a preferred
choice due to its cost-effectiveness, ability to resist chemical reactions, and beneﬁcial
electrical properties that make it a desirable industrial compound [28]. However, the
use of metal oxide in bio sensing applications has yet to be examined, which could
introduce a new class of material in the area of bio-inorganic materials [29–31]. The
detection capabilities of urea using zinc oxide in thick ﬁlm form were investigated.
To prepare the ﬁlms, zinc oxide was applied to an aluminum sheet using a standard
doctor blade method with the use of organic additives. ZnO materials with nanobelts
and nanoﬂower-like structures were synthesized through a solution method with zinc
acetate dihydrate and NaOH, where the precursor concentration (ranging from 0.3
to 0.5 M) signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced the structural morphology from belts to ﬂower-
like structures. After that, the zinc oxide ﬁlm was covalently attached to urease
by immersing it in a solution containing 100 units of urease for 3 h. Generally, the
conductivityoftheﬁlmincreasedaftertheureasewasimmobilized.Theﬁlmsthathad
urease immobilized in them were discovered to be responsive to urea concentrations
ranging from 1 to 100 mM. Sensitivity appeared in three regions were identiﬁed:
(i) lower concentrations (below 10 mM); (ii) a linear region that extends to 50 mM;
and (iii) a saturation region that begins at concentrations greater than 50 mM. The
maximum urea sensitivity was achieved by the ZnO nanobelt construction, as sensor
is extremely sensitive in region (i). The sensor responses were demonstrated to be
dependable, repeatable, reversible, and discerning, with a response time of 6 s. No
signiﬁcant interference was observed with interfacing substance like glucose. The
attachment of urease to zinc oxide was conﬁrmed through the presence of an N 1s
peak in the photoelectron spectra. A plausible sensing mechanism was proposed and
analyzed [32, 33].
1.3.1
Synthesis of ZnO Nanostructures Via Solution Method
To produce ZnO with nanostructure, the solution method was utilized. This involved
dissolving Zn(CH3COO)2 · 2H2O (0.3–0.5 M) and 3 M NaOH in 100 ml of DI water,
stirring the solution well, and reﬂuxing it at 90 °C for an hour. After the reﬂuxing

102

process, the resulting white portion was neutralized through methanol and lastly
allowed to dry at 298 K.
1.3.2
Thick Film Formation
To create a thick ﬁlm paste, ZnO (70%) was mixed with organic additives (30%,
ethyl cellulose and carbitol acetate) using an agate mortar and pestle. The paste was
subsequently applied to an electropolished aluminum sheet using the doctor blade
method. The ﬁlms were ﬁrst air-dried and then placed under a heat lamp (IR-lamp-
250) to ensure they were completely dry. The substrate was degreased with acetone
and electropolished before depositing the ﬁlm.
1.3.3
Immobilization of Enzyme
To immobilize urease, the samples were soaked in a urease solution. In the beginning,
the samples were submerged in a 0.1 M PBS (pH: 7.2) buffer solution that contained
0.2 mg of urease/ml for three hours at 25 °C. A 10 ml of solution containing 100
units of urease, was prepared. Then the prepared samples were thoroughly rinsed by
PBS and stored in PBS until needed. The quantity of enzyme that was immobilized
on these samples was neither measured nor estimated.
1.3.4
Determination of Enzyme Activity After Immobilization
Once the urease was immobilized, the enzyme activity of the ZnO thick ﬁlms was
investigated by studying their electrical properties. To accomplish this, potential
ranging from 0 to 1 V was applied to the ﬁlm, and the resulting current was estimated
by using a Keithely 6517/A electrometer that was connected to a computer. Five
sets of measurements were taken for each sample. The sensors’ dependability was
assessed by examining a batch of samples. All measurements were conducted at
25 °C.
In order to conduct the measurement, a setup comprising urease-immobilized ZnO
ﬁlms and gold wire with a diameter of 1 mm and a length of 5 cm was constructed. The
electrolyteusedwasaureasolutionpreparedinPBS,andthevolumeoftheelectrolyte
was kept constant at 10 ml for all measurements. The solution was prepared with
different urea concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mM, which is equivalent to 6–
600 mg/dl. The solution pH was not monitored or adjusted. The enzyme activity is
determined by using the current-to-voltage ratio.
The researchers used a WonA Tech Potentiostat (WPG-100) to study the electro-
chemical properties of the samples in a traditional three-electrode system at room
temperature. ZnO thick ﬁlms were utilized as a working electrode, a platinum wire
(1 mm dia) was utilized as an auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl was used as a
reference electrode. The electrolyte was a solution with different urea concentrations.

laboratory prepared AAO pores of ~80 nm diameter and Si substrate at various
deposition temperatures. These ﬁlms were used for glucose and urea sensing.
1.3.6
Materials and Methods for the Fabrication and Sensing of Thin
Film SnO2
SnCl4, xH2O as precursor was employed for growing SnO2 thin ﬁlms. Glucose
oxidase (β-D-Glucose: oxygen 1-oxidoreductase, from Aspergillus Niger with 40
U/mg), Glucose (D-(+)-Glucose, or Dextrose, C6H12O6, 99.5% (GC)), urease (EC
3.5.1.5, from jack bean, 50 U/mg) and urea were received by Sigma-Aldrich. DI
water was utilized to prepare all solutions and also used for rinsing.
1.3.7
Anodic Aluminum Oxide Pore Formation on SnO2 Thin Film
The substrate used in this study was porous alumina that was fabricated in-house
using a process called anodic aluminum oxidation (AAO). To prepare the AAO,
high-purity aluminum in form of rectangular cutouts was used, then followed by
proper cleaning through standard procedures and then subjected to a series of electro-
chemical treatments. These treatments included electro-polishing, ﬁrst anodization,
wet etching, second anodization, pore widening treatment, and so on, which resulted
in the creation of a porous structure. The depth of the pores was determined by the
duration of the ﬁrst anodization, with a typical duration of 8 h producing a pore depth
of approximately 500 nm. The broadening method ultimately results in well-ordered
nanopores of high quality while pore widening decides the pore diameters (80 nm in
the present case).
1.3.8
Growth of SnO2 Nanostructures via PECVD Plasma Method
RF-PECVDdepositionwasperformedtocreateathinﬁlmofSnO2,inwhichhydrated
SnCl4, 5H2O was utilized as a precursor. The deposition was conducted in a quartz
tube furnace that ranged from 350 to 450 °C. Prior to heat the source material, the
bubbler connected to the system was vacuumed to 10–2 Torr. O2 was ﬂowed across
the system at a rate of 20 sccm while the precursor was kept at 90 °C. The deposition
was carried out for 15 min at 350, 400, and 450 °C with a pressure of 0.2 Torr. An
inductively coupled RF-power supply operating at 13.56 MHz was used to produce
plasma. These ﬁlms were used for glucose sensing.
The existing PECVD system was slightly modiﬁed for deposition on silicon
substrate. At initial, Si wafers with (100) orientation were washed using conven-
tional cleaning process. The substrates were positioned downstream from the plasma

104
R. Wahab et al.
and the precursor was loaded into an alumina boat at the gas inlet. In a vacuum of
10–3 Torr, the precursor and substrates were heated independently. To form plasma,
an inductively connected RF-power supply (13.56 MHz) was positioned between the
precursor and substrates via an RF coil. When the precursor and substrate reached
the desired temperature, the reactant pure O2 gas was pumped at a rate of 300 sccm
during the deposition process and precursor kept at 90 °C. The deposition process
was carried out for 15 min at 500–800 °C with a constant 100 W of plasma power
and 0.5 Torr of pressure. These ﬁlms were used for urea sensing. Morphology and
compositional analysis were observed by taking FESEM images and scanning the
materials via XRD and XPS, respectively.
1.3.9
Immobilization of GOx Enzyme on PECVD Fabricated
Nanostructures of SnO2
The GOx enzyme was immobilized on the samples through a process of physical
adsorption, by dipping the samples in a GOx solution. The samples were ﬁrst soaked
for 3 h at 25 °C in a PBS solution (pH 7.5) containing 25 mg of GOx (1000 units) per
10 ml and then rinsed, ﬁnally kept the samples in PBS buffer solution until further
use. Great care was taken to ensure that GOx was immobilized only on the tin oxide
surface, and not on the back side and edges of the AAO. To prevent GOx adsorption
on these parts, a lacquer coating was applied. It was not determined or estimated how
much enzyme was immobilized on these samples.
1.3.10
Determination of GOx Enzyme Activity After Immobilization
Once GOx was immobilized, the SnO2 thin ﬁlms’ electrical properties were analyzed
to determine enzyme activity. A potential ranging from 1.6 to 2.8 V was applied to the
ﬁlm, a current was obtained via I–V characteristics by Keithely 6517/A electrometer.
For each sample, ﬁve sets of measurements were taken using a cell consisting of a
gold wire (1 mm dia, 5 cm length) as one electrode and immobilized GOx SnO2
ﬁlms as the other. Glucose solution was used as an electrolyte prepared in 10 ml
PBS, with various concentrations of glucose ranging from 10 to 360 mg/dl. Ratio of
voltage-to-current was used as an enzyme activity measure (Fig. 1).

The changes in the structure of the ﬁlm have resulted in a decrease in its surface
area to volume ratio, which has had an impact on the adsorption occurring on the
ﬁlm.
The XRD peaks are in good agreement with the hexagonal ZnO d-values (JCPDS
36-1451), which have lattice constants of a = 3.249 and c = 5.206 Å, an increase in
the concentration is indicated by an increase in the intensity of the peak, suggesting
an increase in crystallinity (Fig. 3).
The I–V curves in Fig. 4 depict the ﬁlm’s behavior before and after urease immo-
bilization, using ZnO powder synthesized with 0.3 M zinc acetate dihydrate, across
different urea concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 mM (equivalent to 6–600 mg/
dl) to determine the detection limit. A broad range of concentrations was selected,
and there was a slight 2% error observed.
There is a noticeable and consistent increase in the current as the voltage is applied.
The ﬁlm’s response before and after urease immobilization is represented by the solid
and dotted curves, respectively. The data suggest a considerable boost in the ﬁlm’s
conductivity following immobilization, which is credited to the conversion of urea
in the presence of urease catalytic reaction as depicted below;

As a result of this reaction, three ions, namely two NH+
4 and CO2−
3 , are generated
from the neutral urea molecule. These ions increase the conductivity of the host
material by providing additional electrons to its conduction band.
Curves with comparable characteristics were created for the ﬁlms with 0.4 and
0.5 M concentrations, and the slope of these curves (dI/dV) was utilized to gauge
enzyme activity. The slope values were plotted against increasing urea concentration
from 0.3 to 0.5 M and displayed in Fig. 5a. These curves were employed to assess the
sensitivity of urea sensor. The impact of urea concentration and variations in ZnO
nanostructures is evident from these curves (Fig. 5a, b).
An increase in enzyme activity was obtained for all samples when urea concentra-
tion is increased. Three interesting sensitivity regions were shown in the data. Three
sensitivity zones were often visible on the sensitivity curves: (i) the region shown in
Fig. 5b at lower concentrations (below 10 mM); (ii) the linear region up to 50 mM;
and (iii) the saturation region above 50 mM. The ﬁrst region (Fig. 5b) seems to be the
most sensitive in terms of urea detection. Normal urea levels are less than 10 mM,
thus the fabricated sensors would be helpful in detecting lower urea concentrations.
As indicated in second region, the fabricated sensor can detect higher urea concen-
trations (<50 mM, 300 mg/dl). The saturation point (in third region) might occur
because urease becomes overwhelmed by the amount of urea. The three distinct
regions show that the surface reactions vary with the concentration of the substance.
At lower concentrations, the substance might just be adher on the surface (physisorp-
tion). In our previous study using tin oxide thin ﬁlm, similar regions were obtained,
but the sensors’ sensitivity was higher due to the higher surface area to volume ratio of
the nanostructured material.
It is noteworthy to observe how the surface area to volume ratio (variation in
nanostructure) affects the performance of the sensor. At 0.3 M concentration, ZnO
power-based electrode demonstrates the largest sensitivity, as estimated in region
(i). This implies that the nanobelts, with their larger surface area to volume ratio

compared to the ﬂower-like morphology, are more appropriate for the sensor. ZnO
powder synthesized with 0.5 M concentration had a low sensitivity, suggesting that
the material was not stuck to the surface correctly, possibly because of its shape and
size and the lack of available surfaces.
Figure 6 depicts the varied sensitivity as a function of per unit urea concentration
for the powder synthesized at 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 M concentrations. The sensitivity
decreases as the concentration increases, suggesting a decrease in the surface area
that is available for protein/enzyme adsorption.
Figure 7 shows a cycle testing for a week to check the variation in sensitivity of
sample and observed the excellent reproducible sensitivity with negligible loss of
3%.
The current-response time of the sensor at 0.3 M concentration was analyzed by
subjecting it to successive step changes in urea concentration, as shown in Fig. 8.
It was found that the sensor exhibited quickly and accurately sensitive response as
changes in the solution’s concentration. After approximately six seconds, a steady-
statecurrentof95%wasachieved.Thefastresponsesuggeststhattheporousstructure
of the ZnO matrix creates a low mass transport barrier, facilitating rapid diffusion of
the enzyme from solution and retaining its bioactivity.

and after urease immobilization, as presented in Fig. 9. The scan rate used was

any current peak related to the oxidation/reduction process. A typical electrochem-
ical response with an oxidative and reductive peak at about −640 and −780 mV,
respectively, was produced by the injection of 1 mM of urea. Urea concentration
was increased to 5 mM, resulting in the increasing the reduction current, which was
similar to the I-V characteristics shown in Fig. 4. These ﬁndings suggest that the
process is a reversible process as conﬁrming the interaction between urea and urease
during an enzymatic catalysis, which varies with applied potential. Based on the
results obtained from CV and cycle-to-cycle studies, it is established that the created
sensors can be used again. Nonetheless, it is crucial to conduct a thorough analysis
to examine the long-term stability.

In order to ascertain the selectivity of the developed sensor, the cross-sensitivity
after urease immobilization to different glucose concentrations from 10 to 200 mg/dl
in 10 ml of PBS (0.1 M, pH = 7.2) was studied. The response in PBS is same as that
of the average response of the glucose solution. This measurement clearly supports
that the urea can react catalytically with urease only and such types of sensors can
be selective in nature for a particular type of protein-enzyme (Fig. 10).

Expected Sensing Mechanism
Henry Windishmann, Peter, and Mark were some of the ﬁrst people to propose a
microscopic level model for how a CO sensor made of SnO2 works. According
to their explanation, the model explains how chemisorbed oxygen oxidizes CO on
the sensor surface and then releases an electron into the sensor’s conduction band.
Numerous studies have used this model to elucidate the change in the electrical
conductance of porous semiconducting thin or thick ﬁlm sensors in the presence of
toxic gases, resulting from the occurrence of the two reactions described below on
the surface [32, 33].
The initial step involves O2 molecules from atmosphere getting physically
adsorbed on the sensor surface. As they move around, they extract an electron from
the conduction band and become ionosorbed on the surface as O ads. The type of
ion (O−or O−
2 ) depends on the available energy. As a result of this process, the
conductance of the sensor decreases and the potential barrier at the grain boundaries
rises. This can be represented as;
O2 + 2e−→2O−
ads
(2)
The equation given in Eq. 1 shows that when urea-urease catalytic reaction occurs,
it leads to the formation of NH+
4 and CO−2
3 . The produced NH+
4 reacts with oxygen
adsorbed on electrode surface (O-ads) and at conduction band, it simultaneously
liberates the trapped electron in ZnO.
The second step involves the reaction of a reducing gas molecule (such as NH3
in this case) with the pre-adsorbed oxygen adsorbates that have a negative charge on
the surface. Consequently, the trapped electrons return to the material’s conduction
band. When the adsorbed ammonia molecules decompose, the energy released is
enough for the electrons to travel into the conduction band, leading to elevate the
conductivity of the sensor.

To recover RO, the sensor requires sufﬁcient recovery time or an increase in
temperature. A cyclic voltammetry test provides evidence for the sensing mechanism
described above, showing an oxidation and reduction process. The rate of the reaction
occurringontheimmobilizedsample’ssurfacedeterminesthesensor’sresponsetime.
The sensor’s performance may be improved by using an appropriate catalyst to split
the ammonia further, causing it to spill over onto the surface. This would increase the
reaction with adsorbed O2 on electrode surface, resulting in increased conductivity
and an improved response.
2.2
Corroboration of Enzyme Immobilization
To examine the urease immobilization on ZnO thick ﬁlm, XPS was employed to char-
acterize the surface-bonded states. Figure 11 presents the low-resolution spectra of
the N1s XPS peak before and after urease immobilization, showing the urease immo-
bilization on ZnO as a prominent N 1s peaks observed. This change that happened
after the urease was immobilized on ZnO, suggesting the formation of covalent
bonding.

In order to guarantee the biosensor’s stability throughout operation and storage,
two sets of samples were generated and measured regularly. Each sample was
measured ﬁve times, and an error of about ±2% was observed. After a week of storage
at room temperature in buffer solution (pH = 7.2), measurements were repeated to
conﬁrm the reliability, and the ﬁndings were within the error limits. To prevent vari-
ation in response due to different reaction or adsorption time, the applied voltage
was increased to the maximum value in 50 s for all samples.

Results Supported SnO2 Nanostructures Sensing Activity
3.1
Morphology of SnO2 Thin Films
The microstructure of SnO2 ﬁlm was examined by FESEM, and the results show
that the growth temperature affects its morphology, as displayed in Fig. 12a–d. It
is evident from Fig. 12a that there is no coating or scattered material inside or
outside the AAO pores. A layer of SnO2 grows and ﬁlls the AAO pores when the
growth temperature is raised to 400 °C. This growth happens by the accumulation of
vapor on the periphery of the underlying pores, gradually building up the walls and
extending the pore structure. The image in Fig. 12c shows the exact growth mode
when grown at 450 °C. The cross-section on top of the AAO pores clearly shows
the base of the inverted basket-like shape formed by the walls ﬁnally capping over
at this temperature. At top view (Fig. 12d), a spindle-shaped cap of around 300 nm
in length is visible.
The XRD results of SnO2 ﬁlms synthesized at various temperatures are consistent
with d-values of typical tetragonal rutile structure (JCPDS 41-1445). An enhance-
ment in the peak intensity and sharpness of the (110) plane is observed, indicating
an increase in the crystallinity with increasing deposition temperature. The ﬁndings
also suggest that the particles oriented along the [110] direction.

Glucose Oxidase Immobilization on SnO2 Thin Films
The I–V curves of a 350 °C-grown SnO2 ﬁlm both before and after GOx immo-
bilization are depicted in Fig. 13. These curves were obtained at different glucose
concentrations, i.e., 10, 200, 300, and 360 mg/dl and represent the average of ﬁve
curves. The error bars present in the curves indicate that there is a 3% error, which
can be attributed to the measurement error caused by contacts. The standard devia-
tion of the values before and after GOx immobilization was calculated from these
curves and is presented in Table I, demonstrating that the variation in the values is
relatively low.

Thecurrentshowsasteadyrisewiththeincreaseintheappliedvoltage.Thedashed
lines correspond to the response of the ﬁlm prior to immobilizing GOx, while the
continuous lines indicate the response after immobilization. There is a noticeable
increase in the sample current after immobilization, normally resulting in increasing
the electrical conductivity of the ﬁlm.
According to the following reactions below, enzyme glucose oxidase normally
hydrolyzes glucose as;
β-D-glucose + O2
β-D-Glucose
−−−−−−→D-glucono-δ-lactone + H2O2
D-glucono-δ-lactone →D-gluconate + H+
(4)
One unit of the enzyme glucose oxidase (GOx) is capable of oxidizing 1.0 micro-
mole of beta-D-glucose to D-gluconolactone and hydrogen peroxide per minute at
35 °C and pH 5.1. This oxidation leads to an oxygen uptake of 22.4 µl per minute.
D-gluconolactone reacts with an H+ ion to form D-gluconate. The H+ ion generated
during this reaction will cut down the adsorbed O2, either O−or O−
2 , depending on
the available energy, which will result in the release of an electron and an increase
in the ﬁlm conductivity.
The researchers created similar plots for growing the thick ﬁlms at 400 and 450 °C.
The slope of the curves (dI/dV), which is the measure of enzyme activity, was used
to create a graph showing the sensitivity of the enzyme to increasing glucose concen-
trations, which is presented in Fig. 14. These curves serve as a way to estimate the
sensitivity of the enzyme to glucose. The impact of glucose concentration and depo-
sition temperature can be seen in these curves, as an increase in enzyme activity was
observed for all samples as glucose concentration increased.
The relationship between the deposition temperature and the sensitivity per unit of
glucose concentration is shown in Fig. 15, indicating a consistent rise in sensitivity
with the increase in the deposition temperature. This trend could be linked to the
improved morphology, surface behavior, and crystallinity of the ﬁlm that was grown.
3.3
Proposed Sensing Mechanism
In 1979, Henry Windishmann and Mark Peter were some of the ﬁrst to propose
a microscopic model for the functioning of SnO2-based carbon monoxide (CO)
sensors. Their hypothesis is based on the idea that chemisorbed oxygen oxidizes
CO on the sensor surface, and then the chemisorbed species induce an electron
into the conduction band of the sensor. Many subsequent reports have used this
model to explain the changes in electrical conductance observed in highly porous
semiconducting thick or thin ﬁlm sensors in the presence of toxic gases, which occur
due to the two aforementioned reactions occurring on the surface [29–33].
The initial phase includes the physical adsorption of O2 from the atmosphere onto
surface sites. During their movement from one site to another, they become ionized

Equation 1 indicates that the reaction between GOx and glucose produces D-
gluconolactone and H2O2 while consuming O2. Additionally, D-gluconolactone
reacts with an H+ ion to generate D-gluconate. After that, the H+ ion interacts with
oxygen adsorbed on the surface (O-ads) to release a trapped electron into the SnO2
conduction band. Figure 16b provides a visual representation of this process.
During the second phase, the reduction (R) molecules (speciﬁcally, H2O2 in this
case) react with negatively charged oxygen adsorbates that were pre-adsorbed on
the surface. Trapped electrons are released by this reaction and return to the mate-
rial’s conduction band. The energy released during the decomposition of adsorbed
ammonia molecules is enough to cause electrons to move up into the conduction
band, resulting in an increase in the sensor’s conductivity.

The RO’s desorption is mainly determined by the recovery time or temperature
of the sensor. The reaction that takes place on the surface of the immobilized sample
is the rate-limiting step, which affects the sensor’s response time. The use of an
appropriate catalyst can further improve the sensor’s performance. The catalyst may
aid in breaking down H2O2 and spilling over onto the surface, promoting the reaction
with pre-adsorbed surface oxygen on the host material. This, in turn, increases the
conductance of the sensor and improves its response.

A SnO2 ﬁlm grown at 350 °C was selected as an example and examined for surface
bound states using XPS analysis in order to verify that GOx was immobilized on the
SnO2 thin ﬁlm. Figure 17 displays the ﬁlm’s narrow scan spectra both prior to and
during GOx immobilization. The N 1s peak in the spectra after GOx immobilization

with sensitivity levels varying by ±3%. This variation might be explained by ﬂaws
in the experiment and measurement. The sensors are repeatable, as shown by the low
estimated standard deviation values in Table 1. For all sample, the applied voltage was
raised to its maximum value within 50 s to avoid the response differences brought on
by varying reaction or adsorption periods. However, the response time of the sensors
was not measured.

Summary and Future Directions
This study examines the potential use of a thick ﬁlm made from nanostructured zinc
oxide for room temperature urea sensing. Structural and elemental measurements
conﬁrmed that urease was covalently attached to the ZnO ﬁlm. The study demon-
strated the effectiveness of this organic–inorganic hybrid matrix for urea sensing,
with high sensitivity at lower urea concentrations (<10 mM). Saturation occurs at
urea concentrations above 50 mM. The study also found that structures with higher
surface area are better for biosensing. These results were reproducible, with a ±3%
variation in sensitivity values. The sensor has a wide detection range (1–100 mM or
6–600 mg/dl), and the responses were found to be reliable, reversible, and selective. It
is feasible to create a low-cost, lightweight, and power-efﬁcient portable instrument
by designing it with the right electronics. The methodology presented in this study
can be applied to other semiconducting oxide materials. In addition to zinc oxide
nanostructures, tin oxide thin ﬁlm nanostructures were used for glucose sensing.
These structures were grown in AAO pores using a plasma-enhanced CVD system
at deposition temperatures ranging from 350 to 450 °C. Urease was found to be
covalently attached to tin oxide. With rising glucose concentrations (up to 360 mg/
dl), a linear response was noted. The sensitivity was enhanced by the basket-like

(nano-sized) structure. The ﬁndings could be replicated with a ±3% ﬂuctuation in
the sensitivity levels. This approach can be extended to other semiconducting oxide
materials as well as studied in a variety of nanostructured SnO2 materials. A better
sensitivity and linear response can be obtained by modifying the ﬁlm’s surface area,
structure, and conductance, among other material parameters.

Introduction
The recent advent of innovative solar device architectures has substantially advanced
photovoltaic technology. Due to a noticeable increase in efﬁciency over a minimal
period, along with cost-effectiveness and improved performance, perovskite-based
solar cell (SC) designs are emerging as the industry standard for third-generation
photovoltaics. Perovskite (PVSK) materials are considered strong candidates for
developing efﬁcient SCs due to their high absorption coefﬁcient, long diffusion

lengths of charge carriers, and tunable bandgap (Eg) [1, 2]. Among the different
PVSKs, the lead (Pb) halide-based perovskites have been the top contingent in
recent times. The efﬁciency of the PSC has improved considerably in a short span
of ten years, from ~3.81% in 2009 to ~25.5% in 2021 [3]. But, it also needs to be
mentioned that the toxicity of Pb2+ is a signiﬁcant obstacle to the widespread use
of Pb-based halide-PSC devices. Despite this, moisture and heat destabilization are
typical issues for lead halide PVSKs. Tin and germanium iodide PVSKs ABX3,
where B ~ (Sn, Ge) and X ~ (I, Cl, and Br) are potential possibilities while searching
for Pb-free halide-PSC materials. However, under ambient atmosphere metal halide
ions (Sn2+and Ge2+) get oxidized (Sn4+ and Ge4+), which leads to device instability
and degradation of open circuit voltage [4, 5]. And also, the hybrid PSCs has a shorter
lifespan than conventional SCs due to its rapid degradation [6]. In recent years, lead
(Pb)-free, Ge-based PVSKs have been the subject of numerous numerical and exper-
imental investigations, with a focus on their potential use in photovoltaic applica-
tions. CsGeI3 has intrinsic properties, such as its high ionic conductivity, which are
being assessed for its suitability as a material for SCs application [7]. Moreover, the
bandgaps in the germanium iodide PVSK group are reported only in CsGeI3, while
MAGeI3 and FAGeI3 have higher direct Eg, which is nearly about ~1.6 eV, ~1.9 eV
and ~2.2 eV, respectively [8]. The primary advantage of shorter Eg is that it can
generate higher number of carriers in the PVSK materials of the PSC device. Previ-
ously, in 2015, Krishnamoorthy et al. revealed using the Density Functional Theory
(DFT) calculations and experimental results that among Ge-based halide PVSKs
with a rhombohedral crystal structure, the all-inorganic CsGeI3 poses the highest
optical absorption coefﬁcient with desirable Eg and chemical stability (up to 350 °C)
[9]. CsGeI3 has been found to possess a substantial static dielectric constant and
signiﬁcant born-effective charges. These properties have the potential to decrease
the occurrence of charge carrier recombination, trapping, and scattering, thereby
reducing the presence of charged defects in CsGeI3 [10]. Moreover, Liu et al. have
theoretically investigated an effective method of Eg tuning of CsGeI3 (0.73–2.30 eV)
by introducing hydrostatic strain to improve cell performance [11]. In 2018, Chen
et al. for the ﬁrst time fabricated lead-free all-inorganic CsGeI3 quantum rod-based
SCs, which attained a PCE of ~4.92% under the AM1.5G solar spectrum [12].
The HTL and ETL play a substantial role in the improvement of the overall
performance parameters of the PSC. While the electrons are easily transported, the
hole transport is blocked in ETL. On the other hand, holes are transported and
electron transport is blocked through the HTLs. Owing to their improved stability
against humidity and thermal stability, dopant-free HTLs have been the primary
subject of extensive investigation nowadays. This pattern has been continued by the
evolution of OHTLs in conventional architectures during the past half decade [13–
15]. According to the current research, the main performance limiting conditions
in high-efﬁciency PSCs (n-i-p structure) are determined by charge transport char-
acteristics at the interface of PVSK/HTL [13]. The previous reports by Gelmetti
et al. showed that the recombination of h+ in the HTL and e−in the PVSK is
the major recombination loss mechanism in the n-i-p structured PSCs [16]. While
Glowienka et al. proposed that due to the chemical interaction between HTL and

PVSK, a “dead zone” gets produced in bulk with a high SRH recombination rate
[16]. Overall it can be concluded that the performance of the SC is highly inﬂu-
enced by the h+ conductivity (σh) and HTL morphology [17]. OHTLs have a number
of advantages over their inorganic counterparts, including a tunable Eg and energy
level, wider availability of materials, and comparatively easier and cheaper solu-
tion processibility, chemical synthesis and puriﬁcation [15]. In this work, we have
proposed and investigated the organic hole transfer layers (HTLs); such as Poly (3-
Hexylthiophene) (P3HT), 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis [N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl) amino]-9,9′-
spirobiﬂuorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT: PSS), and poly [bis(4-phenyl) (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl) amine]
(PTAA). As the previous work also conﬁrmed that with excellent hole mobility (μp)
and stability, P3HT is a widely used as OHTL in the organic–inorganic PSCs [7]. The
polymer utilized is a dopant-free OHTL, which turns it a viable contender for stable
PSCs [7]. In place of pristine P3HT, Zhang et al. introduced p-type doped P3HT
as an HTL in the PSCs and recorded a signiﬁcantly improved PCE [18, 19]. Simi-
larly, Jung et al. recently presented a halide (wide Eg)-based PSC exhibiting PCE of
~22.7% with P3HT by lowering the unwanted non-radiative charge recombination
at the interface of PVSK and P3HT [20]. It is known that 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N-di-
p-methoxyphenyl-amine) 9,9′-spirobiﬂuorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is a typical small
molecule OHTL used in the advanced PSCs and electronic devices. In addition to
its exceptional thermal stability, high σh, and interoperability with other material
layers used in device design, it has widened in popularity [21]. By co-doping Spiro-
OMeTAD with bis(triﬂuoromethane) sulfonamide lithium salt (Li-TFSI) and tris(2-
(1H-pyrazol-1-yl) pyridine) cobalt (III) (FK102) in SCs, Burschka et al. were able to
attain a PCE of ~7.2%. A relatively wide Eg (3.0 eV) and simple synthesis process
are also some of the key features of Spiro-OMeTAD for application in the PSCs. On
the other hand, PEDOT: PSS has emerged as a strong candidate for application in
SCs due to its improved mechanical ﬂexibility, suitable work function (5.0–5.2 eV),
enhanced thermal properties, and affordability [16, 22]. In 2013, for the ﬁrst time
PEDOT: PSS was utilized as a HTL in PSCs (p-i-n structure) by Wen and co-workers
and obtained an optimized PCE of ~3.9% [15]. Also, by spin coating of graphene
oxide (GO) solution on PEDOT: PSS surface, Luo et al. were able to eliminate super-
ﬂuous PSS elements that improved the wettability of the transport layer and reduced
charge carrier recombination at the interface [23]. However, the signiﬁcantly high
band offset between PVSK and PEDOT: PSS and the highly acidic solution results
in poor SC performance (low V oc and Jsc) [24, 25]. Furthermore, PTAA is among
the most popular polymers to be used as HTL for p-i-n structured PSCs because
of its superior electrical characteristics and chemical stability [14]. Since its incep-
tion, PTAA has continued to be a well-liked HTL option for SCs and is utilized in
several high-performing devices [16]. It has been reported that undoped PTAA has a
restricted PCE and FF of about ~17% and ~70%, respectively, for the n-i-p structured
PSCs [26]. In 2016, following 500 h of one sun exposure at ~85 °C, Saliba et al.
demonstrated that PSCs with PTAA as HTL with a PCE above 17% could keep over
than ~95% of the initial PCE [27]. Similar to Spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA has remained
a popular HTL in PSCs due to its high thermal stability, strong solubility in a variety

126
A. Das et al.
of organic solvents, reasonable hole mobility, and favorable energetic compatibility
with most PVSKs. But as PTAA has more stability, effectiveness and lower-cost in
ambient condition than Spiro-OMeTAD, it can be boosted for commercial applica-
tions [16, 26]. In [6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been used
as an ETL. Previously, Zheng et al. showed in their study that spray-coated PCBM
ETL can enhance the device’s overall performance by creating a rough surface that
further improves the light-trapping capability inside the ETL [28]. Appropriate band
alignment and band offset are needed at the perovskite/HTL and PVSK/ETL inter-
faces to get an improved V oc by enhancing the extraction of photogenerated charges
and reducing the recombination losses at the interfaces [29].
In this proposed work, we have theoretically modeled and simulated inorganic
non-lead CsGeI3-based PSC with OHTLs (P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS,
PTAA) and ETL (PCBM) to achieve improved photovoltaic characteristics of the
optimal device architecture of Glass/FTO/PCBM/CsGeI3/OHTL/Ag. The thickness
(t), acceptor doping density (NA), and bulk defect density (Nt) of the CsGeI3 layer
were further optimized, and the effects of shunt-series resistance and environmental
temperature were also studied in this paper. The study would be beneﬁcial for the
experimentalists to build a theoretical understanding of the optimized performance
parameters of CsGeI3-based PSC.
The paper is subdivided into the following sections: Sect. 2 deals with the math-
ematical framework and the simulation techniques adopted for the design of PSCs
with organic ETL and HTLs. In Sect. 3, we have discussed the results obtained
through this simulation-based investigation. We have summarized the key results of
this study in Sect. 4.

Device Modeling
We have employed the heterojunction structure of the PSC for our study, which is
displayed in Fig. 1a. The modeled architecture is a planar n-p-p structure with a
metal contact layer, Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) layer, and PCBM ([6]-phenyl-
C61-butyric acid methyl ester). Here PCBM is used as an ETL layer, CsGeI3 as the
absorber layer, and P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA as HTLs. Silver
(Ag) and FTO have work functions of ~4.7 eV and ~4.4 eV, respectively [32, 33].
Ag is implemented here for the back contact of the cell. Figure 1b reﬂects the energy
band alignment of different materials of the structure Glass/FTO/PCBM/CsGeI3/
HTL/Ag for different OHTLs.

Tables 1 and 2 list the properties and parameters of the layers for the simulation
that have been implemented in the SCAPS-1D, which are taken from the literature
and published works.
We also included the bulk and interface defect characteristics to simulate the
device, as shown in Table 3. We have assumed the defects are neutral in this simula-
tion. The bulk defect density (Nt) of the CsGeI3 layer is taken ﬁxed at 1.0 × 1015 cm−3
and 1.0 × 1014 cm−3 for HTL/ETL, and FTO respectively. The e−and h+ capture
cross section (σe and σh) are estimated to be 1.0 × 10–15 cm2. The Auger h+ and
e−capture coefﬁcients and radiative recombination of the charges are taken to be
1.0 × 10–29 cm3/s and 1.0 × 10–11 cm3/s respectively [34]. Our device contains two
interfacial layers (ILs), i.e., HTL/PVSK and PVSK/ETL. σe and σh are taken as 1.0
× 10–19 cm2 and Nt as 1.0 × 1011 cm−2 in the respective interfaces [35]. Series and
shunt resistances of 0.1 
 cm2 and 106 
 cm2 respectively are used during the simu-
lation of the cell. The suggested device is simulated under the AM 1.5G spectrum at
a power density of ~1000 W/m2 and a temperature of 300 K [36].

Results and Discussion
Our work comprises of a comparative examination of the photovoltaic performances
of CsGeI3-based PSCs with architecture FTO/ETL/CsGeI3/OHTL/Ag, and four
different OHTL combinations such as P3HT, PEDOT:PSS, Spiro-OMeTAD, and
PTTA with PCBM as ETL using SCAPS-1D. To analyze the different architectures
and to obtain the best architecture with the best performance, we have optimized the
PSCs by varying the thickness, NA and Nt of the absorber layer and by modulating
all the property parameters of the ETL and HTLs. In addition, working temperature,
series, and shunt resistances are also varied to determine the ideal performance for
each of the PSCs. Generation and recombination proﬁles are also discussed.
The overall performances of the studied PSCs are shown in Fig. 2. Figure 2a, b
show the Jsc, V oc and PCE, FF variation with different OHTL combinations. From
Fig. 2b, it is evident that the PTAA-based PSC shows better performance due to a
signiﬁcantly more promising energy band alignment and exhibits PCE of ~21.62%
with higher Jsc of ~24.73 mA/cm2, V oc of ~1.07 V and higher FF of ~81.67% in
comparison to the other PSCs. PEDOT:PSS-based PSC exhibits inferior performance
with a PCE of ~17.55%, Jsc of ~24.71 mA/cm2, V oc of ~1.06 V, and lower FF of
~66.37% in comparison to others. On the other hand, P3HT-based architecture exhibit
better performance with a PCE of ~20.84%, Jsc of ~24.72 mA/cm2, V oc of ~1.07 V,
and FF of ~80.66%. Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC shows a PCE of ~21.15% with Jsc
of ~24.72 mA/cm2, V oc of ~1.07 V, and FF of ~81.30%, respectively.

Analysis of the Energy Band (EB) Alignment of the PSCs
In order to extract the maximum possible PCE from PSCs, we need a careful inspec-
tion of the band alignment of the materials constituting the PSC architecture, as
alignment governs the efﬁciency of the process of charge transfer and charge recom-
bination at PVSK/HTL and PVSK/ETL interfaces [29]. A proper band alignment
must be achieved through the modeled heterojunction since the essential components
of the SC performance (Jsc and V oc) are immensely dependent on it. Figure 3a–d
depict the simulated energy band diagrams (EBD) of the studied heterojunction with
different HTLs, where Ec and Ev implies the energy level of conduction band (CB)
and Valence band (VB), respectively, and Fn and Fp are the respective quasi-Fermi
levels.
For efﬁcient charge carrier extraction, the electron afﬁnity of ETL should be
greater than that of the PVSK, and the opposite holds for HTL [30]. In addition to
that, CB of ETL and VB of HTL should lie below and above the respective bands of
the PVSK to ensure effective charge transport [31]. As shown in the given equations
below, the disparity between the electron afﬁnity of the PVSK layer and the transport
layers leads to CB and VB offsets (CBO and VBO) [43].

and transport layers (HTL and ETL), Ec is the energy offset due to the conduction
band, and Ev is the energy offset due to the valence band. For efﬁcient charge
carrier mobility without recombination, CBO and VBO are important factors. A
signiﬁcantly high band offset leads to device degradation (poor V oc and FF) by
increasing the interface charge recombination [18]. For positive and negative band
offset energy values, energy cliff and energy spike are formed at the PVSK/charge
transport layer interface [43]. The junction’s built-in potential (Vbi) is restricted by an
energy cliff, resulting in a reduced V oc. And also, the transmission of photogenerated
charges (e−and h+) approaching the respective electrodes is not hindered by the cliff,
and results in an almost constant Jsc in the device [44, 45]. However, the energy spike
might behave like an energy barrier and impede the charge ﬂow [46, 47]. The required
activation energy (Ea) for recombining e−and h+ of absorber layer and respective
transport layers could be represented by the equations [43].

Ea(absorber/ETL) = Ea(absorber) −|Ec|
(15)
Ea(HTL/absorber) = Ea(absorber) −|Ev|
(16)
When Ea < Eg(absorber), the interface recombination of the device increases signif-
icantly, which degenerates the V oc of the device. It can be observed from Fig. 4a–d,
that at the CsGeI3/PCBM interface, CBO and VBO of ~0.49 eV and ~0.88 eV,
respectively are obtained. At this interface, a low CBO is more appropriate (high Ea
for recombination) for e−diffusion towards the front electrode [48]. Following the
same argument, high VBO impedes h+ to ﬂow (low Ea for recombination) through
ETL toward the electrode. On the other side, at the HTL/CsGeI3 interface, for
different OHTLs (P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, PTAA), VBOs are reﬂected
as ~0.17 eV, ~0.19 eV, ~0.07 eV, and ~0.14 eV, respectively. Comparatively, lesser
VBO signiﬁes a smoother transport of h+ toward back contact through HTL, consid-
ering that the suitable range of VBO for the PSCs was calculated to be 0.0–0.2 eV
[43, 44].
3.2
The Collective Impact of Acceptor Density and Absorber
Layer Thickness
We have studied the impact of both the variations in thickness and NA of the absorber
layer on device performance, using the contour plots depicted in Figs. 4, 5, 6 and
7. CsGeI3 layer’s thickness and NA ranged from 0.40 to 2.20 μm and 1 × 1014 to
1 × 1019 cm−3, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a–d, Jsc is more responsive to the
thickness of the CsGeI3 layer than the doping density. The current density largely
depends on the charge diffusion length and surface recombination velocity [49]. The
short circuit current (Jsc) of the SC can be written as [49]:
Jsc = J0exp
qV −Eg
nkT

(17)
where Jsc and J0 are the short circuit current density and reverse saturation current
density of diode, respectively, n is the ideality factor, k signiﬁes the Boltzmann
constant, T reﬂects the operating temperature, V is the forward-bias voltage.
For the different OHTLs (P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, PTAA), a similar
trend is observed with a lower NA of 1 × 1014 to 1 × 1017 cm−3 and a minimum
thickness of ~1.4 μm, where the devices are able to generate a high Jsc. The increase
in the absorption of photons is the reason for the increase in Jsc as the thickness of
the PVSK layer increases [50]. But after a peak value of NA of 1 × 1017 cm−3, Jsc
started to decrease from ~24.9 to ~18.3 mA/cm2 due to considerably high e−and
h+ recombination in the bulk and surface. Alternatively, V oc improves signiﬁcantly
when the NA of the CsGeI3 layer is increased from ~8 × 1015 to ~1 × 1017 cm−3

with different OHTLs have followed a unique pattern and have given an optimized
V oc (~1.07 V) at NA of ~2 × 1016 cm−3 and a minimal thickness of ~1.6 μm. V oc of

coefﬁcient and carrier lifetimes of e−and h+. From Eq. (14), it can be shown that
the reverse saturation current drops as the carrier concentration rises, resulting in an
increase in V oc. But as high NA (here >1 × 1017 cm−3) leads to recombination losses

lower acceptor concentrations (1 × 1014 to 1 × 1016 cm−3), FF decreases as the

PTAA OHTLs depict respected FF of ~86.4, ~86.2, ~72.6, and ~86.5%. It can be
observed that SC architecture with PTAA reﬂects maximum FF (~86.5%). FF of a cell
depends on multiple essential parameters that are thickness, doping concentration,
series and shunt resistance, Jsc and V oc of the SC [31, 33, 36, 52]. The ﬁll factor (FF)

CsGeI3/PTAA/Ag) has achieved a champion PCE of ~22.1% at a doping density of
~2 × 1016 cm−3 and a thickness of 1.8 μm, as shown in Fig. 7c.
Optimized PCEs of ~21.5%, ~22.0%, ~17.9% are also achieved by the respec-
tive SCs with different OHTLs (P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS) (Fig. 7).
Following the contour of Jsc and V oc (Figs. 4 and 5), PCE also varies in a similar
manner with thickness and NA of the SC. However, this kind of behavior was well
expected, as from Eq. (23) it is evident that PCE is widely dependent on the Jsc
and V oc of the PSC. It can be concluded that with optimized CsGeI3-based PSCs of
different OHTLs, a high PCE (>20%) can be achieved, which are more acceptable
than inorganic HTLs.

Effect of Variation in Bulk Nt and Defect Energy Level
Bulk and interface defects which are mainly due to recombination losses and point
defects such as vacancies, interstitial defects, and Schottky and Frenkel defects,
signiﬁcantly affect the cell performance. The Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) recombi-
nation model can be used to describe the defect density of the PSC [42], and the
governing equations are as given below [42]:

where RSRH is the SRH recombination rate, p1 is the concentration of holes in the VB,
n1 is the density of electrons in trap states, ni is the intrinsic carrier concentration, TL
is referred as lattice temperature, ϑth is the thermal velocity of charge carriers, τn,p
are the carrier lifetime of e−and h+, Et represents the defect energy level. Perovskite
active layer with minimal defects depicts long diffusion lengths of charge carriers,
owing to the reduction of carrier recombination and defect states. The performance
instability of PSCs is closely related to the recombination processes assisted by the
trap states and has been modeled as trapping (Et) and recombination (ESRH) centers
[53]. Under various ambient conditions, Sargent and co-workers studied the forma-
tion energy of trap states of MAPbI3-based PSC and concluded that perovskites
produced in I−
3 -rich environments are more likely to contain a lot of profound elec-
trical traps [54]. In this study, we have revealed the cell performance as a function
of defect energy levels (−0.4 to 2.0 eV) and their respective defect densities (1 ×
1013 to 1 × 1019 cm−3). From Figs. 6, 7, 8 and 9, it is clear that as Nt increases from
the shallow level (−0.4 to 0.0 eV) to the deep level (0.4 to 1.2 eV), the performance
parameters of thePSCdeclinesigniﬁcantlyfor all thesimulateddeviceconﬁgurations

Jsc reduces from ~22.6 to ~5.8 mA/cm2 and ~24.7 to ~9.8 mA/cm2 for the cells

increasing Nt from 1 × 1015 cm−3 to 1 × 1019 cm−3 in the deep level (Fig. 8a–d). V oc
also declines from 1.05 V to 0.97 V (P3HT) and ~1.07 to ~0.98 V (Spiro-OMeTAD,
PEDOT: PSS, PTAA) (Fig. 9a–d). Deep-level defects have higher formation energies

in Fig. 9a–d, the PCE of the devices remains unchanged for Nt < 1 × 1016 cm−3,
and after that drastically decreases with increasing Nt in the deep level. The device

increasing Nt (Fig. 9a).
Furthermore, SCs with Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA as OHTLs
depict a decline in PCE from ~21.7 to ~4.4% following a similar trend (Fig. 11b–d).

Effect of Temperature
The temperature is a very important parameter for the optimum function of the cell in
indoor and outdoor applications. The performance parameters of the device largely
depends on environmental and weather conditions. To investigate the inﬂuence of
operational temperature, in this study, it is varied from 280 to 360 K. From Fig. 12,
it is evident that the values of the SC parameters (V oc, FF, and PCE) decline with
increasing temperature except for the PCE and FF of the cell with PTAA as HTL. In
the case of PTAA, with enhancing temperature, FF increases from ~66 to ~68.4%,
and PCE remains constant (Figs. 12c and 13d). The open circuit voltage (V oc) of the
cell depends upon temperature as per the following thermodynamic approximation
[24].

where T0 and Ts are the solar cell temperature and temperature at the sun’s surface,
and 
i is the solid angle of the incident irradiance. Equation (20) justiﬁes the unstable
behaviour of the PSC at a high temperature. Accordingly, V oc, PCE, and FF of the cell
also degrade signiﬁcantly. On the other hand, from Fig. 12a, for the PSC structure
with P3HT as OHTL, the Jsc increases with increasing temperature up to 340 K
(~24.2 mA/cm2) and then declines and for remaining SCs, a small enhancement in Jsc
can be observed (from ~24.5 to ~24.6 mA/cm2). It might be due to the enhancement
in e−and h+ pair generation in the bulk semiconductor with increasing temperature
but because of the large recombination rate at a higher temperature (>340 K), Jsc
starts to decrease. Equation (17) also conﬁrms this behavior of Jsc with T(K).

Effect of Series Resistance (Rs) and Shunt Resistance
(Rsh) on the PSCs
Resistance has a considerable impact on the performance of a SC in determining the
current density and voltage characteristics (J-V). The series resistance (Rs) depends
on the electrical resistance associated with front and back contacts and shunt resis-
tance (Rsh) relies on the imperfections present in the cell due to poor fabrication
processes [56]. In an ideal solar cell, low Rs and high Rsh is desirable. Due to impu-
rities and degradation in the crystal and grain boundaries, J0 leakage current gets
increased, resulting in higher Rsh. By using the Shockley equation, the relationship
between Rs and Rsh with Jsc and V oc can be written as [57, 58],
Rs = Rs(contact) + Rs(bulk)

Here, Rs(contact) and Rs(bulk) represent the series resistances due to electrodes and bulk
material, Rs and Rsh are the series and shunt resistances, respectively, and Jph is the
photogenerated current density of the semiconductor. We have varied Rs from ~1 to
~6 Ω cm2 and Rsh is varied from ~10 to ~106 Ω cm2. Figure 13 depicts the variation
of PSC performance metrics with Rs as well as Rsh. From Fig. 13a, b, been observed
that for all four device conﬁgurations (P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PTAA, PEDOT: PSS
as OHTLs) Jsc and V oc show a constant behaviour, generally, they are not affected
due to Rs. On the other hand, V oc and Jsc increase up to 104 Ω cm2 before becoming
saturated and has negligible effect observed after Rsh value of 104 Ω cm2. In parallel,
PCE and FF quickly increases as Rsh increases, but after 104 Ω cm2 both PCE and
FF become constant and drastically decreases with increasing Rs. The highest PCE
of ~21.5% (PTAA) is achieved at Rsh of 104 Ω cm2. So, for high-efﬁciency, low Rs
of 1 Ω cm2 and high Rsh of 104 Ω cm2 are ideal conditions. Rs originates mostly
due to diode contact, and top of the contact layer resistance. It is reported that the

optimized growth rate of thin ﬁlm (absorber and transport layers) and effective self-
organization of molecules enhances the hole mobility in the system by reducing Rs
that further enhances the efﬁciency of the SC [59, 60]. And also, by changing the
absorber layer thickness, Rs can be tuned in the cell. By modifying the annealing
conditions, Ma et al. demonstrated enhancement in the crystallinity of the absorber
layer and decreased Rs values [59]. From this study, we can conclude that the lower
Rs and higher Rsh values are the ideal conditions for achieving high performance of
the cell.

Generation and Recombination Proﬁle of the Cell
Generation rate of a solar cell depends on the light penetration depth (x) in the
device and wavelength (λ) of the incident irradiation, and it is deﬁned as the number
of electrons and hole pairs formed at a region of the device due to the absorption
of light at a certain wavelength, with photon energy larger than the band gap of the
absorber layer and excitation energy of e−from VB to CB [61].
Equations (23) and (24) illustrate the quantum mechanical model of generation
rate in a semiconductor as mentioned below [62]
G = QE

where G is the generation rate of e−and h+ pairs, QE is the quantum efﬁciency, α is
the absorption coefﬁcient of materials, P1 (W/m2) represents the light intensity at a
depth of l μm in the material, P0 is the light intensity at the material surface, ℏω is the
incident photon energy, and x is the depth in the material. The generation proﬁle of
the simulated PSCs with P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, and PTAA has been
depicted in Fig. 14b. Near PCBM/CsGeI3 interface at ~1.8 μm (FTO/PCBM/CsGeI3/
P3HT/Ag) and at ~2 μm (FTO/PCBM/CsGeI3/OHTL (Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:
PSS, PTAA)/Ag) depth in the cells, higher generation rate up to 7.4 × 1021 cm−3 s−1

GstartstodeclineasonemovesfromETLtoHTLsideasthepenetratedlightintensity
drops exponentially. Generally, the photon is illuminated from the ETL side through
the FTO, which signiﬁcantly enhances photogeneration at the surface of the absorber
layer and ETL. Figure 14a represents the recombination rate in the device. Due to
recombination, the photogenerated electron and hole pair are likely to recombine
radiatively or non-radiatively, that is an electron fall from the conduction band to
the valence band [31, 63]. Also, recombination is affected by the carrier lifetime,
excess of minority carriers, and defect states present in the layer [64]. From the
ﬁgure, the higher recombination is observed in the region at 0.2 μm around the HTL/
PVSK interface and at 1.8 μm (P3HT) and ~2.0 μm (Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS,
PTAA) around ETL/PVSK interface. During the recombination process, the energy
is liberated at that point in the form of radiation or heat, which also inﬂuences the
recombination rate. Also, grain boundaries and deformation may lead to non-uniform
distribution of the recombination rate [65].

Quantum Efﬁciency (QE)-Wavelength and J–V Curve
of the Cell
The QE of a solar cell refers to the proportion of charge carriers generated to the
number of photons with a particular wavelength that impinges on the cell [33].
QE =
Jph/q
S(λ)/hν
(35)
Here, Jph is photogenerated current density, S(λ) is the optical power of incident
photons of wavelength (λ) and hv is the photon energy of corresponding photons. In
this study, the wavelength (λ) of the QE curve is changed from 300 to 800 nm
(Fig. 15a). The device structure with Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, PTAA as
OHTLs achieved an optimum QE of ~100% at a wavelength of ~360 nm, and P3HT
as OHTL depicts a comparatively lower QE of ~95% at the same wavelength. Thick-
ness is one of the main concerns when it comes to dealing with QE as with the
increasing CsGeI3 layer thickness, QE gets enhanced up to a certain point and then
degrades, as with increasing thickness the diffusion length of charge carriers also
rises and leads to high recombination losses and less Jph.
The device’s J-V curve is also represented in Fig. 15b. The ideal current–voltage
characteristics of the illuminated cell is given as [49]:
J = J0

(36)
Here, J0 represents the diode’s reverse saturation current density, Jsc is the short
circuit current density, V is the biasing voltage, and n is called the ideality factor. In
Fig. 15b, it is shown that a Jsc of ~24.1 mA/cm2 and V oc of ~1.07 V are attained with
FTO/PCBM/CsGeI3/P3HT/Ag PSC structure and a maximum Jsc of ~24.4 mA/cm2
and V oc of ~1.07 V are achieved by the optimum device conﬁgurations FTO/PCBM/

observed for the device with PEDOT: PSS as OHTL but a lower V oc (~1.01 V) is
reported. A rise in the absorber layer thickness enhances the number of photogener-
ated charge carriers to get an optimized Jsc. This attribute led to an improved PCE of
~21.63% (PTAA) in our simulated PSC, which is greater than previously documented
theoretical and experimental data, as listed in Table 4.

Conclusions
The extensive simulation approach of the CsGeI3-based PSC is performed with the
help of SCAPS-1D-simulation software. It is essential to highlight that all-inorganic
halide perovskites are feasible choices for PSC development. There must be a lot
more research work to be done on this type of Pb-free materialz, as it can boost
high levels of dependability, stability, and efﬁciency. This work comprises of an
investigation of Pb-free inorganic CsGeI3-based PSC with different OHTLs, and the
primary insights are as listed below.
1. The efﬁciency of Pb-free, inorganic CsGeI3 as a perovskite absorber with the
cell architecture (FTO/PCBM/CsGeI3/OHTL/Ag) with different OHTLs (P3HT,
Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT: PSS, PTAA) are evaluated with due consideration of
various photovoltaic parameters.
2. With these modeled structures, an optimized CsGeI3 layer thickness of ~1.8 μm
is obtained with different OHTLs. The absorber layer’s optimum properties
included an acceptor concentration (NA) of 9 × 1017 cm−3 and a bulk defect
density (Nt) of 1 × 1014 cm−3.

3. The PSC’s behavior is also studied in relation to the operating temperature,
Rs, and Rsh. The generation and recombination charateristics of the cell are
also examined here. For the purpose of cell validation, SCAPS-1D is also used
to replicate the J–V and Q-E plots as there have been no earlier studies on the
design of a CsGeI3-based cell using OHTLs (P3HT, Spiro-OMeTAD, PEDOT:
PSS, PTAA) and ETL (PCBM).
4. The best planar structure (FTO/PCBM/CsGeI3/PTAA/Ag) with optimal absorber
layer thickness yields an optimum Jsc of ~24.7 mA/cm2, V oc of ~1.07 V, FF of
~81.6%, and PCE of ~21.63%.
5. At last, it can be concluded that it is complicated to analyze all the possible combi-
nations experimentally; our simulation analysis aids in determining an appro-
priate ETL/CsGeI3/HTL structure which can act as reference for experimental
study of the CsGeI3-based PSC devices.

Introduction
1.1
Background on the Use of 2D Heterostructures in Solar
Cells
Solar cells play a crucial role in harnessing solar energy and converting it into
usable electricity. Traditional solar cell technologies, such as those based on silicon,
have made signiﬁcant progress in achieving high efﬁciency. However, there is a
growing need for alternative materials and approaches that can enhance efﬁciency,
reduce costs, and offer new functionalities. This has led to the emergence of 2D
heterostructures as promising candidates for next-generation solar cells [1–4].
2D heterostructures consist of atomically thin layers of different 2D materials
stacked on top of each other, creating unique electronic and optical properties. The
ﬁeld of 2D materials has witnessed rapid growth, with graphene, transition metal
dichalcogenides (TMDs), and black phosphorus being notable examples [2, 4–8].
These materials exhibit exceptional properties such as high carrier mobility, tunable
bandgaps, and strong light-matter interactions, making them ideal components for
solar energy conversion [9, 10]. The integration of 2D heterostructures into solar cells
offers several advantages [11–13]. One of the key beneﬁts is the ability to engineer the
bandgap by combining different 2D materials, enabling better absorption of sunlight
across a wider range of wavelengths [14]. This tunability allows for the optimization
of solar cell efﬁciency and performance for speciﬁc applications. Additionally, the

high carrier mobility of 2D materials facilitates efﬁcient charge transport, minimizing
losses and improving overall device performance [2, 9]. Another advantage of 2D
heterostructures is their strong light-matter interaction. The atomically thin layers
enable efﬁcient light absorption and facilitate charge separation at the interfaces
[14–16]. This property is particularly beneﬁcial for thin-ﬁlm solar cells, where light
trapping and absorption are critical to maximize energy conversion. Furthermore,
the ﬂexibility and scalability of 2D heterostructures provide opportunities for novel
device designs and manufacturing processes. These materials can be synthesized or
grown on various substrates, including ﬂexible and transparent substrates, opening
up possibilities for ﬂexible solar cells and integrated solar panels in a wide range of
applications [17].
Despite the promising prospects, there are challenges associated with imple-
menting 2D heterostructures in solar cells. Interface engineering between different
2D materials is crucial to optimize charge separation and transport [18, 19]. Stability
and degradation issues need to be addressed to ensure the long-term performance and
durability of 2D heterostructure-based solar cells [20]. Additionally, scalable fabrica-
tion methods and cost-effective manufacturing processes are essential for large-scale
production and commercial viability.
Overall, 2D heterostructures have emerged as promising materials for solar cells,
offering tunable bandgaps, high carrier mobility, strong light-matter interactions, and
scalability. The utilization of 2D heterostructures in solar cell technologies holds the
potential to revolutionize the ﬁeld by enabling higher efﬁciency, improved ﬂexibility,
and new functionalities, paving the way toward a sustainable and clean energy future.
1.2
Signiﬁcance of 2D Materials and Their Unique
Properties for Solar Energy Conversion
2D materials exhibit tunable bandgaps, which can be adjusted by selecting appro-
priate materials and stacking them in heterostructures [5, 13, 21]. This allows for
precise control over the absorption of sunlight across a wide range of wavelengths.
By engineering the bandgap, 2D materials enable efﬁcient utilization of a broader
spectrum of solar radiation, enhancing the overall energy conversion efﬁciency of
solar cells. Further, these materials possess high carrier mobility [22], which refers
to the ease with which charge carriers (electrons or holes) can move through the
material. The high carrier mobility of 2D materials facilitates rapid charge transport,
reducing the likelihood of carrier recombination and energy losses within the solar
cell. This property enhances the charge collection efﬁciency and overall performance
of the device.
The atomically thin nature of 2D materials gives rise to strong light-matter inter-
actions [21]. These materials exhibit efﬁcient light absorption due to the high optical
absorption coefﬁcients and short absorption paths within the thin layers. Enhanced
light absorption leads to increased photon absorption rates and improved energy

conversion efﬁciency in solar cells. 2D materials offer ﬂexibility in terms of their
mechanical properties. They can be integrated onto ﬂexible substrates, enabling the
development of ﬂexible and lightweight solar cells [17, 23, 24]. Additionally, 2D
materials can be synthesized or grown through scalable processes, making them suit-
able for large-scale production [25, 26]. The scalability of 2D materials contributes to
their potential for cost-effective and commercially viable solar cell technologies. 2D
materials can be combined in heterostructures, where different layers are stacked to
create unique electronic properties and functionalities. This ﬂexibility in heterostruc-
ture design allows for the development of tailored solar cell architectures to optimize
light absorption, charge separation, and charge transport [26]. The ability to engineer
heterostructures using various combinations of 2D materials expands the possibilities
for designing solar cells with enhanced performance.
2D materials can be integrated with existing solar cell technologies, comple-
menting or improving their performance. For example, they can be incorporated as
charge transport layers, transparent conductive electrodes, or light-absorbing layers
[27–31]. The compatibility of 2D materials with other materials and device archi-
tectures provides opportunities for enhancing the efﬁciency and functionality of
conventional solar cell technologies.
The unique properties of 2D materials, such as tunable bandgaps, high carrier
mobility, strong light-matter interactions, and their ﬂexibility and scalability, make
them highly signiﬁcant for solar energy conversion. They offer the potential to
increase energy conversion efﬁciencies, enable ﬂexible and lightweight solar cells,
and facilitate the development of innovative device architectures. The utilization of
2D materials in solar cell technologies holds promise for advancing renewable energy
solutions and contributing to a sustainable future.

Fundamentals of 2D Materials and Heterostructures
2D materials are materials that have a thickness of just a few atomic layers, typically
ranging from one to several nanometers, while extending indeﬁnitely in the other
two dimensions. This results in a two-dimensional structure with unique properties
not observed in their bulk counterparts. Graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms
arranged in a hexagonal lattice, is the most well-known and extensively studied 2D
material[32].Otherexamplesincludetransitionmetaldichalcogenides(TMDs),such
asmolybdenumdisulﬁde(MoS2),tungstendiselenide(WSe2),andblackphosphorus.
2D materials exhibit exceptional mechanical properties due to their atomically
thin structure. They are extremely ﬂexible, strong, and possess high elastic moduli.
Further, this class of materials has unique electronic properties arising from quantum
conﬁnement effects. Graphene, for example, is a zero-bandgap material with high
electron mobility, while TMDs exhibit tunable bandgaps based on their layer thick-
ness, enabling control over their conductive and semiconducting properties. 2D mate-
rials exhibit strong light-matter interactions due to their atomically thin nature. They

156
U. K. Verma and A. Singh
have high optical absorption coefﬁcients over a wide range of wavelengths, making
them efﬁcient absorbers and emitters of light [16].
Heterostructures are formed by stacking different 2D materials on top of each
other, either in a controlled manner or by Van der Waals interactions, resulting in
unique electronic, optical, and mechanical properties. The stacking order, interlayer
coupling, and alignment of crystal structures signiﬁcantly impact the properties of the
heterostructures. Heterostructures allow the combination of materials with comple-
mentaryproperties,suchasgrapheneforhighelectronmobilityandTMDsfortunable
bandgaps, opening up new possibilities for device engineering.
Various techniques are employed to fabricate 2D materials and heterostructures,
including mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE), and solution-based methods [33, 34]. Mechanical exfolia-
tion involves manually peeling layers from a bulk material using adhesive tape,
resulting in high-quality single-layer or few-layer ﬂakes. CVD and MBE techniques
enable large-scale growth of 2D materials and heterostructures by depositing atoms
or molecules on a substrate under controlled conditions. Solution-based methods
utilize liquid-phase exfoliation or chemical synthesis to produce 2D materials in
solution, allowing for scalable production and integration into devices.
A range of characterization techniques is employed to analyze the properties of
2D materials and heterostructures, including scanning probe microscopy (SPM),
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence
spectroscopy, and electrical measurements. SPM techniques, such as atomic force
microscopy (AFM), enable imaging and mapping of the topography and mechan-
ical properties of 2D materials at the nanoscale [35]. TEM provides high-resolution
imaging of the atomic structure, layer stacking, and crystal defects in 2D materials
and heterostructures [36]. Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy
offer insights into the vibrational and optical properties of these materials [37]. Elec-
trical measurements allow for the characterization of electrical conductivity, carrier
mobility, and other electronic properties [38, 39].
2.1
Overview of 2D Materials: Graphene, Transition Metal
Dichalcogenides (TMDs), Black Phosphorus
Graphene is a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, often
referred to as the “wonder material.” It possesses remarkable properties, including
high electron mobility, excellent thermal conductivity, and exceptional mechanical
strength [32]. Graphene is a zero-bandgap material, which means it exhibits metallic
behavior and can conduct electricity with extremely low resistance. Its unique prop-
erties make it suitable for a wide range of applications, including electronics, energy
storage, sensors, and composite materials.
TMDs are a class of 2D materials that consist of a transition metal layer (e.g.,
molybdenum or tungsten) sandwiched between two chalcogen atoms (e.g., sulfur

7

or selenium). Examples of TMDs include molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2), tungsten
diselenide (WSe2), and tantalum diselenide (TaSe2). TMDs have a layered structure
with a direct bandgap in the monolayer form, making them suitable for optoelec-
tronic applications such as photodetectors and solar cells [40]. They exhibit strong
light-matter interactions, enabling efﬁcient light absorption and emission, and their
bandgaps can be tuned by adjusting the number of layers.
Black phosphorus, also known as phosphorene, is a 2D material composed of
phosphorus atoms arranged in a layered structure. It has a unique puckered structure
that gives rise to anisotropic properties, with different electronic and mechanical
behaviors along different crystal axes. Black phosphorus exhibits a direct bandgap,
making it suitable for electronic and optoelectronic applications [41]. Its bandgap
is tunable based on the number of layers, ranging from the visible to the near-
infrared spectrum. Black phosphorus has attracted attention for applications such as
transistors, photodetectors, solar cells, and thermoelectric devices [42].
Apart from graphene, TMDs, and black phosphorus, there are numerous other 2D
materials with distinctive properties [25]. Examples include hexagonal boron nitride
(h-BN), a wide-bandgap insulator with excellent thermal and chemical stability, and
transition metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2) and molybdenum oxide
(MoO3), which offer diverse electronic and optical properties. Other 2D materials
include silicene (2D silicon), germanene (2D germanium), and stanene (2D tin),
which share similarities with graphene in their honeycomb lattice structures.
These 2D materials exhibit a range of exceptional properties, allowing for innova-
tive applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy storage, sensors, and beyond.
Their diverse characteristics and the ability to combine them in heterostructures open
up new possibilities for designing advanced devices with tailored properties to meet
speciﬁc technological needs.
2.2
Electronic and Optical Properties of 2D Materials
and Their Relevance to Solar Cells
2.2.1
Electronic Properties
2D materials have unique band structures that govern their electronic behavior. The
bandgap is a crucial property for solar cells as the open circuit voltage depends
upon bandgap [43]. Different 2D materials exhibit varying bandgaps, ranging from
zero (as in graphene) to ﬁnite values (as in TMDs and black phosphorus). This
tunability allows for efﬁcient absorption of photons across a wide range of solar
wavelengths. 2D materials often possess high carrier mobility, enabling the rapid
movement of charge carriers (electrons or holes) through the material. High carrier
mobility reduces recombination losses and facilitates efﬁcient charge transport in
solar cells, leading to enhanced device performance and power conversion efﬁciency.
The reduced dimensionality of 2D materials results in quantum conﬁnement effects,

158
U. K. Verma and A. Singh
leading to discrete energy levels and enhanced electron-electron interactions. These
effects can inﬂuence the charge carrier dynamics and the optical properties of the
material, making them highly suitable for light absorption and charge separation in
solar cells.
2.2.2
Optical Properties
2D materials exhibit high absorption coefﬁcients over a wide range of wavelengths
due to their atomically thin nature and strong light-matter interactions [44, 45]. This
allows them to efﬁciently absorb incident photons, including both visible and near-
infrared light. Higher light absorption leads to increased generation of electron-hole
pairs, which is essential for efﬁcient solar energy conversion. The thin layers of
2D materials provide a high surface-to-volume ratio, leading to strong light-matter
interactions. This results in efﬁcient photon absorption enhanced light trapping, and
improved charge separation within the material. The unique optical properties of 2D
materials enable them to efﬁciently convert photons into electrical energy in solar
cells. Some 2D materials exhibit photoluminescence, where absorbed photons are
re-emitted as lower energy photons. This property can be utilized for light emission
or as a probe for studying the optical properties and carrier dynamics of the material.
In the context of solar cells, photoluminescence spectroscopy can provide insights
into the recombination processes and the quality of charge carrier extraction.
The electronic and optical properties of 2D materials make them well-suited for
various solar cell components and functionalities. 2D materials with appropriate
bandgaps can serve as light-absorbing layers to efﬁciently convert solar photons into
charge carriers. 2D materials with high carrier mobility can facilitate the transport
of charge carriers to the electrode interfaces, minimizing losses due to recombina-
tion. Stacking different 2D materials in heterostructures allows for band engineering,
creating favorable energy level alignments for efﬁcient charge separation and extrac-
tion. Some 2D materials, such as graphene, exhibit high electrical conductivity
and optical transparency, making them suitable for use as transparent conductive
electrodes in solar cells.
By leveraging the unique electronic and optical properties of 2D materials, solar
cell devices can be designed and optimized for improved light absorption, charge
separation, and overall energy conversion efﬁciency.

devices with enhanced performance. Here’s an overview of fabrication techniques
and characteristics of 2D heterostructures.
2.3.1
Fabrication Techniques
Mechanical Stacking/Transfer Method
This technique involves manually stacking individual 2D material layers onto each
other [46]. It typically starts with exfoliating or synthesizing the desired 2D materials,
followed by careful alignment and transfer onto a target substrate. This method allows
for precise control over the layer stacking sequence and offers ﬂexibility in choosing
different materials.
Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
CVD is a widely used technique for growing 2D materials and heterostructures.
It involves the chemical reaction of precursor gases on a substrate, leading to the
deposition of the desired material layers. By adjusting the growth parameters, such
as temperature, pressure, and precursor concentrations, it is possible to synthesize
heterostructures with controlled layer thicknesses and compositions [47, 48].
Vander Waals Epitaxy
Van der Waals epitaxy relies on the weak Van der Waals forces between 2D materials.
In this method, a 2D material layer is grown on a suitable substrate, and subsequent
2D layers are transferred onto it [49]. The lattice matching between the layers ensures
proper alignment and minimal interfacial defects.
2.3.2
Characteristics of 2D Heterostructures
Band Engineering
Combining different 2D materials in heterostructures allows for band engineering,
where the band structure and energy levels can be tailored. This enables control over
charge carrier behavior, bandgap engineering, and the creation of heterojunctions
with desirable properties for speciﬁc device applications.

Interlayer Coupling
The interaction between adjacent layers in a heterostructure plays a crucial role in
determining the overall electronic properties. Interlayer coupling can modify the
band structure, charge carrier mobility, and excitonic properties of the individual
layers, leading to new phenomena and enhanced device functionality.
Strain Engineering
Stacking 2D materials with different lattice constants can introduce strain in the
heterostructure. This strain affects the electronic structure, phonon properties, and
carrier transport. By carefully choosing the combination of materials, strain can be
utilized to tailor the electronic properties and enhance device performance.
Interface Effects
The interfaces between the stacked layers in a heterostructure play a vital role in deter-
mining the overall device behavior. Interfacial effects can inﬂuence charge transfer,
recombination dynamics, and excitonic properties. Optimizing the interfaces can
enhance charge separation, reduce recombination, and improve device efﬁciency.
The fabrication and characterization of 2D heterostructures require advanced tech-
niques such as scanning probe microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman
spectroscopy, and electrical measurements. These methods allow for the visualiza-
tion, analysis, and understanding of the structural, electronic, and optical properties
of the heterostructures. Overall, 2D heterostructures offer a platform for tailoring
and combining the properties of different 2D materials, opening up new avenues
for designing and engineering advanced devices with enhanced functionalities and
performance.

In this method, a seed layer of one 2D material is grown on the substrate, followed by

the transfer of subsequent layers onto the seed layer. The lattice matching between
the layers ensures proper alignment and minimizes defects at the interfaces. Van der
Waals epitaxy is especially suitable for heterostructures involving 2D materials with
similar lattice constants [49]. It allows for precise control over the layer stacking and
interface properties, making it an attractive strategy for designing high-quality 2D
heterostructures for solar cells.
In-situ growth refers to the direct growth of multiple 2D material layers on
a substrate without the need for transfer steps. This method enables the contin-
uous deposition of different materials in a controlled manner, creating well-deﬁned
heterostructures [50]. In-situ growth can be achieved using techniques such as chem-
ical vapor deposition(CVD) andmolecular beamepitaxy(MBE) [51–53]. Byvarying
the precursor gases and growth conditions, different 2D materials can be sequentially
grown on the substrate, leading to heterostructures with speciﬁc layer sequences. The
advantage of in-situ growth lies in the precise control over layer thickness, compo-
sition, and uniformity, allowing for the design of complex heterostructures tailored
for solar energy conversion.
Transfer printing involves the exfoliation or synthesis of 2D materials onto a
temporary substrate, followed by their transfer onto the target substrate to create
the heterostructure [54]. The process typically includes the use of adhesives or
stamping techniques to facilitate the transfer of individual 2D material layers. This
method offers ﬂexibility in choosing different materials and allows for layer-by-layer
assembly to design custom heterostructures. Transfer printing enables the integration
of 2D materials with different properties into a single device, combining the advan-
tages of each material for improved solar cell performance. However, the precise
alignment and control of layer stacking are critical challenges in transfer printing,
and defects at the interfaces may impact device performance.
Overall, these strategies provide distinct approaches to design 2D heterostruc-
tures for solar cells. Van der Waals epitaxy and in-situ growth offer direct methods of
layer growth, ensuring precise control over the heterostructure’s properties. Transfer
printing, on the other hand, provides the ﬂexibility to combine different 2D mate-
rials with speciﬁc functionalities, allowing for the creation of tailored heterostruc-
tures. The choice of fabrication method depends on the desired properties of the
heterostructure and the speciﬁc requirements of the solar cell application.
3.2
Interface Engineering and Band Alignment
Considerations in 2D Heterostructures
Interface engineering aims to minimize lattice mismatch between the stacked 2D
materials. Lattice mismatch can lead to defects and strain at the interface, which can
adversely affect charge transport and recombination processes [19, 55]. By choosing
materials with compatible lattice constants, the formation of high-quality interfaces
can be facilitated. The surface of 2D materials can contain dangling bonds and defects

that inﬂuence the electronic properties. Passivation and surface functionalization
techniquescanbeemployedtoreducesurfacestatesandimprovetheinterfacequality.
These methods involve the deposition of passivating layers or chemical groups on
the surface to stabilize the interface and minimize defect-induced recombination.
Interactions between adjacent layers in a heterostructure can lead to novel electronic
states and modiﬁcations in the band structure. Interface engineering can be used
to control the degree of interlayer coupling, inﬂuencing charge transfer rates and
excitonic properties. This ﬁne-tuning can enhance charge separation and reduce
recombination, resulting in improved device performance. Introducing controlled
dopants or interfacial charge transfer can modify the band alignment and energy
level alignment at the interface. This can be utilized to facilitate charge transfer and
improve charge carrier extraction from the heterostructure, enhancing the efﬁciency
of charge separation in solar cells.
Band alignment refers to the relative positions of the valence and conduction
bands between the different 2D materials at the interface [56]. Figure 1 represents
the band alignment at the heterostructure junction of Si/MoS2. The band offset can be
staggered or straddled, depending on the alignment of the energy levels. A staggered
band alignment results in a type-II heterojunction with a staggered bandgap, while a
straddling band alignment leads to a type-I heterojunction with a continuous bandgap
across the interface. Band offset at the interface can create a built-in electric ﬁeld
that inﬂuences charge carrier transport and separation. A staggered band alignment
can lead to an electric ﬁeld that promotes efﬁcient charge separation and collection,
making it advantageous for solar cells. Band alignment considerations are crucial for
achieving efﬁcient charge transfer and minimizing recombination at the interface.
Proper band alignment allows photogenerated carriers to be efﬁciently transferred
to the respective charge transport layers or electrodes, enhancing the overall device
performance.
Bycarefullyengineeringtheinterfacepropertiesandoptimizingbandalignmentin
2D heterostructures, researchers can tailor charge carrier dynamics, enhance charge
separation, and optimize solar cell efﬁciency. These considerations are essential for
developing high-performance solar cells based on 2D heterostructures.
3.3
Role of Strain Engineering and Defects in Optimizing
the Performance of 2D Heterostructure Solar Cells
Strain engineering and defects play important roles in optimizing the performance
of 2D heterostructure solar cells. These aspects inﬂuence the electronic and optical
properties of the heterostructures, which in turn impact the overall device efﬁciency.
Strain engineering can modify the band structure of 2D materials and heterostruc-
tures. Applying strain can alter the bandgap and energy levels, enabling better
matching with the solar spectrum and enhancing light absorption. This allows for efﬁ-
cient harvesting of a broader range of wavelengths, leading to improved photocurrent

generation in solar cells. Strain can inﬂuence the charge carrier mobility in 2D mate-
rials by modifying the electronic band structure and the scattering of charge carriers.
By carefully controlling strain, researchers can optimize carrier mobility, reducing
resistive losses and enhancing charge transport efﬁciency within the heterostruc-
ture [58]. Strain can create quantum conﬁnement effects in 2D materials, leading
to discrete energy levels and modiﬁed electronic states. This conﬁnement can affect

164
U. K. Verma and A. Singh
exciton dynamics and charge separation, contributing to improved charge carrier
generation and collection. Strain can induce local changes in the electronic and
optical properties of 2D materials, leading to stronger light-matter interactions. This
enhanced light absorption can boost the efﬁciency of solar cells by increasing the
number of absorbed photons and improving the generation of electron-hole pairs.
Defects at the interfaces or between stacked layers in heterostructures can affect
charge carrier recombination and transport [59]. Optimizing the interface quality
and reducing interlayer defects are crucial for minimizing recombination losses and
enhancing charge collection efﬁciency [60]. Controlled introduction of dopants or
defects in speciﬁc regions of the heterostructure can modify the band alignment
and charge carrier dynamics. Defect engineering allows researchers to tailor the
energy levels and charge transfer rates, contributing to improved charge separa-
tion and reduced recombination. Passivating defects involves ﬁlling or neutralizing
defect states, leading to reduced nonradiative recombination rates. Passivation can be
achieved through surface functionalization or by using speciﬁc materials to stabilize
defect sites, improving the overall device performance.
By strategically employing strain engineering and defect engineering, researchers
can optimize the electronic and optical properties of 2D heterostructures to enhance
the performance of solar cells. These techniques offer valuable approaches to tailor
charge carrier dynamics, improve light absorption, and reduce recombination losses,
ultimately leading to more efﬁcient and high-performance 2D heterostructure solar
cells.

Types of 2D Heterostructure Solar Cells
4.1
Graphene-Based Heterostructure Solar Cells: Principles
and Applications
Graphene-based heterostructure solar cells leverage the unique properties of
graphene and other 2D materials to enhance the efﬁciency and functionality of
solar energy conversion devices [40, 61]. These heterostructures combine different
materials with complementary characteristics to create improved interfaces, charge
separation, and light absorption capabilities.
Graphene, being a zero-bandgap material, has high carrier mobility, allowing efﬁ-
cient charge separation. When combined with other 2D materials that have tunable
bandgaps (e.g., transition metal dichalcogenides), charge carriers generated by light
absorption can be effectively separated at the graphene/2D material interface [45].
Graphene exhibits strong light-matter interactions across a broad spectrum due to
its atomically thin structure. By stacking graphene with 2D materials with suitable
bandgaps, the heterostructure can effectively absorb photons over a wide range of
wavelengths, leading to increased light absorption and photocurrent generation. The
stacking of graphene with other 2D materials allows for band alignment and interface

engineering. This strategic design optimizes charge transfer and reduces recombina-
tion at the interface, enhancing the efﬁciency of charge extraction and collection in
the solar cell. Graphene’s exceptional mechanical ﬂexibility and 2D nature enable the
integration of graphene-based heterostructures into ﬂexible solar cells and various
substrates. Moreover, the scalable fabrication processes of 2D materials contribute
to the feasibility of large-scale production of graphene-based solar cells.
Graphene-based heterostructures are particularly useful in thin-ﬁlm solar cells due
to their ability to efﬁciently trap and absorb light within the ultrathin layers [62]. The
combination of graphene with other 2D materials allows for effective light harvesting
and charge separation within the thin-ﬁlm structure. Graphene-based heterostruc-
tures can be integrated into tandem solar cells, where multiple layers of different 2D
materials with varied bandgaps are stacked. This conﬁguration enables the absorption
of different portions of the solar spectrum, leading to enhanced energy conversion
efﬁciency. Graphene’s exceptional electrical conductivity and transparency make
it an ideal candidate for transparent conductive electrodes in solar cells [63]. By
combining graphene with other materials to form a heterostructure, highly efﬁ-
cient and transparent electrodes can be achieved, enabling more light to reach the
active layer of the solar cell. Graphene-based heterostructures have been explored as
electron-transporting layers in hybrid perovskite solar cells [64]. The combination of
graphene’s excellent electrical properties and the unique optoelectronic properties of
perovskite materials offers the potential for efﬁcient charge transport and improved
device stability [65]. Graphene’s ﬂexibility and mechanical robustness make it an
attractive material for ﬂexible and wearable solar cells [66]. By designing graphene-
based heterostructures on ﬂexible substrates, solar cells can be integrated into various
applications, such as wearable electronics and portable power generation.
Graphene-based heterostructure solar cells hold great promise for enhancing
solar energy conversion efﬁciency, enabling ﬂexible and transparent devices, and
expanding the range of possible applications. As research in 2D materials and
heterostructures advances, these solar cells are expected to play a signiﬁcant role
in the future of renewable energy technology.
4.2
TMD-Based Heterostructure Solar Cells: Materials,
Interfaces, and Performance
Transition metal dichalcogenides, such as molybdenum disulﬁde (MoS2), tung-
sten diselenide (WSe2), and others, are the main materials used in TMD-based
heterostructure solar cells [40, 67]. These materials exhibit direct bandgaps in their
monolayer form, making them attractive candidates for efﬁcient light absorption
and charge carrier generation. Graphene is often incorporated as a supporting mate-
rial or charge transport layer in TMD-based heterostructures [40]. Its high carrier
mobility facilitates efﬁcient charge transport and collection, complementing the
light-absorbing properties of TMDs.

166
U. K. Verma and A. Singh
TMD-based heterostructures often exhibit a staggered band alignment at the inter-
face between the TMD and graphene [68, 69]. This type of band alignment creates
a built-in electric ﬁeld, which promotes efﬁcient charge separation and extraction.
The staggered band alignment is desirable for enhancing the performance of solar
cells. The interaction between the TMD and graphene layers inﬂuences charge carrier
dynamics. Interlayer coupling can lead to modiﬁed electronic properties and exci-
tonic effects, affecting charge separation and transport. Proper engineering of the
interlayer coupling is crucial for optimizing solar cell performance.
TMDs offer tunable bandgaps, which can be tailored for speciﬁc solar spectra. By
stacking different TMD layers with varying bandgaps, a TMD-based heterostruc-
ture can efﬁciently absorb a broader range of solar wavelengths, increasing light
harvesting and photocurrent generation [70]. The staggered band alignment and inter-
layer coupling in TMD-based heterostructures facilitate efﬁcient charge separation at
the interface [71, 72]. Photogenerated electrons and holes are effectively separated,
reducing recombination losses and enhancing charge carrier extraction. Graphene’s
high carrier mobility complements the properties of TMDs, facilitating rapid charge
transport and reducing resistive losses [71]. Efﬁcient charge transport is essential for
maintaining high device performance and maximizing power conversion efﬁciency.
TMD-based heterostructures can be integrated into ﬂexible and scalable device archi-
tectures. The 2D nature of TMDs and graphene allows for their incorporation into
various substrates andapplications, includingﬂexibleandwearablesolar cells. TMD-
based heterostructures can be integrated into tandem or multi-junction solar cells to
optimize light absorption and increase overall device efﬁciency. Stacking different
TMDs with distinct bandgaps allows for the efﬁcient utilization of a wider range of
solar energy.
TMD-based heterostructure solar cells hold great potential for advancing solar
energy conversion technology. Their tunable properties, efﬁcient charge separation,
and ﬂexible integration options make them attractive candidates for next-generation
solar cells with improved efﬁciency and performance. Ongoing research and opti-
mization efforts in TMD-based heterostructures are expected to further enhance their
capabilities and broaden their practical applications in renewable energy.

In addition to TMDs and graphene, other 2D materials, such as black phosphorus
and boron nitride, have also been explored in heterostructure solar cells. These mate-
rials bring unique properties to the heterostructures, contributing to improved light
absorption, charge separation, and overall device performance. Here’s an overview
of their roles in heterostructure solar cells

Black Phosphorus (Phosphorene)
Black phosphorus, also known as phosphorene, is a 2D material composed of phos-
phorus atoms arranged in a layered structure. Phosphorene has a tunable bandgap,
which can be adjusted based on the number of layers. This property allows for efﬁ-
cient light absorption across a wide range of solar wavelengths. Black phosphorus
exhibits high carrier mobility, making it suitable for charge transport and collection
within the heterostructure. Its unique properties have led to investigations of black
phosphorus-based heterostructures for solar cells to enhance light harvesting and
charge separation [41, 73].
4.3.2
Boron Nitride (h-BN)
Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is another important 2D material, known for its wide
bandgap and excellent thermal and chemical stability. h-BN serves as an ideal insu-
lating layer and passivation material in heterostructures. It can be used to minimize
interlayer defects and reduce recombination losses, improving the overall efﬁciency
of solar cells [74, 75]. In certain heterostructures, h-BN has been employed as a tunnel
barrier to enhance charge separation and collection between different 2D material
layers [74].
4.3.3
Transition Metal Oxides
Transition metal oxides, such as titanium dioxide (TiO2), have also been integrated
into heterostructure solar cells with other 2D materials [76, 77]. TiO2, for example,
can act as an electron acceptor layer, facilitating efﬁcient charge extraction and trans-
port from the active layer to the electrode [78]. The combination of 2D materials with
transition metal oxides allows for novel heterostructure designs and the optimization
of charge separation and collection.
4.3.4
Other 2D Semiconductors
Besides black phosphorus and boron nitride, several other 2D semiconductors, such
astungstendisulﬁde(WS2),tungstendiselenide(WSe2),andmolybdenumdiselenide
(MoSe2), have been studied in heterostructure solar cells [79–81]. These materials
offer tunable bandgaps and efﬁcient light absorption properties, making them suitable
for various solar cell applications.
The integration of different 2D materials in heterostructures allows for the design
of tailored solar cell architectures with enhanced performance. Researchers continue
to explore new combinations and conﬁgurations of 2D materials to improve light
harvesting, charge separation, and overall device efﬁciency in the quest for advanced
and efﬁcient solar energy conversion technologies.

Challenges and Considerations in Characterizing 2D
Heterostructures for Solar Cells
Characterizing 2D heterostructures for solar cells presents several unique challenges
and considerations due to the speciﬁc properties and structures of these materials.
These challenges can arise from the ultrathin nature of 2D materials, the need for
understanding interfacial properties, and the impact of measurement techniques on
the integrity of the heterostructure.
2D materials are typically atomically thin and delicate, making sample prepa-
ration and handling critical. Care must be taken to avoid contamination, damage,
or unintentional layer exfoliation during sample preparation and transfer processes.
The heterostructure’s stability can be affected by environmental conditions (e.g.,
humidity and temperature), so measurements should be performed in controlled
environments to ensure reproducibility and accuracy. Further, the interfaces between
different 2D materials play a crucial role in determining the heterostructure’s proper-
ties. Characterizing and understanding interfacial properties, such as band alignment
and defect states, are challenging but essential for optimizing device performance.
Traditional characterization techniques may have limited spatial resolution to probe
the interfaces at the nanoscale. Advanced techniques, such as high-resolution TEM
or scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), may be required.
The heterostructure’s mechanical strain and defect states can signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
ence its electronic and optical properties. Characterizing and quantifying these effects
are critical for understanding charge carrier dynamics and transport. Raman spec-
troscopyandotherstrain-sensitivetechniquescanprovidevaluableinformationabout
the strain distribution in 2D materials. Defect-sensitive techniques like electron spin
resonance (ESR) can be used to study defect states.
Some characterization techniques, such as TEM or focused ion beam (FIB)
imaging, require sample preparation and can be destructive to the heterostructure.
Non-destructive techniques are preferred to avoid altering the sample’s properties
during measurement. Non-destructive methods like Raman spectroscopy, PL spec-
troscopy, and ellipsometry can provide valuable information without damaging the

172

sample. Charge-carrier dynamics in 2D heterostructures can be understood using
time-resolved techniques. This requires ultrafast time resolution set-ups.
Despite these challenges, characterizing 2D heterostructures is essential for
advancing solar cell technology. It enables researchers to understand the fundamental
physics and tailor the materials’ properties to optimize device performance. Collab-
orative efforts and interdisciplinary approaches are often required to address these
challenges and make signiﬁcant advancements in 2D heterostructure characterization
for solar cells.

Potential for Scalability and Commercialization of 2D
Heterostructure Solar Cells
2D materials offer unique properties and performance advantages for solar energy
conversion. However, several factors inﬂuence their scalability and practical adoption
in commercial solar cell technologies. The scalable synthesis of high-quality 2D
materials remains a challenge. Developing cost-effective and large-scale production
methods is essential for commercialization. The cost of producing 2D materials
and heterostructures needs to be competitive with existing solar cell technologies
to make them economically viable. Commercial solar cells must be durable and
have a long operational lifetime. Ensuring the stability of 2D materials and their
interfaces in various environmental conditions is critical for commercialization. To
be commercially competitive, 2D heterostructure solar cells must demonstrate high
power conversion efﬁciency and comparable performance to existing commercial

is an ongoing focus of research.
Despite these challenges, researchers and industries are optimistic about the

Conclusions
8.1
Summary of the Key Findings and Contributions of 2D
Heterostructures in Solar Cells
2D heterostructures, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and graphene,
have tunable bandgaps and exceptional light-absorbing properties. By stacking
different 2D materials with complementary bandgaps, researchers have extended
the light absorption range, leading to improved energy harvesting from a broader
spectrum of solar radiation. The staggered band alignment and interlayer coupling in
2D heterostructures create a built-in electric ﬁeld at the interface, facilitating efﬁcient
charge separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs (excitons). This enhanced
charge separation minimizes recombination losses and boosts the overall device efﬁ-
ciency. Graphene, with its high carrier mobility, serves as an excellent charge trans-
port layer in 2D heterostructures. This facilitates rapid and efﬁcient charge carrier
transport, reducing resistive losses within the device.
Researchers have focused on engineering interfaces between different 2D mate-
rials to optimize charge transfer and minimize recombination. Interface engineering
has been vital for creating efﬁcient charge transfer pathways and improving charge
collection in the devices. Efforts have been made to develop scalable fabrication
techniques for large-area 2D heterostructure solar cells. Integration into ﬂexible and
transparent devices has opened new possibilities for practical applications, such as
wearable electronics and building-integrated photovoltaics. 2D heterostructures have
been integrated into tandem solar cells and hybrid solar cells to enhance efﬁciency by
combining their light-absorbing and charge-separating properties with other material
systems like perovskites and silicon.
Overall, 2D heterostructures have emerged as promising materials for enhancing
solar energy conversion technologies. Their unique properties, such as tunable
bandgaps, efﬁcient charge separation, and ﬂexible integration, have the potential
to revolutionize solar cells and contribute to sustainable energy solutions. While
challenges remain, ongoing research and advancements continue to pave the way for
the commercialization and broader adoption of 2D heterostructure-based solar cells.

Future Directions and Challenges for Further
Development and Optimization of 2D
Heterostructure-Based Solar Cells
The main focus will be on enhancing the power conversion efﬁciency of 2D
heterostructure solar cells. This includes exploring new 2D materials, interface engi-
neering techniques, and band alignment strategies to minimize losses and increase
charge carrier extraction. Ensuring the stability and long-term performance of 2D

heterostructure solar cells under different environmental conditions remains a chal-
lenge. Future research will seek to develop robust encapsulation techniques and
passivation strategies to enhance device stability. In order to commercialize 2D
heterostructure-based solar cells, scalable and cost-effective production methods
need to be developed. Large-area deposition techniques and roll-to-roll processing
are areas of active research to enable mass production. Further seamless integration
of 2D heterostructures with existing solar cell technologies will enhance the efﬁ-
ciency as well as the life time of the devices. This includes adapting manufacturing
processes to accommodate 2D materials and optimizing the device architecture for
tandem or hybrid conﬁgurations.
Ensuring the high-quality and uniformity of large-scale 2D heterostructures is a
challenge for scalable production. Defects and non-uniformities can impact device
performance. The complexities involved in engineering interfaces between different
2D materials can pose challenges in achieving precise control over charge transfer
and alignment. Some 2D materials may contain elements with potential toxicity
concerns. Researchers will need to carefully assess the environmental impact and
sustainability of 2D heterostructure solar cells.
Addressing these challenges and pursuing future research directions will be crit-
icalforunlockingthefullpotentialof2Dheterostructure-basedsolarcells.Collabora-
tions between academia, industry, and governments will play a vital role in advancing
this promising technology and accelerating its integration into mainstream solar
energy solutions.

Introduction
Urbanization stands as a major cause for natural resource depletion and high depen-
dence of the fossil fuels. As a result, consequences like global warming, pollution,
cost efﬁciency of fuels and other geographical factors have been signiﬁcantly inﬂu-
enced. Thus, there lies an urgent need of reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and
we need to develop alternate renewable energy sources that can cater our needs efﬁ-
ciently. Many of the conventional devices have already been undertaken in research
for energy storage e.g. batteries or capacitors or fuel cells [1–4]. But a new technology
which has emerged widely with an overpowering potential and the one which has
overcome the use of traditional devices is, “the supercapacitor”. Supercapacitor, the
name itself suggest its uniqueness and that uniqueness lies in its high-power density
and long-life span which makes it efﬁcient and viable usage in especially safe and
clean energy storage systems. They have adequate peak power with high power
efﬁciency. Wide usage of these supercapacitors owing to high-power delivery capa-
bilities and extended life cycle can be very well utilized in areas like automobiles,
memory back-up systems and portable electronics.
In comparison to capacitors, supercapacitors can exhibit large surface area elec-
trodes and have thin insulating materials so as to reach to the maximum capacitance
[5–9]. These peculiar, dynamic attributes give rise to greater energy densities in
comparison to conventional capacitors and increased power densities if compared
with batteries [1] as shown in Fig. 1. Their other extraordinary features include

fast charging/discharging speed, long-life cycle (irrespective of large charging and
discharging cycles an electrochemical stability is maintained without affecting the
capacitance), shelf life and high speciﬁc capacitance. These features undoubtedly
have captured the interest of the scientists worldwide to use supercapacitors in a
variety of signiﬁcant applications [10–14].
Energy being the primary focus and major concern of across the world demands
the adaptability of highly energy efﬁcient systems and devices like supercapacitors
which has the potential of facilitating advances in energy storage.

Overview: Conventional Capacitors Versus
Supercapacitors
Traditional supercapacitors constitute two conducting electrodes spaced by a non-
conductive substance or we can say a dielectric material. With the applied voltage,
charges of opposite nature starts growing on the electrode surface. Consequently,
an electric ﬁeld is generated due to charge separation by a dielectric resulting in
capacitive energy storage.
CapacitanceC, theratioof charge(Q) developedtotheappliedpotential difference
V is given by:
C = Q/V
(1)
A direct relationship exist between Capacitance (C) and the electrode surface area
(A) but varies indirectly with the distance d between the electrodes as:
C = ε0εr

where, ε0εr is a proportionality constant showing the product of free space
permittivity and the dielectric constant of the insulating material between the
electrodes.
There is a direct relationship of the capacitor’s stored energy E with the
capacitance given as:
E = 1
2CV2
(3)
Also, we know that the power P is the rate at which energy is utilised or used per
unit time. The measurement of power P for a capacitor in a circuit involves a capacitor
and an external load resistance R in series. An overall increased resistance arises due
to combined effect of internal components like electrodes, insulating material and
current collectors, which can be easily quantiﬁed by a measurement named as the
equivalent series resistance (ESR). Once these resistances are known, the discharge
voltage can be determined. When evaluated in terms of impedance (R = ESR), a
limit sets in for the utmost power of a capacitor [6, 9, 15] that can be very well seen
from Eq. (4):
Pmax =
V 2
4 × ESR
(4)
With respect to the electrochemical batteries and fuel cells which are also used as
energy conversion devices, the traditional capacitors exhibit extremely large power
densities, with lower energy densities. Consequently, the total energy stored by a
battery is comparatively higher than a capacitor but with a slow delivery rate due to
low power density. Energy stored per unit volume is comparatively less in capacitors
but simultaneously having enhanced power density giving rise to immense power
generation due to the discharge of stored electrical energy inside them.
The basic principles are same for both capacitors and supercapacitors but they can
be distinguished on the basis of the fact that electrodes in supercapacitors require
maximum surface area (A) and a thin layer of dielectrics i.e. there should be reduced
distance (d) between the electrodes for attaining higher capacitance [16], as shown
in Fig. 2. From Eqs. 2 and 3, we can visualize a very high capacitance and energy
of a supercapacitor. Power densities of supercapacitors can be quite a similar to the
traditional capacitors by maintaining the lower ESR characteristics.

Classiﬁcation of Supercapacitors
The energy storage mechanism forms the fundamental principle in case of superca-
pacitors showing complete dependence on the electrolytic ion distribution across
the surface area of electrode. Taking energy storage as the base mechanism,

186

supercapacitors can be categorized as: Electrochemical double-layer capacitors,
pseudocapacitors, and hybrid supercapacitors, as shown in Fig. 3.

3.1
Electric Double Layer Capacitor (EDLC)
EDLCs involves a combination of differently paired carbon-based materials which
acts as electrode, an electrolyte (an aqueous or an organic conductive liquid which can
driftinbetweenpositiveandnegativeelectrodesduringchargingordischarging)anda
separator (an ion-permeable insulating membrane placed between the two electrodes
avoiding the risk of short circuit). Charge storage in EDLCs can take place either
electrostatically or by a non-faradic process where [16–18] ions from the electrolyte
are physically adsorbed on the surface of electrode with no redox reactions [19].
Thus, EDLCs work on the energy storage principle of the electrochemical double
layer. Surface of the electrodes reveal accumulation of charges after applying voltage
to it. A potential difference is created, and opposite charges get attracted. As a result,
diffusion of ions from an electrolyte takes place across the separator and onto the
pores present on the oppositely charged electrode. Formation of double charge layer
prevents combining back ions at electrode. This double layer formation increases
surface area and minimized gaps in between electrodes giving rise to stronger storage
energy density [20] in EDLCs.
EDLCs unique storage mechanism builds up rapid energy absorption and delivery
with enhanced power performance. Absence of any chemical reaction for a non-
faradic process in EDLC results in minimal swelling when compared to the batteries
undergoing charging and discharging processes. Restricted energy density can arise
due to electrostatic charging mechanism on its surface or electrostatic charge accu-
mulation on the interface of high surface area carbon electrodes (porous carbon,
activated carbon, CNTs etc.) thereby limiting its energy and speciﬁc capacitance
[21]. EDLCs feature a storage mechanism that enables rapid energy absorption and
delivery, resulting in enhanced power performance.
3.1.1
Pseudocapacitors
As compared to EDLCs, the charge storage in pseudocapacitors can be understood
through Faradic process transferring electrical charges between an electrode and an
electrolyte [22]. In other words, energy storage via Faradic process shows reversible
redox reactions or intercalations [23].
When a potential is applied to a pseudo capacitor, redox reactions can be observed
through the electrode material due to which there is origin of Faradic current.
As a result, there is charge transfer through the double layer in a supercapacitor
cell. As compared to EDLCs, the Faradic process allows the pseudocapacitors for
gaining high speciﬁc capacitance and energy densities. Materials like metal oxides,
conducting polymers, etc., due to their Faradic nature can be very well utilised but
just like batteries redox reactions taking place can lead to reduced stability during
repetitive cycling and consequently a weaker power density [24–26].

188
M. Aggarwal et al.
3.1.2
Hybrid SCs
These devices exhibit binary electrode combination: one showing battery-type
Faradic charge storage mechanism and the other capacitive [14]. Electric Double
Layer Capacitors (EDLCs) feature outstanding cyclic stability showing large power
efﬁciency, while a larger speciﬁc capacitance can be valued for pseudocapacitors.
The hybrid system however uniﬁes the above-mentioned advantages i.e. holding the
energy storage capability of the battery-like electrode as well as the power delivery
of the capacitor-like electrode within a single cell [27, 28], as seen in Fig. 4.
It is researched that using various suitable electrode combinations, energy and
power densities can be substantially improved if somehow there is an increase in the
cell voltage.
In the recent past various combinations with both positive and negative electrodes
have been experimented from the researchers across the globe in either aqueous
or inorganic electrolytes. The use of Faradic electrode magniﬁes energy density
but with a reduced cyclic stability, and thus is a drawback of these hybrid devices
in comparison to EDLCs. In order to prevent conversion of a supercapacitor into
a battery like device [29], there is a need for balancing the factors affecting the
performance of these devices. Based on different electrode conﬁgurations hybrid
supercapacitors can be catogorised as (i) composite, (ii) asymmetric supercapacitors
(ASCs), and (iii) battery-type.

3.1.3
Composite Supercapacitors
Whenacarbon-basedmaterialispairedwithsomemetaloxideorconductingpolymer
in a single electrode, we get composite supercapacitors. By such kind of arrangement,
electrode can utilize charge storage mechanisms that can be both physical and chem-
ical. Proper and apt choice of carbon-based materials strengthens the capacitive dual-
layer of charges with increased speciﬁc surface area thereby improvising the interac-
tion between the pseudocapacitive materials and electrolyte. As a result, composite
electrodes [9, 15] with pseudocapacitive material shows increased capacitance due to
the Faradic reactions. The composites further can be classiﬁed as “binary” in which
an electrode can be constructed by utilising two distinct materials and the other is
“ternary” consisting of three different materials [16].
3.2
Battery-Type Supercapacitors
Battery-type is a combination of two different electrodes: battery electrode and super-
capacitor (SC) electrode. This kind of conﬁguration integrates high energy storage
of batteries along with rapid recharge capabilities of supercapacitors such that the
energy density and power performance of batteries and supercapacitors respectively
can be taken up in a single cell [16]. Few studies have been conducted on battery-type
hybrids [16, 31].
3.3
Asymmetric Hybrid Supercapacitors
The Faradic and non-Faradic processes when combined via interactions between
pseudo-capacitor electrodes with EDLCs gives rise to asymmetric hybrid capacitors
or supercapacitors. Here, a cathode uses a carbon material whereas an anode [15]
is either made of a conducting polymer or metal oxide. ASCs with two different
materials of electrodes is a current area of interest these days as they can provide
a wide range of operational voltage window. ASCs act as an interlinkage between
both batteries and supercapacitors [32, 33]. ASCs possess unique properties viz. they
are eco-friendly, maintenance cost being low, much of stable cyclability, exhibiting
a large range of operating temperatures etc. Thus, being hybrid of both EDLC and
pseudocapacitors, ASCs have been explored and various theories, explanations and
models have been put forward so as to develop the ﬁeld to a much larger extent. Lot
of attention has been put forward so as to increase the cycle life and creating high
energy. Their high performance and design have evolved them as the ﬁnest class
of SCs. ASCs have proved to be futuristic and demanding. These can therefore be
utilized in a variety of high-power applications and speciﬁcally their extensive use
in clean and green energy storage devices.
The current chapter therefore focusses on an extensive survey of variety of mate-
rials that can be used as electrodes in ASCs and also will give an overview over
various electrolytes that can be predominantly used.

Overview: Electrode Materials and Electrolytes
As mentioned earlier, the choice of choosing two unlike electrode materials for
cathode and anode gives rise to higher working voltage (V) which in turn is
responsible for higher energy density (E). The energy density (E) is given as:
E = 1
2CV2
Thus, the increase in energy density largely depends on the cell voltage (V) and
the speciﬁc capacitance (C). This operating voltage (OV) however depends largely
on what kind of electrolyte is being used. The right choice of electrolyte can thus
augment the performance of ASCs. This can be done in two ways: usage of either
an organic and ionic liquid-based electrolytes or an aqueous electrolyte. Though
the former is used commercially, exhibiting an electrochemical window ~3 V but
due to increased cost, poor conductivity i.e. having low energy density (below 5
Wh kg−1) [34] and so due to power density, low capacitance [35], high ﬂamma-
bility, easy short circuiting, non-ecofriendly they are usually replaced by an aqueous
electrolytes [36]. Inspite of exhibiting moderate electrochemical stability, mostly
the ASCs uses aqueous electrolyte because of their eco-friendly behaviour, high
ionic conductivity, high power density, non-inﬂammability, low cost, good safety
and convenient assembly in air.
Inherent properties like porosity, electrical conductivity, and chemical balance of
a variety of electrode materials can be regulated so as to maximize the speciﬁc capac-
itance. Many carbon constituting materials viz. graphene, CNTs, AC, GO, porous
carbon etc. owing to their larger surface areas can be chosen for negative (capaci-
tive) electrodes. On the other hand due to pseudocapacitive in nature, metal oxides,
carbonaceous materials and nitrides can be used for positive electrodes. Selecting
right choice of electrode materials helps studying a variety of applications across
various ﬁelds. Various researchers along with academicians have widely discovered
electrode materials for their successful use in fabricating various energy storage
devices.
Liu et al. [37] have designed the tenable electrodes with lesser amount and with
highperformancetakingahybridofNiCo2S4/carbonandporouscarbon.Asymmetric
supercapacitors with extremely large capacitance of ~783 C g−1/1569 C g−1 at 0.5
A g−1 and 78% capacity stability over 5000 cycles has been achieved. With an
operational voltage range of 1.6 V and acquiring appropriate energy and power
densities efﬁcient energy storage systems can be fabricated. This is an edge over many
other Ni–Co sulﬁde-based ASC devices. Jiang et al. [38] have concentrated their work
on MXenes, a prominent class of 2D materials with distinguished characteristics that
can be used in a variety of applications of areas of electrochemical energy storage. In
acidic electrolyte, Titanium carbide MXene (Ti3C2Tx) acts as cathode and ruthenium
oxide (RuO2) can serve as a positive electrode or anode. Symmetric MXene SCs
with an operating voltage ~0.6 V is almost half to the value for asymmetric MXene
supercapacitors operating at 1.5 V. The restricted voltage range of about 0.6 V in

8

191
case of symmetric MXene SCs is due to oxidation reactions at positive potentials.
On the other hand the value 1.5 V for symmetric MXene supercapacitors stands for
largest voltage range reported so far with about ~86% capacitive stability after 20,000
charge–discharge cycles, and hence so forth can easily substitute the carbon-based
materials in asymmetric energy storage devices. Oyedotun et al. [39] has reported
a combination of hydroxide of three metals nickel, cobalt, and manganese to form
NiCoMn–TH fused with activated expanded graphite (AEG) along with sulphur-
doped carbonized iron PANI (CFPeS) as electrodes resulting in an ASC. When
checked for the ﬂoating test it lasted for ~120 h, resulting in high energy and power
storage.
These remarkable ﬁndings led to an important consequence of utilising these
composite materials as high performing electrodes for various supercapacitor appli-
cations in different domains. Wu et al. [40] have explained the signiﬁcant role of tran-
sition MOs and carbon materials as electrodes. The typical transition MOs include
InO2, Bi2O3, Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and SnO2 and metal nitrides including TiV and VN as
negative electrode materials. The ASCs with two redox-type materials with distin-
guished reactions have mesmerized the researchers across the globe. Using MOs
have led to an increased overall performance of the devices. When differentiated
with traditional carbon containing materials, the above discussed combination of
pseudocapacitive type materials have paved the way for improved density and higher
capacitance but with reduced power density and elongated cycling stability due to
the sluggish redox kinetics.
Amiri et al. [41] have fabricated an ASC device using the MnCoP hollow
nanocubes and Activated Carbon (AC) as electrodes. This stands as an innovative
electrode material with extraordinary structural and compositional advantages along
with an excellent energy storage and power density. It shows a high cyclic perfor-
mance (~94.4% capacitive stability after 6000 cycles). Rajesh et al. [42] have fabri-
cated an ASC device utilizing the PEDOT nanostructure and PAC4 as electrodes in
1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte. The operating voltage for PEDOT//PAC4 device can be up
to ~1.8 V. By optimizing cathode and anode, the charge balance can be maintained
to the ratio of ~3.3 with total mass contribution of the active material ~7.3 mg in a
device. The constant degradation of polymeric materials due to continuous change
in charging/discharging cycles at higher voltages [43, 44] however puts a question
mark on the stability duration of the device in spite of operating the device at 1.8 V.
At 5 A g−1, the cyclic stability of the PEDOT//PAC4 device for 10,000 cycles shows
~55.8%, ~70.7%, and ~82% of capacitive stability for the operational voltage range
of 1.8, 1.6, and 1.4 V, respectively, most stable at 1.4 V. At 0.5 A g–1, peak speciﬁc
capacitance of 29 F g–1 is registered for these devices accompanied with maximum
speciﬁc energy and power capacity. Ghosh et al. [45] designed an ASC device, using
NCC2 and TRGO or thermally reduced graphene oxide as electrodes respectively.
For this, ﬁrstly carbon coated NiS2 composites were manufactured using one-step
hydrothermal process. The variable stoichiometric ratio of Ni, S and C precursor
can lead to formation of three distinct composites viz. NCC1, NCC2, and NCC3.
The particle size can be judged calculating the ratio of carbon precursor present to

192
M. Aggarwal et al.
that of metal sulphides. Increase in electrochemical properties of the supercapac-
itor electrodes depends largely on the metal sulphide carbon coating. Out of the
three composites mentioned, the particles were uniformly distributed in the NCC2
composite. With a high speciﬁc capacitance of ~184.9 F g−1 at 3 A g−1, speciﬁc
energy ~50.35 Wh Kg−1 and speciﬁc power of ~2.26 kW kg−1, the NCC2 composite
was considered as one of the ﬁnest electrode materials for storing energy. Even after
6000 charging/discharging cycles, it showed ~83% speciﬁc capacitance stability
indicating this composite to be more stable when compared to other composites.
Li et al. [46] have synthesized 3D Ti3C2 aerogel using simple EDA-assisted
self-assembly process. An ASC device has been fabricated using Ti3C2 aerogel
and electrospinning carbon nanoﬁber ﬁlm as electrodes. With a mass loading of
~15 mg at a scan rate of 2 mV s−1, the Ti3C2 aerogel not only exhibits high areal
capacitance of ~1012.5 mF cm−2 in 1 M KOH electrolyte but high-speed perfor-
mance and remarkable cycling resilience delivering large energy storage density
and a maximum power density. Wang et al. [47] have developed an ASC device
with MgCo2O4 MFs and activated carbon (AC) as two electrodes utilising three-
electrode system with electrolyte as 2 M of KOH aqueous solution. After calcination
treatment of the precursors at ~400 °C for 3 h in air, ﬂower like MgCo2O4 MFs
structures can be grown using a facile hydrothermal technique. MgCo2O4 MFs//
AC shows brilliant cyclic stability and capacitive stability after 5000 cycles at 5
A g−1. This low-cost synthesis method can further be helpful in preparing elec-
trode materials consisting of binary transitional metal oxides, which can enhance
our study and research vision for fabrication of various asymmetric supercapacitor
devices with high capacitance energy, power and superior rate property. Xing et al.
[48] have mentioned the construction of ASC devices using PCo0.21Ni0.79MoO4−2
as cathode and AC as anode. The P-Co0.21Ni0.79MoO4−n nanosheets are obtained by
using hydrothermal process of growing Co0.21Ni0.79MoO4 nanosheets on a conduc-
tive Ni foam and then using post annealing treatment, the nanosheets are doped
further with element P. Doping enhances the production of a number of electro-
chemically active reaction sites resulting in an increased reactivity of the surface
leading to high electrochemical performance. An ASC device PCo0.21Ni0.79MoO4−2/
/AC shows good cyclic stability and delivers relatively high energy density of ~49.2
Wh kg−1 at ~747.7 W kg−1 and ~12.5 Wh kg−1 at a power density of ~7479.1 W
kg−1 with 91% capacitive stability even after 5000 cycles. PCo0.21Ni0.79MoO4−2
can be considered as one of the suitable candidate for ASC devices showing high
performance.
Attias et al. [49] have successfully synthesized chemically prepared manganese
dioxide (CMD) and activated carbon as two electrodes for ASCs. The electrodes
show distinguished electrochemical properties which depends on the type of elec-
trolytic solutions used. Here, they have used 6 M KOH and 0.5 M K2SO4 as two
different types of solutions. The electrodes altogether with the electrolytic solu-
tions not only increases the speciﬁc capacitance but exhibits good electrochem-
ical stability with capacitive loss less than 15% after 7000 charge–discharge cycles
with considerable energy and power density. At a power density around 340 W/Kg,

8
Recent Advancements in Asymmetric Supercapacitors: A Review
193
KOH-based supercapacitors can deliver energy density of ~7.8 Wh/Kg and K2SO4-
based supercapacitors ~5 Wh/Kg at a power density ~440 W/Kg (electrodes weight).
These attributes along an easy going assembly, and with reduced cost makes CMD/
/AC supercapacitors suitable for their widespread use in constructing or fabricating
many energy-storage devices. Amiri et al. [50] have fabricated CuCo2V2O8//AC
asymmetric device using quaternary CuCo2V2O8 hollow spheres. Their fabrication
involves a two-step self-templating method wherein in the ﬁrst method, synthesis
of copper-cobalt-vanadate microspheres takes place through an exchange process
of anions between the glycerate and VO3– ions. With an annealing treatment in
the air, the second method involves Copper-cobalt-vanadate microspheres transfor-
mation to hollow spheres. These materials are chosen for making high yielding
electrodes due to their compositional and structural (highly porous) attributes. Its
superior high speciﬁc capacitance of ~799.8 C g−1 at ~2 A g−1, cyclic stability of
~96.5% and capacitive stability over 7000 cycles has proved to be a boon in fabrica-
tion of nanostructured quaternary metal vanadate electrode materials. Kandambeth
et al. [51] for the very ﬁrst time have manufactured Hex-Aza-COFs and RuO2 as
electrodes in ASCs. The generation of Hex-Aza-COFs involves formation of cova-
lent organic frameworks (COFs) with aza-fused π-conjugated system. By integrating
redox functionalities such as benzoquinone or phenazine and utilizing a solvothermal
condensation reaction with cyclohexanehexone, Hex-Aza-COFs can be synthesized
as Hex-Aza-COF-2 or Hex-Aza-COF-3. For Hex-Aza-COF-2, the speciﬁc capaci-
tance calculated is ~585 F g−1 and that for Hex-Aza-COF-3 it turns out to be ~663
F g−1 for a three-electrode conﬁguration which stands highest so far amongst all the
reported COF materials. Hex-Aza-COFs are combined with RuO2 so as to develop an
ASC device with an extremely high capacitive value. The individual potential ranges
of the electrode enables RuO2//Hex-Aza-COF-3 device to attain voltage window of
~1.7 V. At a current density of 1 A g−1, RuO2//Hex-Aza-COF-3 device exhibits a cell
capacitance of ~64 F g−1, energy storage density ~23.3 Wh kg−1 at a power density
of ~661.2 W kg−1.The results show that the COF materials can be chosen for its use
in various energy storage systems.
Feng et al. [52] have suggested the fabrication of HMNBs//AC as well as HTNBs/
/AC asymmetric supercapacitors wherein HMNB i.e., homogeneous nickel bicar-
bonate nanocrystals or HTNB i.e., heterogeneous nickel bicarbonate nanocrystals
act as anodic and activated carbon (AC) as cathodic material. Speciﬁc surface area
of HMNBs is large when compared to HTNBs thereby showing brilliant electro-
chemical performance as electroactive sites increases due to increased speciﬁc area.
These are also assembled in KOH (6 M) aqueous electrolyte. The performance rate
of HMNBs electrode materials is ~1560 F g−1 at 2 A g−1 and ~1350 F g−1 at ~30 A
g−1, respectively. HMNBs//AC possess high energy storage density ~41.2 Wh kg−1 at
160 W kg−1 and 28.9 Wh kg−1 at 4000 W kg−1, respectively in contrast to HTNBs/
/AC asymmetric supercapacitors. The cyclic stability is also more for HMNBs//
AC in comparison to HTNBs//AC. Gao et al. [53] have fabricated an asymmetric
supercapacitor by taking NiCoP@MoSe2 and AC as electrodes. In order to fabricate
high performance supercapacitors, ﬁrstly a 3D heterostructure of NiCoP@MoSe2 is
grown on a conductive carbon cloth substrate (CC). This allows the arrayed NiCoP
nanowires along with CC to ﬁrm tightly the MoSe2 nanosheets such that the number
of layers say 15 in MoSe2 gets reduced to quite a lesser number say 2–3 such that the
interplanar spacing shows an incremental change from 0.65 to 0.76 nm. As a result,

194
M. Aggarwal et al.
the electroactive sites become more exposed, electron transferring becomes easier
and more efﬁcient that increases the electrochemical performance tremendously.
NiCoP@MoSe2//AC fabricated ASC devices have remarkably great electrochem-
ical cyclic stability, delivering a high energy storage density ~55.1 Wh kg−1 at the
power storage ~799.8 W kg−1. This study can pave the new way out for understanding
various energy storage devices. Li et al. [54] have assembled an ASC utilising ZCS
NPs and activated carbon as the electrodes. ZCS or Zinc cobalt sulﬁde stands a
suitable supercharged electrode material with many exceptional properties of having
abundant active sites, highly conducting with numerous valence states. In their work,
they have mentioned two step formation of ﬁrstly, zinc cobalt oxide (ZCO) nanoparti-
cles through the hydrothermal method and then sulphuration process which involves
transformation to ZCS NPs or zinc cobalt sulﬁde nanoparticles which are coated
further onto a Nickel foam so that it can act as a working electrode in a supercapac-
itor. When compared to ZCO electrode (~295.8 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1), ZCS electrodes
have high speciﬁc capacitance of ~1269.1 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 in 2 M KOH electrolyte
contributing around four times more than ZCO. Thus, ZCS NPs//AC ASC devices can
deliver high energy storage density at a power storage of ~805.0 W kg−1. They show
an excellent capacitive stability over 5000 cycles. Wang et al. [55] have assembled in
their study ﬂexible solid-state ASC devices using metal silicates and activated carbon
as electrodes in PVA-KOH gel electrolyte. The metal silicates include MnSi, CoSi
and NiSi. They have reported ﬁrst the Stober method for the fabrication of hollow
nanosphere structured metal silicates followed by a hydrothermal treatment using
SiO2 sphere as a template. Owing to distinct porous properties along with formation
of hollow spheric nanostructure the above-mentioned metal silicates have proved to
exhibit high energy storage performance in supercapacitors. The ASC devices with
electrode materials as MnSi//AC, CoSi//AC and NiSi//AC can contribute capacity of
~1048.3, ~375.5 and ~120.9 F cm−2 respectively with corresponding high volumetric
energy densities of about ~4.6, ~2.6 and ~0.93 mWh cm−3 respectively. The excep-
tional results using metal silicates can lay a basis for further understanding of energy
storage devices with outstanding features. Askari et al. [56] have suggested the use
of both NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4/rGO as a supercapacitor electrode. Their synthesis
involves hydrothermal method. When compared to NiFe2O4, NiFe2O4/rGO shows
high capacitance ~584.63 F/g at the scan rate of 10 mV/s which is approximately
three fold greater. The high performance of NiFe2O4/rGO depends on the combined
effect of NiFe2O4 and rGO on each other, large surface area and much increased
electronic conduction shown by rGO. NiFe2O4 and NiFe2O4//rGO can both act as
incredible cathodic materials in large number of energy storage applications. The
latter showing high capacitive stability of about ~91% after 2000 CV cycles.

Introduction
Energy plays a crucial and centric role in our daily lives. There is always an ever-
increasing demand of this energy with an increase in the population. As a result,
there is more and more utilization of fossil fuels, so as to meet the required increasing
demands thereby affecting the climatic conditions due to subsequent release of green-
house gas emissions impacting the human health. Subsequently, we need to focus
and concentrate thus more on efﬁcient alternative sources of energy that are clean,
sustainable and environmentally friendly. Use of these alternatives can overcome our
dependency on the non-renewables and their threats thus diverting our pivot more
on the large-scale energy storage. Many such large storage energy mechanisms have
been widely used including use of batteries, ﬂywheels, compressed air, capacitors,
supercapacitors, pumped hydro, etc. [1]. Hydrogen now a days, the most likeable
contender, can be widely used as a clean-burning fuel for energy storage.

M. Aggarwal et al.
As compared to production of hydrogen from natural gas, its production during
electrolysis of water is more expensive. Alternately, inspite of taking into account the
burning of carbon-based fossil fuels, if somehow, we can utilize the energy obtained
from a renewable or nuclear power source for splitting water, then a subsequent
reduction in the emissions of carbon dioxide can majorly tackle the global warming,
thereby managing hydrogen economy (which means the principal energy carrier is
hydrogen itself) to the fullest. Hydrogen being an environmentally friendly, a clean
green source of energy has impressed numerous academicians and researchers and
is a source of attraction for those working towards green energy system.
The main focus, therefore lies on a better and more economical hydrogen develop-
ment which is currently an area of interest to many researchers, techies and scientists
these days. A sizeable and substantial amount of work has been taken up by a number
of researchers across the globe taking into account complete focus on a lightweight
storage so as to develop a compact energy carrier for mobile applications and to
explore a variety of materials for possible storage. However, hydrogen or molecular
hydrogen storage is associated with various mass and volume density issues which
thus becomes a hindrance to practical storage schemes. A substantial research work
has been brought up into notice by many academicians in ﬁnding out various ways of
molecular hydrogen absorption on solid storage material that can help resolve storage
problems. The absorbers include metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), nanostructured
carbons, CNTs and clathrate hydrate [2, 3]. The extraordinary physical and chem-
ical properties [2, 3] of carbon nanotubes stand as the best choice for storage of
hydrogen. Dillon et al. [3] have reported the use of pure SWCNTs at 133 K for
hydrogen adsorption capacity, lying between ~5 and 10 wt.%. Chambers et al. [4]
analysed at room temperature, the adsorption in excess of 11 weight% of H2 for
tubular and observed ~45 and ~67 wt% of H2 for platelet, and herringbone arrange-
ment of carbon nanoﬁbers respectively. Wan et al. [5] have very well described
the preparation of ZnO nanowires at room temperature through thermal evapora-
tion technique of metallic zinc concluding hydrogen storage capacity ~0.83 wt.%.
Their research work has completely increased the interest area of ﬁnding out more
intriguing H2-storage properties of ZnO by synthesizing various nanostructures using
solution method.
Recently, the introduction to Transition Metal Oxides (TMOs) has also signiﬁ-
cantly improved the absorption/desorption mechanics that is resulted due to enhanced
catalysis by transition metal ions or compounds, which have strong afﬁnity for
hydrogen [6–8]. TMOs being active catalysts enable hydrogen molecule dissociation
and hydrogen atom recombination back to molecular state. They show extraordi-
nary properties, viz. increased electrical/ionic conductivity, large reversible capacity
and high mechanical stability [9–11]. Some nanostructured TMOs, viz. TiO2, SnO2,
ZnO, Zn2V2O7 hierarchical nanostructures (HNs) and Nb3O7F hollow micro-ﬂowers
(HMFs) are good catalysts as they allow active segregation of hydrogen molecules
and vice versa, i.e. reuniﬁcation of hydrogen atoms back to molecules.
The following ways explain the hydrogen storage in different materials [12]:
(1) Liquefaction.

Hydrogen Storage Properties of Metal Oxides: A Review
203
(2) Compressed gas.
(3) Material-based or solid state.
However, the storage system is largely dependent on the type of materials and can
be classiﬁed as:
(a) Physical sorption (physisorption): e.g. porous materials
Due to the presence of weak van der Waals forces, it possesses weak binding energies
of about 4–10 kJ mol−1.
(b) Chemical sorption (chemisorption): e.g. metal hydrides [13–18]
Here, the complex or metal hydrides, possess very strong binding energies about
50–100 kJ mol−1. The process involves ﬁrstly the splitting or breaking up of H2
molecule on the material surface and secondly diffusion of hydrogen atoms takes
place on the metal host lattice [19].
The above two processes on comparison suggest that easy handling, reversibility
due to less of energy interaction and very quick adsorption/desorption kinetics
[20] occurs in case of physisorption process. Many porous materials like porous
carbon structures, zeolites, activated carbons, etc., exhibit hydrogen physisorp-
tion on the pore surfaces and the capacity of physisorption largely depends on
surface area, pore volume, operating pressure along with operating temperature.
For several physisorption-based materials, the maximum hydrogen capacity can
be seen at temperatures around 77 K and at high pressures, however, this drops
below 1 wt.% at atmospheric temperature and 50–100 bar pressure range [8]. Mate-
rials like SWCNTs, MWCNTs, covalent-organic frameworks (COFs) and metalor-
ganic frameworks (MOFs) also exhibit hydrogen storage via physisorption [21–28].
Amongst all mentioned above, maximum hydrogen storage occurs in CNTs through
physisorption. CNTs exhibit unique properties like dynamic nano-type conﬁguration,
large surface area and controllable characteristics with less mass density, promising
for reversible hydrogen storage media [1, 29–37].
To ensure high efﬁciency, a good hydrogen storage material must possess traits
like:
(1) Low dissociation and moderate operating temperature.
(2) Moderate pressure.
(3) Fast kinetics, i.e. for hydrogen storage, there should be fast adsorption and
desorption, reversibility, i.e. the materials used can absorb hydrogen and release
it several times without any deterioration or degeneration of materials used.
(4) Inexpensive and economical recycling.
(5) Minimal energy losses during charging/discharging of hydrogen.
(6) Maximum stability towards oxygen and moisture during long cycle life.
(7) Non-hazardous and safety considerations while operating as sometimes there
might be spontaneous combustion or any leakage of hydrogen.
In view of the above characteristics, much of our interest has been focused on the
role of metal oxides, which stands as potential candidates for hydrogen storage and

shows chemical reaction with hydrogen-forming metal hydrides. Developing metal
oxide-based hydrogen storage is the need of the hour as these types of materials
exhibit enhanced properties including a fast kinetics, very low operating tempera-
tures, magniﬁed reversibility or releasing hydrogen through reversing the chemical
reactions. These intriguing properties have made metal oxide-based hydrogen storage
systems more operational and usable in a variety of applications like energy storage
and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.

Hydrogen Storage: Use of Oxides
With a large variety of metal oxides and binary metal oxides are available, few are
of much relevance and importance so as to study the hydrogen storage properties.
Some of these are mentioned below.
2.1
Titanium Oxide (TiO2)
Titanium dioxide, TiO2, has its widespread use in interference ﬁlters, paints and
pigments, in optical coatings done on laser mirrors, etc. The major areas of its appli-
cations includes those in solar cells, photocatalysis, photo-electrochemistry and gas
sensors [38]. TiO2 recently has been used to develop various nanostructured shapes/
conﬁgurations, viz. nanotubes, nanorods, etc., so as to understand their importance in
renewable energy sources and also in hydrogen economy. One of the best examples
is by using the process of anodization wherein by taking up the Ti substrate, TiO2
nanotubes can be grown on it which can be utilized for storage of hydrogen [39].
Zhang et al. [40] studied a new and unique complex transition metal oxide,
TiVO3.5, wherein the precursor used is MXene (Ti0.5V0.5)3C2 solid solution. The
synthesis involved oxidation of the sample at 300 °C, so as to analyse its catalytic
performance for the hydrogen storage reaction of MgH2. It was examined that the
dehydrogenation onset temperature of MgH2 decreased from ~267 to ~197 °C as
soon as ~10 wt.% of TiVO3.5 is being added to it with an average fall of around
70 °C. As a result, hydrogen desorption took place in 10 min at ~250 °C for ~5.0
wt.% H2. At 100 °C, a faster hydrogenation kinetics (5 s) could be observed for the
dehydrogenated sample absorbing around ~3.9 wt.% H2. This reduced dehydrogena-
tion temperature could be understood using the addition of TiVO3.5 that decreased
the desorption activation energy considerably from ~153.5 to 62.4 kJ/mol without
altering the thermodynamic properties of MgH2. Later on XPS, results unveiled the
reduction of TiVO3.5 to metallic Ti and V because of the reducing nature of MgH2.
Ti and V being the real catalytic species facilitating the coupling and uncoupling of
H2 molecules thereby enhancing the MgH2 hydrogen storage ability more.
Lee et al. [41] observed the inﬂuence of TiO2 nanopowder on NaAlH4 as an effec-
tive catalyst. Earlier Ma et al. [42] and Jung et al. [43] have explained the enhanced

205
effect of TiO2 on the sorption kinetics of Na2LiAlH6 and MgH2, respectively. Sutti-
sawat et al. [44] have also reported the dehydrogenation kinetics of NaAlH4 consid-
ering the triggering effect of very small/micron-sized TiO2 powder. The results
revealed that the fact during the ﬁrst cycle TiO2/NaAlH4 desorbs around ~5.0 wt.%
hydrogen with an increased kinetics but gradually with further more cycles only ~3.5
wt.% hydrogen is desorbed implying a reduced hydrogen capacity. Lee et al. investi-
gated the catalysed effect of TiO2 powders on NaAlH4 using high-energy ball milling.
Inspite of TiO2 reduction by Al in NaAlH4, high stability of TiO2 is obtained even
after milling. Thermogravity indicates a higher release of hydrogen in case of inter-
action of NaAlH4 with micron as well as nano-sized TiO2 powders while a contrast
is seen during thermal decomposition process in NaAlH4 with TiCl3. The hydrogen
desorbed is around ~5.1 wt.% for NaAlH4 with TiO2 nanopowder. A poor kinetics
is noticed during hydrogen removal at ~150 °C for NaAlH4 with micron-sized TiO2
powder but an increased kinetics for NaAlH4 with TiO2 nanopowder if compared
to NaAlH4 with TiCl3. Besides this, there is an increased cyclic performance for
NaAlH4 withTiO2 nanopowder as comparedtoNaAH4 withTiCl3 showinghydrogen
desorbed during 1–3 cycles is approximately ~4.3–4.6 wt.% for 4 h.
2.2
Zinc Oxide (ZnO)
Zinc oxide or ZnO is II–VI semiconductor compound that exhibits a hexagonal
wurtzite crystal structure with a broad bandgap of ~3.37 eV and very high exciton
binding energy around ~60 meV at room temperature.
Amongst many metal oxide semiconductor nanostructures known so far, zinc
oxide is versatile, with a variety of its applications in various ﬁelds, viz. ﬁeld-effect
transistors (FET), ultra violet nanolasers, light emitting diodes (LED), photovoltaic
cells, electrical or acoustic devices, gas sensors, transparent conductors, etc., with
the most peculiar property of being a photonic material in the ultraviolet spectrum,
etc., and many more needs to be investigated [45–55]. A breakthrough after the
discovery of carbon nanotubes with discovery of nanobelts, ZnO nanospheres [56]
and many of the 1D nanostructures like Si [57] and GaN nanowires are a centre
of attraction for many researchers because of their unparallel distinct physical and
chemical properties. Out of many methods, thermal evaporation and hydrothermal
method have been used for the fabrication of variety of zinc oxide nanostructures such
as nanobelts, nanowires, nanonails, nanobridges, nanoribbons, nanorods, nanotubes,
whiskers, etc. [58–63].
The synthesis of nano-structured ZnO can be through any of the techniques
described: Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD), laser ablation, sputter deposition,
spray pyrolysis, ion beam-assisted deposition and template-assisted growth [64–69].
In terms of high yield and mass production of nanocrystals of metal oxides, synthesis
through chemical routes is the most convenient and easier.
A lot of research has been conducted particularly on 1D nanostructures like CNTs
for showing their extraordinary applications in hydrogen storage which is further

206

reported by many investigators. At ~900 °C, Yu et al. investigated evaporation of zinc
pellets [70] giving rise to a large assembly of 99.999% pure ZnO nanowires. The
SEMimageoftheas-grownsamplesofZnOrevealsrandomdistributionofnanowires
having uniform diameter around 20 nm. At ~3.03 MPa, the hydrogen storage capacity
of these nanowires is ~0.83wt% which increases linearly as the pressure increases,
thereby showing the relevance of the fact that more of the hydrogen can be stored at
pressures beyond ~3.03 MPa. Thus, reduction of pressure in the reaction chamber to
1 atm (1.013105 Pa) causes release of around ~71% of hydrogen.
Wahab et al. [71] have discussed the hydrogen storage properties of heterostruc-
tured ZnO nanostructures using a simple solution process at a very lower temperature
of 90 °C with a small reﬂuxing time. The morphological investigations conﬁrmed the
single crystalline structure of as-grown sample showing wurtzite hexagonal phase.
Various techniques, viz. XRD, TEM and FTIR demonstrated high crystallinity and
purity of as-grown samples.
The characterization of the given sample involved various techniques. FESEM
and TEM revealed the surface morphology of samples. FESEM as shown in Fig. 1,
revealed that with a change in the concentration level of the precursor, the structure
varies from belt to ﬂower and then to sheet-like structures. The broadness of each belt-
like structure is around ~50–100 nm with length ~7–8 µm. The ﬂower-like structures
so obtained when magniﬁed reveals the constitution of the ﬂower pattern which is
actually made of numerous pointed hexagonal shaped ZnO nanorods which originate
from the centre. These individual nanorods so obtained vary in diameters from ~150
to 200 nm and length ~2–4 µm. With a large wide hexagonal base and exhibiting
a sharp tip at the top, these nanorods have diameters ~70–80 nm. As precursor
concentration is further increased to 0.5 M sheet-like structures are obtained.
XRD conﬁrmed the crystallinity and crystal phase due to the presence of sharp,
intense peaks that matched in close agreement with the hexagonal zinc oxide as
shown in Fig. 2.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy investigated the composition of
the synthesized ZnO nanostructures in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 as shown in
Fig. 3.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) could conﬁrm the chemical composi-
tion and surface states. The different nanostructures (nanobelts, nanoﬂowers and
nanosheets) of ZnO thus obtained were analysed for their hydrogen absorption
capacities using conventional volumetric pressure-composition isothermal method
through an automated Sievert’s type Gas Reaction Controller apparatus, as shown in
Fig. 4. This takes place at a constant hydrogen pressure of ~20 atm (2.02 Mpa). The
different structures show different amounts of hydrogen absorption and the study is
continued for a longer period of time so as to check for any type of changes or any
fall in hydrogen absorption with time. The study shows that a steady state response
is obtained as hardly any variation with time in weight% is observed for the three
structures. The estimated hydrogen storage capacity comes out to be ~1.873 wt% for
belt-like structures, for sheet ~1.799 wt% and for ﬂower-like ~0.961 wt.%. These
variations arise due to the change in the surface area of the structures so formed.
Bigger the surface area of the structure more will be the adsorption/storage. Large

storage capacity in nanobelts when compared to nanosheets arises due to easy path
being provided by the former so that hydrogen can be diffused very well into the
interstitial cavities [72] as well as inter layers.
Thermogravimetric (TG) analysis helped explaining the chemical stability of
different materials with temperature. The temperature was varied from room to
~800 °C with a heating rate of 20 °C/min. The thermogravimetric analysis basi-
cally shows variation of mass loss with temperature as a function. The technique
describes very well the quantitative and qualitative analysis for numerous materials
over a broad range of temperature [73]. The technique depicts lesser weight loss for
the nanorods of zinc oxide micro-ﬂower than nanobelts of zinc oxide because of
nanorod surface area. It also draws the fact that the microstructure of nanosheets is
less sublimated and so capacity to adsorb H2 is quite less. Thus, the studies concluded
the structure-dependent storage capacities of as-grown zinc oxide nanostructures.
2.3
SnO2 Porous Microspheres
A n-type semiconductor SnO2 or tin dioxide, the most abundant oxide, non-toxic
and the stablest oxide of tin, with a broad bandgap ~3.6 eV, has interesting appli-
cations because of this bandgap which is tunable if doped with foreign elements

or nanostructured design. Tin dioxide is thermally, mechanically and chemically
stable. Due to its unique features and properties, it plays a major role in sustainable
development like energy harvesting and storage. These days this material has gained
importance for hydrogen storage. Some of the morphologies of tin dioxide nanos-
tructures currently under study include those of nanoparticles, nanorods, nanotubes,
multilayer structures and hollow structures [74, 75].
Vellingiri et al. [76] synthesized MWCNTs decorated with SnO2 using an easy
and a productive technique, viz. impregnation method. After this, heat treatment is
done at different temperatures ~300, ~350 and ~400 °C in air. Various techniques like
XRD, FTIR, Raman, XPS, FESEM/EDX and TGA were used to study the structure,
composition electronic or elemental), spectral, morphological and thermal stability
of as-grown samples of MWCNTs/SnO2. At about 5 bar pressure and ~100 °C, the
MWCNT/SnO2 nanocompositesareexaminedfortheirhydrogenadsorptioncapacity
when passed for about 15 and 30 min time. The use of Raman spectroscopy and ther-
mogravimetric analysis on the basis of the structural changes analysed the hydrogen
adsorption–desorption properties of the as-grown nanocomposites that take place

during formation of nanocomposites. The MWCNT/SnO2 nanocomposites show
enhanced property of hydrogen storage. These results due to the size, morphology
and MWCNT-SnO2 interaction depending signiﬁcantly on the heat treatment. The
nanocomposite heat treatment at 400 °C yields high capacity of hydrogen storage—
2.13 and ~2.62 wt% when hydrogen is passed for 15 and 30 min, respectively. Using
FESEM and EDAX, the MWCNT/SnO2 nanocomposites were examined for the
surface morphology and for the elemental composition. The oxidation states were
veriﬁed using XPS technique for the elements available on the surface, their binding
energies and the chemical constitution of the composites using a monochromatic
source. Their studies concluded that the hydrogen storage capability is more for
MWCNT/SnO2 composites as compared to MWCNTs at temperature of ~100 °C
and ~5 bar H2 pressure. At temperatures ~300 °C, ~350 °C and ~400 °C, hydrogen
is passed to MWCNT/SnO2 nanocomposite for 15 min resulting in storage capacity

of ~0.83, ~1.64 and ~2.13 wt%, respectively; however, for 30 min time, it turned
out to be ~0.61, ~1.97, and ~2.62 wt.%, respectively. Thus, the correlation existing
between MWCNT and SnO2 decides the adsorption/desorption of hydrogen in the
given nanocomposites.
The study of hollow SnO2 structures is intriguing due to their exclusive range of
applicationsviz.inphotovoltaics,inphotocatalysis,indeliveryofdruganditsrelease,
gas sensing and lithium-ion batteries [77]. Li et al. for the ﬁrst-time synthesized
ﬂower-like SnO2 porous microspheres using solvothermal synthesis. These when
self-assembled gave rise to the formation of distinct hollow nanospheres [78]. This
was conﬁrmed using SEM and the nanospheres so obtained were hollow, having
rough surface with diameter varying between 300 and 500 nm and wall composed
of uniform nanoparticles giving rise to porosity.
For a single microsphere, the TEM image shows the self-organization of
ﬂower-like SnO2 microsphere into a highly dense, distinct and organized hollow
nanospheres. Their wall shows transparency for an electron beam indicating the thin-
ness of the wall. At ~373 K and ~4 MPa pressure, the hydrogen storage capability in
one cycle was measured for the as-grown sample; the ﬁrst ~40 min witnessed a fast
increase in the hydrogen storage followed by an increase which grows very slowly
with time. For the ﬂower-like SnO2 microspheres, around 0.92 wt.% is the maximum
hydrogen storage capacity. Though the porosity and hollowness of these as-grown
microspheres results in larger number of defects but high hydrogen absorption results
for such types of structures.
2.4
Binary Metal Oxides
Binary means two, so here two metal elements which are different combine with
oxygen. Binary metal oxides show remarkable characteristics and can be used for
hydrogen storage due to their ability of adsorption and release of hydrogen gas
reversibility. Though many challenges have come across still researchers are contin-
uously working on optimization of the materials so as to further strengthen their
performance and make them viable for a clean, greener sustainable hydrogen storage.
Some of the binary metal oxides have been discussed below:
2.4.1
Zn2V2O7 HNs
The mixed oxides of vanadium show outstanding applications majorly in optical
and magnetic instruments, in catalysis, LIBs, as hydrogen storage materials [11] and
supercapacitors [79–81] due to their stacked structures and extraordinary kinetics.
Exploring these new vanadium-based TMO crystal structures may further expand
our vision and perspective in developing new energy storage devices.
Butt et al. [82] have reported their work on ZnV2O4 glomerulus nano/
microspheres for their hydrogen storage properties. The synthesis of these nano/

212
M. Aggarwal et al.
microspheres is economical and easy by using a template free route taking into
account common laboratory reagents that can be widely used for mass production.
The hydrogen absorption–desorption kinetics of ZnV2O4 spinel oxide can be very
well measured using an isovolumetric method. The use of XRD technique indicates
very sharp good quality peaks of ZnV2O4 spheres. The surface of the sample shows
appearance of nanospheres with ~450–500 nm diameter. The EDS analysis signiﬁes
the presence of zinc (Z), vanadium (V) and oxygen (O) as the elements with vari-
able ratios. The use of HRTEM and SAED characterization of the sample conﬁrmed
the interplanar distance in the sample. Also, the SAED characterization showed the
formation of concentric rings with a bright spot. For different temperatures, ZnV2O4
nano/microspheres were examined for the hydrogen absorption properties for the
ﬁrst time using the template-free route. ZnV2O4 for hydrogen storage stands as a
magniﬁcent material in 2D layered nanostructures. The maximum hydrogen absorp-
tion for these microspheres comes out to be ~1.74 wt.% and ~1.36 wt.% at ~573 K,
and ~473 K, respectively.
Khan et al. synthesized and reported a very simple, template-free and economical
technique [83] for the production of Zn2V2O7 HNs. Zn2V2O7 majorly used in white
LEDs is basically self-activated yellow light-emitting phosphor and is an important
anode material for LIBs [84]. In comparison to other materials [83], these show supe-
rior hydrogen storage properties. The FESEM images clearly indicate Zn2V2O7HNs
that are typical dense nanostructures resembling petal-like structures with diameter
varying from 50 to 65 nm and lengths about tens of microns. Their HRTEM image
validates for high crystalline nature. Also, the SAED pattern of these above-reported
HNs, conﬁrms their nanocrystalline nature by observing the rarely found concen-
tric ring-like formation in the pattern. At ~5 MPa, the measurements were taken
for storing hydrogen for two different temperatures: ~473 and ~573 K. The highest
hydrogen absorption capacity comes out to be ~ 1.21wt% and ~0.81 wt% at ~473 K
and ~573 K, respectively. At ~473 K, during the ﬁrst 12 min, ~85% hydrogen is
absorbed by the HNs and at ~573 K, around ~84.1% hydrogen was stored.
2.4.2
Hollow Nb3O7F Microﬂowers
Tanveer et al. synthesized Nb3O7F HMFs using a dual-step, simple, surfactant-
free hydrothermal route. Time-dependent experiments were carried out for Nb3O7F
HMFs and their formation could be explained using the Ostwald-ripening process
[85]. The synthesis of these microﬂowers using the hydrothermal approach took
place at ~160 °C for ~24 h and contained a hollow interior. These microﬂowers
constitute 1D hollow microrods which on re-assembly form 3D microﬂowers. From
SEM image, we can observe the average length and average internal diameter of the
HMF to be ~2.72 µm and ~509.5 nm. The maximum hydrogen storage value is ~0.79
wt.% and ~1.08 wt.% at ~373 K and ~473 K, respectively. The latter result could be
understood due to the presence of hollow hierarchical Nb3O7F structures.

Conclusions
In order to achieve sustainable energy goals, we need to pay attention to a viable
and eco-friendly energy storage system that can help meet us the current energy
demands without depletion of fossil fuels. This dependence on fossil fuels can
certainly be dispelled using alternate energy sources. Hydrogen can be considered
as one of the best energy storage systems and many materials can be utilized for
the same. The review focussed largely on the various kinds of oxides that can be
taken into account for the hydrogen storage systems. Even though the metal oxides
are promising enough, challenges still remain the development of efﬁcient hydrogen
storage systems. These challenges may include dependence on catalyst that can
increase the cost to the storage system, a slower and weak kinetics can affect their
use in several practical applications, sometimes there can be safety issues in storage
handling or transportation or there can be reactivity issues in formation of metal
hydrides, some metal oxides may require high operating temperatures, etc. So further
research is being still continued so as to explore new novel materials that can over-
come the above-said drawbacks so as to maximize their use in different applications.
There is a special need to show advances in the ﬁeld of hydrogen storage for a clean,
greener sustainable energy future.

Introduction
The photovoltaic effect was ﬁrst observed in the mid-nineteenth century by
Alexandre-Edmond Becquerel [1]. After nearly 100 years of this observation, the ﬁrst
modern solar cell based on silicon was invented by Russel Ohl [2]. In the beginning,
thin silicon wafers were used for the transformation of sunlight energy into electrical
power [3]. Modern photovoltaic technology is based on semiconductors that work
on the principle of electron–hole creation. There are two different layers (n-type and
p-type) in each cell, and when a sufﬁciently energized photon hits the junction of
these two layers, ejection of electron takes place and moves one layer to another.
This process results in the creation of an electron–hole pair and electrical power is
generated [4, 5]. There are numerous varieties of materials in modern-day photo-
voltaic solar cells mainly in the form of silicon (single, crystal, multi-crystalline,
and amorphous) [6–9]; Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) [10]; Copper Indium Gallium
Selenide (CIGS) [11] and Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) [12]. Considering the history
and development of solar cells, they may be characterized in three generations [13]
(as shown in Fig. 1).
Figure 2 shows the latest efﬁciency reported by various types of solar cells from
the last decade till date [14].
In the current scenario, most of the photovoltaic systems consist of Silicon (Si)
solar cells. They are providing cheaper electricity (depending upon the installation
area) compared to the other available options in the ﬁeld of electricity generation. In
the 1980s, several efforts were done for the improvement of conversion efﬁciency
of Si solar cells [15, 16]. The technology related to defect engineering at the edges

of semiconductors was developed in this period popularly known as the passivation
effect. The initial efforts for the passivation of the Si surface were performed using
SiOx insulating ﬁlms [17, 18]. Due to these defects, the recombination rate of elec-
trons and holes was a cause of concern for the efﬁcient application of Si solar cells.
The PERC (Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell) approach for the Si solar cells also
emerged in this period, till date this technology has a ﬁrm hold on the production of

Graphene Quantum Dots-Based Heterojunction Solar Cells

high-performance Si solar cells [19]. A parallel but different technology for high-
performance Si solar cells came into the picture known as heterojunction (HJ) solar
cells. Before the 1980s, we do not have evidence for amorphous or crystalline silicon
heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell. In 1972, rectifying characteristics of a-Si/c-Si hetero-
junction were observed by Jayadevaiah and his co-workers [20]. Broadsky et al. [21]
reported the hopping conduction in a-Si/c-Si heterojunction for a level near the fermi
level of a-Si. The recommended a-Si ﬁlms for these heterojunction structures were
unhydrogenated. The demerit of this suggested heterostructure is the presence of
a huge number of localized states in the a-Si ﬁlms, such drawback needed to be
addressed for the potential application of these heterostructures as semiconductors.
The ﬁrst attempt at hydrogenated a-Si/c-Si heterostructures was done by Fuhs et al.
[22]. They tried the combination of c-Si and a-Si:H for heterojunction solar cells
however, they failed to obtain satisfactory cell efﬁciencies. In 1983, Hamakawa and
his co-workers [23] reported a tandem solar cell consisting of a-Si:H cells and a-Si:H
polycrystalline SHJ solar cells. This was the ﬁrst successful attempt in the develop-
ment of SHJ. Later on, Furukawa et al. [24] suggested a-SiC:H/c-Si HJ solar cell. In
this structure a-SiC:H acts as a window layer. In the late 80s, Panasonic a leading
multinational company known for its quality electronic products followed the idea
of Hamakawa and his co-workers and started developing a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction
formation technique for the quality evaluation of polycrystalline silicon materials for
solar cell applications. During this course of development of a-Si:H/c-Si, they intro-
duced a thin buffer layer of undoped a-Si:H between doped a-Si:H and wafer. The
introduction of this buffer layer reduces the surface recombination and improves the
open circuit voltage with the corresponding ﬁll factor [3, 25]. This result is an indica-
tion that fabrication of high-performance SHJ solar cells by a simple manufacturing
process is possible and particularly for a solar cell with a high open circuit voltage
suppressed rate of surface recombination was easy to obtain. The basic structure of
SHJ is mentioned in Fig. 3.
It is clear from the Fig. 3 that a-Si:H covered the presence of dangling bonds on
the surface of c-Si, a-Si:H is also a semiconductor having equal short-range order
but higher bandgap than c-Si. The a-Si:H and c-Si have the ability to take good cova-
lent bonds, whereas the remaining dangling bonds are ceased by the existence of
hydrogen atoms. The interface of n-type a-Si:H and c-Si works as an energy barrier
and effectively blocks the holes. The efﬁcient passivation of the c-Si surface has
been done by the electrically conductive a-Si:H, so for the SHJ solar cells a poten-
tial amount of extraction of photo-generated charge carriers with minimum carrier
recombination loss is observed. So, these SHJ solar cells are passivated contact
solar cells with a tunnel contact structure [26]. Surprisingly, for the SHJ solar cells
the expected tunneling process does not occur naturally here the dominance of the
thermionic emission model was reported for the transportation of charge carriers
across the heterojunction interface [27]. These SHJ solar cells are compatible at high
temperatures also since they have a much less recombination rate which facilitates
high voltage and low output voltage drop in comparison to the other metal–semicon-
ductor contact solar cells like PERC. Additionally, the manufacturing process is also

simple which requires a temperature below 200 °C. The liberality for the quality vari-
ation of the bulk wafer is high, which enhances the manufacturing yield. The front
and back symmetrical structures of the wafer are highly resilient to the thinner wafers
such that the making of bifacial modules is convenient. As we know that the initial
attempts for the junction formation were highly motivated by the idea of Hamakawa
et al. [23] and the ﬁrst attempt was done by depositing the doped a-Si:H ﬁlms directly
over the c-Si which results in a low ﬁll factor and output voltage due to large leakage
current and high amount of recombination rate. The failure of this attempt forced the
developers to use undoped a-Si:H ﬁlms and the overall performance of the supposed
heterojunction structure was increased [25]. After this encouraging success, the back
side of this heterojunction structure was studied and conﬁrmed that the insertion of
the i-layer at the n c-Si/n+ a-Si:H interface on the back side reduces the interfacial
recombination. This should be considered as the establishment of the basic form of
a-Si:H/ c-Si HJ solar cells [28]. In 1990, the reported conversion efﬁciency is 14.5%
for an area of 4 mm2 [29], and a few years later, the same structure with a superior
junction formation technique resulted in a conversion efﬁciency of 20% for an area
of 1 cm2 [28]. In 1997, the launching and commercialization of the ﬁrst SHJ photo-
voltaic module took place with the addition of some proprietary technology such as
introducing Ag paste which hardens at low temperatures. Figure 3 shows the journey
of SHJ solar cells from laboratory to commercialization. After the establishment of
the basic structure, an improvement in the fabrication of the interfaces was required
to explore the possibilities of SHJ solar cells. Many sincere efforts to brush up on the
technology related to SHJ solar cells have been reported [30–34]. The latest highest
photo conversion efﬁciency for SHJ solar cells reported by Lin et al. [35] is ~26.81%

223
and ﬁll factor up to ~86.59% by using electrically optimized silicon nanocrystals as
hole contact layers.
At the beginning of the twenty-ﬁrst century, the discovery of graphene led
researchers of various ﬁelds up to new dimensions of research and technology [36].
In modern-day optoelectronics device’s signiﬁcant role of graphene has increased in
the past few decades due to its remarkable properties such as high mobility, robust-
ness, and low-cost transparency [37]. The characteristics and properties of graphene
such as ultrahigh carrier mobility are requirements for contemporary transistors and
rapid photodetectors [38, 39]. Moreover, for heterojunction solar cell applications,
graphene can be served as active layers, carriers transport layers, and electrodes
[40]. Lancelotti et al. [41] have used chemical vapor-deposited graphene as trans-
parent conductive electrodes for silicon heterojunction solar cells tested over the
area of 4 cm2 based on n-type c-Si wafers with three different p-type emitters amor-
phous silicon, nanocrystalline silicon and nanocrystalline silicon oxide. Rezaei et al.
[42] have incorporated Au nanoparticles with a graphene shell and positioned them
betweenholetransportlayersandactivelayerswhichenhancestheopticalabsorbance
and induced more balanced charge transfer and the efﬁciency of power conversion
increases for polymer heterojunction solar cells. The effect of the graphene layer and
zinc oxide nanorods in the zinc oxide-based heterojunction solar cells was studied
by Meymian et al. [43]. They deposited the zinc oxide thin ﬁlms to serve as an
anti-reﬂective layer on the p-type silicon and n-type semiconductor using a radio
frequency sputtering technique to form a heterojunction thin ﬁlm solar cell. This
results in an enhanced efﬁciency of ~14.12% with a ﬁll factor of ~0.552. Ros et al.
[44] suggested a new approach to incorporate a transparent conductive electrode
based on graphene monolayer in non-conventional silicon heterojunction solar cells.
In this design, the MoOx selective contact replaces the conventional emitter and the
efﬁciency is improved by ~1.6% when the graphene is incorporated on the top. Xiao
et al. [45] designed air-stable Si-based organic/inorganic heterojunction solar cells
using a graphene transparent electrode and double-layer anti-reﬂection coating. The
utility of this graphene layer is to avoid the blocking of strong light and to ensure
effective carrier collection. The light-harvesting phenomenon of this Si wafer is
exceptionally enhanced by the double-layer anti-reﬂection coating based on poly-
methyl methacrylate (PMMA) and Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly (styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) stacking layer. The observed photo conversion efﬁciency
is ~13.01% and the protective layer of graphene/PMMA provides excellent stability.

Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs)
Despite the properties and applications discussed above, the zero-band gap of
graphene causes technical problems in some electronic applications. The size of a
typical graphene sheet is of the order of a few micrometers. The bandgap of graphene
can be altered in two ways either reducing the size of the sheet or controlled doping
of hetero atom. The reduction in the dimension of the graphene sheet from two

224
A. Srivastava and S. A. Khan
dimensions (2D) to zero dimension (0D) is possible. Traditionally, a graphene sheet
having a size less than 10 nm is considered a Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs)
[46, 47]. The GQDs are highly heterogeneous nanoscale, 0D particles with a typical
diameter of 1–20 nm with a graphene-like structural framework of sp2 hybridized
carbon [48]. The nanoscale dimension gives rise to size-dependent quantum conﬁne-
ment effect and the combination of such effect with peripheral chemical functional
groups and edge effects comes up with robust and reliable photoluminescence [49].
This inherent luminescence of GQDs has given numerous applications in the ﬁeld
of sensing [50] and bio-imaging [51]. Additionally, the mechanical, chemical, and
biocompatible properties of GQDs make them suitable candidates for a diverse range
of applications [52, 53].
The wide band gap of GQDs with the ﬂexibility to design this band gap over
a substantial range and carrier selectivity attributes for the enhancement of photo
conversion efﬁciency for different solar cells. Apart from the direct application of
GQDs in solar cells, its introduction in solar active materials also unlocks some
interesting photophysical phenomena. That is why GQDs in photovoltaics is burning
coal for present and future optimistic applications. In the last decade, we can observe
routineresearcharticlesinvariousreputedjournalsrelatedtotheapplicationofGQDs
as the performance booster for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) [54], silicon solar
cells (SSCs) [55], perovskites solar cells (PSCs) [56], novel heterojunction solar cells
[57] and organic solar cells (OSCs) [58].

Synthesis of Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs)
Most of the preliminary applications of GQDs have utilized the inherent lumines-
cence properties but with limited focus on the chemical functionality and reactivity
of the materials [59]. Later, on when the complexity related to GQDs platforms
has increased, the modiﬁcation and manipulation in the inherent chemistry, addi-
tion of functionality, strong reactivity, and alteration in optical properties need to be
addressed. There are several factors on which the modiﬁcation of GQDs depends and
they must be considered properly for the complexity and chemical sensitive nature of
various GQDs platforms. The choice of precursor materials, solubility, chosen fabri-
cation techniques, chemical reactivity of the conjugated chemical, biological and
biochemical molecules, and overall the ﬁnal chemical environment can all control
the unanimous and relevant synthetic chemical routes that can be implemented for
the engineering of speciﬁc GQDs integrated devices and materials for various desir-
able applications [48, 60]. The synthesis techniques for the preparation of carbon-
based quantum dots can be classiﬁed into two categories top-down and bottom-up
approaches [61].

10
Graphene Quantum Dots-Based Heterojunction Solar Cells
225
3.1
Top-Down Approach
In this approach, the carbon-based quantum dots were prepared from the bulk carbon,
graphite powder, graphite oxide and reduced graphite oxide, carbon nanotubes, and
carbon ﬁbers through the methods like arc discharge, plasma reactors, laser ablation,
chemical exfoliation, and ultrasonic synthesis. Here we have brieﬂy discussed these
methods and results for GQDs.
3.2
Arc-Discharge Method
The discovery of Carbon Quantum Dots (CQDs) was an unintentional phenomenon
that happened during the puriﬁcation of arc-discharged single-walled carbon
nanotubes by Xu et al. [62]. The arc discharge technique consists of a sealed reactor
ﬁlled with plasma and the carbon atoms were decomposed from the bulk carbon
precursors in the anodic electrodes. The high-energy plasma leads the temperature
of this reactor up to 4,000 K and the carbon vapors assemble in the form of QDs in the
electrode. The QDs prepared by this method consist of a large amount of oxygen and
show bright ﬂuorescence. Dey et al. [63] have synthesized boron and nitrogen-doped
GQDs using the arc-discharge method from the graphene sample and compared their
ﬂuorescence properties.
3.3
Plasma Reactor
In 2010, Denes et al. [64] synthesized CQDs using plasma reactors using benzene
and helium as cavitation gas respectively. Later on, Zheng et al. [65] synthesized
N-doped GQDs using C60 as a carbon source, and nitrogen is used as cavitation gas.
The prepared N-GQDs were used as sensing probes for the detection of ferric ions.
The construction of a plasma reactor consists of a cylindrical shaped Pyrex glass
chamber with Teﬂon caps for the supply of cavitation gas and electrical connections.
3.4
Laser Ablation
The laser ablation method is one of the versatile methods for the synthesis of nanos-
tructures of different morphologies. In 2006, Sun et al. [66] used this method ﬁrst
time for the synthesis of CQDs using an Nd: YAG laser source on a carbon target
followed by acid treatment. After this many researchers have reported the synthesis
of CQDs and GQDs using this technique for various applications. Russo et al. [67]

226
A. Srivastava and S. A. Khan
have synthesized the porous graphene and GQDs using the femtosecond laser abla-
tion of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. Synthesis of GQDs using laser-fragmented
graphene nanosheets for heterojunction solar cell application was reported by Qin
et al. [68]. The synthesized GQDs act as a buffer layer between TiO2 and P3HT to
form cascade-level energy architecture.
3.5
Chemical Exfoliation and Combustion
The synthesis of GQDs can be also done by the electrochemical cleavage of the
carbon precursors like CVD-grown graphene, rGO ﬁlms, and graphite rods. The
mechanism behind this method is very simple and involved the formation of free
radicals of OH· and O· from the anodic oxidation of water. The role of these radicals
is like “electrochemical scissors” in the production of GQDs. In organic solvents,
this process is ruled by the electrical stress followed by the anionic intercalation
between consecutive layers of graphene. Combustion is a very simple procedure to
produce GQDs as the raw materials (candle ash, natural gas ash, and parafﬁn putty)
required are easily available. Ye et al. [69] have synthesized GQDs using coal by
exfoliation technique. Peng et al. [70] have done oxidative cutting of carbon ﬁbers
and prepared GQDs by chemical exfoliation technique. Candle soot can be used as a
carbon source for the preparation of GQDs via combustion and chemical exfoliation
routes [71].
3.6
Ultrasonic Synthesis
The sonochemical method requires intense ultrasound to fabricate nanocarbon mate-
rials without long reaction time under high pressure and temperature. The production
of nano-scale carbon through this method can affect its composition, shape, and size
and modiﬁes its surface structure, solubility, and aggregation. The formation of the
acoustical cavity followed by the crumbling and collapsing of the liquid bubbles is
responsible for the changes that occur in the nanomaterials. The triggering of hydro-
dynamic cavitation is performed by using liquid jets, which results in the formation
of critical bubbles [72, 73]. Further, the fragmentation of these critical bubbles leads
to the preparation of GQDs [74]. Zhu et al. [75] have synthesized GQDs of average
lateral diameters of 3 nm and applied the ﬂuorescence quenching mechanism for the
detection of alkaline phosphate.

227
3.7
Bottom-Up Approach
The bottom-up approach is typically based on the process of pyrolysis and carboniza-
tion of organic precursors. These methods are cost-effective, less toxic, and more
environment friendly and we can produce scalable amounts of GQDs of the
required morphology. In the bottom-up approach mainly hydrothermal/solvothermal,
microwave, and thermal pyrolysis were considered and brieﬂy discussed below.
3.8
Hydrothermal/Solvothermal Methods
Hydrothermal or in general solvothermal method is the most efﬁcient, cost-effective,
and environment-friendly method used by researchers to produce GQDs. It consists
of a Teﬂon-coated reactor in which we have water or other solvents with organic
precursors. The synthesis process took place inside the reactor at a maintained
high temperature (180–220 °C) and high pressure. Firstly, Pan et al. [76] applied
a hydrothermal method to synthesize GQDs by acid-cutting graphene oxide sheets
with mild ultrasonication. They obtained GQDs with an average diameter of 9.6 nm.
Later on, many researchers studied the photoluminescence mechanism, [77] effect
of precursors, and temperature [78] and used this technique for the production of
GQDs for their applications in various ﬁelds [79–81].

Microwave Synthesis
In microwave synthesis techniques, electromagnetic waves ranging from 1 mm to
1 m were used for the breaking of chemical bonds for the creation of new chem-
ical structures in a very short reaction time of 2–10 min [82]. In 2012, Tang et al.
[83] reported for the ﬁrst time the synthesis of GQDs using the microwave-assisted
hydrothermal method. They used glucose as an organic precursor and found that their
synthesized GQDs exhibit a photoluminescence quantum yield of ~7–11%. Hsieh
et al. [84] have used microwave synthesis methods for the production of nitrogen
boron co-doped GQDs as sensing probes for metal ions and pesticides. Hoang et al.
[85] have synthesized GQDs using the microwave-assisted hydrothermal method and
applied them as a hole transport layer in an organic solar cell. An increment in the
short circuit current density has been observed which improves the efﬁciency of the
solar cell.

Thermal Pyrolysis
Thermal pyrolysis is a thermochemical process in which material degrades into
nanostructures in the absence of oxygen. In recent times, this method got attention for
its application in the conversion of waste organic materials into remarkable applica-
tions products [86]. Gu et al. [87] have used GQDs prepared by the thermal pyrolysis
method as an anode in Li-ion batteries and reported a superior storage capacity and
high rate capability. The valine functionalized GQDs as a novel optical Hg2+ sensor
has been reported by Xioyan et al. [88]. They performed thermal pyrolysis of citric
acid and valine.

Properties of Graphene Quantum Dots (GQDs)
The GQDs are imploded nanostructured graphene consisting of single or multiple
layers. The properties of GQDs depend upon the synthesis techniques, size, defects,
dopants, and attached functional groups. Herein, we have discussed the major prop-
erties of GQDs in three categories absorption, photoluminescence properties, and
the most important electrical properties which is the essential feature in photovoltaic
applications.
4.1
Absorption Properties
The optical properties of GQDs play an important role in most applications like solar
cells, bioimaging, sensing, etc. The optical properties of GQDs are highly inﬂuenced
by the presence of functional groups, defects, and doping proﬁles. The GQDs show
strong absorption in both UV and visible regions. The UV-Vis spectrum of the GQDs
consists of two distinct peaks at 230 nm and 300 nm nearly corresponding to π–π*
transition of C=C and n–π* transition of C=O bonds respectively. Kim et al. [89]
have shown that the absorption spectrum of the GQDs strongly depends on size due
to the quantum conﬁnement effect. They observed a blue shift with a reduction in the
size of GQDs. When the diameter of GQDs increases from 5 to 35 nm the absorption
peaks shift to ~6.2 eV to ~4.6 eV respectively, which is very close to the graphene
sheets. Another interesting observation is the absorption properties of the GQDs
also depend upon the synthesis techniques as different surface states were produced
by the different synthesis methods [90]. For example, GQDs (9.6 nm) prepared
from the hydrothermal method show the same UV absorption peak of 330 nm with
solvothermal obtained GQDs (5 nm) [91]. Peng et al. [70] have shown that at different
reaction temperatures, GQDs exhibit different emissions of blue, yellow, and green.

4.2
Photoluminescence (PL) Properties
In the studies and applications of GQDs, PL properties play a very crucial role.
Graphene is a zero-band gap material as we have discussed earlier which is why
the occurrence quantum conﬁnement effect is important for GQDs. The PL emis-
sion spectra of the GQDs have a wide range from UV to IR. The band gap and PL
properties are strongly associated with the shape, size, morphology, and edge states
[60, 89]. The external factors such as microchemical environment and experimental
conditions are also responsible for the PL behavior of the synthesized GQDs. The
temperature-dependent studies of the PL spectra at different excitation wavelengths
were performed by Li et al. [92]. The obtained PL spectra show a signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in PL intensity for excitation wavelengths of ~310, ~340, and 365 nm in the
temperature range of less than 80 °C. The surroundings and their interactions with
the GQDs affect the PL properties to a large extent. The PL spectra of the zeolitic
imidazolate framework (ZIF) encapsulated GQDs have shown a shift of ~32 nm due
to the interaction of zeolitic imidazolate nanocrystals with GQDs [93]. Wang et al.
[94] observed a shift from blue to green in the PL spectra of GQDs placed in the
vicinity of a single silver nano-octahedron. The pH of the solution can remarkably
alter the PL properties of the GQDs. Fan et al. [95] observed a PL emission peak
shift from ~480 to ~440 nm with a variation in pH from 7 to 6.7. Many researchers
have also analyzed and reported the possible mechanism of this pH-dependent PL
property of the GQDs [96–98]. To utilize the PL properties of the GQDs, quantum
yield is also a very important factor in the ﬂuorescence, basically quantum yield
provides information about the emitting photons from the molecules under the direct
excitation due to the source [99].
4.3
Electrical Properties
The properties related to the optics of GQDs can be modiﬁed and improved by
varying the electronic structure. The zero-band gap of pristine graphene restricts its
electronic applications profoundly. The bandgap of graphene can be tuned in many
ways like moderating its surface chemistry, size, and by doping of heteroatoms. In
the same way, the electronic structure ﬂexibility of GQDs allows tailoring in its
bandgap via doping of suitable dopants and surface functional groups. The bandgap
of semiconductor QDs or carbon-based QDs increases with a decrease in particle size.
Theoretical analysis of the relationship between the size and bandgap of GQDs was
done by Mahasin et al. [100]. Later on, Ye et al. [101] veriﬁed this experimentally for
coal-derived GQDs. Another group of researchers reported the change in band gap
with morphology and organic surface functional groups attached to the synthesized
GQDs [102]. Many other researchers have also explored the cause-and-effect relation
between the electrical properties of GQDs and different parameters [103–105].

Applications of GQDS in Heterojunction Solar Cells
Heterojunction solar cells are a combination of two different technologies into a
single cell. The involvement of GQDs in the solid-state heterojunction solar cells
gives remarkable enhancement in the overall performances such as photoconver-
sion efﬁciencies and stability. The incorporation of the GQDs leads to ampliﬁcation
in the optical absorption process, electron transport phenomenon, and sensitivity
of the suggested heterojunction structures for solar cell applications. The market
of the photovoltaic industry is still dominated by SHJ solar cells due to their high
photoconversion efﬁciency and ease of manufacturing for scalable production. The
application of GQDs further improves the performance of the SHJ solar cells owing
to their especial photo response, photon management, and brilliant selective career
characteristics. In 2014, Gao et al. [106] designed a simple solar cell strategy of c-Si
and GQDs in a core-shell design. This c-Si/GQDs heterojunction device served with
a photoconversion efﬁciency of ~6.63% and consists of stability for up to six months.
The role of the GQDs layer in this heterojunction device is to work as an electron-
blocking medium for the prevention of rapid recombination of the photo-generated
charge carriers. The fabrication of the c-Si/GQDs heterojunction solar cell was done
via a facile solution process; the colloidal solution of the GQDs was dropped on the
c-Si surface and opened in the air for the evaporation of the solvent. After some time
when the solvent was fully evaporated a layer of GQDs was established on the c-Si
wafer. Figure 4 shows the SEM image of the fabricated device, it is visible that the
deposited layer of the GQDs is smooth as well as uniform in thickness. Also, the
absence of any visible cracks suggests that there are no short-circuit channels between
the c-Si wafer and top electrodes. The unpassivated Si consists of large no. of surface
dangling bonds which induces a high amount of surface recombination rates. In this
experiment, the c-Si/GQDs heterojunction solar cells were analyzed using multiple
Si surface passivation of H-, SiOx-, and CH3- terminations. Figure 4 consists of the
various measurement results obtained. The thickness of the GQDs is ﬁxed at 80 nm,
with the particle size ranging from 2 to 6 nm for all synthesized devices. The obser-
vation of the current density versus voltage (J–V) curve shows a prominent rectifying
behavior which indicates the emergence of a heterojunction between GQDs and c-Si.
The diode performance of the CH3–Si/GQDs was much better than their counter-
parts H–Si/GQDs and SiOx–Si/GQDs. Due to the effective surface passivation, the
photovoltaic performance of CH3–Si/GQDs was superior to the other H–Si/GQDs
and SiOx–Si/GQDs. The short circuit current density (JSC) and open circuit voltage
(V OC) for CH3–Si/GQDs heterostructure device were ~23.38 mA/cm2 and 0.51 V
respectively. The calculated ﬁll factor (FF) for this heterojunction structure was
~0.55 and obtained the maximum photo conversion efﬁciency (PCE) of 6.63%. The
incorporation of the GQDs plays an essential role in this proposed heterojunction
structure, to verify this the GQDs layer is ﬁrst removed and then replaced by the GO
layer. After the removal of the GQDs layer, CH3-Si/Au still showed the behavior of a
Schottky-type solar cell but its observed photovoltaic performance parameters such
as JSC = ~10.77 mA/cm2, V OC = ~0.31 V and PCE = ~2.26% were very poor.

231
Conversely, the application of the GO layer (CH3–Si/GO) enhanced the V OC up to
0.44 in comparison to CH3–Si/Au. However, the value of JSC ~ 14.71 mA/cm2 and
PCE is ~3.99% were still very low compared with CH3–Si/GQDs device as shown
in Fig. 4. The external quantum efﬁciency (EQE) was also calculated for these three
devices, the EQE value of all three devices followed the same trend of photovoltaic
characteristics. The EQE curve in Fig. 4 shows that the value of EQE is maximum
(65% at 550 nm) for GQDs-based devices and comparatively low for both devices
one having an absence of GQDs and the other consisting of GO layer. Diao et al.
[55] have utilized the GQDs as a p-contact layer in n-Si/GQDs heterojunction solar
cells. This device yielded an exceptional PCE of ~12.35%. The construction of the
n-Si/GQDs heterojunction device involved a deposition of Ti/Au (2/50 nm) on the
SiO2 layer by electron beam deposition followed by the ﬁxed amount of dropping
of GQDs aqueous solution on the window side of the CH3-terminated Si surface.
The PMMA-supported monolayer graphene ﬁlm was directly transferred to the Cu
foil consisting of CVD-deposited graphene to obtain the ﬁve-layer graphene (FLG)
ﬁlm. This arrangement was dried at 120 °C for 5 min and then placed into Marble’s
reagent for the removal of Cu foil. This process was repeated four times and the
FLG ﬁlms were successfully obtained. These synthesized FLG ﬁlms have a small
square resistance of 0.29  per square meter with high transmittance percentage of
88–90% in the range of 500–1100 nm which shows the prime quality of the graphene
ﬁlms. These synthesized FLG ﬁlms were incorporated into the Si/GQDs heterojunc-
tion and dried for 5 min at 120 °C. The residual PMMA on the surface of FLG
ﬁlms was simply removed by putting this device into acetone for 20 min. In the last
step, In-Ga is pasted on the rear side of the Si surface for the formation of Ohmic
contact. The GQDs/Si heterojunction shows outstanding photovoltaic performances
and the calculated photovoltaic parameters for GQDs/Si heterojunction were V OC =
~0.53 V, JSC = ~26.99 mA/cm2, and FF = ~0.63.

A. Srivastava and S. A. Khan
The importance of GQDs incorporation in the heterojunction device can be under-
stood by the energy band diagram of the GQDs/Si heterojunction as shown in Fig. 5.
The work function of the pristine graphene is around ~4.66 eV, the conduction band
minimum (EC), and the valence band maximum (EV) for n-type Si is ~4.05 eV and
~5.17 eV respectively. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) for GQDs
of size 3–6 nm is ~6.56 eV, the optical band gap for GQDs is ~3.60 eV and the
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is ~2.96 eV. Under light radiation,
the photogenerated charge carrier electron–hole pairs in Si will diffuse through the
GQDs/Si interface and further get separated by the inﬂuence of the built-in electric
ﬁeld in the heterojunction. The holes were transferred via the GQDs layer and gath-
ered at the graphene electrode which is working as an anode whereas the electrons
were collected at the bottom on the In-Ga electrode working as a cathode. The high
transmittance of graphene ensured the maximum absorption of the incident light. The
LUMO position of the GQDs is much higher than the EC of Si, this will prevent the
movement of electrons from Si to graphene leading to the minimization of recom-
bination on the side of the graphene anode. Conversely, the hole transport for this
device showed a contradictory behavior in the experimental result as compared to
the theoretical speculations. Therefore, the barrier should not be as large as shown in
Fig. 5, this might be possible due to the tunneling of holes through the GQDs layer
rather than transport through HOMO level. The existence of an intermediate energy
layer in the band gap of the GQDs might be another reason for the effective transport
of holes (shown by dashed lines in Fig. 5). The appearance of this intermediate layer
was the result of defects on the surface or edges, allowing the transport of holes
through graphene. The overall conclusion is that for this GQDs/Si heterojunction
device, the presence of the GQDs layer not only works as an electron-blocking layer
but also served as the hole transport layer. Tsai et al. [107] have developed an organic/
inorganic hybrid solar cell that is based on Poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly
(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/Si.

cell. Reproduced with permission from Ref. [107]
The schematic diagram of the incorporation process of GQDs in the structure can
be shown in Fig. 6. The supplement of GQDs enhances the overall performance of
this hybrid Si solar cell. A considerable amount of increment in JSC from ~32.11
to ~36.26 mA/cm2 was observed by the incorporation of the GQDs. Similarly, the
PCE of (PEDOT:PSS)/Si hybrid solar cell showed a substantial change from ~11.5
to ~13.2%. The excellent light management properties of the GQDs make them a
suitable candidate for hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells. The phenomenal optical
properties like absorption and transmittance as well as their role in photogenerated
carrier transportation and blockage are the major features that help to enhance the
overall performance of the Si-based hybrid solar cell. A similar approach for the
development of GQDs incorporated PEDOT: PSS-GQDs/porous Si heterojunction
solar cell was performed by Shin et al. [108]. They used TiOx as a passivation layer
and reported a PCE of 10.49% for an active area of 5 mm2.
Apart from SHJ solar cells, the highly impactful applications of GQDs can be
witnessed in another type of heterojunction solar cells. For example, Dutta et al. [57]
have developed a ZnO/GQDs solid-state heterojunction solar cell. In this structure,
the ZnO nanowires were grown on the Al-doped ZnO ﬁlms. The spaces between the
nanowires were ﬁlled by the applications of GQDs. Overall, the layer of this structure
was turned out in a layer of GQDs. To increase its overall performance through the
transportation of holes, NN′-diphenyl-N-N′-bis(3-methylphenyl)-1,1′-biphenyl)-4,
4′-diamine (TPD) layer was also introduced. This device reported a V OC of 0.8 V
on applying the composite layer with a very low value of PCE. Khan and Kim [109]
have applied the functionalized N-GQDs as downconverters to boost the overall
performance of the CIGS solar cells. Zhu et al. [110] have reported an enhanced
PCE by the application of N-GQDs and ZnO as a hole transport layer in a polymer-
based bulk heterojunction solar cell. Perovskites are newly emerging materials in
the ﬁeld of photovoltaics. Perovskites-based solar cells have marked their presence
recently but they achieved a rapid and effective amount of growth amazingly. GQDs
have also been incorporated into these perovskites-based heterojunction solar cells.

234
A. Srivastava and S. A. Khan
Guo et al. [111] have added GQDs in Sn–Pb-based low bandgap perovskite solar
cells at PEDOT: PSS/perovskite interface for simultaneous modulation in the energy
level and charge transfer. They synthesized GQDs of different doping elements, the
N-Cl doped GQDs showed the best photovoltaic parameters such as VOC = ~0.89 V,
FF = ~0.88, and an impressive PCE = ~21.5%. The incorporation of the GQDs in a
particular heterostructure device gives an improved value of the open circuit voltage
due to its band structure. The improved properties of the heterojunction devices are
attributed to the advanced properties of highly efﬁcient GQDs, as they are effective
sensitizers and excellent photo absorbers and execute easy passivation through the
grain boundaries of photosensitive materials.

Conclusions and Future Prospective
In concluding remarks, we have discussed the history and development of photo-
voltaics keeping our focus on the Si heterojunction solar cells. The discovery of
graphene and its applications in heterojunction devices with restrictions are also
pointed out. In detail, we have mentioned the utility of GQDs due to their tunable
band gap and exceptional optical properties. The synthesis techniques and properties
are also discussed in brief for a better understanding of the GQDs. The applications
of the GQDs in heterojunction devices are discussed with full details and possible
explanations. Although GQDs have the potential to attract researchers in the ﬁeld of
photovoltaics, especially for heterostructure devices, still the development and estab-
lishment of efﬁcient and stable prototypes are far. Researchers across the globe need
to work on the modiﬁcation of these devices to achieve high efﬁciency and stability.
The problem of the lacking of power generation and high consumption is known to
everyone, photovoltaic devices are the top alternative in front of the world for dealing
with this issue. The photovoltaic industry is facing multiple challenges such as low-
cost installation and maintenance, minimization of non-renewable energy sources,
and to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. As we have discussed earlier that
Si-based heterojunction solar cells are dominating the industry of photovoltaics and
with the incorporation of the GQDs their overall performance increases. There is a
lot of work required for the development of another type of heterojunction solar cells
and the applications of the GQDs in such types of devices, their journey from labora-
tory to commercialization is still a tedious task. This journey of heterojunction solar
cells was started nearly 50 years ago and their development is regularly achieving
new milestones shortly we will witness some more astonishing innovations in the
applications of GQDs in heterojunction solar cells.
