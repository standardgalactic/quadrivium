with one player setting

other players have a

If you're one of those people who
rushed out and bought Golden Axe
when the ﬁrst batch were released in
December and were skill enough to get
to level ﬁve, you must've been skill
'cause there wasn't one.
You see, some dude down in the
tape dungeon failed to realise that the
game was meant to be released with
ﬁve levels and left the last one out.
Since then the duplicator has been
shot (probably) and Virgin has given us
a call to ask us to get those people
with dodgy tapes to send them back
(to the address also on these pages.
labelled Virgin Customer Service
Dept.). In return you'll get a brand
spanky new copy with level ﬁve where
it ought to be.
If you don't know whether you've
got the level or not 'cause you're such
a spacko and can't get that far - tough,
you'll forever be sitting there
wondering if you're one of those
unlucky plebs (and it serves you right
for being so crap).

Something ﬁshy is going

are in progress to covert
James Pond onto the

The Amiga Bond
spoof was a simply
superb underwater
arcade adventure which
can best be described as
James Bond meeting the
Mario Brothers in
swimsuits - yep it's a half
adventure mixed with
cutsie elements shaken
but not stirred and it
promises to be as action
packed and fun-ﬁlled as
the ﬁlms themselves.

TURTLEY
OVER THE TOP
I really thought
we had seen the
end of those
pizza-
breathed
half-wits
given the
fact that
there is now
everything
from
toothpaste
to
underpants
but no -
Mirrorsoft
are wringing
out all the
green gold
out of those
turtles by
announcing
Teenage
Mutant Hero
Turtles TM 2 and 3.
It looks like the
games will be more of
the same (see YC
February for review) -
shame as Mirrorsoft
could have done
something really stonky
with such a license. By
my reckoning the
games will be out pretty
damn quick if they are
to catch the band
wagon before the
heroes do a "Batman"
and go out of fashion as
quick as deelie-
boppers.
Let's hope that two
and three improve on
the ﬁrst but if you ask
me TM doesn't only
stand for Trade Mark it
means Too Much!

Team Yankie - Empire's
strategical tank warfare
simulation which did oh so
well on 16-bit is at last to
make it onto the Commie.
The 16-bit game (a
conversion of the No 1
best-selling book) is a
superb and accurate tank
sim designed to test your
leadership and tactical
skills to the full. However,
technical boffs amongst
you must be thinking
"coo, how is all that
spectacular information
going to ﬁt onto the mere
commie" - well that's just
wot Empire are tactically
deciding! It is unsure
whether the C64 game will
be a sim or a arcade
shoot-ern-up but it's sure
to be a game that Mr
Hussein would fail
abysmally at cos it's too
real a modern tank
warfare simulation!

Great fun for Dredd fans, but the simple
gameplay, and routine backgrounds may
deter all but the hardened fan.
take the long walk. For some
reason the end of game
failure scenes are presented
in incredibly blocky black and
white. Er. is this meant to be
comic art ? If so it was drawn
with a big piece of coal.
Anyway, ﬁrst off there's a
computer terminal emulation
piece that comes up rather
unexpectedly. Logging on is
obvious enough, but it's a
-disappointment to see the
free games that were on the
16-bit versions have been cut
from here. Basically all you
get is background info, so
you may as well get on wit
the game pronto.
First up is the Dan Tanner
blaock, and problems with
Fatties. Apart from eating too
much, they also have a
suicidal desire to jump and a
squash you. Lick, rnesssy !
You keep the crime rate
down by shooting Fatties
other reprobates who offer up
power ups, and energy
replenishments after dying.
Jolly useful too. The objective
is to destroy the four food
dispensors lying around the
block (big sprawling
platforms and ladders game
in other words), and then
escape out of the city, before
the crime rate reaches
maximum and you get the
chop. Avoiding the Fatties
and running out of energy•
pretty easy, with the only
trouble coming from the
crime rate. For every innocent
(huh in my book no-one is
innocent) that gets shot (by
you that is) the crime rate
escalates (it does anyway,
but this makes it worse), and
only continuous ventilation of
large fat personages reduces
it. And the destruction of the
food dispensors. Thankfully
when you knock out one of
these it goes down to zero.
Dredd looks suitably like
Dredd (you should see the
Amiga version - he looks like
a farmer in wellies) and the
sprites are pretty good, what
there are of them, but the
background is really
monotonous. I know you're
plodding through a tower
block, but does it have to
look so dull ?
At least on the way back
or on a long stretch you can
call upi your motorbike,
though beware, while on his
wheels, Dredd doesn't have
the co-ordination to ride and
ﬁre at once.
What saves the game
from being incredibly tedious
as you plod around shooting
fatties, and shooting the other
guys that cough up power
ups, is that each of the six
levels is mapped. It may not
be exactly to scale but since
you can pause the action and
work out where you are it
saves a helluva lot of ploddin.
There are six levels all
told, most in the same vein,
with some sideways scrolling
leapy jumpy action thrown in.
For Dredd and platform fans
: this is good stuff, but it tends
to be a bit routine for your
average gamer. Pretty good,
but an acquired 
"

Chrimbo 1989 was
quite undoubtedly
Turbo Outrun,
undoubtedly because it
was so spifﬁngly
accurate to the arcade
machine and was easily
the best racing game
ever on the C64 (at that
time). And ﬁnally US
Gold has released a
game that attempts to
better the best.
Again a Sega coin-op
is the inspiration for the
brummie company's
latest 'burn-'til-you-
can't-burn-no-more-em-

the development team
chosen for the awesome
task of converting a
game that, if we're
honest to ourselves, is
pretty unconvertable. But
not only has it
succeeded in making the
game as stonky as they
come, but Probe's even
expanded the entire
game far beyond the very
limited appeal of the
arcade machine.

like Freddy Krueger's,
unless you're particularly
good!).
When you ﬁnally get
down onto the track you
ﬁrst have to qualify (in
true Pole Position
tradition) to see which

place you hold on the
grid (or to see if you plod
back to sunny Outer
Mongolia with your tail,
and your spark plugs,
ﬁrmly grasped between
your legs). Then you get
to race against other
cars (Ooo!), all of which
are hungry for the very
same championship as
you, and ninety percent
of them put you quite
categorically in the
shade. You have to
complete three laps in
order to ﬁnish the race -
this is where reality is
completely obliterated
for the sake of
playability, could you
imagine having to
JR E N t • E W
complete the same
circuit over 70 laps.
At the end of the race
you must always be in a
position within the
maximum, and each race
the limit decreases. If
you fail to be within this
you'll be disqualiﬁed and
that's the end of the
game for you. This is a
shame 'cause you'll be
missing out on some
cracking later levels
(there's sixteen in all),
especially the ﬁnal one,
being Monaco.
And this is really all
there is to the game. It
would be nice to say that
it offers something
different than the norm,

More thrills than a Jean Claude Van Damme
movie and far prettier to boot. Real 'on the
edge of your seat' stuff.
THE
ARCADE
MACHINE
Easily the most popular game in the arcades in
Summer last year! Super Monaco's appeal was really
due to it's super fast graphics and amazingly
gripping gameplay. It's only fault was the limit
in the number of tracks you can
race on, but when
you're in that
sit-down
cabinet and
the sound of
the engines
gets you going
you'll be as
hooked as the
ﬁsh that was
caught by ﬁfteen
different
ﬁshermen at the
same time.
but that would indeed be
lying. But the reason why
it's easy to rave about this
product is the fact that,
although it's does very
little new, the stuff it offers
is that much better than
most. Super Monaco GP is
certainly not a simulation
of motor racing, no siree,
it's a humble arcade game
with ever so stonky
graphics and ﬂipping good
gamep lay and, as Nicki
Lauder would say,
"it's a FLAMING
good !aft"!
#.6•1•:-
"
Position limit: 154%
You can certainly expect Sega to
churn out a sequel with more tracks
before you can say 'one quid a go'!

SWIV DEMO
Just how stonky is that game that Rik's
currently raving about? Well, this is your
chance to test it out!
THE CRANMORE DIAMOND
AFFAIR
A GAO adventure where you have to don
your black and red stripey sweater, stick a
smelly old stocking over your head and
steal a whopping great diamond.
MIND GAMES
Yet another original game as you explore
the inside of the president's brain and ﬁnd
out what kind of guy is entrusted with the
'button' to end all civilisation.
THE ASTRODUS AFFAIR
Another adventure written using GAO. This
time it's in space, where nobody can hear
you bite into a Spam sandwich.
NOTE
Due to slight cock-up in last month's
On The Tape, it seemed as if there
were six games on the tape in
preference to four, although the tape
label quite clearly only showed four
games to be available. We apologise for
any confusion this may have caused
and have put the two games that were
missing on this month's instead. Sorry!

THE CRANMORE

Programmer: Tony Rome
Type: Complete game -
Adventure
Your hotel room was ideally
suited to the audacious
scheme that you had
dreamed up. Across the
street stood CRANMORE
building where the famous
CRANMORE DIAMOND
was being exhibited.
You reﬂected how your
present circumstances had
forced you to consider
stealing the precious gem,
but that was the reason you
were here!
You were in a small town
with a few shops, a hotel
and a police station. You
certainly had no intention of
ending up there. You
glanced at the time, it was
almost 5.00 pm, and the last
day of the exhibition. You
had about 9 hours to
execute your daring plan.
After that, the diamond
would no longer be
accessible.
You stared vaguely out
the hotel window, below
street lamps everywhere
glowed brightly in the
evening dusk. One sip of
Brandy you
thought to
calm your
jangling
nerves, and
screen (except you).
As a hint, if you
manage to answer the
three questions at the
beginning of the game
correctly, you'll be
awarded the maximum

The CRANMORE
DIAMOND affair is a text
and graphic adventure the
tests all your powers of
nerve and deduction.
Throughout the adventure
you give your commands in
the usual way. For example,
Take the Paper or Examine
the Chest, etc., etc. The
adventure is set in real time,
providing you have a
WATCH. Some of the
commands you already
know are:
TAKE/GET - To acquire
an object
DROP - To discard an
object
N/S/EAN - To move
around the adventure
LOOK - To view your
current location
TEXT/WORDS - To
follow the adventure in text
only -
PICT - to follow the
adventure with graphics also
LIST/INN - To display
your belongings
SAVE - To save current
position in the game
LOAD - To reload a
previously saved position
TIME - To restart the real
time display throughout the
game
- To cancel the real
time display
You may also be able to
converse with certain
people. For example, 'Ask
waiter about the drink', etc.
A feature of the game is the
ability to make fairly
complex commands like;
Take the watch and throw it.
A word of warning. Look out
for the thief! Good luck on
your quest_

A summit conference of
the world's two military
giants is scheduled for
tomorrow, but for no very
good reason the US
president has gone totally
insane. Well, not totally
insane, one coherent idea
remains alive deep within
his subconscious.
It is your mission, should
you accept it, to guide this
small bubble of sanity
through the labyrinth of
the president's mind,
destroying insane
thoughts and opening the
doors of reason.
Ultimately you must ﬁnd
the exit from his
subconscious and enter
the president's conscious
mind, restoring his sanity.
The president's
subconscious is made up
o fa l Ox  16 grid of 256
rooms. Each room is full of
insane thoughts which
must be blasted. When a
certain number of
thoughts have been
destroyed (this number is
different for each room)
the doors will begin to
open. The player can then
pass through these into
the next room, until the
exit is reached, and sanity
restored.

Adventure
The Astrodus Affair is a
foray into the original world
of adventure gaming, as
created by the likes of such
legends as Scott Adams
and Infocom, although
whether it manages to
attain such standards is
your own opinion!
On starting the game
your immediate thoughts
TAPE MOBS!!!
will undoubtedly be
concerned with simple
survival, which will
certainly be tough.
However, your eventual
aim is to repair and regain
full working control of the
Astrodus, and ﬂy off into
the sunset with the craft as
your own.
Standard adventure
rules apply, but in general
don't forget to EXAMINE
everything you come
across, there are very few
red herrings lying around,
everything is logical
(despite ﬁrst appearances),
and there are no major
random elements in the
game what-so-ever. As a
ﬁnal hint, there are at least
ﬁve things to be repaired.
Got those droopy tape problems? Have to
take two copies of VC into the computer
room? If so don't despair, you'll only end up
with no hair! Pop the offending little doofer

J e f f re y  D a v y  reg resses b a c k  to

ago), a s  w e  sen t h im to th e Toy
Fair 1991.
T
but once a year, and
those with long
memories may recall what
happened when yours
truly went down to Earls
Court last time. It was a
true tale of drunkenness
and debauchery courtesy
of several large glasses of
free wine and a posse of
like-minded associates.
1
But let us not dwell
upon the past, on to this,
the 1991 British Toy and
Hobby Fair at London's
Earls Court (proving once
and for all that there's no
such thing as a free lunch,
except in the press lounge
of the Toy Fair - yeah!)...
In a bizarre hangover
from last year, when a
particularly drunken
acquaintance of mine
modelled an Edd puppet
(he's still living it down), in
front of me was a gigantic
Edd. Help! This Edd was
there to show all and
sundry about new Edd the
Duck costumes and Duck
new-looks.
Another TV star (if you
have a little dish, anyhow)
is Bart Simpson. Seen
here declaring "Don't have
a cow, man" - just the
thing to say to the Ed
when your article isn't in
•
'71
on time - the
cult underachiever ("and
proud of it") is available as
a small ﬁgure - which
goes with the Simpson's
sofa, "Killer barbecue",
"crazy lawnmower", and
the other members of the
Simpson clan, or even a
talking doll. "Aye
Carumba"!
Bart wasn't the only
singer around, this young
woman was part of "2
Move 2", a dance music
group who have turned
the rules of a new board
game. "Chart Moves", into
a rap track. The game is
described as "not about
1
•
buying hotels, but
wrecking them" and
revolves around the chart
and, presumably, getting
into it and making large
piles of ﬁlthy wonga.
The man - an actor - in
the background of this
shot was paid C750 to talk
about the New Kids on the
Block dolls also shown.
He was forced to watch
the NKOTB live videos for
four days. Something
should be done to stop
this cruelty, write to... No,
but seriously, he seemed
to enjoy talking about
these dolls which come
with an interview tape
each. Expect toy shops
around the country to be
ﬁlled with screaming
teenage New Kids fans
soon (shudder).
Singers were much in
vogue at the show. Gazza
turned up to sign copies of
his new board game
called, surprisingly,
"Gazza". The press pack

A0k A t k  IF' IE air Clo 111:1 1E Ak E3) I f  A A M  I  INI
were out in force,
photographers jostled for
position as The Man
smiled and posed. "Over
here" they shouted, "Look
towards me, Paul", while
they climbed over each
other and trampled
members of the public
with instamatics who got
in the way.
Gazza also posed with
'real-life' Sindy - who'd
won a lookalike
competition for the part.
There seems to be a
fundamental mismatch
between Gazza and Sindy
- after all, Sindy dolls
don't cry.
Sindy's arch-rival
Barbie also had a 'real-life'
persona. Fancy getting
paid E15,000 a year to be
Barbie? Those dresses,
that hairstyle? No? The
most annoyed person on
the stand must have been
the guy with Barbie who
kept getting asked
whether he was the 'real-
life' representative of Ken
- Barbie's toy boyfriend.
Just like last year,
Children's Channel
(satellite only!) were
doing parts of their
programme from the
Toy Fair. Gaz Top
(who, and not a lot of
people know this,
interviewed ME
back in the dim and
distant past) was
on hand to try out
all the new games and
interview Huxley Pig. His
bacon jokes were
appaling. TV presenters
and people dressed as
pigs; Hanging's too good
for 'em, I say.
Probably desperate for
a mention on Telly,
Kevin Toms - whose
face launched several
hundred-thousand-
or-so copies of
"Football Manager" -
was hanging around
the Children's
Channel
studio/stand.
Currently working
on something
very secret (he
wouldn't tell me,
anyway) he was
persuaded (YC: "Will you
do it?" Kevin:
swoosh,
"Yes") to pose
with some
Swedes and
their (you're way
ahead) football
game
"Swegame 'Real
Soccer
used players
moved by
magnets to
allow actual
contact with
members of the
opposing side.
Vroom,
crash, oopst
Scalextric, a timeless
classic. Hornby had a
huge Scalextric track set-
up for the pleasure of all
around. I still can't keep
the cars on around the
corners.
Corgi had a large
Police car on their stand.
Looks nice doesn't it? Er...
I didn't ﬁnd out why they
had it, though.
Part of the new
range? (Get off, you're
useless - The Readers).
The man in the bug
costume really needed a
mention. Look kids, this is
what happens if you
become an actor - and
then what happens if
you're desperate for work.
You end up hired to be a
four-armed bug
demonstrating a board
game about squashing
plasticine bugs. Don't let it
happen to you.
So there you go. Toy
Fair 1991 in a nutshell
from the comfort of your
own home. Me, I'm not
going near a toy shop for
the rest of my life. Li rgh!

SUPREMACY
;
The sky at night. You can almost see the hole in the
ozone layer. And up here where we're pointing to is where
Rik's hairspray has done the most damage!
Wh e n  it c o me s  to th e crunch, h a v e

W
about it, why
would anybody
want to own eight
planets? I mean just think
about the sanitation
problems you'd have to
deal with with that many
people under your control
- and what about all the
poll tax you'd be
responsible for! Nope, I
think I'd rather spend my
few years as a humble
hack, all I have to do is
write crap not shovel it!
But some people have
the unnatural urge to
conquer everything in
sight (unlike Billy Briggs
from class 2B who had the
unnatural urge to conker
everything in sight,
including Miss Bottomly
from the science labs, and
ended up having his bare
buttocks spanked with an
extremely large and
supple twig), and they
even go as far as to take
over - by force - large
countries. Take, for
example, a small Italian
lad with chubby cheeks
and a liking for cheese,
shave his head, see him
put on a few pounds and
develop rather hanging
jowles, and Bob's your
Twin Peaks maniac you've
got yourself a Mussolini-
alike, who would, no
doubt, try to take over the
world with nowt but a
plate of over-boiled
Spaghetti.
Similarly, if you took a
small development house,
shaved all the staff's
heads, gave them a
computer or two and told
them to get cracking at
some spiffy games, they'd
soon get ideas above their
stations and try for a little
slice of the software world
domination cherry pie.
Probe has, in the last few
years, risen from a small
bunch of geezers who
dabble in games to the
biggest thing in the
computer industry since
the Oric. And to celebrate
the way they've stormed
the business, they've
produced (for Melbourne
House, an off-shoot of
Virgin Mastertronic)
Supremacy, a game all
about giving some
intergalactic dictator a run
for his money in the ass-
kicking stakes.
There are six
opponents that you can
choose to compete
' against, and depending on
which one you choose you
get a certain number of
planets with which to play
silly buggers on. Both

Husseins line up at either
end of the Galaxy and they
have to take over
(liberate?) each planet
using an elaborate method
of populisation, where you
must ﬁrst make the air
breathable for your
people, give them enough
agricultural help as you
can, and set up an
enormous army to stop a).
any dissent, and b). any
other would-be
dictatorship coming along
and ruining your man-
made democracy (?).
Of course, the
computer controlled
opponent is doing the
same, and at one point
you'll have to meet him in
the middle where there'll
be an almighty great
fracas and one of you'se

will limp home after
suffering a severe
twatting.
Every action is done
using a cursor-controlled
system and some rather
spiffy graphics. You are
able to buy the objects of
war, etc., by taxing your
people and spending hard
cash (in preferance to the
pathetic hard ecu), so a
thinking and caring
dictator is called for,
otherwise you may ﬁnd
that you're just as likely to
get a good kicking from
your own people (or
American peacekeeping
forces - which ever comes
sooner).
Supremacy is a very
slick product indeed. It did
very well on the 16-bits
and has lost nothing (even
in graphic quality) upon its
conversion. The
strategical element,
although no way in the
same league as Sim-City,
is very engrossing and the
simplicity of the idea helps
to enhance the initial
grasp factor that these
games need for a younger
garnesplayer. As you can
guess, I rather liked this
game and it's certainly
more fun than running
around the country
observing corn-circles. We
know that aliens exist, all
we need to do is give them
a good Earth-like
spanking.

 h no, I thought as
this plopped onto
my comer of the
! ofﬁce ﬂoor, not a bit
mapped 3-D object
scrolling game. Yup, the
type of game that
Afterburner and Operation
Thunderbolt proved the
Commie was completely
useless at. It just doesn't
have the graphics
resolution or the speed to
shift large 3-D objects
backwards and forwards.
For chrissakes, even the ST
has trouble doing it, so on
the C64? No way.
So, how do you judge a
game that is the conversion
of a big name coin-op, and
is generally reckoned to be
unconvertable. Same as we
always do of course. Good
graphics, smooth scrolling
and animation, snappy
music, crisp sonics, and
most importantly gameplay
with a just one more go
hook. Just cos the software
houses reckon they're
doing you some sort of
favour by converting a
game doesn't mean you
should automatically go out
on hands and knees, cash
in hand, bowing to the
almighty coin-op licence.
Line of Fire throws you
and a mate (otherwise it's a
suicide mission on your
own) into rebel held
territory, on a mission to
steal the Rapier machine
gun (hardly seems worth
risking your life for). Thus
part one of the game takes
place indoors, with
corridors rushing quite
effectively towards you,
along with passable
soldiers in brown and
green. The indoors bit is
pretty easy to program

,,,,,, •

since its all straight lines,
no nasty bit mapped
scenery here.
Controlling a cursor, you
obviously shoot the enemy,
shoot the health restoring
packages, and shoot the
grenade packets. For some
reason you appear to have
unlimited bullets so you
may as well keep your
ﬁnger on the trigger all the
time. While you can think of
excuses for the graphics,
there's no excuse for
gameplay ﬂaws. The
biggest is that the cursor
must stay on a target until
your bullet reaches it. There
is a slight delay you see,
during which time you can
move the cursor on to a
new target using the classic
spray tactic. This doesn't
work, you may as well be
spraying roses with water
for all the good it does. You
can see the bullets hit the
gooks, but if your cursor is
long gone it won't have any
effect. It means you have to
take pot shots and careful
aiming, which considering
the unlimited bullets is just
what the programmers
wanted. It alters the ﬂow,
balance and integral style of
the game though.
Once outside, whether
still in the jeep, or in the air,
the true horror of the
commies failure to cope
with 3-D bit mapped
graphics comes home. It
looks like someone shaking
a houseplant rather than a
race through the jungle. The
helicopter gunships are
good though, and at least a
fair amount of effort has
gone into the general
sprites.
It would be palatable
in a crude sort of way it it
wasn't for one thing more.
There was no continue
option on this version.
Really Line of Fire isn't
bad, it just looks
unnatural and
offers little real
entertainment at all.

program. The Commie
version cam along much
later, and really shows that
this is nothing more than a
budget game.
Piloting your
ﬁghter/groundcar you
need to swap between
vehicles to take out the
airborne menace and
frenetic than the last.
This is a game to play
with a friend (make him
play the jeep), and
represents pure
unadulterated destruction.

R
raised emplacements,
then get down and dirty
for the end of level alien.
Actually this was far too
hard and ruined the
original game, but is
thankfully easier here.
Decent vertical
scrolling, an inventive use
of the vehicles to swap
between, reasonable
music and FX, and the bas
relief graphics that were to
become a Bit Map trade
mark (even if they didn't
actually write this version)
combine to give you a
good blasting experience
with the odd novel twist.
Actually the game was
quite revolutionary when it
came out featuring some
spanking power ups,
ripper music and variety
aplenty. It only looks
dated now because

W
ell, I'll be
buggered. Or
should that be
bugged? Either way, I'll be
it after this tasty little fryup
from Harrovians
Audiogenic. It's the
company's ﬁrst ever
arcade conversion, and it
looks like being a biggie of
extremely large
proportions.
The arcade original
wasn't really amazing
enough for my liking. For
an arcade machine I felt
that it lacked something...
but anyway, that didn't
stop Audiogenic from
spotting its potential as a
wonderful 64 title and so
they snatched up the
rights.
And what a great job
they have made of it too.
There can be no doubting
the origins of this game.
The graphics are as close
to the arcade original as is
possible on the 64. This
was done by porting them
straight through a digitiser
and colouring them in with
the 64's pallette. Whilst our
faithful commies cannot
hope to match the 4096
colours that an arcade
wotsit can do the graphics
retain the look and feel of
the coin-greedy grandaddy
from which it was
spawned.
And if you thought that
was impressive then here's
an even bigger surprise.
The sound comes directly
sampled from the 16-bit
version! So now let your
Amiga-owning chums tell
you that the 64 can't do
sound as good as theirs!
Anyway, on to the game
itself. Life as a Human
being is great...all you do
is wander around wiping
out things. Imagine what
life would be like if you
were one of the things that
Humans like to kill most
often...bugs. Yep, the
nasty crawly things that
come in when it rains are
the subject of this little
game.
Well, the bugs in this
game are not taking that
attitude lying down,

prisoners! No, the Humans
in this game become the
hunted as the invaders try
to repell their enemies of
old.
Needless to say, you
play the part of a Human
who's been sent to destroy
these mutants of science.
To do this you come armed
only with a laser ﬁnger and
your wits (plus those of
your best friend, which still
adds up to nearly zero).
You have to take out as
many of the nasty basts by
swatting them, shooting
them or pounding them
with your ﬁst.
Swatting is great unless
you try it on a wasp as he
will most likely sting you.
Shooting things is a little
tricky as it requires thought
and judgement. So the
best method by far is to
curl up your ﬁst and pound
the crawly creeps into a
lovely squish on the carpet!
This colours the tile onto
which you squish with the
insect's blood and if you
colour in a line of the ever-
moving tiles you can
progress to the next room
of the house.
With loads of houses
inthe street and several
rooms in each house this
game is going to take a
long time to complete.
Addictive and a lot of fun
initially, it may pall after a
few hours but at best you
won't feel ripped
off. Should be a hit. • - • - •

DOUBLE
DRAGON
MASTERTRONIC
E2.99
Double Dragon features
the usual martial arts plot
of someones girlfriend
being kidnapped by the
Black Warriors, though
why anyone would kidnap
a street punks girlfriend
and then expend men,
money and equipment
defending her to the
death, while ultimately
putting their own neck on
the line, is a moot point.
What it means is that
the two Lee brothers,
either singularly or
together can leap, punch,
chop and beat their
way across
sprawling slums,
factories, suburbs,
and the Black
Warriors hideout for
a ﬁnal confrontation
with the infamous
Shadow Boss
(yawn, etc, etc).
This boils down to ﬁve
different scenarios, each
one very nicely presented.
As well as kicking
seven bells out of the
opposition you also have
access to all manner of
lethal weaponry. Boxes
can be thrown along with
knives, oil drums, and
baseball bats and whips
can be used to inﬂict
maximum damage.
All good and well in
theory, in practice it works
out very nicely, offering
great beat em up action
plus the variety of
different locations and
weapons. Once again this
is even more fun when
played as a simultaneous
two player game, since
you can cover each others
backs, or not as the case
may be.
Colourful and detailed
graphics, satisfying
beating, and ﬁve levels to
pound your way through.
Great stuff, especially at
this price.

After a succession of
action games, this is a
return to an Oxford
Digital Enterprises game
of 1986, which makes it
rather old and wrinkly.
Graphically it looks like
1986 too, but then since
this is a strategy game,
the graphics aren't that

Super Cars is a game
of racing for a
Championship through
nine races, with you
having to constantly ﬁnish
in the top three to
continue playing. Huh, it
wasn't like that for Alain
Prost was it. Anyway this
isn't too hard unless you
suffer from some sort of
motor neuron disease in
which case being a bookie
at a racecourse, or an
extra in a Kylie video is a
better proposition. It's not
too hard because there
are only ﬁve cars involved
to start with, so even
though you start off with a
clapped out wreck of a
sports car, with the turning
ability of a block of forged
steel, and the acceleration
of a sloth, you can pick
your way round the fairly
dull course to victory. Or a
top three position anyway.

hard is not the actual

down) but the picky sprite
detection, the effect of
collisions, and that you
have to learn the courses
to get round without
running into the walls. Hit
anything and your speed
drops to zero and you
lurch backwards.
This also has a
secondary effect. It
knackers your car. Yer
wheels get rated on
engine, tyres, fuel and
body, all of which
decrease as the races take
their toll. Luckily every
time you ﬁnish a race
there's some dosh in it for
you which you can spend
in a number of rather
exciting ways.
Either repair the car, or
trade it in and buy a new,
better version, or a new
set of wheels altogether,
or buy some armour,
rockets or performance
boosters like power
steering, turbo charger,
anti-skid kits, retros and
high speed kits. With the
missiles attached the
game starts to take on a
Badlands like feel, except
the race tracks are set in a
desert, supposedly.

Though if this is a desert
then my back garden is an
equatorial rain forest. It is
bland though, like white
toothpaste, it has no
ﬂavour, conjures no
imagery of racing beneath
the burning sun through
sand blasted terrain.
Ho hum, never mind,
the missiles are good fun,
but they cause an awful
mess, which you have to
avoid on following circuits.
The ﬁrst nine races you
can attempt in any order,
but all need to be
completed before you can
progress on to the next
stage. Manage that and
you get a password so you
don't have to do this
again, which brings us
back to the idea of a
driving championship. It
doesn't appear to be one
where you score points,
just surviving to the end is
the victory. Super Cars is
very like a Sega/Activison
game that came out last
year (it even looks as dull
as it), and more recently
the excellent Nitro (16 bit
only so far) which showed
how to really do this sort
of game. Still for all that it
is playable and
entertaining in a
pedestrian kinda way. In
fact since I'm a sucker for
these sort of games I'd go
as far as to say, it
isn't bad at all.
Graphically nothing to write home about, but
it offers an easy start and plenty of variety and
races to play through.

R
ﬁrst and only use
of the innuendo
about things between
your legs, so let's
concentrate on the latest
in an ever increasing line
of ofﬁcially produced
AD&D adventures. Or not.
While the idea of
computerised RPGs i s a
good one, and a friend of
mine is so wooden as a
DM you can't tell whether
the game is computer or
human moderated, why
oh why oh why must we
suffer these so called
action games. I mean the
ﬁrst one was truly
abysmal, and now we get
Dragon Strike, a game of
everyday 3-D dragon
combat. Personally I was
hoping this was going to
be a rendition of Joust,
but no such luck. It is a 3-
D game (though with
wobbly and ﬂickery
sprites, rather than any
difﬁcult scenery
manipulation), and you sit
on a dragon, trying to
breath on people.
There's a simple little
scene setter of a
storyline, which shows
the usual lack of
imagination. le. There you
are, on dragon picket
duty, just a fresh faced
kid new to world, hoping
to pull some real missions
rather than this back of
N
E
beyond duty when
waddya know, some
outriders go sailing by,
and in the true spirit of
torch ﬁrst, question later,
you set off to roast their
chestnuts.
Well, that's just the
ﬁrst mission, there are
plenty more beside, and it
has to be said the way the
attractive map plots your
course through the game,
listing position, then
introducing a little plot
before each animated
outburst is well done and
a much needed interlude
between, what are, quite
frankly, fairly poor combat
scenes.
You can play on
joystick and keyboard or
just keyboard only, but
make sure you spot the
addendum card since the
data card containing the
controls has its up and
downs the wrong way
round. This would be a
fatal discovery except
that your dragon
obviously doesn't have
power diving or climbing

available and
takes forever to
move up or down
so you can see
perfectly what's going
on.
As a ﬂedgling dragon
rider youa re  armed with
dragon spittle, lance,
sword and salves to ease
the beasties cuts, and a
band aid for yourself. In
the middle of a ﬁght it is
worth tending to your
wounds if your power is
running low. Simply
running out of power isn't
the only way to die
though, as when you get
into close combat
dogﬁghts the other
geezers are all trying to
knock you off your perch.
It takes some while for
you to hit the ground (or
water), but when you do
there's no walking away
from it.

From
a distance you
can torch people quite
happily, though the game
handles poorly and the
graphics are completely
unimpressive and
unconvincing. When into
close combat the system
falls ﬂat on its face,
delivering a monotonous
and tedious ﬂapping
experience.
The music, the static
graphics, the little bits of
plot between ﬂaps and
spits are all pretty good,
but you're paying for the
priviledge of ﬂying and
ﬁghting, and that is where
the game fails.
Stick to the RPGs

list would ever be correct as the release dates are set by the companies and
they are hardly ever met. The best we can offer you is the small 'Release Date'
section of the Credit Card.
Talking about the Credit Card, what we do is give graphics, sonics, ﬁx factor,
and half-life (lastability) a score out of ten, add them up, divide it by ten, times it
by 5 and throw the result in the bin and make up an overall score out of a
hundred on how good we personally think the game is. There you have it.

come from is 'Stick a rocket
up a cat's bottom and post
it through the neighbour's
letter box', that was always
a scream (well, more of a
high-pitched wail really)!
e) Only if you stuck a
Rolls Royce engine in it and
glued a couple of wings
either side. Anyway where
would you ﬁnd a pilot small
enough?
That's your lot, and
where your badge is now is
not what you should be
worrying about, it's where
it's been, if you know what I
mean.

Dear Doris,
My husband has recently
had a few problems with
his dicky ticker. Every
time we jumped up and
down on a plate of cold
lime jelly his machinery

think this has arrived at the
wrong magazine. I'll send it
on to Jelly User for you -
PA).
HEY DEMONA
My brother says that
you're a gitface and that
VC is a load of crap, but
he buys Sinclair User so
what would he know!
Anyway, the reason I
write is that I would like
to see demos of games
on your free cassette.
Some of the complete
games you give us are
good (Frosty The
Snowman, Rainbow
Chaser) but I would like
to sample a few full price
games before I buy them.
Other mags do this so
why can't you?
Derick Southern,
Macclesﬁeld
PA: As you can see we
have started given you
some hot demos of the
most recent games, and in
fact there'll be at least one
on every tape from now on.
The only prob is that to
accommodate for them we
have to lose a
corresponding number of
complete games, and the
value of the tape goes
down. Maybe we should
have a vote - complete the
form below and send it to
the usual PA address...

SOME
CONFUSION
I'm a 14 year old boy and
I've been a VC subscriber
since February 1990. I
would like to congratulate
you for the good work on
YC although I ask for
more colour...
But unfortunately I
haven't received (with or
without colour) the July
issue, can you solve my
problem?
Jorge Dias, lissoa
PA: Erm... Er... We never
published a July ish
although subscribers will still
receive the same number of
issues that was paid for.
POOLS OF
INTELLIGENCE
Thank you, thank you,
thank you.
As you might guess,
l'm extremely happy to be
receiving VC. We only
started getting it last
month and we couldn't be
happier with it, it's just
great.
The reviews are top of
the line and the posters
are truly stunning. And
Flame Head has got to be
the greatest hero ever.
On another note could
you please help me in an
adventure? I'm stuck on
Pools of Radiance with
the ghost in the library,
how do I kill him if I can?
Fred Gallo, Norseman,
Western Australia
PA: It's quite alhght, it's
quite alright, it's quite alright!
As you might guess,
we're extremely happy to be
receiving your cash, and
we're glad that you've got
the sense (and cents) to buy
the world's best C64 mag.
As for Pools of Radiance I'll
ask Paul Rigby to deal with it
in one of his columns.
By the way, Flame Head
a hero? Hah hah hah!!!

To keep Post Apocalypse busy
we're offring an assortment
of C64 games on

I'd rather review the dullest

Night Shift arrived from

terminally dull, to emerge
as fairly dull but not bad if
you like that sort of thing.
So the story goes, you
work in a factory producing
toys based on Lucasﬁlm
characters, and have to
make sure that the huge
piece of manufacturing
plant affectionately known
as BEAST (which is the
nickname for one of my
cats incidently) coughs up
the right amount and the
right type of toys every
shift. As you complete one

usually a good kicking.
Various tools abound to.

ranging from matches to
light the boiler to an

quickly descend the BEAST

judge all those jumps.
Naturally half of the game
consists of sorting out what
tool does what job. As you
may have guessed by now •
this is a platform game,
though thankfully the leaps
and jumps are easy to
execute. The fact that you
can move in the air after
you have jumped makes re-
adjustments easy and safe
landings virtually
guaranteed.
That's really about all
there is to this game, that

hummable jingle, average
graphics and reasonable
FX.
To me this looks like an
advert for Lucasﬁlm posing
as a game. Well, not
completely, but to be honest
this isn't the last word in
excitement, and you expect
even a platform game to be
a bit more interesting than
this. I know some people
who quite like the game,
without going overboard
about it. but I found Night
Shift to be a real chore. It's
like a washing up simulator.
Unlike the washing up, I
hope never to have to work
in a factory, and

DEMON-
STRATION
The Wrath of the Demon,
that Empire game that
we've been waiting so long
for, is almost with us and on
cart too.
The reason for this is
that the game is
supposedly SO large that
there was no way that it'd ﬁt
on a tape or disk, and if it
did it'd take absolutely
years to load each section
(and everybody knows what
a drag multi-loading is).
Also, as we all know, the
mass production of
cartridges takes a lot longer
than any other formats (ﬁve
weeks from master to ﬁnal),
so I'm afraid we'll just have
to wait.
Further news from
Empire states that the C64
version of Wild Streets (a
rather mediocre bash-em-
up) will also be converted to
cart in time for Easter.
NARCO VAN
BASTEN
Dinamics, the company
behind the ancient Army
Moves, has announced that
the company's ﬁrst C64
release for quite a while is
to come out for the Games
System.
Narco Police is a
strategy/arcade game
based in the year 2003, and
is a mix of 3-D 'Operation
Wolf' style gameplay with
top-down strategical
sections. You must inﬁltrate
a Narco Processing Lab
and blow it to kingdom
come, whilst completely
annihilating everything that
moves within.

The very mediocre S.T.U.N.

that this'll be Domark's
policy from now on.

when this game was released on
the Amiga, you'd ﬁnd yourself
having to push through the crowds
of people just to get to the C64
section, as they'd all be ogling at the
screen at the gorgeous graphics
and the very funky sound FX, but
most of them were just duped.
Because, like most games of the
time on the Amiga, the graphics and
son ics were in no way connected to
the gameplay. In fact it seemed as if
somebody had said, "This game
looks really good, but
don't you reckon we
should let the player do
something?", and
somebody else had
replied, "Nope!"

very little gameplay

This doesn't
mean that C64CS
SOTB is a disaster.
In fact it's quite an achievement, if
only for the fact that you know what
you're getting. And what you are
getting is a parallax scrolling ﬁnd-
em-up, as you trot along the
landscapes, searching for keys and
beating up monsters. Mappers will
have a ﬁeld day.
The graphics ARE pretty, if a little
too colourful, and the sonics do
churn out some funky beats, but the
whole affair is a tad boring for those
who would rather have a game that
would strain their joysticks. The
end-of-level monsters though will
probably give you the incentive to
persevere, if only to see how
ginormous they are.

T
his month sees,
what just might be,
a series on
publishing your own
fanzine - or, then again, it
might not. Basically,
because I'll be making this
up as I go along so I won't
know what'll turn up next
month. As it 'appens,
though, Mandy Rodrigues
- you know, the world
famous editor of
Adventure Probe - offered
me a crisp and a cheese
and pickle sandwich. So
while I tucked in she told
me all about her
c i
experiences
with her fanzine
complete with hints and
tips for beginners. I tried
to stop her but the Editor
told me never cast
obscenities with your
mouth full. So I opened a
can of Tango and listened,
with a furrowed brow, to a
stream of Welsh. If I had
had the YC Interpreter
there, which I didn't, this is
what he would have said,
"Got any more Tango?"
Oh, alright. ..after
that...during the
interpretation,
"I started editing Probe
on my C64 with a
Commodore MPS-801
printer, which had no true
descenders, no letter
quality or anything. After
reader's criticism
regarding the quality of
the print I bought a Citizen
120D."
So the ﬁrst rule for all
budding fanzine editors is
- make sure your readers
can actually read your
fanzine! An obvious point,
sure, but one that is too
often overlooked. In fact,
at one point before
obtaining the Citizen (a
good printer for the price),
Mandy typed one issue,
"...and I justiﬁed it as
well! Every page was
justiﬁed in the June 88
issue. Of course, making a
mistake when you're
typing is a
disaster!"
Initially, the Mandy
utilised Eaziscript,
"You'd have to be a
masochist to use that! It
took so long to do
anything with it. If you
wanted to centre anything
you had to enter CN:l.
Then you'd type what you
wanted to be centred and
then you'd have to type
CI\I:0 to switch it off
afterwards. You couldn't
see the results on the
screen, either,
you'd have to
wait
until it
was printing."

wordprocessor but it
didn't last long because
of memory shortages.
Protext, on the Amstrad
CPC is the present
system. Basically, if you
have a word processor
that you're happy with
then stick with it.
Otherwise, hang loose
'cause I'll be dipping into
the ins and outs of
hardware/software in a
later issue.
So what's the actual
process of producing a
fanzine. That is, according
to our Mandy? The nitty
gritty? Tell it like it is
Mandy,
-
would say, it doesn't
matter what machine I
use as long as I have
Protext to do it with. The
spelling checker is
essential, too. I usually
print out the text in bold,
near-letter quality,
sometime a double-strike
as well (but it can get a bit
blurry) on A4 paper and
then reduce it via a
copier. However, since
this last couple of months
I have changed to bold,
double-strike, compact,
near-letter quality with the
elite font. Then I changed
the word processor's ruler
to 95 characters instead
of 80, 44 lines of text
instead of 60 which all ﬁts
into, exactly. A5 size.
Which is much quicker
and cheaper as I don't
have to reduce printed
pages anymore."
So an ordinary A4 is
laid ﬂat on the desk and
all of the different pieces
of printed text are cut out
with a pair of scissors.
Any diagrams or headings
are sorted out too. After
that, the whole lot is stuck
onto the page with a
mixture of spray-on glue
(that you can unpeel and
re-position) and clear
tape (such as the Scotch
Magic Tape) to stick the
edges down and eliminate
page shadows. Tipex, for
example, costs a fortune
and you still see the
marks after copying. But
why do that old fashioned
leg-work when the
wonders of DTP are here?
Unfortunately, Mandy
doesn't really like DTP,
although she used
Timeworks on a ST to
include headings and so
on. Basically, because
she likes the in-built fonts.
Another reason though is
that, during a recent DIP
experimentation, a large
portion of the readership
complained because they
hated the style - so they
demanded the old style
back again!
Another lesson, here.
Listen to your readers! Do
not take the dictatorial
attitude. You know, "I'm
the editor and I know
best!", you will only lose
your readers that way.
So once one side of
the A4 sheet is pasted up
it is copied and then that
copy turned around ready
for the other side of text.
Then it's stapled and
stuck in an envelope.
Postage, you'll ﬁnd, is
a problem. The weight of
the mag will dictate how
many pages you include,
"I've gone up to 52
pages and it costs 27
pence an issue to send
out. Forty pages, you get
away with a ﬁrst or
second-class stamp. I'm
on 100 grams now. If I go
much more it'll cost me
32 pence for each issue.
My postage bill is getting
on for £200 per
month."
A general tip
to any budding
editors out there
is to thank the
readers. A note of
thanks for
contributions will be
much appreciated (you
can include it with the
next month's issue to
save postage). It's not
always possible. A not
every time someone
sends in a couple of lines
of text might be taking
things a bit far but
reasonable contributions

(page articles, for
example) will take a
contributor time and
effort.
Another good
tip?,
"I always
make sure that
new
subscribers
get mentioned
in Probe as soon
as possible. If you get a
letter or even a hint - put
it in the mag.
Interviews are always a
good thing. Besides the
initial questions, they do
not require too much
thought. After all, you can
print the type of interview
that recalls a large
portion of the
interviewees words.
Hence, you will ﬁnd
yourself blindly copying
what someone has said
for the majority of the
time. Saving time
o t h e r w i s e
quiet contemplation.
Whatever, you do, make
sure you have a steady
reserve stock. Even if you
have contributing writers.
You will, undoubtedly,
have dry months, with no
- or very little -
contributions. However,
when you do receive
contributions let your
contributors know exactly
how much you appreciate
it with a short note of
thanks. Even if the
contribution is drivel -
never put anyone off. As
Mandy says,
"What are editors for?
You can take a very badly
spelt letter, or the
grammar can be
absolutely dreadful and
correct it. I do get the
odd like that one from the
very, very young. They've
got something to say and
they might not know how
to say it. You know what
they mean and you can
write it in your own
words."
One of the principle
pieces of advice from
Mandy, though, was that
any editor of a fanzine
must be,
"...dedicated and must
be able to meet
deadlines. Sometimes it
can be very difﬁcult. But
you can't play games. A
lot of young people come
along and decide to set
up a user group or club or
something and they play
at it. They get a couple of
issues done, they don't
work at it and the whole
thing falls by the wayside.
People have to know that
you're reliable. You have
to release an issue,
without fail, every single
month. Other wise they
will be less likely to send
you yearly subscriptions
(or re- new them) if it's
unreliable."
So dedication is the
word, chaps. Ask Roy
Castle.
One of the biggest
problems with a fanzine
production is the price. It
is not worth running at a
loss for the sake of an
attractive price. Don't
forget there is such a
thing as "perceived
value". That is, if you sell
a fanzine for ten pence
some people might say,
"Ugh, can't be much
good at that price". Also,
you will not enjoy dipping
into your own pocket. So
count up everything that
contributes to the cost of
the magazine - for a
whole year. Then divide
the whole lot by 12. When
I say "everything" I mean
it. From photo-copier
costs and postage to
printer ribbons and pens.
Add it all up. On the other
hand, you can forget
about becoming Robert
Maxwell in a matter of
months. Do not add a
margin for proﬁt, unless
you want to turn the
fanzine into a serious
business. Even then,
however, be careful not
to set the price too high
that you'll scare everyone
away.
Mandy also had other
tips such as shopping
around for supplies.
Colleges buy their paper
by the palette, for
example. Making it very
cheap. If you asked
nicely, maybe you could
be some off them. It may
work out vastly cheaper
than your local stationers.
Other supplies may be
bought in this way. Luck
plays a part in ﬁnding a
good bargain, though.
Finally, if you want to
ﬁnd out just why Mandy
Rodrigues' Adventure
Probe fanzine, the mag
for all people interested
in computer-based
adventures of all kinds, is
so successful then why
not buy a sample copy to
see how it's done? Just

COMPUTER INDUSTRY BOFF0 1991
In the ﬁrst heat of YC's ship-riveting no-celebrity quiz, we ﬁnd out exactly how humiliatingly little PR people know
about the industry in which they toil. Ranged against each other: The foremost PR brains of the industry (or at
least those who'd got back from lunch when we called).
JOYSTICK ROUND-UP
MY NAME
Please mister newsagent,
reserve a copy of YC for me
every month. In return I'll hand
over my rather crucial pocket money
although it pains me to do so, and
I wouldn't do it for any old crappy magazine.
MY ADDRESS
Giv e  t his  t o y o u r  loc a l p a p e r  s h o p  b e f o r e  It  b l o w s  a wa y !
(Whiperackl) "Rawhide"! It's the last round-up as Rik and Ades play with their joysticks for the thrill of you,
the reader. Can the games-playing hardware take it as the intrepid two "Wiggle it, just a little bit"?!
VET AGAIN: LOTS OF FABBO, SKILLO, GAMES REVIEWS
"...As Rick stared at the full colour reviews that glared from the page, he gasped "How
can we possibly ﬁt so many stonking games into one humble magazine?" But he
came through, weathered the storm and..." Well, you'll just have to read the next
issue.
YC April '91 - More invigorating than an acid bath without those
messy bathroom stains.
(Natch, we reserve our right to
upgrade/downgrade/Michael Grade the
mag's contents whenever we damn well
please, should we feel like it because
we're that sort of people - well

a s t month I began a
new, occasional,
series looking back
at those adventures that
you may have missed,
especially if you are new
to the world of
adventures. A service
that, I hope, will provide
you with a ready supply
of adventures now that
the shops have reduced
or eliminated adventure
stock altogether.
This month as
promised, I will begin a
similar series devoted to
RPGs. The ﬁrst subject to
come under the
microscope (the YC
model with the jam on
the lens) is the Bard's
Tale series from
Interplay.
BARD'S TALE

unashamedly, hack'n

number of puzzles but
most of them are based
on the password theme.
However, as long as you
approach the series in
the way that it was
designed, a slash'n bash,
you will have a ripping
time. You'll have to mop
up your C64 after every
session, mind you, the
blood tends to get into all
of those little crevices.
In Bard's Tale 1 the
evil wizard is Mangor
whose ichor- stained
claws have ensnared the
once fair town of Skara
Brae. To exterminate this
vermin your dirty half-
dozen warriors and
mages have to plod every
square inch of the town
and its sixteen 22 x 22
mazes. Character classes
also include monks,
bards, rogues and
paladins. You can "roll
your own" or bring in
seasoned dragon slayers
from any of the Wizard rys
or Ultimas. The bard is
the interesting character
in the game. This cheeky

window during the fray,
minimally animated with
groping claws, blinking
eyes, dragons spraying
ﬁreballs across the
screen and so on. After a
victorious battle you may
be awarded experience
points outright. In the
mazes, however, you've
usually got to cope with
unlocked chests that are
often booby-trapped. The
mazes aren't stacked on
top of each other as in
some games but
scattered all over the
town. One is six or seven
levels deep while another
takes the form of a
castle.
Bard's Tale 1 will take
you a long time to
complete and will, due to
its tricky mazes, turn
many players into
throbbing, rather moist,
jellies.
Bards Tale 2 built on
the success of the
original. With more
mazes (25), more cities
(six), more monsters
(over 100 kinds), a huge
wilderness, a bank and a
casino where you play
blackjack BT2 succeeded
in increasing the number
of mental breakdowns
recorded in the UK
during the year of its
release, 1987. For the
mages there were 79 new
spells and a new magic
class. Also a Sage makes
an appearance, you can
ask him questions.
Monsters may be
summoned and made
permanent members of
the party.
The plot revolves
around the Destiny Wand
which held the peace in
the Realm for centuries.
Lagoth Zanta, an evil
Archmage, stole the
Wand and smashed it into
seven pieces, then
scattered them to
different locations. As a
result, mercenaries from
the neighbouring
kingdom of Lestradae are
running in muck, sorry, I
mean running amok. So
ﬁnd the Wand after
bashing Zanta and then
re-unify the Realm. The
beginning of the game is
easier than the original
but, in the long-run,
becomes harder!
Especially with the
introduction of ranged
combat (you can use
spears and bows). which
applies to spells as well
as weapons. Puzzles are
also harder (some have
time limits). Graphics are
about the same in quality.
The ﬁnal (for now)
installment, sub-titled the
"Thief of Fate" saw many
improvements, including
new character classes
and spells, a wider

All in all, the Bard's
Tale series was an
excellent system that still
entertains many a RPG
fan. The UK distributors,
Electronic Arts, tell me
that only the disk
versions of Bard's Tale 2
and 3 are still available
from them. However, if
you shop around you
should still be able to
ﬁnd Bard's Tale 1. If you
missed this series I highly
recommend them. In fact,
the Bard's Tale series
were largely responsible
for sparking the high
interest in RPGs within
the UK as a whole. If you
can't ﬁnd Bard's Tale 2

Mining is not worth the

valuable time and effort.
Silly really as it brings
little dosh for your
labour. When boarding
ships don't forget to use
projectile weapons and
then raid the armory
which is always in the
same place. Grab the
haul (especially the
tessalator) and then sell
the lot. Incidently, the
strange items such as

holophones may be
pretty but they're pretty
useless too. Sell them.

Food is a big problem at
the start of the game,
mainly because stealing
is a no-no. The only thing
for it is to keep your
party small, initially, and
sell non-essential items.
You could hang around
bridges and take a stroll
at night to ﬁnd a few
monsters to kill. Have
your most intelligent
character do the buying
and selling. If there are
any beginners out there
who still can't ﬁnd the
dungeons, look in the
mountains for little piles
of boulders.

OPERATION
THUNDERBOLT
A ﬂash from the past here
(but we've had loads of
letters about it recently),
and Richard Oakley offers
a full guide of how to play
it - and wins a crispy
tenner for the trouble.
Level I
Keep your aim in the
middle of the screen and
then move left and right to
kill the soldiers. It is
advisable to hold down
the ﬁre button, if you're a
beginner, for more
accurate shooting.
Kill the helicopters with
a rocket. You should
complete this level without
losing a life.
Level 2
Remember, the enemy's
bullets cannot harm you if
they're on the opposite
side of the screen, so
don't panic. Concentrate
your ﬁre on the far edge of
your own side.
Level 3
This level is almost
impossible without using
the continue options.
Tanks are lethal because
there are so many of them.
If things get crowded, use
a rocket. You only need
one bullet to destroy a
mine or ground-to-air
missile.
Level 4
Accurate aiming is vital to
rescue the hostages. If a
hostage gets in the way,
shoot him.
The heavily armed
ofﬁcer is not as tough as
he looks. Be prepared for
him coming from the right,
hold the ﬁre button and
follow him around 'tit he
dies. Also, try shooting
him in the head.
Level 5
Same rules apply as for
level 3.
Level 6
The men hanging from the
top are lethal, so wipe
them out ﬁrst. Don't be
afraid to use your rockets
and when the end-of-level
ofﬁcer appears, shoot him
in the head.
Level 7
Same as level 3.
Level 8
This one is a test of your
reﬂexes, as the opponents
come rushing towards
you. In the ﬁnal shoot out,
stay to the left of the
hostage, hold down the
ﬁre button and blow the
man's head off.

Neon junkies and
serious business
types in John Major-
style grey suits mixed
freely at last month's
Arcade Trades
Exhibition
International, or ATEI
to its friends. Many of
the new games for
1991 were displayed
by proud
manufacturers in said
suits who strolled up
and down, holding
meetings with other
people in suits while
the serious business
of playing the things
was left to
professionals like
myself and any other
degenerates that had
been let in.
, p a r t  from the
arcade games
(reviews of which
follow), there were some
other, slightly odd, arcade
attractions to be spotted.
Talking frogs are, you have
to admit, not the kind of
thing you expect to see as
you pop down Varcade.
Yet a company called
Glasdon have made one; it
rolls its eyes, puffs its
cheeks and, er, speaks in a
sad but rather booming
voice. It does need
someone to work it,
though - out from the back
of this one came a
Glasdon executive who
seemed to relish being a
talking frog.
Over at the back of the
show was "the sensational
'fast draw' gun ﬁght", for
those who thrill out over
High Noon-type situations.
Two people get holsters

strapped to their sides and
are asked to draw their
guns when a green light
comes on. A computerised
scoreboard announces the
draw times and who
managed them. No, no
blood but you can't have
people dying in nice clean
arcades, can you?
"Kentucky Derby" was
a load of balls... which had
to be thrown into different-
value holes as often as
possible to move one of
twelve racing camels. Fast
and furious, the race is
won by the seated ball-
thrower who manages the
quickest and highest ball
score.
And weighing
machines? Get outta
here...!
MEANWHILE,
OVER ON
THE
SCREENS...
•F E

Ati
Possibly the most
immediately challenging
and fun game of the whole
event, this new Atari
offering appears to have
crossed Tetris with Missile
Command and infused
shrewd strategy and
massive killer
add ictiveness to make
something of an
unexpected stonker.
Up to three players go
through three short stages.
Stage one is the building of
fortiﬁed walls around little
castles with randomly-
arriving Tetris-style blocks.
A castle has to be
completely surrounded by
walls or the player loses a
life and, later on, any
cannons they have
managed to acquire.
Stage two sees each
player positioning cannons
within their fort walls and
Stage Three sees the
Missile Command-style
section as players move
their cannon sights (with a
Trackerball) over enemy
walls and blast them away.
The demolition achieved
depends on how many
cannons players have t h e
more cannons a player
has, the more damage they
can wreak.
And so back to the
rebuilding phase until a
player can't rebuild any
more. The time limit is

co
competitively set and the
game is just so damn
addictive, I could hardly
tear myself away.
Yes! It's this year's Beast
Busters but... in space. As
you progress around some
sort of base, so many
varieties of squiggly alien
life rush toward you, just
begging to be blown to
their alien afterlives.
Life force is quite
generous and the action
fast and furious but, snore,
another Operation Wolf-
style game? Help!
I remember the heady
days of 1979 (picture turns
rippled and dreamy to the
sound of a harp being
strummed up and down)
when there was a Space
Invaders machine at the
local swimming baths. It
sat in the comer and made
those strange 'phveed'
shooting sounds and the
'thump-thump-thump'
sound of those Invaders
getting gradually closer to
home, punctuated by the
'woo-000-000' sound of
ﬂying saucers.
And with 1991 comes
the remix of the original.
This time the display is
enhanced by static
backdrops and the aliens
and gun have been
slightly tweaked.
After a few levels on
Earth, the action moves to
space and the aliens

change shape and
characteristics. They're
also damn fast and damn
mean. They truly whizz
down the screen at the
end of a wave.
The best new section
is the 'cattle stealing'
section. Flying saucers
swoop from the sky and
attempt to carry away
little cows from the
bottom of the screen.
Bizarre!
San Francisco seems a
great place for a road race.
And what if you didn't have
to worry about getting a
speeding ticket? What if
you were in a Police car
race. Yes, yes yes!
So you get to bum through
the hilly environs of San
Francisco. It's all fast-
paced action due to the
speed and the trams & cars
that get in the way, no
matter how much you honk
your horn. You also have to
turn the odd 90 degree
comer which takes you
onto a different stretch of
road.
'Cisco Heat is not merely
a novel twist to the road
race game but a genuinely
enjoyable and colourful
game.
Finally (and, I'm afraid,
without a picture) there was
Trog, tucked away on one
of the huge stands. The
game idea was classic Pac-
inspired stuff but with some
enjoyable graphic twirls.
You play one of four
dinosaurs (three other
people can play
simultaneously) and you
have to tromp around a
screen-size maze
landscape and collect a
load of dinosaur eggs
before racing to a suddenly-
revealed home square.
Little prehistoric guys
with clubs - Trogs - try to
stop you by chasing your
poor dinosaur and
attempting to batter him/her
with clubs. You can get
your own back by
chomping pineapples which
turn a humble Dino into a
rampaging, Trog-munching,
Tyrannosaurus Rex.
The graphics look as if
they've been digitised from
plasticine models and have
that Morph (remember
him?)-like quality to them.
They're really sweet too.
When a level has been
completed, the dinosaur
that got 'home' ﬁrst gets
zoomed to screen size and
performs an animated
dance or plays air-guitar.
Rock on... Chomp!

victory in both human lives
and sheer cash. And now
that the Gulf war has been
forced upon us like
Christopher Timothy's arm
up a surprised cow's
bottom in 'All Creatures
Great and Small', the
money that has been spent
up to now (exactly a week
after 'Operation Desert
Storm' had started at time
of writing) is quite
phenomenal.
For instance, it costs
almost 1 million
squideroonies for a cruise
missile (and we were ﬁring
them off at about the rate
of one every 30 minutes)
and one plane could cost
anything from 20 million
quid. If we were to tot up
how much money it would
cost to buy the equipment
that is used in SWIV, the
total would be a sum of
wonga that even the United
States would ﬁnd hard to
ﬁnd (although McDonalds
probably makes that much
in one day - and that's just
the Chipping Ongar
branch).
This is because there's
more high-tech weaponry
thrown at you in two
seconds than in two world
wars. And added to that the
sheer number of bullets
that you spit at the enemy
in the course of the game
would keep several
ammunition suppliers in
work for the rest of their
lives.
But this is all paramount
to the fact that SWIV is a
dam good blaster, and
needs a plethora of spikey
things all raining down at
you at ridiculous speeds to
give the hardened
gamesplayer a challenge in
today's shoot-ern-up. And
SWIV is certainly today's
smeg-em-and-let-em-be-
grateful-for-it-em-up, and
yesterday's and next
week's, and probably even
next century's.
Firstly, you could count
the amount of decent
vertically scrolling shooties
on one stump, and even
the mightily revered Xenon
was a tad mediocre on the
commie. With this track
history of poor up-the-
screen blasters how could
Storm fail to better the best
of the bin fodder. The funny
thing is though that not
only has the company
bettered it, it's taken the
whole game idea chucked
it in the oven at gas mark
ﬁve and baked it into
something quite splendidly
different.
The ideas aren't that
new for the shooty genre,
mainly because a lot of the
gameplay is based upon
the bestselling
Silkworm
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 %
game
also
programmed
by The Sales Curve -
for Virgin Mastertronic), and
SWIV too features a duel
player mode in the form of
either being able to play a
tank or a jeep. It is here that
the unique part comes in.
To my knowledge, no
other game uses the multi-
plex method as concisely
as SWIV. What this means
is that the helicopter ﬂies
over all objects but is able
to shoot everything,
whereas the jeep cannot
pass through buildings,
walls, etc., and the airborne
enemy sprites ﬂy straight
over it. Sometimes there
are even obstacles that the
jeep can go under, and
some that it must jump
over to continue. This
allows for some very varied
gameplay when there are
two personages crammed
around the screen,

although if only one player
wants to have a crack they
are forced to play the
chopper.
The rest of the
gameplay is pretty much
standard. There are four
levels in which you must ﬂy
up the screen and smeg
the frag out of everything in
your way. And at the end of
each level is a giant
guardian in the shape of
progressively bigger army
establishments.
Along the way you
occasionally get to pick up
a bubble which will encase
you in a sort-of force ﬁeld,
allowing you to be
indestructible for a few
seconds, or alternatively
you could shoot it a few
times and it acts as a smart
bomb, annihilating
everything on screen.
Also there are giant
robot helicopters that often
appear, and they explode
when you've pumped a fair
amount of lead into their
belly. As soon as they
disappear they leave
behind several weapon
tokens that cycle through
four different types of
bonuses when you shoot
them. It is through these
that you obtain the most
awesome kind of ﬁrepower
that has ever been seen in
a shooty (the ﬁve-way
spreading shot), and if both
players have the same
power, the screen lights up
in a blaze of mega-death.
In SWIV Storm has
followed up the excellent St
Dragon with an amazingly
better game. The graphics,
although as commie 64 as
they come, move like
they've got a SCUD missile
up their butts, and at times
there are so many sprites
on screen at one time that
only the fastest hand can
get you out of it with your
life intact. And it's speed
that makes a good shoot-
em-up into a great one. If
you do decide to buy SM.,
you'll pull out a few hairs in
frustration when your
chopper explodes in a ball
of ﬂame, but if you don't
you'll end up bald when
you realise what
you're missing.

The Helicopter - This mean beauty
can ﬂy over just about everything,
and it's military capability is second
to none. When people say that
they're afraid of your chopper this is
what they're talking about.
mar
The Jeep - A small bundle of
metal fun that bums around
on the ground blasting
everything that moves (and
some things that don't). It
has a gun turret on it's back
that can be locked in any
direction that you like,
allowing you to ﬁre at those
diagonally difﬁcult nasties.
The Speedboat - When
water comes along, the
bloke in the jeep leaps out
and into this moist death-
dealer. It has essentially
the same capabilities as
the helicopter, as it is only
able to ﬁre to the front.

little beauty won
Gremlin the In-Din

when something as
prestigeous as an In-Din
award is given to an
original product, you can
be guaranteed that ﬂoods
of similarly named
licenses are not only
'round the corner, but
they're heading this way at
breakneck speed. How
long will it be, for instance,
before 'Jaguar Team

'Triumph Two-Seater

we can do without 'Reliant
Robin - Death On Three
Wheels'.
But let's enjoy Lotus

whilst it's unique. Firstly it
allows two drivers to
compete against each
other, at the same time.
This is done using a rather
splendid split-screen
system where the viewing
area is split into two
halves with a player

this isn't THAT new, it is

way, and the action,
speed and graphical
qualities have not suffered
one iota.
