Preface 
The world of mobile and wireless networks is only 10 years old, 
but is still expanding and evolving. Instead of settling in to a steady 
state, the changes are accelerating. The upcoming 3 to 5 years will 
expand on the current developments under 5G. This book aims to 
present the state-of-the-art in the field of mobile and wireless 
networks, and to anticipate the arrival of new standards and 
architectures. 
After a description of the existing standards, mainly 2G, 3G and 
LTE, this book addresses LTE-A, which is the first 4G release, and 
provides a first indication of 5G as seen through the normalizing 
bodies. 
4G technology is described in detail with the different LTE 
extensions related to the arrival of femtocells, the increase to 1 Gbps 
capacity, and relay techniques. 5G is also discussed to show what can 
be expected in the near future, and more precisely. A chapter is 
devoted to “small cells” that allow offloading techniques for 
discharging large antennas, and enable heterogeneous networks 
through integration with the normal macrocell. 
Subsequently, the book focuses on wireless networks, starting  
with small personal area networks and progressing to very large

wireless regional area networks, via local area networks dominated by 
WiFi technology, and finally metropolitan networks. Current personal 
area networks are described through Bluetooth and new types of 
wireless networks such as WiGig. The WiFi family continues to 
expand and all new members are described. 
The Internet of Things is explained in a specific chapter due to its 
omnipresence in the literature. The forecast anticipates 100 billion 
connected devices by 2020. But standardized architectures and 
protocols are limited, which makes this field a very dense area  
with numerous proprietary networks. This book provides a  
simplified vision that ultimately makes the Internet of Things easy to 
understand. 
Ad hoc and mesh networks are important as they have made a 
comeback after a long period of near hibernation. New and significant 
progress has been made in the field of algorithms that allows such 
networks to run smoothly while providing high quality service. 
The last chapter discusses mobile edge computing (MEC) servers. 
These servers, placed close to users at the edge of the network, 
provide a cloud, signifying decentralization towards data centers 
which are much smaller than the leading cloud providers. These 
servers should be used to support all the associated algorithms for 
accessing networks, user data management, virtual machine storage 
and secure communication access. MEC is becoming more and more 
important with the massive scale of Internet traffic. Concentration of 
data and computing in a global cloud is becoming impractical; the 
world of connectivity is moving towards distributed data centers and 
MEC servers. 
This book describes the development of wireless and mobile 
networks and how they will evolve in the future. The book is not 
exhaustive, because the field is vast and still expanding,

but we hope it will be useful to the reader who wants to understand 
wireless networks, major innovations in the field, and current by 
manufacturer, operator and cloud provider actions.

Introduction to Mobile and Networks 
The development of mobile and wireless communications was 
traditionally viewed as a sequence of successive generations. The first 
generation of analog mobile telephony was followed by the second or 
digital generation. The third generation enables full multimedia data 
transmission as well as voice communications. The fourth generation 
is 
completely 
Internet 
Protocol 
(IP)-based, 
including 
voice 
communications, and increases the throughput in parallel to these 
activities related to the evolution of current fourth-generation (4G) 
wireless technologies. There is also increased research effort on future 
radio access, referred to as fifth-generation (5G) radio access. Such 
future radio access is anticipated to take the performance and service 
provisioning of wireless systems a step further, providing data rates of 
up to 200 Mbps with wide-area coverage and up to 1 Gbps with local-
area coverage. 5G technologies are being focused on as it is expected 
to eventually deliver approximately 10 Gbps. This can be considered 
as a normal evolution in response to increased user behavior, demand 
and quality of service (QoS) expectations. 
In this chapter, we provide a brief overview of mobile and wireless 
networks (MWN). The objective is to present the background and 
context necessary for understanding subsequent chapters. We  
review the history of MWN, enumerate their applications and compare

them in order to see the effect of such technology not only on the 
market drivers but also on research domain areas. 
1.1. Mobile and wireless generation networks 
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) launched 
International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT-2000) as an initiative 
to cover high-speed, broadband and IP-based mobile systems 
featuring 
network-to-network 
interconnection, 
feature/service 
transparency, global roaming and seamless services independent of 
location. IMT-2000 aims to bring high-quality mobile multimedia 
telecommunications to a worldwide mass market by increasing the 
speed and ease of wireless communications, responding to problems 
due to increased demand to pass data via telecommunications, and 
providing “anytime, anywhere” services. 
Two partnership organizations were born out from the ITU–IMT-
2000 
initiative: 
the 
Third 
Generation 
Partnership 
Project 
(www.3gpp.org) and the Third Generation Partnership Project 2 
(www.3gpp2.org). The 3GPP and 3GPP2 developed their own version 
of 2G, 3G and later mobile systems. In parallel, the Institute of 
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) was developing proper 
versions of the wireless networks that can be compared functionally 
with those of 3GPP and 3GPPP2 and their technology-based 
generations can be crossed with those of 3GPP and 3GPP2. Their 
terminologies are different but the goal is the same, which is to 
develop new technologies that make use of advances in the area of 
wireless and mobile technologies. This is why, we will summarize all 
the generations developed by these organizations as a path of 
evolution in the world of mobile and wireless networking. 
1.1.1. First generation mobile technology: 1G 
First-generation cellular networks (1G) were analog-based and 
limited to voice services and capabilities. Compared to today’s  
 
 

Introduction to Mobile and Networks     3 
technology, 1G technology was vastly inferior. In the late 1970s and 
early 1980s, various 1G cellular mobile communication systems were 
introduced; the first such system, the Advanced Mobile Phone System 
(AMPS) was introduced in the United States in the late 1970s. Other 
1G systems include the Nordic Mobile Telephone System (NMTs) 
and the Total Access Communications System (TACS). While these 
systems offer reasonably good voice quality, they provide limited 
spectral efficiency. The evolution toward 2G was thus necessary to 
overcome the drawback of such technology. 
1.1.2. Second generation mobile technology: 2G 
The second-generation (2G) digital systems promised higher 
capacity and better voice quality than their analog counterparts. The 
two widely deployed 2G cellular systems are Global System for 
Mobile Communications (GSM) and Code Division Multiple Access 
(CDMA) that was originally known as American Interim Standard 95, 
or IS-95 and is now called cdmaOne. Both the GSM and CDMA 
camps formed separate 3G partnership projects (3GPP and 3GPP2, 
respectively) to develop IMT-2000-compliant standards based on  
the CDMA technology. GSM differs from 1G by using digital  
cellular technology, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) 
transmission methods and slow-frequency hopping for voice 
communication. In the United States, 2G cellular standardization 
process utilized direct-sequence CDMA with phase-shift keyed 
modulation and coding. 
There was an evolution of main air interface-related enhancements 
to GSM: (1) higher data-rates for circuit-switched services through 
aggregation of several time-slots per TDMA frame with high-speed 
circuit-switched data (HSCSD); (2) general packet radio service 
(GPRS), which had efficient non-real-time packet-data traffic support. 
GPRS reached peak data rates of up to 140 Kbps when a user 
aggregated all timeslots; and (3) enhanced data rates for global 
evolution (EDGE) increased data rates up to 384 Kbps with high-level  
 
 

4     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
modulation and coding within the existing carrier bandwidth of  
200 kHz. 
1.1.3. Third generation mobile technology: 3G 
Further evolution of the GSM-based systems is handled under 
3GPP to define a global 3G Universal Mobile Telecommunications 
System (UMTS). The main component of this system is the UMTS 
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) based on Wideband 
Code Division Multiple Access (WCDMA) radio technology, since it 
uses 5 MHz bandwidth and GSM/EDGE Radio Access Network 
(GERAN) based on (GSM) enhanced data rates. 
3GPP2 implemented CDMA2000 in the 1.25 MHz bandwidth, 
which increased voice and data services and supported a multitude of 
enhanced broadband data applications, such as broadband Internet 
access and multimedia downloads. This technology also doubled user 
capacity over cdmaOne, and with the advent of 1xRTT, packet data 
was available for the first time. 
The 3GPP2 first introduced high-rate packet data (HRPD), termed 
CDMA20001xEV-DO. This standard enables high-speed, packet-
switched techniques designed for high-speed data transmissions, 
enabling peak data rates beyond 2 Mbps. 1xEV-DO expanded the 
types of services and applications available to end users, enabling 
carriers to broadcast more media-rich content. 
The 3GPP enhanced the WCDMA system, providing high-speed 
downlink packet access (HSDPA) that brought spectral efficiency for 
higher speed data services in 2001. Then, High-Speed Uplink Packet 
Access (HSUPA) was introduced in 2005. The combination of 
HSDPA and HSUPA is called HSPA. The latest HSPA is HSPA+, 
which resulted from adding multiple input/multiple output (MIMO) 
antenna capability and 16QAM (Uplink)/64QAM (Downlink) 
modulation. Coupled with improvements in the radio access network 
for continuous packet connectivity, HSPA+ allows uplink speeds of 
11 Mbps and downlink speeds of 42 Mbps. 

Introduction to Mobile and Networks     5 
As the successor of CDMA2000, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO Release 0 
provides peak speeds of up to 2.4 Mbps with an average user 
throughput of between 400 and 700 Kbps. The average uplink data 
rate is between 60 and 80 Kbps. Rel. 0 makes use of existing Internet 
protocols, enabling it to support IP-based connectivity and software 
applications. In addition, Release 0 allows users to expand their 
mobile experience by enjoying broadband Internet access, music and 
video downloads, gaming and television broadcasts. 
1xEV-DO Release 0 has been revised to produce Revision A  
(Rev-A), which increases peak rates on reverse and forward links to 
support a wide-variety of symmetric, delay-sensitive, real-time, and 
concurrent voice and broadband data applications. It also incorporates 
orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) technology 
to enable multicasting (one-to-many) for multimedia content delivery. 
As the successor of Rev-A, 1xEV-DO Revision B (Rev-B) introduces 
dynamic bandwidth allocation to provide higher performance by 
aggregating multiple 1.25 MHz Rev-A channels. 
1.1.4. Fourth generation mobile technology: 4G 
Fourth-generation or 4G technologies allow wireless carriers to 
take advantage of greater download and upload speeds to increase the 
amount and types of content made available through mobile devices. 
4G networks are using full IP solutions that deliver voice, data  
and multimedia content to mobile users anytime and almost anywhere. 
They offer greatly improved data rates over previous generations of 
wireless technology. Faster wireless broadband connections enable 
wireless carriers to support higher-level data services, including 
business applications, streamed audio and video, video messaging, 
video telephony, mobile TV and gaming. 
As a step toward 4G mobile broadband wireless, 3GPP began its 
initial investigation of the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard as a  
 
 
 
 

6     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
viable technology in 2004. LTE offers a number of distinct advantages  
over other wireless technologies including increased performance 
attributes, such as: 
– high spectral efficiency; 
– very low latency; 
– it supports variable bandwidths; 
– simple protocol architecture; 
– compatibility and interworking with earlier 3GPP releases; 
– interworking with other systems, e.g. cdma2000; 
– Frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex 
(TDD) within a single radio access technology; 
– efficient multicast/broadcast. 
Ultra-Mobile Broadband (UMB), for the cdma2000 cellular 
telecommunications system, is run under the auspices of 3GPP2. The 
UMB  cellular telecommunications system offers many new features 
and techniques that enable it to fulfill high expectations, and compete 
with other new and emerging technologies: 
– data rates of over 275 Mbps in the downlink (base station to 
mobile) and over 75 Mbps in the uplink (mobile to base station); 
– uses an OFDM / OFDMA air interface; 
– uses FDD; 
– possesses an IP network architecture; 
– has a scalable bandwidth between 1.25 and 20 MHz 
(OFDM/OFDMA systems are well suited for wide and scalable 
bandwidths); 
– supports flat, mixed and distributed network architectures. 
 
 

Introduction to Mobile and Networks     7 
Despite this, UMB technology was abandoned in favor of  
3GPP 4G. 
1.1.5. Fifth generation mobile technology: 5G 
Studies carried out by industry players and academic into the  
actual use of the Internet by users led to the development of 5G. 
Efforts converged to fix a general view about this technology 
including very high data rates everywhere with low latency of  
end-to-end communication due to ultra-reliability and availability. 
Such technology is promising up to 10 Gbps and can even reach 100 
Mbps in situations of indoor communication in urban or suburban 
areas. 
The definition of the technology can be represented by the 
evolution of LTE Advanced itself, but some evolution in terms of 
utilization of spectrum, higher frequency bands and advanced multi-
antenna 
transmission 
techniques, 
and 
different 
kinds 
of 
communications can be included in this technology such as device-to-
device communication with flexible spectrum usage. 
1.2. IEEE technologies 
LTE is not the only solution for delivering broadband  
mobile services. Several proprietary solutions, particularly for  
fixed applications, are already on the market. There are  
standards-based 
alternative 
solutions 
that 
at 
least 
partially  
overlap with LTE, particularly for portable and mobile applications.  
In the near term, the most significant of these alternatives are  
3G cellular systems and IEEE 802.11-based WiFi systems. In this 
section, we compare and contrast the various standards-based 
broadband wireless technologies and highlight the differentiating 
aspects of LTE. 

8     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
1.2.1. IEEE 802.15: WPAN 
Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) or short-distance 
wireless networks focus on communication and interoperability  
among of devices operating under the WPAN. One of the first 
technologies based on this standard was Bluetooth, which is based on 
IEEE 802.15.1. However, this standard evolved to include low power 
consumption with a higher data rate such as Zigbee technology or 
standard IEEE 802.15.3 targeting a higher data rate intended for point-
to-point close-proximity communication including kiosk downloading 
and intradevice communication just like wireless data centers and 
wireless backhauling. Accordingly, some forums were founded within 
the IEEE working group itself in order to provide a higher speed ultra-
wideband  (UWB) for applications, which involved imaging and 
multimedia. As a result of all these standards and technologies based 
on these standards, WiMedia Alliance was created to be responsible 
for the adoption, regulation, standardization and multi-vendor 
interoperability of UWB technologies. 
1.2.2. IEEE 802.11: WLAN 
The Wireless Fidelity (WiFi)-based-system is used to provide 
broadband wireless. It is based on the IEEE 802.11 family of 
standards and is primarily a local area networking (LAN) technology 
designed to provide in-building broadband coverage. Current WiFi 
systems based on IEEE 802.11a/g support a peak physical-layer  
data rate of 54 Mbps and typically provide indoor and outdoor 
coverage over a few 1000 m2, making them suitable for enterprise 
networks and public hot spot scenarios such as airports and hotels. 
WiFi offers remarkably higher peak data rates than 3G systems, 
primarily since it operates over a larger 20 MHz bandwidth. The 
inefficient Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) protocol used by 
WiFi, along with the interference constraints of operating in the 
license-exempt band, is likely to significantly reduce the capacity of  
 
 

Introduction to Mobile and Networks     9 
outdoor WiFi systems. Further, WiFi systems are not designed to 
support high-speed mobility. 
A major benefit of WiFi over World Wide Interoperability for 
Microwave Access (WiMAX) and 3G is the wide availability of 
terminal devices. A vast majority of laptops have a built-in WiFi 
interface. WiFi interfaces are now also being built into a variety of 
devices, including Personal Data Assistants (PDAs), cordless phones, 
cellular phones, cameras and media players. This will enable an easy 
use of broadband network services using WiFi. As with 3G, the 
capabilities of WiFi are being enhanced to support even higher  
data rates and to provide better QoS support. In particular, using 
multiple-antenna spatial multiplexing technology, the IEEE 802.11n 
standard supports a peak layer-2 throughput of at least 100 Mbps. It is 
expected that MIMO antennas will use multiple antennas to 
coherently resolve more information than possible using a single 
antenna. 
1.2.3. IEEE 802.16: WMAN 
WiMAX IEEE 802.16 standard for the global deployment of 
broadband Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks is available in two 
versions: fixed and mobile. Fixed WiMAX, which is based on IEEE 
802.16-2004, is ideally suited for delivering wireless, last-mile access  
for fixed broadband services. It is similar to digital subscriber line  
or cable modem services. Mobile WiMAX, which is based on  
the IEEE 802.16e standard, supports both fixed and mobile 
applications while offering users improved performance, capacity and 
mobility. 
Mobile WiMAX provides higher data rates with OFDMA  
support and introduces several key features necessary for delivering 
mobility at vehicular speeds with QoS comparable to broadband 
access alternatives. Several features that are used to enhance  
 
 
 
 

10     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
data throughput are: Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC),  
Hybrid Automatic Repeated Request (HARQ), fast scheduling and 
bandwidth efficient handover. Mobile WiMAX is currently TDD 
operating at 2.5 GHz. Mobile WiMAX has higher tolerance to  
multipath and self-interference and provides orthogonal uplink 
multiple access with frequency selective scheduling and fractional 
frequency reuse. 
1.2.4. IEEE 802.21: MIHS 
Media Independent Handover Service (MIHS) (standard IEEE 
802.21) specified interhandover management through different 
technologies regardless of type or family of standardization (3GPP or 
IEEE). It provides a cross-layer solution that triggers the handover at 
the most appropriate time when moving from one network to another. 
The aim is to ensure continuity of service when a user is changing its 
home network to another network which is using different technology. 
The ultimate goal is to ensure the QoS of an ongoing communication 
anytime and anywhere. The standard has defined many services and 
primitives that allow communication that propagates multilayer 
information from a physical layer to a higher layer so the higher layer 
is aware of what is going on in the lower layer, is thus handover 
occurs at the best time. 
1.2.5. IEEE 802.22: WRAN 
This group is mainly working on “enabling broadband wireless 
access using cognitive radio technology and spectrum sharing in white 
spaces”. Its work focuses mainly on regional networks and this is why 
the standard is called Wireless Regional Area Networks as they use a 
cognitive method to detect the white space in TV broadcast bands and 
reuse them again without causing any interference to the licensed 
users in the same band. The standard specifies operation in bands that 
allow spectrum sharing where the communication devices may  
 
 
 

Introduction to Mobile and Networks     11 
opportunistically operate in the spectrum of the primary service such 
as 1,300–1,750 MHz, 2,700–3,700 MHz and the VHF/UHF TV 
broadcast bands between 54 and 862 MHz. 
1.3. Conclusion 
The move from analog to digital has paved the way for new 
generations of WAN. All technologies, regardless of standardization 
family, IEEE or 3GPP or 3GPP2, are trying to fully IP-orient 
networks, and this is the reason behind the fast evolution that we are 
witnessing.  
Progress and the fast evolution of wireless networks is due to the 
evolution of users’ demands and expectations, as well as the evolution 
of the nature of traffic that the Internet is experiencing through 
different kinds of applications. Such traffic is very greedy in terms of 
data rate and has strict requirements in terms of QoS parameters. Such 
progress could not occur if there were no advanced modulation 
technologies in the physical layer making it possible to have such 
diversity in current wireless technologies. 
Finally, industrial and academic research communities, even 
though they have had different concepts and points of view of how 
technology can be implemented and deployed, have been a principal 
factor in network development.

Mobile Networks 
The standardization of GSM-based systems has its roots in the 
1980s, when the “Group Special Mobile” was created within the 
Conference Européenne des Postes et Télécommunications, whose 
task was to develop a unique digital radio communication system for 
Europe, at 900 MHz. The system has experienced extensive 
modifications to fulfill the increasing operator and cellular user 
demands. The main GSM system development between 1990 and 
2000 was conducted by the European Telecommunications Standards 
Institute, Special Mobile Group  and its technical subcommittees, as 
well T1P1, which was responsible for the PCS1900 MHz 
specifications in the United States. 
Further evolution of the GSM-based systems was handled under 
the 3GPP, a joint effort of several standardization organizations 
around the world to define a global 3G Universal Mobile 
Telecommunication System (UMTS) cellular system. The main 
components of this system are UTRAN, based on wideband code 
division 
multiple 
access 
(WCDMA)

technology, 
and 
GSM/EDGE radio access network (GERAN), based on GSM/EDGE

2.1. Cellular network 
Mobile radio communication introduces some challenges related to 
radio resources. There are several problems related to the following 
elements: 
– signal strength: the signal strength between the base station and 
the cell phone must be sufficiently high to maintain the 
communication. There are several factors that may influence the 
signal level (distance from the base station, interfering signals, etc.); 
– fading: the different effects of signal propagation can cause 
disruptions and errors. It is important to consider these factors during 
the construction of a cellular network. To ensure quality  
communication and to avoid interference, cellular networks use signal 
power control techniques.  
We want the power of the received signal to be sufficiently  
greater than the background noise. For example, when the cell

Mobile Networks     17 
phone moves away from the base station, the received signal is 
attenuated. Conversely, the effects resulting from the reflection, 
diffraction and dispersion can change the signal strength even if the 
cell phone is close to the base station. It is also important to reduce the 
power of the signal transmission from the cell to avoid interference 
with neighboring cells but also to protect health and save energy. 
2.1.1. Radio interface 
As radio resource is scarce, data multiplexing methods have  
been used to optimize its use. Frequency Division Multiple  
Access (FDMA) is the multiple access method most frequently  
used. This technique is the oldest, and it differentiates users with a 
simple frequency differentiation. Each user has an associated 
predetermined frequency. The implementation of this technology is 
quite simple. 
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) is based on the 
distribution of resources over time. Each frequency is divided into 
time intervals. Each user sends or transmits in a range of concrete time 
whose periodicity is defined by the duration of the frame. In this case, 
to listen to N users, the receiver has to consider the time interval T 
associated with this user. Unlike FDMA, multiple users can transmit 
on the same frequency. 
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is the dedicated 3G 
access method. It is based on code division. It spreads the spectrum by 
allocating a code to each communication. Each user is differentiated 
from other users with a code that was allocated early in his 
communication and which is orthogonal to other users’ related codes. 
In this case, to listen to user N, the receiver need only multiply the 
signal received by code N for the user. 

18     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
 
Figure 2.2. The different access methods 
However, the traffic in the downlink and uplink can be merged by 
time division duplex  (TDD) or frequency division duplex (FDD) 
multiplexing. 
Orthogonal Frequency Division or OFDM is another method of 
modulation that is used in the most recent technology just like WLAN 
based on IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11g, UWB, WiMAX, LTE and 4G, 
etc. It provides high spectral efficiency, resilience to radio frequency 
interference and lower multi-path distortion. It is important first to 
understand the frequency division multiplexing (FDM) that extends 
the principle of single carrier modulation through the use of multiple 
subcarriers in the same channel. The data rate divided between  
the various subcarriers will be sent in one channel but  
different subcarriers.  If the set of the subcarriers is orthogonal to each 
other, we add the word orthogonal to the technology.  The guardbands 
necessary to allow individual demodulation of subcarriers in a FDM 
system would no longer be necessary. The use of orthogonal 
subcarriers allows subcarriers’ spectra to overlap, improving spectral 
efficiency. As long as orthogonality is maintained, it is still possible to 
recover the individual subcarriers’ signals despite their overlapping 
spectrums.  

Mobile Networks     19

subchannel (left), and five carriers (right) 
2.1.2. Cell design 
A cellular network is based on the use of low-power transmitters  
(≈ 100 W). The range of such a transmitter is limited to a geographical 
area divided into smaller areas called cells. Each cell has its own 
transceiver (antenna) under the control of a base station and each cell 
has a certain frequency range. To avoid interference, adjacent cells 
should not use the same frequencies, however two cells far enough 
away from each other can use the same frequencies. The cells are 
designed in hexagonal form to facilitate the decision to change a cell 
range. If the distance between all cell transmitters is the same, then it 
is easy to standardize the time when a mobile node should change cell. 
In practice, the cells are not quite hexagonal because of the different 
topology and the propagation conditions, etc. 
Another important choice in the construction of a cellular network 
is the minimum distance between two cells operating in the same 
frequency band to avoid interference. For this, the cell organization 
could follow different patterns. If the pattern contains N cells, each 
could use K/N frequencies where K is the number of frequencies 
allocated to the system. The advantage of frequency reuse is to 
increase the number of users in the system using the same frequency 
band. Where the whole frequency system is at  maximum capacity, i.e. 
all frequencies are used, there are techniques that support new system 
users. The addition of new channels, frequency borrowing from 
neighboring cells and cell division are techniques that increase system 

20     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
capacity. The general principle is to have micro, picocells in high-
density areas to allow a greater frequency reuse in a geographic area 
with a high population. 
 
Figure 2.4. Cell design 
2.1.3. Traffic engineering 
Traffic engineering has been developed for the circuit switching 
based network design. In the context of cellular networks, it is 
essential to know how to plan the network to accept the maximum 
number of calls. One of the basic cellular network designs defines the 
degree of call blocking and also how to manage it. In other words, if a 
call is blocked, it will be put on hold and it will be necessary to define 
what the average waiting time is. Knowing the starting capacity of the 
system (number of channels), we can determine the probability of 
blocking and average waiting time for a blocked call. What 
complicates this traffic engineering in cellular networks is user 
mobility. In a cell, in addition to the novel calls there will be calls 
transferred by neighboring cells. Another parameter which further 
complicates the model is that the system should also combine or 
accept both phone calls and data traffic calls. 

Mobile Networks     21 
2.2. Principles of cellular network functionalities 
A cellular network is generally composed of: 
– a Base station (BS): which is the center of the cell; a BS includes 
an antenna, a controller and a number of transceivers. It allows 
communications over channels assigned to the cell. The controller is 
used to manage the appeal process between a mobile and the rest of 
the network. The BS is connected to Mobile Telephone Switching 
Office (MTSO). Two types of channels are established between the 
cell phone and the BS: control channels and traffic channels. Control  
link the cell phone with the BS and exchange information necessary to 
establish and maintain connections. The traffic channels are used to 
transport traffic (voice, data, etc.). 
– an MTSO: manages several BSs generally associated with a 
wired network. It is responsible for establishing connections between 
mobile nodes. It is also connected to the wired telephone network and 
is thus able to establish connections between fixed and mobile nodes. 
The MTSO is responsible for the allocation of channels to each call; it 
is also responsible for handovers and billing information. The call 
process involves the following functions: 
- initializing a mobile node: when a mobile node is turned on, it 
will scan the existing frequency and select the strongest channel with 
this frequency. Each cell regularly broadcasts control information on 
the band frequency corresponding to the control channel. Then the cell 
phone centers the identification phase after handshakes with the BS. 
This phase occurs between the cell phone and the MTSO. The cell 
phone is identified following authentication and its geographical 
position is registered. It continues to regularly scan the frequency 
spectrum and decides to change base station if it has a stronger signal 
than the previous cell; 
- call initiated by a phone: the mobile node verifies that the call 
channel is free according to information sent by the base station on the 
control channel on the downlink. The cell phone can then send the call  
number on the control channel to the base station so it can transmit its 
request to the MTSO; 

22     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
- call notification: according to the call number received, the 
switching center attempts to connect to the base stations concerned 
with the number called and sends a call notification (paging) to the 
cell phone. Notification of the call is transmitted by the base stations 
in the call control channel in the downlink; 
- call acceptance: once the cell phone knows its number in the 
channel call control, it responds to the base station which will relay 
the message to the switch center that will establish a circuit between 
the base stations and the caller by a third party. The switch will also 
select one traffic channel available for each of the relevant cells and 
communicate information on this call with the base stations. The cell 
phone will then synchronize on traffic channels selected by the base 
stations;  
- active communication: is the voice traffic exchange process or 
data exchanged between the cell phone calling and the one called. 
This is ensured by the two base stations and the switching center; 
- call blocking: if all the traffic from a base station channels is 
occupied, the cell phone will try to repeat the call a number of times. 
In case of failure, a busy tone signal is returned to the user; 
- call termination: at the end of a call, the switching center 
informs the base station to release the channel. This action is also 
important for billing; 
- abandon call: during a call, if the base station fails to maintain 
a good level of signal (interference, low signal strength, etc.), it 
changes the traffic channel of the cell phone and notifies the switching 
center. 
- call between landline and mobile: the mobile switching center 
being connected to the fixed network, it is then able to establish 
communications between these two networks. It can also attach 
another mobile switching center through the fixed network. 
- handoff (handover): when the cell phone discovers a control 
channel in which the signal strength is stronger than the current cell, 
the network will automatically transfer the call to another cell in a 
transparent way. The decision is made according to the measured  
 

Mobile Networks     23 
power of the signal of the BS with this mobile node. In general, the 
station calculates an average of a certain window of time to eliminate 
rapid fluctuations resulting from multipath effects. Various techniques 
can be used to determine the mobile transfer time. This transfer can be 
controlled either by the network or by the cell phone. The simplest 
handover decision technique is the one that initiates the transfer when 
the cell phone detects a stronger signal than that of the cell where it is 
located.  
2.3. 1G networks 
1G cellular networks, such as CT0/1 (cordless telephone) for 
wireless networks and Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) for 
mobile networks is characterized by analog communications. Few first 
network cell phones still exist. AMPS was the first most widespread 
system in the United States around 1980. It was also deployed in 
South America, Australia and China. In Northern Europe, the Nordic 
Mobile Telecommunication System network has been developed. In 
the United Kingdom, the Total Access Communication System  and 
France Radiocom 2000 were deployed. All these 1G cellular networks 
were analog and used frequency bands between 450 and 900 MHz. 
2.4. 2G networks  
The 2G cellular networks such as digital enhanced cordless 
telecommunication (DECT) for wireless and GSM for cell phones are 
characterized by digital communications unlike 1G networks. During 
the 1990s, several digital technologies have been developed: 
– GSM developed in Europe runs at 900 MHz;  
– the dynamic channel selection (DCS) 1,800 equivalent to GSM 
but operating at higher frequencies (1,800 MHz); 
– 1900 personal communication system (PCS) and D-AMPS 
(digital AMPS) have been developed in the United States; 
 

24     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
– the Pacific or Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) system developed 
in Japan. 
GSM, D-AMPS is also called IS-136, based on the TDMA access 
method, while the PCS 1900 also called cdma One or IS-95 and relies 
on CDMA technology. 
In this generation, simple data transmission is possible in addition 
to voice, but the data rate remains low with less than 10 kbps and it is 
impossible to deploy multimedia services. High-speed circuit switched 
data (HSCSD) and General Packet Radio Services (GPRS) have 
allowed the increase in the data rate in 2G networks. These 
technologies are also known as 2.5 generation cellular networks. 
GPRS unlike HSCDC uses packet switching, thus optimizing the use 
of the radio resource for data transmission of sporadic nature. The 
theoretical data rate is 120 kbps, while the real data rate does not 
exceed 30 kbps. This generation could not meet the needs of cell 
phone users who wanted to use multimedia services comparable to 
fixed networks. The evolution of the GPRS network resulted in the 
EDGE or Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS), which improved the reliability 
and throughput of data communications. This network is usually 
known as 2.75G or 3G, depending on implementation. This is a simple 
evolution of GSM/GPRS to obtain data rate of 130 and 60 kbps in 
transmission. 
Mobility management is generally carried out using two data 
bases: the Home Location Register (HLR), which updates the 
subscriber’s data, and the Visitor Location Register (VLR), which 
manages the customer in the cell visited. The network due to these 
two components can provide mobile node location management to 
route calls and also provide handover or handoff. These cellular 
networks allow high mobility of the terminal but low personal 
mobility, resulting in the possibility of using the Subscriber Identity 
Module (SIM) card in any terminal. Recall that personal mobility is 
the ability to change terminals while retaining a working environment. 
We find this mobility in Universal Personal Telecommunication 
(UPT) networks. 

Mobile Networks     25 
2.5. 3G networks  
3G cellular networks operate around the 2 GHz frequency band. 
They provide a range of multimedia services fixed and mobile users 
with a QoS comparable to that for fixed networks. The International 
Telecommunication Union has selected five standards for 3G mobile: 
(Wideband CDMA) W-CDMA, TD-CDMA and TD-SCDMA used in 
the 
European 
Universal 
Mobile 
Telecommunication 
System, 
CDMA2000, EDGE and 3G DECT. IMT-2000 networks are  
intended to include a global roaming, a range of broadband services 
such as video and the use of a single terminal in different wireless 
networks. 
Another goal is for fixed and mobile services to provide consistent 
transparency to the user. These networks provide a global mobility 
that includes mobility terminal, personal mobility and service 
mobility. The concept of the Virtual Home Environment (HEV) is 
then developed to support this mobility service. In addition to the 
higher data rates, the overall mobility is another major difference to 
2G networks. 
 UMTS based on the W-CDMA access method theoretically allows 
a data rate of up to 1.920 Mbps, but in late 2004 the data rate offered 
by operators rarely exceeded 384 kbps. This rate is well above the 
GSM base data rate (9.6 kbps). UMTS-TDD is based on the TD-
CDMA access method, which is not compatible with UMTS. The 3G 
network developed in China is based on time division-synchronous 
code division multiple access (TD-SCDMA), a local standard, to 
avoid paying for the copyrights of other 3G standards. 
CDMA2000 1x, CDMA2000 1xEV-DO and CDMA2000 1xEV-
DV are direct successors of 2G CDMA (cdmaOne IS-95), and these 
are 3GPP1 standards. CDMA2000 1x, known as 1X, 1xRTT, IS-2000, 
CDMA2000 1X, 1X, or cdma2000, doubles the capacity of the votes 
compared to IS-95. Data rate transmission can reach 144 kbps. 1xRTT 
is considered as 2.5G or 2.75G or 3G depending on the  
 
 
 

26     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
implementation. CDMA2000 3x was specified on another frequency 
band. This standard has not been deployed. Finally, 1xEV-DO 4 IS-
856 or 1xEV-DV5 is used to increase the data transmission rate and 
support mobile video. 
In the High Speed Protocol Access (HSPA) family, which  
should evolve UMTS network toward a high data transmission rate, 
there are the HSDPA, HSUPA and HSOPA protocols which are the 
successors of UMTS. High-Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) 
can handle a rate of 5.76 Mbps. High-speed downlink protocol access 
(HSDPA) in the first phase of its development supported up to 
14 Mbps. In the second phase of it could support up to 28.8 Mbps 
through 
MIMO 
technology 
and 
beamforming. 
High 
Speed  
OFDM Packet Access (HSOPA), the successor of HSDPA,  
reached 100 Mbps downlink and 50 Mbps in the uplink through the 
OFDMA access technology. It competes directly with IEEE 
technologies such as WiMAX. HSOPA is a new air interface that is 
incompatible with W-CDMA and therefore with developments in 
previous 3G networks. 
The final evolution of 3G consists of Long-Term Evolution (LTE), 
which is promoted by the 3GPP to describe commercial technology 
corresponding to HSOPA, that is to say, the arrival of  
the mobile radio technologies using OFDMA. The ultra mobile 
broadband (UMB) promoted by the 3GPP2 aims to succeed 
cdma2000, but this solution is rapidly losing ground compared to 
LTE. 
LTE began to be marketed in 2010 and most countries have 
deployed this technology to handle the enormous data rates from 
smartphones and tablets. Feedback is that the peak rates are rarely 
achieved. One can say that the conventional flow rates are in the order 
of those of ADSL, that is to say, several megabits per second. Mobile 
operator advertisements call this 4G standard, but in reality it belongs 
to 3G. LTE should be called 3.9G. We are not far from 4G, and only 
the voice is still non-VoIP. It is possible to transmit VoIP over LTE,  
 
 

Mobile Networks     27 
but through the data channel: this is the Voice over LTE (VoLTE ), as 
we will discuss Chapter 3. 
Recall that the LTE network includes the radio part, or E-UTRAN, 
and the network part, with the evolved packet core (EPC). In  
E-UTRAN, the control functions were built into the eNodeB when 
they were pushed into the Radio Network Controller in UMTS 
networks. This support is changed in the 5G, where control schemes 
mainly perform in the Cloud and usually in a local data center. The 
EPC is definitely IP-based. 
LTE network performances have improved since the launch of 
these networks in 2009. The downstream speeds can theoretically 
reach 326.4 Mbps using a MIMO with four antennas. The flow pic 
rate is 86.4 Mbps. The roundtrip time, is much better than that of 
UMTS and can drop to 10 ms in a good case. 
2.6. 4G networks 
LTE Advanced and WiMAX Phase 2 mark the real start of 4G. 
LTE Advanced follows LTE, with IP compatibility. WiMAX Phase 2 
also belongs to the 4G family and is IP-compatible in nature. Many 
functions have been revised compared to WiMAX Phase 1. 4G is 
therefore fully compatible with the IP world. However, WiMAX 
Phase 2 is not a success story and should disappear leaving LTE 
Advanced (LTEA) as the only 4G solution. 
Many new items are included in the 4G represented by the LTE 
Advanced technology. The highlights are: 
– the relay nodes that achieve an Enhanced NodeB (eNodeB) 
antenna or eNB via a pick-up point. This solution was proposed 
primarily in the context of WiMAX Phase 2 but was taken over by 
LTE Advanced;  
– MIMO solutions are used in the transmission to the terminal and 
in the opposite direction. MIMO is described in Chapter 9; 
– bandwidths used range from 20 to 100 MHz, which allows 
increased rates up to a factor of five when necessary; 

28     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
– the air interface is optimized based on the location of the terminal 
and interferences. In other words, as in the 3G+ and LTE 
technologies, a set of tools speed up the rates as soon as the terminal is 
located in an area where a good quality signal is received and 
throughput degrades when the client is in a poor environment or when 
the terminal is highly mobile; 
– 4G selected a compatibility with WiFi environments to take 
advantage of these networks for important flows. The concept of the 
femtocell is much more developed in this generation; 
– cognitive radio, which we introduce later on, is increasingly 
used. This allows for both greater bandwidth and better use of the 
spectrum; 
– the management and control schemes of the network are much 
more automated and become autonomic, i.e. autonomous and 
spontaneous. A major effort is made to obtain an automatic piloting 
system for configuration, security, availability and monitoring; 
– the encoding of the information is improved for even higher 
compression rates than 3G+. Error corrections are improved, but are 
rather similar to techniques used in 3G+; 
– interference management is greatly improved, so interference is 
virtually eliminated. These technologies use directive antennas 
(beamforming), which by their directivity can determine the location 
of the end machine; 
– the techniques used on the air interface may be asymmetric, for 
example a technical OFDMA on the downlink part and SC-FDMA on 
the uplink part. 
Returning to the purely technical part, LTE-A offers significantly 
higher data rates through the aggregation of different carriers (Carrier 
Aggregation) and the disappearance of the GSM digital word to 
become completely VoIP. The carrier aggregation brings together 
carriers that are not contiguous. With a spectrum width of 100 MHz, it 
is possible to obtain a flow rate of about 1 Gbps. MIMO technology  
 
 

Mobile Networks     29 
can also be extended with eight antennas. Radio relays, that we 
describe in Chapter 8, will also be much more widespread. The “small 
cell”, which we will examine in Chapter 7, will be multiplied to allow 
a multiplication of the capacity. 
2.7. 5G networks 
5G is not yet defined, but many texts are already available. The 
basic technology is no different from that of 4G. The differences are 
more architectural: the introduction of Cloud to control mobile 
network equipment, the strong use of virtualization and the ability to 
connect billions of “things”. 
Let us start with the introduction of Cloud solutions to support 
network control schemes. The Cloud provides computing power and 
information retrieval that can make decisions taking into account a 
large number of parameters. For example, an algorithm can decide 
about a handover rather than considering only the signal strength and 
a few local parameters. For example, when the signal reception on a 
new antenna is higher than on the current antenna, it may be best to 
take into account parameters such as load of the cells, evaluation of 
the load of the transit networks, the energy savings, the type of 
application in transit, etc. Therefore, it is possible to greatly refine the 
decision. The downside is of course the time taken to go back and 
forth between the network nodes that implement the decisions and the 
place where decisions are made. This approach is similar in all 
respects to that of Software-Defined Networks (SDNs). Here, since 
real time is often necessary, it could be important for the data center in 
which the algorithms are executed be close to the network equipment. 
One can speak of distributed Cloud or Local Cloud. This solution  will 
be described in Chapter 13. 
The second main direction is virtualization. We detail network 
virtualization techniques in Chapter 13. The main idea of 
virtualization is for network equipment to be shared between several 
operators and between users. For example, a VLR or a 3G/4G  
 
 

30     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
antenna or a WiFi hotspot can be shared between multiple users. In 
this solution, each user has the impression that the network belongs to 
him. Indeed, the user may modify control and management software. 
The advantage is much better use and sharing of equipment between 
several 
operators. 
Virtualization 
may 
allow 
coexistence 
of 
heterogeneous networks, since the networks are isolated from each 
other. 
The most visible part of 5G comes from the connection of billions 
of things. This is called Internet of Things. The forecast is 100 billion 
things by 2022. We will discuss this new environment in Chapter 5.

Long-Term Evolution 
The development of Long-Term Evolution (LTE) is now  
finished. LTE focuses on enhancing the Universal Terrestrial  
Radio Access (UTRA). LTE mobile broadband is popularly called a 
4G developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)  
and adopted by the European Telecommunications Standards  
Institute. In fact, LTE is not 4G but a member of 3G and should be 
called 3.9G but it is easier to talk about 4G. The main difference 
concerns the voice: 4G is a full-IP technology and the voice is 
transferred through a VoIP technology. In the LTE, mobile operators 
are using GSM for voice communications. Obviously, it is possible to 
get VoIP within 3.9G technology using the data band: this is called 
VoLTE. 
LTE provides an average user throughput of three to four times the 
Release 6 High Speed Download Packet Access (HSDPA) levels in 
the downlink (100 Mbps) and two to three times the HSUPA levels in 
the uplink (50 Mbps). In 2007, 3G Evolved Universal Terrestrial 
Radio Access progressed from the feasibility study stage to the first 
approved technical specifications. By the end of 2008, the 
specifications were sufficiently stable for the first wave of LTE 
equipment in Release 8. However, some small enhancements were

36     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
introduced in Release 9, that was functionally frozen in December 
2009. The motivation for 3GPP Release 8 was; 
– the need to ensure the continuity of competitiveness of the 3G 
system for the future; 
– user demand for higher data rates and quality of service (QoS); 
– packet switch optimized system; 
– continued demand for cost reduction; 
– low complexity; 
– avoid unnecessary fragmentation of technologies for paired and 
unpaired band operation. 
In September 2009, the 3GPP partners made a formal submission 
to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) proposing that 
LTE Release 10 and beyond (LTE Advanced) be evaluated as a 
candidate for IMT-Advanced. The ITU has coined the term 
International Mobile Telecommunication (IMT)-Advanced to identify 
mobile systems whose capabilities go beyond those of IMT-2000. In 
order to meet this new challenge, 3GPP’s organizational partners 
agreed to widen 3GPP’s scope to include the development of systems 
beyond 3G. Some of the key features of IMT-Advanced are: 
– worldwide functionality and roaming; 
– compatibility of services; 
– interworking with other radio access systems; 
– enhanced peak data rates to support advanced services and 
applications (100 Mbit/s for high and 1 Gbps for low mobility).  
3.1. Relevant features of LTE 
LTE is a mobile broadband solution that offers a rich set of 
features with a lot of flexibility in terms of deployment options and 
potential service offerings. Some of the most important features are as 
follows (Table 3.1):  

Long-Term Evolution     37 
– Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) for high 
spectral efficiency is the basis of the physical layer: OFDM is used in 
downlink for robustness against multipath interference and high 
affinity to advanced techniques such as frequency domain channel-
dependent scheduling and MIMO, while Single-Carrier Frequency 
Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) is used in uplink in order to get 
a low peak-to-average power ratio, user orthogonality in frequency 
domain and multi-antenna application. 
– Support for TDD and FDD: LTE supports both time division 
duplexing (TDD) and frequency division duplexing. TDD is favored 
by a majority of implementations because of its advantages: (1) 
flexibility in choosing uplink-to-downlink data rate ratios, (2) ability 
to exploit channel reciprocity, (3) ability to implement in non-paired 
spectrum and (4) less complex transceiver design. 
– Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC): LTE supports a 
number of modulation and forward error correction coding schemes 
and allows the scheme to be changed on a per user and frame basis, 
based on channel conditions. AMC is an effective mechanism to 
maximize throughput in a time-varying channel. The adaptation 
algorithm typically calls for the use of the highest modulation and 
coding scheme that can be supported by the signal-to-noise and 
interference ratio at the receiver such that each user is provided with 
the highest possible data rate that can be supported in their 
respective links. 
– Support of variable bandwidths: E-UTRAN will operate in 
spectrum allocations of different sizes, including 1.25, 1.6, 2.5, 5, 10, 
15 and 20 MHz in both the uplink and downlink (Table 1.3). 
Operation in the paired and unpaired spectrum will be supported.  
This scaling may be done dynamically to support user roaming  
across different networks that may have different bandwidth 
allocations. 
– LTE is capable of supporting very high peak data rates. In fact, 
the peak physical data rate can be as high as the downlink peak data 
rate of 100 Mb/s within a 20 MHz downlink spectrum allocation 
(5 bps/Hz), while it provides an uplink peak data rate of 50 Mb/s 
(2.5 bps/Hz) within a 20 MHz uplink spectrum allocation. 

38     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
– Mobility: E-UTRAN should be optimized for low mobile speed 
from 0 to 15 km/h. A higher mobile speed between 15 and 120 km/h 
should be supported with high performance. Mobility across the 
cellular network will be maintained at speeds from 120 to 350 km/h 
(or even up to 500 km/h depending on the frequency band). 
– Link 
layer 
retransmissions: 
LTE 
supports 
automatic 
retransmission requests (ARQ) at the link layer. ARQ-enabled 
connections require each packet transmitted to be acknowledged by 
the receiver; unacknowledged packets are assumed to be lost and are 
retransmitted. LTE also optionally supports hybrid-ARQ, which is an 
effective hybrid between foreword error  correction and ARQ. 
– Simultaneous user support: LTE provides the ability to perform 
two-dimensional resource scheduling (in time and frequency), 
allowing the support of multiple users in a time slot; in contrast, 
existing 3G technology performs one-dimensional scheduling, which 
limits service to one user for each time slot. This capability of LTE 
results in a much better always-on experience and also enables the 
proliferation of embedded wireless applications/systems.  
– Security: LTE provides enhanced security through the 
implementation of Universal Integrated Circuit Card Subscriber 
Identity Module (SIM) and the associated robust and non-invasive key 
storage and symmetric key authentication using 128-bit private keys. 
LTE additionally incorporates strong mutual authentication, user 
identity confidentiality, integrity protection of all signaling messages 
between user equipment and mobility management entity (MME) and 
optional multi-level bearer data encryption.  
– Efficient worldwide roaming: because LTE is the unified pre-4G 
standard for most 3GPP and 3GPP2 carriers worldwide, LTE  
devices are fundamentally easier to set up for worldwide roaming. The 
caveat is that the actual frequency band used by different carriers is 
different (thereby retaining the need for multiband devices). As a 
result, the wireless migration path to LTE provides greater 
opportunities for seamless international roaming and for global  
device economies of scale. Table 3.1 depicts LTE Release 8 major 
parameters.

3.2. Network architecture and protocols 
The 3GPP Long-Term Evolution/System Architecture Evolution 
(LTE/SAE) sought to take mobile technology to the next level through 
higher bandwidths, better spectrum efficiency, wider coverage and full 
interworking with other access/backend systems.  
LTE/SAE proposed to do all this using an all-IP architecture with 
well-defined interworking with circuit-switched systems. The evolved 
3GPP system introduced a hybrid mobile network architecture 
supporting 
radio 
access 
technologies 
and 
several 
mobility 
mechanisms. We begin this section by introducing the LTE network 
reference model and define its various functional entities and its 
interconnection possibilities. Next, we discuss the end-to-end protocol 
layering in an LTE network, network selection and discovery, and IP 
address allocation. Finally, we describe the functional architecture and  
 

40     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
processes associated with security, QoS and mobility management in 
more detail. 
The network architecture of LTE is based on functional 
decomposition principles, where required features are decomposed 
into functional entities without specific implementation assumptions 
about physical network entities. This is why 3GPP specified a new 
packet core, the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), network architecture to 
support the E-UTRAN through a reduction in the number of network 
elements, simpler functionality, improved redundancy, and for 
connections and handover to other fixed line and wireless access 
technologies, giving service providers the ability to deliver a seamless 
experience. 
3.2.1. Architecture reference model 
Figure 3.1 shows the LTE network reference model, which is a 
logical representation of the network architecture. The network 
reference model identifies the functional entities in the architecture 
and the reference points between the functional entities over which 
interoperability is achieved. The overall architecture has two distinct 
components: the access network and the core network. The access 
network is E-UTRAN. The core network is all-IP core network and is 
fully packet switched. Services like voice, which are traditionally 
circuit switched, will be handled using IP Multimedia Subsystem 
(IMS) network. The core network is the EPC. Network complexity 
and latency are reduced as there are fewer hops in both the signaling 
and data plane. The EPC is designed to support non-3GPPP access 
supports for mobile IP. To improve system security, integrity 
protection and ciphering have been added via a non-access stratum 
plane, which is an additional layer of abstraction to protect important 
information like security interworking between 3GPP and non-3GPP 
network. Apart from the network entities handling data traffic, EPC 
also contains network control entities for keeping user subscription 
information represented by home subscriber server, determining the 
identity and privileges of a user and tracking his/her activities, i.e. 
authorization, authentication and accounting server, and enforcing  
 

Long-Term Evolution     41 
charging and QoS policies through a Policy and Charging Rules 
Function (PCRF). Note that E-UTRAN and EPC together constitute 
the evolved packet system. Both radio access network and core 
network could achieve many functionalities including: 
– network access control functions; 
– packet routing and transfer functions; 
– mobility management functions; 
– security functions; 
– radio resource management functions; 
– network management functions.

3.2.2. Functional description of a LTE network 
3.2.2.1. Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network  
E-UTRAN is the air interface of 3GPP’s LTE upgrade path for 
mobile networks. It is a radio access network standard meant to be a  
 

42     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
replacement of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System, 
high-speed downlink packet access and high-speed uplink packet 
access technologies specified in 3GPP releases 5 and beyond. LTE’s 
E-UTRAN is an entirely new air interface system, which provides 
higher data rates and lower latency and is optimized for packet data. It 
uses OFDMA radio access for the downlink and SC-FDMA for the 
uplink. The E-UTRAN in LTE architecture consists of a single node, 
i.e. the eNodeB that interfaces with the user equipment (UE). The aim 
of this simplification is to reduce the latency of all radio interface 
operations. eNodeBs are connected to each other via the X2 interface, 
and they connect to the packet switched core network via the S1 
interface (see Figure 3.2).  
 
Figure 3.2. E-UTRAN architecture. MME – mobility  
management entity; SGW – Serving gateway 
A general E-UTRAN protocol architecture (Figure 3.3) splits the 
radio interface into three layers: a physical layer or layer 1, the data 
link layer (layer 2) and the network layer or layer 3. This hierarchical  
stratification provides a complete vision of the radio interface, from 

Long-Term Evolution     43 
both the functionality associated with each of the structured layer to 
the protocol flow between them. The purpose of the protocol stack is 
to set the services to organize the information to transmit through 
logical channels whose classifying parameter is the nature of the 
information they carry (i.e. control or traffic information) and map 
these logical channels into transport channels whose characteristic is 
how and with what the information within each logical channel is 
transmitted over the radio interface. This how and with what 
characteristic means that for each transport channel, there is one or 
more associated transport formats, each defined by the encoding, 
interleaving bit rate and mapping onto the physical channel. Each 
layer is characterized by the services provided to the higher layers or 
entities and the functions that support them as follows: 
– physical layer: carries all information from the medium access 
channel (MAC) transport channels over the air interface. Takes care of 
the link adaptation (adoptive modulation and code (AMC)), power 
control, cell search (for initial synchronization and handover 
purposes) and other measurements (inside the LTE system and 
between systems) for the radiolink control (RRC) layer; 
– MAC: the MAC sublayer offers a set of logical channels to the 
RLC sublayer that it multiplexes into the physical layer transport 
channels. It also manages the hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) 
error correction, handles the prioritization of the logical channels for 
the same UE and the dynamic scheduling between UEs, etc. 
– RLC: it transports the Packet Data Convergence Protocols 
(PDCP’s) PDUs. It can work in three different modes depending on 
the reliability provided. Depending on this mode, it can provide 
HARQ error correction, segmentation/ concatenation of PDUs, 
reordering for insequence delivery, duplicate detection, etc. 
– PDCP: for the RRC layer, it transports its data with ciphering and 
integrity protection and for the IP layer it transports IP packets, with 
robust header compression (ROHC), ciphering and depending on the 
RLC 
mode 
in-sequence 
delivery, 
duplicate 
detection 
and 
retransmission of its own service data units during handover.  
 

44     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
– RRC: between others, it takes care of the broadcast system 
information related to the access stratum and transport of the  
non-access stratum manages messages, paging, establishment and 
release of the radio resource control (RRC) connection, security key 
management, handover, UE measurements related to inter-system 
(inter-RAT) mobility, QoS, etc. 
Layers interfacing, with the E-UTRAN protocol stack are: 
– Non-access stratum: protocol between the UE and the mobility 
management entity (MME) on the network side (outside of 
EUTRAN). Between others it authenticates the UE and security 
control and generates part of the paging messages; 
- IP layer.

– Serving gateway (S-GW): the S-GW routes and forwards user 
data packets, while also acting as the mobility anchor for the user 
plane during inter-eNodeB handovers and as the anchor for mobility 
between LTE and other 3GPP technologies (terminating S4 interface 
and relaying the traffic between 2G/3G systems and the packet data 
network gateway (PDN-GW)). For idle state UEs, the S-GW 
terminates the downlink data path and triggers paging when downlink 
data arrives for the UE. It manages and stores UE contexts, e.g. 
parameters of the IP bearer service and network internal routing 
information. It also performs replication of the user traffic for lawful 
interception.  
– MME: is the key control node for the LTE access network. It is 
responsible for idle mode UE tracking and paging procedures 
including 
retransmissions. 
It 
is 
involved 
in 
the 
bearer 
activation/deactivation process and is also responsible for choosing 
the S-GW for a UE at the initial attachment and at time of intra- LTE 
handover involving core network node relocation. It is responsible for 
authenticating the user. The non-access stratum signaling terminates at 
the MME and it is also responsible for the generation and allocation of 
temporary identities to UEs. It checks the authorization of the UE to 
camp on the service provider’s Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) 
and enforces UE roaming restrictions. The MME is the termination 
point in the network for ciphering/integrity protection for non-access 
stratum signaling and handles the security key management. Lawful 
interception of signaling is also supported by the MME. The MME 
also provides the control plane function for mobility between LTE and 
2G/3G access networks with the S3 interface terminating at the MME 
from the SGSN. 
Finally, the MME also terminates the S6a interface toward the 
home HSS for roaming UEs. 
– PDN-GW: the PDN-GW provides connectivity to the UE to 
external packet data networks by being the point of exit and entry of 
UE traffic. A UE may have simultaneous connectivity with more than 
one PDN-GW for accessing multiple packet data networks. The  
 
 

46     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
PDN-GW performs policy enforcement, packet filtering for each user, 
charging support, lawful interception and packet screening. Another 
key role of the PDN-GW is to act as the anchor for mobility between 
3GPP and non-3GPP technologies such as WiMAX and 3GPP2 
(CDMA 1x and EV-DO). 
Figure 3.4 shows the functional split between E-UTRAN and EPC. 
Some functions after the split are indicated in this figure.

3.2.4. Reference points 
The LTE defines a reference point as a conceptual link that 
connects two groups of functions that reside in different functional 
entities of the E-UTRAN and EPC. Figure 3.5 shows a number of 
reference points defined by the 3GPP. These reference points are 
listed in Table 3.2. Note that these reference points are based on 
release 8 of the standardization and there may be more reference 
points that are dependent on the type of network architecture.

3.3. Control and user planes 
The radio interface in LTE is characterized through its protocols 
where it can be defined by two main groupings according to the final 
purpose: user plane protocols and control plane protocols. The first 
carries user data through the access stratum and the second is 
responsible for controlling the connections between the UE and the 
network and the radio access bearers. Even though separation of the 
control plane and the user plane was one of the most important issues of 
LTE design, full independence of the layers is not feasible because, 
without interaction between the user plane and the control plane, 
operators are not able to control QoS, the source/destination of media 
traffic or when the media starts and stops.  
3.3.1. User plane 
Figure 3.5 shows the user plane protocol stack including the  
E-UTRAN and the S1 interface of a conventional, i.e. non-self-
backhauled, system. The radio access uses the MAC, RLC and PDCP 
protocols. The user plane part of the S1 interface is based on the 
GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP), which uses a tunneling mechanism 
ensuring that IP packets destined for a given UE are delivered to the 
eNodeB where the UE is currently located. GTP encapsulates the 
original IP packet into an outer IP packet which is addressed to the 
proper eNodeB. The S1 interface can operate over various layer 
1/layer 2 technologies, e.g. fiber optic cables, leased (copper) lines or 
microwave links.

Figure 3.5 also shows an example of a Transmission Control 
Protocol (TCP)/IP-based application, such as web browsing. The 
corresponding peer entities operate in the UE and at the server hosting 
the web application. For simplicity, peer protocol entities of the server 
are drawn in the S-GW; however, in general, they are located 
somewhere in the Internet.

Table 3.3. LTE reference points 
All information sent and received by the UE, such as the coded 
voice in a voice call or the packets in an Internet connection, are 
transported via the user plane. User plane traffic is processed at 
different hierarchical levels, from eNodeB up to the core network 
(EPC). Also, control traffic is strictly tied to the user plane. 

50     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
Irrespective of the reasons behind the current hierarchical architecture, 
for the transmission backbone, this means the higher the level of 
network hierarchy, the greater the amount of accumulated traffic 
generated. Therefore, higher level network elements will readily 
become the bottleneck of the network. Therefore, transmission 
capacity should be fitted to the network hierarchy; at higher levels, 
high-capacity transmission means, such as fiber optics, are needed, but 
when it comes to the edge of the network, microwave transmission 
becomes a more flexible and cost-effective substitution, particularly in 
terms of extending capacity. 
3.3.2. GPRS tunneling protocol  
GPRS Tunneling Protocol (GTP) is a collection of protocols 
central to IP mobility management within 3GPP packet core networks 
(GPRS/UMTS/EPC) comprising of GTP-C, GTP-U and GTP variants. 
The protocol stack for GTP is depicted in Figure 3.6. GTP-C is the 
control part of GTP and is used in control plane mechanisms in GPRS, 
UMTS and LTE/SAE/EPC networks. GTP-C is standardized as 
version 0, version 1 and version 2 by 3GPP. All the GTP-C versions 
use UDP as the transport protocol. GTP v2 offers a fallback to GTP v1 
via the earlier “Version Not Supported” mechanism but explicitly 
offers no support for fallback to GTP v0. 
 
Figure 3.6. GTP stack 
GTP-U is the bearer part of GTP and is used in user plane 
mechanisms in GPRS, UMTS and LTE networks. GTP-U is 
standardized as version 0 and version 1 by 3GPP. All the GTP-U 
versions use UDP as the transport protocol. GTP or GTP Prime is 
used for interfacing with the changing gateway function (CGF) in 

Long-Term Evolution     51 
GPRS and UMTS networks. LTE MME, SGW and PDN gateway 
nodes use GTP-C to control plane signaling on S11/S5 interfaces, 
while S-GW and PDN-GW nodes use GTP-U as a user plane on S1-U 
and S5 interfaces primarily. The LTE/SAE/EPC network uses only 
GTP version 2, also known as evolved GTP unless backward 
compatible to 3G UMTS/HSPA networks. After the downlink path is 
switched at the S-GW downlink, packets on the forwarding path and 
on the new direct path may arrive interchanged at target eNodeB. 
Target eNodeB should first deliver all forwarded packets to the UE 
before sending any of the packets received on the new direct path. The 
method employed in the target eNodeB to enforce the correct delivery 
order of packets is outside the scope of the standard. In order to assist 
the reordering function in the target eNodeB, the S-GW will send one 
or more “end marker” packets on the old path immediately after 
switching the path for each UE. The “end marker” packet will not 
contain user data. The “end marker” is indicated in the GTP header. 
After sending the tagged packets, the gateway will not send any 
further user data packets via the old path. Upon receiving the “end 
marker” packets, the source eNodeB will, if forwarding is activated 
for that bearer, forward the packet toward the target eNodeB. On 
detection of an “end marker,” the target eNodeB will discard the end 
marker packet and initiate any necessary processing to maintain in-
sequence delivery of user data forwarded over the X2 interface and 
user data received from the S-GW over S1 as a result of the path 
switch. On detection of the “end marker,” the target eNodeB may also 
initiate release of the data forwarding resource (see Figure 3.7). 
 
Figure 3.7. GTP tunneling 

52     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
3.3.3. Control plane 
The function of the control plane protocol is to control the radio 
access bearers and the connection between the UE and the network, 
i.e. signaling between E-UTRAN and EPC (Figure 3.8). The control 
plane consists of protocols for control and support of the user plane 
functions: 
– controlling the E-UTRAN network access connections, such as 
attaching to and detaching from E-UTRAN; 
– controlling the attributes of an established network access 
connection, such as activation of an IP address; 
– controlling the routing path of an established network connection 
in order to support user mobility; 
– controlling the assignment of network resources to meet 
changing user demands. 
 
Figure 3.8. Control plane end-to-end protocol stack

of

and 
mobility  
 
 
 

Long-Term Evolution     53 
management. All NAS messages are ciphered and integrity is 
protected by the MME and UE. The RRC  layer in eNodeB makes 
handover decisions based on neighbor cell measurements sent by the 
UE, pages for the UEs over the air, broadcasts system information, 
controls UE measurement reporting such as the periodicity of channel 
quality information, reports on and allocates temporary cell-level 
identifiers to active UEs. It also executes transfer of UE context from 
the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB during handover and does 
integrity protection of RRC messages. The RRC layer is responsible 
for setting up and maintaining radio bearers. 
3.4. Multimedia broadcast and multicast service 
Multimedia broadcast and multicast service (MBMS) is a point-to-
multipoint service in which data are transmitted from a single source 
to multiple destinations over radio network. Transmission of the same 
data to multiple recipients allows network resources to be shared. 
MBMS is realized by the addition of existing and new functional 
entities of 3GPP architecture.  
MBMS provides two different services: (1) broadcast and (2) 
multicast. The broadcast service can be received by any subscriber 
located in the area in which the service is offered and multicast 
services can only be received by users having subscribed to the 
service who have joined the multicast group associated with the 
service. 
Both 
services 
are 
unidirectional 
point-to-multipoint 
transmissions of multimedia data and can be applied to text, audio, 
picture and, video broadcast from a Broadcast Multicast Service 
Center to any user located in the service area. For such a service, only 
broadcast service providers can be charged, possibly based on the 
amount of data broadcast, size of service area or broadcast duration. 
Multicast is subject to service subscription and requires the end user to 
explicitly join the group in order to receive the service. Because it is 
subject to subscription, the multicast service allows the operator to set 
specific user charging rules for this service. 

54     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
3.5. Stream Control Transmission Protocol 
The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) is a transport 
layer protocol, serving a similar role to the popular TCP and UDP. It 
provides some of the same service features: it is message-oriented  
like UDP and ensures reliable, in-sequence transport of messages  
with congestion control like TCP. SCTP is used in LTE to ensure 
reliable, in-sequence transport of messages. LTE uses SCTP, which 
we view as a layer between the SCTP user application and an 
unreliable end-to-end datagram service such as UDP. Thus, the main 
function of SCTP amounts to reliable transfer of user datagrams 
between peer SCTP users. It performs this service within the context 
of an association between SCTP nodes, where APIs exist at the 
boundaries. SCTP has connection-oriented characteristics but a broad 
concept. It provides a means for each SCTP endpoint to provide the 
other during association startup with a list of transport addresses (e.g. 
address/UDP port combinations) by which that endpoint can be 
reached and from which messages originate. The association transfers 
over all possible source/destination combinations, which may be 
generated from two end lists. As a result, SCTP offers the following 
services: 
– application-level segmentation; 
– acknowledged error-free non-duplicated transfer of user data; 
– sequenced delivery of user datagrams within multiple streams; 
– enhanced reliability through support of multi-homing at either or 
both ends of the association; 
– optional multiplexing of the user datagram into SCTP datagrams. 
SCTP assumes that it is running over an IPv4 or IPv6 network. 
Even more importantly, it assumes it is running over a well-
engineered IP network. This, in practice, means that there is a diverse 
routing network underneath to avoid a single point of failure. In LTE, 
SCTP handles communications between the eNodeB and the MME. 
This communication connection is very important and fragile since  
 
 

Long-Term Evolution     55 
it must be able to detect dropouts very quickly. TCP does not do  
this, whereas SCTP immediately detects and recognizes when a  
packet is dropped or a link goes down. LTE providers specifically and  
telecom networks in general need this ability to ensure a high QoS. 
Additionally SCTP has, as a default, “selective ACK” which is 
optional in TCP. What this means is that a packet will never be resent 
if it has already been acknowledged as sent. In the LTE world, where 
every bit counts, using SCTP means no wasted data. The purpose of 
the use of SCTP in LTE is to provide a robust and reliable signaling 
bearer. To achieve this, SCTP provides appropriate congestion control 
procedures, fast retransmitssion in the case of message loss, and 
enhanced reliability. It also provides additional security against blind 
attacks and will be used to increase security in connecting the LTE 
networks of different operators. 
3.6. Network discovery and selection 
The Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) is the primary 
mechanism for allocating a dynamic Point-of-Attachment (PoA) IP 
address to the UE. Note that the EPS bearer supports dual-stack IP 
addressing, meaning that it is able to transport both native IPv4 and 
native IPv6 packets. In order to support DHCP-based IP address 
configuration in (IPv4 and IPv6), the PDN-GW will act as the DHCP 
server for Home Public Land Mobile Network (HPLMN)-assigned 
dynamic and static and Visited Public Land Mobile Network 
(VPLMN)-assigned dynamic IP addressing. When DHCP is used for 
external PDN-assigned addressing and parameter configuration,  
the PDN-GW will act as the DHCP server toward the UE and it  
will act as the DHCP client toward the external DHCP server.  
The serving gateway does not have any DHCP functionality. It 
forwards all packets to and from the UE including DHCP packets as 
normal. 
The IPv6 Stateless Address auto configuration is the basic 
mechanism to allocate a /64 IPv6 prefix to the UE. Alternatively  
 
 
 

56     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
shorter than /64 IPv6 prefix delegation via DHCPv6, RFC 3633 may 
be provided, if it is supported by the PDN-GW. When DHCPv6 prefix 
delegation is not supported, the UE should use stateless address auto 
configuration RFC 4862. 
3.7. Radio resource management 
The purpose of radio resource management (RRM) is to ensure 
efficient use of the radio resources available and to provide 
mechanisms that enable E-UTRAN to meet radio resource-related 
requirements like: (1) enhanced support for end-to-end QoS, (2) 
efficient support for transmission of higher layers and (3) support  
of load sharing and policy management across different radio  
access technologies. RRM in E-UTRAN provides a means to  
manage (e.g. assign, re-assign and release) radio resources taking into 
account single- and multi-cell aspects. The RRM functions are 
represented by: 
– Radio Bearer Control (RBC): The establishment, maintenance 
and release of radio bearers involves the configuration of associated 
radio resources. When setting up a radio bearer for a service, RBC 
takes into account the overall resource situation in E-UTRAN, the 
QoS requirements of in-progress sessions and the QoS requirement for 
the new service. RBC is also concerned with the maintenance of radio 
bearers of in-progress sessions when the radio resource situation 
changes due to mobility or other reasons. RBC is involved in the 
release of radio resources associated with radio bearers at session 
termination, handover or on other occasions. RBC is located in the 
eNodeB. 
– Connection Mobility Control (CMC): CMC is concerned with the 
management of radio resources in connection with idle or connected 
mode mobility. In idle mode, the cell reselection algorithms are 
controlled 
by 
setting 
parameters 
(thresholds 
and 
hysteresis  
values) that define the best cell and/or determine when the UE  
should select a new cell. E-UTRAN broadcasts parameters that  
 
 

Long-Term Evolution     57 
configure the UE measurement and reporting procedures. In connected 
mode, the mobility of radio connections has to be supported. 
Handover decisions may be based on UE and eNodeB measurements.  
In addition, handover decisions may take other inputs, such as 
neighbor cell load, traffic distribution, transport and hardware 
resources, and operator-defined policies into account. CMC is located 
in the eNodeB.  
– Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) or Packet Scheduling (PS) 
allocates and deallocates resources (including buffer and processing 
resources and resource blocks [i.e. chunks]) to user and control plane 
packets. DRA involves several subtasks, including the selection of 
radio bearers whose packets are to be scheduled and manages the 
necessary resources (e.g. the power levels or the specific resource 
blocks used). PS typically takes into account the QoS requirements 
associated with the radio bearers, the channel quality information for 
UEs, buffer status, interference situation, etc. DRA may also take into 
account restrictions or preferences on some of the available resource 
blocks or resource block sets due to intercell interference coordination 
(ICIC) considerations. DRA is located in the eNodeB.  
– intercell interference coordination (ICIC) manages radio 
resources (notably, radio resource blocks) such that intercell 
interference is kept under control. ICIC is inherently a multi-cell RRM 
function that needs to take into account information (e.g. the resource 
usage status and traffic load situation) from multiple cells. The 
preferred ICIC method may be different in the uplink and downlink. 
ICIC is located in the eNodeB. 
– Load Balancing (LB) has the task to handle the uneven 
distribution of traffic over multiple cells. The purpose of LB is thus to 
influence the load distribution in such a manner that radio resources 
remain highly utilized and the QoS of for sessions in progress is 
maintained to the best possible extent and call dropping probabilities 
are kept sufficiently small. LB algorithms may result in handover or 
cell reselection decisions with the purpose of redistributing traffic  
 
 
 

58     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
from highly loaded cells to underutilized cells. LB is located in the 
eNodeB. 
– Inter-RAT RRM is primarily concerned with the management of 
radio resources in connection with inter-RAT mobility, notably inter-
RAT handover. At inter-RAT handover, the handover decision may 
take into account the RAT resource situation as well as UE 
capabilities and operator policies. The importance of inter-RAT RRM 
may depend on the specific scenario in which E-UTRAN is deployed. 
Inter-RAT RRM may also include functionality for inter-RAT load 
balancing for idle and connected mode UEs. 
– Subscriber profile ID for RAT/frequency priority (SPID) The 
RRM strategy in E-UTRAN may be based on user-specific 
information. The SPID parameter received by the eNodeB via the S1 
interface is an index referring to user information (e.g. mobility profile 
and service usage profile). The information is UE specific and applies 
to all its radio bearers. This index is mapped by the eNodeB to a 
locally defined configuration in order to apply specific RRM 
strategies (e.g. to define RRC_IDLE mode priorities and control inter-
RAT/interfrequency handover in RRC_CONNECTED mode). 
3.8. Authentication and authorization 
The trust model in LTE (see Figure 3.9) is similar to that of 
UMTS. It can roughly be described as a secure core network, while 
radio access nodes and interfaces between the core network and the 
radio access nodes are vulnerable to attack. The system architecture 
for LTE is flatter than that of UMTS, having no node that corresponds 
to the Radio Network Controller (RNC) in UMTS. Therefore, the UE 
user plane security must be terminated either in the LTE eNodeB or in 
a core network node.  
For reasons of efficiency, it has been terminated in the eNodeB. 
However, because eNodeBs and backhaul links might be deployed in 
locations that are vulnerable to attack, some new security mechanisms 
have been added. Security over the LTE air interface is provided  
 
 

Long-Term Evolution     59 
through strong cryptographic techniques. The backhaul link from the 
eNodeB to the core network makes use of Internet Key Exchange 
(IKE) and the IP Security Protocol (IPSec) when cryptographic 
protection is needed. Strong cryptographic techniques provide end-to-
end protection for signaling between the core network and UE. 
Therefore, the main location where user traffic is threatened by 
exposure is in the eNodeB. To minimize susceptibility to attacks, the 
eNodeB needs to provide a secure environment that supports the 
execution of sensitive operations, such as the encryption or decryption 
of user data and the storage of sensitive data like keys for securing UE 
communication, 
long-term 
cryptographic 
secrets 
and 
vital 
configuration data. Likewise, the use of sensitive data must be  
confined to this secure environment. Even with the above security 
measures in place, one must consider attacks on an eNodeB, because, 
if successful, they could give attackers full control of eNodeB and its 
signaling to UEs and other nodes. To limit the effect of a successful 
attack on one eNodeB, attackers must not be able to intercept or 
manipulate user and signaling plane traffic that traverses another 
eNodeB – for example, after handover. 
3.8.1. User authentication, key agreement and key 
generation 
The subscriber-authentication function in the LTE/3GPP EPS is 
based on the UMTS Authentication and Key Agreement (UMTS 
AKA) protocol. It provides mutual authentication between the UE and 
core network, ensuring robust charging and guaranteeing that no 
fraudulent entities can pose as a valid network node. Note that GSM 
SIMs are not allowed in LTE because they do not provide adequate 
security. EPS AKA provides a root key from which a key hierarchy is 
derived. The keys in this hierarchy are used to protect signaling and 
user plane traffic between the UE and network. The key hierarchy is 
derived using cryptographic functions. For example, if key2 and key3 
(used in two different eNodeBs) are keys derived from key1 by a  
 
 
 
 

60     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
MME, an attacker who gets hold of key2 still cannot deduce key3 or 
key1, which is on a higher layer in the key hierarchy.  
Keys are bound to where, how and for which purpose they are 
used. This ensures, for example, that keys used for one access network 
cannot be used in another access network, and that the same key is not 
used for multiple purposes or with different algorithms. Because GSM 
does not have this feature, attackers who break one algorithm in GSM 
can also compromise the security offered when other algorithms use 
the same key. The key hierarchy and binding also make it possible to 
routinely and efficiently change the keys used between a UE and 
eNodeBs (for example, during handover) without changing the root 
key or the keys used to protect signaling between the UE and core 
network.

Long-Term Evolution     61 
3.8.2. Signaling and user-plane security 
For radio-specific signaling, LTE provides integrity, replay 
protection and encryption between the UE and eNodeB. Internet Key 
Exchange (IKE)/IPSec can protect the backhaul signaling between the 
eNodeB and MME. In addition, LTE-specific protocols provide end-
to-end protection of signaling between the MME and UE. For user-
plane traffic, IKE/IPSec can protect the backhaul from the eNodeB to 
the S-GW). Support for integrity, replay protection and encryption is 
mandatory in eNodeB. The user-plane traffic between the UE and 
eNodeB is only protected by encryption as integrity protection would 
result in expensive bandwidth overhead. It is not possible to 
intelligently inject traffic on behalf of another user: attackers are 
essentially blind in the sense that any traffic they try to inject would 
almost certainly decrypt to garbage. 
3.9. Fundamentals of the MAC layer in LTE 
The important feature of the MAC layer in LTE eNB is to offer 
RRC functionalities related to the control plane. It achieves different 
functions: RRM admission control, scheduling and enforcement of 
negotiated QoS, cell information broadcast, ciphering/deciphering of 
user, control plane data and compression/decompression of 
downlink/uplink user plane packet headers. The protocol architecture 
of the LTE air interface can be separated between control and user 
planes. In the user plane, the application creates data packets that are 
processed by protocols such as TCP, UDP and IP; instead, in the 
control plane, the RRC protocol generates the signaling messages that 
are exchanged between eNB and UE. 
3.9.1. Traffic classes and quality of service 
Managing the quality of user experience in LTE is an issue which 
is treated carefully by 3GPP as it introduced some QoS mechanisms 
that allow the operators to best manage the different quality of  
 
 

62     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
experience of users subject to different types of application use. Such 
QoS mechanisms are introduced in both control and use planes. For 
example, the control plane mechanisms are used to permit the 
negotiation between the UEs and the network in order to agree on the 
different QoS requirements, recognize which UEs and applications are 
associated with which type of QoS and let the network correctly 
assign resources to each type of service. However, the QoS 
mechanism in the user plane has the role of agreeing those QoS 
requirements and controlling network resource consumption for an 
application/user pair. This leads to a conclusion that many 
applications can be run in a UE and eNB in the same time, each of 
which has different QoS parameters and requirements. Consequently, 
it is imperative to set up different bearers to support those multiple 
QoS requirements. Each bearer is associated with a QoS support 
mechanism. Broadly speaking, bearers in LTE are categorized into 
classes depending on the nature of the QoS they are providing: (1) 
minimum guaranteed bit rate (GBR) bearers, which are used mainly 
for real-time applications that require a guaranteed QoS parameters 
and (2) non-GBR bearers associated with non-real-time applications 
that do not need a permanent resource allocation guarantee. 
3.9.2. Mobility 
LTE introduced a hybrid mobile network architecture supporting 
radio access technologies and several mobility mechanisms. The EPC 
introduced an important mobility management entity called MME, 
which manages mobility when UEs are handing over from one cell to 
another in a very transparent way to the end user. LTE defined the 
procedures and the protocols to achieve mobility and handover 
to/from 3GPP and non-3GPP technologies. In this chapter, we are 
focusing more on the case when there is handover between 
macro/femtocell and macro/picocells. We are interested in the 
handover of UEs among LTE-A technology based HetNet. The 
movement from macrocell to femtocell is quite difficult due to the 
large number of candidate femtocells in the area of convergence and  
 
 
 

Long-Term Evolution     63 
the characteristics of the femtocell entity. These characteristics can be 
defined as the different access modes introduced in a femtocell and the 
radio resource allocation method. The selection and decision to 
handover to femtocell access point are hard to make. However, when 
users of macrocells are trying to handover to a picocell, other issues 
and challenges should be considered, this can be represented by the 
cell range expansion introduced in a picocell, the mobility is 
considered to be load balanced as by increasing the range of the cell, 
the probability of handover from macrocell to picocells will increase 
and it will not be based on the quality of signal but mainly on the load 
on the picocells. 
3.9.3. Resource scheduling algorithms 
In a mobile communication, the Robust Secure Routing Protocol 
(RSRP) of UEs won't be the same since this is due to different factors 
related mainly to the network environment, such as UE location. The 
best CQIs from the users always become the basis radio bearer 
selection  in resource scheduling assignments. In other words, the 
scheduling operator selects the UEs whose channel quality is better 
than those located in the cell-edge. The cell-edge UEs normally 
experience more interference from the neighboring signal than the 
cell-center UEs. Although the best CQI can achieve a high system 
throughput, conversely those UEs who have received a poor signal, 
due to interference parameter or are far away from the served base 
station, as will not participate in the network scheduling system. 
Selecting UEs with the best CQI for resource scheduling is an 
unfair problem in the resource assignment process. In this chapter, we 
have adopted two opportunistic scheduling strategies for scheduling 
the whole contribution:  
– Exponential Proportional Fair (EX-PF) which is able to increase 
fairness among UEs. The scheduler scheme assigns the UEs by 
comparing the ratio of current data rate to the average data rate of a  
 
 
 

64     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
particular users. Fairness can be addressed in this strategy while 
maintaining comparable long-term throughput for all users. Along 
with fairness and throughput, packet delay is a key parameter in 
measuring the performance of high delay sensitive real-time 
applications like video streaming, etc., while the presented scheduling 
does not consider packet delay for each individual user. As a result, it 
is not suitable for the scheduling of real time services. 
– Modified Largest Weighted Delay First (MLWDF) is able to 
handle delay-sensitive traffic well. It schedules the UEs by comparing 
the combination of packet delay, current data rate and average data 
rate in an optimal way. MLWDF exploits asynchronous channel 
variations and allows different mobile terminals to transmit at a 
different bit-rate or signal-to-interface-plus-noise-ratio (SINR), so that 
higher efficiency can be achieved. However, it does not provide 
explicit QoS guarantees such as data rate to cell-edge users. 
3.10. Fundamentals of the LTE physical layer 
The physical LTE layer is based on OFDMA technology. OFDMA 
is the multiple access/multiplexing transmission scheme which has 
high efficiency, multiplexing data stream operations from multiple 
users 
to 
enable 
high-speed 
data, 
video 
and 
multimedia 
communications and has been used by a variety of commercial 
broadband systems, including DSL, WiFi, etc. In this section, we 
cover the basics of OFDMA and provide an overview of the physical 
LTE layer. 
3.10.1. Slot and frame structure in LTE OFDMA 
Before detailing the physical layer’s generic frame structure, it is 
worth mention in that the downlink and uplink transmissions in LTE 
use one of two duplexing modes: TDD or FDD in which the duplex is 
realized in time and frequency, respectively. TDD and FDD modes are 
widely deployed in the existing cellular system; they both have their  
 
 
 

Long-Term Evolution     65 
own advantages and disadvantages. The operator usually selects the 
duplexing format according to the applications supported. However, in 
practical deployment systems, FDD is the most frequently used mode 
due to its reduced complexity. 
OFDMA depends on an OFDM physical layer. OFDM is a 
multicarrier transmission technique that divides the available 
bandwidth into a large number of small radio-frequency channels. In 
other words, OFDM is a multiplexing technique that subdivides the 
bandwidth into multiple frequency subcarriers, each set subcarriers is 
sub-channel or resource block (RB). An RB is a grid of rectangular 
resource elements, which consists of 12 consecutive subcarriers in the 
frequency domain and six or seven OFDMA symbols in the time 
domain. Thus, in an OFDM system, a RB is available in the time 
domain by means of OFDM symbols and in the frequency domain by 
means of subcarriers. The total number of RBs available depends on 
the overall transmission bandwidth of the system. LTE-A 
specification defines different exploitable bandwidths from 1.4 to 20 
MHz which correspond, to 6 and 100 RBs respectively. 
Generally, in a LTE OFDM physical system, the input data stream 
is divided into several parallel substreams of reduced data rate and 
each substream is modulated and transmitted on separate orthogonal 
subcarriers, while the orthogonality among carriers depends on the 
cyclic prefix (CP) duration or the increased symbol duration improve 
the robustness of OFDM to delay spread. It means that the CP can 
completely eliminate inter-symbol interference when CP duration is 
longer than the channel delay spread. The minimum allocation 
bandwidth for a UE is one RB (180 KHz), which is carried out by the 
MAC scheme in each subframe as it is the sublayer which is 
responsible for scheduling transmission over the LTE air interface in 
both downlink/uplink directions. It must be noted that in all OFDMA 
systems, the scheduler decides which users are allowed to transmit 
and which RBs to assign to each user. Usually, the RB assignment to 
UEs operates under each 1 ms transmission time interval. The 
scheduler must also decide the quantity of power to apply to  
 
 

66     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
each RB as well as a suitable modulation and coding scheme (MCS) 
to be assigned to each user. Figure 3.10 shows the LTE-A radio frame 
structure of 10 ms duration divided into 10 subframes, each consisting 
of two slots of 0.5 ms. 
 
Figure 3.10. Generic frame structure  
in the LTE/E-UTRA downlink 
Due to frequency-selective interference and fading fluctuations 
along the spectrum, different users can experience diverse channel 
conditions in a given subcarrier. While the contiguous permutation 
group subcarriers form RB, which is also known as band-AMC, it  
 
 
 

Long-Term Evolution     67 
enables multiuser diversity by choosing subcarriers for the mobile 
terminal with the best signal quality received. In the OFDMA system, 
the transmitters need the average CQI feedback from users to apply 
the link adaptation, precoding preequalization, and adaptive 
transmission antenna diversity in order to maximize spectral 
efficiency. Table 3.3 describes the different MCSs supported by LTE-
A, indexed according to CQI. As explained, if the channel is high 
fade, low order modulation is employed; conversely, if the channel is 
in good condition a high data rate can be achieved by employing high-
order modulation. Similarly, code rate and transmission power can be 
optimized according to the instantaneous channel conditions and the 
required transmission rate and reliability. Moreover, when a mobile 
terminal is assigned with diversity subchannelization, it sends the 
reported CQIs back to its base station. This is equivalent to the SINR 
level over each of the divided subcarriers or RBs. According to the 
CQI method reported, the base station can know the SINR, and then 
determine the appropriate MCS level for each RB. These options 
enable the system designer to trade mobility for throughput.

68     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
3.10.2. Reference signals 
To allow for coherent demodulation at the UE, reference symbols 
(or pilot symbols) are inserted in the OFDM time-frequency grid to 
allow for channel estimation. Downlink reference symbols are 
inserted within the first and third last OFDM symbol of each slot with 
a frequency domain spacing of six subcarriers (this corresponds to the 
fifth and fourth OFDM symbols of the slot for a normal and extended 
cyclic prefix, respectively) as shown in Figure 3.10 for LTE system 
with one antenna in normal CP mode. Furthermore, there is frequency 
domain staggering of three sub carriers between the first and second 
reference symbols. Therefore, there are four reference symbols within 
each RB. The UE will interpolate over multiple reference symbols to 
estimate the channel. For two transmission antennas, reference signals 
are inserted from each antenna where the reference signals on the 
second antenna are offset in the frequency domain by three sub 
carriers. To allow the UE to accurately estimate the channel 
coefficients, nothing is transmitted on the other antenna at the same 
time-frequency location of the reference signals. 
The reference symbols have complex values, which are determined 
according to the symbol position as well as the cell. LTE 
specifications refer to this as a two-dimensional reference-signal 
sequence, which indicates the LTE cell identity. There are 510 
reference signal sequences corresponding to 510 different cell 
identities. The reference signals are derived from the production of a 
two-dimensional pseudo-random sequence and a two-dimensional 
orthogonal sequence. There are 170 different pseudo-random 
sequences corresponding to 170 cell identity groups and three 
orthogonal sequences, each corresponding to a specific cell identity 
within the cell identity group. Reference signals are generated as the 
product of an orthogonal sequence and a pseudo-random numerical 
(PRN) sequence. Overall, there are 510 unique reference signals 
possible. A specified reference signal is assigned to each cell within a 
network and acts as a cell-specific identifier. 
 

Long-Term Evolution     69 
As shown in Figure 3.11, reference signals are transmitted on 
equally spaced subcarriers within the first and third last OFDM 
symbol of each slot. UE must get an accurate committed information 
rate (CIR) from each transmitting antenna. Therefore, when a 
reference signal is transmitted from one antenna port, the other 
antenna ports in the cell are idle. Reference signals are sent on every 
sixth subcarrier. CIR estimates for subcarriers that do not bear 
reference signals are computed via interpolation. Changing the 
subcarriers that bear reference signals by pseudo-random frequency 
hopping is also under consideration.

symbol within a resource block

many extensions in femtocells, machine-to-machine, public safety 
warnings (Tsunami, etc.), and finally a green agenda (optimization of 
eNodeB). The latter was particularly exciting given the tremendous 
increase in the capacity requested by customers.

Long-Term Evolution Advanced 
LTE Advanced (LTE–A) is a real broadband wireless network that 
provides peak data rates equal to or even greater than those for wired 
networks, i.e. Fiber To The Home (FTTH), while providing better 
quality of service (QoS). The major high-level requirements of LTE-A 
are reduced network cost (cost per bit), better service provisioning and 
compatibility with 3GPP systems. LTE-A is backward compatible 
with LTE. LTE-A was standardized by 3GPP UMTS Release 10 with 
the following main items: Fill native IP, Multiple MIMO, smart 
antenna, directive antenna, cognitive radio, relay and mesh techniques, 
green properties, and femtocells.  
Extensions are provided with UMTS Release 11 with the 
introduction of service-oriented mobile networks, heterogeneous 
networks (HetNet), Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) operation and 
In-Device Co-Existence (IDC) allowing us to take into account 
interference between bands due to signal distortion. 
More extensions are provided with Release 12: 
– improvements in spectral efficiency; 
– LTE carrier aggregation; 
– multi access;

– machine-type communications (MTCs); 
– interworking between mobile operators;  
– continuity of data sessions in local networks; 
– telepresence. 
Some extensions are available through Release 13 which should  
increase focus on virtualization and LTE Unlicensed (LTE-U) 
allowing the aggregation of primary carriers in a licensed spectrum 
with secondary carriers in the unlicensed spectrum.  
The features that can be found in LTE-A technology are: 
– The peak data rate: LTE-A supports significantly increased 
instantaneous peak data rates. At a minimum, LTE-A supports 
enhanced peak data rates to take charge of advanced services and 
applications (200 Mbps for high and 1 Gbps for low mobility as, 
shown in Table 4.1). 
– Mobility: the system supports mobility across the cellular 
network for various mobile speeds up to 350 km/h (or perhaps even up 
to 500 km/h, depending on the frequency band). System performance 
is enhanced for 0–10 km/h and preferably enhanced but no worse than 
Evolved Units Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) and Evolved 
Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Networks (E-UTRAN) for higher 
speeds.  
– Enhanced multi-antenna transmission techniques: in LTE-A, the 
MIMO scheme has been improved in the area of spectrum efficiency, 
average cell throughput and cell-edge performances. With multipoint 
transmission/reception, the antennas of multiple cell sites are utilized 
in such a way that the transmitting/receiving antennas of the serving 
cell and the neighboring cells can improve quality of the signal 
received by the UE and reduce co-channel interference from 
neighboring cells. Peak spectrum efficiency is directly proportional to 
the number of antennas used. 
– Layered Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access 
(OFDMA): OFDMA is used for radio access for LTE-A (Table 4.1).  
 

Long-Term Evolution Advanced     75 
A technique known as carrier aggregation is used by the layered 
OFDMA to combine multiple LTE component carriers (from LTE 
Release 8) on the physical layer to provide the necessary bandwidth. 
Thus, the layered OFDMA radio access can fulfill significantly higher 
requirements with respect to system performance and capability 
parameters compared to the radio access approach used in LTE 
Release 8. The continuous spectrum allocation concept (used by 
layered OFDMA for LTE-A) was adopted by the 3GPP Radio Access 
Working Group, as the approach is backward compatible with LTE 
Release 8 user equipment (UE) and can be deployed with IP 
functionality capabilities, low latency and low cost with the existing 
Radio Access Network (RAN).

Digital information including all types of data generates heavy 
traffic that needs to be addressed by telecommunication companies.  
 
 

76     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
LTE and LTE-A systems, popularly known as 4G technology, are 
considered the technology of choice since they provide cost-effective  
methods for efficient use of the radio spectrum. With the introduction 
of the new radio access in LTE which is called Evolved UMTS  
Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN), LTE has significantly  
improved end-user QoS in terms of throughput, capacity, and reduced 
user plane latency. It has enhanced user experience by supporting full 
mobility. LTE/LTE-A also delivers and supports IP-based traffic with 
end-to-end QoS. Introducing different types of access networks in 
LTE is essential to cope with the increasing number of mobile 
broadband data subscribers and bandwidth-intensive services 
competing for limited radio resources in 4G networks. Since the sole 
macrocell cannot meet mobile user have requirements in terms of 
QoS, LTE-A specifications introduced small cells through the addition 
of low-power base stations to existing eNBs. These small cells, 
namely picocells, femtocells and WiFi hotspots, can offload traffic 
from highly loaded macrocells. Furthermore, LTE-A also introduced 
the use of relay nodes to expand the area of the macrocells and offer 
cell-edge users better signal quality and prevent them being penalized 
by the poor signal transmitted from the eNB. 
A generic LTE-A HetNet architecture consists of different types of 
Radio Access Networks (RANs) or cells: a collocated macrocell, 
picocells, femtocells and relay nodes, as shown in Figure 4.1. The 
eNBs are interconnected with each other via the X2-interface while 
they are connected to the core network (CN) of the operator  
through the S1-interface. The main difference between each RAN and 
CN is the split in functionality. The CN architecture is referred to as 
the Evolved Packet Core (EPC). Together, the LTE-A RAN and the 
EPC can be referred to as the Evolved Packet System (EPS). EPC 
supports access to the packet-switched domain only, with no access to 
the circuit-switched domain, and it consists of several different types 
of nodes. 
While the LTE-A RAN uses a flat architecture with a single type of 
node, a macrocell is an umbrella for different types of small cells 
(picocells or femtocells) and can connect farther users through the  
 

Long-Term Evolution Advanced     77 
relay nodes deployed. The RAN is responsible for all radio-related 
functionality of the overall network including scheduling, radio-
resource handling, retransmission protocols, coding and various multi-
antenna schemes. 
 
Figure 4.1. Heterogeneous wireless network architecture 
4.2. Small cell concepts 
Different terms have been used by different operators to clarify and 
distinguish the low-power base stations. Small cell mobile technology 
is mostly operated in the same licensed spectrum as macrocells. The 
most frequently nominated unlicensed small cell is WiFi, which 
provides certain features making it a valuable component of many 
operators’ mobile data strategies. 
4.2.1. Picocell 
Picocell coverage is formed through the use of a low-power  
node base station called a picocell base station (PBS). It is typically of  
 
 
 

78     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
a smaller order of magnitude to eNB, since PBS integrates an  
antenna radiating transmission power ranging from 23 to 30 dBm. 
Omni-directional antennas installed for picocells are different from 
those used for MBSs sectorial. Moreover, the operator can deploy 
picocells using the same backhaul and access features as classical 
eNBs. Picocells can be deployed to fill macrocell gaps or to provide 
an extra data service where installed, typically in hotspots (for 
example, malls). 
4.2.2. Femtocells 
A femtocell, also called Home eNodeB (HeNodeB), is a low-
power node base station installed by the end-user typically, in an 
indoor installation, and is an important part of HetNets. It offers 
network operators a means of providing good indoor coverage for 
different types of traffic voice, video and high data services. FBSs are 
connected to the network operator’s backhaul via a wired  
Internet connection such as Digital Subscriber Line (DSL), fiber optic 
or cable broadband access. The use of femtocells offers several 
advantages to both the service operator and the end-user. The most 
important aspect of femtocell design is the access mode mechanism. 
Femtocells can be configured with three different types of access 
mode. 
4.2.3. Relays 
Relay nodes represent a low cost solution for extending macrocell 
coverage and/or improving the throughput of cell-edge users. Unlike 
other HetNet nodes, such as picocells or femtocells, that are connected 
to the MBS through X2 or Internet backhaul connections, relay nodes 
(RNs) use a wireless link to connect to the MBS. Generally, a RN can 
be considered as a access point that decodes/sends data or 
forwards/broadcasts information received from a base station in this 
case it is called Donor eNB (DeNB) or type-II RN, as it does not have 
a cell ID or a realistic mobility model (RMM). A type-I RN is  
 
 

Long-Term Evolution Advanced     79 
considered as a small base station with its own cell ID, broadcasts 
information, and can proceed on RMM based on its own reference 
signals.

4.3. Femtocell and macrocell integration architecture 
When there is an integrated architecture of femtocell and 
macrocells, we can consider a geographical area that is totally covered 
by LTE macro and femtocells. Within the macrocell, an eNB 
coordinates all data transmissions for UE while in each femtocell the 
HeNB is the principal entity controlling transmission in the cell. 
Generally, a UE is able to connect to each network if it is in the 
corresponding coverage area and perfect power control is assumed to 
ensure a uniform transmission rate across the coverage area. The 
architecture used to integrate both macro and femtocells is illustrated 
in Figure 4.2. The E-UTRAN, which is considered as an access 
network in the LTE network, permits us to connect the eNB and 
HeNB to their gateways. The HeNB gateway or the S-GW routes and 
forwards user data packets between both networks through MME. 
MME in our case can be considered a centralized entity that controls 
the resource allocation and interference mitigation between both 
networks.

Figure 4.2. Femtocell and macrocell integration architecture 
4.4. Picocell and macrocell integration architecture 
Picocells are one of the key solutions which can be deployed 
efficiently in saturated areas and can improve the overall system 
capacity of a region covered by scarce macrocell penetration 
regardless the coverage type (indoor or outdoor). Despite its benefits, 
the classical cell selection procedure, which is achieved by comparing 
and selecting the cell with the maximum received signal strength 
(RSS) as the user serving cell, introduces uneven traffic load 
distribution in the network, since most of the UEs connect to the MBS 
rather than the PBS. Consequently, the macrocell is loaded, whereas 
the picocells are offloaded. To encourage traffic offloading from the 
macrocell to its overlaid picocells in a HetNet, cell range expansion 
has been widely envisioned, enabling more macro users to be 
offloaded to the less saturated picocells, enhancing the throughput 
performance of the entire system. 
In order to overcome an inadequate picocell data offloading, the 
concept of cell range expansion has recently been introduced in 3GPP  
 

Long-Term Evolution Advanced     81 
LTE-A by defining a positive bias value to be added to the PBS RSS 
during cell selection. In this way, more MUEs are offloaded to 
picocells even if the RSSs of the selected picocells are below those of 
the macrocells (see Figure 4.3). 
 
Figure 4.3. Cell range expansion 
4.5. Interference mitigation in heterogeneous networks 
A HetNet consists of a classical macrocell layout with low power 
nodes placed throughout their coverage zones. Consequently, a 
HetNet has completely different interference characteristics compared 
to homogeneous deployment and attention must be paid to these 
differences when planning frequency reuse. We are interested in the 
interference generated in two-tier systems, and more especially 
macrocell/femtocell and macrocell/picocell systems. The interference 
in two-tier networks is generally of two types: 
– co-tier interference, which occurs between cells belonging to the 
same tier, for example between two neighboring femtocells or 
macrocells; 
– cross-tier interference, which occurs between cells belonging to 
different tiers, such as femtocell and macrocell or vice-versa. 

82     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
4.5.1. Interference mitigation in the context of two-tier 
macrofemtocells  
Generally, the impact of interference between different tiers, in our 
case macrofemtocells, depends on the techniques used for spectrum 
assignment and/or the access method used by the network. 
4.5.2. Frequency spectral assignment 
Interference in cross-tier heterogeneous networks can be mitigated 
via appropriate frequency reuse schemes, especially when the operator 
exploits several licensed bands. Several options can be considered for 
frequency allocation:  
1) Fully dedicated band: each tier of the overlaid network is 
assigned a different frequency band; consequently the cross-tier 
interference is totally avoided. This approach shows low network 
spectral efficiency because each tier can only access a subset of the 
frequency resources. If we consider the case of LTE, which is based 
on OFDMA technology, the terminology “orthogonal allocation” is 
usually used and the available subchannels are divided into two 
subsets, one used only by the macrocell tier, the other allocated to the 
femtocell tier. 
2) Shared spectrum band (universal reuse scheme): both tiers  
share the same frequency band leading to use of total frequency  
band. Despite this positive aspect (in terms of spectral efficiency),  
this method produces severe interference that would degrade  
overall network performance and has to be handled. In LTE  
OFDMA systems, this allocation is referred to as “co-channel” 
assignment. 
3) Partially shared band: is an intermediate solution which 
provides a tradeoff between spectral efficiency and cross-tier 
interference by combining the fully dedicated and shared spectrum 
approaches. In this assignment scheme, macrocell users can access the 
whole frequency spectrum, while femtocells operate in a subset of it. 
If some MUEs experience high interference in the shared  
 

Long-Term Evolution Advanced     83 
spectrum due to their vicinity of the coverage of the other tiers, they 
are moved to the dedicated band (see Figure 4.4). This approach is 
referred to as “hybrid assignment” in the LTE system. 
 
Figure 4.4. Assignment of carrier frequencies 
4.6. Interference mitigation in the context of two-tier 
macropicocells  
The interference mitigation problem generated in a scenario where 
the macro and picocells coexist is different from the one presented in 
the macro and femtocell context. This is mainly due to the open access 
nature of picocells’ deployment as they are managed for the network 
operator. Unlike the closed access mode femtocells, picocells can 
always handle macrocell users. Hence, the mobile terminals are 
always associated with a cell offering a higher quality of Reverse 
Reservation Protocol (RSRP). Nevertheless, the user association with 
the highest RSRP might not always be desirable due to: 
– load-balancing: as the range of picocell areas is much smaller 
than the macrocells as well as the mobility behavior of most cell 
phone users, the number of mobile terminals served by the PBSs is 
much smaller than the number of MBS users. Consequently, the 
amount of traffic in the picocell may change very dynamically, 
leading to unbalanced load among different tiers; 

84     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
– mobility consideration: as in any other open-access small cell, 
cell phone users served by the picocell experience interference from 
either macrocells and/or neighboring picocells. The mobility behavior 
causes the mobile user rapidly to change their served cell, or the 
undesired strength signal is detected where the Radio Link Failure 
(RLF) procedure is declared and the mobile user desires to reinitiate to 
the strongest RSRP. Consequently, the number of handover 
procedures is expected to increase compared to that for homogenous 
networks.

4.7. Coordinated multi-point transmission/reception 
LTE-A attempts to enhance the proposed inter-eNB coordination 
adding coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission/reception. 
Making use of CoMP, several cells may coordinate data  
 
 
 

Long-Term Evolution Advanced     85 
transmissions to serve users located between cells who are suffering 
from low signal qualities. Utilizing this approach, cell-edge intercell  
interference could be significantly mitigated, because neighboring 
cells become serving cells. In a similar way, macrocells and 
femtocells may also coordinate resource assignments utilizing CoMP 
principles to enhance network performance and mitigate user outages. 
However, because the same information should be transmitted and/or 
received at the same time in the same subchannel in neighboring cells, 
CoMP represents a challenge from the coordination viewpoint. Thus, 
CoMP schemes involving both macrocells and femtocells are an 
interesting research topic. 
4.8. Carrier aggregation 
In order to fulfill the LTE-A requirements in terms of data rate, the 
3GPP working group came up with a method of carrier aggregation to 
support a wider transmission bandwidth for more than 20 MHz which 
was specified in 3GPP Release 8/9. Carrier aggregation is one of the 
most distinct features of 4G LTE-A. Carrier aggregation allows the 
expansion of effective bandwidth delivered to a user terminal through 
simultaneous use of radio resources across multiple carriers. Multiple 
component carriers are aggregated to form a larger overall 
transmission bandwidth. Each aggregated carrier is referred to as a 
component carrier. The component carrier can have a bandwidth of 
1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, or 20 MHz and a maximum of five component 
carriers can be aggregated, hence the maximum aggregated bandwidth 
is 100 MHz. The best way to make use of carrier aggregation is to use  
contiguous 
component 
carriers 
within 
the 
same 
operating  
frequency band as specified by LTE, in this case the aggregation is 
called intra-band contiguous. This might be hard, especially for 
operators that have their own frequency planning problems or  
non-contiguous carrier aggregation with some gaps in the frequency 
carrier see, for example, Figure 4.6.

4.9. LTE Advanced evolution toward 5G 
Over the past few years, effort has been made to describe the 
specification of 5G mobile and wireless technology. No standards 
gathered all these specifications in one common standard which is 
why 3GPP  started to define the road map for 5G..   Th e las t 3GP P
release, which is Release 14, started to define what 5G will look like. 
This initiative is one of the most important and, as stated on the 3GPP

5G 
Along with the efforts of 3GPP to deliver evolved specifications 
for LTE Advanced (LTA-A), that include many revolutionary 
characteristics described Chapter 4, there is an initiative within 3GPP 
itself to define the specifications of 5G in its latest release so this 
technology will be used in 2020 and beyond. Release 14 is being 
developed and buzzwords are: 
– Internet of Things; 
– C-RAN (Cloud RAN); 
– full virtualization; 
– low bit-cost; 
– high spectral and energy efficiency. 
These specifications cover new techniques that enable the high 
data rate to satisfy the high demand of different types of traffic, lower 
cost bits to be delivered by 5G, and less energy to be consumed to 
transmit a bit. 
Besides these important characteristics, there are many scenarios 
expected where billions of wireless devices will be deployed and 
should communicate wirelessly. This will bring a new challenge

Figure 5.1. Tentative 3GPP timeline for 5G 
5.1. From LTE Advanced to 5G: the big transition 
As shown in Figure 5.1, 5G will be ready in 2020. However, it is 
difficult to understand what the specification for 5G will be from the 
figure, and whether there is a gap between the evolution of LTE-A 
and the first 5G specifications. Work is still in progress on recent 
releases, especially release 14 and beyond, as LTE-A witnessed the 
addition of new features that make it the perfect technology of the 
future. However, it is important to understand the soft transition from 
LTE-A to 5G as once the releases finish, the next step will be 
introducing new services on top of features introduced in LTE-A. 
Thus, one can understand 5G as the enhancement of the radio 
capabilities used in LTE-A for different types of networks and 
communication technologies. 
 
 

5G     91 
Through this chapter, we will show how LTE-A paved the way  
for 5G. Then, we will introduce the radio capabilities that should be 
added to evolved elements in LTE-A in order to form what we  
call 5G. 
5.1.1. D2D communication 
 In the LTE Release 12 and beyond, focus will be on network- 
controlled device-to-device-communication or D2D, where the 
macrocell base station performs control signaling in terms of 
synchronization, beacon signal configuration and providing identity 
and security management. As D2D allows devices in close proximity 
to communicate directly with each other, they enable authorities  
to 
communicate 
out-of-network-coverage 
or 
during 
network  
outages (e.g. in the case of a natural disaster). There are also 
commercial benefits of D2D, with new applications building on the 
physical proximity of users. The enhanced D2D in LTE-A concerns 
the introduction of group communications that allow authorities to 
create and dissolve groups on demand with resource-efficient 
communications (e.g. multicast) within the group. 
 
Figure 5.2. D2D LTE communication for vehicular networks 

92     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
5.1.2. Green activities saving energy 
One of the most important challenges that 5G should address is 
operator energy consumption switching on their networks throughout 
the city. This is why one of the characteristics of LTE-A specifications 
is the use of green concepts. Any operator providing a LTE service 
uses the energy-saving management functions specified in LTE in 
order to reduce Tx power, switch off/on cell, etc., based on 
measurements made in the network showing there is no need. For the 
full set of network capabilities to remain active. In order to decrease 
the power consumed, it is important to know how to (1) retrieve 
energy consumption measurements, (2) retrieve traffic load 
measurements and (3) adjust network resource capabilities. 
5.1.3. LTE–WiFi integration for traffic offloading 
With the increasing and rapid growth of traffic through the use of 
billions of smartphones, we need to know how to deal with the huge 
amount of traffic that an LTE operator has to process. LTE uses small 
cells, which can be represented by femtocells, metrocells, etc., to 
offload traffic from macrocells by positioning the small cells either 
inside the macrocell or at the edge. The best choice is the deployment 
of WiFi as an integrated part of the cellular network because the 
operator can cope with high traffic. The 3GPP proposes using WiFi to 
offload the macrocell, especially for the bulk traffic that does not 
require any special handling for service delivery or charging. The 
3GPP-standard mechanism for this is built around a new functional 
element, the Access Network Discovery and Selection Function 
(ANDSF). The ANDSF conveys policies to devices facilitating 
selection of either cellular or WiFi access for different kinds of traffic, 
as shown in Figure 5.3. 

5G     93 
 
Figure 5.3. Access network discovery and selection (ANDSF) 
5.1.4. Vehicular communication  
Vehicular communication (V2X) has many uses, including 
navigation and driver assistance, travel information, congestion 
avoidance, fleet management, payment transactions and traffic control 
and safety. V2X can include many scenarios, just like vehicular-to- 
vehicular or vehicular-to-pedestrian communication. The use of LTE-
A in such a context is advantageous since it provides many 
capabilities over which many services can be built once it is integrated 
technically in V2X. For example, V2X moving in all directions is not 
a big obstacle for LTE-A as it already has extensive coverage in rural 
and urban area, besides the low latency and high capacity make the 
deployment of V2X easier. One more important issue is the enabling 
of D2D communication in LTE that would facilitate the 
communication of these mobile vehicles by the use of such 
communications. 

94     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
5.2. Some characteristics envisioned for 5G 
5G mobile and wireless communication system characteristics 
should meet the requirements of IMT2020. These characteristics will 
not only be satisfied through the use of new and advanced features, 
but through new types of business segments that will open once the 
5G becomes the technology of choice. 
5.2.1. Massive capacity support 
In dense areas, where there is heavy traffic, many users and a  
huge number of base stations, there is a need for technologies beyond 
LTE-A. Different scenarios can be perceived. Small cells can be used 
as proposed in LTE offload big cells to a large number of small cells 
according to procedures and algorithms explained in following 
chapters. However, there is still a problem of license and interference 
issues that should be addressed. Therefore, 5G attempts to use LTE, 
which should be suitable for unlicensed spectrum bands where higher 
frequency bands should be used (up to 10 GHz).  As per dense 
deployment, high frequency bands will be used to create spectrum 
flexibility by dividing and sharing them among operators in order to 
optimize the use of the spectrum according to the scenario detected 
through studying the radio map of the area of deployment.  
5.2.2. Ubiquitous communication support 
One of the most important issues to be covered in 5G is 
interworking within different types of networks within the same 
technology, for example making LTE radio more adaptable to various 
technologies.  
5.2.3. Improvement in radio characteristics 
Regardless the improvement done in LTE-A, there is still more 
need to improve the capabilities of the radio, especially when we are  
 
 

5G     95 
talking about interworking scenarios for different kinds of networks; 
i.e. macrocell, femtocell, picocell, D2D, MTC, relay, etc. The 
coordination of conference in such context is considered to be very 
hard and new algorithms should be used in 5G to ensure minimum 
interference. Furthermore, the use of 3D beamforming will be 
important since it combines horizontal beam pattern adaptation, as 
applied for beamforming and multiple input multiple output (MIMO) 
schemes, with vertical antenna pattern adaptation. The recent 
availability of flexible antenna techniques enables fully dynamic 
antenna pattern adaptation which can be specified per resource block 
and piece of user equipment (UE), and makes 3D beamforming 
practically feasible. 
 
Figure 5.4. Future vision of 5G 
5.3. 5G frequencies 
One of the most important challenges of 5G is to find available 
frequency bands that allow a large increase in network capacity. One 
solution is to use cognitive radio, but this is complex and more  
 
 
 

96     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
debates are required to determine the full potential of this technology. 
The easiest solution is to find frequencies not yet used. Unfortunately, 
this is almost impossible below 20 GHz so the basic idea is to use very 
high frequencies in the millimetric bands to provide huge bandwidths. 
These bands are not easy to use since they have very strong 
attenuation due to obstacles such as dust or rain. Figure 5.5 shows the 
attenuations depending on the frequency. 
 
Figure 5.5. Attenuation versus frequency 
The new bands for 5G could be 27,500 to 28,350 and 37,000 to 
40,000 and 73,000 to 80,000 MHz. These bands give global capacity 
if we can use them effectively. It is necessary to develop accurate 
beamforming technologies at these frequencies, i.e. get directional 
signals to reach terminals with high accuracy. 
5.4. High and low platforms 
5G should also use high altitude platforms (HAP) and low altitude 
platforms (LAP). The advantage of these platforms comes from a 
fabulous communication that can cover millions of high-speed 
terminals. The challenge is to maintain aerial vehicles overhanging the  
 
 

5G     97 
same geographic location. These flying machines can be of different 
types: aircraft, drone, balloon, etc. 
A HAP must be in a stratospheric position (18–22 km). Its 
coverage is measured in hundreds of square kilometers. The LAP can 
be a few tens of meters to some kilometers away, the coverage being a 
few square kilometers. The costs also differ depending on whether one 
uses inexpensive low-altitude small balloons or a high-altitude 
sophisticated platform. 
As part of the HAP, flying machines are above the flight paths, in 
an environment almost devoid of turbulance. Balloons move in a 
circuit, rising and going down, which keeps the balloon roughly 
stable. A well-known example is Loom from Google, which launched 
quite a few balloons between 18 and 22 km in altitude in southern 
Africa and New Zealand. Google’s goal is to cover large areas of 
territory in countries where there is little ground infrastructure. The 
cover is up to 200 km, at a 5° angle with the ground. Cell partitioning 
can be achieved when using a large number of antennas. This course 
allows us to increase the capacity of the platform. Gateways with 
Earth can be made on frequencies between 5.9 and 7 GHz. Other 
channels, located in frequencies above 20 GHz, can also be used as for 
satellite solutions. 
These HAPs need to generate their own power to run all network 
and radio equipment and to propel the balloon. This can be achieved 
by solar panels, hydrogen fuel cells, etc. Another difficulty for 
communications is the high power required to cross 20 km or more. 
Google’s platforms, which use wireless frequencies, require a small 
receiving antenna, which causes additional costs which could be 
prohibitive in poor areas. 
Low-level platforms are much simpler and much less expensive to 
implement. They may be small balloons or drones flying at an altitude 
of a few meters to several kilometers. WiFi technology is well adapted 
to these altitudes, and does not require special antennas to receive the 
signal. 

98     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
Mesh networks, detailed in Chapter 13, are well suited to 
interconnect platforms at similar altitudes, as well as to interconnect at 
low and HAPs with each other and with geostationary satellites. 
A network of drones brings to a large venue or a large event the 
opportunity to connect to the Internet or offer network access. The 
drones can provide adequate services to mobile events. Drones can 
carry enough powerful servers to store, calculate and network 
equipment. The network of drones forms a flying Cloud that can fulfill 
many different missions ranging from simple access to complex civil 
security or military actions. 
5.5. Cloud-RAN 
C-RAN, or Cloud-RAN or Cloud-Radio Access Network, was 
introduced in 2010 by China Telecom, with the aim of changing 
access and backhaul networks between the core network and terminal 
equipment. This architecture is based on the Cloud: all the control, 
management and service algorithms are handled by central data 
centers. This architectural arrangement could have been reached by 
continuing to use conventional access networks connecting clients to 
eNodeBs but is fairly revolutionary in the centralized version: the 
access network is eliminated and replaced with a very simple solution 
whereby the radio signal is sent directly to the data center.  
The radio signal is transferred to the Cloud as it is, without being 
embedded in a packet. The signal processing takes place in a central 
data center. The original C-RAN scheme is shown in Figure 5.6. The 
terminal equipment is connected to the antenna, which retransmits the 
signal to the central data center. The signal is treated first by a  
virtual machine executing some signal processing. Then, several other 
virtual machines execute software associated with the terminal 
equipment. 

5G     99 
Figure 5.6. The fully-centralized Cloud-RAN architecture 
When received by the antenna, the signal is sent over an optical 
fiber, using a technique known as Radio over Fiber (RoF), to the data 
center. The major advantage of RoF technology is that the same 
antenna can be used to handle very different signals, such as 3G, 4G, 
5G or WiFi. The data center unscrambles the signals and determines 
their characteristics in order to decode them. Some other advantages 
are essential, such as the low attenuation of the signal over the fiber. 
The complexity of the access network is eliminated, and the data 
center handles this complexity with appropriate virtual machines. 
The main disadvantage stems from the use of fiber which is 
necessary for the communication. WiFi access points have to be 
connected with optical fiber. This optical fiber is connected to the data 
center by a BaseBand Unit. 

100     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
C-RAN uses network function virtualization, i.e. functions 
decoupled from network equipment and implemented as software by a 
data center or by a sufficiently powerful server. For a WiFi access 
point, this means that the WiFi NFV functions are deported to the 
central data center. 
While the C-RAN architecture is interesting for countries wishing 
to develop a new infrastructure, it is much less attractive to countries 
which already have a local-loop infrastructure for RAN. In such cases, 
the proposal is to keep the existing structure and add Cloudlets near to 
the antennas to perform computation locally. The computation allows 
local signal processing, equipment signaling and algorithm processing 
to manage handover, attachment, the choice of connection to be 
favored when multiple options are available and network operations. 
This architecture is illustrated in Figure 5.7.

Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks promise to change the 
mobile broadband landscape with peak data rates of over 100 Mbps,  
high-speed mobility, reduced latency and the ability to support a 
variety of real-time applications. However, simply providing LTE 
coverage is not enough to fulfill indoor service requirements. 
Therefore, operators need to complement macrocell networks with 
femtocell deployments more tailored to residential and workplace use.  
To understand the importance of femtocells for LTE, it is 
important to analyze mobile customers’ behaviors and to determine 
the nature of this demand and where it occurs. Traditionally, mobile 
operators’ mission is to deliver services to users constantly on the 
move who use their cell phones mainly for voice services. With the 
emergence of technologies such as LTE, fixed mobile convergence 
(FMC) mobile service usages are changing and new trends are 
appearing leveraging indoor importance. In such a context, high data 
rates and coverage are the two main ingredients that each operator 
should offer to remain competitive. However, operators usually  
fail to provide high quality services to home users and 45% of home 
and 30% of business subscribers experience poor indoor coverage. 
With a macrocellular network, it is very difficult for operators to 
provide high-quality services and cell coverage to indoor users.  
It is nearly impossible for operators to deploy a huge number of

outdoor base stations in densely populated areas to improve indoor 
coverage. These concerns emphasize the need of femtocells as indoor 
solutions. 
The concept of a femtocell is simple. It is a cheap base station to be 
deployed in high volume for residential use, connected to the core 
network via broadband. Femtocells ensure more users receive peak 
data rates most of the time, especially inside buildings where the vast 
majority of mobile broadband data is consumed and where the service 
quality is lower than outside. One of the LTE network bases is 
Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), which is 
a shared channel radio technology. Hence, LTE femtocells offer  
better performance and more bandwidth to users as there are fewer 
users in a cell. Furthermore, LTE femtocells preserve signal 
degradation and increase throughput since the user device has a 
smaller cell radius and is closer to the radio. 
From a business perspective, femtocells save operational 
expenditure (OPEX) on the macro backhaul network as they offload 
traffic from the macrocell network. Capital expenditure (CAPEX) is 
also saved since no new base stations or capacity expansions are 
needed. Femtocells also allow operators to maximize LTE spectrum 
efficiency. New spectrum will be made available for LTE in the high 
frequency bands that do not penetrate buildings effectively but are 
ideal for femtocells. This combined with inexpensive voice services 
will increase revenues. 
Femtocells are also designed to offer innovative services that are 
expected to epitomize LTE. LTE femtocells will provide the best 
possible environment for downloading and streaming media from the 
Internet or between devices in the home without loading the mobile 
network at all. When sharing media in the home, femtocells will not 
even require broadband backhaul and will therefore not be limited by 
throughput restrictions on the network, thereby capitalizing on the full 
peak rates of LTE. Additionally, presence-based applications are  
 
 
 
 

Small Cells     105 
envisaged, enabling femtocells to automatically trigger these 
applications when a consumer is detected entering or leaving the 
home. 
With almost 60% of the worldwide population equipped with cell 
phones, mobile cellular communication is one of the fastest-growing 
technologies ever. Recent studies show that voice revenues are 
declining in favor to data volumes and revenues. This is partly due to 
the convergence between mobile and Internet since the introduction of 
third-generation mobile services.  With fast and reliable access to the 
Internet, data volumes have increased far faster than revenues and this 
trend is expected to accelerate in the future. In order to be competitive, 
operators need to find ways to substantially decrease the cost per bit of 
delivering these data, while not placing limits on customers’ appetites 
for consuming the data. Besides voice revenues diminishing, a new 
trend has appeared regarding wireless usage. Roughly 66% of calls 
initiated from cellular handsets and 90% of data services occur 
indoors. Voice networks are engineered to tolerate low signal quality, 
since the required data rate for voice signals is very low (10 kbps or 
less) whereas data networks require much higher signal quality in 
order to provide the higher (in multi-Mbps) data rates. Hence, 
operators need to improve indoor coverage without additional 
macrocell deployment. Femtocells are a promising solution with 
limited cost satisfying both the subscriber, who is happy with the 
higher data rates and reliability, and operators, who increase revenues 
with no additional deployment of macrocell networks.  
6.1. Femtocell technology 
A femtocell also called Femto Access Point (FAP) or Home 
enhanced NodeB as designated by the 3rd Generation Partnership 
Project for E-UTRAN is not a new concept. It was first investigated in 
1999 by Bell Labs. The original idea was to provide a direct 
equivalent to the WiFi access point but for mobile cellular networks. 
The idea had been more widely recognized by 2007 when a number of  
 
 
 

106     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
major companies demonstrated the system at the Mobile World 
Congress in Barcelona. To promote worldwide femtocell deployment, 
the Femto Forum was founded in the same year. It comprises more 
than 100 telecom hardware and software vendors, mobile operators, 
content providers and start-ups. 
From a technical view, a femtocell is a low-power wireless access 
point, installed by customers themselves in a plug and play way for 
better indoor voice and data reception. Femtocell operates in the 
licensed spectrum and is connected to a mobile operator’s network 
using residential DSL or cable broadband connections, as shown in 
Figure 6.1. Femtocells enables fixed mobile convergence (FMC) 
service by connecting to the cellular network via broadband 
communications. Femtocells radiates very low power (<10 mW) and 
can typically support 2–8 simultaneous mobile users.  
 
Figure 6.1. Basic femtocell network 
A femtocell network consists of various supporting network 
elements: a FAP that provides dedicated coverage to authorized users 
over the licensed spectrum, and a femtocell access point gateway 
(FAP-GW) used as a concentrator for all traffic received from the  
 
 
 

Small Cells     107 
FAP and the auto configuration server (ACS) used to provide  
operation administration maintenance and provisioning (OAMP) 
management functions. The combination of these elements provides 
communication, security, network provisioning, network management 
and integration. 
The femtocell concept can be applied to different radio access 
technologies. Although the focus is on LTE, the arguments apply 
equally to existing or emerging wireless broadband technologies such 
as 3G and WiMAX: 
1) Femtocell benefits: femtocells promote a win–win approach 
where both users and operators could benefit and has attracted strong 
interest within telecommunication industry. 
2) User benefits: from the user perspective, femtocells address a 
number of problems inherent in cellular technology. One of the main 
advantages is increased indoor coverage with a radius of 50–200 m. In 
small office/home office environments, femtocells will provide plenty 
of coverage and resolve the lack of coverage inside buildings. 
Femtocells improve user quality of experience with a higher data rate 
which results in better in-building voice and multimedia services. 
Battery life is also improved because of the low power radiation. In 
addition, with low deployment cost, femtocells will provide 
inexpensive voice tariffs. Indeed, using a femtocell to deliver mobile 
services is much cheaper for the operator, opening up the possibility 
of charging less for service at home. 
3) Operator benefits: from the operator perspective, femtocells will 
enable operators to deal with the increase in mobile usage indoors. 
Femtocells constitutes increase network capacity by offloading traffic 
from macrocells. Due to femtocells, the traffic is backhauled to the 
core network over the existing broadband link without any cost to the 
operator. The introduction of femtocells has the advantage of 
increasing average revenue per user and reducing the capital spent per 
user on new macrocell equipment at the same time. Femtocells enable  
 
 

108     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
emerging data-intensive applications that are a challenge to access 
from the home via today’s cellular networks. 
6.2. LTE femtocell architecture 
One of the important changes for the evolution in the radio access 
network (Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network  
E-UTRAN) for LTE is the flat architecture where more functions are 
added to the base stations, i.e. eNodeB. Currently, the standardization 
work of femtocells is in progress under 3GPP. Aside from 3GPP, 
some alliances like the Femto Forum and the Next Generation Mobile 
Network are rigorously discussing efficient development and 
deployment opportunities related to LTE femtocells. Figure 6.2 shows 
the LTE femtocell architecture proposed by 3GPP. The elements of 
this architecture are listed below. 
 
Figure 6.2. LTE femtocell logical architecture 
6.2.1. Home eNB or FAP 
Home eNB or HeNB refers to the generic term femtocell in E-
UTRAN. HeNB is a plug-and-play consumer device that should be 
easily installed by the users in home and office environments. The 
HeNB uses the subscriber’s broadband backhaul to connect to the  
operator’s core network. No X2 interface exists between neighboring 
HeNBs. 

Small Cells     109 
Similar to the eNB, the HeNB interconnects with the LTE EPC via 
the S1 interface. More specifically, the HeNB is connected to the 
mobility management entity (MME) via S1-MME that provides the 
control functions for idle mode UE reachability and active mode UE 
handover support. The HeNB is connected to the serving gateway  
(S-GW) via the S1-UE interface. 
6.2.2. HeNB gateway or FAP-GW 
The HeNB gateway is connected to the HeNB by the S1 interface, 
and connected to the MME and the S-GW using the same S1 
interface. HeNB gateway plays the role of a concentrator and a 
distributor. The HeNB gateway serves as a concentrator for the 
control plane, specifically the S1–MME interface at transport network 
layer. It transports many S1 Application Protocol (S1AP) connections 
generated by a large number of HeNBs in single Stream Control 
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) association between HeNB gateway 
and the MME. SCTP is the protocol used for signaling transport. As a 
distributor, HeNB gateway distributes messages and traffic to 
different HeNBs with its range. 
The LTE femtocell architecture may deploy a HeNB gateway to 
allow the S1 interface between the HeNB and the EPC to scale to 
support a large number of HeNBs. The S1-UE interface from the 
HeNB may be terminated at the HeNB gateway, or a direct logical  
U-Plane connection between HeNB and S-GW may be used. 
6.2.3. HeNB management system or ACS 
The functionality of the HeNB Management System (HMS) is 
based on the TR-069 family of standards. It empowers operators to 
control and manage the configuration of HeNBs. Furthermore, it 
produces fault reports and collects different variations in performance 
from the HeNBs. With the HMS, an operator grants access to HeNBs 
with additional services and applies service usage policies. 

110     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
6.2.4. Security gateway  
In a LTE femtocell, a SeGW is used to provide a secure 
communication link between the HeNB and the EPC. The SeGW 
provides protection against potential security threats and network 
attacks that may occur when mobile traffic is exposed to the public 
access network. SeGW is a logical entity that comes, in some cases, as 
an integrated solution within a HeNB gateway, while in other cases it 
is a separate network entity. 
6.3. LTE femtocell deployment scenarios 
3GPP, in Release 9 specifications, has proposed three different 
architecture scenarios for future LTE femtocells. 
SCENARIO 6.1.– 
Figure 6.3 depicts the first possible architecture according to the 
3GPP design. In this architecture, the HeNB only connects to a single 
HeNB gateway. The HeNB gateway is considered an operator device 
and is placed in the operator’s network. The presence of HeNB 
gateway enables wide-scale HeNB deployment. This architecture is 
attractive for vendors, because of its pretty straightforward 
deployment scenario.  
Figure 6.3. LTE femtocell deployment  
scenario 1: with a dedicated HeNB gateway 

Small Cells     111 
SCENARIO 6.2.– 
Figure 6.4 illustrates another variation of the femtocell architecture 
without physical existence of the HeNB gateway. In this architecture, 
the HeNB gateway functionalities are integrated in HeNB and MME. 
This architecture follows the principle that in order to increase 
system performance and efficiency, functional operations of different 
network devices are integrated in one device in such a manner that the 
newly developed network entity can perform better under certain 
conditions with other network entities. This architecture also enables 
the HeNB to be self-configurable. However, distributing the HeNB 
gateway functionalities in the HeNB and CN might cause performance 
degradation in HeNBs. 
 
Figure 6.4. LTE femtocell deployment scenario 2: without a HeNB gateway 
SCENARIO 6.3.– 
In this architecture variation, the HeNB gateway is only used to 
aggregate control plane signaling and the HeNB is directly connected 
to the S-GW using a direct logical U-Plane connection, as illustrated 
in Figure 6.5. In this way, the HeNB gateway is used for transporting 
control plane signaling, efficiency of data packet delivery to the S-
GW will increase and this will increase the overall data packet 
transport efficiency in the whole network.

6.4. Femtocell access control strategy 
Access control is one of the key ways of supporting various 
features of the femtocell, including mobility support, interference 
management and so on. The ability of UE to distinguish between 
macrocell and femtocell is of a great importance as it limits their 
battery consumption. 
6.4.1. Closed subscriber group 
3GPP, in Release 8, introduces the concept of the closed subscriber 
group (CSG) which consists of identifying a group of subscribers who 
are permitted to access one or more Public Land Mobile Network 
(PLMN) cells. This restriction is imperative for femtocells for several 
reasons; femtocells usually support a small number of user devices as 
more devices will provide inadequate service. Furthermore, the 
femtocell owner would not agree to share its backhaul link with other 
users. 
The CSG concept enables permitted UE to use the femtocell by 
defining a CSG identity that is unique in the PLMN. The CSG identity 
is broadcasted by all femtocells that support authorized UE access. 

Small Cells     113 
Each piece of UE should be able to store a list of allowed CSG 
identities.  
6.4.2. Femtocell access control modes 
Femtocells can be used in three different usage models: 
– Open access mode: In the open access method, all UE is treated 
equally from a camping and charging perspective. A provider deploys 
a femtocell to provide coverage in an area where there is a coverage 
hole. In this instance, it would be beneficial to allow public access to 
the femtocell; this is a hotspot scenario like that in a coffee shop or 
airport. In this model, the femtocells become another part of the 
PLMN. The disadvantage of this method is that it may increase the 
number of handovers and signaling and it may also face some security 
issues.  
– Closed access mode: in closed access mode, only CSG 
subscribers are allowed to connect to a privately accessible femtocell. 
UE that is not part of the CSG would not get access to the femtocell 
except for emergency calls. A closed access mode is also referred to as 
a CSG cell in 3GPP terminology.  
– Hybrid access mode: the hybrid access approach, also known as a 
hybrid cell in 3GPP terminology, is similar to the closed access mode. 
It allows UE not part of the CSG to connect to the femtocells, but only 
a certain portion of the resources with preferential charging and access 
for the subscribers. UE not part of the CSG may be pre-empted or 
rejected in favor of subscribers. 
6.4.3. Physical cell identity 
In 3GPP, each LTE cell broadcasts a specific physical cell identity 
(PCI) that is normally used to identify a cell for radio purposes; for 
example, camping/handover procedures are simplified by explicitly 
providing the list of PCIs that UE has to monitor. This list is usually 
known as the neighboring cell list. The PCI of a cell does not need to 
be unique across the entire network; however, it must be unique on a  

114     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
local scale to avoid confusion with neighboring cells. In the 3GPP 
radio access technologies, a range that includes PCIs for exclusive use 
by femtocells can be signaled. This represents a challenge in femtocell 
networks, since they must select their PCIs dynamically after booting 
or changing their position in order to avoid collision with other 
macro/femtocells. Furthermore, in extensive femtocell deployments 
and due to the limited number of PCIs, 504 in LTE, the reuse of PCIs 
among femtocells in a given area may be unavoidable, thus causing 
PCI confusion. A subset of the PCIs can be reserved for specific 
purpose, such as identification of the femtocells. For instance, a PCI 
can be used to identify a CSG cell without reading the system 
information by attributing a specific range of PCIs to the CSG cells. 
These sets of PCIs will be exclusively used by CSG cells and UE not 
interested in accessing the CSG and can avoid camping on them while 
preserving battery life. However, if a fixed number of PCIs are 
reserved for a specific use, PCI confusion be severe when the large 
number of femtocells is deployed. A dynamic PCI reservation scheme 
could be a good solution to this issue. 
6.5. LTE femtocell challenges and technical issues 
The femtocell solutions are overwhelmingly attractive to mobile 
network operators as they successfully address coverage and mobile 
data 
bandwidth 
requirements 
by 
leveraging 
widely-available 
broadband connections without the extraordinary cost associated with 
the alternative macrocell deployment. Even though usage of 
femtocells provides many benefits, it poses serious challenges to LTE 
femtocell deployment due to several technical issues. 
6.5.1. Interference 
A major challenge with femtocell technology is the interference 
that can be caused by a large deployment of HeNBs associated with 
the existing macrocell. Femtocell deployment can cause severe  
 
 
 

Small Cells     115 
degradation of the neighboring cells if not managed properly.  
Since femtocells and macrocells are located in two different layers,  
the resulting network is known as a two-tier network. In  
two-tier networks, we distinguish two types of interferences: cross- 
and co-tier interferences. Cross-tier interference is caused by an 
element of the femtocell tier to the macrocell tier and vice versa. Co-
tier interference takes place between elements of the same tier, such as 
neighboring femtocells.  
Some techniques have been proposed to overcome interference in 
femtocells. We can distinguish hardware-based approaches, such as 
cancelation techniques, or the use of sectorial antennas. However, 
these techniques usually imply an increase in HeNB cost which is 
contrary to the essence of femtocells.  
Efficient alternatives are represented by strategies based on 
interference avoidance and subchannel management. These techniques 
are often used to mitigate interference in cellular networks and are of 
great importance in femtocells due to cross-tier interference.  
6.5.2. Spectrum allocation 
From the point of view of OFDMA spectral resource allocation, 
different approaches exist to manage subchannel allocation. One way 
to completely eliminate cross-layer interference is to divide the 
licensed spectrum into two parts; this is called orthogonal channel 
assignment. This way, a fraction of the subchannels would be used by 
the macrocell layer, while another fraction would be used by the 
femtocells. In orthogonal channel assignment, the spectrum allocation 
can be static, depending on the geographic area, or can be dynamic 
depending on traffic demand and user mobility. Although optimal 
from a cross-layer interference standpoint, this approach is inefficient 
in terms of spectrum reuse and implies that UE should support 
different frequencies.  
Another subchannel assignment consists of sharing the spectrum 
across the femtocell and macrocell layers; this is called co-channel  
 

116     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
assignment and is more efficient and profitable for operators due to 
the high cost of the licensed spectrum. It enables high-frequency 
efficiency and easy handover between eNodeB and HeNB. However, 
transmissions within femtocells may cause macrocell cross-
interference and vice versa. Resource allocation under co-channel 
deployment is thus of critical importance. The key to the success of 
such a strategy assignment is to protect macrocell user services against 
femtocell interference while exploiting spatial channel reuse. 
Two strategies can be employed to mitigate cross- and co-tier 
interference. In a centralized strategy, there would be a central entity 
that is in charge of intelligently assigning each cell subchannel. This 
entity would collect information from the femtocells and their user 
and use it to find an optimal solution within a short period. However, 
with salient features of femtocells such as user installation and 
unplanned deployment, this solution is inappropriate due to hard 
technical barriers. 
A distributed and self-organizing strategy is also being investigated 
to mitigate cross- and co-tier interference, where each cell manages its 
own subchannels in a cooperative or non-cooperation manner. In a 
non-cooperative approach, each femtocell would plan its subchannel 
in order to maximize the throughput and QoS for its users 
independently from the effects its allocation might have on 
neighboring cells. Access to the subchannels then becomes 
opportunistic, and the method decays to greedy. In a cooperative 
approach, each HeNB gathers information about neighboring 
femtocells and may perform its allocation taking into account the 
effect it would have on neighbors. In this way, the average femtocell 
throughput and QoS, as well as their global performance, can be 
locally optimized.This approach would be very beneficial, both in 
terms of resource management and interference reduction. But, it has 
the disadvantage of requiring additional overhead or sensing 
mechanisms to gather information about neighboring femtocells and 
macrocells. 

Small Cells     117 
6.5.3. Access mode impact 
Another factor that plays a key role in the severity of interference 
is the access strategy within femtocells. In a closed access scenario, 
non-subscribers can experience severe jamming from the nearby 
femtocells. Non-subscribers are not allowed to use the femtocell even 
if the femtocell pilot power is higher than that of the nearest 
macrocell. Nonsubscribers can also jam the HeNB uplink if they are 
transmitting with high power. In an open access deployment, non-
subscribers can also connect to femtocells, which considerably reduce 
cross-tier interference. However, since all users can use femtocells, 
the volume of signaling messages increases due to the high number of 
handovers. Open access can thus create outages. 
6.6. Security and privacy challenges 
Like all communications technologies, femtocells require robust 
security. The threat model for a femtocell-enabled mobile network, as 
illustrated in Figure 6.6, consists mainly of attacks on the 
communication links between UE, HeNB and carrier’s core network 
and attacks on the integrity of the HeNB, which is considered a 
vulnerable point in a femtocell network. 
 
Figure 6.6. Threat model for femtocell networks 
 

118     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
1) Attacks on communication links: attacks on telecommunication 
links or third-party attacks on networks intend to compromise the 
security between UE and HeNB and/or the HeNB and the SeGW for 
the purpose to of eavesdropping, service disruption, fraud and other 
malicious activity. This kind of attack includes man-in-the-middle, 
traffic snooping and tracking attack. 
The communication links in a femtocell network can be divided 
into: 
– the link between the UE and the HeNB through the air interface; 
– the public link between the HeNB and the SeGW. 
Attacks on the air interface can be either passive or active. In 
passive attacks, the attacker passively listens to communication 
whereas in active ones, the attacker injects or modifies the data in 
addition to listening. Attacks on the air interface are being tackled by 
cryptographically protecting the messages sent over the air. 
The issue of user identity protection is raised in migration toward 
all-IP and femtocell networks where the legacy solutions (TMSIs and 
GUTIs) might not be suitable. With the massive deployment of 
femtocells, the use of unlikable temporary identifiers to protect the 
identity of mobile devices at the air interface is insufficient to 
guarantee a satisfactory level of protection since they are usually 
unchanged in a location area composed of up to 100 adjacent cells. 
Femtocell thus enables tracking with unprecedented accuracy due to 
the low range. 
Since HeNB and HeNB gateway use broadband IP for the backhaul 
of cellular communications, Internet-based attacks are feasible against 
mobile operators. HeNB and the network must be able to mutually 
authenticate each other so that the HeNB becomes part of the carrier’s 
network. To enable this process to occur, HeNB, HeNB gateway  
and SeGW that sit between the public Internet and the mobile  
 
 
 

Small Cells     119 
operator’s core network must be able to establish a secure 
communication tunnel.  
Standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), 
IKEv2 has been prescribed for the HeNB and HeNB gateway 
authentication requirements of addresses. It is a flexible protocol that 
supports many actual authentication methods. Authentication within 
IKEv2 can be performed with Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) 
certificates, shared keys or even SIM cards.  
IKEv2 also supports the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), 
which is a key feature in applying the IKEv2 protocol in many 
existing authentication schemes or systems. After successful 
negotiation, identification and authentication of all parties, IKEv2 
generates the keys and establishes connection for further secure 
communication.  
While IKEv2 is used to authenticate the access points and 
gateways for each party, the actual secure communication channel is 
realized with IPSec. This is another IETF standardized protocol for 
securing Internet communications. Support for the IPSec protocol is a 
requirement for protecting the IP backhaul of the femtocell system. 
IPSec protects IP traffic as it travels over the broadband connection 
back to the carrier’s core network. It is a flexible and efficient method 
of providing data integrity and confidentiality. While IPsec is a 
complex suite of many protocols, backhaul security within femtocell 
networks focuses specifically on one variant, the Encapsulating 
Tunnel Payload (ESP) tunnel variant. 
2) Attacks on the integrity of the HeNB: HeNB is a gateway to the 
carrier core IP network and the carrier’s radio network. The most 
common threats to HeNB integrity include hacking, tampering/reverse 
engineering and device cloning. HeNBs are prone to attacks regarding 
the physical size, material quality, lower cost components and the IP 
interface. In addition, the standards for femtocell call for radio 
configuration data, encryption keys, identity material and operational  
 
 
 

120     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
statistics to be stored within the HeNB itself. These data are  
sensitive and must not be available to any party but the carrier. To 
achieve this, the data must be stored in a robustly protected 
“cryptographic safe” within the device. When the HeNB is physically 
vulnerable to tampering by malicious users, attacks such as  
device impersonation, IP attacks on the network services and false 
location reports have severe consequences on quality of service. The 
validity of billing, subscription and device data must be secured. To 
this end, HeNB should be equipped with a trusted execution 
environment.  
6.7. Synchronization 
In 3GPP specifications, base stations use frequencies that are very 
accurate and closely synchronized. Network time synchronization is 
particularly important between macrocells and femtocells in order to 
minimize multi-access interference, as well as for the proper 
performance of handovers. This issue is critical since femtocells are 
deployed by users and there is no centralized management of their 
radio resources. Without timing, transmission instants would vary 
between different cells. This could lead to the uplink period of some 
cells overlapping with the downlink of others, thus increasing intercell 
interference in the network. 
For a low-cost femtocell implementation, synchronization is 
becoming significant. The manufacture of low-cost femtocells 
equipped with high precision oscillators is not trivial, so alternative 
approaches need to be considered in order to achieve reliable time 
synchronization. One solution is the use of the IEEE-1588 Precision 
Timing Protocol shared by standard for an accurate clock 
synchronization protocol between network equipment as a feasible 
method to achieve synchronization. However, some modifications are 
necessary for it to perform efficiently over asymmetric backhaul links 
such as ADSL. 
 

Small Cells     121 
An alternative is the use of GPS receivers, which provide accurate 
timing over satellite links. Since accurate location information is not 
required, only a single satellite is needed. Performance depends on the 
availability of GPS coverage inside user premises.  
A third possibility is that the base station could receive 
transmissions from the overlaying (highly accurate) macrocellular 
network and adjust its timing accordingly (network listening), 
although this adds the overhead of another radio and requires a 
macrocell be within range of the femtocell. 
Finally, there are some innovative, low-cost/high-stability 
Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator (TCXO) products 
coming on the market which might reach the required stability levels 
and make the issue easier. 
6.8. Mobility 
In a LTE macrocell, UE mobility support is classified into two 
states: idle mode and connected mode. In the idle model, cell selection 
and reselection are done for the mobility management of UE. When 
UE is turned on, PLMN is selected. The UE searches for a suitable 
cell within the selected PLMN and chooses the cell to provide 
available services and tunes to its control channel. This choice is 
referred as “camping on the cell”. If the UE finds a more suitable cell, 
according to the cell reselection criteria, it selects onto that cell  
again and camps on; this mechanism is defined as cell reselection. 
When a call is generated, the idle mode is transited to the connected 
mode.  
The LTE utilizes a network-controlled and UE-assisted handover 
procedure for mobility in connected mode. For the handover between 
two eNodeBs, the handover decisions are made by eNodeBs without 
consulting the MME: the source eNodeB decides to move the UE to 
the target eNodeB based on the UE measurement report; the target 
eNodeB prepares radio resources before accepting the handover; after  
 
 

122     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
a successful handover, the target eNodeB indicates the source eNodeB  
to release the resources and sends a path switch message to the MME. 
The MME then sends a User Plane Update Request to the S-GW 
routing information update. The control messages are exchanged via 
the X2 interface between the two eNodeBs. The downlink packet data 
are also forwarded from the source to the target eNodeB via the same 
X2 interface. However, in the femtocell architecture, no X2 interface 
exists between neighboring HeNBs. Moreover, only authorized users 
can access HeNB, while in LTE macrocell handovers are performed 
without restrictions. 
Considering deployment of the HeNB in 3GPP LTE systems, there 
are two types of handover: inbound handover from macrocell to 
HeNB and outbound handover from HeNB to macrocell: 
– Inbound handover for HeNB: this is the frequently facing 
handover scenario for UE and is complex. With the deployment of 
thousands of possible target HeNBs, inbound handover for HeNB is 
the most challenging issue for LTE femtocell networks. If UE belongs 
to a subscriber group (CSG) cell, only UEs belonging to the CSG is 
permitted to access and receive service from the CSG femtocell. The 
authentication is thus checked in preparation for handover, which 
results in more complex handovers than in macrocells. 
– Outbound handover for HeNB: in this scenario, UE is currently 
connected with HeNB and it is important which entity, i.e. eNodeB 
and HeNB, decides the handover from HeNB to the target cell because 
it affects the handover procedure. The outbound handover is less 
challenging than the inbound handover because whenever a user 
moves out of a femtocell network, eNodeB signal strength may be 
stronger than HeNBs. The selection is easier, as there is no complex 
authorization check and interference calculation compared to inbound 
handover. Considering both handover scenarios, the main problems 
are: 
- a method for identifying HeNB is needed regarding the large 
number of potential femtocells that could be deployed in a macrocell,  
 
 

Small Cells     123 
the accessibility of UEs especially where CSG deployment is also of 
great importance. If the UE measures all the HeNBs and reports the 
measurement to the eNodeB, it causes high UE power consumption 
and increases handover delay. The quantity of measurements for a 
non-allowed CSG cell should also be avoided; 
- management of the neighboring cell list that represents the 
group of candidate target cells for handover. In LTE system, the X2 
interface is defined and directly connected with the eNodeBs. Hence, 
managing the neighboring relation is simplified.  
However, HeNBs and eNodeBs are not directly connected and 
HeNB is frequently turned on/off. Therefore, managing the 
neighboring list which consists of both HeNBs and eNodeBs is 
complex. 
Finally, cross-interference between the HeNB and eNodeB is also a 
key issue that affects handover support in both handover scenarios. 
6.9. Passpoint 
Passpoint is an architecture proposed by the WiFi Alliance, which 
was created with the arrival of WiFi to promote this technology. The 
WiFi Alliance has greatly contributed to the success of WiFi and the 
introduction of various standards such as WPA2 which allows us to 
offer a high security in WiFi networks. 
Passpoint is a solution that allows us to replace 3G/4G antennas 
with an offloading solution allowing users to connect in a completely 
transparent way through WiFi networks. In other words, the customer 
does not know how it is connected to the operator’s network: a BTS 
antenna, a NodeB or an E-NodeB or by a wireless access point 
(hotspot, femtocell, picocell, microcell, etc.). 
In home or office environments, connecting to a WiFi network is 
usually automatic once the user has supplied credentials. When  
 
 
 

124     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
connected to the access point and allowed to enter the network, the 
user is subject to the rules established by the IT manager or the owner 
of the access point. Once it is recognized, the terminal is automatically 
associated with the access points to which it connects regularly and 
without user intervention. 
The connection to most hotspots is often different. In a public place 
where there are several networks, customers must often start by 
choosing which network they want to connect to and be recognized by 
the access point. In most cases, the customer enters authentication 
information. There are solutions to simplify network selection and 
automatically make the association while ensuring good security, but 
these are often limited to a small number of networks and are rarely 
available 
abroad. 
WiFi 
Passpoint 
technology 
fundamentally  
changes the use of public hotspot. This is a general solution that  
all hotspot operators can apply that overcomes the limitations  
of proprietary and interoperable solutions offered by existing 
providers. A program in certified equipment automatically manages 
the association’s network, authentication, authorization and security in 
a totally transparent way. This solution works in all Passpoint 
networks. 
First, Passpoint handles the discovery and network selection. The 
terminal automatically discovers and chooses the network on which to 
connect from a list of preferences specified by users, operator policies 
and network availability. These characteristics are based on the IEEE 
802.11u standard. 
Access to the network is done seamlessly, without the user having 
to do anything. It is no longer necessary that the terminal is on a list of 
active access points to which it agrees to connect. There is no need to 
enter account information in a browser. Passpoint uses a consistent 
interface, and the connection process is automatic. Moreover, the 
choice of device can be made automatically for multiple types of 
credentials. Passpoint supports SIM card authentication. These cards 
are widely used in current cellular networks. Passpoint also supports  
 
 

Small Cells     125 
combinations of user-name password and certificates. No user 
intervention is required to connect to a trusted network. 
All Passpoint connections are secured by WPA2-Enterprise for 
authentication and connectivity, providing a level of safety 
comparable to that of cellular networks. Passpoint improves WPA2-
Enterprise by adding features to contain known attacks in on public 
WiFi networks. Passpoint also provides instant open accounts when 
the user does not have a subscription to a telecommunications 
operator. This process is standardized and unified to establish a new 
account at the access point, using the same account opening method 
used by all WiFi Passpoint ISPs. Passpoint creates a global platform 
centered on four protocols based on the standard Extensible 
Authentication Protocol (EAP). This protocol is widely deployed 
today. The EAP-SIM, EAP-AKA and EAP-TLS authentication 
methods allow mobile operators to use the same authentication 
solutions for cellular and WiFi. 
In addition to ease of use through seamless authentication, 
Passpoint brings many benefits to service providers and users: 
– Internet access for electronic devices without a browser. The 
Passpoint authentication method requires no browser, facilitating the 
use of electronic devices such as cameras, embedded devices in cars, 
connected objects and more generally all the “Things” that connect to 
Internet. The Internet of Things is described in more detail in 
Chapter 11. 
– Simple connection and opening of new subscriptions. Whether to 
connect the subscriber to an existing account or to introduce new 
services, automation of authentication and security of the connection 
process make Passpoint an attractive solution for content providers 
and oriented terminal manufacturer content such as digital tablets. 
WiFi users can use prepaid subscriptions according to a model similar 
to that of cell phone operators. 
Service providers increasingly want to protect their premium 
content subscribers. They need to find out who receives such content. 
Passpoint provides the identity of service providers, subscribers access 

126     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
rights and offers premium quality content for subscribers connected at 
home, in a corporate network or via public access points. 
Passpoint hotspots offer service providers seamless roaming in 
other operator networks. To activate the roaming service, operators 
must first establish mutual roaming agreements that cover the 
validation of access and billing. Roaming is based on a single network 
selection protocol and user authentication in the hotspot. Once 
roaming between service providers activated, Passpoint devices can 
connect automatically to the network using the same process. In all 
cases, the customer recognizes the Passpoint access point as belonging 
to the list of available networks and automatically establishes a 
connection, such as for cellular roaming. The new features are enabled 
only if the access point and the client device are compatible with 
Passpoint. The WiFi Alliance Passpoint certification program will 
ensure compatibility. In addition, Passpoint supports connectivity with 
non-Passpoint equipment. 
Customers with the correct credentials and using a suitable EAP 
method can connect to Passpoint access points. Customers who do not 
have proper credentials for EAP methods must use an open system 
based on browser authentication, where WPA2 may not be necessary. 
In such cases, security is not guaranteed. 
Passpoint clients can connect to any existing WiFi network. 
However, they will not be able to use Passpoint features and services. 
For example, standard hotspots offer no connection security, while 
Passpoint automatically establishes WPA2 encryption. 
WiFi Certified Passpoint is a WiFi Alliance certification program 
for both access points and client devices. It ensures, just as for WiFi 
equipment, the interoperability of equipment and terminals. 
6.10. The backhaul network 
Backhaul networks are intermediate networks between access 
networks, to which customers are connected, and the core network.  
These backhaul networks are becoming even more important as small 

Small Cells     127 
cell technology requires a very large number of connections. Backhaul 
networks essentially make connections between the core and digital 
subscriber line access multiplexer networks or between base stations 
and the core network. These networks are generally using Gigabit 
Ethernetor MPLS solutions. 
Mesh networks, where access points are directly connected to each 
other, need two wireless cards, one for communicating with 
neighboring access points, the other to connect customers. A client 
that wants to send packets connects to an access point, which forwards 
the packets to neighboring access points, which in turn transmits to its 
neighbors, and so on until it reaches the core network via an optical 
fiber or an xDSL line. The access points are typically connected by 
WiFi, but other solutions are being developed with longer ranges, as 
we will see in Chapter 8. 
Figure 6.7 shows a typical configuration of a backhaul network. 
The small cells are connected to a “Small Cell Backhaul Aggregation” 
station which recovers the flow rates of different cells and aggregates 
to convey this flow to the core network, either by optical fiber or by 
radio relay. The waves are directed to switches in the Radio Access 
Network (RAN), which are themselves connected to a switch in the 
core network. This last link is often provided by a broadband 
multiprotocol local switching solution. 
Figure 6.7. A backhaul network 
 

128     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The connections between the access points and aggregators, even 
with the first RAN switch, can be made using a radio link at very high 
capacity of several gigabits per second on high frequency bands, such 
as 60 GHz. The major drawback of these frequencies is the need for 
direct view and favorable weather. Indeed, these frequencies located 
below the millimeter are blocked by water droplets and airborne dust. 
Specifically, the connection may be 105 GHz or 70–80 GHz or 57–
64 GHz or between 6 and 56 GHz. The privileged band appears to be 
60 GHz for various reasons: the available bandwidth, flow rates of a 
gigabit per second, low interference (because the links are very 
directional), low latency, small components and antennas and finally 
low production cost. The disadvantage of this band is the distance is 
limited to few kilometers between the two antennas to avoid excessive 
losses. 
6.11. Software radio and cognitive radio 
Cognitive radio is one of the most important revolutions of the late 
20th Century. It uses the radio frequency spectrum well, however 
optimum use cannot be made without a certain number of advances 
that we will explains. 
Software radio, or software defined radio (SDR), is a transmitter or 
radio receiver made using a software solution. One immediately sees 
the implications of such technology since the characteristics of the 
interface can be changed infinitely without any technical problem. The 
user can have the interface he needs at a time t and completely 
different interface at time t + 1. Obviously, some hardware is 
necessary to achieve the calculations for coding, modulating and 
filtering. 
Figure 6.8 shows what we can expect from these technologies in 
the coming years. The objects are arranged according to the flexibility 
and intelligence. 

Small Cells     129 
 
Figure 6.8. Software radio and cognitive radio 
Using these technologies, we should increase the rates by a factor 
over 10 years. 
6.12. Custom cells 
Among the many directions of research and development relating 
to 5G, custom cell is one of the most promising, allowing a high 
capacity while reducing at the maximum the power necessary for 
communication between the user and the station. This solution 
provides an excellent reuse spectrum. The idea seems simple: the cell 
in which the user is located must not interfere with another terminal 
nearby. This solution is illustrated in Figure 6.9. 
When the terminal wants to send a packet, the antenna is capable 
of transmitting directionally from a large number of virtual antennas. 
We could have a general antenna formed from hundreds of virtual 
directional antennas. This antenna recovers, as shown in Figure 6.9, 
the five most powerful waves: direct stream, two streams with one 
rebound and two additional waves with two rebounds. Once this

learning process is completed, the main antenna is able to transmit to 
the terminal in the opposite direction, exactly repeating incoming 
waves and using directional antennas that were used to receive the 
signal. The cell is focused on the client, enabling high-frequency reuse 
and very low transmission power directional antennas. 
Figure 6.9. A cell on demand 
This solution is somewhat complicated when the user terminal is 
moving. The determination of beams coming from antennas is 
performed in real time, which can lead to collisions. 
6.13. Conclusion 
The future belongs to small cells. The reasons for this are many, 
including perhaps the most important one coming from the forecast 
showing a sharp increase in rates. A high capacity could be obtained 
by very good frequency reuse. These small cells can be used 
everywhere, at home, in offices, in the streets, in shopping malls, 
airports, train stations, etc. One of the remaining challenges is to 
interconnect the core network. We will see in other solutions with 
mesh networks Chapter 12.

WPAN and WiGig 
Wireless personal networks connect the equipment we carry on us 
with sufficient capacity to transmit voice, data and video. These are 
small networks, in the order of a few meters. Bluetooth has long been 
used, but is now rivaled by many proposals and products from 
standards set by the IEEE 802.15 Working Group. Currently, 
industrial bodies are pushing a new personal wireless generation 
network called Wireless Gigabit (WiGig) normalized under the name 
IEEE 802.11ad. 
7.1. Wireless Personal Area Network 
The IEEE 802.15 Working Group was set up in March 1999 to 
reflect on wireless networks with a range of 10 m, or Wireless 
Personal Area Network (WPAN), with the aim of connecting different 
mobile devices belonging to the same or multiple users. This type of 
network can connect a laptop, a cell phone, a PDA or any other device 
of this type. Three service groups were defined, A, B and C.  
Group A uses the unlicensed spectrum band (2.4 GHz) targeting 
low cost implementation and use. The size of the cell around the point 
of emission is in the order of 1 m. Power consumption must be 
particularly low for the terminal to in last several months without 
electric charging. The selected transmission mode is connectionless.

136     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The network must be able to work in parallel with an IEEE 802.11 
network. In a single physical location, it may therefore be 
simultaneously a network of each type, both of which can possibly 
function in a degraded manner. 
Group B shows the performance increase, with a medium access 
control (MAC) level up to a rate of at least 100 Mbps. The core 
network must be able to interconnect 16 or more machines and 
propose a quality of service, to authorize the operation of some 
applications, such as telephone speech, which requires a very strict 
quality of service. The range between the transmitter and receiver 
reaches 10 m, and the maximum time to connect to the network must 
not exceed 1 second. Finally, this network class must have bridges 
with other categories of 802.15 network. 
Group C introduces important new features for individuals or 
businesses, such as communication security, video transmission and 
the possibility of roaming between wireless networks. To meet these 
objectives, industrial groups were set up, like Bluetooth SIG and 
WiMedia Alliance. The Bluetooth normalization group consists of 
more than 800 companies that have made an open specification for 
wireless connections between personal devices. Bluetooth is based on 
a radio link between two devices, while the WiMedia Alliance is 
interested in high-speed broadband connections over a short range. In 
fact, the standard may be any other standard with the arrival of WiFi 
type networks as part of personal networks. 
7.2. IEEE 802.15 
The IEEE 802.15 Working Group began by splitting into four 
subgroups: 
– IEEE 802.15.1, for class C networks; 
– IEEE 802.15.2 for dealing with interference problems with other 
networks using the 2.4 GHz band; 
 
 

WPAN and WiGig     137 
– IEEE 802.15.3 for class B networks; 
– IEEE 802.15.4 for class A networks. 
It was then greatly enlarged with the arrival of many groups or 
subworking groups, including the following: 
– IEEE 802.15.3c (Task Group 3c), which provides a home 
network in the 57–64 GHz ranges, achieving transmission speeds of 
several gigabits per second; 
– IEEE 802.15.5, which defines mesh networks, which can cover a 
larger geographic area than a personal network; 
– IEEE 802.15.6, which deals with body area network (BAN), a 
network that people can carry with them for medical, experimental, 
sporting reasons, etc. The directions taken by the technical group point 
to lower power consumption and low frequencies with a range of 2–3 
m. High security properties are of course essential in these BAN 
networks. Several proposals are currently under consideration: ultra 
wideband (UWB) specific WiFi, Bluetooth, etc; 
– IEEE 802.15.7, which works in home networking technology 
with a  visible light communication. This network uses equipment 
with LEDs and photodiodes, which can be found in neon lights, red 
traffic lights, light panels, etc. Transmission occurs between 400 and 
800 THz and can provide speeds of several hundreds of megabits per 
second as an available bandwidth. It is possible to have extensions 
longer than a kilometer, for example, but with much lower flow rates 
(a few hundred kilobits per second). 
The IEEE 802.15.1 Group turned to Bluetooth, presented in detail 
in the next section. This became the Bluetooth Special Interest Group 
(Bluetooth SIG). After several years, the IEEE announced in 2005 the 
abandonment of Bluetooth technology in favor of UWB technology. 
The IEEE 802.15.3 Working Group is attempting broadband and 
UWB standardization. This interface was re-covered by the WiMedia 
Alliance and the Bluetooth SIG. After many negotiations, issues and  
 

138     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
technical discussions on patents, the Bluetooth SIG abandoned the 
UWB solution. 
7.3. Bluetooth 
The Bluetooth SIG defines Bluetooth specifications. This group 
was initially formed by Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia and Toshiba, and 
has been joined by more than two 2,500 companies. Bluetooth is a 
low-cost technology, due to its strong integration on a single 9 mm x 
9 mm chip. The frequencies used are between 2,400 and 2,483.5 MHz. 
We find the same frequency range in most wireless networks used in 
private environments, whether personal or business. This band 
requires no license. 
It was long thought that UWB technology could succeed or be 
integrated into Bluetooth: this was the view of the IEEE 802.15.1. 
However, the power consumption of this solution has proved quite 
prohibitive. That is why WiFi is likely to take a prominent place in 
personal broadband networks, either by Bluetooth extensions or 
purely WiFi networks. The succession of Bluetooth SIG standards is 
as follows: 
– Bluetooth 1.0: this had many flaws, including the fact that the 
marketed products could be incompatible; 
– Bluetooth 1.1: first real standard ratified by IEEE 802.15.1 in 
2002; 
– Bluetooth 1.2 brings many improvements, such as greater 
environmental discovery speed and a transmission capacity of 
721 Kbps. This is the standard ratified by the IEEE 802.15.1 Working 
Group in 2005, which we will detail below; 
– Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR: greatly increases the throughput by an 
enhanced data rate solution. The new value of the flow is 3 Mbps, but 
the actual speed, is well below 2 Mbps. This increase is due to a more 
efficient modulation, using both Gaussian Frequency Key Shifting and 
phase shift keying carrying two or three bits per band; 

WPAN and WiGig     139 
– Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR approved in 2007 by the Bluetooth SIG, is 
an interim release improving security and pairing terminals; 
– Bluetooth 3.0 + HS was adopted in 2009. Since the division of 
physical media and transmission technologies is not efficient in 
Bluetooth, the idea is to add a new technique for the transmission 
other than the classical Bluetooth solution. Bluetooth low energy 
technology is used when the network is idle, and WiFi technology at 
the time of transmission; 
– Bluetooth 4.0: the 2010 standard intends to have as low a 
consumption as possible and to collate the different Bluetooth 
solutions. Nokia, which had researched low consumption Bluetooth, 
proposed a new product, called Wibree. Rather than standardize this 
new product, Nokia joined forces in 2007 to incorporate the Bluetooth 
SIG advanced Wibree into Bluetooth. The provisional name of the 
new generation, Bluetooth Ultra Low Power, was abandoned in April 
2010 to become Bluetooth Low Energy. Bluetooth 4.0 brings together 
in one standard basic Bluetooth 2.1, Bluetooth 3.0 + HS, with WiFi 
for transmission and Bluetooth Low Energy. 
Several connection diagrams have been defined by the standard 
setters. The first corresponds to a single network, called piconet, 
which can support up to eight terminals, with a master and eight 
slaves. The master terminal handles communications with the 
different slaves. Communication between two slave terminals 
necessarily passes through the master terminal. In one piconet, all 
terminals use the same hopping sequence. 
Another communication scheme  interconnects  piconets  to  form  a  
scatternet. As communications are always as master–slave, the master 
of a piconet can be a slave to the master of another piconet. For its 
part, a slave can be the slave of several masters. A slave can 
temporarily detach a master to cling to another piconet and then back 
to the first master, once its communication with the second is 
completed. 
 

140     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
Figure 7.1 shows the Bluetooth terminal connections in which a 
master of a piconet is a slave of another piconet master and a slave is a 
slave to two masters. Overall, three piconets are interconnected by a 
master to form a scatternet. 
 
Figure 7.1. Bluetooth terminal connection diagram 
Communication within a piconet can reach close to 1 Mbps. As 
there may be up to eight terminals, actual speed rapidly decreases 
depending on the number of terminals connected in a single picocell. 
A master may, however, increase its communication speed by 
working with two slaves using different frequencies. 
A Bluetooth connection between two machines can reach a rate of 
433.9 Kbps bidirectional communication (full duplex). The flow rates 
are equal to 723.2 Kbps in one direction and 57.6 Kbps in the other 
with unbalanced communication. Communications may be of two 
types: asynchronous or synchronous. Synchronous communication, or 
synchronous connection-oriented (SCO) link allows a synchronous 
data rate of 64 Kbps. This type of connection allows the passage of 
telephone 
speech 
with 
a 
service 
guarantee. 
asynchronous 
communication, or asynchronous connection-less link allows 
asynchronous traffic with more or less protection. The flow rate can 
reach 723.2 Kbps. 

WPAN and WiGig     141 
Several categories of communications can be defined over a 
Bluetooth connection: a single asynchronous communication, three 
simultaneous communications SCO or SCO with a symmetrical LCD 
433.9 Kbps. This gives a total of the link throughput of almost 1 Mbps 
in the latter case. A slave device can only support a maximum of two 
SCO channels from two separate terminals. More specifically, time is 
sliced, into slots, at a rate of 1,600 slots per second. A slot is therefore 
625 µs long, as shown in Figure 7.2. A terminal uses a frequency on a 
slot and then by frequency hopping (frequency hop) it changes 
frequency to the next slot and so on. 
 
Figure 7.2. Cutting slots 
A Bluetooth client cyclically uses all the frequency bands. 
Customers within the same piconet have the same sequence of 
frequency hopping, and when a new terminal wants to connect, it must 
begin by recognizing all frequency hopping in order to respect it. 
Communication is exercised through a series of packets. A packet 
stands on a slot. A series of packets may extend, over three or five 
slots (see Figure 7.3). Frequency hopping takes place at the end of the 
communication of a packet. 
As indicated above, Bluetooth allows the production of small 
personal networks of a few square meters, the piconets. The terminals 
are connected by means of a master. Transmission powers up to 
100 mW (milliwatt), which allows a program to cover several tens of 
meters. It is possible to reduce this power to 2.5 mW and even 1 mW 
to reach a range of a few meters.

At an output of 100 mW, a battery can hold out long enough, using 
the power-saving options. For this reason, low power states were 
introduced in the Bluetooth standard, which allows an autonomy of 
several days. 
7.4. UWB 
The MultiBand OFDM Alliance (MBOA) standardization group 
has defined the basic elements in an ecosystem that would offer 
consumers a wide range of products for the management and control 
of home networks. The UWB radio layer and convergence platform 
together form the basic transport mechanism for different applications, 
including IEEE 1394 (FireWire), and the framework from the Digital 
Living Network Alliance consortium. 
MBOA, established in 2003 and formalized in (SIG) in 2004, was 
established to promote the production of a global standard for wireless 
UWB solutions. Its 200 members included semiconductor companies, 
scientific computing, consumer electronics and mobile devices. The 
characteristics of the physical layer and media access controller are 
finalized and available to MBOA member companies. MBOA is part 
of another more important alliance, the WiMedia Alliance. 
Unfortunately, the UWB technology for power consumption

reasons did not achieve the expected success. Several network 
standards, like Bluetooth, abandoned the idea of taking UWB as their 
physical level. After many discussions, the WiMedia Alliance was 
dissolved in 2009, pushing the Wireless USB Promoter Group (often 
referred to as Wireless USB and even WUSB) to promote the basic 
product of the WiMedia Alliance. 
The WiMedia Alliance is an industrial group that has contributed 
significantly to the development of the UWB concept, particularly in 
the form of software-level protocol layers. This alliance aims to 
promote the connectivity and interoperability of UWB products. The 
common platform illustrated in Figure 7.4 enables the multiple 
applications to work together on a common radio interface. 
 
Figure 7.4. Platform WiMedia Alliance 
The combination of the proposed radio interface using the 
multiband OFDM and architecture of the WiMedia platform allows 
convergence for the implementation of wireless versions of UWB: 
WUSB, 1394, and WiNet DLNA.

Commission (FCC), any radio technology spanning part of the

500 MHz. Identifying the benefits of new products that could 
incorporate this technology to benefit public safety applications, 
corporate and limited energy consumption, in 2002 the FCC allocated 
a part of the usable radio unlicensed spectrum ranging from 3.1 to 
10.6 GHz. An additional part of the spectrum is available for medical, 
scientific and fire rescue. 
Rather than requiring a UWB interface using all the available 
bandwidth, the FCC has set a minimum bandwidth of 500 MHz to 
10 dB. This minimum bandwidth and other requirements imposed by 
the FCC protect the transmission of signals from other users of this 
part of the spectrum. While transmitting under the noise cannot 
disturb other band users, however, these other users could disrupt 
UWB. For example, a UWB connection at an airport would be 
disrupted by radars and other equipment using the UWB band. It has 
been shown by numerous experiments that 500 MHz was always 
available, even in the most disturbed environments. However, the 
flexibility allowed by the FCC standard dramatically increases the 
available options for the design of UWB communication systems. 
Designers are free to use a combination of spectrum subbands to 
optimize the operation of the system, the necessary power and design 
complexity. 
The power allowed is lower in Europe. UWB systems can maintain 
the same level of power as if they were using all the bandwidth, by 
inserting symbols in the different subbands. In a multiband system, 
information can be  transmitted  by  a  method  based  on  traditional  pulse-
based carrier or more advanced multicarrier techniques. 
Systems based on the pulses on the basis of carrier transmit signals 
by modulating the pulse phase. This solution comes from proven 
technology, which relies on a simple design of the transmitter but is 
not, however, without drawbacks. It is difficult to gather enough 
energy to transmit the signal in a typical use environment, with lots of 
reflective surfaces, using only a simple RF chain. The limitations of 
switching times can be very strict, to the transmitter as the receiver. 
 

WPAN and WiGig     145 
The Multiband OFDM (MB-OFDM) simultaneously transmits 
multiple carriers spaced at precise frequencies. The use of fast Fourier 
transform algorithms guarantees high-energy efficiency in the case of 
multipath, while only slightly increasing the complexity of the 
transmitter. The benefits of this solution include MB-OFDM 
flexibility, high spectral elasticity and a high resistance to radio 
interference and effects from multipath. 
OFDM modulation techniques have been successfully applied to 
many communication systems marketed as high performance, 
including WiFi IEEE 802.11a/g, 802.16a WiMAX, ADSL and 
HomePlug standards. Based on CMOS technology, the 3.1–4.8 GHz 
spectrum is considered optimal for initial deployments. The upper 
limit is to prevent interference with the unlicensed national 
information infrastructure band, is located the 802.11a radio interface, 
and simplify the design of radio and analog circuits. The 3.1–4.8 GHz 
frequency band is sufficient for three 500 MHz subbands, as shown in 
Figure 7.5. 
 
Figure 7.5. Allocation of frequencies for MB-OFDM  
The IEEE 802.15.3 Working Group developed two solutions, one 
on the 2.4 GHz band, which will reach a speed of 54 Mbps, and a 
second using the entire bandwidth between 3.1 and 10.7 GHz, but at 
very low power, below the ambient noise. Thus, this solution does not 
interfere with civilian and military applications using these bands. The 
spectrum covered by this technology is shown in Figure 7.6.

Figure 7.6. Part of the spectrum can be used by the UWB 
Despite the very low power used, the bandwidth of over 7 GHz 
provides a speed between 120 and 480 Mbps depending on external 
perturbations. One of the properties of UWB is it can support 
communications with equipment moving at relatively slow speed. The 
goal is to connect and disconnect the equipment in extremely short 
times, in the order in the second. 
The MB-OFDM system has been specifically designed to be as 
simple as possible. One analog receiver chain restricts the symbols 
transmitted in a quadrature phase shift keying modulation. The 
relatively large spacing between the carriers makes it possible to 
reduce noise on the circuit and to improve the robustness to 
synchronization errors. Battery life is a critical factor for users. MB-
OFDM Access is able to last several hours under typical conditions 
before recharging is required. 
UWB technology is designed to ship the elements necessary 
assured to security at all times. Privacy mechanisms are

implemented at several protocol levels to ensure the robustness 
needed for wireless environments while remaining transparent to 
users. The experience gained with the growth of WiFi networks and 
Bluetooth has guided the choices made for security architecture. Most 
solutions implemented are identical to those promoted by the IEEE 
802.11i standard that we will detail in the next chapter. 
Communication security is provided by authentication and 
encryption. Authentication uses the Extensible Authentication 
Protocol–Transport Layer Security. The use of the advanced 
encryption standard with 128 bit key must guarantee the safe transport 
of information. 
7.5. WiGig 
The Wireless Gigabit Alliance was formed in 2009 to create  
a wireless network in the 60 GHz band capable of exceeding speeds  
of one gigabit per second. WiGig, known as 802.11ad, is known  
as “microwave WiFi”. Given the choice of the frequency band,  
this network cannot be a personal network since the highest  
frequency used does not allow the signal to traverse obstacles. The 
final WiGig specification was announced in December 2009. In  
May 2010, WiGig released its version 1.0 specifications, opened  
its adopter program and entered a cooperation agreement with the 
WiFi Alliance to develop free WiFi technologies. In June 2011, 
WiGig announced the launch of its certification for version 1.1 
specifications. 
The Wireless Gigabit Alliance may in the longer term provide 
specifications in classic wireless frequencies with a transfer capacity 
of more than 1 Gbps in the 2.4 GHz band. The maximum WiGig 
capacity is 7 Gbps, but the actual flow rate depends on the 
environment, i.e. mainly on the removal of the access point and 
interference.

The

Working 
Group 
performs 
802.11ad 
WiGig 
standardization work in the 60 GHz band, which has sufficient free 
tapes to reach the rate of 7 Gbpspic rate capacity. This working group 
fits into a module WiFi 802.11g or n WiFi, and a new generation of 
the 60 GHz band. The idea is to look for devices that need to 
communicate using the WiFi standard and hand over to the high- 
frequency part to get the advertised speeds. 
The WiGig standard allows devices to communicate wirelessly at 
speeds that are measured in multi-gigabits. WiGig devices become 
compatible with other WiFi solutions by adopting a tri-band 
technology, which works in the 2.4, 5 and 60 GHz bands. It offers 
data transfer rates up to 7 Gbps, roughly as much as transmission with 
eight 802.11ac antennas, and nearly five times more than the highest 
WiFi 802.11n rate while maintaining compatibility with existing WiFi 
devices. However, the 7 Gbps rate uses the 60 GHz band, which does 
not pass through walls; it is a line-of-sight technology. This solution is 
primarily intended for indoor areas, because the frequencies are 
strongly dampened by water droplets or dust outside the buildings. 
However, outdoor communications use the 60 GHz over distances of a 
kilometer in direct view. While roaming, tri-band WiGig uses classic 
bands but can better propagate through walls. If necessary, the tri-
band shifts into high gear if direct view is possible. 
WiGig has the following characteristics: 
– it supports data rates up to 7 Gbps; 
– it complements the 802.11 MAC layer, while remaining 
compatible with various IEEE 802.11 standards; 
– it has a specific physical layer ensuring interoperability with 
WiGig equipment allowing them to reach speeds of several gigabits 
per second; 
– it adaptation layers that support specific system interfaces, such 
as data buses for PC peripherals and display interfaces for high-
definition television screens and projectors; 

WPAN and WiGig     149 
– direction through the physical layer of beams allowing 
communication at distances of at least 10 m. The beam can  
move within the coverage area through a transmission phase change; 
– standard WiGig offering the same kind of security as WiFi 
networks. 
The WiFi Alliance and WiGig Alliance created an agreement for 
wireless multi-gigabit networks. This cooperation has helped to 
produce specifications for the development of a WiFi product 
certification program in the 60 GHz frequency band. 
The WiGig Alliance and the Video Electronics Standards 
Association (VESA) agreed to develop a new generation of wireless 
display. VESA and the WiGig Alliance share the WiGig technology 
specifications to develop functions such as multi-gigabit wireless 
DisplayPort without creating a certification program for wireless 
DisplayPort products. 
The WiGig Alliance has agreements for using the high definition 
multimedia interface (HDMI). The agreement provides for mapping 
displays for many applications such as wireless transmission of video, 
whether compressed or not.

The basic idea of the wireless HD group was to develop an air 
interface for HDMI. The product developed reaches 25 Gbps. The 
consortium currently has more than 50 members. The WirelessHD 
specification is based on a channel 7 GHz wide in the 60 GHz 
frequency band. This product enables digital transmission with or 
without compression of audio signals and high-definition HDMI-type 
Wireless video. The first generation reached the 4 Gbps throughput, 
but the core technology allows theoretical speeds of up to 25 Gbps 
(against 10.2 Gbps for HDMI 1.3 and 21.6 Gbps DisplayPort 1.2). 
Version 1.1 of the specification further increases the maximum 
throughput to 28 Gbps. This version is compatible with common 3D 
formats, 4K resolution, WPAN networks and HDCP 2.0 content 
protection. 

WPAN and WiGig     151 
The 60 GHz band requires a direct line of site between the 
transmitter and the receiver. However, the WirelessHD specification 
restricts this limitation by using beams at the receiver and transmitter 
to increase the effective radiated power of the signal and find the  
best path using wall reflections. The first product is to be used inside a 
part in point-to-item without being in direct line of sight, or  
non-line-of-sight at distances of up to 10 meters. 
WirelessHD specification has security features encrypting content 
via the Digital Transmission Content Protocol and for performing 
network management. A standard remote control allows users to 
control WirelessHD devices and choose source of information to be 
displayed on the remote screen. 
7.7. Conclusion 
Personal networks are a wide range of solutions ranging from very 
high speed to low speed with extremely diverse energy consumptions. 
Two main aims are: broadband and low-energy consumption. 
Bluetooth is not a broadband solution and UWB consumes lots of 
energy. Therefore, a new generation of WiFi is entering the market: 
WiGig.

WLAN and WiFi 
The IEEE 802.11 standard has resulted in four types of wireless 
networks, which have different peak rates: 11 Mbps, 54 Mbps, 
600 Mbps and 2 Gbps. The first is based on IEEE 802.11b, the second 
on IEEE 802.11a and g, the third on IEEE 802.11n and the fourth on 
beamforming. These four generations will be succeeded by three new 
generations with IEEE 802.11af, which could reach a global capacity 
of 10 Gbps, IEEE 802.11h to connect things on a large range, and 
IEEE 802.11ax with eight beamforming waves and several gigabit per 
second peak rate capacity. 
For the existing types, the selected frequencies are in the range of 
2.4 or 5.15 GHz. In these Local Area Networking (LAN) solutions 
using radio technology, communications can be done either directly 
from station to station, but without a station the packet can be relayed 
to another terminal station, or via an antenna called the access  
point (AP). 
Access to the physical media is performed via a  Medium Access 
Control (MAC) protocol internal to the MAC layer for all types of 
WiFi network. Many options can make the implementation rather 
complex. The MAC protocol is based on the Carrier Sense Multiple 
Access/Collision Detection (CSMA) access technique, already used in 
Ethernet networks. The difference between the wireless protocol

and the terrestrial protocol comes from the way collisions are 
detected. In the cable version, collisions are detected by listening to 
the carrier. When two stations want to transmit at the same time a 
third one is in the process of transmitting a frame then this leads 
automatically to a collision. In the wireless case, the access protocol 
avoids collisions by forcing both stations to wait before transmitting. 
Since the difference between waiting times is greater than the 
propagation time on the transmission medium, the station which has 
the longest waiting time is the physical media already occupied, 
thereby avoiding the collision. This new technique is called CSMA/ 
Collision Avoidance (CA). 
To avoid collisions, each station has a timer with a specific value. 
A station can transmit when discovering an empty channel by 
listening to the carrier. The risk of a collision occurring is extremely 
low, since the probability that two stations start their emission in the 
same microseconds is almost zero. However, when several stations 
begin to listen during a frame transmission and continue to listen, the 
collision becomes unavoidable. To prevent collision, the stations must 
wait before transmitting to separate their respective transmission 
instants. A first timer is added for a very small period of time allowing 
the receiver to immediately send an acknowledgment. A second timer 
is used to give high priority to real-time application. Finally, the 
longest timer corresponds to asynchronous packets with no real-time 
constraints. 
8.1. IEEE 802.11 
WiFi networks come from the IEEE 802.11 standard, which 
defines a cellular architecture. A group of terminals equipped with 
802.11 network interface cards can establish communications through 
an antenna or directly with each other. They then form a  Basic 
Service Set (BSS), not to be confused with the Base Station 
Subsystem (BSS) of the GSM networks. The area occupied by the 
terminal of a BSS may be a basic set area or cell. 
 

WLAN and WiFi     155 
As shown in Figure 8.1, IEEE 802.11 standard offers two modes of 
operation: the infrastructure mode and the ad-hoc mode. The  
infrastructure mode is set to provide different stations of specific 
services over a coverage area determined by network size. 
Infrastructure networks are established using APs, which play the role 
of a base station for a BSS. 
 
Figure 8.1. IEEE 802.11 mode of operation 
When the network is composed of several BSSs, each AP is 
connected to a distribution system. The distribution system  
generally corresponds to a wired Ethernet network. A group of  
BSS interconnected by a distribution system is an extented service  
set, which is not very different from a mobile radio network 
subsystem. 
The distribution system is responsible for transferring packets 
between BSSs that are different from the same ESS. In the 
specifications of the standard, the distribution system is implemented 
independently of the radio structure of the wireless system. That is 
why the distribution system almost always corresponds to an Ethernet 
network. Nothing would prevent US using other types of LAN. 
Another solution is to use the WiFi network itself, which gives a mesh 
network. 

156     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The ESS can provide different mobile stations with an access 
gateway to a fixed network, such as the Internet. This gateway 
connects the 802.11 network to another network. If this network 
corresponds to an IEEE 802.x environment, the gateway incorporates 
functions similar to those of a bridge. 
A network in ad-hoc mode is a group of terminals forming an 
Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS), whose role is to allow stations 
to communicate without using any infrastructure, such as an AP or 
connection to the distribution system. Each station can establish a 
communication with any other station within the IBSS, without having 
to go through an AP. As there is no AP, the stations will incorporate a 
number of features, such as frames used for synchronization. This 
mode is very useful for setting up a wireless network when wireless or 
landline infrastructure is lacking. 
8.2. WiFi architecture 
IEEE 802.11 covers the first two layers of the open systems 
interconnection reference model. One of its key features is that it 
defines a MAC layer common to all physical layers. In this way, 
future physical layers may be added without having to change the 
MAC layer. 
8.2.1. Physical layer 
The physical layer has the role of correctly transporting 0 or 1 
signals that the sender wants to send to the receiver. The layer is 
divided into two sublayers: Physical Layer Convergence Protocol 
(PLCP) and Physical Medium Dependent (PMD). 
The PMD takes care of encoding the data, while the PLCP sublayer 
supports listening to the media. It provides a clear channel assessment 
which is used by the MAC layer to determine whether the medium is 
busy or not. 
 

WLAN and WiFi     157 
The 
CSMA/CA 
collision 
avoidance 
technique 
uses 
acknowledgment frames or ACK. IEEE 802.11 defines four different 
physical layers: 
– frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS); 
– direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS); 
– infrared; 
– orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). 
FHSS and DSSS use the 2.4 GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical 
(ISM) band, an unlicensed band. Infrared is only used in cases where 
the distances between the different stations are low. 
The fourth physical layer has been defined in the 5.2 GHz band. 
With OFDM coding, bit rates of 54 Mbps have been achieved IEEE. 
802.11 is the first standard to use an OFDM coding for a packet type 
of communication. This technology has so far been used for 
continuous data transmission systems, such as digital video 
broadcasting and digital audio broadcasting. 
To be received correctly, the transmission cannot exceed 50 m in 
an office environment, 500 m without obstacle and several kilometers 
with an external directional antenna. When a wall has to be traversed, 
this distance is often much shorter. 
8.2.2. Data link layer 
The data link layer consists essentially of two sublayers: logical 
link control (LLC) and MAC. The LLC layer uses the same properties 
as the 802.2 LLC layer. It is thereby possible to connect a WLAN to 
any other local network belonging to the corresponding IEEE 
standard. The MAC layer, in turn, is specific for 802.11. 
The role of the 802.11 MAC layer is similar to the 802.3 MAC 
layer of the Ethernet terrestrial network, since the terminals listen to  
 
 

158     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
the carrier before transmitting. If the carrier is free, the terminal 
transmits, otherwise it waits. The 802.11 MAC layer integrates many 
features that are not found in the wired version. The features required 
to achieve access over a radio interface are: 
– support allocation procedures; 
– packet addressing; 
– frame formatting; 
– cyclic redundancy check; 
– fragmentation-reassembly. 
One of the standard features is that it basically defines two 
different access methods at the MAC layer. The first is the distributed 
coordination function (DCF), which corresponds to a similar access 
method to traditional networks supporting best-effort. The DCF is 
designed to support asynchronous data transport, in which all users 
who want to transmit data have an equal opportunity to access the 
physical medium. The second access method is point coordination 
function (PCF). This solution is based on interrogation of the different 
terminals, or polling. Polling is controlled by the AP. The PCF method 
is designed primarily for the transmission of sensitive data, requiring 
management of time used for real-time applications, such as voice or 
video. A network in ad-hoc mode only uses DCF, while an 
infrastructure network with the AP uses both DCF and PCF 
techniques. 
8.2.3. Access techniques 
DCF is the general access technique used to allow asynchronous 
best-effort data transfers. According to the standard, all stations must 
support this technique. DCF relies on the CSMA/CA access method. 
In the Ethernet, the protocol that implements the CSMA/CD 
controls each stations’ access to the carrier. The protocol detects and  
 
 
 

WLAN and WiFi     159 
processes collisions that occur when two or more stations are 
transmitting simultaneously. In WiFi networks, collision detection is 
not possible due to the radio signal. To detect a collision, a station 
must be able to listen and transmit at the same time. In radio systems, 
transmission covers reception signals on the same frequency and does 
not allow the station to hear the collision: the radio links are never 
full-duplex. As a node can listen to its own transmission, if a collision 
occurs, the station continues to transmit the entire frame, resulting in a 
loss of network performance. WiFi access technique must take 
account of this phenomenon. 
8.2.4. The CSMA/CA protocol 
The CSMA/CA access method with collision avoidance uses 
acknowledgment frames or Acknowledgement (ACK). An ACK is 
sent from the destination station to confirm that the data are received 
correctly. 
Media access is controlled by the use of inter-frame spacing (IFS), 
which corresponds to the time interval between the transmission of 
two frames. IFS intervals are periods of inactivity on the transmission 
medium. Different values of the IFS period are calculated by the 
physical layer. The standard defines three types of IFS (SiFS):  
– short inter-frame spacing: the smallest IFS is used to separate 
transmissions within the same dialogue (sending data, ACK, etc.). 
There is always one station to transmit at this time, thus having 
priority over all other stations. The value of the short inter-frame 
spacing is 28 µs; 
– point coordination function IFS is used by the AP to access the 
transmission media with priority. It has the same value as short inter-
frame spacing with an additional time, or timeslot, defined in the 
back-off algorithm, of 78 µs; 
– distributed coordination function IFS (or DIFS) is used when a 
station wants to start a new transmission. It has the same value as 
point coordination function IFS with an added time of 128 µs. 

160     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The terminals with the same BSS can listen to the activity of all 
other stations. When a station sends a frame, the other stations listen 
to avoid a collision, and update the Network Allocation Vector (NAV) 
timer to delay all planned transmissions. The NAV is calculated in 
relation to information located in the time-to-live field, or TTL, 
contained in frames that are sent. The other stations have the ability to 
transmit only after the end of the NAV. 
During a dialogue between two stations, the NAV is calculated on 
the TTL field of different frames that are sent (data, ACK, etc.). The 
NAV is actually a timer that determines the timing at which the frame 
can successfully be transmitted. A source station wishing to transmit 
data listens to the media. If no activity is detected for a period of time 
corresponding to a DIFS, it transmits its data immediately. If the 
media is still busy, it continues to listen until it is free. When the 
media becomes available, the station still delays the transmission 
using the back-off algorithm before transmitting its data. 
If the sent data are received correctly, the destination station waits 
for a time equivalent to a SIFS and sends an ACK to confirm good 
reception. If the ACK is not detected by the sending station or if the 
data are not successfully received or if the ACK is not received 
correctly, it is assumed that a collision occurred, and the frame has to 
be retransmitted. When the source station transmits its data, the other 
stations must update their NAV, including the transmission time of the 
data frame, the SIFS and the ACK. 
Figure 8.2 shows the process of transmitting frames from a 
transmitter. This process includes the different expectations we just 
detailed. 
The back-off algorithm solves the problem of media access when 
many stations want to transmit data simultaneously. In WiFi, the time 
is sliced, each slice corresponding to a timeslot. Unlike the timeslot 
used in aloha, which corresponds to the minimum transmission time 
of a frame, the timeslot used in WiFi is a little smaller. It is used to 
define the IFS intervals and timers for the different stations. Its 
implementation is different for each physical layer. 

WLAN and WiFi     161 
 
Figure 8.2. Frame transmission process 
As soon as a collision occurs, a station calculates the value of a 
timer, called the back-off timer, corresponding to a certain number of 
timeslots. When the media is free, stations decrement their timer  
until the medium is busy or the timer reaches 0. If the timer  
has not reached 0 and the support is again busy, the  
station stops the timer. Once the timer reaches 0, the station  
transmits its frame. If two or more stations reach the value 0 at  
the same time, a collision occurs, and each station must generate a 
new timer. For each retransmission attempt, the timer is based on a 
random value M defined within an interval which increases as 
follows: 
0 ≤M <2i+1 
where i is the number of consecutive times a station tried to send a 
frame. This random value is then multiplied by the timeslot to get the 
timer. 
With this algorithm, the stations have an equal probability of 
accessing the media. The only disadvantage is it does not ensure 
minimal delay and thus complicates the management of real-time 
applications such as voice or video.

162     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The transition from one cell to another without interrupting the 
communication was not provided in early versions. Handover was 
introduced through the IEEE 802.11f technique with a quite large 
delay between the beginning and the end of the handover. 
Similarly, security has been strengthened to prevent one customer 
taking the place of another or listening to another user’s 
communications. 
8.2.5. Handovers 
In wireless networks, handovers occur when a terminal wishes to 
move from one cell to another without interrupting communication. 
They are using the same solution as in mobile telephony, with some 
nuances. In wireless networks, the handover takes place between two 
data transmissions and not in the middle of a dialogue. 
The standard does not provide the handover mechanism in itself 
but sets some rules, such as synchronization, passive and active 
eavesdropping or association and reassociation, which allow stations 
to select the  AP to which they want to associate. 
When terminals move (change cell or in power-saving mode), they 
must remain synchronized to communicate. At a BSS, stations 
synchronize their clocks with the clock of the AP. To maintain 
synchronization, the AP periodically sends beacon frames, which 
contain the clock value of the AP. Upon reception of these frames, 
stations update their clock to stay synchronized with the AP. 
After switching on or return from a sleep mode or a handover – 
when a terminal wants to access a BSS or ESS controlled by one or 
more APs – this terminal chooses an AP on which it connects, 
according to a number of criteria such as signal strength, packet error 
rate and network load. If the power of the AP is weak, the station 
seeks a more appropriate AP. This search for the best AP is performed 
by listening to the media. The latter can be done in two different ways,  
 

WLAN and WiFi     163 
passive or active, according to criteria such as performance or power 
consumption: 
– passive listening: the station waits to receive a beacon frame 
from the AP; 
– active listening: when the station has found the most appropriate 
AP, it sends an association request through a frame called the Probe 
Request Frame and waits for the AP to respond. 
As soon as the terminal is accepted by the AP, it can be adjusted in 
the most appropriate radio channel. Periodically, the terminal monitors 
all network channels to judge whether an AP has better performance. 
If this is the case, it is associated with the new AP and adjusts its radio 
channel accordingly. 
Reassociations are made when a station is physically moved from 
its original AP, resulting in a decrease in signal strength. In other 
cases, reassociations are due to changes in the characteristics of the 
radio environment or due to excess network traffic on the original AP. 
In this case, the standard provides a load balancing function, which 
allows us to distribute the load effectively within the BSS or ESS and 
so avoid reassociations. 
8.2.6. Security 
In wireless networks, the radio channel is shared. All transmitted 
information can be intercepted. To enable wireless networks to have 
traffic as secure as in fixed networks, the 802.11 Working Group has 
developed the Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), whose mechanisms 
are based on data encryption and station authentication. According to 
the standard, WEP is optional. Terminals and APs are not required to 
implement it. As we will see, security is not guaranteed with WEP, 
and an attacker can break the encryption keys without much difficulty. 
The WiFi Alliance has developed a second protection mode, WiFi 
Protected Access, which solves these problems. Finally, the 802.11  
 
 

164     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
Working Group created a specific subgroup, IEEE 802.11i, which 
offered a sustainable solution, standardized in June 2004: WPA2. 
Before presenting these three security protocols, recall two 
elementary protection rules: 
– hide network name, or Service Set Identified (SSID), so that a 
user does not see the network and therefore cannot connect to it. This 
security measure is unfortunately provisional. If an attacker listens to 
the network long enough, it will see the name of the network since a 
user who wants to connect must give this SSID; 
– only allow communication controlled by a MAC address list, or 
access control list. This will not provide access to stations whose 
MAC address is not specified in the list. 
8.2.7. Wired Equivalent Privacy 
As explained above, the trust and authentication solution marketed 
with WiFi equipment is WEP. Frames transmitted over wireless 
networks are protected by encryption. Only decryption with the static 
WEP key shared between the terminal and the network is allowed. 
This key is obtained by concatenation of a secret key of 40  or 104 bits 
and an initialization vector of 24 bits. The size of the final key is 64 or 
128 bits. 
From the key obtained, the Ron’s Code 4 (RC4) algorithm 
performs the encryption of data in stream mode (stream cipher). A 
RC4 key has a length of between 8 and 2,048 bits. The key is placed 
in a pseudorandom number generator. This generator determines a 
pseudo random sequence of bytes, or keystream. This series of bytes, 
called Ksi, is used to encrypt a plaintext message (M) using a 
conventional protocol, performing an exclusive-or (XOR) between 
Ksi and Mi: 
Ci = Ksi ⊕ Mi. 
 

WLAN and WiFi     165 
The Mi message consists of data that are concatenated with their 
integrity check value. The encrypted frame is then sent with his IV. 
The IV is an index that is used to recover the keystream and thus 
decrypt the data. The WEP encryption process is shown in Figure 8.3. 
 
Figure 8.3. The WEP encryption process 
This method, using a 64- or 128-bit key, is easily broken due to the 
24-bit initialization vector, easy to identify, and the key to a length of 
40 or 104 bits. To break a 104-bit key, at the most you can now get a 
million encrypted frames. Breaking the key takes only a few minutes 
on a standard server. Methods for forcing an AP need to recover a 
million packets, often much less. This can be performed in a few 
minutes. It is strongly recommended this protection solution is not 
used. Two authentication techniques are associated with WEP: 
– open system authentication; 
– shared key authentication. 
In the first, which is the default authentication system, 
authentication is explicit. A terminal can therefore be associated with 
any AP and listen to all the data that travel within the BSS. The 
second is better because it uses a shared secret key mechanism. The 
shared key authentication mechanism involves four steps: 
1) a station wishing to associate with an AP sends an 
authentication frame; 
Initialization Vector
SharedSecret Key

166     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
2) when the AP receives this frame, it sends a frame composed of 
128 bits to the station, i.e. a random text generated by the WEP 
algorithm; 
3) after receiving the frame containing the text, the station encrypts 
the text with the shared secret key before sending this new text to  
the AP; 
4) the AP decrypts the encrypted text using the same shared secret 
key and compares it with the one that was sent earlier. If the text is 
identical, the AP confirms the correct authentication, otherwise the AP 
sends a negative authentication frame. Figure 8.4 shows these 
different steps.

WLAN and WiFi     167 
As the key used for this authentication is the same as for the 
encryption process, from the moment the key has been broken, 
authentication is also broken. A significant improvement of these 
mechanisms was made by the introduction of the IEEE 802.1x 
protocol. We describe this scheme in detail a little later in this chapter. 
8.2.8. WPA and IEEE 802.11i 
We highlighted the weaknesses of WEP. In June 2004 the IEEE 
802.11i Working Group finalized an architecture designed to fill these 
gaps WPA2. Between the time when WEP was deprecated and the 
arrival of WPA2, the WiFi Alliance supported the interim WPA 
recommendation. Based on a subset of 802.11i, WPA uses the existing 
hardware (AP and wireless card). WPA2 is not compatible with the 
first generation of WiFi equipment. The main difference between 
WPA and WPA2 encryption  is the protocol used: RC4 and AES for  
WPA and WPA2, respectively. 
The contributions of the IEEE 802.11i standard can be classified 
into three categories: 
– definition of multiple wireless security protocols; 
– information leading to the choice of one protocol; 
– new method of key distribution. 
The 802.1x standard for authentication uses the calculation of a 
master key, called the pairwise master key. In ad-hoc mode, this key is 
called the pre-shared key and distributed manually. A robust security 
network (RSN) 802.11i, or secure network, then uses 802.1x for 
authentication and key management. The access control is based on a 
strong authentication of the upper layers. The RSN must guarantee 
security and mobility, integrity and confidentiality, as well as 
scalability and flexibility. 

168     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
8.3. Security and authentication 
The security architecture must provide client authentication, 
regardless of whether home or foreign network. An architecture with 
centralized authentication server – Remote Authentication Dial-In 
User Server (RADIUS) – can satisfy this requirement. The customer 
no longer has to worry about the AP to which it is associated. 
In 802.1x architecture, network communication has three elements: 
a “supplicant”, which is the 802.1x station asking to be authenticated, 
an “authenticator”, the AP, and an authentication server, usually 
RADIUS. 
Each authenticator shares a secret with the RADIUS server with 
which it communicates. This secret is used to compute an HMAC-
MD5 summary of RADIUS packets exchanged. Each packet contains 
a RADIUS Request Authenticator field, which is an HMAC-MD5 
digest of the package, calculated with this secret. This field is inserted 
by the RADIUS server and verified by the AP. In the other 
communication direction, the RADIUS server checks the EAP 
Authenticator attribute with the EAP message attribute. These two 
attributes offer a mutual authentication packet and preserve the 
integrity of the communication between the RADIUS server and the 
AP. 
Since it is relatively easy for an attacker with suitable picking tool 
to listen to traffic between the stations on the wireless link, the 
proposed security architecture is designed to provide strong 
guarantees of confidentiality. It further defines a dynamic key 
distribution mechanism. 
8.3.1. Scalability and flexibility 
The 802.11i architecture is scalable to the number of mobile users 
supported. A user moves from one AP to another and may be 
reauthenticated quickly and securely. To meet the deployment needs 
of wireless networks in businesses and public places, this security 

WLAN and WiFi     169 
architecture is flexible in order to facilitate administration and to take 
into account the existing deployment environment. 
By separating the authenticator of the authentication process itself, 
the RSN enables scaling of the number of APs. The flexibility is 
provided by the fact that the optional Extensible Authentication 
Protocol (EAPoL)-Key message may be disabled for a particular 
deployment, where the confidentiality of data is not necessary. 
The model specifies how the 802.11i RSN interacts with 802.1x. 
Two types of protocols provide security at the MAC level: 
– Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP); 
– Counter with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authentication 
Code Protocol. 
A transitional security network supports pre-RSN architecture, 
especially the following mechanisms inherited from 802.11: 
– Open Authentication; 
– Shared Key Authentication; 
– WEP. 
An RSN network must support CCMP. NRT can, however, make 
the transition with previous networks by implementing TKIP. 
Figure 8.5 illustrates the different levels of security that must be 
supported for a global security architecture. 
Figure 8.5. Security levels in the 802.1x architecture 

170     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The authenticator (the AP) and the authentication server perform 
mutual authentication and establish a secure channel.  
8.3.2. IEEE 802.11i 
The model does not describe the methods used to carry out this 
operation; protocols such as RADIUS, IPSec or Transport Lager 
Security/Secure Socket Layer can be implemented. 
The 802.1x client or supplicant and the authentication server 
authenticate each other using the Extensible Authentication Protocol 
and generate a master key PMK. The elements of this procedure are 
carried by the secure channel. The cryptographic parameters are 
different for each 802.1x client. The Pairwise Master Key (PMK) is 
shared between the 802.1x client and the AP. They use a four-pass 
protocol, or 4-way handshake, and EAPoL-Key messages for the 
following operations: 
1) confirmation of the existence of the PMK; 
2) confirmation of the commissioning of the PMK; 
3) calculation of key Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) from the PMK; 
4) setting up encryption keys and integrity of 802.11 frames; 
5) confirmation of the setting function of 802.11 keys. 
This process is shown in Figure 8.6. 
A Group Transient Key, transmitted via EAPoL-Key packets from 
the AP to the 802.1x client, allows the latter to exchange messages in 
broadcast mode and optionally in unicast mode. In the case of the  
Pre-Shared Key mode, the PMK is preinstalled between the 802.1x 
client and the AP. 
8.3.3. Trading security policy 
An AP broadcasts in its beacon or probe frames the information 
element to notify the 802.1x client of: 

WLAN and WiFi     171 
– list of authentication infrastructure supported (typically 802.1x); 
– list of security protocols available (TKIP, CCMP, etc.); 
– encryption method for the distribution of a group key (GTK).

An 802.11 this choice is notified via an information element

Figure 8.7. 
 
Figure 8.7. Negotiating security policy 
The security of WiFi networks started inauspiciously. Today, even 
outside of WPA and WPA2 (IEEE 802.11i) there are many highly 
reliable solutions like the use of virtual private networks or 
technology-based smart cards. 
8.4. Saving energy  
Wireless terminals can be fixed or mobile. The main problem of 
mobile terminals is their battery life, which generally has little 
autonomy. To increase the terminal activity time, the IEEE 802.11 
Access Point

WLAN and WiFi     173 
standard provides a power-saving mode. Specifically, there are two 
modes of terminal operation: 
– continuous aware mode; 
– power save polling mode. 
The first is the default operation in which the station is working all 
the time and constantly listens to the media. The second allows energy 
savings. In this case, the AP maintains a record of all the stations that 
are in energy-saving mode and stores the data addressed to them. 
Stations that are on standby are activated at regular times to receive a 
particular frame, the Traffic Information Map (TIM) frame, sent by 
the AP. 
TIM frames are transmitted between AP and terminals. All stations 
share the same time interval for receiving of TIM frames. TIM frames 
allow mobile devices to know whether or not they have some data 
stored in the AP. When a terminal activates and receives a TIM frame, 
this allows us to determine that the AP contains data. The terminal 
sends the AP a request, called a Polling Request Frame, to initialize 
the data transfer. Once the transfer is complete, it returns to standby 
until reception of the next TIM frame. 
For broadcast or multicast traffic type, the AP sends a Delivery 
Traffic Information Map frame to the terminal. 
WiFi network IP packets must be transmitted over the wireless 
medium. For this, they must be placed in an Ethernet frame. To 
control and manage the connection, it is necessary to have some 
specific frames. The three types of frames available in WiFi are: 
– data frame, for the transmission of user data; 
– control frame, to control access to the media (RTS, CTS and 
ACK); 
– management frame, to associate a station with an AP, as well as 
for synchronization and authentication. 
 

174     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
All wireless frames are composed in the manner shown in 
Figure 8.8. 
 
Figure 8.8. Structure of a wireless frame 
The preamble is dependent on the physical layer and contains the 
following two sequences: 
– Synch of 80 bits alternating between 0 and 1 which is used by the 
physical circuit to select the antenna; 
– Start Frame Delimiter, a sequence of 16 bits, 0000 1100 1011 
1101, used to define the beginning of the frame: FXP246. 
The Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP) header contains 
the following logical information used by the physical layer to decode 
the frame: 
– word length PLCP_PDU: represents the number of bytes in the 
packet, which allows the physical layer to correctly detect the end of 
the packet; 
– PLCP signaling: contains information about the transmission 
speed between the adapter card and the AP; 
– error control header field: error detection CRC field of 16 bits. 
The MAC transports the underlying protocol, as shown in 
Figure 8.9. 
8.5. IEEE 802.11a, b and g 
Basic WiFi networks come from the IEEE 802.11b standard on the 
2.4 GHz band. As explained above, this standard originated from 
studies in the general 802.11 Working Group framework.

This proposal has become a standard, and billions of WiFi cards 
have been sold. First deployed on campuses, airports, train stations 
and large public and private administrations, this solution allows the 
connection of laptops, PDAs or smartphones in corporate networks. 
IEEE 802.11a and g proposals increase the capacity to more than 
50 Mbps. IEEE 802.11n was a new extension on both 2.4 and 
5.15 GHz, allowing several hundreds of Mbps. 
IEEE 802.11 networks work with APs whose peak rates are 11, 54 
and 600 Mbps and have a range of a few tens of meters. For this 
maximum carrier value, it is necessary for the terminal to be close 
enough to the AP, less than a block away. We need to engineer the 
network, while calculating the positioning of the various APs. 
Thirteen frequencies are available in the United States in the 
2,400–2,483.5 MHz band, so a total width of 83.5 MHz, and 14 in 
Europe. Three carriers maximum can be used because the 
transmission requires a bandwidth of 20 MHz which runs on 25 MHz. 
These frequencies, graded, from 1 to 13, make it possible to use 1, 6 
and 11 frequencies as the carrier. 
The 802.11b and 802.11g networks are compatible in the upward 
direction. An 802.11g card can connect to an 802.11b network at a 
speed of 11 Mbps, but the reverse is impossible. In contrast, the 
802.11b/g and 802.11a frequencies being totally different, there is no 
compatibility between the two solutions. If the device that wants

access to both networks has two access cards, the frequency can, 
however, overlap. 
8.5.2. IEEE 802.11a 
The IEEE 802.11a was the first working group but only the second 
proposed after IEEE 802.11b. For the physical part, the following 
proposals were selected for 802.11a: 
– frequency in the 5GHz frequency band U-NII without license 
(Unlicensed-National Information Infrastructure), which requires no 
license; 
– OFDM modulation with 52 carriers, allowing excellent 
performance. A total of eight independent channels are available; 
– eight rates, between 6 and 54 Mbps, are available. The rate 
selected by the access card depends on the reception strength. 
The maximum distance between the card and the AP may exceed 
100 m, but the fall in communication rate is strongly linked to 
distance. For the rate of 54 Mbps, the mobile station containing the 
WiFi card can be a few meters away from the AP. The flow drops 
very quickly to be approximately equivalent to that which would be 
achieved with 802.11b at 100 m. 
By using small cells, so that the frequencies are highly reusable, 
802.11a allows tens of customers per 100 m2. Such a network is 
therefore able to support high-quality video streaming. 
Layers above the MAC layer match those encountered in Ethernet 
networks. 
8.5.3. IEEE 802.11n 
With IEEE 802.11n pre-products, the maximum speed reached was 
108 Mbps, in late 2007. This is double IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g 
standards. IEEE 802.11n networks offer a potential peak rate of  

WLAN and WiFi     177 
600 Mbps. In fact, the actual flow rate is much lower and is in the 
order of 100 Mbps in the best case. 
The goal of the IEEE 802.11n standard is threefold: 
– to make changes to MAC and physcial levels so that the peak 
rate reaches 600 Mbps. For this, a MIMO technology is implemented; 
– to greatly improve useful throughput at the application level to 
get 100 megabits per second; 
– to stay compliant with IEEE 802.11a and 802.11g. 
The first and last goals are clearly understandable. The second is 
not so clear but we can recall the disastrous actual flow rates of the 
first WiFi networks: 5–6 Mbps at best in the case of 802.11b and some 
20 Mbps for 802.11a and 802.11g. The objective of the new standard 
is to provide an effective transfer rate of about 100 Mbps. 
IEEE 802.11n is a milestone in product compatibility, since it 
includes the IEEE 802.11i standard for security and confidentiality of 
data transport over the air interface. This standard is not compatible 
with the first two generations, especially with the use of Advanced 
Encryption Standard (AES). The increase in speed is an opportunity to 
encourage users to completely change their wireless network 
infrastructure. 
The IEEE 802.11e standard for offering a quality of service around 
DiffServ type technology is included in 802.11n. This integration 
allows us to prioritize the different flows that pass through the 
wireless network. 
IEEE 802.11n allows native handover management by integrating 
the IEEE standard 802.11f. On a wireless network, it is possible to 
switch from one AP to another AP, but the handover occurs only at a 
low speed comparable to the speed of a pedestrian. 
MIMO technology is not new, but it hit the market about 2010 due 
to a very complex implementation. MIMO aims to carry multiple 
streams in parallel on different antennas but using the same frequency. 

178     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The idea is to connect multiple antennas at the transmitter, which 
emit different flows on the same frequency. Due to the properties of 
multipath found in environments with obstacles, the signals arrive at 
different times at the receiver. If the receiver is powerful enough, it is 
able to decrypt the binary sequences arriving at different times. Note 
that the MIMO technique is satisfactory in environments with 
obstacles and use outside buildings greatly reduces its flow. 
The MIMO operation diagram is shown in Figure 8.10, assuming n 
transmitters and n receivers. MIMO can operate with only one 
receiving antenna, but with the risk of not recovering all signals. In 
this figure, the same bit sequence is transmitted over all antennas.  
The objective is to increase the quality of the transmission since the 
receiver gets the same bits several times and chooses the most 
probable value. An odd number of antennas have to be chosen to be 
sure to separate the probabilities of the bits received. To increase the 
quality of the reception by transmitting the same bit several times, 
diversity means increasing the throughput by transmitting different 
bits. This second solution is illustrated in Figure 8.11.

8.5.4. IEEE 802.11ac 
IEEE 802.11ac is a version of WiFi designed to surpass 1 Gbps, 
using multiple antennas, which can run simultaneously but in separate 
sectors. Four mutually complementary solutions have been put in 
place to obtain the target data rates. The first, which is fairly simple, 
consists simply of increasing the capacity of the transmission channel 
using the 5 GHz band, which is much freer than the 2.4 GHz band. 
The range of this higher frequency band is a little less. In addition, 
obstacles hamper the signals somewhat. However, the available 
bandwidth is 200 MHz, which is much greater than the 83.5 MHz 
assigned to the 2.4 GHz band. This enables us to have WiFi channels 
whose frequency is 80 MHz, and optionally, 160 MHz. These 
different channels are shown in Figure 8.12. 
 
Figure 8.12. The 5 Ghz band 
The second solution pertains to directionality of the signals 
emitted, using a set of specific antennas. This technique involves 
allowing the transmission of several communications on the same 
frequency, but in different directions. There is spatial multiplexing, 
which gives the name of this technique: Space Division Multiple 
Access (SDMA). Figure 8.13 illustrates this technology.

Figure 8.13. SDMA 
SDMA technology uses transmission techniques allowing us to 
direct the signals – better known as “beamforming” – whereby the 
signals are orientated in a specific direction, thus giving rise to 
directional antennas. The set of antennas, also known as virtual 
antennas, enables us to generate several directional antennas 
simultaneously, which facilitates communication with multiple clients 
at the same time. The technique used in IEEE 802.11ac is also called 
Per-User Unitary Rate Control. The IEEE 802.11ac is able to support 
up to eight spatial streams (vs. four in 802.11n). 
The third 802.11ac advance comes from multiple antennas able to 
deliver MU-MIMO (Multi-User MIMO) – that is to connect several 
pairs of clients to one another, using several antennas simultaneously 
on the same frequency, while minimizing interference. In other words, 
each directional antenna can be replaced by several antennas with the 
same directionality, using the same frequency to carry out 
communications in MIMO mode. 
The fourth solution to increase the capacity of the network is 
modulation: 256-QAM, rate 3/4 and 5/6, added as optional modes  
 
 

WLAN and WiFi     181 
(vs. 64-QAM, rate 5/6 maximum in 802.11n). Even, some vendors 
offer a non-standard 1024-QAM mode, providing 25% higher data 
rate compared to 256-QAM. 
With this technology, we are able to multiply the data rate by the 
number of directional antennas. In the example shown in Figure 8.13, 
the two physical antennas each give rise to three virtual antennas, 
which is a total of six virtual antennas. These six antennas mean that 
six simultaneous communications can be established. With these six 
antennas, we can also establish three 2 × 2 MIMO communications 
(two virtual antennas communicating with two antennas on a remote 
machine). 
We 
can 
just 
as 
well 
have 
three 
simultaneous 
communications: one 3 × 3 MIMO communication, one 2 × 2 MIMO 
communication and a one-way communication. 
The peak data rate reaches 250 Mbps per virtual antenna. With  
four physical antennas each bearing three virtual antennas, we obtain 
12 virtual antennas. Thus, the total data rate is 3 Gbps. Also, if the 
bands used are wider – say, 80 MHz instead of 20 MHz – then 
theoretically we can achieve over 10 Gbps. In actual fact, as for all 
WiFi APs, the peak data rate is only achieved in exceptional cases, 
where there is no external interference and the clients are located very 
near to the antenna. In reality, the nominal data rates are often divided 
by at least a factor of 2, but often much more, to obtain the real data 
rates.  
The group IEEE 802.11ac, with 433 Mbps per antenna over an 
80 MHz band and a MIMO with two antennas per client, delivers 
866 Mbps per connection with a terminal. With four physical 
antennas, we achieve over 3Gbps. With a bandwidth of 160 MHz, the 
data rate is doubled. The standard specifies that there may be up to 
eight spatial sectors, which again doubles the data rate. Obviously, 
these reported figures are peak data rates, which are only very rarely 
achieved in reality. As is the case with all WiFi solutions, fallback 
rates become necessary when the conditions are not ideal. 
Compatibility with existing standards also requires the adaptation of 
data rates to conform to standards which are not compatible with 
IEEE 802.11ac. 

182     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The aim with the new IEEE 802.11ax standard (Super-fast WiFi) is 
to further increase the data rate by using more numerous and more 
directional antennas. 
8.5.5. IEEE 802.11ad 
The IEEE 802.ad standard was introduced in Chapter 6 as a WPAN 
solution under the name of WiGig. But as this is a WiFi solution, we 
have summarized this solution in this section. IEEE 802.11ad uses 
frequencies in the range of 60 GHz. This standard is championed by a 
group of manufacturers: the Wireless Gigabit Alliance. The basic 
product could be tri-band WiGig, operating simultaneously on the 2.4, 
5 and 60 GHz bands, and therefore able to adapt to the environment. 
The peak data rate is 7 Gbps. The range in the 60 GHz band is less 
than 10 m, so this network is said to belong to the category of 
Personal Area Networks. 
The channels used in the base mode correspond to 57.24, 59.4, 
61.56 and 63.72 GHz. The bandwidth is 2.16 GHz. To compensate for 
the significant attenuation of the signal, IEEE 802.11ad requires 
directional antennas which can focus the radio beam within a 6° angle. 
With this very narrow beam, the IEEE 802.11ad standard is used 
outdoors between directional antennas with a direct view, or indoors 
but counting on ricochets to reach the addressee. Indeed, with a 6° 
beam, the connection between two machines is often complex. 
Fortunately, there is an option which enables us to direct the beam so 
that the two machines wishing to connect can communicate with each 
other. 
Two applications of IEEE 802.11ad are mentioned in the standard. 
The first corresponds to wireless connections for peripheral 
computers, with the aim of doing away with the numerous cables 
which trail everywhere. This application also facilitates simple sharing 
of peripheral devices. The second application relates to consumer 
electronics, associated with wireless technology, such as stereo 
equipment, HD televisions and online gaming systems. 

WLAN and WiFi     183 
8.5.6. IEEE 802.11af 
The IEEE 802.11af technique pertains to a totally different method 
to increase the data rate: the use of cognitive radio. This consists of 
reusing frequency bands which are not being used at a time t in the 
television bands. More generally, recent measurements show that, in 
spite of their scarcity and their high price, frequencies between 0 and 
20 GHz are underused – quite often less than 10%. 
The only bands which are heavily used are those employed by 
telecom operators which, owing to the TDMA, CDMA and OFDMA 
techniques, exhibit excellent degrees of utilization. The bands 
reserved for TV channels, which are below 1 gigahertz, are 
particularly attractive for operators. These TV channels could be used 
by APs to achieve ranges of hundreds of meters. Such ranges 
demonstrate that WiFi technology is capable of serving the needs of 
WiMAX and 4G clients. 
The WiFi standard IEEE 802.11af – which must not be confused 
with IEEE 802.3af, or Power over Ethernet – is called TV White 
Space. The expression “white space” refers specifically to those 
frequencies which are not used by wireless television channels. The 
operational bandwidth for cognitive radio covers dozens of digital 
television channels. The data rates achieved by this method may be 
very high indeed. The name of the product is “White-Fi“, also 
sometimes called “Super WiFi“. 
One important question relates to the way in which cognitive radio 
is used. It is for each state to regulate this usage. The main solutions 
pertain to the way in which unoccupied frequencies are used. A 
number of solutions suggest themselves, depending on the coverage of 
the cognitive AP. If the band is not occupied at the AP’s location, it 
can be assumed that it is not occupied within a radius of a few meters 
of that point. This category includes WiFi APs inside buildings with 
limited power, only covering the inside of the building. A second 
solution is to refer to a bandwidth management server, which knows 
where the bands are used. Thus, a common discipline needs to be used  
 
 

184     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
between the primary and secondary users. Standardization work is 
being carried out in different working groups, such as IEEE P1900, 
with a view to proposing solutions acceptable for both parties. In the 
United States, the proposal is to have APs and stations able to 
determine their position using a satellite positioning system such as 
GPS and use the Internet to query a geolocation database provided by 
a regional regulatory agency to discover which frequency channels are 
available for use at a given time and position. A third, more long time 
solution could stem from the ability for each device to measure the 
interference and indicate to the secondary APs whether or not they can 
exploit the frequency. 
At the physical level, the method used in IEEE 802.11af is Fixed 
Subcarrier Spacing with OFDM. The channels used in OFDM may or 
may not be contiguous – that is they may belong to television channels 
that are directly beside one another or that are separated by active 
television channels. 
A channel contains 64 bearers. Four channels may be selected, 
each operating at 6, 7 or 8 MHz. In the latter two cases, as the data 
rate per channel reaches 26.7 Mbps and given that, as with IEEE 
802.11ac, we can have at least four directions in SDMA, the 
maximum peak rate is 568.9 Mbps, with 8 MHz channels. 
The bearer access technique is the same as with normal WiFi. 
Service classes using an Enhanced Distributed Channel Access 
technique from IEEE 802.11e are available, and correspond to the four 
classes background, best-effort, video and voice. A fifth, even higher, 
priority is added for spectrum-monitoring to determine which 
channels could potentially be used. 
An important issue concerns the range of the IEEE802.11af 
solution. To avoid interference, the surface covered by the AP could 
be small if the emitting power is low, e.g. 1–10 mW. If the power is 
approaching 100 mW, the range is pretty large. A comparison is given 
in Figure 8.14. 

WLAN and WiFi     185 
 
Figure 8.14. Range comparison of the different WiFi solutions 
8.5.7. IEEE 802.11ah 
The IEEE is working on a new standard, adapted to the connection 
of “things” – i.e. sensors or other small devices with low consumption 
and often minimal cost. This solution works in the non-licensed bands 
available below 1 GHz. The different possibilities are described in 
Figure 8.15. 
The technique should enable us to connect a large number of  
things with low consumption. The sharing of the transmissions takes 
place in classic WiFi mode, but with a much lower data rate and a 
much greater range, of up to 1 km. The things are grouped into 
clearly-defined sets so as to avoid too high a number of simultaneous 
accesses and so as not to lose too much in contention in CSMA/CD 
mode. In addition, IEEE 802.11h involves the use of classic 
techniques in the world of Ethernet to put stations on standby and 
reawaken them. 

186     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
 
Figure 8.15. The 900 MHz bands 
IEEE 802.11h introduces the function of relay, whereby certain 
things can connect through the relay, which decreases competition by 
limiting the number of objects attempting to transmit simultaneously. 
Relay increases the geographic scope of the things that can be 
connected and, at the same time, saves energy by having tasks 
managed locally by the relay. In the standard, the aim is not to create a 
mesh network, as the number of hops is limited to two. 
Energy savings are also of crucial importance in the current 
context, where consumption is increasing exponentially, and the IEEE 
802.11ah standard is taking steps in this direction. For this purpose, 
the connected machines are divided into two classes: TIM (Traffic 
Indication Map) terminals and non-TIM terminals. TIM terminals 
periodically receive information about the traffic on the AP. Non-TIM 
terminals use the new mechanism Target Wake Time (TWT) to reduce 
the overhead of the signaling procedure. 
TWT is a function which allows an AP to define a time, or a set of 
times, for certain terminals to have access to the communication 

WLAN and WiFi     187 
bearer. The terminal and the AP exchange information including the 
allotted duration of the activity, to enable the AP to control any 
competition and clashes between competing terminals. The AP can 
reserve time periods for a terminal to transmit due to various 
protective mechanisms. The use of TWT is negotiated in advance 
between an AP and a terminal. The TWT mechanism is also used to 
reduce energy consumption, because stations using it can enter a semi-
sleep state until their TWT comes around. 
Another important mechanism in IEEE 802.11ah is the Restricted 
Access Window, which limits the number of terminals which have the 
right to use the AP. This limitation is achieved by putting the 
terminals into groups. Channel access is restricted solely to those 
terminals belonging to a given group, over the course of a set period. 
This mechanism helps reduce competition and avoid simultaneous 
transmissions from too high a number of machines which are unaware 
of one another’s presence. 
The IEEE also defines a Transmission Opportunity, wherein an AP 
and a client can carry out a set of exchanges during a reserved period. 
The purpose of this mode of operation is to reduce the number of 
competing channels, improve the efficacy of the channels by 
minimizing the number of exchanges and help extend the terminals’ 
battery life by minimizing their periods of activity; the rest of the 
time, the terminal is on standby. 
The division of the coverage area of a BSS into sectors, 
determining subsets of terminal machines, is called “sectorization”. It 
is done by a set of antennas or a set of directional antenna lobes to 
cover different sectors of the BSS. The goal of sectorization is to 
decrease contention and interference by reducing the number of 
terminals that can transmit simultaneously. 
8.6. Conclusion 
WiFi is doing well. It is always subject to strong expansion and the 
number of WiFi components sold every day is in the millions. The 
quality of service was a failure for the first generations of WiFi. This 

188     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
is no longer a problem with overcapacity in the recent versions that 
exceeds the Gbps and allows each user to connect to tens of Mbps.

WMAN and WiMAX 
IEEE 802.16 is a series of wireless broadband standards written by 
the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The IEEE 
Standards Board established a working group in 1999 to develop 
standards for broadband for wireless metropolitan area networks. The 
Workgroup is a unit of the IEEE 802 local area network and 
metropolitan area network standards committee. 
Although the 802.16 family of standards is officially called 
WirelessMAN in IEEE, it has been commercialized under the name 
“WiMAX” (from “Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave 
Access”) by the WiMAX Forum industry alliance. The Forum 
promotes and certifies compatibility and interoperability of products 
based on the IEEE 802.16 standards. The 802.16e-2005 amendment 
version was announced as being deployed around the world in 2009. 
This version is called Mobile WiMAX.  
The Mobile WiMAX based on the IEEE 802.16e standard (the 
mobile version of the IEEE 802.16-2004 standard) was expected to 
shift from fixed subscribers to mobile subscribers with various form 
factors: Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), phone or laptop. Hence, it 
was expected that the Mobile WiMAX would not only compete with 
the broadband wireless market share in urban areas with DSL, cable 
and optical fibers, but also threaten the hotspot-based WiFi and even 
the voice-oriented cellular wireless market. This is due to the variety 
of fundamentally different design options. For example, there are

multiple physical layer (PHY) choices: a single-carrier-based physical 
layer called Wireless-MAN-SCa, an orthogonal frequency division 
multiplexing (OFDM)-based physical layer called Wireless MAN-
OFDM and an orthogonal frequency division multiple access 
(OFDMA)-based physical layer called Wireless-OFDMA. Similarly, 
there are multiple choices for medium access control (MAC) 
architecture, duplexing, frequency band of operation, etc. 
However, for practical reasons of interoperability, the scope of the 
standard needs to be reduced, and a smaller set of design choices for 
implementation need to be defined. The WiMAX Forum does this by 
defining a limited number of system and certification profiles. 
Accordingly, WiMAX Forum has defined mobility system profiles for 
IEEE 802.16e, which we use in the entire dissertation for the design of 
the wireless communication system and the performance evaluation of 
the Mobile WiMAX in the link and the system levels. 
In this chapter, we present a concise technical overview of the 
emerging Mobile WiMAX solution for broadband wireless. The 
purpose here is to provide an executive summary for the most 
important issues related to the Quality of Service (QoS) in Mobile 
WiMAX, mobility, PHY and MAC layers. 
9.1. Background on IEEE 802.16e 
Mobile WiMAX based on IEEE 802.16e is a wireless broadband 
solution that offers a rich set of features with a lot of flexibility in 
terms of deployment options and potential service offering. These 
features provided by both MAC and PHY layers deserve highlighting 
as follows: 
9.1.1. The medium access control layer 
The MAC layer of Mobile WiMAX provides a medium-independent 
interface to the PHY layer and is designed to support the wireless PHY 
layer by focusing on efficient radio resource management. The MAC 

WMAN and WiMAX     193 
layer supports both Point-to-Multipoint (PMP) and Mesh network 
modes and is divided into three sublayers: 
Sublayers: the service-specific convergence sublayer, common part 
sublayer and security sublayer. The primary task of service-specific 
convergence sublayer is to classify external Service Data Units 
(SDUs) and associate each of them with a proper MAC Service Flow 
(SF) identifier and connection identifier. The common part sublayer 
function is to (1) segment or concatenate the SDUs received from 
higher layers into the MAC Protocol Data Units (PDU), (2) retransmit 
MAC PDUs that were received erroneously by the receiver when 
Automated Repeat Request (ARQ) is used, (3) provide QoS control 
and priority handling of MAC PDUs belonging to different data and 
signaling bearers and (4) schedule MAC PDUs over the PHY 
resources. The security sublayer handles authentication, secure key 
exchange and encryption. Among all these functions, we will put the 
accent on QoS-related functions and mechanisms that are associated 
with our field of interest and our proposed solutions, as described in 
the next section. 
9.1.2. Channel access mechanism 
In mobile WiMAX, the MAC layer at the Base Station (BS) is 
fully responsible for allocating bandwidth to all Mobile Stations 
(MSs), in both uplink and downlink. It supports several mechanisms 
by which an MS can request and obtain uplink bandwidth. Depending 
on the particular QoS and traffic parameters associated with a service, 
one or more of these mechanisms may be used by the MS. The BS 
allocates dedicated or shared resources periodically to each MS, which 
it can use to request bandwidth. This process is called polling. Mobile 
WiMAX defines a contention access and resolution mechanism for the 
case when more than one MS attempts to use the shared resource. If it 
already has an allocation for sending traffic, the MS is not polled. 
Instead, it is allowed to request more bandwidth by (1) transmitting a 
stand-alone bandwidth request or (2) piggybacking a bandwidth 
request on generic MAC packets. 

194     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
9.1.3. Quality of service 
Support for QoS is a fundamental part of the mobile WiMAX 
MAC layer design, strong QoS control is achieved by using a 
connection-oriented MAC architecture, where all downlink and uplink 
connections are controlled by the serving BS. Before any data 
transmission happens, the BS and the MS establish a unidirectional 
logical link, called a connection, between the two MAC-layer peers. 
Each connection is identified by a Connection Identifier (CID), which 
serves as a temporary address for data transmission over the particular 
link. 
Mobile WiMAX also defines a concept of a service flow. An SF is 
a unidirectional flow of packets with a particular set of QoS 
parameters and is defined by a Service Flow Identifier (SFID). To 
support a variety of applications, mobile WiMAX defines five SFs: 
– unsolicited grant services (UGS): this is designed to support 
fixed-size data packets at a Constant Bit Rate (CBR). Examples of 
applications that may use this service are T1/E1 emulation and VoIP 
without silence suppression. The SF parameters that define this 
service are maximum sustained traffic rate, maximum latency, 
tolerated jitter and request/ transmission policy; 
– real-time polling services (rtPS): this service is designed to 
support real-time SFs such as MPEG video that generate variable-size 
data packets on a periodic basis. The mandatory SF parameters that 
define this service are minimum reserved traffic rate, maximum 
sustained traffic rate, maximum latency and request/transmission 
policy;  
– extended real-time variable rate (ertPS) service: this service is 
designed to support real-time applications, such as VoIP with silence 
suppression, which have variable data rates but require guaranteed 
data rate and delay. The mandatory SF parameters that define this 
service are minimum reserved traffic rate, maximum sustained traffic 
rate, maximum latency and request/transmission policy; 
– non real-time polling service (nrtPS): this service is designed to 
support delay-tolerant data streams, such as an FTP, which require 

WMAN and WiMAX     195 
variable-size data grants at a minimum guaranteed rate. The 
mandatory SF parameters to define this service are minimum reserved 
traffic rate, maximum sustained traffic rate, traffic priority and 
request/transmission policy; 
– best-effort (BE) service: this service is designed to support data 
streams, such as Web browsing, which do not require a minimum 
service-level guarantee. The mandatory SF parameters to define this 
service are maximum sustained traffic rate, traffic priority and 
request/transmission policy. 
9.1.4. Mobility support 
In addition to fixed broadband access, mobile WiMAX envisions 
four mobility-related usage scenarios: nomadic, portable, simple 
mobility up to 60 kmph and full mobility up to 120 kmph. The IEEE 
802.16e defines a framework for supporting mobility management. 
9.2. The physical layer  
The mobile WiMAX physical layer is based on OFDMA. OFDMA 
is the transmission scheme of choice to enable high-speed data, video 
and multimedia communications and is used by a variety of 
commercial broadband systems, including DSL, WiFi, etc. In this 
section, we cover the basics of OFDMA and provide an overview of 
the Mobile WiMAX physical layer. 
9.2.1. Subchannelization in Mobile WiMAX: OFDMA 
OFDM is a very powerful transmission technique. It is based on 
the idea of dividing a given high-bit-rate data stream into several 
parallel lower bit-rate streams and modulating each stream on separate 
carriers often called subcarriers. OFDM is a spectrally efficient 
version of multicarrier modulation, where the subcarriers are selected 
such that they are all orthogonal to one another over the symbol 
duration, thereby avoiding the need to have non-overlapping 
subcarrier channels to eliminate intercarrier interference. 

196     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
In order to have multiple user transmissions, a multiple access 
scheme such as Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) or 
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) has to be associated 
with OFDM. In fact, an OFDM signal can be made from many user 
signals, giving the OFDMA multiple access. The multiple access has a 
new dimension with OFDMA. A downlink or an uplink user will have 
a time and a subcarrier allocation for each of its communications. 
However, the available subcarriers may be divided into several groups 
of subcarriers called subchannels. Subchannels may be constituted 
using either contiguous subcarriers or subcarriers pseudo randomly 
distributed across the frequency spectrum. Subchannels formed using 
distributed subcarriers provide more frequency diversity. This 
permutation can be represented by Partial Usage of Subcarriers 
(PUSC) and Full Usage of Subcarriers (FUSC) modes. 
The subchannelization scheme based on contiguous subcarriers in 
mobile WiMAX is called Band Adaptive Modulation and Coding 
(AMC). Although frequency diversity is lost, band AMC allows 
system designers to exploit multiuser diversity, allocating subchannels 
to users based on their frequency response. 
9.2.2. Slot and frame structure in OFDMA-based mobile 
WiMAX 
Before giving details of mobile WiMAX frame structure, it is 
worth mentioning that the downlink and uplink transmissions coexist 
according to one of the two duplexing modes: Time Division Duplex 
(TDD) or Frequency Division Duplex (FDD). They are sent through 
the downlink and uplink subframes. However, TDD is favored by a 
majority of implementations of WiMAX forum. The frame is divided 
into two subframes: a downlink subframe followed by an uplink 
subframe after a small guard interval. Figure 9.1 shows an OFDMA 
frame when operating in TDD mode. The downlink subframe begins 
with a downlink preamble that is used for physical layer procedures, 
such as time and frequency synchronization and initial channel 
estimation. The download preamble is followed by a Frame Control 
Header (FCH), which provides frame configuration information, such 
as the MAP message length, the modulation and coding scheme, and 

WMAN and WiMAX     197 
the usable subcarriers. Multiple users are allocated data regions within 
the frame, and these allocations are specified in the Uplink and 
downlink MAP messages (DL-MAP and UL-MAP) that are 
broadcasted following FCH in the downlink subframe. MAP messages 
include the burst profile for each MS, which defines the modulation 
and coding scheme used in that link. 
 
Figure 9.1. A simple mobile WiMAX OFDMA  
frame structure for the TDD mode 
The uplink subframe is made up of several uplink bursts from 
different users. A portion of the uplink subframe is set aside for 
contention-based access that is used for a variety of purposes. This 
subframe is used mainly as a ranging channel to perform closed-loop 
frequency, time and power adjustments during network entry as well 
as periodically afterward. The ranging channel may also be used by 
MS to make uplink bandwidth requests. Besides the ranging channel 
and traffic bursts, the uplink subframe has a Channel Quality Indicator 
Channel (CQICH) for the MS to feedback channel-quality information 

198     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
that can be used by the BS scheduler and an Acknowledgment (ACK) 
channel for the MS to feedback downlink acknowledgments. 
According to what we described in the previous section, once 
higher layer data have been classified into SFs and scheduled by the 
MAC layer, they are assigned to OFDMA slots by a slot allocator. A 
slot is the basic resource unit in OFDMA frame structure as it is a unit 
of (subchannel-symbol). One can consider that the data region 
(OFDMA frame) is a two-dimensional allocation which can be 
visualized as a rectangle. Allocating OFDMA slots to data in the 
downlink is done by segmenting the data after the modulation process 
into blocks that fit into one OFDMA slot. It is considerable to note 
that the definition of an OFDMA slot depends mainly on the mode of 
permutation of subcarriers in an OFDMA subchannel, i.e. FUSC, 
PUSC and AMC. Given that we focus on AMC mode for resource 
allocation in this book, we will detail only the structure of slots in an 
AMC OFDMA frame in the following section. 
9.2.3. OFDMA slot structure in AMC permutation mode 
Mobile WiMAX supports a variety of AMC schemes and allows 
for the scheme to change on a burst-by-burst basis per link, depending 
on channel conditions. In the downlink, Quadrature Phase Shift 
Keying (QPSK), 16 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and 64 
QAM are mandatory for mobile WiMAX; 64 QAM is optional in the 
uplink. Forward Error Correction (FEC) using convolutional codes is 
mandatory. Convolutional codes are combined with an outer Reed-
Solomon code in the downlink for OFDM-PHY. The standard 
optionally supports turbo codes and Low Density Parity Check 
(LDPC) codes at a variety of code rates as well. A total of 52 
combinations of modulation and coding schemes are defined in 
mobile WiMAX as burst profiles. In order to constitute an OFDMA 
frame in the AMC, it is important to understand the slot structure that 
is called band AMC mode. 
Unique to the band AMC permutation mode, all subcarriers 
constituting a sub channel are adjacent to each other. Therefore, 
having a microscopic view of an OFDMA frame in AMC mode, nine 

WMAN and WiMAX     199 
adjacent subcarriers with eight data subcarriers and one pilot 
subcarrier are used to form a bin, as shown in Figure 9.2. Four 
adjacent bins in the frequency domain constitute a band. An AMC slot 
consists of six contiguous bins within the same band. Thus, an AMC 
slot can consist of one bin over six consecutive symbols, two 
consecutive bins over three consecutive symbols or three consecutive 
bins over two consecutive symbols. Therefore, in each frame, MSs are 
allocated a successive set of slots, forming bursts. Each allocation is 
represented in the DL-MAP message by the slot offset and the number 
of slots in the allocation frame. 
Generally, the BS receives periodically the Channel Quality 
Indicator feedback from the MSs indicating information such as 
channel-quality measurements such as Received Signal Strength 
Indicator and Signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Then, the 
BS supporting AMC allows the scheduler to exploit multiuser 
diversity by allocating each MS to its corresponding strongest sub 
channel. Hence, increasing the overall throughput of the system.

9.3. An example of WiMAX and WiFi integration 
The general WiFi/Mobile WiMAX interworking environment we 
consider is illustrated in Figure 9.3. We adopt the interworking 
architecture based on loose coupling. The necessary changes in both 
WiFi and Mobile WiMAX systems are rather limited as it will 
integrate both systems at the IP layer and relies on the IP protocol to 
handle mobility between access networks. 
The main characteristic of this architecture is to assume two 
overlapped cells of a Mobile WiMAX and a WiFi, where both cells 
are served by a BS and an access point respectively. We assume that 
the AP is connected to the WiFi access network which can have a 
dedicated gateway to the Mobile WiMAX and traffic from Mobile 
WiMAX to WiFi or vice versa will be routed through this gateway. 
The MN has dual interfaces: WiMAX and WiFi.  
As shown in Figure 9.3, the Mobile WiMAX supports access to 
variety of IP multimedia services via WiMAX radio access 
technologies which is called Access Service network (ASN). The 
ASN is owned by a Network Access Provider and comprises one or 
more BSs and one or more ASN gateways (ASN-GW) that form the 
radio access network. Access control and traffic routing for MSs in 
Mobile WiMAX are entirely handled by the Connectivity Service 
Network, which is owned by a Network Service Provider, and 
provides IP connectivity and all the IP core network functions. The 
WiFi access network may be owned either by the NAP or by any other 
part (e.g. public WiFi operator or an airport authority), in which case 
the interworking is enabled and governed by appropriate business and 
roaming agreement. 
For enabling the interworking of WiFi/Mobile WiMAX, the 
Mobile WiMAX CSN core network incorporates four new functional 
elements: the Mobile WiMAX AAA server, the CSN-GW, the WiFi 
access gateway (WAG) and the Packet Data Gateway (PDG). The 
WiFi must also support similar interworking functionality to meet the 
access control and routing enforcement requirements. The Mobile  
 
 

WMAN and WiMAX     201 
WiMAX AAA server in the Mobile WiMAX domain terminates all 
AAA signaling originated in the WiFi that pertains to HMS. This 
signaling is typically based on radius or diameter. The Mobile 
WiMAX AAA server interfaces with other Mobile WiMAX 
components, such as the WAG and PDG. The Mobile WiMAX AAA 
server can also route AAA signaling to/from another Mobile WiMAX 
AAA server, in which case it serves as a proxy and is referred to as 
Mobile WiMAX AAA proxy. To support mobility, the Foreign 
Agents (FA) located in the ASN Gateway are considered as the local 
FAs in the interworking architecture. However, for enabling vertical 
handover, a Mobile IP Home Agent (HA) has been added to the 
architecture. While the HA may be local to either network, it must be 
accessible by both networks. 
 
Figure 9.3. WiFi/WiMAX interworking architecture 
As shown in Figure 9.3, traffic from HMS is routed to the WAG 
and finally to the PDG. This routing is enforced by establishing 
appropriate traffic tunnels after a successful access control procedure. 
The PDG function is much like a CSN-GW in Mobile WiMAX 
domain. It routes the user data traffic between the HMS and an  
 
 

202     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
external packet data network (in our case, the IP multimedia network), 
and serves as an anchor point that hides the mobility of the HMSs 
within the WiFi domain. The WAG functions mainly as a route policy 
element, ensuring that user data traffic from authorized HMS is routed 
to the appropriate PDGs, located in either the same or a foreign 
Mobile WiMAX. 
9.3.1. QoS management 
One vital component for the provision of seamless multimedia 
session continuity is QoS consistency across the WiFi and Mobile 
WiMAX networks. This is indeed vital because without QoS 
consistency the multimedia sessions will experience different QoS 
levels in both network domains, and hence seamless continuity will 
not be achievable. It is unfortunate, however, that the WiFi and 
Mobile WiMAX specifications were based on rather different sets of 
requirements, and they ended up supporting rather different sets of 
QoS features. Consequently, QoS consistency turns out to be a very 
challenging issue. To provide more insight on this issue, we discuss a 
list of WiFi QoS deficiencies with respect to Mobile WiMAX QoS. 
Apparently, when we target multimedia session continuity across 
WiFi and Mobile WiMAX networks, we should carefully take these 
deficiencies into consideration and understand their impacts. The 
discussion is based on the assumption that the WiFi MAC layer 
complies with IEEE 802.11 plus the amendments of IEEE 802.11e, 
and the physical layer complies with IEEE 802.11g. The mobile 
version of WiMAX is based on IEEE 802.16e while the fixed version 
on IEEE 802.16d. 
9.3.2. Qos support and classes 
IEEE 802.11 standard is intended to support only best effort 
service, however, IEEE 802.11e introduced basic QoS support by 
defining four different access categories (ACs), namely AC_VO 
(voice) with highest priority, AC_VI (video), AC_BE (best effort) and 
AC_BK (background) with lowest priority.

Table 9.1. IEEE 802.11e access category and user priority mapping 
While in IEEE 802.16e, the QoS is represented by five SFs: 
Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS) for (VoIP without silence 
suppression), Real-time polling service (rtPS) for (video), Extended 
Real-time polling service (ertPS) for (voice with silence suppression), 
Non Real-time polling service (nrtPS) for (FTP) and best effort. From 
the difference in the supported QoS classes, it becomes clear that a 
vertical handover from Mobile WiMAX to WiFi needs to involve a 
QoS mapping procedure. Therefore, we have to define for each WiFi 
QoS class or AC, which Mobile WiMAX SF type we assign and 
additionally we have to provide a mapping from Traffic Specification 
negotiated in WiFi in Action. ADDT requests to Dynamic Service 
Addition Request (DSA-REQ) negotiated in Mobile WiMAX. 
9.4. Mechanisms of channel access 
An important aspect to consider is that the basic support for QoS 
differs significantly between WiFi and Mobile WiMAX due to their 
different PHY and MAC layers design. While the access to the 
channel in Mobile WiMAX is completely centralized, it can be 
distributed or centralized in WiFi based 802.11e. This is explained in 
the next section. 

204     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
9.4.1. WiFi access methods 
It is worth describing the mandatory access method in the legacy 
802.11 in order to compare it with the 802.11e. The access method is 
based on Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). The basic DCF 
uses a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance 
(CSMA/CA) mechanism to regulate access to the shared wireless 
medium. Before initiating a transmission, each WS is required to sense 
the medium and perform a binary exponential backoff. If the medium 
has been sensed as being idle for a time interval called DCF Interframe 
Space (DIFS), the WS enters a backoff procedure. A slotted backoff 
time is generated randomly from a Contention Window (CW) size: 
backoff time = rand [0, CW] x slot time. In DCF, only best effort 
service is provided. Time-bounded multimedia applications (e.g. voice 
over IP and videoconferencing) require certain bandwidth, delay and 
jitter guarantees. The point is that with DCF, all the WSs compete for 
the channel with the same priority. There is no differentiation 
mechanism to provide better service for real-time multimedia traffic 
than for data applications. This is the reason behind introducing the 
hybrid coordination function in the IEEE 802.11e which consists of two 
different methods of medium access and uses the concepts of Traffic 
Opportunity (TXOP), which refers to a time duration during which a 
WS is allowed to transmit a burst of data frames: 
1) The Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) method in 
which each AC behaves as a single DCF contending entity with its 
own contention parameters (CWmin, CWmax, AIFS and TXOP), 
which are announced by the AP periodically in beacon frames. 
Basically, the smaller the values of CWmin, CWmax and AIFS[AC], 
the shorter the channel access delay for the corresponding AC and the 
higher the priority for access to the medium. In EDCA, a new type of 
IFS is introduced, the Arbitrary IFS (AIFS), instead of DIFS in DCF. 
Each AIFS is an IFS interval with arbitrary length as follows: AIFS = 
SIFS + AIFSN × {slot time}, where AIFSN is called the arbitration 
IFS number. After sensing that the medium has been idle for a time 
interval of AIFS[AC], each AC calculates its own random backoff 
time (CWmin[AC] ≤ backoff time ≤CWmax[AC]). The purpose of 
using different contention parameters for different queues is to give a 
low-priority class a longer waiting time than a high-priority class, so 

WMAN and WiMAX     205 
the high-priority class is likely to access the medium earlier than the 
low-priority class. 
2) The polling-based HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) 
method in which different traffic classes called traffic streams (TSs) 
are introduced. Before any data transmission, a traffic stream (TS) is 
first established, and each WS is allowed to have no more than eight 
TSs with different priorities. In order to initiate a TS connection, a WS 
sends a QoS request frame containing a Traffic Specification (TSPEC) 
to the AP. A TSPEC describes the QoS requirements of TS, such as 
mean/peak data rate, mean/maximum frame size, delay bound and 
maximum Required Service Interval (RSI). On receiving all these QoS 
requests, the AP scheduler computes the corresponding HCCA-TXOP 
values for different WSs by using their QoS requests in TSPECs 
(TXOP1, TXOP2, etc.) and polls them sequentially. 
9.4.2. Mobile WiMAX access method 
In Mobile WiMAX, the MAC layer at the base station is fully 
responsible for allocating bandwidth to all users, in both the uplink 
and the downlink. The only time the MS has some control over 
bandwidth allocation is when it has multiple sessions or connections 
with the BS. Depending on the particular QoS and traffic parameters 
associated with a service, one or more of these mechanisms may be 
used by the MS. The BS allocates dedicated or shared resources 
periodically to each MS, which it can use to request bandwidth. This 
process is called polling. Polling may be done either individually 
(unicast) or in groups (multicast). Multicast polling is done when there 
is insufficient bandwidth to poll each MS individually. When polling 
is done in multicast, the allocated slot for making bandwidth requests 
is a shared slot which every polled MS attempts to use. Mobile 
WiMAX defines a contention access and resolution mechanism for the 
case when more than one MS attempts to use the shared slot. If it 
already has an allocation for sending traffic, the MS is not polled. 
Instead, it is allowed to request more bandwidth by (1) transmitting a 
stand-alone bandwidth request MPDU, (2) sending a bandwidth 
request using the ranging channel or (3) piggybacking a bandwidth 
request on generic MAC packets. 

206     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
9.4.3. Handover support 
Handover in WiFi is almost always hard, which means break-then-
make approach. This is because the WiFi station cannot be serviced in 
parallel by more than one AP and therefore has to break  
its communication with its current AP before establishing connection 
with a new one. Hence, considerable transmission disruptions  
may exist that result in QoS degradation. Moreover, handovers  
in IEEE 802.11 are solely controlled by the WiFi AP, so the  
WiFi infrastructure cannot provide tight control of the QoS 
provisioning. 
However, in IEEE 802.16e, there are three types of handover:  
(1) hard handover, (2) fast base station switching (FBSS) and (3) 
macro diversity handover (MDHO). In the last two methods, the MS 
maintains a valid connection simultaneously with more than one BS. 
In the FBSS case, the MS maintains a list of the BSs involved, called 
the active set. The MS continuously monitors the active set, does 
ranging and maintains a valid connection ID with each of them. The 
MS, however, communicates with only one BS, called the anchor BS. 
When a change of anchor BS is required, the connection is switched 
from one base station to another without having to explicitly  
perform 
handover 
signaling. 
The 
MS 
simply 
reports 
the  
selected anchor BS on the CQICH. Macro diversity handover is 
similar to FBSS, except that the MS communicates on the downlink 
and the uplink with all the base stations in the active set-called a 
diversity set here- simultaneously. In the downlink, multiple copies 
received at the MS are combined using any of the well-known 
diversity-combining techniques. In the uplink, where the MS sends 
data to multiple base stations, selection diversity is performed to pick 
the best uplink. 
9.5. IEEE 802.16m or mesh for WiMAX 
WiMAX networks can be structured into two operating modes: 
Point-to-Multipoint and mesh networks. Mesh mode is a type of 
operation that can interconnect multiple mobile clients together with 
many WiMAX base stations (nodes) and form a network of 

WMAN and WiMAX     207 
connections so as to provide a wide coverage area for mobile clients. 
All the clients can communicate with each other and there is no need 
for an intermediate node to act as the mediator of the network. In this 
mode, the IEEE 802.16 can provide broadband access with wireless 
support both single-hop and multi-hop settings. The basic topology of 
an IEEE 802.16 mesh network consists of two participating entities, 
called BS and subscriber station (SS), displayed below (Figure 9.4). 
The BS is the central node, responsible for coordinating all the 
communication and providing connectivity to the client stations (fixed 
or mobile). 
 
Figure 9.4. Topology of an IEEE 802.16 mesh network 
9.6. IEEE 802.16h or cognitive radio for WiMAX 
The final 802.16h IEEE standard defines a set of cognitive radio 
capabilities for WiMAX networks. 
The proposed global framework is divided into two separate 
profiles. 
The 
first 
one 
provides 
uncoordinated 
coexistence 
mechanisms (WirelessMAN-UCP), i.e. without requiring much 
interaction among the different systems and hence adequate for 
heterogeneous systems, while the second provides coordinated 
coexistence mechanisms (WirelessMAN-CX), which addresses the 

208     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
required coordination of neighboring systems in order to reduce the 
interference generated to each other. 
9.6.1. Uncoordinated coexistence mechanism 
In a real scenario, a WiMAX network may coexist with licensed 
users (denoted in the amendment as specific spectrum users) and other 
unlicensed users (denoted as non-specific spectrum users) sharing the 
same frequency band. In such a case, the interference that the WiMAX 
system may cause to each of the users can be different. The standard 
IEEE 802.16h defines three possible levels of interference: 
– acceptable interference: this level of interference does not cause 
degradation in the receiver performance for a given choice of 
modulation and/or coding. This interference is admissible for both 
licensed and unlicensed users; 
– harmful interference: strong interference that decreases the link 
performance in terms of modulation/coding. While this interference 
must be avoided in licensed links, some amount of communication is 
still possible and thus could be acceptable for unlicensed users; 
– destructive interference: the receiver is not capable of decoding 
the received signal for any available modulation at the transmitter. It 
must be avoided. 
In order to achieve these acceptable interference levels, both to 
licensed users and unlicensed users, the standard provides a set of 
mechanisms. These include: 
– testing channels for other users; 
– discontinuing operations after detecting channel activity; 
– detecting other users; 
– scheduling for channel testing; 
– requesting and reporting measurements by different nodes; 
– selecting and advertising a new channel. 

WMAN and WiMAX     209 
While all these procedures are described in detail in the standard, 
the timing and threshold parameters used are left open and must be 
specified by each regulatory administration. In the case of unlicensed 
users, the proposed procedures are still valid with minor variations. 
For example, instead of performing a search for channels free of 
licensed users, the cognitive network looks for the best set of channels 
for operation either when certain unlicensed users are present. 
The standard 802.16h, in the uncoordinated profile, permits 
distributed architectures for the radio resource management within the 
network formed by one 802.16 BS and its associated subordinated 
nodes. Each BS has a Distributed Radio Resource Management entity 
to execute the spectrum sharing policies of 802.16h and to build up a 
database for sharing information related to actual and intended future 
usage of radio spectrum. This database can be recovered from a 
master entity with the required information or from different devices 
(e.g. using the GPS, IP address, operator information, radio signature 
scheduling info, etc.). 
In order to avoid the regulation infringement, the different 
interferers must be identified by their radio signature, which can be a 
short preamble, peak power, relative spectral density, etc. Every 
transmitter will send the radio signature during an interference-free 
slot. The time position of this slot (frame number, sub-frame and time-
shift) will be used for identification. 
Once the environmental data are available, the Radio Resource 
Management entity performs a real-time, adaptive scheduling, which 
can be done in terms of channel or even interference free regions 
within a MAC frame. 
9.6.2. Coordinated coexistence mechanism 
When multiple secondary networks coexist in the same region, 
they can collaborate in order to coordinate their transmissions  
and build a neighbor relationship. In the standard 802.16h, the  
 

210     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
following three basic mechanisms for achieving coexistence are 
provided: 
– MAC Frame Synchronization, including Tx and Rx intervals, for 
separating transmissions and enabling operation in synchronized zones; 
– Dynamic Channel Selection and Adaptive Channel Selection for 
finding a less interfered or less used frequency (similar to the 
uncoordinated case); 
– separation of the remaining interference in the time domain, by 
using a Coexistence Frame, coordinated scheduling and a fairness 
approach, thus allowing the usage of a frequency channel by more 
than one system.

WRAN and Interconnection 
In this chapter, we introduce two different sections. The first one is 
devoted to IEEE 802.11 which uses Regional Area Network (RAN) 
technology. RAN technology provides a very large cell with a range 
of several tens of kilometers. The second section considers the link 
between the different wireless solutions: how to interconnect Personal 
Area Networks (PANs), Local Area Networks (LANs), Metropolitan 
Area Networks (MANs) and RANs. 
10.1. IEEE 802.22 
A new initiative supported by many manufacturers in the field of 
regional area networks (RANs) concerns Wireless Regional Area 
Network (WRAN). This standard, whose study started in 2005, was 
finalized in 2014. It aims to use the white TV band, that is to say the 
unused TV channels. The selected frequencies being between 54 and 
862 MHz, the range can reach several tens of kilometers and allow 
applications to broadcast interactive television, interactive video 
games and video on demand on laptops on the move.  
IEEE P802.22.1 is a standard to enhance harmful interference 
protection for low-power licensed devices operating in TV bands. 
IEEE P802.22.2 is a recommended practice for the installation and 
deployment of IEEE 802.22 systems. IEEE 802.2.3 defines a standard 
for spectrum characterization and occupancy sensing. The three

802.22 task groups (TG1, TG2, and TG3) are writing 802.22.1, 
802.22.2, and 82.22.3, respectively. 
Currently, some more subgroups have been defined within the 
IEEE802.22.2 to help the deployment of the solution: 
IEEE 802.22.2a – This amendment defines a new clause for 
Management and Control Plane Interfaces and Procedures to the 
existing IEEE 802.22-2011 for operation in Very High Frequency 
(VHF)/Ultra High Frequency (UHF) TV broadcast bands between 54 
and 862 MHz. The Management Information Base (MIB) structure 
enhancements include changes to comply with the ASN.1 format and 
support for the new clause. Modifications to the existing clause on 
primitives are intended  for Cognitive Radio Capabilities to align it 
with the content in the MIB clause. 
IEEE 802.22b – This amendment specifies alternate Physical Layer 
and necessary Medium Access Control Layer (MAC) enhancements to 
IEEE802.22-2011 for operation in VHF/UHF TV broadcast bands 
between 54 and 862 MHz to support enhanced broadband services and 
monitoring applications. The standard supports aggregate data rates 
greater than the maximum data rate supported by the IEEE 802.22-
2011. This standard defines new classes of 802.22 devices to address 
these applications and supports more than 512 devices in a network. 
This standard also specifies techniques to enhance communications 
among the devices and makes necessary amendments to the cognitive, 
security and parameters and connection management clauses. This 
amendment supports mechanisms to enable coexistence with other 
802 systems in the same band. 
The WRAN underlying techniques are very innovative with the use 
of cognitive radio on a long range, to determine, for a given terminal, 
the direction of the emission, power and frequency use. For this, a 
central database must be able to answer a query to the antenna 
indicating the frequency to be used. This solution enables us to 
increase the spectral use. 
Each base station would be armed with a GPS receiver to be able 
to check the position of the antenna. This information is sent to a 

WRAN and Interconnection     215 
centralized server (in the Unites States, this central server is managed 
by the FCC), which responds with the information about available free 
TV channels and guard bands in the area of the base station. Other 
solutions are available as local spectrum sensing, where the base 
station can decide by itself which channels are available for the 
communications. A combination of these two approaches is also a 
possibility to enhance the use of cognitive radio in the TV band. 
A third solution is to allow the mobile stations to themselves 
perform a cognitive sensing. The mobile stations sense the spectrum 
and send periodic reports to the base station to inform them of the 
available channels. The base station, with the information gathered, 
evaluates whether a change is necessary in the channel used, or on the 
contrary, if it should stay transmitting and receiving in the same one.  
The physical layer uses the OFDMA technique on a 6–8 MHz 
channel corresponding to a TV channel. The maximum global 
throughput for a range of 30 km is 20 Mbps. Several TV channels can 
be used simultaneously to increase the total capacity of the system. 
Concerning the OFDMA MAC technique used in WRAN system, 
the initialization and network entry need to accommodate the elements 
of the spectrum usage flexibility. As there is not a fixed channel for 
the system, and no pilot channel can be broadcast, any terminal station 
when turning on and initializing needs to be able to find the signals. 
Accordingly, when initializing, any mobile station first scans the 
available spectrum to look at channel occupancy. First, the mobile 
station has to detect the free channel within the TV band. In the empty 
channels, the mobile station scans for base station pilot signals and 
acquires any network information available. Once the mobile station 
has acquired the correct network, it can then proceed to connect to the 
network. 
Within the OFDM solution, it is necessary to define a format for 
data transmission. To enable the data to be suitably structured, the 
transmission is formatted into frames and superframes. The frames are 
split into two elements: the upstream subframe and the downstream 
subframe. The boundary between these two subframes is variable and  
 

216     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
can be adapted to accommodate changes on the levels of upstream and 
downstream capacity. The superframes are built up from the smaller 
frames. The superframe is used to provide overall synchronization for 
the system, and in particular provides the initial network access 
initialization. At the beginning of each superframe, there is a preamble 
known as the superframe Control Header. The superframe Control 
Header contains the information needed for any new mobile stations 
that need to access the base station. 
Considering that an antenna can expect to have 200 MHz of global 
bandwidth below 1 GHz, which is to say for waves penetrating into 
buildings, such as television bands, it is obvious that this new regional 
technology will compete with already established operator solutions. 
A single antenna with a 200 MHz available bandwidth allows a 20–30 
km range that should allow us to group 3,000 interactive television 
streams or the equivalent of one hundred thousand mobile phones.  
10.2. Interconnection between IEEE standards 
Future wireless networks aim to provide a universal ubiquitous 
coverage across different radio technologies through a multi-modal 
Mobile Node (MN), while offering a rich range of services with 
variable bandwidth and Quality of Service (QoS) anytime and 
anywhere. These features require connectivity across multiple 
networks with different radio technologies, over different geographic 
areas, with access to different types of services. Such connectivity can 
be provided by the 4G architecture which envisions highly flexible 
and adaptive integration of diverse radio technologies to support built-
in capabilities for seamless interaction in these environments. 
Nevertheless, the integration of heterogeneous networks poses 
many challenges such as interface selection, seamless handover 
mechanisms, coordinated configuration of QoS mechanisms and 
content adaptation strategies. Any mobile system in such integrated 
networks has to be able to adapt to changing access networks and 
changing environments automatically without bothering humans to 
intervene for making mobile computing feasible. To adapt to such  
 

WRAN and Interconnection     217 
changes, the system needs information about the environment, 
including various pieces of information about the access network 
itself, information about services supported by this network, as well as 
more general information about the current context in which the 
mobile entity resides. Thus, a framework for gathering and processing 
information is needed. 
The evolving IEEE 802.21 standard defines a framework intended 
to improve the handover decisions of mobile devices based on mainly 
lower-layer information from both mobile devices and the access 
network. Such information is provided by defining an abstraction 
layer called Media Independent Handover (MIH). MIH is used for 
handover optimization, particularly between heterogeneous networks. 
The increased need for intelligence in such environments is behind 
our motivation to introduce autonomic networking. This is because 
future networks are expected to embrace the heterogeneity arising 
from the different network control technologies such that it appears 
homogenous to the potential users. Therefore, next-generation 
networks are expected to be self-managed in order to treat 
automatically network composition and reconfiguration. In this 
chapter, we address the main issues that arise while implementing the 
interworking mechanisms between different radio access networks. 
We provide an interworking mechanism based on the IEEE 802.21 
framework, which will be described in detail. 
10.2.1. IEEE 802.21 framework 
The design of the IEEE 802.21 framework is intended to enable 
seamless handover and interoperability between heterogeneous 
network types including both 802 and non-802 networks. This is done 
by introducing a new layer specified by MIHF which provides three 
main functionalities: media independent events service (MIES), media 
independent command service (MICS) and media independent 
information service (MIIS). 

218     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
10.2.2. IEEE 802.21 core architecture 
The heart of the IEEE 802.21 framework is the Media Independent 
Handover Functions (MIHFs), which provide abstracted services to 
higher layers by means of a unified interface. This unified interface 
exposes service primitives that are independent of the access 
technology, and called Service Access Point (SAP). Figure 10.1 
illustrates an example showing how the MIHF communicates with 
access-specific lower layer MAC and PHY components, including 
802.16, 802.11 and cellular networks, using lower layer interfaces, 
and with upper layer entities. The services provided by MIHF are 
described as follows: 
 
Figure 10.1. IEEE 802.21 framework 
– Media independent event service: the event service is used to 
facilitate handover detection. Events inform the condition of the  
 
 
 

WRAN and Interconnection     219 
present network and transmission behavior of the data links, radio 
resource management, etc. The defined events include pre-trigger (L2 
Handover Imminent), Link Available, Link Up, Link Parameter 
Change, Link Going Up, Link Down, Link Going Down, etc. 
– Media independent command service: higher layers use the 
MICS primitives to control the functions of the lower layers. MICS is 
used to gather information about the status of connected links, as well 
as to execute higher layer mobility and connectivity decisions on the 
lower layers. The MIH command can be both local and remote. These 
include commands from the upper layers to MIH and from MIH to the 
lower layers. 
– Media independent information service: as a mobile node is 
about to move out of its current network, it needs to discover the 
available neighboring networks and communicate with the elements 
within these networks so as to optimize the handover. MIIS provides a 
framework and corresponding mechanisms by which an MIHF entity 
can discover and obtain network information within a geographic area. 
MIIS primarily provides a set of information elements, the 
information structure and its representation as well as query/response 
type mechanism. The information service provides access to both 
static information and dynamic information. 
The MIH can be considered as a middleware at the link layer level 
in the components of network that control the mobility and the mobile 
device. Such a middleware provides functions to higher layer level. 
MIH extends the MIP since it can treat the information of layer 2, 
especially information concerning the status of the network and the 
use of the multiple technological interfaces. For doing so, the standard 
uses the triggers in multiple layers and proposes a 2.5 sublayer with an 
optimization of handover for the mobility in heterogeneous 
interconnected networks. 
IEEE 802.21 also provides the intelligence in the link layer and all 
information concerning the network to the higher layers in order to 
optimize the handover among the heterogeneous medium. The 
standard can support the handover for stationary and mobile users. For 
the mobile user, the handover can occur when the wireless condition 

220     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
channel changes. While handover for stationary users occurs when 
users prefer to use another type of network which has, for example, 
lower load, better QoS, etc. 
IEEE 802.21 supports a cooperative usage of mobile users and also 
the network infrastructure. The mobile user is capable of detecting the 
available network, and the infrastructure may store information 
demanded by that network, such as the list of cells in the 
neighborhood and the localization of mobile equipment. In general, 
the equipment of the client and the points of attachment (Access point 
in WiFi or Base Station in WiMAX) may support a multimodal 
interface and in some case, it can support more than one interface 
simultaneously.

Internet of Things 
The Internet of Things started with the idea of connecting to the 
Internet wireless and wired sensors found in the home, in the office 
and everywhere in daily life. Then, a major contribution was 
generated by Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The Internet of 
Things aims to connect all objects that can transmit and receive 
information.  These objects relate to terminal equipment as well as 
smart dusts, RFIDs or sensors. The concept is simple, but there are 
many problems because the “things” are generally not sophisticated 
enough to manage and control communications, and to take care of the 
associated applications. Figure 11.1 describes some different things.

224     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
We begin by examining sensor networks, RFID interfaces and 
Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, which is increasingly 
used in the connection of “things” to the Internet. Then, we will give 
some ideas about networks experiencing extremely rapid growth: 
medical sensor networks, which potentially affect billion humans and 
therefore a huge potential market. Then, we will have a look to Fog 
networking which is a Cloud solution to connect things. Finally, we 
will introduce the different solutions for connecting things to the 
Internet. 
11.1. Sensor networks 
A sensor network is defined as a set of interconnected sensors, 
each sensor being connected through a transceiver. Sensor networks 
represent a new generation of networks with specific properties, which 
do not fall under conventional architectures. However, the arrival of 
the Internet of Things has changed the vision of sensor networks, 
which can of course continue to be a closed set, but also open up the 
Internet. Sensors can be very different from each other. For example, 
quite particular sensors are from so-called smart dust. This dust, which 
is almost invisible, has radio equipment in addition to the internal 
sensor-related treatment. Other sensors are coming from the home 
environment like security, temperature control, light control, 
telecommunications, etc. 
The miniaturization of sensors poses problems of communication 
and power resources. It is necessary that the sensor is smart enough to 
gather the required information and send it wisely. In addition, the 
sensor processor should not be used too extensively in order to 
consume as little energy as possible. It must incorporate reactive 
elements rather than cognitive. Finally, to ensure a good rate, the 
transceiver range must necessarily be limited, on the order of about  
10 m. Setting up a sensor array therefore arises of routing problems, 
error control and power management. 
From the communication point of view, the IP protocol 
environment is too heavy and causes an excessive flow and 
consumption. Solutions that were derived from field bus or industrial  

Internet of Things     225 
real-time networks have a better compromise between efficiency and 
energy consumed. As hundreds of sensors may be placed per square 
meter, IPv6 addressing is a first obvious solution to the problem of 
managing addresses. However, the IP environment is heavy, and the 
implementation in these sensor networks of a protocol stack like 
TCP/IP or even UDP/IP is often impossible or is too much energy-
consuming. 
For now, the problems of security and quality of service are put 
into the background compared to consumer problems. An important 
field of research is in any case open to make effective and resilient 
sensor networks. 
We can find networks using the ZigBee radio standard, which is 
pretty good as regards energy consumption. Wibree and 6LoWPAN 
are other solutions. Wibree is a very low-energy technology in a range 
of 10 m and a flow rate of 1 Mbps. This solution was developed by 
Nokia to compete with both ZigBee and Bluetooth. Yet, it was 
integrated in Bluetooth in 2009 to produce a product called Bluetooth 
Low Energy (LE). 
The 6LoWPAN networks (IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal 
Area Networks) come from an IETF working group. The objective is 
clearly to enable continuity of the IP protocol on less powerful 
machines and with limited electric power. The use of the IPv6 
standard to obtain a very large number of addresses to large sensor 
networks is problematic. Indeed, the 16 bytes occupied by the sender 
address added to the 16 bytes of the receiver address require large 
control fields resulting in a poor utilization of the radio link to 
transport management information. This can become problematic 
because of the little power available within the sensor. ZigBee, 
however, limits the length of this frame to 127 bytes, which can also 
cause problems if the information to be transported from a sensor is 
long. 
Sensor networks can form mesh networks, and in this case they 
need a routing protocol. Using a protocol such as IEEE 802.11s 
associated with IPv6 addresses would be catastrophic for the longevity 
of the battery inside the sensors. For this reason, the current proposals 

226     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
are much simpler, with protocols like LOAD (6LoWPAN Ad-hoc 
Routing Protocol), which is a simplification of AODV routing 
scheme, 
DYMO-Low 
(Dynamic 
MANET 
On-demand 
for 
6LoWPAN), a simplification of DYMO coming from the MANET 
working group, and Hi-Low (Hierarchical Routing over 6LoWPAN), 
which has a hierarchical addressing. These proposals come from 
various protocols of the IETF standardization and thus ad-hoc 
networks, but not taking into account all options. 
Another important feature of sensor network protocols relates to 
the discovery service, which must allow starting of the network 
automatically. The IETF also plays an important role in this area by 
proposing several solutions such as LoWPAN Neighbor Discovery 
Extension. This protocol is a reduction of the standard Neighbor 
Discovery and may be applied to broadcast and multicast 
management. 
A particular sensor network is proposed by smart dust, which aims 
to develop nanotechnology sensors and link them together by an  
ad-hoc or mesh-type network. Smart dust is held in less than a cubic 
millimeter space, hence its name dust. In this dust are all the 
components necessary to realize a communicating computer: a 
processor, memory, radio, battery, etc. 
The main problem here is still saving energy when performing the 
functions of the sensor. In particular, the network portion must carry 
communications expending very little power. The University of 
Berkeley has designed an operating system and specific protocols, 
called TinyOS and Tiny protocol. The TinyOS has been written in a 
simplified C language called NESC, which is a kind of dialect 
designed to optimize memory usage. 
11.2. RFID 
RFID has been introduced to achieve the identification of objects, 
hence its other name electronic tag. Electronic tags are interrogated by 
a reader, which allows us to retrieve the identification information. 

Internet of Things     227 
Electronic tags are used in many applications, ranging from animal 
tracking tags to the identification of different products in a store. 
There are two main types of RFID tags: passive tags and active 
tags. Passive tags do not have any energy resource. They are 
illuminated by a reader which provides an electromagnetic field 
sufficient to generate an electric current for transmission by a radio 
wave of the bits stored in a memory constituting the EEPROM RFID. 
A passive tag is shown in Figure 11.2. The antenna must have an 
architecture that enables it to receive the electromagnetic field of the 
reader and make this identity. 
 
Figure 11.2. Passive RFID 
A passive RFID can be very small. The necessary equipment is 
limited, the size of one-tenth of a millimeter is sufficient. The price of 
an electronic tag depends on the number of items manufactured in a 
single pass. It is possible to a cost of go down to a cost of five cents. 
Active RFID tags have a power source in the component. The first 
major advantage of these tags is the quality of the transmission. A 
session can be opened between the reader and the RFID so that a 
retransmission can be carried out automatically in case of problems. 
Another advantage is the transmission with a range of several meters 
between the RFID and the reader, instead of a few centimeters. A  
 

228     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
disadvantage may be the lifetime of the battery. However, for standard 
use of some readings per day, it is possible to exceed 5 years. Active 
RFID can have more memory for storage of attributes associated with 
the value of identity. An active RFID is shown in Figure 11.3. 
 
Figure 11.3. Active RFID 
11.2.1. Using RFID 
A well-known application of RFID is the electronic passport. The 
electronic passport is defined in the document International Civil 
Aviation Organization 9303 Part 1, Volumes 1 and 2 (6th edition, 
2006). The electronic tag component contains information that is 
printed on the passport itself and a digitized photograph of the 
passport owner. 
Transport titles form a second application of RFID. For example, a 
large number of metro or subway tickets contain an electronic tag that 
stores a set of information including the date and place of purchase. 
More sophisticated solutions are implemented in some public 
transportations, where the label becomes active and allows use of the 
same ticket several times. 
Highway toll barriers also use this solution of active RFIDs, with 
ranges of a few meters. The active tag subtracts the toll from the 
amount of money stored in the memory. Similarly, toll gates to the 
lifts in many ski resorts use active RFID. 
 

Internet of Things     229 
Another fairly immediate application is the monitoring of cars to 
detect stolen cars when passing near a reader. Finally, one of the most 
popular applications concerns inventories and purchases in shops. 
Inventories can be performed more often and with less error. 
Purchases placed in a basket can similarly be read by the reader. This 
provides a great simplification in the procedure for payment of 
purchases at a store. 
The frequencies of transmissions of the RFID are shown in  
Table 11.1. They are determined by local or regional standardization 
bodies.

11.2.2. EPC global 
RFID aims to give the object an identity to which they are backed. 
Standardization of this identification was carried out by the EPC global 
consortium. Two generations are available: EPC Gen1 and EPC Gen2. 
We will focus especially on this second generation released mid-2006, 
which has allowed the RFID to become an industrial technique. 
EPC Gen2 is the acronym for UHF EPC global Class1 Generation 
2. This specification was released in its version 1.1 in May 2006. The 
solution supports the protocol between the reader, on the one hand, 
and RFID and identification, on the other hand. The objective of the 
protocol is to read, write and kill an RFID under the condition that 
readers sold by any supplier are interchangeable. 

230     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The reading procedure is defined using a system based on time 
slots (slots) provided with a collision avoidance system. Indeed, a 
player can simultaneously turn on a large number of RFIDs. 
Simultaneous readings of different labels would result in collisions. A 
signaling is used to set the frequency, the encoding used (DSB-ASK, 
SSB-ASK and PR-ASK) and the flow channel. The collision 
avoidance system allows each simultaneous reading to keep only half 
of the objects that can transmit again in the next reading process. After 
a certain number of collisions, one RFID transmits successfully. The 
algorithm is designed such that each RFID is read in turn. The 
playback speed can reach 640 Kbps. 
The identity of the object is determined by the EPC global 
Electronic Product Code. The Gen1 uses 96 bits, while the Gen2 
switches to 256 bits. An example of this identification to the Gen1 is 
shown in Figures 11.4 and 11.5 which show the field identification in 
Gen2. This solution is much more complex because it uses 
intermediate filters that determine the lengths of the following fields. 
Note that the serial number password passes from 36 to 140 bits, 
allowing for a given thing to never return to 0 before thousands of 
years.

Internet of Things     231 
11.2.3. RFID security 
Security is a serious problem in the world of RFIDs. Indeed, 
reading a passive RFID can easily be done with almost any reader. 
Similarly, privacy may be undermined by the tracking and tracing of 
all that relates to an individual. Solutions are available, such as 
encryption of the identifier in the label or a change in the value of the 
label after each reading. These solutions are based on a middleware 
capable of interpreting the labels’ values or tracking changes in value. 
Active tags can open an authentication session for an exchange 
with the reader, which then acts as an authentication server. In this 
case, an electronic circuit in the tag must be able to encrypt a text 
issued by the authentication server. However, the key length is so 
small that the possibility of breaking after a series of authentication 
attempts is not negligible. Many proposals have been carried out using 
the anti-collision algorithm which allows us to serialize reading labels, 
for authentication. 
11.2.4. Mifare 
Mifare is the most widespread of contactless smart cards, with four 
billion cards in circulation in the world. The name comes from the 
company that created the card: Mikron. The name of the card was 
Mikron FARE. Mikron was acquired by Philips, which transferred 
ownership of this technology to its subsidiary NXP. There are two 
subtypes of Mifare cards: Mifare Classic, which uses only part of the 
commands of Mifare, and the NXP card, which implements the entire 
set of commands. 
The cards communicate with a reader at a distance of less than 3 
cm. This gives some security to the communications, which remain 
localized. However, attacks were carried out by very specific readers 
placed a few meters away. To be sure of the communication, it is 
better to encrypt data before transmission. 
 

232     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
These cards are not very powerful in order to keep the cost to an 
extremely low level. Mifare Classic has a serial number of 4 or 7 bytes 
and 512 bytes of memory storage up to 4 Kbytes. The cheapest 
version is the Mifare Ultralight, which generally serves as a ticket. 
Mifare T are cards using secure elements of the same type as a 
contact smart card and generally perform the same type of service. 
The most advanced is the DESfire Mifare card, which has a larger 
storage memory and an advanced operating system, as well as an AES 
and 3DES encryption. 
Mifare cards are used for many applications. The most common 
applications use a serial number, which triggers an action if that 
number is accepted by the reader. This action can be, for example, the 
reading of an identifier stored in the card or data storage. For the first 
application, we can use a number of 4 or 7 bytes. In the second 
application, the identifier must be inserted. The identifier may be 
encrypted as long as the tag has a secure element capable of 
performing cryptographic calculations. 
11.3. Near-field communication 
The NFC standard is a particular case of RFID communication. It 
enables us to communicate with a RFID reader at a distance of about 3 
cm. This is a contactless communication with, for example, a smart 
card or a secure microcontroller. 
Applications of this type are many and varied. The most classic is 
payment on mobile phones. With this mobile, a customer can recharge 
his or her account by a phone call or a low-speed data transfer to a 
server. Once the account is recharged, the mobile is a key to pay for a 
range of services. To use the Metro, for example, the client has just to 
move the mobile near the receiver to validate the radio communication 
for buying the ticket. 
 

Internet of Things     233 
The flow rates of NFC communications are quite low: 106, 212, 
424 and 848 Kbps. The frequency range corresponds to 13.56 MHz. 
The standards are derived from the ISO/IEC. The NFC Forum was 
created by Philips and Sony. 
The security of the communication is ensured by the very small 
distance between the transmitter and the receiver and by the presence 
of the smart card. However, despite the distance of 3 cm, attacks were 
carried out in 2012 to listen to the NFC interface remotely. Therefore, 
it is advisable to encrypt the communication. 
11.3.1. Mobile key 
Car, home or hotel doors need keys that can be included in a 
smartphone as mobile keys. One advantage of these keys is that they 
are mobile and can be transmitted. A friend who is waiting outside 
your door can recover the key through an Internet connection. In the 
same way, mobile keys can simplify the distribution of keys for a car 
rental company. We will describe such an application through the 
opening of a hotel room by a smartphone. 
Mobile keys can be stored on a secure server in a datacenter or in 
the Cloud. The smartphone, using a secure microcontroller, can store 
the key. Finally, the door of the room is an NFC lock. So, we have the 
environment depicted in Figure 11.6. 
 
Figure 11.6. The key to the mobile environment 
 
TLS

234     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
First, the room is booked through the smartphone. As indicated 
above, the smartphone must contain a secure element, that is to say, a 
location that cannot be accessed from the outside. The secure element 
can be of different types depending on the nature of the device 
(smartphone, laptop or tablet PC). This may be a SIM card from an 
operator, but the security provider must have the permission to add 
software to the smartcard. The secure element can also be an 
embedded SIM card, which is the equivalent of an operator SIM card 
but embedded in the smartphone by the manufacturer of the 
smartphone. This is mostly a NXP component. The secure element 
can also be embedded in a memory card (for example, an SD card). 
Finally, as shown in Figure 11.6, the secure element can be an 
intermediate smartcard (for example, a loyalty card of a hotel chain or 
an airline company) that communicates with the mobile through the 
NFC interface. The smartphone is seen as a modem allowing the 
external smartcard to communicate with the server where the keys are 
stored. This server is generally in the Cloud. The NFC door may be 
opened by the mobile key retrieved on the smartphone or the external 
NFC card. 
Upon arrival in the vicinity of the hotel, detected by the GPS of the 
smartphone, the hotel transfers the key of the room into the secure 
element of the smartphone or directly into the external NFC 
smartcard. Then, the smartphone has to be moved close to the lock of 
the door to open it. 
11.3.2. NFC payment 
In early 2014, the number of contactless bank smartcards 
represented approximately 20% of the total in countries using 
smartcards for banking. This represents several hundred million 
smartcards. Similarly, 20% of smartphones have an NFC chip. Before 
the arrival of NFC, other payment systems had been tried, such as 
payment by SMS, direct payment model and different solutions using 
WAP technology. 
Under the NFC, the mobile must be moved a few centimeters from 
the payment terminal. Two main areas have been set up for this 

Internet of Things     235 
prepayment and direct payment. In the first case, the terminal is seen 
as an electronic wallet: for each transaction, money is taken from the 
wallet. Payment for a very low maximum amount can be compared to 
the first axis. The second case requires more security since payment is 
made directly for the account of the user, for sums that are far greater 
generally. There are four possible models for mobile payments: 
– Operator-centric model: the mobile operator deploys only its 
mobile payment services. It must provide for this independent mobile 
wallet account for the user. This case is unusual because the operators 
are not related to the major international payment networks. Mobile 
network operators must manage the interface with the banking 
network to provide advanced services to mobile payment. Pilots using 
this model have been launched in developing countries, but they cover 
only a small part of the many use cases of mobile payment services. 
Payments are generally limited to a transfer or modest sums. 
– Bank-centric model: the bank deploys mobile payment 
applications associated with client devices and requires merchants to 
possess the equipment required to fulfill the sales. Mobile network 
operators are used as the transport network, with the quality of service 
and security required for payment functions. 
– Collaboration model: this model involves collaboration between 
banks, mobile operators and a trusted third party. 
– Peer-to-peer model: the mobile payment service provider acts 
independently of financial institutions and mobile network operators. 
Google, PayPal, GlobalPay, etc., use a Cloud-based approach to 
make a mobile payment. This approach places the mobile payment 
provider in the middle of the operation, which involves two separate 
steps. First, a payment method associated with the cloud is selected 
and the payment is authorized via NFC. At this stage, the payment 
provider automatically covers the cost of purchases. In the second 
stage, another transaction is necessary: the payment provider must 
refund the payment and fees from the bank of the user. 

236     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
11.3.3. The Internet of Things in a medical environment 
The Medical Internet is booming, with 7 billion people to 
accompany, diagnose and treat. The ultimate idea is to continuously 
monitor individuals to advise or alert them to problems detected 
through a sensor. Every human being will in the future be connected 
continuously to a Cloud, which will analyze the data from the sensors 
disposed within and on the body surface. The power of the Cloud will 
allow us to analyze, compare and diagnose the data set stored. 
Essential features in this universe are security, privacy, that is to say, 
data privacy, and very low power consumption of the sensors, which 
must operate for months without the need to change the batteries. This 
environment is being set up gradually. We are going to describe the 
main advances from the network point of view. 
The first element to develop relates to the adaptation of the sensors 
to the body through the body area network (BAN). An example of a 
BAN is depicted in Figure 11.7. 
 
Figure 11.7. A BAN (body area network) 

Internet of Things     237 
It is the IEEE 802.15.6 working group that deals with 
normalization. The main standards cover several frequencies and 
several technologies: 
– 402–405<MHz for In-In-Out communications, that is to say, 
internal to the body and from the inside to the body surface; 
– Ultra Wide Band (UWB), which operates on the 2.4 GHz and 
3.1–10.6 GHz bands. UWB was described in Chapter 7; 
– between 15 and 50 MHz for communications internal to the 
body; 
– Human Body Communications, which operates at 13.5, 400, 600 
and 900 MHz for communication with the body surface. This 
communication uses the conductivity of the human body. The 
intensity of the electric current is extremely small, of the order of a 
nanoampere. 
To interconnect the BAN networks with the Cloud, several 
solutions are considered: either by LTE, or 4G, or a new generation of 
WiFi network: the FCC wants to develop a specific band for medical 
WiFi. But this new WiFi must ensure a security much stricter than the 
current WiFi security. The bandwidth is 40 MHz with a very low 
power consumption technology. The band for such external 
connections would be between 2,360 and 2,400 MHz, i.e. just below 
the current WiFi band. 
Other research, which is progressing well, concerns the use of 
embedded sensors in “smart dust” capable of circulating in the blood. 
Analyses are regularly transmitted to external sensors, which 
themselves transmit the data to the Cloud. 
11.4. The Internet of Things in the home 
The home is a place where there are a large number of very 
different sensors from different backgrounds: information technology, 
telecommunications, medicine and electronics. We see, for example, 
Internet beds that have sensors capable of detecting movements and 
words during the night in order to establish a sleep diagnosis. Doors, 

238     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
household appliances items, security systems, etc., are themselves 
increasingly filled with diverse and varied sensors. Another example 
comes from the presence sensors that detect whether someone is in a 
room or not to shut down or automatically turn on the lights. A 
forecast predicts a hundred sensors per home by around 2020. 
A major battle is engaged to determine the connection technology 
to be used by all these sensors in the home. The basic network is 
Ethernet, wired or WiFi. As a result, most of the equipment will be 
connected by an Ethernet jack or through a WiFi card. Connections 
can also use Bluetooth, 6LoWPAN, ZigBee and NFC. A 
communications controller should allow us to customize all 
connections in ensuring adequate security, availability, reasonable 
energy consumption and the lowest possible cost. 
The problem comes from the next generation of Home Gateway, 
which pushes the management of IP in the end machine. For TVs, 
phones and other devices rather important, the presence of an IP 
component does not pose a problem: that is what we find in IPTV and 
IP telephony. However, for a sensor or a very inexpensive device, it is 
either impossible or too costly to introduce an IP component and to 
have an intermediate machine such as a controller. The controller can 
also be integrated into the Home Gateway.  
In conclusion, the home contains a large number of “things” that 
can be connected. The Home Gateway is an essential piece of 
equipment because it can manage, possibly via a controller, not only 
communication, but also security and QoS for the home. 
11.5. Fog networking 
The Fog extends the Cloud to be closer to the things that produce 
and act on IoT data (Figure 11.8). These devices, called fog nodes, can 
be deployed anywhere with a network connection: on a factory floor, 
on top of a power line, alongside a railway track, in a vehicle or on an 
oil rig. Any device with computing, storage and network connectivity 
can be a fog node. Examples include industrial controllers, switches, 
routers, embedded servers and video surveillance cameras. 

Internet of Things     239 
The most time sensitive data are analyzed on the fog node closest 
to the things generating the data. In a Cisco Smart Grid distribution 
network, for example, the most time sensitive requirement is to verify 
that protection and control loops are operating properly. Therefore, the 
fog nodes closest to the grid sensors can look for signs of problems 
and then prevent them by sending control commands to actuators. 
Data that can wait seconds or minutes for action are passed along 
to an aggregation node for analysis and action. In the Smart Grid 
example, each substation might have its own aggregation node that 
reports the operational status of each downstream feeder and lateral.  
Data that are less time sensitive are sent to the Cloud for historical 
analysis, big data analytics and long-term storage (see sidebar). For 
example, each of thousands or hundreds of thousands of fog nodes 
might send periodic summaries of grid data to the Cloud for historical 
analysis and storage. 
Figure 11.8. Architecture of the Fog networking 

240     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
 
Figure 11.9. Fog networking 
Fog computing gives the Cloud a companion to handle the two 
exabytes of data generated daily from the Internet of Things. 
Processing data closer to where it is produced and needed solves the 
challenges of exploding data volume, variety and velocity. 
Fog computing accelerates awareness and response to events by 
eliminating a round trip to the Cloud for analysis. It avoids the need 
for costly bandwidth additions by offloading gigabytes of network 
traffic from the core network. It also protects sensitive IoT data by 
analyzing it inside company walls. Ultimately, organizations that 
adopt Fog computing gain deeper and faster insights, leading to 
increased business agility, higher service levels and improved safety. 
11.6. Connection of things 
The connection of things is an excellent business. Indeed, forecasts 
announce 100 billons things will be connected by 2022, representing 
100 B$ by counting a connection at 1 $ a year. Different solutions are 
commercialized or almost commercialized: the WPAN and WLAN 
technology for the Internet of Things such as the IEEE 802.11ad 
(WiGig) or the IEEE 802.11ah. A second solution is coming from 
specific proprietary solutions. The most well-known is SIGFOX. The 
SIGFOX solution is presented below. Another solution is provided by 
telecommunication operators adding narrowband solutions to their 
antennas. We are going to present these different solutions. 

Internet of Things     241 
11.6.1. Specific proprietary solution: SIGFOX example 
The SIGFOX network technology allows for a very long range 
between objects and transceivers, which enables the network to easily 
cover large areas and reach underground objects. The SIGFOX 
technology allows for better penetration than traditional cellular 
networks such as GSM, while still ensuring high reliability and 
radically lower energy consumption. The SIGFOX network operates 
in the unlicensed ISM radio bands. The exact frequencies can vary 
depending on national regulations. The different bands are described 
in Figure 8.14. 
In order for an object to send messages using SIGFOX, it needs to 
integrate a compatible and certified modem. The SIGFOX modems 
are based on standard hardware chips on which the SIGFOX software 
stack is installed. SIGFOX uses a patented radio technology based on 
what is referred to as Ultra Narrow-Band (UNB). The SIGFOX UNB 
radio communication uses the ISM bands, which are free to use 
without the need to acquire licenses, to transmit data over a very 
narrow spectrum to and from connected objects. 
The SIGFOX network is not targeting specific industries and can 
be used in virtually any context in which there is a need for a low 
throughput connectivity solution. The definition of low throughput on 
the SIGFOX network can be characterized as follows:  
– up to 140 messages per object per day; 
– payload size for each message is 12 bytes; 
– wireless throughput up to 100 bits per second. 
In its current state, each SIGFOX base station can handle up to a 
million connected objects, but the network is easily scalable to handle 
more objects, by simply increasing the density of base stations. The 
density of the cells is based on an average range of about 30–50 km in 
rural areas and 3–10 km for urban areas. Distances can be much 
higher for outdoor objects where messages can be in line of sight. 

242     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
11.6.2. LoRa 
LoRa is the usual name to describe a solution provided by 
telecommunication operators to enter the Internet of Things. LoRa 
gains its name from the fact that this solution is able to provide Long 
Range communications using very low power levels. Indeed, 
LoRaWAN defines the communication protocol and system 
architecture for the network, while the LoRa physical layer enables the 
long-range communication link.  
The protocol and network architecture have the most influence in 
determining the battery lifetime of a node, the network capacity, the 
Quality of Service, the security and the variety of applications served 
by the network. We describe in Figure 11.10 the LoRa architecture 
and in Figure 11.11 the LoRa network. 
 
Figure 11.10. The LoRa architecture 
End-devices serve different applications and have different 
requirements. In order to optimize a variety of end application 
profiles, LoRaWAN utilizes different device classes. The device 
classes trade off network downlink communication latency versus 
battery lifetime. In a control or actuator-type application, the downlink 
communication latency is an important factor. The three classes are 
depicted in Figure 11.12.

Figure 11.12. The three classes of LoRa 
LoRa is the physical layer of the wireless modulation utilized to 
create a long range communication link. Many legacy wireless 
systems use frequency shifting keying (FSK) modulation as the 
physical layer because it is a very efficient modulation for achieving 
low power. LoRa is based on chirp spread spectrum modulation, 
which maintains the same low power characteristics as FSK 
modulation but significantly increases the communication range.

Chirp spread spectrum has been used in military and space 
communication for decades due to the long communication distances 
that can be achieved and its robustness to interference, but LoRa is the 
first low cost implementation for commercial usage.  
The advantage of LoRa is in the technology’s long range 
capability. A single gateway or base station can cover entire cities or 
hundreds of square kilometers. Range highly depends on the 
environment or obstructions in a given area, but LoRa and LoRaWAN 
have a link budget greater than any other standardized communication 
technology. The link budget, typically given in decibels (dB), is the 
primary factor in determining the range in a given environment. With 
a minimal amount of infrastructure, entire countries can easily be 
covered.  
Let us present a little bit more detail on the European and 
American solution using to different parts of the spectrum as shown in 
Figure 11.13. 
Figure 11.13. The ISM band 
LoRaWAN for Europe defines 10 channels, eight of which are 
multi data rate from 250 bps to 5.5 kbps, a single high data rate LoRa 
channel at 11 kbps, and a single FSK channel at 50 kbps. For  
North America, the ISM band is from 902 to 928 MHz. LoRaWAN 
defines 64, 125 KHz uplink channels from 902.3 to 914.9 MHz in  
200 KHz increments. There are an additional eight 500 KHz uplink 
channels in 1.6 MHz increments from 903 to 914.9 MHz. The eight 
downlink channels are 500 KHz wide starting from 923.3 to 
927.5 MHz. 
It is extremely important to incorporate security in a LoRa 
network. LoRaWAN utilizes two layers of security: one for the

network and one for the application. The network security ensures 
authenticity of the node in the network, while the application layer of 
security ensures the network operator does not have access to the end 
user’s application data. AES encryption is used with the key exchange 
utilizing an IEEE EUI64 identifier. This is shown in Figure 11.14. 
As a conclusion to this section, we show the global architecture of 
the LoRa solution in Figure 11.14.

11.7. Conclusion 
The Internet of Things is becoming a reality due to RFIDs and 
sensors. The integration of these tiny devices is far from complete, as 
they are not powerful enough to support the TCP/IP protocol. To get 
there, very specific gateways have to be developed, which may 
include, on the one side, the connected things and, on the other side, 
the Internet.

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks 
Radio networks with relay refer to communications that pass 
through intermediate equipment in the radio part. The packets are 
memorized and processed before retransmission to another device, 
always over the air. These networks are also referred to as multi-hop 
networks. When the relays form a mesh network in which each node 
is connected to several other nodes, they are called mesh networks. 
The access points forming the mesh network can be fixed or mobile. 
These nodes form the base network, in general belonging to an 
operator or a network provider. Customers of a mesh network are 
connected on the mesh routers, usually through another access card 
available in the mesh router. In a mesh network, the customers have 
no routing software, and they are connected as a hotspot. 
An ad hoc network looks like a mesh network, except that the 
routing software is on the customer’s terminal. In other words, there is 
no specific machine in an ad hoc network: the clients form the 
network. The big drawback comes from a very strong dependency 
between routers and client devices. However, these are networks 
without infrastructure since they include only the client terminals. 
They are sometimes called “Wild networks” because they can be 
performed independently without any operator. However, it is illusory 
to think that a customer could communicate with a client in a town far 
away through intermediate nodes representing several hundreds or 
even thousands of terminals. The reason for this problem comes

from the management of routing tables, which become huge and 
highly dynamic since the client terminals move constantly. 
The standardization of ad hoc networks was carried out by the 
IETF working group MANET (Mobile Ad hoc NETwork). 
Another radio network with relay is formed by the Vehicular Ad 
hoc NETwork (VANET). These networks are rapidly expanding in the 
automotive industry. This solution allows us to connect customers to 
one another within a vehicle, the vehicle may be a bus, a train or an 
airplane. 
We have also consolidated in this chapter satellite networks using 
satellites as relays. These satellites increasingly often have even 
routing processing capabilities in satellite constellations, which allows 
us to include them in the radio networks with relays. 
12.1. Ad hoc networks 
Mobile Ad hoc NETworks (MANETs) form an important class of 
radio networks with relays. The infrastructure is composed only of the 
stations themselves playing the role of transmitter, receiver and router. 
The routing enables the passage of information from one terminal to 
another, without these terminals being connected directly. An ad hoc 
network is shown in Figure 12.1. 
 
Figure 12.1. An ad hoc network 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     249 
Contrary to appearances, ad hoc networks are quite old. They aim 
to achieve a communication environment that unfolds without any 
infrastructure other than the mobile equipment itself. In other words, 
the mobile equipment can act as a gateway to allow communication 
from one machine to another. Two pieces of mobile equipment 
moving too far away from each other to directly communicate can 
find intermediate mobile equipment able to act as a relay. The main 
problem caused by this network comes from the definition of the 
network topology: how to identify the neighboring nodes and how to 
move from one node to another node? Two extreme solutions can be 
compared. The first is that of an ad hoc network in which all nodes 
can communicate with all the others involving a long-range 
transmitter. In the second solution, instead, the radio range is as short 
as possible: in a communication between two nodes, it usually goes 
through several intermediate machines. The advantage of the first 
solution is the security of the transmission, since the communications 
can go directly from the sender to the receiver, without depending on 
an intermediate device. Network throughput is minimal: the  
frequency cannot be reused. In the second case, if a device fails or is 
turned off, the network may be cut into two separate subnetworks 
without communication to one another. Obviously, in this case, the 
overall throughput is optimized, since there may be a high-frequency 
reuse. 
The access techniques are of the same type as in mobile networks. 
However, due to the fact that all laptops are mobile, new properties 
should be made for the management of user addresses and routing 
control. 
The usual solution developed for ad hoc networks takes the IP 
environment to define the routing scheme. Mobile equipment which 
acts as a gateway – usually all mobile equipment – implements a 
router, so that the problems arising essentially depend on the Internet 
routing schemes. 
The benefits of ad hoc networks are the simple extensions, the 
physical coverage and the cost. However, a certain number of 
obstacles have to be overcome due to the mobility of nodes, 
particularly regarding the Quality of Service and security. 

250     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
MANET is an IETF working group that is concerned with the 
standardization of ad hoc protocols running IP. This group is linked on 
conventional Internet protocols and has improved them so that they 
can work with mobile routers. Two major protocol families were 
defined: reactive protocols and proactive protocols: 
– Reactive protocols. The terminals do not maintain a routing table 
but when a transmission happens a routing has to be performed. In this 
case, the scheme primarily uses flooding techniques to identify the 
mobile equipment that can participate in the transmission. 
– Proactive protocols. Mobile equipment tries to maintain a 
consistent routing table, even in the absence of communication. 
Ad hoc networks are useful in many cases. They allow us to set up 
networks within a limited period of time, in the case, for example, of 
an earthquake or during a meeting with a large number of participants 
place. Another possibility is to extend access to a cell of a wireless 
network such as WiFi. A terminal located outside of a cell can connect 
to another machine located in the cell coverage area. The latter serves 
as an intermediate router to access the antenna of the cell. 
Ad hoc networks raise many problems because of the mobility of 
all equipment. The main problem is the routing that requires us to 
forward packets from one point to another point in the network. One 
of the objectives of the MANET group is to propose a solution to this 
problem. Four major proposals have emerged, two of a reactive type 
and two of a proactive type. Among other issues, we find the safety, 
Quality of Service and mobility management during the call. 
12.2. Routing 
The main idea of an ad hoc network is that each wireless node can 
communicate directly with any other wireless node, without the use of 
any existing network infrastructure. Thus, the architecture is totally 
decentralized. Such networks are limited by the fact that each wireless 
node has to be within the transmission range of all the others, which 
involves small networks. The main problems in ad hoc networks are 
how to transmit in the air medium and how to share it. There exist two 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     251 
major link layer technologies responding to this: the IEEE 802.11 
standard and the Bluetooth specifications. 
Therefore, the architecture of an ad hoc network applies to small 
networks, due to the limited transmission range of wireless network 
interfaces. As shown in Figure 12.1, extending connectivity to a larger 
area requires a multi-hop ad hoc network architecture, in which each 
node assumes the role of a router and relays packets toward final 
destinations. Thus, network nodes cooperate to forward packets for 
each other to allow communication over multiple “hops” between 
nodes not directly within wireless transmission range of one another. 
But this characteristic is not sufficient to ensure network connectivity. 
In addition, packets must be directed through the network. In other 
words, a path has to be determined from the source to its destination. 
This is so-called routing. A simple way to perform it would be to enter 
static routes by integrating a fixed routing table in each node 
according to the topology. Obviously, as nodes in a multi-hop ad hoc 
network move about or join/leave the network and as wireless 
transmission conditions such as sources of interference change, this 
technique is not conceivable. Routing must result from a specific 
algorithm which calculates routes automatically and dynamically, that 
is to say from a multi-hop wireless ad hoc network routing protocol. 
Before presenting the standardized routing protocols in section 
12.4, we recall that multi-hop ad hoc networks have the following 
characteristics: 
– dynamic topologies: nodes, which are able to forward packets, 
can move arbitrarily. This mobility makes the topology changing 
randomly and rapidly at unpredictable times; 
– limited physical security: attacks, such as denial-of-service or 
eavesdropping, are often easier to lead in wireless networks than in 
wired ones. Ad hoc networks have at least the advantage of being 
totally decentralized; 
– omnidirectional radio transmission: packets are broadcasted to all 
neighboring nodes. Then, simultaneous data exchange between nodes 
close to each other can be impossible; 

252     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
– possible unidirectional links: because of interferences, fading or 
still limited transmission range of some wireless network interfaces, 
links can be unidirectional; 
– bandwidth and energy constraints: these resources are quite 
limited. The former due to the intrinsic properties of radio interfaces 
and the effects of multiple access, noise, etc.; the latter due to the 
characteristics of wireless mobile nodes forming the multi-hop ad hoc 
network, which often rely on batteries. Routing not only consists of 
finding a route between two nodes, the goal is to calculate an 
optimized route according to one or several constraints (number of 
hops, maximum bandwidth, minimum end-to-end delay, etc.). Not 
designed for ad hoc particularities, classical routing protocols (e.g. 
RIP and OSPF) were inapplicable. 
They had to be upgraded in order to be efficient and reliable, 
taking into account the wireless and decentralized architecture, 
reducing control traffic and managing mobility. Therefore, multi-hop 
ad hoc routing protocols present much originality, since the mobile 
nodes in the network dynamically establish routing among themselves 
to form their own network. Nevertheless, these protocols apply 
properties of classical routing schemes. Indeed, we can distinguish 
two techniques to calculate the best route: 
– distance-vector routing: each node informs (periodically and at 
topology changes) its neighbors of the estimated direction and 
distance to any other node. The cost of reaching a destination is 
computed using various route metrics. The Bellman–Ford algorithm is 
then used to calculate routes. Distance-vector routing protocols have 
low computational complexity and message overhead. On the other 
hand, the algorithm has a struggle to converge on the new topology 
when network conditions change; 
– link-state routing: each node broadcasts in the network the links 
state with its neighbors. Being acquainted with which nodes are 
connected to which other ones, every node ends by constructing a map 
of the connectivity to the network. Then, the Dijkstra algorithm 
enables us to calculate optimal routes. Instead of sharing routing 
tables with the neighborhood, nodes applying a link-state routing 
protocol flood the network only with their related connectivity. These 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     253 
two techniques, well known in wired networks with RIP and OSPF, 
are used in multi-hop ad hoc routing protocols (e.g. AODV and 
OLSR). Many other differences appear between routing protocols. For 
instance, a packet may contain in its header the complete path to 
follow in order to reach the destination (source routing) or only the 
next node to its destination (hop-by-hop). We will see that a major 
distinction in multi-hop ad hoc routing protocols concerns the time 
when a route is calculated. This defines two kinds of protocols: table-
driven and on demand protocols. 
12.2.1. Ad hoc in the link layer 
Several technologies enable ad hoc networks, both in Wireless 
Personal Area Networks (WPAN) and Wireless Local Area Networks 
(WMAN). By definition, WPANs are small networks, limited to a few 
meters, with data rates up to several hundreds of Kbit/s. As for  
WLANs, their communicating range is larger (e.g. a building) and 
they can offer in the region tens of Mbit/s. A WLAN is obviously and 
above all a LAN. Thus, in spite of wireless characteristics (e.g. 
bandwidth and energy constraints), the requirements are the same: 
high data rates, full connectivity, broadcast capability, etc. We present 
in the following the two main link layer technologies for ad hoc 
networks: the IEEE 802.11 standard for WLANs and the Bluetooth 
specifications for WPANs. As detailed in the previous section, a 
“single-hop” ad hoc network implies that all the stations are within the 
same transmission area to be able to communicate. 
The range of the network can be extended by adding network layer 
protocols, including routing mechanisms. Solutions leading to multi-
hop ad hoc networks are described in the next section. 
12.2.2. Ad hoc mode in WiFi 
Proposed in 1997, the IEEE 802.11 standard (commercially called 
WiFi, the acronym for Wireless Fidelity) defines the two first layers of 
the OSI model for a wireless local area network: the physical layer 
and the link layer. While three different physical layers are proposed, 

254     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
the link layer is unified. Indeed, to transmit data between nodes, there 
can be used either: infrared (IF) pulse position modulation, direct 
sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) or frequency-hopping spread 
spectrum (FHSS). Frequencies are in the Industrial, Scientific and 
Medical (ISM) band, ranging from 2.4000 to 2.4835 GHz. This 
standard allows data rates of equal to 1 or 2 Mbit/s. It was then 
extended by several task groups, which are designated by letters. In 
1999, the extensions IEEE 802.11a and IEEE 802.11b were proposed 
in order to improve data rates: up to 54 Mbit/s in the 5 GHz band for 
the former and up to 5.5 or 11 Mbit/s in the 2.4 GHz band for the 
latter (with backward compatibility). In 2003, the IEEE802.11g 
extended the IEEE 802.11b to support 54 Mbit/s in the 2.4 GHz band, 
by applying the same OFDM-based transmission scheme as IEEE 
802.11a. Nowadays, there exist around 30 amendments, offering 
higher throughput, security services, handover capabilities, etc. Two 
operational modes are specified in the standard: 
– infrastructure-based mode: in this mode, all the communications 
between nodes have to go by a specific node: the Access Point (AP). 
The network area is then determined by the transmission range of the 
AP. The set of nodes around the AP is called the Basic Service Set 
(BSS). To extend the network, it is possible to merge several BSSs. 
For this, the AP can be connected to another AP, generally with a 
wired network such as Ethernet; 
– ad hoc mode: no AP is required in this mode, the network being 
totally distributed. Nodes can communicate if they are within their 
respective transmission range. They constitute an Independent Basic 
Service Set (IBSS). Moreover, the Medium Access Control (MAC) 
layer of the IEEE 802.11 standard defines a contention-free service, 
called the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) and based on a 
multiple access method. As an optional access method, the standard 
defines the Point Coordination Function (PCF), implemented on top of 
the DCF and based on a polling scheme. Since there is no central 
authority to act as a point coordinator in ad hoc networks, the PCF 
cannot be readily applied in such environments. 
In the DCF mode, a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision 
Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is used. Hence, to transmit a packet, a node 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     255 
has to first listen to the channel. If it is idle, then the node can send its 
packet. Otherwise, that is to say if the node senses energy above a 
specific threshold on the medium, the transmission is deferred for a 
random interval, reducing the probability of collisions on the channel. 
More precisely, when the current transmission ends, the node wanting 
access waits a Distributed Inter-Frame Spacing (DIFS) before 
choosing a random backoff value. Then, this value is decremented 
only when the channel is idle. As soon as the value reaches zero, the 
node sends its packet. Despite this mechanism, collisions may occur. 
Contrary to the CSMA/CD used in the IEEE 802.3 standard, collision 
detection is not feasible in the IEEE 802.11 standard, due to the 
unique antenna. This hinders the node from sending and receiving 
simultaneously. Collisions are then detected in oblique ways: to 
confirm the correct reception of information, acknowledgment (ACK) 
packets are sent from the receiver to the sender. In order to send the 
ACK just after the received packet, another interframe spacing is 
defined: the Short Inter-Frame Spacing (SIFS). This one being shorter 
than the DIFS, ACKs are sent as a priority, preceding any other packet 
transmission. 
Another problem occurs in wireless networks: the hidden node 
problem. Indeed, let us consider Figure 12.2 where node C wants to 
transmit a packet to node B, which is already receiving a packet from 
node A. As C and A are not within the transmission range of each 
other, when node C applies the CSMA protocol and so listens to the 
channel, it cannot detect the transmission between A and B. This 
creates a collision, scrambling data. 
 
Figure 12.2.  Hidden node (1) and exposed node (2) problems 

256     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
To solve this problem, the physical carrier sensing mechanism of 
CSMA can optionally be supplemented by an additional mechanism, a 
virtual carrier-sensing one based on the exchange of Request To Send 
(RTS) and Clear To Send (CTS) packets between the sender and the 
intended receiver. The IEEE 802.11 RTS/CTS exchange is defined as 
follows: before sending packets, the source sends to the intended 
receiver a short packet, named RTS. If the RTS packet is well 
transmitted, the receiver replies (after a SIFS) by another short packet, 
named CTS. Then, the source knows that the destination is ready to 
receive the data frame. Information contained in both the RTS and 
CTS packets is the identity of the requesting node, this of the intended 
receiver and the total duration of the transmission, that is the time 
interval needed to transmit the RTS and CTS packets, the data frame 
and the related acknowledgment. Therefore, all the nodes within the 
transmission range of either the source or the destination know the 
overall time interval of the coming transmission. It is important to 
note that this mechanism partly overcomes the hidden node problem. 
Moreover, RTS/CTS may decrease throughput. This is the reason why 
an RTS threshold can be adjusted in order to apply this technique only 
for large data frame transmissions that are those considerably reducing 
network performances when collisions occur. 
Another technique consisting of increasing the transmitting power 
of the nodes could solve the problem. Indeed, this enables the nodes to 
hear the hidden ones, which are no longer hidden. Unfortunately, this 
technique amplifies another well-known problem in wireless 
networks: the exposed node problem. As shown in Figure 12.2, when 
B is transmitting to node A, even if C wants to send packets to D (a 
transmission that would not cause a collision at A), the CSMA 
protocol hinders node C from transmitting, reducing throughput. 
12.2.3. Bluetooth link layer 
Bluetooth technology was introduced in 1998 by a specific 
working group, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), including 
industry-leading companies such as Ericsson, Intel, Nokia, Toshiba, 
3Com and Motorola. These specifications have been resumed and  
 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     257 
extended by the IEEE 802.15 working group, in charge of developing 
a family of communications standards for WPANs. The goal of this 
technology was a wireless communication system based on short-
range radio at low-cost. The application field was clearly the PANs by 
making feasible wireless ad hoc transmissions between different 
equipment such as laptops, printers, keyboards, cellular phones, 
wireless handhelds, car radios, etc. Several Bluetooth specification 
versions have been released since the original one (version 1.0A) in 
1999. The Bluetooth specification defines the lowest layers, especially 
the radio and the baseband ones. The radio layer defines how to 
transmit data over the air medium. Bluetooth technology operates in 
the 2.4 GHz ISM band, employs a fast frequency hopping spread 
spectrum (FHSS) radio technique and uses a binary Gaussian 
frequency-shift keying (GFSK) modulation. These techniques enable 
very low-cost implementations. The baseband defines how Bluetooth 
devices can communicate with each other. A Bluetooth network is 
formed in an ad hoc manner (without any infrastructure assistance). 
The basic single-hop ad hoc network is named a piconet in the 
Bluetooth parlance. The transmission range of a specific Bluetooth 
device depends on the transmission power. Three classes are defined: 
class 1 (100 mW), class 2 (2.5 mW) and class 3 (1 mW) radios. The 
network area spreads from 1 to 100 m, according to the transmit 
power class. 
During the piconet establishment, one node is designated master 
and the other nodes slaves. A piconet contains at most seven active 
slaves (actively involved in communications). A node that is not the 
master or an active slave is either parked if it is registered with the 
master or in stand-by mode if it does not belong to a piconet. The role 
of the master is to arrange transmissions in the piconet, by polling the 
slaves. Hence, a slave can deliver a packet only if it has received 
authorization from the master. Moreover, all transmissions have to go 
by the master, even if the data exchange is between two slaves. A 
locally unique Active Member Address (AM ADDR) is assigned to 
each active slave by the master, in order to identify them. 
To communicate, all the nodes belonging to a given piconet are 
synchronized to the same channel, which is defined as the sequence of 
the frequency hops followed (up to 1,600 per second). Indeed, 

258     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
transmissions are made on a slotted scheme. The duration of a basic 
slot is equal to 625 μs. During a slot, the carrier frequency remains 
unchanged. Frequency hopping occurs at the end of the slot. However, 
when a packet occupies multiple slots (three or five), no frequency 
change is applied. When hopping resumes, the next frequency is the 
same as the one that would have been chosen in single slot 
transmissions. According to the Bluetooth clock of the master, slots in 
a piconet are even or odd. The master and the slaves alternate 
transmissions in a Time Division Duplex (TDD) manner, the even 
slots are used by the master and the odd ones are used by the active 
slaves, knowing that a slave can transmit only if it has just received a 
poll packet from the master. A slave may belong to several piconets. 
In this way, multi-hop ad hoc networks can be created. Such  
a Bluetooth network, interconnecting several piconets, is called a 
scatternet. More precisely, a slave can be temporary separated from a 
piconet to become the slave of another one, and then come back to the 
initial situation. A slave can also become the master of another 
piconet. These situations are illustrated in Figure 12.3. Several 
solutions are proposed in the literature in order to form a scatternet. 
 
Figure 12.3. Example of a Bluetooth scatternet 
12.3. Ad hoc routing protocols 
Routing consists of finding a set of links which allow the transfer 
of the information from a source point to a destination. In ad hoc 
networks, links are mostly radio interfaces connecting two mobile 
nodes. The use of radio interface and mobile nodes makes the routing 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     259 
harder than in fixed networks because of many problems such as 
interferences, dynamicity, non-symmetric links, narrow band 
resources, non-deterministic access, etc. 
For those reasons, applying the same routing protocols created for 
the IP networks is not possible and may create hard problems such as 
delivery divergence, high delay and small delivery rate of the 
information. A huge number of studies were done for creating or 
adapting protocols for ad hoc environments. Those protocols are 
divided into three sets: reactive, proactive and hybrid. The reactive 
protocols minimize the number of exchanged control information 
when nodes are idle and no traffic is active. They react only when a 
node decides to send information and at that time, the network starts a 
route discovery process that could be very expensive in terms of 
resources. On the contrary, proactive protocols exchange control 
information periodically in order to maintain information on the 
network topology and having information on routes for all the 
destinations. Finally, the hybrid protocols are a mixture of reactive 
and proactive. 
At the IETF standardization process, the MANET working group 
was created in order to provide RFC documents on a reference 
protocol and the result was four experimental standards: two reactive 
(DSR and AODV) and two proactive (OLSR and TBRPF). Phase 2 
was initiated and works are in progress to evaluate the reactive 
protocols toward one single protocol named DYMO and the proactive 
protocols toward one another single protocol which is OLSRV2. 
The military was probably the first to require the use of ad hoc 
networks. Military operations are often very dynamic in nature and 
cannot be in most cases based on a fixed and pre-existing 
infrastructure. Communications between the various entities of a 
transaction will often be on a wireless while having no knowledge of 
the network formed by these entities. 
The US Department of Defense was quickly involved in projects of 
advanced research and development in areas such as communication 
networks required by the military applications. In 1973, The Defense 
Advanced Research Agency, established by the U.S. Department of 

260     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
Defense, initiated a research project on the technique of packet 
switching in wireless environments. This request is motivated by the 
need to provide network access to mobile entities and to establish 
communications in a mobile environment. The project would be based 
on the packet radio transmission developed at the University of 
Hawaii in the ALOHA project in the 1970s. Initially, the system could 
send data packets using radio to reach destinations located on one hop 
distance. The development of packet radio network (called later 
PRNet – Packet Radio Network) has enabled the radio multi-hop over 
an extensive geographic area. In Figure 12.4, the PRs represent nodes 
which are connected by radiolinks. All PRs can communicate  
directly by radio (Figure 12.4(a)) or by using intermediate PRs  
(Figure 12.4(b)). The latter is called multi-hop communications. If, for 
example, a communication must pass by three radio links, one speaks 
of a three hop. 
  
Figure 12.4. Examples of PR-network 
The PRNet is the basis of ad hoc networks. The reader will find a 
complete description of packet radio networks in MANET which is a 
working group at the IETF standardization society. MANET was 
created at 1995 in order to provide RFC to propose routing protocols 
for ad hoc networks. At that time, only Hiperlan 1 could provide 
information forwarding in ad hoc environment. The latter was creating 
a layer 2 routing which is not compliant with other standards. The 
objective of MANET is to adapt the IP routing to work in ad hoc 
networks. From the long works and discussions, we standardize four 
protocols which belong to two different concepts: reactive and 
proactive.

12.3.1. Reactive protocols 
Reactive protocols offer routes for the information flows only on 
demand. This means that the protocol will react to find a route when a 
source node needs to send information to a destination node. During 
the remaining time, the node is idle or active in participating in the 
forwarding process to serve other source nodes. The reactive protocols 
do not consume many resources when idle, however, to discover a 
route and since they do not own any topology information, they flood 
requests among the network and in this case consume a huge amount 
of the network resources. Examples of reactive protocols are AODV 
and DSR. 
12.3.2. Ad hoc on-demand distance vector 
AODV belongs to the reference of distance vector routing 
protocols. In these protocols, the mobile will know how to reach 
certain destinations, the smallest distance in number of hops and the 
next relay (hop). AODV is a reactive protocol; hence, mobile nodes 
do not retain any information for nodes not concerned by the active 
traffic information flows. After the traffic forward is achieved, the 
routing information is maintained for a timeout. 
 
Figure 12.5. Route discovery flooding 
When a mobile node wishes to send packets to a destination, it 
starts checking if it has an available route in its routing table. If this is 

262     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
not the case, it will initiate a route discovery by sending a Route 
Request packet (RREQ) to locate the mobile recipient. This packet is 
distributed to its neighbors. The mobile receiving this RREQ package 
looks if they have a route available to the recipient in their routing 
table. If this is not the case, they in turn rebroadcast the RREQ packet 
to their neighbors and keep a trace. By using sequence numbers on 
packets, this allows us to avoid an infinite loop. RREQ packets are 
flooded throughout the network. When such a packet reaches the 
destination or a mobile node that has a route to this recipient, then a 
response packet (RREP) is generated by the mobile and sent back 
again, due to information stored in the caches traversed by the mobile 
RREQ. During the flooding of the RREP packet, each mobile node 
will update its routing table by keeping the identity of the destination 
according to the route selected by the latter. For example, in 
Figure 12.5, the mobile node X, which has no route to mobile node Y, 
initiates a route discovery process. As we could see, the RREQ 
generates many redundancies and uses a high number of resources. 
From the MAC layer point of view, many nodes will compete in order 
to win a slot within the conflict resolution protocol. When the number 
of requests is very high, this protocol provides a divergence that 
inhibits completely the network operations. In a dense network (high 
number of neighbors per node), the flooding is a disaster for the 
network performance. 
AODV today has many successes and is used in many systems. 
The Zigbee and the WiFi mesh materials use an adapted version of 
AODV. 
12.3.3. Dynamic source routing 
Dynamic source routing (DSR) is also a reactive protocol and it 
works in a very similar to AODV. The main difference resides in the 
routing procedure. AODV is a table-driven routing and DSR is source 
routing. 
Nodes in DSR are idle and when a node decides to send traffic to 
destination, it will initiate a route discovery in an identical procedure 
than AODV. Then to indicate the route, instead of creating local 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     263 
routing tables, each intermediate node prints its identity of the node in 
the packet header. The drawback of source routing is of course the 
additional overhead in the packets. 
The advantage of source routing is that the route information is 
retained in the packets and nodes could at any moment be aware of the 
route from the source to the destination. This is not the case with 
routing tables because the only information that we keep is the next 
hop. Knowing the complete route could facilitate the reaction of 
mechanisms for quality of service, security, energy, etc. 
12.4. Proactive protocols 
A proactive routing protocol maintains regularly updated 
information on the network at each node. This information is obtained 
through messages sent periodically or triggered in response to 
important events occurring in the network. This information allows 
each mobile to keep topology knowledge offering the possibility to 
calculate a route for each destination in the network. The routing 
policy adopted in packet radio networks had a proactive approach. 
Examples of proactive routing protocols are Destination-Sequenced 
Distance-Vector (DSDV), Optimized LinkState Routing (OLSR) and 
Topology Broadcast Based on Reverse-Path Forwarding (TBRPF). 
OLSR became TBRPF Experimental RFC. DSDV is, however, now 
completely obsolete. 
12.4.1. Optimized link state routing protocol 
Optimized link state routing protocol (OLSR) aims to maximize 
the dissemination of information packets in the network and reduce 
the overhead due to the flooding procedure. For this, the protocol is 
based on the concept of multipoint relays. A multipont relay (MPR) is 
authorized to retransmit information to another relay. Each node 
selects its MPR according to the following rule: from my direct 
neighbors, I will choose a minimal subset that could cover all two hop 
neighbors with symmetric links. Figure 12.6 displays a comparison  
 

264     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
between classical flooding and an MPR optimized one. The more 
dense the network, the more efficient the MPR optimization. The 
MPR selection is related to the dominating set problem which is NP-
complete and it is necessary to use heuristics to reduce the time 
needed for the selection. 
 
Figure 12.6. Route discovery flooding 
To establish its list of multipoint relays, each mobile regularly 
sends its identity and its list of neighbors. With this information, each 
mobile will know the network topology in its tow-hop neighborhood. 
Thus, it will be able to determine a list of multipoint relays which will 
cover all the neighbors in a two-hop distance. Each terminal informs 
its multipoint relay of its choice, which allows each mobile to know 
whether it is able to retransmit the information it receives from a given 
mobile. The second step consists of sending the list of selected MPRs 
to all the nodes of the network (MPR flooding) and thus each node 
which receives this information will be able to build a topology map 
and calculate the best route for each destination. 
12.4.2. Topology dissemination based on reverse-path 
forwarding 
As with OLSR, topology dissemination based on reverse-path 
forwarding (TBRPF) is a proactive protocol that seeks to reduce the 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     265 
use of bandwidth. However, and unlike OLSR, which maintains a 
partial topology of the network (using MPR), all mobiles in TBRPF 
have a knowledge of the complete topology of the network. Such 
knowledge is more expensive but allows the use of multiple paths or 
paths with a certain Quality of Service. For the network topology, 
each node will maintain a tree of shortest path (it may be possible to 
use a different metric) to all other nodes. The tree is unique to each 
mobile. When a mobile detects a state change at one of its neighboring 
links, it sends an update on its associated tree. Each internal node in 
the tree forwards the update message. 
The trees themselves are constructed according to the update 
messages: when a node receives such a message, it computes the tree-
related message initiator. The update messages are sent only when 
detecting a status change (appearance or disappearance of a link). 
Only the neighbor discovery messages are sent periodically. 
12.5. Quality of Service in ad hoc networks 
For the last several years, there has been a significant increase in 
interest in supporting Quality of Service (QoS) constraints in 
MANETs. The specificity of MANETs makes existing solutions for 
wire line networks not very suitable and a broad range of novel 
approaches have been studied. When considering QoS support, there 
are several aspects that must be taken care of. 
First, one must choose a QoS model, i.e. the eventual goals one 
wants to achieve. These are closely  related to the applications that are 
to take advantage of the QoS support. Real-time audio/video 
applications require constant bandwidth and little delay, whereas FTP 
transfers can go with no more than classical best-effort. Moreover, the 
former can adapt its throughput to the available bandwidth and sustain 
data loss to some extent, while the latter requires a lossless channel. 
Most of the time, the model must comprise bandwidth and delay 
constraints. Second, a QoS-aware routing protocol should be used in 
order to find a suitable multi-hop path given some link constraints 
supported by the model. Third, if reservation is to be made – which is 
the case for most QoS-requiring applications, though a strict 

266     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
reservation is possibly not suitable, because of the dynamic topology 
variations – a signaling system has to be chosen to communicate 
between the source node and all the intermediates. Likewise, in the 
case of constraint breakage, the signaling is used by the intermediate 
nodes either to repair the link – by reestablishing a bypassing path – or 
to report the failure to the source node. Finally, when the connection 
ends, the reservation has to be torn down. Once more, because of the 
varying topology, the reservation is maintained in a soft state, i.e. it is 
never definitive and has to be renewed on a regular basis. This is due 
to the fact that a link failure may cause a partition of the network that 
would not allow us to contact intermediates anymore. Signaling 
generally comes in two flavors: in-band and out-of-band. The first 
consists of control information piggybacked on regular data packets 
(e.g. as options in the IP header) and has the advantage of not 
transmitting additional packets that would contend with data packets 
and potentially waste bandwidth or delay. The second is a special kind 
of control packet that can be transmitted independently of any data 
flow. 
Finally, nodes must support some packet scheduling (fair queuing) 
algorithms in order to prioritize some packets or to shape some flows. 
Optionally, if the MAC layer provides some kind of support for QoS, 
it can be taken advantage of in upper layers. Support can exist in 
direct low level delay respect or bandwidth allocation (e.g. in TDMA-
based MAC protocols) or solely in link quality accounting capability. 
12.6. Models for QoS in MANET 
In this section, we present works carried out to provide QoS issues 
in MANET: 
– Flexible QoS Model for MANETs (FQMM) is an attempt to 
build a model explicitly for MANETs. It can be seen as a mix of 
IntServ and DiffServ in the way that it supports both per-flow and  
per-class granularity. Flows with borderline QoS requirements are 
granted per-flow processing, while the others are aggregated in 
classes. As in DiffServ, there are three types of nodes: the sender 
(ingress node), the routers (interior nodes) and the receiver (egress 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     267 
node). The ingress node is required to police its outgoing traffic to 
meet a given traffic profile. Traffic profiles are expressed in terms of 
percentage of available bandwidth, to cope with changing link 
conditions. The routing algorithm is left unspecified and is assumed to 
be of multi-path kinds (i.e. all routes to a target are known allowing 
for multiple choices with respect to some bandwidth requirements), 
though the use of some QoS-aware routing protocol is encouraged. 
– Core-Extraction Distributed Ad hoc Routing (CEDAR) is a 
reactive protocol which optimizes routing request by using core nodes, 
i.e. nodes that belong to the dominating set of the network. Each node 
broadcasts periodically BEACON messages which are used for one-
hop neighborhood discovery. In a first phase of the protocol, each 
node must elect its core node. The set of nodes that are the core node 
of a neighbor is called the core of the network. Then, local topology 
information is disseminated by means of piggybacking link 
information to BEACON messages to the three-hop neighborhood of 
the nodes, allowing each core node to maintain virtual links to its 
neighboring core nodes. Thus, core nodes maintain information about 
the local core graph. When a node s needs a route to d, it requests a 
route calculation to its core node, dom(s). By means of some chosen 
reactive routing protocol, dom(s) finds a core path to dom(d). After 
having learnt the route to dom(d), s sends packets to d by means of 
source-routing. Now, if QoS constraints are to be honored for a given 
route calculation, each core node must find a virtual link to the next 
core node toward dom(d) that satisfies them. The use of core nodes for 
route calculation assumes that the core path is a good hint toward the 
optimal route. But, it does not ensure that the best route can be found. 
– Ticket-based 
probing 
aims 
to 
achieve 
a 
near-optimal 
performance while avoiding flooding and accounting for link 
information imprecision. QoS satisfying routes are found by sending 
probes carrying some limited total amount of tickets toward the 
destination using distance vector information. At each intermediate 
node, a probe may be divided into several ones with the tickets 
distributed between them. The total amount of tickets is to remain the 
same along the propagation. The goal is to maintain a compromise 
between the odds of finding an optimal route (more tickets sent) and  
 

268     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
reduced control overhead (less tickets sent). If only one ticket is sent, 
then the plain old shortest path is searched. TBP relies on the 
assumption that stable links tend to remain stable contrary to the so-
called transient links. Each node i collects statistical information about 
delay Di(t), bandwidth Bi(t) and cost Ci(t) to each other node t in the 
network. It is thus not meant to be scalable, but is instead destined for 
moderate scale networks. Along with Di(t) and Bi(t), each node 
maintains the association variation DDi(t) and DBi(t) by which the 
next reported value will differ from the current one. The protocol 
makes a distinction between delay and bandwidth constrained paths. 
Thus, it either searches a route for least-cost delay-constrained 
connections, or least-cost bandwidth-constrained connections. For 
each purpose, it defines two kinds of tickets – yellow ones and green 
ones – that make the probes either look for feasible paths or least-cost 
paths. The relative quantity of each kind governs which kind of path is 
going to be searched. 
– INSIGNIA is meant to provide a complete framework for QoS 
support in MANET. It is based on the assumption that applications 
requiring QoS support also provide a way to modulate this 
requirement and can sustain service degradation by the use of adaptive 
services. The model thus defines three operating modes for a flow: 
best effort (BE), base QoS (BQ) constraints with minimum bandwidth 
and enhanced QoS (EQ) with maximum bandwidth. It also assumes, 
quite rightfully, that the destination node is the best place to measure 
the QoS of a flow and make decisions about service degradation. The 
framework provides a form of in-band signaling between source and 
destination by the addition of an option in the IP header of packets, the 
purpose of which is to attach QoS requirements to a flow as well as a 
means to alert the destination in case the requirements are not fulfilled 
at a bottleneck node. 
The framework is not specifically designed to operate with a given 
routing protocol and is instead meant to support any MANET routing 
protocol. Thus, it does not take any advantage of QoS-aware routing 
but rather relies on service adaptation on the applications side. 
Moreover, the framework remains independent of any MAC layer 
specificities which should ensure easy implementation with existing 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     269 
networking equipment. The destination is required to report the QoS 
level to the source in the feedback in order to modulate the flow to suit 
QoS conditions. Rerouting is provided by the routing protocol and 
quality is subject to degradation in case of failure to reserve resources 
along the new path. Old reservations are nevertheless supported by 
soft state and disappear if not regularly refreshed. 
Stateless Wireless Ad hoc Network (SWAN) provides QoS support 
through service differentiation. It is another framework independent of 
the routing protocol and the MAC layer, though it relies on the latter 
for bandwidth and delay measurement. The novelty is that routing 
nodes do not maintain any state information about the flows they 
forward – hence they are stateless. Each node differentiates two kinds 
of traffic through DSCP flags in the IP header: real time (RT) and best 
effort (BE). RT flows are forwarded normally, whereas BE are fed to 
a traffic conditioner. The node actively monitors RT bandwidth usage 
and sets the conditioners’ parameters accordingly to shape BE traffic 
to the residual bandwidth so that packet queues are maintained in 
short form to avoid delay increase. When a node intends to open a 
QoS constrained connection, it sends a probe to measure bottleneck 
bandwidth and available delay. Here, it seems that any routing 
protocol may be used, especially a QoS-aware one comes in handy. 
While traversing the network toward the destination, the probe is 
marked by the routing nodes with the measure actual link delay and 
minimum bandwidth. The destination copies this gathered information 
in the reply packet and sends it back to the source which can then 
decide whether to admit the flow or not. Once the flow is admitted, it 
has to be routed through the chosen path. 
Quality of Service for OLSR (QOLSR) is an extension of OLSR 
protocol which is capable of providing multiple-metric routing. This 
extension can be added to OLSR functioning. No additional control 
traffic is generated (only augmented HELLO and TC messages). 
QOLSR protocol uses standard multipoint relays (MPRs) to ensure 
that the overhead is as low as possible for forwarding control traffic. 
Local QoS metrics information on links is used to elect the Quality of 
Service MPRs (QMPRS). This information is then flooded in the 
network by TC messages to calculate routing tables. QOLSR can find 

270     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
optimal paths on the known partial topology having the same 
bandwidth performances as those on the whole network. These paths 
contain only QMPRs as intermediate nodes between a source 
destination pair. 
QOLSR carries out different functions which are required to 
perform the task of routing: (1) neighbor sensing allows, by means of 
hellos messages, each node to detect the neighbor nodes with which it 
has a direct and bi-directional lin; (2) neighbor QoS measurement is 
done by the node to estimate the QoS conditions (available bandwidth, 
delay, loss probability, cost, security, power consumption, etc.) on 
links to each neighbor having direct and symmetric link; (3) Quality 
of Service multipoint relay selection which is made by the node to 
design its own set of QMPRs. This set is calculated to contain a subset 
of the 1-hop neighbors which provides maximum bandwidth and 
minimum delay from each 2-hop neighbor to the given node. The 
QMPR set does not need to be optimal, but it should be small enough 
to minimize the number of generated TC messages in the network. 
Topology Control extension messages are sent to all the nodes by each 
QMPR node regular interval to declare its QMPR selector set and QoS 
conditions; and (4) routing table calculation: each node maintains a 
routing table which allows it to route packets for the other destinations 
in the network with optimal metrics respecting QoS constraints. 
12.7. Mesh networks 
Mesh networks are networks of access points forming a mesh 
together. Customers are connected on access points and the access 
points are connected by wireless links forming a network. 
The advantage of these systems is that they can cover a large 
geographical area without the need for cables. For example, on a large 
campus, the access points can be set on the roofs of various buildings 
thus avoiding the use of wired Ethernet. Several opportunities are 
emerging to make a mesh network: 
 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     271 
– use the same frequency at all the terminals and the mesh nodes 
considering that the access points are treated at the same time as 
routers. The difficulty is to efficiently use the bandwidths that are 
shared by terminal machines and nodes. Two access points should not 
be too far away and should not require us at to transmit and receive in 
the same time to avoid lowering their speed. This solution at 
considered as the first-generation mesh networks; 
– using different frequencies for terminal equipment and mesh 
nodes. For example, using a 802.11b/gWiFi network with the three 
frequencies available makes it possible to use two communication 
cards with different frequencies. The downside is of course disturbing 
the frequency plan, especially if the network is large and has many 
access points. This solution is part of the second-generation mesh 
networks; 
– still in the second generation, the mesh network uses a different 
standard to connect the access points to one another. For example, a 
mesh network that connects guests with 802.11g and 802.11a is used 
for interconnecting the access points; 
– the third generation uses three frequencies. One to connect 
customers and the other to interconnect the two access points. In this 
case, the upstream and downstream connections of the same node use 
different frequencies. It usually uses 802.11a, which has up to eight 
different frequencies. 
The mesh networks raise new problems for wireless networks, 
including: how to optimize battery of the access points if they are 
using battery due, for example, to the mobility of the nodes? How to 
optimize routing to avoid disturbing the user traffic from access 
points, especially if they are already saturated? What density of access 
points should be used, which is to question the power of the access 
points? 
The advantage of this technology is to be able to easily reconfigure 
when an access point fails. Guests can connect to another access point, 
even slightly increase the power of neighboring access points that 
failed. 

272     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
The main problem is in managing the routing scheme. This routing 
scheme is treated in the access points that are not very powerful 
machines, and must therefore avoid access points that support a lot of 
traffic from connected customers. Many proposals have been made, 
primarily those derived from ad hoc networks. 
Following 15 proposals, the working group adopted two proposals 
IEEE 802.11sa the SEE-Mesh and Wi-Mesh, which have come 
together to form a single proposal. This proposal became a standard in 
April 2007, after many discussions about implementation. The access 
points and stations that have the 802.11s routing algorithm are 
appointed Mesh Points (MP). Radio links are used to interconnect 
them. The default protocol is Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol 
(HWMP). This hybrid protocol is a combination of a protocol from 
the AODV, the RM-AODV (AODV Radio-Metric) and an algorithm 
based on the trees. A second protocol may be used when MP is 
accepted: RA-OLSR (Radio-Aware OLSR). 
The IEEE 802.11s group also defines security solutions for mesh 
networks. To do this, it defines mutual MP authentication, generates 
and controls the session keys, enables data encryption on the lines of 
the ad hoc network and detects attacks. For this, it is necessary to 
perform authentication with the IEEE 802.1x protocol. The session 
keys are managed by a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure). 
Confidentiality is ensured by the IEEE 802.11i standard. 
Handovers are possible in some mesh networks, allowing a greater 
mobility for the mobile equipment. This is the case of the Green 
Communications mesh network that will be studied later on. 
Moreover, telephony is becoming a special application of these 
environments. We can therefore expect a diversification of handheld 
terminal stations able to connect to networks of ambient Internet 
available in all popular crossing points, such as the centers of cities, 
railway stations, airports, subways, etc. 
The advantage of ad hoc networks and mesh over 3G/4G 
technologies is to use the frequencies over very limited areas, 
allowing a high reuse. In addition, the cost of a mesh access point is 
negligible compared to that of a 3G/4G antenna. Given the explosion 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     273 
of mobile flows, the gain realized by an ad hoc or a mesh network is 
enormous. Most working groups dedicated to mobile networks are 
looking at hybrid solutions to save both energy and spectrum. 
Another advantage of mesh networks over 3G/4G comes from 
energy consumption. We address this issue in more detail in the 
following section, but in short, a 3G/4G consumes on the average 
2,000 W per antenna. Concerning mesh access points, they use less 
than 20 W. Substituting a 3G/4G cell by a set of 30 mesh points, the 
overall throughput of the mesh network is much higher, and the 
consumption is halved. We will see later on how to decrease the 
energy consumption of mesh access points when the traffic is low, 
such as at night. 
12.8. VANET networks 
VANET is a network concept from the so-called Intelligent 
Transportation Systems. As shown in Figure 12.7, vehicles 
communicate not only with each other by intervehicle bonds, or 
InterVehicle Communication, but also with facilities located along the 
road via vehicle communication equipment or Roadside-to-Vehicle 
Communication. These vehicular networks contribute to safer and 
more efficient roads in the future by providing timely information to 
drivers and the authorities concerned. 
Figure 12.7. A VANET network 

274     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
Many applications have been developed as part of the road network, 
such as reporting a problem on a road. A car accident can automatically 
send an alert signal to the vehicles that are following or that will shortly 
arrive at the accident. Green lights can be synchronized with the 
approach of a car. Self-diagnosis of engine may, after connecting to a 
cloud, send a warning to the driver indicating the problem and the 
associated diagnosis. The VANET networks are quite similar in this 
case to MANET networks, but with the distinction of having fixed 
customers, such as traffic lights and signs. A haracteristic of VANET 
networks, compared with MANET networks, is the greatest simplicity 
of travel related to roads and railways, which generally determines the 
direction taken by the customer. 
Another case is represented by a vehicle carrying many passengers. 
Many applications have been developed for these types of transport, 
such as aircraft multiplayer games, or discussions between people who 
do not know one another, but who will be together for several hours, 
etc. 
12.9. Green PI: wearable Device2Device networks 
Telecommunication technologies in all their forms (2G to 4G, 
WiFi, WiMAX, etc.) use a unique model to communicate between 
two entities. It consists of forwarding the packets to an access point 
which sends the information back to the destination (Figure 12.8). 
This happens when source and destination are in the same cell. If 
source and destination are located in two different cells, then the 
information uses a hierarchical path based on a tree topology going up 
and then down to the final destination as shown in Figure 12.8. 
This model implies many disadvantages in terms of capacity and 
energy consumption:  
1) When many devices want to access the network in the same cell 
(Figure 12.8), they have to send the information to the access point 
serving the cell. However, the access point can only process one 
request at the same time. If many requests arrive simultaneously, they 
generate collisions and interferences. A scheduling mechanism needs 
to be elaborated at the access point in order to organize the access to 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     275 
the network, request by request. Parallel request cannot be served 
which limits the capacity of the cell.  
                          a)                                                          b) 
Figure 12.8. a) Communication in one cell and b) in different cells 
 
Figure 12.9. Scheduling at the access point 
2) In terms of energy consumption, transferring the information to 
an intermediate access point instead of direct transfer doubles the 
number of transmissions/receptions. Also, when using a tree-topology 
path to climb up then down on a vertical way will increase the energy 
per bit comparing to a direct and horizontal path. Figure 12.10 

276     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
illustrates 
the 
difference 
between 
horizontal 
and 
vertical 
communications. 
Figure 12.10. Horizontal versus vertical communications 
The objectives of the next generation 5G is to increase the network 
capacity by introducing a Device2Device technology. Using direct 
communications would increase the capacity of the networks since 
parallel communications could happen comparing to an access point 
centralized scheduling. Direct communications do not need to 
communicate with high power since the destination is very close to 
the source. The low power reduces the energy consumption and 
increases the capacity by reducing the interferences. 
12.9.1. Observation of traffic 
When scanning the traffic on telecommunication networks, one 
could observe that an important part of the traffic is local. People 
during events or in smart cities and smart homes share pictures and 
videos, exchange information on their environment. The information 
in the majority of cases does not need to travel through the  
 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     277 
infrastructure of the network and the Cloud and to consume a huge 
amount of resources and energy to return to the neighborhood. 
However, as the video traffic on mobile devices is doubling every 
year, this avoids to create bottlenecks at the access points. 
12.9.2. Embedded Internet and 5G 
The idea to go directly from source to destination is not new. Its 
implementation has never been realized in the past because operators 
of networks had to control the traffic for accounting and monitoring. 
Nowadays, the majority of subscriptions include an unlimited usage of 
the network. Hence, the more the traffic is out of the operator 
network, the less the infrastructure of the operator is saturated while 
its income stays the same. Introducing horizontal and direct 
communications is a win-win policy for operators, customers and also 
the entire eco-system. Why, should local traffic travel over the entire 
network and data centers just to reach a close destination? 
5G networks include in their requirements the faculty that two 
devices should communicate directly with no need for any network 
infrastructure. This implies that the device should contain a minimum 
of network intelligence to have the capacity to detect destinations and 
to also transfer the traffic of its peers. In addition, Device2Device 
communication should continue to work even when the global 
network is not operating or when damages push the global network 
offline.  
Attempt to create intelligence in the applications of Smartphones is 
an option to introduce the Device2Device. Some products are already 
working on different platforms (IOS, Android, etc.) such as AirDrop 
or Firechat. In those cases, the Device2Device is managed at the 
application layer and with a proprietary protocol. This means that 
Smartphones should first install the application to run a 
Device2Device. Furthermore, each new service requires the 
development and download of a new application. This model cannot 
scale. 

278     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
12.9.3. Green PI: wearable and embedded Internet 
Green Communications has introduced the concept of Embedded 
Internet where devices hold a full TCP/IP environment, an open 
operating system (Buildroot-based Linux) and a sharing storage. Each 
device contains two wireless network interfaces. One to establish the 
network between the devices and the second to offer access to 
SmartPhones, PADS and computers. All types of applications will be 
active immediately because the network is running a TCP/IP locally. 
It is also possible to provide many applications over http using a local 
web server and the latest web technologies (htmls). This gives the 
opportunity to anyone to communicate even if they have not 
downloaded a native application. 
The Green Communications’ device is light enough to be held or 
wearable. It could be distributed on-site or could be brought along by 
the visitors. When turning the devices ON, the network is established 
in a few seconds and then a local Internet is operated. A subset of the 
devices could be configured as gateways to the global Internet to 
create a hybrid model where local traffic stays local and global traffic 
is transferred across the gateways.  
 
Figure 12.11. Monitoring interface with open data 

Ad Hoc and Mesh Networks     279 
The device also includes storage with security options to offer the 
possibility of sharing information and also installing new specific 
applications related to the area where the network is running. The 
network provides access to its raw open data to help people in their 
connections and enables application developers to build more 
appropriate applications related to on-site usage. Figure 12.11 shows 
the different kinds of data that are open: network topology, number of 
users per access point, quality of links between access points, location 
of the Internet Gateways, access point profiles through the vCard 
Standard, etc. 
The idea that people could hold their own personal boxes creates 
the concept of the Participatory Internet (PI). Any group of persons 
could simply, by turning ON their own boxes, create an Internet that 
could operate on local content or connect to the global Internet.  
Green PI offers advantages to facilitate the communication in 
many cases: 
1) Network densification: dense areas such as stadiums and large 
areas need a strong network densification to offer Internet access with 
acceptable quality. Providing an access point for every 30 users is 
cash intensive and needs heavy civil engineering schemes for cabling. 
Asking a subset of participants to hold a Green PI access point reduces 
the cost of the coverage by a factor of seven. 
2) Mobile units: connecting mobile units (robots, drones and 
people on the move) is not possible with an infrastructure-based 
network (4G, satellite, etc.). A participatory Internet with an 
embedded TCP/IP and local content is the solution to create an on 
demand network and allow direct communications. 
12.9.4. Distributed TCP/IP 
In order for an embedded Internet to work correctly, it is 
mandatory to distribute all the services over the devices. Services 
should not depend on one specific machine to avoid any network 
blackout. When a device enters or leaves the network, services must 
continue to work correctly. Green Communications provides 

280     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
distributed TCP/IP over the devices by enhancing them with Zeroconf 
(mDNS, DNS-SD, etc.), anycast addresses, handoff management, 
distributed DHCP implementation, distributed database, etc. 
12.9.5. Wearable YOI 
The Wearable YOI consists of hardware containing three network 
interfaces (two wireless plus Ethernet) and working with a Buildroot-
based Linux. It offers embedded TCP/IP providing WiFi access to the 
local or global Internet. All native TCP/IP applications may be active 
in private or public connections. 
The performances of Green Communications products have proved 
to provide voice over IP and video conferencing over 10 WiFi hops. 
This unique performance has never been shown before by any 
competitor.  
Here is a subset of the Wearable YOI specifications:

Mobile-Edge Computing 
13.1. Network virtualization 
Virtualization is not a new technique, since it was introduced in the 
first mainframe computers to share the memory through the paging 
system. The trick was to bring back the memory pages from HDD 
RAM just before the CPU needs them. Thereafter, a number of 
mechanisms have been implemented with this solution so that the user 
has the impression that the services needed are located on a nearby 
machine when they actually are on a remote machine. 
Server virtualization has been a tremendous success for grouping 
multiple servers on a single machine; the user has the impression of 
yet having only one server. Network virtualization holds the same 
principle: several virtual networks share the same physical 
infrastructure. 
Network virtualization was initiated by an American project called 
Global Environment for Network Innovations, in which Intel intended 
to build a router consisting only of its material part, without any 
network operating system. Software companies had only to implement 
their system on the machine. The advantage of virtualization lies 
precisely in the ability to implement multiple network operating 
systems on a single machine using a “hypervisor”. A virtual router is 
shown in Figure 13.1.

Figure 13.1. A virtual router 
A virtual router is therefore a logical instance of a physical router 
and several virtual routers can run simultaneously on one physical 
router, or on a generic machine with input-output required to achieve 
the physical router. We then obtain the ability to deploy multiple 
networks that can be called virtual networks on a single physical 
network. A virtual network is a grouping of a set of compatible virtual 
routers. Virtual routers use the physical links to interconnect. 
Such an environment is shown in Figure 13.2, in which the 
networks A, B, C and D coexist on the same router and the same 
physical lines.

Mobile-Edge Computing     285 
A virtual network is made from the virtual routers with the 
operating system A. Similarly, the virtual network B is formed with 
the bodies B and so on. Each instance of the same physical router can 
use completely different protocols, networks are also totally different. 
Everyone can use the protocols related to a data application. 
The advantages of this virtualization technique are numerous. The 
first is to be able to run on the same physical network, virtual 
networks using completely different technologies. One can, for 
example, get a first network using the IOS network operating system 
from Cisco, a second using JUNOS Juniper, a third and a fourth using 
the Nokia and Ericsson systems, etc. It is also possible to run several 
different releases of the same network operating system. Obviously, 
the above examples have little chance of being realized because 
network manufacturers do not necessarily want to market their 
software without their equipment. Decoupling hardware/software will 
only be available for open systems. 
A second advantage of virtualization is the use of resources. It is 
obvious that the resources can be much better utilized by starting and 
stopping virtual routers or by moving an overloaded virtual router. It 
is possible to move one or more virtual routers to other physical 
routers. 
In all cases, the resources must be completely isolated. This 
implies a great security between networks. If any of the virtual routers 
fails, this does not affect the others. If, of course, a physical routers 
fails, all virtual routers will also be down. The isolation also protects 
against network attacks. 
13.2. Network virtualization technology 
Both technologies can be used for network virtualization. Xen is 
one of the solutions for virtualization among many others but certainly 
one of the oldest solutions. OpenFlow is a signaling system for 
virtualized networks of the new generation: Software-Defined 
Networking (SDN). We are going to describe these two environments. 

286     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
13.2.1. Xen 
Xen is a Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM), open source, also 
called a hypervisor, that runs on standard hardware platforms. In 
addition to the VMM, on the physical hardware, the Xen architecture 
is composed of several domains running simultaneously on the 
hypervisor, called virtual machines (see Figure 13.3). Each virtual 
machine can have its own operating system and applications. The 
VMM controls access to multiple hardware domains and manages the 
sharing of resources between different areas. Thus, one of the main 
tasks of VMM is to isolate different virtual machines, so that the 
execution of a virtual machine does not affect the performance of 
other machines. 
All device drivers are stored in an isolated area that is reserved for 
them. Called domain 0 (dom0), it provides them with a reliable and 
efficient hardware support. Domain 0 has special privileges compared 
to other domains, called user domains (domU), and has, for example, 
full access to the hardware of the physical machine. The user domains 
have virtual drivers and operate as if they could directly access the 
hardware. However, these virtual pilots communicate with the dom0 
in order to have access to the physical hardware.

Xen virtualizes a single physical network interface inbound  
packet by demultiplexing of the physical interface to the user domains 
and, inversely, by multiplexing the outgoing packets generated by 
these user domains. In this procedure, called virtualization of 
networks, the area 0 directly accesses the peripheral IO using its 
native device drivers and performs input-output operations from the 
domU. 
 
Figure 13.4. Virtualization with the Xen hypervisor 
The user domains employ virtual input-output devices controlled 
by virtual drivers to ask the dom0 for access to the device, as shown in 
Figure 13.4. Each user domain has its own virtual network interfaces, 
called foreground interfaces, required for network communications. 
The background interfaces are created in the area 0 corresponding to 
each leading interface in a user domain and act as a proxy for the 
virtual interfaces in dom0. Leading interfaces and background are 
connected to each other via a channel input-output, which employs a

zero-copy mechanism to match the physical page containing the 
package and the target domain. In this way, the packets are exchanged 
between the background and foreground interfaces. Leading interfaces 
are perceived by the operating systems running on user fields as real 
interfaces. However, the background in the dom0 interfaces is 
connected to the physical interface and to one another via a virtual 
network bridge. This is the default architecture, called the bridge 
mode, used by Xen. Thus, both the input-output channel and the 
bridge network establish a communications path between the virtual 
interfaces created in the user domains and the physical interface. 
Different elements of the virtual network may be implemented using 
Xen since it allows multiple virtual machines to run simultaneously on 
the same hardware, as shown in Figure 13.4. In this case, each virtual 
machine operates a virtual router, which has its own control plans and 
data, the Xen virtualization layer being low. 
13.2.2. OpenFlow 
OpenFlow is a signaling system, corresponding at the southbound 
interface. OpenFlow allows us to use a patch not only to set up a 
production network but also for an experimental network completely 
isolated from the production network. The OpenFlow interface, 
initiated by Stanford University, aims to create virtual environments 
for new categories of networks in parallel to the production network 
using network components such as switches, routers, access points 
and PCs. 
OpenFlow provides a new architecture to provide virtual network 
environments. The underlying idea is the physical separation of 
control and data planes. That is why different elements perform the 
packet transfer procedure (data plan) and network control procedure 
(control plane). The transfer is made through a forwarding table that 
represents the data plane, while the control plane is centralized around 
a controller. This controller is able to put in correspondence different 
applications that control each virtual network. An example of running 
OpenFlow is given in Figure 13.5. 

Mobile-Edge Computing     289 
 
Figure 13.5. OpenFlow signaling 
The OpenFlow protocol defines the communication between the 
transfer nodes and the network controller. It establishes a secure 
channel between each node and the transfer controller using this 
channel to monitor and configure the transfer nodes. Each time a new 
packet reaches a transfer node and there is no path configured 
previously, the first bits of the packet are transmitted to the controller 
that sets a path for the corresponding stream. The controller may also 
select the normal processing action for a flow for transmission 
according to the conventional transfer of the layer 2 an /or layer 3, as 
if OpenFlow did not exist. This is why OpenFlow can be used in 
parallel with a production network without affecting the ongoing 
traffic. 
The data plan in OpenFlow is a set of tables described by header 
fields, meters and actions. The header fields form a structure that 
describes the 12 positions in the packet header, as shown in 
Figure 13.6. These fields specify a stream by setting a value for each

field or by using a wild card to set only a subset of fields. The flow 
table also supports the use of subnet masks, if the equipment also 
supports the correspondence. This structure with 12 subfields leaves 
flexibility to transfer packets because a stream can be routed on the 
basis of not only the IP destination, as in a conventional TCP/IP 
network, but also on TCP port, MAC address, etc. As flows may be 
determined by layer 2 addresses, the OpenFlow transfer nodes are also 
called OpenFlow switches. However, this does not necessarily apply 
and packets can be sent through a layer 3. One of the future goals of 
OpenFlow is to manipulate header fields defined by the user, which 
means that the packet header will not be described by fixed fields, but 
by a combination of fields specified by the administrators of the 
virtual network. 
OpenFlow has the ability to configure nodes to allow the 
transmission of packets by running any protocol stack. The description 
of the flow through the first field of the header is followed by counters 
which are used for monitoring nodes. Counters provide information 
such as the duration of the stream and the amount of bytes transmitted. 
The last field in the description of the stream decides on actions. 
These actions form an instruction set which is applied to each packet 
of a specific flow in the OpenFlow switches. They include not only 
the routing of an incoming packet to a destination, but also the 
modification of header fields such as the ID of the VLAN, or source 
and destination addresses. 
The controller is a central element in the network. It can 
communicate with all nodes to configure the flow tables. The 
controller uses a network operating system that provides virtual 
network management applications and basic functions such as 
network configuration. Thus, the OpenFlow controller works as  
an interface between network applications and transfer nodes. It 
provides the basic functions to access the packets of a flow and 
monitor node. 
OpenFlow works with any controller compatible with the 
OpenFlow protocol, such as NOX. In this case, each control plane 
consists of a set of applications running on NOX. This is why a virtual 

Mobile-Edge Computing     291 
network is defined by its control plan, which is a set of applications 
running on the controller, as shown in Figure 13.7. 
 
Figure 13.6. Open Flow meters 
Figure 13.7. Centralized Open Flow controller model 
By using the single controller model, it is possible to create 
multiple virtual networks. However, note that the various applications 
running on the same operating system are in general not well isolated. 
Accordingly, if a problem occurs in an application, this can stop the 
operation of the controller, thus affecting all other virtual networks.

FlowVisor is a tool used to allow different OpenFlow controllers to 
operate on the same physical network. FlowVisor works as a proxy 
between the switching elements and the controllers, assuming that 
there is a controller for each network. Using this model, it is possible 
to ensure that problems affecting one virtual network do not affect the 
others. OpenFlow provides a scalable infrastructure based on the idea 
of distributed switching elements. This element offers basic functions 
for operating a network through a centralized control plan. Using this 
infrastructure, it is possible to partition the physical network into 
multiple virtual networks. In OpenFlow, instantiating a network is 
performed by creating a few sets of applications in the controller. The 
flows of a new network are accepted on request at the time of the 
arrival of the first packet entering the network. OpenFlow also 
provides a flexible infrastructure to reallocate network resources. The 
reallocation of a network in OpenFlow means only reprogramming the 
flow table of each participant node. This is a simple operation for the 
controller which knows the physical devices and how they are 
connected. 
13.3. Using network virtualization 
Two types of use can be performed with network virtualization: 
– multiple virtual networks within the same company. This 
solution can create a virtual network for telephony, one for remote 
monitoring, yet another for video conferencing in the enterprise, etc.; 
– several 
virtual 
networks 
of 
different 
telecommunication 
operators. This allows us to share the same physical resources and 
thus lead to a lower cost for each network. This defines something like 
a VPN deployed by the infrastructure operator. When a virtual 
telecommunication operator wants to increase its transmission 
capacity, this one asks for the infrastructure operator to increase its 
resources. 
Another growing use of virtualization schemes concerns Cloud-
based applications. In simple terms, the principle of the Cloud is to put 
applications as common resources in a Cloud to share these 
applications with other users. The Cloud offers server resources, 

Mobile-Edge Computing     293 
computing power, storage capacity, diverse and varied software, etc. 
Users can share these resources with others, taking into account a 
strong security to access the information. Virtual resources can 
migrate from one machine to another one to optimize their utilization. 
Similarly, the client can move on the Internet and have access to 
resources from anywhere. To link the resources to the user, it is 
necessary to create networks. However, these networks can only be 
virtual because it would be impossible to create a new network as 
soon as a software migrates or a request is formulated for additional 
resources. 
Finally, virtualization is an ideal technology to test new protocols 
and new architectures without stopping the operational network. It is 
quite simple to build a new virtual network using OpenFlow or any 
other southbound interface. In this case, isolation is an essential 
property to avoid attacks from one virtual network to another one. 
As a summary, virtualization offers many advantages if security 
can be maintained. Virtualization is seen as an opportunity to provide 
flexibility to the networks. In addition, this allows us to switch from 
one technology to another without complicating life too much: we 
may add virtual networks using new protocols while retaining virtual 
networks using previous protocols. 
The disadvantages of virtualization are linked to the new charge 
provided by the hypervisor and the need for more memory and 
computing power, especially if we want to fully separate the different 
virtual networks. 
13.3.1. Isolation 
The isolation is a fundamental principle of network virtualization: 
a network cannot have an impact on other networks. 
A first simple but very effective solution would be to partition 
resources between the different networks. In this case, there would not  
 
 

294     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
be much to win, because resources of unused network at time t cannot 
be used by other virtual networks. We must find a solution for both 
partitioning the resources and ensuring that unused resources can 
benefit other networks. 
This property can be obtained by specific schedulers. The easiest 
way is to have nodes with as many queues as virtual networks. In each 
queue, the virtual networks grant credits based on the resources that 
were allocated to the node for each virtual network. Each network 
uses a credit to send a packet. When a virtual network is out of credit, 
the node cannot transmit a packet. As long as there are other active 
queues, the virtual network is stopped. If, at some point, all queues are 
empty, a reallocation of credits is assigned to all queues. However, 
this can lead to a blocking situation, either queues have no credit or 
queues enjoy credits but no packet to be served. To avoid this 
problem, the blocked queues can create negative credits and continue 
to transmit. When the sum of positive and negative credits becomes 
equal to zero, the system is reset by providing positive credits to all 
nodes. 
From 
this 
example, 
available 
on 
Xen 
hypervisor 
(http://www.xen.org), a queue can be allowed to serve multiple 
packets as soon as the queue possesses available credits. 
13.3.2. Extensive network virtualization 
Virtualization technology was applied first on routers and this is 
surely one of the most interesting applications for a virtual machine. 
However, many other hardware devices can also be virtualized. As an 
example, we can virtualize WiFi controllers. This is used to manage 
WiFi access points from a virtual machine placed in a datacenter away 
from the local area network. The associated access points can have 
their own protocol stack. 
A firewall can also be virtualized. To access a company, the 
packets are guided to a general virtual firewall which, in turn, may 
redirect the flow to a virtual firewall dedicated to a specific  
 
 

Mobile-Edge Computing     295 
application. The virtual firewalls can settle all the necessary power to 
perform the deep packet inspections to detect attacks. 
The access points themselves can be virtualized. Simply introduce 
a hypervisor supporting multiple operating systems. Each virtual 
access point has its own software management and control. The 
virtual access points can be independent of each other even if located 
in the same infrastructure. Similarly, it is possible to virtualize BTS, 
NodeB, eNodeB, HeNB, etc. This allows us to share antennas between 
different operators. 
Overall, any resource may be virtualized, except sensors, which 
require a hardware element to measure a value, physical antennas, and 
senders and receivers. Therefore, a virtual sensor may be defined as a 
software associated with a physical sensor to perform calculations 
from the measured values. This software can be changed, hence the 
name of virtual sensor. The future can be viewed as a virtualization of 
all physical machines and more explicitly all functions contained in a 
physical machine. A large number of pieces of network equipment 
may be virtualized as shown in Figure 13.8. 
 
Figure 13.8. Network equipment virtualization 
In this figure, the operating system supports a variety of protocol 
stacks adapted to different problems, such as lack of energy, security,

can use its own protocol stack and change the protocol stack as soon 
as necessary, for example when discovering a problem such as a 
battery almost empty or a DDOS attack. 
Virtualizing physical or radio links is also possible. A physical link 
can be replaced by a virtual link as soon as the client cannot see the 
difference due to identical performance. WiFi can also be virtualized 
if the users did not detect they are using a virtual WiFi hotspot. Again 
the performance of the virtualized system has to be identical to a non-
shared infrastructure. For WiFi access points, this will be the case 
with very high-capacity WiFi technologies such as IEEE 802.11ax. 
Finally, virtualization is an important technique, which allows us to 
introduce new technology painlessly as virtual private networks. Thus, 
it is possible to test a network running a new architecture without any 
risk. Virtualization is also a long-term solution to introduce new 
generation networks like Post-IP proposals. When the network 
architecture of the future will be perfectly defined, this architecture 
may come gradually worldwide through virtualization. 
13.3.3. The Cloud 
The Cloud is a paradigm that was introduced around 2005 which 
proposes to place equipment and software of a company outside the 
company itself, that is to say in the Cloud. 
The advantages of this solution are numerous for the company: this 
can increase or decrease resources at will. The company is not obliged 
to oversize the system since it is simple to add new resources as soon 
as necessary. In addition, the user only pays for what he consumes. 
The company does not need to employ staff to take over the 
management of equipment. This is an undeniable advantage for 
Cloud-based solutions. For the Cloud service provider, the benefits are 
numerous: sharing of resources between all clients and so underlying 
server virtualization, systems, software, networks, etc. The statistical 
multiplexing of resources is pretty good as soon as the number of 
customers is high. 

Mobile-Edge Computing     297 
The Cloud can be fairly well represented by the Internet allowing 
the connection of the users to datacenters. The Internet is capable of 
supporting 
different 
types 
of 
datacenters 
running 
business  
applications. This solution represents an offset of the IT environment 
of a company to the Internet. The Cloud resources can be extremely 
diverse: computational resources, storage of information, software, 
mail service, etc. Depending on the virtualized elements available in 
the Cloud, several types of Clouds can be defined: 
– IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service). This is a first approach, with 
network resources supported in the Cloud, such as network servers, 
storage servers and network itself. We can find IP-PBX, firewall, 
storage servers, etc., and more generally the servers associated with 
the network infrastructure. 
– PaaS (Platform as a Service). This is a second model of Cloud, 
with, in addition to the infrastructure, the middleware corresponding 
to the Internet platform. The company’s servers only take into account 
the applications. 
– SaaS (Software as a Service). This solution allows the Cloud 
provider to offer in addition to the infrastructure and the platform, the 
applications themselves. Almost nothing remains in the company, 
only Internet terminals. This solution, also known as Cloud 
Computing, externalizes virtually all servers and corporate networks. 
These solutions were strongly developed in 2010s. However, it is 
quite difficult for a Cloud provider to optimize its own infrastructure 
and especially the placement of resources available to users. In fact, 
optimization strongly depends on what is desired. To optimize Cloud 
operations, 
performance 
criteria 
are 
important: 
optimizing 
performance and power consumption, balancing loads, etc. 
The resource location should change over time to achieve energy 
and cost savings. For example, it could be better to place resources on 
servers located in an area where it is night on Earth. However, 
resource migration can be expensive. If optimization concerns the cost 
of energy, it is clear that resources must be collected on the same 
machine as close as possible to the company. One can find dozens of 

298     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
different solutions depending on the performance criterion to be 
optimized. 
Virtualization plays a key role as all resources are virtualized 
resources (server, storage, network equipment, etc.). In particular, 
connections to the servers in the Cloud must be done through a virtual 
network set up for this purpose. The virtual network is modified as a 
function of the virtual routers which are migrating to optimize 
performance. 
One difficulty that arises in a business is to find the best Cloud 
provider compared to its needs. Unfortunately, finding an email 
service provider, calculation, storage, specific software, etc., within 
the same Cloud provider is impossible. The company must ask for 
multiple cloud providers, complicating the company’s decision. To 
solve this issue, intermediate suppliers appear, which might be called 
Sky providers. These Sky providers can optimize the selection of the 
Clouds necessary for a company. 
A Sky provider can be seen as the provider of a set of Clouds 
adapted to a company. Another name for a Sky provider is a Virtual 
Clouds Provider. The client (the company), instead of searching for all 
Clouds that will offer him the service he needs himself, addresses the 
Sky provider capable of managing all access to different Clouds 
necessary to his business. The largest companies in the late 2010s 
should be Sky providers. 
13.4. Mobile-edge computing 
Computing provides a new ecosystem and value chain, and the 
opportunity for all players within it to collaborate and develop new 
business models so that they can benefit from each other. Mobile 
Network Operators (MNOs) can rapidly deploy new services for 
consumer and enterprise business segments which can help them 
differentiate their service portfolio. Adding new revenue streams  
from innovative services delivered to the users can improve the 
MNO’s bottom line while improving end user QoE. New applications  
 

Mobile-Edge Computing     299 
whichare aware of the local context in which they operate (RAN 
conditions, locality, etc.) can open up entire new service categories 
and enrich the offering to end users. Placing relevant applications on 
or near the base station not only offers advantages to consumer and 
enterprise end users, but it also reduces the volume of signaling 
offloaded to the core network and could also reduce OPEX for the 
MNOs, compared to hosting in the core. 
The MNOs could increase their revenue by charging based on the 
resource usage (storage, NW bandwidth, CPU, etc.) of each content 
provider, if such resource usage could be obtained via specific 
Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) in MEC servers. 
Software and application providers can serve the new ecosystem 
by developing and bringing to the market innovative and ground 
breaking services and applications that can take advantage of the 
information on radio network capabilities and conditions available at 
the base station. The application space is open to anyone: software and 
application providers, infrastructure vendors and MNOs. The use of 
open standards and APIs, as well as the use of familiar programming 
models, relevant tools chain and Software Development Kits are key 
pillars to encourage and expedite the development of new disruptive 
applications or the adaptation of existing services and applications to 
the new Mobile-edge Computing environment. We are going to 
describe different examples of use cases using Mobile-Edge 
Computing. 
13.4.1. Use case 1: active device location tracking 
Figure 13.9 shows an example of the active device location 
tracking use case. This use case enables real-time, network 
measurement-based tracking of active (GPS independent and network 
determined) terminal equipment, using “bestin-class” third-party geo-
location algorithms within a geo-location application hosted on the 
MEC server. This provides an efficient and scalable solution with 
local measurement processing and event-based triggers. It enables  
 
 

300     Mobile and Wireless Networks 
location-based services for enterprises and consumers (e.g. on opt-in 
basis), for example in venues, retail locations and traditional coverage 
areas where GPS coverage is not available. 
Figure 13.9. Example of active device location tracking 
13.4.2. Use case 2: augmented reality content delivery 
An Augmented Reality (AR) application on a smart-phone or tablet 
overlays augmented reality content onto objects viewed on the device 
camera (as displayed in Figure 13.10). Applications on the MEC 
server can provide local object tracking and local AR content caching. 
The solution minimizes round trip time and maximizes throughput for 
optimum quality of experience. It can be used to offer consumer or 
enterprise propositions, such as tourist information, sporting event 
information, advertisements, etc.

Mobile-Edge Computing     301 
13.4.3. Use case 3: video analytics 
Figure 13.11 shows a distributed video analytics solution which 
provides an efficient and scalable mobile solution for LTE. The video 
management application transcodes and stores captured video streams 
from cameras received on the LTE uplink. The video analytics 
application processes the video data to detect and notify  
specific configurable events, e.g. object movement, lost child, 
abandoned luggage, etc. The application sends low bandwidth video 
metadata to the central operations and management server for database 
searches. Applications may range from safety, public security to smart 
cities. 
Figure 13.11. Example of video analytics 
13.4.4. Use case 4: RAN-aware content optimization 
In this use case, the application exposes accurate cell and 
subscriber radio interface information (cell load and link quality) to 
the content optimizer, enabling dynamic content optimization, 
improving QoE, network efficiency and enabling new service and 
revenue opportunities. Dynamic content optimization enhances video 
delivery through reduced stalling, reduced time-to-start and “best” 
video quality. Figure 13.12 displays an example of RAN-aware 
content optimization. The concept also enables enhanced use cases, 
such as promoted content delivery and subscriber throughput 
boosting.

Figure 13.12. Example of RAN-aware content optimization 
13.4.5. Use case 5: distributed content and DNS caching 
A distributed caching technology (as shown in Figure 13.13) can 
provide backhaul and transport savings and improved QoE. Content 
caching has the potential to reduce backhaul capacity requirements by 
up to 35%. Local Domain Name System caching can reduce web page 
download time by 20%.

case 
6: 
application-aware 
performance 
optimization 
Application-aware cell performance optimization for each device 
in real time can improve network efficiency and customer experience 
(see Figure 13.14). It can reduce videostalling and increase browsing 
throughput. Latency may also be significantly reduced. The solution 
can also provide independent metrics on application performance 
(video stalls, browsing throughput and latency) for enhanced network 
management and reporting.

13.4.7. MEC server placement 
The MEC server can be any distance from the terminal equipment. 
Figure 13.15 provides an overview of various options. The first would 
be to place the server in the user’s network equipment, i.e. in the 
Home enhanced NodeB. This case is very specific because the MEC 
server is small and replaces the WiFi broadband router or Home 
Gateway or Internet Box. The following placement is close to the 
antenna or base station. Several possibilities are offered to the 
operators such as next to the eNodeB or in the eNodeB. In the latter 
case, it is rather the opposite that occurs, the eNodeB is encapsulated 
into the MEC server. A final possibility which should be widely used 
by mobile operators is to put a very large MEC server in the RNC for 
integrating simultaneously the eNodeBs of multiple antennas. 
Management of the MEC servers is crucial for mobile operators. 
Much of the cost is at this level. Figure 13.16 describes an MEC 
server architecture and management. The server consists of three 
layers. The first is the hardware that supports the software 
environment. On this equipment is included a hypervisor that can 
support virtual machines. These virtual machines bring the various 
services requested to the MEC server. A first management system 
corresponds to this layer. This system has to take care of all the 
hardware infrastructure and virtualization layer.

The second part concerns the application platform for the MEC 
server. This platform supports all the functions required for the 
operation of user communications to the core network or to each other 
if they are located on the same server MEC. The platform operates 
RAN control functions, handover schemes, attachment structures, 
traffic control algorithms, call management and all necessary services 
to be offered to the customers. This layer of the MEC server is 
managed by a system that deals exclusively with this platform. 
The last part of the MEC server concerns the virtual machines 
themselves. These virtual machines support the functions described 
above. These virtual machines can be available permanently, but can 
also migrate from more central datacenters. Migration of virtual 
machines is important in power consumption and optimization 
services. A third system is vested in the management of these virtual 
machines. 
13.5. Conclusion 
MEC technologies are subject to strong development and should 
take much of the mobile network market. In fact, today the discussion 
focuses on the intelligence provided by the MEC servers. Mobile 
operators are pushing strongly toward an intelligence coming directly 
from the ECM server while network manufacturers are rather in favor 
of a distribution of the intelligence in intermediate equipment located 
between the terminal equipment and the MEC server. In the first case, 
it would be rather like the OpenFlow protocol that would be used and 
in the second case, the I2RS type of protocols could take over.

Conclusion 
Wireless and mobile networks are always changing. The move to 
5G will allow us to be in a world where everything is connected, 
always, everywhere. The flow of each client continues to grow 
steadily with new releases. The share of wireless connections will 
increase to 85% in 2020 counting the throughput of all the 
connections in the world from a terminal equipment. Wireless takes 
place inexorably of the wire. In 2020, we can consider that the wired 
access is disappearing and all users, objects, sensors, things are 
connected wirelessly. 
However, there are still problems to solve and they are relatively 
numerous. First, there is the problem for all human or machine 
connections which can cause power and saturation problems in 
relation to the IP world that generally requires rather a lot of energy. 
This means that new protocols appear that consume much less  
energy but require gateways to access the Internet. Second, 
everywhere there could be a problem, because if it is relatively simple 
to be connected in cities, connections are much more limited inside 
the buildings and in sparsely populated areas. Third, being connected 
always means a network availability with a very low failure rate and 
therefore duplications of infrastructure that greatly increase the global 
cost.

Finally, the impact of Cloud-based networking is modifying 
wireless networks since the user data and applications are stored in 
datacenters. The changes are going in four directions: 
– user data and applications are located in central datacenters. 
Over-the-top (OTT) content concerning delivery of audio, video and 
other media over the Internet is the main paradigm to be used; 
– telecommunication operators are moving toward centralized 
Mobile Edge Computing MEC servers, i.e. toward a distribution of 
data and applications in smaller datacenters closer to users but with a 
centralization on these small datacenters; 
– network manufacturers prefer to push intelligence and control 
schemes into their edge equipment, i.e. distributing data and 
applications in edge equipment; 
– finally, users see their terminal equipment becoming more 
powerful in order to ensure for themselves the control of their own 
data and applications. 
In summary, research continues and the struggle concerns the 
location of the control algorithms. The definition of future wireless 
network architectures is just beginning.
