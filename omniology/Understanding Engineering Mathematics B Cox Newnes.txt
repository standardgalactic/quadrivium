Preface
This book contains most of the material covered in a typical ﬁrst year mathematics course
in an engineering or science programme. It devotes Chapters 1–10 to consolidating the
foundations of basic algebra, elementary functions and calculus. Chapters 11–17 cover the
range of more advanced topics that are normally treated in the ﬁrst year, such as vectors
and matrices, differential equations, partial differentiation and transform methods.
With widening participation in higher education, broader school curricula and the wide
range of engineering programmes available, the challenges for both teachers and learners
in engineering mathematics are now considerable. As a result, a substantial part of many
ﬁrst year engineering programmes is dedicated to consolidation of the basic mathematics
material covered at pre-university level. However, individual students have widely varying
backgrounds in mathematics and it is difﬁcult for a single mathematics course to address
everyone’s needs. This book is designed to help with this by covering the basics in a
way that enables students and teachers to quickly identify the strengths and weaknesses of
individual students and ‘top up’ where necessary. The structure of the book is therefore
somewhat different to the conventional textbook, and ‘To the student’ provides some
suggestions on how to use it.
Throughout, emphasis is on the key mathematical techniques, covered largely in isolation
from the applications to avoid cluttering up the explanations. When you teach someone
to drive it is best to ﬁnd a quiet road somewhere for them to learn the basic techniques
before launching them out onto the High Street! In this book the mathematical techniques
are motivated by explaining where you may need them, and each chapter has a short
section giving typical applications. More motivational material will also be available on
the book web-site. Rigorous proof for its own sake is avoided, but most things are explained
sufﬁciently to give an understanding that the educated engineer should appreciate. Even
though you may use mathematics as a tool, it usually helps to have an idea of how and
why the tool works.
As the book progresses through the more advanced ﬁrst year material there is an
increasing expectation on the student to learn independently and ‘ﬁll in the gaps’ for
themselves – possibly with the teacher’s help. This is designed to help the student to
develop a mature, self-disciplined approach as they move from the supportive environ-
ment of pre-university to the more independent university environment. In addition the
book web-site (www.bh.com/companions/0750650982) will provide a developing resource
to supplement the book and to focus on speciﬁc engineering disciplines where appropriate.
In the years that this book has been in development I have beneﬁted from advice and
help from too many people to list. The following deserve special mention however. Dave
Hatter for having faith in the original idea and combining drink and incisive comment well
mixed in the local pub. Peter Jack for many useful discussions and for the best part of the
S(ketch) GRAPH acronym (I just supplied the humps and hollows). Val Tyas for typing

much of the manuscript, exploring the limits of RSI in the process, and coping cheerfully
with my continual changes. The late Lynn Burton for initial work on the manuscript and
diagrams. She was still ﬁddling with the diagrams only weeks before she succumbed to
cancer after a long and spirited ﬁght. I am especially indebted to her for her friendship
and inspiration – she would chuckle at that.
I also beneﬁted from an anonymous reviewer who went far beyond the call of duty
in providing meticulous, invaluable comment – It’s clear that (s)he is a good teacher. Of
course, any remaining errors are my responsibility.
The team at Butterworth-Heinemann did a wonderful job in dealing with a complicated
manuscript – sense of humour essential!
Last but not least I must mention the hundreds of students who have kept me in line
over the years. I have tried to write the book that would help most of them. I hope they,
and their successors, will be pleased with it.

To the Student
Whatever your previous background in mathematics, it is likely that when you begin your
engineering studies at university you will need to consolidate your mathematical skills
before moving on to new material. The ﬁrst ten chapters of this book are designed to help
with this ‘transition’ by providing you with individual pathways to quickly review your
current skills and understanding, then revise and reinforce where necessary.
Chapters 1–10 have a three-part structure by which you:
•
Review your present knowledge and skills, with a review test on key
topics
•
Revise as you need to
•
Reinforce the essential skills that you will need for your particular
programme, so that they are there when you need them.
The three sections are linked, so that you can choose your own pathway through the
material and focus on your speciﬁc needs. In the review test the single arrows forward
you to the corresponding revision section and the review question solution, while the
double arrows fast forward you to the reinforcement exercises.
Some suggestions for working through these chapters may help:
•
Use the lists of prerequisites and objectives to get an overview of the
chapter – what have you seen before, what needs a reminder, what is
completely new?
•
Use the review test to establish your current understanding of the various
topics.
•
Where you are conﬁdent you may still be able to learn something from
the revision section or polish your skills by working through the rein-
forcement questions.
•
Where you are unsure and need a reminder, go to the relevant revise
section for some hints before trying the review question, then consoli-
date your skills with the reinforcement exercises.
•
Where the topic is perhaps new to you, start with the revision section,
using the review questions as worked examples and the reinforcement
exercises as further practice.
The remaining chapters (11–17), covering material appropriate to typical ﬁrst-year courses
in engineering mathematics, are designed to support you in developing independent
learning skills for more advanced study. The order of material and the structure of these
chapters are at ﬁrst supportive with many examples, then gradually progress to a more
concise and mature format. The focus is on the key material, and the text contains leading
xi

T o
t h e
S t u d e n t
problems that encourage you to develop ideas for yourself. The structure of the book is
therefore designed not only to ease the transition to university, but also to develop your
independent learning skills and prepare you for the style of more advanced textbooks.
Each chapter has a number of ‘Applications’ exercises that provide illustrations of typical
engineering applications, bring together the different topics of the chapter, or prepare the
way for later material. Some are simple, while others provide signiﬁcant and challenging
projects.
The book is the core of a larger educational resource of web-based mate-
rial
enabling
you
to
broaden
and
deepen
your
studies.
The
book
web-site
(www.bh.com/companions/0750650982) provides advice on learning mathematics, solu-
tions to all of the reinforcement and applications exercises, develops some topics more
thoroughly, and provides relevant examples and illustrations from different engineering
disciplines.

A note about calculators
Calculators obviously have their place, particularly in applied mathematics, numerical
methods and statistics. However, they are very rarely needed in this chapter, and the skills
it aims to develop are better learnt without them.

1.2.1 Types of numbers
➤

27 ➤
Numbers can be classiﬁed into different types:
•
natural numbers
•
zero
•
directed numbers
•
integers
•
rational numbers (fractions)
•
irrational numbers
•
real numbers
•
complex numbers (➤Chapter 12).
The counting numbers
1, 2, 3, 4, . . .
are called natural numbers.
Zero, 0, is really in a class of its own – we always have to be careful with it. It is an
integer and also, of course, a real number. Essentially, zero enables us to deﬁne negative
numbers. Thus, the negative of 3 is the number denoted n = −3 satisfying
3 + n = 0
This enables us to ‘count in opposite directions’ using directed or negative numbers
−1, −2, −3, −4, . . .
The full set of numbers
{. . . −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .}
is called the set of integers.
Numbers that can be written in the form:
integer
non-zero integer

e.g. 3
4, −1

including integers, such as 6 = 6

5

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
are called rational numbers or fractions. All measurements of a physical nature (length,
time, voltage, etc.) can only be expressed in terms of such numbers. Numbers which are
not rational, and cannot be expressed as ratios of integers, are called irrational numbers.
Examples are
√
2 and π. We will prove that
√
2 is irrational in Chapter 14.
The set of all numbers: integers, rational and irrationals is called the set of real numbers.
It can be shown that together these numbers can be used to ‘label’ every point on a
continuous inﬁnite line – the real line. So called ‘complex numbers’ are really equivalent
to pairs of real numbers. They are studied in Chapter 12, and an introduction is provided

Note that zero, 0, is an exceptional number in that one cannot divide by it. It is not that
1/0 is ‘inﬁnity’, but simply that it does not exist at all. Inﬁnity, denoted ∞, is not really
a number. It is a concept that indicates that no matter what positive (negative) number
you choose, you can always ﬁnd another positive (negative) number greater (less) than it.
Crudely, ∞denotes a ‘number’ that is as large as we wish.
Solution to review question 1.1.1
A. All numbers here are real, so d applies to them all.
(i) −1 is a negative natural number, i.e. an integer; (a, b, c, d)

1
2 is a ratio of integers and is therefore rational; (c, d)
(iii) 0 is an integer – the only one that is its own negative; (a, c, d)
(iv) 7 is a natural number and an integer. It is in fact also a prime
number – that is, only divisible by itself or 1 (Section 1.2.3). It is

100
sometimes called a decimal fraction, but usually simply a decimal
(Section 1.2.8); (c, d, f)
(viii) 11 is a natural number and an integer – like 7 it is also prime,
and is also odd as any prime greater than 2 must be; (a, c, d, g)
(ix) 8 is another natural number and integer – but it is not prime,
since it can be written as 2 × 2 × 2 = 23 (Section 1.2.7). It is
also an even number; (a, c, d)
(x) The square root of 2,

(vi) 0 −1 = −1, negative, ﬁnite, non-zero (c, e, f).
(vii)

0 does not exist (you can’t ‘cancel’ the zeros!). It is not inﬁnite,
negative, zero, ﬁnite or non-zero – it just does not exist (b).
(viii) Because of the 3
0 the expression 3 × 0 + 3
0 does not exist (b).
(ix) 03
0 again, does not exist (b).
(x)

2 = 1 – no problem here, ﬁnite and non-zero (e, f).
Note that none of the numbers in B is referred to as ‘inﬁnite’.
1.2.2 Use of inequality signs
➤
2
27 ➤
The real numbers are ordered. That is, we can always say whether one number a is
less than, equal to, or greater than another given number b. To denote this we use the
‘comparator’ symbols or inequalities, < and ≤, > and ≥. a > b means a is greater than
b; a < b means a is less than b. Thus 6 > 5, 4 < 5. a ≥b means a is greater than or
equal to b, and similarly a ≤b means a is less than or equal to b. Be very careful to
distinguish between, for example a > b and a ≥b. Sometimes it is also useful to use the
‘not equal to’ symbol, ̸=.
Care is needed when changing signs and forming reciprocals with inequalities. For
example, if a > b > 0, then −a < −b and 1
a < 1
b. However, if a > 0 > b then −a < −b
is still true, but 1
a > 1
b. Try a few numerical examples to check these statements. Most

of us ﬁnd inequalities difﬁcult to handle and they require a lot of practice. However,
in this book we will need only the basic properties of inequalities. We will say more
about inequalities in Section 3.2.6.
Often we wish to refer to the positive or absolute value of a number x (for example in
a rectiﬁed sine wave). We denote this by the modulus of x, |x|. For example
| −4| = 4
By deﬁnition |x| is never negative, so |x| ≥0. Also, note that |x| < a means −a < x < a.
For example:
|x| < 3
means
−3 < x < 3
Solution to review question 1.1.2
(i) ‘x is a positive non-zero number’ is expressed by x > 0
(ii) ‘x lies strictly between 1 and 2’ is expressed by 1 < x < 2
(iii) ‘x lies strictly between −1 and 3’ is expressed by −1 < x < 3
(iv) ‘x is equal to or greater than −2 and is less than 2’ is expressed by
−2 ≤x < 2
(v) If the absolute value of x is less than 2 then this means that if x
is positive then 0 ≤x < 2, but if x is negative then we must have
−2 < x ≤0. So, combining these we must have −2 < x < 2. This
can also be expressed in terms of the modulus as |x| < 2.
1.2.3 Highest common factor and lowest common multiple
➤
3
28 ➤
A prime number is a positive integer which cannot be expressed as a product of two or
more smaller distinct positive integers. That is, a prime number cannot be divided exactly
by any integer other than 1 or itself. From the deﬁnition, 1 is not a prime number. 6, for
example, is not a prime, since it can be written as 2 × 3. The numbers 2 and 3 are called
its (prime) factors. Another way of deﬁning a prime number is to say that it is has no
integer factors other than 1 and itself.
There are an inﬁnite number of prime numbers:
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, . . .
but no formula for the nth prime has been discovered. Prime numbers are very important
in the theory of codes and cryptography. They are also the ‘building blocks’ of numbers,
since any given integer can be written uniquely as a product of primes:
12 = 2 × 2 × 3 = 223
This is called factorising the integer into its prime factors. It is an important operation,
for example, in combining fractions.

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
The highest common factor (HCF) of a set of integers is the largest integer which is
a factor of all numbers of the set. For small numbers we can ﬁnd the HCF ‘by inspec-
tion’ – splitting the numbers into prime factors and constructing products of these primes
that divide each number of the set, choosing the largest such product.
The lowest common multiple (LCM) of a set of integers is the smallest integer which
is a multiple of all integers in the set. It can again be found by prime factorisation of
the numbers. In this book you will only need to use the LCM in combining fractions and
only for small, manageable numbers, so the LCM will usually be obvious ‘by inspection’.
In such cases one can normally guess the answer by looking at the prime factors of the
numbers, and then check that each number divides the guess exactly.
Solution to review question 1.1.3
A.
(i) 15 = 3 × 5
(ii) 21 = 3 × 7
(iii) 60 = 3 × 20 = 3 × 4 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 22 × 3 × 5
(iv) 121 = 11 × 11
(v) 405 = 5 × 81 = 5 × 9 × 9 = 5 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3 = 34 × 5
(vi) 1024 = 4 × 256 = 4 × 16 × 16
= 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
× 2 × 2 × 2
= 210 (or, anticipating the rules of indices = 45 = (22)5 =
210)
(vii) 221 = 13 × 17
Notice that there may be more than one way of factorising, but that
the ﬁnal result is always the same. You may also have noticed that it
gets increasingly difﬁcult to factorise, compared to multiplying – thus
in (vii), it is so much easier to multiply 13 × 17 than to discover
these factors from 221. This fact is actually the key idea behind many
powerful coding systems – the trap-door principle – in some cases it
is much easier doing a mathematical operation than undoing it!
B.
(i) 24, 30. In this case it is clear that the largest integer that exactly
divides these two is 6 and so the HCF of 24 and 30 is 6.
(ii) 27, 99. Again the fairly obvious answer here is 9.
(iii) 28, 98. Perhaps not so obvious, so split each into prime factors:
28 = 4 × 7 = 2 × 2 × 7
98 = 2 × 49 = 2 × 7 × 7
from which we see that the HCF is 2 × 7 = 14.
(iv) 12, 54, 78. Splitting into prime factors will again give the answer
here, but notice a short cut: 2 clearly divides them all, leaving 6,
27, 39. 3 divides all of these leaving 2, 9, 13. These clearly have
no factors in common (except 1) and so we are done, and the HCF
is 2 × 3 = 6.
9

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(v) 3, 6, 15, 27. Here 3 is the only number that divides them all and
is the HCF in this case.
C.
(i) Since 3, 7 are both primes, the LCM is simply their product, 21.
(ii) 9 = 3 × 3, so 3 and 9 both divide 9 and there is no smaller number
that does so. The LCM is thus 9.
(iii) Since 3 × 12 = 36 and 2 × 18 = 36, we see directly that the LCM
is 36.
(iv) We have to deal with 3, 5, and 9 = 32. The LCM must contain at
least two factors of 3 and one of 5. So the LCM is 5 × 32 = 45.
(v) 2, 4, 6. 2 divides 4, so we must have a factor of 4 in the LCM.
Also, 4 and 6 both divide 12, but no smaller number and so the
LCM is 12.
1.2.4 Manipulation of numbers
➤
3
28 ➤
Much of arithmetic is based on just a few operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division, satisfying a small number of rules. The extension of these rules to include
symbols as well as numbers leads us on to algebra (Chapter 2).
Addition, denoted +, produces the sum of two numbers:
6 + 3 = 9 = 3 + 6
(addition is ‘commutative’)
Subtraction, denoted −, produces the difference of two numbers:
6 −3 = 3 = −(3 −6)
(minus sign changes signs in brackets)
Multiplication, denoted by a × b or simply as ab in algebra, produces the product of
two numbers:
6 × 3 = (6)(3) = 18 = 3 × 6
(multiplication is commutative)
a · b is sometimes used to denote the product but can be confused with decimal notation
in arithmetic.
Division, denoted by a ÷ b or a/b or, better, a
b , produces the quotient of two numbers:
6 ÷ 3 = 6/3 = 6
3 = 2
(of course, 6 ÷ 3 ̸= 3 ÷ 6!)
Note that ÷ and / are very rarely used in written calculations, where we use the form
6
3 unless we need to call into play ÷ or / because we have a large number of divisions.
Also notice how we have simpliﬁed the quotient to 2. We always simplify such fractions
to lowest form whenever we can (➤12).
The way the above and other arithmetic operations are combined is according to a set
of conventional precedences – the rules of arithmetic. Thus we always perform multi-
plication before addition, so:
2 × 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11
10

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Brackets can be used if we want to override such rules. For example:
2 × (3 + 5) = 2 × 8 = 16
In general, an arithmetic expression, containing numbers, ( ), x, ÷, +, −, must be
evaluated according to the following priorities:
BODMAS
Brackets ( )
ﬁrst
Of (as in ‘fraction of’ −rarely used these days)
Division ÷

second
Multiplication ×
Addition +

third
Subtraction −
If an expression contains only multiplication and division we work from left to right. If
it contains only addition and subtraction we again work from left to right. If an expression
contains powers or indices (Section 1.2.7) then these are evaluated after any brackets.
Products and quotients of negative numbers can be obtained using the following rules:
(+1)(+1) = +1
(+1)(−1) = −1
(−1)(+1) = −1
(−1)(−1) = +1
1
(−1) = −1
For example (−2)(−3) = (−1)(−1)6 = 6
Note that if you evaluate expressions on your calculator, it may not follow the BODMAS
order, simply because of the way your calculator operates. However, BODMAS is the
universal convention in Western mathematics and applies equally well to algebra, as we
will see in Chapter 2.
Solution to review question 1.1.4
Following the BODMAS rule
(i) 2 + 3 −7 = 5 −7 = −2
(ii) 4 × 3 ÷ 2 = 12 ÷ 2 = 6
(iii) 3 + 2 × 5 = 3 + 10 = 13
(iv) (3 + 2) × 5 = 5 × 5 = 25
(v) 3 + (2 × 5) = 3 + 10 = 13. In this case the brackets are actually
unnecessary, since the BODMAS rules tell us to evaluate the multi-
plication ﬁrst.
(vi) 18 ÷ 2 × 3 = 9 × 3 = 27 following the convention of working from
left to right.
(vii) 18 ÷ (2 × 3) = 18 ÷ 6 = 3 because the brackets override the left to
right rule.

Notice the care taken in these examples, spelling out each step.
This may seem to be a bit laboured, but I would encourage you
to take similar care, particularly when we come to algebra. Slips
with brackets and signs crop up frequently in most people’s calcula-
tions (mine included!). Whereas this may only lose you one or two
marks in an exam, in real life, an error in sign can convert a stable
control system into an unstable one, or a healthy bank balance into
an overdraft.
1.2.5 Handling fractions
➤
3
28 ➤
A fraction or rational number is any quantity of the form
m
n
n ̸= 0
where m, n are integers but n is not equal to 0. It is of course essential that n ̸= 0, because
as noted in Section 1.2.1 division by zero is not deﬁned.
m is called the numerator
n is the denominator
If m ≥n the fraction is said to be improper, and if m < n it is proper.
A number expressed in the form 2 1
2 (meaning 2 + 1
2) is called a mixed fraction. In
mathematical expressions it is best to avoid this form altogether and write it as a vulgar
fraction, 5
2, instead, otherwise it might be mistaken for ‘2 × 1
2 = 1’, and it is also more
difﬁcult to do calculations such as multiplication and division using mixed fractions.
The numerator and denominator of a fraction may have common factors. These may be
cancelled to reduce the fraction to its simplest or ‘lowest’ form:
6
12 = 2 × 3
3 × 4 = 2
4 = 1 × 2
2 × 2 = 1
2
Each of these forms are equivalent fractions, but clearly the last one is the simplest.
However, sometimes one of the other forms may be convenient for particular purposes,
such as adding fractions. A very common fraction where we tend not to cancel down in
12

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
this way is the percentage. Thus we usually express 32/100 as ‘32 percent’ rather than as
its equivalent, ‘8 out of 25’!
Fractions are multiplied ‘top by top and bottom by bottom’ as you might expect:
m
n × p
q = mp
nq
(n, q ̸= 0)
e.g. 3
2 × 5
11 = 15
22
with p and q also any integers. There may, of course, be common factors to cancel down,
as for example in
3
2 × 6
7 = 9
7
The inverse or reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by turning it upside down:
1
	 
m
n

= n
m
e.g. 1
	 3
2

= 2
3
where both m and n must be non-zero. So dividing by a vulgar fraction is done by inverting
it and multiplying:
p
q

÷

m
n

=
p
q
 	 
m
n

= p
q × n
m = np
mq
e.g.
7
2 ÷ 14
6 = 7
2 × 6
14 = 3
2
Multiplication and division of fractions are therefore quite simple. Addition and subtrac-
tion are less so.
Two fractions with the same denominator are easily added or subtracted:
m
n ± p
n = m ± p
n
e.g. 3
2 −1
2 = 3 −1
2
= 2
2 = 1
So to add and subtract fractions in general we rewrite them all with the same common
denominator, which is the lowest common multiple of all the denominators. For example
3
4 −4
3 = 3 × 3
12
−4 × 4
12
= 9 −16
12
= −7
12
In the example, 12 is the LCM of 3 and 4.
An electrical example – resistances in parallel
Three resistances R1, R2, R3 connected in parallel are equivalent to a single resistance R
given by
1
R = 1
R1
+ 1
R2
+ 1
R3
So, for example if R1 = 2, R2 = 1
2, R3 = 3
2 then
1
R = 1
2 + 2 + 2
3 (units of inverse ohms)
13

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
or, with 6 the LCM of 2 and 3
= 3
6 + 12
6 + 4
6 = 19
6 (−1)
and so the equivalent resistance is
R = 6
19 
Finally, on fractions, recall the ideas of ratio and proportion. These are met early in
our mathematical education, yet often continue to confuse us later in life. Speciﬁcally, it
is not uncommon to see someone make errors such as:
‘ a
b = 1
3 means a = 1 and b = 3’
so it is worth having a quick review of this topic.
The notation a : b is used to indicate that the numbers a and b are in a certain ratio or
proportionality to each other.
a : b = 1 : 3
simply means that
a
b = 1
3
and this most certainly does not mean a = 1 and b = 3. For example
3 : 9 = 2 : 6 = 7 : 21 = 1 : 3
All a : b = 1 : 3 means is that
a = b
3
i.e. a is a third of b. If we are given a (or b) then we can ﬁnd b (or a). The review
question illustrates this.
In general, if we can write a = kb where k is some given constant then we say ‘a is
proportional to b’ and write this as a ∝b. a and b are then in the ratio a : b = 1 : k. On
the other hand if we can write a = k/b then we say ‘a is inversely proportional to b’ and
write a ∝1/b.

1.2.6 Factorial and combinatorial notation – permutations
and combinations
➤
4
29 ➤
The factorial notation is a shorthand for a commonly-occurring expression involving posi-
tive integers. It provides some nice practice in manipulation of numbers and fractions, and
gently introduces algebraic ideas. If n is some positive integer ≥1 then we write
n! = n(n −1)(n −2) . . . 2 × 1
read as ‘n factorial’. For example
5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
Notice that the factorial expression yields large values very quickly, that is n! increases
rapidly with n. In calculations involving factorials it is often useful to remember such
results as
10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7!
i.e. we can pick out a lower factorial if this is convenient, and this often helps with
cancellations in expressions containing factorials.
Note that 1! = 1. Also, while the above deﬁnition does not deﬁne 0!, the convention is
adopted that
0! = 1
The factorial notation is useful in the binomial theorem (➤71) and in statistics. It can be
used to count the number permutations of n objects, i.e. the number of ways of arranging
n objects in a given order:
First object can be chosen in n ways
Second object can be chosen in (n −1) ways
Third object can be chosen in (n −2) ways
...
Last object can only be chosen in 1 way.
So the total number of permutations of n objects is
n × (n −1) × (n −2) . . . 2 × 1 = n!
Note that n! = n × (n −1)!
For 3 objects A, B, C, for example, there are 3! = 6 permutations, which are:
ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA.
16

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Each of these is the same combination of the objects A, B, C – that is a selection of
three objects in which order is not important.
Now suppose we select just r objects from the n. Each such selection is a different
combination of r objects from n. An obvious question is how many different permutations
of r objects chosen from n can be formed in this way? This number is denoted by nPr.
It may be evaluated by repeating the previous counting procedure, but only until we have
chosen r objects:
The ﬁrst may be chosen in n ways
The second may be chosen in (n −1) ways
The third may be chosen in (n −2) ways
...
The rth may be chosen in (n −(r −1)) ways
So the total number of permutations will be
nPr = n × (n −1) × (n −2) × . . . × (n −r + 1)
= n(n −1)(n −2) . . . (n −r + 1)(n −r)(n −r −1) . . . 2 × 1
(n −r)(n −r −1) . . . 2 × 1
=
n!
(n −r)!
For example the number of ways that we can permute 3 objects chosen from 5 distinct
objects is
5P3 = 5 × 4 × 3 = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1
2 × 1
=
5!

1.2.7 Powers and indices
➤
4
29 ➤
Powers, or indices, provide, in the ﬁrst instance, a shorthand notation for multiplying a
number by itself a given number of times:
2 × 2 = 22
2 × 2 × 2 = 23
2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 24
etc.
For a given number a we have
an = a × a × a × . . . × a



n times
a is called the base, n the power or index. a1 is simply a. By convention we take a0 = 1
(a ̸= 0). We introduce a−1 to denote the reciprocal 1
a , since then 1 = a × 1
a = a1 × 1
a =
a1 × a−1 = a1−1 = a0 follows. In general, a−n = 1
an . From these deﬁnitions we can derive
the rules of indices:
am × an = am+n
18

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
am
an = am−n
(am)n = amn
(ab)n = anbn
Note that for any index n, 1n = 1.
Examples
23 × 24 = 23+4 = 27
35 × 30 = 35
(52)3 = 56
(22)0 = 20 = 1
43/22 = (22)3/22 = 26/22 = 24
A square root of a positive number a, is any number that, when squared, yields the
number a. We use √a to denote the positive value of the square root (although the notation
has to be stretched when we get to complex numbers). For example
2 =
√
4
since 22 = 4
Since −2 = −
√
4 also satisﬁes (−2)2 = 4, −
√
4 is also a square root of 4. So the square
roots of 4 are ±
√
4 = ±2.
We can similarly have cube roots of a number a, which yield a when they are cubed.
If a is positive then
3√a denotes the positive value of the cube root. For example
2 =
3√
8
because 23 = 8
In the case of taking an odd root of a negative number the convention is to let √
denote the negative root value, as in
3√
−8 = −2, for example.
The corresponding nth root of a number a is denoted in general by
n√a
(also called a radical)
If n is even then a must be positive to yield a real root (
√
−1 is an imaginary number,
forming the basis of complex numbers, see Chapter 12). In this case, because (−1)2 = 1,
there will be at least two values for the root differing only by sign. If n is odd then the
nth root
n√a exists for both positive and negative values of a, as in
3√−8 = −2 above.
If a is a prime number such as 2, then √a is an irrational number, i.e. it can’t be
expressed in rational form as a ratio of integers (6
➤
). This is not just a mathematical
nicety.
√
2 for example, is the diagonal of the unit square, and yet because it is irrational,
it can never be written down exactly as a rational number or fraction (
√
2 = 1.4142 is,
for example, only an approximation to
√
2 to four decimal places).
In terms of indices, roots are represented by fractional indices, for example:
√a = a
1
2
19

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
and in general
n√a = a
1
n
This ﬁts in with the rules of indices, since

a
1
n
n
= a
1
n ×n = a1 = a
Fractional powers satisfy the same rules of indices as integer powers – but there are
some new features:
•
multiplicity of roots: 22 = (−2)2 = 4
•
non-existence of certain roots of negative numbers: √−1 is not a real
number
•
irrational values for roots of primes and their multiples:
√
2 cannot be
expressed as a fraction
Quantities such as
√
2,
√
3, . . . containing square roots of primes, are called surds. The
term originates from the Greek word for mute, referring to a number that cannot ‘speak’ its
value – because its decimal part never ends (see Section 1.2.8). In mathematical manipu-
lation surds are always best left as they are – retaining the root sign. Any decimal form for
them will simply be an approximation as noted for
√
2 above. Usually we try to manipulate
surds so that the result is the simplest form, and none remain in denominators (although
we would normally write, for example, sin 45° =
1
√
2
). To do this we can use the rules of
indices, and also a process known as rationalisation, in which surds in denominators are
moved to the numerator. The ideas are illustrated in the solution to the review question.

1.2.8 Decimal notation
➤
4
30 ➤
You probably know that 1
2 may be represented by the decimal 0.5, 1
4 by 0.25 and so on.
In fact any real number, a, 0 ≤a < 1, has a decimal representation, written
a = 0.d1d2d3 . . .
where each di is one of the digits 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9, and the sequence may not terminate (see
below). The term decimal actually refers to the base 10 and represents the fact that:
a = d1 × 10−1 + d2 × 10−2 + d3 × 10−3 . . .
Note the importance of ‘place value’ here – the value of each of the digits depends on
its place in the decimal.
Any real number can be represented by an integer part and such a decimal part. If,
from some point on the decimal consists of a repeating string of one or more digits, then
the decimal is said to be a repeating or recurring decimal. All rational numbers can
be represented by a ﬁnite decimal representation or a recurring one. Irrational numbers
cannot be represented in this way as a terminating or recurring decimal – thus the decimal
22

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
representation of
√
2 is non-terminating:
√
2 = 1.4142135623 . . .
that is, the decimal part goes on forever.
All quantities measured in scientiﬁc or engineering experiments will have a ﬁnite
decimal – every human observation of any kind is subject to a limited accuracy and so
to a limited number of decimal places. Similarly any mechanical or electronic device can
only yield a terminating decimal representation with a ﬁnite number of decimal places. In
particular any number that you output on your calculator must represent a ﬁnite or recur-
ring decimal – a rational number. So, for example no calculator or computer could ever
yield the exact value of
√
2 or π. In practice even the most ﬁnicky engineer has limited
need for decimal places – it can be shown that to measure the circumference of a circle
girdling the known universe with an error no greater than the radius of a hydrogen atom
requires the value of π to only 39 decimal places. π is actually known to many millions of
decimal places. Nevertheless, irrational numbers such as
√
2,
√
3 actually occur frequently
in engineering calculations, so we have to learn to handle them. 1/
√
2 occurs for example
in the rms value of an alternating current.
A useful way of expressing numerical value is by specifying a certain number of signiﬁcant
digits. To discuss these we need to be clear about zeros in numbers and what they represent.
Some zeros are needed in a number simply as place holders – i.e. to tell us whether we are
dealing with units, tens, hundreds, or tenths, hundredths, etc. For example in
1500, 0.00230, 2.1030
the bold zeros are essential to hold place value – the only way to avoid them is to write the
number in scientiﬁc notation (see below). The underlined zeros in these numbers are not
strictly necessary and should only be included if they are signiﬁcant – i.e. they represent a
level of accuracy. For example if the number 1.24 is only accurate to the three ‘signiﬁcant
ﬁgures’ given then it could lie between 1.235 and 1.245. But if we write 1.240 then we are
saying that there are four signiﬁcant ﬁgures of accuracy and the number must lie between
1.2395 and 1.2405. The two end zeros in 1500 may or may not represent an accuracy to four
ﬁgures – we have no way of knowing without further information. Therefore unless you
are given further information, such zeros are assumed to be not signiﬁcant. Similarly, the
two ﬁrst zeros in 0.002320 are assumed to be not signiﬁcant – they are just place holders.
To count the number of signiﬁcant ﬁgures in a number, start from the ﬁrst non-zero
digit on the left and count all digits (zero or not) to the right, counting ﬁnal zeros if
they are to the right of the decimal point, but not otherwise. Final zeros to the left of the
decimal point are assumed not signiﬁcant unless more information is given.
Examples
3.214 (4 sf), 2.041 (4 sf), 12.03500 (7 sf), 420 (2 sf), 0.003 (1 sf), 0.0801 (3 sf), 2.030
(4 sf), 500.00 (5 sf)
Sometimes numbers are approximated by terminating the digits after a given number
of digits and replacing them with zeros. If this is done with no regard to the size of the
removed digits, then we say the number has been ‘chopped’ or ‘truncated’. For example
324829.1 chopped to 3 signiﬁcant ﬁgures is 324000. Another, more accurate, method of
approximation is ‘rounding’, in which we take account of the size of the removed digits.
23

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
When we ‘round’ a number we change the last non-zero digit not removed according to
the size of the digits dropped. Speciﬁcally:
•
If the digit to be removed is >5 then the immediately preceding digit
is increased by 1
•
If the digit to be removed is <5 the immediately preceding digit is left
unchanged
•
If the digit to be removed is equal to 5 then you may round up or
down – one ‘fair’ way to do this is to round up if the previous digit is
odd and down otherwise, for example.
Although ‘chopping’ may seem to give bigger errors because, for example, 324829.1 is
closer to 325000 than 324000, it is usually the preferred method in computer arithmetic
because it is much quicker than the more accurate ‘rounding’.
Examples
213.457 chopped/rounded to 4 sf is 213.4/213.5, 56.0011 chopped/rounded to 4 sf is
56.00/56.00
We often need to convert between fractions and decimal representations. We can go from
fraction to decimal by ordinary division. Conversely, we can convert a terminating decimal
to the corresponding rational number by multiplying top and bottom by an appropriate
factor as in, for example
0.625 = 625
1000 = 25
40 = 5
8
Any decimal number can be written as a decimal number between 1 and 10 (the
mantissa) multiplied by an appropriate power (the exponent) of 10. For example:
74.932 = 7.4932 × 10
mantissa = 7.4932
exponent = 1
The purpose of such representation, called scientiﬁc notation, is to reduce very large
and very small numbers to manageable form. For example
573000000000000000 = 5.73 × 1017
0.0000000000000000000137 = 1.37 × 10−20
In engineering there is a variation on scientiﬁc notation that uses only multiples of 3
as exponents, i.e. as powers of 10. This is so that we can use the standard preﬁxes kilo,
mega, micro, nano, etc.

calculator, or we need to get a rough order of magnitude check on a messy calculation. In
such situations the engineer’s most powerful tool has always been an ability to mentally
estimate quantities and perform quick ‘back of the envelope’ (we still have them, despite
email!) calculations. The trick is to approximate the numbers you are dealing with so
that the calculations become simple, yet some sort of rough accuracy is retained. It is a
matter of judgement and practice. Absolute values of numbers are less important than their
relative values – for example 1021 is signiﬁcant in
3 × 1021 + 40 × 234
but is relatively insigniﬁcant in
1021

an appropriate order of magnitude, rounding as necessary, then perform the (hopefully)

Figure 1.1
The equivalent resistance, R, of two resistors R1 and R2 in series is the sum of their
resistances:
R = R1 + R2
31

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
The reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is equal to the
sum of their reciprocals:
1
R = 1
R1
+ 1
R2
(see Section 1.2.5)
(a) If, in the circuit of Figure 1.1, R1 = 1, R2 = 2, R3 = 3 determine the overall
equivalent resistance of the circuit, working entirely with fractions.
(b) Repeat the calculation using three decimal places accuracy and compare your result
with (a).
(c) Suppose now that R2 is not ﬁxed, but can vary. Obtain the equivalent resistance in
terms of R2 using exact fractions.
(d) Using the result of (c), plot a graph of the equivalent resistance R for integer values
of R2 from 1 to 10.
(e) Discuss the calculations and results of (c), (d) in the light of the need to plot a
useful graph.
(f) If we wish to increase slightly the equivalent resistance above that when R2 = 2
what should we do with R2, increase or decrease it?

2.2.1 Multiplication of linear expressions
➤
38
73 ➤
Algebra is the branch of mathematics that generalises arithmetic by using symbols as well
as numbers. Symbols, such as x, y, a, b, may represent any numbers, but there are certain
conventions used which are useful to know: letters from the beginning of the alphabet:
a, b, c, . . . usually represent constants – quantities having a ﬁxed value; letters from the
middle of the alphabet . . . l, m, n, . . . usually represent whole numbers or integers; letters
from the end of the alphabet . . . x, y, z usually represent variables, which may take a range
of values. As mathematics becomes more advanced we need more symbols and the Greek
alphabet is pressed into service – you have already seen an example in π, the Greek p.
An algebraic expression is any quantity built up from such a ﬁnite number of symbols
using only the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.
This includes integer powers which are simply successive multiplication, and roots of
variables, such as √x.
Examples
x + y,
a + 2b
a −b ,
x2 + 2x + 3,
√
t +
1
√
t −1
are all algebraic expressions, in the symbols indicated. Be careful to distinguish between
an algebraic expression, such as x2 −1, and an algebraic equation such as x2 −1 = 0.
An expression tells you nothing about the variables involved, it stands alone, whereas an
equation can ﬁx the values of the variables.
Most of the expressions we will deal with in fact contain just one variable – called
functions of a single variable – which is traditionally, but not exclusively, denoted by x.
The simplest example is the linear expression in x such as 2x + 3 (called linear because
its graph is a straight line (➤212), or in general
ax + b
where a and b are given constants. If the use of symbols a, b to represent constants worries
you, just think of them as numbers such as 2, 3, etc.
40

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Another important example is a quadratic expression in x such as 2x2 + 7x −4, of
general form
ax2 + bx + c
where a, b, c are again ‘constants’, independent of x.
In order to use algebra for more advanced topics such as factorisation or partial fractions,
we need to be able to perform multiplication of simple algebraic expressions quickly and
accurately. The key to this is dealing with multiplication of bracket expressions such as
(a + b)(c + d). All you need for this is to know that the expression a(c + d) is ‘expanded’
by multiplying c and d by a:
a(c + d) = ac + ad
This is called the distributive rule: we say ‘multiplication distributes over addition’.
Real numbers also satisfy the associative rule a(bc) = (ab)c and the commutative rule
ab = ba. Another useful property of real numbers is that if ab = 0 then one or both of a,
b must be zero. Note that these statements are rules of algebra, which will not necessarily
hold for algebras not based on the real numbers – for example the commutative law does
not hold in matrix algebra, the subject of Chapter 13. However, given these rules we can
use them to handle more complicated expressions. For example, we can now expand out
any number of bracket expressions.
Examples
(a + b)(c + d) = (a + b)c + (a + b)d
= ac + bc + ad + bd
(3x + 2)(x −1) = (3x + 2)x + (3x + 2)(−1)
= 3x2 + 2x −3x −2
= 3x2 −x −2
Note the collection of the ‘like’ terms, 2x −3x = −x. You should always tidy up
calculations in this way.
Always be careful with the treatment of signs and brackets, particularly when they are
mixed. If in doubt leave minus signs bracketed:
(−1)(x −1) = (−1)x −(−1)1
= −x + 1
Never omit brackets out of laziness.
Later you will need to reverse some of the above operations. For example, you could
be given ac + bc + ad + bd and asked to ‘factorise’ it – that is, convert it to the form
(a + b)(c + d). This is much easier to do if you are highly proﬁcient at multiplying such
expressions in the ﬁrst place – to do something ‘standing on your head’ it helps if you can
do it the right way up ﬁrst!! There is only one way to achieve this proﬁciency – practice,
so try the reinforcement exercises until you are conﬁdent.

Two very important special cases of products of linear expressions are
(a −b)(a + b) = a2 −b2
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
You should know these backwards – literally, given either side you should immediately
be able to write down the other side.

Solution to review question 2.1.1
(i) You just need to be careful with signs here. Take your time until you
are fully conﬁdent:
−(x −3) = (−1)(x −3) = (−1)x −(−1)3
= −x + 3
(ii) 2x(x −1) = 2x × x −2x = 2x2 −2x
(iii) Here you have to remember to collect terms together at the end. We
have
(a −3)(2a −4) = a(2a −4) −3(2a −4)
= 2a2 −4a −6a + 12
= 2a2 −10a + 12
(iv) (t −3)(t + 3) = t2 + 3t −3t −32
= t2 −9
This is just the difference of two squares result. Practice this until
you can miss out the intermediate step.
(v) (u −2)2 = (u + (−2))2 = u2 + 2(−2)u + (−2)2
= u2 −4u + 4
Again, this square of a linear term is so important that you should
practice it until you are able to jump the intermediate steps and able
to go from ‘right to left’ just as proﬁciently.

2.2.2 Polynomials
➤
38
74 ➤
A monomial is an algebraic expression consisting of a single term, such as 3x, while a
binomial consists of a sum of two terms, such as x + 3y. A polynomial is an algebraic
expression consisting of a sum of terms each of which is a product of a constant and
one or more variables raised to a non-negative integer power. An example with a single
variable, x, is
x3 −2x2 + x + 4
and the general form of a polynomial in x is written:
pn(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + an−2xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0
where the ai, i = 0, 1, . . . , n are given numbers called the coefﬁcients of the polynomial.
We use pn(x) to denote a polynomial in x of degree n. The notation ai is often used
when we have a list of quantities to describe – i is called the subscript. If n is the highest
power that occurs, as in the above, and if an ̸= 0, then we say that the polynomial is of
nth degree. An important property of a polynomial in x is that it exists (i.e. has a deﬁnite
value) for every possible value of x.
A polynomial of degree zero is simply a constant:
p0(x) = a0
A polynomial of degree one:
p1(x) = a1x + a0
is a linear polynomial, or linear function.
A polynomial of degree two:
p2(x) = a2x2 + a1x + a0
is a quadratic polynomial, or quadratic function.
Similarly for cubic (degree 3), quartic (degree 4), quintic (degree 5), . . . , etc.
An equation of the form
pn(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 = 0
is a polynomial equation in x of degree n.
Examples
(i)
p(x) = 2x + 1 is a linear polynomial or function, while 2x + 1 = 0
is a linear equation, which gives x = −1
2
(ii)
p(x) = x2 −3x + 2 is a quadratic function. x2 −3x + 2 = 0 is
a quadratic equation, which can be solved by factorising (see
Section 2.2.3):
x2 −3x + 2 = (x −1)(x −2) = 0
43

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
This can only be true if either x −1 = 0 or x −2 = 0, yielding two possible values of x:
x = 1, 2
Such solutions of a polynomial equation are called the roots or zeros of the corresponding
polynomial (➤52).
Some polynomials do not have roots that are real numbers – for example there are no
real numbers that satisfy
x2 + 1 = 0
However, if we allow the possibility of complex roots (complex numbers are considered
in Chapter 12), then there is a famous theorem of algebra (the fundamental theorem of
algebra) which states that a polynomial of nth degree has exactly n roots – which may
be real, equal or complex.
Polynomials may be added and multiplied to produce other polynomials. In doing so
remember to gather like terms, and take care with signs.
Examples
(2x + 1) + (x3 −2x2 −3x −7) = x3 −2x2 + (2x −3x) + (1 −7)
= x3 −2x2 −x −6
(2x2 + x −1)(x2 −2) = 2x2x2 + 2x2(−2) + xx2 + x(−2) −1x2 −1(−2)
= 2x4 −4x2 + x3 −2x −x2 + 2
= 2x4 + x3 −5x2 −2x + 2
Solution to review question 2.1.2
(i) We must gather together all terms of the same degree:
x3 −2x + 1 + 3(x4 + 2x3 −4x2 −x −1)
= x3 −2x + 1 + 3x4 + 6x3 −12x2 −3x −3
= 3x4 + 7x3 −12x2 −5x −2
(ii) Expanding the brackets:
(x −2)(x + 3) = x(x + 3) −2(x + 3)
= x2 + 3x −2x −6
= x2 + x −6
(iii) This example illustrates how good facility with elementary results
can save you work. Thus, one way to expand in this case is:
(x −1)2(x + 1) = (x2 −2x + 1)(x + 1)
= x3 −2x2 + x + x2 −2x + 1
= x3 −x2 −x + 1
44

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
This is ﬁne, but it is much quicker if you notice that pairing off one
of the (x −1) factors with the (x + 1) gives x2 −1 and:
(x −1)2(x + 1) = (x −1)(x2 −1)
= x3 −x2 −x + 1
is obtained directly.
(iv) No tricks here, just a careful plod:
(2x −1)(x2 + x + 1) = 2x3 + 2x2 + 2x −x2 −x −1
= 2x3 + x2 + x −1
Note that in each of the above examples, we can always check our results
by substituting ‘obvious’ values of x in the result. x = 0 is often a good
start, whereas x = ±1 can be used in (iii), the point being that your calcu-
lated results must vanish for these values. x = 1
2 will do a similar (but
messy) job in (iv).
2.2.3 Factorisation of polynomials by inspection
➤
38
75 ➤
As mentioned in Section 2.2.1 it is sometimes necessary to reverse the multiplication
of polynomials or brackets to split an expression into factors of a particular type. This
process is called factorising. It is useful in solving algebraic equations, or determining
their properties. Usually we try to factorise into ‘linear’ factors of the form x −a.
Example
You can conﬁrm that x2 + 2x + 1 = (x + 1)2. This tells us that the quadratic equation
x2 + 2x + 1 = 0 has two equal roots x = −1. It also makes clear that x2 + 2x + 1 is
always positive whatever the value of x.
In general, factorising can be difﬁcult. It pays to take it slowly and build up conﬁdence
with simple expressions.
Example
To factorise x2 + 2x note that x is a common factor of each of the terms in the polynomial.
We can therefore ‘take it out’ and write
x2 + 2x = x(x + 2)
The approach in general is to inspect each term of an expression and check whether there
are factors common to each. All we are really doing is reversing the distributive rule
stated in Section 2.2.1.
Example
8x2 −2x4 = 4(2x2) −(2x2)x2
= 2x2(4 −x2)
= 2x2(2 −x)(2 + x)
by using the difference of two squares (see Section 2.2.1).
45

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
When factorising more complicated polynomials it pays to remember that this is not
always possible. For example, we cannot factorise x2 + 1 in terms of real factors, and it
must therefore be left as it is. In any event, factorisation is rarely easy, and by far the most
potent weapon in factorising is a high degree of skill in multiplying out brackets. The
result for the difference of two squares, and the square of a linear factor (Section 2.2.1)
are particularly useful here. In the latter case try to learn to recognise that, provided the
coefﬁcient of x2 is 1, the constant term in (x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2 (i.e. independent of
x) is the square of half of the coefﬁcient of the linear term in x.
Expressions can sometimes be factorised by looking for like terms and combining them,
or for terms with common factors.
Example
2ac + ad −6bc −3bd
‘By inspection’ we notice that a may be taken out of the ﬁrst two terms to give a(2c + d).
We then look at the last two terms to see if they conceal a 2c + d – sure enough they may
be written −6bc −3bd = −3b(2c + d).
So we have
2ac + ad −6bc −3bd = a(2c + d) −3b(2c + d)
and taking out the common factor 2c + d ﬁnally gives the factorised form
(a −3b)(2c + d)
Note that this required some inspired guesswork and trial and error.
Solution to review question 2.1.3
A. (i) To factorise 3x2 + 6x examine each term and ﬁnd factors common
to them. In this case both terms contain an x and a 3, from which
3x2 + 6x = (3x)x + (3x)(2)
= 3x(x + 2)
This done you could, for practise, check the result by expanding
out again, to go from right to left.
(ii) Know your difference of two squares backwards!
u2 −16 = u2 −42 = (u −4)(u + 4)
B. (i) In factorising something like x2 −x −2 most of us use a sort of
inspired trial and error. And the better you are at multiplying pairs
of brackets, the easier the trial will be. We look at the −2. This can
only come from multiplying something like (x ± 1) and (x ∓2)
together. Whichever of these we choose must combine to give us
the −x. All you have to do therefore is multiply such pairs of
brackets and check which gives the right result. If your expansion
46

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
of brackets is good, then you’ll be able to do this mentally:
(x −1)(x + 2) = x2 + x −2
×
(x + 1)(x −2) = x2 −x −2
√
So the factors are
(x + 1)(x −2)
If you want a more formal approach, note that
(x + a)(x + b) = x2 + (a + b)x + ab
So, to factorise x2 −x −2 we need to ﬁnd a and b such that
ab = −2 and a + b = −1, which is then done ‘by inspection’
(i.e. trial and error!) to give the result obtained above.
(ii) There is a routine device for factorising polynomials such as
x3 −2x2 −x + 2 or higher degree, based on the factor theorem
(see Section 2.2.6). This only works if the roots of the polynomial
are easy to spot. This example shows what can be done by looking
at the terms and picking factors out directly. In this case a couple
of elementary factorisations reveals that
x3 −2x2 −x + 2 = x2(x −2) −(x −2)
We continue by taking out the (x −2) factor now common to the
two terms
= (x2 −1)(x −2)
and ﬁnish by factorising the x2 −1
= (x −1)(x + 1)(x −2)
This example nicely illustrates how one often has to piece together
elementary results and ideas to solve problems.
(iii) For 3x2 + 5x −2 we have to deal with the 3, the coefﬁcient of x.
Because of this we guess that the factors are going to be some-
thing like (3x + a)(x + b), with ab = −2, and a + 3b = 5. Trial
and error (which can be systematised, but is hardly worth the
effort) soon reveals that b = 2 and a = −1 works and we can
then quickly check that (3x −1)(x + 2) = 3x2 + 5x −2.
Note that in these solutions we don’t want to give the impression that
factorisation is an haphazard, hit and miss process – there are system-
atic routines, including symbolic computer algebra packages – we simply
want to indicate what can be achieved with a good facility in simple
algebra.

2.2.4 Simultaneous equations
➤
38
75 ➤
We will say more about solving equations in Section 13.5, but here we need to cover some
simple examples that we will use in subsequent sections. A simple linear equation in one
variable, of the form
ax + b = 0
(a ̸= 0)
where a, b are given constants, is easy to solve:
ax = −b and so x = −b
a
Often we have to deal with equations involving two variables, such as
ax + by = e
cx + dy = f
where a, b, c, d, e, f are all given constants. This is referred to as a system of simulta-
neous linear equations in the two variables x and y. Such a system can be solved by
‘eliminating’ one of the variables, say y, and hence determining the other.
Example
x −y = 1
x + 2y = −1
In this case it is actually easier to eliminate x ﬁrst, because we notice that by subtracting
the equations (i.e. doing the same subtraction on each side of the equation) we obtain
(x −y) −(x + 2y) = 1 −(−1)
x −y −x −2y = 1 + 1 = 2
So
−3y = 2
and therefore
y = −2
3
We can now obtain x from the ﬁrst equation:
x = 1 + y = 1 −2
3 = 1
3
So the solution is
x = 1
3,
y = −2
3
which you should check in the original equations. Note that the answers are left as fractions
rather than converting to decimals. Any decimal form of the solutions is likely to be an
approximation and therefore incur errors, which may have serious consequences in an
actual engineering application.
48

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Complications can arise with such systems of equations, depending on the coefﬁcients
a, b, c, d, e, f . For example consider the system
x + y = 1
2x + 2y = 3
This system has no solutions for x and y because whereas the left-hand sides are related by
a factor of two, the right-hand sides are not – we say that the equations are incompatible.
To see the nonsense they lead to, subtract twice the ﬁrst from the second to give
‘0 = 2x + 2y −2(x + y) = 3 −2 = 1
Therefore 0 = 1’
An uncomfortable conclusion!
Now consider the pair
x + y = 1
2x + 2y = 2
These are not really two different equations – the second is just twice the ﬁrst. In this case
we can ﬁnd any number of solutions to the system – just ﬁx a value for, say, y and then
determine the required value of x.
The following is an example of another important type of system
x + y = 0
2x + y = 0
Because of the zeros on the right-hand side such a system is said to be homogeneous.
We will have a lot to say about them in Chapter 13, but for now convince yourself that
the only possible solution of this system is x = y = 0, a so-called ‘trivial’ solution. In
general, show that for the system
ax + by = 0
cx + dy = 0
to have a ‘non-trivial’ solution (i.e. x, y not both zero) for non-zero coefﬁcients a, b, c,
d we must have ad = bc.
The sorts of complications we have pointed to are really the concern of more advanced
mathematics. For the moment all we need to be able to do is solve a given system by elimi-
nation, when no complications arise. Graphically, equations of the form ax + by = c repre-
sent straight lines in a plane and systems of simultaneous equations of this type represent
sets of such lines that may or may not intersect. We will say more about this in Chapter 7.

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

No simple cancellation jumps out at us here. If we want to eliminate y,
say, then the easiest way is to multiply (i) by 2 to get
4x −2y = 2
and add this result to (ii) to obtain
4x −2y + x + 2y = 5x = 2 + 2 = 4
So x = 4/5.
Now substitute back in (i) to ﬁnd y
y = 2x −1 = 8
5 −1 = 3

The solution is therefore
x = 4

y = 3

2.2.5 Equalities and identities
➤
38
76 ➤
You might not have noticed but so far we have used the equals sign, =, in two distinct
contexts. Look at the two ‘equations’:
3x + 6 = 12
(i)
(x −1)(x + 1) = x2 −1
(ii)
The ﬁrst is the usual sort of equation. It only holds for a particular value of x – i.e. x = 6.
The equality in (i) enables us to determine x.
The second ‘equation’ actually tells us nothing about x – it is true for any value of
x. We call this an identity. The expressions on either side of the equals sign are merely
alternative forms of each other. To distinguish such identities from ordinary equalities we
use the symbol ≡(a ‘stronger’ form of equals!) and write
(x −1)(x + 1) ≡x2 −1
≡is read as ‘is equivalent to’, or ‘is identical to’.
The powerful thing about an identity in x is that it must be true for all values of x.
We can sometimes use this to gain useful information (a particularly important application
occurs in partial fractions – see Section 2.2.10).
Example
Suppose we are given
x2 −3x + 2 ≡Ax2 + Bx + C
50

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
where the A, B, C are ‘unknown’. In fact, the only way the left- and right-hand sides can
be identical is if the coefﬁcients of corresponding powers are the same, i.e.
A = 1,
B = −3,
C = 2
Another way of looking at this is to say that since the identity must hold true for all values
of x, we can determine the A, B, C by substituting ‘useful’ values of x. For example x = 0
gives C = 2 immediately. Choosing any two other values for x will give two equations
for A and B. In this case we may notice that the roots of the quadratic are 1 and 2 and so
taking these values of x give
x = 1,
A + B + 2 = 0
x = 2,
4A + 2B + 2 = 0
Solving these simultaneous equations gives
A = 1,
B = −3, as before.
Solution to review question 2.1.5
To determine A and B in
A(x −3) + B(x + 2) ≡4
use the fact that this must be true for all values of x. In particular it must
hold if x = 3, giving
A(0) + B(5) = 4
or
B = 4
5
Similarly, putting x = −2 gives
A(−5) = 4
or
A = −4
5
An alternative (longer) approach is to rewrite the identity as
(A + B)x + (−3A + 2B) = 4
and equate coefﬁcients on each side to give
A + B = 0
−3A + 2B = 4
Now solve these to give the previous results.

2.2.6 Roots and factors of a polynomial
➤
39
76 ➤
Shortly, we will be looking at more powerful methods for factorising polynomials. First, I
want to clarify something that often confuses those new to algebra. This is the distinction
between factors, roots and solutions of polynomials or polynomial equations. Remember
the difference between an algebraic expression and an algebraic equation referred to in
Section 2.2.1? In particular, a polynomial is an expression such as
x2 + x −2
whereas the corresponding polynomial equation would be
x2 + x −2 = 0
Now if we proceed to solve this equation by factorising:
x2 + x −2 ≡(x −1)(x + 2)
the expressions x −1, x + 2 are factors of the polynomial expression alone, independently
of the equation. The last identity is simply an alternative way of writing x2 + x −2 in
terms of these factors. This is of course helpful in solving the corresponding polynomial
equation:
x2 + x −2 ≡(x −1)(x + 2) = 0
Remembering that for real numbers ab = 0 means one or both of a, b must be zero (41
➤
),
this factorised form tells us that the solutions to the equation can be obtained by putting
the factors x −1, x + 2 equal to zero. This leads to the solutions of the equation
x = 1,
x = −2
These values of x, which make the polynomial x2 + x −2 zero, are called the roots or
zeros of the polynomial. So, if x −1 is a factor of the quadratic expression x2 + x −2
then x = 1 is a solution of the quadratic equation x2 + x −2 = 0.
In general, if x −a is a factor of a polynomial pn(x) then x = a will be a solution of
the polynomial equation pn(x) = 0. The solution x = a is often referred to as a root of
the polynomial. This idea is the basis of the factor theorem:
If p(x) is a polynomial and if x = a is a root of the polynomial, i.e. p(a) = 0, then
x −a is a factor of p(x). On the other hand, if x −a is a factor of p(x) then clearly
p(a) = 0.
This result is fairly obvious from the fact that if p(x) has a factor x −a then it can be
written as p(x) = (x −a)q(x) where q(x) is another polynomial. Then clearly p(a) = 0.
We can use the factor theorem in factorising more complicated polynomials. While
we know from the example x2 + 1 that not all polynomials can be factorised into linear
factors x −a, it can be shown that any polynomial with real coefﬁcients can always be
factorised into linear and/or quadratic factors with real coefﬁcients. It may then be
possible to ﬁnd the linear factors by trial and error using the factor theorem, if the roots
are simple numbers, easy to spot.
Another useful result is that if the coefﬁcient of the term of highest degree is unity the
roots of a polynomial may be factors of the constant term, which gives us some clues
about what the factors might be.

E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Example
p(x) ≡x4 + 2x3 −x −2
The roots must be factors of −2 and so the only integer roots are likely to be ±1 or ±2.
We ﬁnd by trial that
p(1) = 0 giving a factor x −1
p(−2) = 0 giving a factor x + 2
However, −1 and 2 are not roots, so we have probably exhausted all possible real factors
(although there may be repeated roots, see below). To ﬁnd the quadratic factor remaining
we write
x4 + 2x3 −x −2 ≡(x −1)(x + 2)(x2 + ax + b)
≡(x2 + x −2)(x2 + ax + b)
and ﬁnd, on multiplying out the right-hand side and equating coefﬁcients in the resulting
identity
−2b = −2,
so b = 1
(constant term)
b −2a = −1,
so a = 1
(coefﬁcient of x)
So the factorised form is
p(x) = (x −1)(x + 2)(x2 + x + 1)
The quadratic x2 + x + 1 does not factor further into real factors – it is said to be irre-
ducible.
It may not always be clear whether or not there are repeated factors in a polynomial.
This does not really matter much since any repeated factors will become apparent from
the remaining quadratic factor for simple cases. There is a result that if x −a is a repeated
factor of a polynomial p(x) then it is also a factor of the derivative p′(x), but this is rarely
worth using.
Solution to review question 2.1.6
A. From Review Question 2.1.2(iii) we have
x3 −x2 −x + 1 = (x −1)2(x + 1)
(i) The factors are therefore (x −1) (twice) and x + 1.
(ii) The roots are the values which make the polynomial vanish, which
from the factors are x = 1 (twice) and x = −1.
Note that a factor is an expression containing x while a root is a
particular value of x.
The solutions of the equation
x3 −x2 −x + 1 = 0
53

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
are, of course, simply the roots of the polynomial on the left-hand side,
by deﬁnition, and so the solutions are x = 1 (twice) and x = −1.
B. No obvious factors present themselves in p(x) = x3 + 2x2 −5x −6.
The best approach here is to use the factor theorem. We know that any
linear factor of the form x −a must be such that a is a factor of −6.
Also, by the factor theorem, if x −a is a factor of the polynomial p(x),
then p(a) = 0. All this suggests that we look for roots of the polyno-
mial amongst the factors of −6, by substituting these in the polynomial.
Trying x = 1:
p(1) = 13 + 2 × 12 −5 × 1 −6 = −8 ̸= 0
So (x −1) is not a factor.
But x = −1 gives
(−1)3 + 2(−1)2 −5(−1) −6 = 0
So (x −(−1)) = (x + 1) is a factor.
Similarly, you can check that x = −2, x = 3 are not roots, but x = 2
and x = −3 are, giving the ﬁnal factorisation as
(x + 1)(x −2)(x + 3)
NB. By far the most common mistake in this topic is to think that if
x = a is a root then x + a is the corresponding factor. This error is
particularly easily made if a is negative. Remember, the correct factor
is x −a.
2.2.7 Rational functions
➤

76 ➤
In writing down a polynomial we need only addition (or subtraction) and multiplication.
The next step is to consider algebraic fractions, involving the division of polynomials.
The simplest example is
1
x
This already gives us new problems. Whereas a polynomial in x exists for every value
of x – that is, plug in a value of x and you will get out a value for the polynomial – the
above fraction does not exist for x = 0. That is, there is no such number as 1
0. As noted in
Section 1.2.1 it simply does not exist – we say 1
x is not deﬁned at x = 0. By this we mean
that we are not allowed to put x = 0 in this expression. For this reason we should really write
1
x
x ̸= 0
but the ‘x ̸= 0’ is often omitted, so long as it is clearly understood.
54

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
You may think that the fraction
x
x
does exist, and that it is equal to 1, on cancellation of the x. But again this is only true
if x ̸= 0. The expression is not deﬁned for x = 0, that is, there is no number equal to 0
0.
In general then, algebraic fractions are not deﬁned for those values of x which make
their denominator vanish.
Examples
1
x −1 is not deﬁned at x = 1
x −2
x −2 is not deﬁned at x = 2
x + 1
x2 −2x −3 is not deﬁned at x = −1 and x = 3 (why?)
Just as an arithmetic fraction such as 2
3 is called a rational number, a general algebraic
function of the form:
Polynomial
Polynomial
is called a rational function. The polynomial on the top is the numerator that on the
bottom the denominator in analogy with numerical fractions.
Examples
x + 1
x + 2,
x2 + 2x −3
x2 + 4x + 2
are rational functions, whereas
√x + 1
x + 2 ,
x2 + 3x −4
x + √x
are not because neither of √x + 1 or x + √x are polynomials.
Solution to review question 2.1.7
(i)
x −1
x2 + 1 and (iii)
x −1
x2 + x + 1 are both of the form

and are therefore rational functions.
(ii) √x + 1
√x and (iv)
x −1
x + 1 are not rational functions because of the
square roots.

2.2.8 Algebra of rational functions
➤

76 ➤
Rational functions often cause a lot of problems for beginners in mathematics. There are
some common errors that occur frequently, such as
‘1
a + 1
b =
1
a + b
’
To clear these up we will approach the algebra of rational functions gradually and system-
atically. First, to avoid such errors as that above, it may be helpful for you to get into the
habit of checking such results numerically. For example, putting a = b = 1 in the above
gives the nonsense
‘1
1 + 1
1 = 1 + 1 = 2 =
1
1 + 1 = 1
2
’
Algebraic fractions behave much like numerical fractions. For example, multiplication is
straightforward:
a
b × c
d = ac
bd
where a, b, c, d may be any polynomials.
Dividing by a rational function requires a little care, but essentially depends on the
fact that
1
1/a = a
(a ̸= 0)
– the reciprocal of the reciprocal undoes the reciprocal – as can be seen by multiplying
top and bottom on the left-hand side by a. In general, division is carried out by inverting
the dividing fraction and multiplying, thus: a
b
 c
d = a
b × d
c = ad
bc . Again, this can be
seen by multiplying top and bottom of the left-hand expression by d
c .
Example
Multiply and divide the functions x + 1, 1
x , stating when the corresponding operations are
permissible.
We can have the product (x + 1) × 1
x = x + 1
x
= 1 + 1
x
for x ̸= 0.
For division we can have:
x + 1
1/x
= (x + 1) ×
1
1/x = (x + 1) × x
= x(x + 1)
for x ̸= 0
or
1/x
x + 1 = 1
x ×
1
x + 1 =
1
x(x + 1)
for x ̸= 0 or −1
56

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Just as we can simplify the fraction 2
4 to its ‘lowest’ form 1
2, so we may be able to ‘cancel
down’ algebraic fractions – but with slightly more care. For example on cancelling the x
on top and bottom you may be happy with
x(x + 1)
x
= x + 1
but remember that the functions on each side are not the same for all values of x. Whereas
the right-hand side exists for all values of x, the left-hand side is not deﬁned for x = 0.
Provided you are careful about such things, algebraic cancellations present little difﬁculty.
Examples
x2 −x
x −1 = x(x −1)
x −1
= x
(x ̸= 1)
3x −6
x2 −x −2 =
3(x −2)
(x + 1)(x −2) =
3
x + 1
(x ̸= −1, 2)
In algebraic fractions it is perhaps not so much what you can do that needs emphasising,
but what you can’t do. For example, presented with something like x + 1
x + 2, you cannot
‘cancel’ the x’s as follows:
‘x + 1
x + 2 = x + 1
x + 2
= 1 + 1
1 + 2 = 2
3
’
The fact is that x + 1
x + 2 cannot be ‘simpliﬁed’ further – leave it as it is. Tread warily with
algebraic fractions – check each step, with numerical examples if need be.
We now consider addition and subtraction of rational functions. First, get used to adding
fractions with the same denominator:
a
c + b
c = a + b
c
This is the only way you can add fractions directly – when the denominators are the
same (13
➤
).
Example
3
x −1 −
7
x −1 = 3 −7
x −1 =
−4
x −1
To add fractions with different denominators we have to make each denominator the same
by multiplying top and bottom by an appropriate factor. We use the result for constructing
equivalent fractions:
1
a = 1
a × b
b = b
ab
(a, b ̸= 0)
e.g. 1
3 = 5
15
57

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
So, for example,
1
a + 1
b = b
ab + a
ab = b + a
ab
= a + b
ab
This is called putting the fractions over a common denominator. It is what we did
with numerical fractions in Section 1.2.5. Note that the restrictions a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0 are
necessary for the left-hand end to exist, and are all that is needed to convert to the ﬁnal
result.

In the above examples it has been pretty clear what the ‘common denominator’ should be.
Consider the example
3
x2 −1 + 2x −1
(x + 1)2
In this case, you might be tempted to put both fractions over (x2 −1)(x + 1)2. But of
course this ignores the fact that both x2 −1 = (x −1)(x + 1) and (x + 1)2 have a factor
x + 1 in common. The lowest common denominator in this case is thus (x2 −1)(x + 1) =
(x −1)(x + 1)2 and we write:
3
x2 −1 + 2x −1
(x + 1)2 =
3
(x −1)(x + 1) + 2x −1
(x + 1)2
=

we are multiplying by 1 in each case.
≡2(x −2) −3(x + 1)
(x + 1)(x −2)

(x + 1)(x −2)
This approach extends naturally to three or more fractions as shown

Consider the sum

Putting this over a common denominator gives
x + 1 +
3
x −1 = (x + 1)(x −1) + 3

x −1
= x2 + 2
x −1
So adding polynomials to fractions presents few problems
it is analogous to, say, 2 + 1
2 =
5
2
. But what if we want to go the other way – that is, divide x −1 into x2 + 2 to reproduce
the original sum? This is called long division. There is a routine algorithmic (i.e. step
by step) procedure for such division, but usually one can get away with a simpliﬁed
procedure which relies on repeatedly pulling out from the numerator terms that contain
the denominator. Our numerical example illustrates this:
5
2 = 4 + 1
2
= 2 × 2 + 1
2
= 2 × 2
2
+ 1
2
= 2 + 1
2
This approach requires only that we are good at spotting factors. So for example:
x2 + 2
x −1 = x2 −1 + 3

x −1
= (x −1)(x + 1)

This does require some algebraic intuition and clever grouping of terms, but can be very
quick.

In this example division by x −1 resulted in a remainder of 3/(x −1). In general, when
a polynomial p(x) is divided by a linear factor x −a the remainder can be found directly
by the remainder theorem:
The remainder when a polynomial p(x) is divided by x −a is given by
p(x)
x −a = q(x) +
r
x −a
where r = p(a) and q(x) is a polynomial of degree less than that of p(x).
We can see this by re-writing the above result as
p(x) = (x −a)q(x) + r
and putting x = a to give
p(a) = r
For example, the remainder when x2 + 2 is divided by x −1 is 12 + 2 = 3, as found
above.
Solution to review question 2.1.9

ator to give us factors containing the denominator, like so:

x + 2

x + 2
as above. This method gives you lots of practice in ﬁnding factors!
B. From the remainder theorem, the remainder when p(x) = 4x3 −2x2 +
3x −1 is divided by x −2 is the value of p(x) when x = 2, i.e.

2.2.10 Partial fractions
➤
39
77 ➤
Often we have to reverse the process of taking the common denominator, i.e. split an
expression of the form
px + q
(x −a)(x −b)
(p, q numbers)
into its partial fractions
A
x −a +
B
x −b
The expression is easier to differentiate and integrate in this form, for example. The method
used is best illustrated by an example. We effectively have to reverse the process of taking
the common denominator. But this is an example of a mathematical process that is much
easier to do than it is to undo!
Consider
x + 1
(x −1)(x −2) ≡
A
x −1 +
B
x −2
where the object is to determine A and B on the right-hand side. There are a number of
ways of doing this, but they all implicitly depend on combining the right-hand side over
a common denominator and insisting that the numerators be identical on both sides:
A
x −1 +
B
x −2 ≡A(x −2) + B(x −1)
(x −1)(x −2)
≡
x + 1
(x −1)(x −2)
This implies
A(x −2) + B(x −1) ≡x + 1
(1)
There are now two ways to go, both relying on the fact that the result is an identity (50
➤
)
and must therefore be true for all values of x. In particular, it is true for
x = 1, which gives A = −2
and
x = 2, which gives B = 3
So
x + 1
(x −1)(x −2) ≡
3
x −2 −
2
x −1
NB. Checking such results by recombining the right-hand side to conﬁrm that you do
indeed get the left-hand side will help you to develop your algebraic skills.
Another means of ﬁnding A and B is to rewrite the identity (1) as
(A + B)x −(2A + B) ≡x + 1
62

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
and use the fact that this must be an identity to get relations between A and B:
A + B = 1
−(2A + B) = 1
the solution of which reproduces A = −2, B = 3.
There is a short cut to all this, called the cover-up rule. Many teachers frown on such
‘tricks’ because they can be used blindly without real understanding. I certainly don’t
advocate that. Rather, they should be evidence of your mastery of the material, enabling
you to save time. In this case the trick is really a mental implementation of the ﬁrst method
described above. We write
x + 1
(x −1)(x −2) ≡x −1
x −2
and ﬁll in the numerators as follows. The numerator of the
1
x −1 term is the value of
the left-hand side obtained by ‘covering up’, or ignoring, the x −1 factor and putting
x −1 = 0, i.e. x = 1 in the remaining expression. This gives
x + 1
(x – 1)(x – 2) x = 1
=  –2
as found for A.
Similarly, for B we get
x + 1
(x – 1)(x – 2) x = 2
= 3
B  =
as before. With practice this may be done mentally and the result
x + 1
(x −1)(x −2) ≡
−2
x −1 +
3
x −2
written down immediately.
More complicated rational functions may be similarly decomposed in terms of partial
fractions, but the cover up rule may not apply, and we may have to resort to a combination
of methods. The general forms for such partial fractions are:
p(x)
(x −a)(x −b)(x −c) ≡
A
x −a +
B
x −b +
C
x −c
p(x)
(x −a)(x2 + b) ≡
A
x −a + Bx + C
x2 + b
p(x)
(x −a)(x −b)3 ≡
A
x −a +
B
x −b +
C
(x −b)2 +
D
(x −b)3
with obvious generalisations. p(x) is any polynomial of degree at least one less than the
denominator. Note that the number of constants A, B, . . . to determine on the right-hand

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
side is always the same as the total degree of the original denominator. In the above the
cover-up rule may be used for A, B, C in the ﬁrst result, for A in the second and for A and
D in the third. There are many examples of the more complicated types in the reinforcement
exercises, but the simplest case of linear factors should cover most of your needs.

2 and x = −3 to give B = 1

rather than numerical means here.
The ﬁrst point to emphasise is that an equation is a precise statement involving an
equality, and any solution must reﬂect that precision, or else it is only an approximate
solution. Consider for example the simple equation
3x −2 = 0
The precise solution is
x = 2

If you now use your calculator to give you the approximation x = 0.666666667, then
this is not a solution of the equation. It is simply an approximation to it and you should
write your answer as x ≃0.666666667. You may feel that this is nit-picking, with no real
practical importance, since we are always using approximations in engineering and science.
However, small errors can often assume serious signiﬁcance in engineering systems, and

in any event it only requires care to use = and ≃appropriately. In algebra we consider
only exact solutions, always use = and avoid decimals wherever possible.
The simplest equation is of course
x = α
where α is a given number. Here the solution is trivial and immediate. Writing the equation
in the form
x −α = 0
is only a small disguise, and it is often convenient to write equations in this way, with an
algebraic expression equated to zero. The most general form of such a linear equation in
x is
ax + b = 0
where a, b are given constants and a ̸= 0. The solution is of course x = −b
a , as noted in
Section 2.2.4.
The solution of more complicated polynomial equations, such as quadratics, usually
amounts to trying to pick out such linear factors which can be solved separately, as above.
This is most easily seen with quadratic equations in the case when they can be factorised.
The most general quadratic equation in x is
ax2 + bx + c = 0
where a(̸= 0), b, c are given numbers. If the left-hand side factorises then this gives us
two linear equations to solve.
Example
Solve the equation 3x2 + 5x −2 = 0
Factorising, we have
3x2 + 5x −2 ≡(3x −1)(x + 2) = 0
So the left-hand side can only be zero if
3x −1 = 0 whence x = 1
3
or
x + 2 = 0 whence x = −2
Notice the use of a key property of real numbers – if ab = 0 then one or both of a, b is
zero – this property does not hold, for example, for matrices (Chapter 13).
So the two solutions are x = −2, 1
3.
A quadratic equation must of course always have two solutions, although these may be
equal, or complex (Chapter 12).
Example
Solve x2 + 4x + 4 = 0
x2 + 4x + 4 ≡(x + 2)2 = 0
giving two identical solutions x = −2.

The problem with a quadratic equation occurs when it won’t factorise. But in all cases
we can use the following formula for the solution of the quadratic
ax2 + bx + c = 0
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac
2a
We will derive this formula below – for now we look at its properties and how to apply it.
First notice that the division by a is permissible – if a were zero then we wouldn’t
have a quadratic. Next notice that the nature of the solutions depends on what is under
the square root, i.e. on the object
 = b2 −4ac
which is called the discriminant of the quadratic. There are three cases:
 > 0, then

b2 −4ac is a real number
and we have two different real roots.
 = 0, then

b2 −4ac = 0
and we have two equal real roots.
 < 0, then

b2 −4ac is a complex number
and we have two different complex (conjugate) roots (see Chapter 12).
In this chapter we are concerned only with the ﬁrst two cases.
Example
In the equation 3x2 + 5x −2 = 0 we have a = 3, b = 5, c = −2 (always remember to
include signs). So the solutions are
x = −5 ±

52 −4 × 3 × (−2)

= −5 ± √25 + 24
6
= −5 ± 7
6
= 2
6 or −12
6
i.e. x = 1
3 or −2 as before.
To see where the formula for the solution of a quadratic equation comes from we
complete the square of the quadratic expression. This procedure has many applications
in elementary and further mathematics and gives good practice in algebraic manipulation.
Basically, it is a technique for expressing the quadratic as a sum or difference of two
squares, and it relies on the key result (42

(x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2

Note how the a (3 in the example) is retained throughout the calculation, right to the
end. It is a common mistake to drop such factors.

Also, once the square is completed for a quadratic it becomes clear what its maximum or
minimum values are as x varies. This is because x only occurs under a square, which is
always positive. Looking at the general form:
a


x + b
2a
	2
−b2 −4ac
(2a)2

we have two cases:
a positive .a > 0/
As x varies, the quadratic will go through a minimum value when x + b
2a = 0, because
this yields the smallest value within the square brackets.
a negative .a < 0/
As x varies, the quadratic goes through a maximum value when x + b
2a = 0.

There is a useful relationship between the roots of a quadratic equation and its coefﬁ-
cients. Thus, suppose α, β are the roots of the quadratic x2 + ax + b. Then x −α, x −β
68

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
are factors and we have
(x −α)(x −β) ≡x2 + ax + b
Expanding the left-hand side gives
x2 −(α + β)x + αβ ≡x2 + ax + b
So
b = product of roots = αβ
a = −sum of roots = −(α + β)
Solution to review question 2.1.11
A. (i) You may have jumped straight in to the formula here. But, in fact,
all we have to do is take out an x to give
x2 −3x = x(x −3) = 0
The only possible solutions are then
x = 0 and x = 3 (don’t forget the zero solution!)
i.e.
x = 0 or 3
(ii) A routine factorisation gives
x2 −5x + 6 = (x −3)(x −2) = 0
so
x = 2 or 3
(iii) This sort of problem, with a coefﬁcient of x2 that is not one
sometimes gives problems when it comes to using factorisation.
We have to try factors of both the 2 and the −2. Some trial and
error leads to
2x2 + 3x −2 ≡(2x −1)(x + 2) = 0
So we get solutions x = 1
2, −2
If you do get stuck on the factorisation then use the formula – but
be careful in handling the coefﬁcient of x2. The solution of
ax2 + bx + c = 0
is
x = −b ±
√
b2 −4ac

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

= −3 ± 5

2 or −2, as above
B. To complete the square we proceed as follows (see text above):
• if necessary factor out the coefﬁcient of x2
• take half the coefﬁcient of x
• square it
• add and subtract the result to the quadratic expression
• use the result (x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2 with the added bit
In other words ‘add and subtract (half of the coefﬁcient of x)2′’. This
does not change the value of the expression, because we are simply
adding zero, but it sets up the expression for us to use the result
(x + a)2 = x2 + 2ax + a2. Thus we have
x2 + x + 1 ≡x2 + x + 1 +

≡x2 + x +
 1

This form of the expression makes it clear that its minimum value must
be 3
4, which must occur when x + 1
2 = 0, i.e. x = −1
2.
C. If α, β are the roots of the quadratic x2 + 2x + 3 then their sum is
the negative of the coefﬁcient of x, while their product is the constant
term (including sign). So, we have
α + β = −2
αβ = 3
2.2.12 Powers and indices for algebraic expressions
➤

78 ➤
We introduced powers and indices in Section 1.2.7, mainly for numbers. We will extend them
here to algebraic symbols. The rules, reproduced here, are exactly the same for algebraic
functions:
aman = am+n
am
an = am−n
(am)n = amn
70

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(ab)n = anbn
a0 = 1
where a, b are algebraic functions, m, n need not be integers, but care is needed when
they are not. For example
√
x2 + 1 exists for all values of x, since x2 + 1 is positive, but
√
x2 −1 only exists (as a real number) if x2 ≥1, i.e. x ≥1 or x ≤−1.
As always we need to be careful when brackets and signs are involved, for example
(−2x)3 = (−1)323x3 = −8x3.

2.2.13 Binomial theorem
➤
40
79 ➤
There are many occasions in applied mathematics when we need to expand expressions
such as (a + b)6. Very simple examples can be done long hand:
(a + b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
(a + b)3 = (a2 + 2ab + b2)(a + b)
= a3 + 3a2b + 3ab2 + b3
71

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
but this soon becomes tedious. Fortunately there is a well established routine method for
expanding such expressions. Since a + b is a binomial this method is called the binomial
theorem.
The binomial theorem deals with expanding expressions such as (a + b)n or (1 + x)n.
Here we will restrict n to be a positive integer, but it works equally well for other values
(leading to inﬁnite series). This is perhaps a place where ‘in at the deep end’ is the best
policy and so here it is, the binomial theorem:
(a + b)n = an + nan−1b + n(n −1)
2!
an−2b2 + · · ·
+ n(n −1) . . . (n −r + 1)
r!
an−rbr + · · · + bn
or, using the combinatorial notation nCr (Section 1.2.6 ➤)
(a + b)n = an + nC1an−1b + nC2an−2b2 + · · ·
+ nCran−rbr + · · · + bn
You have two problems (at least!) here – remembering the result and understanding where
it comes from. Memorising it is helped by noting the patterns:
•
terms are of the form an−rbr , i.e. n quantities multiplied together
•
the coefﬁcient of an−rbr is nCr =
n!
(n −r)!r! = n(n −1) . . . (n −r + 1)
r!
•
there is symmetry – for example terms of the form an−rbr and arbn−r
are symmetrically placed, as are the coefﬁcients, since nCr = nCn−r
•
the
coefﬁcient
of
an−rbr
has
r!
in
the
denominator
and
n(n −1) . . . (n −r + 1) in the numerator. The latter is perhaps best
remembered by starting at the second term with n and reducing n in
successive terms.
Example
(a + b)6 = a6 + 6a5b + 6.5
2! a4b2 + 6.5.4
3! a3b3
+ 6.5.4.3
4!
a2b4 + 6.5.4.3.2
5!
ab5 + 6!
6!b6
= a6 + 6a5b + 15a4b2 + 20a3b3 + 15a2b4 + 6ab5 + b6
Your second problem, understanding where the binomial expansion comes from, is best
approached by noticing that in
(a + b)n = (a + b) × (a + b) × · · · × (a + b)



n factors
we can form terms of the form an−rbr by choosing, say, b in r ways from n different
brackets – there are nCr ways to do this, giving nCr such terms in all, contributing
nCran−rbr to the expansion.
72

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g

The expansion for (1 + x)n is now easily obtained from the above by putting a = 1,
b = x to get
(1 + x)n = 1 + nx + n(n −1)
2!
x2 + n(n −1)(n −2)
3!
x3 + · · · + xn
= 1 + nC1x + nC2x2 + nC3x3 + · · · + xn
You may have previously seen the binomial theorem treated by Pascal’s triangle. While
this is ﬁne for expanding small powers such as (1 + x)4, it is cumbersome for increasingly
higher powers and less useful for more advanced theory and use of the binomial theorem,
as for example in determining a required coefﬁcient in the expansion. Note also that while
here we have taken n to be a positive integer, it is possible to extend the theorem to
the cases of n negative or a fraction. In such cases the above series expansion never
terminates (➤106).

You may have obtained the coefﬁcients in a different way – say by Pascal’s
triangle, or, you may have factored out the 2 and used the expansions of
(1 + x)n instead of arriving directly at the penultimate line. In any event
a steady hand is required to avoid losing signs or factors of 2. Finally
notice a simple check for your result, by putting x = 1 in both sides.
When x = 1, (2 −x)5 = 15 = 1, while the expanded result gives
32 −80 + 80 −40 + 10 −1 = 1
which checks.

2.4 Applications
1. The time behaviour of a source free resistor (R)-inductor (L)-capacitor (C) series circuit
can be described by a particular differential equation:
d2V
dt2 + R
L
dV
dt +
1
LC V = 0
79

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
where V is the capacitor voltage. Such equations will be solved in Chapter 15, but for
now note that in doing so it is necessary to solve the associated quadratic auxiliary
equation
λ2 + R
Lλ +
1
LC = 0
for the quantity λ, Greek ‘lambda’. Write down the solutions to this quadratic for general
values of R, L, C. Solve the quadratic for the following values of these parameters:
(i)
R = 10(, C = 1/9F, and L = 1H
(ii)
R = 6(, C = 1/9F, and L = 1H
(iii)
R = 2(, C = 1/9F, and L = 1H
In the case of (iii) you will obtain complex roots – such numbers are studied in
Chapter 12, but the next application gives you a preview.
2. A complex number is one of the form z = a + jb where a and b are ordinary, real
numbers and j is a symbol for the ‘imaginary number’
√
−1 . All you need to know
is that j 2 = −1 and that otherwise the normal rules of algebra apply. Investigate the
‘algebra’ of complex numbers, that is the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying and
dividing complex numbers. You will see this in Chapter 12, and as a taster you can try
to derive the results:
(i)
(a + jb)(c + jd) = ac −bd + j(bc + ad) (ii)
a + jb
c + jd = ac + bd
c2 + d2 + j bc −ad
c2 + d2
In (ii) multiply top and bottom of the left-hand side by c −jd.
3. Emperor Yang Sun (ninth century CE) had to choose between two equally qualiﬁed
clerks for a promotion, He set them the following problem to decide between them.
A man walking in the woods heard thieves arguing over the division of rolls of cloth
which they had stolen. They said that if each took six rolls there would be ﬁve left
over; but if each took seven rolls, they would be eight short. How many thieves were
there, and how many rolls of cloth?
The candidates performed the calculation in the ancient Chinese way, by using
bamboo rods on the tiled ﬂoor. This technique led to the early development of adding
and subtracting rows and columns of arrays to solve linear equations. Would you get
the job?
4. An open box is made from a 12 cm square card by cutting squares of equal size from
the four corners and folding the edges up. Calculate the size of the squares to be cut
to yield the box with the largest volume.
5. Vapour deposition methods are often used for thin ﬁlm layers in the fabrication of
semiconductor devices. Such methods involve exposing a semiconductor wafer to a
mixture of gases in a heated vacuum chamber. The chemical composition of the surface
layer, and the deposition time depend on the relative concentrations of the vapours in the
chamber. If three gases A, B, C are to be combined to form a number of overlayers of
new molecules ABC then the time dependence of the deposition of the new molecules
80

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
is described by the differential equation
dx
dt = k(x −a)(x −b)(x −c)
where x is the number of ABC molecules and a, b, c are the initial concentrations of
the A, B, C gases respectively. k is a constant depending on the rate of the chemical
reaction. Such equations are typical of a chemical reaction. In such a tri-molecular ﬁrst
order reaction the x −a factor, for example, models the fact that the rate of production
of the new molecule is proportional (14
➤
) to the current amount of each component
substance available. As x approaches the smallest of the a, b, c values the rate of
the reaction will slow down, until it stops completely when there is no more of that
constituent left. The differential equation will be solved in Chapter 15 (➤477) and a
crucial step in the solution is the splitting of
1
(x −a)(x −b)(x −c)
into partial fractions. Do this for the case of a = 1, b = 2, c = 3.
Obtain an expression for the partial fractions in the case when a, b, c have general
values.
6. In the toss of a fair coin the probability of a head is 1
2 and the same for a tail. Suppose
we toss such a coin three times. We can get 3H, 2H1T, 1H2T, and 3T. Write down the
probability of each possibility. Show that the sum of these probabilities can be written
 1
2 + 1
2
3
i.e. as a binomial expansion. In general, if we have n independent ‘trials’, each resulting
in a ‘success’ with probability p and a ‘failure’ with probability q = 1 −p then the
probability of s ‘successes’ is given by the binomial term
p(s) = nCsps(1 −p)n−s
Use the binomial theorem to show that the sum of all these probabilities, for all possi-
bilities, is 1. p(s) deﬁnes the binomial distribution, one of the most important in
statistics.

3.2.1 Deﬁnition of a function
➤
88
107 ➤
A function is a relation which expresses how the value of one quantity, the dependent
variable, depends on the value of another, the independent variable. Formally, this is
usually expressed
y = f (x)
dependent ↑
↑independent
variable
variable
where x is some quantity in a particular set of numbers which, when substituted into
the function f , produces the quantity y, which may be in a completely different set of
numbers.
Example
Suppose x = n is a non-zero integer, then the reciprocal function is deﬁned by:
y = f (x) = f (n) = 1
n
n ̸= 0
and y can be a rational number of magnitude less than one.
The important point about a function is that it must have a single unique value, y, for
every value, x, for which the function is deﬁned.
x is also called the argument of the function f (x). The set X of all values for which the
function f is deﬁned is called its domain. The set of all corresponding values of y = f (x),
Y, is called the range of f (x). We sometimes express a function as a mapping between
the sets X, Y denoted f : X →Y. The value of a particular function for a particular value
of x, say x = a, is called the image of a under f , denoted f (a).
Examples
(i) y = f (x) = x2 + 1 is deﬁned for all values of x, and for all such values y is greater
than or equal to 1. The image of −1 for this function is
f (−1) = (−1)2 + 1 = 2
(ii) y = g(x) =
3
x −1 is deﬁned for all x except x = 1, and y can vary over all real
non-zero numbers. The image of x = 0 for example is g(0) =
3
0 −1 = −3.
We have already met the common algebraic functions in Chapter 2:
Linear:
f (x) = ax + b
(deﬁned for all x)
Quadratic:
f (x) = ax2 + bx + c
(all x)
Cubic:
f (x) = ax3 + bx + cx + d
(all x)
90

E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Polynomial: f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0
(all x)
Reciprocal: f (x) = 1
x
x ̸= 0
Rational function – for example:
f (x) =
x + 1
(x −1)(x + 2)
x ̸= 1, −2
Here the coefﬁcients, a, b, c, d, an, . . . etc. are constants, or more strictly independent
of x. Such algebraic functions occur frequently in mechanics and electrical circuits, for
example. Rational functions are particularly important in control theory, where the roots
of the denominators (the so-called poles) have physical meaning for the stability of a
system.
The other standard functions – exponential and trigonometric – will be studied later.
They all reﬂect some important characteristic physical behaviour – for example the
exponential function represents the ‘law of natural growth’ whereby a quantity
increases at a rate proportional to the amount present. The trigonometric functions
sin x and cosine x describe wavelike behaviour such as occurs in an oscillating electrical
circuit.
The form y = f (x) deﬁnes an explicit form of a function of x. It is sometimes conve-
nient to deﬁne a function implicitly. For example the reciprocal y = 1/x may be deﬁned
implicitly as xy = 1.
Another form of representation of a function is by means of a parameter in terms
of which both x and y are expressed – this is called a parametric representation. For
example the position (x, y) of a projectile in a plane at time t may be expressed by
x = 3 + 2t, y = 4 + 2t −t2.

3.2.2 Plotting the graph of a function
➤
88
108 ➤
We can learn a lot about a function y = f (x) from its graph plotted against x-, y-axes,
in a plane Cartesian coordinate system. We choose an appropriate sequence of values
of x and calculate the corresponding values of y and plot the resulting x, y coordinates
against the axes. We may then be able to draw a continuous curve through the points.
Figure 3.1 illustrates this for the straight line graph of the linear function y = 2x + 1.
For this we only need two points, say (0, 1) and (1, 3), to deﬁne the resulting straight
line graph.

Like the linear function all the common functions have characteristic graphs. Some are
given in the reinforcement exercises and others you will meet as they arise in the book.
One important point to note is that here we are talking about plotting rather than sketching
a graph (see Chapter 10).

x2 −2x −3 = (x −3)(x + 1) = 0

to give x = 3 and x = −1 as the crossing points (‘gateways’ through the
x-axis), as we observe from the graph. Also, we can complete the square
to get:
x2 −2x −3 = (x −1)2 −4
which tells us that the minimum value is −4 and occurs at x = 1.
Again, we see this from the graph. (Note that any quadratic curve – or
parabola – is symmetric about its minimum or maximum point.)
3.2.3 Formulae
➤
88
108 ➤
Perhaps the most common way you have been exposed to functions before is in the use
of formulae to express the value of some variable in terms of other given quantities. For
example for an ideal gas pressure P can be expressed in terms of the volume V and
93

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
temperature T by the ideal gas law:
P = nRT
V
where nR is a constant dependent on the gas. If T is ﬁxed then we can regard this formula
as expressing P as a function f , say, of V :
P = f (V )
If V is ﬁxed then P can be regarded as a (different) function, g, of T :
P = g(T )
If V and T can vary then we can regard P as a function, F, of the two variables T
and V (we study such functions in Chapter 16):
P = F(T, V )
So the term function is really a precise formulation of the idea of a formula.
In the above examples it may, for example, be that P and T are known and it is required
to ﬁnd V . We do this by rearranging or transposing the formula to give V as a function
of P and T – in this case:
V = nRT
P
We say this is making V the subject of the formula.
Solution to review question 3.1.3
Given that
1
f = 1
u + 1
v
then if we know u and f we can obtain v as follows:
1
v = 1
f −1
u = u −f
uf
So
v =
uf
u −f
making v the subject of the formula.
3.2.4 Odd and even functions
➤
88
108 ➤
An even function is one which is unchanged when the sign of its argument changes,
f (−x) = f (x)
94

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Examples include:
f (x) = 5x2,
3x4 + x2
i.e. polynomials with only even powers of x.
An odd function changes sign with its argument
f (−x) = −f (x)
Examples are f (x) = 3x, 2x3 −x, i.e. polynomials with only odd powers of x.
The trig function cos x, studied in Chapter 6 is even:
cos(−x) = cos x
On the other hand sin x is odd:
sin(−x) = −sin x
The graph of an even function is symmetric about the y-axis, while the graph of an odd
function is unchanged under a rotation of 180° – see Figure 3.3.

Solution to review question 3.1.4
(i) For
f (x) = 3x3 −x we have
f (−x) = 3(−x)3 −(−x) = −3x3 + x
= −(3x3 −x) = −f (x)
So 3x3 −x is an odd function.
(ii) For
f (x) =
x2
1 + x2
f (−x) =
(−x)2
1 + (−x)2 =
x2
1 + x2 = f (x)
so this is even.
(iii) If f (x) =
2x
x2 −1 then
f (−x) =
2(−x)
(−x)2 −1 = −
2x
x2 −1 = −f (x)
so f (x) is odd.
(iv) If f (x) =
x2
x + 1 we have
f (−x) = (−x)2
−x + 1 =
x2
1 −x
This is not equal to f (x) or −f (x) and so this function is neither
odd nor even.

3.2.5 Composition of functions
➤
89
108 ➤
Often we need to combine functions. For example in differentiating a function such as
1
x2 + 1 it is useful to regard it as a function (the reciprocal) of a function (x2 + 1)
(Chapter 8). More speciﬁcally, if f (x) and g(x) are functions with appropriate domains
and ranges we can deﬁne their composition f (g(x)) which is the result of evaluating f at
the values given by g(x) for each value of x. Note that f (g(x)) and g(f (x)) are different
in general.
Example
f (x) = x2 + 1,
g(x) = 1
x .
f (g(x)) =
1
x
2
+ 1 = 1
x2 + 1
while
g(f (x)) =
1
f (x) =
1
x2 + 1
Solution to review question 3.1.5
(i) f (g(x)) = g(x) + 1 =
1
x −1 + 1 =
x
x −1.
(ii) g(f (x)) =
1
f (x) −1 =
1
x + 1 −1 = 1
x .
Remember to tidy up your result at the end.
3.2.6 Inequalities
➤
89
109 ➤
We introduced inequalities in Section 1.2.2. Their basic properties are the following:
•
If a < b and c < d then a + c < b + d
That is, if a is less than b and c is less than d then the sum of a and c will be less
than the sum of b and d. This is a fairly obvious property of numbers in general, whether
positive or negative.
•
If a < b and c > d then a −c < b −d
Perhaps the easiest way to see this is to plot the numbers a, b, c, d satisfying the above
conditions, on the real line. Then, a −c is the ‘distance’ between a and c and b −d is
the ‘distance’ between b and d, and it is then pictorially obvious that the former is less
than the latter. Or, since a < b we can write a = b −p where p is a positive number
and we can similarly write c = d + q where q is another positive number. Then a −c =
b −p −(d + q) = b −d −(p + q) from which, since p + q is positive, it follows that
a −c < b −d, as required.
•
If a < b and b < c then a < c
97

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
This property is another fairly obvious one for real numbers – if Jack is shorter than Jill
and Jill is shorter than John then Jack is shorter than John!
•
If a < b then a + c < b + c
Again fairly obvious – Jack doesn’t become any taller than Jill if they both stand on
the same chair.
•
If a < b and c > 0 then ac < bc
This just says that if you multiply two numbers a, b by a positive number c then the order
relation is unchanged – if you look at Jack and Jill through the same telescope, Jack is
still shorter than Jill.
•
If a < b and c < 0 then ac > bc
This is usually where our troubles start with inequalities, when we bring in negative
multipliers. This property says that changing the sign throughout reverses the inequality.
It is pretty obvious if you just think of an example: 4 > 3, but −4 < −3 and −8 < −6,
and plotting a, b, −a and −b on the real line may make it clear generally. Jack and Jill
can help by hanging from the ceiling – Jack is now ‘higher than Jill’! More rigorously,
note that we can write b = a + p where p is a positive number and so if c is a negative
number then bc = ac + pc, so ac = bc −pc. But if p is positive and c is negative, −pc
is positive, from which it follows that ac > bc.
•
If a < b and ab > 0 then 1
a > 1
b
Our troubles are mounting now – reciprocals and inequalities cause problems for
most of us. Again it helps to think of numbers: 2 < 3, and
1
2 > 1
3 but while −2 < 3,
1
−2 = −1
2 < 1
3. So the difference in sign affects the inequality when we take reciprocals.
The condition ab > 0 is included to make sure that a and b have the same sign,
both positive, or both negative. Only then does the inequality reverse if we take the
reciprocals. The contortions that Jack and Jill have to get up to to convince you of this
don’t bear thinking about. Perhaps it’s best if you simply satisfy yourself with a few
examples!
Most of the above results may be extended, with care, to ≤and ≥.
Inequalities can be used to specify intervals of numbers, for which a special notation
is sometimes used. Speciﬁcally, [a, b] denotes the closed interval a ≤x ≤b and (a, b)
denotes the open interval a < x < b.
Sometimes we have a problem in which we need to ﬁnd values of x such that a given
function f (x) satisﬁes an inequality such as
f (x) < 0
We call this solving the inequality. In such problems we may have to combine algebra,
knowledge of the function, and properties of inequalities. It is a common error to try to
solve such an inequality by considering the equality f (x) = 0 instead. Whilst doing this
may be useful, remember that it will only give the boundaries of the inequality region,
and extra work is needed to deﬁne the entire region.
98

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
An inequality in which f (x) is a linear (quadratic) function is called a linear (quadratic)
inequality, for example:
ax + b > 0
linear inequality
ax2 + bx + c > 0
quadratic inequality
Example
If
1 < 3x + 2 < 4
then subtracting 2 from each term gives
−1 −2 = −3 < 3x < 4 −2 = 2
So
−3 < 3x < 2
and so, dividing by the positive quantity 3, we obtain
−1 < x < 2
3
Example
Find the range of values of x for which 2x2 −3x −2 > 0.
It helps to factorise if we can, or ﬁnd the roots of the quadratic:
(x −2)(2x + 1) > 0
This will be true if either:
x −2 > 0 and 2x + 1 > 0,
i.e. x > 2
or if
x −2 < 0 and 2x + 1 < 0,
i.e. x < −1
2
So 2x2 −3x −2 > 0 for x < −1
2 and x > 2. You can also see this from the graph of the
function (➤RE (Reinforcement exercise) 3.3.2B), and graphical considerations often help
in dealing with inequalities generally. However, it is important that you gain practice in
the manipulation of inequalities, and the associated algebra.
Care is needed for inequalities involving the modulus. For example, suppose
|x −3| < 2
Then this means that
−2 < (x −3) < 2
or
−2 + 3 = 1 < x < 2 + 3 = 5
so
1 < x < 5
99

Solution to review question 3.1.6
If 1 < 4x −3 < 4 then adding 3 throughout gives
1 + 3 < 4x < 4 + 3
or 4 < 4x < 7
so 1 < x < 7

3.2.7 Inverse of a function
➤
89
109 ➤
Suppose we are given some function y = f (x). Then given a value of x we can evaluate,
in principle, the corresponding value of y. But often we are given the reverse problem – we
know y and want to ﬁnd the value of x. What we have in fact is an equation for x which
we have to solve. We call this inverting the function f and we write
x = f −1(y)
The inverse of a function f is the function f −1 such that
f −1(f (x)) = x
i.e.
f −1 ‘undoes’ f
It is important to note that the inverse of a function only exists if the function is ‘one-to-
one’ that is, each value of x gives one value of y and each value of y gives one value of
x. Sometimes this means that we have to be careful with the domains of our functions.
For example, the function y = x2 is only ‘one-to-one’ if, say, we restrict x to the domain
x > 0. Then the inverse function is x = √y or f −1(x) = √x.
Example
y = f (x) =
1
x −2
(x ̸= 2)
If y = 4, ﬁnd x.
We have
4 =
1
x −2
so
4(x −2) = 1 = 4x −8
and therefore
4x = 9
and
x = 9
4
100

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
In fact we can do this generally for any value of y by ﬁnding the inverse function of f :
y = f (x) =
1
x −2
Multiplying through by x −2 gives
y(x −2) = 1 = yx −2y
and so
yx = 1 + 2y
and solving for x we obtain
x = 1 + 2y
y
But if y = f (x) then by deﬁnition x = f −1(y)
so
x = f −1(y) = 1 + 2y
y
We may also write this as f −1(x) = 1 + 2x
x
, with x ̸= 0 of course.
We can now check the numerical example given above
f −1(4) = 1 + 2 × 4
4
= 9
4
as we found previously.
The inverse of a function is often as important as the function itself. For example the
inverse of the exponential function is the logarithm function (Chapter 4). Graphically,
the graph of the inverse function can be obtained by reﬂecting the graph of the function
in the straight line y = x.
Note that the −1 in f −1(x) does not mean forming the reciprocal – i.e. f −1(x) ̸=
1/f (x).
Solution to review question 3.1.7
If y = f (x) =
x
x −1, then the inverse of f (x) is given by x = f −1(y).
So, writing
y =
x
x −1
we have y(x −1) = x or (y −1)x = y.
So
x =
y
y −1 = f −1(y)
Hence
f −1(x) =
x
x −1
x ̸= 1
101

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Here the inverse function is exactly the same as the original function.
There is nothing strange about this, but it does emphasise the fact that
the inverse of a function is not the same thing as the reciprocal of a
function!
3.2.8 Series and sigma notation
➤
89
109 ➤
We will say more about series (particularly inﬁnite series) in Chapter 14. Here we want to
introduce the basic ideas by looking at two types of inﬁnite series, the geometric and the
binomial. In fact, these two are extremely important, in both the principles and practice
of series, and they occur frequently in applications in science and engineering.
A series is a sum of a sequence (i.e. a list) of terms which may be ﬁnite or inﬁnite in
number, for example
2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 ≡2 + 22 + 23 + 24 + 25
is a ﬁnite series. Dealing with ﬁnite series is essentially algebra.
Inﬁnite series are usually implicitly deﬁned by indicating that the series continues in a
particular way, for example:
1 + 1
2 + 1
4 + 1
8 + 1
16 + 1
32 + · · · +
1
2n−1 + · · ·
↑
nth term
A useful shorthand for writing such series is the sigma notation. The Greek capital letter
sigma  denotes summation. Thus, if ar (‘a subscript r’) denotes some mathematical
object, such as a number or algebraic expression, then the expression
n

r=m
ar = am + am+1 + · · · + an−1 + an
is ‘the sum of all ar as r goes from m to n’.
The letter r is called the index of the summation, while m, n are called the lower
and upper limits of summation respectively. Note that the letter r is in fact a dummy
index – it can be replaced by any other:
n

r=m
ar =
n

i=m
ai
for example, in this respect r is similar to the integration variable in deﬁnite integration
(Chapter 9):

f (x) dx =

f (t) dt

The most well known and useful elementary series is the sum of a geometric progres-
sion (GP):
a, ar, ar2, ar3, . . . , arn−1, . . .
where a is the ﬁrst term and r the common ratio. Notice that the nth term is arn−1.
Summing a ﬁnite geometric progression uses a nice argument. Let
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + · · · + arn−1
be the sum to n terms of such a GP. Now multiply the series through by r to get
rSn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · + arn
Then on subtracting the two series we obtain
Sn −rSn = (1 −r)Sn = ar −arn
103

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
because all terms but the ﬁrst and last cancel out.
So
Sn = a(1 −rn)
1 −r

You can practice your skills in handling fractions by checking this directly.
Another interesting series is the arithmetic series
S = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) . . .
where each successive term is formed by adding a ‘common difference’ d, so that the nth
term is a + (n −1)d. In this case we have
Sn = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + · · · + (a + (n −1)d)
and a neat way to sum this is to reverse the series and add corresponding terms of the two
results:
Sn = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + · · · + (a + (n −1)d)
= (a + (n −1)d) + (a + (n −2)d) + · · · + a
So
2Sn = (2a + (n −1)d) + (2a + (n −1)d) + · · · + (2a + (n −1)d)
= n(2a + (n −1)d)
and therefore
Sn = 1
2n(2a + (n −1)d)
for the arithmetic series.

3.2.10 Inﬁnite series
➤
89
110 ➤
Merely the mention of the term ‘inﬁnite’ sets alarm bells ringing with many of us. An
inﬁnite series is one whose terms continue forever, or indeﬁnitely. We tend to indicate this
by such notation as
S∞= 1 + 1
3 + 1
9 + 1
27 + · · ·
where the dots (technically called an ellipsis – a set of three dots indicating an omission
of something understood) infer that the terms continue forever following the same pattern,
which it is hoped you have spotted. In this case we see that the nth term is
 1
3
	n−1.
Of course, if we are adding up an inﬁnite number of terms we might expect that the sum
would yield an inﬁnite amount (i.e. a number as large as we please). This would certainly
be the case for 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · for example. Maybe if the terms get smaller and smaller
this would not be so? Maybe, for example, the series
1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 + · · ·
‘converges’ to a ﬁnite total? After all, the terms seem to fade away to zero ‘eventually’.
In fact the answer is no – it in fact adds up to an inﬁnite amount, as we shall see in
Chapter 14, by one of the prettiest proofs of elementary mathematics. In fact the question
of the ‘convergence’ of such inﬁnite series is a very difﬁcult topic belonging to an area
of mathematics called analysis. We will leave such questions until Chapter 14. For the
moment we will take the pragmatic view that if we can ﬁnd an expression for the sum of
a series by fair means then that series converges and we can use the sum with safety.
In particular, we can sum a GP to inﬁnity provided that the common ratio, r, satisﬁes
|r| < 1. We have for the inﬁnite GP:
S∞= a + ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · =
∞

n=1
arn−1
The sum of the ﬁrst n terms of this is, from Section 3.2.9
Sn = a(1 −rn)
1 −r
=
a
1 −r −arn
1 −r
105

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
The only place n occurs here is in the rn. Now, if |r| < 1, then rn ‘tends to’ zero as n
gets larger and larger, i.e. rn tends to zero as n tends to inﬁnity, or in symbols, rn →0 as
n →∞if |r| < 1. We will look further into such ‘limits’ in Chapter 14. So as n tends to
inﬁnity the second term in expression for the sum Sn goes to zero and the sum to inﬁnity is
S∞=
a
1 −r
Note that if r ≥1 then the series will not converge to a ﬁnite quantity because rn increases
indeﬁnitely in value as n increases if |r| > 1, while a/(1 −r) does not exist at all if r = 1.
Example
Consider the series we started with:
S∞= 1 + 1
3 + 1
9 + 1
27 + · · · = 1 + 1
3 +
1
3
2
+
1
3
3

Here the ﬁrst term is 1 and the common ratio is 1
3:
a = 1,
r = 1
3
so
S∞=
1
1 −1
3
= 3
2
Solution to review question 3.1.10
Using the result that S∞= a/(1 −r), for the sum of an inﬁnite GP with
ﬁrst term a = 1
2 and common ratio r = 1
2 we have
S∞=

3.2.11 Inﬁnite binomial series
➤
89
110 ➤
Another important type of inﬁnite series is that obtained by applying the binomial theorem
with negative or fractional power. Referring back to Section 2.2.13 we can write for the
binomial expansion for n an integer
(1 + x)n = 1 + nx + · · · + n(n −1)
2!
x2 + n(n −1)(n −2)
3!
x3
+ · · · + n(n −1) . . . (n −r + 1)
r!
xr + · · ·
Now we have certainly not proved that this holds if n is not an integer. For example if n
is a negative integer, or a fraction, then it is by no means obvious that the result will still
hold. However, it can be shown that it does hold, but there is one dramatic difference if n
is not a positive integer. In this case the series will never terminate because only positive
106

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
integers are subtracted from n and n −r + 1 will never become zero because r is an integer
whereas n is not. So the expansion becomes an inﬁnite series. In such cases it is called an
inﬁnite power series in x. Such series can be used to express functions in a convenient
form for calculation, and we return to them in Chapter 14. For now, just accept the formal
generalisation to non-integer values of n. It can be shown that the resulting inﬁnite series
converges if |x| < 1, diverges if |x| > 1 and if |x| = 1 it may diverge or converge.
Example
1
1 −x = (1 −x)−1 = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + · · ·
provided |x| < 1
In this case it is obvious that the series will diverge for |x| ≥1.
This series is a standard result of such importance that you should memorise it. This is
not too difﬁcult – it is in fact the sum of an inﬁnite GP with common ratio x. It is useful
in making approximations such as
1
1 −x ≃1 + x for x very small
Solution to review question 3.1.11
Applying the binomial expansion
(1 + x)n = 1 + nx + · · · + n(n −1)
2!
x2 + n(n −1)(n −2)
3!
x3
+ · · · + n(n −1) . . . (n −r + 1)
r!
xr + · · ·
we have
(1 + 3x)−2 = 1 + (−2)(3x) + (−2)(−3)
2!
(3x)2
+ (−2)(−3)(−4)
3!
(3x)3 + · · ·
Note the careful treatment of the signs and the 3x – it is usually a good
policy to keep such things in brackets until the ﬁnal stages of the calcula-
tion. Tidying up the results we ﬁnd for the ﬁrst four terms
(1 + 3x)−2 = 1 −6x + 27x2 −108x3 + · · ·

Exponential and Logarithm Functions
The exponential function is one of the most important in engineering. It describes behaviour
that is of a rapidly increasing or decreasing nature – for example bacterial growth or
radioactive decay. Yet the exponential function is found to be one of the most troublesome
for newcomers to engineering mathematics. This chapter therefore introduces the key ideas
quite gently.
Prerequisites
It will be helpful if you know something about:
• powers and indices (70
➤
)
• plotting graphs (91
➤
)
• irrational numbers (6
➤
)
• binomial theorem (106
➤
)
• inverse of a function (100
➤
)
Objectives
In this chapter you will ﬁnd
• functions of the form y = an where a is given and n is an integer
• the general exponential function ax
• the natural exponential function ex
• manipulation of the exponential function
• logarithms to general base a
• manipulation of logarithms
• some applications of logarithms
Motivation
You may need the topics of this chapter for:
• the exponential form of complex numbers (Chapter 12)
• solving differential equations (Chapter 15)
• modelling engineering, scientiﬁc and other situations where some quantity grows
or decays very rapidly – ‘exponentially’
• converting power laws to linear form

The exponential function is essentially a power function in which the exponent is the
variable. As such it obeys all the usual rules of indices. We can get some idea of the

behaviour of the exponential function by looking at the behaviour of the power function
for different values of the index, as shown in the review question.

(iii) Drawing a smooth curve through the points for y = 2n gives the curve
for y = 2x. Similarly for y = 2−x. y = 3x(3−x) will be similar but
will increase (decrease) more rapidly (see Figure 4.1).
4.2.2 The general exponential function ax
➤
119 136 ➤
In Section 2.2.12 we covered the laws of indices, including such things as am × an = am+n.
Although it was not the intention, it was perhaps easy to get the impression that the indices
121

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
m, n are ‘constant’ and to think in terms of a power function xn, etc. where the base, x,
is variable and n is given. However, it is just as possible to let the base be ﬁxed and let
the power be any variable. This gives a function of the form
f (x) = ax
a ̸= 0
where the base a is now regarded as constant, and the exponent x can vary. Such a
function is called exponential. But of course x is still just an index, and obeys all the
usual rules of indices (70
➤
). One important point to note at this stage is that since x
can take fractional values it is essential that a be positive to deliver real values of the
function for all values of x. x itself can of course be positive or negative. The results of
Section 4.2.1 give us a feel for the shape of the graph of exponential functions. Basically
such graphs can take three different forms:
•
base a > 1, the graph increases steadily from left to right. We say ax
increases monotonically with x;
•
a < 1 the graph decreases steadily from left to right −ax decreases
monotonically with x;
•
if a = 1 we get the straight line y = 1.
These results are illustrated in the graphs of Figure 4.2.

The exponential function satisﬁes all the usual laws of indices, which are worth repeating
here in the new notation:

(ax)y = axy
(ab)x = axbx
a−x = 1

122

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
We need to say something about the deﬁnition of ax for different values of x, building on
the work in Section 1.2.7. If x = n is a positive integer, then for any real number a we
know that we can deﬁne
ax = an ≡a × a × · · · × a



n factors
simply in terms of elementary algebraic operations.
Similarly, if x = −n is a negative integer then we can deﬁne
ax = a−n = (a−1)n = a−1 × a−1 × · · · × a−1



n factors
And of course, by deﬁnition
a0 = 1
In these deﬁnitions there is no need for any qualiﬁcation on the real number a – it can be
positive, negative, rational, irrational.
We can extend the deﬁnition of ax to the case when x is a fraction or rational number
by deﬁning a
1
q , where q is an integer, as the positive real number such that when raised
to the power q it yields a:
(a
1
q )q ≡a
We say a
1
q is the qth root of a, sometimes written q√a. However, complications arise
if a is negative, so henceforth we insist that a is positive, then ax will always be a real
function.
For x = p/q a rational number we can now deﬁne ax by
ax = a
p
q = (a
1
q )p
So, provided x is a rational number, and a > 0, the exponential function, ax, is a well
deﬁned function of x. The extension to the case when x is an irrational number is not a
trivial step, but we will assume that it can be done and therefore that ax is in fact deﬁned
for all real values of x, rational or irrational, provided a is positive.
Solution to review question 4.1.2
A. If f (x) = ax then f (y) = ay and so
f (x)f (y) = axay = ax+y = f (x + y)
f (x −y) = ax−y = ax/ay = f (x)/f (y)
B. We simply apply the rules of indices but with the indices as functions
of x.

4.2.3 The natural exponential function ex
➤
119 136 ➤
The most commonly used exponential function – usually referred to as the exponen-
tial function – is ex, where e is a number whose value to 16 decimal places (!) is
e ≃2.7182818284590452. e is called the base of natural logarithms. It is an irra-
tional number. Like π, it cannot be expressed as a fraction, or as a terminating or
repeating decimal. Its decimal part goes on indeﬁnitely. There are a number of equiv-
alent deﬁnitions we could give for ex, but it has to be said that none of them is easy to
appreciate at the elementary level. Below we will study in detail perhaps the most natural
derivation of an expression for ex, by considering compound interest. For now, accept
the following deﬁnitions as a general introduction to the properties of the exponential
function.
We will see later that the particular exponential function ex can be deﬁned by its inﬁnite
series
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + · · ·
Using this form, if you know some elementary differentiation, then you can discover for
yourself why the exponential function is so important:
Problem 1
Differentiate the series for ex term by term – what do you get? You may
assume
d
dx .xn/ = nxn−1
You should ﬁnd you get the same series – i.e.
dex
dx = ex
So the derivative of the exponential function is the function itself. This explains the special
role played by ex and its importance in, for example, differential equations (Chapter 15).
There are many situations where rate of change is proportional to amount present – e.g.
bacterial growth, radioactive decay (e−x is the relevant function in the latter case).
124

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
One rigorous method of deﬁning the exponential function ex is by means of a limit. This
is quite an advanced concept that we only address in Chapter 14 and there is a temptation
to gloss over the idea here. However, the work is so important (and not without interest!)
that we will give it a try – don’t worry if it is too much for you at this stage, you should
be able to handle the exponential function well enough without studying the next couple of
pages. However, if you can ﬁnd your way through this work it will be of great beneﬁt to
you, as well as providing practice in some techniques of algebra. We are going to approach
the limit involved in the exponential function by considering a limiting process arising in
the study of compound interest. You can try to work out some of the details yourself.
Problem 2
Suppose you borrow £C at an interest of I % compounded monthly, so
that the interest added at the end of each month is at I
12%, and you do
not pay off any of the loan until after a year
How much debt do you have at the end of the year?
At the end of the ﬁrst month you owe
£

C + I
12
C
100

= £C

1 +
I
1200

At the end of the second month you owe
£C

 
1 +
I




1 +
I

2
and so on.
So after 12 months you owe
£C

1 +
I
1200
12
Now suppose the terms were changed and interest was compounded daily. Then at the
end of a non-leap year you would owe
£C

1 +
I
36500
365
By the hour:
£C

1 +
I
876000
8760
and I will leave you to give the result if interest is calculated by the minute, or second
(RE 4.3.3A).
In general, if the interest is compounded at a constant rate over each of n equal time
intervals in the year, then the amount owing at the end of the year will be

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
This is all very well – but how do we actually calculate this? As n gets larger and larger
it gets more and more difﬁcult. In particular, what would happen if n became inﬁnitely
large – equivalently, interest is being added continuously. In this case the result can be
expressed as a limit:
£ lim
n→∞C

1 +

n
Putting x =
I
100 and dropping the constant factor C this shows that a limit of the form
lim
n→∞
	
1 + x
n

n
is very important. This limit is a function of x (because the n disappears on taking the
limit), and is in fact a deﬁnition of ex:
ex = lim
n→∞
	
1 + x
n

n
(4.1)
This may seem an unusual way to deﬁne a function, but it does show how ex is intimately
related to an important process of accumulating compound interest and natural growth and
decay in general. In fact it can be shown that ex deﬁned in this way as a limit does indeed
satisfy all the laws of indices (see Section 4.2.4 below).
We therefore take the limit (Equation 4.1) as our deﬁnition of the exponential function
ex, which is also written exp(x). This deﬁnition can in fact be used to obtain the inﬁnite
series for ex. You can try this yourself, using the binomial theorem:

We can calculate the value of e to any required accuracy by taking a sufﬁcient number
of terms of this series. For example, summing the ﬁrst 11 terms of the above series (i.e.
r = 10) gives e as 2.71828 to 5 decimal places. As noted earlier e is an irrational number.
When your calculator gives you a ‘value’ for e, it is only an approximation to the available
number of decimal places – to give the exact value of e it would need to have a display
of inﬁnite length.
The graph of an exponential function is very simple, see Figure 4.3. In view of the way
we have derived ex – by considering the growth of debt, it should now be no surprise to
you that the function
y = ex
is often described as representing the law of natural growth. For example, it might
describe unrestrained bacterial growth. The function
y = e−x = (e−1)x
on the other hand deﬁnes the law of natural decay. For example it describes the decrease
in mass of a radioactive element over time. Its graph is also shown in Figure 4.3.

4.2.4 Manipulation of the exponential function

e0 = 1
You need to be very proﬁcient at using these rules. You will frequently need to manipulate
functions of exponential functions, whatever area of engineering you enter.
Perhaps the most important thing to remember about the exponential function is that
eA+B is not equal to eA + eB. This is an error made by many beginners. The correct result
is of course
eA+B = eAeB

4.2.5 Logarithms to general base
➤
120 137 ➤
What about the inverse function (100
➤
) of the exponential function? That is, if
y = ax
then what is x in terms of y?
By deﬁnition, we call the inverse of the exponential function the logarithm to base a
and write
x = loga y
Note that a must be positive if we are to avoid complex numbers and it must not be equal
to unity, since 1 raised to any power will again be 1.
In the special case of the exponential ex, we call the inverse the natural logarithm,
denoted ln. Thus if
y = ex, then x = loge y = ln y
An equivalent deﬁnition of the logarithm of a number x to base a is as that power to
which the base must be raised to give x. That is,
x = aloga x
In particular
x = eln x
Note that since ax can never be negative, then loga y is only deﬁned for positive values of
y. This is sometimes emphasised by writing loga |y|, although often we omit the modulus
signs and simply take it for granted that all real quantities under a logarithm are to be
assumed positive.
From the deﬁnition of loga x it also follows that
x = loga ax
and in particular
x = ln ex
130

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

The two results
x = eln x and x = ln ex
expressing the fact that the exponential and the log are inverse functions of each other are
extremely important in advanced mathematics and are used repeatedly in, for example, the
solution of differential equations (Chapter 15).
Solution to review question 4.1.5
It is perhaps easiest to think of loga x as the power to which a must be
raised to give x – then if we can express x in the form ay, y will be the
value we want.
(i) log10 1 = log10 100 = 0
In fact, log of 1 to any base (except 1!) is zero

a negative number and expect a real number.
(v) loga(a4) = 4
(vi) loga(ax) = x
(vii) log3 1 = log3 30 = 0
(viii) ln e = loge e = 1
Of course, e is no different to any other log base in this respect.
(ix) ln √e = ln e

4.2.6 Manipulation of logarithms
➤
120 137 ➤
Since the log is basically just an index or power, the properties of logs can be deduced
from the laws of indices. We ﬁnd, for any base a (positive and not equal 1):
•
log 1 = 0 because a0 = 1
•
log(xy) = log x + log y
Put x = as, y = at so s = log x and t = log y then xy = as+t so s + t =
log x + log y = log(xy)
•
log(x/y) = log x −log y
Put x = as, y = at so s = log x and t = log y then x/y = as−t so s −
t = log x −log y = log(x/y)
131

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
•
log xα = α log x
Put x = as, so s = log x, then xα = (as)α = asα = aαs and so αs =
log xα = α log x
The last result holds for any real number α, positive or negative, rational or irrational.
Sometimes we need to change the base of a logarithm. Thus, suppose we have loga x
and we wish to convert this to a form involving logb x, b ̸= a, we have
y = loga x
so
x = ay

(4.2)
and therefore
logb x = logb ay = y logb a
= loga x logb a
So
loga x = logb x
logb a
In particular, if x = b this gives
loga b =
1
logb a
For completeness we will anticipate Chapter 8 here and mention that the derivative of the
natural log function is simply the reciprocal:
d
dx (ln x) = 1
x
Equations of the form
ax = b
occur frequently in engineering applications and may be solved by using logs. Thus, taking
logs to base a we have
loga(ax) = loga b
= x loga a = x
So
x = loga b
The graph of the logarithm function follows easily from that of the exponential function,
its inverse, by reﬂecting the latter in the line y = x (101
➤
). This is shown in Figure 4.4.

Alternatively, if log2 x = 6 then x = 26 = (23)2 = 82, so log8 x = 2,
as above.
C. ln y = 2 ln x−1 + ln(x −1) + ln(x + 1)

4.2.7 Some applications of logarithms
➤
120 138 ➤
When an unknown occurs in an index in an equation, as for example in
ax = b
then we may be able to solve the equation by taking logs. If the base a happened to be
e then, of course, the ‘natural’ thing to do would be to take natural logs, but we can use
the same idea whatever the base. Thus, taking natural logs we obtain
ln(ax) = x ln a = ln b
so
x = ln b
ln a
Conversely, if an unknown occurs in a logarithm, then we can sometimes solve by taking
an exponential. For example, the equation
log2(x + 1) = 3 + log2 x
can be solved by ﬁrst gathering the logs together to give
log2(x + 1) −log2 x = log2
x + 1
x

= 3
We can now remove the log by exponentiating with 2 – i.e. raising 2 to the power of each
side to give (2 to the power of log2 x is x)
x + 1
x
= 23 = 8
from which we ﬁnd x = 1

Logs can also be used to simplify graphical representation of certain functions. Thus,
given any function of the form
y = kxα
We can take logs to any base and obtain
log y = log(kxα)
= log k + α log x
If we now put
X = log x
Y = log y
then we obtain the equation:
Y = αX + log k
If Y is plotted against X on rectangular Cartesian axes, as in Section 3.2.2, then this is
a straight line. As we will see in Section 7.2.4 this line has gradient, or slope, α and an
intercept on the y axis of log k.
Solution to review question 4.1.7
A. If 2x+1 = 5 then taking natural logs of both sides gives
ln(2x+1) = (x + 1) ln 2 = ln 5
So
x + 1 = ln 5
ln 2 = 2.322
to three decimal places, so x = 1.322
B. If y = 3x6
then taking logs to any convenient base a we have
loga y = loga(3x6)
= loga(x6) + loga 3
= 6 loga x + loga 3
Put
X = loga x
Y = loga y
to get the form of a straight line equation:
Y = 6X + loga 3
The gradient of this line is 6 and its intercept on the y-axis is loga 3

You will see many applications of the exponential function in later chapters, particularly
in complex numbers, differential equations and the Laplace transform.
1. The hyperbolic functions cosh, sinh, tanh are deﬁned by
cosh x = ex + e−x
2
(hyperbolic cosine)
sinh x = ex −e−x
2
(hyperbolic sine)
tanh x = sinh x
cosh x
(hyperbolic tan)
These are frequently occurring functions in engineering – for example the shape of a
cable suspended at two ends can be described by the catenary, which is essentially the
cosh x curve. The hyperbolic functions obey very similar identities to the trig functions.
In particular, show that
(i) cosh2 x −sinh2 x = 1
(cosh2 x = (cosh x)2, etc.).
(ii) sinh(A + B) = sinh A cosh B + sinh B cosh A.
Use trig identities to suggest other hyperbolic identities and use the above deﬁnitions
to conﬁrm them.
(iii) Evaluate cosh 0, sinh 0.

5.2 Revision
5.2.1 Division of a line in a given ratio
➤
143 160 ➤
Points and lines are regarded as undeﬁned primitive concepts (that is, we assume we
all know what is meant by them) in geometry, in terms of which the axioms or rules of
geometry may then be expressed. A point is a geometrical element which has a position,
but no size or extent. A line is a straight one-dimensional geometrical ﬁgure of inﬁnite
length and no thickness. There is a unique straight line passing through two speciﬁed
points A and B. A line segment is a ﬁnite portion of a line between two ﬁxed points.
Its length is the shortest distance between the points in a plane. Note that we are talking
simply about geometry on a plane here, rather than, for example spherical geometry, which
deals with geometrical properties on the surface of a sphere.
Much elementary geometry depends on the division of a line by a point. We say a point
P on a line AB divides the line internally in the ratio p : q if P is between A and B
and AP : P B = p : q, or AP
P B = p
q (14
➤
).
If a point P is on AB produced (that is, extended in the direction AB), then P is said
to divide AB externally in the ratio p : q if AP : P B = p : q or AP
P B = p
q .
Solution to review question 5.1.1
For division internally we have, letting AP = x cm, say:
P
A
B
x
30 − x
Then P B = (30 −x) cm, and since
AP : P B = 3 : 2
we have
x
30 −x = 3
2 or 2x = 3(30 −x) = 90 −3x
or
5x = 90
So x = 18 and hence
AP = 18 cm and P B = 12cm.
Alternatively, if we let the length of AP be 3y units and that of
P B 2y units, then 3y + 2y = 5y = 30, from which y = 6. Thus, AP is
18 cm and P B 12 cm as before.
For division externally let AP = x then, from the ﬁgure below,
AP
P B =
x
x −30 = 3

or
x = 90
147

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

5.2.2 Intersecting and parallel lines and angular measurement
➤
143 160 ➤
Given two intersecting lines, in a plane, the angle between them is the amount of rota-
tion required to superimpose one on the other, measured in some conventional (usually
anticlockwise as shown) direction. We denote the angle by ̸ AOB (see Figure 5.10).
A
∠AOB
B
O
Figure 5.10 Deﬁnition of angle.
Sometimes, if it is helpful, we use an arc to denote an angle, but usually we try to
avoid cluttering up a diagram. The angle is usually measured in degrees, with one degree,
denoted 1°, being 1/360 of a full rotation. Alternatively, we can measure angles in radians.
One radian (1 rad or 1c for ‘circular measure’) is essentially the angle subtended at the
centre of a circle by an arc of length equal to the radius. If this rather obtruse deﬁnition
does little for you, just note that the number of radians in a complete revolution will be
the number of times that the radius divides the circumference, which is simply 2π. So
there are 2π radians in a complete revolution and therefore
2π radians = 360 degrees = 360°
Since 180° is half a full rotation, it follows that angles which add together to make 180°
form a straight line – such angles are called supplementary.

In Figure 5.11 ̸ AOC and ̸ COB are supplementary. An angle of 90° is a rotation
through a quarter circle and is called a right angle. In diagrams a right angle between
two lines is always denoted by a small square at their intersection – if this is not present
then you cannot assume the angle is 90°, even though it may look like it on the diagram.
Angles which add up to 90° are called complementary angles. Two lines which intersect
at right angles are said to be perpendicular to each other. Angles between 0° and 90° are
called acute. Angles between 90° and 180° are called obtuse. Angles greater than 180°
are called reﬂex.
When two lines intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal:
b
b
a
a
Figure 5.12 Intersecting lines.
Two lines are parallel if they do not intersect, no matter how far they are extended – we
say they ‘meet at inﬁnity (wherever that is)’. We denote parallel lines by equal numbers
of arrow-heads as in Figure 5.13. Equal angles are denoted by equal numbers of crossbars
on the angle arcs.
a
b
c
Figure 5.13 Angles on parallel lines.
As noted earlier, remember that we are talking about plane geometry here. Parallel
lines drawn on the surface of a sphere for example do not satisfy the sorts of properties
we will be discussing for parallel lines in a plane.
The line drawn crossing the parallel lines in Figure 5.13 is called a transversal. In
Figure 5.13 pairs of angles such as a and b, on opposite sides of the transversal are called
alternate angles, while pairs of angles a and c are called corresponding angles. For two
parallel lines, as shown in Figure 5.13 alternate angles are equal, as are corresponding
angles, i.e. a = b = c.

B. Referring to Figure 5.1 a and c are both supplementary angles to 40°

thus given by b = 40°.
C. (i) By vertically opposite angles for intersecting lines we have a =
60° in Figure 5.2(i). Then by corresponding angles b = a = 60°.
Finally, supplementary angles give c = 180° −60° = 120°.
(ii) Corresponding angles in Figure 5.2(ii) give a = 85°, then b = 85°,
whence opposite angles gives c = b = 85°. Corresponding angles
then gives d = c = 85°. Supplementary angles ﬁnally gives e =
180° −85° = 95°.
5.2.3 Triangles and their elementary properties
➤
144 160 ➤
A triangle is any plane ﬁgure with three sides formed from line segments. There are three
types of interest – a scalene triangle has three sides, and angles, of different lengths; an
isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length standing on a base side with which the
two equal sides make equal angles; an equilateral triangle has all three sides of equal
length and three equal angles (all 60°). A triangle in which all angles are acute is called
an acute-angled triangle. If one angle is 90° it is called a right-angled triangle. If one
angle exceeds 90° we say the triangle is obtuse.
The most basic property of a plane triangle is that the sum of its angles is 180°. (This
is not true for ‘spherical triangles’, drawn on the surface of a sphere – can you think of
a ‘triangle’ on a sphere that has 270°?) This property of plane triangles is worth proving
in terms of elementary facts of which we are already sure. We can do this for a general
triangle ABC, acute-angle or obtuse, as follows. Draw a straight line, through A, parallel
150

E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
to the opposite side BC – see Figure 5.14. Since we already know that for two parallel
lines, alternate angles are equal, then we can say a = d and c = e.

Also, from angles on a straight line we have
a + b + c = 180°
Hence
d + b + e = 180°
which proves the result.
Another important property of triangles is that an exterior angle of a triangle is equal
to the sum of the two opposite interior angles.
Again, the proof involves additional construction and is not difﬁcult, as shown in
Figure 5.15.

AC is ‘produced’ or extended to D. An additional line is also drawn through C parallel to
AB. Then, by alternate angles we have d = b, and by corresponding angles we have e = a.
So, d + e = external angle at C = a + b, as required, i.e. ̸ BCD = ̸ BAC + ̸ CBA.
Solution to review question 5.1.3
(i) Referring to Figure 5.3(i) we have a = 180° −70° −60° = 50° by
angles in a triangle. Then b = 70° + 60° = 130° by the external angle
result, or alternatively by angles on a straight line b = 180° −a =
180° −50° = 130°.
(ii) Since the triangle in Figure 5.3(ii) is isosceles, a = 65°. So b = 180° −
2 × 65° = 50° and c = b + 65° = 115° by the external angle result or
by angles on a line c = 180° −65° = 115°.

5.2.4 Congruent triangles
➤
144 161 ➤
We often need to compare pairs of triangles. Two triangles are called congruent if they
are identical. They may not look identical, because they may be rotated with respect to
each other, so we need a test to determine when two triangles are identical. For this, the
corresponding angles of the two triangles must be identical, and the corresponding sides
must be of the same length. However, it is not necessary to check all these conditions
to ensure that two triangles are congruent. The following provide alternative tests for
congruent triangles:
•
three sides of one triangle must be equal to three sides of the other
•
two sides and the angle between them in one triangle must be equal to
two sides and the enclosed angle in the other triangle
•
two angles and one side in one triangle must be equal to two angles
and the corresponding side in the second triangle
•
for right-angled triangles, the right angle, hypotenuse and side in the
ﬁrst triangle must be equal to the right angle, hypotenuse and the corre-
sponding side in the second triangle.
Solution to review question 5.1.4
(i) In Figure 5.4(i) AD is equal to BC, and DC is equal to AB. AC is
a common side. So ACD and ABC are congruent triangles, since all
corresponding sides are equal.
(ii) With AC as a common side and two identical sides AB, AD, the
triangles ABC and ACD in Figure 5.4(ii) have two sides of identical
length. They also have two equal angles ̸ DCA and ̸ ACB. However,
these angles are not those between the pair of identical sides in the
two triangles (second test in the text above) so the triangles are not
necessarily congruent.
5.2.5 Similar triangles
➤
145 162 ➤
If one triangle is simply an enlargement or rotation of another triangle, then we say the
two triangles are similar. So the three angles of one triangle are equal to the three angles
of the other, similar triangle, and the corresponding sides of the two triangles are in the
same ratio. However, we don’t need to test both of these conditions, since it can be shown
that they are equivalent, i.e. that if two triangles contain the same angles then their
corresponding sides are in the same ratio.
Solution to review question 5.1.5
Since ABC and DEF in Figure 5.5 are similar, then the ratios of corre-
sponding sides are equal.
(i) In this case the ratio is equal to BC/FE = 5/3.
(ii) Thus, AB/DE = 4/DE = 5/3 whence DE = 12/5 cm. Similarly(!)
AC/DF = 3/DF = 5/3, so DF = 9/5 cm.

Angle BAC looks like a right angle, but this doesn’t mean that it is.
In fact in this case it is, because, as you may have noticed, the sides
satisfy Pythagoras: 32 + 42 = 52(➤154).
5.2.6 The intercept theorem
➤
145 162 ➤
The intercept theorem states that a straight line drawn parallel to one side of a triangle
divides the other two sides in the same ratio (14
➤
) (see Figure 5.16) i.e. AD/DC =
AE/EB.
D
C
B
E
A
Figure 5.16 The intercept theorem.
Thus, for example, if we know AD, DC, AE say then we can deduce EB.
The proof of this theorem may be found in most standard books on geometry and relies
on the fact that ABC and AED are similar triangles.
Solution to review question 5.1.6
(i) By the intercept theorem, since ED is parallel to CB in Figure 5.6(i),
the line ED divides sides AC and AB in the same ratio. Hence
AE
EC = 4
6 = AD
DB =
5
DB
So DB = 15/2 units.
(ii) This is the case where the parallel intercept is actually outside the
triangle (Figure 5.6(ii)). This in fact makes no difference to the result
and again, by the intercept theorem,
AD
DC = 3
1.5 = BD
DE = BD
2
So DB = 4 units.
5.2.7 The angle bisector theorem
➤
145 163 ➤
The intercept theorem is about dividing the sides of triangles. Here we consider a theorem
which divides an angle of a triangle: the line bisecting an angle of a triangle divides
the side opposite to that angle in the ratio (14
➤
) of the sides containing the angle
(see Figure 5.17).

AP = Altitude

AD = Angle bisector
Figure 5.17 Altitude, median and angle bisector.
So the angle bisector theorem states that

DB
The angle bisector should not be confused with two other lines dropped from a vertex of
a triangle – the altitude and the median, also shown in Figure 5.17. The altitude is the
line drawn from a vertex of a triangle, perpendicular to the opposite side. A median of a
triangle is the line joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. You might like
to explore the circumstances under which two or more of these lines are in fact the same
thing.
Solution to review question 5.1.7
By the angle bisector theorem we have, in Figure 5.7.
AC
AB = CD

So DB = CD × AB

We can see that this works by checking it for a few simple triangles – the 3 : 4 : 5 being the
classic example. But this is not a proof – it is merely induction from a few cases, not deduc-
tion from fundamental axioms. There are numerous proofs of Pythagoras’ theorem – we will
give one which has the sort of common sense appeal an engineer might enjoy.
Take four identical copies of any right-angled triangle, sides a, b, c and arrange them
as shown in Figure 5.19, to form a square of side a. While you are at it, just check
that all your visual arguments can be expressed solely in purely symbolic or geometrical
terms – imagine, for example, that you could not see or draw the diagram, and that you
had to describe and justify the whole thing to a friend.
Now from triangles AED and DHC, DH = c and DE = b, so HE, the side of the
small internal square is b −c. The same argument applies to all pairs of adjacent triangles.

Figure 5.20 Deﬁnitions in circles.
There is not much that can be said about the circle in isolation, other than to note its
perfect symmetry and the standard perimeter formula ‘2πr’ and area formula ‘πr2’ where
r is the radius. It is when you start considering parts or arcs of the circle, or particular
lines related to the circle that things get interesting. First note that, in geometry, we are
not concerned so much with measuring aspects of the circle or its parts. We are more
concerned about relations between them, independent of numerical values. An example
would be the result that chords which are equidistant from the centre are of the same
length. This result does not help in calculating the lengths of chords, it simply states a
relationship between certain types of chords. Two obvious lines of importance are the
radius and tangent. As shown in Figure 5.20 the tangent is perpendicular to the radius at
its point of contact.
Consider an arc of a circle – a connected part of the circumference. If the arc has length
less than half of the circumference then it is called a minor arc, otherwise it is a major
arc. In Figure 5.21

the angle subtended by the minor arc AB at the centre O is ̸ AOB. We say the angle
̸ ACB stands on the minor arc AB, which is said to subtend an angle ̸ ACB at the
circumference. Exactly the same statements can be made replacing C by D. Implicit in
the deﬁnitions is the assumption that there is just one angle subtended at the circumfer-
ence – i.e. that ̸ ACB = ̸ ADB. As we state below, this is in fact the case.
Now let’s add a chord to the circle. There are two important results to note regarding
chords.
•
Chords equidistant from the centre are of equal lengths
To see this consider the triangles formed by connecting the ends of two such chords
to the centre. These two triangles have two corresponding sides (the radii) equal, and the
corresponding enclosed angles are equal. The triangles are therefore congruent, and so
their third sides (i.e. the length of the chords) are also equal.
•
The perpendicular bisector of a chord of a circle passes through the
centre of the circle
The proof is similar to that of the ﬁrst result using congruent triangles, but the result is
sufﬁciently ‘self evident’ to gloss over here.
The next results concern the angles subtended by arcs at the centre and on the circum-
ference. Whilst it is important that you understand and can use the results, the proofs are
not important to us here.
•
The angle subtended by an arc at the centre of a circle is twice the
angle subtended at the circumference (Figure 5.22)
O
O
a

2a

Figure 5.22 Angle subtended at the centre is twice that on the circumference.
•
All angles subtended at the circumference by the same arc are equal
•
The angle in a semicircle is 90° – i.e. the angle subtended by a diam-
eter is a right angle
The last result follows from the fact that a semicircle subtends an angle of 180° at the
centre of a circle. Any angle subtended at the circumference must, by the above results,
be equal to half this, namely 90°.
Finally, we give some important results relating to the properties of tangents to circles.
A tangent to a circle is a straight line which touches it at exactly one point – the point
of contact. A straight line which cuts a circle at two distinct points is called a secant (a
chord is thus a segment of a secant). An important property of the tangent is:
157

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
•
A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius drawn through
the point of contact.
O
Figure 5.23 Tangent perpendicular to radius.
One can see this by constructing two radii extended to any two points either side and
equidistant from the point of contact (Figure 5.23). By symmetry, the resulting triangles
have corresponding sides equal and are therefore congruent (152
➤
) and must have corre-
sponding angles equal. This implies that the angle of intersection between the tangent and
radius at point of contact is 1
2 × 180° = 90°.
Two other important results are
•
The two tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal
in length.
•
The angle between a tangent and a chord through the point of
contact is equal to the angle subtended by the chord in the alternate
segment (Figure 5.24).

M a t h e m a t i c s
Solution to review question 5.1.9
(i) Referring to Figure 5.8, a = 360° −̸ AOB, and ̸ AOB = 2̸ ACB =
2 × 40° = 80°. So a = 280°.
(ii) Equal angles subtended by equal arcs gives ̸ ACB = c = ̸ ADB =
30°. Angles in triangle ABD then gives a = 180° −30° −70° = 80°.
Equal angles subtended by equal arcs now gives ̸ DAC = 20° =
̸ DBC = b. So a = 80°, b = 20°, c = 30°.
(iii) OA = OB, so triangle ABO is isosceles and therefore a = 35° and
b = 180° −35° −90° = 55°, since the chord bisector OP is perpen-
dicular to the chord AB.
(iv) The angle ̸ DAB is subtended by a diameter and is therefore 90°.
So from triangle ABD, ̸ ABD = 180° −30° −90° = 60°. But the
angles subtended by the chord AD at B and C are the same and so
a = 60° also.
5.2.10 Cyclic quadrilaterals
➤
146 165 ➤
The results so far essentially rely on ﬁtting triangles into circles – we say the circle
circumscribes the triangle. In general, when a circle circumscribes a polygon the vertices
of the polygon lie on the circle. (A circle is circumscribed by a ﬁgure, or inscribed in
a ﬁgure when all sides of the ﬁgure touch the circle.) The next step up is to consider
circumscribed quadrilaterals – i.e. quadrilaterals whose vertices lie on a circle, and sides
inside the circle. This is called a cyclic quadrilateral. See Figure 5.25 showing the cyclic
quadrilateral ABCD.

Figure 5.25 Cyclic quadrilateral.
The main result on cyclic quadrilaterals is that:
•
The opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary –
i.e. add up to 180°.
The proof is interesting and not difﬁcult. In Figure 5.25, with obvious notation we have
2a + 2c = 360° = 2(a + c)
= 2(̸ DAB + ̸ DCB)
Hence
̸ DAB + ̸ DCB = 180°

Solution to review question 5.1.10
(i) In Figure 5.9(i) we have ̸ BAD + ̸ BCD = 180° = a + 125°. So a =
55° by supplementary angles in a cyclic quadrilateral. By angles on a
line, d = 180° −95° = 85°. Then by supplementary angles ̸ ABC =
180 −d = 95° and angles on a line gives b = 180° −95° = 85°.
(ii) In Figure 5.9(ii) opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral gives
a + 3a = 4a = 180°
So a = 45°. Then b = 2a = 90°.

Trigonometry
Trigonometry (literally: ‘the measurement of triangles’ – ‘trig’ from now on) is a fairly
straightforward topic conceptually, but there always seems a lot to remember. In fact you
only have to remember a few key results – but you have to remember them very well. For
example look at the function
cos 2θ
cos θ + sin θ
If you have to consult a formula book to remind yourself that cos 2θ = cos2 θ −sin2 θ and
the difference of squares identity a2 −b2 = (a −b)(a + b) then it might not even occur
to you to simplify this to the form
cos2 θ −sin2 θ
cos θ + sin θ
= (cos θ −sin θ)(cos θ + sin θ)
cos θ + sin θ
= cos θ −sin θ
However, there is no need to remember the double angle formulae in detail because you can
get them easily from the compound angle formulae for cosine and sine, which you should
remember well. In this chapter we will cover such fundamental topics of trigonometry,
and encourage you to learn just a few key formulae very well so that you can use these
to derive other formulae as you need them.

6.2.1 Radian measure and the circle
➤
171 194 ➤
As noted in Section 5.2.2, a radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an
arc with length equal to that of the radius. It follows that
θ radians = 180
π θ degrees
The length of arc of a circle of radius r, subtending angle θ radians at the centre is
by deﬁnition s = rθ. See Figure 6.1. The area of the enclosed sector is A = 1
2r2θ. This
follows because the total area of the circle is πr2 and a sector with angle θ radians forms
a fraction θ
2π of that area.

‘positive direction’ – as shown. Note that for any angle, θ, | sin θ| and | cos θ| are both
≤1. The negative of θ, −θ, means a rotation through angle θ in the clockwise direction
from the positive x-axis. From Figure 6.3 it then follows that cos θ is an even function of
θ, cos(−θ) = cos θ and sin θ is an odd function of θ, sin(−θ) = −sin θ (94
➤
). So, is
tan θ even or odd?
The signs of the trig ratios in the different quadrants can be remembered from ‘All Silly
Tom Cats’ (or you might have learnt ‘CAST’, which is not so jolly), going anticlockwise
round the diagram below
Sine only positive
All positive
Tan only positive
Cosine only positive
which tells us which ratios are positive in the respective quadrants.
It is useful to memorise the trig ratios for the commonly occurring angles 30°, 45°, 60°,
which can be conveniently obtained from the triangles shown in Figure 6.4.

The term ‘cosine’ is not accidental – cosine of θ is the sine of (90 −θ). As noted in
Section 5.2.2, if two angles α, β, sum to 90° they are said to be complementary. β is
the complement of α and vice versa. From the triangle shown in Figure 6.5 it is readily

seen that
sin α = cos β = cos(90° −α)
cos α = sin β = sin(90° −α)
tan α = cot β = cot(90° −α)
cot α = tan β = tan(90° −α)
i.e. the ‘co-trig ratio’ is the ratio of the complementary angle.

6.2.3 Sine and cosine rules and solutions of triangles
➤
172 194 ➤
For general triangles two important rules apply. We use the standard notation – capital
A, B, C for the angles with corresponding lower case letters labelling the opposite sides
(Figure 6.6).
B
C
A
b
a
c
Figure 6.6 Standard labelling of angles and sides.
The sine rule states that
a
sin A =
b
sin B =
c
sin C
i.e. the sides of a triangle are proportional to the sines of the opposite angles. We can see
this by using the result for the area of a triangle −1
2 base × height. We can calculate this
area in three different ways, giving:
1
2bc sin A = 1
2ac sin B = 1
2ab sin C
The sine rule then follows by dividing by 1
2abc and taking the reciprocals of the results.
Incidentally, there is another useful formula (Heron’s formula) for calculating the area
of a triangle with sides a, b, c:
area =

s(s −a)(s −b)(s −c)
178

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
where s = (a + b + c)/2, the semi-perimeter of the triangle. This result is very useful in
surveying, for example.
Note that the sine rule can only be used if we know at least one side and the angle
opposite to that side. Failing such information, we may be able to use the cosine rule,
which states that
a2 = b2 + c2 −2bc cos A
The proof for this is instructive and illustrates yet again the power of Pythagoras – we
only consider the case of acute angles, but the rule holds for all angles.
Consider the triangle shown in Figure 6.7, with altitude h (154
➤
).

C
A

Figure 6.7 Proof of cosine rule.
We have, by Pythagoras’ theorem (154
➤
):
h2 = b2 −x2
= c2 −(a −x)2
which simpliﬁes to (42
➤
)
c2 = a2 + b2 −2ax
But x = b cos C, so
c2 = a2 + b2 −2ab cos C
The result is clearly ‘symmetric’ under the rotation of labels of the sides and corresponding
angles, so we get also
a2 = b2 + c2 −2bc cos A and b2 = a2 + c2 −2ac cos B
It may help to think of it is as
(side)2 = sum of squares of opposite sides
−2× product of opposite sides × cos of their included angle.
179

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
These results may be used to solve triangles given appropriate information. A triangle can
be ‘solved’ for all angles and sides if we know either:
•
three sides
•
two sides and an included angle
•
two angles and one side
•
two sides and a non-included angle – but in this case the answers can
be ambiguous (see RE6.3.3(ii)).
Solution to review question 6.1.3
This is the case of two sides and an included acute angle.
(i) By the cosine rule, with b = 2, c = 5 and A = 60° we have
a2 = 22 + 52 −2 × 2 × 5 × cos 60°
= 4 + 25 −2 × 10 × 1

= 19
So
a =
√
19
(ii) We can now ﬁnd sin θ from the sine rule

sin 60° =

sin 60° =

sin θ = 2 sin 60°

= 0.3974 to 4 decimal places
Hence θ ∼= 23.4°.
Note: The other angle is obtuse (180° −23.4°), but the sine rule
applied to this angle would not tell us this – it is always safest to
go for the angle that is obviously acute when using the sine rule to
solve triangles.
6.2.4 Graphs of the trigonometric functions
➤
172 195 ➤
We now focus on the trig ratios as functions (90
➤
) and look at their graphs (91
➤
).
This requires careful thought about what happens to the trig functions as the independent
variable, θ, changes. As the trig functions are functions of an angular variable their values
will keep repeating – because, for example, θ + 360° is in the same angular position as θ,
and therefore sin(θ + 360°) = sin θ, cos(θ + 360°) = cos θ, etc. We express this generally
by saying that the trigonometric functions cos, sin, and tan are periodic with period 360°
(or 2p) by which we mean that for such functions (NB: in future we will usually use
radian measure for angles, rather than degrees – it is by far the safest policy when we are
regarding the trig ratios as functions, particularly in calculus – as a rule of thumb, if a
180

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
question is given in terms of degrees/radians, then the answer should be given in the same
form)
f (θ + 360°) ≡f (θ + 2π) = f (θ)
Thus, in particular
cos(θ + 2π) = cos θ and tan(θ + 2π) = tan θ
This is reﬂected in the oscillatory nature of the graphs of the functions – the form of the
graph repeats itself at intervals of 2π for sin and cos, and at intervals of π for tan. This
‘minimum repeating interval’ is called the period of the function. In general, if
f (x + p) = f (x) for all x
for some constant p then we say f (x) is periodic with period t. Of course, it also follows
that if f (x) has period p then f (x + np) = f (x) for any positive integer n (provided f
is deﬁned at x + np), but the term ‘period’ is usually reserved for the smallest value of
the period over which the function repeats. What, then, is the actual period of tan θ?
The cosine and sine functions are particularly important in engineering and science,
representing, as they do, general wave-like behaviour. Indeed if you think about the really
fundamental types of physical change that we commonly experience, they are either ‘expo-
nential’ growth or decay (127
➤
), or wave-like/oscillatory, which we can express in terms
of trig functions. Of course, in reality most oscillatory behaviour is ‘damped’, and this is
often expressed by multiplying the trig function by a decaying exponential.
The graphs of the trigonometric functions cos θ, sin θ and tan θ are shown below. cos
and sin repeat every cycle of 2π and oscillate between −1 and +1. tan repeats every cycle
of π, and is ‘discontinuous’ (➤414) at odd multiples of π/2, tending to either −∞or
+∞. Also, notice that the cosine graph is simply the sine graph shifted along the axis by
π/2.

Trig functions are very often used in describing time varying wave-like behaviour, where
a typical functional form might be the sinusoidal function of t:
y = A sin(ωt + α)
Such a wave-like graph is called a sine wave (whether it is cos or sin). A is called
the amplitude of the wave, 2π/ω its period, since it repeats after this cycle, ω/2 its
frequency and α its phase. This terminology is standard in the theory of waves in science
and engineering. The solutions to the review question provide a number of examples.

6.2.5 Inverse trigonometric functions
➤
172 195 ➤
The inverse function (100
➤
) of sin x is denoted sin−1 x (Sometimes the notation ‘arcsin
x’ is used). That is if y = sin x then x = sin−1 y. So sin−1 x is the angle whose sine is
x. Similarly
cos−1 x = angle whose cosine is x
tan−1 x = angle whose tangent is x
sec−1 x = angle whose sec is x
cosec−1 x = angle whose cosec is x
cot−1 x = angle whose cot is x
Note that because, for example,
sin 135° = sin 45° =
1

the quantity sin−1

can take more than one value – we say it is multi-valued. In
general, because of periodicity all the inverse trigonometric functions are multi-valued.
Thus, for a given x, sin−1 x will yield an inﬁnite range of values. In order to restrict to a
unique value of sin−1 x for each value of x we take what is called the principal value of
sin−1 x, which is the value lying in the range
−π
2 ≤sin−1 x ≤π

Similarly we can deﬁne principal values for the other inverse trigonometric func-
tions – Figure 6.12 illustrates the principal value ranges for cos−1 x and tan−1 x.
Since the inverse functions are multi-valued we need expressions for the general solution
of equations such as sin y = x, i.e. we need to obtain expressions for the most general
angle given by sin−1 x and other inverse functions. We will simply state the results here:
sin−1 x = nπ + (−1)nPV
cos−1 x = 2nπ ± PV
tan−1 x = nπ + PV

the key identities should actually be memorised – and indeed should be second nature. In
fact, you only have to remember one or two, from which the rest may then be derived. A
sufﬁcient minimal set to remember is in fact:
cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1
and
sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + sin B cos A
If you have these at your ﬁngertips most of the others are easily recalled or derived from
them. The ﬁrst is the subject of this section, the second is treated in Section 6.2.7.
The Pythagorean identities are
cos2 θ + sin2 θ ≡1
1 + tan2 θ ≡sec2 θ
cot2 θ + 1 ≡cosec2 θ
These can be obtained, as their name suggests, from Pythagoras’ theorem (154

or cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1
This identity should deﬁnitely become second nature to you – it is absolutely vital. By
dividing through by cos2 θ we get 1 + tan2 θ = sec2 θ and dividing through by sin2 θ gives
cot2 θ + 1 = cosec2 θ, so there is no need to remember all three identities.

6.2.7 Compound angle formulae
➤
173 196 ➤
The basic compound angle formulae are:
sin(A + B) ≡sin A cos B + cos A sin B
sin(A −B) ≡sin A cos B −cos A sin B
cos(A + B) ≡cos A cos B −sin A sin B
cos(A −B) ≡cos A cos B + sin A sin B
tan(A + B) ≡tan A + tan B
1 −tan A tan B
tan(A −B) ≡tan A −tan B
1 + tan A tan B
Note that there is no need to remember all these results separately. We can get all of
them from the result for sin(A + B), and the elementary properties of the trig ratios (see
solution to review question). Also, get used to ‘knowing them backwards’ that is going
from right to left, recognising how the right-hand side simpliﬁes to the left-hand side.
Since the sin(A + B) result is so important we will take the trouble to prove it. The proof
is instructive since it contains lots of ideas already covered.
We use one of those mystical constructions which makes geometry so pretty. Consider
Figure 6.13.
P Q is drawn at Q perpendicular to the line making angle A with the base line OT , and
meets the corresponding line deﬁning the compound angle A + B at P . P S and QT are
dropped perpendicular to OT and RQ is then drawn parallel to OT . By alternate angles
(149
➤
) ̸ OQR = A. Since P QR is a right angled triangle ̸ QP R is the complement
(149
➤
) of ̸ RQP and is therefore equal to ̸ OQR = ̸ QOT = A. Also, RS = QT .
Now sin(A + B) = P S
OP = P R + RS
OP
= P R + QT

OP = QT

Figure 6.13 Proof of sin(A + B) = sin Acos B + cos Asin B.
Putting A = B in the compound angle identities immediately gives the double angle
formulae:
sin 2A ≡sin A cos A
cos 2A ≡cos2 −sin2 A
≡2 cos2 A −1
≡1 −2 sin2 A
tan A ≡
2 tan A
1 −tan2 A
The cos 2A results are often more useful in the form
sin2 A = 1
2(1 −cos 2A)
cos2 A = 1
2(1 + cos 2A)
From the double angle formulae we easily deduce the half angle identities. If t = tan θ/2,
then:
tan θ ≡
2t
1 −t2
sin θ ≡
2t
1 + t2
cos θ ≡1 −t2
1 + t2
For example:
tan θ = tan(2 × θ/2) =
2 tan θ/2
1 −tan2 θ/2 =
2t
1 −t2
from the double angle formula.
Solution to review question 6.1.7
A. sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + sin B cos A is so important it should be at
your ﬁngertips.

B.
(i) sin(A −B) = sin(A + (−B))
= sin A cos(−B) + sin(−B) cos A
= sin A cos B −sin B cos A
on using
cos(−x) = cos x and sin(−x) = −sin x
(ii) The result for cos(A −B) may now be obtained using comple-
mentary angles (149
➤
):
cos(A −B) = sin(90 −(A −B))
= sin(90 −A + B)
= sin(90 −A) cos B + cos(90 −A) sin B
= cos A cos B + sin A sin B
Or, perhaps quicker, simply differentiate (➤233) the result for
sin(A −B) with respect to B – a common trick for obtaining ‘cos-
results’ from ‘sin-results’.
(iii) The result for tan(A + B) can be obtained by division:
tan(A + B) = sin(A + B)
cos(A + B) = sin A cos B + sin B cos A
cos A cos B −sin A sin B
= tan A + tan B
1 −tan A tan B
on dividing top and bottom by cos A cos B.
The key point here is that while certain results have to be second
nature to you, such as the expansion of sin(A + B), it is just as
important that you know how to derive others from them, rather
than have to remember all the identities.

6.2.8 Trigonometric equations
➤
173 196 ➤
A trigonometric equation is any equation containing ratios of an ‘unknown’ angle θ, to be
determined from the equation. One attempts to solve such an equation by manipulating it
(possibly using trig identities) until it can be solved by solutions of one or more equations
of the form
sin θ = a
cos θ = b
tan θ = c
As noted in Section 6.2.5, in general the solution to such equations will not be unique,
but will lead to multiple values of θ. The general solution is that which speciﬁes all
possible solutions. Such general solutions can always be expressed as simple extensions
of principal value solutions, which are those for which θ is conﬁned to a speciﬁc range
in which the above basic equations have unique solutions. Thus, from Section 6.2.5 the
principal values for the elementary trigonometric ratios are:
sin θ,
θ ∈
	
−π
2 , π
2

which means −π
2 ≤θ ≤π
2
cos θ,
θ ∈[0, π] or 0 ≤θ ≤π
tan θ,
θ ∈
	
−π
2 , π
2

or −π
2 ≤θ ≤π
2
In each case there is only one principal value solution to each of the equations given
above. If we are asked for a solution in a speciﬁc range of θ then we have to examine
such equations as sin θ = a to determine which solutions fall in this range.
An important type of equation is
f (A) = f (B)
where f is an elementary trig function. The general solutions for such equations are
For cos A = cos B, we have A = 2nπ ± B
For
sin A = sin B, we have A = 2nπ + B or (2k + 1)π −B
For tan A = tan B, we have A = nπ + B
where in each case, n is an arbitrary integer. These results can be conﬁrmed by inspecting
the graphs in Figures 6.8–10. The solution to the review question provides an example.
Solution to review question 6.1.8
(i) sin θ + 2 sin θ cos θ = sin θ(1 + 2 cos θ) = 0
implies either sin θ = 0 or 1 + 2 cos θ = 0
sin θ = 0 has solutions θ = kπ where k is an integer
The equation 1 + 2 cos θ = 0 or cos θ = −1
2 has general solution
θ = 2π
3 + 2mπ or −2π
3 + 2nπ
191

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
where m, n are integers.
So the general solution is
θ = kπ, or 2π
3 + 2mπ, or −2π
3 + 2nπ
k, m, n are integers
NB – it is a common error to forget the sin θ = 0 part of the solution.
(ii) cos 3θ = cos θ is an example of cos A = cos B for which we know
3θ = 2kπ ± θ
where k = an integer
So 4θ = 2kπ
or 2θ = 2kπ
We therefore obtain
θ = 2kπ
4
= kπ
2
or 2kπ
2
= kπ
and so the general solution is kπ
2 or kπ, with k = an integer.
6.2.9 The acos q Y bsin q form
➤
173 197 ➤
The compound angle identities may be used, with a little help from Pythagoras (154
➤
),
to convert an expression of the form a cos θ + b sin θ to one of the more manageable
forms r cos(θ ± α) or r sin(θ ± α). The latter forms, for example, tell us immediately by
inspection the maximum and minimum values of such expressions, and where they occur.
This section uses a lot of what we have done, in particular the ‘minimal set’ of results to
remember – cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1, and the expansions of sin(A + B) and cos(A + B). To
illustrate conversion of this form, we consider the example of
a cos θ + b sin θ ≡r sin(θ + α)
Using the compound angle formula this implies
a cos θ + b sin θ ≡r cos α sin θ + r sin α cos θ
This has got to be true for all possible values of θ, and to ensure this we equate the
coefﬁcients of cos θ, sin θ on each side to get
r cos α = a
r sin α = b
where, by squaring and adding (185
➤
), r =
√
a2 + b2 and
cos α = a
r
sin α = b
r
from which α may be determined. Care is needed here if either a or b is negative – we
have to look carefully at the quadrant that α lies in.
192

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Such a conversion simpliﬁes the solution of equations such as
a cos θ + b sin θ = c
by conversion to the form
cos(θ + α) = c
r =
c
√
a2 + b2
for example.
Solution to review question 6.1.9
(i) We assume that we can write
cos θ + sin θ = r sin(θ + α)
= r sin θ cos α + r cos θ sin α
then
r cos α = 1
r sin α = 1
so
r2 = 12 + 12 = 2
and
r =
√
2
Then
cos α =
1
√
2
sin α =
1
√
2
so tan α = 1, in the ﬁrst quadrant, and hence
α = 45°
and
cos θ + sin θ =
√
2 sin(θ + 45°)
(ii) In this case
cos θ + sin θ = r cos(θ + α)
= r cos θ cos α −r sin θ sin α
so
r cos α = 1
r sin α = −1
As before
r =
√
2, so
cos α =
1
√
2
sin α = −1
√
2
The appropriate solution in this case is
α = −45°
so
cos θ + sin θ =
√
2 cos(θ −45°)

A2 sin(ωt + α2). When we come to complex numbers we will see how this sort of
thing can be done using objects called phasors (371
➤
), but really such methods
are simply shorthand for the ideas covered in this chapter. In particular we can
add two waves that are 90° out of phase using the results of Section 6.2.9, since
A1 sin(ωt + 90°) + A2 sin(ωt) is equivalent to a cos(ωt) + b sin(ωt). For additions
such as A1 sin(ωt + α) + A2 sin(ωt), where α is other than 90°, phasor methods are
equivalent to constructing a parallelogram with sides A1 and A2 and included angle α
and taking the combined amplitude as the length of the diagonal, r, and the combined
phase to be the angle, θ, made by the diagonal with the side A2 (see Figure 6.15).
A1 sin(ωt + α) + A2 sin(ωt) = r sin(ωt + θ)

7.2 Revision
7.2.1 Coordinate systems in a plane
➤
204 220 ➤
In Chapters 5 and 6 we never really had to ﬁx our geometric objects in the plane in any
way. A point such as the centre of a circle is special so far as the circle is concerned,
but where it is located in the plane has no bearing on the properties of the circle. This
characterises what is called synthetic or axiomatic geometry, in which the description of
geometric objects such as lines and circles depends on their relation to each other.
However, by locating points in space by means of a coordinate system, assigning
numbers, or coordinates to each point, we can represent geometrical ideas by mathematical
equations. This is the subject of coordinate geometry – also called analytical geometry.
The simplest and most common coordinate system is the Cartesian coordinate system
or rectangular coordinate system in a plane. An origin is chosen and two perpendicular
lines through the origin are chosen as the x- and y-axes (91
➤
). The scale on each axis
is taken to be the same in this chapter. Any point in the plane can then be speciﬁed by
giving its x coordinate and y coordinate as an ordered pair (x, y). See, for examples, the
solution to the review question.
205

M a t h e m a t i c s
Another two-dimensional coordinate system in common use is the polar coordinate
system, especially convenient when dealing with engineering problems relating to circular
motion for example. In polar coordinates an origin and an ‘initial line’ Ox radiating from
this origin are chosen. The position of any point P is then referred to by specifying the
distance, OP , from O to the point along a ‘radius vector’ whose angle, θ, with the initial
line is also speciﬁed. Then the position of a point is speciﬁed by polar coordinates (r, θ)
(Figure 7.1).

Figure 7.1 Cartesian (x, y) and polar (r, θ) coordinates in a plane.
In Figure 7.1 the polar coordinates are shown superimposed on a rectangular coordinate
system where the positive x axis coincides with the initial line. With this arrangement the
relation between the coordinates is seen to be (175
➤
):
x = r cos θ
y = r sin θ
Notice that in polar coordinates θ is measured anticlockwise and its value is restricted
to 0 ≤θ < 2π or sometimes −π < θ ≤π (175
➤
). Also, the origin is somewhat special
(‘singular’ is the technical term) in polar coordinates – its r coordinate is r = 0, but its θ
coordinate is not deﬁned.
Example
To plot the curve with polar equation
r = 1 + 2 cos θ
take some appropriate values of θ, and calculate 1 + 2 cos θ, as below.

These values are plotted in Figure 7.2. Note that negative values of r are plotted in the
opposite direction to the positive values, so for example (−1, π) is plotted as (1, 0) – in
the opposite direction to π. Now for any angle θ, cos(−θ) = cos θ, therefore the same
values of r will be obtained for negative values of θ, and we have only to reﬂect the curve
in the initial line to obtain the complete plot.

To see this, note that by the intercept theorem (153

Note that this is the same as tan(̸ ABC). This holds for all values of x1, x2, y1, y2 except
of course that x2 −x1 must be non zero, i.e. x1 ̸= x2. The case where x1 = x2 actually
corresponds to a vertical line, parallel to the y-axis. Crudely, you might think of it as
having an inﬁnite gradient.
If a line slopes upwards from right to left, i.e. y increases as x increases, then we have
a positive gradient. If it slopes downwards to the right, or y decreases as x increases then
the gradient is negative.

7.2.4 Equation of a straight line
➤
204 221 ➤
Knowing that the gradient of the straight-line segment AB is
m = AC
BC = y2 −y1
x2 −x1
we can now derive an equation for the straight line through the two points A, B by
equating its gradient to m. For a general point P (x, y) on the line, its gradient is given
by (y −y1)/(x −x1), say, which also gives m:
y −y1
x −x1
= y2 −y1
x2 −x1
= m
Rearranging this (see RE7.3.4C) gives the equation of the straight line as
y −y1 =
y2 −y1
x2 −x1

(x −x1)
or
y −y1 = m(x −x1)
We can also write this in the form y = mx + y1 −mx1 and so the general form of the
equation of a straight line can be written as:
y = mx + c
where m is the gradient of the line, and c is the intercept on the y-axis. This is illustrated
in Figure 7.7.

The gradient is m = AP/BP = tan θ.
Two special cases require comment. For a horizontal line (i.e. parallel to the x-axis) the
equation is y = c (a constant), since the gradient is zero. For a vertical line (i.e. parallel
to the y-axis) the equation is given by x = c.
Sometimes, if we want to tidy up fractional coefﬁcients for example, we write the
equation of a line as
ax + by + c = 0
Solution to review question 7.1.4
A. The equation of the straight line through the points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) is
y −y1 =
y2 −y1
x2 −x1

(x −x1) = m(x −x1)
where m is the gradient. We can choose either of the given points for
(x1, y1).
(i) With (x1, y1) = (0, 0), (x2, y2) = (1, 1) the gradient is m = 1
(210
➤
) so the required equation is
y −0 = 1(x −0)
or
y = x
(ii) This question illustrates the limitations of general formulae. Using
the general result would give
y −2 = ∞(x −1)
which is not deﬁned (6
➤
). In such circumstances we go back to
ﬁrst principles, and look again at the points, (1, 2), (1, 3). Here
the x-coordinate always remains the same, so the line must be
parallel to the y-axis. It is in fact the line x = 1.
(iii) For the points (−2, 4), (1 −3) the gradient is −7
3 and the equation
becomes
y −1 = −7
3(x −3)
or, tidying this up
7x + 3y −24 = 0

Figure 7.8 Parallel lines have the same gradient.
As we might expect, parallel lines have the same gradient (149

a nice application of the intercept theorem(153
➤
). The gradient of l1 is AP
BP and that of
l2 is MP
NP . But, by the intercept theorem, since AB and MN are parallel, MN divides
AP and BP in the same ratio, so AP/BP = MP/NP , i.e. l1, l2 have the same gradient.
Lines that are perpendicular clearly do not have the same gradient, but they are related.
If lines l1, l2 are perpendicular, and have gradients m1, m2 respectively then
m1m2 = −1
We can see this from Figure 7.9.
The lines l1, l2 are perpendicular.
First, note that since α + θ = π

Solution to review question 7.1.5
A. Any line parallel to y = 1 −3x has the same gradient, m = −3 and
so can be written as
y = −3x + c
We now have to choose the intercept c so that the line passes through
(−1, 2), which we do by substituting these values in the equation:
2 = −3(−1) + c
So
c = −1 and the equation required is
y = −3x −1
B. If the line l through (−1, 2), (0, 4) has gradient m then any line
perpendicular to it has gradient −1/m. The gradient of l is
m =
4 −2
0 −(−1) = 2
so any line perpendicular to it has gradient −1
2 and has an equation of
the form
y = −1

If this line passes through (−1, 2) then substituting this point in the
equation gives
2 = −1

7.2.6 Intersecting lines
➤
205 222 ➤
If two lines intersect, then their point of intersection must satisfy both of their equations.
Thus, if the lines are:
ax + by = c
dx + ey = f
then at the point of intersection these equations must be satisﬁed simultaneously (48
➤
).
Although one would ﬁnd this intersection point by solving these equations, the geomet-
rical picture provides a nice visual means of discussing the different possibilities for the
solution of the equations. Thus, we ﬁnd the following cases, with some examples you can
check:
•
if the lines are not parallel (i.e. do not have the same gradient) then they
will intersect at some point – i.e. the equations will have a solution.
Example
x + 2y = 1
x −y = 0
have different gradients and intersect at
 1
3, 1
3
.
•
If the lines are parallel (same gradient) then they will never intersect
and there will be no solution to the equations.
Example
2x + y = 0
4x + 2y = 3
These are parallel, but through different points – the ﬁrst passes through
the origin, the second through
0, 3
2
. These lines will never intersect
and so the equations have no solution.
•
If the lines are identical, i.e. coincide (same gradients, same intercepts),
then they intersect at every point on the line(s) – the equations have an
inﬁnite number of solutions.
Example
x + 3y = 1
2x + 6y = 2
216

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
The second equation is actually the same as the ﬁrst – just cancel 2
throughout the equation. So these equations actually represent the same
line and they therefore intersect at every point – there is an inﬁnite
number of solutions.
Solution to review question 7.1.6
You will save time by noting that the lines (i) x + y = 3 and (ii) 2x + 2y =
−1 are in fact parallel lines – they have the same gradient, −1. So they
never intersect, and we have only to consider the intersection of each of
them with the line (iii) y = 3x −1.
(i) and (iii) intersect where
y = 3 −x = 3x −1
Solving for x and then y gives
x = 1, y = 2
(ii) and (iii) intersect where
y = −1
2 −x = 3x −1
or
x = 1

7.2.7 Equation of a circle
➤
205 222 ➤
Two things characterise a circle uniquely – its centre and its radius. Suppose therefore
we refer a circle to a set of Cartesian axes in which its centre has coordinates (a, b) and
its radius is r. Then we know that any point (x, y) on the circle is always a distance r
from the centre (a, b). So, using Pythagoras’ theorem (154
➤
yet again) we can write
the distance from (x, y) to the centre (a, b) as

(x −a)2 + (y −b)2. Since this is always
equal to the radius r we can then write
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r2
This, with the square root sign removed by squaring, is the equation or locus for a circle
with centre (a, b) and radius r, in Cartesian coordinates. This equation may be expanded
(42
➤
) to give the form
x2 + y2 + 2f x + 2gy + h = 0
Problem
Express f , g, h in terms of a, b, r.
You should ﬁnd
f = −a,
g = −b,
h = a2 + b2 −r2

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Often, it is the latter form of the equation of a circle that is given, and you are asked to
ﬁnd the centre and radius. To do this we complete the square (66
➤
) on x, y and return
to the ﬁrst form, from which centre and radius can be read off directly.
Note that in polar coordinates, the equation of a circle with radius a and centre at the
origin takes the very simple form r = a. This illustrates how useful polar coordinates can
be in some circumstances.
Solution to review question 7.1.7
A. The equation of the circle centre (a, b) with radius r is
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r2
Applying this to the data given produces:
(i) For centre (0, 0) and radius 2 we get
(x −0)2 + (y −0)2 = 22, or x2 + y2 = 4
(ii) For centre (1, 2) radius 1 we get
(x −1)2 + (y −2)2 = 1 or x2 + y2 −2x −4y + 4 = 0
(iii) For centre (−1, 4) and radius 3 we get
(x + 1)2 + (y −4)2 = 9 or x2 + y2 + 2x −8y + 8 = 0
B. To ﬁnd the centre and radius of a circle whose equation is given in the
form x2 + y2 + 2f x + 2gy + h = 0 we re-express it in the form
(x −a)2 + (y −b)2 = r2
by completing the square in x and y (66
➤
).
(i) x2 + y2 −2x + 6y + 6 = x2 −2x + y2 + 6y + 6
= (x −1)2 −1 + (y + 3)2 −9 + 6
on completing the square for x2 −2x and y2 + 6y
= (x −1)2 + (y + 3)2 −4
So the equation is equivalent to
(x −1)2 + (y + 3)2 = 4 = 22
which gives a centre of (1, −3) and radius 2.
(ii) x2 + y2 + 4x + 4y −1 = x2 + 4x + y2 + 4y −1
= (x + 2)2 −4 + (y + 2)2 −4 −1
= (x + 2)2 + (y + 2)2 −9
on completing the square. So the equation becomes
(x + 2)2 + (y + 2)2 = 9 = 32
giving a centre (−2, −2) and a radius 3.

7.2.8 Parametric representation of curves
➤
205 222 ➤
Sometimes, instead of writing an equation in the form y = f (x), i.e. in terms of x, y, it is
convenient to introduce some parameter t in terms of which x and y are jointly expressed
in the form
x = x(t)
y = y(t)
For example the position of a projectile at time t may be expressed as
x = V t cos α = x(t)
y = V t sin α −1
2gt2 = y(t)
where V , α are the initial projection velocity and angle respectively.
In principle, we can always return to the x, y form by eliminating t. In the projectile
for example we have
t =

V cos α

Solution to review question 7.1.8
(i) From the equations x = 3t + 1, y = t + 2 we have t = y −2, so
x = 3t + 1 = 3(y −2) + 1 = 3y −5
The Cartesian equation is thus
x −3y + 5 = 0
which is a straight line.
(ii) x = 6 cos 2t; y = 6 sin 2t
This is a good example of the need to have the elementary trig iden-
tities at your ﬁngertips. Otherwise, it might not immediately occur to
you to use the fact that cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1 (185
➤
) to eliminate t,
by squaring and adding
x2 + y2 = 36 cos2 2t + 36 sin2 2t = 36
which is a circle centre the origin and radius 6. This parametric form
of the circle is very useful in the theory of oscillating systems.
(iii) In general, the parametric equations
x = r cos θ + a,
y = r sin θ + b
219

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

represent a circle with centre (a, b) and radius r, since:

with the x-axis, as shown in Figure 7.10.

So, for x = 2 cos t −1 and y = 2 sin t we get
2 cos t = x + 1
so
(x + 1)2 + y2 = 4 cos2 t + 4 sin2 t = 4
giving a circle centre (−1, 0) and radius 2.
(iv) x = cos 2t, y = cos t
So from the double angle formula (188

)
x = cos 2t = 2 cos2 t −1 = 2y2 −1
which we may as well leave in the implicit form

variables x, y in the form

and look for the maximum or minimum value of some linear function
f (x, y) = mx + ny
as x and y vary subject to these constraints. By considering the equations of straight

tions. Find the values of x and y such that

2. This question considers a very simple model of the ‘slingshot effect’, in which a space
module is transferred from an orbit around the earth to one around the moon, say. The
trick is to eject the module from the earth orbit with just the right speed and direction
for it to travel in a straight line to intercept the moon orbit at just the right point and
speed to be captured and enter into orbit around the moon. Figure 7.11 shows how
this can be modelled by ﬁnding the straight line that is tangent to the earth and moon
orbits represented as circles centre the origin, radius R and centre (0, D), radius r,
respectively. Here D is the earth moon distance, R the earth orbit radius and r the
moon orbit radius. Find the equation of this straight line, the distance from orbit to
orbit, and the points where the orbits are left and entered all in terms of D, R, r. Try
out your results on some realistic data.

Techniques of Differentiation
Differentiation is a relatively straightforward side of calculus. We only have to remember
a dozen or so standard derivatives (the elementary functions), a few rules (sum, product,
quotient, function of a function) and the rest is routine. However, we do need to be highly
proﬁcient with differentiation, able to apply the rules quickly and accurately. One reason
for this is to help you with integration. One of the difﬁculties with integration lies in
recognising what was differentiated to give you what you have to integrate – you will
more easily spot this (and check it) if your differentiation is good.
While it is perhaps not essential for the engineers, I have included differentiation from
ﬁrst principles. It is really not that difﬁcult to follow, and the ideas and skills involved
are useful elsewhere.

8.2.1 Geometrical interpretation of differentiation
➤
228 243 ➤
If A and B are two points on a curve, the straight line AB is called a chord of the curve
(157
➤
). A line which touches the curve at a single point (i.e. A = B) is called a tangent
to the curve at that point (157
➤
). The normal to a curve at a point A is a line through
A, perpendicular to the tangent at A. The gradient or slope of a curve at a point is the
gradient or slope of the tangent to the curve at that point.
A
B
Tangent
Chord

Figure 8.1
Solution to review question 8.1.1
The derivative, dy
dx , is the slope or gradient of the curve y = f (x) at the
point x, which is deﬁned as tan θ where θ is the angle made by the tangent
to the curve at x with the positive x-axis.
8.2.2 Differentiation from ﬁrst principles
➤
228 243 ➤
As B gets closer to A, the gradient of the chord AB becomes closer to that of the tangent
to the curve at A – that is, closer to the gradient of the curve at A. We say that in the
limit, as B tends to A, the gradient of the chord tends to the gradient of the curve at A.
We write this as
lim
B→A(gradient chord AB) = gradient of curve at A
where limB→A means take the limiting value as B tends to A. We met the idea of a
limit on page 126, in the context of letting a number become inﬁnitely large. Here we
are considering the situation where something – the distance between A and B – becomes
‘inﬁnitesimally small’, i.e. tends to zero.
Let the equation of the curve be y = f (x). The situation is illustrated in Figure 8.2.
Suppose δx (‘delta x’) denotes a small change in x (not ‘δ times x’), so that x becomes
x + δx. Then correspondingly f (x) will change to f (x + δx), producing a small change
in y to y + δy. The change in y, δy, is then given by
δy = y + δy −y = f (x + δx) −f (x)

Figure 8.2
The gradient (210
➤
) of the extended chord AB is then given by
Gradient AB = f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx
As A gets closer to B this gradient will get closer to the gradient of the tangent at A, i.e.
closer to the gradient of the curve at A, so:
Gradient of curve at A = lim
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx

where limδx→0 means let δx tend to zero in the expression in square brackets.
Note that in all this discussion we are assuming that the curve y = f (x) is continuous
and smooth (i.e. has no breaks or sharp corners).
Taking limits is a sophisticated operation about which we will say more in Chapter 14
(see Section 14.5). For now we will only use very simple ideas.
We can repeat the above discussion at each point, i.e. each value of x, so the gradient
is a function of x called the derivative of f (x) (sometimes differential coefﬁcient).
The standard forms of notation for the derivative of a function y = f (x) with respect
to x are:
dy
dx = df (x)
dx
= f ′(x) = lim
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx

The process of obtaining dy/dx is called differentiation with respect to x. f ′(a) means
df/dx evaluated at x = a.
Evaluation of the derivative by calculating the limit is called differentiation from
ﬁrst principles. Using this one can construct a table of standard derivatives of the
elementary functions and a number of rules of differentiation with which we may deduce
many further derivatives.
The standard approach to such differentiation from ﬁrst principles is as follows.
For a function y = f (x), let x increase by an ‘inﬁnitesimal’ amount δx. Evaluate the
231

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
corresponding increase in y:
δy = f (x + δx) −f (x)
and neglect any powers of δx greater than one to get something like
δy ≃f ′(x)δx
where f ′(x) denotes just a function of x alone. Then
δy
δx ≃f ′(x)
and letting δx →0 yields the derivative
dy
dx = f ′(x)
as suggested by the notation. The solution to the review question illustrates this.
Solution to review question 8.1.2
If
y = f (x) = x2, then
y + δy = f (x + δx) = (x + δx)2
= x2 + 2xδx + (δx)2
Hence
δy = f (x + δx) −f (x) = 2xδx + (δx)2
and
δy
δx = f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx
= 2x + δx
So, in the limit, as δx →0
dy
dx = df
dx = lim
δx→0
f (x + δx) −f (x)
δx
= lim
δx→0 2x + δx
= 2x
8.2.3 Standard derivatives
➤
229 243 ➤
By applying arguments such as that in the previous section we can build up a list of
standard derivatives. These are basically derivatives of the ‘elementary’ functions such
as powers of x, trigonometric functions, exponentials and logs. What you remember from
these depends on the requirements of your course or programme, but I would certainly
recommend that the minimal list given in Table 8.1 be not only remembered, but be second
nature. Note, in anticipation of Chapter 9, that when you learn the standard derivatives
you can also learn the standard integrals by reading the table from right to left (see
Section 9.2.2).

(i) y = 49 is a constant, so its derivative is 0. Think of it as a quantity
whose rate of change or gradient is zero – its graph is always ‘ﬂat’.
(ii) y = x4, so using d(xn)

dx = cos x directly from Table 8.1. Note that x must
be in radians here.
(vi) y = ex so dy
dx = ex again from the table. ex is unique in being
its own derivative and this is partly responsible for its immense
importance.
(vii) For y = ln x, dy
dx = 1

(viii) y = 2x
This question is a bit naughty, since it does not come from our list
of standard integrals, but beginners sometimes make the error of
thinking it does and write
‘ d
dx (2x) = x2x−1’
233

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

This is, of course, an incorrect application of the rule for the deriva-
tive of xn. We will come back to 2x later (Section 8.2.5) – it needs
some more rules of differentiation, which takes us to the next section.
8.2.4 Rules of differentiation
➤
229 244 ➤
In order to differentiate more complicated functions than those in the standard derivatives
table we need to be able to differentiate sums, differences, products and quotients. Also we
sometimes need to differentiate a composite function or ‘function of a function’ (97
➤
).
These rules of differentiation can be proved by using the limit deﬁnition of differentiation
(see Chapter 14). Here we will concentrate on making them at least plausible, and on
getting used to using them.
The derivative of a sum (difference) is the sum (difference) of the derivatives.
d
dx (f (x) ± g(x)) = df (x)
dx
± dg(x)
dx
We say differentiation is a linear operation. An extension of this is:
d
dx (kf (x)) = k df (x)
dx
for k = constant
which simply says that to differentiate a constant multiple of a function you only have to
take out the constant from the derivative.
It would be nice if the derivative of a product was a product – unfortunately it is not.
To obtain the correct result, suppose we want to differentiate y = uv where u = u(x),
v = v(x) are functions of x.
Following our recipe of Section 8.2.2 let x increase to x + δx, say. Then u will increase
to u + δu and v to v + δv, say. So y increases by:
δy = (u + δu)(v + δv) −uv
= uδv + vδu + δuδv
Now we neglect δuδv because it is of second degree (i.e. like (δx)2 not δx) so we have
δy ≃uδv + vδu
So, dividing through by δx
δy
δx = uδv
δx + v δu
δx
If we now let δx →0 we get the product rule:
dy
dx = d(uv)
dx
= udv
dx + v du
dx
A nice physical way to look at this is to think of how much the area of a rectangular plate
increases when you heat it. Suppose the plate has sides u and v. Due to linear expansion
234

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
u and v will increase to u + δu and v + δu respectively, with δu and δv very small. The
area therefore increases to
(u + δu)(v + δv) = uv + vδu + uδv + δuδv
So the increase in area will be
vδu + uδv + δuδv
Since δu, δv are very small, δuδv is very very small, so we can neglect it and the increase
in area is approximately
vδu + uδv
which is the form of the product rule.
The corresponding quotient rule is
d
dx
u
v

=

v du
dx −udv
dx
 
v2
We will see why below.
We can handle many functions by using the standard derivatives and the sum, product,
quotient rules. We could not handle something like cos(ex) however. This is an example
of a function (cosine) of a function (exponential) or a composition of functions (97
➤
).
In general we write:
y = f (u)
where u = g(x)
e.g.
y = cos u
where u = ex
To differentiate such a function with respect to x we use the function of a function or
the chain rule:
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx
So
dy
dx = −sin u × ex = −ex sin(ex)
Think of this ‘rule’ of change of u w.r.t. x = rate of change of y w.r.t. u times rate of
change of u w.r.t. x. Note that the chain rule suggests a useful result if we take the special
case y = x:
dy
du
du
dx = dx
du
du
dx = dx
dx = 1
so
du
dx = 1
dx

or
dy
dx = 1
dx
dy
This result is useful in implicit differentiation for example (see Section 8.2.5). While it
should not encourage you to think of dy
dx as a fraction there are occasions when it is
235

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
convenient to do this – with care. For example in differential equations we sometimes use
such steps as:
dy
dx dx ≡dy
which is really a bit of poetic license that is found to work most of the time.
We can combine the product and chain rules to obtain the rule for differentiating a
quotient as follows:
d

When ﬁrst learning these rules you might use the given formulae, substituting u = x,
v = sin x, or whatever. However, the rules will be more useful to you if you practice and
develop your skills to the point where you do not need to do this. That is, rather than
actually use the formula, try to do the required procedure automatically. To help with this
think of the rules in terms of words, describing what you actually do:
Sum rule:
‘diff(+) = diff + diff’
Product:
‘diff(×) = one × diff + diff × other’
Quotient
diff(/) = diff top × bottom - top × diff bottom
(bottom)2
Function of a function ‘diff[f (g)] = (diff f w.r.t. g) × (diff g w.r.t. x)’
Solution to review question 8.1.4
(i) y = 3x4 −2x2 + 3x −1
This is a linear combination of terms of the form Axn. We differen-
tiate each term in the polynomial and combine the results.
So
dy
dx = 3 × 4x3 −2 × 2x + 3
= 12x3 −4x + 3
(ii) y = x2 cos x is a product of the two elementary functions x2
and cos x.
236

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
So by product rule, with say u = x2, v = cos x,
dy
dx = d(uv)
dx
= d
dx (x2 cos x)
= v du
dx + u dv
dx = d(x2)
dx
cos x + x2 d
dx (cos x)
= 2x cos x + x2(−sin x)
= 2x cos x −x2 sin x
(iii) y = x −1
x + 1
We can treat this as a quotient y = u
v and use the quotient rule, or
treat as a product:
y = (x −1) ×


x + 1

so
dy
dx = 1 ×



(x + 1)2

2
(x + 1)2
(iv) y = cos(x2 + 1)
This is a function (cos) of a function (x2 + 1) (97
➤
), so we can
use the function of a function rule:
dy
dx = dy
du
du
dx
 u = x2 + 1
y = cos u

giving
dy
dx = −sin(x2 + 1) × (2x)
= −2x sin(x2 + 1)
(v) y = ln 3x
Again, the function of a function rule can be used:
dy
dx = 1
3x × 3 = 1
x
Or this can be simpliﬁed using rules of logarithms (131
➤
)
y = ln 3x = ln 3 + ln x
Therefore
dy
dx = 0 + 1
x as before

approach to the function of a function rule.

dx
= e−2x(−2) = −2e−2x
(vii) y =

If y is deﬁned implicitly in terms of x by an equation of the form (91

f (x, y) = 0
then dy
dx may often be found by differentiating throughout using the function of a function
rule. This is best illustrated by the example given below:
Example
If
x2 + y2 = 1
then differentiating through with respect to x gives
2x + d
dx (y2) = d
dx (1)
so, using the function of a function rule on the left-hand side
2x + 2y dy
dx = 0

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
so
2x + 2y + 2x dy
dx + 4y dy
dx = 0
Hence (x + y) + (x + 2y)dy
dx = 0
and so
dy
dx = −x + y
x + 2y
B. This is a standard application of implicit differentiation. If y = sin−1 x
then x = sin y. But note that as usual with inverse trigonometric func-
tions we must restrict the range of y to, say, −π
2 ≤y ≤π
2 to obtain
a single valued function (184
➤
).
Hence, on this range
dx
dy = cos y
=
	
1 −sin2 y
where we have taken the positive root since the cosine is positive on
−π
2 ≤y ≤π
2
=

1 −x2
So, using dy
dx = 1
dx
dy (see above) we get
dy
dx =
1
√
1 −x2
C. y = ax is another case where we can use implicit differentiation to
advantage. If we take logs to base e we have:
ln y = ln ax = x ln a
Now differentiate through with respect to x:
d
dx (ln y) = d
dx (x ln a)
or
1
y
dy
dx = ln a
by using the chain rule on the left-hand side.
So
dy
dx = y ln a = ax ln a
239

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
You should now be able to repeat this argument with the special case
of a = 2 to obtain
d
dx (2x) = 2x ln 2
D. If y = f (x) = x −1
x + 2, then we could use the quotient or product rule:
f ′(x) =
1
x + 2
d
dx (x −1) + (x −1) d
dx

1
x + 2

=
1
x + 2 −
x −1
(x + 2)2
So
f ′(1) =
1
1 + 2 −0
32 = 1
3
However it is much easier by implicit differentiation. Rewrite as:
(x + 2)y = x −1
So, differentiating through with respect to x:
(1)y + (x + 2)y′ = 1
Substituting x = 1 and y = 0 gives
(1)(0) + 3y′(1) = 1
hence
y′(1) = 1
3 as before.
8.2.6 Parametric differentiation
➤
229 245 ➤
If x, y are deﬁned in terms of a parameter, t, (91
➤
)
x = x(t)
y = y(t)
then the function of a function rule gives
dy
dx = dy
dt
dt
dx
Since dt
dx = 1
dx
dt this can now be written as
dy
dx = dy/dt
dx/dt
240

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Solution to review question 8.1.6
With x = 3t2, y = cos(t + 1) we have
dy
dt = −sin(t + 1) and dx
dt = 6t, so:
dy
dx = dy/dt
dx/dt = −sin(t + 1)
6t
8.2.7 Higher order derivatives
➤
229 245 ➤
In general, dy
dx will be a function of x. We can therefore differentiate it again with respect
to x. We write this as
d
dx
dy
dx

= d2y
dx2
Note that
d2y
dx2 does not mean
dy
dx
2
We can, of course, differentiate yet again and write
d
dx
d2y
dx2

= d3y
dx3
and so on.
In general dny
dxn denotes the nth order derivative – differentiate y n times successively.
Solution to review question 8.1.7
A.
(i) A ﬁrst differentiation gives
d
dx (2x + 1) = 2
So, differentiating again
d2
dx2 (2x + 1) = d
dx (2) = 0
(ii) A bit quicker this time:
d2
dx2 (x3 −2x + 1) = d
dx (3x2 −2) = 6x
241

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g

(iii)

dx (e−x(cos x + sin x))
= −[−e−x(cos x + sin x) + e−x(−sin x + cos x)]
= −e−x(−2 sin x)
= 2e−x sin x
(iv) This one requires a bit of thought if you want to avoid a mess. It
is easiest to use partial fractions in fact. Thus, to remind you of
partial fractions (62
➤
), you can check that
x + 1
(x −1)(x + 2) ≡
2
3(x −1) +
1
3(x + 2)
Then

B. This sort of example brings together a lot of what we have already
done. First, note that
d2y
dx2 ̸= d2y/dt2
d2x/dt2
We must be more subtle. Start with
d2y
dx2 = d
dx
dy
dx

Now with parametric differentiation dy
dx will be a function of t – in
this case, with x = t2 + 1, y = t −1 we have
dy
dx = dy/dt
dx/dt = 1
2t
If we were to differentiate now with respect to x we would have to
express 1
2t in terms of x – possible but messy. Instead, we use the
242

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g

function of a function rule to change the differentiation to one with

8.4 Applications
1. Calculus was invented (by Newton and Liebnitz) partly to handle the mechanics of
moving particles, culminating in Newton’s laws of motion, which to this day forms one
of the major foundations of engineering science. This question is an open invitation to
link the topics of this chapter with what you know about dynamics. Things you might
think about are:
(i) the deﬁnitions of time, position, displacement, speed and velocity, acceleration
and their mathematical expressions in terms of derivatives of each other, with
respect to each other
(ii) Newton’s second law is F = ma where F is force, m mass and a accelera-
tion. Suppose F is given as a function of position and velocity. Then it would
be convenient to have a derivative expression for acceleration that involves just
these two variables. Use the function of a function rule to show that, with usual
notation:
d2s
dt2 = v dv
ds
245

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(iii) Discuss the forms of motion described by the relations between position, s, and
time, t, given below.
(a) s = at + b
(b) s = at2 + bt + c
(c) s = a sin ωt
(d) s = ae−bt
In each case a, b, c, ω are all constants which may be positive or negative.
2. Newton’s second law gives us lots of examples of differential equations. You will
study these in some detail in Chapter 15. For now, we just want to get used to what
is meant by a solution to such an equation. A differential equation is any equation
containing one or more derivatives. Examples are given below, (i)–(vi). A solution to
such an equation is any function which when substituted into the equation, with its
appropriate derivatives, makes the equation identically satisﬁed – i.e. it produces an
identity in the independent variable. In (a)–(g) are listed a number of functions. By
differentiating and substitution in the equations, determine which functions are solutions
of which equations. Using these examples as inspiration, try to ﬁnd other solutions of
the equations, which you can then test.
Note that the full exercise of ﬁnding solutions to differential equations is at the very least
a matter of integration (Chapter 9), and at its most advanced level may involve powerful
mathematical tools such as transform theory (Chapter 17) or numerical methods.

Each one of the equations (i)–(vi) is an example of a general type of differential
equation that plays a crucial role in one or more areas of engineering science.
3. There are many occasions in engineering when we need to know something about the
tangent and normal to a curve at a given point (230
➤
). For example the reaction of
a force at a smooth surface is normal, i.e. perpendicular, to the surface. In Chapter 5
we looked at tangents to circles – the normal at any point is of course along the radius
(158
➤
). Using differentiation regarded as the slope of a curve, we can ﬁnd the tangent
at any point on a curve. Also, using the result that the gradients of perpendicular lines
multiply to give −1 (214
➤
), we can then ﬁnd the normal to a given surface, as the line
perpendicular to the tangent. Investigate the tangents and normals to a general curve at
a given point, using as examples the following:
(i)
y = x2 + 3x −4 at (0, −4)
(ii)
y = cos 3x at x = π
4
(iii)
y = e3x at x = 1
(iv)
y = 2 ln x at x = 1

(ii) An RC circuit with a constant capacitor and constant voltage source includes a
resistor whose resistance varies slowly according to a linear law R = R0(1 + αt).
The voltage across the capacitor in such circumstances can be modelled by the
relation
V −V0 = (E −V0)[1 −(1 + αt)−1/αCR0]
where V0 is the voltage across the capacitor at t = 0. Determine the expression
for the current through the capacitor at time t.
5. The potential in the junction region of a semiconductor pn junction is given by

1 + exp(−kx)
where A and k are material-dependent constants. The force on an electron with charge
e in such a potential region is given by

9.2.1 Deﬁnition of integration
➤
251 280 ➤
Integration (or more strictly indeﬁnite integration) is the reverse of differentiation.
Thus, if
dy
dx = f (x)
then
y =

f (x) dx
is the anti-derivative or indeﬁnite integral of f (x) (also sometimes called the ‘primi-
tive’). f (x) is called the integrand.

For example, because we know that the derivative of x2 is 2x, so we know that the
integral of 2x is x2. Actually, because the derivative of a constant is zero the most general
integral of 2x is x2 + C where C is an arbitrary constant of integration. We write

2x dx = x2 + C
Solution to review question 9.1.1
A. Hopefully, this won’t give you much trouble now:
(i)
d
dx (x3) = 3x2
(ii)
d
dx (sin(2x)) = 2 cos(2x)
by the function of a function rule.
(iii)
d
dx (2e3x) = 2e3x × 3 = 6e3x
B. Of course, these questions are not unrelated to A!
(i) Having just done it in A(i) we know that we can obtain 3x2 by
differentiating x3:
d
dx (x3) = 3x2
And in fact we get the same result if we add an arbitrary constant
C to x3:
d
dx (x3 + C) = 3x2
It follows that the most general integral of 3x2 is:

3x2 dx = x3 + C
(ii) A little more thought is needed to integrate cos 2x. Differentiating
sin 2x gives us 2 cos 2x not cos 2x. To get the latter we should
differentiate 1
2 sin 2x
d
dx
 1
2 sin 2x
 = 1
22 cos 2x = cos 2x
Remembering the arbitrary constant we thus have:

cos 2x dx = 1
2 sin 2x + C
(iii) Again, we have to ﬁddle with the multiplier of the e3x. Since
d
dx (e3x) = 3e3x
254

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
from A(iii), we see that
d
dx
2
3e3x

= 2e3x
So, again remembering the arbitrary constant:

2e3x dx = 2
3e3x + C
9.2.2 Standard integrals
➤
251 281 ➤
We can compile a useful list of integrals just by reading a table of derivatives backwards.
The simplest example is the derivative of xα. For any power α (that is, α can be any
positive or negative real number – check that the result does make sense when α = 0)
we have
d
dx (xα) = αxα−1
from which, for any power α, except a = −1 (see below)
d
dx (xα+1) = (α + 1)xα
and so

xα dx = xα+1
α + 1
We must here exclude the case α = −1 because otherwise we will have zero in the
denominator. In fact, the result for α = −1 is:

x−1 dx =
 dx
x = ln |x| + C
which we know from d
dx (ln |x|) = 1
x .
Similarly, from the derivatives of other functions we can build up the table of standard
integrals given below (from which the arbitrary constant has been omitted). Note that much
of it is the table of standard derivatives given in Chapter 8 read ‘backwards’ (233
➤
). The
term ‘standard integral’ is of course relative – an advanced calculus book might have many
more such integrals that you are expected to know. Here however we conﬁne ourselves
to the most important elementary functions. Obviously, the more you do know, the easier
integration will be, and in particular you will ﬁnd it invaluable to commit all those in the
table to memory.
Much of integration involves manipulating the integrand, or the whole integral, to make
it expressible in terms of the standard integrals. Points to note about integration are:
•
the better your differentiation, the better your integration
•
know your basic algebra and trig skills
•
practice and perseverance pay dividends
•
trial and error may be needed

Similarly, the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals:

(not forgetting the arbitrary constant of course).

and in general for any numerical multiplier k:


f (x) dx
In general, if k and l are constants then we have




For this reason integration is called a linear operation. This rule enables us to integrate
any linear combination of standard integrals, including all polynomials, for example.
Solution to review question 9.1.3

9.2.4 Simplifying the integrand
➤
251 281 ➤
When faced with a new integral, the ﬁrst thing to do, after checking whether it is a standard
integral, is to see if it is in the most convenient form for integration. Thus, in the integral

f (x) dx, we have two things to play with:
•
the integrand f (x)
•
the variable x
258

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
We consider changes of variable, x, later under various substitution methods, but here we
will have a ﬁrst look at what we might be able to do with the integrand in some simple
cases. In general f (x) may be a polynomial or rational function, trig or hyperbolic, log
or exponential, or any combination of these. We would ﬁrst look at f (x) to see if it can
be simpliﬁed or rearranged to our advantage. This involves all that we have learnt so far,
including such things as
•
algebraic simpliﬁcation
•
partial fractions
•
trig identities
•
exponential and log properties
In this section we concentrate on the simplest kinds of rearrangements. For example,

eln x dx looks awful – but it is simply

x dx, a much easier proposition. The review
question gives further examples.
Solution to review question 9.1.4
All the integrals look formidable (deliberately!) – but in fact, using the
properties of exponentials and logs and trig identities the integrands can
all be simpliﬁed to easily integrated functions.

9.2.5 Linear substitution in integration
➤
251 282 ➤
It may be that f (x) in

f (x) dx is inconvenient for integration because of the variable
x, and it may be useful to change to a new variable. This entails changing dx as well as
f (x) of course. For example, consider the integral

(2x −4)3 dx
You may be tempted to expand the bracket out by the binomial theorem, and obtain a
polynomial which is easily integrated. This is correct, but is an unnecessary complication.
The way to go is to notice the similarity to x3 and substitute
u = 2x −4
We must of course also replace dx. To this end we note that
du
dx = 2
and so du = 2 dx and dx = du
2 . This somewhat cavalier way of dealing with the dx and
du is permissible provided we are careful. The upshot is that

(2x −4)3 dx =

u3 du
2
= 1
2

u3 du = u4
8 + C
= (2x −4)4
8
+ C
on returning to the original variable.
In general, whenever we make a substitution of the form
u = ax + b
where a, b are constants, we call this a linear substitution. It is particularly simple because
du
dx = a
and therefore du and dx are simply proportional
du = du
dx dx = a dx
so
dx = du
a
With practice, you may be able to dispense with the formal ‘u = x + 1’ substitution and
do the above example as follows:
260

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s

(2x −4)3 dx = 1

(2x −4)3 d(2x −4)
= 1
2
1
4(2x −4)4 + C
= 1
8(2x −4)4 + C
(d(2x −4) = 2 dx)
There is a useful ‘intuitive’ way of looking at linear substitution. When integrating a
function of ax + b, f (ax + b), we think ‘Well, ax + b is really little different to x. So
treat it like x – if the integral of f (x) is F(x), take the integral of f (ax + b) to be
F(ax + b). But if we differentiated this with respect to x we would get a multiplier “a”
coming in from the function of a function rule. So we need to divide the integral by a to
cancel this multiplier. The integral of f (ax + b) is thus 1
a F(ax + b).’ For the example
above this goes through as follows: (2x −4)3 is like x3, so take its integral to be (2x −4)4
4
.
But if we differentiate this we get a 2 coming from differentiating the bracketed term by
function of a function. So remove this by multiplying by 1
2 so that the ﬁnal form of the
integral is 1
2 × (2x −4)4
4
= (2x −4)4
8
, as we found above.
Another important point is that the linear substitution is very special – it is the only
case in which du and dx are proportional. Suppose we substitute
u = g(x)
so
du
dx = g′(x)
and therefore
du = g′(x) dx
In the linear substitution case this gives
du = a dx
and we could simply divide by a to replace dx by
du
a
But in any other substitution we can’t do this, we would get
dx =
du
g′(x)
and we have the complication of substituting for x in terms of u in g′(x). So, greater care
is needed with other types of substitutions. In general, simple substitutions require special
forms of the integrand – see Section 9.2.6.

Solution to review question 9.1.5
These questions all involve linear substitutions. In no case is it necessary
to do anything to the function before substitution.
(i) If you did something like
‘

dx
x −1 =
 1
x −1

dx = . . .’
stop now and go back to review your basic algebra. It is of course
wrong. You cannot ‘simplify’
1
x −1 any further and must work with
it as it is, and for this we use a substitution.
The closeness of
1
x −1 to 1
x suggests making the substitution
u = x −1 so du = dx and

dx
x −1 =
 du
u = ln u = ln(x −1) + C
or, quicker

dx
x −1 =
 d(x −1)
x −1
= ln(x −1) + C
(ii) Here you may have been tempted to use the compound angle formula
to expand the cos and get simple sine and cosine integrals. Again,
while correct, this is unnecessarily messy – simply substitute
u = 3x + 2,
dx = du
3
so

cos(3x + 2) dx =

9.2.6 The du = f′.x/ dx substitution
➤
252 282 ➤
Integration by substitution is often difﬁcult. The substitution to use is not always obvious.
One case when it is fairly easy to spot the substitution occurs when the integrand contains
a function f.x/ and its derivative f′.x/. One then tries substituting for the function,
u = f (x). This is the reverse of the function of a function rule of differentiation. This
approach relies on ‘noticing’ the derivative – i.e. on good facility with differentiation. An
important general example of this approach is the integral
 f ′(x) dx
f (x)
= ln |f (x)| + C
because if we put u = f (x) we get du = f ′(x) dx, which occurs on the top and the
integral becomes
 du
u = ln |u| + C = ln |f (x)| + C
Similarly, for example

cos(f (x))f ′(x) dx = sin(f (x)) + C
by putting u = f (x).
In general, to integrate

g(f (x))f ′(x) dx put u = f (x) and convert it to

g(u) du,
sometimes written

g(f (x)) df (x), and hope that you can integrate this. We illustrate
the process by a further example:
Given

xex2 dx
Note that the derivative of x2 is 2x, and we have 1
2(2x) = x in the integrand. We know
the derivative of ex is ex, so maybe the integral looks something like ex2? So differentiate
ex2 and see what we get
d
dx (ex2) = ex2 × (2x) = 2xex2
Not quite – the factor 2 is the problem. But that is easily dealt with:
d
dx
1
2ex2
= xex2
gives us what we want. So

xex2 dx = 1
2ex2 + C
You may need to try this a couple of times – and in the end it may not work, anyway. So,
BE FLEXIBLE AND KNOW YOUR DIFFERENTIATION.

x2 + 2x + 3 dx the derivative of x2 + 2x + 3 is

du
dx = 2(x + 1)
You may now be tempted to write
dx =
du
2(x + 1)
substitute in the integral and cancel the x + 1. While correct, this is
a bad habit – never mix variables in an integral. Instead, simply use

Using the double angle formula for cos 2x (188

in fact only differs from the answer obtained above by a constant,
which is unimportant because both forms of the answer contain an
arbitrary constant.
9.2.7 Integrating rational functions
➤
252 283 ➤
Any rational function has the form:
polynomial
polynomial
We can assume that the numerator has lower degree than the denominator, otherwise
we could divide out to get a polynomial plus such a fraction. In many useful cases the
polynomial in the denominator can be factorised into linear and/or quadratic factors with
real coefﬁcients. We could then use partial fractions and substitution to split the rational
function up into integrals of the general form

ax + b
cx2 + dx + e dx
This form of integral is therefore very important, and we will study it in detail. How we
approach it depends on whether or not the denominator factorises (45
➤
). If it does, we
can use partial fractions (62
➤
). If it doesn’t then completing the square (66
➤
) enables
us to use a linear substitution and a standard integral.

appropriate paragraph. For a similar example using completing the square see the solution
to the review question
Given a rational function of the type
ax + b
cx2 + dx + e
we may need to combine a number of methods – such as completing the square and
substitution for example. This may require some manipulation of the integrand. Also we
may not be told which method to use to integrate it, so we have to be able to spot the
best approach. There are three methods we can employ, separately, or in combination:
•
Substitution
•
Completing the square
•
Partial fractions
We can use substitution immediately if the top is proportional to the derivative of the
bottom, using the result
 f ′(x) dx
f (x)
= ln f (x) + C
If it is not, then check whether the denominator factorises – if it does, then we can use
partial fractions. If the bottom doesn’t factorise, we can always rewrite the numerator to
make it equal to the derivative and an additional constant, that is:
ax + b ≡a(2cx + d)

If the bottom doesn’t factorise then we will have to use completing the square.

Solution to review question 9.1.7
If, in these questions, you have done something like:
‘

dx
x2 + 2x + 2 =
1
2x + 2 ln(x2 + 2x + 2)’
which is incorrect, then you have probably misunderstood the idea of
substitution. ‘Dividing by the derivative of the denominator’ in this
way will only work for a linear denominator, when the derivative is
constant (261
➤
). You have only to differentiate the right-hand side
to see that it cannot possibly be the integral of the left-hand side. The
following solutions show the correct approach to such integrals.
A. In this case the denominator factorises and we don’t need to complete
the square – we can split into partial fractions:

dx
x2 + x −2 =

dx
(x −1)(x + 2)

using


We can tidy the answer up and write:

dx
x2 + x −2 = 1
3 ln
x −1


+ C
B. In this case the denominator does not factorise, and the only option is
to complete the square (66
➤
). We have:

dx
x2 + 2x + 2 =

dx
(x + 1)2 + 1
Now this looks like the inverse tan integral (256
➤
), which we can
get by substituting u = x + 1, du = dx:

dx
(x + 1)2 + 1 =

du
u2 + 1 = tan−1 u
so

dx
x2 + 2x + 2 = tan−1(x + 1)

C. This question illustrates that sometimes you may need to combine
methods. Here, the numerator is of the same degree as the denominator,
so we must ﬁrst divide out:
2x2 + 5x + 4
x2 + 2x + 2 = 2(x2 + 2x + 2) −4x −4 + 5x + 4
x2 + 2x + 2
= 2 +

x2 + 2x + 2
So

x2 + 2x + 2 dx =
 
2 +
x
x2 + 2x + 2

dx
= 2x + C +

x dx
x2 + 2x + 2
In the remaining integral the denominator doesn’t factorise and the top
is not the derivative of the bottom. We can remedy this by adding and
subtracting 1 in the numerator, to manufacture the derivative of the
bottom on the top!

x dx
x2 + 2x + 2 =

2 ln |x2 + 2x + 2| −tan−1(x + 1) + C
So, ﬁnally, the integral is
2x + 1
2 ln |x2 + 2x + 2| −tan−1(x + 1) + C
Note that we don’t need to duplicate the arbitrary constant C.
D. In these problems you have to decide which method to use for yourself.
Also, (iv) illustrates that the ‘obvious’ method is not always the best,
so you should always be on the look-out for easier alternatives.

9.2.8 Using trig identities in integration
➤
252 283 ➤
Using a simple linear substitution, u = 3x, we can integrate things such as:

cos 3x dx = 1
3 sin 3x + C
Using this and various trig identities we can perform some quite complicated integrations.
The most common examples here include the use of the compound angle and double angle
formulae
sin(A ± B) = sin A cos B ± sin B cos A
cos(A ± B) = cos A cos B ∓sin A sin B
269

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
which enable us to integrate functions of the type
sin mx cos nx
sin mx sin mx
(m ̸= n)
cos mx cos nx
Such integrals are fundamental to calculations in the theory of Fourier series (Chapter 17).
The double angle formulae can help us deal with integrals containing powers of sin x or
cos x. Odd powers of sin x and cos x can sometimes be dealt with using the Pythagorean
identity cos2 x + sin2 x = 1 and substitution. In general, for the integral:

sinm x cosn x dx
if one of m or n is odd, try using the Pythagorean identity whilst if both are even, use
double angle formula and other trig identities. The review questions illustrate this.
For integrals such as

cos mx cos nx dx,

sin mx sin nx dx,

sin mx cos nx dx
where m ̸= n, use the compound angle formulae. Again, see the review questions. Hyper-
bolic functions can be dealt with similarly.
Solution to review question 9.1.8
The use of trig identities for the examples given relies on the fact
that we can always integrate cos or sine of multiple angles:

cos kx dx = 1
k sin kx + C

sin kx dx = −1
k cos kx + C
When faced with integrals such as those in this question, make a list
of the identities you know involving products of sines and cosines:
cos 2x = 2 cos2 x −1 = 1 −2 sin2 x
= cos2 x −sin2 x
sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x
sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + sin B cos A, etc.
using these, the integrals are not so bad:
(i)

(ii) We can write

 cos x dx
Now put u = sin x, or equivalently:

+ C
(iii) We can express sin A cos B as a sum of sines by using
sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + sin B cos A
sin(A −B) = sin A cos B −sin B cos A
Adding:
sin A cos B = 1
2(sin(A + B) + sin(A −B))
So
sin 2x cos 3x = 1
2(sin(2x + 3x) + sin(2x −3x))
= 1
2(sin 5x + sin(−x))
= 1
2(sin 5x −sin x)
So we can write:

this.
9.2.9 Using trig substitutions in integration
➤
252 283 ➤
Trig or hyperbolic substitutions may help you to deal with some rational and irrational
functions. Thus if you have

a2 −x2
try x = a sin θ
or x = tanh θ

x2 −a2
try x = a cosh θ
or x = sec θ

a2 + x2
try x = a sinh θ
or x = tan θ
The form of the substitution may depend on the range of values of x.
Another useful trig substitution is
t = tan θ/2
With this we have
cos θ = 1 −t2
1 + t2 ,
sin θ =
2t
1 + t2
We also have to change between dθ and dt of course. We have
dθ
dt = 1

2 = 1
2

1 + tan2 θ
2

= 1
2(1 + t2)
from which
dθ =

1 + t2
This substitution can sometimes be used to convert an integral of the form

f (cos θ, sin θ) dθ
to an integral of a rational function in t, which may be easier to deal with.

9.2.10 Integration by parts
➤
252 283 ➤
Useful for some products the integration by parts formula is derived by integrating the
product rule of differentiation:
d(uv)
dx
= udv
dx + v du
dx

udv
dx dx = uv −

v du
dx dx
(‘integrate one, differentiate the other’).
273

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
First, note that not all products can be integrated by parts, and that integration by parts
can be useful for things that are not obvious products. We may also need to use it a number
of times, or employ it in more cunning ways (see review solutions).
The ﬁrst problem we face with integration by parts is which factor to integrate ﬁrst.
There are few hard and fast rules, and experience counts for a lot here. Still, we can get
a lot from our knowledge of the elementary functions:
Polynomials
Rational functions
Irrational functions
Cosine and sine
Exponentials
and their inverses. Rational and irrational (containing roots of algebraic functions) functions
are difﬁcult to deal with when combined with other functions, so we will focus on products
of polynomials, cosine and sine and exponentials. By linearity, if we can handle a power
function xn then we can handle a polynomial. Also, cosine and sine are virtually equivalent
so far as calculus is concerned, so we can concentrate on sine. Finally, eαx, sin(αx) are
little different to ex, sin x so we can look at just products of the three functions xn, ex,
sin x. This gives us integrals such as:
I1 =

xnex dx
I2 =

xn sin x dx
I3 =

ex sin x dx
In I1, I2 integrating or differentiating ex or sin x is neither here nor there because essen-
tially the same things results. However, integrating xn will make things worse, while
differentiating it will eventually remove it. So for I1, I2 we start off by integrating ex
or sin x so that the xn will be differentiated. In I3 it actually doesn’t matter which we
integrate ﬁrst, we will always come back to where we started – and indeed this is the
secret to this sort of integral (see review question).
ln x and inverse functions such as sin−1 x can be integrated by parts by treating them
as a product with 1 and integrating the 1. For example,

ln x dx =

1 × ln x dx
= x ln x −

x × 1
x dx = x ln x −x + C
Solution to review question 9.1.10
(i) We will use the integration by parts formula

udv
dx dx = uv −

v du
dx dx
274

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
but only on this ﬁrst example will we explicitly write
u = x
dv
dx = sin x
du
dx = 1
v = −cos x
to help you on your way. Note that we chose u = x so that when we
differentiate the x becomes a much more amenable 1! We have

x sin x dx = x(−cos x) −
 d(x)
dx (−cos x) dx
= −x cos x +

cos x dx
= −x cos x + sin x + C
With practice, you should be able to dispense with explicit use of u,
v, etc. – although continue with it until you feel conﬁdent enough to
do without.
(ii) We may need to use integration by parts more than once (if you do,
remember to keep integrating the same factor). Again, we are going to
chose to differentiate the x2 to reduce it, so we ﬁrst integrate the ex.

x2ex dx = x2(ex) −

2xex dx
= x2ex −2

xex −

ex dx

= x2ex −2xex + 2ex + C
(iii) In integrating

ex sin x dx we sometimes feel like we are going
round in circles with integration by parts! Write
I =

ex sin x dx = ex sin x −

ex cos x dx
(note that it doesn’t matter which of ex, sin x we integrate)
= ex sin x −

ex cos x −

ex(−sin x) dx

being careful to keep integrating the same factor
= ex(sin x −cos x) + C −

ex sin x dx
= ex(sin x −cos x) −I + C
275

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Note that we only need the one arbitrary constant. We can now
transfer the I to the left-hand side to get
2I = ex(sin x −cos x) + C
so
I = 1
2ex(sin x −cos x) + C
NB. Since C is arbitrary we have no need to keep changing it during
the manipulations, or introducing new arbitrary constants.
9.2.11 Choice of integration methods
➤
253 284 ➤
So far you have usually been told which method to use for a particular integral – a bit
like someone handing you just the right tool for a particular job when you need it. By
now you have developed a whole box of tools of integration, and there will not always be
someone around to tell you which to choose for the given jobs – you need to know the
tools and their uses well enough to choose the right ones for yourself. Efﬁcient selection
of the right tool from the box, as you will know, requires a lot of practice and experience,
and even the best of us will make mistakes at times. Sometimes the tool we pick won’t
ﬁt, so we have to try another. Sometimes different tools will do the same job, but one of
them is the best to use in a particular instance. It helps to have a rough summary of the
different types of tools, and for integration we have covered essentially:
•
standard integrals
•
simplifying the integrand
•
linear substitution
•
du = f ′(x) dx substitutions
•
the use of trig identities and substitutions
•
partial fractions
•
completing the square
•
integration by parts
Various strategies for choosing the best methods are discussed in other sections, and
here we will simply use the review question to bring together more examples. Be prepared
to go up a few blind alleys and don’t be afraid to make mistakes in this topic.
Solution to review question 9.1.11
(i) We
looked
at
rational
functions
such
as
x −3
x2 −6x + 4
in
Section 9.2.7, and the common methods are
• simpliﬁcation of the integrand (dividing out, etc.)
• substitution, du = f ′(x) dx
• partial fractions
• completing the square
In this case we notice that the numerator is almost the derivative
of the denominator, suggesting that we try the substitution u =
x2 −6x + 4 here.
276

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(ii) There are a number of ways we might tackle sin3 x, covered in
Section 9.2.8, but perhaps the easiest is to use the Pythagorean
identity to write sin2 x = 1 −cos2 x and then use the substitution,
u = cos x (271
➤
).
(iii) In eln x
x
you may notice that 1
x is the derivative of ln x, suggesting
the substitution u = ln x. But hopefully you are now happy enough
with the exponential function to note the simpliﬁcation eln x = x
and take it from there (259
➤
)!
(iv) In
x −1
2x2 + x −3 the top is not the derivative of the bottom, but we
notice that the denominator factorises into (2x + 3)(x −1) and so
the function can be simpliﬁed by cancelling the x −1 (provided x
is not equal to 1, of course), resulting in a simple linear substitution
and log integral (263
➤
).
(v) No, xe3x2 is not a prime candidate for integration by parts, despite
being similar to products we have dealt with in that way. Instead, we
notice that the x is almost the derivative of the x2 in the exponent,
and this suggests that the substitution u = x2 will rescue us here
(263
➤
).
(vi) Nasty looking functions such as
3
√
3 −4x −x2 containing roots of
algebraic functions usually succumb only to some sort of trig or
hyperbolic substitution as considered in Section 9.2.9 – though in
this case we need to complete the square ﬁrst. A similar integral is
done in Review Question 9.1.9(ii).
(vii) x sin(x + 1) yields to a straightforward integration by parts, in
which the sin(x + 1) is integrated ﬁrst (273
➤
).
(viii) cos4 x can be integrated by using the double angle formulae
cos 2x = 2 cos2 x −1 = 1 −2 sin2 x
to replace cos2 x and subsequently cos2 2x to leave us with integrals
of a constant, cos 2x and cos 4x (270
➤
).
(ix) By now you should see immediately that ln
ex
x

= x −ln x and
we have only to integrate the ln x, which can be done by parts, as
shown in Section 9.2.10.
(x) The denominator of
x + 2
x2 −5x + 6 factorises to (x −2)(x −3) and
we have a straightforward partial fractions to deal with (266
➤
).
(xi) xe2x provides a very typical integration by parts (273
➤
).
(xii) ln ex cos(ex) we note that the derivative of ex is of course ex which
tells us to substitute u = ex (263
➤
).
277

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(xiii) sin 2x cos 2x is, from the double angle formulae,
1
2 sin 4x and
becomes a standard integral on substituting u = 4x (271
➤
).
(xiv)
x −1
√
x2 −2x + 3
looks fearsome until we notice that the numerator
is almost the derivative of the quadratic under the square root,
prompting us to make the substitution u = x2 −2x + 3 (263
➤
).
(xv)
x + 3
x2 + 2x + 2
can be rewritten as
x + 1
x2 + 2x + 2 +
2
x2 + 2x + 2
whence the ﬁrst fraction can be integrated by the substitution u =
x2 + 2x + 2, and the second by completing the square (268
➤
).
(xvi) sin(4x) cos(5x) looks like (xiii) but in this case we have to use
the compound angle formulae to express it as a combination of
sin(9x) and sin x – a similar integral is done in Review Ques-
tion 9.1.8(iv) (271
➤
).
(xvii) ln x cos(x2 + 1) just notice that the x is almost the derivative of the
x2 + 1 and take it from there (263
➤
).
9.2.12 The deﬁnite integral
➤
253 284 ➤
If

f (x) dx = F(x) + C
then the deﬁnite integral of f .x/ between the limits x = a, x = b is the number:
 b
a
f (x) dx = [F(x)]b
a = F(b) −F(a)
That is, substitute the upper limit b in the indeﬁnite integral F(x) and subtract the value of
F(x) with the lower limit substituted. Notice that even if we include the arbitrary constant
in the actual integration, it will only cancel out when the difference between the upper
and lower limits is taken – so we can discard it in the deﬁnite integral. The variable x in
the deﬁnite integral is called a dummy variable, it being immaterial to the value of the
integral – thus
 b
a
f (x) dx =
 b
a
f (t) dt
In this respect the integration variable is like the summation index in the sigma notation
(102
➤
). As we will see in Chapter 10, the deﬁnite integral can be interpreted as an
area under a curve, and more rigorously as the limit of a sum – but here we are simply
interested in the technicalities of performing the deﬁnite integral.
Obvious properties of the deﬁnite integral are:
 a
a
f (x) dx = F(a) −F(a) = 0
 b
a
f (x) dx = F(b) −F(a) = −(F(a) −F(b)) = −

278

 b

f (x) dx +
 c
b
f (x) dx = F(b) −F(a) + F(c) −F(b) = F(c) −F(a)
=
 c
a
f (x) dx
Remember to change limits if you make a substitution – and to ensure that the substitution
is consistent with the values of the limits.
When integrating a deﬁnite integral by parts you can substitute the limits in as you go
along:
 b
a
udv
dx dx = [uv]b
a −
 b
a
v du
dx dx
When putting limits on integrals we must be careful to avoid, in the integration interval,
any points where the integral or integrand would not exist. For example
 1
0
dx
2x −1
is an improper integral because the integrand is not deﬁned at x = 1
2, which is within
the range of integration. Another type of ‘improper integral’ occurs when one or both
of the limits involves inﬁnity. We will see this speciﬁcally in Chapter 17, in the Laplace
transform, but for now we simply state the deﬁnition:
 ∞
0
f (x) dx = lim
a→∞
 a
0
f (x) dx
That is, we ﬁrst integrate using a ﬁnite limit a and then we let a tend to inﬁnity in the
result.
Solution to review question 9.1.12
A.
(i) The indeﬁnite integral of f (x) = x2 + 1 is F(x) = x3
3 + x,
ignoring the arbitrary constant. So
 1
0
(x2 + 1) dx = [F(x)]1
0 = F(1) −F(0) =
x3
3 + x
1
0
= 1
3 + 1 −0 = 4
3
(ii) We can ﬁt the limits in as we go along in integration by parts:
 1
0
xex dx = [xex]1
0 −
 1
0
ex dx
= e −0 −[ex]1
0
= e −(e −e0) = 1 since e0 = 1

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(iii) When we make a substitution, we can change the limits too – then
we don’t have to return to the original variables.
In
 1
0
x2
x3 + 1 dx the numerator is the derivative of the denomi-
nator (almost), so put u = x3 + 1.
Then du = 3x2 dx or x2 dx = du
3 .
The limits on u are obtained from the substitution
when x = 0,
u = 03 + 1 = 1
when x = 2,
u = 23 + 1 = 9
So
 2
0
x2
x3 + 1 dx = 1
3
 9
1
du
u = 1
3[ln u]9
1
= 1
3(ln 9 −ln 1)
= 1
3 ln 9
remembering that ln 1 = 0.
(iv) This sort of integral is very important in the theory of Fourier
series (see Chapter 17). Using the double angle formula we have
 2π
0
cos x sin x dx = 1
2
 2π
0
sin 2x dx
= −1
4[cos 2x]2π
0
= 0
B.
 2
0
dx
x2 −1 =
 2
0
dx
(x −1)(x + 1)
The integrand doesn’t exist (‘becomes singular’) at x = 1, which
is within the range of integration.

9.4 Applications
We will be devoting a lot of Chapter 10 to applications of integration, and you will have
ample opportunity to see applications of integration later in the book. For now we will
apply the skills learnt in this chapter to look ahead to Laplace transforms and Fourier
series, covered in Chapter?.
1. Suppose f (t) is a function of t, deﬁned for t ≥0. Then the integral
˜f (s) =
 ∞
0
f (t)e−st dt
is called the Laplace transform of f .t/ (the use of t as the variable is conventional,
since the Laplace transform is usually applied to functions of time). We will study
this in detail in Chapter 17. We will want to evaluate this integral for all the simple
elementary functions. In order to do this we will need to integrate ﬁnite integrals of
the sort
 a
0
f (t)e−st dt
for a constant a. Do this for the functions f (t) = 1, t, t2, et, sin t, cos t. Your results
should be functions of a and s. If you feel conﬁdent enough take the limit as a tends
to inﬁnity, thereby obtaining the laplace transforms of the functions – see Chapter 17
for the results.
2. Let f (t) be a function with period 2π. Then under certain conditions it can be expanded
in a series of sines and cosines in the form
f (t) = a0
2 +
∞

n=1
an cos nt +
∞

n=1
bn sin nt
This is called a Fourier (series) expansion for f (t). We study such series in detail in
Chapter 17, here we want to anticipate some of the results used there. The key task is
to determine the coefﬁcients an, bn of the Fourier series for a given function f (t). This
involves the use of a number of integrals of products of sines and cosines, which we
ask you to evaluate here.
If m, n are any integers, then:
 π
−π
sin mt sin nt dt = 0
if m ̸= n
 π
−π
cos mt cos nt dt = 0
if m ̸= n
 π
−π
cos2 nt dt = π
 π
−π
sin2 nt dt = π
 π
−π
sin mt cos nt dt = 0
for all m, n
 π
−π

 π
−π
cos mt dt = 0
285

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
These are called the orthogonality relations for sine and cosine. The limits −π, π on
the integrals may in fact be replaced by any integral of length 2π, or integer multiple
of 2π.
The coefﬁcients an, bn of the Fourier series for a given function f (t) can be deter-
mined by multiplying through by cos nx or sin nx, integrating over a single period and
using the above orthogonality relations to remove all but the desired coefﬁcient (see
Chapter 17). Show that in general
an = 1

Applications of Differentiation and
Integration
In general terms, the usefulness of calculus in elementary engineering maths lies in the
application of differentiation as a rate of change or slope of a curve and integration as an
area under a curve. These are essentially applications to very useful mathematical methods.
There are also speciﬁc applications to various disciplines of engineering, such as centroids
and moments of inertia in solid mechanics and rms values in electronic engineering.
Also, there are examples in statistics. The applications to mathematical methods are the
main subject of this chapter. Some engineering and statistics examples are covered under

10.2.1 The derivative as a gradient and rate of change
➤
291 309 ➤
The derivative, dy
dx , of a function y = f (x) is deﬁned by a limiting process precisely
to give the gradient or slope of the curve described by the function at a given point
x (230
➤
). As such it describes the rate of change of the function – the ‘steepness’ of
the curve. Thus, at a point where dy/dx is large and positive the curve of the func-
tion y = f (x) is increasing steeply as x increases. Other cases are tabulated below, as
examples – ﬁll in the missing entries.

It is important to note that the derivative is deﬁned at a point. Differentiation is therefore
what is called a local operation. The derivative of a function will only tell us about the
behaviour at a single point, and says nothing about the overall or global behaviour of the
function.
Solution to review question 10.1.1
(i) For the function y = x2 we have
dy
dx = 2x
At x = 1 this has the value 2 and so (a) the gradient at this point is
2, and (b) the rate of change is also 2.
(ii) For the function y = cos x the derivative is dy
dx = −sin x which is
equal to zero at x = π. So in this case the (a) gradient or slope of the
graph is zero at x = π, as is (b) the rate of change of the function. So,
at this point the tangent to the curve is horizontal, its slope being zero,
and the rate of change of the function is zero. We know, of course,
from the properties of cos x, that this point is a local minimum (see
Section 10.2.3) (182
➤
).

10.2.2 Tangent and normal to a curve
➤
291 310 ➤
The derivative at a point (a, b) on a curve y = f (x) will give us the slope, m, of the
tangent to the curve at that point. This tangent is a straight line with gradient m passing
through the point (a, b) and therefore has an equation (212
➤
)
y −b = m(x −a)
The normal to the curve y = f (x) at the point (a, b) is the line through (a, b) perpendicular
to the tangent – see Figure 10.1.

In mechanics, the normal is important because it deﬁnes the direction of the reaction to
a force applied to a smooth surface represented by the curve. If the gradient of y = f (x)
at (a, b) is m then the gradient of the normal through (a, b) will be −1
m (214
➤
). So the
equation of the normal is
y −b = −1
m(x −a)
Solution to review question 10.1.2
For the curve y = x2 −x −1 we have dy
dx = 2x −1.
So at (2, 1), the gradient is m = 2 × 2 −1 = 3.
The equation of the tangent at (2, 1) is therefore
y −1 = 3(x −2)
or
y = 3x −5
The gradient of the normal at (2, 1) is
−1
m = −1

293

10.2.3 Stationary points and points of inﬂection
➤
291 310 ➤
Since the derivative describes rate of change, or the slope, of a curve it can tell us a
great deal about the shape of a curve, and the corresponding behaviour of the function.
Figure 10.2 shows the range of possibilities one can meet.

Figure 10.2 Stationary points and points of inﬂection.
In all cases we assume that the function is continuous and smooth (the graph has no
breaks and no sharp points). At points A, C, E, where dy/dx is zero, y is not actually
changing at all as x varies – the tangent to the curve is then parallel to the x-axis at
such points as shown. These are called stationary points. So, at a stationary point of the
function y = f (x) we have
dy
dx = f ′(x) = 0
The value of f (x) at a stationary point is called a stationary value of f (x). Note that we
will usually use the ‘dash’ notation for derivatives in the rest of the book – it saves space!
There are a number of different types of stationary points illustrated in Figure 10.2,
displaying the different possibilities – C is a minimum point, and A is a maximum. E is
a stationary point where the tangent crosses the curve – this is an example of an important
point called a point of inﬂection. B and D are also points of inﬂection of a different
kind – the tangent crosses the curve, but is not horizontal – see below. The maximum and
minimum points are called turning points, since the curve turns at such points and changes
direction. As emphasised above, differentiation is a local procedure. So, for example any
minimum identiﬁed by differentiation is only a local minimum, not necessarily an overall
294

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
global minimum of the function. Similarly for a maximum. Indeed, for a function such
as y = x + 1
x the local minimum actually has a higher value than the local maximum
(➤297).
While the graphical representation of the behaviour of functions is very suggestive,
we need a means of distinguishing stationary points and points of inﬂection that depends
only on the derivatives of the function in question. The graphical form provides a hint as
to how this might work. As an example, consider a minimum point at say x = x0 (see
Figure 10.3).
x
x0
y
0
y = f(x)
f(x) decreases as 
x increases
f(x) increases as 
x increases
Figure 10.3 Behaviour at a minimum.
To the left of x0, i.e. for x < x0, y = f (x) is decreasing as x increases, and f ′(x) < 0.
For x > x0, y increases as x increases and so f ′(x) > 0. And of course at x = x0 we have
f ′(x) = f ′(x0) = 0. So, near to a minimum point we can summarise the situation as in
the table below:
x < x0
x = x0
x > x0
f ′(x) < 0
f ′(x) = 0
f ′(x) > 0
This characterisation no longer relies on the graphical representation – it depends only on
the values of the derivative at different points. Rather than use this table as a means of
verifying a minimum point, we look at the implications it has for the second derivative of
the function. In this case we see that as x passes through x0, f ′(x) is steadily increasing.
That is
d
dx
dy
dx

= d2y
dx2 = f ′′(x) > 0
So a minimum point x = x0 on the curve y = f (x) is characterised by
f ′(x0) = 0
and
f ′′(x0) > 0
Similarly, for a maximum point we obtain the table
x < x0
x = x0
x > x0
f ′(x) > 0
f ′(x) = 0
f ′(x) < 0
295

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
and so in this case the derivative is decreasing as we increase x through x = x0 and thus
a maximum point x = x0 is characterised by
f ′(x0) = 0
f ′′(x0) < 0
Now what happens if f ′′(x0) = 0? Then, it is not clear whether or not the gradient, f ′(x),
is changing at x = x0 and a more careful examination is necessary. An example of one
possibility occurs at the point E in Figure 10.2, at which point
f ′(x0) = f ′′(x0) = 0
This is a particular example of a point of inﬂection. B and D are other examples, but
these are clearly not stationary points – the gradient is not zero. In these cases f ′′(x0) = 0
but f ′(x0) ̸= 0. So what precisely characterises a point of inﬂection?
Look more closely at the point B in Figure 10.2. To emphasise the point we will bend
the curve somewhat near to B, as in Figure 10.4. Take x = x0 as the coordinate of B here.
x
B
x0
Figure 10.4 Detail of a point of inﬂection.
On either side of B the gradient is negative. However, on the left of B, x < x0, the
curve is below the tangent. We say the curve here is concave down. To the right of B,
x > x0, the curve is above the tangent and we say it is concave up. Looking at points
D and E we see a similar change:
left of D – concave up
right of D – concave down
left of E – concave down
right of E – concave up
In general, any point where there is such a change of sense of concavity is called a point
of inﬂection, meaning a change in the direction of bending of the curve. At such a point
you will see that it is the rate of change of the gradient that is changing sign. For example:
left of B, gradient steepens as x increases – curve concave down
right of B, gradient decreases as x increases – curve concave up
So even though the gradient of f (x) may not be zero at a point of inﬂection – i.e. we
may not have a stationary value – the rate of change of the gradient, f ′′(x0), at such a
point must be zero. However, note that the condition f ′′(x0) = 0 does not itself guarantee
a point of inﬂection. The Review Question 10.1.4(v) illustrates this.

Solution to review question 10.1.3
(i) For the function f (x) = 16x −3x3 we have f ′(x) = 16 −9x2. Solving
f ′(x) = 16 −9x2 = 0
gives stationary values at x = ± 4
3. To classify these consider the second
derivative f ′′(x) = −18x. So, for x = 4
3,
f ′′( 4
3) = −24 < 0
and we have a maximum.
For x = −4
3 we have
f ′′(−4
3) = 24 > 0
and we have a minimum.
We also note that f ′′(x) = 0 at x = 0, so there is a possibility of a
point of inﬂection at this point. To investigate this we have to consider
how the gradient is changing on either side of x = 0. This is indicated
by the sign of f ′′(x):
x < 0
f ′′(x) = −18x > 0
x > 0
f ′′(x) = −18x < 0
So for x < 0, f ′′(x) = (f ′(x))′ is positive and therefore the gradient
f ′(x) is increasing as x increases and the curve is concave upwards. For
x > 0, f ′′(x) = (f ′(x))′ is negative, so the gradient f ′(x) is decreasing
and x increases and the curve is concave downwards. Thus x = 0 is
a point where the curve changes from concave up to concave down
as x increases – it is a point of inﬂection. The curve is sketched in
Figure 10.7.
Note that the complete story about the curve requires quite a careful
study of its derivatives.
(ii) For f (x) = x + 1
x we have f ′(x) = 1 −1
x2 . Solving
f ′(x) = 1 −1
x2 = 0
gives us stationary values at x = ±1. We ﬁnd
f ′′(x) = 2
x3
and so
f ′′(1) = 2 > 0
giving us a minimum at x = 1, while
f ′′(−1) = −2 < 0
giving us a maximum at x = −1.
297

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
In this case f ′′(x) is never zero for ﬁnite x, so we have no points
of inﬂection. Notice that in this case the local minimum value (2) is
greater than the local maximum value (−2), emphasising the local
nature of differentiation. The situation is sketched in Figure 10.8.
(iii) For f (x) = xex we have f ′(x) = ex + xex = 0 when x = −1, since
ex ̸= 0. At this stationary point we have
f ′′(x) = 2ex + xex = e−1 > 0 at x = −1
So x = −1 is a minimum point in this case.
Looking for points of inﬂection we note that f ′′(x) = ex(x + 2) = 0 at
x = −2. For x < −2, f ′′(x) < 0, f ′(x) decreases as x increases and
the curve is concave down. For x > −2, f ′′(x) > 0, f ′(x) increases
as x increases and the curve is concave up. So x = −2 is a point of
inﬂection. The curve is sketched in Figure 10.9.
(iv) We can write f (x) = sin x cos x = 1
2 sin 2x.
Then f ′(x) = cos 2x = 0 when 2x = (2n + 1)

π where n is an integer.
So there are turning points where

f ′′(x) = −2 sin 2x = −2 sin
2n + 1


For n even this is negative, while it is positive for n odd.
Thus we have maximum when x =
2n + 1
4

π for n even, and
minimum when n is odd.
Points of inﬂection can occur when f ′′(x) = −2 sin 2x = 0, i.e.
2x = mπ
where m is an integer, or x = mπ
2 .
(v) For f (x) = x4 we have f ′(x) = 4x3 = 0 when x = 0. So there is a
stationary point at x = 0. But
f ′′(x) = 12x2 = 0 when x = 0
So there may be a point of inﬂection at x = 0. However, we note that
for x < 0, f ′′(x) > 0, so the curve is concave up, while for x > 0 we
again have f ′′(x) > 0, again indicating that the curve is concave up.
So the concavity does not change at x = 0 and therefore it is not a point
of inﬂection. In fact, the graph is easy to sketch, and we clearly have a
minimum at x = 0 (see Figure 10.11, Review Question 10.1.4(v). This
illustrates that the vanishing of the second derivative, while essential
for a point of inﬂection is not a guarantee of one.

10.2.4 Curve sketching in Cartesian coordinates
➤
291 310 ➤
Curve sketching is exactly that – it does not mean plotting the curve, as in Chapter 3,
although one might actually plot a few special points of the curve, such as where it
intercepts the axes. A sketch of a curve shows its general shape and main features, it is
not necessarily an accurate drawing. In sketching a curve we deduce what we can about it
from quite general observations, such as where it increases, decreases, or remains bounded
as x becomes large or small. Similarly we might look for stationary values, intercepts on
the axes and so on.
With modern calculators capable of plotting almost any curve we might wonder why
curve sketching is necessary at all – is it like shoeing horses, for example? Not at all.
Apart from the fact that you might not always have a graphics calculator to hand, the
main beneﬁt of the skills of curve sketching is that it gives you an appreciation of how
functions behave, and what the properties of the derivative can tell you about this. It
gives you a ‘feel’ for the function. Being able to sketch the rough shape of a given
rational function, for example, is a far more portable skill than being able to graph it on
a calculator by pressing a few buttons.
Of course, we already know a large number of different graphs of the various ‘elementary
functions’ we have considered, and the ﬁrst step in sketching a curve is to see whether it
is easily converted to one with which we are already familiar. The kinds of transformation
we can make are listed below.
1. y = f (x) + c translates the graph of y = f (x) by c units in the direction 0y.
2. y = f (x + c) translates the graph of y = f (x) by −c units in the 0x direction.
3. y = −f (x) reﬂects the graph of y = f (x) in the x-axis.
4. y = f (−x) reﬂects the graph of y = f (x) in the y-axis.
5. y = af (x) stretches y = f (x) parallel to the y-axis by a factor a.
6. y = f (ax) stretches y = f (x) parallel to the x-axis by a factor 1/a.
However, once these transformations are taken advantage of, we might still have quite
complicated graphs to sketch. We can follow a systematic procedure for sketching graphs
which can be nicely summarised in the acronym S(ketch) GRAPH:
•
Symmetry – does the curve have symmetry about the x- or y-axes, is
the function odd or even?
•
Gateways – where does the curve cross the axes?
•
Restrictions – are there any limits on the variable or function values?
•
Asymptotes – any lines that the curve approaches as it goes to inﬁnity?
•
Points – any points of special interest which are worth plotting?
•
Humps and hollows – any stationary points or points of inﬂection?
(I am indebted to Peter Jack for most of this pretty acronym.)
Working through each of these (not necessarily in this order) should provide a good
idea of the shape and major features of the curve. We describe each in turn.
S. We look for any symmetry of the curve. For example, if it is an even function,
f (x) = f (−x) then it is symmetric about the y-axis, and we only need to sketch
299

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
half the curve. This may reduce considerably the amount of work we have to do in
sketching the curve.
G. Look for points where the curve crosses the axes, or ‘gateways’. It crosses the y-axis
at points where x = 0, i.e. at the value(s) y = f (0). It crosses the x-axis at points
where y = 0, i.e. at solutions of the equation f (x) = 0.
R. Consider any restrictions on either the domain or the range of the function – that is,
forbidden regions where the curve cannot exist. The simplest such case occurs when
we have discontinuities. Thus, for example
y =
1
x + 1
does not exist at the point x = −1 – there is a break in the curve at this point. See
Figure 10.5.
x
y
1
0
−1
y =
1
x + 1
Figure 10.5 Asymptotes at a discontinuity.
Any rational function will have a number of such points equal to the number of real
roots of the denominator. Irrational functions such as
√
1 −x2 exhibit whole sets of
values that x can’t take, because for the square root to exist 1 −x2 must be positive,
hence the curve y =
√
1 −x2 does not exist for |x| > 1. Thus, the curve is conﬁned
to the region |x| ≤1.
A. Look for asymptotes. These are lines to which the curve becomes inﬁnitely close as
x or y tend to inﬁnity. Thus, the function y =
1
x + 1 has the x-axis as a horizontal
asymptote, since y →0 as x →±∞. It also has the line x = −1 as an asymptote to
which the curve tends as y →±∞. Of course the curve can never coincide with the
line because of the restriction (see above) x ̸= −1.
Also, look for the behaviour of the curve for very small and very large values of x or
y. This is often very instructive. For example, the curve y = x3 + x behaves like the
curve y = x for small values of x, allowing us to approximate the curve near the origin
by a straight line at 45° to the x-axis. For very large (positive or negative) values of
x it behaves like the cubic curve y = x3.
P. Consider any special points, apart from ‘gateways’ in the axes. They may literally
be simply speciﬁc points you plot to determine which side of an asymptote the curve
approaches from, for example.

H. Points of particular importance include maximum and minimum values (humps and
hollows) and also points of inﬂection. While we do already know how to ﬁnd these,
it may not in fact be necessary. Information already available may hint strongly at
certain turning values – for example a continuous curve which ends up going in the
same direction for two different values of x must have passed through at least one
turning value in between. Also, it is not always necessary to determine points of
inﬂection, especially those with a non-zero gradient, unless we want a really accurate
picture of the graph.
Solution to review question 10.1.4
(i) y = 16x −3x3
First check on the symmetry. The function is odd and so we need
only sketch it for x ≥0 and then obtain the whole curve by a rotation
of 180° about the origin.
Now ﬁnd the gateways. The curve crosses the y-axis (x = 0) when
y = 0, i.e. it passes through the origin. It crosses the x-axis at
y = 16x −3x3 = 0
i.e.
x = 0,
± 4
√
3
There are no restrictions on the domain – the function, being a poly-
nomial, exists for all values of x. It is continuous for all values of x
too. There are no asymptotes. Near the origin the x3 term is negli-
gible, and y ≃16x, so it looks like a very steep straight line with
positive slope. For very large values the curve behaves like y ≃−3x3,
and clearly as x →∞, y →−∞.
This discussion alone is enough to tell us that there is likely to be at
least one maximum point between 0 and
4

on the positive x-axis.

There is also a point of inﬂection at x = 0 (this follows by symmetry
anyway). This enables us to complete the sketch as shown in

Again, this is an odd function and so is symmetric under a 180°
rotation about the origin and we need only sketch it for x ≥0.
Gateways: The curve does not cross the y-axis, since there is a
discontinuity at x = 0. Also, it never crosses the x-axis, since
x + 1
x = x2 + 1
x
can never be zero.
Restrictions: For x > 0, y > 0, and for x < 0, y < 0, so the curve
is conﬁned to the upper half plane for x > 0 and to the lower half
plane for x < 0.
Asymptotes: As x →0 from above (that is through positive values
of x), y →+∞, so the y-axis is a vertical asymptote for x > 0. Also,
for x very large, y ∼x, so the straight line y = x is an asymptote as
x →∞. Consideration of the asymptotes alone hints at a minimum
for x > 0 (and a corresponding maximum for x < 0).
Special points: nothing, apart from:
Stationary points: From Review Question 10.1.3(ii) we have a
minimum at x = 1, and a maximum at x = −1.
Putting all this together, the graph is as shown in Figure 10.8.

10.2.5 Applications of integration – area under a curve
➤
291 310 ➤
There are many applications of integration in engineering and science, but for our purposes
they can be grouped into the categories:
•
Applications in further topics in engineering mathematics such as
Laplace Transform and Fourier series (Chapter 17) and solutions of
differential equations (Chapter 15).
•
Applications in mechanics to such things as centre of mass and moment
of inertia.
•
Geometrical applications such as calculating areas, volumes, lengths of
curves.
•
Applications in probability and statistics, such as mean values, root mean
square values, probability in the case of a continuous random variable.
The basic principle behind applications of integration is essentially that of obtaining a
total of a quantity by regarding it as the sum of a very large (inﬁnite) number of elementary
quantities:
304

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
•
an area split into strips
•
a curve split into line segments
•
a solid body split into very small particle like elements
The rest of this chapter will be concerned mainly with geometrical applications, although
the Applications section contains some examples from mechanics. The main objective is
to illustrate the general ideas and motivate the hard work necessary to master integration.
The area ‘under’ a curve is the, perhaps misleading, term used for the area enclosed
between a given curve and the x-axis. Or, it may be the area enclosed between two quite
general curves. Figure 10.12 illustrates the sorts of possibilities we can have.

(iii)
(ii)
(iv)
Figure 10.12 Areas and curves.
The case (i) is the easiest to deal with. In case (ii), note that areas below the axis are
regarded as negative. This is to conform with such results as:
 0
−π/2
sin x dx = −1
In case (iii) we would need to ﬁnd where the curves intersect and integrate the differ-
ence between the two functions over the appropriate region. Case (iv) also requires us
to integrate the difference of the functions, but now care must be taken to allow for the
difference in signs of the two areas.
Considering now the simple case (i) let us look at the connection between integration
and the area under a curve.
At the elementary level there are two common viewpoints of integration –
•
the integral as the inverse operation to differentiation, or anti-deriva-
tive (253
➤
):

2x dx = x2 + C
because

dx (x2 + C) = 2x

Figure 10.13 Area under a curve.
For theoretical discussion it is the latter viewpoint which is perhaps most useful – indeed,
the indeﬁnite integral can be viewed as the deﬁnite integral
 x
a
f (u) du
First we will show, using only simple ideas of limits, the connection between the two
viewpoints and then concentrate on the area viewpoint.
For a continuous curve, we can regard the area A under the curve as a function of x,
as shown in Figure 10.14.

Figure 10.14 The indeﬁnite integral as an area.
The area under the curve between a and x + h is denoted A(x + h). The difference bet-
ween the area under the curve between a and x + h and between a and x is A(x + h) −
A(x) and this is clearly the area of the thin strip above the interval (x, x + h). The area
of this thin strip is approximately 1
2[f (x + h) + f (x)] × h, the area of the thin trapezium
ABCD, if h is very small. So we have
A(x + h) −A(x) ≃1
2[f (x + h) + f (x)] × h
306

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
or
A(x + h) −A(x)
h
= 1
2[f (x + h) + f (x)]
and this approximation improves as h gets smaller. Indeed, taking the limit h →0 we get
lim
h→0
A(x + h) −A(x)
h

= 1
2[f (x + h) + f (x)]
= f (x)
From Section 8.2.2 (
➤
) we recognise the left-hand side as dA/dx:
lim
h→0
A(x + h) −A(x)
h

= dA
dx = f (x)
So, using the ﬁrst viewpoint of the integral, as the inverse of differentiation, we have
A(x) =
 x
a
f (x) dx
for the area under the curve.
This argument for the equivalence of ﬁnding an area and reversing an integration can be
extended to all other cases in Figure 10.12. The review questions illustrate what happens
in practice.

A. (i) The area under the curve y = 4x2 + 1 between x = 0 and x = 2

B. A sketch is always useful in this kind of question. The curves y =
x2 −x and y = 2x −x2 intersect where
x2 −x = 2x −x2
or x = 0, 3/2. They are sketched in Figure 10.15.
The area required is shaded. You can now see the reason for the sketch.
Between x = 0 and 1, the area for the curve y = x2 −x is negative.

When the area under a curve between the limits x = a, b is rotated once about the x-axis
a solid of revolution is formed. For the purposes of illustration we will assume that the
curve is entirely above the x-axis, so that the area rotated is positive. See Figure 10.16.

If we rotate a thin strip of area, dx wide, about the axis, then a thin disc is formed,
whose radius is r = y, and thickness is h = dx. The volume of this disc is approximately
‘πr2h’ = πy2 dx. So the total volume between the limits x = a and x = b is obtained by
integration as
 b
a
πy2 dx = π
 b

y2 dx
So, given a function y = f (x) between values x = a and x = b, entirely above the
x-axis, by rotating the area under its curve we generate a volume of revolution deter-
mined by substituting the function and values of a and b in the above integral. Review
Question 10.1.6 illustrates this.

10.4 Applications
1. The major application of differentiation in mechanics is in kinematics. In one-
dimensional motion along the x-direction the displacement of a moving particle is
a function of time, x(t) and at any time t its velocity and acceleration are given
respectively by
v = dx
dt = ˙x
a = d2x
dt2 = ¨x
(i)–(iv) give either the position x(t) (metres) or velocity v(t) (metres per second) of
a particle at time t. In each case ﬁnd (a) the velocity and (b) acceleration at the point
t = 1 sec and (c) determine when the particle is stationary.
(i)
x(t) = 3 −2t + t2
(ii)
v(t) = 2t −1
t2 + 1
(iii)
x(t) = e2t sin t
(iv)
v(t) = cos t
2. Sometimes rates of change of a variable are not calculated directly but in terms of the
rate of change of some other variable on which it depends. For example the rate of
change of the area of a circle in terms of the rate of change of its radius. In such cases
we use the function of a function rule:
A = πr2
so dA
dt = 2πr dr
dt
and we can calculate dA/dt knowing the rate of change of r.

5. One method of obtaining an estimate ¯x of a quantity x from a set of n measurements
of x (all of which may be subject to experimental error), x1, x2, . . . , xn is to choose ¯x
to minimise the sum:
s = (x1 −¯x)2 + (x2 −¯x)2 + · · · + (xn −¯x)2
This is called the method of least squares. It minimises the total squared deviation
from ¯x.
Determine ¯x according to this principle and comment on the result.

the ﬁrst moments of the system with respect to the yz-, zx-, xy-planes respectively. In
the case of a continuous body the above particle system is replaced by the elements
of the body and integrals used as the limits of the summations. For example:
¯x =

The centre of mass G of a plane lamina lies in the plane of the lamina. If the lamina is
uniform, G is called the centroid of the area of the lamina and if this area is symmetrical
about any straight line, the centroid lies on this line. The coordinates of the centre of

Vectors
Vectors are the mathematical tools needed when we deal with engineering systems in
more than one dimension. Vector quantities such as force have both a magnitude and
direction associated with them, and so are represented by mathematical symbols that,
similarly, have a magnitude and direction. We can construct an algebra of such quantities by
which they may be added, subtracted, multiplied (in two different ways) – but not divided.
These rules of combination reﬂect the ways in which the corresponding physical quantities
behave – for example vectors add in the same way that forces do, the scalar product
represents ‘vector times vector = scalar’ in the same way that ‘velocity times velocity =
energy’. By introducing a coordinate system, we can also represent vectors by arrays of
ordinary numbers, in which form they are easier to combine and manipulate.

11.1 Introduction – representation of a vector quantity
Think of three examples of physical quantities: temperature, force, shear stress. Each of
these is represented mathematically by a different type of object, reﬂecting the way in
which these physical quantities behave and combine.
Temperature requires just one number for its speciﬁcation – this is called a scalar quan-
tity. Other examples of scalar quantities are mass, distance, speed.
Force requires a magnitude and a single direction for its speciﬁcation – this is called a
vector quantity. Other vector quantities are displacement and velocity.
Shear stress requires the relative motion of two parallel planes for its speciﬁcation – this
is called a tensor quantity. We do not consider tensors in this book, but they are very
important in, for example, solid mechanics.
Scalars, vectors and tensors are all different types of mathematical objects that are
deﬁned and combined amongst themselves in such a way as to model the respective
physical quantities.
The ﬁrst conceptual hurdle that we have to overcome with vectors concerns how we
represent them. A vector quantity can be represented at two levels:
• as a directed line segment drawn on a piece of paper, and represented by a symbol
possessing both magnitude and direction, satisfying an algebra that reﬂects geometrical
combinations – ‘vectors as arrows’
• by a mathematical object consisting of some numbers that effectively describe the magni-
tude and the direction of the quantity, and combine in such a way as to represent
combinations of the quantity – vectors as arrays of numbers, or ‘components’. This
requires an explicit coordinate system, and the numbers representing the vector will
depend on this system.
Both of these representations are used at the elementary level, but the connection between
them is not always easy to see. The situation is not helped by the fact that the terms ‘scalar’
318

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
and ‘vector’ are also used in matrix theory, and indeed matrices can be used to represent
vectors – a 3×1 column matrix can be used to represent a vector for example. Again, the
connections between these ideas are not always clear. However, we will usually use the
representation of vectors by arrays, which is relatively straightforward to operate.
In this book we will usually denote vectors by bold lower case – in written work it
is usual to denote them by under line (a) or over line (a). To denote speciﬁc vector
displacements from points A to B we use the notation
−→
AB or AB
Note that vectors have units of course, depending on the physical quantity they represent.
Whichever representation of vectors we use, we will eventually need a three dimen-
sional coordinate system – simply so that we can state such things as length and direction
unequivocally. There are a number of such coordinate systems in common use but we
will use the simplest and most popular one – the generalisation of rectangular Cartesian
coordinates.

11.2 Vectors as arrows
This is the most common approach to vectors at the elementary level. We treat the line
segment representing a vector a as an abstract geometrical ‘free’ object. If a is speciﬁcally
ﬁxed to an origin, then it is referred to as a position vector – its tip designating the
position of the point at the tip. Pictorially, we might display vectors as in Figure 11.1.
a
−a
Figure 11.1 Free vectors as arrows.
Note that the vector −a is simply a in the opposite sense.
An algebra of such objects can be constructed which reﬂects geometrically the way in
which vector quantities combine. Naturally, two vectors are equal if and only if they have
the same magnitude and direction. The zero vector has zero magnitude and undeﬁned
direction – it is denoted 0.
319

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
The length or magnitude of a vector, a, is denoted |a| or just a. The direction of a is
represented by a vector in the same direction, but with unit magnitude, and is denoted by
ˆa. Thus, we may write a = |a|ˆa.
Exercise on 11.2

equal angles with the positive x- and y-axes.

tive y-axis north).

11.3 Addition and subtraction of vectors
Geometrically, vectors are added by the use of the triangle law in which a and b form
two sides of a triangle in order, as shown in Figure 11.2. Then the resultant is the third
side, denoted here with a double arrow. This representation of addition is in keeping with
vectors describing displacements for example – following vector a and then continuing
along vector b takes you to the same place that the resultant of vectors a and b takes you
directly. In Figure 11.2 we represent this explicitly by showing displacements between
three points A, B, C.

Figure 11.2 Triangle addition of vectors.
The resultant of a and b is denoted by the vector sum a + b or by −→
AC. This can be
regarded as ‘a followed by b gives a + b’.
An alternative means of geometrical addition, linked to the calculation of the resultant
of two forces, is the parallelogram law. Thus to add vectors a and b we construct
a parallelogram with a and b forming two sides and then their sum or resultant, in
magnitude and direction, is represented by the diagonal of the parallelogram, as shown
in Figure 11.3. This represents the way in which vector quantities such as force combine.
For example, if you imagine two horses on either side of a canal pulling a barge, then
the resultant force on the barge will be represented by the diagonal of the corresponding
parallelogram.
a + b
a

Using either viewpoint – triangle or parallelogram – by constructing appropriate
diagrams you can convince yourself that
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
(vector addition is associative)
a + b = b + a
(vector addition is commutative)
Three or more vectors can be added by the polygon law as illustrated in Figure 11.4 – the
resultant or sum ‘closes’, in the opposite direction, the polygon formed by following the
vectors in the sum in turn.

A particular example of this is scalar multiplication of a vector by a scalar – the vector
ka is simply a with its magnitude scaled by k.
Vectors may be subtracted geometrically as shown in Figure 11.5. Thus, we can denote
the vector b −a by the ‘arrow’ that takes us from a to b, since a followed by b −a gives
the same displacement as b.

11.4 Rectangular Cartesian coordinates in three
dimensions
To represent points, geometrical objects, vectors, etc. in 3-dimensional space it is useful to
have a reference frame or coordinate system. The simplest type is the Cartesian system
of rectangular coordinates, which generalises the usual x-, y-axes of two dimensions – see
Figure 11.6, which shows how a point P may be represented by coordinates (x1, y1, z1)
relative to a three-dimensional rectangular system of x-, y-, z-axes.

Figure 11.6 Rectangular Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions.
P N is the perpendicular to the x-y plane. The axes are shown arranged in the usual
convention in which the Ox, Oy, Oz form a right-handed set – rotating Ox round to
Oy drives a right-handed screw along Oz. The same applies if we replace Ox →Oy →
Oz →Ox, etc.
We say that the coordinates of P relative to the axes Oxyz are (x1, y1, z1) or ‘P is the
point (x1, y1, z1)’ where the coordinates are the distances of P along the x-, y-, z-axes
respectively. We can label each point of 3-dimensional space with a set of ‘coordinates’
(x, y, z) relative to a particular coordinate system. For a given point, choosing a different
set of axes gives a different set of coordinates.

11.6 Direction cosines and ratios
NB. Sections 11.6–8 are not essential to what follows and may be safely omitted for
the student who simply wants to be able to use vectors. However, the ideas are very
important in more advanced engineering mathematics and occur in such topics as CAD
and surveying.
While the coordinates of a point P (x, y, z), tell us everything that we need to know
about the line segment OP , they are not very convenient for indicating its direction, which
is most easily done by means of angles. When soldiers aim a ﬁeld gun they do not specify
the coordinates of the tip of the barrel – they give the angle of elevation of the barrel,
and the bearing of the target. Similarly, the best way to specify the direction of OP is
to specify the angles it makes with the axes. But we still want to retain a link with the
coordinates (x, y, z) and for this reason we use the cosines of these angles – the so-called
direction cosines.
Let OP make angles α, β, γ with the axes Ox, Oy, Oz respectively – see Figure 11.7.

from which, since
r2 = x2 + y2 + z2,
l2 + m2 + n2 = 1
Note that the direction cosines of a line not passing through the origin are the same as
those of a parallel line through origin.
The numbers l, m, n are not always the most convenient to use – they are all less than
or equal to 1 in magnitude. Often all we need is simply the relation between them. Any
three numbers a, b, c satisfying (14

are called direction ratios of OP .

Consider the points on the axes – in this case the direction cosines are simply given by
the points themselves (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1).
Now consider the point (1, 0, 1). The position vector to this makes an angle 45° with
the x- and z-axes, and 90° with the Oy-axis. The direction cosines are therefore directly

11.7 Angle between two lines through the origin
Using direction cosines we can obtain a simple and useful expression for the angle between
two lines intersecting at the origin. In general, the angle between any two lines in space,
not necessarily intersecting, is the angle between any pair of lines parallel to them. In
particular we can always take a pair of lines through the origin. This expression for the
angle between two lines will be useful in discussing the angle between two vectors. This
comes into the different types of products that we can make with vectors (the scalar and
the vector product – see Sections 11.10 and 11.11). Consider Figure 11.9.
Suppose two lines OA, OA′ have direction cosines l, m, n and l′, m′, n′ respectively
with respect to axes Oxyz. Then we will show that
cos θ = ll′ + mm′ + nn′

Figure 11.9 Angle between two lines.
This follows by applying the cosine rule to the triangle OBB′ in Figure 11.10 where OB,
OB′ are of unit length. Then B, B′ have the coordinates (l, m, n) (l′, m′, n′) respectively.
We have, by the cosine rule (179
➤
)
BB′2 = OB2 + OB′2 −2OBOB′ cos θ
or
(l′ −l)2 + (m′ −m)2 + (n′ −n)2 = 12 + 12 −2 cos θ = 2 −2 cos θ
Expanding the left-hand side and using l2 + m2 + n2 = 1 for the direction cosines yields
l′2 + m′2 + n′2 + l2 + m2 + n2 −2ll′ −2mm′ −2nn′
= 1 + 1 −2(ll′ + mm′ + nn′) = 2 −2 cos θ
This then gives the required result cos θ = ll′ + mm′ + nn′.
From this result it follows that if two lines are perpendicular then
ll′ + mm′ + nn′ = 0
because
cos(±90°) = 0

11.8 Basis vectors
We can use the coordinate system deﬁned in Section 11.4 to represent vectors in terms of
numerical components by choosing ‘basis vectors’ along the coordinate axes. The standard
notation for this is to let i, j, k denote the unit vectors along the x-, y-, z-axes as shown
in Figure 11.10.
In terms of these ‘basis vectors’ we can write any vector, a, in the component form
a = a1i + a2j + a3k

E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s

O

j
k
y
z
Figure 11.10 Basic vectors i, j, k.
and this provides the link with the ‘arrows’ representation of vectors given in earlier
sections. It is common practice to represent a1i + a2j + a2k by a triple (a1, a2, a2) or a
‘column matrix’
a =
 a1
a2
a3

but always remember that these only represent the vector a with respect to a particular
set of basis vectors, and should not be confused with the notation for the coordinates of
a point.
Any set of unit vectors, such as i, j, k which are mutually perpendicular to each other
(and there can be at most three in 3-dimensional space) is called an orthonormal set. The
i, j, k form an orthonormal basis for the set of all vectors, in the sense that any three
dimensional vector can be expressed in terms of them.
Note that a1i + a2j + a3k = 0 can only mean a1 = a2 = a3 = 0.
Problem 11.3
Find a, b, c if .a Y b Y c/i Y .b −c Y 1/j Y .a Y c/k = 0.
Don’t let the Greek symbols put you off – as mathematics gets more advanced we soon
run out of alphabets and so you will have to get used to such notation.
If (α + β + χ)i + (β −χ + 1)j + (α + χ)k = 0 then
α + β + χ = 0
(i)
β −χ + 1 = 0
(ii)
α + χ = 0
(iii)
So a single vector equation is equivalent to three ‘scalar’ equations. We will consider such
systems of equations in detail in Chapter 13, but the above system is not difﬁcult to solve.
Substituting for β from (ii) into (i) gives
α + 2χ = 1
α + χ = 0
from which χ = 1, α = −1, then β = χ −1 = 0.

In general a vector a = a1i + a2j + a3k is multiplied by a scalar λ as follows:

i.e. all components are multiplied by λ.

Vectors a = a1i + a2j + a3k, b = b1i + b2j + b3k are added and subtracted ‘componen-

a + b = (a1 + b1)i + (a2 + b2)j + (a3 + b3)k
a −b = (a1 −b1)i + (a2 −b2)j + (a3 −b3)k

a + b = b + a

a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c

11.10 The scalar product of two vectors
So far we have simply added or subtracted vectors, or formed linear combinations of them.
An obvious question is what sorts of ‘products’ can we deﬁne for two vectors. By ‘product’
we mean a generalisation of the multiplication of two real numbers. It is important to
realise that we are free to deﬁne such products – vectors are new mathematical objects,
completely different from anything we have considered before in this book, and we are at
liberty to deﬁne the combinations of them in any way we wish which is mathematically
consistent. When we invent new mathematical tools this is always the case – so long as
our deﬁnitions do not lead to any silly contradictions (such as ‘1 = 0’) we can deﬁne the
rules exactly as we wish. But of all the possible rules, we are naturally going to choose the
most useful. So if we do deﬁne products of vectors then we are going to do so in such a
way that the result is useful to us in modelling reality. We have (at least) two possibilities
for deﬁning ‘multiplication’ of vectors:
vector ∗vector = scalar
vector ∗vector = vector
Not surprisingly these give rise to the ‘scalar’ and ‘vector product’ respectively.
The best way to introduce the scalar product is to do a little ‘work’. Speciﬁcally, if a
force of magnitude F acting in a ﬁxed direction moves a particle through a displacement
d in that direction, then we say that the ‘work done’ by the force on the particle is:
W = Fd
(1)
Now, both force and displacement are vector quantities – they require both magnitude and
direction to specify them. This is hidden in the above result because both the force and the
displacement have been taken as operating in the same ﬁxed direction. So, the right-hand
side of the above equation is essentially a vector times a vector.
On the other hand, work done, or energy expended, is not a vector quantity – energy is
simply a scalar, numerical quantity, like temperature or heat. So the left-hand side of the
equation is a scalar. Thus, the equation essentially says:
“vector ‘×’ vector = scalar”
But, as we said, the vector content is hidden. To bring it out, suppose F no longer acts
on the particle in its own direction, but at an angle to it. For example the particle may be
a bead on a straight smooth wire, and the force applied by pulling a string at an angle θ
to the wire, as shown in Figure 11.13.
Only the component of the force along the direction of the wire can do work on the
bead (the component perpendicular to the wire will not result in any motion along the
333

wire). This component is F cos θ. So, if we move the bead a distance d along the wire
then the work done is
W = (F cos θ)d
= Fd cos θ
This is the generalisation of equation (1) when the force and displacement make an angle
θ with each other. So, let F be the vector representing the force and d represent the
displacement. Then the work done is:
W = |F| |d| cos θ
i.e. the magnitude of the force F multiplied by the magnitude of the displacement d, times
the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.
The result is, naturally, a scalar. But it has a magnitude component, |F| |d|, and a
direction component θ, which suggest that it would be very useful to deﬁne this particular
combination of vectors as a ‘product’ of vectors which yields a scalar. In general then the
scalar product of two vectors a, b is denoted by a · b (sometimes called the dot product)
and deﬁned by
a · b = ab cos θ
where a = |a|, b = |b| and θ is the angle between a and b – see Figure 11.14.
q
b
a
Figure 11.14 The scalar product is a · b = abcos θ.
With this deﬁnition the work done by the force F moving a particle through a displace-
ment d is given by
W = F · d
This explains why we deﬁne the scalar product as above – it is very useful to do so!
Now, for the purposes of calculations it is invariably more convenient to have an expres-
sion for the scalar product in terms of components. The deﬁnition we have given above,
as we will see shortly, is equivalent to the following expression in terms of components:
a · b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3 = b · a
334

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Note the special case:
a · a = a2
1 + a2
2 + a2
3 = a2 ≡|a|2
= square of magnitude of a
In the above form of the scalar product it is not difﬁcult to show that the scalar product
has the following properties:
(i)
a · b is a scalar
(ii)
a · b = b · a
i.e. the scalar product is commutative
(iii)
a · (b + c) = a · b + a · c
i.e. the scalar product is distributive over addition
(iv)
(ka) · b = k(a · b) = a · (kb) for any scalar k
(v)
If a · b = 0 and a, b are not zero then a is perpendicular to b.
Problem 11.7
If a = 2i −j Y 2k and b = 2i Y 4j −3k evaluate a · b, b · a, a2, b2
a · b = 2(2) + (−1)(4) + 2(−3) = 4 −4 = −6
b · a = 2(2) + 4(−1) + (−3)(2) = −6, agreeing with property (ii)
a2 = |a|2 = a · a = (2)2 + (−1)2 + 22 = 9
b2 = 22 + 42 + (−3)2 = 29
To see the connection of the above ‘component expression’ for the scalar product with the
a · b = ab cos θ deﬁnition, we appeal to the work we did on direction cosines. You can
omit this if you are prepared to take the result on trust. We have
a · b

giving, to two decimal places,

for the acute angle between the vectors a and b.
Two non-zero vectors a, b are perpendicular to each other, or mutually orthogonal if
a · b = 0
This follows directly from cos θ = 0 for θ = ±π/2.
For the i, j, k basis vectors we easily ﬁnd: (Reinforcement Exercise 16)
i · i = j · j = k · k = 1
i · j = i · k = j · k = 0
Using these provides a direct derivation of the result:
a · b = a1b1 + a2b2 + a3b3

11.11 The vector product of two vectors
Now what about a vector valued ‘product’ of vectors? In this case we will simply deﬁne
the vector product in terms of components ﬁrst and give the connection with the a, b, θ
form later. The mechanical application of the vector product as a moment of a force is
given in the Applications section.
The vector product of a = a1i + a2j + a3k with b = b1i + b2j + b3k is denoted a × b
(‘a cross b’) and deﬁned by:
a × b = (a2b3 −a3b2)i + (a3b1 −a1b3)j + (a1b2 −a2b1)k

You can also verify explicitly that
b × a = i −3j −2k = −a × b
From the above deﬁnition it can be shown that the vector (or cross) product has the
following properties:
(i)
a × b is a vector
(ii)
a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c and (a + b) × c = a × c + b × c
i.e. the vector product is distributive over vector addition
(iii)
(ka) × b = k(a × b) = a × (kb) for any scalar k
(iv)
If a × b = 0 and a, b are not zero vectors, then a and b are parallel
(v)
b × a = −a × b as illustrated by Problem 11.9
(vi)
a × a = 0, which follows from (v)
(vii)
The vector product is not associative, i.e.
a × (b × c) ̸= (a × b) × c

For the basis vectors i, j, k we ﬁnd (Reinforcement Exercise 24)
i × i = j × j = k × k = 0
i × j = k,
j × k = i,
k × i = j
Geometrically the vector product can be expressed as:
a × b = ab sin θn
where n is a unit vector perpendicular to both a and b such that a, b, n form a right-handed
set – see Figure 11.15.
q

n
Figure 11.15 The vector product is a × b = absin θn.
The proof of this is an interesting exercise. Take the x-axis to be along a and b to be
in the xy plane (we can always choose axes in this way). Then
a = ai
b = b1i + b2j
so
a × b = ab2i × j = ab2k
But also we have:
b2 = b sin θ
so
a × b = ab sin θk
which is equivalent to the above result.
The two vectors a, b are parallel or opposite and parallel if and only if a × b = 0 (then
θ = 0 or 180°).

11.12 Vector functions
A vector function is a vector which is a function of some variable, say t. We write f(t)
for a general vector function. For example the position of a projectile may be represented
by a vector, r referred to some origin, and this position will vary with time, t. We can
represent this by taking r to be a function of t, r(t). So r(t) is a vector function of time
t. This is illustrated in Figure 11.16.
P x(t ),y(t ),z(t )
x
y
z
r (t ) = x(t )i + y(t )j + z(t )k
Figure 11.16 Position vector of a vector function.
The set of values of the variable t is called the domain of the vector function, while
the set of possible vectors f(t) is called the codomain or range of the vector function.
A vector for which both the magnitude and direction are constant, i.e. each component
is constant, is called a constant vector. Examples of constant vectors are i, j, k.
It is useful to know the vector functions representing lines and planes. The position
vector r of a general point P lying on a straight line passing through a point with position
vector a is
r = a + td
where d is any constant vector parallel to the line – see Figure 11.17.

Let P be any point in a plane, and let n be any vector normal to the plane. Let a be
the position vector of a ﬁxed point in the plane. If r is the position vector of P then r −a
will be a vector in the plane. As such it will be perpendicular to n, from which we have
(r −a) · n = 0

11.13 Differentiation of vector functions
The idea of a vector function f(t) of t raises the question of its rate of change as t
varies. In the case of the projectile of Section 11.12, this rate of change would represent
the velocity of the projectile at the time t. If you look back at the deﬁnition of the
derivative on page 231, the following deﬁnition will probably now make sense to you.
We are essentially applying the deﬁnition to each component of the vector function. The
derivative of a vector function f.t/, with respect to t is deﬁned by
df(t)

The properties of differentiation of a vector look very much like those of ordinary
differentiation, although the notation may be a bit unnerving at ﬁrst. We have three types
of product to contend with of course – multiplication by a scalar, scalar product and vector
product. On the other hand we don’t have to worry about a quotient rule, since we have
not deﬁned division of vectors. The rules are as follows.

When we introduced ordinary differentiation we referred it to the gradient or slope of a
curve. We can do the same for differentiation of vector functions – but it is now a little more
complicated. It is perhaps best to appeal to the example considered earlier of a vector function
r(t) describing the position of a particle at time t. Thus, let r(t) be the position vector of a
moving particle P . As t varies the particle moves along a curve in space – see Figure 11.19.

Complex Numbers
Complex numbers extend the notion of ordinary ‘real numbers’ to include a new kind of
‘number’, j =
√
−1. Such ‘numbers’ can be combined by the usual rules of algebra, except
that we replace j 2 by −1 wherever it occurs. Complex numbers do not serve the usual
role of numbers – we don’t measure physical quantities with them – but they provide a
very useful shorthand tool for dealing with certain combinations of real numbers. There is
not much that is conceptually new in this chapter, but we have to become more practised
at using basic, elementary mathematics.

12.1 What are complex numbers?
Numbers such as integers, rational numbers, etc. that we have been using so far are called
real numbers – they can be used to count with, or measure distances, time, etc. From the
rules of signs for combining negative numbers (11
➤
) we know that if we square two
such real numbers, the result will always be positive:
22 = +4
(−2)2 = +4
An obvious question is, is there any sort of mathematical object that results in a nega-
tive number when squared? Why should such an object be of interest anyway? In real
life we don’t need such quantities – no one ever measured the length of a line to be,
for example
√
−1 metres. True, we don’t need such ‘numbers’ for measuring and repre-
senting real physical quantities. However, it does turn out that such ‘numbers’ are very
useful as a mathematical tool in representing physical objects which have two parame-
ters – for example the amplitude and phase of a signal waveform may be conveniently
combined in ‘complex’ form. Also, such ‘numbers’ provide nice tools for calculational
purposes – as for example in differential equations. So, let’s accept that it’s useful to
look at the properties of such ‘numbers’ as
√
−1 and develop the tools necessary to
use them.
Start by considering the quadratic equation
x2 + 1 = 0
or
x2 = −1
This has no ‘real’ solution, but by introducing the symbol
j =
√
−1
(alternative notation i)
we can write
x = ±j
The object j is sometimes called ‘imaginary’, and is an example of a ‘complex number’.
There is, however, nothing imaginary about it. While it certainly does not represent a
‘quantity’ in the normal sense that a ‘real number’ such as 2 does, it is still a perfectly
proper symbol that serves a very useful purpose in mathematics. In particular, having
deﬁned it as above, it now allows us to write down the ‘solution’ of any quadratic
equation.
Problem 12.1
Write the solution of the equation x2 Y 2x Y 2 = 0, as given by the formula
(66

Any number of this form
z = a + jb
j =

where a, b are real numbers, is called a complex number. We will usually write z rather
than x for such a number since z always signals that we are talking about complex numbers.
a is called the real part of z, denoted Re z – it is a real number
b (not jb) is called the imaginary part, denoted Im z – also a real number
Real numbers are special cases of complex numbers with zero imaginary part.

12.2 The algebra of complex numbers
Complex numbers can be manipulated just like real numbers but using the property j 2 =
−1 whenever appropriate. Many of the deﬁnitions and rules for doing this are simply
common sense, and here we just summarise the main deﬁnitions.
Equality of complex numbers: a + jb = c + jd means that a = c and b = d.
To perform addition and subtraction of complex numbers we combine real parts
together and imaginary parts separately:
(a + jb) + (c + jd) = (a + c) + j(b + d)
(a + jb) −(c + jd) = (a −c) + j(b −d)
Also note that k(a + jb) = ka + jkb for any real number k.
At this point you may be noticing the similarity to our work on vectors in the previous
chapter.
Problem 12.2
If z = 1 Y 2j and w = 4 −j evaluate 2z −3w.
We have 2z −3w = 2(1 + 2j) −3(4 −j) = 2 + 4j −12 + 3j = −10 + 7j.
To multiply two complex numbers simply multiply out the brackets by ordinary algebra,
use j 2 = −1 and gather terms:
(a + jb)(c + jd) = ac + ajd + jbc + j 2bd = ac −bd + j(bc + ad)

Problem 12.3
Multiply (3 −j) and (2 Y 3j).
(3 −j)(2 + 3j) = 6 + 9j −2j −3j 2 = 6 + 7j −3(−1) = 9 + 7j
Given a complex number z = a + jb there is a very useful operation we can perform,
that converts the number to its ‘conjugate’. Thus, the complex conjugate of a complex
number z = a + ib is deﬁned as
¯z = a + (−j)b
(alternative notation z∗)
NB: In general the complex conjugate of a complex expression is obtained by changing
the sign of j everywhere it occurs. For examples of this see Reinforcement Exercise 5,
and 9.
Problem 12.4
Show that z ¯z is a positive real number which is only zero if a = b = 0,
i.e. if z = 0. Also show that z Y ¯z is always a real number.
This is the crux of the importance of ¯z. We have
¯zz = (a −jb)(a + jb) = a2 −(jb)2 = a2 −j 2b2 = a2 + b2
on using the difference of two squares (42
➤
). Now a2 and b2 are both non-negative
numbers and so z¯z is clearly positive. Also, the result can only add up to zero if both a
and b are zero. So ¯zz = 0 only if a = 0 and b = 0, i.e. if z = 0. We will see that these
properties of z¯z are very important when we come to dividing complex numbers.
Also, we have directly
z + ¯z = a + jb + a −jb = 2a
which is a real number.
The complex conjugate is also useful for characterising the real and imaginary parts of
a complex number. Thus, as you can easily check, if z is purely real, then ¯z = z while if
z is purely imaginary, then ¯z = −z. In general, you can see that (see Problem 12.4)
Re z = z + ¯z
2
Im z = z −¯z
2j
Problem 12.5
For z = 2 Y 3j evaluate z ¯z, Re z and Im z.
For z = 2 + 3j we have ¯z = 2 −3j and so
z¯z = 22 + 32 = 13
Re z = 2 + 3j + 2 −3j
2
= 2,
Im z = 2 + 3j −(2 −3j)
2j
= 3
which last results are obvious by inspection of z.

Division (or rationalization) of two complex numbers:
z = a + jb
c + jd
means converting into the standard form A + jB. We can do this by using the complex
conjugate, c −jd, of c + jd and the fact that (c −jd)(c + jd) = c2 + d2 which is real.
So, if we multiply top and bottom of the above complex number z by c −jd we get (see

12.3 Complex variables and the Argand plane
A general complex variable is denoted, in Cartesian form, by
z = x + jy
with x, y varying over real values. Such a variable can be represented by points in a plane
called the Argand plane (or complex plane) – see Figure 12.1.
x is called the real axis; y the imaginary axis. In this representation the complex
conjugate ¯z is the mirror image of z in the x-axis. The distance of the complex number z
from the origin is r =

x2 + y2, denoted |z| and called the modulus of z – it is always
taken to be the positive square root. The angle θ made by OP with the positive x-axis
is called the amplitude or argument of z. r and θ are polar coordinates (206
➤
) of the
point P deﬁning the complex number z.
An alternative representation of a complex number – the polar form – can be obtained
by using the polar coordinates (Figure 12.1) r, θ. Since x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ
we have
z = x + jy = r(cos θ + j sin θ) ≡r cis θ ≡r̸ (θ)

cis θ is shorthand for cos θ + i sin θ, using the alternative notation i for j. ̸ (θ) is the
standard shorthand for cos θ + j sin θ that we will use throughout this book.
Remember that θ is measured anti-clockwise positive from the x-axis, and, being an
angle, it will represent the same point in the plane at an inﬁnite number of different values,
separated by integer multiples of 2π. To obtain a single valued representation of z, θ must
be conﬁned to a range of length 2π. The particular choice −π < θ ≤π is called the
principal value of θ and is written Arg z. If the angle θ is not so conﬁned we use a lower
case notation arg z. The important point is that the argument of a complex number is not
unique. Thus for z = i we can take θ = π
2 , 5π
2 , −3π
2 , . . . , etc. In general we have
̸ (θ) = ̸ (θ + 2kπ)
for any integer k. This fact will play a crucial role in taking roots of a complex number
(➤363). It is also worth noting that while it is not essential to work in radians in complex
numbers, it tends to be the safest policy, particularly for theoretical work.
In terms of Cartesian coordinates we have Arg z = tan−1 y
x

, the sign and value of
the angle being determined by x and y. Also note that |z| = √z¯z.
You may ﬁnd the above polar representation of complex numbers rather strange – what’s
wrong with the simple x + jy form, you may ask? Well, as always there is method in
mathematics – bear with me, it turns out that the polar form of a complex number is much
easier to deal with in certain circumstances.

12.4 Multiplication in polar form
Now comes the pay-off of polar forms – multiplication of complex numbers in such form is
simplicity itself – indeed it reduces to multiplication of modulii and addition of argument.
See for yourself:
Problem 12.7
Multiply ̸ .q1/ and ̸ .q2/, use the compound angle formulae (187
➤
) and
hence show that
r1̸ .q1/r2̸ .q2/ = r1r2̸ .q1 Y q2/
357

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
We have
̸ (θ1)̸ (θ2) = (cos θ1 + j sin θ1)(cos θ2 + j sin θ2)
= cos θ1 cos θ2 −sin θ1 sin θ2 + j(sin θ1 cos θ2 + sin θ2 cos θ1)
= cos(θ1 + θ2) + j sin(θ1 + θ2) = ̸ (θ1 + θ2)
from which it follows directly that
r1̸ (θ1)r2̸ (θ2) = r1r2̸ (θ1 + θ2)
So, to multiply in polar form:
•
Multiply modulii to obtain modulus of product
•
Add arguments to obtain argument of product.
or:
|z1z2| = |z1||z2|
arg(z1z2) = arg(z1) + arg(z2)
Arg(z1z2) = Arg(z1) + Arg(z2) + 2kπ
(k = any integer)
Note carefully the last result. The 2kπ is needed because the principal value of the argu-
ments may add to give a value outside the principal value range.

12.5 Division in polar form
You can probably guess what happens with division in polar form now – divide modulii
and subtract arguments. Again, check the details for yourself:
̸ (θ1)
̸ (θ2) = cos θ1 + j sin θ1
cos θ2 + j sin θ2
= cos θ1 + j sin θ1
cos θ2 + j sin θ2
× cos θ2 −j sin θ2
cos θ2 −j sin θ2
= (cos θ1 cos θ2 + sin θ1 sin θ2) + j(sin θ1 cos θ2 −sin θ2 cos θ1)
(on using cos2 θ2 + sin2 θ2 = 1)
= cos(θ1 −θ2) + j sin(θ1 −θ2) = ̸ (θ1 −θ2)
Hence
r1̸ (θ1)
r2̸ (θ2) = r1
r2
̸ (θ1 −θ2)
So, to divide in polar form:
•
Divide modulii to obtain the modulus of the quotient
•
Subtract arguments to obtain the argument of the quotient.

12.6 Exponential form of a complex number
Having explained the usefulness of the polar form in multiplication and division of complex
numbers, I will now introduce a result that is as pretty as it is powerful:
ejθ ≡cos θ + j sin θ = ̸ (θ)
Remember that this result is unchanged if θ is replaced by θ + 2kπ where k is an integer.
This result for ejθ was ﬁrst stated explicitly by the Swiss mathematician Leonard Euler
(1707–83) in 1748 – not so long ago really. It is known, along with countless other results,
as Euler’s formula. It can be proved by expanding the left-hand side in series, gathering
together real and imaginary parts after using j 2 = −1 and summing the resulting series to
cos θ and sin θ (see Reinforcement Exercise 18).
Problem 12.10
By taking particular values for q show that
(i) ej0 = ej2p = 1
(ii) ejp = −1
(iii) ej p
2 = j
(i) ej0 = cos 0 + j sin 0 = 1 and similarly ej2π = cos 2π + j sin 2π = 1
(ii) ejπ = cos π + j sin π = −1
(iii) ej π
2 = cos π
2 + j sin π
2 = 0 + j1 = j
It can be shown that ejθ obeys all the usual indices laws:
ejxejy = ej(x+y) – from multiplication in polar form
ejx
ejy = ej(x−y) – from division in polar form
(ejx)y = ejxy – from an extension of Q2, Exercise 12.4

z = 1ej0 = ej0

12.7 De Moivre’s theorem for integer powers
A remarkable result ‘follows’ from the above Euler formula, if we assume that the usual
rules of indices apply. If n is an integer then
(cos θ + j sin θ)n = (ejθ)n = ejnθ = cos nθ + j sin nθ
giving us De Moivre’s theorem for a positive integer:
If n is an integer, then
(cos θ + j sin θ)n = cos nθ + j sin nθ
Basically, this result is a generalization of the ‘add arguments to form product’ rule. As an
example we have (cos θ + j sin θ)2 = cos(θ + θ) + j sin(θ + θ) = cos 2θ + j sin 2θ. And
if you were misguided enough to repeat this multiplication a few times you would ﬁnd,
for example, that (cos θ + j sin θ)5 = cos 5θ + j sin 5θ. De Moivre’s theorem gives this
to us directly however.

12.8 De Moivre’s theorem for fractional powers
We have considered simple algebra of complex numbers – addition, subtraction, multipli-
cation and ‘division’. So far, apart from
√
−1 we have not however considered taking the
roots of a complex number. We don’t have to look far to see that this requires some care.
A few examples will help:
x2 = 1 implies
x = ±(1)
1
2 = ±
√
1 = ±1
since (−1)2 = 12 = 1. Two values, as we might expect.
What about x3 = 1? In this case 1 is again a root, 13 = 1, but −1 won’t do because
(−1)3 = −1 ̸= 1. We would in any case expect three values of the cube root, since we
expect three solutions to a cubic equation. In fact in this simple case we can actually ﬁnd
them by some algebra.
x3 −1 = (x −1)(x2 + x + 1) = 0
So
x = 1
or
x2 + x + 1 = 0
The latter equation gives two complex roots:
x = −1
2 ± j
√

So, in fact we do have three cube roots of +1:

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
but two of them are complex. The question is, how do we ﬁnd such roots in general?
Since the polar form is so useful in multiplication, and De Moivre’s theorem is useful in
raising to a power, we suspect that we can also use this form in taking roots. We can, but
there is a subtlety that takes some getting used to.
Consider the cube root 1

Applying De Moivre’s theorem as it would work for an integer gives

3 = ̸
1
30

= ̸ (0) = 1
i.e. it only gives us the root 1. But we have missed a trick, namely that because over
cos(θ + 2kπ) = cos θ and sin(θ + 2kπ) = sin θ for any integer k, we can always write
̸ (θ) = ̸ (θ + 2kπ)
k = any integer
as we noted in Section 12.3. That is, we can increase θ by any integer multiple of 2π, and
we won’t change ̸ (θ). Normally, we wouldn’t need to do this – we simply reproduce the
same values of ̸ (θ). However, when we take roots, the following happens:
(̸ (θ))

3 = (̸ (θ + 2kπ))

We see that k = 3 brings us back to where we started. You can soon convince yourself
that higher values of k simply reproduce the three roots in the order of k = 0, 1, 2.
So, we obtain all the different roots in polar form by ﬁrst generalising the angle θ to
θ + 2kπ, taking the root and then letting k take the appropriate number of values in turn,
usually commencing with k = 0. Problem 12.13 should now help you to appreciate the
general situation, which we now summarise.
We can obtain all q qth roots of cos θ + j sin θ by writing it in its most general form:
cos θ + j sin θ ≡cos(θ + 2kπ) + j sin(θ + 2kπ)
k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .
Then

and by letting k take any q consecutive values, for example, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . (q −1), we
obtain all of the q qth roots of cos θ + j sin θ.
The q qth roots of a complex number z = x + jy can be obtained by converting to
polar form and then using De Moivres theorem:

5. A typical sinusoidal function
x(t) = A sin(ωt + φ)
describing an oscillating signal with period 2π/ω, amplitude A and phase angle φ may
be represented, with the frequency ω understood, by a line of length A making angle

being the phasor of the signal x(t).

The phasor X of x(t) is then represented mathematically by a complex number of
magnitude A and argument φ:
X = a + jb = A cos φ + jA sin φ = Aeiφ

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
In terms of X we can write x(t) as:
x(t) = Im(Xejωt)
wherein lies the usefulness of phasors – the frequency behaviour of x(t) is sepa-
rated out.
Phasors representing sinusoids of the same frequency can be added and subtracted
by complex algebra. Thus, if the phasors X1 = A1ejφ1, X2 = A2ejφ2 represent signals
x1(t) = A1 sin(ωt + φ1), x2(t) = A2 sin(ωt + φ2) respectively then the phasor X1 + X2
represents the signal x1(t) + x2(t) and the phasor X1 −X2 represents the signal x1(t) −
x2(t).
1. Sketch and write down the phasors corresponding to the sinusoids 2 sin(ωt + π/4),

Matrices and Determinants
Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers treated as mathematical entities in themselves
and satisfying an algebra that suits their particular application. In this respect they are
similar to vectors (Chapter 11), but whereas vectors are designed to reﬂect the behaviour
of physical quantities that have a direction associated with them, matrices are designed
to enable us to handle systems of linear equations of the sort introduced in Section 2.2.4.
Matrices have simple rules of addition and multiplication, but are complicated to invert, for
which it is convenient to introduce certain numbers, called determinants, that are associated
with matrices. Determinants also help us to deﬁne the eigenvalue problem, which is one
of immense importance in engineering and science.
Prerequisites
It will be helpful if you know something about:
• solving simultaneous linear equations (48
➤
)
• the principles and practice of elementary algebra (Chapter 12
➤
)
• the sigma notation (102
➤
)
Objectives
In this chapter you will ﬁnd:
• deﬁnitions of matrices and determinants
• addition and subtraction of matrices
• multiplication of matrices
• zero and unit matrices
• properties of determinants
• the adjoint and inverse of a matrix
• Cramer’s rule for solving systems of linear equations
• eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Motivation
You may need the material of this chapter for:
• solving systems of linear equations
• frequency analysis of coupled engineering systems
• solving distribution and scheduling problems in operational research
• solving systems of differential equations

13.1 An overview of matrices and determinants
Everywhere in engineering and science we are constantly having to deal with situations
where there are many variables. Matrices provide the mathematical shorthand for dealing
with a number of quantities at the same time – basically a generalisation of vectors (indeed
the language is similar in the two topics). Matrices are used in modelling complex mechan-
ical systems, control systems, electronic circuits, optical systems, economic and ﬁnancial
systems, network problems, robotics, and much more besides.
A matrix is essentially a rectangular array of numbers, each independent from each
other – only their position in the array is signiﬁcant. In matrix algebra the array itself
is treated as a single mathematical object – just like a vector. Rules have been invented
for combining such arrays, much like the rules of arithmetic, but with some signiﬁcant
differences. Thus, matrices can be added and subtracted. They can also be multiplied,
but the commutative rule xy = yx no longer holds in general – if A, B are two matrices
then AB and BA are not necessarily the same thing. Matrices can also be ‘divided’,
but care is needed, as always with division. The rules of multiplication and division of
matrices are constructed so that we can use matrices in such things as solving systems of
equations.
Remember that in complex numbers we found it useful to introduce a real number – the
modulus, |z| – associated with a complex number, z, in order to deﬁne division by z. We
do a similar, but more general thing with matrices. Thus, a determinant is a number
associated with a given matrix or array. It is evaluated in a certain way from the elements
of the matrix and gives us useful information about it. Determinants enable us to deﬁne
a series of numbers associated with a (square) matrix, called its eigenvalues. These are
extremely important both mathematically and for applications. If for example the matrix
describes a particular control system then the eigenvalues of that matrix tell us important
things about the stability of the control system.
13.2 Deﬁnition of a matrix and its elements
Consider the system of equations
2x + y = 3
(13.1)
x −2y = −1
In a sense the important information here is the set of coefﬁcients, which we can arrange
in two arrays:
A =
 2
1
1
−2

b =

3
−1

Such arrays are called matrices. A is referred to as a 2 × 2 matrix, because it has two
rows and two columns. Similarly b is a 2 × 1 matrix, or column vector. The numbers
in the array are called its elements. Their positions are important, and note that signs
378

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
must be properly included. The elements can be complex numbers. What we want to do
is construct an ‘algebra’ for such arrays that enables us to treat A and b as much as
possible like ordinary algebraic objects. The system of equation (13.1) already suggests
some ideas here.
We put the quantities x, y in a 2 × 1 matrix of their own:
u =
 x
y

and write (13.1) as
 2
1
1
−2
  x
y

=

3
−1

or
Au = b
If this is to be a symbolic shorthand for (13.1) then this essentially deﬁnes the ‘product’
Au of the two matrices A and u. Have a go at determining the rule for multiplying matrices
yourself. The formal deﬁnition is given in Section 13.3
Problem 13.1
Write the system of equations
a Y 3b = 1
2a Y b = 0
in matrix form Au = b.
The arrays are:
A =

b =

a 2 × 2 matrix. Essentially we are treating each of the two columns in the second
factor as we did the single columns in (i) and (ii). Take care with the signs in these
calculations!
It is common to use the notation aij for the elements of a matrix, the subscripts i, j,
denoting the ith row and jth column. We now give the general deﬁnition of a matrix.
An mxn matrix A is an array of mn numbers with m rows and n columns denoted by:
A =


a11
a12
. . .
a1n
a21
a22
a2n
...
...
am1
am2
. . .
amn


The number
row
column
aij
is the ijth element of A, read as ‘a, i, j’
We sometimes write
A = [aij]
The case when the number of rows and columns is equal, i.e. m = n, is very important.
Such matrices are called square, and we will have a lot to say about them later on.
A matrix does not have a numerical value (whereas a determinant – see Section 13.4 –
does). Note that round brackets are sometimes used for matrices. This is not advised since
when handwritten such brackets can be confused with determinant lines.
We will see more on the algebra of matrices, but for now just note that:
Addition of matrices is associative:
A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C
and commutative:
A + B = B + A
380

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Multiplication of matrices, considered in Section 13.3, is associative:
A(BC) = (AB)C
but not commutative:
AB ̸= BA
We also deﬁne some special matrices:
Zero or null matrix – all elements zero. It satisﬁes the obvious rules A + 0 = A, 0A =
0, etc.
Unit matrix, I – all elements zero except for one’s on the leading diagonal. It must
therefore be a square matrix, and it satisﬁes
IA = AI ′ = A(I ′ and I may be different size)
for any matrix A.
Inverse matrix – if A is a square matrix then it may be possible to ﬁnd another matrix
A−1 such that:
AA−1 = A−1A = I
Such a matrix is called the inverse of A. We show how to evaluate the inverse matrix in
Section 13.6.
Transpose – the transpose of a matrix A, denoted AT is the matrix obtained by changing
the rows of A into columns, thus, if A is m × n, AT is n × m.

13.3 Adding and multiplying matrices
Two matrices are equal if and only if corresponding elements are identical. Formally, two
matrices are equal if and only if they are of the same size and the corresponding elements
381

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
are the same, i.e.
[bij] = [aij] if and only if bij = aij
for every value of i and j.
We add/subtract matrices by adding/subtracting corresponding elements. So we can
only add or subtract matrices of the same size:
[aij] ± [bij] = [aij ± bij]
Generalising the idea of repeated addition we can deﬁne multiplication of a matrix by a
scalar, k, according to:
k[aij] = [kaij]
i.e. we multiply each element by the scalar k. This is just like multiplication by a scalar
in vector algebra.

I think you will agree that most of the above is fairly sensible and you might expect
that an obvious generalisation of addition of matrices would be to deﬁne multiplication
of matrices as multiplying corresponding elements. However, this is not the most useful
deﬁnition. As noted above, we deﬁne multiplication to ﬁt in with the structure of linear
equations – ‘plugging rows into columns’. For this to be possible, without trying to ﬁt
a 3-pin plug into a 2-pin socket, for example, we can only form AB if A has the same
number of columns as B has rows. We then say A and B are conformable and we form the
product AB by multiplying each row of A into each column of B, multiplying elements in
pairs and adding up the results. The formal deﬁnition looks more fearsome than it actually
is – have a look at Problem 13.5 to make sense of it.
Thus let:
A = [aij]
(m × n)
B = [bij]
(n × r)
Then the elements of the product matrix:
C = AB = [cij]
(m × r)
are given by
cij =
n

k=1
aikbkj
383

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
That is, the element in the ith row and jth column of the product matrix C is obtained
from the ‘scalar’ product of the ith row of A with the jth column of B.
As an example:
A =
 a11

a21b11 + a22b21 + a23b31
a21b12 + a22b22 + a23b32

Note:
(i)
AB and BA need not be the same – in fact, they are only both deﬁned
if A is m × n and B is n × m (then AB is m × m and BA n × n)
(ii)
AB = 0 is possible even if both A and B have non zero elements.

13.4 Determinants
First, an admission. The full theory of determinants is conceptually quite straightforward,
but it is very intricate. I will not, therefore, be going into much depth, and I will ask you
to make a leap of faith on occasions. However, determinants have great theoretical impor-
tance – in deﬁning the inverse matrix, and in eigenvalue theory. It may appear therefore
that I am selling you short in skimming over determinants. However, in practice no one
uses determinants to invert matrices or ﬁnd eigenvalues for real problems – there are far
more effective means studied at more advanced level. Another point is that the deﬁnition
of a determinant appears a little complicated and so I’ll work up to it gently, so that you
can see where it comes from. To help you interpret the symbols, a numerical example is
done in parallel.
Consider
the
simple
system
of
equations:
a11x1 + a12x2 = b1
(i)
a21x1 + a22x2 = b2
(ii)
Multiply (i) by a21, (ii) by a11 and
subtract
(a11a22 −a21a12)x2 = a11b2 −a21b1
Problem 13.8
Solve the pair of equations
3x1 Y 2x2 = 1
.i/
x1 −2x2 = 2
.ii/
Multiply (i) by 1, (ii) by 3 and
subtract
(3 × (−2) −1 × 2)x2 = 3 × 2 −1 × 1
386

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
So
x2 = a11b2 −a21b1
a11a22 −a21a12
Similarly we ﬁnd
x1 = b1a22 −a12b2
a11a22 −a21a12
Introduce the notation (337
➤
)

a
b
c
d
 = ad −bc
then we can write
x1 =

b1

a21

a21
a22

So
x2 =
3 × 2 −1 × 1
3 × (−2) −1 × 2 = −5
8
Similarly we ﬁnd
x1 = 1(−2) −2 × 2
3(−2) −1 × 2 = 3
4
Introduce the notation

3
2
1
−2
 = 3(−2) −1 × 2
then we can write

Notice the patterns in the last steps:
(i) The denominator is the same for x1 and x2 and clearly obtained from the coefﬁcients
of the left-hand side of the equations.
(ii) The numerator for x1 is given by replacing the x1 column of the array of coefﬁcients
by the right-hand side column of b’s. Similarly, the numerator for x2 is obtained by
replacing the x2 column by the right-hand side column.
This rule, capitalising on the notation introduced, is called Cramer’s rule – we will
say more on this in Section 13.5.
The quantity

 is called a 2 × 2 or second order determinant. It can be thought
of as associated with the matrix

. We denote the determinant of a matrix A by |A|
or det(A). By solving systems of 3, 4, . . . equations, we are led to deﬁnitions of 3, 4, . . .

order determinants to ﬁt in with the above pattern. The simplest way to deﬁne these
higher order determinants is in terms of second order determinants. Thus, we deﬁne a
3 × 3 determinant by:

+ a13a21a32 −a13a22a31
The elements of the ﬁrst row are multiplied by the determinant obtained by crossing out
the row and column of the element, with an alternating sign. This is called the expansion
of the determinant by the ﬁrst row. In fact, one can expand by any row or column and
we now show how to do this for general order determinants. Let
n =

be a general nth order determinant. Choose any element aij. The cofactor of aij, denoted
Aij, is the (n −1)th order determinant (−1)i+jDij where Dij is the determinant obtained
by deleting the i row and j column of n (Dij is called the minor of aij).
Then the general nth order determinant can be expressed in terms of (n −1)th order
determinants (and hence in terms of (n −2)th order, etc., down to second order) by an
expansion in the cofactors of any row or column. For example, for expansion of n by
the ﬁrst row we have
n = a11A11 + a12A12 + a13A13 + . . . + a1nA1n
Take the 3 × 3 case as an example:
3 =

a11
a12
a13
a21
a22
a23
a31
a32
a33

The cofactors of the second row are
A21 = (−1)2+1

a12
a13
a32
a33

A22 = (−1)2+2

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

M a t h e m a t i c s
A23 = (−1)2+3

a11
a12
a31
a32

Then we can easily check that
3 = a21A21 + a22A22 + a23A23
Similarly, we can check that

(expansion by the third column).
You may have spotted that the example equations in Problem 13.8 can be solved much
more simply than by employing determinants. Adding them gives
4x1 = 3
yielding x1 immediately and then x2 can be obtained from one of the equations. So
this already appears to be a sledgehammer to crack a nut – why bother with determi-
nants at all? Because they provide a systematic, ‘easily’ remembered, and automatic
means of writing down the solution of any system of linear equations no matter how
complicated. The determinantal form does not depend on accidental properties of the
coefﬁcients.

Note that the ﬁnal determinant is zero because the two rows (or columns) are proportional

Above we have both deﬁned determinants and given a method for evaluating them. We
now need their properties. These are best illustrated using 2 × 2 examples.
(i) A determinant and its transpose (i.e. the determinant obtained from it by
transposing rows into columns – cf: transpose of a matrix (381
➤
)) have the same
value.
(ii) Interchanging two rows or two columns changes the sign of the determinant.

(iii) If two rows or two columns are identical the determinant is zero (follows from (ii)).
(iv) Any factors common to a row (column) may be factored out from the determinant.
(v) A row may be increased or decreased by equal multiples of another row (similarly,
for columns) without changing the determinant.
(vi) A determinant in which a row or a column consists of the sum or difference of two or
more terms, may be expanded as the sum or difference of two or more determinants.
(vii) The determinant of the product of two (square) matrices is the product of the deter-
minants of the factors.

13.5 Cramer’s rule for solving a system of linear
equations
We will now show how to generalise the 2 × 2 version of Cramer’s rule given in
Section 13.4 by looking at the case of three equations in three unknowns.
a11x1 + a12x2 + a13x3 = b1
a23x1 + a22x2 + a23x3 = b2
a31x1 + a32x2 + a33x3 = b3
If we solve this system by elimination then it is found (believe me!) that the solution can
be expressed in a simple determinant form that generalises the 2 × 2 case of Section 13.4.
This is Cramer’s rule. Cramer’s rule gives the solution in terms of 3 × 3 determinants as:
x1 =

Again, note the pattern – denominators are always the same and equal to the determinant
of the coefﬁcients, . The numerator of xi is obtained by replacing the column of xi
coefﬁcients in  by the column of right-hand sides.

Note that in the case when at least one of the values bi is non-zero the system of equations
only has a unique solution if the determinant of coefﬁcients  is non-zero. This provides
a simple test for the consistency of a system. If all bi are zero we say that the system is
homogeneous. In this case, if the determinant of coefﬁcients is non-zero then we simply
get a zero solution for all the variables – the so-called ‘trivial solution’. On the other hand,
if the determinant of coefﬁcients is zero then we get an indeterminate result 0
0. In this case
it may be possible to get non-zero solutions for some or all of the variables. We consider
homogeneous systems further in Section 13.7.
Geometrically, an equation of the form
ax + by + cz = d
represents a plane in three dimensions (340
➤
). Three equations of this form would
therefore be expected to yield the intersection of three planes and usually this would be
a single unique point corresponding to the unique solution of the system. However, there
are some exceptional cases:
(i) 2 or 3 of the planes parallel, in which case the determinant of coefﬁcients  = 0 and
x, y, z are not uniquely deﬁned.
(ii) 3 planes coincide or have a line in common in which case we again have  = 0, the
numerators for x, y, z, are all zero, and in this case there are an inﬁnite number of
solutions.

13.6 The inverse matrix
Before deﬁning the inverse matrix A−1 of a square matrix A we deﬁne another matrix,
AdjA, associated with A. The deﬁnition seems a bit strange, but all will be revealed
shortly. The adjoint of a square matrix A, denoted by AdjA, is the transpose of the matrix
in which each element of A is replaced by its corresponding cofactors. Try the problem
quickly to get a proper grasp of this!

Before pressing on to the inverse matrix, let’s think about why we might need it and
what it might look like. Remember that we introduced the idea of a matrix so that we
could write a system of equations in the single form
Au = b
This is of little use unless we can push the new notation to help us to solve such a system.
Think of a simple equation
3x = 6
Of course, the solution is x = 2. But, spelling out the details, we ﬁrst multiply by
1/3 = 3−1,
3−1(3x) = (3−13)x = 1x
= x = 3−16 = 2
In order to repeat this for the matrix equation we need A−1, the equivalent of 3−1. This
motivates the following deﬁnition.
The inverse, A−1, of a square matrix A is deﬁned by
A−1A = I = AA−1
where I is the appropriate unit matrix. The inverse of a matrix exists only if the matrix is
non-singular (i.e. its determinant is non-zero). This follows because, since the determinant
of a product is the product of the determinants (390
➤
):
|A−1A| = |A−1||A| = |I | = 1
and so we must have |A| ̸= 0. Also, from this equation follows:
|A−1| = 1/|A| = |A|−1
So
det(A−1) = [det(A)]−1
In Problem 13.12 above we saw that
AAdjA = −I = |A|I
This is, in fact, a general result and leads to the following expression for A−1:
A−1 = AdjA
|A|
Note that in ﬁnding the inverse matrix it is wise to calculate |A| ﬁrst, because if this is
zero, the inverse does not exist and it is a waste of time ﬁnding AdjA.

Exercise on 13.6
Where possible, solve the systems of Exercise 13.5 using the inverse matrix.
Answer
See answer to Exercise 13.5.
13.7 Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
Consider the system of equations
3x + 2y = 0
6x + 4y = 0
Note that the determinant of coefﬁcients of the left-hand side is

3
2
6
4
 = 0
If either of the right-hand sides was non-zero this would mean the system has no solution.
However, when the right-hand sides are all zero, we say the system is homogeneous, and
in this case there is the possibility of a solution. In fact, cancelling 2 from the second
equation reveals that the equations are the same – we really only have one equation:
3x + 2y = 0
This has an inﬁnite number of solutions – choose any value of y, y = s, then take x as
−2
3s.
In fact, in the homogeneous case it is essential for a non-trivial solution that the
determinant of the coefﬁcients is zero. We can generalise this. Returning to the original
motivation for the inverse matrix, remember that we wanted to solve
Au = b
by multiplying by A−1:
A−1(Au) = (A−1A)u = Iu = u
= A−1b.
So we have to insist in this case on |A| ̸= 0, if b ̸= 0. On the other hand, if b = 0, and
we have the homogeneous system
Au = 0
then if A is non-singular we only get the trivial solution u = 0. It is called trivial because
if it were, say, to correspond to a physical dynamical system then it would represent
the state of zero motion – no activity. In the case of homogeneous systems, we only get
397

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
non-trivial solutions if |A| = 0. All this would be of little interest were it not for the
fact that homogeneous systems are very important, especially in engineering mathematics.
When a complicated structure such as an aircraft wing is being studied to examine the
kinds of vibrations it might experience it turns out that the mathematical modelling relies
heavily on homogeneous systems of equations of a particular type that leads to quantities
called eigenvalues. These quantities are actually related to the frequencies of vibrations
of the various components of the aircraft wing, so their importance is obvious. They
have countless other applications too, but here we will concentrate on their mathematical
signiﬁcance and properties. Once again, the deﬁnitions may be a little complicated and
you may have to take a few things on trust, but the results are worth it, and the technical
manipulations involved are really not that difﬁcult.
Eigenvalues are numerical quantities related to the determinant of a certain type of
square matrix. They arise in, for example, vibrating systems because the mathematical
models used involve systems of equations that take the matrix form
Au = λu
Here A is some square matrix describing the system, λ (Greek, l, ‘lambda’ – the stan-
dard notation for eigenvalues) is some parameter depending on the characteristics of the
vibrating system and u is some ‘solution vector’ that might, for example, represent the
displacements of the vibrating components being modelled. Now this system of equations
is a particular example of a homogeneous system of the form
(A −λI )u = 0
where I is a unit matrix of the same size as A. It will therefore only have a non-trivial solu-
tion for u if the determinant of coefﬁcients is zero, which gives the eigenvalue equation
|A −λI | = 0
This is in fact a polynomial equation for λ. For a given matrix A only certain values of
λ will satisfy this equation, and only for these ‘eigenvalues’ will the original equation for
u have a non-trivial solution. Such non-trivial solutions for u are called the eigenvectors
corresponding to the eigenvalues λ.
The above is a lot to take in but the objective is to motivate the rather strange deﬁnitions
we are introducing. The mechanics of the actual mathematical manipulations are, as noted
above, not too bad. Try the problem quickly!

where u is an arbitrary number, roughly analogous to the arbitrary constant in inte-
gration – we choose it to suit our purposes, usually to give a column vector with unit
magnitude (the magnitude of a column vector, like that of a vector (331
➤
), is the square
root of the sum of the squares of its components – if that puts you in mind of Pythagoras
again then so it should, the magnitude of a column vector is in a sense the ‘length’ of
a vector it might represent). In the above case choosing u to make u of unit magnitude

Hopefully, you will agree that actually ﬁnding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors is relatively
routine – in this case simply expanding a determinant and solving a quadratic equation,
then solving a system of linear equations. In real engineering problems one might have
hundreds of components or degrees of freedom, resulting in matrices with thousands of
entries, and things are then not so simple – we have no hope of expanding the corre-
sponding determinants or solving the resulting equations so easily. In such cases we have
to resort to completely different (numerical) methods for ﬁnding eigenvalues – but the
basic principles are still the same.

13.9 Applications
1. A standard example in which systems of linear equations in more than one unknown
arise is that of the modelling of electrical circuits or networks. A system of elec-
trical components and connections might be very complicated, but can be analysed by
regarding it as comprised of simple loops and branches to which Kirchoff’s Laws can
be applied. A typical problem might be to determine the current in some part of a
circuit given the resistances, emfs, etc. in the network components. Such a problem
resulted in the following system of equations for currents i1, i2, i3 (amps) in a network:
i1 + i2 + i3 = 0
−8i2 + 10i3 = 0
4i1 −8i2 = 6
Solve the system for i1, i2, i3 by (i) Cramer’s rule (ii) matrix inversion.
Notes:
• For practical circuits of any size some standard software package would be used,
probably involving numerical methods.
• Useful mathematical analysis of the network can be done prior to solution, using the
techniques of graph theory, to optimise the solution process
• Cramer’s rule and matrix inversion are essentially equivalent.

2. Systems of forces acting on a body in equilibrium can also lead to systems of linear
equations. For example, resolution of forces and balancing of moments leads to the
following equations for three forces F1, F2, F3 (Newtons) acting on one of the struts
in an aircraft wing.
F1 −F2 = 0
2F1 + F2 −2F3 = 20
F2 −F3 = 4
Find the forces by (i) Cramer’s rule (ii) matrix inversion.
3. The simple harmonic oscillator
The position, x, of a particle performing simple harmonic motion about the origin at a
time t can be described through Newton’s laws of motion by the differential equation:
d2x
dt2 + ω2x = 0
where ω2 is a positive quantity. It is standard practice to introduce a new variable:
dx
dt = y
to give the second order system:
dx
dt = y
dy
dt = −ω2x
which may be written, in matrix form as,
d
dt x =

0
1
−ω2
0

x
x =
 x
y

= Ax
For various reasons arising from the theory of differential equations (Chapter 15) we
now try to solve such systems by assuming solutions of the form
x = x0eλt
y = y0eλt
where λ is some constant to be determined, and x0, y0 will depend on the initial
conditions. Substituting in the equations gives the matrix form

y0


404

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
We only get non-trivial values for (x0, y0) if the determinant of coefﬁcients is zero:

This is precisely the eigenvalue equation for the matrix of coefﬁcients of the original
system:
A =

0
1
−ω2
0

Convert the equation
d2x
dt2 + 4x = 0
to a ﬁrst order system as described above.
Try a solution of the form x = x0eλt, y = y0eλt in this system and ﬁnd the possible
values of λ that will yield a non-trivial solution – they will in fact be complex. Hence
solve the equations and express the solutions without complex numbers.

Analysis for Engineers – Limits,
Sequences, Iteration, Series
and All That
The topics considered in this chapter are often regarded as something of a luxury for
engineers and scientists, who are normally more concerned with using techniques rather
than worrying too much about the underlying theory. However, the ideas are not really
that difﬁcult, and there are in fact many engineering situations where it is necessary
to pay particular attention to things such as continuity and differentiability. Also, even
though some of the techniques may not be of immediate practical use, they are important
in applications of numerical methods in engineering. Thus, before engaging in costly
computational approaches, it is important to check that the problem is mathematically well
deﬁned. Does a ‘solution’ exist? Is it unique? Will the computational scheme converge
to it? How long will it take? What are the error bounds? . . . etc. These are the sorts of
questions that analysis addresses.
Prerequisites
It will be helpful if you know something about:
• different types of number (5

14.1 Continuity and irrational numbers
What do we mean by a ‘continuous curve’? Plotting the result of an experiment on a graph
will lead to a series of points separated by gaps (which may be small, but will always be
there). We can never plot a continuous curve, although we usually draw one through the
points. In fact, the idea of a continuous curve is a convenient mathematical abstraction
which allows us to use geometry to talk about slopes and rates of change. When we draw a
continuous curve we tacitly assume that the curve passes through every point on it (which
it doesn’t – there will at least be gaps between the molecules in the chemicals of the ink!).
To plot a point on a curve we must measure its distance from some origin. This can
only be done to a certain level of accuracy and so can only be done using a terminating
decimal, e.g. 3.412. As noted in Chapter 1 such numbers can always be written as rational
numbers – those which can be expressed in the form m/n where m and n are integers.
Problem 14.1
Write the decimal 3.412 as a rational number.
Quite simply in this case we have
3.412 = 3412
1000
However, there are numbers which cannot be written in this form as fractions – i.e. there
exist quantities which we can never measure exactly and yet which do have a real exist-
ence! These can never be plotted on a graph and so represent ‘holes’ in the apparently
continuous curve. An elementary example of such a number is the diagonal of the unit
square. By Pythagoras’ theorem (154
➤
) we know that the unit square has diagonal
√
2 units. Clearly, this number ‘exists’, otherwise we couldn’t cross a square diagonally.

E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
However, we will show that it cannot in fact be represented by a decimal with a ﬁnite
number of places – i.e. it is not a rational number, and so therefore it cannot be ‘measured’
or ‘plotted’ exactly. The method of proof is by contradiction, that is, we assume that
√
2
can be written as a rational number and then derive a contradiction. The proof is one of
the prettiest in elementary pure mathematics and it has great physical signiﬁcance, demon-
strating that there is a real physical quantity of great importance that we cannot actually
measure. It also gives good practice in elementary algebra, so try to work through it.
Assume that we can write
√
2 as a rational number:
√
2 = m
n
where m, n are integers, each cancelled down to their lowest form (i.e. m and n have no
factors in common (12
➤
)). Then
2 = m2
n2
or
m2 = 2n2
This implies that m2 is even. Since the square of an odd number is odd m must also be
even. Let’s write it m = 2k where k is an integer. Then:
m2 = 4k2 = 2n2
or
n2 = 2k2
By the same argument as for m, this implies that n is even.
We have therefore shown that both m and n are even and therefore contain (at least) the
factor 2 in common. This is a contradiction since we assumed that m and n have no factors
in common. So we have to conclude that
√
2 cannot be written as a rational number.
Numbers such as
√
2, which cannot be written in the form m/n, are called irrational
numbers. They are clearly of more than academic interest because we cannot draw a
continuous curve without them. So, if we deﬁnitely cannot plot all points on a continuous
curve, how do we deﬁne such a curve mathematically? To deﬁne continuity precisely
we have to introduce the idea of a limit of a function at a point. This is the value of
the function as we approach closer and closer to the point indeﬁnitely, without actually
reaching the point. It might or might not exist.

2 = 1.41421356237. My calculator squares this to 1.9999999998,

14.2 Limits
Suppose we are trying to ﬁnd the velocity of a particle at a time t. As velocity is distance
moved divided by time taken we have to measure a small distance moved and divide by
the time taken for this. But this will only give us the average velocity over this small
interval. Actually, at the point t there is zero movement in zero time – is the velocity 0/0?
Remember that in Chapter 1 we said this is not deﬁned (7
➤
). The way out of this is to
consider smaller and smaller intervals and ﬁnd the average velocity over these intervals. As
the interval decreases, the average velocity over it should be nearer to the actual velocity
at t. We say that we ﬁnd the limit of the velocity as the interval goes to zero. Notice
that we never actually evaluate the velocity at the point t – because this just gives 0/0,
as seen above – we just get nearer and nearer to it without actually reaching it. This is
formalised in the following deﬁnition.
The limit of f .x/ as x tends to a is deﬁned as the value of f (x) as x approaches
closer and closer to a without actually reaching it and is denoted by:
lim
x→a f (x)
There are some points to note:
(i)
We do not evaluate the limit by actually substituting x = a in f (x)
in general, although in some simple cases it is possible.
(ii)
The value of the limit can depend on ‘which side it is ap-
proached’ – from ‘above’ or ‘below’, i.e. through values of x less
than a or through values of x greater than a respectively. The two
possible values may not be the same – in which case the limit does
not exist.
(iii)
The limit may not exist at all – and even if it does it may not be
equal to f (a).
The sort of limits that cause most difﬁculty and which are probably the most important
are those arising from so called ‘indeterminate forms’. Any expression that yields results
of the form 0/0, ∞/∞, or 0 × ∞is called an indeterminate form. Examples are
x2 −1
x −1 = 0
0 at x = 1
and
sin x
x
= 0
0 at x = 0
Even though the function does not exist at such points, its limit at the point may exist.
For example as we will see below,
lim
x→1
x2 −1
x −1

and
lim
x→0
sin x

both exist.

Problem 14.2
Evaluate f .x/ = x2 Y 2x Y 3 for x = 1.1, 1.01, 1.001, 1.0001. What do you

We obtain the values in the table below

6.00040001
So as x gets closer and closer to 1, f (x) gets closer and closer to 6 – we say that the limit
as x tends to 1 is 6. Similar results are obtained if we consider values of x less than and
increasingly closer to 1. The results get increasingly closer to 6. This is also the value of
f (x) at x = 1 of course. Graphically, the situation is illustrated in Figure 14.1.

The table of values suggests that as x →1, f (x) →2 (the arrow represents ‘tends to’).
However, of course,
f (1) = 12 −1
1 −1 = 0
0
which is indeterminate indicating that in this case we cannot evaluate the limit simply
by substituting the value of x = 1. Instead, we proceed as follows:
lim
x→1
x2 −1
x −1 = lim
x→1
(x −1)(x + 1)
(x −1)
= lim
x→1(x + 1) = 2
The cancellation of the x −1 factor under the limit is permissible because in the limit we
only consider values of x arbitrarily close but never equal to 1. So x −1 is never zero
and so can be cancelled under the limit. See Figure 14.2.

14.3 Some important limits
There are further examples of limits that are very important in calculus and approximations.
If you wish, simply remember the results and how to use them, but working through
the proofs will give you good practice in basic mathematics as well as enhancing your
understanding of the results.
(i) lim

= 1
When θ = 0 this yields the indeterminate form 0/0.

Figure 14.4
From Figure 14.4 we see that if P A is an arc of a unit circle subtending an angle θ
at the centre (173
➤
), then we have:
P B
1
= sin θ
and P A = 1 × θ (rads).
So sin θ
θ
= P B
P A and clearly as θ →0, P B →P A, so sin θ
θ
→1
Thus we obtain the given result. This limit implies that for θ small we have sin θ ≃θ.
The same sort of reasoning can also be used to show that for very small θ, cos θ ≃1.
It is also useful to note that provided k ̸= 0,
lim
θ→0
sin kθ
kθ
= 1
So, for example
lim
θ→0
sin 6θ
6θ
= 1
Once again, remember that in all of this discussion, and in use of the limits deﬁned,
q must be in radians.

14.4 Continuity
We can now use the idea of a limit to put the concept of continuity into mathematical
form. If we focus on a particular point x = a on the curve of a function f (x), then clearly
if the curve is continuous at that point then we would want the limit at x = a to be the
same ‘from both sides’ and to be equal to f (a). Only in this way can the two parts of the
curve on either side of x = a ‘join up’ without leaving a hole in the curve. We express
this formally in the following deﬁnition:
A function f (x) is continuous at x = a if limx→a f (x) = f (a).
The graphs of continuous functions are continuous curves, and some examples of contin-
uous and discontinuous curves are illustrated in Figure 14.5.

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
A function f (x) such that
lim
x→a f (x) ̸= f (a)
is said to be discontinuous at x = a.
For example, f (x) =
x + 3
(x −1)(x + 5) is discontinuous at x = 1 and x = −5. Another
example of a discontinuous function is the tan x function (see Figure 6.10).
In general, discontinuous functions are a nuisance in mathematics, but various tech-
niques have been devised to deal with them. They are sometimes useful to approxi-
mate rapid continuous variations, as for example the use of the step function, H(t) = 0
for t < 0 and = 1 for t > 0, in representing the ‘instantaneous’ throwing of a switch
(Figure 14.6).
H (t )
t
0
Figure 14.6 The step function H(t).
Although we have used limits to deﬁne continuity, in practice we often know that a
given function f (x) is continuous, and then we can simply put x = a to ﬁnd the ‘limit’
or value of f (x) at x = a. For example, the general rational function P (x)/Q(x) can
only have discontinuities where Q(x) = 0 and these are inﬁnite if P (x) is non-zero. If
however, at x = a, P (a) = Q(a) = 0, then we have an indeterminate form 0/0 (the same
discussion applies for ∞/∞) and a more detailed study is required. This can take the form
of a substitution such as z = a + h and studying the limit as h →0. This is equivalent
to focusing attention on the point x = a and looking closely at the behaviour near this
point. We can perform any algebraic operations on P (x)/Q(x) to simplify it, or rearrange
it to a more convenient form for taking the limit – we can for example, cancel factors like
x −a, because we never actually consider what happens at x = a. Another approach is to
expand the function in a power series. In fact our main concern with limits and continuity
lies in the theory of differentiation, where we need to consider indeterminate expressions
such as 0/0.
Problem 14.6
Investigate the continuity of the function
f .x/ =
x −3

E n g i n e e r i n g

This is a rather sophisticated problem, but is worth working through because it brings
together a number of the key subtleties of limits and continuity, and is very instructive.
We have
f (x) =
x −3
x2 −4x + 3 =
x −3
(x −3)(x −1)
This has two discontinuities, at x = 1 and x = 3. At x = 3 the function is indeterminate,
but otherwise we can cancel the x −3 and write
f (x) =
1
x −1 provided x ̸= 3
At x = 1 the discontinuity is inﬁnite, of the same kind as that of 1/x at x = 0 (cf:
Problem 14.4), except that the point x = 3 must be omitted, see Figure 14.7.

The slope of a curve at a point is deﬁned as the slope of the tangent at that point. It can be

14.6 Introduction to inﬁnite series
The purpose of this section is to ease you gently into the topic of inﬁnite series, before we
embark on a more formal treatment. How would you evaluate cos x for x = 0.1 radians?
Probably tap it out on your calculator. But suppose you wanted greater accuracy than your
calculator can give? Writing a short computer programme might be the answer. But how do
you instruct the computer? You can’t tell it to evaluate cos x from its geometrical deﬁnition
‘adjacent over hypotenuse’. The logic circuits of computers can only do very simple
422

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication. Fortunately, we can express
cos x (x in radians!) in terms of just such operations by an inﬁnite power series (107
➤
):
cos x = 1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −x6
6! + · · ·
If this is new to you, don’t worry where it comes from just now. Because the series is
inﬁnite – the terms go on forever – we can’t even total all of the terms and so can never
write down the exact value of, for example, cos 0.1:
cos 0.1 = 1 −(0.1)2
2!
+ (0.1)4
4!
−(0.1)6
6!
+ · · ·
However, by taking a sufﬁcient number of terms we can obtain the value of cos 0.1 with
as much accuracy as we desire. The terms in the series only involve multiplication and
division, which a computer can do easily. So such series are just the thing for evaluating
complicated functions. They are also useful in mathematical methods too – for example
if x is small enough then we might be able to neglect terms such as x4, x6, . . . and take
the approximation:
cos x ≃1 −x2
2
The advantage here is that the right-hand side is much easier to work with than the
left-hand side.
We will look at how we ﬁnd such series later, in Section 14.11. Here we will focus on
issues arising from the fact that we have an inﬁnite series. Because it is inﬁnite, we can
never see directly what is going to happen when we ‘gather up’ all the terms. For the cos x
example above, the terms (0.1)r
r!
got smaller and smaller, so maybe we can feel conﬁdent
that we are all right to neglect the remaining inﬁnity of terms after we cut the series off.
Well, look at another series,
S = 1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 + · · ·
The terms get smaller and smaller – maybe we can get a good approximation by ‘trun-
cating’ the series? In fact, we can’t. This can be seen by a very pretty argument. Because S
is the sum of only positive terms, we can obviously get a quantity less than S by replacing
some of its terms by smaller values. Suppose we did this as follows
S > 1 + 1
2 +
 1
4 + 1
4
 +
 1
8 + 1
8 + 1
8 + 1
8
 + · · ·
You can see the pattern:
= 1 + 1
2 + 1
2 + 1
2 + · · ·
But this clearly adds up to an inﬁnite total and yet we know by construction that this is
less than S – so S must also be inﬁnite, showing that the series diverges.
This is typical of the sort of ‘strange’ results and pretty arguments one meets in the
theory of series. From a practical point of view it means we have to be very careful when
dealing with inﬁnite series.

14.7 Inﬁnite sequences
As a prelude to inﬁnite series we look at inﬁnite sequences (102
➤
), which are simply lists
that continue indeﬁnitely – adding terms of an inﬁnite sequence produces an inﬁnite series.
Such sequences arise naturally in such inﬁnite processes as iteration, where we continually
improve
an
approximation
by
recycling
it
until
we
get
the
accuracy
we want.
An ordered set of numbers:
u1, u2, u3, . . . , un, . . .
is called a sequence or inﬁnite sequence. un is called the nth term (105
➤
). The nth
term may be deﬁned by a formula:
un = f (n)
or by a recurrence relation (difference equation), such as:
un = un−1 + un−2
u1 = a,
u2 = b
Problem 14.8
Write down an expression or a recurrence relation for the nth term un in
each of the following cases:
(i)
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, . . .
(ii)
1, 1
2!, 1
3!, 1
4!, 1
5!, . . . .
(iii)
1, 4, 7, 10, . . .
(iv)
2, 4, 10, 24, 58 . . .
This is really a matter of educated guesswork – ﬁnd a result that ﬁts the ﬁrst few terms
of the sequence, check that it holds for the other terms and assume that it holds in general
for all terms, even those that are not explicitly written down.
(i)
We note that the terms can be written as 12, 22, 32, 42, 52, . . . which
suggests that in general we can take
un = n2
(ii)
The same idea suggests un = 1
n! in this case.
424

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(iii)
In this case un = 1 + (n −1)3 is pretty obvious.
(iv)
In this case it is perhaps not quite so easy to spot a pattern for an
explicit expression for un. You might spot more easily that there is a
relation between un and un−1, un−2. Explicitly we ﬁnd the recurrence
relation un = 2un−1 + un−2; u1 = 2, u2 = 4.
In case you are wondering what the explicit expression for un would be in (iv) that is
equivalent to the recurrence relation, it is actually
un =
1
√
2
(1 +
√
2)n −1
√
2
(1 −
√
2)n
Not something that readily springs to mind, as do (i) – (iii)! This illustrates why recurrence
relations are sometimes to be preferred. As a useful exercise in surds you might like to
check that this explicit result does generate the given sequence. Also, you may like to
check, using the binomial expansion that an equivalent form to the above result, not
involving surds, is
un =
n

r=1
Cr2(r+1)/2
where the sum ranges only over odd values of r. Again, not a form that springs imme-
diately to mind!
An obvious question is, as we continue along an inﬁnite sequence, does the nth term
tend to a deﬁnite limit? That is, what is the behaviour of un as n →∞? Symbolically,
what is limn→∞un? Clearly this depends on the form of the nth term.
Problem 14.9
Examine the limits of the following sequences as n increases indeﬁnitely:
(i)

n = 0

In this case we have limn→∞un = limn→∞

If a sequence has a ﬁnite limit, we say it converges, if not, it diverges. Graphi-
cally, a sequence converges if the points plotted for values of n approach a deﬁnite line
(Figure 14.9).
Note that the behaviour of the sequence depends not at all on the ﬁrst terms of the
sequence, but rather on the ‘inﬁnite tail’ – i.e. on the last inﬁnity of terms!

14.8 Iteration
One of the most important practical applications of the theory of sequences is in the discus-
sion of iterative methods used for example in numerical methods for solving equations. In
an iterative method for solving an equation we assume an initial guess and use it in some
rearrangement of the equation to calculate a (hopefully) improved approximation to the
solution. We will describe two methods for this, but mainly as examples of convergence
of sequences.
One way of ﬁnding an approximate solution to the equation
f (x) = 0
is to write it in the form
f (x) ≡F(x) −x = 0
and solve this equation by iteration:
xn+1 = F(xn)
426

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
where xn is the nth approximation. Starting with a ﬁrst approximation x1 we ﬁnd
another by:
x2 = F(x1)
and another
x3 = F(x2)
and so on.
This generates a sequence of approximate solutions:
x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn, . . .
and under favourable circumstances the limit of this sequence is the solution of the equa-
tion. To get a good enough approximation we then take n large enough. Clearly, whether
this is possible will depend on the form of the function F.
Perhaps the most popular iteration method is Newton’s method. In this method the
(n + 1)th approximation, xn+1, to the solution of an equation f (x) = 0 is calculated from
the nth approximation xn, subject to certain conditions, using the relation
xn+1 = xn −f (xn)
f ′(xn)
Again we generate an inﬁnite sequence of approximate solutions that (we hope) will
eventually converge on the actual solution.
Exercise on 14.8
Rewriting the equation x3 −5x −3 = 0 in the form
x = 1
5(x3 −3)
and starting with the value x0 = −1, use your calculator to generate a sequence of approx-
imate solutions to the equation. Do you think this sequence converges to a solution ? What
happens if you try x0 = −2?
Now rewrite the equation in the form
x = 5x + 3
x2
and again start with x0 = −2. What happens?
Answer
Starting with x0 = −1 the ﬁrst rearrangement leads quickly to the approximation x =
−0.657. Starting with x0 = −2 leads to a divergent sequence and no solution. Starting with
x0 = −2 in the second rearrangement however leads quickly to an approximate solution
x = −1.83. Note that some other starting values x0 might not lead to a root at all.

14.9 Inﬁnite series
An inﬁnite series (105
➤
) is one of the form
S = u1 + u2 + u3 + · · · + un + · · ·
i.e. the sum of the terms of an inﬁnite sequence. To consider the convergence of such a
series, i.e. whether it adds up to a ﬁnite quantity, we introduce some deﬁnitions. Firstly,
we pretend that the series is ﬁnite and deﬁne the nth partial sum of the series as the sum
of the ﬁrst n terms:
Sn = sum to n terms = u1 + u2 + u3 + · · · + un
Then the inﬁnite series can be regarded as this nth partial sum as n tends to inﬁnity, i.e.
S = sum to inﬁnity = lim
n→∞Sn
If S = limn→∞Sn = l, a deﬁnite value, then we say that the series converges to the value l.
Otherwise the series is divergent.
In terms of sigma notation (102
➤
) we write:
Sn =
n

r=1
ur
S =
∞

r=1
ur
Clearly, whether or not a series converges depends on the terms ur and also on their
relation to each other – i.e. on ur/ur−1. This last quantity appears in the ratio test for
convergence.
One way of testing for convergence, of course, is to investigate the limit of the nth
partial sum directly.
Problem 14.10
Investigate the convergence of the geometric series
S = a Y ar Y ar2 Y · · · Y arn−1 Y · · ·
(105
➤
)
We looked at this in Section 3.2.10. We have
Sn = a + ar + ar2 + · · · + arn−1
= a(1 −rn)
1 −r
( Section 3.2.9)
=

a


rn
428

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Now, provided −1 < r < 1 we have rn →0 as n →∞, so
lim
n→∞Sn =
a
1 −r
Thus, the sum to inﬁnity of the geometric series is
S =
a
1 −r
provide |r| < 1. On the other hand, if |r| ≥1 then rn →∞as n →∞and so the series
diverges.
Problem 14.11
Show that the inﬁnite arithmetic series
S = a Y .a Y d/ Y .a Y 2d/ · · ·
diverges for any value of the common difference d (104 ➤).
Again, we found in Section 3.2.9 that
Sn = a + (a + d) + (a + 2d) + · · · + (a + (n −1)d)
= 1
2n(2a + (n −1)d)
Now, as n →∞, Sn →∞, whatever the value of d, so
lim
n→∞Sn = ∞
and therefore the arithmetic series diverges.
It is not always possible to use the nth partial sum in this way. For example the nth
partial sum of the harmonic series
S = 1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 + · · · + 1
n + · · ·
is
Sn = 1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + · · · + 1
n
In this case there is no simple formula for Sn, and so we have to ﬁnd other ways to test
convergence. We did actually do this in Section 14.6 where it was shown that the harmonic
series diverges. We will look at other tests of convergence in the next section.

14.10 Tests for convergence
As noted in the previous section, if we can calculate the general form for Sn then we can
ﬁnd limn→∞Sn and check convergence directly, but this is not always possible. Fortunately,
a number of different tests have been developed to determine whether a series converges
by considering its general form.
Before we even start to discuss the convergence of a series, we must ﬁrst check that
limn→∞un = 0, because if this is not so then the series cannot converge. To see this
suppose that the series converges. Then from:
un = Sn −Sn−1
we have
lim
n→∞(Sn −Sn−1) = 0 = lim
n→∞un
So, if the series converges, limn→∞un = 0. However, the converse is not true,
i.e. limn→∞un = 0, does not imply that the series converges. Thus, we saw in
Section 14.6 that the harmonic series actually diverges and yet it clearly satisﬁes
limn→∞un = limn→∞
1
n = 0. On the other hand, for the arithmetic series (Problem 14.11)
limn→∞un = ∞and we do know that this series always diverges.
Having veriﬁed that limn→∞un = 0, we can continue to apply the tests for convergence
given below. First, a couple of general points:
(1)
In studying the convergence of a series it is only the ‘inﬁnite tail’
which is important, not an initial ﬁnite number of terms.
(2)
Some of the tests given below apply only to series whose terms all
eventually become positive.
The comparison test
This is essentially a generalisation of the method we used for the harmonic series. Suppose
we wish to study the convergence of the series of positive terms:
U = u1 + u2 + · · · + un + · · ·
Then in the comparison test we compare this with a known series. Thus, let
V = v1 + v2 + · · · + vn + · · ·
be a known standard series. Then if ur ≤cvr, c = a constant and V is convergent,
then so is U. If ur ≥cvr and V diverges, then so does U. This test is intuitively
obvious.

(i) As standard series take the geometric series
V = 1 + 1

Clearly, ur ≤1vr and we know that V converges because its common ratio is less
than 1, and so U also converges.

6 + · · ·
Take V = 1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 + · · ·, the harmonic series
Then ur = 1
2vr and since V diverges, so does U.
Alternating series
In the particular case of an alternating series, such as:
1 −1
2 + 1
3 −1
4 + · · ·
where the signs alternate, there is a very simple test for convergence. Thus, let
S = u1 −u2 + u3 −u4 + · · ·
(all ui ≥0). Then if
lim
n→∞un = 0 and un ≤un−1 for all n > N
(N a certain ﬁnite number) then the series converges.
Problem 14.13
Examine the convergence of the series
S = 1 −1
2 Y 1
3 −1
4 Y · · ·
In this case it is clear that
(i)
limn→∞un = 0
(ii)
un < un−1 for all n
So the required conditions are satisﬁed and therefore the series converges. Notice the
difference a sign or two makes – if all the signs are positive, then we have the harmonic
series, which we know diverges.

D’Alembert’s ratio test
Lest, as an engineer, you doubt the relevance of all this pure mathematics to your studies,
a few words about Jean Le Rond D’Alembert (1717–1783). Thought to be the illegitimate
son of a Parisian noble who paid for his education, he was found as a baby on the steps of
the church of St Jean Le Rond. He is most famous for his work in the ﬁeld of dynamics
(d’Alembert’s Principle) where he made great contributions to applying Newton’s Laws
to the motion of complicated systems of planets. In this he helped lay the foundations
for the approximation methods now used routinely in the analysis of complex mechanical
systems occurring in all aspects of engineering. His convergence test described here is just
one small example of the sorts of mathematical tool one needs to apply and justify such
approximation methods.
This useful test, the d’Alembert ratio test, deals with the positive values of the ratio
of successive terms.
For the series
S = u1 + u2 + · · · + un + · · ·
let
lim
n→∞

un+1
un
 = l
Then the series is divergent if l > 1
convergent if l < 1
and if l = 1 the test fails and we have to ﬁnd some other test, for example, the compar-
ison test.
We can see roughly why the ratio test works. We note that limn→∞

un+1
un
 gives the
behaviour of the ‘last terms of the series’ – after a large number of terms the series will
have terms un, un+1 . . . which we can compare with a geometric series with common ratio

un+1
un
. If the common ratio is less than 1 the series will converge, otherwise it will diverge
(unless possibly it is equal to 1, in which case further investigation is needed).
Problem 14.14
Examine the convergence of the following series by the ratio test:
(i)

Therefore the series converges.

lim
n→∞

un+1
un
 = lim
n→∞

1
(n + 1)2 n2
 = 1
So in this case the ratio test is inconclusive. However, it is possible to extend the
method used for the harmonic series to prove that the above series converges and in
fact more generally, the series
1 + 1
2p + 1
3p + 1
4p + 1
5p + · · ·
converges if p > 1 and diverges if p ≤1. This series provides a good standard series
for use in a comparison test.
Absolute convergence
The inﬁnite series u1 + u2 + u3 + · · · is said to be absolutely convergent if the corre-
sponding series of positive terms |u1| + |u2| + |u3| + · · · is convergent. If the series u1 +
u2 + u3 + · · · is convergent, but the series |u1| + |u2| + |u3| + · · · is divergent, we say the
series is conditionally convergent. For example:
1 −1
22 + 1
32 −· · · is absolutely convergent (see Problem 14.14(iii)).
1 −1
2 + 1
3 −1
4 + · · · is conditionally convergent (by the harmonic series).
The real power of absolute convergence comes in when we consider inﬁnite power series.
If a power series in x is absolutely convergent, then we can differentiate or integrate it
with respect to x – term by term, which may not be possible otherwise.
Convergence testing summary
Below we summarise a systematic approach to testing the convergence of a series – not
foolproof, but a good start.
When testing the series:
S = u1 + u2 + u3 + u4 + · · ·
follow the steps below:
(i)
Check that un →0 as n →∞. If un does not tend to zero then the
series diverges.
433

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

(ii)
Apply the ratio test:
if
l = lim
n→∞

un+1
un

then the series converges if l < 1 and diverges if l > 1.
(iii)
If l = 1, use a comparison test with a known standard series.
(iv)
If the series is alternating then it is convergent if un →0, as n →∞.

14.11 Inﬁnite power series
A series of form
a0 + a1x + a2x2 + a3x3 + · · ·
where the coefﬁcients are constants, is called an inﬁnite power series in x (107
➤
).
Such series are used to provide useful alternative forms for functions – for example
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + · · ·
cos x = 1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −· · ·
(x in radians)
The right-hand sides have the advantage that they can, subject to convergence, be used
to evaluate the function to any required accuracy. In general such series are obviously
most helpful for small values of x. We say they give approximations near to the origin
x = 0 and they are also called power series about the origin, or Maclaurin’s series. If
we require series that approximate a function near to some particular non–zero value of
x, say x = a, then we use a Taylor series about x = a:
f (x) = a0 + a1(x −a) + a2(x −a)2 + · · ·
434

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
A Maclaurin’s series is thus just a Taylor series about the origin. Note that by changing
the variable, X = x −a we can always convert a Taylor series to a Maclaurin’s series, so
we will conﬁne our attention to the latter here.
The coefﬁcients in a Maclaurin’s series can be found by a nice argument, which also
illustrates the condition that a Maclaurin’s series for a function f (x) only exists if f (x)
is differentiable an inﬁnite number of times.
We start with the series:
f (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · ·
The job is to ﬁnd the coefﬁcients ar. a0 is easy, just put x = 0:
a0 = f (0)
We now get the a1, a2 . . . by differentiating enough times to isolate each of them as the
constant term, and then put x = 0. Thus:
f ′(x) = a1 + 2a2x + 3a3x2 + · · ·
so
f ′(0) = a1
f ′′(x) = 2a2 + 3 × 2a3x + · · ·
so
f ′′(0) = 2a2
and
a2 = 1
2f ′′(0)
f ′′′(x) = 3 × 2a3 + · · ·
so
f ′′′(0) = 3 × 2a3
and
a3 =
1
3 × 2f ′′′(0) = 1
3!f ′′′(0)
You should now be able to see that in general
ar = 1
r!f (r)(0)
where f (r)(0) denotes the rth derivative of f (x) at x = 0. So the Maclaurin’s series for
f (x) may be written as:
f (x) = f (0) + f ′(0)x + f ′′(0)

Problem 14.15
Obtain the Maclaurins series for the functions (i) ex
(ii) cos x
(i) ex is the easy one – it just keeps repeating on differentiation and we have
f (r)(x) = ex
for all r
so
f (r)(0) = e0 = 1
So the series is
ex = 1 + x + x2
2! + x3
3! + · · ·
(ii) cos x is almost as easy:
f (0) = cos 0 = 1
f ′(0) = −sin 0 = 0
f ′′(0) = −cos 0 = −1
f ′′′(0) = sin 0 = 0
f (iv)(0) = cos 0 = 1
and so on, giving the series
cos x = 1 −x2
2! + x4
4! −· · ·
So far as the convergence of power series is concerned we can use tests such as the
ratio test described in Section 14.10. The results of such tests will usually depend on
x and so the series may only converge for certain (if any) values of x. The values
of x for which the series converges is usually called the radius of convergence. For
example, the binomial series for (1 −x)−1 only converges for |x| < 1. Clearly, if a
series does not converge for a particular value of x, then it cannot represent a sensible
function at that value.

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g

So the ratio test tells us that this series converges for all ﬁnite x. It is, of course, the
series for ex.
(ii) For x −x2

 = |x|
So by the ratio test the series is convergent if |x| < 1 and divergent if |x| > 1. If
|x| = 1 the ratio test is inconclusive and we have to consider this case separately.
There are two cases to consider, x = 1 and x = −1.
If x = 1 the series is
S = 1 −1
2 + 1
3 −1
4 + · · ·
and this is an alternating series with decreasing terms that tend to zero, and so it converges.
If x = −1:
S = −1 −1
2 −1
3 −1
4 + · · ·
and this is the negative of the harmonic series and so diverges.
Thus we can summarize our results:
x −x2
2 + x3
3 −· · ·
converges if −1 < x ≤1 and diverges if x > 1 or x ≤−1. This is in fact the series for
log(1 + x).
Note that the ratio test ensures absolute convergence, since it involves taking the
modulus of the term of the series. Thus the series for tan−1 x (see Exercise on 14.11)
is absolutely convergent for x2 < 1 and in particular can be differentiated term by term
to give
1
1 + x2 = 1 −x2 + x4 −x6 + · · ·
which can be checked by the binomial theorem (71

14.13 Applications
1. Since the derivative is deﬁned in terms of a limit, the whole of the theory of differ-
entiation can be based on limits and their properties. While an engineer may not need
to know much about the details of this theory, it is useful to have an idea of the basic
principles, since limits tell us when we can, for example, approximate a derivative by
a simple algebraic difference, for the purposes of numerical methods. This is important
in such things as numerical solution of differential equations, which is a common task
faced by the engineer.
Using the limit deﬁnition of the derivative, prove the rules of differentiation: sum,
product, quotient, and chain rule (see Chapter 8).
2. Show that if h is small then near to a point x = a any differentiable function, f (x),
can be approximated by
f (x) = f (a + h) ≃f (a) + hf ′(a)
This is a linear (in h) approximation to f (x) near to x = a. It is often used as a
basis for numerical differentiation. It essentially replaces the curve f (x) near x = a by
a portion of the tangent – Figure 14.10.

For y = f (x) = x2 obtain a linear approximation to f (x), and hence evaluate (1.01)2
approximately.
3. You may have heard talk of ‘chaos’ in recent years. This question, using an iterative
process, gives you a simple introduction to this notion. It is based on what is called the
‘logistic map’, which is an iteration scheme given by
xn+1 = Axn(1 −xn)
where A is some constant. Don’t worry where this comes from, just accept that it has
a wide applicability in science and engineering and it is important to consider when
it yields a convergent solution for xn – i.e. when the sequence it generates converges
to a deﬁnite value as we perform the iterations, as we did in Section 14.8. It is found
that this depends crucially on the value of A. Experiment with the iterations (15–20
should do, on calculator or computer) for the cases of A = 2, 1 +
√
5 and 4, with a
starting value of x0 = 0.4. The case A = 4 gives a ‘chaotic’ result as you will soon
discover.

Ordinary Differential Equations
Ordinary differential equations bring together all the calculus that we have done so far in
the book into one of the most powerful and useful tools of engineering mathematics. In this
chapter we concentrate on the principles of the key methods, rather than the intricate details
of manipulation. It helps to keep in mind the main steps of solving any differential equation:
•
identify the type of the differential equation by inspecting its form
•
choose a method of solution appropriate to the type
•
solve the equation, including any extra conditions
•
check the solution by substituting back into the differential equation
The last point may seem tedious at times, but not only does it give you greater conﬁdence
in the solution, but it gives you essential practice in differentiation and other areas of
mathematics.
Prerequisites
It will be helpful if you know something about:
• elementary algebra such as partial fractions (62
➤
)
• the exponential function and its properties (Chapter 4)
• differentiation (Chapter 8)
• integration (Chapter 9)
• sines and cosines and their properties (Chapter 6)
• exponential form of a complex number (361
➤
)
• solving simultaneous equations (391
➤
)
In particular, it will be of greatest beneﬁt if you know and fully understand the
following results:
If y = Aekx, where A and k are constants then
dy
dx = kAekx = ky
If y = A cos kx or A sin kx then
d2y
dx2 = −k2y
These two results are fundamental to differential equations and represent protype
equations of ﬁrst and second order to which we already know the solutions.

15.1 Introduction
Differential equations are often introduced by talking about rates at which radioactive
substances decay. All very well, but how many of us have a nice handy sample of pluto-
nium to play with? Now, bacterial growth – plenty of that found on mouldy bread in the
average student kitchen. If you can contain your queasiness long enough to take a detached
view of it, that grey, dusty, inedible square of once-bread can in fact provide a ready made
mini-laboratory for introducing differential equations.
If you keep a record of the growth of the mould with sufﬁcient accuracy (or, better, let
somebody else do it) you will ﬁnd that the rate at which the bacteria multiply at a given
time is roughly proportional (14
➤
) to the number present at that time. Mathematically:
if n is the number of bacteria present at time t, then n is a function of t, which we write
n = n(t), and it satisﬁes
dn
dt ∝n
or
dn
dt = kn
(15.1)
where k is some constant. This is called a differential equation (DE) for the dependent
variable n in terms of the independent variable t. It’s a little bit more complicated than
it need be, so let’s tidy it up.
446

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Dividing by k:
dn
k dt =
dn
d(kt) = n
and if we now introduce new variables:
x = kt, y = n
it becomes
dy
dx = y
(15.2)
This is a good example of mathematical modelling. By changing the mathematical vari-
ables we have tidied up the equation and reduced the problem to its simplest mathematical
form. We always do this when we can.
The differential equation (15.2) is about as simple as you can get for a non-trivial
example. Yet it is an extremely important and basic equation. It occurs throughout the
theory of DEs, and it can be used directly to solve many more complicated equations,
including some of higher order (see Section 15.5).
Problem 15.1
Solve the equation (15.2) – i.e. ﬁnd y as a function of x.
The simplest approach is to turn the derivative upside down (235
➤
):
dx
dy = 1
y
Now it is simply integration with respect to y
x =
 dx
dy dy =
 1
y dy = ln y + C
where C is an arbitrary constant.
So
ln y = x −C
y = ex−C = e−Cex = Aex
where A is another (positive) arbitrary constant.
So, a solution to dy
dx = y is y = Aex with A an arbitary constant.
Points to note are:
•
The DE is said to be ﬁrst order because the highest derivative involved
is ﬁrst order.
•
The solution contains one arbitrary constant, A, giving us an inﬁnity of
solutions.
•
Just one arbitrary constant arose precisely because to solve a ﬁrst order
DE we need to integrate just once.
447

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
•
The solution obtained is, in this case, the most general solution – there
are no others.
•
To ﬁx A we would have to specify an extra condition on y – such as
its ‘initial value’ – its value at x = 0. If this is y0 then:
y0 = Ae0 = A, so A = y0
and the solution is
y = y0ex
Exercise on 15.1
Solve the more general equation (15.1) in the case when the initial number of bacteria is
n0 = 4. If time is measured in seconds, and after 5 seconds it is found that the number of
bacteria is 10, what is the value of k?
Answer
n = 4ekt, k = 1
5 ln(5/2)
15.2 Deﬁnitions
An ordinary differential equation (DE) for a dependent variable y in terms of an
independent variable x is any equation that contains one or more derivatives of y with
respect to x, and possibly x and y. The order of the highest order derivative in the equation
deﬁnes the order of the DE.
A DE in which the only power to which y or any of its derivatives occurs is zero or
one is called a linear DE. Any other DE is said to be nonlinear. Except for some special
cases nonlinear equations are very difﬁcult to deal with. Often, particularly in engineering,
they are solved by approximating them by linear equations, although there are many cases
where the full nonlinearity must be confronted. Most of this chapter will be devoted to
linear equations.
Problem 15.2
State the order of each DE, and state which are nonlinear.

(ii)
 dy
dx
2
Y y = x
(iii)
d2y
dx2 Y 4y = 0
(iv)
d2y
dx2 Y 4y2 = 0
(i) is ﬁrst order and linear
(ii) is ﬁrst order and nonlinear
(iii) is second order and linear
(iv) is second order and nonlinear, because of the y2.
A solution of a DE for y in terms of x is any function, y = f (x), which when substituted
into the equation reduces it to an identity – that is, it satisﬁes it identically, for all values
of x (50
➤
). We then say f (x) satisﬁes the equation. In general a DE can have more
than one such solution. Sometimes a single function can be found which incorporates
448

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
all possible solutions of the DE – this is then referred to as the general solution. Such
solutions contain one or more arbitrary constants, usually depending on the order of the
DE. Any other solution than the general solution is called a particular solution. Particular
solutions can often be found by guesswork (or ‘by inspection’), but general solutions are
usually much harder to ﬁnd.
The arbitrary constant(s) occurring in the general solution can be determined by supple-
menting the DE by speciﬁed conditions in which y, or a sufﬁcient number of its derivatives,
is given for some particular value(s) of x. Such conditions are called initial or boundary
conditions.
The difference between initial and boundary conditions can be seen by considering a
projectile such as a shell from a gun. Even if you don’t know the differential equation
that describes its motion under gravity alone, you can perhaps appreciate that you could
specify the motion completely in one of (at least) two ways:
•
Specify the position and velocity at the initial point of projec-
tion – initial conditions
•
Specify two separate points on the trajectory – say point of projec-
tion and the furthest point reached, the landing point – boundary
conditions
Problem 15.3
Show that y = x3
3 Y 1 is a solution of Problem 15.2(i). Can you ﬁnd any
other solutions?
If y = x3
3 + 1 then dy
dx = x2 and the DE is clearly satisﬁed. Therefore
y = x3
3 + 1 is a solution
You may realise that in fact any function of the form
y = x3
3 + C
Where C is an arbitrary constant is also a solution, because C is knocked out by the
differentiation.
Problem 15.4
Show that the following are solutions of Problem 15.2(iii):
(a)
y = sin 2x
(b)
y = 3 cos 2x
(c)
y = 2 sin 2x −cos 2x
Can you suggest any more solutions? Is 2 sin x a solution?
(a)
Differentiating twice we have
d2y
dx2 = −4 sin 2x = −4y
449

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
giving the required DE
d2y
dx2 + 4y = 0
(b) Similarly:
d2y
dx2 = −12 cos 2x = −4y
so
d2y
dx2 + 4y = 0
i.e. this function is also a solution.
(c) d2y
dx2 = −8 sin 2x + 4 cos 2x
= −4(2 sin 2x −cos 2x)
= −4y
and again therefore
d2y
dx2 + 4y = 0
You may again realise that since both sin 2x and cos 2x are solutions of the equation,
and since it is a linear equation, then any function of the form
y = A cos 2x + B sin 2x
where A and B are arbitrary constants is also a solution.
If we try y = 2 sin x we have
d2y
dx2 = −2 sin x = −y
so this satisﬁes
d2y
dx2 + y = 0
which is not the required equation.
Problem 15.5
Find the general solution of Problem 15.2(i) and ﬁnd particular solutions
satisfying
(a)
y = 1 at x = 0
(b)
y = 0 at x = 1
In Problem 15.3 we were asked to check a given solution to the equation dy
dx = x2. Here
we wish to actually ﬁnd the most general possible solution. We can in fact directly integrate
the equation in this case, remembering to add an arbitrary constant.

which is the required general solution.
(a) If y = 1 when x = 0 then we have:
y = 1 = 0 + C
so C = 1 and the required particular solution is y = x3
3 + 1
(b) y = 0 when x = 1 gives
0 = 13
3 + C = 1
3 + C
so C = −1
3 and the required particular solution is
y = x3
3 −1
3 = x3 −1

15.3 First order equations – direct integration and
separation of variables
We will only consider cases where we can solve the given DE to give an equation for dy
dx
of the form
dy
dx = F(x, y)
where F(x, y) is a ‘well behaved’ (i.e. we can do whatever we wish with it) function of
x and y.
The ease with which we can solve such a DE will depend on the form of F(x, y). We
will build up from the simplest cases.
The simplest case is an equation of the form
dy
dx = f (x)
which can be easily ‘solved’ in principle by direct integration:
y =

f (x) dx + C
The only difﬁculty here lies in actually performing the integration. Such simple equations
illustrate many of the key points of DEs in general.
A less trivial variation on this is an equation of the form
dy
dx = g(y)
We can in fact turn this upside down [not a trivial matter, but permissible with
care (235
➤
)]:
dx
dy =
1
g(y)
Now this can be integrated directly, with respect to y:
x =

dy
g(y) + C
This results in principle in a solution of the form
x = G(y) + C
where G(y) is some function of y. We may or may not be able to solve this integrated
equation for y in terms of x.
If we are also given an initial condition, then we can ﬁnd the value of C by substituting
this in the result.

Problem 15.6
Find the general solution of the DEs:
(i)
dy
dx = x cos x
(ii)
dy
dx = cos2 y
In (ii) ﬁnd the particular solution satisfying y = p
4 when x = 0.
Check your answers by substituting back into the equations.
(i) Direct integration gives
y =

x cos x dx + C
and the task is simply to do the integration. Integration by parts (273
➤
) gives
y = x sin x −

sin x dx + C
= x sin x + cos x + C
which is the required solution, as you should check by substituting back into the DE.
(ii) dy
dx = cos2 y
In this case, turn both sides upside down
dx
dy =
1
cos2 y = sec2 y
Integrating:
x =

sec2 y dy + C = tan y + C
This is the implicit form of the solution (91
➤
). For the explicit form we solve for y:
tan y = x −C
So, as you can check in the DE, the general solution is
y = tan−1(x −C)
If y = π
4 when x = 0 then we have
y = π
4 = tan−1(−C)
from which C = −1 and the required solution is
y = tan−1(x + 1)
453

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Note that because of the multi-valued nature of the inverse tan function we have to restrict
the region on which the DE is deﬁned in order get a unique solution.
The previous cases dealt with either
dy
dx = f (x)
or
dy
dx = g(y)
It is also quite easy to treat equations of the form
dy
dx = f (x)g(y)
These are called variables separable because the expression for dy/dx can be separated
into a product of separate functions of x and y alone.
In this case we literally move all y’s to one side and x’s to the other:
dy
g(y) = f (x) dx
hence, integrating both sides with respect to their respective variables

dy
g(y) =

f (x) dx + C
Of course the left-hand side is now an integral with respect to y, the right-hand side
with respect to x. Note that we only need one arbitrary constant. Again, our only real
problem arises in actually doing the integrations.
Problem 15.7
Solve the initial value problems
(i)
dy
dx = xy
y = 1
when
x = 0
(ii)
dy
dx = e2xYy
y = 0
when

(i) For dy
dx = xy we separate to give
dy
y = x dx
so
 dy
y =

x dx + C
and integrating both sides with respect to their respective variables gives
ln y = x2
2 + C

nential’ of both sides (131

):
y = eln y = e

NOT
‘y = e

MISTAKES HERE TOO.
eA+B = eAeB
to obtain
y = e
x2
2 eC = Ae
x2
2
where we have replaced eC by A, another (positive) arbitrary constant.
Given that y = 1 when x = 0 we have
1 = Ae0 = A
so the required solution is (again, check it in the DE)
y = ex2/2
(ii) dy
dx = e2x+y = e2xey and so, separating the variables
e−y dy = e2x dx
Integrating both sides gives

e−y dy =

e2x dx + C
or
−e−y = e2x
2 + C
We might as well ﬁnd C now
−e0 = e0
2 + C
455

U n d e r s t a n d i n g

or since e0 = 1, C = −3

The form of variables separable equations is rather restrictive. Even such a simple
function as F(x, y) = x + y wouldn’t ﬁt into it. However, there are many types of equation
that may be reduced to variables separable by some kind of substitution. Consider, for
example the equation
dy
dx = x + y
x
= F(x, y)
where F(x, y) is of the form
F(x, y) = f
y
x

Such an equation is said to be homogeneous (not to be confused with later use of this
term). If we change our variables from x, y to x and v = y
x we have y = xv and so
dy
dx = v + x dv
dx
and the equation becomes
dy
dx = v + x dv
dx = f (v)
or
x dv
dx = f (v) −v
This is separable and its solution is

dv
f (v) −v =
 dx
x + C = ln x + C
After evaluating the integral on the left we can then replace v by y/x to get the solution
in terms of x and y.

dy
dx = 1 + y

dy
dx = d(xv)
dx

dx
But
dy
dx = 1 + y
x = 1 + v
So
x dv
dx = 1
or, separating the variables and integrating

dv =

x + C = ln x + C
Hence
v = y
x = ln x + C
and therefore
y = x ln x + Cx
Remember to multiply the C by x also!

15.4 Linear equations and integrating factors
This class of DEs is absolutely fundamental. Such equations occur throughout science and
engineering. A linear equation of the ﬁrst order is one that can be put in the form
dy
dx + P (x)y = Q(x)
(15.3)
where P (x) and Q(x) are functions of x. It is called ‘linear’ because the non-derivative
part is linear in the dependent variable y:
dy
dx = −P (x)y + Q(x)
(cf: ay + b)
This is key to the method of solution – if any other power of y but 0 or 1 occurred
then what we are about to do would not be possible. We notice that the left-hand side of
equation (15.3) looks very much like the derivative of a product:
dy
dx + Py
compared to say
d(uy)
dx
= udy
dx + du
dx y
The resemblance can be improved if we multiply through by a function of x, I = I(x),
yet to be determined (called an integrating factor because it enables us to integrate the
equation). So, compare
I dy
dx + IPy = IQ
with
d
dx (Iy) = I dy
dx + dI
dx y
Now IQ is a function of x alone, with no y. It can therefore be integrated with respect
to x. On the other hand, if we now take I to be such that
dI
dx = IP
then
I dy
dx + IPy = I dy
dx + dI
dx y
= d
dx (Iy)
and we have
d(Iy)
dx
= IQ
458

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
This can now be solved by direct integration:
Iy =

IQ dx + C
and we ﬁnally get the solution
y = 1
I

IQ dx + C

= 1
I

IQ dx + C
I
Thus, the purpose of multiplying by the integrating factor is to convert the left-hand
side to the derivative of a product so that we can integrate the resulting equation directly.
But all this depends on ﬁnding I from the equation
dI
dx = IP
This equation is separable:
dI
I
= P dx
so
 dI
I
=

P (x) dx
Note that we needn’t bother to introduce an arbitrary constant here – you can if you like,
but it will simply cancel out in the end.
Thus, for I we obtain
ln I =

P (x) dx
So the integrating factor is given by
I = e

P(x) dx
I don’t encourage you to remember the above results, either for I or the solution for
y. Rather, you should try to remember how to reproduce the above arguments to derive
solutions directly yourself. This may seem daunting, but with plenty of practice it is not
too bad, and is a very useful skill. To help with this the following problems work through
the procedure step by step. It also illustrates that you can often short cut the process of
ﬁnding the integrating factor by rearranging the left-hand side of the original equation to
be the derivative of a product ‘by inspection’.

will be satisﬁed if
dI
dx = I
x
which is the required equation for the integrating factor. Note that it is separable.
Problem 15.11
Determine the integrating factor I .
Separating the variables of the last equation we have
dI
I
= dx
x
or, integrating through
 dI
I
=
 dx
x
Performing the integrations gives
ln I = ln x
So in this case we have
I = x
for the integrating factor. Note that we don’t need to include an arbitrary constant at this
stage.
Problem 15.12
Solve the original equation.
Multiplying the linear form by the integrating factor x we now have
x dy
dx + y = x2
460

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(back where we started, but bear with me on this – we’ll come back to it later). We know
that the left-hand side must now be the derivative of a product, namely Iy, because that
is precisely why we chose the integrating factor:
d
dx (Iy) = d
dx (xy) = x2
Integrating both sides ﬁnally gives
xy = x3
3 + C
(Now we introduce the arbitrary constant), so the general solution is
y = x2
3 + C
x
Problem 15.13
Repeat the solution but dispense with the integrating factor and solve the
original equation directly.
We ended up, in Problem 15.12, after ﬁnding the integrating factor, with the original
equation:
x dy
dx + y = x2
In fact, in this case, the IF is really using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Simply notice
that by reversing the product rule
x dy
dx + y ≡d
dx (xy)
and we have
d
dx (xy) = x2
which is where we got to after ﬁnding the integrating factor. We are therefore led directly
to the result
xy = x3
3 + C
In general of course it may not be quite so easy to spot the required derivative of a
product, and we may need to go through the full procedure of ﬁnding the IF, but try to
avoid it when you can. You can in any case see that the better developed your skills of
differentiation, the easier it will be to spot such short cuts.

15.5 Second order linear homogeneous differential
equations
If you found the previous section difﬁcult then you may be approaching this section with
some trepidation – surely second order will be worse than ﬁrst order? Relax. We only
consider a simple, but extremely important, type of second order equation and it turns out
that this is relatively straightforward to solve. The particular type of linear second order
equation that we will consider is one of the form
a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = f (x)
(15.4)
where a, b, c are constants (and a ̸= 0, otherwise it wouldn’t be second order!). For such
equations the basic tools that you need are simply solution of quadratics (including complex
roots) and solution of simultaneous linear equations. Equation (15.4) occurs everywhere in
science and engineering, most notably in the modelling of vibrating springs in a resisting
medium, and in electrical circuits.
We need some terminology. The equation:
a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = 0
(15.5)
is the associated homogeneous equation, while equation (15.4), with f (x) ̸= 0, is the
inhomogeneous form. The general solution to the homogeneous equation is called the
complementary function, while any solution to equation (15.4) is called a particular
integral. The general solution of equation (15.4) is the sum of the complementary
function and a particular integral.
For example the differential equation
d2y
dx2 + 3dy
dx + 2y = 2ex
is inhomogeneous, and the corresponding homogeneous form is
d2y
dx2 + 3dy
dx + 2y = 0
The general solution of this homogeneous equation is the complementary function of
the ﬁrst, inhomogeneous, equation. In this case it happens to be (see below)
yc = Ae−x + Be−2x
where A and B are two arbitrary constants.
462

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Any particular solution of the inhomogeneous equation is a particular integral of the
equation. By substituting it in the equation you should check that a particular integral in
this case is
yp = 1
3ex
The general solution of the inhomogeneous equation is thus
y = yc + yp = Ae−x + Be−2x + 1
3ex
We therefore have two jobs – to ﬁnd the complementary function and to ﬁnd a particular
integral. We ﬁrst concentrate on ﬁnding the complementary function and look for general
solutions of equations of the form of equation (15.5). There is an additional result which
helps us here:
If y1 and y2 are two solutions of the homogeneous linear equation
a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = 0
then y1 + y2 is also a solution. Thus, the sum (or any other linear combination) of two
solutions is also a solution. To see this important result in its most general form let y1, y2 be
two solutions of the DE and consider the linear combination y = αy1 + βy2. Substituting
this in the DE gives
a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = a d2(αy1 + βy2)
dx2
+ bd(αy1 + βy2)
dx
+ c(αy1 + βy2)
= α

a d2y1
dx2 + bdy1
dx + cy1

+ β

a d2y2
dx2 + bdy2
dx + cy2

= α(0) + β(0) = 0
So the general linear combination y = αy1 + βy2 is also a solution.
In fact, ﬁnding the complementary function, i.e. the general solution to equation (15.5),
is not as difﬁcult as might be thought. Note that if we put a = 0 then we are back to the
simple equation
bdy
dx + cy = 0
and we know that this has an exponential solution (447
➤
). This encourages us to try a
similar exponential function for the second order equation.
We therefore take a trial solution
y = eλx
where λ is some constant parameter to be determined.
Substituting into the equation:
y′ = λeλx, y′′ = λ2eλx
gives
(aλ2 + bλ + c)eλx = 0
463

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Since eλx ̸= 0 we have
aλ2 + bλ + c = 0
So λ satisﬁes a quadratic equation with the same coefﬁcients as the DE itself, ay′′ + by′ +
cy. This equation in λ is called the auxiliary or characteristic equation (AE). As with all
quadratics with real coefﬁcients (66
➤
) there are three distinct types of solution:
•
Real distinct roots
•
Real equal roots
•
Complex conjugate roots
Each leads to a different type of solution to the DE. In each case we get two distinct
types of solution, and the general solution is formed from these. Below we summarise the
forms of these solutions. In each case you should verify the stated solutions by substituting
in the equations. The problems which follow will conﬁrm the results in particular cases.
Roots of AE real and distinct α1, α2
This gives two solutions
eα1x, eα2x
and the general solution is then
y = Aeα1x + Beα2x
Roots real and equal, α
In this case two distinct solutions can be found:
eαx, xeαx
and the general solution is then
y = (Ax + B)eαx
Roots complex, α ± jβ
This gives two solutions
e(α+jβ)x, e(α−jβ)x
giving a general solution
y = Ae(α+jβ)x + Be(α−jβ)x
= eαx(Aejβx + Be−jβx)
The imaginary j is not always welcome here, so we use Euler’s formula (361
➤
) to put
the solution into real form
ejβx = cos βx + j sin βx
e−jβx = cos βx −j sin βx
y = eαx((A + B) cos βx + (A −jB) sin βx)
464

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
or with
C = A + B and D = A −jB
y = eαx(C cos βx + D sin βx)
Note: Although we usually prefer such a real form of the solution, particularly in actual
physical applications, there are times when the complex exponential form is in fact
most convenient – for example when we are using phasors in alternating current elec-
trical work.
We now work through a number of problems to illustrate the above results. As always,
you will beneﬁt greatly by checking the solutions obtained by substituting back into
the DE.
Problem 15.14
Find values of l for which y = elx satisﬁes the DE
y′′ Y 3y′ Y 2y = 0
and hence determine its general solution. Find the particular solution satis-
fying the initial conditions y.0/ = 0, y′.0/ = 1.
We have
y′ = λeλx, y′′ = λ2eλx
Substituting into the equation gives
(λ2 + 3λ + 2)eλx = 0
or the auxiliary equation:
λ2 + 3λ + 2 = 0
(λ + 1)(λ + 2) = 0
So
λ = −1, −2
We therefore have two solutions to the DE
e−x, e−2x
The general solution is then
y = Ae−x + Be−2x
containing two arbitrary constants A, B, as we might expect for a second order DE. To ﬁnd
them we apply the given initial conditions (remember that e0 = 1 and d(eax)
dx
= aeax):
y(0) = A + B = 0
y′(0) = −A −2B = 1
465

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Solving these two equations gives A = 1, B = −1 and the particular solution satisfying
the initial conditions is
y = e−x −e−2x
Problem 15.15
Find the general solution of the DE
y′′ −6y′ Y 9y = 0
Substituting y = eλx gives, in this case, the AE
λ2 −6λ + 9 = 0
or
(λ −3)2 = 0
We therefore have two equal roots, λ = 3 (rather than a single root of λ = 3!). One solution
of the DE is therefore obviously
y = e3x
But we expect two. On such occasions we try to guess other, similar, types of solution.
While there is a full justiﬁcation for our guesswork in the advanced theory of differential
equations here I ask you to simply accept and conﬁrm for yourself that the simplest guess
that works is
y = xe3x
This gives
y′ = (3x + 1)e3x
y′′ = 3e3x + 3(3x + 1)e3x
= (9x + 6)e3x
Substituting in the equation gives
(9x + 6)e3x −6(3x + 1)e3x + 9xe3x ≡0
so this is indeed a solution. The general solution in this case is therefore
y = Axe3x + Be3x
= (Ax + B)e3x
Problem 15.16
Find the general solution of the equation
y′′ Y 2y′ Y 2y = 0
466

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
The AE is
λ2 + 2λ + 2 = 0
which has the complex roots
λ = −1 ± j
This gives the two solutions
e(−1+j)x, e(−1−j)x
and the general solution
y = e−x(Aejx + Be−jx)
Now, using Euler’s formula (361
➤
)
e±jx = cos x ± j sin x
we get
y = e−x(A(cos x + j sin x) + B(cos x −j sin x))
= e−x((A + B) cos x + j(A −B) sin x)
= e−x(C cos x + D sin x)
on writing C = A + B and D = j(A −B).
In this ‘real form’ the j is hidden and for physical problems where y represents a real
quantity, such as distance or current, never resurfaces. However, as noted previously the
complex exponential form is sometimes useful in applications such as alternating current
theory.
In the above list of solutions we essentially have just three distinct types of functions:
eαx, xeαx, and eαx sin βx. Each of these functions has a particular sort of behaviour which
typiﬁes the class to which it belongs, and the type of physical system it represents.

eαx gives an increasing (α > 0) or decaying (α < 0) exponential
function:

xeαx gives a similar type of function, but with a kink in it, and it also
passes through the origin. Examples of this function were sketched in
Chapter 10.
3.
eαx sin βx gives either a simple oscillating wave (α = 0), or a sinusoidal
wave with amplitude that decreases (α < 0) or increases (α > 0) as

15.6 The inhomogeneous equation
We now turn to the solution of the full inhomogeneous equation
a d2y
dx2 + bdy
dx + cy = f (x)
We now know the general form of the CF, so we just need to ﬁnd particular
integrals (PI). These depend on the form of f (x). In fact, in many cases the form
of the PI mirrors precisely that of the function f (x) itself. The general approach
is to make a trial solution which has the same form as f (x). This does not
468

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
always work, but is a good start, and we will come back to exceptional cases
later. This approach is called the method of undetermined coefﬁcients. It in fact
works for equations of any order, provided the coefﬁcients are constant, as we are
assuming here.
Table 15.1
f(x)
Trial solution
Polynomial of degree n
Polynomial of degree n:
f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · ·
yp = Lxn + Mxn−1 + · · ·
Exponential:
Similar exponential
f (x) = ekx
yp = Lekx
Sinusoidal function:
Linear combination of similar sinusoidals:
f (x) = sin ωx or cos ωx
yp = L cos ωx + M sin ωx
‘Damped’ sinusoidal:
Linear combination of similar damped sinusoidals
f (x) = ekx cos ωx or ekx sin ωx
yp = Lekx cos ωx + Mekx sin ωx
The ‘forcing functions’ f (x) given in Table 15.1 cover most cases of physical
interest at the elementary level. They can in fact be used for much more complicated
functions, f (x), using linearity and the techniques of Fourier analysis (➤517) for
example, so they are in fact more general than you might think. We will give
an example of each of them before discussing the complications of exceptional
cases.
Problem 15.17
Find a particular integral for the equation
y′′ Y 2y′ Y y = x Y 2
Hence determine the general solution. Find the particular solution
satisfying the initial conditions y.0/ = 0, y′.0/ = 0.
For reasons that become clear later, we will always ﬁnd the CF ﬁrst. In this case you can
treat it as an exercise to check that
yc = (Ax + B)e−x
Now for the PI we note that f (x) is in this case a ﬁrst degree polynomial – i.e. a linear
function. We therefore try a solution of the same form:
yp = Lx + M, so y′
p = L, y′′
p = 0
Substituting in the equation gives
0 + 2L + Lx + M = Lx + (2L + M) ≡x + 2
Solving this identity (50
➤
) gives
L = 1
2L + M = 2
469

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
so M = 0. Thus, the PI is yp = x, as you can (should!) check by substituting back into
the equation:
y′′ + 2y′ + y = 0 + 2(1) + x = x + 2
The GS to the inhomogeneous equation is therefore
y = (Ax + B)e−x + x
Applying the initial conditions we have (remember e0 = 1)
y(0) = B = 0
y′(0) = A + 1 = 0
so A = −1, B = 0 and therefore
y = x −xe−x = x(1 −e−x)
NB: When applying the initial or boundary conditions to solutions of inhomogeneous
equations you must apply them to the full general solution – complementary function
plus particular integral, as we have done here. It is a common mistake for beginners to
apply such conditions simply to the complementary function.
Problem 15.18
Find a particular integral for the equation
y′′ Y 3y′ Y 2y = 3e2x
Hence determine the general solution.
The CF is yc = Ae−x + Be−2x (see Problem 15.14). For the PI we try a solution similar
to the right-hand side:
yp = Le2x,
y′
p = 2Le2x,
y′′
p = 4Le2x
Substituting in the equation gives
(4L + 6L + 2L)e2x ≡12Le2x = 3e2x
so
L = 1
4 and the PI is yp = 1
4e2x
(check this back in the equation).
The full GS is therefore
y = Ae−x + Be−2x + 1
4e2x
Problem 15.19
Find the general solution to the equation
y′′ Y 2y′ Y 2y = 2 cos 3x
The CF is yc = e−x(A cos x + B sin x), from Problem 15.16.
470

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
For the PI you might be tempted to try yp = L cos 3x, but in fact we need both cos 3x
and sin 3x terms because of the ﬁrst order derivative on the left-hand side. We therefore try
yp = L cos 3x + M sin 3x
y′
p = −3L sin 3x + 3M cos 3x
y′′
p = −9L cos 3x −9M sin 3x
substituting in the DE gives, on collecting cos and sin terms:
(−7L + 6M) cos 3x + (−6L −7M) sin 3x ≡2 cos 3x
So
−6L −7M = 0
−7L + 6M = 2
whence
L = −14
85,
M = 12
85
and the PI is
yp = −14
85 cos 3x + 12
85 sin 3x
and the GS is
y = e−x(A cos x + B sin x) −14
85 cos 3x + 12
85 sin 3x
(again, check back in the equation).
Problem 15.20
Find the general solution to the equation
y′′ Y 4y = e−x cos x
The CF is
yc = A cos 2x + B sin 2x
For the PI choose
yp = Le−x cos x + Me−x sin x
Then, as an exercise in differentiation by the product rule (234
➤
), you can check that
y′′
p = e−x(2L sin x −2M cos x)
Substituting in the equation gives, after simpliﬁcation
e−x[(4L −2M) cos x + (2L + 4M) sin x] ≡e−x cos x
471

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Or, cancelling e−x and equating coefﬁcients of cos x and sin x
4L −2M = 1
2L + 4M = 0
These give
L = 1
5,
M = −1
10
So ﬁnally, the GS is y = A cos 2x + B sin 2x + 1
5 e−x cos x −1
10 e−x sin x
Two points to note:
•
The above method of undetermined coefﬁcients is not the only
method – there are others that are more powerful in some cases – D-
operators, complex variable methods, Laplace transform, etc. But it is
systematic and routine.
•
It doesn’t always work in such a straightforward way.
To see how the method can break down, and what to do about it, try the following
problem.
Problem 15.21
Investigate the particular integral for the following equation
y′′ −y′ −2y = e−x
Trying y = Le−x for a PI, as we might be tempted, gives
‘0 = e−x’
and clearly does not work. In fact in this case the reason a trial function similar to the right-
hand side won’t work is that it is already a solution of the corresponding homogeneous
equation – that is, it is part of the complementary function. This is when the method
breaks down – when the right-hand side is part of the CF. And that’s why we always
evaluate the CF ﬁrst, to check whether it does contain the right-hand side. In this case the
CF is the GS of
y′′ −y′ −2y = 0
which you can check is y = Ae−x + Be2x. The right-hand side is indeed included in
the CF.
So, what do we do in such cases? As usual in mathematics we do as little as
possible – that is we look for alternatives that are as close to what we have as possible.
Remember that in the case of equal roots for the auxiliary equation, when looking at the
CF, we tried – successfully – replacing eαx by xeαx(466
➤
)? Perhaps a similar strategy
works this time?
Problem 15.22
Try yp = Lxe−x in the differential equation of Problem 15.21, where L is
to be determined.
472

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
We have
y′′
p −y′
p −2yp = L(x −2)e−x −L(1 −x)e−x −2Lxe−x
= −3Le−x = the RHS = e−x
So Lxe−x is indeed a solution of the DE if L = −1
3 and therefore a particular solution is
yp = −1
3xe−x.
Now, you may feel uncomfortable with all this guesswork. Don’t worry, it can all be put
on a formal basis and derived rigorously, but we do not have the space to go into it here.
So, we will simply collect all the necessary results together and state them without proof,
for your reference. The method to be described actually works for arbitrary order linear
equations with constant coefﬁcients and so we will formulate it in quite general terms.
To specialise to the second order case we have been considering so far just take n = 2.
However, you may meet the general case of higher order n in, for example, control systems.
So, consider the general nth order linear differential equation with constant coefﬁcients
(y(r)(x) denotes the rth order derivative dry
dxr ):
any(n)(x) + an−1y(n−1)(x) + · · · + a1y(1)(x) + a0y(x) = f (x)
Then in the following cases:
(1)
f (x) an mth degree polynomial
(a)
If a0 ̸= 0 – i.e. the equation contains a non-derivative term,
then we choose a particular solution of the form
yp = Lmxm + Lm−1xm−1 + · · · + L1x + L0
(b)
If a0 = 0 so that there is no non-derivative term in the
differential equation and if the lowest order of derivative is
r, then choose
yp = Lmxm+r + Lm−1xm+r−1 + · · · + L1xr+1 + L0xr
(2)
f (x) of the form sin ωx or cos ωx
(a)
If sin ωx or cos ωx do not occur in the complementary function,
then take a particular solution of the form
yp = L cos ωx + M sin ωx
(b)
If the complementary function contains terms of the form
xr sin ωx or xr cos ωx for r = 0, 1, . . . , m, take yp to be
the form
Lxm+1 cos ωx + Mxm+1 sin ωx
(3)
f (x) an exponential function, f (x) = ekx
(a)
If ekx is not contained in the complementary function, take
yp(x) to be of the form
yp = Lekx
473

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
(b)
If the complementary function contains terms ekx, xekx, . . . ,
xmekx, take yp(x) to be of the form
yp = Lxm+1ekx
(4)
f (x) of the form ekx cos ωx or ekx sin ωx
(a)
If these terms are not contained in the complementary function,
then simply take yp(x) to be of the form
yp = Lekx cos ωx + Mekx sin ωx
(b)
If terms of the form xrekx cos ωx or xrekx sin ωx, for r =
0, 1, . . . , m, are contained in the complementary functions, then
include terms of the form
Lxm+1ekx cos ωx + Mxm+1ekx sin ωx
in yp.
Some obvious patterns may be seen in the above particular integrals. Essentially, if
the complementary function does not contain terms identical to the inhomogeneous term,
then the particular integral looks much the same as the inhomogeneous term. However, if
the inhomogeneous term occurs in the complementary function, then we must modify the
particular integral and this is done by multiplying by an appropriate power of x.
In general, by superposition of terms we see that we can treat particular integrals for
expressions of the form
f (x) = P (x)ekx cos ωx + Q(x)ekx sin ωx
where P (x), Q(x) are polynomials in x. This essentially comes about because any order
derivative of such an expression results in an expression of the same form.
Having found the particular integral, we can ﬁnd the general solution by adding it to
the complementary function. Note again that when applying boundary or initial conditions
these must always be applied to the full solution – complementary function plus particular
integral – and not simply to the complementary function alone.

15.8 Applications
There are a number of well known applications of ﬁrst order equations which provide
classic prototypes for mathematical modelling. These mainly rely on the interpretation of
dy/dt as a rate of change of a function y with respect to time t. In everyday life there are
many examples of the importance of rates of change – speed of moving particles, growth
and decay of populations and materials, heat ﬂow, ﬂuid ﬂow, and so on. In each case we
can construct models of varying degrees of sophistication to describe given situations.
1. The rate at which a radioactive substance decays is found to be proportional to the
mass m(t) present at time t. Write down and solve the differential equation expressing
this relation, given that the initial mass is m(0) = m0 and when t = 1, m = m0
2 .
2. Newton’s law of cooling states that the rate at which an object cools is proportional
to the difference between the temperature at the surface of the body, and the ambient
air temperature. Thus, if T is the surface temperature at time t and Ta is the ambient
temperature, then
dT
dt = −λ(T −Ta)
T (0) = T0
476

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
where λ > 0 is some experimentally determined constant of proportionality, and T0 is
the initial temperature. Solve this to give the temperature at t > 0.
3. In Applications, Chapter 2, we saw how the differential equation
dx
dt = k(x −a)(x −b)(x −c)
typical of models of chemical reactions, describes the reaction between three gases
A, B, C in a vapour deposition process. Find the general solution of the equation for
a number of examples of values of k, a, b, c, starting with a simple case such as
k = a = b = 1, c = 0 and building up to more complicated examples. Also consider
various initial conditions. Study the nature of the solutions for the various values of
the parameters k, a, b, c.
4. The classic application of differential equations is, of course, in Newtonian mechanics.
The differential equations arise from either the kinematic relation dx/dt = v, the
velocity, or the dynamical relation (Newton’s second law) mdv/dt = md2x/dt2 =
mass × acceleration = force. In general we have
d2x
dt2 = f (x, y, dy
dt )
This reduces to a ﬁrst order equation in a number of cases. For example, if f is
independent of x we have
dv
dt = f (t, v)
or if it is independent of t we can write
dv
dt = dx
dt
dv
dx = v dv
dx = f (x, v)
With sufﬁciently complex force laws, we can obtain a variety of differential equations
sufﬁcient to keep the most ardent mathematician satisﬁed – indeed, much of the modern
theory of nonlinear differential equation is dynamics, and you will ﬁnd books on
‘dynamical systems’ shoulder to shoulder with textbooks on differential equations on
the library bookshelves.
A particle falling vertically under gravity, subject to a resistance proportional to its
velocity, v, satisﬁes the equation of motion
mdv
dt = mg −kv
where m is its mass, g the acceleration due to gravity and k a positive constant. Solve
this equation and interpret the motion. Assume the initial velocity is v = v0 at t = 0.
5. Many complicated physical, biological, and commercial situations can be modelled
by a system of interconnected units or ‘compartments’ between which some quantity
ﬂows or is communicated. Examples include the distribution of drugs in various parts
477

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
of the body, water ﬂow between connected reservoirs, or ﬁnancial transactions in a
commercial environment. This exercise illustrates the basic ideas in this topic.
Take as our compartment a tank containing 100L of water, into which a brine solution
ﬂows at a rate of 5L/min and out of which solution ﬂows at 5L/min. The concentration
of the incoming brine solution is 1 kg/L. Construct a model, based on reasonable
assumptions, which will enable you to determine the concentration of salt in the tank
at any time after inﬂow commences.
6. There are many areas of science and engineering where second order linear differential
equations provide useful models. Rather than become enmeshed in the technical details
of speciﬁc applications, we will look at generic models which have utility across a
wide range of applications.
The general second order inhomogeneous linear equation with constant coefﬁcients
a ¨x + b ˙x + cx = f (t)
(15.6)
arises naturally in dynamics as a consequence of Newton’s second law
m¨x = F(t, x, ˙x)
in which the force F arises from a particular physical set up. For example if we are
talking about the motion of a particle of mass m attached to a spring, oscillating in a
resisting medium, and subject to an additional time dependent force f (t), then we might
model the forces acting as follows, taking x as the displacement from equilibrium:
(i) spring restoring force, −αx α > 0
(ii) resistance force proportional to velocity, −β ˙x
β > 0
(iii) forcing term f (t)
Newton’s second law then gives
m¨x + β ˙x + αx = f (t)
A similar equation was mentioned in Chapter 2 (79
➤
) for the capacitor voltage in a
source free electrical circuit containing an inductance L, resistance R, capacitance C.
With an appropriate source term f (0) this becomes
d2V
dt2 + R
L
dV
dt +
1
LC V = f (t)
which is, apart from the physical constants, the same as the Newton’s law equation
above. The same sort of equation describes many other systems of widely varying
types – this is mathematical technology transfer!
Such equations are used to describe some type of oscillatory behaviour, with some
degree of damping. We will concentrate our attention on the general properties of such
behaviour, and adopt the mechanical notation of the ﬁrst equation above.
The case β = 0 = f (t) is the simplest to deal with, yielding unforced, undamped
simple harmonic motion:
m¨x + αx = 0
478

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Show that the solution in this case is
x = A sin(ωt + φ)
where ω2 = α/m.
In the presence of damping, but no forcing terms, the equation becomes
m¨x + β ˙x + αx = 0
Find the general solution in this case, and consider the cases of
(i) overdamping, β2 > 4α
(ii) critical damping, β2 = 4α
(iii) underdamping, β2 < 4α
If f (t) ̸= 0 in equation (15.6) then we have an additional forcing term, impelling
the particle to respond not just to the spring tension and the resistance, but to some
additional force (such as gravity for example). One of the most interesting cases occurs
when the forcing term is periodic itself, resulting in an equation of the form
m¨x + β ˙x + αx = f0 cos υt
Show that the general solution in this case is
x(t) = Ce−βt/2 sin
	
4α −β2
2
t + φ

+
f0
	
(α −υ2)2 + β2υ2 sin(υt + δ)
where tan δ = (α −υ2)/(βυ). The ﬁrst term represents damped oscillatory motion and
will eventually die out if β > 0. For this reason it is called the transient solution. The
second term, on the other hand, originating from the forcing term, persists so long as
the forcing term does, with the same frequency, but a modiﬁed amplitude and phase
(this is a characteristic of linear systems – any sinusoidal input is output with the same
frequency but modiﬁed amplitude and phase). This second term is therefore referred to
as the steady state solution – it is what is left after the transients decay away. Note
that the amplitude of the steady state solution
f0
	
(α −υ2)2 + β2υ2
depends on the relation between the damping β, the forcing frequency v and the natural
frequency α. Show that if β2 < 4α (i.e. the system is underdamped), then the amplitude
of forced motion has a maximum at
υ = υr =

α −β2
2
At this value of υ we say the system is at resonance and υr/2π is called the resonant
frequency.

16.1 Introduction
Often, topics in engineering mathematics can be presented most clearly by means of
diagrams rather than symbols. This topic is perhaps the opposite to this – the pictures used
in illustrating calculus of more than one variable are sometimes not easy to visualise – but
don’t worry, in this case the symbols are much easier to handle.
Previously we have considered mainly functions of a single variable, e.g.
y = f (x)
In practice, in engineering and science, we usually have to deal with functions of many
variables.
For example the pressure P of a perfect gas depends on its volume and temperature:
P = RT
V
= P (V, T )
R being the gas constant. We want to consider such questions as, how does P change if
V and T vary at given rates?
In general we will restrict consideration to functions of two variables, because these can
be portrayed graphically. A function of two variables can be represented by a surface in
3-dimensional space. However, most of the ideas we cover are easily extended to functions
of more than two variables, even if the pictures are not.
Exercises on 16.1
1. In the relation between P , V , and T , how does P vary with (i) T , (ii) V ? How does
V vary with (iii) T , (iv) P ?
2. If V increases by 10% while T remains constant, by what percentage, approximately,
does P change?
Answers
1.
(i) In proportion; (ii) In inverse proportion; (iii) In proportion; (iv) In inverse
proportion.
2. Decreases by approximately 10%.
16.2 Function of two variables
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables. If we take a 3-dimensional Cartesian
coordinate system as described in Section 11.4 then any point in 3-dimensional space
can be represented by a point referred to this system, P (x, y, z). For each point (x, y)
of the xy plane, we can calculate the value of z from z = f (x, y) and plot this at an
appropriate z-level ﬁxed by the z-axis. In this way, the function f (x, y) gives a surface
in 3 dimensions, as shown in Figure 16.1.

For example, the linear function:
z = ax + by + c
represents a plane in 3-dimensional space, as shown in Figure 16.2 (only the portion in
the ﬁrst octant is sketched).
In the theory of single variable we measure the rate of increase or slope of a curve by
the slope of the tangent to the curve at a given point. In the case of functions with two
variables, where we have to deal with a surface, we measure the rate of increase or slope
of a surface by the orientation or slope of a tangent plane to the surface. Thus at any
point on the surface we can deﬁne a unique plane, the tangent plane, which touches the
surface at just that one point, locally. The orientation of this plane clearly gives a measure

Any line in the tangent plane is also tangent to the surface. In particular, the lines

16.3 Partial differentiation
The lines in the tangent plane parallel to the xz-plane, give the slope of the surface in the
x-direction at each point. When considering rate of change in the x-direction alone, the
y-coordinate in z = f (x, y) can be regarded as constant. Then for this ﬁxed valued of y
z = f (x, y)
is a function of x, a curve parallel to the xz plane. The slope of this curve can be obtained
in the usual way by differentiating:
dz
dx = df
dx
However, this notation is not appropriate because f is now a function of two variables,
so we use:
∂z
∂x = ∂f
∂x (x, y)
read ‘curly dee dee ex’.
This is called the partial derivative of z with respect to x, and represents the rate of
change of z with respect to x assuming y is constant. We will also denote it by fx. It gives
the rate of change in z in the x-direction, or the slope of the surface in the x-direction
(see Figure 16.5). We can deﬁne the partial derivative rigorously in terms of a limit as
follows:
∂f
∂x = lim
h→0
f (x + h, y) −f (x, y)
h

Similarly, we can deﬁne the partial derivative with respect to y:
∂f
∂y = lim
k→0
f (x, y + k) −f (x, y)
k

which is the derivative of f with respect to y assuming x constant. We will sometimes
use fy. It gives the rate of change of f in the y-direction, or the slope of the surface in
the y-direction.
The rules of partial differentiation are the same as those in ordinary differentiation, so

∂x2 , ∂2z
∂x∂y , ∂2z
∂y∂x , ∂2z

which we will sometimes write as zxx, zxy, zyx, zyy, respectively.
For all functions we are interested in we may assume that
∂2z
∂x∂y = ∂2z
∂y∂x
or
zxy = zyx
Similarly, higher order derivates may be deﬁned, such as
∂3z
∂x2∂y = zxxy, etc.

Evaluate all second order derivatives of the function
f .x, y/ = x3 Y y3 Y 2xy Y x2y
and verify that
@2f
@x@y = @2f
@y@x
The differentiation of f (x, y) = x3 + y3 + 2xy + x2y is routine and we obtain
fx = 3x2 + 2y + 2xy
fxx = 6x + 2y
fy = 3y2 + 2x + x2
fyy = 6y
fxy = (fx)y = (3x2 + 2y + 2xy)y = 2 + 2x
fyx = (fy)x = (3y2 + 2x + x2)x = 2 + 2x
= fxy

16.5 The total differential
∂z
∂x , ∂z
∂y give the rates of increase of z = f (x, y) in the x and y directions respec-
tively – what about the increase in a general direction? I.e. if x, y increase by δx, δy,
by how much does z increase? From Figure 16.6 we can see that the increase in z, δz, is
given approximately by
δz ≃δz
δx δx + δz
δy δy
Such diagrams are not to everyone’s taste, so a few examples might help.

Obtain expressions for dz in the cases

z = x Y y

What happens if dx, dy are so small that products of them can be neglected?
(i) is not so bad:
δz = x + δx + y + δy −(x + y) = δx + δy
This result is exact. There are no products of δx, δy.
(ii) is a little more complicated:
δz = (x + δx)(y + δy) −xy
= yδx + xδy + δxδy

This is exact. However, if we neglect δxδy then we get an approximation:
δz ≃yδx + xδy
Notice that since zx = y and zy = x this may be written
δz ≃zxδx + zyδy
(iii) δz = (x + δx)2 + (y + δy)2 −x2 −y2
= 2xδx + 2yδy + (δx)2 + (δy)2
≃2xδx + 2yδy
if we neglect the δ products. Again, notice that this is
δz ≃zxδx + zyδy
These examples illustrate the result
δz ≃zxδx + zyδy
stated above.
Note that this is an approximate formula between increments δx, δy, δz. It is useful
to deﬁne differentials dx, dy, dz which satisfy:
dz = ∂z
∂x dx + ∂z
∂y dy

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
dz is called the total differential of z. The dx, dy, dz are not actually numerical quantities,
but simply symbolise quantities that can be taken as small as we wish, but never zero.
They really only serve to deﬁne derivatives. Thus, if x, y, are both functions of a parameter
t (e.g. in dynamics t = time) we can formally ‘divide by dt’ and write:
dz
dt = ∂z
∂x
dx
dt + ∂z
∂y
dy
dt
and this gives the total rate of change of z with t given the rate of change of x and y with
t. dz/dt is called the total derivative of z with respect to t. Both the formula for dz and
dz/dt extend in an obvious way to functions of greater than two variables, although the
geometrical signiﬁcance is not so easy to visualize.
Problem 16.4
Find dz at the point (1, 2, 5) for z = x2 Y y2.
Essentially, all we need are the ﬁrst partial derivatives. We have
∂z
∂x = 2x,
∂z
∂y = 2y
The total differential is therefore given by
dz = ∂z
∂x dx + ∂z
∂y dy
= 2x dx + 2y dy
So at (1, 2, 5) this gives
dz = 2(1) dx + 2(2) dy = 2 dx + 4 dy
This is a formal relation between dx, dy, dz, which can for example be used to evaluate
the total derivative of z at the point (1, 2, 5) as
dz
dt = 2dx
dt + 4dy
dt
This gives us the rate of change of z at (1, 2, 5) in terms of the rates of change of x and
y at that point. However, the above relation between differentials can also be regarded as
an approximate relation between small increments δx, δy, δz to give
δz ≃2δx + 4δy
This gives us the approximate change in z at (1, 2, 5) if x and y are changed by small
amounts δx, δy respectively.
As an example of the use of the total differential in approximations consider the problem
of ﬁnding the percentage error in functions of the form
z = xαyβ
due to given percentage errors in x and y.
492

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
We have (treating dx, dy, etc. as small increments here)
dz = αxα−1yβdx + βxαyβ−1 dy
so the relative error in z due to ‘errors’ dx, dy in x, y respectively is
dz
z = αxα−1yβ
z
dx + βxαyβ−1
z
dy
= α xα−1yβ
xαyβ
dx + βxαyβ−1
xαyβ

= α dx
x + β dy

So the percentage error in z is

dy
y × 100

= α percentage error in x + β percentage error in y
Notice the pattern in which the exponents in the original expression become the linear
weightings in the expression for the percentage error.
An easier derivation is to ﬁrst take logs
ln z = ln(xαyβ) = α ln x + β ln y
Now differentiate through
dz
z = α dx
x + β dy
y
and then multiplying through by 100 gives the required relation between percentage errors.
Extension to functions of more than two variables is obvious.
Problem 16.5
Find the percentage error in the volume of a rectangular box in terms of
the percentage errors in the sides of the box.
With sides a, b, c the volume of the box is
V = abc = a1b1c1
So the percentage error in V is
dV
V
× 100 = 1.da
a × 100 + 1.db
b × 100 + 1.dc
c × 100
= percentage error in a + percentage error in b
+ percentage error in c

Note also that these error problems can be taken over directly to problems of small
increases – e.g. the expansion of a rectangular box due to heating, etc. (using coefﬁcients
of linear expansions).

Problem 16.6
If z = x2 Y 5x2y Y 2xy2 −y3 = 4 ﬁnd dy
dx .
We ﬁnd dy
dx by noting that dz = 0, using the total differential, and solving the resulting
equation to obtain a relation between dx and dy which we then solve for dy
dx . Thus
dz = 2x dx + 10xy dx + 5x2 dy + 2y2 dx + 4xy dy −3y2 dy = 0
Dividing by dx gives
2x + 10xy + 5x2 dy
dx + 2y2 + 4xy dy
dx −3y2 dy
dx = 0
and solving for dy
dx gives

dx = 2x + 10xy + 2y2

16.7 Applications
1. Partial differential equations are equations containing partial derivatives – analogous
to ordinary differential equations of Chapter 15. Such equations occur frequently in
495

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
science and engineering. An important example is Laplace’s equation ∂2f
∂x2 + ∂2f
∂y2 = 0
which arises in electromagnetic ﬁeld theory and ﬂuid ﬂow, for example. Verify that
each of the following functions satisﬁes Laplace’s equation
(i)
f (x, y) = ln(x2 + y2)
(ii)
f (x, y) = e−3y cos 3x
(iii)
f (x, y) = ex(x cos y −y sin y)
(iv)
f (x, y) = x2 −y2
2. An important application of the total differential occurs in estimating the change in a
function of a number of variables resulting from changes in the variables. The following
give a number of examples of this.
(i) From the ideal gas law P V = nRT , where nR is constant, estimate the percentage
change in pressure, P , if the temperature, T , is increased by 3% and the volume,
V , is increased by 4%.
(ii) Given that time, T , of oscillation of a simple pendulum of length l is
T = 2π

l
g
determine the total differential dT in terms of l and the gravitational and constant
g. Estimate the percentage error in the period of oscillation if l is taken 0.1% too
large and g 0.05% too small.
(iii) The total resistance of three resistors R1, R2, R3, in parallel is given by R, where
1
R = 1
R1
+ 1
R2
+ 1
R3
If R1, R2, R3, are measured as 6, 8, 12  respectively with respective maximum
tolerances of ±0.1, ±0.03, ±0.15 , estimate the maximum possible error in R.
3. The total derivative is used to determine the rate of change of a function of a number
of variables in terms of the rates of change of the variables. The following examples
illustrate this.
(i) The radius of a cylinder decreases at a rate 0.02 ms−1 while its height increases
at a rate 0.01 ms−1. Find the rate of change of the volume at the instant when
r = 0.05 m and h = 0.2 m.
(ii) Find the rate of increase of the diagonal of a rectangular solid with sides 3, 4, 5 m,
if the sides increase at 1
3, 1
4, 1
5 ms−1 respectively.

An Appreciation of Transform
Methods
17.1 Introduction
We have already met situations in which changing the variable in a mathematical problem
works wonders – as for example in substitution in integration. In fact, this idea of trans-
forming variables to a new set is a useful one throughout applied mathematics. In this
chapter we are going to look at two particular types of transforms that are virtually essential
in engineering and science:
•
Laplace transform
•
Fourier series (transform)
Both serve useful roles in two key engineering topics:
•
the study of initial value problems in control theory, where one is inter-
ested in stability properties of a system
•
harmonic analysis of signals in which a periodic input to a system
is decomposed into sinusoidal components which may be individually
processed and the results recombined to produce the output of the system
Although I will try to explain how the transforms arise, the topic may still require some-
thing of a leap of faith on your part, particularly in the deﬁnitions of the Laplace transform
and the Fourier series. This is a place where accepting the results blindly and understanding
later is not necessarily a bad learning strategy! Also, we will not prove very much in detail.
The priority will be to equip you with the main tools and give you an appreciation of the
concepts and methods. This topic is also useful in that it brings together so much of
the basic mathematical material that we have covered in this book, perhaps justifying
all the hard work put in!

17.2 The Laplace transform
Problem 17.1
Integrate the following, where s and a are constants

te−st dt
Let a →∞in the result, assuming that s > 0.
This integral has a number of features that we need to look at to get us into the mood
for Laplace transforms. Expressions that contain a number of symbols, some constant and
some variable, often appear daunting to the most experienced of us. Just take it steady
and pick the bones out of the thing. Firstly, since a and s are to be regarded as constant
501

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
in doing the integral they play no role in the actual integration (other than getting in the
way!), which is basically an integration with respect to the variable t. If it helps, think of a
and s simply as particular constants, say 3 and 4 respectively, while doing the integration.
Then you can concentrate on the actual job of integration and effectively the problem is to
integrate something like te−4t, for example. This is a classic case of integration by parts
(273
➤
) which you really should revise if you have the slightest doubts. We obtain, on
integrating the exponential ﬁrst,

Don’t let anyone tell you all this is easy! There is a great deal of sophisticated mathematics
to deal with in this problem, and I have spelt it out carefully now because you will need
to do a lot of it later – I wanted to get the main difﬁculties out of the way up front so that
we are not too distracted later on. We will now get down to the main business of deﬁning
the Laplace transform.
In a similar way to how we transform a variable to simplify some mathematical problem
such as integration, we can often similarly transform a function to facilitate the solution
to a differential equation. The most common way to do this is by means of an integral.
Thus, if f (t) is a function of t (it is usual to use t as the independent variable, since in
applications it usually refers to time), then we transform to a new function ˜f (s) of a new
variable s by an expression of the form:
˜f (s) =
 b
a
k(s, t)f (t) dt
The notation ‘f twiddle’, ˜f (s), is a standard mathematical way of reminding us that the
new function of s comes from f , but is completely different to f , which is a function of t.
In Problem 17.1 we had f (t) = t, k(s, t) = e−st, a = 0 and b = ∞, and the integral, which
would correspond to what we have called ˜f (s) here, came out to be 1
s2 . The above integral
expression is called an integral transform. Essentially, it replaces the function f (t) by a
different function ˜f (s), which may be easier to deal with in certain circumstances.
There are many such integral transforms, usually going under the name of some famous
mathematician – Laplace, Fourier, Mellin, Hilbert. The Laplace and Fourier transforms
are particularly useful, in scientiﬁc and engineering applications such as control theory
and signal analysis, and in statistical and commercial applications. I would certainly not
waste your time by introducing such complicated objects if they were not so useful! It is
worth noting that such transforms were often ﬁrst invented and developed by scientists
and engineers, long before mathematicians got their hands on them.
When we consider a transform such as the Laplace transform we are interested in such
questions as:
•
What are the Laplace transforms of the elementary functions?
•
What general properties does the transform have?
•
How does the Laplace transform relate to other mathematical operations
(such as differentiation, integration, etc.)?
•
How can the transform be ‘inverted’, i.e. given the transform ˜f (s) of
a function f (t), how do we reverse the transform and ﬁnd the original
function f (t)?
•
What applications does the Laplace transform have?
We now give the formal deﬁnition of the Laplace transform. We have already looked at
the technical details of integration needed to deal with it, in Problem 17.1, so it should be
less of a shock! Be assured that, strange though it might appear, it is absolutely invaluable
in engineering mathematics.
Suppose f (t) is a function deﬁned for t ≥0. Then the integral

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g

is called the Laplace transform of f .t/. Other notations used are F(s) (lower case goes to
upper case when we transform) or L[f (t)], the square brackets denoting that the Laplace
transform acts on a function. The appearance of the exponential function here should
perhaps come as no surprise when one considers the predominant role that this function
plays in, for example, differential equations.
Note that improper inﬁnite integrals of the type occurring in the deﬁnition above are
deﬁned by:

g(t) dt = lim

and this shows how they are evaluated in practice – i.e. do the integral ﬁrst and then take

17.3 Laplace transforms of the elementary functions
Assembling the Laplace transforms of the elementary functions is simply a matter of inte-
gration. We ﬂagged up the main points in Problem 17.1, and now you can try developing
a table of Laplace transforms for yourself.

L[1] = 0!

L[t] = 1!

L[t2] = 2!
s3 ,
L[t3] = 3!

where we have used the convention 0! = 1 (16

), which we also used in the binomial
theorem. These results lead us to suspect that in general
L[tn] =
n!
sn+1
for n a positive integer. In fact this is a correct generalisation, although we will not prove it.
Proceeding as in the above, exercising your integration, you can if you wish verify the
results given in Table 17.1 for the Laplace transforms of the elementary functions (see
Exercises on this section and page 285). There are a number of points to note:
•
the restrictions on s, which we have assumed to be real
•
results involving the exponential function, which clearly has the effect
of replacing s by s −a – i.e. of shifting or translating s
•
the results for t sin ωt, t cos ωt can be obtained by differentiation of
those for sin ωt, cos ωt with respect to ω.
Note an important implication of the fact that the Laplace transform is deﬁned by an
integral. Speciﬁcally, recall that in any mathematical operation, such as differentiation for
example, there are precise conditions under which the operations are allowed – for example
a function must be continuous at a point if it is to be differentiable there. On the other hand
an integrable function does not have to be continuous in order to integrate it, meaning that
we can apply the Laplace transform to a wider range of functions than continuous ones.
A large and important class of functions to which we can apply the Laplace transform
includes the class of piecewise continuous functions. A piecewise continuous function
f (t) on an interval a ≤t ≤b is a function which consists of continuous sections separated
by a ﬁnite number of isolated points at which the function may not be continuous, but the

sections separately.
A well known example of a piecewise continuous function is the unit (or Heaviside)

This is discontinuous at t = 1, 2, 3, etc. and as the name suggests is a periodic function.
The ideal tool for dealing with such functions is Fourier series, which again involves an
integration that smoothes things out.
Integral transforms can also deal with functions that may be continuous but have discon-
tinuous slope, such as the saw-tooth wave shown in Figure 17.3. In this case the derivative
fails to exist at the ‘corners’, and yet it still has a Fourier series. Such functions are called
piecewise smooth.

17.4 Properties of the Laplace transform
Having seen how to obtain elementary Laplace transforms we now turn to the general
properties of the transform. These enable us to calculate more complicated transforms and
also to apply the Laplace transform to such things as differential equations. We will not
be very rigorous about the proofs, the emphasis being on getting across the key ideas.
1. The Laplace transform is linear
The Laplace transform is a linear operation. That is, if f (t), g(t) are two functions with
Laplace transforms ˜f (s), ˜g(s) and a, b are constants then
L[af (t) + bg(t)] = aL[f (t)] + bL[g(t)]
= a ˜f (s) + b ˜g(s)
Or, brieﬂy:
Laplace transform of sum = sum of Laplace transforms.
2. The first shift theorem
The exponential function eat is a mainstay of applied mathematics, and it plays a partic-
ularly special role in the theory of the Laplace transform, embodied in the ﬁrst shift
theorem (in case you are wondering, there is a ‘second shift theorem’ but we won’t be
needing it in this book).
Suppose L[f (t)] = ˜f (s) for s > s0, and let a be any real number. Then
L[eatf (t)] = ˜f (s −a)
for
s > s0 + a
This can be proved by coupling the eat in the Laplace transform with the est and noting
that this effectively replaces s by s −a.
Note that the results for eattn, eat sin ωt, eat cos ωt given in Table 17.1 can be obtained
using the shift theorem.
3. The Laplace transformof the derivative
This is the crucial property for the application of Laplace transforms to the solution
of differential equations. Suppose that f (t) and its derivative f ′(t) have Laplace trans-
forms. Then
L[f ′(t)] = sL[f (t)] −f (0)
This follows on integrating by parts:
L[f ′(t)] =
 ∞
0
f ′(t)e−stdt
= [f (t)e−st]∞
0 + s
 ∞

f (t)e−stdt

on assuming that the limit at inﬁnity vanishes.

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Note how differentiation with respect to t in ‘t-space’ becomes multiplication by s in
‘s-space’. Also, note the appearance of the initial value, f (0), of f (t). This makes the
Laplace transform particularly suitable for solving initial value problems. We transform a
differential equation from t-space to s-space, thereby obtaining an algebraic equation for
the Laplace transform of the solution. We solve this algebraic equation to get the Laplace
transform of the solution of the differential equation, which we then invert, going back
to t-space to get the solution as a function of t. This methodology is characteristic of
‘transform methods’ in mathematics, whatever the particular type of transform.
We can now derive the Laplace transform of the second order derivative.
Problem 17.5
Show that
L[f ′′.t/] = s2L[f .t/] −sf .0/ −f ′.0/
We only have to apply the derivative rule twice in succession:
L[f ′′(t)] = sL[f ′(t)] −f ′(0)
= s(sL[f (t)] −f (0)) −f ′(0)
= s2L[f (t)] −sf (0) −f ′(0)
The general result for the Laplace transform of the nth derivative is
L[f (n)(t)] = snL[f (t)] −sn−1f (0) −sn−2f ′(0) −· · · −sf (n−2)(0) −f (n−1)(0)
Note again the occurrence of the initial values.
To see how we can use the Laplace transform to solve initial value problems, consider
the following problem.
Problem 17.6
Solve the initial value problem
y′ Y y = 1
y.0/ = 0
as follows: take the Laplace transform of the equation and obtain an equa-
tion for the Laplace transform ˜y.s/ of y. Solve this equation. By taking the
Laplace transform of the solution found by, say, separation of variables,
conﬁrm that ˜y.s/ is the Laplace transform of the solution y.t/.
Taking the Laplace transform of the equation gives, using linearity and the derivative rule
L[y′ + y] = L[y′] + L[y] = L[1]
or
s ˜y(s) −y(0) + ˜y(s) = 1
s
510

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
Since y(0) = 0 this becomes
(s + 1)˜y(s) = 1
s
Solving for ˜y(s) now gives
˜y(s) =
1
s(s + 1)
Now by separation of variables (454
➤
), or integrating factor (458
➤
), the solution of the
initial value problem is
y(t) = 1 −e−t
Taking the Laplace transform of this:
L[y(t)] = L[1 −e−t]
= 1
s −
1
s + 1
=
1
s(s + 1) = ˜y(s)
which is indeed the Laplace transform of the solution as obtained above. So the Laplace
transform of the equation did lead us to the Laplace transform of the solution. In fact,
in this case it is not too difﬁcult to ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform of ˜y(s) directly.

If ˜f (s) is some function of the Laplace transform variable s, then that function f (t) whose
Laplace transform is ˜f (s) is called the inverse Laplace transform of ˜f (s) and is denoted:
f (t) = L−1[ ˜f (s)]
Crudely, we may think of L−1 as ‘undoing’ the Laplace transform operation.
Table 17.1 gives a number of important inverse transforms, simply by reading it from
right to left.

17.6 Solution of initial value problems by Laplace
transform
The inverse Laplace transform enables us to solve linear initial value problems. With what
you now know about the inverse transform, try this on your own.
Problem 17.8
Solve the initial value problem
y′ Y y = 1
y.0/ = 1
by Laplace transform.
Taking the Laplace transform of the equation:
L[y′ + y] = L[y′] + L[y]
= s ˜y(s) −y(0) + ˜y(s)
= (s + 1)˜y(s) −1 = L[1] = 1
s
Hence
˜y(s) = 1
s
so the solution is
y(t) = 1
which you can check by direct solution of the equation.
The above example illustrates the general approach to solving linear initial value prob-
lems by Laplace transform:

2. Solve for the transform of the solution, obtaining
˜y(s) = f (s)
3. Invert this transform to obtain the solution
y(t) = L−1[f (s)]
Note an important feature of the Laplace transform method concerning initial conditions.
In most elementary methods for solving differential equations we ﬁrst ﬁnd the general
solution, involving the appropriate number of arbitrary constants. These constants are then
found by applying the initial or boundary values, producing a number of equations which
are solved for the constants. In the Laplace (and other) transform method however the initial
conditions are automatically included, and there is no need to ﬁnd the general solution.
The extension of this method to second and higher order initial value problems is
conceptually simple and merely requires more complicated manipulation and inversion.
Problem 17.9
Solve the initial value problem
y′′ Y y = 0
y.0/ = 1,
y′.0/ = 0
by Laplace transform.
Taking the Laplace transform through the equation and applying the initial conditions gives
L[y′′] + L[y] = (s2 + 1)˜y −s = 0
Hence

17.7 Linear systems and the principle of superposition
Before we move on to a different type of transform, we will look brieﬂy at the sort of
systems for which it is used. Consider a system whose response to a time dependent
input x(t) is an output y(t). The system is called linear if the output of the sum of two
inputs is the sum of the separate outputs to the two inputs. That is, if x1(t) →y1(t) and
y2(t) →y2(t) implies x1(t) + x2(t) →y1(t) + y2(t).
Many, but not all, systems behave in this way – any that do not are called non-linear
and are very difﬁcult to analyse. This additivity of outputs of linear systems is called the
principle of superposition.
If a complicated signal can be split up into a linear combination of simpler signals then
the effect of a linear processing system on the total signal can be analysed by adding up
the separate effects on the component input signals. This is the philosophy behind Fourier
analysis. A Fourier series splits a periodic input (such as a square wave) into a sum of
sinusoidal components of different amplitude and frequency. The effect of a linear system
on each separate sinusoid is easy to determine in general and the separate outputs can
be added up to synthesize the total output corresponding to the original periodic interval.
This is illustrated in Figure 17.5.

We will now summarise some terminology for a general sinusoidal function:
f (t) = A sin(ωt + α)
A is called the amplitude, ω the angular frequency (radians per second) and α is the
phase relative to A sin ωt. The period of such a sinusoid is T = 2π/ω. The inverse of T ,
ω/2π, is the frequency in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). See Figure 17.6.
Linear operations such as differentiation, integration, addition, etc. change the amplitude
and phase of such a sinusoid, but not its frequency. For example
d
dt [A sin(ωt + α)] = Aω cos(ωt + α)
= Aω sin(ωt + α + π/2)
which has the same frequency as the original, but a modiﬁed amplitude and phase.

17.8 Orthogonality relations for trigonometric
functions
In the process of expressing a general waveform of a given period in terms of sinusoids of
given frequency – the object of Fourier analysis – we will need certain integral formulae.
These are so important that we devote this whole section to them. Make sure that you
fully understand what they mean, and can derive them (285
➤
). We will only consider
integrals and sinusoids deﬁned over a period of 2π, usually taken to be −π to π. This is
no real restriction – if we have a region of different length then we can simply scale it to
2π. Our integrals concern products of sines and cosines over the range −π to π.

the integrals may in fact be replaced by any integral of length 2π, or integer multiple of
2π. The orthogonality relations should not be thought of as simply speciﬁc integral rela-
tions – many other functions satisfy similar orthogonality relations (often called special,
or orthogonal functions) and can be used in a similar way to expand in a ‘generalised
Fourier series’.
Exercise on 17.8
Prove the orthogonality relations.
17.9 The Fourier series expansion
A Fourier series is essentially a means of expressing any periodic function f (t) as a sum
(possibly inﬁnite) of sines or cosines of different frequencies. The point is of course that
sine and cosine are relatively simple functions to deal with.
Let f (t) be a function with period 2π. It may be a square wave, or triangular wave,
for example. If we compare it with a sine or cosine wave with the same period there may
be little resemblance, on the face of it. However, it turns out that if we combine a large
enough number of sine and/or cosine waves of appropriate amplitudes and frequencies
then it is possible, under certain conditions, to approximate to any function of period
2π. This is certainly not obvious, but is mathematically well established and so here we
will simply assume that f (t) can be expanded in a series of sines and cosines in the
form
f (t) = a0
2 +
∞
	
n=1
an cos nt +
∞
	
n=1
bn sin nt
This is called a Fourier (series) expansion for f (t). Note that each term on the right-
hand side has period 2π, like f (t), but as n increases cos nt and sin nt oscillate an
517

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
increasing number of times in this period. The above series is therefore adding together a
(possibly inﬁnite) number of different oscillatory functions, with different amplitudes or
weighting. The hope is that by suitably choosing these weightings, one can approximate
any other function of the same period, 2π. The problem is of course to ﬁnd the appropriate
‘weightings’ or coefﬁcients, a0, an, bn for any given function f (t).
The notation in the above series is conventional, as is the factor
1
2 with a0, which
simpliﬁes later results. a0, an, bn are constants which will depend upon f (t) and which
are to be determined.
Particularly in the case of time dependent periodic functions, it is usual to speak of the
n = 1 term in the Fourier decomposition as the ‘fundamental component’ (it is often the
dominant one) and the nth term (n > 1) as the nth harmonic.
As an example of a Fourier series, consider the square wave period of 2π and amplitude
A, shown in Figure 17.7.

Figure 17.7
This can be described by the function
f (t) =
−A
−π < t < 0
A
0 < t < π
f (t + 2π) = f (t)
Mathematically this is a difﬁcult functional form to handle and to process – for example
we cannot differentiate it, and if it appeared as a ‘forcing function’ (469
➤
) in a differential
equation then there is not a lot we could do with it as it is. However, the fact that it is
periodic with period 2π does mean that we can express it as a superposition of sinusoids
of the same period – i.e. as a Fourier series. We will show in Section 17.10 that the
corresponding Fourier series is in fact
f (t) = 4A
π

sin t + 1
3 sin 3t + 1
5 sin 5t + . . .

The amplitude of the nth harmonic is 4A
nπ . Now although this series looks nothing like
the original functional form of the square wave it is in fact equivalent to it. If you have
a graphical calculator you might like to try plotting each of the harmonics and the sum
of the ﬁrst few. You will see that the result starts to look like a humpy square wave, and
gets more and more like it as you take more and more terms in the series. The whole
point of course is that the sinusoidal functions to which we have converted the wave are
continuous and far easier to handle than the original discontinuous form. There are, it is
true, now an inﬁnite number of them – but as with all such series we can get as good an
approximation as we please by taking enough terms in the series.

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
There are a number of points that are worth noting, although we do not want to be too
picky at this stage, so treat these as reﬁnements for (much) later assimilation.
(i) At a discontinuity (e.g. at t = 0 in the above example) the Fourier series gives the
’average value’:
1
2[f−(t0) + f+(t0)]
where f−(t0) denotes the limiting value of f (t) as t approaches the discontinuity at
t = t0 from below, f+(t0) denotes the limit as t approaches from above.
(ii) The Fourier series of an even function can contain only the constant and the cosine
terms, because cosine is an even function. The Fourier series of an odd function can
contain only the sine terms, since sine is odd.
(iii) Interesting results for inﬁnite series can be deduced from Fourier series. In the above
example, putting t = π/2 gives:

(iv) While the Fourier series represents a periodic function, it can be used to represent
a non-periodic function just over one period if required. For example the square
wave considered above can be represented by a Fourier series over just one period
−π < t < π.

17.10 The Fourier coefﬁcients
There are, in general, an inﬁnite number of the coefﬁcients an, bn of the Fourier series.
So we cannot expect to determine them ‘all at once’. We had a similar situation with
power series in Section 14.11 (435
➤
). There we found the coefﬁcients one at a time by
successive differentiation to remove all terms except the one that we wanted to determine
at each stage. Such an approach won’t work in this case because no matter how many
times you differentiate a sinusoidal function, it won’t go away! However, the integral
formulae or ‘orthogonality relations’ given in Section 17.8 can serve a similar purpose in
enabling us to eliminate all coefﬁcients except the one we want, one at a time. We do this
by multiplying through by cos nt or sin nt, integrating over a single period and using the
orthogonality relations to remove all but the desired coefﬁcient. An example will illustrate
this more clearly.
Suppose we want to ﬁnd a3 in the series
f (t) = a0
2 +
∞
	
n=1
an cos nt +
∞
	
n=1
bn sin nt
Multiply through by cos 3t, the sinusoid that goes with a3, and integrate over (−π, π)
(any interval of length 2π will do). By the orthogonality relations of Section 17.8 every
resulting integral on the right-hand side of the series will vanish except that corresponding
to cos 3t itself, and we will obtain
 π

f (t) cos(3t) dt = a3

Verify the series for the square wave given in Section 17.9.
We have

f (t) = a0
2 +
∞
	
n=1
an cos nt +
∞
	
n=1
bn sin nt
Also, since the function is odd it can’t contain any even terms in the series, so we can
take all an = 0, and write the series as
f (t) =
∞
	
n=1
bn sin nt
We therefore have to ﬁnd the bn.

17.12 Applications
Transform methods form a vast area of engineering mathematics, and this chapter only
scratches the surface. In these applications we just ﬂag up some of the key fundamental
ideas which may come up in your engineering subjects.
1. One of the most important applications of Laplace transforms in engineering is in
the solution of initial value problems of the sort discussed in Chapter 15. Particularly
important are the sorts of engineering models described by inhomogeneous second order
differential equations of the type covered in Chapter 15, Applications, question 6:
m¨x + β ˙x + αx = f (t)
In Chapter 15 we solved this type of equation by the auxiliary equation and the method
of undetermined coefﬁcients. In the case when we have initial conditions, specifying
x and ˙x at t = 0, the Laplace transform provides a powerful tool for solving such
524

U n d e r s t a n d i n g
E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
equations and studying the properties of the solutions. This question is a signiﬁcant
project in which you are asked to repeat as much of the Chapter 15, Applications,
Question 6 as you can using Laplace transform methods.
Show that with zero initial conditions (i.e. a system that is initially at rest) the Laplace
transform of x(t) can be written
L[x(t)] = ˜x(s) =
˜f (s)
ms2 + βs + α
where ˜f (s) is the Laplace transform of the right-hand side f (t).
Find the solutions x(t) for the constant forcing function
f (t) = F0H(t)
(H(t) the unit stepfunction)
for various values of m, β, α, considering cases of real, equal and complex roots of
the quadratic.
Consider also the sinusoidal forcing function
f (t) = f0 cos υt
and compare your solutions with the results of Chapter 15, Applications, Question 6.
2. The sorts of equations considered in question 1 are often used to describe a control
system in which x(t) represents the response or output of the system to an input f (t).
In this case the Laplace transform of the equation plays an important role in control
theory, and the connection between the Laplace transform of the input to that of the
output is called the transfer function of the system, denoted F(s). We write:
˜x(s) = F(s) ˜f (s)
So, for example the transfer function of the system described in question 1 would take
the form
F(s) =
1
ms2 + βs + α
The stability of the control system depends crucially on the poles of the transfer
function – that is the roots of the denominator, ms2 + βs + α, in this case. Control
systems can obviously be of great complexity, and a particularly important feature
is that of feedback. A control system has feedback when the output or some other
signal is fed back to the input as a means of inﬂuencing the behaviour of the control
system. A simple example is shown in Figure 17.8. Here, the input xi(t) is modiﬁed
by subtraction of a feedback xf (t) to form xi(t) −xf (t) which is input to the control
system which has transfer function G(s). The feedback xf (t) is formed by a modifying
control system that converts the output xo(t) to xf (t) with a transfer function F(s), thus
forming a feedback loop. If ˜xi(s) and ˜xo(s) are respectively the Laplace transforms of
the input and output, show that the overall transfer function of the feedback system is
G(s)
1 + F(s)G(s)
525

Figure 17.8
By such means we can derive the transfer functions for ever more complex control
systems. Many linear control systems have a transfer function that is a rational function.
Show that if F(s) and G(s) are rational functions then so is the overall transfer function
derived above. Discuss the poles of the overall transfer function in terms of those of
the F(s) and G(s). Essentially, the study of the stability of a control system reduces
to the study of the poles of such transfer functions – this is where all the work we did
on rational functions in Chapter 2 comes in handy.
3. We have already emphasised the use of Fourier series in, for example, breaking up
periodic signals into sinusoidal components that are more easily analysed and then
recombined in a linear system. No doubt you will see more of this in your engineering
subjects, whether it be in the analysis of coupled dynamical systems, heat transfer in
solid bodies, or analysis of electronic and optical signalling systems. Here we look at
a use of Fourier series in providing a succinct expression for the power in a periodic
signal.
The average power in a periodic signal x(t) (assumed to be of period 2π) is
deﬁned by
P = 1
2π

If the signal can be expressed as a Fourier series in the form

show that the average power can be written as

This is a particular case of a famous mathematical result called Parseval’s theorem,
and the general principle it expresses is a key principle of the study of any sort of

E n g i n e e r i n g
M a t h e m a t i c s
periodic motion – the energy/power in any periodic phenomenon is proportional to the
sum of the squares of the amplitudes of the sinusoidal components. If this reminds you
of Pythagoras’ theorem, well . . .
