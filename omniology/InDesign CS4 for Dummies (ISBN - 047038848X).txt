Dedication
To the talented designers I’ve had the pleasure of working with over the 
years, who have shown me what real artists can do to engage readers effec-
tively and creatively: Kevin Reagan, Dennis McLeod, Sylvia Chevrier, Tim 
Johnson, Arne Hurty, Richard Merchán, Peter Tucker, and John Anane-Sefah.
Author’s Acknowledgments
Thanks are due to several people for making this book the best guide pos-
sible for InDesign beginners and those wanting a quick tour of the program: 
Barbara Assadi was co-author of several previous versions of this book, and 
some of her valuable contributions remain in this edition. Similarly, Jonathan 
Woolson was tech reviewer on previous versions of this book, and several 
how-to suggestions based on his production savvy also remain for your 
benefi t. Thanks are also due to the current edition’s editor, Kelly Ewing, for 
making the book as clear and direct as possible. Most of the photographs you 
see in this book’s example layouts were taken by Ingall W. Bull III (and used 
with permission). Last, thanks are due to the many talented people at Adobe 
who continue to refi ne InDesign to the advantage of us all.

InDesign CS4 For Dummies

Introduction
W
hat is Adobe InDesign, and what can it do for you? In its more than a 
decade in existence, InDesign has become the most powerful publish-
ing application, one that lets you work the way you want to work. You can 
use InDesign as a free-form but manual approach to layout, or as a structured 
but easily revised approach. The fact that you can choose which way to 
work is important for both novice and experienced users because there is no 
single, correct way to lay out pages. Sometimes (for example, if your project 
is a one-time publication, such as an ad), creating a layout from scratch — 
almost as if you were doing it by hand on paper — is the best approach. And 
sometimes using a highly formatted template that you can modify as needed 
is the way to go: You don’t need to reinvent the wheel for documents that 
have a structured and repeatable format, such as books and magazines.
InDesign can handle sophisticated tasks, such as glossy magazines and 
high-impact ads, but its structured approach to publishing also makes it a 
good choice for newspapers, newsletters, and books. InDesign is also a good 
choice for corporate publishing tasks, such as proposals and annual reports. 
In all cases, you can design for printing on paper or electronic distribution as 
Adobe Acrobat Portable Document Format (PDF) files. Plug-in software from 
other vendors adds extra capabilities.
Plus, you can use InDesign as the starting point for Web and Flash docu-
ments. These electronic documents can include interactive features, such as 
page transitions, hyperlinks, and buttons to play sounds or a movie.
About This Book
After you get the hang of it, InDesign is quite easy to use. At the same time, 
it’s a powerful publishing program with a strong following among the ranks 
of professional publishers — and the latest InDesign CS4 version is certain to 
reinforce that position. Part of its success is due to the fact that its interface 
is like that of its sister applications, Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, 
which are also components of the Adobe Creative Suite.
If you’re just getting started with InDesign, welcome! I hope you’ll find the 
information in these pages to be helpful in getting you started.

InDesign CS4 For Dummies 
Conventions Used in This Book
This book covers InDesign on both Macintosh and Windows. Because the 
application is almost identical on both platforms, I point out platform-
specific information only when it’s different — and that’s very rare. I’ve used 
Macintosh screen shots throughout; Windows screen shots are usually iden-
tical, except for the dialog boxes to open, save, and export files — these are 
arranged differently on Macs and PCs (for all programs, not just InDesign), 
but the relevant options to InDesign are the same. If you’re a Windows user, 
a quick look at Adobe’s documentation, which shows Windows screens, can 
show you how the interfaces are nearly identical. So don’t worry about them.
Here are some other conventions used in this book:
 
 Menu commands: They’re listed like this: Window➪Pages. That means 
go to the Window menu and choose the Pages option from it. In almost 
every case, the menu command sequences are the same for Mac and 
Windows users; in a very few cases, they differ (such as the Preferences 
menu option and the Configure Plug-ins menu option), so I note these 
differences where they exist by putting the Mac menu sequence first and 
then the Windows one.
 
 InDesign CS4 has an annoying new feature of hiding menu options 
from you. The goal is to be less intimidating, but it also means that if 
you don’t know what InDesign can do, you won’t find out by looking 
at the menus. Fortunately, you can tell InDesign to show you all the 
menus all the time so that no features are hidden. Here’s how: Choose 
Window➪Workspace➪Show Full Menus. This book assumes you’ve 
turned the menus all on.
 
 Key combinations: If you’re supposed to press several keys together, I 
indicate that by placing a plus sign (+) between them. Thus, Shift+Ô+A 
means press and hold the Shift and Ô keys and then press A. After 
you’ve pressed the A key, let go of all the keys. I also use the plus sign to 
join keys to mouse movements. For example, Alt+drag means to hold the 
Alt key when dragging the mouse.
 
 Note that the Macintosh sequence comes first, followed by the Windows 
equivalent.
 
 Pointer: The small graphic icon that moves on the screen as you move 
your mouse is a pointer (also called a cursor). The pointer takes on dif-
ferent shapes depending on the tool you select, the current location of 
the mouse, and the function you are performing.
 
 Click: This means to quickly press and release the mouse button once. 
Many Mac mice have only one button, but some have two or more. All 
PC mice have at least two buttons. If you have a multibutton mouse, 
click the leftmost button when I say to click the mouse.

3
 Introduction
 
 Double-click: This tells you to quickly press and release the mouse 
button twice. On some multibutton mice, one of the buttons can func-
tion as a double-click. (You click it once, but the computer acts as if you 
clicked twice.) If your mouse has this feature, use it; it saves strain on 
your hand.
 
 Right-click: A feature first implemented on Windows, but present on 
Macs since the late 1990s, this means to click the right-hand mouse 
button. If your Mac has only one button, hold the Control key when 
clicking the mouse button to do the equivalent of right-clicking in pro-
grams that support it. Mac OS X automatically assigns the right-hand 
button on a multibutton mouse to the Control+click combination; if your 
mouse came with its own System Preference, you can often further cus-
tomize the button actions.
 
 Dragging: Dragging is used for moving and sizing items in an InDesign 
document. To drag an item, position the mouse pointer on the item, 
press and hold down the mouse button, and then slide the mouse across 
a flat surface.
What You’re Not to Read
 
If you see any text in this book that has this icon next to it, feel free to skip 
right over to the next paragraph. This icon alerts you to geeky information 
that you don’t need to know to use InDesign. I just couldn’t help giving you a 
little extra-credit information in case you were a budding geek like me.
Foolish Assumptions
Although this book has information that any level of layout artist or produc-
tion editor needs to know to use InDesign, this book is primarily for those of 
you who are fairly new to the field, or who are just becoming familiar with the 
program. I try to take the mystery out of InDesign and give you guidance on 
how to create a bunch of different types of documents.
I don’t assume that you’ve ever used InDesign (or any publishing program). But I 
do assume that you have a basic knowledge of Macintosh or Windows — enough 
to work with files and applications. And I assume that you have basic familiarity 
with layout design, such as knowing what pages, margins, and fonts are. But I 
don’t expect you to be an expert in any of these areas — nor do you have to be!

InDesign CS4 For Dummies 
How This Book Is Organized
This book contains eight parts. I also include some bonus content on the 
InDesignCentral Web site (www.InDesignCentral.com).
Part I: Before You Begin
Designing a document is a combination of science and art. The science is in 
setting up the structure of the page: How many places will hold text, and how 
many will hold graphics? How wide will the margins be? Where will the page 
numbers appear? You get the idea. The art is in coming up with creative ways 
of filling the structure to please your eyes and the eyes of the people who will 
be looking at your document.
In this part, I tell you how to navigate your way around InDesign using the 
program’s menus, dialog boxes, panels, and panes. I also explain how to cus-
tomize the preferences to your needs.
Part II: Document Essentials
Good publishing technique is about more than just getting the words down 
on paper. It’s also about opening, saving, adding, deleting, numbering, and 
setting layout guidelines for documents. This part shows you how to do all 
that and a lot more, including tips on setting up master pages that you can 
use over and over again. You also find out how to create color swatches for 
easy reuse in your documents.
Part III: Object Essentials
This part of the book shows you how to work with objects: the lines, text 
frames, graphics frames, and other odds and ends that make up a publica-
tion. You also discover how to apply some really neat special effects to them.
Part IV: Text Essentials
When you think about it, text is a big deal when it comes to publishing docu-
ments. After all, how many people would want to read a book with nothing 
but pictures? In this part, I show you how to create and manipulate text, in 
more ways than you can even imagine.

5
 Introduction
Part V: Graphics Essentials
Very few people would want to read a book with nothing but text, so this part 
is where I show you how to handle graphics in InDesign — both importing 
them from the outside and creating your own within InDesign.
Part VI: Getting Down to Business
InDesign is really good at handling the many kinds of documents that tend 
to be used in businesses, such as manuals, annual reports, and catalogs. 
This part shows you how to create tables, handle footnotes, create indexes, 
manage page numbering across multiple chapters in a book, and use text 
variables to make InDesign update text as needed based on the document’s 
current context.
Part VII: Printing and 
Multimedia Essentials
Whether you’re printing a publication or simply creating a PDF file for read-
ers to download from a Web site, you still need to understand the basics of 
outputting an InDesign document. This part is where I show you how to set up 
your output files, manage color, and work with service bureaus. You also find 
out about creating multimedia documents — those with movies, sound, hyper-
links, and buttons — for distribution as PDF files, Flash files, and Web pages.
Part VIII: The Part of Tens
This part of the book is like the chips in the chocolate chip cookies; you can 
eat the cookies without them, but you’d be missing a really good part. It’s a 
part that shows you some important resources that can help you make the 
most of InDesign.
Icons Used in This Book
So that you can pick out parts that you really need to pay attention to (or, 
depending on your taste, to avoid), I use some symbols, or icons, in this book.
 
When you see this icon, it means I am pointing out a feature that’s new to 
InDesign CS4.

6
InDesign CS4 For Dummies 
 
If you see this icon, it means that I’m mentioning some really nifty point or 
idea that you may want to keep in mind as you use the program.
 
This icon lets you know something you’ll want to keep in mind. If you forget it 
later, that’s fine, but if you remember it, it will make your InDesign life a little 
easier.
 
If you skip all the other icons, pay attention to this one. Why? Because ignor-
ing it can cause something really, really bad or embarrassing to happen, like 
when you were sitting in your second-grade classroom waiting for the teacher 
to call on you to answer a question, and you noticed that you still had your 
pajama shirt on. I don’t want that to happen to you!
 
This icon tells you that I am about to pontificate on some remote technical bit 
of information that may help explain a feature in InDesign. The technical info 
will definitely make you sound impressive if you memorize it and recite it to 
your friends.
Where to Go from Here
If you’re a complete beginner, I suggest you read the book’s parts in the 
order I present them. If you haven’t used InDesign before but you have used 
other layout programs, do read Part I first to get in the InDesign frame of 
mind and then explore other parts in any order you want. If you have used 
InDesign before, peruse them in any order you want, to see what’s changed.
As you gain comfort with InDesign, you’ll be surprised how much you can 
do with it. And when you’re ready to discover more, take advantage of the 
wealth of resources out there to go the next level. The InDesignCentral Web 
site (www.InDesignCentral.com) can help you do that.

Part I
Before You Begin

In this part . . .
Y
ou have your copy of InDesign, and you’d like some 
basic information on how to get started, right? Well, 
you’ve come to the right place. This part helps you sail 
smoothly through InDesign and gives you a general idea of 
what InDesign can do. I explain the layout approaches you 
can take, as well as how to set up InDesign to work the 
way you work. 
Along the way, you find out how to navigate the plethora 
of panels, menus, tools, and shortcuts that can seem over-
whelming at first, but which soon become second nature 
as you gain experience using the program. Welcome 
aboard!

Ingredients
In This Chapter
 Getting acquainted with the InDesign approach
 Figuring out global versus local control
 Getting up to speed on the InDesign vocabulary
 Exploring the document window
 Surveying the top tools
 Becoming familiar with tools and panels
 Discovering what’s in the menus
S
tarting to use a new software application is not unlike meeting a new 
friend for the first time. You take a long look at the person, maybe ask a 
few questions, and begin the process of becoming acquainted. (If you’re not 
new to InDesign but are new to the CS4 version, it’s like seeing a friend you 
haven’t seen in a while — you observe any changes and catch up on what’s 
happened in the meantime.)
Just as it’s worthwhile to find out the likes and dislikes of a new friend, it’s 
also worth your time to wrap your head around InDesign’s unique style 
and approaches. When you do so, you’ll find it much easier to start using 
InDesign to get work done.
This chapter explains where to look in InDesign for the features and capabili-
ties you need to master. (For a quick look at what’s new to version CS4, check 
out Chapter 25.) I introduce you to the process that InDesign assumes you 
use when laying out documents, explain some of the terms you’ll encounter 
throughout the book, describe the unique interface elements in the document 
window, survey the most commonly used tools, and explain how InDesign 
packages much of its functionality through an interface element called a panel.

Part I: Before You Begin 
 
InDesign CS4 has an annoying new feature of hiding menu options from you. 
The goal is to be less intimidating, but it also means if you don’t know what 
InDesign can do, you won’t find out by looking at the menus. Fortunately, you 
can tell InDesign to show you all the menus all the time, so no features are 
hidden. Here’s how: Choose Window➪Workspace➪Show Full Menus. This 
book assumes that you’ve turned the menus all on.
Understanding Global and Local Control
The power of desktop publishing in general, and InDesign in particular, is 
that it lets you automate time-consuming layout and typesetting tasks while 
at the same time letting you customize each step of the process according to 
your needs.
What does that mean in practice? That you can use global controls to estab-
lish general settings for layout elements, and then use local controls to 
modify those elements to meet specific requirements. The key to using global 
and local tools effectively is to know when each is appropriate.
Global tools include
 
 General preferences and application preferences (see Chapter 2)
 
 Master pages and libraries (see Chapter 5)
 
 Character and paragraph styles (see Chapter 13)
 
 Table and cell styles (see Chapter 19)
 
 Object styles (see Chapter 9)
 
 Sections and page numbers (see Chapter 4)
 
 Color definitions (see Chapter 6)
 
 Hyphenation and justification (see Chapter 14)
Styles and master pages are the two main global settings that you can expect 
to override locally throughout a document. You shouldn’t be surprised to 
make such changes often because although the layout and typographic 
functions that styles and master pages automate are the fundamental com-
ponents of any document’s look, they don’t always work for all the specific 
content within a publication. (If they did, who’d need human designers?!)
Local tools include
 
 Frame tools (see Part III, as well as Chapter 16)
 
 Character and paragraph tools (see Chapters 14 and 15)
 
 Graphics tools (see Part V)

11
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
Choosing the right tools for the job
Depending on what you’re trying to do with InDesign at any given moment, 
you may or may not immediately know which tool to use. If, for example, you 
maintain fairly precise layout standards throughout a document, using master 
pages is the way to keep your work in order. Using styles is the best solution if 
you want to apply standard character and paragraph formatting throughout a 
document. When you work with one-of-a-kind documents, on the other hand, 
designing master pages and styles doesn’t make much sense — it’s easier just 
to format elements as you create them.
For example, you can create drop caps (large initial letters set into a paragraph 
of type, such as the drop cap that starts each chapter in this book) as a charac-
ter option in the Character panel, or you can create a paragraph style (format-
ting that you can apply to whole paragraphs, ensuring that the same formatting 
is applied each time) that contains the drop-cap settings and then apply that 
style to the paragraph containing the drop cap. Which method you choose 
depends on the complexity of your document and how often you need to 
perform the action. The more often you find yourself taking a set of steps, the 
more often you should use a global tool (like character and paragraph styles) 
to accomplish the task.
Fortunately, you don’t need to choose between global and local tools while 
you’re in the middle of designing a document. You can always create styles 
from existing local formatting later. You can also add elements to a master 
page if you start to notice that you need them to appear on every page.
Keep your bearings straight
A powerful but confusing capability in InDesign 
is something called a control point. InDesign 
lets you work with objects from nine different 
reference points — any of the four corners, the 
middle of any of the four sides, or the center — 
such as when positioning the object precisely 
or rotating the object. You choose the active 
reference point, or control point, in the Control 
panel or Transform panel, using the grid of nine 
points arranged in a square.
By default, InDesign uses the central reference 
point as the control point, which is great for 
rotating an object, but can lead to confusion 
when you enter in the X and Y coordinates to 
place it precisely. That’s because most people 
use the upper-left corner of an object when 
specifying its coordinates, not the center of 
the object. Be sure to change the control point 
to the upper-left reference point whenever 
entering X and Y coordinates in the Control or 
Transform panels.
How do you change the control point? That’s 
easy: Just click the desired reference point 
in that preview grid. The control point will be 
black, whereas the other reference points will 
be white.

12
Part I: Before You Begin 
Specifying measurement values
Another situation in which you can choose between local or global controls is 
specifying measurement values. Regardless of the default measurement unit you 
set (that is, the measurement unit that appears in all dialog boxes and panels), 
you can use any unit when entering measurements in an InDesign dialog box. For 
example, if the default measurement is picas, but you’re new to publishing and are 
more comfortable working in inches, go ahead and enter measurements in inches.
InDesign accepts any of the following codes for measurement units. (Chapter 
2 explains how to change the default measurements.) Note that the x in the 
following items indicates where you specify the value, such as 2i for 2 inches. 
It doesn’t matter whether you put a space between the value and the code: 
Typing 2inch and typing 2 inch are the same as far as InDesign is concerned:
 
 xi or x inch or x" (for inches)
 
 xp (for picas)
 
 xpt or 0px (for points)
 
 xc (for ciceros, a European newspaper measurement
 
 xag (for agates, an American newspaper measurement)
 
 xcm (for centimeters)
 
 xmm (for millimeters)
 
You can enter fractional picas in two ways: in decimal format (as in 8.5p) and in 
picas and points (as in 8p6). Either of these settings results in a measurement of 
8
1⁄2 picas. (A pica contains12 points.)
What to do when you make a mistake
InDesign is a very forgiving program. If you 
make a mistake, change your mind, or work 
yourself into a complete mess, you don’t have 
to remain in your predicament or save your 
work. InDesign offers several escape routes. 
You can
  Undo your last action by choosing 
Edit➪Undo (Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z). (You can’t 
undo some actions, particularly actions 
such as scrolling that don’t affect any items 
or the underlying document structure.) You 
can undo multiple actions in the reverse 
order in which they were done by repeat-
edly choosing Edit➪Undo (Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z); 
each time you undo, the previous action is 
undone.
  Redo an action you’ve undone by choosing 
Edit➪Redo (Shift+Ô+Z or Ctrl+Shift+Z). 
Alternatively, choosing Undo and Redo is a 
handy way of seeing a before/after view of 
a particular change. As with undo, you can 
redo multiple undone actions in the reverse 
of the order in which they were undone.

13
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
Mastering Basic InDesign Vocabulary
All industries have their jargon to describe unique approaches, tools, attri-
butes, and specifications. Publishing is no different. Its vocabulary includes 
pica, kerning, crop, and color model. But because programs like InDesign 
bring a once-specialized capability to the masses, the terms are sometimes 
used incorrectly. Sometimes, they’re replaced with general terms to make 
nonprofessional users feel less threatened, but that substitution ends up 
confusing professional printers, people who work in service bureaus, and 
Internet service providers. Throughout this book, I define other publishing 
terms as they come up.
In addition to using publishing-industry vocabulary, InDesign comes with its 
own specific terminology, much of it adopted from other Adobe products. 
Terms to know include the following:
 
 Frame: The container for an object. A frame can hold text, a graphic, or 
a color fill.
 
 Link: The connection to a graphics or text file that you import, or place, 
into an InDesign document. The link contains the file’s location and its 
last modification date and time. A link can reference any graphics or text 
file that you’ve imported into a layout. InDesign can notify you when a 
source text or graphics file has changed so that you can choose whether 
to update the version in your layout.
 
 Package: The collection of all files needed to deliver a layout for printing.
 
 PDF: The Adobe Portable Document Format, which has become the 
standard for sharing electronic documents. No matter what kind of 
computer it’s viewed on (Windows, Macintosh, Palm, or Unix), a PDF 
document displays the original document’s typography, graphics repre-
sentation, and layout. With InDesign, you can place PDF files as if they 
were graphics, and you can also export its InDesign pages to PDF format.
 
 Plug-in: A piece of software that loads into, and becomes part of, 
InDesign to add capabilities to the program.
 
 Stroke: The outline of an object (whether a graphic, line, or individual 
text characters) or frame.
 
 Thread: The connections between text frames that let a story flow from 
one frame to another.

14
Part I: Before You Begin 
Discovering the Document Window
In InDesign, you spend lots of time working in document windows — the 
“containers” for your documents. Each document, regardless of its size, is 
contained within its own document window.
The best way to get familiar with the InDesign document window is by 
opening a blank document. Simply choosing File➪New➪Document (Ô+N or 
Ctrl+N) and clicking OK opens a new document window. Don’t worry about 
the settings for now — just explore.
Figure 1-1 shows all the standard elements of a new document window. I 
won’t bore you by covering interface elements that are standard to all pro-
grams. Instead, the rest of this section focuses on InDesign-specific elements.

 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
 
The Version Cue pop-up menu lets you see the current status of a document 
in a shared workgroup setup. You can ignore this expert feature. The new 
Preflight pop-up menu helps deal with any issues that can affect printing, as 
Chapter 23 explains. And the new Search menu lets you look for files on your 
computer and in Adobe Bridge.
Rulers
Document windows display a horizontal ruler across the top and a vertical 
ruler down the left side. As shown in Figure 1-1, the horizontal ruler measures 
from the top-left corner of the page across the entire spread, and the vertical 
ruler measures from the top to the bottom of the current page. These rulers 
are handy for judging the size and placement of objects on a page. Even expe-
rienced designers often use the rulers while they experiment with a design.
Both rulers display increments in picas unless you change the measurement 
system for each ruler in the Units & Increments pane of the Preferences 
dialog box. Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Units & Increments (Ô+K) or 
Edit➪Preferences➪Units & Increments (Ctrl+K) to open the Preferences 
dialog box. Your choices include inches, picas, points, decimal inches, cice-
ros, agates, millimeters, and centimeters.
 
If you change the ruler measurement system when no documents are open, 
the rulers in all new documents will use the measurement system you 
selected. If a document is open when you make the change, the rulers are 
changed only in that document.
 
You can also create your own measurement system by choosing Custom. 
Most people should ignore this option, but sometimes it can make sense, such 
as setting the ruler to match the line spacing, so that you can measure number 
of lines in your ruler.
If your computer has a small monitor and the rulers start to get in your way, 
you can hide them by choosing View➪Hide Rulers (Ô+R or Ctrl+R).
Zero point
The point where the rulers intersect in the upper-left corner of the page is 
called the zero point. (Some people call it the ruler origin.) The zero point is 
the starting place for all horizontal and vertical measurements.
If you need to place items in relation to another spot on the page (for exam-
ple, from the center of a spread rather than from the left-hand page), you can 
move the zero point by clicking and dragging it to a new location. Notice that 

16
Part I: Before You Begin 
the X: and Y: values in the Control panel update as you drag the zero point so 
that you can place it precisely.
If you change the zero point, it changes for all pages or spreads in the docu-
ment. You can reset the zero point to the upper-left corner of the left-most 
page by double-clicking the intersection of the rulers in the upper-left corner.
 
If you move the zero point, all the objects on the page display new X: and Y: 
values even though they haven’t actually moved. Objects above or to the left 
of the zero point will show negative X: and Y: values, and the X: and Y: values 
of other objects will not relate to their actual position on the page or spread.
You can lock the zero point, making it more difficult to accidentally change it. 
Control+click or right-click the ruler origin and choose Lock Zero Point from 
the menu that appears. (The Unlock Zero Point command is right there as 
well, so you can just as easily unlock it.) Locking the zero point is a good idea 
because it will remind anyone working on your document that you prefer that 
they not fiddle with the zero point.
Pasteboard
The white area that surrounds the page is called the pasteboard. It’s a work-
space for temporarily storing objects. The pasteboard above and below each 
page or spread is an inch deep. The pasteboard at both left and right of a 
page or spread is just as wide as the page. For example, a spread composed 
of two 8-inch-wide pages has 8 inches of pasteboard to the left and 8 inches 
of pasteboard to the right, plus 1 inch of pasteboard above and 1 inch below.
 
You can make the height of the pasteboard above and below pages something 
other than the default of 1 inch. To do so, open the Guides & Pasteboard 
pane of the Preferences dialog box and choose a new value for the Minimum 
Vertical Offset field. (Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard 
[Ô+K] or Edit➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard [Ctrl+K] to open the 
Preferences dialog box.)
Application frame and bar
 
InDesign CS4 introduces the application frame. Windows users will already 
know what an application frame is, though it never had a name: All the elements 
of InDesign — its panels, document windows, and so on — were confined into 
a window with a gray background. By contrast, on a Mac, all these elements 
floated freely, so folders, icons and other applications could be visible “under-
neath” InDesign’s elements — and that confused some users.

17
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
With the application frame, Mac users can now put all the InDesign ele-
ments in their own container so that they don’t float freely and other appli-
cations don’t peek through. You show the application frame by choosing 
Window➪Application Frame — doing so makes InDesign for Mac behave 
like InDesign for Windows. (By default, the application frame is turned off in 
InDesign for Mac.)
Conversely, Windows users can choose Window➪Application Frame to hide 
the application frame so that InDesign for Windows looks like InDesign for 
Mac. (By default, the application frame is turned on in InDesign for Windows.)
 
The Application Frame menu command is a toggle, hiding the application 
frame if it’s visible and showing it if it’s hidden. You see a check mark next to 
the menu option if the application frame is visible. (InDesign uses the same 
toggling indicator in other menus.)
 
Above the Control panel is the new application bar, which offers easy access 
to other Adobe applications, such as Bridge, and access to controls over vari-
ous view options. It appears by default if the application frame is enabled. 
When the application frame is hidden, you can show or hide the application 
bar by choosing Window➪Application Bar.
The application bar has several handy elements. From left to right:
 
 The first element is the set of quick-access buttons to Bridge and other 
Adobe software.
 
 The second element is the Zoom Level field and pop-up menu, which 
replaces the Zoom pop-up menu that used to be at the bottom of the 
document window.
 
 The third element is the View Options pop-up menu, which lets you 
hide and show frames boundaries, hidden characters, grids, and other 
such visual aids from one handy location. These options previously 
existed but only in a variety of scattered menu options (where they also 
remain).
 
 The fourth element, the Screen Mode pop-up menu, duplicates the 
Screen Mode feature at the bottom of the Tools panel (see Chapter 2).
 
 The fifth element, the new Arrange Documents pop-up menu, gives you 
fast access to InDesign CS4’s new controls over how document windows 
are arranged (covered later in this chapter).
 
 The sixth element, the Workspaces pop-up menu, gives you quick access 
to the workspaces you’ve defined (as described in the “Working with 
Panels, Docks, and Workspaces” section, later in this chapter).
 
 At the far right is the Search menu, which you can use to find files on 
your computer or via the Adobe Bridge program.

Pages and guides
Pages, which you can see on-screen surrounded by black outlines, reflect the 
page size you set up in the New Document dialog box (File➪New➪Document 
[Ô+N or Ctrl+N]). If in your document window it looks like two or more pages 
are touching, you’re looking at a spread.
InDesign uses nonprinting guides, lines that show you the position of margins 
and that help you position objects on the page. Margins are the spaces at the 
outside of the page, whereas columns are vertical spaces where text is supposed 
to go by default. Magenta lines across the top and bottom of each page show the 
document’s top and bottom margins. Violet lines show left and right columns 
(for single-page documents) or inside and outside columns (for spreads).
 
InDesign CS4 introduces a new set of guides, called smart guides, covered in 
Chapter 10.
You can change the location of margin and column guides by choosing 
Layout➪Margins and Columns. You can create additional guides — such as to 
help you visually align objects — by holding down your mouse button on the 
horizontal or vertical ruler and then dragging a guide into the position you want.
Page controls
If you feel like flipping through pages of the document you’re creating, InDesign 
makes it easy with page-turning buttons and the Page field and pop-up menu. 
Controls for entering prefixes for the page numbers of sections, and for indicat-
ing absolute page numbers in a document that contains multiple sections, are 
also handy. (An absolute page number indicates a page’s position in the docu-
ment, such as +1 for the first page, +2 for the second page, and so on.)
At the bottom left of the document windows is a combined Page page-number 
field and pop-up menu encased by two sets of arrows. These arrows are page-
turning buttons that take you to, from left to right, the first page, the previous 
page, the next page, and the last page. Just click an arrow to get where you 
want to go.
You can also jump directly to a specific document page or master page in 
several ways:
 
 Highlight the current number in the page number field (by selecting it 
with your cursor), enter a new page number or master-page name, and 
press Return or Enter.
 
 Use the Go to Page dialog box (Ô+J or Ctrl+J), enter a new page number 
or a master-page name, and press Return or Enter.
 
 Choose the desired page from the Page pop-up menu.

19
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
 
 You can also use the Pages panel to navigate your document, as Chapter 
4 explains.
Opening Multiple Document Windows
If you like to work on more than one project at once, you’ve come to the right 
program. InDesign lets you open several documents at once. It also lets you 
open multiple windows simultaneously for individual documents. A large 
monitor (or having multiple monitors connected) makes this multiwindow 
feature even more useful. By opening multiple windows, you can
 
 Display two (or more) different pages or spreads at once. You still have 
to work on the documents one at a time, but no navigation is required — 
you have only to click within the appropriate window.
 
 Display multiple magnifications of the same page. For example, you 
can work on a detail at high magnification in one window and display the 
entire page — and see the results of your detail work — at actual size in 
another window.
 
 Display a master page in one window and a document page based 
on that master page in another window. When you change the master 
page, the change is reflected in the window in which the associated 
document page is displayed.
 
Document windows are now by default accessed through a set of tabs below 
the Control panel, rather than as a series of cascaded windows as in previous 
versions of InDesign.
When multiple windows are open, you activate a window by clicking on a win-
dow’s title tab or anywhere within its window. Also, the names of all open docu-
ments are displayed at the bottom of the Window menu. Choosing a document 
name from the Window menu brings that document to the front. If multiple 
windows are open for a particular document, each window is displayed (they’re 
displayed in the order in which you created them) in the Window menu.
To show multiple windows on-screen at once, choose 
Window➪Arrange➪Tile. When you choose the Tile command, all open win-
dows are resized and displayed side by side. Or use one of the new window-
layout options in the new Arrange Documents pop-up menu’s options (in 
the application bar). How they display will depend on the option you chose. 
Either way, note that when you resize any individual document window, the 
others will be resized accordingly so that they don’t overlap.
To put all these tiled windows back into their regular tabs so that 
only one document window is visible on-screen at a time, choose 
Window➪Arrange➪Consolidate All Windows or choose the Consolidate All 

20
Part I: Before You Begin 
Windows option (single-window icon) in the Arrange Documents pop-up 
menu in the application bar.
 
If you don’t like the tabbed approach to windows and instead want to 
use the old-style approach of stacked windows, you can. Just choose 
Window➪Arrange➪Float All in Windows. You can then move the indi-
vidual windows around the screen as desired; if they get too messy, choose 
Windows➪Arrange➪Cascade to tell InDesign to make them all neat and 
tidy in a cascaded stack. If you want to go back to tabbed windows, choose 
Window➪Arrange➪Consolidate All Windows.
 
To close all windows for the currently displayed document, press Shift+Ô+W 
or Ctrl+Shift+W. To close all windows for all open documents, press 
Option+Shift+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W.
Not only do you get separate document windows for each open document, 
you can also create multiple windows for an individual document so that you 
can see different parts of it at the same time. To open a new window for the 
active document, choose Window➪Arrange➪New Window (or use the New 
Window option in the new Arrange Documents pop-up menu in the applica-
tion bar). The new window is displayed in its own tab or window, depending 
on whether you’ve enabled Open Documents as Tabs in the Interface pane 
of the Preferences dialog box (InDesign➪Preferences➪Interface [Ô+K] or 
Edit➪Preferences➪Interface [Ctrl+K]).
 
You can tell that a document window shows a different view of an existing 
document by looking at the name of the document in the window’s title. 
At the end of the document name will be a colon (:) followed by a number. 
Newsletter.indd:1 would be the document’s first window, Newsletter.indd:2 
would be its second window, and so on.
Tooling around the Tools Panel
You can move the InDesign Tools panel — the control center for 32 of 
InDesign’s 33 tools, as well as for 13 additional functions — by clicking and 
dragging it into position. The Tools panel usually appears to the left of a 
document (see Figure 1-2).
 
The one tool not directly accessible from the Tools panel is the Marker tool. 
But you can switch to it from the Eyedropper tool by holding Option or Alt. 
(Chapter 6 explains its use.)
 
To discover each tool’s “official” name, hover the mouse pointer over a tool 
for a few seconds, and a Tool Tip will appear, telling you the name of that tool. 
If the Tool Tips don’t display, make sure that the Tool Tips pop-up menu is set 
to Normal or Fast in the Interface pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose 
InDesign➪Preferences➪Interface [Ô+K] or Edit➪Preferences➪Interface [Ctrl+K]).

21
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
InDesign gives you one — and only one — tool for each specific job. The 
Tools panel includes tools for creating and manipulating the objects that 
make up your designs. The tools in the Tools panel are similar to those in 
other Adobe products (such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver). I 
cover what each tool does in the following sections.
The small arrow in the lower-right corner of some tools is a pop-out menu 
indicator. A tool that displays this arrow is hiding one or more similar tools. 
To access these “hidden” tools, click and hold a tool that has the pop-out 
menu indicator, as shown in Figure 1-2. When the pop-out displays, click one 
of the new tools.
 
You can now also Control+click or right-click a tool to see the “hidden” tools.
You don’t need to worry about all the tools, so I highlight just those that 
you’ll need to know to start using InDesign. You’ll likely come across the 
others as you work on specific tasks, so I cover those in the chapters that 
introduce those functions.

Part I: Before You Begin 
Using the Selection tools
To work with objects, you have to select them. InDesign provides three tools 
to do that, letting you select different aspects of objects.
Selection tool
The Selection tool is perhaps the most-used tool in InDesign. With the 
Selection tool, you can select objects on the page and move or resize them. 
You may want to think of this tool as the Mover tool because it’s the only tool 
that lets you drag objects around on-screen.
After you’ve selected the Selection tool, here’s how it works:
 
 To select any object on a document page, click it. If you can’t seem to 
select it, the object might be placed by a master page (a preformatted 
page used to format pages automatically), or the object might be behind 
another object.
 
 To select an object placed by a master page, press Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift 
while you click.
 
 To select an object that is completely behind another object, Ô+click it 
or Ctrl+click it.
Direct Selection tool
The Direct Selection tool is what you use to work on the contents of a frame, 
not the frame itself. For example, you can use the Direct Selection tool to 
select individual handles on objects to reshape them or to move graphics 
within their frames.
Here’s how the Direct Selection tool works:
 
 To select an object to reshape it, click the object to display anchor 
points on the edges (the anchor points are hollow handles that you can 
select individually, as shown in Figure 1-3). You can drag the anchor 
points to reshape the object.
 
 To select objects placed by a master page, Shift+Ô+click or 
Ctrl+Shift+click, as with the Selection tool. The Direct Selection tool lets 
you easily select objects behind other objects and select items within 
groups.
 
 To move a graphic within its frame, click inside the frame and drag the 
graphic.
 
 To move a frame but leave the graphic in place, click an edge of the 
frame and drag it.

23
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
 
Figure 1-3: 
Reshape an

Selection 
tool by

Position tool
Meant to mimic PageMaker’s Crop tool to help former PageMaker users 
adjust to InDesign, the Position tool, which you access from the pop-out 
menu in the Direct Selection tool, combines some aspects of the Selection 
tool with some aspects of the Direct Selection tool:
 
 As with the Selection tool, you can resize an object’s frame by dragging 
its handles.
 
 As with the Direct Selection tool, you can click a graphic and reposition 
it within the frame by dragging — and that has the effect of cropping the 
graphic.
Using the Type tool
A very frequently used tool, the Type tool lets you enter, edit, and format 
text. The Type tool also lets you create rectangular text frames.
Here’s how the Type tool works:
 
 To create a rectangular text frame, click and drag; hold the Shift key to 
create a perfect square.
 
 To begin typing or editing text, click in a text frame or in any empty 
frame and type away.
I explain stories and threaded text frames in Chapter 11.

24
Part I: Before You Begin 
Using the object-creation tools
InDesign has a bunch of tools for creating shapes. Part V covers them in 
more depth, but you should know about a few of them now because they 
create objects that can contain either text or graphics. Plus, you can also use 
them to draw your own shapes that you then color or otherwise embellish in 
your layout. Here’s what you need to know:
 
 Pen tool: With the Pen tool, you can create simple illustrations. You 
use the Pen tool, which is modeled after the pen tools in Illustrator and 
Photoshop, to create paths (both open, such as lines, and closed, such 
as shapes) consisting of straight and curved segments. Give it a try — 
it’s fun! (Chapter 7 explains how to use the tool.)
 
 Type tool: The Type tool lets you draw rectangular text frames, as well 
as type text inside them.
 
 Line tool: The Line tool lets you draw freestanding lines (paths) on your 
page. After selecting this tool, simply click and drag the mouse to draw 
the line. Holding the Shift key while you click and drag constrains the 
line angle to 45-degree increments, which is useful for creating straight 
horizontal and vertical lines.
 
 Frame and shape tools: InDesign has three frame tools (Rectangle 
Frame, Ellipse Frame, and Polygon Frame) and three shape tools 
(Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon). The frame and shape tools are redun-
dant because both frames and shapes can hold text or graphics or be 
empty.
 
 Because the frame and shape tools really do the same thing, you might 
use the frame tool when creating frames that will have their content 
added later. Why? Because the frames appear with a big X through them, 
making them easier to spot when looking for frames to fill. The shape 
tools create frames without that X, so it’s easier to overlook them.
 
 To create a rectangle or ellipse, choose the appropriate tool, click 
somewhere in the document window, and drag the mouse to another 
location. The rectangle or ellipse fills the area. But creating a polygon 
works differently, as Chapter 7 explains.
Using the navigation tools
Several tools, described in the following list, help you navigate your docu-
ment so that you can move around your pages, move your pages around the 
screen, and change the degree of magnification to see just part of a page or to 
see several pages at once.

25
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
 
 Hand tool: The Hand tool lets you move a page around to view differ-
ent portions of it or another page entirely. After selecting the Hand tool, 
click and drag in any direction. You can access the Hand tool temporar-
ily without actually switching tools by pressing Option+spacebar or 
Alt+spacebar.
 
 For a quick way to pan through your document, make sure that the 
Hand tool is active. Then click and hold the mouse. InDesign will zoom 
out and display a red rectangle. If you move the mouse, InDesign CS4 
stops zooming and instead lets you move the rectangle to a new area of 
focus. Let go to have InDesign display that part of the document back 
at the original zoom setting. (This new zoom-and-pan navigator option 
replaces previous versions’ Navigator panel and its features.) If the 
autozoom is too fast, you can use the up and down arrow keys instead 
to manually move through various zoom levels. And if you decide you’ve 
navigated some place you didn’t mean to, just press Esc — as long as 
the mouse is still pressed — to start over.
 
 Zoom tool: With the Zoom tool, you increase and decrease the docu-
ment view scale. You can highlight a specific area on a page to change 
its view, or you can click on-screen to change the view scale within 
InDesign’s preset increments, which is the same as pressing Ô+= or 
Ctrl+= to zoom in.
 
 View buttons: At the very bottom of the Tools panel is the Preview 
Mode button. Its pop-out menu has four preview options: Bleed mode, 
Slug mode, Preview mode, and Normal mode. Bleed mode shows any 
objects that bleed (extend) beyond the page boundaries, whereas Slug 
mode shows the space reserved for information such as crop marks and 
color separation names used in final output. Preview mode shows you 
the layout as if it were printed (no guides, bounding boxes, and so on.) 
Normal mode shows you any interface elements in use, such as guides, 
hidden characters, and story threads. You can read more about these in 
Chapter 3. You set these options when you create new documents or by 
choosing File➪Document Setup.
 
 If your Tools panel displays in two columns, you get two buttons at 
the bottom of the panel: Normal Mode and Preview Mode. In that case, 
Preview Mode has a pop-out menu that has the Preview, Bleed, and Slug 
options. To toggle between single-column and two-column views of the 
Tools panel, click the collapse icon (>> or <<, depending on how many 
columns are displayed) at the top of the panel.

26
Part I: Before You Begin 
Working with Panels, Docks, 
and Workspaces
InDesign has so many controls and features that its designers have long ago 
stopped relying on menu commands to access them all. Instead, most of 
InDesign’s features are presented as sort of miniature dialog boxes, called 
panels, that are “windows” of readily accessible options to consider when 
working in InDesign.
Working with panels
Panels provide an interactive method of working with features, one that lets 
you access the controls quickly. In many cases, panels offer the only method 
for performing many tasks. Figure 1-1, earlier in this chapter, shows the panels 
that appear on-screen by default. Note that you can access all panels — except 
Quick Apply and Tabs — via the Window menu, whether or not the panel is 
displayed on-screen at the moment.
Panels typically have three — but sometimes four — controls:
 
 All panels but the Attributes, Kuler, Pathfinder, Script Label, Story, and 
Tools panels have a flyout menu, which provides a pop-up menu of con-
trols relevant to that panel.
 
 Any active panel — meaning it’s displayed in front of any others in its 
panel group so that you can actually modify its settings — has a close 
control to remove the panel from the panel group. This control isn’t a 
way to switch to another panel in that panel group — to do that, just 
click the tab of the panel you want to work with. (If you remove a panel 
by mistake, go to the Window menu to open it again.)
Using contextual menus
InDesign’s contextual menu interface element 
is very useful. By Control+clicking or right-
clicking the document, an object, elements 
listed in a panel (such as a list of files or styles), 
the rulers, and so on, you can display a menu of 
options for modifying whatever it is you clicked. 
InDesign provides a lot of options this way, and 
using the contextual menus to access InDesign 
functions is often easier than hunting through 
the many regular menu options and panels.

27
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
 
 Any active panel has a collapse control (the >> icon). For panels in the 
dock, clicking that icon collapses it back into the dock. For panels not in 
the dock (that is, for floating panels), collapsing them shrinks the panel 
to a much smaller size to get them out of the way. When collapsed, these 
panels will have a << icon to expand them again. (The Tools panel is an 
exception: clicking the >> icon changes it to a two-column layout, while 
clicking the << icon changes it to a one-column layout.)
 
 Some panels have an expand/collapse control. Click the control to show 
more or fewer options. (If all options are displayed, clicking the control 
will shorten the panel and hide some of the advanced options; if only 
the basic options are displayed, clicking the control lengthens the panel 
and shows all the options.) Figure 1-4 shows examples of collapsed and 
expanded panels.
 
Figure 1-4: 
An example 
of a panel 
collapsed 
(left) and 
expanded 
(right).
 
 
InDesign CS4 adds several new panels: Conditional Text (see Chapter 21), 
Connections (a quick way to go to Adobe’s online resources), Kuler (see 
Chapter 6), and Preflight (see Chapter 23). The Buttons panel replaces the 
old States panel (see Chapter 24). Gone are the Command Bar and Navigator 
panels.
To better suit your working style, you can drag panels by their tabs to move 
them from one panel group to another, drag them out of a dock so that 
they’re free-floating, or drag them into a dock so that they’re no longer free-
floating. The dock feature lets you keep panel groups in one contained area, 
which helps keep the interface from getting too cluttered. But you’re not 
forced to work this way: You can still drag panels outside the main dock so 
that they’re free-floating on-screen.
Not all panels display in the main dock; less-used panels, such as Data Merge, 
show up in a free-floating panel group when you open them via the Window 
menu. Of course, you can always add such panels to the main dock if you use 
them a lot.

28
Part I: Before You Begin 
 
All but three panels have a tab, which contains its name, to help you select 
the desired panel without having to go to the Window menu. The three special 
panels (without tabs) are the Tools, Control, and Quick Apply panels. Unlike 
the rest of InDesign’s panels, they can’t be grouped with other panels, so you 
don’t need a tab to select them. Also, note that the Quick Apply panel is the 
only one not available via the Window menu; instead, use the lightning-bolt 
icon to open it from the Control panel and several other panels; you can also 
choose Edit➪Quick Apply (Ô+Return or Ctrl+Enter).
To quickly select a panel, just click its tab from its open panel group. When a 
panel is active, its controls have the following characteristics:
 
 To display and select an option, click a pop-up menu or an iconic 
button; the changes take effect immediately.
 
 To place a new value in a field, highlight the value that’s already in 
the field and enter the new value. Note that fields accept values in all 
supported measurement systems, as described in the “Specifying mea-
surement values” section, earlier in this chapter. To implement the new 
value, press Shift+Return or Shift+Enter. To get out of a field you’ve 
modified, leaving the object unchanged, press Esc.
 
 To increase or decrease the value in the field, use the clickable up and 
down arrows where available.
 
 To use math to perform changes, enter calculations in the field. You can 
add, subtract, multiply, and divide values in fields by using the following 
operators: +, –, * (multiply), and / (divide). For example, to reduce the 
width of a frame by half, type /2 after the current value in the Width field. 
Or, to increase the length of a line by 6 points, you can type +6 next to the 
current value in the Length field. You can also use percentages in fields, 
such as 50%, which adjusts the current value by that percentage.
As with the tools, if you make sure that Tool Tips are enabled in the Interface 
pane of the Preferences dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Interface 
[Ô+K] or Edit➪Preferences➪Interface [Ctrl+K]), you’ll get some ideas as to 
what the panel iconic buttons and fields do.
 
If panels are getting in your way, you can make them all disappear by press-
ing Tab — as long as the Type tool is not active and the text cursor is active 
within a text frame, of course. Press Tab to get your panels back.
Working with docks
Docks have controls to collapse and expand them. Click the double-arrow 
iconic button at a dock’s upper corner to collapse or expand the dock. You 
can also resize the main dock by dragging its resize handle. Figure 1-5 shows 
the dock controls and what they look like when expanded and collapsed.

29
 Chapter 1: Understanding InDesign Ingredients
 
Figure 1-5: 
The col-
lapsed dock 
controls are

display (left), 
but you can

them to see 
their options 
(right).
 
Working with workspaces
Although you can rearrange InDesign’s panels to suit your needs, rearranging 
again and again as you switch from one task to another can be a real chore. 
For example, you may open several of the table- and text-oriented panels 
when working on text, but then close them and open the graphics- and 
positioning-oriented panels when refining layout placement.
That’s why InDesign lets you create workspaces, which are essentially 
memorized panel collections. Display the panels you want, where you want 
them, and create a new workspace by choosing Window➪Workspace➪New 
Workspace. (Note that this menu option has been called Save 
Workspace in previous versions.) Give the workspace a name that 
makes sense, such as Text Panels. That workspace is now available via 
Window➪Workspace➪workspace name, automatically displaying just those 
saved panels in their saved locations.
 
Not only can you save workspaces, you can also tell InDesign CS4 to save any 
menu customizations made along with the currently opened selection panels 
into that workspace. (Chapter 2 covers menu customization.)

30
Part I: Before You Begin 
Surveying the Menus
Although InDesign relies heavily on its panels to present its rich capabilities, 
it also uses traditional menus. In some cases, you can use menus instead of 
panels; in others, you must use a menu command; in still others, you must 
use a panel (such as for the data merge and object alignment features).
InDesign for Windows has nine menus, while InDesign for Macintosh has ten:
 
 InDesign (Macintosh only): This menu contains the Preferences menu, 
where you set much of InDesign’s behavioral defaults. You can also con-
figure plug-ins here. Other functions are standard for all Mac programs, 
including hiding and quitting the program. Note that none of these menu 
items’ functions are available in panels.
 
 File: This menu is where you open, create, close, save, export, and set 
up documents and books; where you import text and graphics; where 
you print documents and prepare them for commercial printing; and 
where you set basic user information. Note that none of these menu 
items’ functions are available in panels, except for the Preflight feature.
 
 Edit: This menu lets you cut, copy, and paste elements; edit, spell-check, 
and do search-and-replace operations across entire stories and set up 
story for the InCopy add-on program; adjust and manage color settings; 
set up and change keyboard shortcuts and menu preferences; apply 
various styles to selected objects and text; and undo and redo recent 
actions. In Windows, you also set preferences and quit the program 
from this menu. Note that these menu items’ functions, except for Quick 
Apply, aren’t available in panels.
 
 Layout: With this menu, you add, delete, rearrange, and navigate pages; 
change margins and guides; automatically resize a page and its objects; 
set up page numbering and sections; and create and format tables of 
contents. Note that these menu options’ functions — except for the 
Pages, page-navigation, and Numbering & Section Options menus — 
aren’t available in panels.
 
 Type: With this menu, you adjust typographic attributes such as size 
and font, insert special characters, work with footnotes, add placeholder 
text; and control the on-screen display of special characters such as 
spaces. Note that the Find Font, Change Case, Type on a Path, Document 
Footnote Options, Text Variables, Insert Character, Fill with Placeholder 
text, and Show Hidden Characters menu items’ functions aren’t avail-
able though panels. Also note that the separate Notes menu found in 
InDesign CS3 has moved into this menu as a new menu item.

 Object: You use this menu to change the shape, size, location, and other 
attributes of objects, such as frames and lines; apply special effects to 
objects; insert multimedia effects such as buttons; and control display 
redraw speed. Note that the Text Frame Options, Anchored Object, 
Corner Options, Clipping Path, and Convert Shape menu items’ functions 
aren’t available through panels.
 
 Table: Use this menu to create, change, and format tables and cells. 
Note that this menu’s functions are available through panels.
 
 View: This menu lets you control the display of your document, from 
zoom level to whether guides, rulers, and frame edges appear. Note that 
none of these menu items’ functions, except for Screen Mode and the 
zoom controls, are available in panels.
 
 Window: This menu is where you manage the display of document 
windows and panels, as well as where you set up and work with work-
spaces. The window display and workspace functions aren’t available 
via panels.
 
 Help: Use this menu to access InDesign’s help system and manage 
product activation and registration. In Windows, this menu also lets 
you manage plug-ins. Note that none of these menu items’ functions are 
available in panels.

I
t’s safe to say that the nice people who created InDesign did their best: 
They put their heads together and made educated guesses about how 
most people would like to work and, in doing so, established defaults for vari-
ous settings in the program. When you’re just starting out, simply sticking 
with the default settings and seeing how they work for you isn’t a bad idea. 
But after you become more familiar with InDesign and start putting it through 
its paces, you can change default preferences, views, and measurements, 
making them better suited to your way of working.
Preferences are program settings that dictate how InDesign will act in certain 
instances. InDesign provides extensive preference settings for everything 
from how objects appear on-screen to how text is managed for spelling and 
hyphenation.
Setting InDesign to work your way is easy, and this chapter explains how. I 
promise not to numb you by covering every single option. Instead, I focus 
on just those preferences you’re likely to change. As for the rest, feel free to 
explore their effects after you’re more comfortable using InDesign.

Part I: Before You Begin 
Setting Document Preferences
Preferences are settings that affect an entire document — such as what 
measurement system you use on rulers, what color the guides are, and 
whether substituted fonts are highlighted. To access these settings, open 
the Preferences dialog box by choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪desired pane 
name (Ô+K) or Edit➪Preferences➪desired pane name (Ctrl+K).
When you open the Preferences dialog box using the keyboard shortcut 
(Ô+K or Ctrl+K), InDesign automatically opens the General pane, as shown 
in Figure 2-1. To access one of the other 16 preferences panes, just click its 
name from the list at the left of the dialog box.
 
InDesign has two methods for changing preferences: You can change prefer-
ences when no documents are open to create new settings for all future docu-
ments, or you can change preferences for the active document, which affects 
only that document. Either way, after you’ve changed the desired preferences 
settings, just click OK to save those settings.
 
You can’t reverse changes to preferences after the fact by using the Undo 
command (Edit➪Undo [Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z]). If you change your mind about a 
preference setting, reopen the Preferences dialog box and change the setting 
again.
 
Figure 2-1: 
The General 
pane of the 
Preferences 
dialog box.

 Chapter 2: Making InDesign Work Your Way
Type preferences
The Type pane of the Preferences dialog box, shown in Figure 2-2, includes 
settings that affect character formats, controls whether you use typogra-
pher’s quotes, and manages how text appears on-screen. You’re likely to 
adjust these settings, so here’s a quick review of the main ones:
 
Figure 2-2: 
The Type 
pane of the 
Preferences 
dialog box.
 
 
 If Use Typographer’s Quotes is checked, InDesign inserts the correct 
typographer’s quotes (often called curly quotes) for the current language 
in use whenever you use quotation marks. For example, for U.S. English, 
InDesign inserts typographic single quotes (’ ’) or double quotes (“ ”) 
rather than straight quotes. For French, Catalan, Polish, and other 
languages, InDesign inserts guillemets (« »).
 
 Check Triple Click to Select a Line if you want to be able to select an 
entire line of text by triple-clicking it.
 
 When the Apply Leading to Entire Paragraph box is checked, changes 
to leading (the space between lines) apply to the entire paragraph, as 
opposed to the current line. In most cases, you want the leading to be 
applied to all paragraphs, so checking this box is a good idea.
 
 Adjust Spacing Automatically When Cutting and Pasting Words, which 
is checked by default, will add or delete spaces around words when you 
cut and paste.

36
Part I: Before You Begin 
 
 When Font Preview Size is checked, menus let you preview how your 
font choice looks before you actually select it. The pop-up menu at the 
right of the check box lets you select the size of the preview.
 
 The options in the Drag and Drop Text Editing section of the Type pane 
control whether you can drag and drop text selections within a docu-
ment. By default, Enable in Story Editor is checked and Enable in Layout 
View is unchecked, which means that you can drag and drop text in the 
Story Editor but not when working on a layout. You’ll probably want to 
check them both.
 
 The new options in the Smart Text Reflow section of the Type pane tell 
InDesign how to create new pages if the text you are placing takes more 
room than the number pages already in your document (see Chapter 11).
The Advanced Type pane includes additional typographic settings, shown in 
Figure 2-3.
 
Figure 2-3: 
The 
Advanced 
Type pane 
of the 
Preferences 
dialog box.
 
In the Character Settings section of the Advanced Type pane, you control 
precisely how superscript, subscript, and small-caps characters are placed 
and sized:
 
 The Size fields let you specify the percentages to which superscript and 
subscript characters are reduced (or even enlarged). The default is 58.3 
percent, but you can enter a value between 1 and 200 percent. I prefer 60 
or 65 percent, depending on the type size and font.

37
 Chapter 2: Making InDesign Work Your Way
 
 The Position fields let you specify how much to shift superscript charac-
ters up and subscript characters down. The default is 33.3 percent, but 
you can enter a value between –500 and 500 percent. I prefer 30 percent 
for subscripts and 35 percent for superscripts. Note that negative values 
move text in the opposite directions: down for superscripts and up for 
subscripts. The percentage is relative to the top of a lowercase letter 
(the x height) for superscripts and to the baseline for subscripts.
 
 The Small Cap field lets you specify the scale of Small Caps characters in 
relation to the actual capital letters in the font. The default is 70 percent, 
but you can enter a value between 1 and 200 percent.
The Clipboard Handling pane includes one text-oriented preference: Use the 
When Pasting Text and Tables from Other Applications setting to choose 
how formatting is handled when you paste textual objects from other appli-
cations. The default is Text Only, which means that you want copied text to 
look exactly like the existing text in your InDesign layout. The All Information 
option retains the original formatting when you paste the text into InDesign.
Composition preferences
Preferences in the Composition pane, shown in Figure 2-4, do two things:
 
Figure 2-4: 
The Compo-
sition pane 
of the 
Preferences 
dialog box.
 

38
Part I: Before You Begin 
 
 Highlight potential problems on-screen while you’re working
 
 Establish the behavior of text wrap in certain situations
Highlighting potential problems
The Highlight check boxes control whether InDesign calls attention to possi-
ble typesetting problems by drawing a highlighter pen effect behind the text. 
All are unchecked by default unless indicated otherwise in the descriptions 
that follow:
 
 Keep Violations highlights the last line in a text frame when it can’t 
follow the rules specified in the Keep Options dialog box in the 
Paragraph panel’s flyout menu (Type➪Paragraph [Option+Ô+T or 
Ctrl+Alt+T]), as explained in Chapter 14. For example, if the Keep 
Options settings require at least three lines of text in the text frame, but 
only two lines fit and thus bump all the text in a frame to the next text 
frame in the chain, the Keep Options rules are violated, and the last line 
of text is highlighted.
 
 When H&J Violations is checked, InDesign uses three shades of yellow 
(the darker the shade, the worse the problem) to mark lines that may 
be too loose or too tight due to the combination of spacing and hyphen-
ation settings. (H&J refers to hyphenation and justification.) Chapter 14 
covers this topic, too.
 
 Custom Tracking/Kerning, if checked, highlights custom tracking and 
kerning (essentially, anywhere you overrode the defaults) in a bluish 
green. Chapter 15 covers kerning and tracking in more detail.
 
 Substituted Fonts, which is checked by default, uses pink highlights 
to indicate characters in fonts that aren’t available and thus for which 
InDesign has substituted a different font. For output purposes, it’s 
important that you have the correct fonts, so you typically want to leave 
this option checked.
 
 Substituted Glyphs highlights, in pink, any glyphs (special characters) 
that were substituted. This substitution usually occurs when you have 
multiple versions of the same font, with different special characters in 
each version. For example, a file that uses the euro () currency symbol 
may have been created in the newest version of a font, but a copy editor 
working on the same file may have an older version of the font that is 
missing the euro symbol. If uncorrected, the printed symbol may not be 
what you expected, even if looks right on-screen.
Setting text-wrap rules
The three options in the Text Wrap area affect how text flows (wraps) around 
images and other frames:

39
 Chapter 2: Making InDesign Work Your Way
 
 Selecting the Justify Text Next to an Object check box overrides any 
local justification settings to make text wrapping around an object justi-
fied. The text will smoothly follow the object’s shape, rather than keep 
any ragged margins that can make the wrap look strange. This option 
comes into play when you wrap ragged (left-aligned or right-aligned) text 
around objects.
 
 Skip by Leading, if checked, uses the text’s leading to determine how 
much space follows an object around which text wraps. This effect is 
used only if you choose the Jump Object text-wrap option in the Text 
Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap [Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W]).
 
 Text Wrap Only Affects Text Beneath, if checked, causes only text below 
(behind) an object to wrap around that object.
Chapter 16 covers text wrap in detail.
Measurement preferences
The Units & Increments pane, shown in Figure 2-5, is where you choose the 
measurement systems for positioning items.
 
Figure 2-5: 
The Units & 
Increments 
pane of the 
Preferences 
dialog box.
 

40
Part I: Before You Begin 
Ruler Units area
The Ruler Units area affects three things: the zero point (by page, by spread, 
or by the spine), the measurement system displayed on the horizontal and 
vertical rulers in the document window, and the default values in fields used 
for positioning objects.
The Origin pop-up menu determines the zero point (typically, the upper-left 
corner of the page) for object positions. If you choose Page, the positions of 
objects are relative to each page’s upper-left corner. If you choose Spread, 
the positions of objects are relative to the current spread’s upper-left corner. 
If you choose Spine, objects’ positions are relative to the binding spine of 
each spread — the very top and center of where the two pages meet.
With the Vertical and Horizontal pop-up menus, you specify one measure-
ment system for the horizontal ruler and measurements, and the same or 
different measurement system for the vertical ruler and measurements. For 
example, you might use points for horizontal measurements and inches for 
vertical measurements.
To specify the measurement systems you want to use, choose an option from 
the Horizontal pop-up menu and from the Vertical pop-up menu. You have 
the following options:
 
 Points: A typesetting measurement equal to 
1⁄72 of an inch (or 
1⁄12 of a 
pica). To enter values in points, type a p before the value or pt after the 
value (for example, p6 or 6 pt).
 
 Picas: A typesetting measurement equal to 
1⁄6 of an inch. To enter values 
in picas, type a p after the value (for example, 6p).
 
 You can combine measurements using both picas and points. Keeping 
in mind that 1 pica is equal to 12 points, you can enter 1
1⁄2 picas as either 
1.5p or 1p6.
 
 Inches: An English measurement system that is divided into 16ths. To 
enter values in inches, type i, in, inch, or " after the value. For example, 
3i, 3in, 3 inch, and 3" are all read by InDesign as “3 inches.”
 
 Inches decimal: Inches divided into 10ths on the ruler rather than 
16ths. To enter values in inches decimal, include a decimal point as 
appropriate and type i, in, inch, or " after the value.
 
 Agates: Typically used in newspapers, an agate is 
1⁄14 of an inch, usually the 
depth of a line in the small type of classified ads, stock tables, and sports 
statistics boxes. To enter values in agates, type ag after the value — for 
example, 10ag.
 
 Millimeters: A metric measurement that is 
1⁄10 of a centimeter. To enter 
values in millimeters, type mm after the value, such as 14mm.

41
 Chapter 2: Making InDesign Work Your Way
 
 Centimeters: A metric measurement that is about 
1⁄3 of an inch. To enter 
values in centimeters, type cm after the value, as in 2.3cm.
 
 Ciceros: A European typesetting measurement that is slightly larger than 
a pica. To enter values in ciceros, type c after the value — for example, 2c.
 
 Custom: This option lets you set a customer number of points as your 
measurement unit, placing a labeled tick mark at every point increment 
you specify. You get to customize the number of tick marks between 
the labeled marks by entering a value in the Points field. For example, if 
you enter 12 in the field, you get a tick mark at each pica because a pica 
contains 12 points. A good way to use this option is if you need to have 
the rulers show tick marks at whole-line increments; in that case, if your 
leading is 8 points, you’d set the Custom field to 8.
Keyboard Increments area
The Keyboard Increments area lets you customize the way the keyboard 
arrow keys work. You can use the arrow keys to move selected objects right, 
left, up, or down. You can also use the arrow keys and other keyboard short-
cuts to change some text formatting. The options are
 
 Cursor Key field: When you select an object with the Selection tool 
or the Direct Selection tool, you can move it up, down, left, or right 
by using the arrow keys on the keyboard. By default, the item moves 
1 point with each key press. You can change the increment to a value 
between 0.001 and 8p4 (1.3888 inches). If you use a document grid, you 
can change the increment to match the grid lines.
 
 Size/Leading field: The value in this field specifies by how many points 
the leading or font size is increased or decreased when done with key-
board commands. You can enter a value between 0.001 and 100 (the 
default is 2).
 
 Baseline Shift field: To shift the baseline of highlighted text up or down, 
you can click in the Baseline Shift field on the Character panel and then 
click the up or down arrow on the keyboard. The default for the Baseline 
Shift increment value is 2 points, which you can change to any value 
between 0.001 and 100.
 
 Kerning field: To kern text with keyboard commands, you position 
the cursor between two letters and then press Option+→ or Alt+→ to 
increase kerning, and press Option+← or Alt+← to decrease kerning. By 
default, each press changes kerning by 
1⁄50 of an em — shown on screen 
as 
20⁄1000 em. You can change this value to anything between 1 and 100, in 
increments of 
1⁄1000 of an em. (An em is a space the width of a capital M, a 
commonly used space in professional typography.)

42
Part I: Before You Begin 
Document defaults
InDesign also lets you change the default page size, margins, and columns 
in new documents; the default attributes of guides; and the way layouts are 
adjusted. You don’t modify these settings in the Preferences dialog box; 
instead, to modify document defaults, first make sure that no documents are 
open and then choose the following:
 
 File➪Document Setup (Option+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+P): The Document 
Setup dialog box lets you change the default settings in the New 
Document dialog box for the Number of Pages, Page Size, Facing Pages, 
and Master Text Frame, as well as for bleeds and slugs if you click the 
More Options button.
 
 Layout➪Margins and Columns: The Margins and Columns dialog box 
lets you change the default settings in the New Document dialog box for 
the Margins and Columns areas.
 
 Layout➪Ruler Guides: This command opens the Ruler Guides dialog 
box where you adjust the View Threshold and Color for all new guides.
 
 Layout➪Layout Adjustment: The Layout Adjustment dialog box lets you 
resize entire layouts and modify how they are resized.
 
If you’re unhappy with the preferences and defaults you’ve established, you 
can revert InDesign to all its default settings. To revert all preferences and 
defaults, press Control+Option+Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Alt+Shift when launching 
InDesign.
Typographic terminology 101
Publishing tools like InDesign use specialized 
terms, some of which appear in the Preferences 
dialog box:
  Baseline: This term refers to the invisible 
line that text sits on in each line. Except 
for a few characters like g and p that poke 
below it, all characters rest on this base-
line.
  Kerning: This refers to an adjustment of the 
space between two letters. You kern letters 
to accommodate their specific shapes. For 
example, you probably would use tighter 
kerning in the letter pair to than in oo 
because to looks better if the o fits partly 
under the cross of the t.
  Leading: This term, also called line spac-
ing, refers to the space from one baseline 
to another.
  Tracking: Tracking determines the overall 
space between letters within a word.

43
 Chapter 2: Making InDesign Work Your Way
Modifying Defaults for Text and Objects
When you create a new document, start typing, or create a new object, your 
work conforms to default settings. You can change these settings. For exam-
ple, by default, a new document is always letter-sized, but if you design only 
posters, you can change the default.
You may need to work with InDesign for a while to figure out which settings 
you prefer. When you identify a problem — for example, you realize that you 
always end up changing the inset for text frames — jot down a note about it 
or close all documents right then. When no documents are open, change the 
setting for all future documents.
Working with stored preferences
Some preferences in InDesign are stored in 
files that you can share with other users, so 
the preferences can be consistently used in 
a workgroup. These preferences include key-
board shortcut sets, color swatch libraries, 
document setups, workspaces, and scripts.
Some of these stored preferences — such as 
document setups and printing setups — are 
called presets, and the files that store them 
reside in the Presets folder within the InDesign 
application folder. When you save a preset, 
InDesign automatically updates the presets file. 
You can then copy that preset file to another 
user’s Presets folder.
To create presets, look for menu items with the 
word preset in them — examples are Adobe 
PDF Presets, Document Presets, and Print 
Presets in the File menu; and Transparency 
Flattener Presets in the Edit menu. Also look for 
the Save Preset option in some dialog boxes. 
To use a preset, look for a pop-up menu with 
the word preset in them in dialog boxes; for 
example, you would use the Document Preset 
pop-up menu in the New Document dialog box 
to create a new document using a specific pre-
set’s settings.
InDesign has other types of stored preferences 
whose settings are also stored in separate files, 
also stored in the Presets folder. But you won’t 
see options labeled Presets in the InDesign user 
interface to work with them. These stored pref-
erences include Keyboard Shortcuts, Menus, 
and Color Profiles options in the Edit menu and 
the Workspace option in the Window menu. 
You can share these settings by copying them 
to other users’ Presets folders.
Another kind of preference is typically stored 
as part of a document: master pages, text vari-
able, color swatches, and the various types of 
text, stroke, and object styles available through 
a series of panels. These preferences can be 
imported from other documents using the Load 
command in the various panels’ flyout menus 
and in some dialog boxes. Most presets — 
such as document presets, print presets, trap 
presets, and Adobe PDF presets — can also 
be loaded and saved this same way. In addi-
tion, you can save color swatches to files to 
be shared with other Adobe applications using 
a Save Swatches command in the Swatches 
panel’s flyout menu.

44
Part I: Before You Begin 
Text defaults
When you start typing in a new text frame, the text is formatted with default 
formats and attributes. You can also choose to show invisible characters 
such as spaces and tabs by default; otherwise, you need to manually activate 
character visibility in each text-heavy document. To modify text defaults:
 
 Choose default options for character formats such as Font Family, Font 
Size, and Leading from the Character panel. Choose Type➪Character 
(Ô+T or Ctrl+T).
 
 Choose defaults for paragraph formats, such as alignment, indents, 
spacing, and so on, from the Paragraph panel. Choose Type➪Paragraph 
(Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T).
 
 Choose defaults for the [Basic Paragraph] style, which is what all 
unstyled imported text, as well as text entered in a new text frame in 
InDesign, will use. Choose Type➪Paragraph Styles (Ô+F11 or Ctrl+F11).
 
 Activate Optical Margin Alignment. Choose Type➪Story. This option 
adjusts the left position of characters along the left margin to make the 
left edges look more pleasing, by letting the top of a T, for example, hang 
slightly to the left of the margin, even if that means the characters aren’t 
strictly aligned. (Because optical margin alignment works best for dis-
play type rather than body type, it’s unlikely that you’ll activate optical 
margin alignment as your default setting.)
 
 Show Hidden Characters is a good thing to activate if you always end 
up turning on Show Hidden Characters when you’re editing a document. 
Choose Type➪Show Hidden Characters (Ô+Option+I or Ctrl+Alt+I), or 
choose Hidden Characters from the View Options pop-up menu in the appli-
cation bar. Hidden characters are spaces, tabs, and so on that print “blank” 
but that you may want to see on-screen to make sure that you have the 
right character in use. InDesign has a unique on-screen symbol for every 
kind of space, tab, indent-to-here, and other such “blank” characters.
Object defaults
When you create new objects, they’re based on default settings. For example, 
you can specify how text wraps around objects. To modify object defaults, 
use the following commands:
 
 Specify the default Columns, Inset Spacing, First Baseline, and Ignore 
Text Wrap settings for new text frames using the Text Frame Options 
dialog box. Choose Object➪Text Frame Options (Ô+B or Ctrl+B).
 
 Choose defaults for the [Normal Graphics Frame] and [Normal Text 
Frame] styles, which are what all new frames created in InDesign will 
use. Choose Window➪Object Styles (Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7).

45
 Chapter 2: Making InDesign Work Your Way
 
 Specify how text will wrap around all new objects. Choose 
Window➪Text Wrap (Ô+Option+W or Ctrl+Alt+W).
 
 Choose a style for the corners of all new frames except those created 
with the Type tool. Choose Object➪Corner Options.
 
 Specify the default attributes of clipping paths imported into graphics 
frames. Choose Object➪Clipping Path➪Options (Option+Shift+Ô+K or 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K).
 
 Specify other default properties of objects. For example, if all objects 
you create are stroked (framed), specify a weight in the Stroke panel. 
Choose Window➪Stroke (Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10), Window➪Swatches (F5), 
Window➪Gradient, or Window➪Attributes.
 
 Specify the default number of sides and the inset for the first new poly-
gon in a new document. Double-click the Polygon or Polygon Frame tool 
to open the Polygon Settings dialog box (there is no menu command or 
keyboard shortcut).
Modifying Defaults for Views
InDesign provides controls for several view attributes, including zoom level, 
frame boundaries, and grids.
The application bar contains the Zoom Level field, which shows the cur-
rent zoom percentage. You can type in a new value any time. Immediately 
to its right is the Zoom Level pop-up menu, which also lets you change the 
document’s view. The view can be between 5 percent and 4,000 percent in 
0.01-percent increments.
 
If you use a MacBook Air or a 2008-or-newer-model MacBook Pro, you can 
use gestures on its Multi-Touch trackpad (first introduced in the iPhone) to 
zoom in or out. Use the pinch gesture (two fingers moving closer) to zoom 
in and the expand gesture (two fingers moving apart) to zoom out. (If Apple 
adds the Multi-Touch to other Macs in the future, they would support these 
gestures in InDesign.)
 
The Zoom Level controls have moved from the bottom of the document 
window in previous versions of InDesign to the new application bar in the CS4 
version. Gone is the ability to change the view without taking your hands off 
the keyboard by pressing Option+Ô+5 or Ctrl+Alt+5. Still, you can press Ô+= 
or Ctrl+= to zoom in, or Ô+– or Ctrl+– to zoom out, in increments. Or, with the 
Hand tool selected, just click and hold the mouse and let InDesign zoom 
automatically; let go when you’re at the desired zoom level.

46
Part I: Before You Begin 
You can also control which layout visual aids display, using options in the 
View menu.
For example, if you prefer not to view the edges of frames, you can hide 
them. Similarly, you can hide the visual indicators for the threads indicating 
which frames flow to and from the selected text frame.
If you want to start with a document-wide grid (see Chapter 10), you can. 
Settings you can modify in the View menu include
 
 Show the links between text frames. Choose View➪Show Text Threads 
(Option+Ô+Y or Ctrl+Alt+Y).
 
 Hide the edges of frames. Choose View➪Hide Frame Edges 
(Control+Ô+H or Ctrl+H).
 
 Hide the horizontal and vertical ruler. Choose View➪Hide Rulers 
(Ô+R or Ctrl+R).
 
 Hide margin, column, and layout guides. Choose View➪Grids & 
Guides➪Hide Guides (Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+; [semicolon]).
 
 Hide smart grids. Choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Smart Guides 
(Ô+U or Ctrl+U).
 
 Show the baseline grid established in the Grids pane of the 
Preferences dialog box. Choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Baseline 
Grid (Option+Ô+’ or Ctrl+Alt+’).
 
 Show the document-wide grid established in the Grids pane of the 
Preferences dialog box. Choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show Document 
Grid (Ô+’ or Ctrl+’).
InDesign has another place to set view settings: in the Pages panel’s flyout 
menu, choose View➪Show/Hide Master Items. When you choose Show 
Master Items, any objects on the currently displayed document page’s 
master page are displayed. When you choose Hide Master Items, master 
objects on the currently displayed page are hidden. This command is 
page-specific, so you can show or hide master objects on a page-by-page 
basis.

 Chapter 2: Making InDesign Work Your Way
Adding Default Colors and Styles
If you’re a creature of habit, you may find yourself creating the same colors, 
paragraph styles, character styles, table styles, and object styles over and 
over again. Save yourself some steps by creating these features when no 
documents are open; when you do so, the features will be available to all 
future documents.
To set up these often-used items, use the New command in the flyout menus 
for the following panels: Swatches (F5), Character Styles (Shift+Ô+F11 or 
Ctrl+Shift+F11), Paragraph Styles (Ô+F11 or Ctrl+F11), Table Styles (no short-
cut), Cell Styles (no shortcut), and Object Styles (Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7). You can 
also use the flyout menus’ Load commands to import colors and styles from

Document 
Essentials

In this part . . .
T
he reader sees your text and images, but as a layout 
artist, you know a lot more is going on behind the 
scenes. Your documents contain all sorts of elements — 
the publishing equivalent of the girders and beams and so 
on of a building — that are essential to delivering the final 
text and graphics. This part covers those document 
essentials, showing you how to work with the document 
files, pages, layers, templates, libraries, and sections — 
the basic organizing elements and containers. You also 
find out how to create colors that you can use over and 
over again.

 Saving and exporting documents

 Recovering information after a crash
You’re eager to create a new document and get started with InDesign. So 
you launch InDesign, create or open a new document, and begin work-
ing. Right? Wrong, sort of. You can just plunge in, but you’re best served if 
you have an idea before you start of what you want to accomplish. That way, 
you won’t be staring at a blank screen with no brilliant ideas in mind.
After you have an idea of what you want to do, you need to create the docu-
ment that will hold those brilliant ideas. InDesign lets you apply those ideas 
from the very start of creating the document and also lets you make changes 
later on, as you refine your ideas.
This chapter shows you the basics of working with document files, from creating 
and opening them to saving them.
Setting Up a New Publication
After you launch InDesign, you have two options: You can choose File➪Open 
(Ô+O or Ctrl+O) to open a previously created document or template, or you 
can choose File➪New➪Document (Ô+N or Ctrl+N) to create a new document.
Creating a new document is where all the fun is because you get to create 
something yourself, from scratch. Here’s how to create a new document:

52
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Document (Ô+N or Ctrl+N).
 
 The New Document dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 3-1. It’s here 
that you make many up-front decisions about how you want your new 
document set up — page size, number of pages, number of columns, 
and margin width. Although you’re free to change your mind later, you’ll 
save yourself time and potential headaches by sticking with the basic 
page parameters you establish in the New Document dialog box.
 
Figure 3-1: 
The New 
Document 
dialog box 
establishes 
the basic 
framework 
for your 
pages.
 
 
2. If you know exactly how many pages your publication will have, enter 
the number in the Number of Pages field.
 
 If you don’t know for sure, you can easily add or delete pages later. Just 
guesstimate.
 
3. Decide whether to lay out your documents in a spread or as separate 
pages.
 
 Here are a few pointers:
 
• If you’re creating a multipage publication that will have a spine, 
such as a book, catalog, or magazine, select Facing Pages.
 
• If you’re creating a one-page document, such as a business card, 
an ad, or a poster, don’t select Facing Pages.
 
• Some publications, such as flip charts, presentations, and three-
ring bound documents, have multiple pages but use only one side 
of the page. For such documents, don’t check Facing Pages, either.
 
4. If you want to flow text from page to page in a multipage document, 
such as a book or a catalog, check Master Text Frame.

53
 Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work
 
 If you check this box, InDesign automatically adds a text frame to the 
document’s master page and to all document pages based on this 
master page. Checking this option saves you the work of creating a text 
frame on each page and manually threading text through each frame. 
(See Chapter 6 for more information about using master text frames.)
 
5. In the Page Size area, you can choose one of the predefined sizes from 
the pop-up menu.
 
 Note the new options in InDesign CS4 for various screen sizes; choose one 
of these options if you’re creating pages that you’ll export for further Web 
production in Adobe Dreamweaver or Flash Professional.
 
6. Specify margin values in the Margins area.
 
 If Facing Pages is checked, Inside and Outside fields are available in the 
Margins area. Designers often specify larger inside margins for multi-
page publications to accommodate the fold at the spine. If Facing Pages 
isn’t checked, Left and Right fields replace the Inside and Outside fields. 
You can also specify margin values by clicking the up/down arrows 
associated with the fields.
 
7. To specify how many columns your pages have, enter a value in the 
Columns field.
 
 You can also specify the number of columns by clicking the up/down 
arrows associated with the Column field.
 
8. Specify a gutter distance in the Gutter field.
 
 The gutter is the space between columns. You can also specify a gutter 
width value by clicking the up/down arrows associated with the Gutter 
field.
 
9. Click the More Options button to access the Bleed and Slug area of the 
New Document dialog box.
 
 Clicking the More Options button provides options to set bleed and slug 
areas, as shown earlier in Figure 3-1. (Note that the button then changes 
to Fewer Options.)
 
 A bleed area is a margin on the outside of the page for objects you want 
to extend past the edge of the page — you want them to extend at least 
1⁄8 inch so that if the paper shifts during printing, no white space appears 
where the image should be (touching the edge of the page).
 
 The slug area is an area reserved for printing crop marks, color plate names, 
and other such printing information — some output devices will cut these 
off during printing unless a slug area is defined. For both bleed and slug 
areas, you can set the top, bottom, left, and right margins independently.
 
10. Click OK to close the New Document dialog box.
 
 Your new, blank document appears in a new document window. Figure 
3-2 shows the window of a newly created document that uses the set-
tings shown in Figure 3-1.

Part II: Document Essentials 
 
Figure 3-2: 
The results 
of the set-
tings in 
the New 
Document 
dialog box 
shown in 
Figure 3-1.
 
 
You can bypass the New Document dialog box by pressing Shift+Ô+N or 
Ctrl+Shift+N. When you use this method, the most recent settings in the New 
Document dialog box are used for the new document.
Opening documents
Opening documents with InDesign is pretty much the same as opening docu-
ments with any program. Simply choose File➪Open (Ô+O or Ctrl+O), select 
the document you want to work on, and then click the Open button. But 
InDesign offers a few options for opening documents that you don’t find in 
every program. For example, you can
 
 Open more than one document at a time. Just select multiple documents 
in the Open a File dialog box.
 
 Open a copy of a document instead of the original. This option keeps 
the original file from being overwritten accidentally — very helpful if 
you’re making several variations of one document.
 
 Open a template under its own name. This setting makes editing templates 
easier than it is with other programs, specifically QuarkXPress.

55
 Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work
 
 Open documents created with Versions 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 of PageMaker 
and Versions 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1 of both QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress 
Passport. Unfortunately, you can’t open files created in later versions of 
QuarkXPress (or in any version of Microsoft Publisher) unless you buy 
a separate utility from Markzware. (Go to www.InDesignCentral.com 
for a link to these utilities.)
To open an InDesign file (any version from 1.0 to CS4), follow these steps:
 
1. Choose File➪Open (Ô+O or Ctrl+O).
 
 The Open a File dialog box, shown in Figure 3-3, appears.
 
Figure 3-3: 
The Open a 
File dialog 
box.
 
 
2. Locate and open the folder that contains the documents you want to 
open.
 
 Select a single filename or hold down the Ô or Ctrl key and select multiple 
filenames.
 
 On a Mac, the Open a File dialog box will display all files in a supported file 
format with a filename extension. The dialog box includes a Preview pane 
that displays a thumbnail version of the selected file or, more commonly, its 
icon. Use All Documents in the Enable pop-up menu to display files without 
the expected filename extensions (typically, those transferred or copied 
from a computer running Mac OS 9).

56
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
 In Windows, the Open a File dialog box will display any supported file 
formats that have a supported filename extension. Use All Formats in the 
Files of Type pop-up menu to display files with no filename extensions. 
(Typically, these files are created on an older version of the Mac OS.) The 
Files of Type pop-up menu offers several options: PageMaker 6.0–7.0 files, 
QuarkXPress 3.3–4.1 files, InDesign files, InDesign Interchange, Adobe 
PDF Creation Settings Files, and All Formats. Choose any of these options 
to display a specific file format in the file list. (The Adobe PDF Creation 
Settings Files option is for experts, so don’t worry about it for now.)
 
3. Select Open Normal at the bottom of the dialog box to open the 
original version of the document or a copy of a template; click Open 
Original to open the original version of the document or of a template; 
click Open Copy if you just want to open a copy of it.
 
 In Windows, the options are labeled simply Normal, Original, and Copy 
and appear under the Open As label.
 
 When you open a copy of a document, it’s assigned a default name 
(Untitled-1, Untitled-2, and so on).
 
 (Chapter 5 covers templates.)
 
4. Click Open to close the dialog box and open the selected files.
 
 Each document you opened appears in a separate document window. 
The page and view magnification used when the document was last 
saved is also used when you open the document. (Chapter 1 covers 
document views.)
Opening foreign formats
One of InDesign’s hallmarks is its ability to open 
documents from other programs and convert 
them into InDesign documents. You can open 
documents created in PageMaker 6.0, 6.5, and 
7.0 as well as QuarkXPress and QuarkXPress 
Passport 3.3, 4.0, and 4.1. 
But beware: InDesign’s ability to open a for-
eign-format file doesn’t mean you get a perfect 
translation. The other programs’ formats and 
capabilities are so different from InDesign’s 
that you should expect to spend time cleaning 
up the converted files by hand. In some cases, 
you may find that the amount of cleanup work 
is greater than if you simply re-create the docu-
ment from scratch in InDesign — don’t panic. 
And be happy when your documents convert 
effortlessly. 
The good news is that InDesign will alert 
you to any import issues of PageMaker and 
QuarkXPress files with a dialog box that appears 
after the import is complete.

57
 Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work
Saving documents
When you open a new document, it’s assigned a default name — Untitled-1, 
Untitled-2, and so on — and the first page is displayed in the document 
window. At this point, you’re like a painter in front of a blank canvas. You can 
work on your layout without giving it a name, but you’re better off giving it a 
name by saving it as soon as possible so that you don’t lose any changes to a 
power outage or other system problem.
The second group of commands in InDesign’s File menu — Close, Save, Save 
As, Save a Copy, Check In, and Revert — provide options for saving the active 
(frontmost) document. Here’s a rundown of what each command does:
 
 Close (Ô+W, or Ctrl+W or Ctrl+F4) closes the active document. If the 
document has never been saved or if it has been changed since it was 
last saved, a dialog box lets you save, close without saving, or cancel 
and return to the document.
 
 To close multiple windows at once, use the shortcuts Option+Shift+Ô+W 
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+W.
 
 Save (Ô+S or Ctrl+S) saves changes you’ve made to the active document 
since you last saved. (If you choose Save for a document that hasn’t yet 
been saved, the Save As dialog box appears.)
 
 Save As (Shift+Ô+S or Ctrl+Shift+S) lets you save a copy of the active 
document using a different name (or with the same name in a different 
folder). When you choose Save As — and when you choose Save for 
an unsaved document — the Save As dialog box, shown in Figure 3-4, 
appears. This dialog box lets you create or choose a folder for the 
document, as well as name the document.
 
 Check In saves the current document as a version within a Version Cue 
project. This latest save will be considered a version of the previously 
saved file. (This expert feature is not covered in this book.)
 
 Save a Copy lets you create a copy of the active document in a different 
(or in the same) folder using a different (or the same) name. When you 
use the Save a Copy command, the original document remains open and 
retains its original name. It differs from Save As only in that it keeps the 
original document open.
 
 Revert undoes all changes you’ve made to a document since you last 
saved it.

58

dialog box.
 
Exporting document content
InDesign’s Save commands (Save, Save As, and Save a Copy) let you save 
documents and templates in InDesign’s native file format. But the Export 
command (File➪Export [Ô+E or Ctrl+E)) lets you save the stories — and in 
some cases stories and whole layouts — from InDesign documents in several 
formats: InDesign Interchange, Rich Text Format (RTF), Text Only, InDesign 
Tagged Text, Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), Portable Document Format 
(PDF), JPEG, Flash video (SWF), and Flash project (XFL).
 
The ability to export to the two Flash formats is new to InDesign CS4. Gone is 
the ability to export to the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image format.
Note that when exporting a file, you need to choose a format from the Format 
menu (Mac) or Save as Type menu (Windows).
Here are your format options in more detail:
 
 InDesign Interchange format: You can make your InDesign CS4 files 
readable by InDesign CS3 users by saving your files in the InDesign 
Interchange CS3 format. (Only InDesign CS3 and CS4 can open 
InDesign Interchange CS3 files.)

59
 Chapter 3: Opening and Saving Your Work
 
 InDesign Markup (IDML) format: This format can be opened only by 
InDesign CS4 or custom software designed to handle this new format. 
It’s essentially an interchange format for outsiders.
 
 Word-processing formats: If you place the text cursor into a story, you can 
export its text (select a range of text if you want to export only that selec-
tion) into one of two formats: RTF, for import into word processors with 
only basic formatting retained; and Text Only, for import into word pro-
cessors that don’t support RTF (with Text Only, note that no formatting is 
retained).
 
 You can save only one text file at a time. If you need to export several 
stories from the same document, you must do so one at a time.
 
 InDesign Tagged Text format: If text is selected via the Type tool, you 
can save the story in the InDesign Tagged Text format for editing in a 
word processor and later reimporting into InDesign with all formatting 
retained.
 
 Production formats: If text or a frame is selected via the Type tool or the 
Direct Selection tool, you can save the document — not just the story — 
in EPS or PDF formats for use by prepress tools and service bureaus or 
for import into other applications as pictures.
 
 Online formats: If text or a frame is selected via the Type tool or the 
Direct Selection tool, you can save the document — not just the story — 
in XML format for use in online database-oriented, content-management 
systems. (XML is an advanced feature not covered in this book.) You 
can save as a specific page, spread, or text selection into JPEG files for 
use as online graphics. 
 
 Multimedia formats: You can export your document to two Adobe Flash 
format: the SWF play-only format and the XFL format that lets you further 
work on the file in Adobe Flash Professional. Furthermore, the PDF format 
mentioned previously in this list can also contain multimedia elements, 
such as page transitions, sound, and video.
 
Two separate options are available for the entire document (no matter what 
tool is active) or for whatever objects are selected. One is File➪Export for 
Dreamweaver, which lets you export InDesign layouts to the structured 
HTML format for use in Web creation programs such as (but not limited to) 
Adobe Dreamweaver. The other is File➪Export for Digital Editions, which lets 
you create a special type of online multimedia document, called an e-book. 
Chapter 24 explains the basics for these two types of documents. Note that 
these two menu options had different names in previous versions of InDesign.

60
Part II: Document Essentials 
Recovering from Disaster
When you work on InDesign documents, make sure that you follow the first 
rule of safe computing: Save early and often.
InDesign includes an automatic-recovery feature that protects your documents 
in the event of a power failure or a system crash. As you work on a document, 
any changes you make after saving it are stored in a separate, temporary file. 
Under normal circumstances, each time you choose Save, the information in 
the temporary file is saved to the document file. The data in the temporary file 
is important only if you aren’t able to save a document before a crash. (A word 
of warning: Although InDesign’s automatic recovery feature is a nice safety net, 
you should still be careful to save your work often.)
If you suffer a system crash, follow these steps to recover your most recent 
changes:
 
1. Relaunch InDesign or, if necessary, restart your computer and then 
launch InDesign.
 
2. If automatic-recovery data is available, InDesign automatically opens 
the recovered document and displays the word “Recovered” in the 
document’s title bar.
 
 This “Recovered” indicator lets you know that the document contains 
changes that weren’t included in the last saved version.
 
3. If you want to save the recovered data, choose File➪Save (Ô+S or 
Ctrl+S).
 
 “Recovered” is removed as part of the filename, and InDesign asks 
whether you want to overwrite the old file.
 
 Overwriting the old file is easier than using File➪Save As (Shift+Ô+S or 
Ctrl+Shift+S) and entering a name — unless you do want to save a copy 
of the file in case you want to go back to the old version later. If you 
want to use the last saved version of the document (and disregard the 
recovered data), close the file (File➪Close [Ô+W or Ctrl+W]) without 
saving and then opening the file (File➪Open [Ô+O or Ctrl+O]).
Sometimes, InDesign can’t automatically recover the documents for you. 
Instead, it gives you the choice of recovering any files open during a crash 
or power outage, saving the recovery data for later, or deleting the recovery 
data. You typically want to recover the files immediately.

I
t’s a rare InDesign user who creates only one-page documents. Even if you 
spend your time working on business cards, ads, and posters, you prob-
ably produce at least a few multipage documents. And if you create newslet-
ters, newspapers, books, catalogs, or any other such multipage publications, 
you must know how to add pages to your document, move pages around if 
you change your mind, and delete pages if necessary. InDesign also lets you 
divide multipage documents into independently numbered sections.
As documents grow in size, getting around can be a real drag — on your time, 
that is. The longer you spend getting to the page you want, the less time you 
have to work on it. Fortunately, InDesign provides several navigation aids 
that make it easy to move around on a page or in a document.
Understanding the Pages Panel
The Pages panel is where you do most of your page actions, so you get to 
know it better as you use InDesign more.

62
Part II: Document Essentials 
If you intend to create a multipage document, you want to display the Pages 
panel (Window➪Pages [Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12]), shown in Figure 4-1, because it 
provides the controls that let you add pages (both document and master), 
delete and move pages, apply master pages to document pages, and navigate 
through a document.
For more information about using the Pages panel to work on master pages, 
see Chapter 5.
 
Figure 4-1: 
The Pages 
panel and 
its flyout 
menu, 
showing a 
facing-pages 
document.
 
Keep in mind that the overwhelming majority of multipage documents are 
facing-pages publications, such as books, catalogs, and magazines. Some 
exceptions are flip charts and three-hole-punched publications printed on 
only one side. In this chapter, the figures show examples of a facing-pages 
document. If you create a single-sided multipage document, the techniques 
are the same as for facing-pages documents, but the icons in the Pages panel 
show only single-sided page icons. (The icons aren’t dog-eared.)

63
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
Adding pages
A document can contain as many as 9,999 pages — more than anyone would 
ever want to have in one file. In general, try to break up long publications 
into logical pieces. For example, if you’re creating a book, it’s a good idea 
to create separate documents for the front matter, each chapter, the index, 
and any other parts (appendixes and so on). Also, if you’re producing a long 
document, you want to take advantage of master pages (covered in Chapter 
5), which save you the work of building each page from scratch.
 
When you create a multipage document, you’re free to add however many 
pages you want. But be careful: Even though InDesign will let you create a 
seven-page newsletter, in real life, facing-page publications always have an 
even number of pages — usually a multiple of 4 and often a multiple of 16 — 
because of the way printers arrange multiple pages on a single sheet of paper 
before folding and cutting them into the final document.
Here’s how to add pages to a document:
 
1. If it’s not displayed, open the Pages panel by choosing Window➪Pages 
(Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12).
 
2. From the Pages panel’s flyout menu, choose Insert Pages.
 
3. In the Pages field, type the number of pages you want to add.
 
4. Select an option from the Insert pop-up menu: After Page, Before 
Page, At Start of Document, or At End of Document.
 
 Be careful: If you’ve already started working on page 1, for example, make 
sure that you add new pages after page 1. Otherwise, it won’t be page 1 
anymore, and you’ll have to move the objects you already created.
 
5. Type a page number in the field next to Insert or use the arrows to 
increase or decrease the value in one-page increments.
 
6. From the Master pop-up menu, select the master page you want to 
apply to the new pages.
 
7. When you’re finished, click OK to close the dialog box.
 
InDesign offers a faster way to add and manipulate pages if you don’t happen 
to have the Pages panel already open: Choose Layout➪Pages and then select 
the appropriate option, such as Add Pages, from the submenu. The resulting 
dialog boxes match those accessed from the Pages panel.

64
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
If you want to quickly add just one page after the current page, click 
Layout➪Pages➪Add Page (Shift+Ô+P or Ctrl+Shift+P).
You can also add new pages or spreads one at a time at the end of a docu-
ment by clicking the Create New Page iconic button at the bottom of the 
Pages panel. (Spreads are added if a spread is selected in the Pages panel.) 
When you use this method, the master page applied to the last document 
page is applied to each new page. Pages are added after the currently 
selected page in the panel.
You can also click and drag a master page icon (or both pages in a facing-
pages spread to add a spread) from the top of the Pages panel to add a page 
using a master page’s settings (use the [None] page for a plain page) between 
any pair of document page spreads or to the right of the last document 
spread. If a vertical bar appears when you release the mouse button, the 
spread is placed between the spreads on either side of the bar. If a vertical 
bar doesn’t appear between document page spreads when you release the 
mouse button, the new spread is placed at the end of the document.
 
When you insert an uneven number of new pages into a facing-pages docu-
ment, existing pages are automatically changed from left-hand pages to right-
hand pages, and vice versa. You can prevent this change for selected spreads 
by first selecting them in the Pages panel and then clicking Keep Spread 
Together in the flyout menu. You may opt for this approach for a spread, such 
as a two-page table, that you don’t want to have broken apart when other 
pages are added or deleted. Of course, for proper printing, you may need to 
move that spread when you’re done adding or deleting pages so that it follows 
a complete spread.
Selecting pages
InDesign offers several choices for selecting pages from a document, so you 
can move, delete, copy, or otherwise manipulate them:
 
 Click a page’s icon in the Pages panel to select it.
 
 To select both pages in a spread, the easiest way is to click a spread’s 
page numbers to select both pages.
 
 To select a range of pages, you can click a page icon or spread number 
beneath it and then Shift+click another page icon or spread number.
 
 To select multiple, noncontiguous pages, hold down the Ô or Ctrl key 
and click page icons or spread numbers.

65
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
 
InDesign shows a preview image of your pages in the Pages panel. You can 
control the display by choosing Panel Options from the panel’s flyout menu. 
In the Panel Options dialog box, select the desired icon size and make sure 
that Show Thumbnails is checked. You can also set separate view settings for 
master pages.
Copying pages
You can copy pages from one document to another by clicking and dragging 
the page icons from the source document’s Pages panel to the target docu-
ment’s Pages panel. Any master pages associated with the copied document 
pages are copied as well.
You can also duplicate the current spread within the current document by 
clicking Duplicate Spread from the Pages panel’s flyout menu or by choosing 
Layout➪Pages➪Duplicate Spread.
Deleting pages
The fastest way to delete selected pages is to click and drag them to the 
pane’s Delete Selected Pages button (the trashcan icon) or simply click the 
Delete Selected Pages button.
Moving pages within documents
To move a page within a document, drag its icon between two spreads or 
between the pages of a spread inside the Pages panel. A vertical bar indicates 
where the selected page will be placed. Release the mouse button when the 
vertical bar is where you want to move the page. To move a spread, drag the 
page numbers beneath the icons (rather than the page icons themselves).
 
InDesign automatically scrolls the Pages panel’s pages as you move pages up 
or down.
Alternatively, you can select the pages you want to move in the Pages 
panel and then choose Move Pages from the Pages panel’s flyout menu. 
(If you don’t want to work through the Pages panel, you can also choose 
Layout➪Pages➪Move Pages.) In that dialog box, you can specify where to 
move the pages: after a specific page, before a specific page, at the beginning 
of the document, or at the end of the document.

66
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
Although you can move pages around in a document, do so only with great 
care — if at all. Generally, if you want to move the objects on one page to 
another page, it’s safer to cut (Edit➪Cut [Ô+X or Ctrl+X]) or copy (Edit➪Copy 
[Ô+C or Ctrl+C]) the objects than to move the page, which can cause subse-
quent pages to shuffle.
What’s the big deal about shuffling? Shuffling will move pages around to make 
space for the moved page, which can move what had been left-hand pages to 
the right-hand side of the spread and vice versa. If you have different align-
ments on left and right pages — such as having page numbers on the outside 
of pages — this shuffling can wreak havoc with that alignment.
 
If you absolutely must move a single page, it’s safer to move its spread. (Of 
course, if you’re working on a single-sided facing-page document, shuffling 
isn’t an issue.)
Moving pages among documents
You can also copy or move pages to other documents. Select the page in 
the Pages panel and then drag its icon to the document you want to copy 
or move it to. (You’ll need to have that other document window accessible 
by having it displayed in a tiled view, as described in Chapter 1.) The Insert 
Pages dialog box then appears, giving you a choice of where to insert the 
page in the new document as well as whether to copy or move the page into 
the new document. To move a page rather than copy it, be sure to check the 
Delete Pages After Inserting option.
Alternatively, you can copy or move pages among documents by choosing 
Layout➪Pages➪Move Pages or by choosing Move Pages from Pages panel’s 
flyout menu, either of which opens the Move Pages dialog box. Here, you 
also can select the destination (at which page number to insert the new 
pages) and which document you want to move the page into via the Move to 
pop-up menu. (The document must be open to display in that pop-up menu.) 
To move a page rather than copy it, be sure to check the Delete Pages After 
Moving option.
Figure 4-2 shows both the Insert Pages and Move Pages dialog boxes.

Starting documents on a left page
By default, InDesign starts all documents on the right page, which makes 
sense because the first sheet in a document is always a right-hand page. But 
sometimes you want documents to start on a left-hand page, particularly if 
they’re a chapter or section in a larger document. For example, magazine arti-
cles often start on a left page, giving the introduction a full spread. To start a 
document on a left page:
 
1. Select the first page in the Pages panel and then choose Numbering 
& Section Options from the panel’s flyout menu or choose 
Layout➪Numbering & Section Options.
 
2. Select the Start Page Numbering At option and enter an even number 
in the field.
 
3. Click OK.
 
 The Pages panel updates, showing the start page on the left of the spine.
 
 You may not want to assign a starting page number (for example, if 
the starting page number is unknown because the number of pages 
that precede this document is unknown and you let the book feature 
determine the page numbers later). In this case, repeat Step 1, but 
deselect Start Section. Doing so leaves the page as a left-hand page 
but lets the book feature figure out the page number.

68
Part II: Document Essentials 
See Chapter 22 for more information on the book feature and long-document 
creation. Sections are covered in the “Dividing a document into sections” sec-
tion, later in this chapter.
Working with Page Numbers
By default, pages are numbered automatically starting at 1, but you can 
change the page numbering from Arabic numerals to Roman numerals or 
letters, as well as change the start page to something other than 1. To do 
so, select the first page in the document in the Pages panel and choose 
Layout➪Numbering & Sections or choose Numbering & Section Options from 
the Pages panel’s flyout menu. You get the dialog box shown in Figure 4-3. (If 
the current page isn’t the first page in the document and if a section hasn’t 
been applied to this page previously, the dialog box is called New Section. Its 
options are identical.)
To change the initial page number, select the Start Page Numbering At option 
and type a new starting page number in its field. To change the page num-
bering style from the default of Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3, 4 . . .), use the Style 
pop-up menu and choose from I, II, III, IV . . . ; i, ii, iii, iv . . . ; A, B, C, D . . . ; and 
a, b, c, d . . . .

To have a facing-pages document start on a left-hand page, the starting page 
number must be even.

69
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
Dividing a document into sections
Some long documents are divided into parts that are numbered separately. 
For example, the page numbers of book introductions often use Roman 
numerals, while standard Arabic numerals are used for the body of the book. 
If the book has appendixes, you can apply a separate numbering scheme to 
these pages. In InDesign, such independently numbered parts are referred to 
as sections.
A multipage document can contain as many sections as you want. (A section 
has to contain at least one page.) If each section of a document uses a differ-
ent page layout, you probably want to create a different master page for each 
section. Here’s how to create a section:
 
1. If it’s not displayed, open the Pages panel by choosing Window➪Pages 
(Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12).
 
2. Click the icon of the page where you want to start a section.
 
3. Choose Numbering & Section Options from the panel’s flyout menu.
 
 If you’ve selected the document’s first page, the Numbering & Section 
Options dialog box appears (refer to Figure 4-3). Otherwise, the identical 
New Section dialog box appears. By default, the Start Section option is 
selected. Leave it selected.
 
 You can also create a section starting at the current page in your docu-
ment by choosing Layout➪Numbering & Section Options.
 
4. In the Section Prefix field, type up to eight characters that identify the 
section in the page-number box at the lower-left corner of the docu-
ment window.
 
 For example, if you type Sec2, the first page of the section will be dis-
played as Sec2:1 in the page-number box. This prefix won’t appear as 
part of the actual page numbers when you print — it’s really just a way 
for you to keep track of sections while you work.
 
5. From the Style menu, choose the Roman numeral, Arabic numeral, or 
alphabetic style you want to use for page numbers.
 
6. For Page Numbering, select the Automatic Page Numbering option if 
you want the first page of the section to be one number higher than 
the last page of the previous section.
 
 The new section will use the specified style; the previous section may 
use this style or another style.
 
7. Select the Start Page Numbering At option and type a number in the 
accompanying field to specify a different starting number for the section.

70
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
 For example, if a book begins with a section of front matter, you could 
begin the body section of a book on page 1 by choosing Start At and 
typing 1 in the field. If you select Continue from Previous Section, 
the first page of the body section begins one number higher than the 
numeral on the last page of the front matter.
 
8. In the Section Marker field, type a text string that you can later auto-
matically apply to pages in the section.
 
 You may want to enter something straightforward like Section 2 or, if 
the section is a chapter, the name of the chapter.
 
 You can insert the section marker name so that it prints in folios, 
chapter headings, and story text by choosing Type➪Insert Special 
Character➪Markers➪Section Marker. This technique is a great way to 
get a chapter name (if you use it as the section marker) in your folio or 
to have cross-references in text to a section whose name might later 
change. (A folio is the collection of a page number, magazine or chapter 
name, section name, or issue date, and so on that usually appears at the 
top or bottom of pages.)
 
9. Click OK to close the dialog box.
When you create a section, it’s indicated in the Pages panel by a small black 
triangle over the icon of the first page in the section, as shown in Figure 4-4. 
(If you move the mouse pointer over the black triangle, the name of the sec-
tion appears.) The page-numbering scheme you specify is reflected in the 
page numbers below the page icons. When you begin a section, it continues 
until the end of the document or until you begin a new section.
 
By default, the Pages panel displays section numbers beneath the icons 
of document pages. If you want to display absolute page numbers — the 
first page is page 1 and all other pages are numbered sequentially — 
you can do so by choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪General (Ô+K) or 
Edit➪Preferences➪General (Ctrl+K). Then choose Absolute Numbering from 
the General pane’s View pop-up menu.
Removing a section start
If you decide that you want to remove a section start, navigate to the page 
that begins the section, choose Numbering & Section Options from the Pages 
panel’s flyout menu, or choose Layout➪Numbering & Section Options, and 
deselect the Section Start option. That’s it! The pages in the former section 
remain, but their numbering now picks up from the previous pages.

Navigating Documents and Pages
Moving from page to page in a long document and scrolling around a large or 
magnified page are among the most common tasks you perform in InDesign. 
The more time you spend navigating to the page or page area you want to 
work on, the less time you have to do the work you need to do. Like most 
trips, the less time you spend between destinations, the better.
Navigating with the Pages panel
For navigating through the pages of a document, the Pages panel 
(Window➪Pages [Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12]) offers the fastest ride.
 When the Pages panel appears, you can use it to quickly move from page 
to page in a multipage document and to switch between displaying master 
pages and document pages. To display a particular document page, double-
click its icon. The selected page is centered in the document window. To 
display a master spread, double-click its icon in the lower half of the panel. 
(Note that you can reverse the order of master pages and regular pages in 
the Pages panel by choosing the Panel Options option in the flyout menu.)

72
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
The Fit Page in Window command (View➪Fit Page in Window [Ô+0 or 
Ctrl+0]) and Fit Spread in Window command (View➪Fit Spread in Window 
[Option+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+0]) let you enlarge or reduce the display magnifica-
tion to fit the selected page or spread in the document window. Related view 
options are View➪Fit Spread in Window (Option+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+0) and 
View➪Entire Pasteboard (Option+Shift+Ô+0 or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+0). (Note that 
the shortcuts use the numeral 0, not the letter O.)
Navigating with the menus and shortcuts
The oldest way to navigate pages in InDesign is via the Page-turning but-
tons, pop-up menu, and field at the bottom left of the document window, as 
described in Chapter 1.
InDesign also offers several menu commands and keyboard shortcuts to 
quickly navigate your layout, as Table 4-1 details.

 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
The New Navigator Option
You can use the navigator to move among 
pages: With the Hand tool selected, click and 
hold the mouse button to zoom and then move 
the mouse to move through the document’s 
pages, as shown in the figure. Release the 
mouse when you’re at the desired location. 
You’ll be put back to the original zoom level. 
If the autozoom is too fast, you can use the 
up and down arrow keys instead to manually 
move through various zoom levels. And if you 
decide you’ve navigated some place you didn’t 
mean to, just press Esc — as long as the mouse 
button is still pressed — to start over.
This navigator feature replaces the Navigator 
panel from previous versions of InDesign. I 
believe this approach is more useful for scrolling 
within a page, particularly for doing detail work 
on a page that’s displayed at a high magnifica-
tion, than for moving from page to page. But you 
get to decide what’s right for you.

74
Part II: Document Essentials 
Adjusting Page Layouts and Objects
If you’ve ever created and worked with a document all the way to the fin-
ishing touches and then discovered that the page size was wrong from the 
beginning, you know the meaning of frustration. Manually adjusting the size 
and placement of all the objects in a document is an ugly chore — one you 
want to avoid at all costs. However, should the unthinkable happen — you 
have to modify the size, orientation, or margins of a document that is 
partially or completely finished — InDesign can automatically resize and 
reposition objects when you change its basic layout.
For example, maybe you created a magazine for an American audience that 
subsequently needs to be converted for publication in Europe. Most news-
letters in the United States use letter-sized pages (8
1⁄2 × 11 inches), while in 
Europe the standard page size for such publications is A4 (210 × 297 mm), 
which is slightly narrower and slightly taller than U.S. letter size. Of course, 
you have to change color to colour, apartment to flat, and so on, but you also 
have to both squeeze (horizontally) and stretch (vertically) every item on 
every page to accommodate the A4 page’s dimensions.
The Layout Adjustment command (Layout➪Layout Adjustment) gives you 
the option of turning this chore over to InDesign, which automatically adjusts 
object shape and position according to the new page size, column guides, 
and margins.
The Layout Adjustment dialog box lets you turn layout adjustment on or off 
and specify the rules used to adjust objects when you change page size or 
orientation, margins, or columns. To adjust a layout, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Layout➪Layout Adjustment to display the Layout Adjustment 
dialog box, shown in Figure 4-5.
 
Figure 4-5: 
The Layout 
Adjustment 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Select the Enable Layout Adjustment option to turn on the feature; 
deselect it to turn it off.

75
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
 
3. In the Snap Zone field, type the distance within which an object edge will 
automatically snap to a guideline when layout adjustment is performed.
 
4. Select the Allow Graphics and Groups to Resize option if you want 
InDesign to resize objects when layout adjustment is performed.
 
 If you don’t select this option, InDesign will move objects but not resize 
them (the preferred option, so you don’t get awkward sizes).
 
5. Select the Allow Ruler Guides to Move option if you want InDesign to 
adjust the position of ruler guides proportionally according to a new 
page size.
 
 Generally, ruler guides are placed relative to the margins and page 
edges, so you probably want to select this option.
 
6. Select the Ignore Ruler Guide Alignments option if you want InDesign 
to ignore ruler guides when adjusting the position of objects during 
layout adjustment.
 
 If you think that objects might snap to ruler guides that you don’t want 
them to snap to during layout adjustment, select this option. If selected, 
InDesign will still snap object edges to other margin and column guides.
 
7. Select the Ignore Object and Layer Locks option to let InDesign 
move locked objects (either objects locked directly via Object➪Lock 
Position [Ô+L or Ctrl+L] or objects that reside on a locked layer).
 
 Otherwise, locked objects aren’t adjusted.
 
8. When you’re done, click OK to close the dialog box.
The Layout Adjustment feature works best when you don’t have much work 
for it to do. Otherwise, it usually creates more work than it saves. For exam-
ple, the switch from a U.S. letter-sized page to an A4-sized page is a relatively 
minor change, and the layout adjustments will probably be barely noticeable. 
But if you decide to change a tabloid-sized poster into a business card in 
midstream, well, you’re probably better off starting over.
Here are a few things to keep in mind if you decide to use InDesign’s Layout 
Adjustment feature:
 
 If you change page size, the margin widths (the distance between the left 
and right margins and the page edges) remain the same.
 
 If you change page size, column guides and ruler guides are repositioned 
proportionally to the new size.
 
 If you change the number of columns, column guides are added or 
removed accordingly.
 
 If an object edge is aligned with a guideline before layout adjustment, it 
remains aligned with the guideline after adjustment. If two or more edges 
of an object are aligned with guidelines, the object is resized so that the 
edges remain aligned with the guidelines after layout adjustment.

76
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
 If you change the page size, objects are moved so that they’re in the 
same relative position on the new page.
 
 If you used margin, column, and ruler guides to place objects on pages, 
layout adjustment will be more effective than if you placed objects or 
ruler guides randomly on pages.
 
 Check for text reflow when you modify a document’s page size, margins, 
or column guides. Decreasing a document’s page size can cause text to 
overflow a text frame whose dimensions have been reduced.
 
 Check everything in your document after the adjustment is complete. Take 
the time to look over every page of your document. You never know what 
InDesign has actually done until you see it with your own eyes.
 
If you decide to enable layout adjustment for a particular publication, you may 
want to begin by using the Save As command (File➪Save As [Shift+Ô+S or 
Ctrl+Shift+S]) to create a copy. That way, if you ever need to revert back to the 
original version, you can simply open the original document.
Using Layers
If you’ve ever seen a series of clear plastic overlays in presentations, under-
standing layers is easy. In one of those old overhead presentations, the 
teacher may choose to start with one overlay containing a graphic, add 
another overlay with descriptive text, and then add a third overlay con-
taining a chart. Each overlay contained distinct content, but you could see 
through each one to the others to get the entire message. InDesign’s layers 
are somewhat like these overlays, letting you isolate content on slices of a 
document. You can then show and hide layers, lock objects on layers, rear-
range layers, and more.
You can use layers in the following situations (and in many others):
 
 A project with a high-resolution background image: For example, a 
background such as a texture may take a long time to redraw. You can 
hide that layer while designing other elements and then show it occa-
sionally to see how it works with the rest of the design.
 
 A document that you produce in several versions: For example, a pro-
duce ad may have different prices for different cities, or a clothing cata-
log may feature different coats depending on the climate in each area. 
You can place the content that changes on separate layers and then 
print the layers you need.

77
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
 
 A project that includes objects you don’t want to print: If you want to 
suppress printout of objects for any reason, the only way you can do 
it is to place them on a layer and hide the layer. You can have a layer 
that’s used for nothing but adding editorial and design comments, which 
can be deleted when the document is final. (Even though InDesign sup-
ports nonprinting notes, they can be inserted only into text, so having a 
design-comments layer is still useful to be able to make annotations for 
frames, images, and other nontextual elements.)
 
 A publication that is translated into several languages: Depending on 
the layout, you can place all the common objects on one layer and then 
create a different layer for each language’s text. Changes to the common 
objects need to happen only once — unlike creating copies of the origi-
nal document and flowing the translated text into the copies, which 
you’d need to do for each language’s version.
 
 To ensure folios and the like are never overprinted: By placing stan-
dard elements, such as folios (the document’s page numbers, running 
headings, and so on), on their own layer, they’re uppermost in the layer 
stack. This order ensures that they’re never accidentally obscured by 
other objects.
 
 To help text print properly over transparent elements: Layers are also 
useful to isolate text above other objects with transparency effects. This 
isolation avoids the rasterizing of text during output to plate or film — 
something that can make the text quality look poor.
Layer basics
Each document contains a default layer, Layer 1, which contains all your objects 
until you create and select a new layer. Objects on the default layer — and any 
other layer for that matter — follow the standard stacking order of InDesign. 
(What’s the stacking order? Well, the first object you create is the backmost, the 
last one you create is the frontmost, and all the other objects fall somewhere 
in between. This order is how InDesign knows what to do with overlapping 
objects.)
Like the clear plastic overlays, the order of the layers also affects the stacking 
order of the objects. Objects on the bottom layer are behind other objects, 
and objects on the top layer are in front of other objects. For example, for a 
business card, the Default layer would contain the business card’s standard 
graphics and the main text. An additional layer would contain a different set 
of contact information — in separate text frames — for a different person. 
Each new person would have his information on his own new layer. Each 
layer has its own color, and frames will display in that color if frame edges are 
visible. (Choose View➪Show Frame Edges [Control+Ô+H or Ctrl+H.])

78
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
Although people often compare layers to plastic overlays, one big difference 
exists: Layers aren’t specific to individual pages. Each layer encompasses the 
entire document, which doesn’t make much difference when you’re working 
on a one-page ad but makes a significant difference when it comes to a 16-page 
newsletter. When you create layers and place objects on them, you must con-
sider all the pages in the document.
The Layers panel (choose Window➪Layers [F7]) is your gateway to creating 
and manipulating layers (see Figure 4-6).
 
Figure 4-6: 
The Layers 
panel and 
its flyout 
menu.
 
Working with layers
Each document contains a default layer, Layer 1, that contains all the objects 
you place on master pages and document pages. You can create as many 
layers as you need. After you create a new layer, it’s activated automatically 
so that you can begin working on it.
Creating a layer
The Layers panel (choose Window➪Layers [F7]) provides several methods 
for creating new layers. It doesn’t matter which document page is displayed 
when you create a layer because the layer encompasses all the pages in the 
document. To create a layer, do one of the following:
 
 To create a new layer on top of all existing layers, click the New Layer 
button on the Layers panel to open the New Layer dialog box. The layer 
receives the default name of Layer x.
 
 To create a layer above the selected layer, Ô+click or Ctrl+click the 
New Layer button. The layer receives the default name of Layer x.
 
 To create a new layer on top of all existing layers but customize its 
name and identifying color, Option+click or Alt+click the New Layer 
iconic button, or choose New Layer from the Layers panel’s flyout menu. 
Use the New Layer dialog box to specify options for the layer. (The New 
Layer dialog box — set with a custom name and color — is shown in 
Figure 4-7.)

79
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
 
Figure 4-7: 
The New 
Layer dialog 
box.
 
Customizing layers
You can customize the name, identifying color, guides, and lock status of 
objects on a new or existing layer. If you choose to customize the layer 
when you create it (by Option+clicking or Alt+clicking the New Layer iconic 
button or by choosing New Layer from the Layers panel’s flyout menu), the 
New Layer dialog box appears. If you choose to customize an existing layer, 
double-click it to display the Layer Options dialog box. (You can also choose 
Layer Options for Layer Name from the flyout menu on the Layers panel.)
Whether you’re using the New Layer dialog box shown in Figure 4-7 or the 
nearly identical Layer Options dialog box, the options all work the same:
 
 Name field: Type a descriptive name for the layer. For example, if you’re 
using layers for multilingual publishing, you might have a United States 
English layer, a French layer, and a German layer. If you’re using layers 
to hide background objects while you’re working, you might have a 
Background Objects layer.
 
 Color pop-up menu: Choose a color from the menu. A layer’s color helps 
you identify which layer an object is on. The color appears to the left of 
the layer name in the Layers panel and appears on each object on that 
layer. The color is applied to frame edges, selection handles, bounding 
boxes, text ports, and text wraps. By default, InDesign applies a different 
color to each new layer, but you can customize it to something meaning-
ful for your document and workflow.
 
 Show Layer check box: Selected by default, this control lets you specify 
whether objects on a layer display onscreen. Hidden layers also don’t 
print. The Show Layer option has the same effect as clicking the eye icon 
on the Layers panel.
 
 Lock Layer check box: Deselected by default, this option lets you con-
trol whether objects on a layer can be edited. You can lock a layer that 
contains boilerplate text or a complex drawing that you don’t want 
altered. Locking and unlocking layers is easy, so you can lock one layer 
while focusing on another and then unlock it. Select Lock Layer if you 
don’t want to be able to select items and modify them. For example, in 
a document containing multiple versions of text on different layers, you 
can lock the layer containing background images and other objects that 
stay the same. The Lock Layer option has the same effect as clicking the 

80
Part II: Document Essentials 
lock icon on the Layers panel. The Layers panel’s flyout menu contains 
additional locking options to, for example, unlock all layers and lock all 
layers but the active one.
 
 When you lock an object to a page (by choosing Object➪Lock Position 
[Ô+L or Ctrl+L]), the object’s position stays locked regardless of its 
layer’s lock status.
 
 Print Layer check box: Selected by default, this option lets you control 
whether the layer prints or exports to PDF. You can use this option for a 
layer containing design comments, for example. (In previous versions of 
InDesign, deselecting Show Layer also prevented the layer from printing. 
That remains true, but now you can control whether unhidden layers 
print or not as well.) You can also override whether nonprinting layers 
print in the Print dialog box, as explained in Chapter 25.
 
 Suppress Text Wrap When Layer Is Hidden check box: Deselected by 
default, this option prevents text wrapping around the layer’s objects 
when the layer is hidden. Be sure to select this option when you use 
multiple layers for variations of the same content, such as multilingual 
text or different contacts for business cards. Otherwise, your layer’s text 
can’t display because it’s wrapping around a hidden layer with an object 
of the same size in the same place.
 
 Show Guides check box: This check box lets you control the display 
of guides that were created while the selected layer was active. When 
selected, as it is by default, you can create guides while any layer is 
active and view those guides on any layer. When deselected, you can’t 
create guides. Any guides you create while that layer is active aren’t 
displayed, but you can still see guides that you created while other 
layers were active. Note that when guides are hidden entirely (choose 
View➪Grids & Guides➪Hide Guides or Ô+; [semicolon] or Ctrl+; [semi-
colon]), this command has no apparent effect.
 
 Lock Guides check box: This option works similarly to Show Guides in 
that it affects only the guides that you created while the layer is active. 
When deselected, as it is by default, you can move guides on any layer 
for which Lock Guides is deselected. When selected, you can’t move 
guides created while that layer was active. You can, however, move 
guides on other layers for which Lock Guides is deselected. Note that 
when all guides are locked (choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Lock Guides or 
Option+Ô+; [semicolon] or press Ctrl+Alt+; [semicolon]), this command 
has no apparent effect.
 
You can select multiple layers and customize them all at once. However, 
because each layer must have a different name, the Name field isn’t available 
in the Layer Options dialog box when multiple layers are selected.

81
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
Working with objects on layers
Whether you’re designing a magazine template from the ground up or modify-
ing an existing ad, you can isolate specific types of objects on layers. You can 
create objects on a layer, move objects to a layer, or copy objects to a layer.
The active layer is the one on which you’re creating objects — whether 
you’re using tools, importing text or graphics, clicking and dragging objects 
in from a library, or pasting objects from other layers or other documents. A 
pen icon to the right of a layer’s name means it’s the active layer. Although 
more than one layer can be selected at a time, only one can be active. To 
switch the active layer to another layer, click to the right of the layer name 
that you want to be active; the pen icon moves, making that the new active 
layer. Keep in mind that to activate a layer, it must be visible.
Selecting objects on layers
Regardless of the active layer, you can select, move, and modify objects on 
any visible, unlocked layer. You can even select objects on different layers 
and manipulate them.
The Layers panel (choose Window➪Layers [F7]) helps you work with 
selected objects in the following ways:
 
 To determine which layer an object belongs to, match the color on its 
bounding box to the color that appears to the left of a layer name.
 
 To determine which layers contain active objects, look to the right of 
the layer names. A small square — the object icon — to the right of a 
layer name indicates that you have selected an object on that layer.
 
 To select all the objects on a layer, Option+click or Alt+click the layer’s 
name in the Layers panel. The layer must be active, unlocked, and visible.
 
To select master-page objects as well as document-page objects on a layer, 
you need to Option+Shift+click or Alt+Shift+click the layer name.
Placing objects on layers
To place objects on a layer, the layer must be active as indicated by the pen 
icon. Anything you copy, import, or create in InDesign goes on the active 
layer.
When you create objects on master pages, they’re placed on the default layer 
and are therefore behind other objects on document pages. To create objects 
on master pages that are in front of other objects, place the objects on a dif-
ferent layer while the master page is displayed.

82
Part II: Document Essentials 
You can cut and paste objects from one page to another, but have the objects 
remain on their original layer — without concern about the active layer. 
To do so, be sure the Paste Remembers Layers check box is selected in the 
Layers panel’s flyout menu before choosing Edit➪Paste (Ô+V or Ctrl+V).
Moving objects to different layers
When an object is on a layer, it isn’t stuck there. You can copy and paste 
objects to selected layers, or you can move them by using the Layers panel. 
When you move an object to a layer, it’s placed in front of all other objects 
on a layer. To select multiple objects, remember to Shift+click them and then 
move them in one of the following ways:
 
 Paste objects on a different layer. First cut or copy objects to the 
Clipboard. Activate the layer on which you want to put the objects and 
then use the Paste command (by choosing Edit➪Paste [Ô+V or Ctrl+V]). 
This method works well for moving objects that are currently on a variety 
of layers.
 
 Move objects to a different layer. Click and drag the object icon for the 
selected objects (to the right of a layer’s name) to another layer. When 
you use this method, it doesn’t matter which layer is active. However, 
you can’t move objects from several different layers to the same layer 
using this method. (If you select multiple objects that reside on different 
layers, dragging the box moves only objects that reside on the first layer 
on which you selected an object.)
 
 Move objects to a hidden or locked layer. Press Ô or Ctrl while you 
click and drag the selected objects’ object icon.
 
 Copy rather than move objects to a different layer. Press Option or Alt 
while you click and drag the selected objects’ object icon.
 
 Copy objects to a hidden or locked layer. Press Option+Ô or Ctrl+Alt 
while you drag the selected objects’ object icon.
Manipulating entire layers
In addition to working on objects and their layer positions, you can also 
select and manipulate entire layers. These changes affect all the objects on 
the layer — for example, if you hide a layer, all its objects are hidden; if you 
move a layer up, all its objects appear in front of objects on lower layers. 
Functions that affect an entire layer include hiding, locking, rearranging, 
merging, and deleting. You work on entire layers in the Layers panel.
 
The active layer containing the pen icon is always selected. You can extend 
the selection to include other layers the same way you multiple-select objects: 
Shift+click for a continuous selection and Ô+click or Ctrl+click for a noncon-
tiguous selection.

83
 Chapter 4: Discovering How Pages and Layers Work
Rearranging layers
Each layer has its own front-to-back stacking order, with the first object you 
create on the layer being its backmost object. You can modify the stacking 
order of objects on a single layer by using the Arrange commands on the 
Object menu. Objects are further stacked according to the order in which the 
layers are listed in the Layers panel. The layer at the top of the list contains 
the frontmost objects, and the layer at the bottom of the list contains the 
backmost objects.
If you find that all the objects on one layer need to be in front of all the 
objects on another layer, you can move that layer up or down in the list. In 
fact, you can move all currently selected layers up or down, even if the selec-
tion is noncontiguous. To move layers, click the selection and drag it up or 
down. When you move layers, remember that layers are document-wide, so 
you’re actually changing the stacking order of objects on all the pages.
Combining layers
When you’re just discovering the power of layers, you can create a document 
that is unnecessarily complex (for example, you may have put each object on 
a different layer and realized that the document has become too difficult to 
work with). The good news is that you can also merge all the layers in a docu-
ment to flatten it to a single layer. To flatten all layers:
 
1. Select the target layer (the layer where you want all the objects to 
end up) by clicking it.
 
2. Select the source layers (the layers that contain the objects you want 
to move) in addition to the target layer.
 
 Shift+click or Ô+click or Ctrl+click to add the source layers to the selection.
 
3. Make sure that the target layer contains the pen icon and that the 
target and source layers are all selected.
 
4. Choose Merge Layers from the Layers panel’s flyout menu.
 
 All objects on the source layers are moved to the target layer, and the 
source layers are deleted.
When you merge layers, the stacking order of objects doesn’t change, so the 
design looks the same, but with one notable exception: If you created objects 
on a layer while a master page was displayed, those objects go to the back of 
the stacking order with the regular master-page objects.

84
Part II: Document Essentials 
Deleting layers
If you carefully isolate portions of a document on different layers and then 
find that you don’t need that portion of the document, you can delete the 
layer. For example, if you have a United States English and an International 
English layer and you decide that you can’t afford to print the different ver-
sions, you can delete the unneeded layer. You can also delete layers that you 
don’t end up using to simplify a document.
When you delete layers, all the objects on the layer throughout the document 
are deleted.
Using the Layers panel, you can delete selected layers in the following ways:
 
 Click and drag the selection to the Delete Selected Layers iconic button.
 
 Click the Delete Selected Layers iconic button. The currently selected 
layers are deleted.
 
 Choose Delete Layer from the Layers panel’s flyout menu.
If any of the layers contain objects, a warning reminds you that they’ll be 
deleted. And, of course, the ubiquitous Undo command (choose Edit➪Undo 
[Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z]) lets you recover from accidental deletions.
 
To remove all layers that don’t contain objects, choose Delete Unused Layers 
from the Layers panel’s flyout menu.

 Using master pages
 Organizing with libraries
 Working with snippets
U
nless you enjoy continually reinventing the wheel, you’ll want to take 
full advantage of the features that InDesign offers to help you work 
more productively. After you make some important decisions about elements 
in your document that will repeat, page after page, in the same spot (such as 
page numbers, graphics, headers and footers, and so on), you want to set up 
mechanisms that make the process simple.
Fewer activities in life are less rewarding than doing the same job over and 
over, and publishing is no exception. Fortunately, InDesign includes some 
valuable features that let you automate repetitive tasks. In this chapter, I 
focus on three of them: templates, master pages, and libraries.
Building and Using Templates
A template is a prebuilt InDesign document that you use as the starting point 
for creating multiple versions of the same design or publication. For example, 
if you create a monthly newsletter that uses the same basic layout for each 
issue, but with different graphics and text, you begin by creating a template 
that contains all the elements that are the same in every issue — placeholder 
frames for the graphics and text, guidelines, and so on.

86
Part II: Document Essentials 
Creating templates
Creating a template is very similar to creating a document. You create char-
acter, paragraph, and object styles, master pages, repeating elements (for 
example, page numbers), and so on. The only thing you don’t add to a template 
is actual content.
Most often, you create a template after building the first iteration of a docu-
ment. After you have that document set up the way you like, you simply strip 
out the content (that first issue’s stories and graphics in your newsletter 
example) and save it as a template.
Here are the steps for creating a template:
 
1. Choose File➪Save As (Shift+Ô+S or Ctrl+Shift+S) to display the Save 
As dialog box.
 
2. Choose a folder and specify a name for the file.
 
3. Choose InDesign CS4 Template in the Format pop-up menu (Mac) or 
Save as Type pop-up menu (Windows).
 
4. Click Save to close the Save As dialog box and save the template.
 
If you’re designing a template that will be used by others, you may want to 
add a layer of instructions. When you’re ready to print a document based on 
the template, simply hide the annotation layer. (See Chapter 4 for more 
information about working with layers.)
If you didn’t know better, you might think that a template is exactly the same 
as a regular InDesign document. It is, with one major exception: A template 
is a bit more difficult to override. When you open a template, InDesign actu-
ally opens a copy and provides that copy a default name (Untitled-1, 
Untitled-2, and so on). The first time you choose File➪Save (Ô+S or 
Ctrl+S), the Save As dialog box appears, so you can give it a real name.
Modifying templates
As you use a template over time, you may discover that you forgot to include 
something — perhaps a paragraph style, a repeating element on a particular 
master page, or an entire master page. To modify a template, you have two 
options:
 
 Open it as a normal file, make your changes, and then choose File➪Save 
As (Shift+Ô+S or Ctrl+Shift+S) to save it again as a template (using the 
same name to overwrite the original template). To open a file as a normal 
file, be sure that Open Normal (Mac) or Normal (Windows) — the default 
option — is selected at the bottom of the Open a File dialog box.

87
 Chapter 5: The Joys of Reuse
 
 Open it as an original file (see Chapter 3), make your changes, and then 
choose File➪Save (Ô+S or Ctrl+S) to save it again as a template. To open 
a file as an original file, be sure that Open Original (Mac) or Original 
(Windows) is selected at the bottom of the Open a File dialog box —
forgetting to select this option is easy, so most people end up using the 
previous technique to resave the template.
Creating documents from templates
You can easily create a document from a template: Just open a template file 
and save it with a new name, making sure that InDesign CS4 Document — the 
default option — is selected in the Format pop-up menu (Mac) or Save as 
Type pop-up menu (Windows). Work on your document and continue to save 
changes normally.
A more complicated way to create a document from a template is to choose 
File➪New➪Document from Template. This command opens the Adobe Bridge 
program, which can contain InDesign templates that you open and then save 
as documents. Bridge is meant as a central place for all Creative Suite docu-
ments and many related files, such as color libraries, to help workgroups 
have one place for all their Creative Suite needs. It’s more complicated than it 
is useful, at least for InDesign users. (Many Photoshop users love it.)
Building and Using Master Pages
A master page is a preconstructed page layout that you can use to create new 
pages — it’s the starting point for document pages. Typically, master pages 
contain text and graphic elements, such as page numbers, headers, foot-
ers, and so on, which appear on all pages of a publication. Master pages also 
include guidelines that indicate page edges, column boundaries, and margins, 
as well as other manually created guidelines to aid page designers in placing 
objects. By placing items on master pages, you save yourself the repetitive 
work of placing the same items one by one on each and every document page.
Don’t confuse master pages with templates. Think of a master page for use 
within a document; with master pages, you can apply consistent formatting 
to document pages when desired, and you can have multiple master pages 
in a document so that you can easily format different kinds of pages. By con-
trast, a template is simply a document that, when you save it, you must pro-
vide a new name. Templates contain document pages, master pages, color 
swatches, style sheets — the entire file. You use templates for documents 
you want to reuse as a whole, such as each month’s edition of a newsletter or 
each new title in a book series.

88
Part II: Document Essentials 
It may surprise you to know that every InDesign document you create already 
contains a master page, called A-Master. Whether you use the default master 
page or create and use additional master pages depends on what kind of docu-
ment you want to create. If it’s a single-page document, such as a flier or an ad, 
you don’t need master pages at all, so you can just ignore them. However, if 
you want to create a document with multiple pages — a brochure or booklet, 
for example — master pages save time and help ensure consistent design.
Creating a new master page
When you’re ready to create a new master page, here’s what you do:
 
1. If the Pages panel isn’t displayed, choose Windows➪Pages (Ô+F12 or 
Ctrl+F12).
 
 The Pages panel is covered in more detail in Chapter 4.
 
2. From the Pages panel’s flyout menu, choose New Master.
 
 You can also hold Option+Ô or Ctrl+Alt and click the Create New Page 
iconic button at the bottom of the panel. The New Master dialog box, 
shown in Figure 5-1, appears.
 
Figure 5-1: 
The New 
Master 
dialog box.
 
 
3. In the Prefix field, specify a one-character prefix to attach to the front 
of the master page name and display on associated document page 
icons in the Pages panel.
 
 The default will be a capital letter, such as the A in Figure 5-1.
 
4. In the Name field, give your new master page a name.
 
 It’s a good idea to use a descriptive name, such as Title Page.
 
5. To base the new master page (the child) on another master page (the 
parent), choose the parent master page from the Based on Master 
pop-up menu.
 
6. In the Number of Pages field, enter the number of pages you want to 
include in the master spread.
 
 For a document with a single-page design, enter 1; if the document will 
have facing pages, enter 2.
 
7. Click OK to save the page and close the dialog box.

89
 Chapter 5: The Joys of Reuse
Your new master page appears in the document window. The name of the 
master page appears in the Page Number field in the bottom-left corner of the 
document window. To make changes to a master page’s attributes, simply click 
its icon at the top of the Pages panel, choose Master Options from the panel’s 
flyout menu, and then change settings in the Master Options dialog box.
 
Note that you can move master pages to be at the bottom of the Pages panel — 
rather than at the top — by choosing Panel Options from the flyout menu and 
enabling the Pages on Top option.
When you’re building a master page, you should think more about the overall 
structure of the page than about details. Keep the following in mind:
 
 To build a document with facing pages, create facing-page master 
spreads. The facing pages are somewhat like mirror images of each 
other. Typically, the left-hand master page is for even-numbered docu-
ment pages, and the right-hand master page is for odd-numbered docu-
ment pages.
 
 To have page numbers automatically appear on document pages, 
add a page number character on each page of your master spreads 
by drawing a text frame with the Type tool where you want the 
page number to appear and then choosing Type➪Insert Special 
Character➪Markers➪Current Page Number (Option+Ô+N or Ctrl+Alt+N). 
The prefix of the master page (A, B, C, and so on) appears on the master 
page, but the actual page number is what appears on document pages. 
Don’t forget to format the page number on the master page so that page 
numbers will look the way you want them to in the document.
 
 Specify master page margins and columns by first making sure that 
the page is displayed in the document window and then choosing 
Layout➪Margins and Columns. The Margins and Columns dialog box, 
shown in Figure 5-2, is displayed. The controls in this dialog box let you 
specify the position of the margins, the number of columns, and the 
gutter width (space between columns).
 
Figure 5-2: 
The Mar-
gins and 
Columns 
dialog box.
 
You can place additional guidelines on a master page — as many custom 
guidelines as you want (see Chapter 10.)

90
Part II: Document Essentials 
Basing one master page on another
Some publications benefit from having more than one master page. If you’re 
building a document with several pages that are somewhat similar in design, 
it’s a good idea to start with one master page and then use it as a basis for 
additional master pages.
For example, if the brochure you’re working on uses both two-column and 
three-column page layouts, you can create the two-column master spread 
first. (Be sure to include all repeating page elements.) You can then create 
the three-column master page spread, basing it on the two-column master, 
and simply specify different column formats. The child master page will be 
identical to the parent except for the number of columns. If you later change 
an element on the original master page, the change will apply automatically 
to the child master page.
When you create a new master page, the New Master dialog box provides the 
option to base it on an existing master page. To help you keep things straight, 
when you base a master page on another master page, InDesign displays the 
prefix of the parent page on the icon of the child page.
 
If you base a master spread on another master spread, you can still modify the 
master objects (that is, the objects inherited from the parent master) on the 
child master page. As with regular document pages, you have to Shift+Ô+click 
or Ctrl+Shift+click the object inherited from a parent master to release it 
before you can edit it on a child master.
Basing a master spread on a document spread
You may be talented enough to create an effective spread, one that is so 
handsome that you want to create a master page from it to use on future 
documents. Simply highlight the spread by clicking the page numbers below 
the relevant page icons in the Pages panel and choose Save as Master from 
the Pages panel’s flyout menu. The new master is assigned a default name 
and prefix. To change any of its attributes, click its name in the Pages panel 
and then choose Master Options from the flyout menu.
Duplicating a master spread
Create a copy of a master spread by selecting its icon and then choosing 
Duplicate Master Spread from the Pages panel’s flyout menu or simply by 
dragging its icon onto the Create New Page button at the bottom of the panel. 
Note that if you duplicate a master spread, the duplicate loses any parent/
child relationships.

91
 Chapter 5: The Joys of Reuse
Importing a master page
Sometimes, another document has a master page that you’d like to use 
in your current layout. InDesign lets you import those master pages: Just 
choose Load Master Pages from the Pages panel’s flyout menu, select the 
source document in the dialog box that appears, and click Open. InDesign 
will import all master pages from that document into your current one. 
(Sorry, there’s no way to select specific master pages.)
If any of the imported master pages have the same name as your current doc-
ument’s master pages (such as the default name A-Master), a dialog box will 
appear giving you the choice of replacing the current master pages with the 
imported ones that use the same name or of renaming the imported master 
pages, so you keep what you have and add the imported ones. InDesign does 
the renaming for you.
Note that InDesign will also alert you if the imported master pages use dif-
ferent dimensions than the current document’s pages. It won’t adjust the 
imported pages, so some items may appear off the page if the imported 
master page has larger dimensions than the current document.
Deleting a master page
To delete a master page, select its name and then choose Delete Master Page 
from the Pages panel’s flyout menu. You can also drag the master icon to the 
Delete Pages iconic button at the bottom of the Pages panel.
So what happens when you delete a master page on which document pages 
are based? Don’t worry — your document pages are unchanged, though they 
no longer have a master page. (In the Pages panel, the page icons won’t dis-
play the letter of a master page in their upper outside corners.)
 
You can remove a master page from a specific document page without remov-
ing the master page from your document (and thus other pages), by applying 
the [None] master page to the document page using the process described in 
the following section.

92
Part II: Document Essentials 
Applying a master page 
to document pages
After you build a master page, you can apply it to new or existing document 
pages. (See Chapter 4 for information about adding and removing document 
pages.) For documents with facing pages, you can apply both pages of a 
master spread to both pages of the document spread, or you can apply one 
page of a master spread to one page of the document spread. For example, 
you can apply a master page with a two-column format to the left-hand page 
of a document spread and apply a master page with a three-column format to 
the right-hand page.
To apply a master page to a document page, select the name or icon of the 
master page in the top part of the Pages panel and then drag it onto the icon 
of the document page you want to format. When the target document page 
is highlighted (framed in a black rectangle, as shown in the left side of Figure 
5-3), release the mouse button. If both document pages are highlighted, and 
if you’re applying a master page to the document, both sides of the master 
spread are applied to the document spread.
 
Figure 5-3: 
Applying a 
single 
master page 
to a 
document 
page.
 
 
You can also apply a master page to the currently displayed pages by choosing 
Layout➪Pages➪Apply Master to Pages.

93
 Chapter 5: The Joys of Reuse
Changing master items on document pages
As you work on a document page that’s based on a master, you may find that 
you need to change, move, or delete a master object. Any change you make 
to a master object on a local page is referred to as a local override.
Whenever you remove a master object from a document page, you sever the 
object’s relationship to the master-page object for that document page only. 
If you subsequently move or modify the object on the master page, it won’t 
affect the deleted object on the document page — it remains deleted on that 
particular document page.
 
The Show/Hide Master Items command in the Pages panel’s flyout menu lets 
you show or hide master objects on document pages.
To change a master object on a document page, you must first select it, 
which can be a bit tricky. To select a master object on a document page, hold 
down Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift when you click the object with one of the selec-
tion tools. (You can also Shift+Ô+drag or Ctrl+Shift+drag to select multiple 
master objects within the selection marquee.) After you select a master 
object on a document page, you can modify it just as you would objects that 
aren’t part of a master page.
 
If you modify one or more master objects on a document page and then 
decide you want to revert to using the original master objects, you can 
remove the local overrides. To do so, display the document page that con-
tains the master objects you’ve modified, select the objects, and then choose 
Remove Selected Local Overrides from the Pages panel’s flyout menu. If 
no objects are selected, the command name changes to Remove All Local 
Overrides. If the selected spread doesn’t have any modified master objects, 
the command isn’t available.
Sometimes, you don’t want people to have the ability to override a master 
page object. InDesign gives you a way to block such overrides: With the 
master page open and any objects selected that you don’t want to be over-
ridden, deselect Allow Master Item Overrides on Selection in the Pages 
panel’s flyout menu. With this option deselected, someone won’t be able 
to override the selected master page objects on any document pages using 
them — unless, of course, they reselect the Allow Master Item Overrides on 
Selections option.

94
Part II: Document Essentials 
Building and Using Libraries
An InDesign library is a file — similar in some ways to a document file — 
where you can store individual objects (graphics, text, and so on), groups 
and nested objects, ruler guides, and grids (see Chapter 10). Once an item is 
in a library, every time you need a copy, you simply drag it out of the library.
Creating a library
Creating a library is easy:
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Library.
 
 The New Library dialog box appears, with essentially the same options 
as the Save As dialog box (see Chapter 3).
 
2. Choose a location in which to save the library.
 
3. Give the library a name.
 
4. Click OK.
You can create as many libraries as you want and store them wherever is 
most convenient, including on a networked server so that other InDesign 
users can share them. You can also open libraries created on a Mac from a 
Windows computer, and vice versa.
Right after you create a new library, you see an empty library panel group. 
Each library that you create or open will appear as its own panel within that 
panel group, with its name displayed in its tab, as shown in Figure 5-4. To add 
items to the library, you simply drag them to the desired panel.
Here is an explanation of some of the controls and commands shown in 
Figure 5-4:
 
 The numbers in the lower-left corner of the panel indicate the number of 
items currently displayed in the pane and the number of items in the library.
 
 The Library Item Information iconic button displays the Item 
Information dialog box, as does the Library Item flyout menu option. 
Here, you can give each library item a name, a type (for example, image 
or text), and a description. Later, you can search for library items based 
on these attributes.
 
 The Show Library Subset iconic button displays a dialog box that lets 
you locate and display items that meet certain search criteria, as does 
the Show Subset flyout menu option.
 
 The Delete Library Item iconic button lets you delete highlighted items 
in the library, as does the Delete Item(s) flyout menu option.

Why you’ll love snippets
InDesign has a neat option called snippets 
that lets you take pieces of your document 
and create a file that other InDesign users can 
bring into their documents, preserving all for-
matting and effects applied to them. Snippets 
in InDesign CS4 have the filename extension 
.idms; snippets in previous versions have the 
filename extension ,inds — InDesign CS4 
can work with both types.
Snippets are sort of like libraries, with a key 
exception: Each snippet is a separate file, so 
they’re not as easy or as convenient as libraries 
when you have lots of document pieces that you 
want to share or make available for reuse. So 
snippets are best for sharing specific elements 
on an as-needed basis, whereas libraries are 
better for having, well, a library of standard, 
shared elements. For example, a snippet is a 
great way to give another designer a specific 
element, such as a masthead or a format-
ted photo, for use in their own documents — 
especially by e-mail, because snippets are 
easily shared as file attachments. By contrast, a 
library is meant to keep in one place a bunch of 
objects you intend to use over and over again.
The process of creating snippets is easy: 
Select the objects and drag them outside your 
document window onto the Mac or Windows 
desktop or onto a folder. InDesign automati-
cally creates the snippet file containing those 
objects and their formatting. You can also 
select the objects you want to be make the 
snippet from and choose File➪Export (Ô+E 
or Ctrl+E); choose InDeisgn Snippet from the 
Format pop-up menu (Mac) or Save as Type 
pop-up menu (Windows), select the destination 
folder, and then click Save.
You can then send that snippet to other users 
on storage drives, via e-mail, or over the 
network — like any other file.
To use the snippet in another document, just 
drag the snippet into your document window. 
That’s it!

Part II: Document Essentials 
Putting items into a library
You can place individual items, such as text and graphics frames, into a 
library. You can also place multiple selected objects, groups, nested frames, 
ruler guides, guidelines, and all items on a document page.
To add items to a library:
 
 Select one or more items and then drag them into an open library panel. 
(Open an existing library by choosing File➪Open [Ô+O or Ctrl+O].)
 
 Select one or more items and then choose Add Item from the flyout 
menu of an open Library panel.
 
 Choose Add All Items on Page from the flyout menu of an open Library 
panel to add all items on the current page or spread as one library item. 
Choose Add All Items on Page as Separate Objects to add each object on 
the page in one step as separate library items.
 
 Select one or more items and then click the New Library Item iconic 
button at the bottom of an open Library panel.
 
If you hold down the Option or Alt key when adding an item to a library, the 
Item Information dialog box is displayed. This dialog box lets you add search-
able attributes to the library item.
If you import a graphic into a document and then place a copy of the graphic 
into a library, the path to the original graphics file is saved, as are any transfor-
mations you’ve applied to the graphic or its frame (scale, rotation, shear, and 
so on). If you save text in a library, all formatting, including styles, is retained.
Tagging library items
A library can hold as many items as you want. As a library grows, locating a 
particular item can become increasingly difficult. To make InDesign library 
items easier to find, tag them with several searchable attributes.
To tag a library element:
 
1. Select the library element and then choose Item Information from the 
library panel’s flyout menu.
 
 You can also display the Item Information dialog box by double-clicking 
a library item or by clicking once on a library item and then clicking 
the Library Item Information iconic button at the bottom of the library 
panel. (It’s the i in a circle.)
 
2. Specify a Name, Object Type, and/or Description.
 
 In the Description field, use a few words that describe the object so that 
you can easily find it later.

 Chapter 5: The Joys of Reuse
 
3. Click OK to close the dialog box and return to the document.
Searching for library items
You can search for library items based on the information specified in the 
Item Information dialog box. For example, if you place several different icons 
into a library that includes many other items, and if you use the term icon in 
the Name or Description field, a search of these fields that includes “icon” 
will find and display those items stored in your library.
Follow these steps to search a library:
 
1. Choose Show Subset from a library panel’s flyout menu or click the 
Show Library Subset iconic button at the bottom of the panel.
 
2. Decide whether to search the entire library or only the items cur-
rently displayed in the page and select the appropriate radio button.
 
3. In the Parameters area, choose the Item Information category you 
want to search from the first pop-up menu.
 
 Your choices are Item Name, Creation Date, Object Type, and Description.
 
4. From the next pop-up menu, choose Contains if you intend to search 
for text contained in the chosen category; choose Doesn’t Contain if 
you want to exclude items that contain the text you specify.
 
5. In the Parameter’s area text-entry field, type the word or phrase you 
want to search for (if you selected Contains in Step 4) or exclude (if 
you selected Doesn’t Contain).
 
6. Add more search criteria by clicking the More Choices button; reduce 
the number of search criteria by clicking Fewer Choices.
 
 You can create up to five levels of search criteria. If you select two or 
more levels of search criteria, you will be able to choose whether to dis-
play items that match all search criteria (by selecting Match All) or 
to display items that match any of the search criteria (by selecting 
Match Any One).
 
7. Click OK to conduct the search and close the dialog box.
The library items that match the search criteria are displayed in the panel 
(unless no items matched the search criteria). To display all items after con-
ducting a search, choose Show All from the Library panel’s flyout menu.
Deleting items from a library
To delete a library item, drag its icon to the trashcan icon at the bottom of 
the panel or select the item and then choose Delete Item(s) from the library 
panel’s flyout menu. You can select a range of items by clicking the first one 
and then Shift+clicking the last one. You can select multiple, noncontiguous 
items by holding down the Ô or Ctrl key and clicking each icon.

98
Part II: Document Essentials 
Copying library items 
onto document pages
After an item is in a library, you can place copies of that library item into any 
document or into another library. To place a copy of a library item onto the 
currently displayed document page, drag the item’s icon from the library 
panel onto the page. As you drag, the outline of the library item is displayed. 
Release the mouse button when the outline of the item is positioned where 
you want it to end up. You can also place a library item onto a document by 
clicking its icon and then choosing Place Item(s) from the flyout menu.
 
Copy an item from one library to another by dragging its icon from the source 
library panel onto the target library panel. To move (rather than copy) an item 
from one library to another, hold down the Option or Alt key when dragging 
and dropping an item between libraries.
Managing library panels
You can close an individual library panel by clicking its close box or choos-
ing Close Library from its flyout menu. You can close all libraries at once by 
clicking the panel group’s close box.
You can move panels into their own panel groups by dragging their tab out-
side their current panel groups. Likewise, you can combine library panels by 
dragging them by their tabs into another panel group (including those that 
contain nonlibrary panels).

ou see the world in glorious color. Yet not all publications take advan-
tage of that fact, typically for budget reasons. But when you do have 
color available, take advantage of it: It brings a visual dimension that taps into 
brains, creating a level of raw visual interest unmatched by anything else.
To take advantage of human beings’ color hot buttons, InDesign offers the 
ability to create and apply colors in many creative ways. But even if you 
can’t use color in every document, some of the techniques described here — 
especially for tints and gradients — can help a staid black-and-white 
document get new panache through shades of gray.
Working with Colors
InDesign comes with only a few predefined colors: black, registration (black on 
each negative for the printing press), paper (white), none (transparent), cyan, 
magenta, yellow, red, green, and blue. You’ll likely want to add a few of your own.
Creating color swatches
Before you can apply any colors — whether to bitmap images or to layout 
elements, such as strokes, text, frames, and shapes — you must first define 
the colors in the Swatches panel (Window➪Swatches [F5]). You can also 
import colors from other Adobe programs and from some color images.

100
Part II: Document Essentials 
No matter how you define colors, you have a couple of decisions to make 
first:
 
 Do you want to create your own color by mixing basic colors, such as 
red, green, and blue (called RGB and typically used for documents like 
Web pages and PDF files displayed on-screen); or cyan, yellow, magenta, 
and black (called CMYK, or process colors, and typically used for printing 
presses and by inkjet printers)?
 
 Do you want to use a color from an ink maker like Pantone or Toyo? 
These colors — called spot colors — are typically used as an extra ink on 
your professionally printed document, but can also be converted to the 
standard four-process colors and so are handy when you know the color 
you want when you see it.
How do you tell what kind of color a specific swatch is? Look at the icons to 
the right of the swatch name. In Figure 6-1, you can see that Pantone 1675U 
is a process color (the gray square) defined as CMYK (the square made up of 
four triangles). Nik Yellow is a spot color (the circle-in-a-square icon) defined 
from CMYK colors (that four-triangle square again). Hex:468966 is a process 
color (the gray square) defined as RGB (the square made up of three stripes). 
Finally, Muddy Yellow is a mixed-ink color (the multiple-drops icon), which is 
explained in the “Creating mixed colors” section, later in this chapter.
 
All the color-creation tools in InDesign support both process and spot colors, 
and all have access to the predefined colors like Pantone and Toyo as well as 
to the free-form color pickers for mixing CMYK or RGB colors. If you plan to 
print the color on its own plate, you need to use a predefined color so that 
you know the printer can reproduce it. If you plan to color-separate a color 
into the four CMYK plates, it doesn’t matter whether you use a predefined 
color or make one of your own. One advantage to using a predefined color is 
that it’s easy to tell other designers what the color is; another is that you’ll get 
very close matches if you start with a predefined color and then end up having 
it color-separated in some documents and kept as a spot color in others.
All colors in the Swatches panel receive a unique name and are tracked by 
InDesign. Each color is available to be used on any object in your docu-
ment, with no risk of having slightly different variants. Plus, you can modify 
a swatch and ensure that all objects using that swatch are updated. You 
can also delete a swatch and tell InDesign which color to use in its place. 
Furthermore, when you print, you have control over how each color is 
handled (whether it’s printed to its own plate, whether it’s printed at all, and 
whether you need to make any adjustments to its ink density or screening 
angle). Figure 6-1 shows the Swatches panel.
 
If no document is open when you create, edit, or delete colors, the new color 
palette becomes the default for all future documents.

To create your own color, go to the Swatches panel and select New Color 
Swatch from the flyout menu. The New Color Swatch dialog box, shown in 
Figure 6-2, appears. Now follow these steps:

colors.
 
 
1. In the Swatch Name field, give your color a name that describes it, 
such as Lemon Yellow or Blood Red.
 
 To do so, uncheck the Name with Color Value option. (If left checked, 
InDesign names the color for you based on its color values; see an exam-
ple at the top of Figure 6-2.) Note that this option is not available for 
swatch-based colors such as Pantone — you can’t change their names 
(that would confuse the printer as to what ink to use).

102
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
2. In the Color Type pop-up menu, choose from Process or Spot.
 
3. In the Color Mode pop-up menu, choose the mixing system or swatch 
library (both are considered to be color models) you’ll use:
 
• CMYK: Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black are the colors used in 
professional printing presses and many color laser printers.
 
• RGB: Red, green, and blue are the colors used on a computer mon-
itor, for CD-based or Web-based documents, and for some color 
printers.
 
• Lab: Luminosity, A axis, B axis, is a way of defining colors created 
by the international standards group Commission Internationale de 
l’Éclairage (the CIE, which translates to International Commission 
on Illumination in English).
 
• A swatch-based model: Sets of premixed colors from various ven-
dors, including ANPA, DIC, Focoltone, HKS, Pantone, Toyo Ink, and 
Trumatch for print documents, as well as a Web-specific set and 
sets specific to Windows and the Mac OS for on-screen documents.
 
• Other Library: InDesign also has the Other Library option from 
which you can select any color, tint, or gradient swatch library file 
in the old Adobe Illustrator 8 format. (You can’t use Illustrator’s 
patterned swatches, but don’t worry if the swatch file contains 
them: InDesign will simply ignore them.)
 
4. For the CMYK, RGB, and Lab models, use the sliders to create your 
new color; for the swatch-based models, scroll through the lists of 
colors and select one.
 
 A preview appears in the box on the left.
 
5. If you want to create multiple colors, click Add after each color defi-
nition and then click Done when you’re finished; to create just one 
color, click OK instead of Add.
 
 You can also click Cancel to abort the current color definition.
The most popular swatch libraries used by North American professional 
publishers are those from Pantone, whose Pantone Matching System (PMS) 
is the de facto standard for most publishers in specifying spot-color inks. 
The Pantone swatch libraries come in several variations, of which InDesign 
includes 13. Most of the time, you’ll use one of the following four:
 
 Pantone Process Coated: Use this library when you color-separate 
Pantone colors and your printer uses the standard Pantone-brand 
process-color inks. (These colors reproduce reliably when color-sepa-
rated, while the other Pantone swatch libraries’ colors often don’t.)
 
 Pantone Solid Coated: Use this library when your printer will use actual 
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to coated paper stock.

103
 Chapter 6: Working with Color
 
 Pantone Solid Matte: Use this library when your printer will use actual 
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to matte-finished paper stock.
 
 Pantone Solid Uncoated: Use this library when your printer will use actual 
Pantone inks (as spot colors) when printing to uncoated paper stock.
 
Color swatches based on the CMYK colors — such as Focoltone, Pantone 
Process, and Trumatch — will accurately color-separate and thus print accu-
rately on a printing press because a printing press uses the CMYK colors. 
Other swatches’ colors often don’t color-separate accurately because they’re 
supposed to represent special inks that may have added elements like metals 
and clays designed to give metallic or pastel appearances that simply can’t 
be replicated by combining cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Similarly, some 
colors (like several hues of orange and green) can’t be accurately created 
using the CMYK colors.
The bad way to create colors
Many people try to use the Color panel 
(Window➪Color [F6]) to define colors, which 
can be a mistake. At first, you may not realize 
that you can create colors from the Color panel. 
It shows a gradation of the last color used and 
lets you change the tint for that color on the 
current object. But if you go to its flyout menu 
and choose a color model (RGB, CMYK, or Lab), 
you get a set of mixing controls.
So what’s the problem? Colors created through 
the Color panel won’t appear in your Swatches 
panel, so they can’t be used for other objects. 
They’re called unnamed colors because they 
don’t appear in the Swatches panel, but may be 
used by objects in a document, which can cause 
problems when you print. (Adobe added them to 
InDesign to be consistent with how Illustrator 
defines colors — a foolish consistency.)
Fortunately, you can prevent unnamed colors: 
If you go to the Color panel and modify a color 
without thinking about it, choose Add Unnamed 
Colors from the Swatches panel’s flyout menu 
to add the modified color to the Swatches panel. 
Of course, if you forget to do so, you have an 
unnamed color, so it’s best to think Swatches 
panel when you think about adding or editing 
colors instead of the more obvious Color panel. 
Even better, close the Color panel so that you’re 
not tempted to use it in the first place.
Similarly, don’t use this InDesign feature: the 
ability to create colors by double-clicking the 
Stroke and Fill buttons on the Tools panel, using 
a Photoshop-style color picker. As with colors 
created in the Color panel, you can rectify this 
sin by adding any colors created this way to the 
Swatches panel by using the Swatches panel’s 
Add Unnamed Colors menu item. Otherwise, you 
run the same risk as creating colors through the 
Color panel.

104
Part II: Document Essentials 
Using Kuler colors
 
There’s a Web site out there that lets users share palettes of colors they’ve 
created. The idea is to give people with little fashion sense sets of colors that 
work well together. InDesign CS4 lets you tap into these colors and add them 
to your Swatches panel, using the Kuler panel (Window➪Extensions➪Kuler)
You go to the Browse pane in the Kuler panel and choose from the color 
swatch palettes — called themes — already there. You can use the unlabeled 
pop-up menus at the top and the search field to narrow down your choices. 
Click one you want and then click the Add Selected Theme to Swatches 
iconic button at the bottom right of the panel. Repeat for each theme you 
want to copy.
You can create your own themes in the Create pane (as well as edit an exist-
ing theme; click the Create Theme in Create Pane iconic button in the Browse 
pane to do so). The options are mostly for expert users, but the principles 
aren’t too hard: For each of the five color swatches, use the color wheel to 
select new values or drag its current color (the circles) to a new location on 
the wheel. Click the Add Selected Theme to Swatches iconic button at the 
bottom right of the panel. You can also save the themes and upload them to 
the Kuler site for other users to enjoy.
Figure 6-3 shows both the Browse and Create panes of the Kuler panel.

105
 Chapter 6: Working with Color
Creating mixed colors
InDesign offers another type of color: mixed-ink color. Essentially, a mixed-
ink color combines a spot color with the default process colors (cyan, 
magenta, yellow, and black) to create new color swatches. For example, you 
can combine 100 percent Pantone Yellow with 10 percent Deep Brown to get 
a darker version of yellow (called a duotone, though InDesign doesn’t limit 
you to mixing spot colors with just black, as traditional duotones do).
To create a mixed-ink swatch, add a spot color swatch if none exists and then 
follow these steps:
 
1. Choose New Mixed Ink Swatch from the Swatches panel’s flyout menu.
 
 The New Mixed Ink Swatch dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 6-4.
 
2. Select the percentages of the spot color and any or all of the default 
process colors you want to mix and give the new color a name.
 
3. Click Add to add another mixed-ink swatch based on the current spot 
color.
 
 If you’re creating just one color, click OK instead of Add. You can click 
Cancel to abort the current mixed-ink color definition.
 
4. Click OK when you’re finished.
 
Figure 6-4:

Mixed Ink 
Swatch 
dialog box

a selected 
spot color 
with any or 
all of the 
default 
process 
colors to 
create new 
shades and 
variations. 

106
Part II: Document Essentials 
New Mixed Ink Group, a related option in the Swatches panel’s flyout menu, 
lets you create a set of colors from the same mix. You get to set the initial 
percentage of each color you want in the mix and the final value, as well as 
how many increments of each color you want. InDesign then takes all this 
information and creates a bunch of color swatches that combine each of the 
colors at each level so that you get a whole range of colors. The idea is to get 
a set of related colors created for you, such as a set of blue-green hues that 
range from light aqua to dark marine. Experiment with this expert feature to 
see what it can do for you.
Defining Tints
A tint is simply a shade of a color. InDesign lets you create such tints as separate 
color swatches — like any other color — so they’re easy to use for multiple 
items. The process is easy:
 
1. In the Swatches panel, select a color from which you want to create a 
tint.
 
2. Using the Swatches panel’s flyout menu, select New Tint Swatch.
 
 The New Tint Swatch dialog box, shown in Figure 6-5, appears.
 
3. Click and drag the slider to adjust the tint or type a value in a field on 
the right.
 
4. Click Add to create another tint from the same base color and then 
click OK when you’re finished.
 
 (If you’re adding a single tint, you don’t need to click Add; just click OK 
when done.)

Tint Swatch 
dialog box

colors; a

identical 
dialog box

Options lets 
you edit 
them. 

107
 Chapter 6: Working with Color
 
 Click Cancel if you change your mind about the current tint. Any new 
tint will have the same name as the original color and the percentage of 
shading, such as Sky Blue 66%.
 
 You can create a tint from a tint, which can be confusing. Fortunately, 
InDesign goes back to the original color when letting you create the new 
tint. Thus, if you select Sky Blue 66% and move the slider to 33%, you get 
a 33 percent tint of the original Sky Blue, not a 33 percent tint of the Sky 
Blue 66% (which would be equivalent to a 22 percent tint of the original 
Sky Blue).
You modify and delete tint swatches like any other color swatch, using the 
Swatches panel’s flyout menu.
 
You can also apply tints to objects without creating a separate swatch for 
each tint. After applying the color (described in the “Applying swatches” sec-
tion, later in this chapter), select the object and change the value in the Tint 
field of the Swatches panel or use its pop-up menu’s predefined tint values. 
Easy as pie!
Working with Gradients
A long-popular design technique is the gradient (also called a blend or gradu-
ated fill), which blends two or more colors in a sequence, going smoothly 
from, say, green to blue to yellow to orange. InDesign has a powerful gradient-
creation feature that lets you define and apply gradients to pretty much any 
object in InDesign, including text, lines, frames, shapes, and their outlines 
(strokes).
Creating gradient swatches
In the Swatches panel, where you define colors and tints, you can also define 
gradients. Just select the New Gradient Swatch option in the flyout menu. 
You get the dialog box shown in Figure 6-6. The first two options are straight-
forward, but the rest of the controls are tricky, so pay close attention:
 
1. Type a name for the gradient in the Swatch Name field.
 
 Picking a name is a bit more difficult than naming a color, but use some-
thing like “Blue to Red” or “Bright Multihue” or “Logo Gradient” that has 
a meaning specific to the colors used or to its role in your document.
 
2. In the Type pop-up menu, choose Linear or Radial.
 
 A linear blend goes in one direction, while a radial blend radiates out in 
a circle from a central point.

108
Part II: Document Essentials 
 
 
Stop points
Location controls
 
3. Select a stop point — one of the squares at the bottom of the dialog 
box on either end of the gradient ramp (the gradient ramp shows the 
gradient as you define it).
 
 The stop points essentially define the start color (the stop point on the 
left) and the end color (the stop point on the right). With a stop point 
selected, you can now define its color.
 
4. In the Stop Color pop-up menu, choose what color model you want to 
use — select from CMYK, RGB, Lab, and Swatches — for the selected 
stop point.
 
 The area directly beneath the pop-up menu changes accordingly, dis-
playing sliders for CMYK, RGB, or Lab, or a list of all colors from the 
Swatches panel for Swatches, depending on which model you choose.
 
5. Create or select the color you want for that stop point.
 
 If you selected Swatches in the Stop Color pop-up menu, you can select 
the [Paper] swatch — essentially, transparency or no color — as a stop 
point in a gradient. (Note that you may have to scroll through the list 
of swatches to find it; it’s near the top of the swatch list.) You can also 
click and drag swatches from the Swatches panel to the gradient ramp.
 
6. Repeat Steps 3 to 5 for the other stop points (you can have several).
 
 Note that the color models for the two stop points don’t have to be the 
same — you can blend from a Pantone spot color to a CMYK color, for 
example. (If a gradient mixes spot colors and process colors, InDesign 
converts the spot colors to process colors.)
Figure 6-6: 
The New 
Gradient 
Swatch 
dialog box.

109
 Chapter 6: Working with Color
You now have a simple gradient. But you don’t have to stop there. Here are 
your other options:
 
 You can change the rate at which the colors transition by sliding the 
location controls (the diamond icons) at the top of the gradient ramp.
 
 You can create additional stop points by clicking right below the gradient 
ramp. By having several stop points, you can have multiple color transi-
tions in a gradient. (Think of them like tab stops in text — you can define 
as many as you need.) You delete unwanted stop points by clicking and 
dragging them to the bottom of the dialog box.
Notice that a location control appears between each pair of stop points — 
that means each pair can have its own transition rate.
 
When you create a new gradient, InDesign uses the settings from the last one 
you created. If you want to create a gradient similar to an existing one, click 
that existing gradient before selecting New Gradient Swatch from the flyout 
menu. InDesign copies the selected gradient’s settings to the new one, which 
you can then edit. For example, you would first click a linear gradient and then 
select New Gradient Swatch to create a radial version of that existing linear 
gradient.
The Swatches panel shows the actual gradient next to its name. The pattern 
also appears in the Fill button or Stroke button in the Tools panel if that gra-
dient is currently selected as a fill or stroke, as well as in the Gradient button 
in that panel, whether or not it’s currently applied as a fill or stroke.
Understanding the Gradient panel
Just as it does with unnamed colors, InDesign lets you create unnamed 
gradients — gradients that have no swatches. Unlike unnamed colors, you 
can use these to your heart’s content because all colors in a gradient are 
converted to process colors and/or use defined spot-color swatches — so no 
unnamed colors are in their output. The process is pretty much the same as 
creating a gradient swatch (covered in the previous section, “Creating gradi-
ent swatches”), except that you select an object and then open the Gradient 
panel (Window➪Gradient). In that panel, you select a stop point and then 
choose a color to apply to it by clicking a color in the Swatches panel or in 
the Color panel. You create and adjust stop points here just as you do when 
defining a gradient swatch.
The difference? You can reuse gradients in the Swatches panel, whereas you 
can’t reuse gradients applied through the Gradient panel. But you can add 
them to the Swatches panel by Control+clicking or right-clicking the gradi-
ent in the Tools panel’s Fill or Stroke iconic button and then choosing Add to 
Swatches in the contextual menu that appears.

110
Part II: Document Essentials 
The Gradient panel can also manipulate gradient swatches: After you 
apply a linear gradient — whether via a gradient swatch or as an unnamed 
gradient — you can change the angle of the gradient, rotating the gradi-
ent within the object. Just type the desired degree of rotation in the Angle 
field to rotate the gradient’s direction by the value. Negative values rotate 
counterclockwise, whereas positive values rotate clockwise.
Note that you can’t rotate a radial gradient because it’s circular and, thus, 
any rotation has no effect. That’s why InDesign grays out the Angle field for 
radial gradients.
But you can still adjust the location of a radial gradient — as well as that of a 
linear gradient — by using the Gradient tool in the Tools panel. After apply-
ing a gradient to an object, select the Gradient tool and draw a line in the 
object, as shown in Figure 6-7:
 
 For a linear gradient, the start point of your line corresponds to where 
you want the first stop point of the gradient to be; the end point of the line 
corresponds to the last stop point. The length of the line determines how 
stretched or compressed the gradient is, while the starting point of the 
line determines how much the gradient is offset within the object. Also, 
the angle at which you draw the line becomes the angle for the gradient.
 
Figure 6-7: 
At left: The 
Gradient 
tool lets you 
set the off-
set, adjust 
the gradient 
length, and

ent blends)

111
 Chapter 6: Working with Color
 
 For a radial gradient, the line becomes the start and end point for the 
gradient, in effect offsetting it.
 
The Gradient Feather tool — accessed through the Gradient tool’s pop-out 
menu or via the shortcut Shift+G — acts just like the Gradient tool except that 
it starts with transparency as the initial “color,” as shown in Figure 6-7. See 
Chapter 8 for more on gradient feather and other lighting effects.
Managing Swatches
When you create colors, tints, and gradients, don’t go overboard and make 
too many. You’ll also find that different documents have different colors, 
each created by different people, and you’ll likely want to move colors from 
one document to another. InDesign provides basic tools for managing colors 
in and across documents.
Editing swatches
Modifying a swatch to change its settings is simple: Just double-click it in the 
Swatches panel. (You can also choose Swatch options from the Swatches 
panel’s flyout menu.) The Swatch options dialog box appears, a clone of the 
New Color Swatch, New Tint Swatch, or New Gradient Swatch dialog box 
(based on what kind of swatch you double-clicked).
The New Swatch and the Swatch Option dialog boxes do have a slight differ-
ence: The Swatch Option dialog boxes include the Preview option, which lets 
you see your changes in a selected object (if it’s visible on-screen, of course) 
as you make changes in the Swatch Options dialog box.
Copying swatches
To duplicate a swatch so that you can create a new one based on it, use the 
Duplicate Swatch option in the Swatches panel. The word copy is added to 
the name of the new swatch. You edit it — including its name — as you would 
any swatch.
 
When selecting swatches for deletion or duplication, you can Ô+click 
or Ctrl+click multiple swatches to work on all of them at once. Note that 
Shift+clicking selects all swatches between the first swatch clicked and the 
swatch that you Shift+click, whereas Ô+click or Ctrl+click lets you select spe-
cific swatches in any order and in any location in the panel.

Part II: Document Essentials 
Deleting swatches
InDesign makes deleting swatches simple: Just select the color, tint, or gradi-
ent in the Swatches panel. Then choose Delete Swatch from the flyout menu 
or click the trash can iconic button at the bottom of the Swatches panel.
Well, that’s not quite it. You then get the Delete Swatch dialog box, which 
lets you either assign a new color to anything using the deleted swatch (the 
Defined Swatch option) or leave the color on any object that is using it but 
delete the swatch from the Swatches panel (the Unnamed Swatch option). 
(As explained in this chapter’s sidebar “The bad way to create colors,” you 
should avoid unnamed colors so don’t choose the Unnamed Swatch option.)
 
If you delete a tint and replace it with another color, any object using that 
tint will get the full-strength version of the new color, not a tint of it. Likewise, 
if you delete a color swatch that you’ve based one or more tints on, those 
tints will also be deleted if you replace the deleted swatch with an unnamed 
swatch. However, if you delete a color swatch and replace it with a defined 
swatch, any tints of that deleted swatch will retain their tint percentages of 
the replacement-defined swatch.
 
InDesign offers a nice option to quickly find all unused colors in the Swatches 
panel: the flyout menu’s Select All Unused option. With this option, you can 
delete all the unused colors in one fell swoop. Note that you don’t get the 
option to assign each deleted color separately to another color in the Delete 
Swatch dialog box — they all are replaced with the color you select or are 
made into unnamed colors. Because no object uses these colors, choosing 
Unnamed Swatch in essence is the same as replacing them with a color using 
the Defined Swatch option.
If you delete a swatch and replace it with an unnamed swatch, you can recap-
ture that deleted swatch later by choosing the Add Unnamed Colors menu 
item in the Swatches panel’s flyout menu.
Importing swatches
A quick way to import specific colors from another InDesign document or 
template is to click and drag the colors from that other file’s Swatches panel 
into your current document or template.
You can import colors from other Creative Suite programs from which 
you have saved Adobe Swatch Exchange color library files, choosing Load 
Swatches from the Swatches panel’s flyout menu. You can also import 
swatches directly from other InDesign documents. From the resulting dialog 
box, navigate to the file that contains the colors you want to import, select 
that file, and click Open.

113
 Chapter 6: Working with Color
 
When you import color swatches from other documents or Adobe Swatch 
Exchange files, InDesign brings in all the colors. You can’t choose specific 
colors to import.
Also, when you import a graphic file in PDF or EPS format, any named colors 
(swatches) in that file are automatically added to the Swatches panel.
You can also use the new Kuler panel to import sets of color swatches. (For 
more on that topic, see the section “Using Kuler colors,” earlier in this chapter.)
Sampling colors
You may wonder how you can use colors in your 
imported graphics for which InDesign can’t find 
any swatch information, such as in TIFF files or 
photos embedded in a PDF file. As you may 
expect, InDesign provides a way to capture 
these colors: the Eyedropper tool. Here’s how 
it works:
 1. In the Tools panel or Swatches panel, 
choose the Fill iconic button or Stroke 
iconic button.
 
 It doesn’t really matter which button you use 
unless you’ll immediately create a shape or 
enter text after capturing the desired color; 
in that case, choose whichever aspect 
you’ll want the new object or text to have 
the color applied to.
 2. Select the Eyedropper tool and then click 
the graphic where the desired color is 
used.
 
 The Fill or Stroke iconic button now has that 
color. (If the Eyedropper tool isn’t visible in 
the Tools panel, look for the Measure tool 
and then click and hold down its icon to get 
the pop-up menu that lets you select the 
Eyedropper tool.)
 3. The Eyedropper tool changes to the Marker 
tool.
 
 Any object you select with the Marker 
tool will have the color applied to its fill or 
stroke, depending on whether the Fill or 
Stroke iconic button is active. Note that you 
can switch between the Eyedropper and 
Marker tools to select different colors and 
apply them by holding the Option or Alt key 
to get the Eyedropper tool back and then 
releasing it to switch to the Marker tool.
 4. To add the new, unnamed color to the 
Swatches panel, Control+click or right-
click the Fill iconic button or Stroke iconic 
button (whichever has the captured color) 
and choose Add to Swatches from the con-
textual menu that appears.
 
 Now you can edit and apply the captured 
color like any other color swatch.
The following figure shows a composite image 
that highlights the Eyedropper tool at center left 
(over the cat’s ID tag) and the Marker tool at 
right (over the rectangle at the bottom).

Part II: Document Essentials 
Exporting swatches
You can do more than import swatches. InDesign also lets you save swatches 
into color library files for use by other Creative Suite users. Just select the 
colors you want to save and then choose Save Swatches from the Swatches 
panel’s flyout menu. You are asked to give the color library file a name before 
you save it.
 
InDesign doesn’t include mixed-ink colors when you save swatches for use 
by other Creative Suite programs. Any selected such swatches are simply 
ignored.
(continued)

115
 Chapter 6: Working with Color
Applying Swatches
Applying colors, tints, and gradients to objects in InDesign is quick work. 
Select the object and then click the Formatting Affects Text button or 
Formatting Affects Container iconic button in the Swatches or Gradient panel 
as appropriate. If you’re using the Swatches panel, click the appropriate 
swatch; if you’re using the Gradient panel, adjust the gradient as desired.
 
When it comes to coloring graphics in InDesign, you can apply color and tints 
to grayscale and black-and-white bitmapped images, such as those in the TIFF 
and Photoshop formats. But you can’t color vector-based graphics (such as 
those in the Illustrator and EPS formats) or color bitmapped images.
Another way to apply colors, tints, and gradients is by selecting the object 
and using the Formatting Affects Text, Formatting Affects Content, Fill, or 
Stroke iconic buttons in the Tools panel to define what part of the object 
you want to color. You can use the Swatches or Gradients panels to select 
a swatch or pick the last-used color and gradient from the Apply Color and 
Apply Gradient iconic buttons near the bottom of the Tools panel.
For tints, you can use a tint swatch, or you can simply apply a color from the 
Swatches panel and enter a tint value in the panel’s Tint field.
When applying color to text, you can apply it to all the text in the frame 
by using the Formatting Affects Text iconic button (which is what the 
Formatting Affects Contents iconic button is renamed when you select text) 
or to specific text by highlighting that text with the Type tool.
 
You can also apply color as part of your character and paragraph styles in the 
Character Color pane when creating or editing styles. See Chapter 13 for more 
on styles, and Chapters 14 through 16 for more on text formatting.
You can also apply colors and tints to gaps in strokes. Open the Stroke panel 
by choosing Window➪Stroke (Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10), then select a color in the 
Gap Color menu (if you don’t see this option in the Stroke panel, select Show 
Options from the panel’s flyout menu).

Object Essentials

In this part . . .
T
he rubber really hits the road when you’ve got your 
basic layout structure in place. Now you can focus on 
the meat of your documents: the objects that contain your 
text and graphics. It’s amazing all the objects you can 
create — from simple rectangles to complex curves. And 
it’s equally amazing all the things you can do to objects, 
such as rotate them, color and align them, and apply 
special effects, such as drop shadows and directional 
feathers. And you can even save a lot of these settings so 
that you can apply them consistently to other objects 
later — a real timesaver that also ensures quality results. 
Note that you can apply most of these effects to objects 
whether or not they already contain their graphics and 
text — so if you’re a really structured kind of person, 
you’ll probably create your basic object containers first, 
apply your effects to them, and then bring in the text and 
graphics. But if you’re more free-form in your approach, 
you’ll likely bring in all your text and graphics and then 
start arranging the objects that contain them to produce 
your final layout. That’s fine. Either way, you just apply 
the techniques in this part while doing so.

 Creating frames and shapes
 Making lines and paths
 Using strokes
T
he fundamental components of any layout are its objects. This chapter 
explains how to create these building blocks: frames, shapes, lines, and 
paths, as well as the strokes you apply to them.
Working with Frames and Shapes
An object is a container that can (but doesn’t have to) hold text or graphics, 
as well as display attributes such as color, strokes, and gradients. When an 
object contains an imported graphic or text, or if an object is created as a 
placeholder for a graphic or text, it’s referred to as a frame in InDesign. 
Otherwise, it’s called a shape.
 
The difference between frames and shapes is artificial. Because a shape can 
easily become a frame simply by placing text or graphics into it, it’s easiest to 
think of shapes and frames as the same thing. I tend to use the word “frame” 
to mean either frames or shapes.
Designing pages in InDesign is largely a matter of creating and modifying 
frames and shapes, as well as modifying the text and graphics that the frames 
contain.
Creating frames and shapes
As Figure 7-1 shows, the Tools panel contains several tools for creating both 
shapes and frames:

120
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
 The Rectangle, Ellipse, and Polygon shape tools: The Ellipse and 
Polygon tools are available through the pop-up menu that appears if you 
click and hold on the Rectangle tool.
 
 The Rectangle Frame, Ellipse Frame, and Polygon Frame tools: The 
Ellipse Frame and Polygon Frame tools are available through the pop-up 
menu that appears if you click and hold on the Rectangle Frame tool.
 
 The Type tool: You can use this tool to create rectangular text frames in 
addition to letting you work with text.
Here’s how to create a frame (or shape):
 
1. Select the desired tool from the Tools panel.
 
2. Optionally, set up the polygon’s number of sides and the depth of its 
spikes.
 
 To do so, double-click the tool you’re using (Polygon or Polygon Frame) 
so the Polygon Settings dialog box appears. Figure 7-2 shows that dialog 
box and example starburst. Adjust the number of sides and their depth 
(the Star Inset field) as desired and then click OK. If you don’t adjust 
the polygon’s settings and instead just begin drawing on as in the next 
steps, InDesign will use the last-used settings for the selected tool.

3. Move the mouse pointer anywhere within the currently displayed 
page or on the pasteboard.
 
4. Click and drag in any direction.
 
 As you drag, a crosshair pointer appears in the corner opposite your 
starting point; a colored rectangle indicates the boundary of the frame. 
(The color is blue for objects on the default layer; objects on other 
layers have that layer’s color. See Chapter 4 for more on layers.) You 
can look at the width and height values displayed in the Control panel or 
the Transform panel as you drag to help you get the size you want. 
Holding down the Shift key as you drag limits the tool to creating a 
frame or shape within a square bounding box.
 
5. When the frame is the size and shape you want, release the mouse 
button.
Pretty easy, huh? At this point, you can begin typing in the frame, paste text 
or a graphic into it, or import a text or a graphics file, as Chapters 10 and 16 
explain.
 
If you create a text frame with the Type tool, be sure not to click in an existing 
text frame when your intention is to create a new one. If you click within an 
existing frame when the Type tool is selected, the flashing cursor appears, and 
InDesign thinks you want to type text.
When any of the frame-creation tools is selected, you can create as many new 
frames as you want. Simply keep clicking, dragging, and releasing. After you 
create a graphics frame, you can modify it (without changing tools) by adding 
a border or a colored background or by applying any of the effects — such as 
rotation, shear, and scale — in the Control panel. You can also move or 
resize a graphics frame, but you have to switch to the Selection tool or the 
Direct Selection tool to do so. Chapter 8 explains how to resize, move, delete, 
and otherwise manipulate frames and other objects.

122
Part III: Object Essentials 
Reshaping frames and shapes
Sometimes, a frame or shape needs to be more than resized or moved. It 
needs to be reshaped. InDesign makes it easy to change an object’s shape:
 
 The simplest way is to select an object with the Direct Selection tool and 
then drag any of the handles or frame edges. Notice how the frame’s 
shape actually changes, as shown in Figure 7-3.
 
 To change a shape more radically, choose the desired shape from 
Object➪Convert Shape’s submenu. Your choices are Rectangle, 
Rounded Rectangle, Beveled Rectangle, Inverse Rounded Rectangle, 
Ellipse, Triangle, Polygon, Line, and Orthogonal Line. (Note that if you 
choose Polygon, InDesign will use whatever the last polygon settings 
were, which you can see by double-clicking the Polygon or Polygon 
Frame tool. Also, if you try to convert a text frame into a line, InDesign 
will abort the action, telling you it can’t do the conversion.)
 
 You can manually edit a shape by adding or removing anchor points — 
the points in a shape’s edges that you can adjust, as described in the 
next section.
 
InDesign has a quick way to switch between the Selection tool and the Direct 
Selection tool: Just double-click an object. (Of course, the Direct Selection tool 
has no effect on text frames, so double-clicking an object selected with the 
Selection tool changes you to the Type tool instead.)

Creating Lines and Paths
When you’re drawing the old-fashioned way, with pen and paper, you typi-
cally use one tool to draw straight lines, curved lines, and free-form objects. 
InDesign is less flexible, using different tools for different kinds of lines. 
InDesign lets you create straight lines with the Line tool and zigzag lines, 

123
 Chapter 7: Adding Essential Elements
curved lines, and free-form shapes with the Pen and Type on a Path tools. 
(Those nonstraight lines and free-form shapes are called paths in InDesign.) 
Figure 7-1, earlier in this chapter, shows these tools on the Tools panel.
Drawing a straight line
Although not as flashy or versatile as shapes and paths, lines can serve many 
useful purposes in well-designed pages. For example, you can use plain ol’ 
vertical rules to separate columns of text in a multicolumn page or the rows 
and columns of data in a table. Dashed lines are useful for indicating folds 
and cut lines on brochures and coupons. And lines with arrowheads are 
handy if you have to create a map or a technical illustration.
Follow these steps to draw a simple, straight line:
 
1. Select the Line tool (or press \).
 
2. Move the pointer anywhere within the currently displayed page or on 
the pasteboard.
 
3. Click and drag the mouse in any direction.
 
 As you drag, a thin, blue line appears from the point where you first 
clicked to the current position of the cross-hair pointer. Holding down 
the Shift key as you drag constrains the line to a horizontal, vertical, or 
45-degree diagonal line.
 
4. When the line is the length and angle you want, release the mouse 
button.
 
 Don’t worry too much about being precise when you create a line. You 
can always go back later and fine-tune it.
When you release the mouse button after creating a line, the line is active. As 
illustrated in Figure 7-4, if the Selection tool was previously selected, the line 
appears within a rectangular bounding box, which contains eight resizing 
handles. If the Direct Selection tool was previously selected, moveable 
anchor points appear at the ends of the line. In either case, you have to 
choose the right tool if you want to change the shape or size of the bounding 
box or the line:
 
 The Selection tool lets you change the shape of the line’s bounding box 
(which also changes the angle and length of the line) by dragging any of 
the resizing handles.
 
 The Direct Selection tool lets you change the length and angle of the line 
itself by moving anchor points on the frame.
As long as the Line tool is selected, you can create as many new lines as you 
want. Simply keep clicking, dragging, and releasing.

Part III: Object Essentials 
 
Figure 7-4: 
A line

Selection 
tool (left) 
and the

When you create a line, it takes on the characteristics specified in the Stroke 
panel (Window➪Stroke [Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10]), covered in the “Applying 
strokes” section later in this chapter. When you first open a document, the 
default line width is 1 point. If you want to change the appearance of your 
lines, double-click the Line tool and adjust the Weight setting in the Stroke 
panel that appears. If you make this adjustment when no document is open, 
all new documents will use the new line settings.
Understanding paths
Paths are a lot more complex than lines, so you need to understand some of 
the theory behind paths so that you can create and manipulate them more 
easily.
Every object you create with InDesign’s object-creation tools is a path. 
Regardless of the tool you use to create a path, you can change its 
appearance by modifying any of four properties that all paths share:
 
 Closure: A path is either open or closed. Straight lines created with the 
Line tool and curved and zigzag lines created with the Pen tool are 
examples of open paths. Basic shapes created with the Ellipse, 
Rectangle, and Polygon tools and free-form shapes created with the Pen 
and Pencil tools are examples of closed shapes. A closed free-form shape 
is an uninterrupted path with no end points.
 
 Stroke: If you want to make a path visible, you can apply a stroke to 
it by selecting it with a selection tool, entering a Weight value in the 
Stroke panel (Window➪Stroke [Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10]), and selecting a 
color from the Swatches panel (see Chapter 6). (An unselected, 
unstroked path isn’t visible.)

125
 Chapter 7: Adding Essential Elements
 
 Fill: A color, color tint, or gradient applied to the background of a path 
is called a fill. You apply fills by using the Swatches panel.
 
 Contents: You can place a text file or a graphics file in any path except a 
straight line. When a path holds text or a graphic, the path functions as 
a frame. Although InDesign can place text or graphics in an open path, 
placing text and pictures in closed paths is far more common than 
placing them in open paths. In addition to putting text inside paths, you 
can also have text on the path itself, following its shape, as Chapter 17 
explains.
No matter how simple or complicated, all paths are made up of the same 
components. Figure 7-5 shows the parts that make up a path:
 
 A path contains one or more straight or curved segments.
 
 An anchor point is located at each end of every segment. The anchor 
points at the ends of a closed path are called end points. When you 
create a path of any kind, anchor points are automatically placed at 
the end of each segment. After you create a path, you can move, add, 
delete, and change the direction of corner points.
 
 InDesign has two kinds of anchor points: smooth points and corner 
points. A smooth point connects two adjoining curved segments in a 
continuous, flowing curve. At a corner point, adjoining segments — 
straight or curved — meet at an angle. The corners of a rectangular path 
are the most common corner points.
 
 A direction line runs through each anchor point and has a handle at both 
ends. You can control the curve that passes through an anchor point by 
dragging a direction line’s handles, as I explain a little later on.

Part III: Object Essentials 
Drawing your own paths
Even if you’re an artistic master with a piece of charcoal or a No. 2 pencil, 
you need to practice with the Pen tool for a while before your drawing skills 
kick in. The good news is that after you get comfortable using the Pen tool, 
you can draw any shape you can imagine. (Of course, if you can’t draw very 
well in the first place, using the Pen tool won’t magically transform you into a 
master illustrator!) If creating a free-form path is new terrain for you, start 
simply and proceed slowly.
 
When creating paths, use as few anchor points as possible. As you become 
more comfortable creating free-form paths, you should find yourself using 
fewer anchor points to create paths.
 
For an easy way to draw free-form shapes, use the Pencil tool. This tool simply 
traces the movement of your mouse (or pen tablet) as you move it, much like 
a pencil works on paper. Although not as exact as the Pen tool, the Pencil tool 
creates Bézier curves that you can later edit. Note that the Pencil tool is not 
meant for creating straight lines — unless you’re capable of drawing perfectly 
straight lines by hand, that is.
Straight and zigzag lines
Follow these steps to draw lines with straight segments, such as a zigzag:
 
1. Select the Pen tool.
 
2. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to start your line segment.
 
3. Click and release the mouse button.
 
 Make sure that you don’t drag before you release the mouse button.
 
 An anchor point appears; it looks like a small, filled-in square.
 
4. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to place the next anchor 
point.
 
5. Click and release the mouse button.
 
 InDesign draws a straight line between the two anchor points. The first 
anchor point changes to a hollow square, and the second anchor point 
is filled in, which indicates that it’s the active anchor point.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 for each additional anchor point.
 
 To reposition an anchor point after you click the mouse button but 
before you release it, hold down the spacebar and drag. Otherwise, you 
need to select it with the Direct Selection tool after you finish drawing 
the line and then click and drag it to its new location.

127
 Chapter 7: Adding Essential Elements
 
7. To complete the path, Ô+click or Ctrl+click elsewhere on the page or 
simply choose another tool.
 
 If you Ô+click or Ctrl+click, the Pen tool remains active, so you can 
continue creating new paths.
Curved lines
Knowing how to draw zigzag lines is fine (see preceding section), but chances 
are, you want to draw curved shapes as well. The basic process is similar to 
drawing straight segments, but drawing curved paths (technically called 
Bézier paths) is more complicated and will take you some time to get the 
hang of.
If you want to draw a continuously curvy path that contains no corner points 
and no straight segments, you should create only smooth points as you draw. 
Here’s how:
 
1. Select the Pen tool.
 
2. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to start the curve segment.
 
3. Click and hold down the mouse button.
 
 The arrowhead pointer appears.
 
4. Drag the mouse in the direction of the next point you intend to create 
and then release the mouse button.
 
 As you drag, the anchor point, its direction line, and the direction line’s 
two handles are displayed, as shown in Figure 7-6.
How smooth and corner points work
Bézier paths have two kinds of points to join 
segments: corner and smooth.
The two segments that form a smooth point’s 
direction line work together as a single, straight 
line. When you move a handle, the line acts like 
a teeter-totter; the opposite handle moves in 
the opposite direction. If you shorten one of the 
segments, the length of the other segment 
doesn’t change. The angle and length of 
direction lines determine the shape of the seg-
ments with which they’re associated.
A corner point that connects two curved seg-
ments has two direction lines; a corner point 
that connects two straight segments has no 
direction lines; and a corner point that connects 
a straight and curved segment has one direc-
tion line. If you drag a corner point’s direction 
line, the other direction line, if there is one, isn’t 
affected.

 If you hold down the Shift key as you drag, the angle of the direction line 
is limited to increments of 45 degrees.
 
5. Move the Pen pointer to where you want to place the next anchor 
point — and end the first segment — and then drag the mouse.
 
 If you drag in roughly the same direction as the direction line of the 
previous point, you create an S-shaped curve; if you drag in the opposite 
direction, you create a C-shaped curve.
 
6. When the curve between the two anchor points looks how you want it 
to look, release the mouse button.
 
 Alternatively, when you want to connect curved segments to corner 
points (shown in Figure 7-7), move the Pen pointer to where you want to 
place the next anchor point — and end the first segment — and then 
press and hold Option or Alt as you click and drag the mouse. As you 
drag, the anchor point’s handle moves, and the direction line changes 
from a straight line to two independent segments. The angle of the direc-
tion line segment that you create when you drag the handle determines 
the slope of the next segment.

7. Repeat Steps 5 and 6 for each additional desired curved segment.
 
8. To complete the path, Ô+click or Ctrl+click elsewhere on the page or 
simply choose another tool.
 
 If you Ô+click or Ctrl+click, the Pen tool remains active, so you can 
create new paths.
 
 You can also complete the path by clicking the first point you created, 
which creates a closed path.
 
If you create two open paths that you want to join together into one path, 
you can do so in InDesign CS4 by selecting the two paths and then choosing 
Object➪Paths➪Join. InDesign usually joins the two closest points with a 
straight line, but it sometimes joins the last point of the first path and the first 
point of the second path.
Do note that if you try to join a text path with a regular path, the text will be 
deleted if it’s the second path selected. If you join two text paths, the second 
path’s text will also be deleted. Finally, if you select three or more paths and 
choose Object➪Paths➪Join, nothing will happen.
Closed paths
A closed path is simply a path that ends where it began. When it comes to 
creating closed paths with the Pen tool, the process is exactly the same as 
for creating open paths (such as curved lines and zigzag lines), as explained 
in the “Curved lines” and “Straight and zigzag lines” sections, earlier in this 
chapter, with one difference at the end:
 
 To create a straight segment between the end point and the last anchor 
point you created, click and release the mouse button.
 
 To create a curved segment, click and drag the mouse in the direction of 
the last anchor point you created and then release the mouse button.
Just like an open path, a closed path can contain straight and/or curved 
segments and smooth and/or corner anchor points. All the techniques 
explained earlier in this chapter for drawing lines with curved and straight 
segments and smooth and corner points apply when you draw closed paths.
You can also, of course, edit and adjust your curves in InDesign, but doing so 
requires some more expertise with drawing tools such as those in Adobe 
Illustrator and is beyond the scope of this book. Check out Illustrator CS4 For 
Dummies by Ted Alspach or Adobe InDesign CS4 Bible by Galen Gruman 
(both by Wiley Publishing) for more details.

Part III: Object Essentials 
Applying Strokes
All objects have a stroke with a width of 0 built in, so you never really have to 
add strokes. But to use them, you need to modify them so that they have 
some thickness onto which you can apply attributes, such as colors and 
gradients.
Setting stroke appearance
The Stroke panel is where you give the stroke its width, as well as apply the 
type of stroke and other attributes:
 
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the object whose stroke 
you want to modify.
 
2. If the Stroke panel isn’t displayed, show it by choosing 
Window➪Stroke (Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10).
 
 Figure 7-8 shows the panel.
 
3. To change the width of the stroke, enter a new value in the 
Weight field.
 
 You can also change the Weight value by choosing a new value from the 
field’s pop-up menu or by clicking the up and down arrows. (Each click 
increases or decreases the stroke by 1 point.)
 
4. Set the Miter Limit.
 
 The default of 4 is fine for almost all frames. You rarely need to use this 
feature, so don’t worry about it.

 Chapter 7: Adding Essential Elements
 
5. Click any of the three Cap iconic buttons to specify how dashes will 
look if you create a dashed stroke (covered in Step 9).
 
 Experiment with them in your objects to see which looks best for your 
situation.
 
6. Click any of the three Join iconic buttons to specify how corners are 
handled.
 
 Again, experiment with these buttons to see what works best for you.
 
7. Choose an Align Stroke option.
 
 The default is the first button, Align Stroke to Center, which has the 
stroke straddle the frame. You can also choose Align Stroke to Inside, 
which places the entire thickness inside the frame boundary, or Align 
Stroke to Outside, which places the entire thickness outside the frame 
boundary.
 
8. You can also choose end points for your strokes by using the Start and 
End pop-up menus.
 
 End points appear only on lines and other open paths, not on rectangles, 
ellipses, and other closed-loop shapes.
 
 Figure 7-9 shows the options.
 
9. To create a dashed line instead of a solid line, choose an option from 
the Type pop-up menu.
 
 These options are also available from the Control panel.
 
 Choose from 18 types of predefined dashes and stripes. The Gap Color 
and Gap Tint fields at the bottom of the Stroke panel become active as 
well, to let you choose a specific color and tint for the gaps in dashes 
and stripes.

options in

panel. (The 
End opt-
ions are

132
Part III: Object Essentials 
After you have a visible stroke, you want to color it. Here’s how:
 
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the frame to which you 
want to add a stroke.
 
2. Click the Stroke iconic button in the Swatches panel or Tools panel.
 
3. Click a color, tint, or gradient from the Swatches panel; or click one 
of the three boxes at the bottom of the Tools panel, which let you use 
(from left to right) the last-selected color, last-selected gradient, 
or None.
 
 (The None option removes the stroke’s color, tint, or gradient.)
For information about adding colors to the Swatches panel and applying 
colors to objects, see Chapter 6.
Creating stroke styles
InDesign lets you create custom strokes, known as stroke styles, in any of 
three types: dashed, dotted, and striped. To create custom dashes or stripes, 
choose the Stroke Styles option in the Stroke panel’s flyout menu. In the 
resulting Stroke Styles dialog box, you can create new strokes, edit or delete 
existing ones, and import strokes from a stroke styles file, which you create 
by saving a document’s strokes as a separate file for import into other 
documents. Stroke style files have the filename extension .inst.
Note that you can’t edit or delete the seven default stripe patterns shown 
in the Stroke Styles dialog box, nor can you edit or delete the default dash 
patterns — they’re not even available in the dialog box. When you edit or 
create a stroke pattern, you get the New Stroke Style dialog box, shown in 
Figure 7-10. In the Name field, enter a name for your stroke. In the Type 
pop-up menu, you can choose to create (or convert a stripe you’re editing to) 
a dashed, dotted, or striped stroke.
Adding fills
The option to add a stroke to any shape becomes 
even more powerful when combined with the 
option to fill any shape with a color or tint. For 
example, adding a fill to a text frame is an effec-
tive way to draw attention to a sidebar.
Adding a fill to a shape is much like adding a 
stroke, and the options available for specifying 
color and tint are identical. The only difference 
is that you click the Fill iconic button in the Tools 
panel or Swatches panel rather than the Stroke 
iconic button.

133
 Chapter 7: Adding Essential Elements
For dashes, you can resize the dash component by dragging the down-
pointing triangle at the end of the dash in the ruler section. You can add dash 
segments by simply clicking the ruler and dragging a segment to the desired 
width. Or you can use the Start and Length fields to manually specify them. 
The Pattern Length field is where you indicate the length of the segment that 
will be repeated to create a dashed line.
In the Corners pop-up menu, you tell InDesign whether to adjust how the 
dashes and gaps are handled at corners; the default is Adjust Dashes and 
Gaps, a setting you should keep — it will make sure that your corners have 
dash segments that extend along both sides of the corner, which looks 
neater. (Your other options are Adjust Dashes, Adjust Gaps, and None.) You 
can also choose a cap style and the stroke weight. The preview section of the 
pane lets you see your dash as you create or edit it.
For dots, you get a similar dialog box as for dashes. The Start and Length 
fields disappear, replaced with the Center field that determines where any 
added dots are placed on the ruler. (The initial dot, shown as a half-circle, 
starts at 0 and can’t be moved or deleted.) The Caps field is also gone.
 
To delete a dash or dot segment, just drag it to the left, off the ruler.
For stripes, you also get a similar dialog box. The principle is the same as for 
dashes: You create segments (in this case vertical, not horizontal) for the 
stripes by dragging on the ruler. However, the stripes version of the dialog 
box expresses its values in percentages because the actual thickness of each 
stripe is determined by the stroke weight — the thicker the stroke, the 
thicker each stripe is in the overall stroke.
 
Figure 7-10: 
The dashes 
version of 
the New 
Stroke Style 
dialog box.
 

134
Part III: Object Essentials 
In all three versions of the New Stroke Style dialog box, you click Add to add 
the stroke to your document, and then you can create a new stroke. When 
you’re done creating strokes, click OK. (When editing a stroke, the Add 
button won’t be available.)
 
Be sure to use the Preview Weight slider shown in Figure 7-10. This slider is 
available in all three versions of the New Stroke Style dialog box. It lets you 
increase or decrease the preview size so that you can better see thin or small 
elements in your stroke.

 Keeping objects from printing
 Rotating, shearing, and flipping objects
 Changing object attributes
 Applying special effects
F
rames, shapes, lines, and paths are the building blocks of your layout. 
But as anyone who ever played with Legos or Tinkertoys knows, it’s how 
you manipulate the building blocks that results in a unique creation, whether 
it be a Lego house, a Tinkertoys crane, or an InDesign layout.
InDesign provides a lot of control over layout objects so that you can create 
really interesting, dynamic publications suited to any purpose. In this 
chapter, I explain the controls that apply to all objects.
This chapter focuses on various effects and actions that apply to any frame 
or path. Chapter 16 covers various actions specific to text frames and paths, 
while Chapter 18 covers actions specific to graphics frames. Chapter 7 
explains how to add frames, shapes, lines, and paths in the first place. 
Chapter 10 explains how to align objects and precisely position them.
Selecting Objects
Before you can manipulate an object, you have to select it so that InDesign 
knows what you want to work on. To select an object (rather than its 
contents), use the Selection tool. Selected items display their item boundary 
(a rectangle that encompasses the object), as well as eight small resizing 
handles (one at each of the four corners and one midway between each side 
of the item boundary). Figure 8-1 shows an example.

136
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
Figure 8-1: 
When you 
select 
a frame 
with the 
Selection 
tool, the 
bounding 
box appears 
with eight 
resizing 
handles 
(left). When 
you resize 
a control 
point, 
InDesign 
shows you 
the new 
values as 
you move 
the mouse 
(right).
 
To select an individual object, just click it with the Selection tool. To select 
multiple objects, you have several options:
 
 Click the first object and Shift+click each additional object.
 
 Click and drag the mouse to create a selection rectangle (called a mar-
quee) that encompasses at least part of each desired object. When you 
release the mouse, all objects that this marquee touches are selected.
 
 Choose Edit➪Select All (Ô+A or Ctrl+A) to select all objects on the cur-
rent spread.
 
If an object is on a master page and you’re working on a document page, you 
must Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click the object to select it. How do you know 
whether an object is on a master page? Easy: If you try to select it by clicking 
and it doesn’t become selected, it must be on a master page.
 
Choose View➪Show Frame Edges (Control+Ô+H or Ctrl+H) to see object edges 
if they aren’t already visible.
These options are pretty easy, but it can get tricky when you want to select 
objects that overlap or are obscured by other objects. (See Chapter 10 for 
more details on object stacking.) So how do you select them?

137
 Chapter 8: Manipulating Objects
One way is to use the Select Previous Object or Select Next Object iconic 
buttons in the Control panel. (If you Shift+click either button, InDesign jumps 
past four objects and selects the fifth one. If you Ô+click or Control+click 
either button, InDesign selects to the bottommost or topmost object, respec-
tively.) Note that the buttons don’t display when the default Essentials 
workspace is in use; they do appear in the Advanced workspace, and you can 
turn them on individually by modifying the Control panel’s appearance. 
(Choose Customize from its flyout menu and then go to the Object section to 
turn on the Select Container & Content option.)
 
If you use the Select Previous Object or Select Next Object iconic buttons and 
reach the top or bottom of the object stack, InDesign cycles back. For exam-
ple, if you reach the topmost object and click Select Previous Object, InDesign 
moves to the bottommost object.
Another way to select buried objects is by using the Select submenu option 
in the Object menu.
The first four options in the Select submenu let you select another object 
relative to the currently selected object:
 
 First Object Above (Option+Shift+Ô+] or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+]) selects the 
topmost object.
 
 Next Object Above (Option+Ô+] or Ctrl+Alt+]) selects the object 
immediately on top of the current object.
 
 Next Object Below (Option+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Alt+[) selects the object 
immediately under the current object.
 
 Last Object Below (Option+Shift+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[) selects the 
bottommost object.
If no objects are selected, InDesign bases its selection on the order in which 
the objects were created, the topmost object being the one that was most 
recently created.
 
You can also access these four selection options by Control+clicking or 
right-clicking an object and choosing the Select menu from the contextual 
menu that appears.
The Select submenu has four other options:
 
 If you select an object’s content (text or graphic), choose 
Object➪Select➪Container to choose the frame or path. Using this option 
is the same as selecting the object with the Selection tool.
 
 If an object has content (text or graphic) and you select it, choose 
Object➪Select➪Content to choose the content within the object. This 
option is basically the same as selecting the frame with the Direct 
Selection tool.

138
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
 If you select an object in a group of objects by using the Direct Selection 
tool, choose Object➪Select➪Previous Object in Group to navigate to the 
previous object in the group.
 
 Similarly, if you select an object in a group of objects by using the Direct 
Selection tool, choose Object➪Select➪Next Object in Group to navigate 
to the next object in the group.
 
The order in which the objects were created determines what is “previous” or 
“next” in a group.
The Control panel also provides iconic buttons to select the next or previous 
object, as well as to select the content or container (frame). These last two 
buttons appear only if you’ve selected a group. The buttons for selecting the 
next or previous object appear only if you’re using the Direct Selection tool, 
while the buttons for selecting the content or container appear whether 
you’re using the Selection or Direct Selection tool. (Yes, this interface 
approach is very confusing!) Figure 8-2 shows the buttons.
 
The Select Next Object and Select Previous Object functions now work for 
anchored objects in text. If you select an anchored object and use these 
functions, InDesign CS4 will move to the next (or previous) anchored object in 
the current story. (Chapter 10 covers anchored objects.)
To deselect objects, just click another object, an empty part of your page, or 
the pasteboard. To deselect individual objects after you’ve selected multiple 
objects, Shift+click those you want to deselect.

139
 Chapter 8: Manipulating Objects
 
The Direct Selection tool lets you select any of the individual anchor points 
(and direction handles of free-form shapes and curved lines) on an object. If 
you use the Direct Selection tool to click an object that has a bounding box, 
the shape within is selected, and the bounding box is deselected. You use 
this tool to work on the contents independently of its container frame. 
You can also move a graphic within its frame by clicking within the object 
(see Chapter 18).
Resizing and Scaling Objects
Two closely related features are resizing and scaling. What’s the difference? 
Resizing affects just the container — the frame or path — whereas scaling 
affects both the container and its contents.
Resizing objects
You resize objects in pretty much the same way you move them: by using the 
mouse for inexact sizes or the Control panel for precise sizes.
To resize an object with the mouse, click and drag one of the frame’s (or 
path’s) handles with the Selection tool. (Hold the Shift key as you drag to 
maintain the proportions of the frame.) Drag a corner handle to resize both 
the width and height or a side handle to resize just the height or width. This 
method leaves the contents’ size unchanged but changes the size of the 
frame or path.
 
InDesign CS4 now shows you the new dimensions as you scale an object via 
the mouse, with an information box that pops up near the control point you’re 
dragging, as Figure 8-1, earlier in this chapter, shows.
You can also enter new values in the W: and H: fields (for width and height) of 
the Control panel. This action also doesn’t change the contents’ size.
 
Remember those reference points for positioning an object from Chapter 1? 
They come into play for resizing objects as well. Basically, the object will grow 
or shrink starting from the selected reference point, called the control point. So 
if the upper-left reference point is selected and you enter greater W: and H: 
values, the object will add the extra width to the right and the extra height 
below. But if you choose the center reference point, it will grow on both sides 
as well as on the top and bottom, spreading the extra size evenly.

140
Part III: Object Essentials 
Another way to resize a frame — this method doesn’t apply to paths — is to 
choose Object➪Fitting➪Fit Frame to Content (Option+Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+C). 
For a graphic, this action makes the frame the same size as the graphic itself. 
For text, it increases or decreases the depth of the text frame to match the 
depth of the text; it doesn’t widen or narrow the frame.
 
Double-clicking one of a frame’s four handles — the squares at the midpoints 
of each side — resizes the frame to the content in that axis. For example, 
double-clicking the left or right handles fits the frame to the contents’ width, 
while double-clicking the top or bottom handle fits the frame to the contents’ 
height. Likewise, double-clicking a corner handle resizes the frame in both 
directions.
Scaling objects
InDesign offers several ways to scale an object, resizing both its contents and 
its frame (or path):
 
 Enter percentage values in the Scale X Percentage and Scale Y 
Percentage fields of the Control panel. If the icon to the right of these 
fields shows a solid chain, adjusting one field automatically adjusts the 
other by the same percentage, creating proportional resizing. If the icon 
shows a broken chain, the two dimensions are resized independently, 
distorting the contents. Click the iconic button to toggle between the 
unbroken chain and broken chain icons.
 
 You can also scale an object using the mouse. Select the object with the 
Selection tool, make sure that the desired control point is active to con-
trol where the scaling operation starts, and then select the Scale tool. 
Now drag the mouse away from the object to enlarge it or into the object 
to reduce it. Objects scaled this way are scaled unproportionally; to 
scale the object proportionally, hold the Shift key when moving the 
mouse. (You can also use the Free Transform tool in the same way.)
 
 For graphics frames, use the content-fitting options in the Object menu 
and Control panel, described in Chapter 18.
Moving Objects
The easiest way to move an object is by using the mouse. With the Selection 
tool, click an object and drag it to a new location. When you release the 
mouse, the object is deposited in the new location.

141
 Chapter 8: Manipulating Objects
If you want to more precisely move an object, you can enter specific X: and Y: 
coordinates in the Control panel, as explained in Chapter 10.
 
Be sure to select the correct reference point to be used as the control point 
when entering coordinates. The little squares at the top left of the Control 
panel and Transform panel represent the object’s reference points (corners, 
side midpoints, and center). Click a reference point to make it the control 
point (it turns black, the others turn white); all coordinates are now based on 
this point.
Deleting Objects
Alas, not all the objects you create survive all the way to the final version of 
your publication. Some wind up on the cutting room floor. You can always 
move an object to the pasteboard if you’re not sure whether you want to get 
rid of it altogether. (Objects on the pasteboard don’t print.) But when it’s 
time to ax an object, oblivion is just a keystroke or two away.
 
If you delete a text or graphics frame or path, the contents are removed as 
well as the frame.
Here’s how to delete objects: Using any selection tool, select the object or 
objects you want to delete and then press the Delete key or Backspace key. 
You can also delete a selected item by choosing Edit➪Clear.
 
Choosing Edit➪Cut (Ô+X or Ctrl+X) also removes a selected object. However, 
in this case, a copy of the object is saved to the Clipboard, and you can paste 
it elsewhere (by choosing Edit➪Paste [Ô+V or Ctrl+V]) until you cut or copy 
something else, or you shut down your computer.
Preventing Objects from Printing
InDesign lets you prevent a specific object from printing. To do so, select the 
object with the Selection or Direct Selection tool, open the Attributes panel 
(Window➪Attributes), and then select the Nonprinting check box. (The other 
settings in this panel duplicate stroke settings, covered in Chapter 7.)
You use this feature for comments and other elements that should not print 
but that the designer needs to have visible on-screen. Another approach to 
nonprinting objects is to place them all on a layer and make the entire layer 
nonprinting, as explained in Chapter 4.

142
Part III: Object Essentials 
Transforming Objects
InDesign offers several tools and methods for transforming objects. I discuss 
resizing, scaling, and moving earlier in this chapter, but you can also take 
advantage of several other useful transformation tools, including rotating, 
shearing (skewing), flipping, and reshaping.
Rotating is just spinning an object around. Shearing is a little more compli-
cated: Shearing skews an object (slanting it in one direction) while also 
rotating the other axis at the same time.
Regardless of whether you use the mouse or numeric controls to apply rota-
tion and/or shearing to graphics, you first need to follow these steps:
 
1. Select the Selection tool.
 
2. Click the object you want to modify.
 
3. If you want, change the object’s control point.
 
 By default, the control point is the upper-left corner of a frame or 
shape. You can change the control point by clicking one of the little 
black boxes — the reference points — in the upper-left corner of the 
Control panel.
 
4. Choose the appropriate tool — Rotate, Shear, or Free Transform — or 
use the flip options in the Control panel.
 
 Figure 8-3 shows the Tools panel and Control panel iconic buttons for 
these controls.
 
If you hold down the Option or Alt key before and while moving and object, 
InDesign copies the object and then moves that copy. If you start rotating or 
resizing, or otherwise transforming an object and then hold Option or Alt, 
InDesign applies the transformation to a copy. (If you hold Option or Alt first, 
InDesign opens a dialog box that lets you enter in the new values, such as 
for scaling or rotating, and choose Copy to apply the new attributes to a copy 
of the object.
Rotating objects
With the Rotate tool selected, click and drag a selected object to rotate it — 
the object rotates following your mouse movement. (Holding down the Shift 
key while dragging limits rotation increments to multiples of 45 degrees.)

143

InDesign CS4 now shows the current angle of rotation in a pop-up box near the 
mouse as you rotate an object, similar to how it shows the new dimensions as 
you resize (refer to Figure 8-1).
For more precise rotation, use the Control panel. You can change the angle of 
a selected object by entering a value in the Rotation Angle field. If you choose 
to enter a value in the Rotation Angle field, positive values rotate the selected 
item counterclockwise around the control point; negative values rotate it 
clockwise.
Or you can choose one of the predefined angles from the Rotation Angle 
field’s pop-up menu, or choose any of the three rotation options — 
Rotate 180°, Rotate 90° CW, and Rotate 90° CCW — in the Control panel’s 
flyout menu.
If you choose one of these flyout menu options, the current angle of the 
selected object is added to the applied angle. For example, if you choose 
Rotate 90° CCW (counterclockwise), an object that’s currently rotated 12 
degrees will end up with a rotation angle of 102 degrees.
No matter what method you choose to rotate an object, the center of rotation 
will be whatever control point is selected in the Control panel.
To “unrotate” an object, enter a Rotation Angle value of 0.

144
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
Sometimes, rotated objects — especially those containing text — can be hard 
to edit in the regular view of a page. InDesign CS4 thus lets you rotate a spread 
so that you can view it at 90-, 180-, and 270-degree views — in addition to the 
standard 0-degree view, of course. Note that the actual spread isn’t rotated, 
just its appearance in InDesign; it still prints correctly. Figure 8-4 shows an 
example; note the rotation icon that appears in the pages panel to the right of 
the rotated spread.
You can rotate a spread’s view in two ways:
 
 Choose View➪Rotate Spread and then choose the desired rotation 
amount from the submenu.
 
 Select the desired spread for which to rotate its view in the Pages panel 
and then choose Rotate Spread View and the desired rotation amount 
from the submenu.
To set the view back to normal, choose the Clear Rotation option in the 
submenu.
 
Figure 8-4: 
Rotating a 
spread’s 
view helps 
you work on

and other 
rotated 
objects.
 

145
 Chapter 8: Manipulating Objects
Shearing objects
With the Shear tool selected, click and drag a selected object to shear it. 
(Holding down the Shift key constrains the selected object’s rotation value 
to increments of 45 degrees.) If you drag the mouse in a straight line parallel 
with one set of edges (such as the top and bottom), you skew the graphic 
(just slant it in one direction). But if you move the mouse in any other 
direction, you slant the object’s edges closest to the direction that you move 
the mouse the furthest and rotate the rest of the graphic. Give it a few tries to 
see what happens.
As with other functions, you can also use the Control panel for more precise 
control. Just enter a Shear X Angle value in the Control panel or choose a 
predefined value from the field’s pop-up menu. Positive shear values slant an 
object to the right (that is, the top edge of the object is moved to the right), 
whereas negative values slant an object to the left (the bottom edge is moved 
to the right). You can enter shear values between 1 and 89 (although values 
above 70 cause considerable distortion).
Note that when you use the Shear tool, you change the selected object’s 
angle of rotation and skew angle simultaneously. If you use the mouse, you 
can in effect get different skew and rotation angles based on how you move 
the mouse, but if you use the Control panel, both the skew and rotation will 
have the same angles applied.
To “unshear” an object, enter a Shear X Angle value of 0.
Flipping objects
The Object menu has two flipping commands: Object➪Transform➪Flip 
Horizontal and Object➪Transform➪Flip Vertical. They’re also available in the 
Control panel as iconic buttons (refer to Figure 8-3).
These controls let you make a mirror image of a selected object and its con-
tents. If you choose Flip Horizontal, the graphic is flipped along a vertical axis 
(that is, the right edge and left edge exchange places); if you choose Flip 
Vertical, the object is flipped upside down. (You’re not making a flipped copy 
of the select object, but actually flipping the selected object.)
As with other tools, the invisible line over which an object is flipped is based 
on what reference point is currently active as the control point for that 
object.
 
The Control panel displays the current object’s flip status. (Look for the 
large P in the panel when an object is selected; it’s to the right of the two flip 
buttons.) The P changes appearance so that it’s flipped the same way as the 
selected object.

146
Part III: Object Essentials 
Repeating transformations
Whatever transformations you use, you can apply them repeatedly. InDesign 
remembers the effects that you apply to frames via the Control panel, 
Transform panel, and transform tools. Choose Object➪Transform 
Again➪Transform Again (Option+Ô+3 or Ctrl+Alt+3) to repeat the last trans-
formation on the selected object. (It can be a different object than you last 
applied a transformation to.)
Or choose Object➪Transform Again➪Transform Sequence Again 
(Option+Ô+4 or Ctrl+Alt+4) to apply all recent transformations to a selected 
object. That sequence of transactions stays in memory until you perform a 
new transformation, which then starts a new sequence, so you can apply the 
same transformation to multiple objects.
 
Two other transform-again options are available through the 
Object➪Transform Again menu option’s submenu: Transform Again 
Individually and Transform Sequence Again Individually. You use these 
options on groups; they work like the regular Transform Again and Transform 
Sequence Again options but apply any effects to each object individually 
within the group. For example, applying Transform Again to a group rotates 
the entire group as if it were one unit, but choosing Transform Again 
Individually rotates each object in the group separately, not the group as a 
unit. Try it and see exactly what it does!
Replacing Object Attributes
A really painstaking task in any layout is going through it to fix formatting to 
frames, lines, or other objects once the design standards have changed. 
Using the Free Transform tool
Advanced users will like the Free Transform 
tool. When you select this tool, InDesign lets 
you scale, rotate, and resize — but not 
shear — selected objects — as follows:
  If you click within the frame, you can move 
the object by dragging it.
  If you select a frame handle (whether 
corner or midpoint), you can resize the 
object by dragging.
  Finally, if you move the mouse close to a 
frame handle, you see a curved arrow, 
which indicates that you can rotate the 
object around that object’s center point.
Having a tool that does more than one 
thing can be confusing, but once you get 
the hang of it, it sure beats constantly changing 
tools!

 Chapter 8: Manipulating Objects
InDesign has a very handy way to apply object formatting consistently to 
objects — the object styles feature described in Chapter 9 — but even 
if you use these styles, you’ll still have local formatting applied to at least 
some objects.
That’s where the Object pane of the Find/Replace dialog box comes in, letting 
you replace attributes throughout your document, no matter what they’re 
applied to. Figure 8-5 shows that pane.
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Open the Find/Change dialog box by choosing Edit➪Find/Change 
(Ô+F or Ctrl+F) and then go to the Object pane.
 
2. Select the desired object attributes and click OK when you’re done.
 
 To do so, click the Specify Attributes to Find iconic button to the right of 
the Find Object Format list. In the dialog box that appears (see Figure 
8-5), select the attributes to search (choose one category at a time from 
the list at left and then set the desired parameters in the pane that 
appears) and click OK when you’re done.
 
 Highlight an attribute in the list and click the Clear Object Find Format 
Settings iconic button — the trashcan icon — if you want to remove an 
attribute from your search. (This dialog box is nearly identical to the 
New Object Style dialog box covered in Chapter 9.)
 
3. If you’re replacing attributes, click the Specify Attributes to Change 
iconic button to the right of the Change Object Format list.
 
 These controls work like the Find Object Format controls.
 
4. Limit or expand the search range by choosing an option from the 
Search pop-up menu: Selection, Document, and All Documents.
 
5. Choose the type of frames to search in the Type pop-up menu: All 
Frames, Text Frames, Graphic Frames, and Unassigned Frames.
 
6. Determine the scope of your search by selecting or deselecting any of 
the five buttons at the bottom of the pane.
 
 From left to right, the five buttons are Include Locked Layers, Include 
Locked Stories, Include Hidden Layers, Include Master Pages, and 
Include Footnotes. Note that the first two buttons apply only to 
finds; you can’t change the formatting of locked objects. (If an icon’s 
background darkens, it’s selected.)
 
7. Click Find, Change, Change All, or Change/Find as desired to perform 
your search and/or replace operation.
 
8. Click Done when done.

Making Fancy Corners
Anytime you’re working on an object that has any sharp corners, you have 
the option to add a little pizzazz to those corners via InDesign’s Corner 
Options feature (Object➪Corner Options). Five built-in corner options, 
shown in Figure 8-6, are available. Note that if the shape contains only 
smooth points, any corner option you apply won’t be noticeable.
To add a corner option:
 
1. Select either of the selection tools and click the object to which you 
want to add a corner effect.
 
2. Choose Object➪Corner Options to display the Corner Options 
dialog box.
 
 Select the Preview check box to view changes as you make them.
 
3. Choose an option from the Effect pop-up menu.

4. Enter a distance in the Size field.
 
 The Size value determines the length that the effect extends from the 
corner.
 
 You can also use the new nudge buttons to increase or decrease 
the sizes in increments. (The increments depend on the default 
measurement unit selected; see Chapter 2.)
 
5. Click OK to close the dialog box and apply your changes.
 
If you can’t see a corner effect after applying one, make sure that a color is 
applied to the stroke or try making the object’s stroke thicker. Increasing 
the Size value in the Corner Options dialog box can also make a corner effect 
more visible.
Using Transparency and Lighting Effects
InDesign was a pioneer in the use of transparency effects on objects. These 
effects let you overlay objects without completely obscuring them, allowing 
for very interesting visual effects, such as fades and shadows. It provides rich 
controls over transparency and lighting so that you can create effects such 
as embossing and beveled edges and control the intensity and direction of 
shadows and light.

150
Part III: Object Essentials 
Basic transparency
One of InDesign’s most sophisticated tools is its set of transparency options, 
which let you make objects partially transparent. You apply transparency 
with the Effects panel (Window➪Effects [Shift+Ô+F10 or Ctrl+Shift+F10]), 
by choosing Object➪Effects➪Transparency, or by clicking the Effects iconic 
button (the fx icon) in the Control panel and choosing Transparency from its 
pop-up menu.
The first option displays the Effects panel, which takes the least screen space 
and is best used for simple operations. The other options open the more 
complex and larger Effects dialog box. (Be sure that the Transparency pane 
is visible in the Effects dialog box; if not, click the Transparency option in the 
option list at left.)
Figure 8-7 shows the Effects panel as well as a text title that uses transpar-
ency as it overprints a background photo. The photo has an Opacity setting 
of 40 percent, making it partially transparent. The text has an Opacity setting 
of 65 percent but also has a blending mode applied, which changes how the 
transparency appears.
To set the transparency level, in the Opacity field of the Effects panel or 
Effects dialog box’s Transparency pane, enter a value or choose one from the 
pop-up menu. A value of 0 is completely invisible, whereas a value of 100 is 
completely solid.
 
You can’t apply transparency to text selections or to entire layers, but 
InDesign does let you apply different transparency settings to an object’s 
contents, fill, and stroke, as well as to the object itself. You do so by choosing 
the desired component in the list in the Effects panel or using the Settings For 
pop-up menu in the Effects dialog box. (If you see only Object listed in the 
Effects panel, click the right-facing triangle to its left to display the rest.)
If you want more than basic transparency, you have a lot of other options. 
Most are for experts, but a few are worth describing. One is the set of 16 
transparency types — called blending modes. (Photoshop and Illustrator 
users will recognize these expert options.) You access blending modes in the 
pop-up menu in the Effects panel or via the Mode pop-up menu on the Effects 
dialog box’s Transparency pane. The differences among them can be subtle 
or extreme, depending on a variety of issues. Experiment with them to see 
what effect works best in each case.
 
The Difference, Exclusion, Hue, Saturation, Color, and Luminosity modes don’t 
blend spot colors — only process colors.

and text 
(the original

You have two other options in the Effects panel and in the Transparency 
pane of the Effects dialog box:
 
 Isolate Blending restricts the blending modes to the objects in a group, 
instead of also applying them to objects beneath the group. This option 
can prevent unintended changes to those underlying objects.
 
 Knockout Group obscures any objects below the selected group. But 
those objects are still affected by any blend mode settings applied to the 
group, unless Isolate Blending is also checked.
Drop shadows and inner shadows
The Effects panel and dialog box, as well as the Object➪Effects menu com-
mand, give you access to a bunch of other lighting features, including drop 
shadows.

152
Part III: Object Essentials 
To get to these other lighting features, choose Effects➪Drop Shadow from 
the Effects panel’s flyout menu or choose Drop Shadow from the fx iconic 
button’s pop-up menu. In the Effects dialog box, select Drop Shadow from the 
option list at left. Or just press Option+Ô+M or Ctrl+Alt+M. No matter how 
you get there, you see the following options in the Drop Shadow pane of the 
Effects dialog box, shown in Figure 8-8.
 
 Choose what component of the object to apply the drop shadow to by 
using the Settings For pop-up menu. (You can apply multiple drop shad-
ows, one to each component of an object.)
 
 Enable the Drop Shadow check box option to turn on the drop shadow 
function for the selected component.
 
 Select a lighting type (technically, a blend mode) by choosing one of the 
16 options in the Mode pop-up menu. (These blending modes are the 
same ones used for transparencies.)
 
 Specify the opacity by entering a value in the Opacity field — 0% is 
invisible, whereas 100% is completely solid.
 
 Specify the shadow’s position relative to the object by using the X Offset 
and Y Offset fields. A positive X Offset moves the shadow to the right; a 
positive Y Offset moves the shadow down. Negative values go in the 
other direction.
 
 Specify the shadow’s size by entering a value in the Distance field — this 
option blurs a copy of the object used in the drop shadow to make it 
look like it was created by shining light on the object.
 
 Choose a lighting angle in the Angle field or use the mouse to move the 
direction within the circle to determine the direction of the shadow. You 
can also select the Use Global Light option, which then uses whatever 
settings you define in the Global Light dialog box — a handy way to have 
consistent settings for all objects. (Choose Object➪Effects➪Global Light, 
or choose Global Light from the Effects panel’s flyout menu, to open the 
Global Light dialog box.)

Shadow

153
 Chapter 8: Manipulating Objects
 
 Choose a color source — Swatches, RGB, CMYK, or Lab — from the 
Color pop-up menu in the Effect Color dialog box, which you get by 
clicking the color swatch to the right of the Mode pop-up menu, and 
then select a color from the sliders or swatches below that menu. You 
get sliders for RGB, CMYK, and Lab colors or a set of previously defined 
color swatches if you selected Swatches in the Color pop-up menu.
 
 Adjust the other settings, if desired, to control other, expert drop 
shadow characteristics: Size, Spread, Noise, Object Knocks Out Shadow, 
and Shadow Honors Other Effects.
 
 To see the effects of your various setting adjustments in the actual 
layout, check the Preview option. (Because the Effects dialog box is so 
big, you’ll likely need a large monitor to have room for both the dialog 
box and the object you’re applying the effects to.)
InDesign has a second shadow option: inner shadows. It works pretty much 
like drop shadows, with a nearly identical pane in the Effects dialog box. The 
visual difference is that an inner shadow is contained within the object, as if 
the frames were a wall blocking the shadow, whereas a drop shadow occurs 
outside the frame, as if the frame were casting a shadow outside.
Feathering and other lighting effects
A similar option to drop shadows is feathering, which essentially softens the 
edges of objects. Three types of feathering are available:
 
 Basic feathering: This option softens the edges on all sides of an object.
 
 Directional feathering: This option lets you control the direction of the 
feathering as well as separate feather widths for each side, creating a 
smeared-border effect.
 
 Gradient feathering: This option provides a gradient effect to the 
feathered area.
The other effects are outer glow, inner glow, bevel and emboss, and satin. 
Figure 8-9 shows examples of each.
You apply them the same ways as you do drop shadows, selecting the object 
component in the Settings For pop-up menu and modifying the various con-
trols such as opacity, light angle and distance, blending mode, and effect size, 
as appropriate for the specific effect. Once you get a hang for transparency 
and drop shadows, it’s easy to use the other effects.

Y
ou use objects throughout your layout: lines, text frames, graphics 
frames, shapes, and so on. A big part of working with them involves 
organizing them — deciding when to group them together, when to lock them 
in location, how to arrange objects with others, and so on. That’s where this 
chapter comes in.
I also discuss a powerful new feature called object styles that lets you save 
object attributes. Finally, I show you how to manage objects’ relations with 
their source files, so that you can make sure that you’re using the correct 
version of your graphics and text.
Combining Objects into a Group
Groups have many uses. For example, you can create a group to
 
 Combine several objects that make up an illustration so that you can 
move, modify, copy, or scale all objects in a single operation.
 
 Keep a graphics frame and its accompanying caption (text) frame 
together so that you can reposition both objects at once if you change 
your mind about their placement.
 
 Combine several vertical lines that are used to separate the columns 
of a table so that you can quickly change the stroke, color, length, and 
position of all lines.

156
Part III: Object Essentials 
InDesign lets you combine several objects into a group. A group of objects 
behaves like a single object, which means that you can cut, copy, move, or 
modify all the objects in a group in a single operation.
To create a group, select all the objects (which can include other groups) 
that you want to include in your group and then choose Object➪Group (Ô+G 
or Ctrl+G).
Keep in mind the following when creating groups:
 
 If you create a group from objects on different layers, all objects are 
moved to the top layer and stacked in succession beneath the topmost 
object.
 
 You can’t create a group if some of the selected objects are locked and 
some aren’t locked. All selected objects must be locked or unlocked 
before you can group them. (Locking and unlocking objects are covered 
in the following section.)
 
If you want to manipulate a group, choose the Selection tool and then click 
any object in the group. The group’s bounding box appears. Any transforma-
tion you perform is applied to all objects in the group.
If you want to manipulate a specific object in a group, use the Direct Selection 
tool to select that object. If you want to change something that requires 
the Selection tool to be active, switch to it by selecting the Selection tool 
or simply by double-clicking the object. (See Chapter 8 for more details on 
selecting objects.)
 
If you remove an object applied (via cut and paste or copy and paste) from 
a group that had transparency, that pasted object will not retain the group’s 
transparency settings.
After creating a group, you may eventually decide that you want to return 
the objects to their original, ungrouped state. To do so, simply click any 
object in the group with the Selection tool and then choose Object➪Ungroup 
(Shift+Ô+G or Ctrl+Shift+G). If you ungroup a group that contains a group, 
the contained group isn’t affected. To ungroup this group, you must select it 
and choose Ungroup again.

157
 Chapter 9: Organizing Objects
Locking Objects
If you’re certain that you want a particular object to remain exactly where it 
is, you can select Object➪Lock Position (Ô+L or Ctrl+L) to prevent the object 
from being moved. Generally, you want to lock repeating elements such as 
headers, footers, folios, and page numbers so that they’re not accidentally 
moved. (Such repeating elements are usually placed on a master page; you 
can lock objects on master pages, too.)
A locked object can’t be moved whether you click and drag it with the 
mouse or change the values in the X: and Y: fields in the Control panel or 
Transform panel. Not only can you not move a locked object, but you can’t 
delete it, either. However, you can change other attributes of a locked object, 
including its stroke and fill.
To unlock a selected object, choose Object➪Unlock Position (Option+Ô+L or 
Ctrl+Alt+L).
You can also lock entire layers, as described in Chapter 4.
Working with Object Styles
Object styles let you organize your settings so that you can apply them to 
other objects for consistent, easy formatting. 
I suspect that object styles are underappreciated and underused, rarely used 
in real-world documents. That’s a pity, because the use of styles for object 
formatting — not just text formatting — makes your work easier by automati-
cally and reliably applying time-consuming settings to multiple objects and 
ensuring that your object formatting is both consistent and easily managed.
Creating object styles
You create object styles by using the Object Styles panel (Window➪Object 
Styles [Ô+F7 or Ctrl+F7]) and selecting New Object Style from the flyout 
menu, shown in Figure 9-1. You can also click the New Object Style iconic 
button at the bottom of the panel.
 
The simplest way to create an object style is to select an already-formatted 
object with any selection tool and then choose New Object Style from the 
Object Styles panel’s flyout menu. InDesign records all the settings automati-
cally from the selected object so that they’re in place for the new object style.

158
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
 
Create New Style Group
Clear Overrides
Delete Selected Style
Create New Style
Clear Attributes Not Defined by Style
Whether you start with an existing object or create a new object style com-
pletely from scratch, you use the New Object Style menu option that opens 
the New Object Style dialog box shown in Figure 9-2.
At the left side of the dialog box is a list of types of attributes that are or can 
be set. The checked items are in use for this style — you can uncheck an 
item so that InDesign doesn’t apply its settings to objects using the style. For 
example, if Fill is unchecked, the object style won’t apply any Fill settings to 
objects using that style (and won’t change any fill settings that have been 
applied to that object locally).
To switch from one type of attribute to another, simply click the item 
name for the type of attribute that you want to adjust, such as Stroke or 
Transparency.
 
Be sure to select the Preview option to see the results of object styles on the 
currently selected object. Of course, you need to make sure that the object is 
visible on-screen to see those effects.

The Object 
Styles panel 
and its fly-
out menu.

 Chapter 9: Organizing Objects
 
Figure 9-2: 
The New 
Object 
Style dialog 
box and its 
General 
pane.
 
When you open the New Object Style dialog box, you see the General pane, 
which lets you create a new style based on an existing object style (by using 
the Based On pop-up menu), and which lets you assign a keyboard shortcut 
for fast application of this style (by using the Shortcuts field).
You can use the Based On feature to create families of object styles. For 
example, you can create a style called Photo-Standard for the bulk of your 
placed photographs and then create variations, such as Photo-Sidebar and 
Photo-Author. The Photo-Standard style might specify a hairline black stroke 
around the photo, while Photo-Sidebar may change that to a white stroke. 
But if you later decide you want the stroke to be 1 point and change it in 
Photo-Standard, Photo-Sidebar automatically gets the 1-point stroke while 
retaining the white color.
The General pane also lets you see the current style settings. Click any of the 
arrows in the Style Settings section to get more details on how they’re set for 
this object style.
The other panes in the New Object Styles dialog box provide the same capa-
bilities that you find elsewhere in InDesign, brought into one convenient 
place so that you can use them in styles. Because it has so many panes, the 
New Object Style dialog box now breaks them into two sections. The first 
section — Basic Attributes — contains the following panes:
 
 The Fill pane lets you set colors for fills using whatever colors are 
defined in the Swatches panel. You can also set the tint and, if you select 
a gradient fill, the angle for that gradient. Finally, you can choose to have 
the fill overprint the contents of the frame by selecting the Overprint Fill 
option.

160
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
 The Stroke pane is identical to the Fill pane except that options specific 
to fills are grayed out, and options available to strokes are made avail-
able. The color, tint, and gradient angle options are the same as for the 
Fill pane. You can also choose the type of stroke (solid line, dashed line, 
or dotted line) by using the Type pop-up menu and adjust the thickness 
by filling in the Weight field. You can choose to overprint the stroke 
over underlying content, plus determine — if your stroke is a dotted or 
dashed line — the color, tint, and overprint for the gap.
 
 The Stroke & Corner Options pane lets you set stroke position and how 
corners and line ends are handled. It also lets you apply fancy corners 
to frames. The Stroke Options section is where you align the strokes to 
the frame edges, determine how lines join at corners, and decide what 
line endings are applied. The Corner Options section is where you select 
from five fancy corners, such as Bevel and Rounded, by using the Effect 
pop-up menu, and where you specify the radius, or reach, of the corner 
by using the Size field. (See Chapter 7 for the low-down on strokes and 
Chapter 8 for the skinny on corner options.)
 
 The Paragraph Styles pane controls what paragraph style, if any, is 
applied to text in the frame. Chances are you won’t use this setting 
except for frames that contain only consistent, very simple text, such as 
pull-quotes or bios. (See Chapter 11 for details.)
 
 The Text Frame General Options pane controls how text is handled 
within a frame. This pane essentially replicates the controls in the 
General pane of the Text Box Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame 
Options [Ô+B or Ctrl+B]), including number of columns, column width, 
gutter settings, inset spacing (how far from the frame edge text is 
placed), vertical justification (how text is aligned vertically in the frame), 
and whether text wrap settings are ignored when this frame overlaps 
other frames. (See Chapter 11 for details.)
 
 The Text Frame Baseline Options pane controls how text is handled 
within a frame. This pane essentially replicates the controls in the 
Baseline Options pane of the Text Box Options dialog box (Object➪Text 
Frame Options or Ô+B or Ctrl+B), including how the text baseline is cal-
culated for the frame and whether the text frame gets its own baseline 
grid. (See Chapter 10 for details.)
 
 The Story Options pane enables optical margin alignment — its controls 
are the same as in the Story panel (Type➪Story), detailed in Chapter 
16. Optical margin alignment adjusts the placement of text along the left 
side of a frame so that the text alignment is more visually pleasing.
 
 The Text Wrap & Other pane lets you set text wrap, mirroring the 
features of the Text Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap [Option+Ô+W or 
Ctrl+Alt+W]), explained in Chapter 16, as well as make an object non-
printing (normally handled through the Attributes panel by choosing 
Window➪Attributes).

161
 Chapter 9: Organizing Objects
 
 The Anchored Object Options pane lets you set the attributes for inline 
and anchored frames, mirroring the controls in the Anchored Object 
Options dialog box (Object➪Anchored Object➪Options), which I explain 
in Chapter 10.
 
 The Frame Fitting Options pane lets you set the defaults for how frames 
fit to the graphics and text placed in them, mirroring the controls in 
the Frame Fitting Options dialog box (Object➪Fitting➪Frame Fitting 
Options), as explained in Chapter 18.
The second set of panes all relate to the features found in the Effects dialog 
box and panel, as covered in Chapter 8.
Managing object styles
The Object Styles panel’s flyout menu (refer to Figure 9-1) has several 
options for managing object styles:
 
 Duplicate Object Style: Click an object style’s name and then choose 
this menu option to create an exact copy. If you want to create an object 
style that’s similar to one you already created, you may want to choose 
New Object Style rather than Duplicate Object Style and then use the 
Based On option to create a child of the original. If you choose Duplicate 
Object Style, the copy is identical to, but not based on, the original; if 
you modify the original, the copy isn’t affected.
 
 Delete Style: Choose this option to delete selected object styles. To 
select multiple styles, press and hold Ô or Ctrl as you click their names. 
To select a range of styles, click the first one and then press and hold 
Shift and click the last one. You can also delete styles by selecting them 
in the pane and then clicking the Delete Selected Styles iconic button 
(the trashcan icon) at the bottom of the panel.
 
 Redefine Style: To modify an existing object style, first make changes to 
an object that already has an object style defined for it and then select 
Redefine Style. The newly applied formats are applied to the object style.
 
 Style Options: This option lets you modify an existing object style. When 
a style is highlighted in the Object Styles panel, choosing Style Options 
displays the Object Style Options dialog box, which is identical to the 
New Object Style dialog box.
 
 Load Object Styles: Choose this option if you want to import object 
styles from another InDesign document. After selecting the document 
from which to import the styles, you get a dialog box listing the styles in 
the chosen document so that you can decide which ones to import. Note 
the Incoming Style Definitions window at the bottom of the dialog box; it 
lists the style definitions to help you decide which to import, as well as 
which to overwrite or rename.

162
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
InDesign comes with three predefined object styles — [Basic Text Frame], 
[Basic Graphics Frame], and [Basic Grid] — that you can modify as desired.
Applying object styles
After you create an object style, it’s a simple process to apply it: Just click 
an object and then click the object style name in the Object Styles panel or 
press its keyboard shortcut. (Windows users must make sure that Num Lock 
is on when using shortcuts for styles.)
 
You can set which object styles are automatically used for new text and 
graphics frames: In the Object Styles panel’s flyout menu, choose Default Text 
Frame Style and select the desired style from the submenu to set a default text 
frame; choose Default Graphic Frame Style and select the desired style from 
the submenu to set a default graphics frame. To no longer have object styles 
automatically applied to new objects, choose [None] in the Default Text Frame 
and/or Default Graphic Frame submenus.
When you apply an object style to selected objects, all local formats are 
retained. All other formats are replaced by those of the applied style — that 
is, unless you do one of the following:
 
 If you press and hold Option or Alt when clicking a name in the Object 
Styles panel, any local formatting that has been applied to the objects is 
removed. You can achieve the same effect by choosing Clear Attributes 
Not Defined by Style from the Object Styles panel’s flyout menu or by 
clicking the Clear Attributes Not Defined by Style iconic button at the 
bottom of the Object Styles panel.
 
 If you want to override any local changes with the settings in the object 
style, choose Clear Overrides in the flyout menu or click the Clear 
Overrides iconic button at the bottom of the Object Styles panel. The 
difference is that Clear Attributes Not Defined by Style removes all attri-
butes for which the object style contains no settings, whereas Clear 
Overrides imposes the object style’s settings over conflicting attributes 
that you set manually.
 
 To have InDesign automatically override local changes when applying a 
style, be sure the Clear Overrides When Applying Style flyout menu option 
is checked. Choosing the item toggles between selecting (checking) and 
deselecting (unchecking) this option.

163
 Chapter 9: Organizing Objects
 
If a plus sign (+) appears to the right of an object style’s name, it means that 
the object has local formats that differ from those of the applied object style. 
This formatting difference can occur if you apply an object style to object 
text to which you’ve done some manual formatting, or if you modify format-
ting for an object after applying an object style to it. (For example, you may 
have changed the fill color, which is a local change to the object style and 
causes the + to appear.)
To remove a style from an object, choose Break Link to Style from the Object 
Styles panel’s flyout menu. The object’s current formatting won’t be affected, 
but it will no longer be updated when the object style is changed.
Managing object styles
InDesign also lets you manage your styles, such as creating groups of styles 
to make it easier to find relevant ones, and bring in styles from other docu-
ments. Because these features work the same for paragraph, character, table, 
and cell styles as well, I cover these features in one place: Chapter 13.
Managing Links
The Links panel (Window➪Links [Shift+Ô+D or Ctrl+Shift+D]) is a handy 
place to manage the links to your graphics and text, particularly when you 
need to update them.
 
Figure 9-3 shows the Links panel. If you’ve used previous versions of InDesign, 
note how different the Links panel is in InDesign CS4 — Adobe’s given it a 
major overhaul.
 
InDesign always creates links for graphics files. But it creates links to source 
text files (including spreadsheets) only when the Create Links When Placing 
Text and Spreadsheet Files option is checked in the File Handling pane of the 
Preferences dialog box (InDesign➪Preferences➪File Handling [Ô+K] on the Mac, 
or Edit➪Preferences➪File Handling [Ctrl+K] in Windows). This option is not 
checked by default because many designers don’t want text files easily updated 
in their layouts. That’s because all the formatting they’ve done to the file in 
InDesign is removed when the link to the source file is updated, causing the 
text to be replaced. (Note that this option has moved from the Type pane of the 
Preference dialog box, where it resided in previous versions of InDesign.)

Part III: Object Essentials 
The first four sets of commands in the Links panel’s flyout menu let you rees-
tablish links to missing and modified files, display an imported graphic or 
text file in the document window, open the program used to create a graphic 
or text file, and work on copies and versions of the source graphics and text:

 Relink: This command, and the Relink iconic button (at the bottom of 
the panel), lets you reestablish a missing link or replace the original file 
you imported with a different file. When you choose Relink or click the 
button, the Relink dialog box is displayed and shows the original path-
name and filename. You can enter a new pathname and filename in the 
Location field, but clicking Browse is easier, which opens a standard 
Open a File dialog box. Use the controls to locate and select the original 
file or a different file and then click OK. (You can also drag and drop 
a file icon from the Mac OS Finder or Windows Explorer directly into 
the Relink dialog box.) If you want to restore broken links to multiple 
files simultaneously, highlight their filenames in the scroll list and then 
choose Relink or click the Update Link button.

165
 Chapter 9: Organizing Objects
 
 Previous versions of InDesign let you relink all instances of a file in your 
layout, so you only have to do the operation once. InDesign CS4 changes 
how relinking works: Be sure to hold Option or Alt when clicking the 
Relink command or Relink iconic button. Also, InDesign is now smarter 
about finding missing files when you open a file; if the Find Missing Links 
Before Opening Document option is enabled in the File Handling pane 
of the Preferences dialog box, InDesign CS4 searches your drives for the 
files and automatically updates them if it finds them.
 
 Relink to Folder: This new command lets you relink multiple files at the 
same time, and even change the type of graphic files to use at the same 
time. First, be sure to select all files in the panel you want to relink — 
only selected files will be updated. Then choose this option and navigate 
to the folder that has the files. If the filenames in the new folder match 
the filenames of the selected files in the panel, InDesign updates them. 
(It leaves alone any it can’t find.)
 
 Notice that the Open a File dialog box that appears when you choose 
this command contains an option called Match This Filename But This 
Extension. Say that someone gave you JPEG files as placeholders for 
your layout and then delivered the final TIFF files for high-quality print 
output. In previous versions, you’d have to relink every single file manu-
ally. Now, you can use this option and enter TIFF (or TIF, depending on 
the filename extension used) to substitute the high-quality TIFF files for 
the original low-quality JPEG files. That’s a real timesaver! (Note that the 
new file can be any format supported by InDesign, not just TIFF.)
 
 Update Link: Choose this option or click the Update Link iconic button 
(at the bottom of the panel) to update the link to a modified graphic or 
text file. Highlight multiple filenames and then choose Update Link or 
click the Update Link button to update all those links at once.
 
 Update All Links: Choose this option to update all files marked as 
modified, without having to select individual files.
 
 Go to Link: Choose this option or click the Go to Link iconic button 
(second from left) in the panel to display the highlighted file in the docu-
ment window. InDesign will, if necessary, navigate to the correct page 
and center the frame in the document window. 
 
 Embed Link (for graphics only): This option lets you embed the com-
plete file of any imported graphics file. (InDesign normally imports only 
a low-resolution screen preview when you place a graphic that is 48K or 
larger.) If you want to ensure that the graphics file will forever remain 
with a document, you can choose to embed it — however, by embed-
ding graphics, you’ll be producing larger document files, which means it 
will take you longer to open and save them. If you do use this option, an 
alert appears to inform you about the increased document size that will 
result. Click Yes to embed the file. Note that this menu option changes 
to Unembed File, so you can re-enable the original link at any time.

166
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
 Unlink (for text files only): This option removes the link to the source 
text file, so it can’t be updated. Note that you can’t undo this option 
from the Links panel; you have to choose Edit➪Undo (Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z). 
And this option is available only if you enabled text linking via the 
Create Links When Placing Text and Spreadsheet Files option in the File 
Handling pane of the Preferences dialog box.
 
 Edit Original: If you want to modify an imported graphic or text file, 
choose Edit Original from the flyout menu or click the Edit Original 
button (far right) at the bottom of the panel. InDesign tries to locate and 
open the program used to create the file, which may or may not be pos-
sible, depending on the original program, the file format, and the pro-
grams available on your computer.
 
 Edit With: This new menu option lets you choose what program to edit 
a select object with.
 
 Reveal in Finder (Macintosh) and Reveal in Explorer (Windows): This 
menu option opens a window displaying the contents of the folder that 
contains the source file, so you can perhaps move, copy, or rename it. 
(The Reveal in Bridge option is a similar feature for the expert Adobe 
Bridge companion program not covered in this book.)
 
When you relink missing and update modified graphics, any transforma-
tions — rotation, shear, scale, and so on — that you’ve applied to the 
graphics or their frames are maintained, unless you’ve deselected the new 
Preserve Image Dimensions When Relinking option in the File Handling pane 
of the Preferences dialog box (InDesign➪Preferences➪File Handling [Ô+K] 
on the Mac, or Edit➪Preferences➪File Handling [Ctrl+K] in Windows).
The Utilities menu option in the flyout menu provides access to several 
expert features not covered in this book.
 
You can control what appears in the Links panel using the Panel Options 
option in the flyout menu. You can specify what information appears with 
each filename, including whether icons of the file contents display.
 
Finally, you can see extensive information about the file in the Link Info sec-
tion of the Links panel, containing all the attributes that are also available 
in Adobe’s Bridge, such as file dimensions and color profile. To toggle this 
information off, just click the Show/Hide Item Information iconic button at the 
bottom left of the Links panel.

 Working with document grids and guidelines
 Making objects line up
 Anchoring objects to text
W
hen you draw objects like frames or lines, they appear where you 
draw them. That’s what you expect, right? But sometimes you want 
them to appear where you meant to draw them, not where you actually did. 
Working with the mouse is inexact, but you can overcome that obstacle.
This chapter shows you how to use a variety of InDesign features to precisely 
control the placement of objects, including the ability to enter actual coor-
dinates for objects, to use grids and guidelines features to ensure that your 
objects and text line up where you want them to, and to use the Align panel 
and related commands to make sure that objects line up relative to each 
other, so that your layouts are all neat and tidy.
The other part of keeping your layouts neat and tidy is managing the arrange-
ments of objects. In addition to the grouping and locking functions covered 
in Chapter 9, InDesign also lets you control the stacking order of objects that 
overlap and tie objects to spots in text so they stay close to the text that ref-
erences them.
Positioning Precisely with Coordinates
The most precise way to position objects is by entering the object’s desired 
coordinates in the X: and Y: fields of the Control panel or the Transform 
panel. (You can also precisely change the object’s size by entering values 
in the W: and H: fields.) The Control panel is visible by default at the top of 
the document window. If it’s not visible, open the Control panel by choosing 
Window➪Control (Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6).

168
Part III: Object Essentials 
The Control panel is more powerful than the Transform panel, which is 
a holdover from older versions of InDesign, but if you want to use the 
Transform panel, choose Window➪Object & Layout➪Transform. Figure 10-1 
shows both the Control panel and Transform panel and a selected frame.
Everyone should use the Control panel’s coordinates to make sure that 
objects are consistently placed from page to page. Many designers place 
objects by eye, using the mouse, but that approach typically means that 
small position and size variations that shouldn’t be there occur from page to 
page. Many readers won’t notice if the differences are slight, but even small 
differences make small adjustments to text flow that can add up over pages. 
And it’s all so unnecessary.
You usually want to enter coordinates based on the upper-left corner, so be 
sure that the upper-left reference point is made into the control point (just 
click it if it’s not). How do you know which reference point is the current 
control point? The control point is black, while the other reference points are 
white. (Chapter 1 provides the deeper details.)

Lining Up Objects with 
Guidelines and Grids
If you’ve ever seen a carpenter use a chalked string to snap a temporary line 
as an aid for aligning objects, you understand the concept behind ruler guide-
lines and grids. They’re not structurally necessary, and they don’t appear in 
the final product, yet they still make your work easier.

169
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
InDesign provides several types of grids and guidelines:
 
 Ruler guides are moveable guidelines that are helpful for placing objects 
precisely and for aligning multiple items.
 
 Margin and column guides are part of your page setup when you create 
or modify a document (see Chapter 3), providing the default margin 
around the sides of the page and the space between the default text 
frame’s columns.
 
 Smart guides are created on the fly as you work with objects. They use 
the centerpoints and frame edges of nearby objects and display accord-
ingly so that you can line up your current object to match a nearby 
object’s position or size.
 
 A document grid is a set of horizontal and vertical lines that help you 
place and align objects.
 
 A baseline grid is a series of horizontal lines that help in aligning lines of 
text and objects across a multicolumn page. When a document is open 
and it has a baseline grid showing, the page looks like a sheet of lined 
paper.
 
 A frame-based grid is similar to a baseline grid except that it’s just for a 
specific text frame.
You won’t need to display all the grids and guidelines at once. You’ll most 
likely use a combination of guides and grids, but using all four at once is 
more complicated than necessary.
Using ruler guides
InDesign lets you create individual ruler guides manually. You can also set 
ruler guides automatically with the Create Guides command (Layout➪Create 
Guides).
Manually creating ruler guides
To create ruler guides on an as-needed basis, follow these steps:
 
1. Go to the page or spread onto which you want to place ruler guides.
 
2. If the rulers don’t appear at the top and left of the document window, 
choose View➪Show Rulers (Ô+R or Ctrl+R).
 
3. Drag the pointer (and a guideline along with it) from the horizontal 
ruler or vertical ruler onto a page or the pasteboard.

170
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
4. When the guideline is positioned where you want it, release the 
mouse button.
 
 If you release the mouse when the pointer is over a page, the ruler 
guide extends from one edge of the page to the other (but not across a 
spread). If you release the mouse button when the pointer is over the 
pasteboard, the ruler guide extends across both pages of a spread and 
the pasteboard. If you want a guide to extend across a spread and the 
pasteboard, you can also hold down the Ô or Ctrl key as you drag and 
release the mouse when the pointer is over a page.
 
Place both a horizontal and vertical guide at the same time by pressing Ô or 
Ctrl and dragging the ruler intersection point (where the two rulers meet) onto 
a page. You can also place a guide that extends across the page or spread and 
pasteboard by double-clicking the vertical or horizontal ruler.
Ruler guides are cyan in color (unless you change the color by choosing 
Layout➪Ruler Guides) and are associated with the layer onto which they’re 
placed. You can show and hide ruler guides by showing and hiding the layers 
that contain them. You can even create layers that contain nothing but ruler 
guides and then show and hide them as you wish. (See Chapter 4 for more 
information about layers.)
 
To create ruler guides for several document pages, create a master page, add 
the ruler guides to the master page, and then apply the master to the appro-
priate document pages. (Chapter 4 covers master pages.)
Automatically creating ruler guides
Here’s how to create a set of ruler guides automatically:
 
1. If the documents contain multiple layers, display the Layers panel 
(Window➪Layers [F7]) and click the name of the layer to which you 
want to add guides.
 
2. Choose Layout➪Create Guides to display the Create Guides dialog 
box, shown in Figure 10-2. 
 
 To see the guides on the page while you create them, check Preview.
 
3. In the Rows and Columns areas, specify the number of guides you 
want to add in the Number fields and, optionally, specify a Gutter 
width between horizontal (Rows) and vertical (Columns) guides. 
 
 Enter 0 (zero) in the Gutter fields if you don’t want gutters between 
guides.
 
4. In the Options area, click Margins to fit the guides in the margin 
boundaries; click Page to fit the guides within the page boundary.
 
5. Remove any previously placed ruler guides by checking Remove 
Existing Ruler Guides.

6. When you finish specifying the attributes of the ruler guides, click OK 
to close the dialog box.
Working with ruler guides
You can show and hide, lock and unlock, select and move, copy and paste, 
and delete ruler guides. Here are a few pointers for working with ruler guides:
 
 Display or hide ruler guides by choosing View➪Grids & Guides➪Show/
Hide Guides (Ô+; or Ctrl+; — note that these are semicolons).
 
 Lock or unlock all ruler guides by choosing View➪Grids & 
Guides➪Lock Guides (Option+Ô+; or Ctrl+Alt+;). Ruler guides are locked 
when Lock Guides is checked.
 
 Select a ruler guide by clicking it with a selection tool. To select mul-
tiple guides, hold down the Shift key and click them. The color of a guide 
changes from cyan to the color of its layer when it’s selected. To select 
all ruler guides on a page or spread, press Option+Ô+G or Ctrl+Alt+G.
 
 Move a guide by clicking and dragging it as you would any object. To 
move multiple guides, select them and then drag them. To move guides to 
another page, select them, choose Edit➪Cut (Ô+X or Ctrl+X) — or choose 
Edit➪Copy (Ô+C or Ctrl+C) to copy — then display the target page and 
choose Edit➪Paste (Ô+V or Ctrl+V). If the target page has the same dimen-
sions as the source page, the guides are placed in their original positions.

172
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
 Delete ruler guides by selecting them and then pressing Delete or 
Backspace.
 
 Change the color of the ruler guides and the view percentage above 
which they’re displayed by choosing Layout➪Ruler Guides. The Ruler 
Guides dialog box appears. Modify the View Threshold value, choose 
a different color from the Color pop-up menu, and then click OK. If you 
change the settings in the Ruler Guides dialog box when no documents 
are open, the new settings become defaults and are applied to all subse-
quently created documents.
 
 Display ruler guides behind — instead of in front of — objects by 
choosing InDesign➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard (Ô+K) on the 
Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard (Ctrl+K) in Windows. 
Then select the Guides in Back option in the Guide Options section of 
the dialog box.
 
 Make object edges snap (align) to ruler guides when you drag them 
into the snap zone by selecting the Snap to Guides option (View➪Grids 
& Guides➪Snap to Guides [Shift+Ô+; or Ctrl+Shift+;]). To specify the 
snap zone (the distance — in pixels — at which an object will snap to a 
guide), choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard (Ô+K) on 
the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Guides & Pasteboard (Ctrl+K) in Windows 
and enter a value in the Snap to Zone field in the Guide Options section 
of the dialog box.
Working with column guides
You can also adjust column guides if your document has them, though you 
don’t get the same flexibility in adjusting column guides as you do ruler 
guides. Column guides are created when you create a new document and set 
it up as having multiple columns (see Chapter 3).
By default, column guides are locked. To unlock them (or relock them) 
choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Lock Column Guides. (If the menu option has 
a check mark to its left, the column guides are locked.)
To move a column guide, click and drag it. Note that the color of a selected 
column guide doesn’t change as the color of a selected ruler guide does. Also 
note that you can’t select multiple column guides or move them to other 
pages. The only way to add or delete column guides is to change the number 
of guides in the Margins and Columns dialog box (choose Layout➪Margins 
and Columns); adjusting the number of columns undoes any custom moves 
applied to column guides.

173
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
Working with smart guides
Using the new smart guides feature is easy. First, make sure that smart guides 
are enabled. You do so in the Guides & Pasteboard pane of the Preferences 
dialog box by enabling the Align to Object Center and/or the Align to Object 
Edges options. Aligning to object center tells InDesign to look for the center-
point of other objects as you move or resize objects and use those as align-
ment targets. Aligning to object frame edges has it look for other objects’ 
edges and use those as alignment targets. Turning on both produces more 
smart guides as you work on objects.
Figure 10-3 shows the smart guide feature in action in three sequences (in 
each sequence, at left is an existing object):
 
 The top sequence shows me adding a second frame. The mouse pointer 
is near neither the nearby object’s centerpoint nor its edge, so no smart 
guide appears.
 
 The middle sequence shows what happens as the mouse pointer moves 
near the edge of the nearby object: InDesign displays a smart guide to 
let me know that if I want the bottom edge of the new frame to align with 
the bottom of the nearby object, all I have to do is let go.
 
 The third sequence shows me moving a circular frame from the bottom 
to the upper right of the page. You can see the smart guide that indi-
cates the mouse is aligned to the centerpoint of the second object, and 
if I let go here, the circular frame’s centerpoint will align to that other 
object’s centerpoint.
You probably noticed additional visual indicators in the third sequence: 
the spacing indicators between each set of objects. This visual indication is 
called smart spacing, which you also enable in the Guides & Pasteboard pane 
of the Preferences dialog box. When smart spacing is on, InDesign looks at 
the relative spacing of nearby objects as you work with one and highlights 
when the spacing is the same, or close to being the same (in which case it 
moves them for you).
A fourth “smart” feature comes with smart guides (it, too, must be enabled 
in the Guides & Pasteboard pane): smart measurements. In this case, as you 
resize or rotate objects, InDesign shows a smart guide when the object being 
transformed matches the specs — such as dimensions or rotation angle — of 
other nearby angles, under the assumption that maybe you want them to be 
the same. As with the other smart-guides functions, let go of the mouse when 
the guides appear so that you can get those matching settings.

Using document grids
A document grid is like the grid paper you used in school, a visual crutch to 
help ensure that the objects you draw and reposition are placed at desired 
increments. Using a grid can help ensure that objects align and are sized 
consistently.
If you plan to use a grid, set it up before you start working in the docu-
ment. Because documents tend to have different grid settings based on 
individual contents, you probably want to set Grids preferences with 
a specific document open so that the grid will apply only to that docu-
ment. Figure 10-4 shows the Grids pane of the Preferences dialog box 
(InDesign➪Preferences➪Grids [Ô+K] on the Mac, or Edit➪Preferences➪Grids 
[Ctrl+K] in Windows).
You have the following options:
 
 Color: The default color of the document grid is Light Gray. You can 
choose a different color from the Color pop-up menu or choose Other to 
create your own.

175
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
 
 Gridline Every: The major gridlines, which are slightly darker, are posi-
tioned according to this value. The default value is 6p0; in general, you 
want to specify a value within the measurement system you’re using. For 
example, if you work in inches, you might enter 1 inch in the Gridline 
Every field. You set the horizontal and vertical settings separately.
 
 Subdivisions: The major gridlines established in the Gridline Every field 
are subdivided according to the value you enter here. For example, if 
you enter 1 inch in the Gridline Every field and 4 in the Subdivisions 
field, you get a gridline at each quarter-inch. The default number of sub-
divisions is 8. You set the horizontal and vertical settings separately.
 
Figure 10-4: 
The Grids 
pane of the 
Preferences 
dialog box.
 
By default, the document grid appears on every spread behind all objects. You 
can have grids display in front by deselecting the Grids in Back check box.
To make object edges snap (align) to the grid when you drag them into 
the snap zone, select the Snap to Document Grid option (View➪Grids & 
Guides➪Snap to Document Grid [Shift+Ô+’ or Ctrl+Shift+’ — note that these 
are apostrophes]). To specify the snap zone (the distance — in pixels — at 
which an object will snap to a gridline), InDesign uses whatever settings you 
specified for guidelines, as explained in the “Using ruler guides” section ear-
lier in this chapter.
To display the document grid, choose View➪Grids & Guides➪Show 
Document Grid (Ô+’ or Ctrl+’).

176
Part III: Object Essentials 
Using baseline grids
You may not already realize that each and every new document you create 
includes a baseline grid. A baseline grid can be helpful for aligning text baselines 
across columns and for ensuring that object edges align with text baselines.
But chances are that the default settings for the baseline grid won’t match 
the baselines (leading) for the majority of your text. The default baseline grid 
begins 
1⁄2 inch from the top of a document page; the default gridlines are light 
blue, are spaced 1 pica apart, and appear at view percentages above 75 per-
cent. If you change any of these settings when no documents are open, the 
changes are applied to all subsequently created documents; if a document is 
open, changes apply only to that document.
So here’s how to modify the baseline grid:
 
1. Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Grids (Ô+K) on the Mac or 
Edit➪Preferences➪Grids (Ctrl+K) in Windows.
 
 The Grids pane (refer to Figure 10-4) appears. (If you used a shortcut, 
then select the Grids pane from the list at left.)
 
2. Pick a color for the baseline from the Color pop-up menu in the 
Baseline Grid area.
 
3. In the Start field, enter the distance between the top of the page and 
the first gridline.
 
 If you enter 0, the Increment Every value determines the distance 
between the top of the page and the first gridline.
 
4. In the Increment Every field, enter the distance between gridlines.
 
 If you’re not sure what value to use, enter the leading value for the 
publication’s body text.
 
5. Choose a View Threshold percentage from the pop-up menu or enter a 
value in the field.
 
 You probably don’t want to display the baseline grid at reduced view 
percentages because gridlines become tightly spaced.
 
6. Click OK to close the dialog box and return to the document.
 
The Show/Hide Baseline Grid command (View➪Grids & Guides➪Show/Hide 
Baseline Grid [Option+Ô+’ or Ctrl+Alt+’]) lets you display and hide a 
document’s baseline grid.
When you set a baseline grid, it applies to the entire document. Gridlines are 
displayed behind all objects, layers, and ruler guides. To get text to line up 
to the baseline grid, you need to ensure that the Align to Grid pop-up menu 
is set to either First Line Only or All Lines in your paragraph style or that the 

177
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
Align to Baseline Grid check box is selected in the Paragraph panel or Control 
panel. Chapter 12 covers such paragraph formatting in detail.
A document-wide baseline grid is all fine and dandy, but often it’s not enough. 
The document-wide baseline grid is basically useful for your body text and 
often your headline text, assuming that the baseline grid’s increments match 
the leading for that text. But what if you have other elements, like sidebars, 
that have different leading?
The answer is to use text frame–specific baseline grids. You set the grid as 
part of the text frame options by choosing Object➪Text Frame Options (Ô+B 
or Ctrl+B) and then going to the Baseline Options pane. Its options are almost 
identical to those in the Grids pane of the Preferences dialog box. A baseline 
grid established for a text frame affects only the text in that frame.
Aligning Objects to Each Other
InDesign lets you align and distribute objects, saving you the hassle of manu-
ally moving and placing each element, or figuring out the correct locations in 
the Control panel or Transform panel to do so.
In the section “Working with smart guides,” earlier in this chapter, I explain 
how the new smart guides feature helps you align objects and adjust their 
spacing (as well as dimensions and even rotation angle) as you work with 
them. That’s great for alignment as you work with individual objects. But 
what if you want to align multiple objects at the same time? That’s where the 
Align panel comes in.
The Align panel (Window➪Object & Layout➪Align [Shift+F7]), shown in 
Figure 10-5, has several iconic buttons that let you manipulate the relative 
position of multiple objects in two ways. (The buttons show the alignments 
they provide.) You can
 
 Line up objects along a horizontal or vertical axis. For example, if 
you’ve randomly placed several small graphic frames onto a page, you 
can use the alignment buttons in the Align panel to align them neatly — 
either horizontally or vertically.
 
 Distribute space evenly among objects along a horizontal or vertical 
axis. Here’s a typical problem that’s easily solved by using this feature: 
You’ve carefully placed five small pictures on a page so that the top 
edges are aligned across the page and you have equal space between 
each picture. Then you find out that one of the pictures needs to be 
cut. After deleting the unneeded picture, you can use the Align panel 
to redistribute the space among the remaining pictures so that they’re 
again equally spaced.

and space 
among 
selected 
objects. 
 
The Align buttons don’t work with objects that have been locked with the 
Lock Position command (Object➪Lock Position [Ô+L or Ctrl+L]). If you need 
to align a locked object, you must first unlock it (Object➪Unlock Position 
[Option+Ô+L or Ctrl+Alt+L]). If the objects are on a locked layer, you need to 
unlock the layer.
When you click an iconic button in the Align panel, selected objects are repo-
sitioned in the most logical manner. For example, if you click the Horizontal 
Align Left button, the selected objects are moved horizontally (to the left, in 
this case) so that the left edge of each object is aligned with the left edge of 
the leftmost object. Along the same lines, if you click the Vertical Distribute 
Center button, the selected objects are moved vertically so that an equal 
amount of space appears between the vertical center of each object.
Spacing can appear uneven if you click the Horizontal or Vertical Distribute 
buttons when objects of various sizes are selected. For objects of different 
sizes, you’ll usually want to use the Distribute Spacing buttons (which make 
the space between objects even) rather than space objects based on their 
centers or sides (which is how the Distribute Object buttons work).
 
If the two Distribute Spacing icons don’t appear at the bottom of the panel and 
you want to distribute objects, choose Show Options from the flyout menu.
Stacking Objects
Arranging your objects is as key to having neat and tidy layouts as using 
grids and so on to align objects. (For more on this topic, see the section 
“Lining Up Objects with Guidelines and Grids,” earlier in this chapter.)

179
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
Each time you begin work on a new page, you start with a clean slate (unless 
the page is based on a master page, in which case the master objects act as 
the page’s background; see Chapter 5 for more on master pages). Every time 
you add an object to a page — either by using any of InDesign’s object-creation 
tools or with the Place command (File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]) — the new 
object occupies a unique place in the page’s object hierarchy, or stacking order.
The first object you place on a page is automatically positioned at the bottom 
of the stacking order; the next object is positioned one level higher than the 
first object (that is, in front of the backmost object); the next object is stacked 
one level higher; and so on for every object you add to the page. (It’s not 
uncommon for a page to have several dozen, or even several hundred, stacks.)
Although each object occupies its own stack level, if the objects on a page 
don’t overlap, the stacking order isn’t an issue. But some of the most interest-
ing graphic effects you can achieve with InDesign involve arranging several 
overlapping objects, so you need to be aware of the three-dimensional nature 
of a page’s stacking order.
You may change your mind about what you want to achieve in your layout 
after you’ve already placed objects in it. To change an object’s position in a 
page’s stacking order, use the Arrange command (Object➪Arrange), which 
offers four choices (note the use of brackets in the shortcuts):
 
 Bring to Front (Shift+Ô+] or Ctrl+Shift+])
 
 Bring Forward (Ô+] or Ctrl+])
 
 Send Backward (Ô+[ or Ctrl+[)
 
 Send to Back (Shift+Ô+[ or Ctrl+Shift+[)
 
To select an object that’s hidden behind one or more other objects, press and 
hold Ô or Ctrl and then click anywhere within the area of the hidden object. 
The first click selects the topmost object; each successive click selects the 
next lowest object in the stacking order. When the bottom object is selected, 
the next click selects the top object. If you don’t know where a hidden object 
is, you can simply click the object or objects in front of it and then send the 
object(s) to the back. (See Chapter 8 for more on selecting stacked objects.)
Creating Inline and Anchored Frames
In most cases, you want the frames you place on your pages to remain pre-
cisely where you put them. But sometimes, you want to place frames relative 
to related text in such a way that the frames move when the text is edited.

180
Part III: Object Essentials 
The simplest way is to use inline graphics. For example, if you’re creating a 
product catalog that’s essentially a continuous list of product descriptions 
and you want to include a graphic with each description, you can paste 
graphics within the text to create inline graphics frames.
A close cousin to the inline frame is the anchored frame, in which a frame fol-
lows a point in the text, but that frame isn’t actually in the text. For example, 
you might have a “For More Information” sidebar that you want to appear 
to the left of the text that first mentions a term. By using an anchored frame, 
you can have that sidebar move with the text so that it always appears to its 
left, perhaps in an adjacent column or in the page margins.
Figure 10-6 shows examples of both an inline frame and an anchored frame.
 
Figure 10-6:

frame (at

tors that pop

umn’s right

well as the

Note that the process of creating inline and anchored frames — especially 
anchored frames — can appear overwhelming. It does require thinking 
through the frame’s placement and visualizing that placement so that you 
pick the right options in the various dialog boxes. But relax: You can experi-
ment until you get the hang of it. That’s why InDesign lets you undo your 
work.

181
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
Working with inline frames
An inline frame is treated like a single character (even if it does go deeper 
than a single line). If you insert or delete text that precedes an inline frame, 
the frame moves forward or backward along with the rest of the text that 
follows the inserted or deleted text. Although inline frames usually contain 
graphics, they can just as easily contain text or nothing at all.
 
Inline frames may interfere with line spacing in paragraphs that have 
automatic leading. If the inline frame is larger than the point size in use, 
the automatic leading value for that line is calculated from the inline frame, 
which leads to inconsistent line spacing in the paragraph. To work around 
this issue, you can apply a fixed amount of leading to all characters in the 
paragraph, adjust the size of inline frames, place inline frames at the begin-
ning of a paragraph, or place inline frames in their own paragraphs.
You can create inline frames in three ways: 
 
 By pasting the frame into text
 
 By placing the frame into text
 
 By using the new Anchored Object menu option
The first two methods are the simplest, but the third gives you more control 
over the inline frame when you create it. The third way also lets you create 
anchored frames, which are covered later in this chapter in the section 
“Working with anchored frames.”
Using the Paste command
If you want to create an inline frame from an object you already created, all 
you have to do is copy or cut the object and then paste it into text as you 
would a piece of highlighted text. Here’s how:
 
1. Use the Selection tool to select the object you want to paste within 
text.
 
 You can use any type of object: a line, an empty shape, a text or picture 
frame, or even a group of objects.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Copy (Ô+C or Ctrl+C).
 
 If you don’t need the original item, you can use the Cut command 
(Edit➪Cut [Ô+X or Ctrl+X]) instead of the Copy command.
 
3. Select the Type tool and then click within the text where you want to 
place the copied object.
 
 Make sure that the cursor is flashing where you intend to place the 
inline frame.
 
4. Choose Edit➪Paste (Ô+V or Ctrl+V).

182
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
Inline frames often work best when placed at the beginning of a paragraph. 
If you place an inline frame within text to which automatic leading has been 
applied, the resulting line spacing can be inconsistent. To fix this problem, 
you can resize the inline frame.
Using the Place command
You can also use the Place command to create an inline graphics frame from 
an external picture file. (You can’t use this technique for inline text frames 
because InDesign thinks you’re just inserting the new text at the current 
location, not trying to insert a new text frame there.) Here’s how:
 
1. Select the Type tool and then click within a text frame to establish the 
insertion point.
 
2. Choose File➪Place (Ô+D or Ctrl+D).
 
3. Locate and select the graphics file you want to place within the text; 
choose Open.
 
To delete an inline frame, you can select it and then choose Edit➪Clear or 
Edit➪Cut (Ô+X or Ctrl+X), or you can position the text cursor next to it and 
press Delete or Backspace — just like any other “character.”
Adjusting inline frames
After you create an inline frame, you can adjust its position vertically or 
horizontally. Again, you have your choice of several methods.
Two quick-and-dirty methods to move an inline frame vertically are as 
follows:
 
 Use the Type tool to highlight the inline frame as you would highlight 
an individual text character. In the Character panel or Control panel’s 
Character pane (the A icon), type a positive value in the Baseline Shift 
field to move the inline frame up; type a negative value to move the 
frame down.
 
 Use the Selection tool or Direct Selection tool to select the inline frame; 
drag the frame up or down.
A quick way to move an inline frame horizontally is to follow these steps:
 
1. With the Type tool selected, click between the inline frame and the 
character that precedes it.
 
2. Use the kerning controls in the Character panel or Control panel to 
enlarge or reduce the space between the inline frame and the preceding 
character.

183
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
You can more precisely control the position of inline frames by using the 
Anchored Object Options dialog box, covered in the next section.
 
Of course, you can also adjust the inline frame’s other attributes as needed, 
such as strokes, fills, dimensions, rotation, and skew, by using the Tools panel, 
Control panel, and other panels.
Working with anchored frames
Anchored frames give you a whole new way of organizing objects. Essentially, 
they follow the relevant text within the parameters you specify, such as staying 
to the left of the text or staying at the top of the page that contains the text.
Note that an inline frame is a type of anchored frame, one where the frame 
stays within the text it is linked to. For simplicity, I’m using the term anchored 
frame to mean only those frames that are at least partially outside the text 
frame but remain linked to a specific point in the text.
In addition to preserving anchored frames in imported Microsoft Word files, 
InDesign lets you create anchors in your layout. To create anchored frames, 
do the following:
 
1. Select the Type tool and then click within a text frame to establish the 
insertion point.
 
2. Choose Object➪Anchored Object➪Insert.
 
 The Insert Anchored Object dialog box appears.
 
3. In the Object Options section of the dialog box, specify the anchored 
frame’s settings.
 
 You can choose the type of content (text, graphics, or unassigned) with 
the Content pop-up menu, apply an object style by using the Object 
Style pop-up menu, apply a paragraph style via the Paragraph Style 
pop-up menu (if Content is set to Text), and set the anchored frame’s 
dimensions in the Height and Width fields. Note that the paragraph style 
you choose, if any, applies to the anchored frame, not to the paragraph 
in which the anchored frame is linked.
 
4. In the Position pop-up menu, choose what kind of frame you’re 
creating: Inline or Above Line (both are inline frames) or Custom (an 
anchored frame).
 
 The dialog box displays different options based on that choice, as Figure 
10-7 shows.

184
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
Figure 10-7: 
The Insert 
Anchored 
Object 
dialog box 
for inline 
frames 
(left) and 
anchored 
frames 
(right).
 
 
 Anchored frames that you add by choosing Object➪Anchored 
Object➪Insert don’t have text automatically wrapped around them. Use 
the Text Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap [Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W]) 
to open this panel and set text wrap. But anchored frames created by 
pasting a graphic into text do automatically have text wrap around them.
 
 Selecting the Prevent Manual Positioning option ensures that the 
positions of individual anchored frames can’t be adjusted by using 
InDesign’s other text and frame controls (such as Baseline Shift). This 
option forces users to use this dialog box to change the anchored 
frame’s position, reducing the chances of accidental change.
 
5. Decide whether to select the Relative to Spine option.
 
 If this option is not selected, the anchored frame is placed on the same 
side of the text frame on all pages, whether those pages are left-facing or 
right-facing. If the Relative to Spine option is selected, InDesign places 
the text frame on the outside of both pages or inside of both pages, 
depending on how the anchored position is set.
 
6. In the Anchored Object section of the dialog box, click one of the 
positioning squares to set up the text frame’s relative position.
 
 Note that you need to think about both the horizontal and vertical posi-
tion you desire. For example, if you want the anchored frame to appear 
to the right of the text reference, click one of the right-hand squares. 
(Remember that selecting the Relative to Spine option overrides this 
setting, making the right-hand pages’ positions mirror that of the left-
hand pages, rather than be identical to them.) If you choose the topmost 

185
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
right-hand square, the anchored frame is placed to the right of the text 
reference and vertically appears at or below that text reference. But if 
you choose the bottommost right-hand square, you’re telling InDesign 
you want the anchored frame to appear vertically above the text refer-
ence. Experiment with your layout to see what works best in each case.
 
7. In the Anchored Position section of the dialog box, click one of the 
positioning squares to set up the text reference’s relative position.
 
 Although nine squares appear, the only three that matter are those in 
the middle row. Typically, you place the text reference on the opposite 
side of the anchored frame — if you want the anchored frame to be to 
the left, you’d indicate that the text reference is to the right. (If you set 
the text reference on the same side as the anchored frame, InDesign 
places the anchored frame over the text.) The reason three squares (left, 
middle, and right) appear is to accommodate layouts in which you want 
some anchored frames to appear to the left of the text and some to the 
right; in that case, choose the middle position here and select the right- 
or left-hand position in the Anchored Object section as appropriate to 
that object.
 
8. In necessary, use the options in the Anchored Position section to give 
InDesign more precise instructions on how to place the anchored 
frames.
 
 You have the following options:
 
• The X Relative To pop-up menu tells InDesign from where the 
horizontal location is calculated, using the following options: 
Anchor Marker, Column Edge, Text Frame, Page Margin, and Page 
Edge. The right option depends both on where you want the 
anchored frames placed and whether you have multicolumn text 
boxes (in which case Text Frame and Column Edge result in differ-
ent placement, while in a single-column text frame they do not). 
You can also specify a specific amount of space to place between 
the chosen X Relative To point and the anchored frame by typing a 
value in the X Offset field.
 
• The Y Relative To pop-up menu tells InDesign from where the 
vertical location is calculated, using the following options: Line 
(Baseline), Line (Cap-height), Line (Top of Leading), Column Edge, 
Text Frame, Page Margin, and Page Edge. As you expect, you can 
also indicate a specific amount of space to place between the 
chosen Y Relative To point and the anchored frame by typing a 
value in the Y Offset field.
 
• The Keep Within Top/Bottom Column boundaries check box 
does exactly what it says.
 
9. Click OK to insert the anchored frame.

186
Part III: Object Essentials 
 
You can create inline frames using this same basic process, choosing Inline or 
Above Line in Step 4 in the preceding steps. You get most of the same controls 
as for anchored objects, such as the frame size and type, but, of course, you 
don’t see controls for the relative position because an inline frame goes at the 
text-insertion point. If you want to create an inline frame, use the techniques 
described in the previous section for copying or placing a frame into text.
Converting existing frames to anchored frames
After you get the hang of when and how to use anchored frames, you’ll likely 
want to convert some frames in existing documents into anchored frames. 
InDesign doesn’t offer a direct way to do that task, but you can take a some-
what circuitous path:
 
1. Use the Selection or Direct Selection tool to cut the existing frame that 
you want to make into an anchored frame by choosing Edit➪Cut (Ô+X 
or Ctrl+X).
 
 You can also copy an existing frame by choosing Edit➪Copy (Ô+C or 
Ctrl+C).
Anchoring caveats
Consider these caveats when creating 
anchored frames:
  Because an anchored frame follows its 
text as it flows throughout a document, 
you need to ensure that your layout retains 
clear paths for those anchored objects to 
follow. Otherwise, anchored frames may 
overlap other frames as they move.
  Anchored frames should generally be small 
items and/or used sparingly. The more items 
you have anchored to text, the greater the 
chance that they’ll interfere with each 
other’s placement. Likewise, you can move 
large items only so far within a page, so 
the benefit of keeping them close to their 
related text disappears.
  Items such as pull-quotes are obvious can-
didates for use as anchored frames. But in 
many layouts, you want the pull-quotes to 
stay in specific locations on the page for 
good visual appearance. The InDesign 
anchored-frame function can accom-
modate that need for specific positioning 
on a page, but you need to be careful as 
you add or delete text. You don’t want to 
end up with some pages that have no pull-
quotes at all because you have so much 
text between the pull-quotes’ anchor 
points. Conversely, you need to make sure 
that you don’t have too many pull-quotes 
anchored close to each other, which can 
result in overlapping.
Typically, you use anchored frames for small 
graphics or icons that you want to keep next 
to a specific paragraph (such as the Tip and 
Warning icons used in this book). Another 
good use is for cross-reference (“For More 
Information”) text frames.

187
 Chapter 10: Aligning and Arranging Objects
 
2. Switch to the Type tool and click in a text frame at the desired 
location to insert the text reference to the anchored frame.
 
3. Paste the cut or copied frame into that insertion point by choosing 
Edit➪Paste (Ô+V or Ctrl+V).
 
 You now have an inline frame.
 
4. Select the frame with the Selection tool and then choose 
Object➪Anchored Object➪Options to display the Anchored Object 
Options dialog box.
 
 This dialog box looks like the Insert Anchored Options dialog box, 
shown in Figure 10-7, except that it doesn’t include the top Object 
Options section; you can see that section in Figure 10-6.
 
5. Choose Custom from the Position pop-up menu.
 
 This step converts the frame from an inline frame to an anchored frame.
 
6. Adjust the position for the newly minted anchored frame as described 
in the previous section.
 
7. Click OK when you’re done.
Adjusting anchored frames
After you create an anchored frame, you can adjust its position.
A quick-and-dirty method is simply to click and drag anchored frames or use 
the Control panel to adjust their position. If the text the frame is anchored 
to moves, however, InDesign overrides those changes. (You can’t manually 
move an anchored frame if the Prevent Manual Positioning option is selected 
in the Insert Anchored Object dialog box or Anchored Object Options dialog 
box. This option is deselected by default.)
For the most control of an anchored frame’s position, choose 
Object➪Anchored Object➪Options. The resulting Anchored Object Options 
dialog box is identical to the Insert Anchored Object dialog box but without 
the Object Options section.
And, of course, you can adjust the frame’s other attributes as needed, such 
as strokes, fills, dimensions, rotation, and skew.
 
The Select Next Object and Select Previous Object functions now work for 
anchored objects in text. If you select an anchored object and use these 
functions, InDesign CS4 moves to the next (or previous) anchored object in 
the current story. (Chapter 8 covers object selection.)

188
Part III: Object Essentials 
Releasing and deleting anchored frames
If you no longer want an anchored frame to be anchored to a text location, you 
can release the anchor. To do so, select the anchored frame with the Selection 
or Direct Selection tool and then choose Object➪Anchored Object➪Release.
It’s also easy to delete an anchored frame: Select the frame with the Selection 
or Direct Selection tool and then choose Edit➪Clear or press Delete or 
Backspace. If you want to remove the object but keep it on the Clipboard for 
pasting elsewhere, choose Edit➪Cut (Ô+X or Ctrl+X).

etting words on the page is an important part of 
what you do with InDesign. After you have the words 
in place, you’ll want to tweak the letters and lines, and the 
space between them, to make your pages sparkle. 
This part shows you how to arrange words on the page, 
including words made up of exotic characters. You find 
out how to set text in columns and how to add bullets and 
numbers to that text. You also discover how to stretch,

ext is more than words — it’s also a layout element that flows through 
your pages in the locations that you need. Much of the work you do in 
InDesign involves controlling that flow and working with the text as blocks 
that need to have the right arrangement to fit your layout’s goals.
This chapter helps you manage that flow and arrangement, showing you how 
to deftly maneuver the text through your layout, just as you would move 
your way through the dance floor.
After you have the steps nailed down, you can do the dance: bringing in text 
from your source files.
Working with Text Frames
When you’re creating a simple layout, such as a single-page flyer or a magazine 
advertisement, you’ll probably create text frames — the containers for text — 
as you need them. But if you’re working on a book or a magazine, you’ll want 
your text frames placed on master pages so that your text will be consistently 
framed automatically when it appears on document pages. And you’ll still have 
individual text frames you create for specific elements like sidebars.
Chapter 7 shows you how to create frames (including text frames), 
whereas Chapter 5 shows you how to create master pages. This chapter brings 
those two concepts together to show you how to work with text frames, both 
those in master pages and those you create in your document pages.

192
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Creating master text frames
Master pages — predesigned pages that you can apply to other pages to 
automate layout and ensure consistency — can contain several types of text 
frames:
 
 Text frames containing standing text, such as page numbers or page 
headers.
 
 Text frames containing placeholder text for elements such as figure 
captions or headlines.
 
 One master text frame (an automatically placed text frame for flowing 
text throughout pages), which you create in the New Document dialog 
box (File➪New➪Document [Ô+N or Ctrl+N]).
Think of a master text frame as an empty text frame on the default master 
page that lets you automatically flow text through a document. When you 
create a new document, you can create a master text frame at the same time. 
Here’s how it works:
 
1. Choose File➪New➪Document (Ô+N or Ctrl+N).
 
2. Check the Master Text Frame check box at the top of the New 
Document dialog box.
 
3. Specify the size and placement of the master text frame by entering 
values in the Margins area for Top, Bottom, Inside, and Outside (or 
Left and Right if Facing Pages is unchecked) fields.
 
 InDesign places guides according to these values and places a text frame 
within the guides. The text frame fits within the boundaries of these 
values and those of the guides on the master page.
 
4. To specify the number of columns in the master text frame, enter a 
value in the Number field in the Columns area.
 
 You can also specify the amount of space between the columns by 
entering a value in the Gutter field.
 
5. Establish any other needed settings, as described in Chapter 3.
 
 Check the Facing Pages check box if your pages will have different inside 
and outside margins. (For example, a book may have different inside and 
outside margins for left-hand and right-hand pages.)
 
6. Click OK to create a new document containing a master text frame.
After you create a document with a master text frame, you’ll see guides on 
the first document page that indicate the placement of the frame.

193
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
Creating individual text frames
Although the master text frame is helpful for containing body text that flows 
through a document, you’ll probably need additional text frames on both 
master pages and document pages. Generally, these smaller text frames hold 
text such as headlines, sidebars, or captions.
To add text frames to a master page for repeating elements such as headers 
and footers, first display the master page. Choose Window➪Pages (Ô+F12 
or Ctrl+F12) to display the Pages panel. Then double-click the A-Master icon 
in the upper portion of the panel, as shown in Figure 11-1, which displays 
the A-Master master page. (If you have multiple master pages in your docu-
ment, you can follow these instructions to add text frames to any of them. 
Just choose the desired master page.)
 
Figure 11-1: 
To access 
a master 
page so that 
you can add 
or modify 
text frames 
and other 
objects, 
double-click 
its master-
page icon 
in the upper 
portion of 
the Pages 
panel.
 
 
To add text frames to a document page, first go to the page. You can use any 
of the techniques described in Chapter 4 to move among pages.
Now draw the desired frame using any of the frame or shape tools, or the 
Type tool, as described in Chapter 6. Modify them with the Control panel (or 
Transform panel) or by using the mouse, also as described in that chapter.

194
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
Text frames you add to a master page will show up on any document pages 
based on that master page.
If you’re working on a document page and want to type inside a text 
frame placed on the page by a master page, select the Type tool and then 
Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click the frame.
Setting up automatic page creation
Often when you import a large text file, such as for a book or report, you 
don’t know how many pages you need. Chances are that you have a few 
pages in your document already set up and then add more pages until the 
text is all placed. InDesign CS4now offers an easier way.
 
InDesign CS4 has a new feature called autoflow that adds pages to the end of 
your document until all the text has been placed. For autoflow to work, you 
must do two things:
 
1. Enable autoflow in the Type pane of the Preferences dialog 
box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Type [Ô+K] on the Mac or 
Edit➪Preferences➪Type [Ctrl+K] in Windows).
 
 Be sure that Smart Text Reflow is checked and then choose the appro-
priate reflow options in the Add Pages To pop-up menu — End of Story, 
End of Section, and End of Document — to determine where the extra 
pages are added.
 
 I recommend that you use this feature with the Limit to Master Text 
Frames and Preserve Facing-Page Spreads options enabled. The first 
option assumes that you set up master text frames, as described in the 
“Creating master text frames” section, earlier in this chapter. If you don’t 
use such master text frames, don’t check this option. Instead, be sure that 
if you set up your own text frames in the master page (see the previous 
section) that you have threaded them to each other, as described in the 
“Threading text frames” section, later in this chapter. The second option 
means that if you have spreads already set up in you document, they 
won’t get messed up (in other words, be split up) by the added pages.
 
2. When you place your text, do so in your master text frame or in a text 
frame defined on your master page.
 
 InDesign uses these (and only these) frames to create the new pages 
from. Remember that you can place text in a frame that already has 
text (to replace that text or to add more text), as well as place text in 
an empty frame. No matter which approach you take, InDesign adds the 
necessary number of pages for the placed text to flow into.

195
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
 
The smart text flow feature doesn’t work if you place text into a document 
text frame; it must be placed in a master text frame or in a text frame that is 
defined on a master page.
 
InDesign offers two other methods to autoflow text into master frames, 
whether or not smart text flow is enabled:
 
 If you hold the Shift key when placing text, InDesign flows the text into 
the master frame and keeps going until it runs out of pages with master 
frames. Then it creates more master frames until the text is all placed. 
Unlike with the new smart text reflow feature, you can’t control where 
those pages are added.
 
 If you hold Option+Shift or Alt+Shift when placing text, InDesign flows 
the text into the nearest master frame and automatically flows it into the 
subsequent “open” master frames in your document. Unlike the Shift-
only option, it does not add new pages.
The details on placing text are covered in the “Importing text” section, later 
in this chapter.
Making changes to text frames
You’re not confined to the settings you originally established when you set 
up a master text frame or an individual text frame; you can change the size, 
shape, and/or number of columns in the text frame later. Use the Selection 
tool to click the desired text frame and then modify it with the following 
options (the first six are covered in detail in Chapter 8):
 
 Change the placement of a selected master text frame by using the X: 
and Y: fields in the Control panel.
 
 Change the size of the master text frame by using the W: and H: fields.
 
 Change the angle by using the Rotation Angle field.
 
 Change the skew by using the Shear X Angle field.
 
 Enter values in the Scale fields to increase or decrease, by percentage 
amounts, the width and height of the text frame.
 
 Use the General pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box 
(Object➪Text Frame Options [Ô+B or Ctrl+B], shown in Figure 11-2) to 
make further modifications:
 
• Change the number of columns and the space between them.
 
• Specify how far text is inset from each side of the frame.
 
• Align text vertically within the frame.
 
• Control the placement of the first baseline.

196
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 Use the Baseline Options pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box 
to set a baseline grid, if desired, for the text to align to. Chapter 10 
describes this feature in more detail.
 
 If you don’t want the text inside this text frame to wrap around any items 
in front of it, check Ignore Text Wrap at the bottom of the dialog box.
 
 If you open the Text Frame Options dialog box with no document open, 
any changes you make will become the default for all new documents.
 
Figure 11-2: 
Change 
the proper-
ties of a 
text frame 
using the 
Text Frame 
Options 
dialog box.
 
 
 Specify character styles, paragraph styles, object styles, Story panel 
settings, text-wrap settings, and other text attributes to apply in the text 
frame to the document text you flow into that frame. (You can always 
override those attributes by applying other styles or formatting to the 
text later.) The rest of Part IV covers these other settings.
Additionally, if you select the frame with the Direct Selection tool, you can 
change its shape by dragging anchor points on the frame to other positions, 
as described in Chapter 8.
Importing Text
You can import text from a word processor file (Word 97/98 or later, RTF, 
ASCII [text-only], or InDesign Tagged Text files) into an InDesign text frame 
using the Place dialog box (File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]). You can also import 
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets (Version 97/98 or later). Many of the text’s orig-
inal styles will remain intact, although you will want to review the imported 
text carefully to see whether any adjustments need to be made.

197
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
Follow these steps to place imported text:
 
1. Choose File➪Place (Ô+D or Ctrl+D) to open the Place dialog box.
 
2. Locate the text file you want to import.
 
3. To specify how to handle current formatting in the file, check the 
Show Import Options check box.
 
 The appropriate Import Options dialog box for the text file’s format 
opens. (Note that no import options exist for ASCII text.) Then click OK 
to return to the Place dialog box.
 
4. Click the Open button to import the text.
 
 If you selected an empty frame with the Type tool, InDesign will flow the 
text into that frame. If you selected a text frame with the Type tool, InDesign 
will flow the text at the text-insertion point in that frame, inserting the new 
text within the existing text.
 
 If you hadn’t already selected a frame before starting to import the text, 
specify where to place it by clicking and dragging the loaded-text icon to 
create a rectangular text frame, clicking in an existing frame, or clicking 
in any empty frame.
You can select multiple files — text and/or graphics — by Shift+clicking a 
range or Ô+clicking or Ctrl+clicking multiple files one by one. InDesign lets 
you place each file in a separate frame. Just click once for each file imported, 
or Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click to have InDesign place all files on the 
page in separate frames. The loaded-text icon shows the number of files to be 
placed, as well as a mini-preview of each file, as shown in Figure 11-3.
 
Figure 11-3:

198
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
When placing files, you can use the keyboard left- and right-arrow keys to 
move through the thumbnail previews before clicking to place the one whose 
thumbnail preview is currently displayed. That way, you can place the files in 
any order you want.
 
You can’t click on a master text frame — a text frame that is placed on the 
page by the master page in use — and simply start typing. To select a master 
text frame and add text to it, Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click it. (For more on 
master pages, see Chapter 5.)
Import options for Microsoft 
Word and RTF files
InDesign offers a comprehensive set of import options for Word and RTF 
files. With these options, you can control how these files import into 
InDesign. To save time on future imports, you can save your import prefer-
ences as a preset file for repeat use.
Figure 11-4 shows the Microsoft Word Import Options dialog box. The import 
options for RTF files are identical.
The Preset pop-up menu, at the top of the dialog box, lets you select from 
saved sets of import options. You can save the current settings by clicking 
the Save Preset button. And you can set a preset as the default import behav-
ior by clicking the Set as Default button; these settings are used for all Word 
file imports unless you choose a new default or make changes in this dialog 
box. This default preset capability lets you avoid using the Import Options 
dialog box for your routine imports.
The Include section of the Import Options dialog box is where you decide 
whether to strip out specific types of text (Table of Contents Text, Index 
Text, Footnotes, and Endnotes) from the Word file. If you check items, their 
corresponding text will be imported. You probably won’t want to import 
table-of-contents or index text because you can create much nicer-looking 
tables of contents and indexes in InDesign.

199
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
 
Figure 11-4: 
The Import 
Options 
dialog box 
for a 
Word file.
 
The third section, Options, has just one option: Use Typographer’s Quotes. If 
this box is checked, InDesign converts keyboard quotes from your source file 
(‘ and ") to “curly” typographic quotes (‘, ’, “, and ”).
The fourth section, Formatting, is fairly complex, so take it one step at a 
time. Start with deciding whether to remove or retain the formatting in your 
imported text.
To remove text formatting during import so that you can do the formatting 
in InDesign, select the Remove Styles and Formatting from Text and Tables 
option. You have two additional controls for this option:
 
 Preserve Local Overrides, which retains local formatting such as ital-
ics and boldface while ignoring the paragraph style attributes. You’d 
usually want this option checked so that meaning-related formatting is 
retained.
 
 You also can choose how tables are “unformatted” during import via the 
Convert Tables To pop-up menu. Unformatted Tables retains the table’s 
cell structure but ignores text and cell formatting, while Unformatted 
Tabbed Text converts the table to tabbed text (with a tab separating 
what used to be cells and a paragraph return separating what used to 
be rows) and strips out any formatting. If you intend to keep tables as 
tables but format them in InDesign, choose Unformatted Tables.

200
Part IV: Text Essentials 
To retain text formatting during import so that the InDesign document at 
least starts out using the settings used in Word, choose the Preserve Styles 
and Formatting from Text and Tables option. This option includes several 
controls and bits of information:
 
 The Manual Page Breaks pop-up menu lets you retain any page breaks 
entered in Word, convert them to column breaks, or strip them out.
 
 Checking the Import Inline Graphics check box enables the import of 
any graphics in the Word text.
 
 Checking the Import Unused Styles check box means that all Word style 
sheets transfer into InDesign, rather than just the ones you actually 
applied to text in the file. Unless you want all those extra Word styles, 
keep this box unchecked.
 
 Checking the Track Changes check box preserves the revisions track-
ing information from Word so that you can see it in the companion 
Adobe InCopy editing program. But InDesign itself doesn’t display or let 
you use that tracking information. This book doesn’t cover the expert 
InCopy add-on software.
 
 Checking Convert Bullets & Numbers to Text removes any automatic 
bullet and numbering lists in Word, converting the bullets and numbers 
into the actual characters. If you select this option and insert an item in 
an imported numbered list, the list doesn’t renumber automatically, as 
it would if you leave this unchecked. (In previous versions of InDesign, 
bullets and numbers were converted, eliminating the automatic aspect.)
 
 If InDesign detects that the Word file has a style with the same name 
as your InDesign document, it notes how many to the right of the Style 
Name Conflicts label. You have choices in how to handle these conflicts:
 
• Use InDesign Style Definition preserves the current InDesign style 
sheets and applies them to any text in Word that uses a style sheet 
of the same name. Redefine InDesign Style causes the Word style 
sheet’s formatting to permanently replace that of InDesign’s style 
sheet. Auto Rename renames the Word file’s style sheet and adds 
it to the Paragraph Styles or Character Styles panel. This option 
preserves your existing InDesign style sheets while also preserving 
those imported from the Word file.
 
• Customize Style Import lets you decide which specific InDesign 
styles override same-name Word styles, which Word styles over-
ride same-name InDesign styles, and which Word styles are 
renamed during import to prevent any overriding.

201
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
Import options for Microsoft Excel files
When importing Excel spreadsheets, you have several options, as Figure 11-5 
shows.
In the Options section, you can control the following settings:
 
 The Sheet pop-up menu lets you choose which sheet in an Excel workbook 
to import. The default is the first sheet, which is usually named Sheet1 
unless you renamed it in Excel. (If you want to import several sheets, you’ll 
need to import the same spreadsheet several times, choosing a different 
sheet each time.)
 
 The View pop-up menu lets you import custom views that are defined in 
Excel for that spreadsheet. If the spreadsheet has no custom views, this 
pop-up menu is grayed out. You can also ignore any custom views by 
choosing [Ignore View] from the pop-up menu.
 
 In the Cell Range pop-up menu, you specify a range of cells using stan-
dard Excel notation Sx:Ey, where S is the first row, x the first column, 
E the last row, and y the last column, such as A1:G35. You can enter a 
range directly in the pop-up menu, which also acts as a text-entry field, 
or choose a previously entered range from the pop-up menu.
 
 Checking the Import Hidden Cells Not Saved in View check box imports 
hidden cells. Be careful when doing so, because these cells are usually 
hidden for a reason. (Typically, they show interim calculations and the 
like.)

Options 
dialog box

file.
 

202
Part IV: Text Essentials 
In the Formatting section, you can control the following settings:
 
 In the Table pop-up menu, you choose from Formatted Table, which 
imports the spreadsheet as a table and retains text and cell formatting; 
Unformatted Table, which imports the spreadsheet as a table but doesn’t 
preserve formatting; and Unformatted Tabbed Text, which imports the 
spreadsheet as tabbed text (tabs separate cells and paragraph returns 
separate rows) with no formatting retained.
 
 In the Table Style pop-up menu, you choose an InDesign table style to 
apply to the imported table or leave it alone (by choosing [No Table 
Style]).
 
 In the Cell Alignment pop-up menu, you tell InDesign how to align the 
text in cells. You can retain the spreadsheet’s current alignment settings 
by choosing Current Spreadsheet or override them by choosing Left, 
Right, or Center.
 
 Checking the Include Inline Graphics check box imports any graphics 
placed in the Excel cells.
 
 The Number of Decimal Places to Include field is where you enter how 
many decimal places to retain for numbers.
 
 Check the Use Typographer’s Quotes check box to convert keyboard 
quotes (‘ and ") to the “curly” typographic quotes (‘, ’, “, and ”). Keeping 
this box checked is a good idea.
Keep characters to a minimum
When you’re working with text in a professional 
publishing application, such as InDesign, you 
need to keep in mind some differences between 
the professional method and traditional way of 
typing:
  Remember that you don’t need to type 
two spaces after a period or colon; books, 
newspapers, magazines, and other profes-
sional documents all use just one space 
after such punctuation.
  Don’t enter extra paragraph returns for 
space between paragraphs and don’t enter 
tabs to indent paragraphs — instead, set up 
this formatting using InDesign’s paragraph 
attributes (Type➪Paragraph [Option+Ô+T 
or Ctrl+Alt+T]).
  To align text in columns, don’t enter extra 
tabs; place the same number of tabs 
between each column and then align 
the tabs (Type➪Tabs, or Shift+Ô+T or 
Ctrl+Shift+T).
To see where your InDesign document has tabs, 
paragraph breaks, spaces, and other such invis-
ible characters, choose Type➪Show Hidden 
Characters (Option+Ô+I or Ctrl+Alt+I). You can 
also view them from the application bar’s View 
Options pop-up menu (see Chapter 1).

203
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
Pasting text into an InDesign document
As you probably already know, you can hold text on the Mac or Windows 
Clipboard by cutting it or copying it from its original location. After you’ve 
captured some text on the Clipboard, you can paste it into an InDesign docu-
ment at the location of the cursor. You can also replace highlighted text with 
the text that’s on the Clipboard. If no text frame is active when you do the 
pasting, InDesign creates a new text frame to contain the pasted text.
InDesign uses standard menu commands and keyboard commands for cut-
ting/copying text to the Clipboard, and for pasting text. On the Mac, press 
Ô+X to cut, Ô+C to copy, and Ô+V to paste. In Windows, press Ctrl+X to cut, 
Ctrl+C to copy, and Ctrl+V to paste.
Text that is cut or copied from InDesign normally retains its formatting, 
whereas text pasted from other programs loses its formatting. But you can 
specify whether pasted text from other programs always retains its for-
matting. Go to the Clipboard Handling pane in the Preferences dialog box 
(choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Clipboard Handling [Ô+K] on the Mac, 
or choose Edit➪Preferences➪Clipboard Handling [Ctrl+K] in Windows) 
and select the All Information option in the When Pasting Text and Tables 
from Other Applications section. If you select this option, you can still tell 
InDesign to not preserve the formatting on a case-by-case basis by choosing 
Edit➪Paste without Formatting (Shift+Ô+V or Ctrl+Shift+V).
Dragging and dropping text
You can drag highlighted text from other programs — or even text files from 
the desktop or a folder — into an InDesign document. Text that you drag and 
drop is inserted at the location of the cursor, replaces highlighted text, or is 
placed in a new rectangular text frame.
When you drag and drop a text selection, its original formatting is usually 
retained — unless you hold the Shift key when dragging. If you hold the Shift 
key, the text takes on the attributes of the text you drag it into.
When you drag and drop a text file, the process is more like a text import: 
The text retains its formatting and styles. Unlike the Place command 
(File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]) that imports text, drag and drop doesn’t give 
you the option to specify how some of the formatting and styles in the 
imported text file are handled.

204
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Threading Text Frames
The text that flows through a series of frames is what InDesign considers a 
story, and the connections among those frames are called threads. When you 
edit text in a threaded story, the text reflows throughout the text frames. You 
can also spell-check and do a find/change operation for an entire story, even 
though you have just one of the story’s text frames active on-screen.
When you have threaded text frames, you’ll see visual indicators on your text 
frame, assuming that you choose View➪Show Text Threads (Option+Ô+Y or 
Ctrl+Alt+Y) and have selected the frame with one of the selection tools. At 
the lower right of the text frame is a small square, called the out port, which 
indicates the outflow status:
 
 If the square is empty, that means you have no text flowing to another 
frame, and not enough text to flow to another frame.
 
 If the square is red and has a plus sign in it, that means you have more 
text than fits in the selected frame but that it’s not flowing to another 
frame. This condition is called overset text.
 
 If the square has a triangle icon, the text is flowing to another frame. 
That doesn’t mean that text is flowing, just that if you have more text 
than the current frame can hold, it will flow.
Similarly, an in port at the upper left of a text frame indicates whether text is 
flowing from another frame into the current frame:
 
 If the square is empty, no text is flowing from another frame, making this 
frame the first (and perhaps only) frame in a story.
 
 If the square has a triangle icon, the text is flowing from another frame. 
That doesn’t mean that text is flowing, just that if you have more text 
than the other frame can hold, it will flow into this frame.
So how do you thread the frames in the first place? You have four options in 
InDesign: manual, semi-autoflow, and two types of autoflow. Each of these 
options has its own icon. The method you choose depends on the amount of 
text you’re dealing with and the size and number of your text frames:
 
 
 To link two empty text frames across several pages (for example, for an 
article that starts on page 2 and continues on page 24) — for frames 
where you will later want to text to flow across — you might use the 
manual method, in which you click the first text frame’s out port and 
then click on the second text frame.
 
 
 To link a text frame with text to another text frame, you might also use 
the manual method, in which you click the first text frame’s out port and 
then click on the second text frame.

205
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
 
 
 To link a succession of text frames, you might want to use the semi-
autoflow method, which allows you to click a series of text frames to 
flow text from one frame to the next. Hold the Option or Alt key when 
clicking the mouse during text placement. Remember that, as you’re 
threading frames, Option+click or Alt+click each text frame, or you’ll 
revert to manual threading.
 
 
 To import text that is intended for long documents (such as a book 
chapter or brochure), you might want to use the autoflow method to 
add text frames and pages that accommodate the text you’re importing. 
Hold the Shift key when clicking the mouse during text placement to fill 
all open master frames and create new ones as needed. Be sure to 
Shift+click near the upper-left corner of the master text frame so that 
InDesign uses that frame rather than create a new one. Note that even if 
you’ve already placed a text file into a single text frame or a threaded 
chain of text frames, you can still autoflow text from the last text frame. 
To do so, click the out port and then Shift+click any page to indicate 
where to start the autoflow.
 
 
 To import text into a long page where you don’t want new pages 
added, hold Option+Shift or Alt+Shift. The text autoflows into each open 
page, but no new pages are added.
 
 
 To place multiple text frames in an array — such as for bios or other 
snippet-size text — hold Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift when dragging the mouse 
in your document. The files will be placed in an array, each in its own 
frame within the area defined when dragging the mouse. This new 
InDesign CS4 feature creates as many frames as it that array, placing the 
files into them. Any files not placed remain in the load-text icon for 
placement elsewhere.
 
For a quick glance at your text threads while you’re threading text across 
pages, simply change the document view briefly to 20 percent or so.
 
Text flows in the order in which you select frames. If you move a frame, its 
order in the text flow remains unchanged. If you’re not careful, you can, for 
example, accidentally have text flow from a frame at the top of the page to a 
frame at the bottom of a page and then to one in the middle of a page.
 
Always switch to a selection tool when you’re threading frames. Oddly, you 
can’t thread frames while the Type tool is selected. Oh well.

206
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Breaking and rerouting threads
After text frames are threaded, you have three options for changing the 
threads: You can break threads to stop text from flowing, insert a text frame 
into an existing chain of threaded text frames, and remove text frames from a 
thread. Here are the techniques in a nutshell:
 
 Break the link between two text frames by double-clicking either 
an out port or an in port. The thread between the two text frames is 
removed, and all text that had flowed from that point is sucked out of 
the subsequent text frames and stored as overset text.
 
 Insert a text frame after a specific text frame in a chain by clicking its 
out port. Then, click and drag the loaded-text icon to create a new text 
frame. That new frame is automatically threaded to both the previous 
and the next text frames.
 
 Reroute text threads — for example, to drop the middle text frame 
from a chain of three — by clicking the text frame with the Selection 
tool and then pressing Delete or Backspace. This technique deletes the 
text frame and reroutes the threads. You can also Shift+click to multiple-
select text frames to remove. Note that you can’t reroute text threads 
without removing the text frames.
Working with Columns
Where you place columns on the page — and the amount of space you allow 
between columns — has a big impact on readability. Used with a little know-
how, column width works with type size and leading to make text easier to 
read. Columns help you keep from getting lost from one line to the next, and 
from getting a headache as you’re trying to read the words on the page.
 
Generally, as columns get wider, the type size and leading increase. For 
example, you might see 9-point text and 15-point leading in 2
1⁄2-inch columns, 
whereas 15-point text and 13-point leading might work better in 3
1⁄2-inch 
columns.
InDesign lets you place columns on the page automatically, create any 
number of columns within a text frame, and change columns at any time.

207
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
Specifying columns in master frames
You can specify the number of columns at the same time you create a master 
text frame — a text frame placed automatically within the margin guides.
In the Columns area in the New Document dialog box, use the Number field to 
specify how many columns, and the Gutter field to specify how much space 
to place between the columns. (The gutter is the space between columns.) 
Whether or not you check Master Text Frame (which makes the frame appear 
on all pages), guides for these columns are still placed on the page and can 
be used for placing text frames and other objects.
Changing columns in text frames
You can change the number of columns in a text frame (whether an individ-
ual text frame or a master text frame), even after you’ve flown text into the 
frame — and doing so isn’t difficult. First, select the text frame with a selec-
tion tool or the Type tool (or Shift+click to select multiple text frames and 
change all their columns at once). Then choose Object➪Text Frame Options 
(Ô+B or Ctrl+B) and set the desired Number and Gutter values in the General 
pane of the Text Frame Options dialog box, shown in Figure 11-2.
You can also use the Control panel to quickly change the number of columns, 
but note that this control doesn’t display on a monitor set below 1152-x-870-
pixel resolution unless you customize the Control panel interface (to disable 
other controls to make room for this one) using the Customize command in 
its flyout menu.
 
Some designers like to draw each column as a separate frame. I strongly rec-
ommend against this practice; it’s too easy to create columns of slightly dif-
ferent widths and slightly different positions, so text doesn’t align properly. 
Instead, specify columns in your text frames so that you don’t have to worry 
about sloppy layouts.
Note that the options in the Columns area of the Text Frame Options dialog 
box work differently depending on whether Fixed Column Width is checked 
or unchecked:
 
 If Fixed Column Width is unchecked, InDesign subtracts from the text 
frame the space specified for the gutters and then divides the remaining 
width by the number of columns to figure out how wide the columns can 
be. For example, if you specify a 10-inch-wide text frame with three col-
umns and a gutter of 
1⁄2 inch, you end up with three 3-inch columns and 
two 
1⁄2-inch gutters. The math is (10 – (2 × 0.5)) ÷ 3.

208
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 If Fixed Column Width is checked, InDesign resizes the text frame to fit 
the number of columns you selected at the indicated size, as well as the 
gutters between them. For example, suppose that you’re using a 10-inch-
wide text frame with a column width of 5 inches and a gutter of 
1⁄2 inch, 
and you choose three columns: You end up with a 15-inch-wide text 
frame containing three 5-inch columns and two 
1⁄2-inch gutters. The math 
is (5 × 3) + (2 × 2).
Check Preview to see the effects of your changes before finalizing them.
Wrapping Text around Objects
In the days before personal computers and page-layout software, wrapping 
text around a graphic or other object was a time-consuming and expensive 
task. Text wraps were rare, found only in the most expensively produced 
publications. Not any more. Not only do all page-layout programs let you 
create text runarounds, most programs — including InDesign — provide 
several options for controlling how text relates to graphics and other objects 
that obstruct its flow.
When a frame is positioned in front of a text frame, InDesign provides the 
following options. You can
 
 Ignore the frame and flow the text behind it.
 
 Wrap the text around the frame’s rectangular bounding box.
 
 Wrap the text around the frame itself.
 
 Jump the text around the frame (that is, jump the text from the top of 
the frame to the bottom).
 
 Jump the text to the next column or page when the text reaches the top 
of frame.
 
 Specify the amount of distance between the text and the edge of the 
obstructing shape.
 
 Flow text within the obstructing shape rather than outside it.
 
InDesign lets you wrap text around frames on hidden layers — as well as 
remove text wrap for objects on hidden layers. This technique is handy when 
you want to hide images or other distracting items but preserve the layout. 
See Chapter 4 for details on using layers.
 
If you want to wrap text around only a portion of a graphic — perhaps you 
need to isolate a face in a crowd — the best solution is to open the graphics 
file in its original program, create a clipping path around that portion, and 
then resave the file and import it and its clipping path into an InDesign docu-
ment. (Chapter 18 explains clipping paths.)

209
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
The Text Wrap panel
The controls in the Text Wrap panel (see Figure 11-6) let you specify how a 
selected object will affect the flow of text behind it. Remember, the flow of 
text around an obstructing object is determined by the text-wrap settings 
applied to the obstructing object.
 
You can override the text-wrap settings of objects that are in front of a text 
frame by telling the text frame to ignore them. To do so, click a text frame and 
then choose Object➪Text Frame Options (Ô+B or Ctrl+B). In the Text Frame 
Options dialog box’s General pane, select Ignore Text Wrap and then click OK. 
Text in the frame now flows behind any obstructing items regardless of the 
text-wrap settings applied to them.
 
The Text Wrap panel has three options that may not display when you open 
it: Wrap Options, Contour Options, and Include Inside Edges. You can more 
easily hide/show these functions by double-clicking the double-arrow symbol 
to the left of the Text Wrap label in the panel’s tab or by choosing Hide 
Options/Show Options from the flyout menu.
Here’s how to apply text-wrap settings to a frame or other object:
 
1. If the Text Wrap panel isn’t displayed, choose Window➪Text Wrap 
(Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W).
 
2. Click any of the selection tools.
 
3. Click the object to which you want to apply text-wrap settings.
 
 The object can be anywhere, but you’ll probably want to position it on 
top of a text frame that contains text so that you can see the results of 
the settings you apply.
 
4. Click one of the five text-wrap iconic buttons at the top of the Text 
Wrap panel.
 
 The iconic buttons show you what each wrap does conceptually.
 
5. If you want, adjust the space between the surrounding text and the 
obstructing shape by typing values in the Top Offset, Bottom Offset, 
Left Offset, and Right Offset fields.
 
 These fields aren’t available if you click the No Text Wrap button. If the 
object is a rectangle, all four fields are available if you click the Wrap 
around Bounding Box button or Wrap around Object Shape. Only the 
Top Offset field is available if you click the Wrap around Object Shape 
button for a free-form shape or the Jump to Next Column button. The 
Top Offset and Bottom Offset fields are available if you click the Jump 
Object button.

210
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 If the Make All Settings the Same iconic button displays a chain, then 
changing any of the offset values will cause the other offset values to 
match. If the icon shows a broken chain, each offset value is indepen-
dent of the others. Click the button to switch between these two modes.
 
6. Select Invert if you want to flow the text in the obstructing shape.
 
7. If you choose the Wrap around Object Shape button and a graphic 
is in the frame, you can also select from the Contour Options’s Type 
pop-up menu.
 
 You have six options:
 
• Bounding Box is the same as clicking the Wrap around Bounding 
Box button.
 
• Detect Edges tries to determine the graphic’s outside boundary 
by ignoring white space — you’d use this option for bitmapped 
images that have a transparent or white background.
 
• Alpha Channel uses the image’s alpha channel, if any, to create a 
wrapping boundary (see Chapter 18).
 
• Photoshop Path uses the image’s clipping path, if any, to create a 
wrapping boundary (see Chapter 18).
 
• Graphic Frame uses the frame’s boundary rather than the 
bounding box.
 
• Same as Clipping uses the clipping path for the graphic created in 
InDesign (see Chapter 18).
 
8. You can control how text wraps around an object that splits a column 
by choosing an option from the Wrap To pop-up menu.
 
 The options are Right Side, Left Side, Both Right & Left Sides, Side 
Towards Spine, Side Away from Spine, and Largest Area. You’ll rarely 
choose Both Left and Right Sides, because unless the object is small, read-
ers’ eyes will stop at the interposed object and not see the rest of the text 
on the other side of it. Use either of the spine options to have the text stay 
on the outside or inside of a page, relative to the object, based on whether 
the page is right-facing or left-facing. You’ll often choose Largest Area 
because that gives the text the most space next to the interposed object, 
which tends to be what looks good in many situations.
 
9. By selecting the Include Inside Edges option, InDesign lets text appear 
inside any interior “holes” in the graphic.
 
 You’ll rarely use this technique because in most cases it’s hard for the 
reader to follow text that wraps around an image, flows inside it, and 
then continues to flow outside it. But if the interior is large enough and 
not too distant from the text that flows on the outside, this effect may be 
readable.

211
 Chapter 11: Putting Words on the Page
 
Figure 11-6: 
The Text 
Wrap panel.
 
 
If you specify text-wrap settings when no objects are selected, the settings are 
automatically applied to all new objects.
 
To apply text-wrap settings to a master item on a document page, press and 
hold Shift+Ô or Ctrl+Shift to select the item and then use the controls in the 
Text Wrap panel as described in the preceding steps. If you don’t want the 
text wrap applied to existing document items, just to new ones, choose Apply 
to Master Page Only in the flyout menu.
Setting text-wrap preferences
You should be aware of several global text-wrap options, all of which 
are accessed via the Composition pane of the Preferences dialog box. 
(Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Composition [Ô+K] on the Mac or 
Edit➪Preferences➪Composition [Ctrl+K] in Windows.) Here are the options:
 
 Justify Text Next to an Object: This option is useful when you have left-
aligned text that wraps around an object at the right. (It also works if 
you have right-aligned text that wraps around an object at the left.) This 
option can lead to an awkward wrap, however, because InDesign won’t 
try to make the text align precisely to the wrap’s contour (because the 
text isn’t justified). Use this option to justify the text just around the 
wrap and then continue using the text’s specified nonjustified alignment.
 
 Skip by Leading: This option makes text wrap below or above an object 
based on the text’s leading so that you have at least a full line space 
between the text and the object, even if the object’s text-wrap settings 
would allow less space.
 
 Text Wrap Only Affects Text Beneath: This option, if selected, pre-
vents text frames placed on top of an object from wrapping, while those 
behind the graphic frame will still be allowed to wrap. This option allows 
some text to overlap the graphic and other text to wrap around it. Note 
that this setting is global, affecting all objects. To override wrap settings 
of individual text frames, choose Object➪Text Frame Options (Ô+B or 
Ctrl+B) and enable the Ignore Text Wrap option in the General pane.

Chapter 12
The Ins and Outs of Tex t Editing
In This Chapter
 Editing text in your layout
 Searching and replacing words and formats
 Checking spelling as you type or all at once
 Customizing the spelling and hyphenation dictionaries
W
hether you import text or type it into text frames directly in InDesign, 
you’ll appreciate the tools that let you edit, search and replace, spell-
check, and hyphenate your text. You can find out all about these capabilities 
in this chapter.
Editing Text
InDesign offers basic editing capabilities, not unlike those found in a word 
processor: cutting and pasting, deleting and inserting text, searching and 
replacing of text and text attributes, and spell-checking. (Cutting, pasting, 
inserting, and deleting text works just like it does for any standard Mac or 
Windows program, so I don’t repeat those details for you here.)
To do anything with text, you need to use the Type tool. When the Type tool 
is selected, you can click in any empty frame. (If it’s not already a text frame, 
it becomes one automatically when you click it with the Type tool.) Or you 
can click and drag to create a new text frame. You can even click in an exist-
ing block of text. From this point, start typing to enter text.
Chapter 7 gets into more of the nitty-gritty of creating frames. And you can 
discover all about importing text in Chapter 11.

214
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Controlling text view
In many layout views, the text is too small to work with. Generally, you zoom 
in around the block of text using the Zoom tool. Select the tool and then click 
to zoom in. To zoom out, hold the Option or Alt key when clicking.
Another way to zoom in is to use the keyboard shortcut Ô+= or Ctrl+=. Each 
time you use it, the magnification increases. (Zoom out via Ô+– or Ctrl+–.)
In addition to seeing the text larger, zooming in also helps you see 
the spaces, tabs, and paragraph returns that exist in the text. Choose 
Type➪Show Hidden Characters (Option+Ô+I or Ctrl+Alt+I) to have the non-
printing indicators for those characters display. You can also use the Show 
Options iconic pop-up menu in the application bar to access this command, 
as Chapter 1 explains.
Navigating through text
To work at a different text location in your InDesign document, click in a dif-
ferent text frame or another location in the current text frame. You can also 
use the four arrow (cursor) keys on the keyboard to move one character 
to the right, one character to the left, one line up, or one line down. Hold Ô 
or Ctrl when pressing the arrow keys to jump one word to the right or left, 
or one paragraph up or down. The Home and End keys let you jump to the 
beginning or end of a line; hold Ô or Ctrl when pressing those keys to jump 
to the beginning or end of a story. (A story is text within a text frame or that is 
linked across several text frames.)
Highlighting text
To highlight (or select) text, you can click and drag. Or you can use some 
keyboard options. For example, Shift+Ô+→ or Ctrl+Shift+→ highlights the 
next word to the right. Likewise, Shift+Ô+End or Ctrl+Shift+End highlights all 
the text to the end of the story.
To highlight a word, double-click (this action doesn’t select its punctuation) 
and triple-click to select the entire paragraph. If you’re highlighting a word and 
also want to include the punctuation that follows the word, double-click, and 
then press Shift+Ô+→ or Ctrl+Shift+→ to extend the selection.
To select an entire story, choose Edit➪Select All (Ô+A or Ctrl+A).
To deselect text, choose Edit➪Deselect All (Shift+Ô+A or Ctrl+Shift+A). An 
even easier way to deselect text is simply to select another tool or click 
another area of the page.

215
 Chapter 12: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing
Undoing text edits
InDesign makes it easy for you to change your mind about text edits. Choose 
Edit➪Undo (Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z) and Edit➪Redo (Shift+Ô+Z or Ctrl+Shift+Z) any 
time you change your mind about edits.
Using the Story Editor
The Story Editor is a window that lets you see your text without the distrac-
tions of your layout. In it, you see your text without line breaks or other non-
essential formatting — you just see attributes like boldface and italics, as well 
as the names of the paragraph styles applied in a separate pane to the left 
(see Figure 12-1). After clicking in a text frame, you open the Story Editor by 
choosing Edit➪Edit in Story Editor (Ô+Y or Ctrl+Y).
 
Figure 12-1: 
The Story 
Editor.
 

216
Part IV: Text Essentials 
In the Story Editor, you use the same tools for selection, deletion, copy-
ing, pasting, and search and replace as you would in your layout. The Story 
Editor isn’t a separate word processor; it’s simply a way to look at your text 
in a less distracting environment for those times when your mental focus is 
on the meaning and words, not the text appearance.
The Story Editor also shows you the column depth for text, using a ruler 
along the left side of the text, just to the right of the list of currently applied 
paragraph styles. Overset text (text that goes beyond the text frame or 
beyond the final text frame in a threaded story) is indicated by the word 
Overset and is furthermore noted with a red line to the right of the text.
 
You can dock the Story Editor window into the document tabs so that you 
can more easily switch in and out of it as needed. Just drag the Story Editor 
window into the tabs, and InDesign converts it for you. Drag it back out to 
make it a floating window.
Searching and Replacing Text
InDesign has a handy Find/Change feature (Edit➪Find/Change [Ô+F or 
Ctrl+F]) that is similar to the search-and-replace features with which you may 
already be familiar if you’ve used any word processor or page-layout applica-
tion. With the Find/Change dialog box, you can find and change text, or you 
can extend the search to include attributes. Before starting a Find/Change 
operation, first determine the scope of your search:
 
 To search within a text selection, highlight the selection.
 
 To search from one point in a story to its end, click the cursor at that 
beginning location.
 
 To search an entire story, select any frame or click at any point in a 
frame containing the story.
 
 To search an entire document, simply have that document open.
 
 To search multiple documents, open all of them (and close any that you 
don’t want to search).
Then choose the appropriate search scope — InDesign’s term for range — 
using the Search pop-up menu and the scope iconic buttons below it.
Figure 12-2 shows the Find/Change dialog box. It can search for much more 
than just text, including special characters (glyphs) and object attributes (see 
Chapter 8), plus it lets you save search/replace queries so you can use them 
repeatedly. (It also lets you use the Unix grep syntax for conducting criteria-
based searches; this feature is for experts familiar with grep searching and so 
is not covered in this book.)

Replacing text
To search for text, follow these steps:
 
1. Determine the scope of your search, open the appropriate documents, 
and insert the text cursor at the appropriate location.
 
2. Choose Edit➪Find/Change (Ô+F or Ctrl+F).
 
 Go to the Text pane if it’s not already displayed.
 
3. Use the Search pop-up menu, as shown in Figure 12-2, to specify the 
scope of your search by choosing All Documents, Document, Story, To 
End of Story, or Selection.
 
 Note that the Search options that display are based on what you’ve 
selected before going to the Find/Change dialog box. For example, if you 
didn’t select text, there’ll be no Selection option. Likewise, if no story is 
selected, the Story and To End of Story options won’t appear.
 
4. Type or paste the text you want to find in the Find What field.
 
 To use special characters, use the Special Characters for Search pop-up 
list (the icon to the right of the Find What field) to select from a menu of 
special characters (see Figure 12-2).
 
5. Type or paste the replacement text into the Change To field.
 
 To use special characters, use the Special Characters for Replace pop-up 
list (to the right of the Find What field).
 
6. Specify any additional parameters for your search by selecting 
or deselecting the seven iconic buttons at the bottom of the pane: 
Include Locked Layers, Include Locked Stories, Include Hidden 
Layers, Include Master Pages, Include Footnotes, Case Sensitive, and 
Whole Word.

218
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 If an icon’s background darkens, it’s selected.
 
7. To search for or replace with specific formatting, use the Find Format 
and Replace Format areas.
 
 If the Find Format and Replace Format areas don’t display in the dialog 
box, click the More Options button. (Look for details in the “Replacing 
formatting” section that comes next.)
 
8. Click the Find button to start the search.
 
 After the search has begun, click the Find Next button (it changes from 
the Find button after you start the search) to skip instances of the Find 
What text and click the Change, Change All, or Change/Find buttons as 
appropriate. (Clicking the Change button simply changes the found text, 
clicking the Change All button changes every instance of that found text 
in your selection or story, and clicking the Change/Find button changes 
the current found text and moves on to the next occurrence of it — it basi-
cally does in one click the actions of clicking Change and then Find Next.)
 
 If you use the Change All feature, InDesign reports how many changes 
were made. If the number looks extraordinarily high and you suspect the 
Find/Change operation wasn’t quite what you wanted, remember that 
you can use InDesign’s undo function (Edit➪Undo [Ô+Z or Ctrl+Z]) to 
cancel the search and replace and then try a different replace strategy.
 
9. Click the Done button when you’re finished doing the finding and 
replacing.
Replacing formatting
To find and change formatting or text with specific formatting, use the 
expanded Find/Change dialog box. For example, you can find all the words in 
14-point Futura Extra Bold and change them to 12-point Bodoni.
The expanded dialog box contains two areas where you specify the format-
ting to search and change: Find Format and Replace Format. If these aren’t 
visible in the Find/Change dialog box, click the More Options button.
To replace text formatting, follow these steps:
 
1. Use Specify Attributes to Find iconic button (the magnifying-glass-
over-a-T icon) to open the Find Format Settings dialog box. (It’s to the 
right of the Find Format area.)
 
 In the Find Format Settings dialog box, your options are Style Options (para-
graph and character styles), Basic Character Formats, Advanced Character 
Formats, Indents and Spacing, Keep Options, Bullets and Numbering, 
Character Color, OpenType Features, Underline Options, Strikethrough 
Options, Conditions, and Drop Caps and Other. You can change multiple 
attributes at once by making selections from as many panes as needed.

219
 Chapter 12: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing
 
 Go to each pane whose formatting you want to find and select the 
desired formatting to search. Click OK when done; InDesign will bring 
you back to the Find/Change dialog box.
 
2. Use the Specify Attributes to Change iconic button (the magnifying-
glass-over-a-T icon) to open the Change Format Settings dialog box. 
(It’s to the right of the Replace Format area.)
 
 The options in the Change Format Settings dialog box are the same as in 
the Find Format settings dialog box. Go to each pane whose formatting 
you want to change and select the desired formatting to replace. Click 
OK when done; InDesign returns you to the Find/Change dialog box.
 
3. Click Find Next and then Change to change the next occurrence or 
click Change All to change all occurrences.
 
4. Click Done when you’re finished with the search and replace.
 
To search and replace formatting only — regardless of the text to which it is 
applied — leave the Find What and Change To fields blank.
Changing special characters
InDesign also lets you replace special characters (glyphs) through a separate 
Glyph pane in the Find/Change dialog box, shown in Figure 12-3. The Glyphs 
pane makes it easier to actually enter the desired characters than using the 
Text pane. The process is mostly straightforward (just ignore the parts of the 
pane not described in the following steps):
 
1. In the Find Glyph section, choose the font of the desired character 
in the Font Family pop-up menu and its style in the Font Style pop-up 
menu.
 
2. To choose the character itself, click the unnamed pop-up menu to the 
right of the Glyph field.
 
 You get a dialog box that mimics the Glyphs panel (see Chapter 15); 
choose the character from the panel by double-clicking it.
 
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2 using the controls in the Change Glyph section to 
select the replacement glyph.
 
4. Set the scope of your search using the Search pop-up menu and the 
Include Locked Layers, Include Locked Stories, Include Hidden 
Layers, Include Master Pages, and Include Footnotes buttons, as 
described in the “Replacing text” section, earlier in this chapter.
 
5. Execute the search and/or replace using the Find, Change, Change All, 
and Change/Find buttons as described in the “Replacing text” section.
 
6. Click Done when done.

If you want to quickly wipe out the selected glyphs, click the Clear Glyphs 
button.
Working with saved queries
If you plan to do the same search and/or replace operation repeatedly, you 
can save queries in InDesign. After entering the find and search information, 
click the Save Query iconic button, enter a name in the Save Query dialog 
box that appears, and click OK. That query now appears in the Query pop-up 
menu in the Find/Change dialog box.
To run a saved query, just choose it from the Query pop-up menu. (You’ll see 
those that you saved plus some that came preinstalled with InDesign.) To 
delete a saved query, choose it from the Query pop-up menu and then click 
Delete Query iconic button.
That’s all there is to it!
Checking Spelling
The spell-check feature not only helps you eradicate spelling errors, but 
it also catches repeated words, as well as words with odd capitalization, 
such as internal capitalization (called intercaps) in words such as InDesign. 
InDesign also flags words not found in the spelling dictionary. You can 
customize the spelling dictionary, and you can purchase additional spelling 
dictionaries.

221
 Chapter 12: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing
Checking spelling as you type
You can have InDesign check your spelling as you type by simply choosing 
Edit➪Spelling➪Dynamic Spelling. If that menu option is checked, your spell-
ing will be checked as you type, as will the spelling of any text already in the 
document. Suspected errors are highlighted with red squiggle underlining so 
that you can correct them as needed. If you want InDesign to suggest proper 
spelling, you need to use the Check Spelling dialog box, covered in the next 
section.
Correcting mistakes on the fly
If you use a word processor, chances are it’s one that corrects mistakes as 
you type. Microsoft Word, for example, has a feature called AutoCorrect 
that lets you specify corrections to be made as you type, whether those 
be common typos you make or the expansion of abbreviations to their full 
words (such as having Word replace tq with thank you).
InDesign offers much of the same functionality, which it calls Autocorrect. 
Unlike Word, you can’t use this feature to replace symbols, such as having 
InDesign convert (R) to the ® symbol as you type. Note that — like Word — 
Autocorrect works only for text entered in InDesign after Autocorrect is turned 
on; it doesn’t correct imported or previously typed text.
The solution to missing fonts
Sometimes, when you open a document, 
InDesign tells you that it can’t find the fonts 
used in the documents on your computer. You 
get the option of finding the missing fonts, which 
opens the Find Fonts dialog box. (You can also 
open it after opening a document by choosing 
Type➪Find Font.) This dialog box shows the 
names of all missing fonts; if you select one, you 
can change all occurrences of that font to one 
that you do have by selecting a new font family 
and font style from the menus at the bottom of 
the dialog box and then clicking Change All. If 
selected, the Redefine Style When Changing 
All check box ensures that any font replaced is 
also replaced in any paragraph and character 
styles that used the original font.
Of course, another — often preferable — 
solution is to get the fonts installed on your com-
puter. After all, the design shouldn’t change just 
because you don’t happen to have the needed 
fonts on your computer.

222
Part IV: Text Essentials 
You enable Autocorrect in the Autocorrect pane of the Preferences dialog 
box. Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Autocorrect (Ô+K) on the Mac or 
choose Edit➪Preferences➪Autocorrect (Ctrl+K) in Windows. If you want 
InDesign to automatically fix capitalization errors, check the Autocorrect 
Capitalization Errors check box. Typically, this feature finds typos involving 
capitalizing the second letter of a word in addition to the first. For example, 
InDesign replaces FOrmat with Format.
To add your own custom corrections, click the Add button. You see the Add 
to Autocorrect List dialog box, where you can enter the typo text or code 
that you want InDesign to be alert for in the Misspelled Word field, as well 
as the corrected or expanded text you want InDesign to substitute in the 
Correction field.
 
You can’t use special characters in autocorrect, such as to automatically 
replace two hyphens (--) with an em dash (—).
Using the Check Spelling dialog box
The Check Spelling dialog box not only lets you choose what part of the 
document to spell-check, but it also provides suggestions on correct spelling. 
Plus, you can use the dialog box to add correctly spelled words to InDesign’s 
spelling dictionary. Even if you use the new dynamic spell-checking feature, 
you’ll still want to do a final spell-checking pass with the Check Spelling 
dialog box.
Specifying the text to check is a two-step process: First set up the spell-
check’s scope in the document (in other words, exactly what text you want 
to be checked). Second, specify the scope in the Search menu. Here’s how:
 
1. To set up the scope for the spell-check, highlight text, click in a story 
to check from the cursor forward, select a frame containing a story, or 
open multiple documents.
 
2. Open the Check Spelling dialog box (Edit➪Spelling➪Check Spelling 
[Ô+I or Ctrl+I]) and choose an option from the Search pop-up menu: 
Document, All Documents, Story, To End of Story, and Selection.
 
 Figure 12-4 shows the dialog box.
 
 You may not see all the options in the Search pop-up menu; the list 
of options depends on how you set up the scope. For example, if you 
didn’t highlight text, the Selection option isn’t available. However, you 
can change the scope setup in the document while the Check Spelling 
dialog box is open — for example, you can open additional documents 
to check. You can also make the spell-check case-sensitive by checking 
the Case Sensitive check box.

223
 Chapter 12: The Ins and Outs of Text Editing
 
Figure 12-4: 
In the Check 
Spelling 
dialog box, 
use the 
Search pop-
up menu 
to specify 
which text 
to spell-
check.
 
 
 Note that when you first open the Check Spelling dialog box, if text is 
selected or the text cursor is active, it immediately begins checking the 
spelling, going to the first suspect word. Otherwise, the dialog box dis-
plays Ready to Check Spelling at the top.
 
3. To begin checking the text, click Start.
 
4. As InDesign finds suspect words and phrases, it displays that text to 
you and provide several options to fix them.
 
 When the spell checker encounters a word without a match in the dic-
tionary or a possible capitalization problem, the dialog box displays Not 
in Dictionary at the top and shows the word. When the spell checker 
encounters a duplicate word, such as of of, the dialog box displays 
Duplicate Word and shows which word is duplicated. Use the buttons 
along the right side of the dialog box to handle flagged words as follows:
 
• Click the Skip button (it appears only after the spell-check has 
started) to leave the current instance of a Not in Dictionary word 
or Duplicate Word unchanged. To leave all instances of the same 
problem unchanged, click the Ignore All button.
 
• To change the spelling of a Not in Dictionary word, click a word 
in the Suggested Corrections list or edit the spelling or capitaliza-
tion in the Change To field. To make the change, click the Change 
button.
 
• To correct an instance of a Duplicate Word, edit the text in the 
Change To field, and then click the Change button.
 
• To change all occurrences of a Not in Dictionary word or a 
Duplicate Word to the information in the Change To field, click the 
Change All button.

224
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
• To add a word flagged as incorrect — but that you know is correct — 
to InDesign’s spelling dictionary, click the Add button. (If you have 
multiple dictionaries, first choose the dictionary to add it to using 
the Add To pop-up menu.)
 
• To add a word flagged as incorrect to a specific dictionary, click 
the Dictionary button. A Dictionary dialog box appears, which lets 
you choose the dictionary to which you want to add the word, as 
well as what language to associate it with.
 
5. After you finish checking spelling, click the Done button to close the 
Check Spelling dialog box.
Changing the spelling and 
hyphenation dictionaries
The spelling dictionary that comes with InDesign is pretty extensive, but 
you’ll likely need to add words to it. For example, your company may use 
words that are company-specific terms. Or you may use some product 
or individuals’ names that wouldn’t typically be found in the dictionary. 
Additionally, you may have some words that you prefer not to hyphenate or 
others that you want to hyphenate in a specific manner. To address these 
issues, you can customize InDesign’s spelling and hyphenation dictionar-
ies. InDesign handles both spelling and hyphenation in one dictionary for 
each language so that you use the same controls to modify both spelling and 
hyphenation.
 
If you’re in a workgroup, be sure to share the edited dictionary file so that 
everyone is using the same spelling and hyphenation settings. (The file 
is located in the Dictionaries folder inside the Plug-ins folder inside your 
InDesign folder.) You can copy it for other users, who must then restart 
InDesign or press Option+Ô+/ or Ctrl+Alt+/ to reflow the text according to the 
new dictionary’s hyphenation.
Customizing the spelling dictionary
When you add a word to the spelling dictionary, this word won’t be flagged 
any more when you check spelling.
When you add words to the dictionary, you can specify their capitalization. 
For example, InDesign’s dictionary prefers E-mail. You can add e-mail if you 
prefer a lowercase e or email if you prefer to skip the hyphen. To add words 
to the dictionary, follow these steps:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Dictionary.
 
 The Dictionary dialog box, shown in Figure 12-5, appears.

4. Type or paste a word in the Word field.
 
 The word can have capital letters if appropriate, and it can include spe-
cial characters, such as accents and hyphens.
 
5. To have the added word accepted as being spelled correctly only with 
the capitalization specified in the Word field, check the Case Sensitive 
check box.
 
6. To edit the hyphenation of the word, click the Hyphenate button.
 
 I cover hyphenation in the next section.
 
7. Click the Add button.
 
8. To import a word list or export one for other users to import into their 
copies of InDesign, click the Import or Export button.
 
 You then navigate to a folder and choose a filename in a dialog box. Note 
that when you click the Export button, InDesign exports all selected 
words from the list. If no words are selected, it exports all the words in 
the list.

226
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
9. When you’re finished adding words, click the Done button.
To delete a word that you added to the dictionary, select it in the list and 
click the Remove button. To change the spelling of a word you added, 
delete it and then re-add it with the correct spelling. You can see all deleted 
words — just those deleted since you opened the dialog box — by selecting 
Removed Words from the Dictionary List pop-up menu so that you can add 
back any deleted by error.
Customizing hyphenation points
People can be particular about how to hyphenate words. Fortunately, 
InDesign lets you modify the hyphenation dictionary by specifying new, hier-
archical hyphenation points.
Follow these steps to specify hyphenation points:
 
1. Choose Edit➪Spelling➪Dictionary.
 
2. In the Language pop-up menu, pick the dictionary that you want to 
edit.
 
3. Type or paste the word in the Word field.
 
 You can also double-click a word in the list.
 
4. To see InDesign’s suggestions for hyphenating the word, click the 
Hyphenate button.
 
 If you want to change the hyphenation, continue on to Step 5.
 
5. Type a tilde (~, obtained by pressing Shift+`, the open single keyboard 
quote at the upper left of the keyboard) as your first preference for a 
hyphenation point in the word.
 
 If you don’t want the word to hyphenate at all, type a tilde in front of it.
 
6. To indicate an order of preference, use two tildes for your second 
choice, three tildes for your third choice, and so on.
 
 InDesign first tries to hyphenate your top preferences (single tildes), 
and then it tries your second choices if the first ones don’t work out, 
and so on.
 
7. Click the Add button.
 
8. Continue to add words until you’re finished.
 
9. Click the Done button.
To revert a word to the default hyphenation, select it in the list and click the 
Remove button. To change the hyphenation, double-click a word in the list 
to enter it in the Word field, change the tildes and then click the Add button. 
When you’re adding variations of words, you can double-click a word in the 
list to place it in the Word field as a starting place.

t’s the dirty secret of desktop publishing: Most users avoid using styles, 
even though they know they should. Instead, they apply formatting locally 
to text, hoping it’s the same as a few pages back. It’s a lot like not eating your 
vegetables: Even though you know that they’re good for you (and they even 
taste good), it’s easier to get something already made, never mind what’s in it.
So, I’m going to tell you about styles before I get to the other ways to format 
text. Styles really are good for you: They save you lots of work, help you 
avoid embarrassingly inconsistent formatting, and give you more time to 
indulge in the guilty pleasure of local formatting.
I cover the particulars of paragraph and character formatting in Chapters 
14 and 15, respectively. The formats themselves are the same whether you 
apply them directly (locally) or through a style (globally). I cover table styles 
and cell styles in Chapter 19 and object styles in Chapter 9, although the 
basic creation and management methods are the same for all styles.
 
Text in your layout may already have styles applied, using styles defined in 
Microsoft Word, as Chapter 11 explains.
Creating Styles
A style is a simple but powerful concept: It’s a collection of formatting attri-
butes that you can apply to text all at once, saving you time. Even better, if 
you change the style, all text that uses it is automatically updated, saving you 
time and ensuring consistency. That’s got to be appealing!

228
Part IV: Text Essentials 
InDesign gives you two kinds of styles for text: paragraph and character. 
Paragraph styles apply formatting to entire paragraphs, while character 
styles apply formatting to text selections. Unless you’re doing a one-page ad, 
the formatting of which won’t be repeated, you should have paragraph styles 
for all different types of paragraphs in your layout. You also need character 
styles for places where you consistently want to override your paragraph 
styles, such as for the lead-in of a bulleted paragraph that may have the first 
few words in a different font or color.
Whether you’re creating styles for paragraphs or characters, the basic pro-
cess is the same. (They’re also pretty much the same for object styles, cov-
ered in Chapter 9, and for table styles and cell styles, covered in Chapter 19.)
The easiest way is to format your text using the Paragraph and Character 
panels, as described in Chapters 14 and 15, and then make sure that you’ve 
selected the text you want to use as the model for your new style. Next, 
create the appropriate type of new style:
 
 For paragraph styles, open the Paragraph Styles panel by choos-
ing Type➪Paragraph Styles (Ô+F11 or Ctrl+F11). Then choose New 
Paragraph Style from the flyout menu to open the New Paragraph Style 
dialog box, shown in Figure 13-1.
 
Figure 13-1: 
The New 
Paragraph 
Style 
dialog box’s 
General 
pane.
 

229
 Chapter 13: The Styles of Text
 
 For character styles, open the Character Styles panel by choosing 
Type➪Character Styles (Shift+Ô+F11 or Ctrl+Shift+F11). Then choose 
New Character Style from the flyout menu to open the New Character 
Style dialog box, shown in Figure 13-2.
 
Figure 13-2: 
The New 
Character 
Style dia-
log box’s 
General 
pane.
 
In both cases, the style picks up the selected text’s formatting. Adjust the 
style further if desired, give the style a name using the Style Name field in the 
General pane, and then click OK.
Of course, you can specify all the formatting directly in the new-style dialog 
boxes rather than having InDesign pick it up from existing text. Create the 
new styles as just described and then go through each of the panes (selecting 
each from the list at the left of the dialog box) and choose your settings.
In the General pane of the New Paragraph Style and New Character Style 
dialog boxes are several controls that make styles work more intelligently:
 
 The Based On pop-up menu displays the names of other styles. You use 
this feature to create families of styles. Thus, if you change a style that 
other styles are based on, all those styles are updated with the new 
settings.
 
 In the Shortcut field, hold down any combination of Ô, Option, and Shift 
(or Ctrl, Alt, and Shift) and press any number on the keypad. (You can’t 
use letters, punctuation, and nonkeypad numbers for keyboard short-
cuts, and Windows users need to make sure that Num Lock is on.)
 
 If you want to apply a new style to text that is selected, be sure to check 
the Apply Style to Selection check box before clicking OK to save the 
new style.

230
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
InDesign comes with a predefined default paragraph style called [Basic 
Paragraph] that text in a new frame automatically has applied to it. You can 
edit [Basic Paragraph] like any other style. Similarly, InDesign offers a pre-
defined character style called [Basic Character]. (Style names that include 
surrounding brackets mean you can’t delete the styles, even though you can 
modify them.)
You need to keep in mind several things when creating paragraph styles. 
(Character styles are pretty straightforward, so I’m not presenting a similar 
list for them.)
 
 To have InDesign automatically apply a different style to the next para-
graph when you type text, choose a style name from the Next Style 
pop-up menu while defining a style. For example, when you define a 
style named Headline, you can choose Byline as the next style, so after 
you type in a headline, the next paragraph will be formatted for a byline. 
Obviously, you need to have the Byline style available.
 
 If you want your paragraph style to use a character style, you must 
define that character style first. (Drop caps and nested styles use 
character styles.)
Getting Fancy with Nested Styles
A special function available only in paragraph styles is something called a 
nested style. Basically, a nested style is a way of applying a series of character 
styles within a paragraph style based on a set of parameters you specify. For 
example, in a numbered list, you might want one character style applied to 
the numeral, and another to the first sentence, and then have the paragraph 
style’s text formatting applied to the rest of the paragraph. With nested 
styles, you build all that into the paragraph style and let InDesign do the 
heavy lifting. Here’s how it works:
 
1. Define any character styles that you’ll apply to text through a nested 
style.
 
 Even if all you’re doing is making text italic, you need to define a charac-
ter style to do so. The Nested Styles feature can’t apply any attributes 
other than those available in a character style.
 
2. Open the Paragraph panel (Type➪Paragraph Styles [Ô+F11 or 
Ctrl+F11]), choose Style Options from the flyout menu to open the 
Paragraph Style Options dialog box, and go to the Drop Caps and 
Nested Styles pane.

231
 Chapter 13: The Styles of Text
 
3. Click New Nested Style.
 
 An entry appears in the Nested Styles section of the dialog box. This 
entry is what will be applied to text.
 
4. Click the style name in the Nested Styles section of the pane to choose 
from an existing character style.
 
 When you click the style name, a list of other styles appears, including 
[None], which uses the paragraph style’s default formatting.
 
 You also have the [Repeat] option, which, if selected, lets you repeat a 
sequence of previous styles. (You choose the number of repetitions in 
the third column.)
 
5. Click in the second column to determine the scope end point.
 
 Your choices are Through or Up To. For example, if you choose Through 
for a nested style that is set for four words, all four words will get the 
nested style. If you choose Up To, the first three words will get the style, 
and the fourth will not.
 
6. In the third column, specify how many items you want InDesign to 
count in determining the scope’s end point.
 
 For example, if you want to have the first seven characters have the 
style applied, choose 7. If you want to have the style applied up to the 
first tab, choose 1.
 
7. Click the item in the fourth column to specify the scope of text to 
which you’re applying the nested styles.
 
 Figure 13-3 shows the options. They break into three groups: a number 
of items (characters, words, and so on), a specific character (tab, em 
space, and so on), and a specific marker character (inline graphic 
marker, auto page number, and section marker). Whatever you choose 
needs to be consistent in all your text because InDesign will follow these 
rules slavishly.
 
8. Create multiple nested styles in one paragraph with different rules for 
each.
 
 Obviously, you may not need to do this step, but the option exists. 
InDesign applies the styles in the order in which they appear in the 
dialog box, and each starts where the other ends. Use the up and down 
arrow buttons to change the order of nested styles.
 
9. Select the Preview option to preview the formatting if you selected 
sample text before opening the dialog box.
 
10. Click OK when you’re done.

232

You can use 
a nested

example,

character 
style to the 
two first 
words in a

At the bottom of the Nested Styles dialog box is a new feature: nested line 
styles. It works just like other nested styles except that it lets you apply a 
character style to a certain number of lines in a paragraph — a popular design 
approach, such as having the first line in small caps. You specify the desired 
character style and how many lines you want it applied to, and InDesign does 
the rest.
Managing Styles
InDesign provides lots of ways to manage your styles. In this section, I cover 
the common ones. Note that the options described here also apply to object 
styles, table styles, and cell styles — so, for example, the Load Paragraph 
Styles menu option will have a counterpart in the Object Styles, Table Styles, 
and Cell Styles panels’ flyout menus.
Updating styles
If you’ve already created a style and want to change it, just go to the appro-
priate styles panel and choose Style Options from its flyout menu. If you’ve 
selected text that has the formatting you want the style to use in place of 
its current formatting, just choose Redefine Style from the flyout menu. 
Remember that all text using the style is automatically updated when the 
style changes.

233
 Chapter 13: The Styles of Text
Sharing styles with others
The Load Paragraph Styles or Load Character Styles menu option (based on 
which styles panel is open) and the Load All Text Styles menu option let you 
import styles from another InDesign document. (Load All Text Styles imports 
paragraph and character styles at the same time.) You get a dialog box list-
ing the styles in the chosen document so that you can decide which ones to 
import.
If you import styles whose names match those in the current document, 
InDesign gives you a chance to let the imported style overwrite the current 
style or to leave the current style as is and give the imported style a new 
name. If an entry appears in the Conflict with Existing Style, you can click that 
entry for a pop-up menu that provides two choices: Auto-Rename and Use 
Incoming Style Definition. Figure 13-4 shows this Load Styles dialog box.
Note that at the bottom of the dialog box is the Incoming Style Definitions 
window, which lists the style definitions to help you decide which to import, 
as well as which to overwrite or rename.
 
Figure 13-4: 
The Load 
Styles 
dialog box.
 
Using style groups
To help you find the desired style in documents that have dozens of them, 
InDesign lets you create style groups, which create a folder in the styles 
panel’s style list that you can open and close as desired. To create a group, 
choose New Style Group from the panel’s flyout menu or click the Create New 
Style Group iconic button (folder icon) on the bottom of the panel. Enter a 
name in the dialog box that appears and click OK.

234
Part IV: Text Essentials 
When working with style groups (which have a folder icon to the left of their 
names in the panel list), you have several options to add styles:
 
 You can drag any desired styles into the group.
 
 You can copy a selected style to the group by choosing Copy to Group 
and then selecting the target group in the dialog box that appears.
 
 If multiple styles are selected, you can create a group and move them into 
it in one fell swoop by choosing New Group from Styles in the flyout menu. 
(Note that this option is grayed out if any of the predefined styles — [None] 
and either [Basic Paragraph] or [Basic Character] — are selected.)
 
To quickly open all groups, choose Open All Groups in the panel’s flyout 
menu. To quickly close them all, choose Close All Groups.
Other management options
The styles panels’ flyout menus have several other options to manage your 
styles:
 
 Duplicate Style copies the currently selected style so that you can work 
on the copy.
 
 Delete Style — no surprise! — deletes selected styles.
 
 Select All Unused selects all styles not used in the document so that you 
can delete them all at once with the Delete Style menu option — part of 
keeping your document neat and tidy.
 
 Sort by Name alphabetizes the list of style names. (You can change the 
order of style names by dragging them within the list.)
Applying Styles to Text
Applying paragraph styles and character styles have some subtle differences, 
so I cover those particulars in the following sections. But two techniques 
work the same for both types of style:
 
 If your text selection uses more than one paragraph style or more than 
one character style, the styles panel displays the text (Mixed) at the 
upper left to let you know.
 
 InDesign has a neat capability that lets you apply multiple styles at once 
to selected text:

235
 Chapter 13: The Styles of Text
 
1. Define the various styles and be sure that each style has a differ-
ent style selected in the Next Style pop-up menu in the Paragraph 
Style Options or New Paragraph Style dialog boxes. For example, if 
you have Headline, Byline, and Body Copy styles, make sure that 
Headline has Byline selected in Next Style and that Byline has Body 
Copy selected in Next Style. 
 
2. Highlight all the text that uses this sequence of styles. Now 
Control+click or right-click Headline and select Apply "Headline" 
Then Next Style from the contextual menu. InDesign applies 
Headline to the first paragraph, Byline to the second paragraph, 
and Body Copy to the rest.
 
 Remember that Headline is just the example style used here; the 
actual contextual menu option will replace Headline with the actual 
style name you select inside the quote marks.
Paragraph particulars
To apply a paragraph style, just click within a paragraph or highlight text in 
a range of paragraphs and then click the style name in the Paragraph Styles 
panel or press its keyboard shortcut. (Windows users must make sure that 
Num Lock is on when using shortcuts for styles.)
When you apply a style to selected paragraphs, all local formats and applied 
character styles are retained. All other formats are replaced by those of 
the applied style. If you want to override those attributes, choose Clear 
Overrides from the Paragraph Styles panel’s flyout menu or hold the Option 
or Alt key when clicking the style name in the panel.
If you want to remove a style from a paragraph so that it’s not changed if the 
style is later updated, choose Break Link to Style from the flyout menu. The 
upper left of the panel displays the text (No Style).
Character characteristics
To apply a character style, just highlight text and then click the style name 
in the Character Styles panel or press its keyboard shortcut. (Windows users 
must make sure that Num Lock is on when using shortcuts for styles.)
If you want to remove a style from a text selection so that it’s not changed if 
the character style is later updated, choose Break Link to Style from the 
flyout menu or simply apply the [None] style. Note that if you later apply a 
paragraph style to text with the [None] character style, the text takes on 
the paragraph style’s formatting rather than retaining its local formatting.

236
Part IV: Text Essentials 
What’s that Quick Apply panel?
Another way to apply paragraph and character 
styles (and object styles, scripts, menu com-
mands, and other elements) is by using the 
Quick Apply feature. Quick Apply is a consoli-
dated list of styles that you access by choosing 
Edit➪Quick Apply, by clicking the Quick Apply 
iconic button (the lightning-bolt icon) in many 
panels, or by pressing Ô+Return or Ctrl+Enter.
If you have selected text or have the text-
insertion point active, the Quick Apply panel 
presents all stored formatting attributes avail-
able. You can scroll down to the one you want, 
or you can type the first few letters of the style 
name in the text field at the top to jump to styles 
beginning with those letters and then navigate 
to the one you want. Then press Return or Enter, 
which brings you back to where you were 
working with your text. Pressing Ô+Return or 
Ctrl+Enter again closes the Quick Apply panel.
For users who are working on layouts from their 
keyboards — perhaps a layout artist who’s 
working on a notebook while commuting — 
Quick Apply can be handy because you can 
switch to it, apply the style, and return to your 
text without touching the mouse.
InDesign has tons of attributes in the Quick 
Apply panel, so it can quickly get overwhelm-
ing. To remove attributes you likely will never 
use in this panel — such as scripts and menu 
customizations — choose the unnamed pop-up 
menu at the top of the panel and deselect 
unwanted attributes. (The check marks indicate 
attributes that will display.) You can also choose 
what attributes display in the Quick Apply panel 
by choosing Customize from its flyout menu.

P
aragraphs are more than lines of text; they’re chunks of information that 
themselves help convey meaning by organizing that information into 
related bits. Various types of paragraph formatting let you both make those 
chunks clearly distinguishable from each other and highlight certain chunks, 
such as lists or long quotes, from others.
This chapter explains what you need to know about formatting paragraphs, 
from setting indents and alignment — the two most commonly used 
paragraph attributes — to more sophisticated tasks like adding bullets 
and ruling lines.
Applying Paragraph Formats
InDesign provides three ways to apply paragraph formats:
 
 Use the controls in the Paragraph panel, shown in Figure 14-1, or 
their keyboard shortcuts. This method is great for working on individual 
paragraphs, although it’s not the best method when working with 
lots of paragraphs you want to have the same formatting. You can open 
the Paragraph panel in three ways: Choose Type➪Paragraph, choose 
Window➪Type & Tables➪Paragraph, or press Option+Ô+T or 
Ctrl+Alt+T.

238
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 Use the controls in the Control panel. (Be sure that the Type tool is 
active and that the ¶ iconic button is selected in the panel to display 
paragraph-oriented functions.) These controls mirror those in the 
Paragraph panel, and using them instead of the Paragraph panel can 
reduce screen clutter. If the Control panel isn’t visible (it almost always 
is), display it by choosing Window➪Control (Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6).
 
 Create and apply paragraph styles, as covered in Chapter 13. Paragraph 
styles let you apply consistent formatting — and easily change it to all 
affected paragraphs — throughout your document.
Whichever method you use — and you’ll use them all — the types of 
formatting available to you are the same.
 
The Paragraph panel and Control panel provide access to most of InDesign’s 
paragraph-formatting options. Also, several of the options have keyboard 
shortcuts, as shown in the menus. But to set tabs, you must open the Tabs 
panel, as Chapter 19 covers.
Figure 14-1 shows the Paragraph panel. If you choose Hide Options from the 
flyout menu, the Space Before, Space After, Drop Cap Number of Lines, Drop 
Cap Number of Characters, Hyphenate, and Align/Do Not Align to Baseline 
Grid controls aren’t displayed. You can use the double-arrow iconic button to 
the left of the panel name to toggle among showing the panel title, the basic 
options, and all options.

 Chapter 14: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details
Specifying Alignment and Indents
Alignment and indents give paragraphs their fundamental appearance. 
Indentation helps readers visually separate paragraphs — the indent acts as 
the separator, like the blank lines used to separate paragraphs in typewritten 
documents — while alignment provides visual texture.
The alignment buttons at the top of the Paragraph panel control how a 
selected paragraph begins and ends relative to the left and right margins. 
To apply a paragraph alignment to selected paragraphs, click one of the 
buttons. You can also use the keyboard shortcuts described in the following 
list. Here’s a description of each alignment option (the icons themselves 
illustrate what they do):
 
 Align Left (Shift+Ô+L or Ctrl+Shift+L): This alignment places the left 
edge of every line at the left margin (the margin can be the frame 
edge, frame inset, left indent, or column edge) and fits as many words 
(or syllables, if the hyphenation is turned on) on the line as possible. 
In left-aligned paragraphs, the right margin is said to be ragged because 
the leftover space at the right end of each line differs from line to line 
and produces a ragged edge.
 
 Align Center (Shift+Ô+C or Ctrl+Shift+C): This alignment makes both 
the left and right edges of the paragraphs equally ragged.
 
 Align Right (Shift+Ô+R or Ctrl+Shift+R): This alignment is a mirror 
opposite of Align Left. The right edge is straight; the left edge is ragged.
 
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Left (Shift+Ô+J or Ctrl+Shift+J): In justified 
text, the left and right ends of each line are flush with the margins. 
(You can find out more about justification in the section “Controlling 
Hyphenation and Justification,” later in this chapter.) Justified text 
is nearly always hyphenated — if you don’t hyphenate justified text, 
spacing between letters and words is very inconsistent. Aligning the 
last line flush left is the traditional way of ending a paragraph.
 
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Center: This alignment produces justified text 
with the last line centered.
 
 Justify, Last Line Aligned Right: This alignment produces justified text 
with the last line aligned to the right.
 
 Justify All Lines (Shift+Ô+F or Ctrl+Shift+F): This alignment produces 
justified text with the last line forcibly justified. This option can 
produce last lines that are very widely spaced. The fewer the number 
of characters on the last line, the greater the spacing.
 
 The previous three alignment options are rarely used, and for good 
reason. People expect justified text to have the last line aligned left; the 
space at the end of the line marks the end of the paragraph. By changing 
the position of that last line, you can confuse your reader.

240
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 Align Toward Spine: Essentially, this option automatically creates right-
aligned text on left-hand pages and left-aligned text on right-hand pages. 
InDesign chooses a left or right alignment based on the location of the 
spine in a facing-pages document.
 
 Align Away from Spine: This option is the same as Align Toward Spine 
except that the alignment is reversed: Text aligns to the left on left-hand 
pages and to the right on right-hand pages.
 
When creating paragraph styles, all the preceding controls are available in the 
Indents and Spacing pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.
Adjusting indent controls
The indent controls in the Paragraph panel let you both move the edges of 
paragraphs away from the left and/or right margins and indent the first line.
Your options are as follows:
 
 Left Indent: Moves the left edge of selected paragraphs away from the 
left margin by the amount you specify in the field. You can also click the 
up and down arrows. Each click increases the value by 1 point; holding 
down the Shift key while clicking increases the increment to 1 pica.
 
 Right Indent: Moves the right edge of selected paragraphs away from 
the right margin by the amount you specify in the field. You can also use 
the up and down arrows.
 
 First-Line Left Indent: Moves the left edge of the first line of selected 
paragraphs away from the left margin by the amount you specify 
in the field. You can also click the up and down arrows to adjust the 
indentation. The value in the First-Line Left Indent field is added to 
any Left Indent value. Using a tab or spaces to indent the first line 
of a paragraph, which is what was done in the age of typewriters, is 
usually not a good idea. You’re better off specifying a First-Line 
Left Indent.
 
 Last-Line Right Indent: Moves the right edge of the last line of selected 
paragraphs away from the right margin by the amount you specify in 
the field. You can also click the up and down arrows.
 
When creating paragraph styles, all the preceding controls are available in the 
Indents and Spacing pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.

241
 Chapter 14: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details
Inserting space between paragraphs
To format a lengthy chunk of text with multiple paragraphs, you can indicate 
a new paragraph by indenting the paragraph’s first line (by specifying a First-
Line Left Indent value, as covered in the previous section, “Adjusting indent 
controls”). Or you can insert some extra space between the new paragraph 
and the preceding one. Although no rule states that you can’t use both of 
these spacing methods, it’s a good idea to use one or the other — not both:
 
 To insert space before selected paragraphs, enter a value in the Space 
Before field in the Paragraph panel or Control panel. You can also use 
the up and down arrow buttons; each click increases the value by 1 
point and holding down Shift key increases the increment to 1 pica.
 
 The Space After field works the same as the Space Before field but 
inserts space below selected paragraphs. If you use Space Before to 
space paragraphs, you won’t need to use Space After, and vice versa; 
combining both can be confusing.
 
What you don’t want to do is insert extra paragraph returns between 
paragraphs. Doing so makes it harder to ensure that columns begin with text 
(as opposed to blank lines).
Controlling space between lines
Leading (pronounced “ledding”) is the space between lines of text within a 
paragraph. Even though leading is traditionally an attribute of the paragraph, 
InDesign treats it as a character format, which you specify by using the 
Leading control in the Character panel or Control panel.
 
To change this character-oriented approach to affect entire paragraphs, 
select the Apply Leading to Entire Paragraphs option in the Type pane of the 
Preferences dialog box. (Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Type [Ô+K] on 
the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Type [Ctrl+K] in Windows.)
Another way to control space between lines of text is to use baseline grids, 
as described in Chapter 10. Essentially, a baseline grid overrides the leading 
specified for paragraphs — you choose whether it overrides the spacing of 
every line in the paragraph or just the first line. To align to baseline grids, 
you must click the Align to Baseline iconic button in the Paragraph panel 
(the rightmost iconic button on the bottom of the panel) for the selected 
paragraphs. To prevent such locking to the baseline, click the Do Not Align 
to Baseline iconic button to its immediate left. These same buttons also exist 
on the right side of the Control panel.

Part IV: Text Essentials 
Controlling where paragraphs break
InDesign’s Keep Options feature lets you prevent widows and orphans; it also 
lets you keep paragraphs together when they would otherwise be broken at 
the bottom of a column. A widow is the last line of a paragraph that falls at 
the top of a column. (The poor thing has been cut off from the rest of the 
family, the last survivor.) An orphan is the first line of a paragraph that falls 
at the bottom of a column. (It, too, has become separated from its family, the 
only survivor.)
When you choose Keep Options from the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu, the 
Keep Options dialog box, shown in Figure 14-2, appears.
 
Figure 14-2: 
The Keep 
Options 
dialog box.
 
The Keep Options dialog box holds several options for how paragraphs are 
managed as text breaks across columns and pages:
 
 Keep with Next Lines: This option applies to two consecutive para-
graphs and controls the number of lines of the second paragraph that 
must stay with the first paragraph if a column or page break occurs 
within the second paragraph.
 
 Keep Lines Together: If you click this check box, it prevents paragraphs 
from breaking. When this box is checked, the two radio buttons below it 
become available. The radio buttons present an either/or choice. One 
must be selected; At Start/End of Paragraph is selected by default.
 
 All Lines in Paragraph: This option prevents a paragraph from being 
broken at the end of a column or page. When a column or page break 
occurs within a paragraph to which this setting has been applied, the 
entire paragraph moves to the next column or page.
 
 At Start/End of Paragraph: Select this check box to control widows and 
orphans. When this button is selected, the two fields below it become 
available:

243
 Chapter 14: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details
 
• Start x Lines: This field controls orphans. The value you enter is 
the minimum number of lines at the beginning of a paragraph that 
must be placed at the bottom of a column when a paragraph is 
split by a column ending.
 
• End x Lines: This field controls widows. The value you enter is the 
minimum number of lines at the end of a paragraph that must be 
placed at the top of a column when a paragraph is split by a 
column ending.
 
 Start Paragraph: From this pop-up menu, choose Anywhere to let the 
paragraph begin where it would fall naturally in the sequence of text 
(no forced break). Choose In Next Column to force a paragraph to begin 
in the next column; choose In Next Frame to make it begin in the next 
frame in the story chain; choose On Next Page to force a paragraph to 
begin on the next page (such as for chapter headings). Your other 
choices are similar: On Next Odd Page and On Next Even Page.
 
When creating paragraph styles, all the preceding controls are available in the 
Keep Options pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.
Adding Drop Caps
Drop caps are enlarged capital letters that are often used to embellish 
paragraphs (usually the first paragraph of a chapter or story) and draw 
attention to paragraphs. In the Paragraph panel or Control panel, InDesign 
lets you specify the number of letters you want to include in a drop cap and 
the number of lines you want to drop them down into.
To add one or more drop caps to selected paragraphs, enter a number in the 
Drop Cap Number of Characters field in the Paragraph panel or Control 
panel. The number you enter determines how many characters in a selected 
paragraph will be made into drop caps. To specify the number of lines a drop 
cap will extend into a paragraph (and therefore the height of the drop cap), 
enter a number in the Drop Cap Number of Lines field.
After you create a drop cap, you can modify it by highlighting it and changing 
any of its character formats — font, size, color, and so on — by using the 
Character panel or Control panel, as well as other panes such as Stroke and 
Swatches. Even better: Apply a character style to it that has all the desired 
attributes stored in one place. Figure 14-3 shows two examples of drop caps.
 
When creating paragraph styles, the preceding controls are available in the 
Drop Caps and Nested Styles pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box. 
(See Chapter 13 for details on nested styles.)

Controlling Hyphenation 
and Justification
Hyphenation is the placement of hyphens between syllables in words that 
won’t fit at the end of a line of text. A hyphen is a signal to the reader that the 
word continues on the next line. InDesign gives you the option to turn para-
graph hyphenation on or off. If you choose to hyphenate, you can customize 
the settings that determine when and where hyphens are inserted.
Justification is the addition or removal of space between words and/or letters 
that produces the flush-left/flush-right appearance of justified paragraphs. 
InDesign’s justification controls let you specify how space is added or 
removed when paragraphs are justified. If you justify paragraphs, you almost 
certainly want to hyphenate them, too. If you opt for left-aligned paragraphs, 
whether to hyphenate is a personal choice.
InDesign offers both manual and automatic hyphenation.
Manual hyphenation
To break a particular word in a specific place, you can place a discretionary 
hyphen in the word. If the word doesn’t entirely fit at the end of a line in a 
hyphenated paragraph, InDesign uses the discretionary hyphen to split the 

245
 Chapter 14: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details
word if the part of the word before the hyphen fits on the line. To insert 
a discretionary hyphen, use the shortcut Shift+Ô+– or Ctrl+Shift+– (note the 
hyphen in the shortcuts) in the text where you want the hyphen to appear.
If a word has a discretionary hyphen, and hyphenation is necessary, InDesign 
breaks the word only at that point. But you can place multiple discretionary 
hyphens within a single word. If a word needs to be hyphenated, InDesign 
uses the hyphenation point that produces the best results.
 
You can prevent a particular word from being hyphenated either by placing 
a discretionary hyphen in front of the first letter or by highlighting the word 
and choosing No Break from the flyout menu of the Control panel or Character 
panel. (You need to select the A iconic button in the Control panel to get 
this option in its flyout menu.) But be careful: If you select more than a line’s 
width of text and apply No Break, InDesign doesn’t know what to do, and so it 
doesn’t display the rest of the story.
To prevent hyphenation for an entire paragraph, click anywhere inside 
of it and uncheck Hyphenate from the Paragraph panel or Control panel. 
(Be sure the ¶ button is selected in the Control panel.)
Automatic hyphenation
To have InDesign automatically hyphenate selected paragraphs, all you have 
to do is check the Hyphenate check box in the Paragraph panel or Control 
panel. (Remember that in the Paragraph panel, the Hyphenate check box 
appears only if you choose Show Options from the flyout menu.)
You can control how InDesign actually performs the hyphenation via the 
Hyphenation option in the flyout menu. When you choose Hyphenation, 
the Hyphenation Settings dialog box, shown in Figure 14-4, appears.
 
Figure 14-4: 
The 
Hyphenation 
Settings 
dialog box.
 

246
Part IV: Text Essentials 
The options in the Hyphenation Settings dialog box include
 
 Hyphenate: This option is a duplicate of the Hyphenate check box 
in the Paragraph panel and Control panel. If you didn’t check it before 
opening the Hyphenation Settings dialog box, you can check it here.
 
 Words with at Least x Letters: This spot is where you specify the 
number of letters in the shortest word you want to hyphenate.
 
 After First x Letters: In this field, enter the minimum number of 
characters that can precede a hyphen.
 
 Before Last x Letters: The number entered in this field determines the 
minimum number of characters that can follow a hyphen.
 
 Hyphen Limit: x Hyphens: In this field, you specify the number of 
consecutive lines that can be hyphenated. Several consecutive hyphens 
produce an awkward, ladder-like look, so consider entering a small 
number, such as 2 or 3, in this field.
 
 Hyphenation Zone: The entry in this field applies only to nonjustified 
text and only when the Adobe Single-Line Composer option is selected 
(in the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu). A hyphenation point must fall 
within the distance specified in this field in relation to the right margin 
in order to be used. Acceptable hyphenation points that don’t fall within 
the specified hyphenation zone are ignored. You can also use the Better 
Spacing/Fewer Hyphens slider below the field to pick a value rather than 
entering a value in the Hyphenation Zone field.
 
 Hyphenate Capitalized Words: If you check this box, InDesign hyphen-
ates, when necessary, capitalized words. If you don’t check this box, a 
capitalized word that would otherwise be hyphenated gets bumped to 
the next line, which may cause excessive spacing in the previous line.
 
 Hyphenate Last Word: Check this box to allow InDesign to break the 
last word in a paragraph. Otherwise, InDesign moves the entire word 
to the last line and spaces the preceding text as necessary. Many 
typographers believe hyphenating the last word in a paragraph looks 
bad, so it’s rare to enable this option.
 
 Hyphenate Across Column: Check this box to let text hyphenate at the 
end of a column. Many typographers believe hyphenating the word at 
the end of a column looks bad, so it’s also rare to enable this option.
 
When creating paragraph styles, all the preceding controls are available in the 
Hyphenation pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box — except for the 
composer setting, covered in the next sections.

247
 Chapter 14: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details
Controlling justification
To control how justification is achieved, you can
 
 Condense or expand the width of spaces between words.
 
 Add or remove space between letters.
 
 Condense or expand the width of characters.
The options in the Justification dialog box, shown in Figure 14-5, let you 
specify the degree to which InDesign adjusts normal word spaces, character 
spacing, and character width to achieve justification. Access this dialog 
box by choosing Justification in the flyout menu in the Control panel or in 
the Paragraph panel, or by pressing Option+Shift+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+J. 
When specifying values in the Justification dialog box, Minimum values 
must be smaller than Desired values, which in turn must be smaller than 
Maximum values.
 
Figure 14-5: 
The 
Justification 
dialog box.
 
The Justification dialog box lets you specify the following options:
 
 Word Spacing: Enter the percentage of a character that you want to use 
whenever possible in the Desired field. (The default value is 100%, which 
uses a font’s built-in width.) Enter the minimum acceptable percentage 
in the Minimum field; enter the maximum acceptable percentage in 
the Maximum field. The smallest value you can enter is 0%; the largest 
is 1000%.
 
 Letter Spacing: The default value of 0% in this field uses a font’s 
built-in letter spacing. In the Desired field, enter a positive value to add 
space (in increments of 1% of an en space) between all letter pairs; 
enter a negative value to remove space. Enter the minimum acceptable 
percentage in the Minimum field; enter the maximum acceptable 
percentage in the Maximum field.

248
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 Glyph Scaling: The default value of 100% uses a character’s normal 
width. In the Desired field, enter a positive value to expand all character 
widths; enter a negative value to condense character widths. Enter the 
minimum acceptable percentage in the Minimum field and the maximum 
acceptable percentage in the Maximum field. If you do apply glyph 
scaling, keep it to a range of 97 to 103 percent at most.
If you use the Adobe Paragraph Composer option (see the following section) 
for justified paragraphs, specifying a narrow range between minimum and 
maximum Word Spacing, Letter Spacing, and Glyph Scaling generally pro-
duces good-looking results. However, if you choose the Adobe Single-Line 
Composer option, a broader range between Minimum and Maximum gives 
the composer more leeway in spacing words and letters and hyphenating 
words and can produce better-looking results. The best way to find out what 
values work best is to experiment with several settings. Print hard copies and 
let your eyes decide which values produce the best results.
 
When creating paragraph styles, all the preceding controls are available in the 
Justification pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.
Composing text
The Paragraph panel’s flyout menu offers two options for implementing the 
hyphenation and justification settings you establish:
 
 Adobe Single-Line Composer: In single-line composition, hyphenation 
and justification settings are applied to each line in a paragraph, one line 
at a time. The effect of modifying the spacing of one line on the lines 
above and below it isn’t considered in single-line composition, so it can 
cause poor spacing.
 
 Adobe Paragraph Composer: InDesign’s Adobe Paragraph Composer 
is selected by default. It takes a broader approach to composition than 
the Adobe Single-Line Composer by looking at the entire paragraph at 
once. If a poorly spaced line can be fixed by adjusting the spacing of a 
previous line, the Adobe Paragraph Composer reflows the previous line.
 
 The Adobe Paragraph Composer is more sophisticated than the Single-
Line Composer, offering better overall spacing because it sacrifices 
optimal spacing a bit on one line to prevent really bad spacing on 
another, something the single-line method doesn’t do.
These options are also available in the Justification dialog box, covered in the 
previous section.

249
 Chapter 14: Fine-Tuning Paragraph Details
Ruling Your Paragraphs
If you want to place a horizontal line within text so that the line moves 
with the text when editing causes the text to reflow — an often effective 
highlighting device — you need to create a paragraph rule. A paragraph 
rule looks much like a line created with the line tool but behaves like a text 
character. Here’s how to create paragraph rules:
 
1. Select the paragraphs to which you want to apply a rule above and/or 
a rule below and then choose Paragraph Rules from the Paragraph 
panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menu.
 
 Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Option+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+J.
 
 You can also specify rules as part of a paragraph style. The Paragraph 
Rules dialog box, shown in Figure 14-6, is displayed.
 
Figure 14-6: 
The Para-
graph Rules 
dialog box.
 
 
2. Choose Rule Above or Rule Below and then click Rule On.
 
 To add rules both above and below, click Rule On for both options and 
specify their settings separately. To see the rule while you create it, 
select the Preview option.
 
3. Choose a predefined thickness from the Weight pop-up menu or enter 
a value in the Weight field.
 
4. Choose a rule type from the Type pop-up menu.
 
 You can choose from 17 types, including dashed, striped, dotted, and 
wavy lines.
 
5. Choose a color for the rule from the Color pop-up menu.
 
 This menu lists the colors displayed in the Swatches panel 
(Window➪Swatches [F5]).

250
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
6. From the Width pop-up menu, choose Column to have the rule extend 
from the left edge of the column to the right edge of the column; 
choose Text to have the rule extend from the left edge of the frame or 
column to the right.
 
7. To indent the rule from the left and/or right edges, enter values in the 
Left Indent and/or Right Indent fields.
 
8. Control the vertical position of the rule by entering a value in the 
Offset field.
 
 For a rule above, the offset value is measured upward from the baseline 
of the first line in a paragraph to the bottom of the rule; for a rule below, 
the offset is measured downward from the baseline of the last line in a 
paragraph to the top of the rule.
 
9. Check the Overprint Stroke box if you want to print a rule on top of 
any underlying colors.
 
 This option ensures that any misregistration during printing won’t result 
in white areas around the rule where the paper shows through. A similar 
Overprint Gap check box is available for lines that have a Gap Color.
 
10. To ensure that a rule over a paragraph at the top of a frame displays 
within the frame, check the Keep in Frame option.
 
11. Click OK to close the dialog box, implement your changes, and return 
to the document.
To remove a paragraph rule, click in the paragraph to which the rule is 
applied, choose Paragraph Rules from the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu, 
uncheck the Rule On box, and then click OK.
 
When creating paragraph styles, all the preceding controls are available in the 
Paragraph Rules pane of the New Paragraph Styles dialog box.

hen you create documents, you have lots of opportunities to make 
decisions about how the text appears. With its comprehensive set 
of character-formatting tools, InDesign lets you change the look of type so 
that it can precisely match the communication needs of your publications. 
You can control not just the font and size of type, but also many other 
variations.
Decisions about type matter. A document relies on good typography to allow 
others to easily read and understand it. The appearance of type supports the 
message you’re conveying, and doing a good job of character formatting is 
worth your time.
Specifying Character Formats
InDesign lets you modify the appearance of highlighted characters or 
selected paragraphs with the following options:
 
 Character panel: Highlight the text and open the Character panel 
(Type➪Character [Ô+T or Ctrl+T]), which is shown in Figure 15-1. 
(You can also choose Window➪Type & Tools➪Character.) Be sure 
Show Options is visible in the flyout menu in order to see all the 
possible options. You can also use the double-arrow iconic button to 
the left of the panel name to toggle among showing the panel title, the 
basic options, and all options.
 
 The Character panel provides access to most of InDesign’s character 
formatting options. Three of the options — Font Family, Font Style, and 
Font Size — are also available via the Type menu, and several options 
have keyboard shortcuts.

252
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
 Paragraph panel: Select a paragraph and open the Paragraph panel 
(Type➪Paragraph [Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T]). Chapter 14 covers these 
settings in detail.
 
 Control panel: The Control panel offers all the formatting options of the 
Character panel plus others. If the Control panel doesn’t show all the 
character formatting options, select the text and then click the A iconic 
button on the panel. If the Control panel isn’t visible (it almost always 
is), display it by choosing Window➪Control (Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6).
 
To change the default character formats — the settings that InDesign uses 
when you type text into an empty frame — make changes in the Character 
panel or Control panel when no text is selected or when the text-insertion 
cursor isn’t flashing. That step saves you the hassle of having to reformat 
new text.
You can choose to apply character formats to highlighted text in two ways:
 
 Create and apply character styles. Character styles offer an important 
advantage: A character style’s settings are stored, so you can apply the 
exact same settings easily to other text. When you change a character 
style’s settings, any text based on that style is automatically changed to 
reflect the new settings. (Chapter 13 covers styles in detail.)
 
 Use the local controls in the Character panel, the Control panel, the 
Type menu, or their keyboard shortcuts, which I cover in the upcoming 
sections. Even when you do use character styles, you’ll probably also do 
some local formatting from time to time. For example, you’d probably 
use the Character panel to format the type on the opening spread of a 
feature magazine article and then use character styles to quickly format 
the remainder of the article.

 Chapter 15: Finessing Character Details
 
If you have a smallish monitor, set at 1024 by 768 pixels — the norm for a 
17-inch display — the Character and Character Styles panels may be shoved 
to the bottom of the panel dock. When they’re selected, the only thing you see 
is their panel tab and flyout menu icon. You have a few choices: Shorten other 
panel groups in the dock to make room for them, remove other panel groups 
to make room for them, or drag them out of the dock and make them floating.
Modifying Font, Type Style, and Size
Many people use typographic terms — font, face, typeface, font family, and 
type style — inconsistently. Which terms you use doesn’t matter as long as 
you make yourself understood, but I recommend becoming familiar with the 
font-related terms in InDesign’s menus and panels:
 
 Font or typeface: A collection of characters — including letters, num-
bers, and special characters — that share the same overall appearance, 
including stroke width, weight, angle, and style.
 
 For example, Helvetica Regular and Adobe Garamond Semibold Italic are 
well-known fonts.
 
 Font family: A collection of several fonts that share the same general 
appearance but differ in stroke width, weight, and/or stroke angle.
 
 For example, Helvetica and Adobe Garamond are font families.
 
 Font style: Each of the fonts that make up a font family. When you 
choose a font family from the Character panel’s Font Family menu, 
InDesign displays the family’s font style variations — what most 
of the design world calls type styles — in the accompanying Font Style 
pop-up menu.
 
 For example, Regular and Semibold Italic are examples of font styles.
Changing font family and font style
When you change from one font to another in InDesign, you can choose a 
new font family and font style independently in the Character panel. For 
example, changing from Arial Bold to Times Bold or from Arial Regular to 
Berthold Baskerville Regular is a simple change of font family (Arial to 
Berthold Baskerville). However, if you switch from, say, Bookman Light to 
Century Schoolbook Bold Italic, you’re changing both family and style 
(Bookman to Century and then Light to Bold Italic).

254
Part IV: Text Essentials 
InDesign can display previews of fonts when you select fonts via the Control 
panel, various text-oriented panels, and the Type menu. You turn on this 
capability in the Type pane of the Preferences dialog box by choosing 
InDesign➪Preferences➪Type (Ô+K) on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Type 
(Ctrl+K) in Windows. But doing so makes your menus huge, often so much 
that they’re unwieldy to use. Although it can help you get familiar with your 
fonts, its unwieldy nature may not be worth that benefit. Only you can 
decide, but if you do use the preview feature, I recommend keeping the 
preview size small to limit its size.
Whether you use the Control panel or Character panel, you can choose 
between two methods for changing the font family:
 
 Choose the Font Family menu and then select a name from the list of 
available font families.
 
 Place the cursor in front of or highlight the font name displayed in the 
Font Family field, type the first few letters of the font family you want to 
apply, and then press Return or Enter. For example, entering Cas selects 
Caslon (if it’s available on your computer).
If you choose only a font family when font styles are available in an accompa-
nying submenu, no changes are applied to the selected text. So be sure to 
select a font style from the submenu.
 
When creating character styles, the preceding controls are available in the 
Basic Character Formats pane of the New Character Styles and New Paragraph 
Styles dialog boxes.
Changing type size
You can be very precise with type sizes (what InDesign calls font size). 
InDesign supports sizes from 0.1 point to 1,296 points (108 inches) in 
increments as fine as 0.001 point. Of course, you want to use good judgment 
when choosing type sizes. For example, headlines should be larger than 
subheads, which in turn are larger than body text, which is larger than photo 
credits, and so on.
Change the type size of highlighted text with the following methods:
 
 Choose Type➪Size and then choose one of the predefined sizes listed in 
the Size submenu. If you choose Other from the submenu, the Font Size 
field is highlighted in the Character panel. Enter a custom size and then 
press Return or Enter.

255
 Chapter 15: Finessing Character Details
 
 Use the Character panel or Control panel:
 
1. Choose one of the predefined sizes from the Font Size menu.
 
2. Highlight the currently applied type size displayed in the 
accompanying editable field, enter a new size, and then press 
Return or Enter.
 
3. Make sure that the Font Size field is selected and then use the up 
and down arrow keys to increase or decrease the size in 1-point 
increments. Pressing Shift multiplies the increment to 10.
 
 Control+click or right-click a text selection and then choose a size from 
the Size submenu. If you choose Other from the submenu, the Font Size 
field is highlighted in the Character panel. Enter a custom size and then 
press Return or Enter.
 
If text is highlighted and the Font Size field is empty, more than one type size 
is used in the selected text.
 
When creating character styles, the Font Size control is available in the Basic 
Character Formats pane of the New Character Styles dialog box.
Using Other Character Formats
In the Control panel, you can adjust other character formats, including all 
caps, small caps, superscript, subscript, underline, strikethrough, kerning, 
tracking, horizontal and vertical scale, baseline shift, skew, font style, and 
language. Through the flyout menu, you can also set ligatures, modify 
underline and strikethrough settings, control whether text may break (be 
hyphenated), select its case (such as all caps and small caps), and select 
OpenType features. (The next several sections explain each of these terms, 
except for OpenType features, which let you apply a variety of controls to 
OpenType fonts — an expert topic that this book doesn’t get into detail on.)
In the Character panel, you can adjust kerning, tracking, horizontal and 
vertical scale, baseline shift, skew, and language. Through its flyout menu 
(refer to Figure 15-1), you can also set all caps, small caps, superscript, sub-
script, underline, strikethrough, ligatures, and underline and strikethrough 
settings, as well as control whether text may break (be hyphenated) and 
select OpenType features. (InDesign also lets you create custom underlines 
and strikethroughs, as Chapter 16 describes.)
 
When creating character styles, the kerning, tracking, subscript, superscript, 
case, ligature, underlining, break, and strikethrough controls are available in 
the Basic Character Formats pane of the New Character Styles and New 

256
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Paragraph Styles dialog boxes. The scale, baseline shift, skew, and language 
controls are in the Advanced Character Formats pane. OpenType controls are 
in the OpenType Features pane. Custom underline and strikethrough options, 
covered in Chapter 16, are available in the Underline Options and 
Strikethrough Options panes, respectively.
 
You must choose Show Options from the Character panel’s flyout menu 
to display the Vertical Scale, Horizontal Scale, Baseline Shift, Skew, and 
Language options in the panel.
The Control panel has the same functions as the Character panel, except the 
all caps, small caps, superscript, subscript, underline, and strikethrough 
options are in the panel itself rather than in its flyout menu.
Figure 15-2 shows the various effects in action. In its top row, InDesign has 
a different font style applied, incredible has been scaled horizontally, and 
control is in all caps, while over has had each letter’s baseline shifted by a 
different amount. In the middle row, the word text has been skewed, the word 
with is in small caps, a gradient and underline are applied to typographic, a 
custom underline has been applied to capabilities, and the word formatting 
has been vertically scaled. In the bottom row, compare the baseline shifts in 
the top row to the true superscript and subscript following the words most 
and people. The word never has a custom strikethrough applied, while even 
uses a standard one. The word heard has a colored stroke applied and a 
fill of white.

Horizontal Scale and Vertical 
Scale options
InDesign’s Horizontal Scale option lets you condense and expand type by 
squeezing or stretching characters. Similarly, the Vertical Scale option lets 
you shrink or stretch type vertically.

257
 Chapter 15: Finessing Character Details
Typographers tend to agree that you should avoid excessive scaling. If you 
need to make text bigger or smaller, your best bet is to adjust font size; if 
you need to squeeze or stretch a range of text a bit, use InDesign’s kerning 
and tracking controls because the letter forms aren’t modified — only the 
space between letters changes when you kern or track text. (For more on 
this topic, see the upcoming section “Controlling Space between Characters 
and Lines.”)
Unscaled text has a horizontal and vertical scale value of 100 percent. 
You can apply scaling values between 1 percent and 1,000 percent. If you 
apply equal horizontal and vertical scale values, you’re making the original 
text proportionally larger or smaller. In this case, changing font size is a 
simpler solution.
To change the scale of highlighted text, enter new values in the Horizontal 
and/or Vertical Scale fields in the Character panel or Control panel. If a 
value is highlighted in the Horizontal Scale or Vertical Scale field, you can 
also use the up and down arrow keys to increase and decrease the scaling 
in 1-percent increments; press Shift to increase or decrease in 10-percent 
increments.
Baseline shift
The baseline is an invisible horizontal line on which a line of characters rests. 
The bottom of each letter sits on the baseline (except descenders, such as 
in y, p, q, j, and g). When you perform a baseline shift, you move highlighted 
text above or below its baseline. This feature is useful for carefully placing 
such characters as trademark and copyright symbols and for creating 
custom fractions.
To baseline-shift highlighted text, enter new values in the Baseline Shift field 
in the Character panel or Control panel. You can also use the up and down 
arrow keys to increase the baseline shift in 1-point increments or press Shift 
with the arrow keys to increase or decrease it in 10-point increments.
Skew (false italic)
For fonts that don’t have an italic type style, InDesign provides the option to 
skew, or slant, text to create an artificial italic variation of any font. Like 
horizontal and vertical text scaling, skewing is a clunky way of creating italic-
looking text. Use this feature to create special typographic effects, as shown 
in Figure 15-3, or in situations where a true italic style isn’t available.

258
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
Skewing works better for sans-serif typefaces than for serif typefaces because 
the characters are simpler and have fewer embellishments that can get oddly 
distorted when skewed.
To skew highlighted text, you have three options:
 
 Enter an angle value between –85 and 85 in the Skew field in the 
Character panel or Control panel. Positive values slant text to the left; 
negative values slant text to the right.
 
 Press the accompanying up/down arrow keys when the cursor is in the 
Skew field to skew text in 1-degree increments. Pressing the Shift key 
with an arrow key changes the increment 4 degrees.
 
 Skew all the text in a text frame using the Shear tool or by changing the 
value in the Shear X Angle field in the Control panel after selecting the 
frame. Slanting text by shearing a text frame doesn’t affect the skew 
angle of the text. You can specify a skew angle for highlighted text 
independently from the frame’s shear angle.
 
Figure 15-3: 
Characters 
in skewed 
text can 
slant 
forward, like 
italics, or 
backward, 
as in this 
example.
 
Capitalization options
When you choose All Caps, the uppercase version of all highlighted charac-
ters is used: Lowercase letters are converted to uppercase, and uppercase 
letters remain unchanged.
Similarly, the Small Caps option affects just lowercase letters. When you 
choose Small Caps, InDesign automatically uses the Small Caps font style if 
one is available for the font family. (Few font families include this style.) If a 
Small Caps type style isn’t available, InDesign generates small caps from 
uppercase letters using the scale percentage specified in the Advanced Type 

259
 Chapter 15: Finessing Character Details
pane of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪
Advanced Type [Ô+K] on the Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Advanced Type 
[Ctrl+K] in Windows). The default scale value used to generate small caps 
text is 70% (of uppercase letters).
Another handy way to change the case of text is to highlight the text, choose 
Type➪Change Case, and then select from the appropriate submenu option: 
Uppercase, Lowercase, Title Case, and Sentence Case. Title Case capitalizes 
the first letter in each word, whereas Sentence Case capitalizes the first letter 
in the beginning of each sentence.
Superscript and Subscript
When you apply the Superscript and Subscript character formats to 
highlighted text, InDesign applies a baseline shift to the characters, lifting 
them above (for superscript) or lowering them below (for subscript) their 
baseline, and reduces their size.
The amount of baseline shift and scaling that’s used for the Superscript 
and Subscript formats is determined by the Position and Size fields 
in the Advanced Type pane of the Preferences dialog box. (Choose 
InDesign➪Preferences➪Advanced Type [Ô+K] on the Mac or choose Edit➪
Preferences➪Advanced Type [Ctrl+K] in Windows). The default Position 
value for both formats is 33.3%, which means that characters are moved 
up or down by one-third of the applied leading value. The default Superscript 
and Subscript Size value is 58.3%, which means that superscripted and 
subscripted characters are reduced to 58.3% of the applied font size. The 
Advanced Type pane lets you specify separate default settings for 
Superscript and Subscript.
To apply the Superscript or Subscript format to highlighted text, choose the 
appropriate option from the Character panel’s flyout menu.
Underline and Strikethrough
Underline and Strikethrough formats are typographically considered to be 
unacceptable for indicating emphasis in text, which is better accomplished 
by using bold and/or italic font styles.
Underlines can be useful in kickers and other text above a headline, as well 
as in documents formatted to look as if they’re typewritten. Strikethrough 
can be used in cases where you want to indicate incorrect answers, 
eliminated choices, or deleted text.

260
Part IV: Text Essentials 
If you use underlines and strikethrough, InDesign lets you specify exactly 
how they look through the Underline Options and Strikethrough Options 
dialog boxes available in the flyout menus of the Character panel and 
Control panel.
InDesign lets you create your own underlines and strikethroughs, in addition 
to using the standard ones, as Chapter 16 explains.
Ligatures
A ligature is a special character that combines two letters. Most fonts include 
just two ligatures — fi and fl. When you choose the Ligature option, InDesign 
automatically displays and prints a font’s built-in ligatures — instead of the 
two component letters — if the font includes ligatures.
One nice thing about the Ligature option is that even though a ligature looks 
like a single character on-screen, it’s still fully editable. That is, you can click 
between the two-letter shapes and insert text, if necessary. Also, a ligature 
created with the Ligature option doesn’t cause InDesign’s spell checker to 
flag the word that contains it.
To use ligatures within highlighted text, choose Ligatures from the Character 
panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menu. (Ligatures is set to On by default.) 
Figure 15-4 shows an example of text with a ligature.
You can also insert ligatures manually:
 
 On the Mac, press Option+Shift+5 to insert the fi ligature and 
Option+Shift+6 to insert the fl ligature. You can also use the Mac OS 
X’s Character Palette utility or InDesign’s Glyphs panel (Type➪Glyphs 
[Option+Shift+F11 or Alt+Shift+F11]) to choose them visually.
 
Figure 15-4: 
Ligatures 
are used 
between 
the fi and fl 
letter pairs 
in the words 
finally and 
float at left 
but not at 
right.
 

261
 Chapter 15: Finessing Character Details
 
 In Windows, you have to use a program such as the Character Map 
utility that comes with Windows. Choose Start➪All Programs➪
Accessories➪System Tools➪Character Map; if you have the Classic Start 
menu interface enabled, choose Start➪Programs➪Accessories➪System 
Tools➪Character Map.
However, if you do enter ligatures yourself, InDesign’s spell checker flags any 
words that contain them. For this reason, you’ll typically want InDesign to 
handle the task of inserting ligatures automatically.
Turning off hyphenation and other breaks
You can prevent individual words from being hyphenated or a string of 
words from being broken at the end of a line. For example, you may decide 
that you don’t want to hyphenate certain product names, such as InDesign. 
The No Break option was created for situations such as these.
To prevent a word or a text string from being broken, highlight it and then 
choose No Break from the Character panel’s flyout menu or the Control 
panel’s flyout menu. You can also prevent a word from being hyphenated 
by placing a discretionary hyphen (Shift+Ô+– or Ctrl+Shift+–) in front of the 
first letter. (See Chapter 14 for more on hyphenation controls.)
Controlling Space between 
Characters and Lines
The legibility of a block of text depends as much on the space around it — 
called white space — as it does on the readability of the font. InDesign offers 
two ways to adjust the space between characters:
 
 Kerning is the adjustment of space between a pair of characters. Most 
fonts include built-in kerning tables that control the space between char-
acter pairs, such as LA, Yo, and WA, that otherwise may appear to have 
a space between them even when there isn’t one. For large font sizes — 
for example, a magazine headline — you may want to manually adjust 
the space between certain character pairs to achieve consistent spacing.
 
 Tracking is the process of adding or removing space among all letters in 
a range of text.
You can apply kerning and/or tracking to highlighted text in 1/1,000-em 
increments, called units. An em is as wide as the height of the current font 
size (that is, an em for 12-point text is 12 points wide), which means that 
kerning and tracking increments are relative to the applied font size.

262
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Leading (rhymes with sledding) controls the vertical space between lines of 
type. It’s traditionally an attribute of paragraphs, but InDesign lets you apply 
leading on a character-by-character basis. To override the character-oriented 
approach, ensuring that leading changes affect entire paragraphs, check 
the Apply Leading to Entire Paragraphs option in the Type pane of the 
Preferences dialog box. (Choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Type [Ô+K] on the 
Mac or Edit➪Preferences➪Type [Ctrl+K] in Windows.)
Kerning
The Kerning controls in the Character panel and Control panel provide three 
options for kerning letter pairs:
 
 Metrics: Controls the space between character pairs in the highlighted 
text using a font’s built-in kerning pairs.
 
 Optical: Evaluates each letter pair in highlighted text and adds or 
removes space between the letters based on the shapes of the 
characters.
 
 Manual: Adds or removes space between a specific letter pair in user-
specified amounts.
When the flashing text cursor is between a pair of characters, the Kerning 
field displays the pair’s kerning value. If Metrics or Optical kerning is applied, 
the kerning value is displayed in parentheses.
To apply Metrics or Optical kerning to highlighted text, choose the appropri-
ate option from the Kerning pop-up menu. To apply manual kerning, click 
between a pair of letters and then enter a value in the Kerning field or choose 
one of the predefined values. Negative values tighten; positive values loosen.
 
When letter shapes start to collide, you’ve tightened too far.
Tracking
Tracking is uniform kerning applied to a range of text. (For more on kerning, 
see the preceding section.) You can use tracking to tighten character spacing 
for a font that you think is too spacey or loosen spacing for a font that’s 
too tight. Or you can track a paragraph tighter or looser to eliminate a short 
last line or a widow (the last line of a paragraph that falls at the top of a page 
or column).
To apply tracking to highlighted text, enter a value in the Character panel’s 
or Control panel’s Tracking field or choose one of the predefined values. 
Negative values tighten; positive values loosen (in 0.001-em increments).

263
 Chapter 15: Finessing Character Details
 
You may wonder how tracking is different than kerning. They’re essentially 
the same thing, with this difference: Tracking applies to a selection of three or 
more characters, whereas kerning is meant to adjust the spacing between just 
two characters. You use tracking to change the overall tightness of character 
spacing; you use kerning to improve the spacing between letters that just 
don’t quite look right compared to the rest of the text.
Leading
Leading (rhymes with sledding, not heeding) refers to the vertical space 
between lines of type as measured from baseline to baseline. Leading in 
InDesign is a character-level format, which means that you can apply 
different leading values within a single paragraph. InDesign looks at each 
line of text in a paragraph and uses the largest applied leading value within 
a line to determine the leading for that line.
By default, InDesign applies Auto Leading to text, which is equal to 120 
percent of the type size. As long as you don’t change fonts or type sizes in a 
paragraph, Auto Leading works pretty well. But if you do change fonts or 
sizes, Auto Leading can result in inconsistent spacing between lines. For this 
reason, specifying an actual leading value is safer.
In most cases, using a leading value that is slightly larger than the type size is 
a good idea. When the leading value equals the type size, text is said to be set 
solid. That’s about as tight as you ever want to set leading, unless you’re 
trying to achieve a special typographic effect or working with very large text 
sizes in ad-copy headlines. As is the case with kerning and tracking, when 
tight leading causes letters to collide — ascenders and descenders are the 
first to overlap — you’ve gone too far.
You can change InDesign’s preset Auto Leading value of 120%. To do so, 
choose Type➪Paragraph (Option+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+T) to display the 
Paragraph panel. Choose Justification in the flyout menu, enter a new value 
in the Auto Leading field, and then click OK. (Why a character format setting 
is accessed via the Paragraph panel and what Auto Leading has to do with 
Justification are both mysteries.)
To modify the leading value applied to selected text, choose one of the 
predefined options from the Leading pop-up menu in the Character panel or 
Control panel or enter a leading value in the field. You can enter values from 
0 to 5,000 points in 0.001-point increments. You can also use the up and down 
arrow keys to change leading in 1-point increments.

ith the myriad of text-formatting techniques available in InDesign, 
you can create some snazzy and sophisticated effects. You can 
stretch, skew, rotate, and color text. You can use a wide range of characters 
for bullets. You can add shadows and feathering effects to give words a dra-
matic flair. As with all good things, moderation in your use of text effects will 
keep your documents looking professional. This chapter shows you some 
InDesign features that can produce typographic special effects and gives sug-
gestions on when to use them. (Chapters 14 and 15 cover more prosaic for-
matting controls.)
You can also apply all sorts of transformations to text frames, which affect 
the text inside of them. Chapter 9 covers these capabilities.
Using Bulleted and Numbered Lists
Automatic bullets and numbering are available as a paragraph format in 
InDesign. You access these options (after selecting the paragraphs you want 
to make into automatic lists, of course) by choosing Bullets and Numbering 
Options from the Paragraph panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menus. Doing so 
displays the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, as shown in Figure 16-1.

266
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
The bulleted or numbered list you’re working with may have been first 
created in a word processor and then placed in InDesign. Perhaps the writer 
simply used an asterisk followed by a space to indicate a bullet or used the 
word processor’s automatic bullet or numbering feature. You can deal with 
imported bulleted and numbered lists as described in Chapter 11.
 
Figure 16-1: 
The Bullets
 and Numb-
ering dialog 
box set 
for bullets 
(left) and 
numbering 
(right).
 
To set bullets or numbered lists in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, 
first select either Bullets or Numbers from the List Type pop-up menu and 
then follow these steps:
 
1a. For bullets, choose a bullet character from the Bullet Character area.
 
 This area shows bullet characters available for the current font; you can 
add to the available selections by clicking the Add button, which opens 
the Add Bullets dialog box in which you see a list of available glyphs for 
whatever font you choose from its Font family and Font Style pop-up 
menus. Choose the desired bullet and click OK to return to the Bullets 
and Numbering dialog box. The chosen bullet appears in the Bullet 
Character area.
 
1b. For numbered lists, set the desired formatting from the several other 
options that control how numbered lists display.
 
 You use three most of the time:
 
• In the Format pop-up menu, choose a numbering style to format 
the numbers’ appearance, such as setting them to use Roman (i, ii, 
iii, iv) or Arabic (1, 2, 3, 4) numerals.

267
 Chapter 16: Tricks with Text
 
• In the Number field, you can insert all sorts of special spaces and 
characters, giving you broad control on how numbers display. You 
can also choose number placeholders, which tell InDesign what 
numbers to insert in the list. For simple lists, choose Current Level 
from the Insert Number Placeholder pop-up submenu. The other 
levels are used when you have sublists, an expert feature. You can 
also choose Chapter Number to insert the chapter’s number as the 
list item’s number.
 
• Use the Mode pop-up menu to choose whether the numbers con-
tinue or start anew at the current paragraph. (Your choices are 
Continue from Previous Number and Start At.)
 
2. Adjust the font settings for the bullets or numbers by using the 
Character Style pop-up menu to choose a character style.
 
 The default setting ([None]) uses the paragraph’s current formatting.
 
3. In the Bullet or Number Position section of the dialog box, set the 
indentation for the list.
 
 Using the Alignment pop-up menu, choose Left, Center, or Right to deter-
mine where the bullet or numeral is positioned within its tab. You can 
set the hanging indent amount and the bullet’s or number’s overhang by 
using the Left Indent, First Line Indent, and Tab Position fields.
 
 Select the Preview check box to see the results of your choices before 
you finalize them.
 
4. When you finish formatting the bulleted or numbered list, click OK.
InDesign gives you even more control over bulleted and numbered lists 
through the options you get by choosing Type➪Bulleted & Numbered Lists:
 
 The Apply/Remove Bullets and Apply/Remove Numbers submenu 
options quickly let you turn on or off the bullets or numbering for 
selected paragraphs. You can also use the iconic buttons for these 
controls on the Control panel.
 
 The Restart/Continue Numbering options are a handy way to control 
which paragraphs are numbered, such as when you have an unnum-
bered paragraph within a list. (These options are also available in the 
flyout menu of the Paragraph panel and Control panel.)
 
 The Convert Bullets to Text and Convert Numbering to Text options 
remove the automatic bullets or numerals in a paragraph but leave an 
actual bullet character or numeral at the beginning of the paragraph for 
you to do as you please.

268
Part IV: Text Essentials 
A more expert option is the Define Lists option (available in two places: by 
choosing Type➪Bulleted & Numbered Lists➪Define Lists or by choosing 
Define Lists from the Paragraph panel’s flyout menu). Here, you create list 
styles with just two options: Continue Numbers Across Stories and Continue 
Numbers from Previous Document in a Book. These list styles are accessed 
when you create or edit paragraph styles using the style dialog boxes’ Bullets 
and Numbering pane, or when you apply bullets and numbering through the 
Paragraph panel’s or Control panel’s flyout menu. (Either way, choose the 
appropriate style in the List pop-up menu.)
When you choose the first option, InDesign continues numbering text based 
on the last number used in the previous story rather than restarting the num-
bering at each story (the normal behavior). When you choose the second 
option, InDesign continues numbering text based on the last number used in 
the previous chapter of a book (see Chapter 21) rather than starting over 
again with this document (the normal behavior).
 
For the bullets in a list, you’re not limited to using the small round bullet (•) 
included in most typefaces. You can use any character in the body text font, 
or you can switch to a symbol or pi font and choose a more decorative 
character. Zapf Dingbats and Wingdings are the most common symbol fonts, 
offering an array of boxes, arrows, crosses, stars, and check marks.
Labeling Paragraphs
Along with using drop caps, which I cover in Chapter 14, changing the 
formatting of the first few words in a paragraph as a label can serve as a 
visual indicator that the reader has arrived at the beginning of a story, 
chapter, or new topic. To experiment with label formatting, use the attributes 
available via the Character panel or Control panel and their flyout menus, 
such as font changes, horizontal scale, or small caps. After you decide on the 
formatting for labels, you can apply it by using character styles after para-
graph styles are applied — and after the text is final. You may also be able to 
use the nested styles feature if the label text follows a specific pattern, such 
as a specific number of words or characters or an entire sentence.
 
A real easy way to consistently apply the desired label formatting to text is to 
use a nested style, as explained in Chapter 13.
The following descriptions show frequently used label formatting:
 
 Boldface: Bold type is often used for titles and subheads in magazines, 
newspapers, and reports. To apply boldface in InDesign, select the bold 
version of the typeface from the Font Style pop-up menu in the 
Character panel.

269
 Chapter 16: Tricks with Text
 
 Italics: Italic text is a good choice for emphasizing specific words and for 
applying to tertiary heads. To apply italics in InDesign, select the 
oblique version of the typeface from the Font Style pop-up menu on the 
Character panel.
 
 Underlines: Underlined text isn’t used as frequently as it once was, 
simply because page-layout programs such as InDesign offer more 
sophisticated options for labeling text. Still, you may have occasion to 
use underlines, such as to emphasize a label. Use the Underline com-
mand in the menu on the Character panel or via the iconic button in 
the Control panel’s character (A) pane. Note that you have no control 
over the style, thickness, or placement of the underline if you use 
this option; for custom underlines, use the controls described in the 
“Custom underline and strikethrough options” section, later in this 
chapter.
 
 SMALL CAPS: Small caps offer a subtle, classic look that blends well with the 
rest of the document. You have two choices for applying small 
caps from the Character pane: Choose a small-caps variation of a 
typeface from the Font Style pop-up menu or choose the Small Caps 
command from the Character panel’s flyout menu, or via the iconic 
button in the Control panel’s character (A) pane.
 
 Typeface change: Rather than relying on different variations of a font, you 
can use a different font altogether, such as Futura Medium, for a label. 
To contrast with serif body text, you might choose a sans-serif typeface 
that complements the look of your publication. To apply a different 
typeface, use the Font Family pop-up menu in the Character panel or 
Control panel.
 
 Scaled text: Scaling text horizontally — up 10 or 20 percent — is a 
subtle effect that makes the section of text visually distinct. Scaling text 
vertically, however, can be too subtle unless combined with boldface or 
another style. Use the Horizontal Scale and Vertical Scale fields in the 
Character panel or Control panel to scale text.
 
 Size change: Bumping the size of a label up a point or two is another 
subtle design choice. To change the size of type, use the Font Size field 
in the Character panel or Control panel.
Adding Special Type Treatments
Skilled graphic designers make decisions based on what best serves the 
content. In doing so, they often rely on special typographic techniques. 
For example, the use of reverse type helps to break up pages and organize 
text, while careful formatting of fractions and hanging punctuation adds a 
professional touch.

270
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Reversing type out of its background
Reversed type is white type on a black background rather than black type on 
a white background. Of course, reversed type doesn’t have to be white on 
black; it can be any lighter color on a darker color. You often find reversed 
type in table headings, kickers (explanatory blurbs following headlines), and 
decorative layout elements.
To lighten the text, highlight it with the Type tool, click the Fill button on the 
Tools panel, and choose a light color from the Swatches panel (Window➪
Swatches [F5]). For the dark background, you have three options: filling the 
text frame with a darker color, making the text frame transparent and placing 
it on top of darker objects, or placing a thick, dark ruling line behind the text.
For the first two options, select the text frame and then click the Fill iconic 
button on the Tools panel.
 
 To fill the text frame with a darker color, click a color from the Swatches 
panel.
 
 To make the text frame transparent, click the Apply None iconic button 
on the Tools panel. Then place the text frame in front of a darker object 
or graphic.
To create reversed type that isn’t in its own text frame, use a ruling line of 
the appropriate width (at least a couple points larger than the text size). If 
you use a Ruling Line Above, move the line down behind the text; if you use a 
Ruling Line Below, move it up. Figure 16-2 shows reversed type used as a 
heading, as well as the Paragraph Rules dialog box and the settings used to 
create the effect. (To access this dialog box, choose Paragraph Rules from 
the flyout menu of the Control panel’s ¶ pane or of the Paragraph panel 
[Option+Ô+J or Ctrl+Alt+J].)
I explain how to create and adjust ruling lines in greater detail in Chapter 14.

out text,

271
 Chapter 16: Tricks with Text
Creating sidebars and pull-quotes
A sidebar is supplemental text that is often formatted differently from the 
rest of the document and placed within a shaded or outlined box. Sidebars 
help break up text-heavy pages and call attention to information that is often 
interesting but not essential to the main story.
Particularly in text-heavy publications, pulling in-depth information or related 
text into sidebars can help provide visual relief. To create a sidebar, you 
usually place the text in its own frame, then stroke the frame, and optionally 
fill it with a tint. To inset the text from the edges of the frame, use the Text 
Frame Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame Options [Ô+B or Ctrl+B]).
A pull-quote is a catchy one- or two-line excerpt from a publication that is 
enlarged and reformatted to achieve both editorial and design objectives. 
Pull-quotes draw readers into articles with excerpts that do everything from 
summarize the content to provide shock value. From the design perspective, 
pull-quotes break up static columns and offer opportunities for typographic 
treatment that emphasizes the content, such as colors and typefaces that 
support the mood of an article.
To create a pull-quote, copy and paste the relevant text into its own text 
frame and then reformat the text and frame as you wish. Use the Text Wrap 
panel (Window➪Text Wrap [Option+Ô+W or Ctrl+Alt+W]) to control how 
text in columns wraps around the pull-quote.
 
To create sidebars, pull-quotes, or other such elements that stay close 
to the text that refers to them, use the anchored-object feature described in 
Chapter 10.
Formatting fractions
Creating fractions that are formatted correctly can be handy. Compare 
the leftmost fraction in Figure 16-3, which really isn’t formatted as a fraction, 
to the other three fractions, which are correctly formatted (each using a 
different technique). Although InDesign doesn’t provide an automatic 
fraction maker, you can use OpenType typefaces, expert typefaces, or 
character formats to achieve professional-looking fractions.
Applying a fraction typeface
Some expert typefaces include a variation, appropriately called Fractions, 
that includes a number of common fractions, such as 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, and 3/4. Adobe 
has Expert Collection variants for many of its popular Type 1 PostScript 

272
Part IV: Text Essentials 
fonts; these collections include true small caps, true fractions, and other 
typographic characters. You can also use a symbol font, though the numerals 
may not exactly match the appearance of numerals in the rest of your text 
because symbol fonts typically use plain fonts like Helvetica as their basis.
To use a true fraction from an Expert Collection font, choose Type➪Glyph 
(Option+Shift+F11 or Alt+Shift+F11), select the font and face from the pop-up 
menus at the bottom of the dialog box shown in Figure 16-3, and then select 
the fraction you want to use.
If you have OpenType fonts, the process can be automated: Be sure that the 
Fraction option is enabled for the selected text, either as part of its character 
or paragraph style, or by highlighting the text and adjusting the OpenType 
options directly:
 
 For styles, go to the OpenType Features pane when creating or 
modifying a paragraph or character style and checking Fractions.
 
 For local formatting, highlight the text containing the fraction and then 
choose OpenType➪Fraction from the flyout menu of the Character panel 
or Control panel — be sure that Fraction is checked in the menu.

These OpenType options have no effect on non–OpenType fonts.
Formatting fractions manually
If you’re dealing with a wide range of fractions in something like a cookbook, 
you probably won’t find all the fractions you need in your Expert Collection 
or OpenType font. And regular Type 1 Postscript and TrueType fonts cer-
tainly won’t have the desired fractions. Because it would be difficult to 
format fractions such as 3/16 exactly the same as, say, an expert font’s 1/4, you 
may opt for formatting all the fractions manually.
The built-in fractions in expert and OpenType fonts are approximately the 
same size as a single character in that font, and this consistent size is your 
eventual goal in formatting a fraction manually. Usually, you achieve this size 
consistency between fractions and surrounding text by decreasing the size of 
the two numerals within the fraction, raising the numerator (the first, or top, 
number in the fraction) using the baseline shift feature, and kerning on either 
side of the slash as necessary. (Chapter 16 covers these controls.) Figure 16-3 
shows examples of an unformatted fraction, an expert font’s fraction, an 
OpenType-generated fraction, and a manually created fraction.
 
Macintosh PostScript and TrueType fonts (as well as expert fonts and 
OpenType fonts for both Windows and Macintosh) provide another option 
for refining fractions: a special kind of slash called a virgule, which is smaller 
and at more of an angle than a regular slash. Press Option+Shift+1 to enter 
a virgule and then kern around it as you would a slash. (You can see how a 
virgule differs from a slash in Figure 16-3: The first and fourth fractions use 
slashes, while the second and third use virgules.)
Unless you rarely use fractions, by all means save your formatting as charac-
ter styles. You can apply the formats with a keystroke or use Find/Change 
(Edit➪Find/Change [Ô+F or Ctrl+F]) to locate numbers and selectively apply 
the appropriate character style.
Optical margin alignment
When display type, such as a pull-quote or headline type in ads, is left-aligned 
or justified, the edges can look uneven due to the gaps above, below, or next 
to quotation marks, other punctuation, and some capital letters. Notice the 
text frame on the left in Figure 16-4, which doesn’t have hanging punctuation. 
To correct the unevenness, you can use a technique called hanging punctua-
tion, or optical margin alignment, which extends the punctuation slightly 
beyond the edges of the rest of the text.

274
Part IV: Text Essentials 
 
Figure 16-4: 
Notice the 
difference 
between the 
standard 
alignment 
on the left 
and the

punctuation 
on the right.
 
 
The edge of text is defined by the edges of the text frame or any Inset Spacing 
specified in the Text Frame Options dialog box (Object➪Text Frame Options 
[Ô+B or Ctrl+B]).
The optical margin alignment feature automates hanging punctuation, 
extending punctuation and the edges of some glyphs (such as the capital T) 
slightly outside the edges of the text. Unfortunately, you can’t control how 
much the characters “hang” outside the text boundaries — InDesign decides 
that for you. And optical margin alignment applies to all the text frames in a 
story, rather than to highlighted text. Therefore, you need to isolate any text 
for which you want hanging punctuation into its own story.
To specify optical margin alignment, select any text frame in a story and 
choose Type➪Story. In the Story panel, check the Optical Margin Alignment 
option, as shown in Figure 16-4.
Custom underline and 
strikethrough options
You can use InDesign to create text with custom underlines and 
strikethroughs. Although you should use these effects sparingly, they 
can be effective for signs and other design-oriented text presentations, 
such as the examples shown in Figure 16-5.
You can find both the Underline Options and Strikethrough Options menu 
items in the flyout menu of the Character panel’s and of the Control panel’s A 
pane, and you can use these menu options to get just the look you’re inter-
ested in. The process for setting both Underline Options and Strikethrough 
Options is similar:

275
 Chapter 16: Tricks with Text
 
1. Highlight the text to which you want to add the custom underline or 
strikethrough.
 
2. Specify the thickness, type, color, and other settings for the line that 
makes up the underline or the strikethrough line.
 
 If you choose an underline or strikethrough line type that has gaps — 
such as dashed, dotted, or striped lines — you can also choose a gap 
color. Figure 16-6 shows the Underline Options dialog box and the nearly 
identical Strikethrough Options dialog box.
 
3. Apply the underline or strikethrough style.
 
 You apply the underline style via the Control panel, Character panel, or 
keyboard shortcut (Shift+Ô+U or Ctrl+Shift+U). Apply the strikethrough 
style via the Control panel, Character panel, or keyboard shortcut 
(Shift+Ô+/ or Ctrl+Shift+/).

276
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Note that a custom underline or strikethrough created and applied this way 
is in effect only for the first text to which an underline or strikethrough is 
applied. InDesign reverts to the standard settings the next time you apply 
an underline or strikethrough. If you want to use a custom underline or 
strikethrough setting repeatedly, you should define the setting as part of a 
character style.
Adjusting character strokes
 
InDesign CS4 lets you adjust the strokes that make up characters, as Figure 
16-7 shows. You’ll rarely use this design effect. To change the stroke, select 
the text you want to adjust and then go to the Stroke panel (Window➪Stroke 
[Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10]) and adjust any of the following settings: Join, Miter 
Limit (if Miter Join is the selected Join), and Align Stroke. Note that for text, 
you only get the Center and Outside options for Align Stroke, not Inside. 
(Chapter 7 covers strokes in more detail.)
 
Figure 16-7: 
Compare 
the adjusted 
stroke at

the stroke

stroke at

Converting Text into Shapes
If you want to use the shape of a letter or the combined shapes of several let-
ters as a frame for text or a graphic, you could test your skill with the Pen tool 
and create the letter shape(s) yourself. But getting hand-drawn characters to 

277
 Chapter 16: Tricks with Text
look just the way you want them to can take lots of time. A quicker solution is 
to use the Create Outlines command to convert text characters into editable 
outlines. The Create Outlines command is particularly useful if you want to 
hand-tweak the shapes of characters, particularly at display font sizes, or 
place text or a graphic within character shapes.
 
If all you need to do is apply a stroke or fill to characters within text, you don’t 
have to convert the characters into outlines. Instead, simply highlight the 
characters and use the Stroke panel (Window➪Stroke [Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10]) 
and Swatches panel (Window➪Swatches [F5]) to change their appearance. 
This way, you can still edit the text. (See Chapter 7 for more details.)
When you use the Create Outlines command, you have the choice of creating 
an inline compound path that replaces the original text or an independent 
compound path that’s placed directly on top of the original letters in its own 
frame. If you want the text outlines to flow with the surrounding text, create 
an inline compound path. If you want to use the outlines elsewhere, create an 
independent compound path.
To convert text into outlines:
 
1. Use the Type tool to highlight the characters you want to convert into 
outlines.
 
 Generally, this feature works best with large font sizes.
 
2. Choose Type➪Create Outlines (Shift+Ô+O or Ctrl+Shift+O — that’s the 
letter O, not a zero).
 
 If you hold down the Option or Alt key when you choose Create Outlines 
(or if you press Shift+Option+Ô+O or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+O), a compound 
path is created and placed in front of the text. In this case, you can use 
either of the selection tools to move the resulting compound path. If you 
don’t hold down Option or Alt when you choose Create Outlines, an 
inline compound path is created. This object replaces the original text 
and flows with the surrounding text.
After you create text outlines, you can modify the paths the same as you 
can modify hand-drawn paths. You can also use the transformation tools, 
the Control panel (Window➪Control [Option+Ô+6 or Ctrl+Alt+6]), and the 
Transform panel (Window➪Transform) to change the appearance of text 
outlines. You can’t, however, edit text after converting it to outlines.
Additionally, you can use the Place command (File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]) 
or the Paste Into command (Edit➪Paste Into [Option+Ô+V or Ctrl+Alt+V]) 
to import text or a graphic into the frames created by converting text to 
graphics.

278
Part IV: Text Essentials 
Making Text Follow a Path
InDesign lets you have text follow any open or closed path, such as a line or 
frame. Simply select the path or shape with the Type on a Path tool, which is 
available from the Type tool’s pop-up menu. Now start typing (or paste or 
place) your text.
After you enter the text and format it with font, size, color, and so on, you can 
apply special effects to it using the Type on a Path Options dialog box, 
accessed by choosing Type➪Type on a Path➪Options.
You can also double-click the Type on a Path tool to open the Type on a Path 
Options dialog box.
Figure 16-8 shows the dialog box and several examples of its formatting. In 
the dialog box:
 
 Use the Effect pop-up menu to choose a visual effect.
 
 Use the Align pop-up menu to choose what part of the text is aligned 
(baseline, center, ascender, or descender).
 
 Use the To Path pop-up menu to choose whether to align to the center, 
bottom, or top of the path.
 
 Flip the text by selecting the Flip option.
 
 Change the text’s spacing by entering a value in the Spacing field 
(positive numbers space out the text, while negative ones contract it).

Graphics 
Essentials

In this part . . .
T
hey say a picture is worth a thousand words, and, 
well, a lot of them are. Graphics make layouts come 
alive, providing a visceral connection that text by itself 
just can’t. So it should be no surprise that InDesign has 
tons of features that let you work and even create graph-
ics. This part shows you how to work with imported 
graphics files, cropping them and making them fit your 
layout’s canvas. 
You may wonder why this part is so short, given how 
many graphical effects InDesign offers. If you haven’t read 
Part III, that confusion is understandable: InDesign lets 
you apply most of its special effects and controls to any 
object, not just those containing graphics, so Part III 
covers that common razzle-dazzle in one place.

Chapter 17
Importing Graphics
In This Chapter
 Getting graphics ready for InDesign
 Bringing graphics into your layout
 Working with layered images
W
hat is a layout without graphics? Boring, that’s what. And that’s why 
InDesign lets you import a wide variety of graphics types so that you 
have a lot of choices and flexibility in the images you use.
And through the Mac and Windows Clipboards (copy and paste), you can 
import file formats — to a limited degree — that aren’t directly supported by 
InDesign.
 
The terms graphic and picture are interchangeable, referring to any type of 
graphic — though InDesign consistently uses the word graphic in its user 
interface and documentation. An image is a bitmapped graphic, such as that 
produced by an image editor, digital camera, or scanner, while an illustration 
or drawing is a vector file produced by an illustration program.
Preparing Graphics Files
InDesign offers support for many major formats of graphics files. Some for-
mats are more appropriate than others for certain kinds of tasks. The basic 
rules for creating your graphics files are as follows: 
 
 Save line art (drawings) in a format such as EPS, PDF, Adobe Illustrator, 
Windows Metafile (WMF), Enhanced Metafile (EMF), or PICT. (These 
object-oriented formats are called vector formats. Vector files are com-
posed of instructions on how to draw various shapes.) InDesign works 
best with EPS, PDF, and Illustrator files.

282
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
 
 Save bitmaps (photos and scans) in a format such as TIFF, Adobe 
Photoshop, PNG, JPEG, PCX, Windows Bitmap (BMP), GIF, Scitex 
Continuous Tone (SCT), or PICT. (These pixel-oriented formats are 
called raster formats. Raster files are composed of a series of dots, or 
pixels, that make up the image.) InDesign works best with TIFF and 
Photoshop files.
InDesign can also import InDesign files as if they were graphics — in a mul-
tipage document, you choose the page you want to import and which layers 
you want to display, as you can with PDF files. (Be sure to enable Show 
Import Options in the Place dialog box to get these controls.) 
Note that you can’t edit InDesign files imported as graphics in your InDesign 
layout. (You must update the original file instead.) But you can quickly open 
the InDesign file for editing by selecting it and then choosing Edit➪Edit 
Original.
 
Make EPS and TIFF formats your standards because these formats have 
become the standard in publishing. If you and your service bureau are work-
ing almost exclusively with Adobe software, you can add the PDF, Illustrator, 
and Photoshop formats to this mix. (The Illustrator and PDF formats are vari-
ants of EPS.) If you use transparency in your graphics, it’s best to save them 
in Photoshop, Illustrator, or PDF formats, because other formats (particularly 
EPS and TIFF) remove much of the transparency layering data that will help an 
imagesetter optimally reproduce those transparent files.
The graphics file formats that InDesign imports include (the text in monofont 
is the filename extension for the format):
 
 BMP: The native Windows bitmap format (.bmp, .dib).
 
 EPS: The Encapsulated PostScript file format favored by professional 
publishers (.eps).
 
 GIF: The Graphics Interchange Format common in Web documents 
(.gif).
 
 JPEG: The Joint Photographers Expert Group compressed bitmap 
format often used on the Web (.jpg).
 
 Illustrator: The native format in Adobe Illustrator 5.5 through CS4. This 
file format is similar to EPS (.ai).
 
 PCX: The PC Paintbrush format that was very popular in DOS programs 
and early version of Windows; it’s now been largely supplanted by other 
formats (.pcx, .rle).
 
 PDF: The Portable Document Format that is a variant of EPS and is used 
for Web-, network-, and CD-based documents. InDesign CS4 supports 
PDF Versions 1.3 through 1.8 (the formats used in Acrobat 4 through 9) 
(.pdf).

283
 Chapter 17: Importing Graphics
 
 Photoshop: The native format in Adobe Photoshop 5.0 through CS4 
(.psd). (Note that InDesign can’t import the Photoshop Raw format.)
 
 PICT: Short for Picture, the Mac’s native graphics format until Mac OS X 
(it can be bitmap or vector) that is little used in professional documents 
and has become rare even for inexpensive clip art (.pct).
 
 PNG: The Portable Network Graphics format introduced more than a 
decade ago as a more capable alternative to GIF (.png).
 
 QuickTime movie: For use in interactive documents, InDesign supports 
this Apple-created, cross-platform format (.mov).
 
 Scitex CT: The continuous-tone bitmap format used on Scitex prepress 
systems (.ct).
 
 TIFF: The Tagged Image File Format that is the bitmap standard for pro-
fessional image editors and publishers (.tif, .tiff).
 
 Windows Metafile: The format native to Windows but little used in pro-
fessional documents. Since Office 2000, Microsoft applications create 
a new version called Enhanced Metafile, also supported by InDesign 
(.wmf, .emf).
 
Spot colors (called spot inks in Photoshop) are imported into InDesign when 
you place Photoshop, Illustrator, and PDF images into InDesign, as well as 
for InDesign documents imported as graphics. They appear in the Swatches 
panel, which is covered in Chapter 6.
Importing and Placing Graphics
When you import a graphic into a document, InDesign establishes a link 
between the graphics file and the document file and then sends the original 
graphics file to the printer when the document is output. (For more details 
on managing linked files, see Chapter 9.)
InDesign links to graphics because a graphics file, particularly a high-
resolution scanned graphic, can be very large. If the entire graphics file is 
included in an InDesign document when you import it, InDesign documents 
would quickly become prohibitively large. Instead, InDesign saves a low-
resolution preview of an imported graphics file with the document, and it’s 
this file that you see displayed on-screen. InDesign remembers the location 
of the original file and uses this information when printing.
The Place command is the method you typically use to bring graphics into 
your InDesign layout. Here’s how to use the Place command to import a 
graphic:

284
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
 
1. Choose File➪Place (Ô+D or Ctrl+D).
 
 If you want to import a graphic into an existing frame, select the target 
frame using either of the selection tools (either before you choose 
File➪Place or afterward). If you want InDesign to create a new frame 
when you import the graphic, make sure that no object is selected when 
you choose Place. Either way, the Place dialog box appears.
 
 You can import a graphic into any kind of frame or shape (including a 
curved line created with the Pen tool) except a straight line. Be careful: 
If the Type tool is selected when you use the Place command to import 
a graphic into a selected text frame, you’ll create an inline graphic at the 
text cursor’s location.
 
2. Use the controls in the Place dialog box to locate and select the graph-
ics files you want to import.
 
 You can now select multiple files — graphics and/or text — by 
Shift+clicking a range or Ô+clicking or Ctrl+clicking multiple files one 
by one. InDesign lets you place each file in a separate frame. Just click 
once for each file imported or Shift+Ô+click or Ctrl+Shift+click to have 
InDesign place all files on the page in separate frames. The loaded-
graphic icon shows the number of files to be placed, as well as a mini-
preview of each file, as Figure 17-1 shows. You can also navigate through 
these previews using the keyboard’s left and right arrow keys so that 
you can control more easily which file is placed when.
 
3. Specify the desired import options, if any are applicable. 
 
 If you want to display import options that let you control how the 
selected graphics file is imported, either enable Show Import Options 
and then click Open or hold down the Shift key and double-click the file-
name or Shift+click Open.
 
 If you had selected a frame and want whatever you’ve selected to 
replace the contents of that frame, enable Replace Selected Items.
 
4. Click Open, whether or not you selected any import options, to bring 
the graphics into the layout.
 
 Note that if you choose to Show Import Options, the dialog box that 
appears — EPS Import Options, Place PDF, Place InDesign Document, or 
Image Import Options — depends on what kind of graphic you’re import-
ing. If you select multiple graphics, you’ll get the appropriate dialog box 
for each in turn. (These options are covered in the “Specifying Import 
Options” section, later in this chapter.) After selecting the desired 
options, click OK to place the graphic.
 
5. Based on whether a frame was selected when you initiated the Place 
command, you may need to tell InDesign where to put the imported 
graphics:

285
 Chapter 17: Importing Graphics
 
• If an empty frame is selected, the graphic is automatically placed 
in the frame. The upper-left corner of the graphic is placed in the 
upper-left corner of the frame, and the frame acts as the cropping 
shape for the graphic.
 
• If a frame already holding a graphic is selected, InDesign 
replaces the existing graphic with the new one if you’ve selected 
the Replace Selected Item check box in the Place dialog box. 
Otherwise, InDesign assumes that you want to put the new graphic 
in a new frame.
 
• To place the graphic into a new frame, click the loaded-graphic 
icon on an empty portion of a page or on the pasteboard. The 
point where you click establishes the upper-left corner of the 
resulting graphics frame, which is the same size as the imported 
graphic and which acts as the graphic’s cropping shape.
 
• To place the graphic in an existing, unselected frame, click in the 
frame with the loaded-graphic icon. The upper-left corner of the 
graphic is placed in the upper-left corner of the frame, and the 
frame acts as a cropping shape.
After you place a graphic, it’s displayed in the frame that contains it, and 
the frame is selected. If the Selection tool is selected, the eight handles of its 
bounding box are displayed; if the Direct Selection tool is selected, handles 
appear only in the corners. At this point, you can modify either the frame or 
the graphic within, or you can move on to another task.
 
If you select multiple graphics files for placement, you can hold Shift+Ô or 
Ctrl+Shift when dragging the mouse in your document to place an array of the 
files, each in its own frame within the area defined when dragging the mouse. 
This new feature lets you place multiple images in a contact-sheet arrange-
ment. InDesign CS4 creates as many frames as can fit that array, placing a 
file into each frame. Any files not placed remain in the load-graphics icon for 
placement elsewhere.
 
When importing JPEG files, InDesign automatically scales the image to fit in 
the page. This feature helps deal with digital-camera graphics that tend to be 
very large in dimension and, when imported, end up taking much more than 
the width of a page. Although you’ll likely still need to scale the image to fit 
your layout, you can at least see the whole image before doing so.

Specifying Import Options
If you’ve ever used a graphics application — for example, an image-editing 
program like Adobe Photoshop or an illustration program like Adobe 
Illustrator or CorelDraw — you’re probably aware that when you save a 
graphics file, you have several options that control such things as file format, 
image size, color depth, preview quality, and so on. When you save a graphics 
file, the settings you specify are determined by the way in which the image 
will be used. For example, you can use Photoshop to save a high-resolution 
TIFF version of a scanned graphic for use in a slick, four-color annual report 
or a low-resolution GIF version of the same graphic for use on the company’s 
Web page. Or you can use Illustrator or CorelDraw to create a corporate logo 
that you’ll use in various sizes in many of your printed publications.

287
 Chapter 17: Importing Graphics
If you choose to specify custom import settings when you import a graphics file, 
the choices you make depend on the nature of the publication. For example, 
if it’s bound for the Web, you don’t need to work with or save graphics using 
resolutions that exceed a computer monitor’s 72-dpi resolution. Along the same 
lines, if the publication will be printed, the image import settings you specify 
for a newspaper that will be printed on newsprint on a SWOP (Specifications 
for Web Offset Publications) press are different than those you specify for a 
four-color magazine printed on coated paper using a sheet-fed press.
If you select Show Import Options when you place a graphic, the options 
displayed in the resulting dialog boxes depend on the file format of the 
selected graphic. When you set options for a particular file, the options you 
specify remain in effect for that file format until you change them. If you don’t 
select the Show Import Options check box when you place a graphic, the 
most recent settings for the file format of the selected graphic are used.
Import options for bitmap graphics
InDesign gives you two sets of import options for the following types of 
bitmap images: TIFF, GIF, JPEG, Scitex CT, BMP, and PCX. You get three 
options for PNG files, and a different set of three for Photoshop files. No 
import options are available for PICT or QuickTime movie files. 
Figure 17-2 shows three of the four possible panes for bitmap images: The 
Image and Color panes are for most bitmap formats; PNG files have a third 
pane, PNG Settings, and Photoshop files also have a third pane, Layers, 
covered later in this chapter. 
If you import a Photoshop, TIFF, or EPS file that contains an embedded 
clipping path, the Image pane lets you apply any embedded clipping path 
and/or alpha channel to the image in order to mask, or cut out, part of 
the image. (Otherwise, these options are grayed out.) Check the Apply 
Photoshop Clipping Path option to import the clipping path along with the 
image; select an alpha channel from the Alpha Channel pop-up menu to 
import the alpha channel along with the image. (Chapter 18 covers clipping 
paths in more detail.)
In the Color pane, you can turn on color management for the image and 
control how the image is displayed. Check the Enable Color Management 
option to enable color management. This option is an expert feature, so ask 
your production manager or service bureau whether you should make any 
adjustments here.

Use the PNG Settings pane — available only if you place a PNG file — to use 
the transparency information in a PNG file, assuming that it has a transparent 
background. You have two choices for controlling transparency handling: 
White Background and File-Defined Background. The former forces the trans-
parent portion to display as white in InDesign; the latter uses whatever back-
ground color is specified in the PNG file itself.
This pane also lets you adjust the gamma value during import — an expert 
color-management feature you should leave alone unless told otherwise by a 
production manager or service bureau.

289
 Chapter 17: Importing Graphics
Import options for vector file formats
If you’re importing vector files, enabling the Import Options check box 
results in one of two dialog boxes appearing, depending on what the vector 
file type is. If you import older-version Illustrator or EPS files, you get the EPS 
Import Options dialog box; if you import PDF and newer-version Illustrator 
files, you get the Place PDF dialog box, which has two panes. (Both dialog 
boxes are shown in Figure 17-3.) No import options are available for Windows 
Metafile or Enhanced Metafile graphics.
 
Illustrator CS through CS4 use PDF as their native file format, even though 
the filename extension is .ai. InDesign detects these files as PDF files and 
provides the PDF options during import. In earlier versions of Illustrator, the 
native format was actually a variant of EPS.
 
Figure 17-3:

290
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
EPS Import Options dialog box
Use this dialog box to import any clipping paths embedded in images that 
are in the EPS file. Check the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option to enable 
this option.
Also, use this pane to control how the EPS file appears on-screen in InDesign. 
If you select the Use TIFF or PICT Preview option, InDesign uses the low-
resolution proxy image embedded in the EPS file for display on-screen and 
prints the graphic using the embedded high-resolution PostScript instruc-
tions. If you select the Rasterize the PostScript option, InDesign converts the 
PostScript file into a bitmap image during import. You rarely have a reason to 
rasterize an imported EPS file — it just takes up some of your valuable time.
Place PDF dialog box
When you use the Place command to import a PDF file and you select the 
Show Import Options check box, the Place PDF file dialog box, shown in 
Figure 17-3, is displayed. It provides several controls for specifying how the 
file is imported. The General pane provides the following options:
 
 In the Pages section, select Previewed Page, All, or Range to determine 
which page(s) you want to import. You can change the previewed page 
by using the arrow buttons under the preview image at left or entering a 
specific page number in the field below the preview image. If you want to 
import a range, use commas to separate pages and a hyphen to indicate 
range; for example, 3, 5-9, 13 imports pages 3, 5 through 9, and 13.
 
 When you place the PDF in InDesign, you get a separate loaded-graphic 
icon for each page. As you place each page, a new loaded-graphic icon 
appears for the next page, until no more pages are left to place. You can 
tell you’re placing multiple pages because the loaded-graphics icon has 
a plus sign in it.  
 
 In the Options section, select one of the cropping options from the 
Crop To pop-up menu. If you choose Content, the page’s bounding box 
or a rectangle that encloses all items, including page marks, is used to 
build the graphics frame. Choosing Art places the area defined by the 
file’s creator, if any, as placeable artwork. For example, the person who 
created the file may have designated a particular graphic as placeable 
artwork. Choosing Crop places the area displayed and printed by Adobe 
Acrobat. Choosing Trim places the graphic in an area equal to the final, 
trimmed piece. Choosing Bleed places the page area plus any specified 
bleed area. Choosing Media places an area defined by the paper size 
specified for the PDF document, including page marks.
 
 Also in the Options section, select the Transparent Background check 
box if you want the white areas of the PDF page to be transparent. 
Uncheck this option if you want to preserve the page’s opaque white 
background.

 Chapter 17: Importing Graphics
Import options for placed InDesign files
When you import InDesign files to use as a graphic, you can use exactly the 
same options as for PDF files. The Place InDesign Document dialog box is 
identical to the Place PDF dialog box covered in the previous section, except 
of course, for the dialog box’s name.
Working with Image Layers
InDesign lets you work with individual layers in some imported graphics. 
What that means is that you have more control over what displays because 
you can turn on or off individual layers. Of course, to use this capability, the 
source graphic must be constructed with multiple layers.
You can work with layers while you’re importing graphics, using the Image 
Import Options dialog box described in the previous section, or after you’ve 
placed graphics, using the Object Layer Options dialog box covered in the 
“working with layers after import” section later in this chapter.
Working with layers during import
Use the Layers pane in the Image Import Options dialog box, the Place PDF, 
or Place InDesign Document dialog box to select which layers you want vis-
ible in InDesign. (The Layers pane is available only if you place an Illustrator, 
PDF, or Photoshop graphic or InDesign file.) 
In the Layers pane, you see a list of image layers. Any that have the eye icon 
will display in InDesign, and you can select or deselect layers by clicking the 
box to the right of the layer name to make the eye icon appear or disappear. 
(You can’t change their order — you’d need to go back to Photoshop or 
Illustrator and change the layer order there.) Figure 17-3 shows the Layers 
pane for the Place PDF dialog box, but it looks the same in Place InDesign, 
and Import Options dialog boxes.
 
Although you can save an image file in the TIFF format and preserve any 
layers, InDesign doesn’t give you the ability to manage which layers you 
import from a TIFF file into InDesign.
The When Updating Link pop-up menu also has an option to control how 
changes to the file are handled in terms of layer management: If you choose 
Use Photoshop’s Layer Visibility or Use Illustrator’s Layer Visibility, InDesign 
makes all layers that are visible in Photoshop, InDesign, or Illustrator visible 
when you update the link to the graphic from InDesign. If you choose Keep 

292
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
Layer Visibility Overrides in the When Updating Link pop-up menu, InDesign 
imports only the layers chosen in this dialog box if you later update the 
graphic in Photoshop, InDesign, or Illustrator.
Working with layers after import
You may not know what layers you want visible when you import a graphic that 
has several layers. That’s okay. Just select the graphic in your layout and choose 
Object➪Object Layer Options. The Object Layer Options dialog box appears, 
with the same options as in the Layers pane described in the previous section.
Using the Object Layer Options dialog box, you can also change any layer 
visibility settings you made during import in the Layers pane of the Image 
Import Options dialog box.
Using Other Ways to Import Graphics
If you want to specify custom import options for an imported graphics file, 
you must use the Place command. However, if you don’t need this level of 
control, InDesign offers three other options for importing graphics:
 
 You can use your computer’s Copy (File➪Copy [Ô+C or Ctrl+C]) and 
Paste (File➪Paste [Ô+V or Ctrl+V]) commands to move a graphics file 
between two InDesign documents or from a document created with 
another program into an InDesign document. If you copy an object in an 
InDesign document and then paste it into a different InDesign document, 
the copy retains all the attributes of the original, as well as the link to the 
original graphics file. Otherwise, a link between the original graphics file 
and the InDesign document is not established; the graphic becomes part 
of the InDesign document, as though you created it using InDesign tools.
 
 You can drag and drop graphics file icons from your computer’s desk-
top into InDesign documents. A link between the original graphics file 
and the document is established, just as it would be if you had used the 
Place command.
 
 For Illustrator files, you can drag objects directly from Illustrator into 
InDesign. Each object becomes a separate, editable InDesign object, as 
though you had created it in InDesign. (And no links are established to 
the source file.)
If you use these methods to add a graphic to an InDesign document, some of 
the attributes of the original graphic may not survive the trip. The operating 
system, the file format, and the capabilities of the originating application all 
play roles in determining which attributes are preserved. If you want to be 
safe, use the Place command.

In This Chapter

 Using graphics in odd shapes
 Using clipping paths
A
fter you import a graphic into an InDesign document, you can modify 
either the graphic or the frame that contains it. The most common 
actions you’ll take are cropping, repositioning, and resizing. And if you want 
to get really fancy, you might work with clipping paths to create “masks” 
around picture portions or even cut the graphic into pieces.
Transformations such as resizing, flipping, rotating, and skewing that you’re 
likely to apply to graphics use the same tools for graphics as for any InDesign 
objects. So I cover all these transformations in one place, in Chapter 8.
 
In almost every case, you select graphics with the Direct Selection tool to 
work with the graphic itself, rather than to the frame. If you use the Selection 
tool, the work you do will apply to the frame, as Chapter 11 explains.
Cropping Graphics
Remember, when you import a graphic using the Place command (File➪Place 
[Ô+D or Ctrl+D]) or by dragging a graphics file into a document window 
(see Chapter 17), the graphic is contained in a graphics frame — either the 
frame that was selected when you placed the graphic or the frame that was 
automatically created if a frame wasn’t selected. The upper-left corner of an 
imported graphic is automatically placed in the upper-left corner of its frame.

294
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
Cropping is a fancy term for deciding what part of the picture to show by 
altering the dimensions of the frame holding the graphic. The easiest way to 
crop a graphic is to resize the frame that contains it using the Selection or 
Position tool. To discover how to resize the frame, go to Chapter 8. Note that 
resizing the frame does not resize the graphic.
The other way to crop a graphic is to leave its frame alone and instead move 
the graphic within the frame. (The advantage of moving the image within the 
frame is that you don’t have to move the frame from its desired position in 
the layout.) To do so, you have two options:
 
 Click on a graphic with the Direct Selection tool and then drag the 
graphic within its frame to reveal and conceal different parts of the 
graphic. For example, you can crop the top and left edges of a graphic 
by dragging the graphic above and to the left of its original position (in 
the upper-left corner of the frame).
 
 Use the X+ and Y+ fields in the Control panel and Transform panel, 
which let you determine precisely how much to move the graphic 
horizontally and vertically within its frame by entering specific values. 
Positive values move the graphic to the right or down relative to the 
frame, while negative values move it to the left or up relative to the 
frame. This method is more precise than using the mouse.
If you want to mask out (hide) portions of an imported graphic, you have the 
option of using an irregular shape as the frame, a graphic’s built-in clipping 
path (if it has one), or a clipping path you generated in InDesign, as covered 
in the last section of this chapter.
Figuring out the Fitting Commands
If you’ve placed a graphic in a frame that’s either larger or smaller than 
the graphic, you can use the Fitting options (available by choosing 
Object➪Fitting or by using the appropriate iconic buttons in the Control 
panel) to scale the graphic to fit the frame proportionately or disproportion-
ately or to scale the frame to fit the graphic. Another option lets you center 
the graphic in the frame. These options are very handy, and a lot easier than 
trying to resize a graphic or frame to fit using the mouse or the Control panel.
Keep in mind that the fitting commands for graphics are available only if 
you’ve used the Selection or Position tool to select a graphic’s frame. Here’s 
a description of each of the six options:

295
 Chapter 18: Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths
 
 Fit Content to Frame: To scale a graphic to fill the selected frame, 
choose Object➪Fitting➪Fit Content to Frame (Option+Ô+E or 
Ctrl+Alt+E). If the frame is larger than the graphic, the graphic is 
enlarged; if the frame is smaller, the graphic is reduced. If the graphic 
and the frame have different proportions, the graphic’s proportions are 
changed so that the image completely fills the frame — this Fit Content 
to Frame option can distort the graphic’s appearance.
 
 Fit Frame to Content: To resize a frame so that it wraps snugly around a 
graphic, choose Fit Frame to Content (Option+Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+C). The 
frame is enlarged or reduced depending on the size of the graphic, and 
the frame’s proportions are changed to match the proportions of the 
graphic.
 
 Center Content: To center a graphic in its frame, choose Center Content 
(Shift+Ô+E or Ctrl+Shift+E). Neither the frame nor the graphic is scaled 
when you center a graphic.
 
 Fit Content Proportionally: To scale a graphic to fit in the selected 
frame while maintaining the graphic’s current proportions, choose 
Object➪Fitting➪Fit Content Proportionally (Option+Shift+Ô+E or 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+E). If the frame is larger than the graphic, the graphic is 
enlarged; if the frame is smaller, the graphic is reduced. If the graphic 
and the frame have different proportions, a portion of the frame back-
ground shows above and below or to the left and right of the graphic. If 
you want, you can drag frame edges to make the frame shorter or 
narrower and eliminate any portions of the background that are visible.
 
 Fill Frame Proportionally: To resize a graphic so that it fills its 
frame on all sides, choose Object➪Fitting➪Fill Frame Proportionally 
(Option+Shift+Ô+C or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+C). Note that this option may crop 
out part of the image, so no gap appears between any part of the image 
and the frame. (By contrast, the Fit Frame to Content Proportionally 
option can result in extra space at the bottom and/or right sides of a 
graphic so that the entire graphic is visible.)
 
 Frame Fitting Options: To control the default fitting for newly placed 
graphics, use the Frame Fitting Options dialog box, shown in Figure 18-1. 
Here, you can set the amount of crop, choose the control point for the 
imported graphic (see Chapter 1), and automatically apply your choice 
of the Fit Content to Frame, Fit Content Proportionally, and Fill Frame 
Proportionally options.
 
For frames with strokes, the Fitting options align the outer edge of a graphic 
with the center of the stroke. A stroke obscures a strip along the graphic’s 
edge that’s half the width of the stroke. The wider the stroke, the more of the 
graphic that gets covered up.

You can also use the frame-fitting iconic buttons in the Control panel, shown 
in Figure 18-2. But note that these buttons may not display in your Control 
panel; by default, InDesign shows them only if your monitor is set to a reso-
lution whose width is 1,280 or more pixels. You can make room for them 
at smaller resolutions by customizing the Control panel display: Choose 
Customize from the panel’s flyout menu and then deselect some of the Object 
controls to make room.

Working with Graphics 
in Irregular Shapes
Although most graphics you use will be placed in rectangular frames, 
InDesign does give you other choices:
 
 You can select any type of frame — oval or polygonal, not just 
rectangular — to place or copy your graphic into.
 
 You can draw your own shape using the Pencil or Pen tool and then 
place or copy your graphic into it. When you create the free-form shape, 

297
 Chapter 18: Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths
make sure that the default color for the Pen tool is set to None so that 
the shape you create is transparent. Otherwise, the colored area in the 
shape will obscure the graphic behind it.
 
 The Pen tool lets you create one shape at a time. The Compound Paths 
command lets you combine multiple shapes to create more complex 
objects. For example, you can place a small circle on top of a larger 
circle and then use the Compound Paths command to create a doughnut-
shaped object. (This expert feature isn’t covered in this book.)
 
 If you copy the graphic into a frame or shape, you must use the Paste 
Into command (Edit➪Paste Into [Option+Ô+V or Ctrl+Alt+V]) to place 
the copied graphic inside the selected shape, rather than on top of it.
 
 You can use a clipping path that was defined in the graphic itself when it 
was created or a clipping path that was created in InDesign.
So what is a clipping path, anyway? A clipping path is used to mask certain 
parts of a graphic and reveal other parts; it’s basically an invisible outline 
placed in the graphic that InDesign can then work with. For example, if you 
want to create a silhouette around a single person in a crowd, open the file 
in an image-editing program, such as Photoshop, and then create and save 
a clipping path that isolates the shape of the person. (You can also erase 
everything except the person you want to silhouette; this approach can be 
time-consuming, and if you want to reveal other parts of the graphic later, 
you’re out of luck.) TIFF, Photoshop EPS, and Photoshop-native (.psd) files 
can have embedded clipping paths.
Regardless of the method you use to clip an imported graphic, you can 
modify a clipping path by moving, adding, deleting, and changing the direc-
tion of anchor points and by moving direction lines.
You can convert a clipping path — whether imported or created in InDesign — 
to a frame by choosing Convert Clipping Path to Frame for a selected object 
using the contextual menu (Control+click or right-click the object).
See the Photoshop For Dummies series (Wiley Publishing) for more on 
creating clipping paths in Photoshop.
Using a graphic’s own clipping path
In an ideal world, any graphics that you want to have fit in an irregular shape 
will come with their own clipping paths. But many don’t, so you need to 
create your own in InDesign, as described in the next section.
But for those graphics that do have their own clipping paths, you would first 
be sure to import the clipping path when you place the graphic and then use 
InDesign’s Text Wrap panel to access that clipping path.

298
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
The steps are easy:
 
1. Be sure to select the Show Import Options check box in the Place 
dialog box (File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]) when you import the graphic 
and select the Apply Photoshop Clipping Path option in the Image 
Import Options dialog box.
 
2. Open the Text Wrap panel (Window➪Text Wrap [Option+Ô+W or 
Ctrl+Alt+W]).
 
3. Select the graphic.
 
4. Click the Wrap Around Object Shape iconic button (the third one from 
the left) at the top of the Text Wrap panel.
 
5. If you want, adjust the space between the surrounding text and the 
obstructing shape by typing values in the Top Offset field.
 
6. Now select the clipping source from the Type pop-up menu in the 
Contour Options section of the Text Wrap panel. 
 
 Choose from two relevant options:
 
• Alpha Channel uses the image’s alpha channel, if any, to create 
a wrapping boundary. (An alpha channel is another type of clip-
ping path and is also created in the source program such as 
Photoshop.)
 
• Photoshop Path uses the image’s clipping path, if any, to create 
a wrapping boundary. Use the Path pop-up menu to select which 
path to use, if your image has more than one embedded clipping 
path.
See Chapter 11 for the basics of text wraps.
Creating a clipping path in InDesign
If you import a graphic that doesn’t have a clipping path, you have two sets 
of options for creating one.
The easiest is to use the Text Wrap panel as described in the previous 
section but to instead choose one of the following options from the Type 
pop-up menu:
 
 Detect Edges tries to determine the graphic’s outside boundary by 
ignoring white space. You’d use this option for bitmapped images that 
have a transparent or white background.
 
 Same as Clipping uses the clipping path for the graphic created in 
InDesign. You’d use this approach when the desired clipping path can’t 
be created through the Detect Edges option. (I cover this method of 
clipping-path creation shortly.)

299
 Chapter 18: Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths
You can further modify the clipping path by selecting the graphic with the 
Direct Selection tool. The text-wrap boundary appears as a blue line. You can 
make the boundary easier to select by setting offsets in the Text Wrap pane, 
which moves the boundary away from the frame edge.
A slightly more difficult way to create a clipping path — but one that gives 
you more control — is to use the Clipping Path command to generate one 
automatically:
 
1. Select the graphic to which you want to add a clipping path.
 
 Use the Direct Selection tool so that you can see the clipping path within 
the frame as you work.
 
2. Choose Object➪Clipping Path➪Options (Option+Shift+Ô+K or 
Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K).
 
 The Clipping Path dialog box appears, as shown in Figure 18-3.
 
3. To have InDesign detect the likely boundary of the image, as opposed 
to a white or other light background, choose Detect Edges from the 
Type pop-up menu.
 
 You can use the other options to select Alpha Channel or Photoshop 
Path as the clipping path for graphics that have one or more of these. 
(InDesign can only use one alpha channel or Photoshop path as the clip-
ping path, so use the Path pop-up menu to choose the one you want.)
 
4. Type a value in the Threshold field or click and drag the field’s slider 
to specify the value below which pixels will be placed outside the clip-
ping path shape (that is, pixels that will become transparent).
 
 Pixels darker than the Threshold value remain visible and thus are 
inside the clipping path shape. The lowest possible Threshold value (0) 
makes only white pixels transparent. As the value gets higher, less of the 
graphic remains visible. The lightest areas are removed first, then mid-
tones, and so on. (Select the Preview option to see the results of your 
changes without closing the dialog box.)

The Clipping 
Path dialog 
box and its 
effect on a 
graphic.
 

300
Part V: Graphics Essentials 
 
5. Type a value in the Tolerance field.
 
 This value determines how closely InDesign looks at variations in adja-
cent pixels when building a clipping path. Higher values produce a 
simpler, smoother path than lower values. Lower values create a more 
complicated, more exact path with more anchor points.
 
6. If you want to enlarge or reduce the size of the clipping path pro-
duced by the Threshold and Tolerance values, type a value in the 
Inset Frame field.
 
 Negative values enlarge the path; positive values shrink it. (The Inset 
Frame value is also applied to the path’s bounding box.)
 
7. Select the Invert option to switch the transparent and visible areas of 
the clipping path produced by the Threshold and Tolerance values.
 
8. If you want to include light areas in the perimeter shape InDesign 
generates based on the Threshold and Tolerance values, select the 
Include Inside Edges option.
 
 For example, if you have a graphic of a doughnut and you want to make 
the hole transparent (as well as the area around the outside of the 
doughnut), click Include Inside Edges. If you don’t click Include Inside 
Edges, InDesign builds a single shape (in the case of a doughnut, just the 
outside circle). The portion of the graphic in the shape remains visible; 
the rest of the graphic becomes transparent.
 
9. Select the Restrict to Frame option if you want InDesign to gener-
ate a clipping path from just the portion of the graphic visible in 
the graphic frame, as opposed to the entire graphic (such as if you 
cropped the graphic).
 
10. Select the Use High Resolution Image option if you want InDesign to 
use the high-resolution information in the original file instead of using 
the low-resolution proxy image.
 
 Even though using the high-resolution image takes longer, the resulting 
clipping path is more precise than it would be if you didn’t check Use 
High Resolution Image.
 
11. When you’ve finished specifying clipping path settings, click OK to 
close the dialog box and apply the settings to the selected graphic.
 
If you use the Clipping Path command to generate a clipping path for a graphic 
that has a built-in clipping path, the one that InDesign generates replaces the 
built-in path.

301
 Chapter 18: Fitting Graphics and Setting Paths
Figure 18-4 shows a graphic before and after a clipping path was applied to it 
using the Clipping Path command. At left is a graphic of coastal France with 
a graphic of a glider superimposed. At right is the same set of graphics, but 
with a clipping path applied to the glider so that the outside area is masked 
out, making it transparent.
 
Figure 18-4: 
A super-
imposed 
image 
before (left) 
and after 
applying 
a clipping 
path (right).
 
 
The Clipping Path command works very well for images that have a white or 
light background but no clipping path. It’s less useful for graphics with back-
grounds that contain a broad range of intermingling values.
You can remove a clipping path by choosing None as the Type in the 
Clipping Path dialog box. You can also select a different path — Detect Edges, 
Alpha Channel, Photoshop Path, or User-Modified Path — than was selected 
previously if you decide to change the current clipping path.
InDesign lets you convert a clipping path into a frame so that you get the 
exact shape as your clipping path to use as a container or silhouette in your 
layout. Select the clipping path with the Direct Selection tool and choose 
Object➪Clipping Path➪Convert Clipping Path to Frame. It’s as easy as that!

Working with Tabs and Tables
In This Chapter
 Working with tabs
 Setting up and adjusting tables
 Formatting tables directly and with styles
 Turning tabbed text to tables, and vice versa
P
erhaps the most common business-oriented formatting done in InDesign 
involves tabular material, whether financial tables or simple compara-
tive feature lists. InDesign provides two methods for creating tabular mate-
rial: old-fashioned tabs and more sophisticated tables. Although you can 
create tables with tabs, you have less control over the formatting and thus 
can create just basic tables when you use tabs. On the other hand, for simple 
tables, using tabs is often the faster method. So don’t feel you should never 
use tabs — but do be sure that when you mix methods that you don’t let 
visual consistency suffer as a result.
Tabs and tables in InDesign work somewhat like the same functions in 
Microsoft Word, so if you’re familiar with Word’s tabs and tables, you’ll have 
a quick adjustment to InDesign’s, at least for the basic capabilities.
Setting Tabs
To set tabs in InDesign, you use the Tabs panel, which floats above your text 
so that you can keep it open until you’re finished experimenting with tabs. To 
open the Tabs panel, choose Type➪Tabs (Shift+Ô+T or Ctrl+Shift+T). Figure 19-1 
shows the Tabs panel along with a simple table created using one tab stop. 
 
You can also set up tabs in the Tabs pane of the New Paragraph Styles and 
Paragraph Style Options dialog boxes, so tabs are consistently applied to all 
paragraphs. Chapter 13 covers styles in more detail.

306
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
 
Figure 19-1: 
The Tabs 
panel, its 
flyout menu, 
and a table 
created 
using tab 
settings.
 
Four buttons — Left, Center, Right, and Align On — on the Tabs panel let 
you control how the text aligns with the tab you’re creating. The Align On 
option is usually used for decimal tabs, which means that a period in the text 
aligns on the tab stop. But you can align on any character, not just periods — 
simply specify the align-on character in the Align On field. (If you enter noth-
ing in the Align On field, InDesign assumes that you want to align to periods.) 
If the Align On field isn’t visible in the Tabs panel, just widen the panel by 
dragging one of its sides so that the field displays.
The X: field of the Tabs panel lets you specify a position for a new tab stop. 
You can type a value in this field in 0.01-point increments and then press 
Shift+Enter or Shift+Return to create a tab. InDesign positions tabs relative to 
the left edge of the text frame or column.
Rather than typing values in the X: field, you can position tabs by clicking at 
the desired location on the ruler at the bottom of the Tabs panel. You can also 
drag tab stops within the ruler to change their position. And you can reposi-
tion left and right indents and indent hangs using the arrow sliders on the tab 
ruler. (The arrow sliders have the same effects as changing indents using the 
Paragraph panel or Paragraph Styles panel, as explained in Chapter 14.)
 
To have the Tabs panel “snap” to your text frame so that you can see exactly 
where the tab stops will be, click the Position Panel Above Text Frame iconic 
button (the magnet icon).
 
If you need a tab flush with the right margin — for example, to position a 
dingbat at the end of the story — press Shift+Tab. You don’t need to use the 
Tabs panel. 
InDesign lets you specify up to eight characters, including special characters, 
that will repeat to fill any white space. These repeating characters are called 
leaders. When you set a leader for a tab stop, the leaders actually fill any 
space prior to that tab stop (between the previous text and the tab location). 

307
 Chapter 19: Working with Tabs and Tables
To spread out the leader characters, type spaces between the characters you 
enter. Don’t enter spaces before and after a single character, though, as that 
will result in two spaces between the characters when the pattern repeats 
(unless that’s the look you’re going for).
In addition to setting tabs in the Tabs panel, InDesign provides four 
additional options through its flyout menu: Clear All, Delete Tab, Repeat Tab, 
and Reset Indents.
 
 The Clear All command deletes any tabs you’ve created, and any text 
positioned with tabs reverts to the position of the default tab stops. 
(You can delete an individual tab stop by dragging its icon off the ruler.)
 
 The Delete Tab command deletes the currently selected tab. (Just click 
it in the tab ruler.)
 
 You can also delete tabs by dragging them off the tab ruler using the 
mouse.
 
 The Repeat Tab command lets you create a string of tabs across the 
ruler that are all the same distance apart. When you select a tab on 
the ruler and choose this command, InDesign measures the distance 
between the selected tab and the previous tab (or, if it’s the first tab on 
the ruler, the distance between the selected tab and the left indent/text 
inset). The program then uses this distance to place new tabs, with the 
same alignment, all the way across the ruler. InDesign repeats tabs only 
to the right of the selected tab, but it inserts tabs between other tab 
stops.
 
 The Reset Indents command removes any changes to the left indent, 
right indent, or indent hang settings made in the Tabs panel using the 
arrow sliders, and reverts to the indents defined in the paragraph style 
currently applied to the text.
Setting Up Tables
You can create tables using tabs, but the more complex the table, the more 
work that requires. So make your life easier and use InDesign’s table editor, 
which lets you specify almost any attribute imaginable in a table through the 
Table panel and the Table menu.
 
InDesign lets you import tables from Microsoft Word, RTF, and Microsoft 
Excel files, including some of their cell formatting. Likewise, you can convert 
their tables to tabbed text by using the options in the Import Options dialog 
box that is accessible when you place a file through the Place dialog box 
(File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]), as covered in Chapter 11.

InDesign CS4’s tables now support three features that previous versions 
neglected: 
 
 You can now insert notes into tables (an expert feature not covered in 
this book).
 
 Changes you make in tables display as tracked changes in the compan-

 You can now edit tables’ contents in the Story Editor view (see Chapter 12).
To create a table in InDesign:
 
1. Create or select a text frame with the Type tool and then choose 
Table➪Insert Table (Option+Shift+Ô+T or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T). 
 
 If you select an existing text frame, the table is inserted at the cursor’s 
location in the existing text.
 
 The Insert Table dialog box appears. 
 
2. Type the number of body rows and columns and the number of 
header and footer rows.
 
 Header and footer rows repeat on each page for tables that go across 
multiple pages.
 
3. Click OK to have InDesign create the basic table.
 
 The table is set as wide as the text frame. The depth is based on the 
number of rows, with each row defaulting to the height that will hold 
12-point text.
You can also apply a table style to the new table by selecting one from the 
Table Style pop-up menu. I cover how to create these styles in the “Using 
table and cell styles” section, later in this chapter.
With the basic table in place, you now format it using the Table panel and 
the Table menu. In both, you can increase or decrease the number of rows 
and columns, set the row and column height, set the text’s vertical alignment 
within selected cells (top, middle, bottom, and justified), choose one of four 
text-rotation angles, and set the text margin within a cell separately for the 
top, bottom, left, and right. Note that all the Table panel’s options affect only 
the currently selected cells, except for the Number of Rows and Number of 
Columns fields. Figure 19-2 shows the Table panel and its flyout menu, as well 
as an example table created using these tools.

 Chapter 19: Working with Tabs and Tables
 
If you have a smallish monitor, set at 1024 by 768 pixels — the norm for a 
17-inch display — the Table, Table Styles, and Cell Styles panels may be 
shoved to the bottom of the panel dock, and, when they’re selected, the only 
thing you see is their panel tab and flyout menu icon. You have a few choices: 
Shorten other panel groups in the dock to make room for them, remove other 
panel groups to make room for them, or drag them out of the dock and make 
them floating.
 
Figure 19-2:

panel and

You set cell text’s horizontal alignment using the paragraph formatting con-
trols (see Chapter 14). You can apply character formatting to cell text (see 
Chapter 15). You can also apply tabs within cells using the Tabs panel covered 
in the “Setting Tabs” section of this chapter.
To add items to a table, you can type text in any cell, paste text or graphics 
into a cell, or place text or graphics into a cell by choosing File➪Place (Ô+D 
or Ctrl+D). Note that any tabbed text pasted into a cell retains the tabs, with 
all the text pasted into the same cell — InDesign doesn’t look at those tabs 
and assume that you wanted the tabbed text converted into multiple cells. 
 
To insert a tab character into a table cell, don’t press Tab — that just 
advances you to the next cell. Instead, choose Type➪Insert Special 
Character➪Other➪Tab.

Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
Adjusting tables
InDesign lets you add and delete rows and columns, as well as split and join 
cells using the Insert, Delete, Merge, and Split commands in the Table menu 
and in the Table panel’s flyout menu. You can also select rows, columns, and 
entire tables using the Table menu. Several shortcuts, shown in Table 19-1, 
speed things along if you’re a keyboard-oriented person.
These commands work intuitively, so I won’t bore you with detailed expla-
nations here. For example, to delete a row, select it or a cell within it using 
the Type tool and then choose Table➪Delete➪Row. To split a cell vertically, 
select the cell and choose Table➪Split Cell Vertically. You get the idea.

Formatting tables
For more sophisticated table attributes, use the Table Options dialog box 
and its five panes. (Choose Table➪Table Options and then the desired pane 
from the submenu. To go straight to the Table Setup pane, you can also just 
press Option+Shift+Ô+B or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+B.) You see the Table Setup pane, 
shown in Figure 19-3. If you want to go straight to one of the four other panes, 
you can do so by choosing the desired pane in the submenu after choosing 
Table➪Table Options.
 
When formatting tables, take advantage of the Preview option in most dialog 
boxes to see the effects of your changes before committing to them.

311
 Chapter 19: Working with Tabs and Tables
 
 
 
 
If you select more than one cell — meaning the entire cell, not just some of its 
contents — the Control panel’s options change to display many of the con-
trols available in the Table panel, as well as some cell-oriented controls, such 
as setting cell boundary line weights and line types.
Here are some of the basics to keep in mind:
 
 The Table Setup pane lets you change the number of rows and columns, 
as well as footer rows and columns. You also can specify the table 
border, color, line type, and even tint. Use the Table Spacing options to 
have space automatically added before and after a table that is in the 
same text frame as other text.
 
 The Row Strokes pane lets you decide how often rows have an alter-
nating pattern of strokes applied to them. For example, you may want 
every third row to have a thicker stroke than the first and second rows, 
because each set of three rows is related to each other and the third 
row marks the end of that set. You choose how many rows you want 
the special stroke to skip before being applied in the Alternating Pattern 
pop-up menu and then use the rest of the controls to choose the stroke 
weight, color, type, and so on.
 
 The Column Strokes pane works just like the Row Strokes pane, except it 
lets you alternate the strokes across columns rather than rows.
Figure 19-3: 
The Table 
Setup pane 
of the Table 
Options 
dialog box.

312
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
 
 The Fills pane (shown in Figure 19-4) works like the Row Strokes pane 
and Column Strokes pane, except that it applies a fill to the cells in the 
specified series of rows or columns. The reason that there is just one 
pane for fills but two for strokes is that you can’t have both row fills 
and column fills automatically applied to the same table — that would 
usually make for a hard-to-read checkerboard. Of course, you can use 
horizontal fills to accentuate rows and use strokes on columns to help 
keep them visually separate.
 
 The Headers and Footers pane lets you change the number of header 
and footer rows — just like the Table Setup pane — but it also lets you 
control how often the header and/or footer rows repeat: Every Text 
Column, Once Per Frame, or Once Per Page.
 
Figure 19-4: 
The Fills 
pane of 
the Table 
Options 
dialog box.
 
InDesign also provides formatting controls over cells, using the Cell Options 
dialog box. (Choose Table➪Cell Options and then one of the four desired 
panes: Text, Strokes and Fills, Rows and Columns, and Diagonal Lines. You 
can go straight to the Text pane by pressing Option+Ô+B or Ctrl+Alt+B.) 
After you selected the cells you want to format, use the various panes as 
desired:
 
 The Text pane works very much like the General pane of the Text Frame 
Options dialog box (see Chapter 14). Here, you set how far text is inset 
from the cell boundaries, how text is vertically aligned within the cell, 
and where the text baseline begins within the cell. Unique to cells, you 
can also specify whether the cell grows to fit the text automatically (by 
unchecking Clip Contents to Cell) and the degree of text rotation (0, 90, 
180, and 270 degrees).

313
 Chapter 19: Working with Tabs and Tables
 
 The Strokes and Fills pane, shown in Figure 19-5, lets you set the stroke 
and fill for selected cells. You can select which cell boundaries to apply 
a stroke to, by selecting the sides from the preview image at the top of 
the pane and then choosing the desired options. You can also set the 
desired fill color and tint. 
 
Figure 19-5: 
The Strokes 
and Fills 
pane of the 
Cell Options 
dialog box.
 
 
 The Rows and Columns pane lets you set the row height, including its 
maximum for rows that are allowed to expand automatically as speci-
fied in the Text pane, as well as the column width. You also can specify 
which rows must be kept together and if certain rows should start at a 
new page, frame, or column.
 
 You can also adjust column and row heights by dragging on the row and 
column boundaries with the mouse.
 
 The Diagonal Lines pane lets you place three types of diagonal lines within 
cells — upper left to lower right, lower right to upper left, or both — and 
then specify the stroke weight, type, color, and tint. You can also choose 
whether the diagonal lines overprint the cell contents or vice versa. To 
remove a diagonal line, just click the No Diagonal Lines iconic button.
Using table and cell styles
To make it easy to apply and update table formatting across a document, 
InDesign lets you create and apply table and cell styles. They work like para-
graph, character, and object styles, taking the table formatting features cov-
ered in the previous section and bringing them together into the New Table 
Style and New Cell Style dialog boxes.

314
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
To work with table styles, open the Table Styles panel by choosing 
Window➪Type & Tables➪Table Styles. To work with cell styles, open the Cell 
Styles panel by choosing Window➪Type & Tables➪Cell Styles. Choose New 
Table Style or New Cell Style from the appropriate panel’s flyout menu and 
then use the various panes to specify the desired formatting. The panes, and 
their options, are the same as described in the previous section, “Formatting 
tables.” Figure 19-6 shows the New Table Style dialog box’s General pane. 
 
Whether creating a new table style or a new cell style, the easiest method is to 
format an existing table or cell the way you want it, select it, and then create 
a new table or cell style — InDesign picks up the existing formatting for the 
new style. Otherwise, you have to specify everything in the New Table Style or 
New Cell Style dialog box, where it’s harder to see the effects of your settings. 
(Even if you enable the Preview option, the dialog boxes are fairly large and 
tend to obscure most of your document.)
 
Figure 19-6: 
The General 
pane of the 
New Table 
Styles 
dialog box.
 
Keep in mind a few notes about creating table and cell styles — in the 
General pane of the New Table Style and New Cell Style dialog boxes — that 
you should know before getting too far into them:
 
 You give each style its own name. Choose names that will make sense a 
week or a month later so that you know what they’re meant to be used for!
 
 You can base a new table style on an existing one, so changes to the 
parent style are automatically reflected in the children styles based on it.
 
 You can assign a keyboard shortcut to styles you use frequently.
When creating table styles, you can also have the table style automatically 
apply the cell styles of your choosing to the following table elements: header 
rows, footer rows, body rows, the leftmost column, and the rightmost column.
When creating cell styles, you can choose a paragraph style to be automati-
cally applied to text in cells using the style.

315
 Chapter 19: Working with Tabs and Tables
To apply styles to selected tables or cells, just choose the desired style from 
the Table Style or Cell Style panel. To override existing formatting, use the 
options indicated for paragraph and character styles described in Chapter 13.
Modifying and managing 
table and cell styles
To modifying styles, just double-click the style name in the Table Styles or 
Cell Styles panel to open the Table Style Options or Cell Style Options dialog 
box, which is identical to the New Table Styles or New Cell Styles dialog box 
explained in the previous section. Make your changes, click OK, and your 
styles and all tables and cells using them are instantly updated!
InDesign also lets you manage your styles, such as creating groups of styles 
to keep them better organized, and bringing in styles from other documents. 
Because these features work the same for paragraph and character styles as 
well, I cover them in Chapter 13. 
Converting Tabs to Tables (and Back)
Often, you’ll have a table done using tabs — whether imported from a word 
processor or originally created in InDesign with tabs — that you want to con-
vert to a real InDesign table. All you have to do is select the tabbed text you 
want to convert using the Type tool and choose Table➪Convert Text to Table.
In the Convert Text to Table dialog box, you can choose a Column Separator 
(Tab, Comma, Paragraph, or a text string you type in the field) or a Row 
Separator (same options). Although most textual data uses tabs to separate 
columns and paragraphs to separate rows, you may encounter other data 
that uses something else. For example, spreadsheets and databases often 
save data so that commas, rather than tabs, separate columns. That’s why 
InDesign lets you choose the separator characters before conversion.
During the conversion, InDesign formats the table using the standard set-
tings, using the current text formatting and the default cell insets and 
stroke types. You can then adjust the table using the tools covered in the 
“Formatting tables” section, earlier in this chapter. Note that the conversion 
treats all rows as body rows.
You can also convert a table to text by selecting multiple cells or an entire 
table and choosing Table➪Convert Table to Text. InDesign presents the same 
options as it does in the Convert Text to Table dialog box so that you can 
determine how the converted data appears.

Working with Footnotes, 
Indexes, and TOCs
In This Chapter
 Keeping track of details with footnotes
 Adding indexes
 Generating tables of contents
M
any business documents — books, reports, white papers, and so 
on — use features traditionally associated with academic book pub-
lishing: footnotes to cite sources, indexes to provide a map to specific con-
tent’s location in the document, and tables of contents (TOCs) to provide an 
overview of the document’s structure and contents.
When you’re working on any type of document — a report, a magazine, a 
textbook — you can easily spend more time manually creating tables of con-
tents, keeping footnotes updates, and laboriously managing indexes than you 
spend designing the publication. InDesign helps reduce this labor while also 
ensuring that your footnotes, indexes, and tables of content stay automati-
cally updated as your document is revised.
 
You can extend the power of these tools to book-length projects composed of 
multiple InDesign documents (see Chapter 22), creating consistent indexing 
and tables of contents in one fell swoop.
Adding Footnotes
Many documents, including academic and technical documents, use foot-
notes. InDesign lets you add footnotes to your document with very little fuss.

318
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
You can import footnotes from Microsoft Word files (see Chapter 11), or you 
can add footnotes directly in InDesign. With the text-insertion cursor in your 
text where you want the footnote marker to appear, choose Type➪Insert 
Footnote to add a footnote to the bottom of the column that contains the 
footnote marker, as shown in Figure 20-1. You need to manually enter the text 
that will go with each numbered footnote, but InDesign updates the footnote 
numbering as you add and delete footnotes.
 
You can’t insert footnotes into tables. But you can simulate footnotes by 
adding a superscripted footnote character in the table text and typing your 
footnote text below the table — note this “footnote” isn’t linked to the text, 
doesn’t renumber automatically as a real footnote would, and can’t be format-
ted with InDesign’s footnote formatting controls.
 
Figure 20-1: 
Inserting 
a footnote 
(shown 
below the 
table).
 
You can control much of the appearance of footnotes by choosing 
Type➪Document Footnote Options to open the Footnote Options dialog box, 
shown in Figure 20-2.
The Numbering and Formatting pane controls the formatting of the footnote text 
and footnote character in the current InDesign document. The Layout pane con-
trols the placement of the footnote relative to the rest of the document.

319
 Chapter 20: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs
 
Figure 20-2: 
The 
Footnote 
Options 
dialog box 
contains 
two panes: 
Numbering 
and 
Formatting 
and Layout.
 
Among the features you should note in the Numbering and Formatting pane are
 
 Choose the numbering style — such as 1, 2, 3, 4 … or I, ii, iii, iv … — via 
the Style pop-up menu.
 
 Control whether the footnote numbers start anew (such as at the begin-
ning of a section) or continue from the previous number via the Start At 
field.
 
 Control whether numbering automatically resets every page, spread, or 
section via the Restart Numbering Every pop-up menu.
 
 Add a prefix and/or suffix to your footnote numbers via the Prefix and 
Suffix fields. Note the unnamed pop-up menus that let you add special 
characters such as a thin space or bracket.
 
 Use the Position and Character Style options in the Footnote Reference 
Number in Text subsection to determine how the footnote characters 
appear in text.
 
 Similarly, use the Paragraph Style and Separator options in the Footnote 
Formatting subsection to determine how the footnote text appears. 
(Note that any Separator options will display after any Suffix options 
chosen.)
Among the features to note in the Layout pane are
 
 Set the preferred spacing for the footnote text in the Spacing Options 
section.

320
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
 
 Convert Word’s endnotes (which appear at the end of a story) to 
InDesign footnotes (which appear in the column or page that the foot-
note reference occurs in) by checking the Place End of Story Footnotes 
at Bottom of Text option.
 
 Control whether footnotes can break across columns via the Allow Split 
Footnotes option. Enabling this option can improve the layout when you 
have long footnotes that otherwise eat up a column of text.
 
 Control the ruling line above footnotes using the Rule Above options. 
They work like the paragraph rules (see Chapter 14).
 
To change these settings for future documents, open the dialog box while no 
document is open and set your new defaults.
Creating Indexes
When trying to locate information in a book, nothing is as wonderful as a 
good index. Once upon a time, book indexing was a labor-intensive process 
involving piles of index cards. InDesign makes indexing much easier, while 
still allowing you to make key decisions about how the index is formatted.
But be warned: Indexing is complicated business and is, by and large, an 
expert feature. I cover just the basics here.
Choosing an indexing style
Before you begin indexing your document, ask yourself the following questions:
 
 Do you want to initial-cap all levels of all entries, or do you just want 
sentence case?
 
 Should index headings appear in boldface?
 
 What type of punctuation will you use in your index?
 
 Will you capitalize secondary entries in the index?
 
 Should the index be nested or run-in style? (A nested index is an 
indented list, with each entry on its own line. A run-in index puts all 
related entries in one paragraph, separated by semicolons.)
After you make these decisions, making a small dummy index is a good idea. 
From the dummy, create a master page for index pages, paragraph styles 
for index headings (the letters A, B, C, and so on), paragraph styles for each 
level of the index (including indents as appropriate), and character styles for 
any special formatting you want on page numbers or cross-reference text. 
InDesign doesn’t do any of these tasks for you.

321
 Chapter 20: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs
Inside the Index panel
When you want to index a chapter or document, open the Index panel by 
choosing Window➪Type & Tables➪Index (Shift+F8). Use this panel to add 
words to the index in up to four indent levels, edit or delete index entries, or 
create cross-references. The Index panel is shown in Figure 20-3.
 
Figure 20-3: 
At left: the 
Index panel 
and its 
flyout menu. 
At right: the 
New Page 
Reference 
dialog box.
 
Two radio buttons appear at the top of the Index panel: Reference and 
Topic. You use Reference mode to add and edit entries from selected text. 
(Although it’s a well-intentioned feature meant to help standardize index 
entries, the Topic mode’s use isn’t intuitive, and most indexers simply ignore 
it and add entries manually from selected text or type phrases into the Index 
panel in Reference mode. You should ignore it, too.)
 
Select the Book check box if you’re creating an index for multiple chapters in a 
book (see Chapter 22). You must have a book open for this option to be avail-
able. If you have a book open and don’t select the Book check box, the index is 
saved with the current document and not opened when you open other chap-
ters of the book.
Adding index items via the Index panel
To add entries to the index, be sure the Type tool is active and then choose 
New Page Reference from the Index panel’s flyout menu (Ô+7 or Ctrl+7) to 
get the dialog box shown in Figure 20-3.
 
The shortcut for New Page Reference has changed in InDesign CS4 to Ô+7 
or Ctrl+7. The previous shortcut, Ô+U or Ctrl+U, now toggles smart guides, 
which Chapter 10 covers.

322
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
 
If the Type tool isn’t active when you open the dialog box, the flyout menu 
option is called New Cross-Reference instead, letting you add a cross-
reference entry to the index. The resulting New Cross-Reference dialog box 
is identical to the New Page Reference dialog box, except the various options 
default to ones appropriate for a cross-reference.
Here’s how the controls work:
 
 If you selected text first in your document, the text is entered automati-
cally into Topic Level 1. Otherwise, type the text that you want to add 
to the index. In Figure 20-3, you can see that I typed Colors. The text is 
added to the Topic list and to the list of index entries.
 
 You can enter text that controls how the entry is sorted in the Sort By 
column. For example, if the selected text you’re indexing is The X-Files, 
but you want it sorted as if it were X-Files, The (so it appears with the X 
entries in the index), enter X-Files, The in the Sorted By column. This 
technique is also handy for names, such as indexing Barack Obama as 
Obama, Barack by entering Obama, Barack in the Sorted By column.
 
 If you want a more complex index, you may want to use some or all of 
the four possible entry levels. You may want an index entry to appear 
under a higher-level topic. For example, you may want Border Collies 
to appear in the index under Herding Dogs, in which case you’d enter 
Herding Dogs in the Topic Level 1 field and Border Collies in the Topic 
Level 2 field. Or you may want Collies in the Topic Level 1 field and then 
Border in the Topic Level 2 field, because you plan on listing the differ-
ent varieties of collies under one Level 1 index entry, with the varieties 
listed within that entry as Level 2 subentries. In Figure 20-3, I entered 
subtractive in the Topic Level 2 field.
 
 Use the Type pop-up menu to determine the page entries for the index 
entry. For example, if you select To End of Section, the page numbers for 
the selected text in the index cover the range from the index entry to the 
end of the section it’s in.
 
 To add just the selected text as an index entry, click Add. (If no text is 
selected, the text is added to the Topic list, but no index entry appears 
for it.) To add all occurrences of the text in the book, click Add All.
 
 To change previously defined index entries, select an entry and then 
choose Page Reference Options in the Index panel’s flyout menu.
 
 At the bottom of the New Page Reference dialog box is a list of letters as 
well as the entry Symbols (where entries that begin with numbers and 
other nonletter characters will be grouped in the index). You can scroll 
through this list of headings to see what is already in the index under 
each letter. Although you may think clicking a letter would force the 
current index entry to appear in that letter’s section of the index, it 
doesn’t.

323
 Chapter 20: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs
 
To quickly add a word or text selection to an index, highlight the text and 
press Ô+7 or Ctrl+7 to add the text to the New Page Reference dialog box. To 
index a word without opening that dialog box, just press Option+Shift+Ô+[ 
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+[. This shortcut adds the text to the index using the index’s 
default settings. (You can always edit them later.) And to enter an index entry 
such as Barack Obama as a proper name (last name, first name, or Obama, 
Barack in this example), use the shortcut Option+Shift+Ô+] or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+].
Polishing and generating the index
The Index panel’s flyout menu has several options useful for generating and 
fine-tuning an index:
 
 Duplicate Topic lets you duplicate a topic entry so that you can use the 
settings from one entry without having to re-enter those settings in a 
new entry.
 
 Delete Topic removes a topic (and any associated entries) from the index.
 
 Import Topics lets you import topic lists from other InDesign documents.
 
 Go to Selected Marker causes InDesign to jump to the text that contains 
the selected index entry in the Index panel.
 
 Topic Options lets you edit the Level and Sort By settings for topic 
entries; these settings affect all index entries that use them.
 
 Capitalize lets you standardize the capitalization of topic entries — you 
can choose Selected Topic, Selected Topic and All Subtopics, All Level 1 
Topics, and All Topics.
 
 Update Preview updates the index entries in the Index panel to reflect 
page-number changes, new occurrences of index text occurrences, and 
deleted occurrences of indexed text.
 
 Generate Index creates the index via the dialog box shown in Figure 
20-4. In this dialog box, you specify the following: a title for the index, 
the paragraph style for that title, whether a selected index is replaced 
with the new one, whether an entire book is indexed, whether text on 
hidden layers is indexed, whether the index is nested or run-in, whether 
empty index headings and sections are included, what paragraph 
styles are applied to each level of index entry, what character styles 
are applied to different portions of index entries, and which characters 
will be used as separators within index entries. (Click the More Options 
button to see the nested/run-in and later options.) 
 
 After you generate an index, you get the standard InDesign loaded-text 
icon (the paragraph icon); click an existing text frame into which you 
want to flow the index, or click anywhere else in a document to have 
InDesign create the text frame for you and flow the index text into it.

Creating Tables of Contents
A table of contents (TOC) is useful in a long document because it helps read-
ers locate information quickly. A TOC is simply a list of paragraphs that are 
formatted with the same styles. This dependence on styles means that if 
you want to use the table of contents feature, you have to use paragraph 
styles. Not only do styles guarantee consistent formatting, but they also tell 
InDesign what text you want to include in your TOC.
After you create a book (or even a single document), InDesign can build a 
table of contents by scanning pages for the paragraph styles you specify. For 
example, if you create a book, you might use paragraph styles named Chapter 
Title, Section, and Subsection. Using the table of contents feature, InDesign 
can generate a table of contents that includes all three levels.
TOC styles manage the text that you want in a table of contents, the order in 
which it appears, how page numbers are added, and how the various TOC 
elements are formatted. To create a TOC style, choose Layout➪Table of 
Contents Styles.
In the Table of Contents Styles dialog box, click New to create a new TOC 
style. You can also edit an existing TOC style via the Edit button, delete one 
via the Delete button, and import one from another InDesign document via 
the Load button.
Here’s how to create a TOC style after clicking the New button:
 
1. Enter a name for the TOC style in the TOC Style field (shown in 
Figure 20-5).
 
 The default is TOC Style 1.

2. In the Title field, enter a heading for the TOC.
 
 This text appears in your table of contents.
 
 If you don’t want a title, leave the Title field blank, but note that you still 
get an empty paragraph at the top of your TOC for this title. You can 
always delete that paragraph.
 
3. Use the Style pop-up menu to choose the paragraph style that this title 
will have.
 
4. In the Styles in Table of Contents section, click a paragraph style that 
you want to appear in your TOC from the Other Styles list at right.
 
 For example, you might click Chapter Title.
 
5. Click Add to add it to the Include Paragraph Styles list at left. 
 
 Select a style from the Include Paragraph Styles section and click 
Remove to remove any paragraph styles you don’t want to be used in 
the TOC.
 
6. Repeat Steps 4 and 5 until you have added all the paragraph styles 
that you want to include in the TOC.
 
7. Use the Entry Style pop-up menu to select a TOC level and then choose 
the paragraph formatting for that style.
 
 If the Entry Style, Page Number, and other options don’t display, click 
the More Options button to see them.
 
• Use the Page Number pop-up menu to determine how page num-
bers are handled: After Entry, Before Entry, and No Page Number. 
If you want the page numbers to have a character style applied, 
choose that style from the Style pop-up menu to the right of the 
Page Number pop-up menu.

• Use the Between Entry and Number field and pop-up menu to 
choose what appears between the TOC text and the page number. 
You can enter any characters you want; use the pop-up menu to 
select special characters such as bullets and tabs. In most cases, 
you should select a tab; the paragraph style selected earlier for 
the TOC entry includes leader information, such as having a string 
of periods between the text and the number. You can also apply 
a character style to the characters between the text and the page 
numbers via the Style pop-up menu at right.
 
• To sort entries at this level alphabetically, such as for a list of 
products in a brochure, select the Sort Entries in Alphabetical 
Order check box.
 
• To change the level of the current TOC entry, use the Level pop-up 
menu. If you change the level of entries, InDesign correctly sorts 
them when it creates the TOC, even if the levels seem out of order 
in the Include Paragraph Styles list.
 
• In the Options section of the dialog box, choose the appropri-
ate options. Check Create PDF Bookmarks if you’re exporting the 
document to PDF format and want the PDF TOC file to have book-
marks (a clickable set of TOC links). Check Run-in if you want all 
entries at the same level to be in one paragraph. (This option isn’t 
common for TOCs, but it’s used in indexes and lists of figures.) 
Check Replace Existing Table of Contents if you want InDesign to 
automatically replace an existing TOC if the TOC style is changed. 
Check Include Text on Hidden Layers if you want text on hidden 
layers to be included in the TOC. Check Include Book Documents 
if you have a book open and want InDesign to generate a TOC 
based on all chapters in that book. (InDesign shows the current 
open book’s name.) Finally, control whether numbers are included 
in the table of contents for numbered paragraphs using the new 
Numbered Paragraphs pop-up menu.
 
8. Continue this process for each paragraph style whose text should be 
in the TOC.
 
 Note that the order in which you add these styles determines the initial 
levels: The first paragraph style added is level 1; the second is level 2, 
and so on. But you can change the order by changing the Level setting, 
as described in Step 7. 
 
 
You can also reorder the paragraph styles by dragging them up and down 
in the list — but this doesn’t change their levels and thus won’t change 
the order in which they are sorted in the TOC. All it does is change the 
order you see them in the dialog box. 

327
 Chapter 20: Working with Footnotes, Indexes, and TOCs
To make changes to a TOC style, go to the Edit Table of Contents Style dialog 
box. Choose Layout➪Table of Contents Styles, select the TOC style to edit, 
and click Edit.
With a TOC style in place and your document properly formatted with the 
paragraph styles that the TOC style will look for when generating a TOC, 
you’re ready to have InDesign create the actual TOC for you.
To generate a TOC, choose Layout➪Table of Contents. You get a dialog box 
that is identical to the New Table of Contents Style dialog box, shown in 
Figure 20-5. In this dialog box, you can make changes to the TOC style set-
tings. (If you want to save those TOC style changes, be sure to click the Save 
Style button.) Then click OK to have InDesign generate the TOC. You might 
also get a dialog box asking whether you want to include items in overset text 
(text that didn’t fit in your document after you placed it) in your TOC. It may 
take a minute or two for the program to generate the TOC. (See Chapter 12 
for more details on overset text.)
 
Be sure you allow enough space (a single text frame, a series of linked text 
frames, or one or more empty pages) for the TOC before generating a final 
TOC because if you end up adding or deleting pages based on the TOC length, 
the TOC will display the old page numbers. To update page numbering after 
flowing a TOC, simply rebuild the TOC by selecting the text frame holding the 
TOC and then choosing Layout➪Update Table of Contents.
If you select a text frame, InDesign places the TOC text in it when you gener-
ate the TOC. If you don’t select a text frame, you see the familiar loaded-text 
icon (the paragraph pointer) that you see when you place a text file. Click 
a text frame to insert the TOC text in that frame or click in an empty part of 
your document to create a text frame in which the TOC text will flow.
 
The feature that creates a TOC is actually a list generator, and you can use 
it to create other kinds of lists. Basically, anything that is tagged with a para-
graph style can be used to create a list. For example, if your figure captions all 
use their own paragraph style (called Caption Title in this example), you can 
generate a list of figures by creating a TOC style that includes just the Caption 
Title paragraph style. An InDesign document can have more than one TOC so 
that you can include multiple lists in your document.

Chapter 21
Working with Automatic Text
In This Chapter
 Setting up automatic page numbers
 Working with section markers
 Setting up text variables
 Handling conditional text
A
key area of improvement over the years in InDesign is the increased use 
of automated text. From the very beginning, InDesign offered automatic 
page numbers so that your folios and cross-references would reflect the cur-
rent pages as your layout changed. Later versions enhanced this capability 
with section markers, which let you create variable names in folios for your 
section titles. Still later came the ability to use data files and merge their con-
tents into a layout to customize your output, similar to how word processors 
let you customize labels with their mail-merge feature. The newest version of 
InDesign adds to this mix a new option: variable text, which gives you more 
flexibility in where and how you can have InDesign update text automatically 
throughout a document based on your specifications.
Altogether, these features have helped InDesign stake significant ground 
in reducing the labor and time of manual processes, such as searching and 
replacing for text that changes predictably throughout the document.
 
Another type of text variable is the cross-reference, which can insert the page 
number or other text for you (such as See page 227 or Learn how color works 
in the “All about Color” chapter). InDesign CS4 now supports such automated 
cross-references. It also retains those cross-references imported from Word 
files. Because InDesign’s cross-references capability uses the hyperlinks func-
tionality, I cover this type of automated text in Chapter 24. 

330
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
Automating Page Numbers
You’ll often want page references in text — the current page number in a 
folio, for example, or the target page number for a “continued on” reference. 
You can type a page number manually on each page of a multipage docu-
ment, but that can get old fast. If you’re working on a multipage document, 
you should be using master pages (see Chapters 4 and 5). And if you’re using 
master pages, you should handle page numbers on document pages by 
placing page-number characters on their master pages.
If you want to add the current page number to a page, you can choose 
Type➪Insert Special Character➪Markers➪Current Page Number 
(Option+Shift+Ô+N or Ctrl+Shift+Alt+N) whenever the Type tool is active and 
the text-insertion cursor is flashing. If you move the page or the text frame, 
the page-number character is automatically updated to reflect the new page 
number.
To create “continued on” and “continued from” lines, choose Type➪Insert 
Special Character➪Markers➪Next Page Number to have the next 
page’s number inserted in your text, or choose Type➪Insert Special 
Character➪Markers➪Previous Page Number to have the previous page’s 
number inserted. (There are no shortcuts for these complex menu 
sequences.) That next or previous page will be the next or previous page in 
the story, not the next page in the document.
 
One flaw in InDesign’s continued-line approach is that the text frames must 
be linked for InDesign to know what the next and previous pages are. Thus, 
you’re likely to place your continued lines in the middle of your text. But if the 
text reflows, so do the continued lines. Here’s a way to avoid that problem: 
Create separate text frames for your continued-on and continued-from text 
frames. Now link just those two frames, not the story text. This way, the story 
text can reflow as needed without affecting your continued lines.
Using Section Markers
InDesign offers another marker called the section marker, which lets you 
insert specific text into your document and update it by just changing the 
marker text. 
The section marker is defined as part of a section start (see Chapter 4), and 
it’s meant to be used in folios to put in the section name or chapter name. 
But you can use it anywhere you want — and for anything you want, not just 
for section or chapter labels.

331
 Chapter 21: Working with Automatic Text
To define a section marker (you can have only one per section, of course), 
open the Pages panel (Window➪Pages, [Ô+F12 or Ctrl+F12]) and choose 
Numbering & Section Options from the panel’s flyout menu. In the resulting 
dialog box, type a text string in the Section Marker field. Then click OK.
To use the marker, have the text insertion point active in whatever 
text frame you want to insert it and then choose Type➪Insert Special 
Character➪Markers➪Section Marker. That’s it!
Using Text Variables
With InDesign text variables, you can define an unlimited number of text vari-
ables that InDesign will happily update across your documents whenever you 
change them or your layout does.
To create a text variable, choose Type➪Text Variables➪Define. You see get 
the Text Variables dialog box, shown in Figure 21-1. It lists existing text vari-
ables — including the eight predefined ones in InDesign: Chapter Number, 
Creation Date, File Name, Last Page Number, Modification Date, Output Date, 
and the two types of Running Header. Any of them that you create are added 
to this list. 
 
The source of the number used in the Chapter Number text variable is 
something you define as part of a book. Chapter 22 explains books and how 
to set the chapter number. 
To create a new text variable, click New. The New Text Variable dialog box 
appears, as shown in Figure 21-1. Give the variable a name in the Name field, 
and choose the type of variable you want from the Type pop-up menu. Your 
choices are the seven predefined types plus Custom Text, which lets you put 
in any text of your choosing. (This means you can create more than one vari-
able for, say, File Name or Modification Date. You might do this because you 
want them formatted differently in different usage scenarios.)
The options for formatting the chosen type of variable varies based on the 
type of variable it is. Three options are available for more than one type of 
text variable:
 
 Text Before and Text After: These two fields — available for all Type 
pop-up menu options except Custom Text — let you add any text you 
want before or after the variable. For example, you might enter the word 
Chapter in the Text Before field for a Chapter Number variable. Note 
that both fields have an unnamed pop-up menu to their right from which 
you can select a variety of common symbols and spaces.

332
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
 
 Style: This pop-up menu lets you select the style to apply in the Chapter 
Number, Running Header (Character Style), and Running Header 
(Paragraph Style) text variables.
 
 Date Format: This field and its associated pop-up menu lets you choose 
the desired date and time formats for the Creation Date, Modification 
Date, and Output Date text variables. Examples include MM/dd/yy to get 
a date like 05/08/62 and MMMM d, yyyy to get a date like August 15, 1962. 
Don’t worry about memorizing codes — just pick the desired options 
from the pop-up menu instead.
Several other variables have unique options:
 
 Custom Text: This variable has the fewest options. Just enter the 
desired text, including choosing special characters, such as spaces and 
dashes, from the unnamed pop-up menu to the right of the Text field. 
That’s the only field to adjust for this text variable.
 
 Last Page Number: In addition to the Text Before, Text After, and Style 
formatting controls, this type includes one unique control: the Scope 
pop-up menu. Here, you choose between Section and Document to tell 
InDesign what you mean by last page number: the section’s last page or 
the document’s.
 
 File Name: In addition to Text Before and Text After formatting 
controls, this type has two unique check boxes — Include Entire Folder 
Path and Include File Extension — to tell InDesign exactly how much of 
the filename to include. If both are unchecked, InDesign includes just 
the core filename, such as Jun 07 TOC. Checking the Include Entire 
Folder Path adds the file location before the core filename, such as 
MacintoshHD:Projects:Jun 07 TOC or C:\Projects\Jun 07 
TOC. Checking the Include File Extension appends the filename 
extension, such as June 07 TOC.indd.
 
 Running Header: The formatting options for these two types — 
Paragraph Style and Character Style — are the most complex, as shown 
in Figure 21-1. The two Running Header menu options have two options 
not available to other Type pop-up menu options: 
 
• Use: This option determines which text to use: First on Page uses 
the first text on the page that has the specific style applied, while 
Last on Page uses the last text on the page that has the specific 
style applied.
 
• Options: Here, you can control whether the punctuation of the 
source text is retained in the running header (check Delete End 
Punctuation to remove it) and whether the running header over-
rides the text of the source text’s capitalization (check Change 
Case and then choose the appropriate capitalization option: Upper 
Case, Lower Case, Title Case, or Sentence Case).

333
 Chapter 21: Working with Automatic Text
 
Title case means that the first letter of each word is capitalized, while Sentence 
Case means that only the first letter of the first word in each sentence is 
capitalized.

Editing and managing text variables
Editing text variables is very much like creating them: Just select the variable 
to change and click Edit in the Text Variables dialog box. You get the Edit 
Text Variable dialog box, which is identical (except for its name) to the New 
Text Variable dialog box covered in the previous section.
You can also import text variables from other documents by clicking Load in 
the Text Variables dialog box and then choosing the document to import the 
variables from. After choosing a document, you get the Load Text Variables 
dialog box, where you can select which variables are imported and handle 
name conflicts.
To get rid of a text variable, select it from the list in the Text Variables dialog 
box and click Delete. 
To convert a text variable in your document to the actual text, highlight it 
and either choose Type➪Text Variables➪Convert Variable to Text or, if you 
happen to be in the Text Variables dialog box, click Convert to Text.

334
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
Inserting text variables
Inserting text variables in your document uses the same essential process 
as inserting a special character such as a section marker, except you use the 
Text Variables menu option: Choose Type➪Text Variables➪Insert Variable 
and then choose the desired variable from the submenu. If you happen to be 
in the Text Variables dialog box, click Insert.
Using Conditional Text
Have you ever worked on a document that has variations, forcing you to 
create separate copies that you must then ensure have any changes applied 
to all copies? Perhaps you used the layers feature (see Chapter 5) to restrict 
the unique content to its own layer so that you could make visible each ver-
sion’s layer when you wanted to print that specific version. But you realized 
this technique doesn’t work well for text inside paragraphs, because changes 
to the text mean whatever you placed in layers won’t be at the right location 
if your text changes move the text’s locations in the “main” layer.
 
InDesign CS4 offers a new way to have multiple versions of text in a 
document that gets around these issues: conditional text. You can think of 
conditional text as sort of a layer that works within text, so if the text moves, 
the conditional “layers” do, too.
For example, say you have a publication that is distributed in Canada, 
Ireland, and the U.K., where pricing is different (dollars, euros, and pounds, 
respectively). You can’t really duplicate the main “dollars” layer and dupli-
cate all the text in it for the “euros” and “pounds” layers. Why? The reason 
is that if you changed the text in the main layer that includes the dollar 
prices, the pounds and euros layers would have the old text and need to be 
changed also (a management nightmare). You may think that you can avoid 
this problem by having a main layer for the text, and then separate layers for 
the dollar, euro, and pound pricing. Unless your pricing wouldn’t move ever 
(such as if it’s in an independent table), if the main text is edited and reflows, 
those text frames would get out of place — an even worse situation.
With conditional text, you instead have just one layer for your text, and where 
the text may need to change (such as for pricing), you insert conditional text. 
Then, if you want to display the price in dollars, you enable the dollars condi-
tion, and the right text appears, no matter how the text is flowing. When you 
want to display the price in euros, you enable the euros condition. Ditto for 
pounds.

335
 Chapter 21: Working with Automatic Text
Here’s how it works:
 
1. In your text, enter each of the text variations you want. 
 
 For example, as you can see in Figure 21-2, if you have three prices, 
enter all three in sequence as if they were one piece of text. Apply any 
formatting desired. Don’t worry for the moment that you don’t want 
them all to display or print at the same time.
 
Figure 21-2: 
The 
Conditional 
Text panel 
and its New 
Condition 
dialog box. 
Above them 
is the text to 
which the 
conditions 
are applied 
(the three 
prices).
 
 
2. Open the Conditional Text panel (Window➪Type & Tables➪
Conditional Text) and choose New Condition from the flyout menu. 
 
3. In the New Conditions dialog box, give the condition a name and 
determine how you want it to be highlighted (using the Appearance, 
Method, and Color pop-up menus) in the layout, as shown in 
Figure 21-2.
 
 Your highlighting options are Underline and Highlight (which puts a 
colored background behind conditional text), either of which you can 
apply a color to. If you choose Underline, you can select a line type in 
the Appearance pop-up menu. (It’s unavailable if you choose Highlight.) 
This highlighting doesn’t print; it’s just lets you know in InDesign where 
and what conditions are applied to text.
 
 You can modify conditions later by choosing Condition Options from the 
Conditional Text panel’s flyout menu. The dialog box is identical to the 
New Conditions dialog box.

336
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
 
4. In the text, highlight a piece of text (such as the euro price) and then 
click the related condition to apply that condition to the selected text.
 
 A check mark appears to the immediate left of the active condition for 
whatever text is selected or in which your text cursor is active. In your 
layout, the text also has whatever line type in whatever color you speci-
fied in the New Conditions dialog box so that you have a visual guide as 
to what conditions are applied to what text.
 
 Add as many conditions using Steps 3 and 4 as you need. The figure’s 
example has three: one for each price. (Note that the [Unconditional] 
condition is just your regular text, which always displays and prints.)
 
5. Now, click the squares in the Conditional Text panels to the far left of 
the various conditions. 
 
 If the square shows an eye, any text tagged with that condition is vis-
ible. If the square is empty, any text tagged with that condition isn’t 
displayed. By controlling which conditions are active (eye icons), you 
determine what displays and prints in your document. (This process is 
exactly how you make layers visible and invisible in the Layers panel, as 
Chapter 5 explains.) Figure 21-3 shows the same text as in Figure 21-2, 
but with just the [Unconditional] and the euros text visible.
Pretty easy, isn’t it? Just turn off and on the text you want to display and 
print by hiding and showing the appropriate conditions.

text as in 
Figure 21-2,

N
ot only is InDesign useful for short documents like ads and newslet-
ters, but it also can comfortably handle longer, multichapter docu-
ments, such as books and manuals. The most common and easiest way to 
build longer documents, especially those created by more than one author 
or contributor, is to create multiple InDesign documents and then assemble 
them into a larger book.
InDesign’s book feature lets you
 
 See who is working on each chapter (that is, on each document in the 
book) and when.
 
 Update styles and swatches across documents for consistency.
 
 Update page numbers across multiple documents.
 
 Create a unified table of contents and a unified index for multiple 
documents, using the techniques in Chapter 20.
 
 Easily print or create a PDF file from all the chapters of a book.
Creating a Book
In InDesign, a book is a specific type of file that you create to track chapters 
or multiple documents that make up the book. Using InDesign’s book panel, 
you can add, open and edit, rearrange, and print chapters of the book. The 
book panel is nice for workgroups because multiple users can open the same 
book and access different chapters; it also works well if you are a single user 
working on a multichapter book. 

338
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
To create a new book, choose File➪New➪Book. The New Book dialog box 
lets you specify a location for the book and give it a name. Click Save to 
create and open the book.
You can open an existing book by using the File➪Open command (Ô+O 
or Ctrl+O). When viewing folder and disk contents via the Mac’s Finder or 
Windows’s Explorer, you can also double-click a book’s icon or filename to 
open it. 
 
If multiple books are open, they now each appear in a separate tabbed 
pane in a floating panel. If you want them to appear in individual panels, 
as in previous versions of InDesign, you can just drag their tab out of the 
panel, and InDesign will create a new panel for each dragged-out pane. To 
always have InDesign open or create books in separate panels, disable the 
Open Documents as Tabs option in the Interface pane of the Preferences 
dialog box (choose InDesign➪Preferences➪Interface [Ô+K] on the Mac or 
Edit➪Preferences➪Interface [Ctrl+K] in Windows). Note that changing this 
option also means that any documents created or opened also appear in 
separate windows.
To close a book’s pane and any book documents that are in it, click the 
book’s tab to select it and choose Close Book from the flyout menu. If a book 
displays alone in a panel, simply click its close box. And if you click the close 
box in a panel with multiple book panes, all the panes are closed along with 
the panel.
Working with Book Chapters
A new book pane (or panel) is empty — you need to add chapter docu-
ments to fill it up. To do so, click the Add Document iconic button — the + 
icon on the bottom right of the book panel (see Figure 22-1) — or use the 
Add Document option in the book panel’s flyout menu. Use the Add Chapter 
dialog box to locate and select the first chapter you want to add. Click the 
Add button to make this the first chapter in the book. Repeat this process 
to add to the book all the chapters you have ready. (You can also add more 
chapters later.)
 
Chapters are listed in the book pane in the order in which you add them. You 
may want to rearrange them to match the actual order of the book project — 
especially if you’re numbering the book automatically from start to finish, since 
InDesign will number them based on their order in the book pane. To rear-
range the relative position of chapters, just click and drag chapter names up or 
down within the pane to put them in the desired order.

To work on a chapter in a book, first open the book and then double-click the

other InDesign document. For a chapter to be opened, it must be marked as 
Available, as explained in the next section. When you finish editing a chapter, 
save and close it as usual.
You can replace and delete chapters using the controls in the book panel’s 
flyout menu for whatever book pane is selected:
 
 Replace an existing chapter with another document by selecting the 
chapter in the book panel and choosing Replace Document from the 
flyout menu. Navigate to a new document, select it, and click the Open 
button. InDesign replaces the selected chapter with the new document.
 
 Delete chapters from a book by choosing Remove Document from the 
flyout menu or by clicking the Remove Document iconic button (the – 
icon) at the bottom of the panel.

340
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
InDesign offers three other menu options in the flyout menu that come in 
handy for managing a book: You can save a book by choosing Save Book, save 
it to a new name by choosing Save Book As, and close a book by choosing 
Close Book. (With the latter option, any changes to the book are not saved, 
although a warning box gives you the chance to save any unsaved changes.)
Finding out about chapter status
When you use the book panel in a workgroup, it provides helpful status 
reports about each chapter. (Figure 22-1 shows the icons used to indicate a 
chapter’s status.) The statuses are
 
 Available: You can open, edit, or print the chapter. Only one user at a 
time can open a chapter.
 
 Open: You have the chapter open and can edit it or print it. Nobody else 
can open the chapter at this time.
 
 In Use: Another user has the chapter open. In this case, you can’t edit or 
open the chapter.
 
 Modified: The chapter has been changed since the last time you opened 
the book panel. Simply click the chapter name to update it.
 
 Missing: The chapter’s file has been moved since it was added to the 
book. Double-click the chapter name to open the Find File dialog box 
and locate it.
The Document Information menu option in the book panel’s flyout menu pro-
vides useful information. When you select a chapter and choose this option, 
you can see the file’s modification date, location, and page range, and you 
can replace the chapter with a different document.
Taking advantage of style sources
The first chapter you add to the book is, by default, the style source. You can 
tell which chapter is the style source by the icon to the left of the chapter 
name. In most cases, you want the styles, swatches, and so on to remain the 
same from chapter to chapter. The style source in an InDesign book defines 
the styles and swatches that are common to all the chapters in the book.
If you decide to make a different chapter the style source, all you need to do 
is (in the book pane) click in the column to the left of that chapter’s filename. 
The icon indicating the style source moves to that chapter. But note that 
indicating a style source isn’t the end of the story; to ensure formatting con-
sistency, you need to synchronize all the book’s chapters to that source, as 
explained in the next section.

341
 Chapter 22: Publishing Books
Synchronizing formatting
When you use the Synchronize feature, InDesign makes sure that the para-
graph styles, character styles, table styles, cell styles, object styles, trap pre-
sets, TOC styles, master pages, and color swatches in each chapter in the book 
match those in the style source. This synchronization enforces consistency, 
but also means you have to make sure that you choose the correct chapter as 
the standard, because its settings will override the other chapters’ settings.
The book panel includes a Synchronize iconic button (the two facing arrows), 
as well as a Synchronize Selected Documents or Synchronize Book menu item 
in the flyout menu. Before you synchronize, make sure that you’re happy 
with the styles, master pages, and other settings you’ve established in the 
style source and then follow these steps to synchronize:
 
1. Be sure that all chapters are available for editing.
 
2. Choose the style source by clicking the box to the left of the source 
chapter so that the style-source icon appears.
 
3. Choose Synchronize Options from the book panel’s flyout menu, which 
opens the — wait for it now! — Synchronize Options dialog box.
 
 Make sure that every type of item you want to synchronize — Object Styles, 
TOC Style, Character Styles, Paragraph Styles, Table Styles, Cell Styles, 
Master Pages, Numbered Lists, Text Variables, Conditional Text Settings, 
Cross-Reference Formats, Trap Presets, and Swatches — is checked.
 
 InDesign CS4 adds the ability to synchronize the new cross-references 
and conditional text attributes.
 
4. Select the chapters you want to synchronize and either click the 
Synchronize button or choose Synchronize Selected Documents from 
the flyout menu.
 
 If no chapters are selected, InDesign assumes that you want to synchro-
nize all chapters; the menu option Synchronize Book appears in the 
flyout menu rather than Synchronize Selected Documents in that case.
 
5. Compare the styles (character, paragraph, object, table, cell, and 
TOC), swatches (color, tint, and gradient), text variables, numbered 
lists, master pages, and trap presets in the style source to those in 
each chapter.
 
 If anything is different, the information in each chapter is updated to 
match the style source. If someone changed the typeface in a style sheet 
in a chapter, it reverts to the typeface specified in the style source. If 
anything is missing from a chapter — for example, if you just added a 
swatch to the style source but not to other chapters — that information 
is added to each chapter. If a chapter uses its own style or swatch not 
defined in the source style, that unique style or swatch is not changed or 
removed — these local additions are retained.

342
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
By using the synchronize feature, you give each chapter the same basic set 
of styles and swatches as the style source, although you can still add more of 
these specifications to individual chapters. Keep in mind that synchronizing 
doesn’t repair the formatting fiascos that can happen when multiple users 
work on the same book. Be sure everyone who needs to know the standards 
for the design has access, ahead of time, to that information.
Printing Chapters and Books
Using the book panel, you can print any chapters with the status of Available 
or Open. Here’s how:
 
1. To print the entire book, make sure that no chapters are selected.
 
 To print a contiguous range of chapters, Shift+click the first and last 
chapters that you want to print. To print noncontiguous chapters, 
Ô+click or Ctrl+click the chapters to select them.
 
2. Click the Print Book iconic button or choose Print Book or Print 
Selected Documents in the book panel’s flyout menu.
 
 The option you see depends on whether chapters are selected in the 
book panel. Either way, the standard InDesign Print dialog box opens. 
Note that the option to choose all pages or a range of pages is grayed 
out — you must print all chapters in the selected chapters.
 
3. Make any adjustments in the Print dialog box.
 
4. Click Print to print the chapters.
 
You can also output a book to PDF by using the Export Book to PDF or Export 
Selected Documents to PDF menu items in the flyout menu. Similar Digital 
Editions options let you export to the eBook format. These menu items 
work like their equivalent Print versions. (Chapter 24 covers PDF and eBook 
options.) And you can collect all the chapters, images, and fonts into one 
place using the Package Book for Print or Package Selected Documents for 
Print options (see Chapter 23).
Working with Sections in Chapters
Section-based page numbering is fairly common in book-length documents 
because it lets you, for example, restart page numbering in each new sec-
tion, such as 4.1, 4.2, and so on. Creating a section start is also the only way 
to start a document on a left-facing page. InDesign gives you two choices for 
numbering book pages: You can let the book panel number pages consecu-
tively from one chapter to the next, or you can add sections of page numbers, 
which carry through the book until you start a new section.

343
 Chapter 22: Publishing Books
Numbering pages consecutively
If your book chapters don’t have sections, use consecutive page numbering, 
in which the first page number of a chapter follows the last page number of 
the previous chapter (for example, one chapter ends on page 224, and the 
next chapter starts on page 225).
Consecutive page numbering is applied by default in InDesign. If, for some 
reason, a document resets its numbering, go to that document, open the 
Section dialog box (choose Numbering & Section Options in the Pages panel’s 
flyout menu), and select Automatic Page Numbering.
Consecutive page numbering works as follows:
 
 Whenever you add a chapter that contains no sections or that has 
section numbering set to Automatic Page Numbering, InDesign numbers 
pages consecutively throughout the book.
 
 As you add and delete pages from chapters, InDesign updates all the 
page numbers in the chapters that follow.
 
 You can force InDesign to renumber all the pages by choosing Repaginate 
from the book panel’s flyout menu — handy if you changed section 
options in some chapters and want the book to see those changes.
Numbering pages with sections
When chapters you add to books already contain sections of page numbers 
(implemented through the Section dialog box, which you access via the 
Numbering & Section Options menu option in the Pages panel’s flyout menu), 
section page numbering overrides the book’s consecutive page number-
ing. The section page numbering carries through chapters of the book until 
InDesign encounters a new section start. So if one chapter ends on page iv, the 
next chapter starts on page v unless you start a new section for that chapter.
For more in-depth information about section numbering, see Chapter 4.
Setting chapter numbers
You can also see and modify any chapter’s page numbering settings by 
selecting the chapter in the book panel and then choosing Document 
Numbering Options from the flyout menu. Figure 22-2 shows the Document 
Numbering Options dialog box. The top half of the dialog box is the same 
as the Pages panel’s Section dialog box, whereas the bottom half — the 
Document Chapter Numbering area — lets you control the chapter number-
ing style and the chapter number itself.

344
Part VI: Getting Down to Business 
 
You can force a chapter to have a specific number by selecting the Chapter 
Number option, have the chapter use the same chapter number as the previ-
ous document (such as when you break a chapter into two documents), and 
have InDesign automatically number the current document by incrementing 
from the previous document’s chapter number.
 
The chapter number defined here — whether manually overridden or auto-
matically adjusted — is what is used by the Chapter Number text variable, 
explained in Chapter 21.

Part VII
Printing and 
Multimedia 
Essentials

In this part . . .
F
inally, your layout is done. It’s beautiful, it’s well-
written, and you’re eager to share it with your 
readers. This part shows you how to take the final step 
to print or create a PDF version of your layout. InDesign 
gives you a lot of control over output, so you can optimize 
the results based on what you’re printing it to, such as 
ensuring color fidelity and the best possible image resolu-
tion. Then you can start the whole creation, refinement, 
and output process over again with your next layout!
Plus, this part explains how to go beyond print into the 
brave new world of the multimedia by exporting files in 
the Web’s HTML format, creating interactive PDF files 
with effects such as buttons and embedded movies, and 
even creating Flash animation files from your InDesign 
layout. Can 3D be far behind?

 Collecting files for service bureaus
You’ve finished your document, and you want to share it with the whole 
world, or at least your audience. So you reach for your mouse and 
choose File➪Print or quickly press Ô+P or Ctrl+P so that you can print.
Stop. Cancel. If this print job is your first with InDesign, you need to make 
sure that you’ve properly set up your printer to get the results you need. The 
process for doing so varies based on your operating system, and you can find 
instructions at the author’s Web site at www.InDesignCentral.com.
Printing is more complex than just choosing File➪Print (Ô+P or Ctrl+P). At least 
it can be, depending on what you’re printing and on what printing device you’re 
using. For example, printing a full-color brochure involves more settings and 
steps than printing a proof copy to your laser printer or inkjet printer. So as you 
go through this chapter, keep in mind that many steps aren’t relevant every time 
you print — but understanding the basics of printing ensures that you follow the 
right steps for each type of project. When you know the steps for printing one 
document, the process for printing every other document takes little effort.
Checking Your Document before Printing
 
Before you print, you should do a visual proof of your layout. It’s amazing 
what you don’t notice when you’re focused on specific elements as you lay out 
a page. Change your view setting so that the entire page or spread fits in the 
window (choose View➪Fit Page in Window [Ô+0 or Ctrl+0 — note the use of 
the numeral zero in the shortcut] or View➪Fit Spread in Window [Option+Ô+0 
or Ctrl+Alt+0], as desired) and then review your pages.

348
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
This visual check is a critical step before printing, but you should also use 
InDesign’s preflight tool to examine your document. The preflighting capabil-
ity examines your document for any issues of concern and gives you a report 
on what you may need to fix.
You may wonder why you need a preflighting capability to check for things 
such as missing fonts and images: After all, InDesign lists any missing fonts 
and graphics when you open a document. The answer is that sometimes 
fonts and graphics files are moved after you open a file, in which case you 
won’t get the alerts from InDesign. This mistake is more likely to happen if 
you work with files and fonts on a network drive, rather than with local fonts 
and graphics. Preflighting also checks for other problematic issues, such as 
the use of RGB files and TrueType fonts.
Identifying and fixing errors
 
InDesign CS4 preflights your document as you’re working on it so that you can 
deal with surprises before the end of the project when you’re likely on a tight 
deadline. At the bottom of the document window, InDesign reveals whether it 
has found any errors and lets you access the Preflight panel and other options 
to both specify what the preflighting should be checking before and show you 
the issues it has found. Figure 23-1 shows this alert and its options. This new 
preflighting approach has also changed all the dialog boxes and most related 
settings compared to previous versions of InDesign.
 
If you’re working with the InDesign book feature (see Chapter 22), you can pre-
flight the book’s chapters from an open book’s panel by using the Preflight Book 
option in its flyout menu. (If one or more documents in the book are selected 
in the panel, the menu option changes to Preflight Selected Documents.) The 
options are the same as for preflighting individual documents.
 
Figure 23-1: 
The preflight 
alert at the 
bottom of a 
document, 
as well as 
its menu 
options. 

349
 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
You can turn preflighting on or off using either of these methods:
 
 In the Preflight pop-up menu at the bottom of the document window, 
choose Preflight Document to toggle between off and on. If the menu option 
is checked, preflighting is turned on. You can also toggle off and on Enable 
Preflight for All Documents, which sets the default action for all documents.
 
 In the Preflight panel (File➪Preflight [Shift+Option+Ô+F or Ctrl+Alt+
Shift+F]), enable the On option to turn preflighting on; disable it to 
turn preflighting off. The flyout menu has the Enable Preflight for All 
Documents option.
The Preflight panel shows all errors that InDesign has found in the Error 
pane, as Figure 23-2 shows. The errors are grouped by type; to see the indi-
vidual errors, click the right-facing triangle to expand the group’s informa-
tion. In the list of issues that appears, you’ll get a brief description and a 
hyperlink to the page that has the error. Each list may have several occur-
rences, in which case you’ll see another right-facing triangle that if clicked 
expands the list to show them all. And to get even more detail on a selected 
item, expand the Info pane by clicking its right-facing triangle (unless it’s 
already expanded, of course).
 
To “collapse” any lists (such as to get them out of the way as you look at other 
items), click the down-pointing triangles.
 
Figure 23-2:

panel with

errors

Info pane, 
and the 
flyout menu.
 
To get rid of the error notices, go to each page that has an issue and correct 
it. InDesign updates the preflight errors status as you do.
Telling InDesign what to check for
InDesign has its default set of issues to look for when preflighting. But you can 
set up your own options based on your specific needs. Although the process is 

350
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
simple, you’ll likely need to consult with your production manager or service 
bureau to determine what settings you want to enable in your profile — these 
settings are typically expert decisions.
Even if the choices require expertise to make, the process for setting up your 
preflight options is easy:
 
1. In the Preflight pop-up menu at the bottom of the document window 
or in the Preflight panel’s flyout menu, choose Define Profiles.
 
2. In the Preflight Profiles dialog box, shown in Figure 23-3, click the + 
iconic button to add a new profile.
 
 Use the – iconic button to delete a selected profile.
 
3. Give your profile a name and go through the options and select the 
ones you want InDesign to preflight for as you work.
 
 A triangle to the left of an option means that you can select from subop-
tions; click the triangle (it then points down) to get those suboptions. 
(Click it again to “collapse” the suboptions so that they’re not in view.)
 
4. Click Save when done.
 
5. Use the + and – iconic buttons at left to add more profiles or remove 
existing profiles.
 
6. Click OK when done to exit the Preflight Profiles dialog box.
 
7. In the Preflight panel, choose the desired profile for the current 
document from the Profile pop-up menu.
 
 If the Preflight panel isn’t open, choose File➪Preflight (Shift+Option+Ô+F 
or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+F) to open it.

 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
Setting Up Booklets
One of the trickiest types of documents to print is a folded booklet: You can’t 
simply print the pages in sequence and have them end up on the right loca-
tion on the final sheets of paper — when you fold them, you’ll find the page 
order is rearranged due to the folding, especially in two-sided documents.
The tried-and-true approach is to use a booklet template that essentially 
provides a map of where pages should be so that when they’re printed and 
folded, they end up in the right place — and then arrange your pages in that 
order via the Pages panel. Figure 23-4 shows the natural order (1–8) that you 
typically think a booklet has, as well as the actual page order (8,1; 2,7; 6,3; 
and 4,5) in which it must be printed to appear as a sequence of 1 through 8.
 
Figure 23-4: 
Left: The 
logical order 
of pages 
for a folded 
booklet. 
Right: The 
order pages 
must be 
moved so 
that they 
print in 
the right 
sequence to 
be folded.
 
To simplify this approach, use the Print Booklet dialog box (File➪Print 
Booklet). Here, you arrange your pages in the Pages panel in sequential order 
(1–8, in this case) and let the InDesign software figure out how to rearrange 
them for printing. Much easier! Figure 23-5 shows the Print Booklet dialog 
box’s Setup pane.
Here are the key controls:
 
 Booklet Type: This pop-up menu is the key control. Here, you choose the 
type of booklet, which tells InDesign how to arrange the pages when print-
ing so that they’re in the right sequence after folding. Your options are

352
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
 
Figure 23-5: 
The Setup 
pane of 
the Print 
Booklet 
dialog box.
 
 
• 2-up Saddle Stitch: A folded sheet that contains two pages on 
each side, with the staples in the centerfold, between the pages. 
Newsletters, smaller magazines, and many office documents use 
this option.
 
• 2-up Perfect Bound: A folded sheet that contains two pages on each 
side, where the pages are stacked and folded and then cut and held 
together with a glued backing or spine-based binding. This option is 
typically used in books, larger magazines, and catalogs (because the 
square binding holds more pages than saddle-stitching does).
 
• 2-up Consecutive: A sheet that contains two pages on one side, 
with each page then cut and bound. This setup is essentially 
normal printing except that it uses a two-page sheet to print two 
pages at a time rather than a separate sheet for each page.
 
• 3-up Consecutive: Like 2-up Consecutive, except three pages are 
on a sheet.
 
• 4-up Consecutive: Like 2-up Consecutive, except four pages appear 
on a sheet.
 
 Space Between Pages (not available for 2-up Saddle Stitch) and Bleed 
Between Pages (available for 2-up Perfect Bound only): These options 
let you adjust the relative spacing among pages and objects, typically to 
provide additional white space around the folds.
 
 Creep (not available for the Consecutive options): This option shifts 
pages’ contents away from the spine in increasing amounts as pages fall 
from the center of the booklet to the outside of the booklet. Because out-
side pages have to fold over many inside pages, their content can end up 
obscured in the inside margins because their gutter is eaten up by 
folding over those other pages. The Creep option corrects this problem.

353
 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
 
 Signature Size (available only for 2-up Perfect Bound): This option spec-
ifies how many pages are printed on each side of a sheet: 4, 8, 16, or 32.
 
 Automatically Adjust to Fit Marks and Bleeds: This option ensures 
that crop marks, bleeds, and other content that appears outside the 
page boundary are properly handled for the chosen booklet type. If not 
checked, you can manually adjust these settings using the Top, Bottom, 
Left, and Right fields.
When using these features, consult with your professional printer or service 
bureau for the appropriate settings. If you’re printing the documents yourself, do 
a test run, then fold, cut, and/or staple the sample document to make sure that 
it works as expected before printing lots of copies. The Preview pane shows the 
results of your choices, but doing a dry run is always the safest option.
When you’re happy with your settings, choose Print to get the standard Print 
dialog box (covered in the “Choosing Print Options” section, later in this chapter). 
You can also choose Print Settings to set up printer-specific controls (also 
covered in that section).
Calibrating Color
If you’re producing color documents for printing on a printing press, you may 
want to use InDesign’s built-in color calibration tools. In a sense, you have 
to, because InDesign’s color calibration is always on. But color calibration 
is something you don’t do in a vacuum — you have to do it in your graphics 
programs as well so that every piece of software that handles your graphics 
is working from the same color assumptions.
If you use Adobe Creative Suite 4, you can use a consistent color management 
system (CMS) in all print-oriented CS4 programs, ensuring consistent color. 
For scanned images, digital camera photos, and the like, you can also tell 
InDesign the source device so that InDesign knows the color assumptions 
that the device makes and can use that information to adjust the colors 
during printing accordingly.
You can set the CMS settings in InDesign by choosing Edit➪Color Settings to 
get the Color Settings dialog box shown in Figure 23-6.
Many of Adobe’s Creative Suite 4 applications have the same dialog box, 
although sometimes you access it in different ways:
 
 Bridge CS4: Choose Edit➪Creative Suite Color Settings (Shift+Ô+K 
or Ctrl+Shift+K). This action sets the defaults for all CS4 applications, 
although you can modify individual applications, as described in the 
next three bullets. Note that if individual applications’ color settings 

354
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
differ from the CS4-wide settings, you see a note to that effect at the top 
of the affected applications’ Color Settings dialog boxes.
 
 Acrobat Professional 9: Choose Acrobat➪Preferences (Ô+K) on the 
Mac or choose Edit➪Preferences (Ctrl+K) in Windows. Then go to the 
Color Management pane. Note that this pane’s appearance differs from 
the appearance of the Color Settings dialog boxes in the other Creative 
Suite 4 applications.
 
 Illustrator CS4: Choose Edit➪Color Settings (Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Shift+K).
 
 Photoshop CS4: Choose Edit➪Color Settings (Shift+Ô+K or Ctrl+Shift+K).
Note that the following CS4 applications have no CMS controls: Adobe Device 
Manager, Dreamweaver, and Flash Professional.
 
Figure 23-6: 
The Color 
Settings 
dialog box 
lets you set 
applica-
tion color 
defaults.
 
When you place a bitmapped image into InDesign, the CMS applies the default 
settings defined in the Color Settings dialog box. (Choose Edit➪Color Settings.) 
If the document has no embedded color profile, a dialog box appears with a list 
of color profiles, as well as options to apply the default you’ve set up in InDesign 
or to apply no profile. (If you choose not to apply a profile, the color won’t be 
adjusted during printing.)

355
 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
Whether or not the document has embedded profiles, you can change the 
color settings for specific images as follows:
 
 As you import each file, select Show Import Options in the Place dialog 
box (choose File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]) when you place a graphic into 
InDesign. In the resulting Image Import Options dialog box, go to the 
Color pane and select the appropriate profile from the Profile menu.
 
 Any time after you place an image, select it and choose Object➪Image 
Color Settings to apply a different profile. (You can also choose 
Graphics➪Image Color Settings from the contextual menu that appears 
when you Control+click or right-click a graphic in InDesign.)
You can save and use color management settings in other documents. The 
process is simple: Click Save in the Color Settings dialog box to save the cur-
rent dialog box’s settings to a file. If you want to use the saved color-settings 
information in another document, open that document, click Load in the Color 
Settings dialog box, and then browse for and select the color settings file. 
That’s it! This technique is a handy way to ensure consistency in a workgroup.
If you put together a document with specific color settings, but then decide 
you want to apply a new profile across your pictures or replace a specific 
profile globally in your document, you have a couple of options:
 
 Choose Edit➪Assign Profiles to replace the color management settings 
globally for the document, setting the target color settings for output.
 
 Choose Edit➪Convert to Profile to change the document’s working color 
workspace. It also lets you change the CMS engine, rendering intent, and 
black-point compensation settings. This does not change your output 
color settings but instead changes the source profiles assigned to the 
images so you can test different color settings in on-screen preview 
mode (View➪Proof Colors).
Be sure to consult with a production manager or service bureau manager if 
you change these expert settings.
When you’re ready to output your document to a printer or other device, 
set the profile and rendering intent for that destination device in the Color 
Management pane of the Print dialog box (choose File➪Print [Ô+P or 
Ctrl+P]), which has an Options section with the Color Handling and Printer 
Profile pop-up menus. Here, you select the appropriate option for your 
output device. (If you don’t know, ask an expert.)

356
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
Choosing Print Options
When your document is ready to print, go to the Print dialog box. (Choose 
File➪Print [Ô+P or Ctrl+P].) The Print dialog box has eight panes as well 
as several options common to all the panes. (I cover just the essential ones 
here.) Change any options and click Print, and InDesign sends your document 
to the printer. Figure 23-7 shows the dialog box.
 
If you’re working with the InDesign book feature (see Chapter 22), you can 
print the book’s chapters from an open book’s panel by using the Print Book 
option in its flyout menu. (If one or more documents in the book are selected 
in the panel, the menu option changes to Print Selected Documents.) The 
setup options are the same as for printing individual documents.
 
Figure 23-7: 
The default 
view for the 
Print dialog 
box, whose 
General 
pane is 
where you 
set page 
and paper 
options.
 
The common options available in the dialog box, no matter what pane is 
selected, are as follows:
 
 Print Preset pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you choose a previ-
ously defined set of printer settings, which makes it easy to switch 
between, say, a proofing printer and a final output device.
 
 Printer pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you select the printer to use.

357
 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
 
 PPD pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you select PostScript Printer 
Descriptions, which are files that contain configuration and feature 
information specific to a brand and model of printer. You usually install 
these files into your operating system by using software that comes 
from your printer manufacturer. If InDesign finds no compatible PPDs, it 
uses generic options. If InDesign finds just one compatible PPD, it uses 
that automatically; otherwise, it lets you select a PPD.
 
 Save Preset button: Clicking this button saves any settings that you 
change in the Print dialog box and lets you choose a name for those 
saved settings for reuse. If you change the dialog box’s settings but don’t 
save these changes as a print preset, InDesign changes the name of the 
current settings in the Print Preset pop-up menu to [Custom] to remind 
you that the settings are changed and unsaved.
 
 You can also create print presets by choosing File➪Print Presets➪Define 
or edit an existing preset by choosing File➪Print Presets➪preset name. 
When you click New or Edit in the resulting dialog box, a dialog box 
identical to the Print dialog box appears, except that the Print button 
becomes the OK button.
 
 Setup button (Windows); Page Setup and Printer buttons (Mac): These 
buttons give you access to printer-specific controls. You use these 
dialog boxes to specify options such as printing to file, paper sources, 
and printer resolution. Note that if you add a printer, you may need to 
quit InDesign and restart it for it to see the new printer.
 
 Cancel button: Clicking this button closes the Print dialog box without 
printing. Use this button if you’ve clicked Save Preset but don’t want to 
print, as well when you have any reason not to print.
 
 Print button: Clicking this button prints the document based on the 
current settings.
 
 Page preview subpane: This subpane at the lower left shows the cur-
rent settings graphically. The page is indicated by the blue rectangle, 
and the direction of the large P indicates the printing orientation; in 
Figure 23-7 the P is unrotated. The figure’s subpane shows that the 
paper itself is the same size as the page (the page is shown in white, and 
if the paper were larger than the page, you’d see a light gray area around 
the page indicating the excess paper). This preview changes as you 
adjust settings in the dialog box.
The General pane
The General pane contains the basic settings for your print job. Most are self-
explanatory, but note the following:

358
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
 
 When specifying a range of pages in the Pages Range option, you can 
type nonconsecutive ranges, such as 1–4, 7, 10–13, 15, 18, 20. If you 
want to print from a specific page to the end of the document, just type 
the hyphen after the initial page number, such as 4–. InDesign figures 
out what the last page is. Similarly, to start from the first page and end 
on a specified page, just start with the hyphen, as in –11. InDesign lets 
you type absolute page numbers in the Range field. For example, typing 
+6–+12 would print the document’s 6th through 12th pages, no matter 
what their page numbers are.
 
 Selecting the Spreads option prints facing pages on the same sheet of 
paper, such as putting two letter-size pages on one 11-×-17-inch sheet. 
This option is handy when showing clients proposed designs, but make 
sure that you have a printer that can handle a large paper size or that 
you scale the output down to fit (through the Setup pane, which I cover 
in the following section).
 
 The Options section lets you print various layout components that you 
typically don’t want in final output but may be useful when sharing 
comps and other in-progress printouts with others, such as baseline 
grids and nonprinting objects such as formatting notes.
 
 A handy control in the Options section is the Print Layers pop-up menu, 
which gives you additional control over how layers are marked as non-
printing print. The default option, Visible & Printable Layers, honors 
your layers’ printing status. Visible Layers prints all visible layers, 
including those marked as nonprinting. All Layers prints both visible 
and hidden layers, including those marked as nonprinting. (See Chapter 
5 for more on layers.)
The Setup pane
The Setup pane is where you tell InDesign how to work with the paper (or 
other media, such as film negatives) to which you’re printing. The options 
are straightforward, so I just highlight a few notes and tips:
 
 Custom paper size: Choosing some printer models will in turn let you 
choose a Custom option in the Paper Size pop-up menu, in which case 
you type the dimensions in the Width and Height fields, as well as posi-
tion the output through the Offset and Gap fields. These latter two 
options are usually used when printing to a roll, such as in an image-
setter using photo paper (called RC paper, a resin-coated paper that 
keeps details extremely sharp), so that you can make sure that a space 
appears between the left edge of the roll and the page boundary (the 
offset), as well as between pages (the gap). Most printers can’t print 
right to the edge, thus the Offset setting. You also want a gap between 
pages for crop and registration marks, as well as to have room to 
physically cut the pages.

359
 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
 
 Transverse option: Don’t use the Transverse option, which rotates the 
output 90 degrees, unless your service bureau or production depart-
ment tells you to. Otherwise, you may have your pages cut off on the 
final negatives.
 
 Tile options: Use the Tile options to print oversized documents. InDesign 
breaks the document into separate pages — called tiles — that you later 
can assemble together. To enable tiling, select the Tile check box and 
then choose the appropriate option from the adjoining pop-up menu:
 
• Manual: This option lets you specify the tiles yourself. To specify a 
tile, you change the origin point on the document ruler, and the new 
origin point becomes the upper-left corner of the current tile. (To 
change the origin point, just drag the upper-left corner of the rulers 
to a new position in your document.) To print multiple tiles this 
way, you need to adjust the origin point and print, adjust the origin 
point to the next location and print, and so on, until you’re done.
 
• Auto: This option lets InDesign figure out where to divide the 
pages into tiles. You can change the default amount of overlap 
between tiles of 1.5 inches by using the Overlap field. The overlap 
lets you easily align tiles by having enough overlap for you to see 
where each should be placed relative to the others.
 
• Auto Justified: This option is similar to Auto except that it makes 
each tile the same size, adjusting the overlap if needed to do that. 
(The Auto option, by contrast, simply starts at the origin point and 
then does as much of the page as will fit in the tile, which means 
the last tile may be a different width than the others.) You can see 
the difference between the two by watching how the page preview 
window at left changes as you select each option.
The Marks and Bleed pane
The Bleed and Slug area of the Marks and Bleed pane controls how materi-
als print past the page boundary. A bleed is used when you want a picture, 
color, or text to go right to the edge of the paper. Because there is slight 
variation on positioning when you print because the paper moves mechani-
cally through rollers and might move slightly during transit, publishers have 
any to-the-edge materials actually print beyond the edge so that gaps never 
appear. It’s essentially a safety margin. A normal bleed margin is 0p9 (
1⁄8 inch), 
although you can make it larger if you want.
A slug is an area beyond the bleed area in which you want printer’s marks to 
appear. The reader never sees this area, but the workers at the commercial 
printer do, and it helps them make sure that they have the right pages, colors, 
and so on. Like the bleed, the slug area is trimmed off when the pages are 
bound into a magazine, newspaper, or whatever. (The word slug is an old news-
paper term for this identifying information, based on the lead slug once used 

360
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
for this purpose on old printing presses.) The purpose of the slug is to ensure 
that you have enough room for all the printer’s marks to appear between the 
bleed area and the edges of the page. Otherwise, InDesign does the best it can.
It’s best to define your bleed and slug areas in your document itself 
when you create the document in the New Document dialog box (choose 
File➪New➪Document [Ô+N or Ctrl+N]), as covered in Chapter 3. You can 
also use the Document Setup dialog box. (Choose File➪Document Setup 
[Option+Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+P].) The two dialog boxes have the same options; if 
they don’t show the Bleed and Slug section, click More Options to see it.
But if you didn’t define your bleeds previously, you can do so in the Print 
dialog box’s Marks and Bleed pane. You can also override those New 
Document or Document Setup document settings here. To use the document 
settings, select the Use Document Bleed Settings option. Otherwise, type in 
a bleed area by using the Top, Bottom, Left, and Right fields. If you want the 
four fields to be the same, click the broken-chain iconic button to the right of 
the Top field; it becomes a solid chain, indicating that all four fields will have 
the same value if any are modified. Any bleed area is indicated in red in the 
preview pane at the bottom left.
If you want to set the slug area, select the Include Slug Area option. InDesign 
then reserves any slug area defined in the New Document or Document Setup 
dialog box. You can’t set up the slug area in the Print dialog box.
The Output pane
The next pane is the Output pane, which controls the processing of colors 
and inks on imagesetters, platesetters, and commercial printing equipment. 
For proof printing, such as to a laser printer or an inkjet printer, the only 
option that you need to worry about is on the Color pop-up menu, which 
controls whether the colors print as color or as grayscale.
 
The options in the Output pane are for experts and should be specified in 
coordination with your service bureau and commercial printer — these 
options can really mess up your printing if set incorrectly.
One area that you should set is in the Ink Manager dialog box. Accessed by 
clicking Ink Manager, the Ink Manager dialog box, shown in Figure 23-8, gives 
you finer controls over how color negatives output. If any colors should have 
been converted to process color but weren’t, you have three choices:
 
 Click the spot color iconic button. You can override the spot color in 
the Ink Manager dialog box by clicking this button (a circle icon) to the 
left of the color’s name. That action converts the spot color to a process 
color. (Clicking the process color button, a four-color box icon, converts 
a color back to a spot color.) This is the way to go for a quick fix.

361
 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
 
 Make the spot color a process color instead. Do so by closing 
the Ink Manager and Print dialog boxes and editing the color that 
was incorrectly set as a spot color in the Swatches panel (choose 
Window➪Swatches [F5]), as I cover in Chapter 6. Using the Swatches 
panel instead of fixing this color setting at output time in the Print dialog 
box ensures that the color is permanently changed to a process color 
for future print jobs.
 
 Convert all spot colors to CMYK process equivalents. Do so by select-
ing the All Spots to Process option. This method is the easiest way 
to make sure that you don’t accidentally print spot-color plates for a 
CMYK-only document.
The other Ink Manager options are for experts and should be changed only 
in consultation with your service bureau, production department, and/or 
commercial printer.

pane (left) 
and the Ink 
Manager 
dialog box

The Graphics pane
By using the Graphics pane, you control how graphics are printed and how 
fonts are downloaded. The options here are meant for professional printing, 
such as to imagesetters, in situations where you’re working with a service 
bureau or in-house printing department. This pane is also an expert area, so 
change these settings only after consulting with an experienced pro.

362
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
The Color Management pane
The Color Management pane is where you manage color output (apply color 
calibration). Most options should be changed only in consultation with your 
service bureau or production department.
One option you should be able to change on your own is Printer Profile. Use 
this pop-up menu to select the device to which the document will ultimately 
be printed. This printer is by default the same as the profile selected in the 
Edit Color Settings dialog box, which I cover earlier in this chapter, in the 
section “Calibrating Color.”
The Advanced pane
The options in the Advanced pane let you control graphics file substitutions 
in an Open Prepress Interface (OPI) workflow and also set transparency flat-
tening, which controls how transparent and semitransparent objects are 
handled during output. Again, you should change these expert options only 
in consultation with your service bureau or production department.
The Summary pane
The final Print dialog box pane is the Summary pane. It simply lists your settings 
all in one place for easy review. The only option — Save Summary — saves the 
settings to a file so that you can include it with your files when delivering them 
to a service bureau or for distribution to other staff members so that they know 
the preferred settings.
Creating a Document Package
Have you ever given a page-layout document to a service bureau only to be 
called several hours later because some of the files necessary to output your 
document are missing? If so, you’ll love the Package feature in InDesign.
This command, which you access by choosing File➪Package (Option+Shift+
Ô+P or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P), copies into a folder all the font, color-output, and 
graphics files necessary to output your document. It also generates a report 
that contains all the information about your document that a service bureau 
is ever likely to need, including the document’s fonts, dimensions, and trap-
ping information. You can also create an instructions file that has your contact 
information and any particulars you want to say about the document.

363
 Chapter 23: Printing Your Work
When you run the Package command, InDesign preflights your document 
automatically and gives you the option of viewing any problems it encoun-
ters. If you elect to view that information, the Preflight dialog box appears. 
You can continue to package your document from that dialog box by clicking 
Package after you assure yourself that none of the problems will affect the 
document’s output. If it finds no problems during the automatic preflighting, 
InDesign doesn’t display the Preflight dialog box.
 
Although InDesign CS4 preflights your document automatically by default, as 
the “Checking Your Document before Printing” section, earlier in this chapter 
explains, the Package command still does its own preflighting, using a core 
set of issues that Adobe has decided need to be handled even if you let them 
slide in your own preflighting. You can of course ignore them, but don’t expect 
great output results if you do.
Before you can actually package the document, InDesign asks you to save 
the current document and then fill in the Printing Instructions form. You can 
change the default filename from Instructions.txt to something more 
suitable, such as the name of your print job. Often, you’ll leave the printing 
instructions blank — use the form only if you have special instructions.
 
If you don’t want to create an instructions form when packaging a docu-
ment, don’t click Cancel — it cancels the entire package operation. Just click 
Continue, leaving the form blank. Similarly, you must click Save at the request 
to save the document; clicking Cancel stops the package operation as well.
The next step is to create the package folder. You do so in the dialog box 
that follows the Printing Instructions form, which on the Mac is called Create 
Package Folder and in Windows is called Package Publication. Figure 23-9 
shows the Mac version, which, except for the name at the top, is the same as 
the Windows version.
In the dialog box, you can select what is copied: the fonts, color-output 
profiles, and linked graphics (graphics pasted into an InDesign document 
rather than imported are automatically included). You can also tell InDesign 
to update the graphics links for those that were modified or moved; if this 
Update Graphic Links in Package option isn’t selected, any missing or modi-
fied graphics files won’t be copied with the document.
You can tell InDesign to include fonts and links from hidden layers (which 
you’d do only if you want the service bureau to print those hidden layers 
or if you were giving the document’s files to a colleague to do further work).
You also can specify whether the document should use only the hyphen-
ation exceptions defined within it. This option often makes sense because it 
ensures that the printer’s hyphenation dictionary — which may differ from 
yours — doesn’t cause text to flow differently.

364
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
 
Figure 23-9: 
The Create 
Package 
Folder 
dialog box 
for Mac is 
called the 
Package 
Publication 
dialog box in 
Windows.
 
Finally, you can choose to view the report after the package is created — on 
the Mac, InDesign launches TextEdit and displays the report file, and on 
Windows it launches Notepad and displays the report file.
Click Save (on the Mac) or Package (in Windows) when everything is ready to 
go. Your document is placed in the folder you specify, as is the instructions 
file (the report). Inside that folder, InDesign also creates a folder called Fonts 
that includes the fonts, a folder called Links that has the graphics files, and a 
folder called Output Profiles that has the color output profiles.
Don’t panic when you see a dialog box appear that warns you that sharing 
fonts could be illegal. If you’re working with a reputable service bureau, 
they’ll use the packaged fonts only for your job and then delete them. A font 
license typically allows you to share fonts for such temporary usage, but of 
course not to give away fonts to others for other uses. Anyone who needs the 
fonts on an ongoing basis should buy them.
I strongly recommend using the Package feature. It ensures that your service 
bureau has all the necessary files and information to output your document 
correctly.

 Taking advantage of hyperlinks and cross-references

 Exporting Flash files, PDFs, and eBook files
 Getting your work to the Web
P
ublishing is no longer about just print. Documents exist in electronic 
form as well, delivered on CD, from file servers, and over the Web. And 
the definition of “document” has changed, going from static text and images 
to a wider palette of media types, including sound and video, and a host of 
new actions — think hyperlinks, animated rollovers based on your louse 
movement, and buttons that initiate actions like turning a page or playing a 
movie.
Over the years, InDesign has steadily added to its dynamic repertoire. 
InDesign CS4 adds a bunch more: slideshow-style page transitions, Flash file 
export, and a cross-reference capability.
Using Hyperlinks
Web pages, Flash files, and PDF files can include hyperlinks, the clickable hot 
spots that direct a browser to open a new file or page. It’s a whole new way 
to deliver related contents through an active cross-reference. And InDesign 
lets you add hyperlinks to your documents, so if they’re exported to the PDF 
or Web formats, those links are clickable.
InDesign uses its Hyperlinks panel (Window➪Interactive➪Hyperlinks) to add, 
edit, and delete hyperlinks. In a sense, a hyperlink is a character attribute — 
it’s applied to selected text. Figure 24-1 shows the Hyperlinks panel and its 
flyout menu.

InDesign CS4 overhauls the Hyperlinks panel, with many new and changed 
options.
Creating hyperlinks
Although the process is straightforward, InDesign’s terminology can make it a 
very confusing on how to start. You first create a hyperlink destination — the 
place a hyperlink goes to, or its target — by choosing New Hyperlink Destination 
from the Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu. Figure 24-2 shows the dialog box. You 
give the destination a name in the Name field and then choose from one of the 
three options in the Type menu:
 
 URL: This option is a Web page address (the official name is Uniform 
Resource Locator), as shown in the New Hyperlink Destination dialog 
box in Figure 24-2. If you select this option, InDesign displays the URL 
field in which you type the Web address.
 
 Page: This option lets you specify a specific page in a selected docu-
ment. If you select this option, InDesign provides a Page field in which 
you specify the page number to open in the selected document, as well 
as the Zoom Setting pop-up menu, which lets you select how the page 
is displayed. (Options are Fixed, meaning at the default size in Adobe 

367
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
Reader; Fit View; Fit in Window; Fit Width; Fit Height; Fit Visible; and 
Inherit Zoom, which uses the current zoom setting in Adobe Reader.)
 
 Text Anchor: This option lets you specify a specific piece of text (the 
selected text) in the selected document.
 
Figure 24-2: 
The New 
Hyperlink 
Destination 
dialog box’s 
three vari-
ants are 
(from top 
to bottom) 
URL, Text 
Anchor, and 
Page.
 
With the destinations defined, you can now create the hyperlinks to them 
(the hyperlink sources).
To create a hyperlink source:
 
1. Select the text or frame you want to be a hyperlink’s source (what the 
reader clicks to go to the link) and then choose New Hyperlink from 
the Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu.
 
 The New Hyperlink dialog box, shown in Figure 24-3, appears.
 
2. Use the Link To pop-up menu to determine what you’re hyperlinking to.
 
 You have the same three options as in the New Hyperlink Destination 
dialog box’s Type menu — Page, Text Anchor, and URL — as well as 
three new ones: Email, File, and Shared Destination.

368
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
 
 
 
 Email lets you enter an e-mail address, as well as a default subject for 
that e-mail, if you like. File lets you point to any file and make that into a 
link; of course, any file you link to this way needs to be something your 
reader has the software to open. Shared Destination lets you select an 
InDesign document, including the current one, and then select from any 
destinations of any type defined in it.
 
 With the URL, Email, and File options, you can enable the Shared 
Destination check box, which makes the new hyperlink visible to other 
users through the Shared Destination option in the Linked To pop-up 
menu.
 
3. In the Character Style section, you can tell InDesign to apply a specific 
character style to the hyperlinked text.
 
4. In the Appearance section, you can control how the hyperlink appears 
on-screen:
 
• Use the Type pop-up menu to choose Invisible Rectangle or Visible 
Rectangle. The Invisible Rectangle option gives no visual indica-
tion that the text contains a hyperlink, except that the mouse 
pointer becomes a hand icon when the reader maneuvers through 
the document. (You’d typically pick this option when you’ve 
used blue underline as a character attribute for the hyperlink text 
to mirror the standard Web way of indicating a hyperlink.) The 
Visible Rectangle option puts a box around the text using the fol-
lowing four settings. (They’re grayed out if Invisible Rectangle is 
selected.)
Figure 24-3: 
The New 
Hyperlink 
dialog box.

369
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
 
• The Highlight pop-up menu lets you choose how the source text 
or frame is highlighted: None, Invert (reserve the foreground and 
background colors), Outline (places a line around the source), and 
Inset (places a line around the source, but inside any frame stroke; 
for text, it’s the same as Outline).
 
• The Color pop-up menu displays Web-safe colors, as well as any 
colors you defined in the document.
 
• The Width pop-up menu lets you choose the thickness of the line 
used in the Outline and Inset options from the Highlight pop-up 
menu. The choices are Thin, Medium, and Thick.
 
• You can choose the type of line in the Style pop-up menu: Solid or 
Dashed.
 
5. When you’re done defining the hyperlink source, click OK.
 
If your text includes a valid hyperlink, such as www.InDesignCentral.com, 
you can select it and create a URL hyperlink automatically by choosing New 
Hyperlink from URL in the Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu.
After your hyperlink sources are defined, you can easily apply them by 
selecting text and clicking an existing hyperlink source from the Hyperlinks 
panel. You can also jump to the source or destination by selecting the 
desired hyperlink in the Hyperlinks panel and choosing either Go to Source 
or Go to Destination from the flyout menu or click the Go to Hyperlink Source 
or Go to Hyperlink Destination iconic buttons at the bottom of the panel. 
These “go to” options make a handy way to verify the links are correct.
Remember that I said that InDesign’s hyperlinks feature is confusing? Well, 
you may have noticed that when creating hyperlink sources, you see a sec-
tion in the dialog box where you indicate what kind of hyperlink you’re creat-
ing. Hmmm. That means that when you’re creating hyperlink sources, you’re 
also creating hyperlink destinations — which you are. So what’s the point 
of the New Hyperlink Destinations dialog box covered in the previous sec-
tion? It’s to create destinations before you have a place to link them from, at 
least for the three types of links supported by the New Hyperlink Destination 
dialog box: URLs, text anchors, and pages in the current document. So, when 
you want to add hyperlinks to existing text and objects, use New Hyperlink. 
When you want to create hyperlinks to be applied later, use New Hyperlink 
Destination.
While we’re at it, also keep in mind one more intricacy of using InDesign’s 
hyperlink destinations: The Shared Destination option in the Link To pop-up 
menu in the New Hyperlink dialog box lets you choose any previously cre-
ated hyperlink destinations in the document selected in the Document 
pop-up menu — both those created via the New Hyperlink Destination dialog 
box and those created via the New Hyperlinks dialog box.

370
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
Modifying and deleting hyperlinks
To modify hyperlink sources: Choose Hyperlink Options from the Hyperlinks 
panel’s flyout menu to open the Hyperlink Options dialog box, which has 
the same options as the New Hyperlink dialog box, shown in Figure 24-3, 
to modify the source. Similarly, to modify hyperlink destinations, choose 
Hyperlink Destination Options from the palette menu to open the Hyperlink 
Destination Options dialog box and then select the target from the Name 
pop-up menu. The Hyperlink Destination Options dialog box’s options are the 
same as the New Hyperlink Destination dialog box, shown in Figure 24-2.
You can change the source text or frame by selecting it, clicking the hyper-
link name in the Hyperlinks panel, and finally choosing Reset Hyperlink from 
the panel’s flyout menu. To change the target for a hyperlink to an InDesign 
document, choose Update Hyperlink from the flyout menu (press and hold 
Option or Alt to select a file that is not open).
To delete a hyperlink target, choose it in the Hyperlink Destination Options 
dialog box and then click Delete. (Click Delete All to delete all targets defined 
in the document.)
To delete a hypertext source, select it in the Hyperlinks panel and then 
choose Delete Hyperlink from the flyout menu or click the Delete Selected 
Hyperlinks iconic button at the bottom of the panel.
Where hyperlinks will work
Being able to create hyperlinks in InDesign is 
great. But be aware that not all links will be 
preserved in your exported documents. Here’s 
what is kept for each type of Web or multimedia 
file you can export:
  PDF files: All hyperlinks are retained except 
those that specify a specific page in an 
external document.
  eBook files: No hyperlinks are retained for 
objects (such as frames). For hyperlinks 
applied to text selections, hyperlinks to files, 
to anchored text in the current document, 
to Web addresses, and to e-mail addresses 
are retained.
  Flash files: All hyperlinks are retained 
except those that specify a specific page 
in an external document and those to 
an e-mail address. Also, any hyperlinks 
that appear in or over objects that have 
transparency applied will not be retained.
  Web pages: Only hyperlinks applied to text 
selections (not to objects such as frames or 
graphics) are retained, and even then only 
hyperlinks to files, to anchored text in the 
current document, to Web addresses, and 
to e-mail addresses are retained. Also, text 
anchor destination links in the document 
(including bookmarks) are retained.
As you can see, InDesign’s Hyperlinks panel 
lets you create more kinds of links than you can 
actually use in exported documents. That’s a 
pity.

371
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
 
When you export your InDesign files to PDF files (choose File➪Export [Ô+E 
or Ctrl+E], and choose Adobe PDF from the Format pop-up menu), be sure 
to select the Hyperlinks option in the Include section of the General pane 
in the Export PDF dialog box. If you export to the XHTML format to create a 
Web page from your InDesign document (File➪ Export for Dreamweaver), the 
hyperlinks are included automatically. (And note that you don’t need to use 
Adobe’s Dreamweaver Web-editing software to work on these exported Web 
pages; any HTML editor or text editor will do.)
Working with cross-references
 
InDesign CS4 uses the Hyperlinks panel to add a related capability: cross-
references. Automated cross-references are used just for text, such as to 
automatically keep page numbers and chapter titles updated in text such as 
see page 227 and Learn more about color in the chapter “All about Color.”
To work with cross-references, you have two choices for their “to” locations. 
You can specify specific locations by adding text anchors in your documents 
using the hyperlinks destination feature described in the previous section. 
Then you select that text anchor in the New Cross-Reference dialog box. Or 
you can just choose from a list of paragraphs and make the cross-reference 
link to that selected paragraph in the New Cross-Reference dialog box.
You open the New Cross-Reference dialog box, shown in Figure 24-4, by 
choosing Insert Cross-Reference from the Hyperlink s panel’s flyout menu or 
by clicking its Create New Cross-Reference iconic button.
In the Linked To pop-up menu, choose Text Anchor if your “to” destination 
is a text anchor. If you want to select a specific paragraph instead, choose 
Paragraph; InDesign shows all the first words of each paragraph in the docu-
ment so that you can scroll through the list and choose the desired one. You 
can also filter that list by choosing from the styles at left; only paragraphs 
with the selected style appear (so, for example, you can see just headings by 
choosing the paragraph style for your headings).
Use the Cross-Reference Format section of the New Cross-Reference dialog 
box to control what text displays for that cross-reference. You can be as 
basic as the page number (note that the word page appears with it automati-
cally) or as complex as, for example, showing the full paragraph text (such as 
a heading) and the page number.

You can create your own cross-reference formats and modify the existing ones 
by using the Cross-Reference Formats dialog box shown in Figure 24-5. This is 
an expert feature, so I don’t cover it in detail, but feel free to experiment.
To open that dialog box, click the button to the right of the Format pop-up 
menu in the New Cross-Reference dialog box (handy when you want to create 
a new format as you are adding a cross-reference) or choose Define Cross-
Reference Formats from the Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu. You can also 
edit an existing format this way.
 
Figure 24-5: 
The Cross-
Reference 
Formats 
dialog box.
 

373
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
The basic procedure for a cross-reference format is to add the text you want 
to display for any cross-references using the format combined with the codes 
for the text that is added and updated automatically. Use the iconic pop-up 
menu (the + symbol) to the right of the Definition shown in Figure 24-5 to 
select those codes. The iconic pop-up menu below it (the @ symbol) lets you 
choose special characters, such as em spaces. You can also have a charac-
ter style applied to the cross-reference text as part of that format using the 
Character Style for Cross-Reference option.
You can control how the cross-reference appears using the Appearance 
section’s controls. They work just like the Appearance controls in the New 
Hyperlinks dialog box, covered in the previous section.
 
To edit an existing cross-reference, choose Cross-Reference Options from the 
Hyperlinks panel’s flyout menu; it’s identical to the New Cross-References 
dialog box.
Adding bookmarks
PDF files use something called bookmarks to 
help readers find information in the file. In a PDF 
file, a bookmark list acts like a table-of-contents 
list in a printed book, except that if you click 
a bookmark item, Adobe Reader or Acrobat 
brings you to the page the bookmark refers to 
(see figure).
(continued)
When you export to PDF, as explained in the 
“Exporting PDF Files” section later in this chap-
ter, you can tell InDesign to take any table of 
contents set for the document and create PDF 
bookmarks from it. (Chapter 20 explains how to 
set up tables of contents.)
But you can add your own independent book-
marks in addition to whatever is in the table 
of contents. Open the Bookmarks panel 
(Window➪Interactive➪Bookmarks) and then 
choose what you want to bookmark. To do so, 
simply select some text or an object (frame or 
line); if nothing is selected, the bookmark is to 
the current page. Then choose New Bookmark 
from the Bookmarks panel’s flyout menu or 
click the Add Bookmarks iconic button — the

Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
Adding Sounds and Video
InDesign treats movies and sounds like any other file: You place them with 
the Place command (File➪Place [Ô+D or Ctrl+D]) into your layout. Movies 
display as an image based on their first frame, while sounds display as a 
speaker icon and print and export that way.
InDesign’s sound and movie format support is limited:
 
 InDesign can open QuickTime (MOV files) and Microsoft AVI movies, so 
be sure your movies are in one of those formats. These movies can be 
used only in exported PDF (Version 1.6 and later) files.
 
 InDesign also supports Adobe Flash animations (SWF files), though it 
can export those only to PDF Version 1.6 and later files, as well as for 
use in Flash files and HTML pages.

page icon — at the bottom of the panel. After 
you create the bookmark, choose the Rename 
Bookmark option in the flyout menu to give it 
a meaningful name (see figure); this name 
appears in the Bookmarks pane in Adobe 
Reader or Acrobat.
If you want a bookmark to be a subentry of 
another bookmark — the equivalent to a 
second-level or third-level headline in a table of 
contents — make sure that, before you create 
the bookmark, you select a bookmark in the 
Bookmarks panel. Any new bookmark is made 
a child of the selected bookmark.
The other Bookmarks panel flyout menu options 
are straightforward:
  Choose Delete Bookmark to delete any 
bookmarks selected in the panel. (You can 
also click the Delete Bookmarks iconic 
button — the trashcan icon — at the bottom 
of the panel.)
  Choose Go to Selected Bookmark to jump 
to that page in your InDesign document. 
An easier way is to simply double-click the 
bookmark entry in the pane.
  Choose Sort Benchmarks to sort bench-
mark subentries — this alphabetizes 
second-level, third-level, and other page-
based subentries, and it sorts in order of 
appearance on the page any text- and/
or object-based entries. It does not sort 
the top-level bookmarks, which appear in 
sequential order from the beginning of the 
document.

 For sounds, it supports just the Apple AIFF and Microsoft WAV formats 
and can export them only to PDF files.
To control how a movie behaves and what control the reader has, choose 
Object➪Interactive➪ Movie Options. For sounds, choose Object➪ Interactive➪ 
Sound Options. The Movie Options dialog box or Sound Options dialog box 
appears, as appropriate. Figure 24-6 shows them both.
 
A faster way to set movie and sound settings is to double-click the frame 
containing the movie or sound.
These movie and sound features are expert options, but ones that you should 
play with to see what you can do with them.

Adding Buttons, Rollovers, 
and Other Actions
You’ve no doubt seen those cool Web pages where as your mouse passes over 
an object, it changes color or makes something pop up on screen. Or clicking it 
makes a movie play or other action occur. InDesign lets you add such capabili-
ties to your documents destined for export to the Web, Flash files, or PDF files.
You set up these actions and states in the Button panel (Window➪Interactive➪
Button). Figure 24-7 shows the panel, with the Event pop-up menu, the flyout 
menu, and the Actions pop-up menu all active (I composited this image; only 
one can display at a time in real life).

Figure 24-7: 
The Button 
panel (left),

menu 
(center), 
and the

pop-up 
menu (right).
 
 
The Buttons panel replaces the States panel from previous versions of 
InDesign and adds a few new states to match what Web browsers can support. 
Also, InDesign CS4 no longer has a Button tool to create buttons; instead, you 
convert any selected item to a button.
Although the Button panel and related controls are expert features, I 
describe the basic principles here.
The first thing you need to do is create a button — something for a reader 
to click. Any object can be a button, so choose the desired object with the 
Selection tool and then click the Convert Object to Button iconic button at the 
bottom of the Button panel or choose Object➪Interactive➪Convert to Button. 
The object then appears in the Button panel with an initial [Normal] state 
appearance, which is how it will appear unless the reader does something 
with it. (You can also choose an existing button from a library that InDesign 
includes; just choose Sample Buttons from the Button panel’s flyout menu.)
Each button has three possible state appearances: [Normal], [Click], and 
[Rollover]. To add a [Click] state, choose On Click from the Event pop-up 
menu and then select [Click] and enable its appearance. (Click the empty 
box to its left; if the box displays an eye icon, the state will be visible when 
the user clicks the button.) You can change the button’s color in its [Click] 
state by just clicking a swatch from the Swatches panel (Windows➪Swatches, 
[F5]) when the [Click] state is selected in the Button panel. You can also use 
the Stroke panel (Windows➪Stroke [Ô+F10 or Ctrl+F10]) or the Effects panel 
(Window➪Effects [Shift+Ô+F10 or Ctrl+Shift+F10]) to adjust the button’s 
[Click] state appearance.
Use the same technique to adjust the appearance of the [Rollover] state 
(used with the On Rollover option in the Event pop-up menu. You can use 
any (or several) of the states with the other Event pop-up menu options; 
whatever has the eye icon displayed for that option is what the button will 
display when the user takes the designated action.

377
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
Most of the events are self-explanatory — On Click, On Rollover, On Roll Off, 
and On Release — but two are not: On Blur and On Focus. These rarely used 
events essentially let you highlight (focus) specific frames on a Web page or 
dehighlight (blur) them. All these terms are used by Web-editing programs, 
such as Adobe Dreamweaver, that expert users typically use.
In addition, each event can have one or more actions assigned to it, using 
the + iconic button below the Event pop-up menu. (Use the – iconic button to 
remove a selected action.) Clicking the + button displays the Actions pop-up 
menu, shown in Figure 24-7. You choose the desired action for the current 
event and then set up its specifics in the dialog box that appears.
By combining state appearances, events, and actions, you can create a truly 
interactive document. Once done, the next step is to export the document to 
the desired electronic format.
Exporting Flash Files
 
InDesign CS4 now lets you export documents, or specific pages, as Flash files. 
When you choose File➪Export (Ô+E or Ctrl+E), you get a dialog box, where 
among the various Format pop-up menu (Mac) or Save as Type pop-up menu 
(Windows) options are two Flash options: Adobe Flash CS4 Pro (XFL) and SWF.
 
 An XFL file is one that Adobe Flash Professional CS4 can open for further 
work, and is the option you should pick if the InDesign-exported file is 
meant to be the starting point for your Flash file.
 
 A SWF file is a ready-to-play file that can contain animations or, in the 
case of those generated from InDesign, rollovers and actions; you can’t 
edit a SWF file. SWF files are playable by the Adobe Flash Player, either 
directly on a computer or via a Web browser.
Figure 24-8 shows the Export dialog boxes for each Flash option. The options 
let you control the size of the exported file, which pages are exported, how text 
is handled (kept as Flash text, meaning it’s editable in Flash Pro and embeds 
the fonts, or converted either to vector images or to bitmapped images), and 
whether pages are rasterized (converted to bitmapped images). The XFL export 
has additional controls over which interactive effects, such as buttons and 
hyperlinks, are exported, as well as how images are compressed.

Exporting PDF Files
Sometimes you want to create a PDF file for distribution on the Web, on 
a CD, on a corporate intranet, or even by e-mail. PDF creation is a simple 
task in InDesign. First choose File➪Export (Ô+E or Ctrl+E) and then choose 
Adobe PDF in the Format pop-up menu (Mac) or Save as Type pop-up menu 
(Windows).
 
If you’re working with the InDesign book feature (see Chapter 22), you can 
export all of the book’s chapters to a single PDF file from an open book’s panel 
by using the Export Book to PDF option in its flyout menu. (If one or more 
documents in the book are selected in the panel, the menu option changes to 
Export Selected Documents to PDF.) The setup options are the same as for 
exporting individual documents.
After you select Adobe PDF in the Export dialog box’s Formats pop-up menu 
and give the file a name and location in the File Name and Save in areas, 
click Save to get the Export Adobe PDF dialog box, shown in Figure 24-9. The 
dialog box has six panes; the General pane is displayed when you open the 
dialog box. Several options are accessible from all six panes.
If you know how to use Acrobat Professional, you know how to set up your 
PDF export. If not, consult with a local expert because PDF export options are 
as complex and job-specific as the print options I cover in Chapter 23.
Some basic options are available in all the panes, and you should feel com-
fortable setting them on your own:

379
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
 
 Adobe PDF Preset pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you select from 
both predefined sets of PDF-export settings (similar to the printer pre-
sets covered earlier in this chapter), as well as any presets you or some-
one else may have created.
 
 Compatibility pop-up menu: This pop-up menu lets you choose which 
PDF file version to save the file as. Your options are Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3), 
Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4), Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5), Acrobat 7 (PDF 1.6), Acrobat 8 
(PDF 1.7), and Acrobat 9 (PDF 1.8).
 
 Choosing Acrobat 4 (PDF 1.3) is the best option for plain documents that 
you want to distribute on CD or over the Web because it ensures the 
broadest number of people will be able to view the file. But it also limits 
the ability to use some features, particularly those that protect the doc-
ument from unauthorized usage such as copying its contents.
 
 Choose a later version if you need specific features. For example, choose 
Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) or later if your document uses transparency or high-
level security settings. Use Acrobat 7 (PDF 1.6) or later for files with 
video, audio, and other multimedia features.
 
 Save Preset button: Click this option to save any settings made in the 
Export Adobe PDF dialog box as a new preset. (You can also define new 
PDF presets by choosing File➪PDF Export Presets➪Define.)
 
 Export button: Click this option to create the PDF file based on the 
settings that you selected in the various panes.

Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
The General pane
Use the General pane, shown in Figure 24-9, to determine what is exported. 
The Pages option gives you the same flexibility as the Print dialog box’s Pages 
option, which I cover in Chapter 23. Similarly, the Spread option works like the 
same-name option in the Print dialog box, also covered in that chapter.
In the Options section, you can select the following options:
 
 Embed Page Thumbnails: Select this option if you’re creating a PDF file 
to be viewed on-screen. Thumbnails help people to more easily navigate 
your document in the Adobe Reader program. However, if you’re send-
ing the PDF files to a service bureau or commercial printer for printing, 
you don’t need to generate the thumbnails.
 
 Optimize for Fast Web View: Always select this option. It minimizes file 
size without compromising the output.
 
 Create Tagged PDF: Select this option to embed XML tag information into 
the PDF file. It’s useful for XML-based workflows and Adobe eBooks. If you 
don’t know what XML or eBooks are, you don’t need to select this option.
 
 View PDF after Exporting: Select this option if you want to see the 
results of the PDF export as soon as the export is complete. Typically, 
however, you shouldn’t select this option because you’ll likely have 
other things you want to do before launching Adobe Reader (or the full 
Acrobat program, if you own it) to proof your files.
 
 Create Acrobat Layers: If you selected Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) or later in 
the Compatibility pop-up menu, you can select this option, which out-
puts any InDesign layers to separate layers in Acrobat. (Acrobat 6 was 
the first version of Acrobat to support layers.) If you choose an earlier 
version in the Compatibility option, Create Acrobat Layers is grayed out.
 
 Export Layers: This new pop-up menu gives you additional control over 
how layers marked as nonprinting are exported to the PDF file. It used 
to be that if you marked a layer as nonprinting, you’d have to leave the 
Export Adobe PDF dialog box to open the Layers panel to make it export-
able. Now, you can skip that step and override layers’ nonprinting status 
using this pop-up menu. The default option, Visible & Printable Layers, 
honors your layers’ printing status. Visible Layers exports all visible 
layers, including those marked as nonprinting. All Layers exports both 
visible and hidden layers, including those marked as nonprinting. (See 
Chapter 5 for more on layers.)
In the Include section, you set what elements of the document are included in 
the PDF file. You can select the following options:
 
 Bookmarks: This option takes InDesign table-of-contents (TOC) information 
and preserves it as bookmarks in the exported PDF file. (See Chapter 20 for 
details on TOCs.)

381
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
 
 Hyperlinks: This choice preserves any hyperlinks added in InDesign. 
Otherwise, the hyperlinks are converted to standard text in the PDF file. 
(Chapter 22 explains how to create hyperlinks in InDesign.)
 
 Visible Guides and Grids: This setting includes the on-screen guides and 
grids in the output version — an option you’d use only when creating PDF 
files meant to be used as designer examples, not for readers or for prepress.
 
 Non-Printing Objects: This option includes any objects marked as 
Nonprinting through the Attributes pane. (Choose Window➪Attributes.)
 
 Interactive Elements: This option preserves interactive objects, such as 
buttons, rather than convert them to static graphics.
 
 Multimedia: This pop-up menu lets you control how embedded sound 
and video are handled. This option is available only if you choose Acrobat 
6 (PDF 1.5) or later in the Compatibility pop-up menu. The options are 
Use Object Settings, Link All, or Embed All. In InDesign, you can embed a 
sound or movie file, or link to one. This option lets you override the indi-
vidual settings and make all such objects embedded or linked.
Security pane
The Security pane is used to protect your documents from unauthorized 
usage or copying — something you should strongly consider doing for PDF 
files distributed on the Web or in other electronic media.
To enable such protections, be sure the Require a Password to Open the 
Document and the Use a Password to Restrict Printing, Editing, and Other 
Tasks options are enabled. Here’s how their settings work:
 
 Encryption Level: This section’s options depend on the option set in 
the Compatibility pop-up menu; Acrobat 5 (PDF 1.4) and higher use High 
(128-Bit RC4) encryption, while earlier versions use 40-bit RC4.
 
 Document Open Password: In this section of the Security pane, you 
can require a password to open the exported PDF file by selecting this 
option and typing a password in the associated text field. If you don’t 
type a password here, you’re forced to type one in a dialog box that 
appears later. To access protected content, recipients must use the 
Security pane in Acrobat. (Choose File➪Document Properties [Ô+D or 
Ctrl+D] in Acrobat.)
 
 Permissions: Here, you determine what restrictions to place on the PDF 
file. Note that the following options vary based on what version of the 
PDF format you selected in the General pane.
 
• Use a Password to Restrict Printing, Editing, and Other Tasks: You 
can restrict recipients’ actions by selecting this option and then 
specifying permissible actions by using the Printing Allowed and 
Changes Allowed pop-up menus, as well as selecting from among the 

382
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
options that follow. (The number of options displayed varies based 
on the preset chosen.) You can also require a password to allow 
editing of the file in another application.
 
• Printing Allowed: You can select None, Low-Resolution (150 dpi), 
or High Resolution. You would disable printing to ensure that the 
material can be read only on-screen.
 
• Changes Allowed: You can select None; Inserting, Deleting and 
Rotating Pages; Filling in Form Fields and Signing; Commenting, 
Filling in Form Fields, and Signing; or Any Except Extracting Pages. 
(Signing means using digital signatures to verify sender and recipi-
ent identities.)
 
• Enable Copying of Text, Images, and Other Content: If it’s okay 
for recipients to use the PDF file’s objects, select this option.
 
• Enable Text Access of Screen Reader Devices for the Visually 
Impaired: If you want the file to be accessible to visually impaired 
recipients who use text-reader applications, select this option. 
This option is available only if you’re exporting to Acrobat 5 (PDF 
1.4) or later.
 
• Enable Plaintext Metadata: For documents with metadata — author-
ing information associated with XML documents and Web pages — 
you can make that metadata visible to Web-based search engines and 
similar applications by selecting this option. This option is available 
only if you’re exporting to Acrobat 6 (PDF 1.5) or later.
Exporting to eBook Format
Adobe has created a hybrid document format that combines some PDF and 
some Web capabilities, Called an eBook, it’s meant to be a way to deliver 
books in a rich-media way for electronic readers and via Adobe’s own Digital 
Editions software. Not many people use this format, so I don’t dwell on it.
To export a layout to eBook format, simply choose File➪Export for Digital 
Editions. You get the Save As dialog box, where you choose the disk and 
folder to store the exported Web page, as well as the page’s filename. After 
you click Save, you get the Digital Editions Export Options dialog box, shown 
in Figure 24-10, in which you specify how InDesign converts the layout to the 
eBook format. Unless you’re eBook-savvy, ask your boss what settings to use. 
Here are the basics:
 
 In the General pane, you choose how to handle bulleted and numbered 
lists are handled (see the next section on exporting to the Web), as well 
as how styles are converted to the Web’s CSS format (also in the next 
section).

383
 Chapter 24: Multimedia Project Basics
 
 In the Images pane, you choose how your images are converted to the 
Web’s GIF and JPEG formats, selecting options such as image quality and 
color palette.
 
 In the Advanced pane, you choose which flavor of the eBook format is 
used. (It’s called EPUB here because eBooks have the filename extension 
.epub.) You also choose whether the InDesign layout’s table of contents 
is exported — because .epub files are typically used for electronic 
books, it’s likely you would export the TOC, as books typically have 
TOCs.
Click Export when done with your settings.

pane of

Exporting to the Web
InDesign lets you export your layouts to the XHTML format that Web editors 
such as Adobe’s Dreamweaver can open for further work. (Note that you’ll 
usually want to do further work in a Web editor both to take advantage of 
Web-specific formatting options and to rework the layout to better fit the 
horizontal “page” size of a Web browser.)
To export a layout to XHTML format, simply choose File➪Export for 
Dreamweaver. (And despite the name, your files aren’t limited to use by 
Adobe’s Dreamweaver software; any Web editor should be able to open the 
files.) If you want to export just specific items on a page, select them with one 
of the selection tools before choosing this menu option.

384
Part VII: Printing and Multimedia Essentials 
You get the Save As dialog box, where you choose the disk and folder to 
store the exported Web page, as well as the page’s filename. After you click 
Save, you get the XHTML Export Options dialog box, shown in Figure 24-11, 
in which you specify how InDesign converts the layout to the Web format. 
Unless you’re Web-savvy, ask your Web master what settings to use:
 
 In the General pane, you choose whether to export the currently 
selected objects or the entire document, as well as how to handle bul-
leted and numbered lists. The default mappings — Map to Unordered 
Lists for bullets and Map to Ordered Lists for numbers — work for most 
sites. But you can also have InDesign convert either or both such lists 
into plain text rather than using the Web’s list functions.
 
 In the Images pane, you choose how your images are converted to the 
Web’s GIF and JPEG formats, selecting options such as image quality and 
color palette.
 
Figure 24-11: 
The Images 
pane of 
the XHTML 
Export 
Options 
dialog box.
 
 
 In the Advanced pane, you set how text formatting is converted to the 
Web’s version of styles, called cascading style sheets, or CSS. It’s prefer-
able to choose External CSS as the export option, because that choice 
has the Web pages use a single style file that all Web pages can refer 
to, ensuring consistency (much like InDesign’s styles offer). Note that 
InDesign doesn’t create a CSS file for you; you or your Web designer 
must create it in a Web-editing program. Also in this pane, you can spec-
ify an external JavaScript file to link to — again, something your Web 
designer or programmer will have created separately.
Click Export when done with your settings.
The export process is simple, so it’s easy to forget that converting print lay-
outs to the Web’s format is rarely a “point-and-shoot” activity. Expect your 
Web designer to do major work on those exported pages in his Web editing 
program, to optimize them for the Web environment. That’s no reflection on 
you or InDesign — just the reality of working in different media.

Chapter 25
Top Ten New Features in 
InDesign CS4
In This Chapter
 Taking a look at finishing touches
 Getting the scoop on fancy features
A
dmit it — you came here before looking at the rest of the book. I can’t 
blame you — everyone loves to know what’s new. Well, InDesign CS4 
has some really cool new stuff. Much of it falls into the category of nice little 
touches that make something that much easier to use.
But InDesign also added a bunch of “Hey, let’s see what the users can do with 
this” kind of new thing just to keep everyone’s brain sharp. You’ll have your 
favorite new features, of course, but because I’m writing the book, I get to tell 
you mine!
Smart Guides, Spacing, and Dimensions
Smart guides, spacing, and dimensions — three related features — are hands-
down the best addition to InDesign in this version. As Chapter 10 explains, 
these features give you visual feedback as you work with objects — create, 
resize, move, and rotate them — so that they snap to the locations, sizes, 
rotations, and so on of nearby objects. The theory is that most objects are 
related to the nearby ones, so it makes sense for, say, a new frame’s left 
side to align to the frame nearest it if your mouse gets close to that existing 
frame’s horizontal coordinate.
InDesign has always allowed precise positioning with the Transform panel 
and later the Control panel — which you still have — but the truth is that 
most layout artists are mouse-based, and those controls had no effect on 
mouse-driven design work. Now InDesign has solved that issue.

388
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
Cross-References
Programs from more than a decade ago — including Adobe’s own 
FrameMaker technical publishing tool — let you add cross-references in 
your documents to text on other pages, so the page numbers and even head-
lines references were updated automatically in all the places referring to 
them. Now InDesign finally lets you do the same thing, using new controls in 
the Hyperlinks panel to provide cross-referencing capabilities. Chapter 24 
explains how this tool works.
Flash Export
Sure, Adobe has a vested interest in promoting its Flash Professional anima-
tion tool for the Web, but the truth is that lines separating print, the Web, 
and computer-based documents are blurring away. It makes sense for a 
layout tool to support all three types of presentation approaches, so the 
ability to export InDesign files to Flash format is very welcome.
The Flash export capability gives you a new venue to use existing InDesign 
capabilities, including hyperlinks, rollovers, embedded audio, embedded 
video, and the new page transitions. Chapter 24 explains the new Flash 
export feature.
Nested Lines
I’ve been whining for this feature ever since Adobe introduced the nested 
styles feature in the CS version. (See — they do listen!) Nested styles are a 
great way to apply formatting based on regular patterns, such as making the 
first sentence always bold or the text through an em space use a specific 
character style (such as for lists).
But many designers like to make the first line or two of a paragraph — typi-
cally at the beginning of a story or section — all small caps or have a char-
acter style applied. Nested styles can’t do that, as they didn’t know how to 
count lines. As Chapter 13 explains, InDesign now knows how to count lines 
so that you can apply a desired style to however many lines in arrow that 
you want.

389
 Chapter 25: Top Ten New Features in InDesign CS4
Dynamic Autoflow
Although InDesign already had an option to add pages as needed to your 
layout as you placed text files, the CS4 version makes the process easier and 
gives you more control over such autoflow, as Chapter 11 explains.
Pointer Information
This feature is one of those subtle improvements that you wonder how no 
one thought of it before. You can now have InDesign display near your mouse 
pointer the current coordinates, so when you’re drawing, rotating, or resizing 
something, you can see exactly where the mouse is, what size the object is, 
and what the new rotation is.
You’re focused on that mouse pointer while you’re working, so it makes per-
fect sense to display that key information — what InDesign calls transformation 
values — where your attention is. Chapter 8 shows what I mean.
Spread Rotation
Spread rotation also falls in the “Why didn’t they think of it before?” depart-
ment. When you use rotated text, it’s hard to edit! After all, you can’t turn 
your head at those angles (at least I can’t!). So now InDesign lets you rotate 
specific spreads so that you can work with the text straight on. Of course, 
these rotated spreads are just for viewing; they print the normal way, as 
Chapter 8 explains.
Conditional Text
Some people work on documents, such as catalogs and price sheets, that 
have multiple versions with regional or other minor differences, requiring 
several versions of the document with just slight differences. Imagine a price 
sheet that has prices in euros, U.S. dollars, yen, Canadian dollars, and British 
pounds — except for the prices, everything’s the same, yet you need to make 
them into separate documents and then update any description changes 
across them all. That’s a management fiasco waiting to happen.
InDesign CS4’s conditional text feature solves that, letting you have one docu-
ment with all the variants in it. You then have the ability to toggle among 
each of the variants. Chapter 21 explains how to use this new feature.

390
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
Automatic Preflighting
Preflighting is something we all should do, but often don’t: Review the layout 
for the little gotchas that can ruin the printed version. One example is not 
noticing that a photo is RGB so that when it prints in CMYK on a high-end 
printer, its colors are off. Another example is a low-res preview file that you 
forgot to replace before printing with the high-res version. Or a TrueType 
font that you used by accident on an imagesetter that supports only 
PostScript fonts. You get the idea.
Now, InDesign is always checking your document as you work on it, display-
ing the number of current errors at the bottom of the document window. 
(Boy, is that scary to watch!) This double-check means that you can see that 
you have issues early enough to fix them, before a crisis ensues.
Even better, InDesign lets you create your own preflight profiles so that you 
can define exactly what issues to be on the hunt for. Chapter 23 explains how 
preflighting works.
PDF Page Rotations
Okay, this feature is an eye-candy pick; most documents will never use it. But 
if you’re creating PDF or Flash files from your InDesign document, you can 
now set page transitions — those animated wipes, fades, and corner peels 
common to PowerPoint presentations — so as someone moves from one 
page to another in a PDF or Flash file, they get those same transition effects. 
Dorky but cool. Chapter 24 explains how to apply them.

Top Ten Resources for 
InDesign Users
In This Chapter
 Discovering useful Web sites
 Using Adobe Web resources
 Finding books to read
W
hen you’re ready to expand your horizons beyond what I can squeeze 
into the pages of this book, check out this chapter. No matter what 
type of information you’re looking for, you can find it here among this handy 
list of InDesign resources.
Web Sites
Web sites are a great ongoing resource because they let you keep up with 
news, techniques, and product versions. Here are four sites that belong in 
your bookmarks.
InDesignCentral
www.indesigncentral.com
To help you keep up with the dynamic field of publishing, I’ve created an 
independent Web site that helps InDesign users stay current on tools and 
techniques. InDesignCentral provides the following resources:
 
 Tools: Links to plug-ins, scripts, utilities, and Adobe downloads.
 
 Tips: My favorite tips, as well as reader tips.
 
 Resources: Print publishing links, Web publishing links, Mac OS X links, 
and Windows links.

392
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
 
 Adobe InDesign Bible series and QuarkXPress to InDesign: Face to 
Face: Excerpts from the books, including updates from after the books’ 
releases and color versions of the screen images from the chapters that 
cover color.
The Adobe Web site
www.adobe.com
The friendly people at Adobe, who gave the world InDesign, recognize the 
value in providing useful information for users of their software solutions. 
The Adobe Web site offers InDesign tips and tricks, guides, interactive tutori-
als, and lists of user groups. It’s worth your while to visit the site now and 
then to see what’s new. Be sure to check out the InDesign community area 
for pro tips and help from users just like you.
InDesign User Group
www.indesignusergroup.com
Seeking to help InDesign users share skills and tips, Adobe is supporting 
local user groups in many cities. Here’s your chance to extend your InDesign 
knowledge and enlarge your personal network of graphics and layout 
experts.
You can also find links to several how-to guides from Adobe.
Creativepro
www.creativepro.com
Looking for the latest product and industry news? Go to Creativepro.com, an 
online magazine that also functions as a resource and reviews center.
Magazine Resources
The Web has revolutionized content delivery, but a good old-fashioned maga-
zine is hard to beat for the richness of its information and the ability to take 
advantage of its knowledge almost anywhere you happen to be.

393
 Chapter 26: Top Ten Resources for InDesign Users
InDesign Magazine
www.indesignmag.com
This PDF-delivered bimonthly magazine takes the expertise of a whole bunch 
of InDesign power users and puts it into one place, giving you a regular flow 
of great ideas, tips, and tricks. While it’s not as convenient as a print maga-
zine, the PDF format does have the advantage of being easy to store and keep 
with you wherever your computer happens to be. Plus, you can always print 
an article and take it with you if you want.
Layers magazine
www.layersmagazine.com
A great resource for tips and tricks specific to the Adobe universe of prod-
ucts is Layers magazine, which produces six glossy issues each year, chock-
full of tips and how-to advice.
Macworld magazine
www.macworld.com
Macworld magazine remains a spectacular resource for publishers of all skill 
levels, providing graphics guidance as well as general news and advice about 
the Mac platform that most designers use.
Recommended Books
Wiley Publishing, Inc., the publisher of this book, also offers a wide range 
of books to help layout artists and publication designers exploit publishing 
tools to the fullest. The following four books — the first two I wrote — can 
help you expand your InDesign knowledge and related areas of expertise:
 
 My Adobe InDesign CS4 Bible gives you extensive insight and tips on 
using the newest versions of InDesign in professional publishing 
environments.
 
 My QuarkXPress to InDesign: Face to Face shows you how to make the 
move from QuarkXPress to InDesign. You’ll be running at full speed in 
no time, leveraging your knowledge of QuarkXPress and translating it 
into InDesign’s approach. Although this book was written using the CS2 
version, its techniques apply to the CS4 edition as well.

394
Part VIII: The Part of Tens 
 
 Adobe Creative Suite 4 Bible, by Ted Padova, Kelly L. Murdock, and 
Wendy Halderman, provides an all-in-one resource for users of Adobe’s 
cornerstone tools (Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat Professional, and 
InDesign).
 
 Digital Photography: Top 100 Simplified Tips & Tricks, by Gregory 
Georges, provides clear, illustrated instructions for 100 tasks that reveal 
cool secrets, teach timesaving tricks, and explain great tips to make 
you a better digital photographer. To help you understand the implica-
tions of digital photography on the production process, Total Digital 
Photography: The Shoot to Print Workflow Handbook, by Serge Timacheff 
and David Karlins, offers complete, end-to-end workflow advice from 
shoot to print in a full-color presentation.
