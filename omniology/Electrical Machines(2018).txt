Electrical Machines
Electrical machines convert energy existing in one form to another, usable, form. These machines 
can broadly be divided into three categories: generators, motors and transformers. Generators convert 
mechanical energy into electrical energy, motors convert electrical energy to mechanical energy, 
and transformers change the voltage level in ac system and are considered to be the backbone of a 
power system.
Electrical machines play an important role in domestic appliances, commercial devices and 
industrial applications. It is important for students of electrical and electronics engineering to learn 
the basic concepts of transformers, motors, generators and magnetic circuits. This book explains 
the design of transformers, decoding of generators and performance of electrical motors through 
descriptive illustrations, solved examples and mathematical derivations. Construction, working 
principles and applications of various electrical machines are discussed in detail. In addition, it offers 
an engrossing discussion on special purpose machines, which is useful from an industrial prospective 
in building customised machines. The text contains hundreds of worked examples and illustrations 
and more than a thousand self-assessment exercises. It is an ideal textbook for undergraduate students 
of electrical and electronics engineering.

Preface
This book on ‘Electrical Machines’ has been written for under-graduate students of Electrical 
Engineering (EE) and Electrical & Electronics Engineering (EEE) belonging to various Indian and 
Foreign Universities. It will also be useful to candidates appearing for AMIE, IETE, GATE, UPSC 
Engineering Services and Civil Services Entrance Examinations. 
We know that electrical energy has a wide range of applications where electrical machines play 
a vital role in industrial production and many other areas of science and technology. Accordingly, 
this book has been designed so that it be useful not only to students pursuing courses in electrical 
engineering but also for practising engineers and technicians.
‘Electrical Machines’ is taught at various universities under different titles such as Electrical 
Machines-I, Electrical Machines-II, DC Machines and Transformers, Electromagnetic Energy 
Conversion Devices, Special Purpose Machines, etc. All the topics in such courses have been covered 
in this single unit. As such, the book covers the revised syllabi of all Indian and Foreign Universities.
Generally, students find Electrical Machines to be one of the most difficult subjects to understand, 
despite the availability of a large number of text books in this field. Keeping this fact in mind, this 
text has been developed in a systematic manner giving more emphasis on basic concepts.
Each chapter of the book contains much needed text, supported by neat and self-explanatory 
diagrams to make the subject self-speaking to a great extent. A large number of solved and unsolved 
examples have been added in various chapters to enable students to attempt different types of questions 
in examination without any difficulty. Section Practice Problems have been added in all the chapters 
to maintain regular study and understanding. At the end of each chapter sufficient objective type 
questions, short-answer questions, test questions and unsolved examples have been added to make 
the book a complete and comprehensive unit in all respects.
The author lays no claim to original research in preparing the text. Materials available in the 
research work of eminent authors have been used liberally. But the author claims that he has organised 
the subject matter in very systematic manner. He also claims that the language of the text is lucid, 
direct and easy to understand.
Although every care has been taken to eliminate errors, however it is very difficult to claim 
perfection. I hope this book will be useful to its users (students, teachers and professionals). I shall be 
very grateful to the readers (students and teachers) and users of this book if they point out any mistake 
that might have crept in. Suggestions for the improvement of the book will be highly appreciated.

Introduction
It is always advantageous to utilise electrical energy since it is cheaper, can be easily transmitted, 
easy to control and more efficient. The electrical energy is generally generated from natural resources 
such as water, coal, diesel, wind, atomic energy, etc. From these sources, first mechanical energy is 
produced by one way or the other and then that mechanical energy is converted into electrical energy 
by suitable machines. For the utilisation of electrical energy, it is again converted into other forms 
of energy such as mechanical, heat, light etc. It is a well-known fact that the electric drives have 
been universally adopted by the industry due to their inherent advantages. The energy conversion 
devices are always required at both ends of a typical electrical system. The devices or machines 
which convert mechanical energy into electrical energy and vice-versa are called electro–mechanical 
energy conversion devices.
CHAPTER

Electrical Machines
The operation of all the electrical machines such as DC machines, transformers, synchronous 
machines, induction motors, etc., rely upon their magnetic circuits. The closed path followed by the 
magnetic lines of force is called a magnetic circuit. The operation of all the electrical devices (e.g.,
transformers, generators, motors, etc.) depends upon the magnetism produced by their magnetic 
circuits. Therefore, to obtain the required characteristics of these devices, their magnetic circuits 
have to be designed carefully.
In this chapter, we shall focus our attention on the basic fundamentals of magnetic circuits and 
their applications as electromechanical energy conversion devices.
1.1 Magnetic Field and its Significance
The region around a magnet where its poles exhibit a force of attraction or repulsion is called 
magnetic field.
The existence of the magnetic field at a point around the magnet can also be determined by placing 
a magnetic needle at that point as shown in Fig. 1.1. Although magnetic lines of force have no real 
existence and are purely imaginary, yet their concept is very useful to understand various magnetic 
effects. It is assumed (because of their effects) that the magnetic lines of force possess the following 
important properties:
(i) The direction of magnetic lines of force is from N-pole to the S-pole outside the magnet. But 
inside the magnet their direction is from S-pole to N-pole.
(ii) They form a closed loop.
(iii) Their tendency is to follow the least reluctance path.
(iv) They act like stretched cords, always trying to shorten themselves.
(v) They never intersect each other.
(vi) They repel each other when they are parallel and are in the same direction.
(vii) They remain unaffected by non-magnetic materials.

1.2 Magnetic Circuit and its Analysis
The closed path followed by magnetic flux is called a magnetic circuit.
A magnetic circuit usually consists of magnetic materials having high permeability (e.g., iron, 
soft steel, etc.). In this circuit, magnetic flux starts from a point and finishes at the same point after 
completing its path.
Figure 1.2 shows a solenoid having N turns wound on an iron 
core (ring). When current I ampere is passed through the solenoid, 
magnetic flux I Wb is set-up in the core.
Let l = mean length of magnetic circuit in m;
a = area of cross-section of core in m2;
µr = relative permeability of core material.
Flux density in the core material, B = f

According to work law, the work done in moving a unit pole once round the magnetic circuit (or 
path) is equal to the ampere-turns enclosed by the magnetic circuit.

The above expression reveals that the amount of flux set-up in the core is
(i) directly proportional to N and I i.e., NI, called magnetomotive force (mmf). It shows that the 
flux increases if either of the two increases and vice-versa.
(ii) inversely proportional to l/a µ0 µr called reluctance of the magnetic path. In fact, reluctance is 
the opposition offered to the magnetic flux by the magnetic path. The lower is the reluctance, 
the higher will be the flux and vice-versa.
Thus, 
Flux = 
m.m.f
reluctance
It may be noted that the above expression has a strong resemblance to Ohm’s law for electric 
current (I = emf/resistance). The mmf is analogous to emf in electric circuit, reluctance is analogous 
to resistance and flux is analogous to current. Because of this similarity, the above expression is 
sometimes referred to as Ohm’s law of magnetic circuits.
1.3 Important Terms
While studying magnetic circuits, generally, we come across the following terms:
1. Magnetic field: The region around a magnet where its poles exhibit a force of attraction or 
repulsion is called magnetic field.
Fig. 1.2 Magnetic circuit

Electrical Machines
2. Magnetic flux (I): The amount of magnetic lines of force set-up in a magnetic circuit is called 
magnetic flux. Its unit is weber (Wb). It is analogous to electric current I in electric circuit.
3. The magnetic flux density at a point is the flux per unit area at right angles to the flux at that 
point.
It is, generally, represented by letter ‘B’. Its unit is Wb/m2 or Tesla, i.e.,
B = f
A Wb
m
/
2
or T (1 Wb/m2 = 1 × 104 Wb/cm2)
4. Permeability: The ability of a material to conduct magnetic lines of force through it is called 
the permeability of that material.
It is generally represented by µ (mu, a Greek letter). The greater the permeability of a material, 
the greater is its conductivity for the magnetic lines of force and vice-versa. The permeability 
of air or vacuum is the poorest and is represented as µ0 (where µ0 = 4S × 10–7 H/m).
Relative permeability: The absolute (or actual) permeability µ of a magnetic material is much 
greater than absolute permeability of air µ0. The relative permeability of a magnetic material 
is given in comparison with air or vacuum.
Hence, the ratio of the permeability of material µ to the permeability of air or vacuum µ0 is 
called the relative permeability µr of the material.
i.e., 
µr = m
m0
or µ = µ0 µr
Obviously, the relative permeability of air would be µ0/µ0 = 1. The value of relative permeability 
of all the non-magnetic materials is also 1. However, its value is as high as 8000 for soft iron, 
whereas, its value for mumetal (iron 22% and nickel 78%) is as high as 1,20,000.
5. Magnetic field intensity: The force acting on a unit north pole (1 Wb) when placed at a point 
in the magnetic field is called the magnetic intensity of the field at that point. It is denoted by H.
In magnetic circuits, it is defined as mmf per unit length of the magnetic path. It is denoted by 
H, mathematically,
H = 
m.m.f
length of magnetic path
AT
m

6. Magnetomotive force (mmf): The magnetic pressure which sets-up or tends to set-up magnetic 
flux in a magnetic circuit is called magnetomotive force. As per work law it may be defined as 
under:
The work done in moving a unit magnetic pole (1 Wb) once round the magnetic circuit is called 
magnetomotive force. In general
mmf = NI ampere-turns (or AT)
It is analogous to emf in an electric circuit.
7. Reluctance (S): The opposition offered to the magnetic flux by a magnetic circuit is called its 
reluctance.
It depends upon length (l), area of cross-section (a) and permeability (µ = µ0 µr) of the material 
that makes up the magnetic circuit. It is measured in AT/Wb.

It is analogous to resistance in an electric circuit.
8. Permeance: It is a measure of the ease with which flux can be set-up in the material. It is just 
reciprocal of reluctance of the material and is measured in Wb/AT or henry.

in all respects. A comparison of the two circuits is given below:

Dissimilarities
1. In fact, the magnetic flux does not flow but it sets-
up in the magnetic circuit (basically molecular 
poles are aligned).
2. For magnetic flux, there is no perfect insulator. It 
can be set-up even in the non-magnetic materials 
like air, rubber, glass etc. with reasonable mmf
3. The reluctance (S) of a magnetic circuit is not 
constant rather it varies with the value of B. It 
is because the value of µr changes considerably 
with the change in B.
4. Once the magnetic flux is set-up in a magnetic 
circuit, no energy is expanded. However, a small 
amount of energy is required at the start to create 
flux in the circuit.
1. The electric current (electrons) actually flows in 
an electric circuit.
2. For electric current, there are large number of 
perfect insulators like glass, air, rubber, etc., 
which do not allow it to follow through them under 
normal conditions.
3. The resistance (R) of an electric circuit is almost 
constant as its value depends upon the value of 
U which is almost constant. However, the value of 
U and R may vary slightly if temperature changes.
4. Energy is expanded continuously, so long as the 
current flows through an electric circuit. This 
energy is dissipated in the form of heat.

same magnetic field is called a series magnetic circuit. Such as series magnetic circuit (composite 
circuit) is shown in Fig. 1.5.

1.7 Parallel Magnetic Circuits
A magnetic circuit which has two or more than two paths for the magnetic flux is called a parallel 
magnetic circuit. Its behaviour can be just compared to a parallel electric circuit.
Figure 1.6 shows a parallel magnetic circuit. A current carrying coil is wound on the central limb 
AB. This coil sets-up a magnetic flux I1 in the central limb which is further divided into two paths 
i.e., (i) path ADCB which carries flux I2 and (ii) path AFEB which carries flux I3.
Fig. 1.6 Parallel magnetic circuit
It is clear that I1 = I2 + I3
The two magnetic paths ADCB and AFEB are in parallel. The ATs required for this parallel circuit 
is equal to the ATs required for any one of the paths.
If S1 = reluctance of path BA i.e., l1/a1 µ0 µr1
S2 = reluctance of path ADCB i.e., l2/a2 µ0 µr2
S3 = reluctance of path AFEB i.e., l3/a3 µ0 µr3
? Total mmf required = mmf required for path BA + mmf required path ADCB or path AFEB.
i.e., Total mmf or AT = I1 S1 + I2 S2 = I1 S1 + I3 S3

1.8 Leakage Flux
The magnetic flux which does not follow the intended path 
in a magnetic circuit is called leakage flux.
When some current is passed through a solenoid, as 
shown in Fig. 1.7, magnetic flux is produced by it. Most of 
this flux is set-up in the magnetic core and passes through 
the air gap (an intended path). This flux is known as useful 
flux Iu. However, some of the flux is just set-up around the 
coil and is not utilised for any work. This flux is called 
leakage flux Il.
Total flux produced by the solenoid.
I = Iu + Il
Leakage co-efficient or leakage factor: The ratio of 
total flux (I) produced by the solenoid to the useful flux 
(Iu) set-up in the air gap is known as leakage co-efficient. 
It is generally represented by letter ‘O’.
?
Leakage co-efficient, O = f
fu
Fringing: It may be seen in Fig. 1.7 that the useful flux when sets-up in the air gap, it tends to 
bulge outwards at b and bc since the magnetic lines set-up in the same direction repel each other. 
This increases the effective area in the air gap and decreases the flux density. This effect is known 
as fringing. The fringing is directly proportional to the length of the air gap.
Example 1.1
An iron ring of 400 cm mean circumference is made from round iron of cross-section 20 cm2. Its 
permeability is 500. If it is wound with 400 turns, what current would be required to produce a flux 
of 0·001 Wb?
Solution:
The magnetic circuit is shown in Fig. 1.8.
Mean length of magnetic path, lm = 400 cm = 4 m

Determine magnetomotive force, magnetic flux, reluctance and flux density in case of a steel ring 
30 cm mean diameter and a circular cross-section 2 cm in diameter has an air gap 1 mm long. It 
is wound uniformly with 600 turns of wire carrying a current of 2.5 A. Neglect magnetic leakage. 
The iron path takes 40% of the total magnetomotive force.
Solution:
Mmf of the magnetic circuit = NI = 600 × 2·5 = 1500 ATs (Ans.)
As iron path takes 40% of the total mmf, the reluctance of iron in 40% and the rest of the reluctance 
(60%) is of air path.

1.9 Magnetisation or B-H Curve
The graph plotted between flux density B and magnetising force H of a material is called the 
magnetisation or B–H Curve of that material.
The general shape of the B–H Curve of a magnetic material is shown in Fig. 1.20. The shape 
of the curve is non-linear This indicates that the relative permeability (µr = B/µ0 H) of a magnetic 
material is not constant but it varies. The value of µr largely depends upon the value of flux density. 
Its shape is shown in Fig. 1.21 (for cast steel).
Fig. 1.20 B-H curve of a magnetic material
Fig. 1.21 µr-B curve
The B–H curves of some of the common magnetic materials are shown in Fig. 1.22. The B–H
curve for a non-magnetic material is shown in Fig. 1.23. It is a straight line curve since B = P0 H
or B v H as the value of P0 is constant.

Electrical Machines

1.10 Magnetic Hysteresis
When a magnetic material is magnetised first in one direction and then in the other (i.e., one cycle 
of magnetisation), it is found that flux density B in the material lags behind the applied magnetising 
force H. This phenomenon is known as magnetic hysteresis.
Hence, the phenomenon of flux density B lagging behind the magnetising force H in a magnetic 
material is called magnetic hysteresis.
‘Hysteresis’ is the term derived from the Greek word hysterein meaning to lag behind. To 
understand the complete phenomenon of magnetic hysteresis, consider a ring of magnetic material 
on which a solenoid is wound uniformly as shown in Fig. 1.24. The solenoid in connected to a DC 
source through a double pole double throw reversible switch (position ‘1’).
Fig. 1.24 Circuit to trace hysteresis loop 
Fig. 1.25
Hysteresis loop

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
23
When the field intensity H is increased gradually by increasing current in the solenoid (by 
decreasing the value of R), the flux density B also increases until saturation point a is reached and 
curve so obtained is oa. If now the magnetising force is gradually reduced to zero by decreasing 
current in the solenoid to zero. The flux density does not become zero and the curve so obtained 
is ab as shown in Fig. 1.25. When magnetising force H is zero, the flux density still has value ob.
Residual Magnetism and Retentivity
This value of flux density ‘ob’ retained by the magnetic material is called residual magnetism and 
the power of retaining this residual magnetism is called retentivity of the material.
To demagnetise the magnetic ring, the magnetising force H is reversed by reversing the direction 
of flow of current in the solenoid. This is achieved by changing the position of double pole, double 
throw switch (i.e., position ‘2’). When H is increased in reverse direction, the flux density starts 
decreasing and becomes zero and curve follows the path bc. Thus residual magnetism of the magnetic 
material is wiped off by applying magnetising force oc in opposite direction.
Coercive Force
This value of magnetising force oc required to wipe off the residual magnetism is called coercive force.
To complete the loop, the magnetising force H is increased further in reverse direction till 
saturation reaches (point ‘d’) and the curve follows the path cd. Again H is reduced to zero and the 
curve follows the path de. Where oe represents the residual magnetism. Then H is increased in the 
positive direction by changing the position of reversible switch to position ‘1’ and increasing the flow 
of current in the solenoid. The curve follows the path of efa and the loop is completed. Again of is 
the magnetising force utilised to wipe off the residual magnetism oe.
Hence, cf is the total coercive force required in one cycle of magnetisation to wipe off the residual 
magnetism.
Since the meaning of hysteresis is lagging behind, and in this case flux density B always lags 
behind the magnetising force, H, therefore, loop (abcdefa) so obtained is called hysteresis loop.
1.11 Hysteresis Loss
When a magnetising force is applied, the magnetic material is magnetised and the molecular magnets 
are lined up in a particular direction.
However, when the magnetising force in a magnetic material is reversed, the internal friction 
of the molecular magnets opposes the reversal of magnetism, resulting in hysteresis. To overcome 
this internal friction of the molecular magnets (or to wipe off the residual magnetism), a part of the 
magnetising force is used. The work done by the magnetising force against this internal friction of 
molecular magnets produces heat. This energy, which is wasted in the form of heat due to hysteresis, 
is called hysteresis loss.
Hysteresis loss occurs in all the magnetic parts of electrical machines where there is reversal of 
magnetisation. This loss results in wastage of energy in the form of heat. Consequently, it increases 

24
Electrical Machines
the temperature of the machine which is undesirable. Therefore, a suitable magnetic material is 
selected for the construction of such parts, e.g., silicon steel is most suitable in which hysteresis loss 
is minimum.
1.12 Importance of Hysteresis Loop
The shape and size of hysteresis loop of a magnetic material largely depends upon its nature. For a 
particular location, the choice of the magnetic material depends upon the shape and size (i.e., area) 
of its hysteresis loop. The hysteresis loops of some of the common magnetic materials are shown 
in Fig. 1.26.
(i) Hard steel: The hysteresis loop for hard steel is shown in Fig. 1.26 (a). This loop has larger area 
which indicates that this material will have more hysteresis loss. Therefore, it is never used for 
the construction of machine parts. However, its loop shows that the material has high retentivity 
and coercivity. Therefore, it is more suitable for making permanent magnets.
Fig. 1.26 Hysteresis loop for different magnetic materials
(ii) Silicon steel: The hysteresis loop for silicon steel is shown in Fig. 1.26 (b). This loop has smallest 
area which indicates that this material will have small hysteresis loss. Therefore, it is most suitable 
for the construction of those parts of electrical machines in which reversal of magnetisation is 
very quick e.g., armature of DC machines, transformer core, starter of induction motors etc.
(iii) Wrought iron: Figure 1.26 (c) shows the hysteresis loop for wrought iron. This loop shows that 
this material has fairly good residual magnetism and coercivity. Therefore, it is best suited for 
making cores of electromagnets.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What is a magnet? 
Ans. A substance that attracts pieces of iron is called a magnet.
Q.2. What are permanent and temporary magnets? 
Ans. A magnet that retains magnetism permanently is called a permanent magnet. Whereas a magnet in 
which magnetism remains temporarily is called a temporary magnet. A wire wound soft iron piece 
becomes a temporary magnet when a DC is passed through the wire.
Q.3. What are magnetic poles?
Ans. The ends of a magnet from where the magnetic lines of force appear to emit or enter are called magnetic 
poles, these are identified as north and south poles respectively.
Q.4. What do you understand by magnetic field? 
Ans. The space occupied by the magnetic lines of force around a magnet is called the magnetic field.
Q.5. What do you mean by magnetic axis?
Ans. Magnetic axis is the imaginary line joining the two poles of a magnet. It is also called as the magnetic 
equator.

Q.6. Define and explain a magnetic circuit.
Ans. A complete closed path followed by a group of magnetic lines force is called a magnetic circuit. In a 
magnetic circuit, the magnetic flux leaves from north pole, passes through the circuit and returns to 
the north pole.
Q.7. Mention at least four properties of magnetic lines of force. 
Ans. 1. Magnetic lines always emanate from north pole and terminate at south pole outside the magnet 
whereas they are set-up from south to north pole inside the magnet.
2. The magnetic lines of force do not intersect each other.
3. The magnetic lines of force set-up in one direction have a repulsive force between them and therefore 
do not intersect.
4. The magnetic lines of force always follow the least reluctance path. 
Q.8. Explain the term MMF.
Ans. The force which drives the magnetic flux through a magnetic circuit is called the magnetomotive force. 
It is produced by passing electric current through wire of number of turns. It is measured in ampere-
turns (AT ).
MMF in a magnetic circuit can be compared to EMF in an electric circuit. Both are pressure. MMF is 
magnetic pressure and EMF is electric pressure. 
Q.9. Define relative permeability.
Ans. The relative permeability (µr) of a material (or medium) is defined as the ratio of the flux density 
produced in that material or medium to the flux density produced in vacuum by the same magnetising 
force.
µr = B
B0
where, B – Flux density in the material or medium in tesla
B0 – Flux density in vacuum
Q.10. Define permeance of magnetic circuit.
Ans. Permeance is the reciprocal of reluctance. It is the ease of the magnetic material with which magnetic 
flux is set-up in it. It is equivalent to conductance in an electric circuit. Its unit is weber per ampere-
turn.

Q.12. What is a composite magnetic circuit?
Ans. A composite magnetic circuit consists of different magnetic materials. The magnetic materials have 
different permeabilities and length it may also have an air gap. Each path will have its own reluctance. 
Since the materials are in series, the total reluctance is given by the sum of individual reluctances.
Q.13. State ‘Ohms law’ of a magnetic circuit.
Ans. The ‘ohms law’ of a magnetic circuit is given by 
Flux = 
MMF
Reluctance i.e., I = NI
S
The above equation is similar to that of the ohm’s law in electric circuit. Flux is analogous to current, 
MMF to EMF and reluctance to resistance in electric circuit.
Q.14. Define leakage factor.
Ans. Leakage factor is defined as the ratio of total flux to the useful flux.
Q.15. Why is it necessary to keep air gaps in magnetic circuits as small as possible?
Ans. Usually, the ampere-turns (AT) required for the airgap is much greater than that required for the magnetic 
circuit. It is because the reluctance of air is very high as compared to that offered by iron. Therefore, 
it is always preferred to keep air gaps in magnetic circuits as small as possible.
Q.16. Why does leakage occur in a magnetic circuit?
Ans. In a parallel magnetic circuit, a large amount of flux follows the intended path. At the same time a small 
amount of flux leaks through the surrounding air since air is not a magnetic insulator. Therefore, leakage 
of flux takes place easily. The leakage flux is useless, it is harmful in an electrical machine.

Electrical Machines
Q.17. What is magnetic fringing? 
Ans. While crossing an air gap the magnetic lines of force tend to bulge out. The reason is that the magnetic 
lines of force repel each other when passing through non-magnetic material. This phenomenon is known 
as fringing.
Q.18. What is hysteresis in a magnetic material?
Ans. The phenomenon due to which magnetic flux density (B) lags behind the magnetic field intensity (H) 
in a magnetic material is called magnetic hysteresis.

1.13 Electro Magnetic Induction
The phenomenon by which an emf is induced in a circuit (and hence current flows when the circuit 
is closed) when magnetic flux linking with it changes is called electro-magnetic induction.
Fig. 1.28 Electromagnetic induction
For illustration, consider a coil having a large number of turns to which galvanometer is connected. 
When a permanent bar magnet is taken nearer to the coil or away from the coil, as shown in Fig. 1.28 
(a), a deflection occurs in the needle of the galvanometer. Although, the deflection in the needle is 
opposite is two cases.
On the other hand, if the bar magnet is kept stationary and the coil is brought nearer to the magnet 
or away from the magnet, as shown in Fig. 1.28 (b), again a deflection occurs in the needle of the 
galvanometer. The deflection in the needle is opposite in the two cases.
However, if the magnet and the coil both are kept stationary, no matter how much flux is linking 
with the coil, there is no deflection in the galvanometer needle.

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
29
The following points are worth noting:
(i) The deflection in the galvanometer needle shows that emf is induced in the coil. This condition 
occurs only when flux linking with the circuit changes i.e., either magnet or coil is in motion.
(ii) The direction of induced emf in the coil depends upon the direction of magnetic field and the 
direction of motion of coil.
1.14 Faraday’s Laws of Electromagnetic Induction
Michael Faraday summed up conclusions of his experiments regarding electro-magnetic induction 
into two laws, known as Faraday’s laws of electro-magnetic induction.
First Law: This law states that “Whenever a conductor cuts across the magnetic field, an emf is 
induced in the conductor.”
or
“Whenever the magnetic flux linking with any circuit (or coil) changes, an emf is induced in the circuit.”
Figure 1.29 shows a conductor placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet to which a 
galvanometer is connected. Whenever, the conductor is moved upward or downward i.e., across the 
field, there is deflection in the galvanometer needle which indicates that an emf is induced in the 
conductor. If the conductor is moved along (parallel) the field, there is no deflection in the needle 
which indicates that no emf is induced in the conductor.
For the second statement, consider a coil placed near a bar magnet and a galvanometer connected 
across the coil, as shown in Fig. 1.30. When the bar magnet (N-pole) is taken nearer to the coil [see 
Fig. 1.30 (a)], there is deflection in the needle of the galvanometer. If now the bar magnet (N-pole) is 
taken away from the coil [see Fig. 1.30 (b)], again there is deflection in the needle of galvanometer 
but in opposite direction. The deflection in the needle of galvanometer indicates that emf is induced 
in the coil.

1.15 Direction of Induced emf
The direction of induced emf and hence current in a conductor or coil can be determined by either 
of the following two methods:
1. Fleming’s Right Hand Rule: This rule is applied to determine the direction of induced emf 
in a conductor moving across the field and is stated as under;
“Stretch, first finger, second finger, and thumb of your right hand mutually perpendicular to 
each other. If first finger indicates the direction of magnetic field, thumb indicates the direction 
of motion of conductor then second finger will indicate the direction of induced emf in the 
conductor.”
Its illustration is shown in Fig. 1.29.
2. Lenz’s Law: This law is more suitably applied to determine the direction of induced emf in a 
coil or circuit when flux linking with it changes. It is stated as under:
“In effect, electro-magnetically induced emf and hence current flows in a coil or circuit in such 
a direction that the magnetic field set up by it, always opposes the very cause which produces it.”
Explanation: When N-pole of a bar magnet is taken nearer to the coil as shown in Fig. 1.30, an emf 
is induced in the coil and hence current flows through it in such a direction that side ‘B’ of the coil 
attains North polarity which opposes the movement of the bar magnet. Whereas, when N-pole of 
the bar magnet is taken away from the coil as shown in Fig. 1.30, the direction of emf induced in the 

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
31
coil is reversed and side ‘B’ of the coil attains South polarity which again opposes the movement 
of the bar magnet.
1.16 Induced emf
When flux linking with a conductor (or coil) changes, an emf is induced in it. This change in flux 
linkages can be obtained in the following two ways:
(i) By either moving the conductor and keeping the magnetic field system stationary or moving 
the magnetic field system and keeping the conductor stationary, in such a way that conductor 
cuts across the magnetic field (as in case of DC and AC generators). The emf induced in this 
way is called dynamically induced emf
(ii) By changing the flux linking with the coil (or conductor) without moving either coil or field 
system. However, the change of flux produced by the field system linking with the coil is obtained 
by changing the current in the field system (solenoid), as in transformers. The emf induced in 
this way is called statically induced emf
1.17 Dynamically Induced emf
By either moving the conductor keeping the magnetic field system stationary or moving the field 
system keeping the conductor stationary so that flux is cut by the conductor, the emf thus induced 
in the conductor is called dynamically induced emf
Mathematical Expression
Considering a conductor of length l metre placed in the magnetic field of flux density B Wb/m2
is moving at right angle to the field at a velocity X metre/second as shown in Fig. 1.31 (a). Let the 
conductor be moved through a small distance dx metre in time dt second as shown in Fig. 1.31 (b).

is dx in time dt second. Then the component of distance perpendicular to the magnetic field, which 
produces emf, is dx sin T.

1.18 Statically Induced emf
When the coil and magnetic field system both are stationary but the magnetic field linking with the 
coil changes (by changing the current producing the field), the emf thus induced in the coil is called 
statically induced emf
The statically induced emf may be:
(i) Self induced emf 
(ii) Mutually induced emf
(i) Self induced emf: The emf induced in a coil due to the 
change of flux produced by it linking with its own turns is 
called self induced emf as shown in Fig. 1.32.
The direction of this induced emf is such that it opposes the 
cause which produces it (Lenz’s law) i.e., change of current 
in the coil.
Since the rate of change of flux linking with the coil depends 
upon the rate of change of current in the coil. Therefore, 
the magnitude of self induced emf is directly proportional 
to the rate of change of current in the coil. Therefore, the 
magnitude of self induced emf is directly proportional to 
the rate of change of current in the coil, i.e.,
e v d I
d t
or e = L d I
d t
where L is a constant of proportionality and is called self inductance or co-efficient of self 
inductance or inductance of the coil.
(ii) Mutually induced emf
The emf induced in a coil due to the change of flux produced by another (neighbouring) coil, 
linking with it is called mutually induced emf as shown in Fig. 1.33.
Fig. 1.33 Flux produced by coil-A linking with coil-B
Since the rate of change of flux linking with coil ‘B’ depends upon the rate of change of current 
in coil ‘A’. Therefore, the magnitude of mutually induced emf is directly proportional to the rate 
of change of current in coil ‘A’, i.e.,

where M is a constant of proportionality and is called mutual inductance or co-efficient of 
mutual inductance.
1.19 Self Inductance
The property of a coil due to which it opposes the change of current flowing through itself is called 
self inductance or inductance of the coil.
This property (i.e., inductance) is attained by a coil due to self-induced emf produced in the coil 
itself by the changing current flowing through it. If the current in the coil is increasing (by the change 
in circuit conditions), the self-induced emf is produced in the coil in such a direction so as to oppose 
the rise of current i.e., the direction of self-induced emf is opposite to that of the applied voltage. On 
the other hand, if the current in the coil is decreasing, the self-induced emf is produced in the coil 
in such direction so as to oppose the fall of current i.e., the direction of self-induced emf is in the 
same direction as that of the applied voltage. In fact, self-inductance does not prevent the change of 
current but it delays the change of current flowing through a coil.
It may be noted that this property of the coil only opposes the changing current (i.e., alternating 
current). However, it does not affect the steady (i.e., direct) current when flows through it. In other 
words, the self-inductance of the coil (by virtue of its geometrical and magnetic properties) will 
exhibit its presence to the alternating current but it will not exhibit its presence to the direct current.

1.20 Mutual Inductance
The property of one coil due to which it opposes the change of current in the other (neighbouring) 
coil is called mutual-inductance between the two coils.
This property (i.e., mutual-inductance) is attained by a coil due to mutually induced emf in the 
coil while current in the neighbouring coil is changing.

1.21 Co-efficient of Coupling
When current flows through one coil, it produces flux (I1). The whole of this flux may not be linking 
with the other coil coupled to it as shown in Fig. 32. It may be reduced, because of leakage flux Il, 
by a fraction k known as co-efficient of coupling.
Thus, the fraction of magnetic flux produced by the current in one coil that links with the other 
is known as co-efficient of coupling (k) between the two coils.
If the flux produced by one coil completely links with the other, then the value of k is one and the 
coils are said to be magnetically tightly coupled. Whereas, if the flux produced by one coil does not 
link at all with the other, then the value of k is zero and the coils are said to be magnetically isolated.

1.22 Inductances in Series and Parallel
Consider two coils magnetically coupled having self-inductance of L1 and L2 respectively, and a 
mutual-inductance of M henry. The two coils, in an electrical circuit, may be connected in different 
ways giving different values of resultant inductance as given below:
Inductances in series: The two coils may be connected in series in the following two ways:
(i) When their fields (or mmfs.) are additive i.e., their fluxes are set-up in the same direction as 
shown in Fig. 1.35 In this case, the inductance of each coil is increased by Mi.e.,
Total inductance, LT = (L1 + M) + (L2 + M) = L1 + L2 + 2 M
(ii) When their fields (or mmfs.) are subtractive i.e., their fluxes are set-up in opposite direction as 
shown in Fig. 1.36. In this case, the inductance of each coil is decreased by M, i.e.,
Total inductance, LT = (L1 – M) + (L2 – M) = L1 + L2 – 2 M
Note: It may be noted that direction of field produced by a coil is denoted by placing a Dot at the side 
at which current enters (or flux enters the core), see Fig. 1.35 and 1.36.

same direction

1.23 Energy Stored in a Magnetic Field
When some electrical energy is supplied to a coil, it is spent in two ways:
(i) A part of it is spent to meet I 2 R loss which is dissipated in the form of heat and cannot be 
recovered.
(ii) The remaining part is used to create magnetic field around the coil and is stored in the magnetic 
field. When this field collapses, the stored energy is released by the coil and is returned to the 
circuit.
The energy stored in the magnetic field is given by the expression:
Energy stored in magnetic field = 1

1.24 AC Excitation in Magnetic Circuits
To magnetise the magnetic circuits of electrical devices such as transformers, AC machines, 
electromagnetic relays, etc., AC supply is used. The magnetisation of magnetic circuits is called 
their excitation.
The magnetic circuits are never excited by DC supply, because in case of DC excitation the steady-
state current is determined by the impressed voltage and resistance of the circuit. The inductance 
of the coil comes into picture only during transient period i.e., when the current is building-up or 
decaying during switching (ON or OFF) instants. The magnetic flux in the magnetic circuit adjusts 
itself in accordance with this steady value of current so that the relationship imposed by magnetisation 
(B-H) curve in satisfied. However, with AC excitation, inductance comes into picture even at steady-
state condition. As a result for most of the magnetic circuits (not for all) the flux is determined by the 
impressed voltage and frequency. Then the magnetisation current adjusts itself in accordance with 
this flux so that the relationship imposed by the magnetisation (B-H) curve is satisfied.
Usually, for economic reasons, the normal working flux density in a magnetic circuit is kept 
beyond the linear portion of the magnetisation curve thus accurate analysis cannot be predicted for 
determining self inductance. However, for all practical purposes the parameters of the magnetic 
circuit are considered to be constant.
The reactive effect of the alternatively flux set-
up by the exciting current can readily be shown 
as per Faraday’s laws i.e.,
e = N d
dt
f
Consider a magnetic core which is excited 
by a coil (winding) having N turns and carrying 
a current of i ampere as shown in Fig. 1.39. A 
magnetic flux I is set-up by the exciting current 
i. Let the magnetic flux Ivaries sinusoidally with 
respect to time t, then its instantaneous value is 
given by the relation;
I = Im sin Zt = Im sin 2π ft

of electrical machines, usually the drop in resistance in only a few percent of applied voltage and 
therefore, neglected for close approximation. Thus, the induced emf E and applied voltage V may be 
considered equal in magnitude.

1.25 Eddy Current Loss
When a magnetic material is subjected to a changing (or alternating) magnetic field, an emf is 
induced in the magnetic material itself according to Faraday’s laws of electro-magnetic induction. 
Since the magnetic material is also a conducting material, these emfs. circulate currents within the 
body of the magnetic material. These circulating currents are known as eddy currents. As these 
currents are not used for doing any useful work, therefore, these currents produce a loss (i2 R loss) 
in the magnetic material called eddy current loss. Like hysteresis loss, this loss also increases the 
temperature of the magnetic material. The hysteresis and eddy current losses in a magnetic material 
are called iron losses or core losses or magnetic losses.
A magnetic core subjected to a changing flux is shown in Fig. 1.41. For simplicity, a sectional 
view of the core is shown. When changing flux links with the core itself, an emf is induced in the 
core which sets-up circulating (eddy) currents (i) in the core as shown in Fig. 1.41 (a). These currents 
produce eddy current loss (i2 R), where i is the value of eddy currents and R is resistance of eddy 
current path. As the core is a continuous iron block of large cross-section, the magnitude of i will be 
very large and hence greater eddy current loss will result.
To reduce the eddy current loss, the obvious method is to reduce magnitude of eddy currents. This 
can be achieved by splitting the solid core into thin sheets (called laminations) in the planes parallel 
to the magnetic field as shown in Fig. 1.41 (b). Each lamination is insulated from the other by a fine 

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
45
layer of insulation (varnish or oxide film). This arrangement reduces the area of each section and 
hence the induced emf It also increases the resistance of eddy currents path since the area through 
which the currents can pass is smaller. This loss can further be reduced by using a magnetic material 
having higher value of resistivity (like silicon steel).
Fig. 1.41 Production of eddy currents
Useful Applications of Eddy Currents
It has been seen that when the affects of eddy currents (production on heat) are not utilised, the 
power or energy consumed by these currents is known as eddy current loss. However, there are the 
places where eddy currents are used to do some useful work e.g., in case of Induction heating. In this 
case, an iron shaft is placed as a core of an inductive coil. When high frequency current is passed 
through the coil, a large amount of heat is produced at the outer most periphery of the shaft by eddy 
currents. The amount of heat reduces considerably when we move towards the centre of the shaft. 
This is because outer periphery of the shaft offers low resistance path to eddy currents. This process 
is used for surface hardening of heavy shafts like axils of automobiles.
Eddy current effects are also used in electrical instrument e.g., providing damping torque in 
permanent magnet moving coil instruments and braking torque in case of induction type energy meters.
Mathematical Expression for Eddy Current Loss
Although it is difficult to determine the eddy current power loss from the current and resistance 
values. However, experiments reveal that the eddy current power loss in a magnetic material can be 
expressed as:
Pe = K B t f
e
m
2 2
2 V watt
where, Ke = co-efficient of eddy current, its value depends upon the nature of magnetic material;
Bm = maximum value of flux density in Wb/m2;
t = thickness of lamination in m;
f = frequency of reversal of magnetic field in Hz;
V = volume of magnetic material in m3.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What do you understand by electromagnetic induction?
Ans. The phenomenon by which an emf is induced in an electric circuit (or conductor) when it cuts across 
the magnetic field or when magnetic field linking with it changes is called electro-magnetic inductions. 
This phenomenon was discovered by Faraday.
Q.2. Define Faraday’s laws of electromagnetic induction.
Ans. I Law: Whenever the flux linking with a coil or circuit changes, an emf is induced in it
II Law: The magnitude of induced emf in a coil is directly proportional to rate of change of flux linkages.
i.e., 
e = – N d
dt
f
where e – Induced emf in volt
N – Number of turns
d
dt
f – rate of change of flux.

Q.3. State Fleming’s Right hand rule as well as Fleming’s Left hand rule. 
Ans. Fleming’s Right hand rule: This law states that if one stretches the thumb, fore finger and middle finger 
of the right hand at right angles to each other in such a way that the thumb points in the direction of 
the motion of the conductor, the fore finger in the direction of the flux (from north to south) then the 
middle finger will indicate the direction of the induced emf in the conductor.
Fleming’s Left Hand Rule: Stretch thumb, fore-finger and middle finger of your left hand at right angles 
to each other such that the fore finger points the direction of magnetic field (from north to south) and the 
middle finger gives the direction of current in the conductor, then the thumb will indicate the direction 
in which the force will act on the conductor.
Q.4. State right hand cork screw rule.
Ans. Hold the cork and place the right handed screw over it, now rotate it in such a way that it advances 
in the direction of flow of current. The direction in which the screw is rotated gives the direction of 
magnetic lines of force around the current carrying conductor.
Q.5. What do you mean by dynamically induced emf?
Ans. Either the magnetic field is stationary and the conductor is moving or the conductor is stationary and 
the flux is moving so that flux is cut by the conductor, an emf is induced in it. The emf induced in this 
way is known as dynamically induced emf. (e.g., emf generated in a DC generator).
Q.6. Define self inductance and give its unit. 
Ans. The property of a coil due to which it opposes the change of current flowing through it is called self 
inductance. It refers to the ability of the coil to induce emf when current through it changes. Its unit is 
Henry.
Q.7. Distinguish between self induced and mutually induced emf. 
Ans. The emf induced in a coil due to change of flux produced by it linking with its own turns is called self 
induced emf.
The emf induced in a coil due to change of flux produced by the neighbouring coil linking with it is 
called mutually induced emf.
Q.8. Does inductance play any role in DC circuit? 
Ans. The role of inductance is only during the opening and closing of a DC circuit. It delays the rise of current 
during closing and delays the fall of current during opening. If in a DC circuit, the current reaches at 
its steady value, the circuit does not exhibit any inductance.
Q.9. What is a closed circuit?
Ans. The complete path for the flow of current through the load is known as a closed circuit.
Q.10. What is a short circuit?
Ans. If the supply mains are connected directly by a piece of wire without any load, it is known as short 
circuit. In these circuits, the value of the current is much greater than in the closed circuit. So the fuse 
melts.
Q.11. What is the type of energy being stored in a capacitor? 
Ans. When a capacitor is charged, an electro-static field is set-up in between the plates. Thus electrical 
energy is stored in the electrostatic field set-up between the plates of the capacitor

1.26 Electro-mechanical Energy Conversion Devices
(Motors and Generators)
A device (machine) which makes possible the conversion of energy from electrical to mechanical 
form or from mechanical to electrical form is called an Electromechanical energy conversion 
device or Electromechanical transducer.
Depending upon the conversion of energy from one from to the other, the electro-mechanical 
device can be named as motor or generator.
1. Motor: An electro-mechanical device (electrical machine) which converts electrical energy 
or power (EI) into mechanical energy or power (Z T) is called a motor.
Fig. 1.42 Motor
Electric motors are used for driving industrial machines e.g., hammer presses, drilling machines, 
lathes, shapers, blowers for furnaces etc., and domestic appliances e.g., refrigerators, fans, water 
pumps, toys, mixers etc. The block diagram of energy conversion, when the electro-mechanical 
device works as a motor, is shown in Fig. 1.42.
2. Generator: An electro-mechanical device (electrical machine) which converts mechanical 
energy or power (Z T) into electrical energy or power (EI) is called generator.
Fig. 1.43 Generator
Generators are used in hydro-electric power plants, steam power plants, diesel power plants, 
nuclear power plants and in automobiles. In the above said power plants various natural sources 
of energy are first converted into mechanical energy and then it is converted into electrical 
energy with the help of generators.
The block diagram of energy conversion, when the electro-mechanical device works as a 
generator, is shown in Fig. 1.43.
The same electro-mechanical device is capable of operating either as a motor or generator 
depending upon whether the input power is electrical or mechanical (see Fig. 1.44). Thus, the motoring 
and generating action is reversible

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
49
Fig. 1.44 Same machine can work as a generator or motor
The conversion of energy either from electrical to mechanical or from mechanical to electrical 
takes place through magnetic field. During conversion, whole of the energy in one form is not 
converted in the other useful form. In fact, the input power is divided into the following three parts;
(i) Most of the input power is converted into useful output power.
(ii) Some of the input power is converted into heat losses (I2R) which are due to the flow of current 
in the conductors, magnetic losses (hysteresis and eddy current losses) and friction losses.
(iii) A small portion of input power is stored in the magnetic field of electro-mechanical device.
1.27 Torque Development by the Alignment of Two Fields
To understand the process of torque development by the alignment of two fields, the following cases 
may be considered:
(i) Soft iron piece placed in the magnetic field.
(ii) Permanent magnet placed in the magnetic field.
(iii) Electromagnet placed in the magnetic field.
1.27.1 Soft Iron Piece Placed in the Magnetic Field
Consider a soft iron piece, capable of free rotation, placed in the magnetic field of two permanent 
magnets (see Fig. 1.45). The magnetic lines of force are set up in the soft iron piece as shown in Fig. 
1.45. The molecular poles get aligned parallel to the magnetic field due to magnetic induction. The 
soft iron piece obtains the polarities as marked in Fig. 1.45. This is the stable position of the soft iron 
piece. Torque produce in this case is zero.
Fig. 1.45 Stable position of soft iron piece

50
Electrical Machines
Fig. 1.46 Torque development at various positions of soft iron piece placed in the magnetic field
If the soft iron piece is rotated through an angle T (T < 90°), then by magnetic induction ends A
and B become North and South poles respectively. A force of attraction acts on the two ends and 
the soft iron piece will try to come in line with the main field i.e., the position of least reluctance 
path. This anticlockwise torque tries to decrease the angle T and is considered as negative. [See 
Fig. 1.46 (a)]. When soft iron piece is rotated through an angle T = 90°, an equal force of attraction 
and repulsion acts on each end of short iron piece [see Fig. 1.46 (b)], therefore, torque produced is 

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
51
zero. This is the unstable position of the soft iron piece, because a slight change in angle T in either 
direction will create a torque in that direction. When soft iron piece is rotated through an angle T
(T > 90°), then by magnetic induction ends A and B become South and North poles respectively. A 
force of attraction acts on the ends and soft iron piece will try to come in line with the main field. 
This clockwise torque tries to increase the angle T and is considered as positive [See Fig. 1.46 (c)].
When soft iron piece is rotated through an angle T = 180°, then by magnetic induction ends A and 
B will obtain South and North polarity respectively [see Fig. 1.46 (d)]. There is a force of attraction 
at ends A as well as at B of soft iron piece which being equal and opposite cancel each other. In this 
position, torque produced is zero. This is the stable position, because any change in angle T will 
create a torque which will tend to restore it position.
Following the similar explanation, the torque produced in the soft iron piece for various positions 
between 180° to 360° i.e., 180° < T < 360° can be determined.
When 270° > T > 180°, torque produce is negative (anticlockwise) as shown in Fig. 1.46 (e).
When T = 270°, torque produced is zero, and it is an unstable position as shown in Fig. 1.46 (f).
When360° > T > 270°, torque produced is positive (clockwise) as shown in Fig. 1.46 (g).
When T = 360°, torque produced is zero and it is a stable position.
In fact, when a soft iron piece is placed in the magnetic field, by magnetic induction iron piece 
is magnetised. The magnetised iron piece produces its own field, the axis of that field is shown by 
arrow head Fr. The axis of the main magnetic field is shown by the arrowhead Fm. The rotor field 
Fr tries to come in line with Fm due to which torque develops. Hence, it can be said that torque is 
developed by the alignment of two fields.
The angle between two magnetic fields on which torque depends is called torque angle. This 
torque angle is measured with respect to the direction to the direction of rotation of soft iron piece.
Thus, it is concluded that the torque is a function of torque angle T. The variation of torque with 
respect to angle T is shown in Fig. 1.47.
Fig. 1.47 Wave diagram of torque produced in soft iron piece
1.27.2 Permanent Magnet Placed in the Magnetic Field
Consider a permanent magnet capable of free rotation, placed in the magnetic field of two permanent 
magnets as shown in Fig. 1.48 (a). There is a force of attraction on north and south pole of the rotating 
magnet, which being equal and opposite cancel each other. In this position, torque produced is zero 

52
Electrical Machines
because the field of rotating magnet Fr and the field of stationary permanent magnet Fm are in line 
with each other.
When the rotating magnet in rotated through in angle T (T being less than 90°, equal to 90° more 
than 90° but less than 180°), its north pole will be attracted towards the south pole and south pole 
will be attracted towards the north pole of permanent stationary magnets [see Fig. 1.48 (b), (c) and 
(d) respectively]. In other words, we can say that the rotor field Fr tries to come in line with main 
field Fm and torque is developed. This anticlockwise torque is considered as negative, because it is 
decreasing the torque angle T.
When the permanent rotating magnet is rotated through an angle T = 180°, the two field Fr and 
Fm are in line with each other but acting in opposite direction [see Fig. 1.48 (e)], therefore, torque 
developed is zero but this is the unstable position because slight change in angle T in either direction 
will create a torque in that direction and the rotor will not regain its original position.
Fig. 1.48. Contd.

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
53
Fig. 1.48 Permanent magnet in magnetic field
When the permanent rotating magnet is rotated through an angle T more than 180°, but less than 
360° (i.e., T is less than 270°, equal to 270°, more than 270°), its north and south poles will be attracted 
towards the south and north poles of the permanent stationary magnets respectively [see Figs. 1.48 
(f), (g) and (h) respectively]. In other words, Fr will try to come in line with Fm and thus torque is 
developed. This clockwise torque is considered as positive, because it is increasing the torque angle T.
The maximum negative or positive torque is produced on the rotating permanent magnet when 
angle T = 90° or T = 270° (–90°) respectively, because at these positions, there is maximum force of 
attraction or repulsion acting on the rotating magnet.
When rotating, permanent magnet is rotated through an angle T = 360°, two field Fr and Fm are 
in line with each other [see Fig. 1.48 (i)]. Therefore, the torque developed is zero. This is the stable 
position because any change in angle T will develop a torque which tends to restore its original position.
Thus, it is concluded that the torque is produced due to the alignment of two fields.
The angle between the two magnetic fields on which torque depends is called Torque angle. This 
torque angle is measured with respect to the direction of rotation of rotating magnet.
The torque produced in the rotating magnet is a function of torque angle T. The variation of torque 
with respect angle T is shown graphically in Fig. 1.48 (j).
1.27.3 Electromagnet Placed in the Magnetic Field 
Consider an electromagnet, free to rotate about its axis, is placed in the magnetic field of permanent 
magnets. When the field produced by the electromagnet Fr is in the same direction as that of the main 
field produced by the stationary permanent magnets Fm, the torque produced is zero [see Fig. 1.49 (a)].
When the electromagnet is rotated through an angle T = 90°, the axis of the rotor field Fr will 
make an angle of T = 90° with the main field Fm. The rotor field Fr will try to come in line with the 

54
Electrical Machines
main field Fm, and produces an anticlockwise torque [see Fig. 1.49 (b)]. This torque is considered as 
negative because it reduces the torque angle T.
When the electromagnet is rotated through an angle T = 270°, the rotor field Fr will try to come 
in line with the main magnetic field Fm, therefore, a clockwise torque will be produced [see Fig. 1.49 
(c)], This torque is considered as positive because it increases the torque angle T.
Fig. 1.49 Electromagnet in the field of permanent magnets
When torque angle T is between zero and 180°, the torque produced is negative, whereas when 
T is between 180° to 360°, the torque produced is positive. When torque angle T = 90° or T = 270° 
(–90°), torque produced is maximum negative or maximum positive respectively.
Thus, it is conclude that the variation of torque with respect to torque angle T is similar to that 
in the case of permanent rotating magnet placed in the magnetic field of permanent stationary 
magnet[see Fig. 1.48 (j)].
The torque produced in this case is called an electromagnetic torque (Te).
1.28 Production of Torque
The torque produced by the alignment of two fields (i.e., rotor field and stationary main field) varies 
in magnitude and direction depending upon the torque angle T. Let us see, the effect of torque angle 
T on the torque produced in the following cases:
(i) In case of permanent magnet
(ii) In case of electromagnet.

1.28.1 In Case of Permanent Magnet

field of another permanent magnet B as shown in Fig. 1.50. Let,
T = angle between the axis of two fields Fm and Fr.

1.28.2 In Case of Electromagnet
Consider an electromagnet, having only one coil carrying current. The axis of the field produced 
by electromagnet Fr and axis of the main field produced by the permanent stationary magnet Fm 
are shown in Fig. 1.51. The angle between the two fields is q. Due to alignment of two fields torque 
is developed.

Electrical Machines
Fig. 1.51 Torque produced at an instant when an electromagnet is placed in a uniform magnetic field.
The production of torque can also be explained by the concept of electromagnetic force acting on 
the current carrying conductor placed in the magnetic field.
Let, 
F = Force acting on the two conductors.
r = radius of circle in which conductor rotates.
T = angle between the field Fm and Fr.
Torque = Force × Perpendicular distance.
In a right angle triangle, angle aob = T
Distance perpendicular to force, ab = oa sin T
= r sin T
Total torque acting on the two conductors, T = 2Fr sin T
Where 
B = Flux density of the main field.
l = Current flowing through the conductor.
l = Effective length of conductor.
?
T = 2BIlr sin T
or 
T = Kl sin T
[Where, Kl = 2BIlr is a constant]
or 
T v sin T. 
The magnitude of torque depends upon angle T, it will be maximum when T = 90°. When T is 
positive torque is produce in one direction (say anticlockwise), but when it is negative, the torque is 
produced in the other direction (say, clockwise). In fact, the direction of torque depends upon B and 
i. When either of the two is reversed the direction of torque is reversed but if both are reversed the 
direction of torque remains the same.
The direction of force action on a current carrying conductor when placed in the magnetic field 
can be determined by applying Fleming’s left hand rule.
Fleming’s Left Hand Rule: Stretch first finger, second finger and thumb of left hand mutually 
perpendicular to each other. If first finger indicates the direction of main magnetic field, second 
finger indicates the direction of flow of current through the conductor, then thumb will indicate the 
direction of fore acting on the conductor.

1.29 Production of Unidirectional Torque
As discussed earlier that by the alignment of two fields torque develops but the torque produced is 
not unidirectional. The unidirectional or continuous torque can be obtained by applying any one of 
the following methods.
Fig. 1.52. Contd.

Electrical Machines
Fig. 1.52 Production of torque by the rotation of stator poles (or stator field)
1.29.1 By Rotating the Main Magnets
When the main magnets are rotated, they drag the other magnets free to rotate (or the armature, 
electromagnet) along with it because of the tendency of the field of free rotating magnet or armature 
to align with the field of main magnet.
Consider a permanent magnet or electromagnet, which is free to rotate and is placed in the magnetic 
field of main magnet as shown in Fig. 1.52 (a and a’)]. Since the axis of the magnetic fields Fr and 
Fm produced by the two magnets is not aligned, a torque develops. Thus, the free magnet rotates by 
an angle T in clockwise direction and stays in that position as shown in Fig. 1.52 (b and bc).
Suppose that the main magnet is further rotated through an angle T in the clockwise direction [see 
Fig. 1.52 (c and c’)]. Again torque will develop in the free magnet and rotor rotates through an angle 
T to obtain the position shown in Fig. 1.52 (d and d’). The main magnet is again rotated through 
some more angle T (see Fig. 1.52 (e and e’)]. The free magnet will further rotate to obtain the position 
shown in Fig. (f and f’).
Thus, from the above facts it is concluded that if the main magnet is rotated in a particular direction 
by some angle, the free magnet will also rotate in the same direction by same angle. In other words, 
we can say that the free magnet is dragged by the main magnet. If the main magnet is rotated in 
any direction at a particular speed the free magnet will also rotate at the same speed in the same 
direction. This is the basic principle of synchronous machine.
1.29.2 By Changing the Direction of Flow of Current in the Conductors of 
Electromagnet 
By changing the direction of flow of current in the conductors of electromagnet (armature) in such 
a manner that the conductors facing a particular main field pole, always have the same direction of 
flow of current.
Consider an electromagnet (armature) placed in the magnetic field of main poles, as shown in 
Fig. 1.53 (a). The current flowing through the armature conductors is such that the axis of the field 
produced by armature Fr is 90° out of phase to that of main field Fm. Due to the alignment of two 

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
59
fields, torque is developed in the armature and it obtains the position as shown in Fig. 1.53 (b). At 
this position rotor (armature) will stop rotating.
Fig. 1.53 Produced of unidirectional torque by reversing the current in armature conductors
If the direction of flow of current in the armature conductors is reversed just when they cross the 
Y-Y’ axis (magnetic neutral axis) displaced by an angle T = 90° to that of main field Fm. The torque 
will always be exerted on the armature. Thus a continuous torque can be obtained. This is the basic 
principle of DC machines. The direction of flow of current in the armature conductors is reversed 
by providing commutator on DC machines.
Example 1.38
In Fig. 1.54 draw the magnetic lines of force produced by the stator. Mark the polarity of poles, 
direction of stator and rotor field, torque angle and direction of the torque produced.

Solution:
For solution, the following steps may be considered;
1. Stator magnetic field is drawn as shown in Fig. 1.55 by applying right hand thumb rule to stator 
current carrying conductors.
2. We know that flux leaves the N-poles and enters the S-pole, accordingly polarity of the poles 
is marked in Fig. 1.55.

Electrical Machines
3. The axis and direction of stator field and rotor field are marked by arrows Fmand Fr,respectively 
(the axis of the rotor field lies perpendicular to the plane of coil or it lies in between the conductors 
carrying current in opposite direction).
4. The angle between rotor field Fr and stator field Fm is torque angle represented by T.
5. Due to alignment of two fields, rotor field Fr tries to come in line with the stator field Fm. Thus 
anticlockwise torque T is produced.
Example 1.39
Mark the polarity of poles, direction of torque produced and the torque angle in Fig. 1.56.
Fig. 1.56 Given figure
Fig. 1.57 Position of the axis of stator and rotor field
Solution:
Look at Fig. 1.56, the various quantities are marked adopting the following steps:
1. Applying right hand thumb rule to stator current carrying conductors, the direction of magnetic 
lines of force is marked, as shown in Fig. 1.57.
2. As flux leaves the north pole and enters and south pole, accordingly the polarity of the poles is 
marked.
3. The axis of the stator field and its direction is marked by the arrow head Fm.
4. A clockwise field is set-up around the bunch of rotor conductor carrying current inward i.e., ±
and anticlockwise field is set-up around the bunch of rotor conductors carrying current outward 
i.e., . Hence axis of the rotor field lies in between the conductors carrying current in opposite 
direction.
5. Accordingly rotor field axis and its direction is marked by the arrow head Fr.
6. The angle between rotor field and stator field is called torque angle and is marked as T.
7. The rotor field Fr tries to come in line with the stator field Fm due to which torque T develops 
in clockwise direction as marked by the arrowhead.
Example 1.40
To obtain clockwise torque, mark the direction of flow of current in both the pole windings and on 
the rotor conductors in Fig. 1.58.

Solution:
1. Let the direction of flow of current in pole windings be as marked in Fig. 1.59
2. Applying right hand thumb rule, mark the polarity of poles, the axis of stator field and its direction as 
Fm.
3. Mark the axis of rotor field perpendicular to the plane of rotor coils (see Fig. 1.59).
4. To obtain clockwise torque mark the direction to rotor field Fr as shown in Fig. 1.59.
5. To obtain the said direction of rotor field, mark the direction of flow of current in rotor conductors 
applying right hand thumb rule, as shown in Fig. 1.59.
Example 1.41
A hollow cylindrical stator contains a solid rotor. Both are 
made of soft iron. One coil carrying current is placed on 
the stator as shown in Fig. 1.60. Ignore the coil shown on 
the rotor. Mark the poles developed on the stator. Draw 
the lines of force. If another coil carrying current is placed 
on the rotor as shown in Fig. 1.60. Will the arrangement 
produce any torque? Give reasons. If the stator is made 
to rotate at N rpm what will the rotor do?
Solution:
Ignoring the rotor coil and applying right hand thumb rule to the current carrying conductors of 
stator the field produced by them is shown in Fig. 1.61. We know that magnetic lines of force leave 
the north pole and enter the south pole, accordingly, the polarity of stator poles is marked in Fig. 1.61. 
Accordingly the direction of stator field (main field) Fm is marked in Fig. 1.61 and 1.62.
If a current carrying coil is placed on the rotor as shown in Fig. 1.62, the rotor will also become an 
electromagnet. Applying right hand thumb rule to the rotor current carrying conductors the direction 
of rotor field Fr is also marked in Fig. 1.62.
The two fields Fr and Fm are in line with each other or torque angle T = 0, therefore, the torque 
produced in the rotor by this arrangement will be zero.

If the stator or main field is made to rotate at N rpm in any direction the rotor field will be dragged 
by the main field. Thus, the rotor will also rotate in the same direction and at the same speed i.e.,N rpm
Example 1.42

Referring to this figure, answer the following questions by means of neat diagram.
(a) For the direction of current in the field coils as shown, mark the polarity of each pole.
(b) For the direction of current in the field coils as shown, mark the direction of current in the rotor 
conductors for clockwise rotation of rotor.
Fig. 1.63 Given figure 
Fig. 1.64 Stator field and current in rotor conductors
Solution:
Applying right hand thumb rule to the stator current carrying conductors the direction of magnetic 
lines of force is marked. Flux leaves the north pole and enters the south pole, accordingly, the polarity 
of the poles is marked in Fig. 1.64
To obtain clockwise rotation the direction of force, which should act on the rotor conductors is 
marked. By applying Fleming’s left hand rule, the direction of flow current in the rotor conductors is 
marked. The direction of flow of current in rotor conductors which are under the influence of N-pole 
is outward and which are under the influence of S-pole is inward (see Fig. 1.64).

1.30 emf Induced in a Rotating Coil Placed in a Magnetic Field
Consider a coil AB placed on the outer periphery of a soft iron solid cylindrical rotor. The stator poles 
carry the exciting coils. When current flows through exciting coils flux is set up as shown in Fig. 
1.65. The rotor is rotating in clockwise direction at constant angular velocity of Z radians/sec. The 
direction of linear velocity (perpendicular to the plane of coil) acting on conductor A is shown in Fig. 
1.66, which makes an angle T with the direction of field. The component of velocity perpendicular 
to the field is vU = v sin T.
Fig. 1.65 Position of stator field
Fig. 1.66 Motion of conductor with respect to field
The emf induced in conductor A, e = Blv sin T
Where, 
B = flux density in the rotor in Tesla
l = effective length of the conductor in metre
As the coil has two conductors only,
?
emf induced in the coil at this instant,
e = 2 Blv sin T
If coil has N number of turns then,
emf induced in coil = 2NBlv sin T
If the angle between the plane of the coil and direction of magnetic field is D, then component of 
velocity perpendicular to the field vU = v cos D (see Fig. 1.66).
?
The emf induced in the coil, e = 2 N Blv cos D
The direction of induced emf in conductor A and B can be determined by applying Fleming’s 
Right Hand Rule or Lenz’s Law.
By applying Fleming’s Right Hand Rule to conductor A, which is moving downward, the induced 
emf is out of the plane of paper [ ], whereas conductor B is moving upward and the induced emf is 
into the plane of paper [±].
According to Lenz’s Law, we can say that when coil is rotating in clockwise direction the flux 
linkages are decreasing [see Fig. 1.67 (a)]. Thus the emf induced in the coil would have the direction 

64
Electrical Machines
such that the magnetic flux produced by its current tends to oppose the decreasing flux linkages i.e., 
the coil will set up the field which will increases the flux linking with the coil [see Fig. 1.67 (b)].
Fig. 1.67 Field produced by the rotor conductors
The magnitude of induced emf depends upon sine of angle T. The emf induced in the coil at 
position (a), (e) and (i) in Fig. 1.68 is zero and at position (c) and (g) it is maximum. The variation of 
emf with respect to angle T is shown graphically in Fig. 1.69.

65
The above arguments regarding the magnitude and direction of the emf induced are equally 
applicable if the main magnetic field is rotating and the coil is kept stationary.
Example 1.43
Mark the direction of emf in the conductor of the rotor of fig 1.70. when the rotor moves:
(i) in the clockwise direction;
(ii) in the anticlockwise direction
Fig. 1.70 Given figure
Solution:
Applying right hand thumb rule to the current carrying conductors of stator, the direction of magnetic 
lines of force is shown in Fig. 1.71 and 1.72. Accordingly the polarity of the poles is marked.
(i) When rotor is rotating in clockwise direction see Fig. 1.71, the direction emf induced in the 
rotor conductors is marked by applying Fleming’s right hand rule to the conductors directly 
under the influence of north and south pole. The emf induced, in all the conductors under the 
influence of north-pole is in one direction i.e., ± whereas, the emf induced in all the conductors 
under the influence of south pole is in other direction i.e., .

(ii) Similarly, by applying Fleming’s right hand rule to the rotor conductors rotating in anticlockwise 
direction, the direction of induced emf is marked in them as shown in Fig. 1.72.

66
Electrical Machines
The emf induced in the rotor conductors placed on the magnetic neutral axis (i.e., X-axis) is zero, 
because at this position the conductor move parallel to the magnetic lines of force.
Example 1.44
A coil is rotating in clockwise direction in a two pole magnetic 
field. With the help of a neat diagram show what will be the 
direction of the induced emf in the coil? Show on the diagram 
the polarity of the poles and the direction of rotating of the coil.
Solution:
A coil AB is placed in the magnetic field [see Fig. 1.73]. The 
polarity of the poles, direction of magnetic field and direction 
of rotation (clockwise) is marked in Fig. 1.73.
Applying Fleming’s right hand rule, the direction of emf 
induced in conductor A, which is under the influence of N-pole, is 
into the plane of paper. Whereas, in conductor B, which is under 
the influence of S-pole, is out of the plane of paper as marked in 
Fig. 1.73.
Example 1.45
The rotors of Fig. 1.74 and 1.75 are each rotating in anti-clockwise direction, Mark in each case:
(i) The direction of emf induced in the stator coils.
(ii) The coils sides which belong to the same stator coils.

Fig. 1.75 Given figure
Solution:
Applying right hand thumb rule to the rotor current carrying conductors of Fig. 1.74 the field produced 
is shown in Fig. 1.76, accordingly the polarity of the poles is marked.
(i) The rotor is rotating in anticlockwise direction, therefore the relative motion of stator conductors 
with respect to the field is clockwise. Applying Fleming’s right hand rule to the stator conductors 
the direction of induced emf is marked (see Fig. 1.76 and 1.77). In all the conductors under the 
influence of north pole, the induced emf is in one direction i.e., out of the plane of paper. Whereas 
in the conductors which are under the influence of south pole the induced emf is in the other 
direction i.e., into the plane of paper.

(ii) Each coil has two coil sides. If one coil side is placed under north pole, the other side of the 
same coil is placed under south pole, The position of the two sides must be the same under 
the two poles (i.e., if one side is placed at the centre of N-pole then the other side must also be 
placed at the centre of consecutive S-pole). The four coils in Fig. 1.76 and 1.77 are marked as 
1-1c, 2-2c, 3-3c, and 4-4c.

carrying the field winding. Mark the direction of the emf induced 
in the conductors of stator.

(b) for an anticlockwise direction of rotation of the rotor.
Solution:
Applying right hand thumb rule to the current carrying conductors of rotor, the field produced by it 
is shown in Fig. 1.79 and 1.80. Accordingly, the polarity of rotor poles is marked.

Applying Fleming’s right hand rule to the stator conductors the direction of induced emf is 
marked.
Note: While applying Fleming’s right hand rule the direction of rotation of conductors with respect 
to the field is considered. In the above case rotation of conductors is anticlockwise with respect 
to the field.

emf is marked.
(The emf induced in the conductors placed on the magnetic neutral axis (i.e., X-axis) will be zero 
as they do not cut the magnetic field).
1.31 Elementary Concept of Electrical Machines
(Energy conversion in electrical machines)
By electrical machine, here we mean a generator or motor. We shall discuss the operation of machine 
as a generator and motor.
1.31.1 Operation of Machine as a Generator (Conversion of Mechanical Energy into 
Electric Energy)
A coil is placed in a constant stationary magnetic field. Let it be rotated in clockwise direction at an 
angular velocity of Z radians per second by some outside driving mechanical torque Tm. The coil 
sides cut the magnetic field (or the flux linking with coil changes) and emf (e) is induced in the coil. 
The direction of induced emf can be determined by applying Fleming’s right hand rule or Lenz’s 
Law and is marked in Fig. 1.81 (a). The coil is connected to an external load resistor R, therefore 
current (i) flows through the coil and external load resistor. The direction of flow of current in the 
coil is marked in Fig. 1.81 (a) and (b). When current flows through the coil conductors, they produce 
their own magnetic field. The direction of this rotor field is marked by arrowhead Fr. The rotor field 
Fr tries to come in line with the main field Fm and an electromagnetic torque Te is produced in the 
opposite direction to that of the rotation.
Fig. 1.81 Concept of generator

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
69
If the coil circuit is not closed, no current would flow through the coil and hence no electromagnetic 
torque will be developed (i.e., Te = 0), under such a condition the opposition is only due to frictional 
torque (neglecting iron losses). Therefore, the mechanical torque Tm applied must be sufficient to 
overcome the frictional torque. It may be noted that frictional torque always acts in opposite direction 
to the direction of rotation.
i.e., 
Tm = Tf (at no-load)
When the load resistance is connected, current flows and electromagnetic torque is produced in 
opposite direction to that of mechanical torque. Under this condition the mechanical torque Tm must 
be sufficient to overcome the electromagnetic torque and frictional torque (iron losses neglected).
Thus, 
Tm = Te + Tf
...(i)
or 
ZTm = ZTe + ZTf
...(ii)
or 
ZTe = ZTm – ZTf
where, ZTm = Mechanical input power.
ZTf = Power losses due to friction.
ZTe = Mechanical power developed in the rotor which is converted into electrical power.
When conductors move perpendicular to the magnetic field,

or e = ir + iR
multiplying both sides by i, we get,

...(iv)
ei – i2r = vi
where, 
ei = electrical power generated,
i2r = power lost in the resistance of coil, called copper losses,
vi or i2R = electrical power output to the load.
Thus, we conclude that out of the input power (Z Tm) only Z Te is the mechanical power which 
is converted into electrical power (e i). After subtracting the copper losses (i2r), the electrical power 
available at the load is only i2R. This is how the conversion of power takes place in electrical machine 
working as a generator. The power flow diagram (neglecting iron losses) for the generator is shown 
in Fig. 1.82.

Fig. 1.82 Power flow in generator action
1.31.2 Operation of Machine as a Motor
Now consider a coil placed in the constant stationary field. The coil is connected to a battery [see 
Fig. 1.83 (a)]. The current i flows through the coil conductors in the direction shown in Fig. 1.83 (a) 
and (b). Current carrying conductors produce axis of magnetic field Fr in the direction as marked. 
The rotor field Fr tries to come in line with the main field Fm. Thus, electromagnetic torque is 
developed on the coil in anticlockwise direction. The coil is free to rotate, therefore, it starts rotating 
in anticlockwise direction (say at w rad/sec).
Fig. 1.83 Concept of motor
When the coil rotates in anticlockwise direction, flux is cut by the conductors (coil sides), therefore, 
an emf is induced in them in the direction marked in Fig. 1.83 (a), [direction is found by applying 
Fleming’s right hand rule], which is opposite to the direction of flow of current or applied voltage V.20
If r is resistance of coil,
Applied voltage, V = e + ir
Multiplying both sides by i, we get
V i = ei + i2 r
or 
V i – i2 r = ei

Electro Magnetic Circuits 
71
where, 
Vi = electrical power input,
i2r = power lost in the resistance of the coil called copper losses,
ei = electrical power developed in the rotor which is converted into 
mechanical power.
that is, 
ei = Z Te
[from equation (iii)]
Thus, out of the input power (Vi), the copper losses (i2r) are subtracted and only power (e i) is 
developed in the rotor which is converted into mechanical power.
Friction acts in opposite direction to that of rotation, therefore, the direction of frictional torque is 
in clockwise direction as marked in Fig. 1.83 (b). When mechanical load is applied, the mechanical 
torque Tm tries to reduce the speed of rotor, therefore, it is also acting in clockwise direction as 
marked in the figure.
Thus, the electromagnetic torque must be sufficient to meet with the sum of frictional torque and 
mechanical torque i.e.,
Te = Tm + Tf
or 
ZTe = ZTm + ZTf
or 
ZTe – ZTf = ZTm.
The actual output mechanical power is only ZTm, which is available at the shaft. This power is 
obtained after subtracting mechanical losses (ZTf) from the power developed (ZTe) in the rotor. The 
power flow diagram (neglecting iron losses) for the motor is shown in Fig. 1.84.
Electrical power converted into mechanical power.

Conclusion
From the above discussion, the following conclusions are drawn;
(i) In generating action, the induced emf produces the armature current, therefore, e and i both are 
in same direction, whereas, in motoring action, the induced emf opposes the conduction and 
current flows in opposite direction to induced emf
(ii) In motoring action, the electromagnetic torque produces the rotation, (Te and Z both are in same 
direction), whereas, in generating operation, the electromagnetic torque opposes the rotation 
(Te acts in opposite direction to Z).
(iii) In generating action the torque angle T is leading (Fr leads Fm by an angle T with respect to 
direction of rotation), whereas in motoring action, the torque angle T is lagging (Fr lags behind 
Fm by an angle T with respect to direction of rotation).

72
Electrical Machines
(iv) In generating action, the rotation is due to mechanical torque, therefore, Tm and Z are in same 
direction, whereas in motoring action rotation is opposite to mechanical torque.
(v) In both generating and motoring action, electromagnetic torque always acts in opposite directions 
to mechanical torque (i.e., Te always acts in opposite direction to Tm).
(vi) In both the cases, frictional torque acts in opposite direction to rotation (i.e., Tf always acts in 
opposite direction to Z).

3. Mechanical torque Tm acts in opposite direction 
to electromagnetic torque Te so that ZTe = ZTm
+ ZTf.

current flows in opposite direction to that of 
induced emf.
5. In motor action, E > V
6. In motoring action, the torque angle Tis legging.
7. In motoring action, electrical energy is converted 
into mechanical energy.

(ii) When current flows through the coil sides (rotor), field is set up around the conductors, the 
direction of the rotor field is marked by arrow head Fr. Rotor field (Fr) tries to come in line with 
main field Fm, thus electromagnetic torque Te is produced in clockwise direction as marked by 
the arrow head in Fig. 1.87.
(iii) When the circuit is closed through an external resistance, the direction of flow of current in the 
coil sides is shown in Fig. 1.87.
The angle between rotor field Fr and main field Fmis the torque angle T as marked in the figure.
(iv) For energy conversion the mechanical torque Tm always acts in opposite direction to that of 
electro-magnetic torque Te. Therefore, the direction of external mechanical torque applied is 
anticlockwise as marked in the figure.
(v) In the coil sides the direction of flow of current is same as that of the induced emf therefore, 
the machine acts as a generator.
(vi) The friction always acts in opposite direction to the direction of rotation, therefore, the direction 
of frictional torque is clockwise as marked by the arrow head in Fig. 1.87.

Introduction
Transformer is considered to be a backbone of a power system.
For generation, transmission and distribution of electric power, AC system is adopted instead of 
DC system because voltage level can be changed comfortably by using a transformer. For economic 
reasons, high voltages are required for transmission whereas, for safety reasons, low voltages are 
required for utilisation. Transformer is an essential part of power system. Hence, it is rightly said that 
transformer is a backbone of a power system. In this chapter, we shall discuss the general features 
and principle of operation of single-phase transformers.
2.1 Transformer 
A transformer is a static device that transfers AC electrical power from one circuit to the other at 
the same frequency but the voltage level is usually changed.
The block diagram of a transformer is shown in Fig. 2.1(a). When the voltage is raised on the output 
side (V2 > V1), the transformer is called a step up transformer, whereas, the transformer in which the 
voltages is lowered on the output side (V2 < V1) is called a step down transformer.
Fig. 2.1 (a) Block diagram of a single-phase transformer

Single-Phase Transformers 
81
Necessity
In our country, usually electric power is generated at 11 kV. The voltage level is raised to 220 kV, 400 
kV or 750 kV by employing step-up transformers for transmitting the power to long distances. Then 
to feed different areas, as per their need, the voltage level is lowered down to 66 kV, 33 kV or 11 kV 
by employing step-down transformers. Ultimately for utilisation of electrical power, the voltage is 
stepped down to 400/230 V for safety reasons.
Thus, transformer plays an important role in the power system. The pictorial view of a power 
transformer is shown in Fig. 2.2 (b). The important accessories are labelled on it.
Fig. 2.1 (b)
Transformer
Applications
Main applications of the transformers are given below:
(a) To change the level of voltage and current in electric power systems.
(b) As impedance-matching device for maximum power transfer in low-power electronic and control 
circuits.
(c) As a coupling device is electronic circuits
(d) To isolate one circuit from another, since primary and secondary are not electrically connected.
(e) To measure voltage and currents; these are known as instrument transformers.
Transformers are extensively used in AC power systems because of the following reasons:
1. Electric energy can be generated at the most economic level (11–33 kV)
2. Stepping up the generated voltage to high voltage, extra high voltage EHV (voltage above 230 
kV), or to even ultra high voltage UHV (750 kV and above) to suit the power transmission 
requirement to minimise losses and increase transmission capacity of lines.
3. The transmission voltage is stepped down in many stages for distribution and utilisation for 
domestic, commercial and industrial consumers.

2.2 Working Principle of a Transformer 
The basic principle of a transformer is electromagnetic induction.
A single-phase transformer consists of two windings placed over a laminated silicon steel core. 
The winding having less number of turns is called low-voltage winding and the winding having more 
number of turns is called high voltage winding.
(a) 
(b)
Fig. 2.2 (a) Single-phase transformer (core and windings) (b) Flux linking with primary and secondary
Also, the winding to which AC supply is connected is called a primary winding and the other one 
is called a secondary winding to which load is connected. Once AC supply of voltage V1 is given to 
primary winding, an alternating flux is set-up in the magnetic core which links with the primary and 
secondary winding. Consequently, self-induced emf E1 and mutually-induced emf E2 are induced in 
primary and secondary, respectively. These induced emf’s are developed in phase opposition to V1 as 
per Lenz’s law. The self-induced emf in the primary is also called back emf since it acts in opposite 
direction to the applied voltage.
Although, there is no electrical connection between primary and secondary winding, still electric 
power is transferred from one circuit (primary side) to the other circuit (secondary side). It is all 
because of magnetic coupling, i.e., the alternating flux which is set-up in the core linking with both the 
windings. The magnitude of induced emf in a coil depends upon rate of change of flux linkages i.e., e 
v N. since, the rate of change of flux for both the winding is the same, the magnitude of induced emf 
in primary and secondary will depend upon their number of turns, i.e., primary induced emf E1 v N1
and secondary induced emf E2 v N2. When N2 > N1, the transformer is called a step-up transformer, 
on the other hand, when N2< N1 the transformer is called step-down transformer.
Turn ratio: The ratio of primary to secondary turns is called turn ratio, i.e., turn ratio 
= N1/ N2.
Transformation ratio: The ratio of secondary voltage to primary voltage is called voltage 
transformation ratio of the transformer. It is represented by K.

2.3 Construction of Transformer
The following are the major elements of a transformer:

Single-Phase Transformers 
83
(i) Magnetic circuit mainly comprises of transformer core having limbs and yokes.
(ii) Electric circuits mainly comprises of windings, insulation and bushings.
(iii) Tank mainly comprises of cooling devices, conservator and ancillary apparatus.
The construction of a transformer depends largely on its size and the duty which it is to perform. 
Designers make necessary changes as per the requirement. In practice, continuous improvements 
are being made in the construction of transformers.
2.3.1 Core Material
For core construction sheets of alloy steels are used. The main constituents of alloy steel are silicon 
and carbon in small quantities which increases the permeability at low flux densities and reduces 
the hysteresis loss to large extent. Addition of silicon also reduces the eddy currents to some extent 
because it increases the resistivity. In addition to this, these constituents also increase the mechanical 
strength of the core.
Now-a-days cold rolled grain oriented steel (CRGOS) sheets are used for core construction because 
of their excellent magnetic properties in the direction of rolling. This material allows flux density 
as high as 2.8 Wb/m2.
2.3.2 Core Construction
In order to reduce eddy current loss, the core of the transformer is laminated. Since eddy current 
losses are proportional to the square of the thickness of laminations, every effort is made to reduce 
their thickness as small as possible. But there is a practical limit beyond which the thickness of 
laminations cannot be decreased further on account of mechanical considerations. This practical 
limit of thickness of each lamination is 0.3 mm. The laminations are usually made of 0.33 to 0.5 mm 
thick. These laminations are insulated from each other by a thin layer of oxide coating or varnish.
Core Cross-Section
Small transformers have rectangular section limbs with rectangular coils or square section limbs 
with circular coils as shown in Figs. 2.3(a) and (b).
Fig. 2.3 Core and windings 

84
Electrical Machines
As the size of the transformer increases, it becomes wasteful to use rectangular cores. For this 
purpose the cores are square shaped as shown in Fig. 2.4(a). The circle represents the inner surface of 
the tubular former carrying the windings. This circle is known as the circumscribing circle. Clearly 
a lot of useful space is wasted, the length of circumference of circumscribing circle being large in 
a comparison to its cross-section. This means that the length of mean turn of winding is increased 
giving rise to higher I2R losses and conductor cost.
Circular coils are preferred for winding a transformer as they can be easily wound on machines 
on a former, conductors can easily be bent and winding does not bulge out due to radial forces 
developed during operation.
With larger transformers, cruciform cores, which utilise the space better, are used as shown in 
Fig. 2.4(b). As the space utilisation is better with cruciform cores, the diameter of circumscribing 
circle is smaller than with square cores of the same area. Thus the length of mean turn of copper 
is reduced with consequent reduction in cost of copper. It should be kept in mind that two different 
sizes of laminations are used in cruciform cores.
With large transformers, further steps are introduced as shown in Figs. 2.4(c) and (d) to utilise the 
core space which reduces the length of mean turn with consequent reduction in both cost of copper 
and copper loss. 
Fig. 2.4 
Cruciform core section
By increasing the number of steps, the area of circumscribing circle is more effectively utilised. 
The most economical dimensions of various steps for a multi-stepped core can be calculated. The 
results are tabulated in the following Table:

Laminations of the core and insulation between the laminations have the effect of reducing the 
effective or net area of the core. The net core cross-sectional area is about 10% less than the gross-
sectional area due to the laminations of the core and insulation such as paper or varnish. The ratio 

Single-Phase Transformers

of the net cross-sectional area to gross cross sectional area is called the iron space factor or simply 
iron factor Ki.

2.3.3 Transformer Winding
Transformer windings may be classified into two groups viz. concentric winding and sandwiched 
winding. Concentric windings are used in core type transformers as shown in Fig. 2.5(a). Sandwiched 
windings are almost exclusively used in shell type transformers as shown in Fig. 2.5(b).
Fig. 2.5 Single-phase transformer (sectional view)
The positioning of the H.V. and L.V. windings with respect to the core is also very important from 
the point of view of insulation requirement. The low-voltage winding is placed nearer to the core in 
the case of concentric windings and on the outside positions in the case of sandwiched windings as 
shown in Figs. 2.5(a) and (b) on account of less and easier insulation facilities.
Concentric Windings
The concentric windings may be classified into four major groups, viz.
1. Spiral windings.
2. Helical winding.
3. Crossover winding.
4. Continuous disc winding.
Spiral Winding: The spiral coils are suitable only for windings which carry current more than 100 
A. Usually these are employed for LV windings. However, these are also used for HV windings when 
the winding is to carry current more than 100 A.

86
Electrical Machines
Spiral coils normally consists of layers wound continuously 
from top to bottom of the coil and a composite conductor of coil 
may consist of a number of square or rectangular strips in parallel. 
These coils are mechanical very strong and are usually former 
wound or wound directly on to solid insulating cylinder.
The spiral coils may be wound in single layer or multilayer. 
In small transformers, sometimes, it is difficult to arrange them 
satisfactorily in single layer, then these are wound in multilayer. 
A typical two layer spiral coil is shown in Fig. 2.6. 
When more than is required to be arranged in radial direction, 
it becomes necessary to introduce transpositioning throughout the 
length of winding to keep the resistance and leakage reactance of 
each conductors to be the same.
Helical Winding: The helical coils cover the intermediate range 
of current which falls between the range of high current range of 
spiral coils and low current range of multi-conductor disc coil. 
This coil is wound in the form of helix where each conductor 
may consist of a number of rectangular strips wound in parallel 
radially. Helical winding is mostly suitable for low-voltage (11 
kV to 33 kV) windings of large transformers.
In general, simple single layer helical coils are used for LV
side of large transformers. The cross-sectional view of a typical 
single layer helical coil is shown in Fig. 2.7. However, multiplayer 
helical coils may be used for high-voltage windings.
Crossover Winding: The crossover coils are suitable only 
for windings which carry current less than 20 A. These are 
largely used for high voltage windings of comparatively small 
transformers. These coils are usually wound on formers. 
Generally, each coil consists of several layers and each layer 
carries several turns. The conductor may be of round (wire) or 
rectangular (strip) shape, insulated with cotton or paper covering.
The cross-sectional and isometric view of a typical crossover 
coil is shown in Fig. 2.8(a) and (b) respectively. The complete 
winding assembly employing crossover coils consists of a number 
of such coils connected in series. This assembly in placed over the 
limb of the core. The coils are usually spaced apart by means of 
insulating key sector to facilitate free oil circulation for cooling.
Continuous Disc Winding: The continuous disc coils are most 
suitable for high voltage (low current) large power transformers. 
As the name suggests, these coils consist of a number of discs. Each disc consist of a number of turns 
wound radially over one another from inside outwards and outside inwards alternately and conductors

Fig. 2.7 Helical winding

Single-Phase Transformers 
87
pass uninterruptedly from disc to disc. Generally, rectangular strip conductors are used and they are 
wound on the flat side so that each disc becomes mechanically very strong.
Fig. 2.8 Cross-over winding
The cross-sectional and isometric view of a typical disc coil is shown in Figs. 2.9(a) and (b), respectively.
While using multiple strips, transpositioning of conductors has to be taken core so that uniform 
resistance and inductance can be ensured. The discs are wound on to an insulating cylinder and a 
spacer is provided between the discs when arranged vertically to ensure proper circulation of oil.
Fig. 2.9 Continuous disc winding

Electrical Machines
Sandwiched Winding
The schematic diagram of a sandwiched winding is shown in Fig. 2.10. Sandwiched windings are 
commonly employed for shell-type transformers. The leakage reactance of the windings can be easily 
controlled by employing sandwiched winding. The nearer are the high voltage and low voltage coils, 
the less is the leakage flux. Leakage can be further reduced by subdividing the high voltage and 
low voltage coils. The high voltage sections lie between two consecutive low voltage sections. The 
two end sections are low-voltage sections and contain half the turns of other low-voltage sections. 
Each normal section, whether high voltage or low voltage, has equal number of ampere-turns 
in order to balance the mmf of adjacent sections. Lower values of reactance can be obtained by 
increasing the number of subdivisions.
Fig. 2.10 Sandwiched winding
2.3.4 Insulation
The insulation employed in a transformer may be classified into two major groups e.g., major and 
mirror insulation.
Major insulation: The insulating cylinders between the low voltage winding and the core and those 
between the high voltage and the low voltage windings, the insulating barriers which are inserted 
between adjacent limbs when necessary and the insulation between the coils and the core yokes etc., 
fall into the category of major insulation. These insulating cylinders and barriers are usually made 
of pressboard or synthetic resin bonded paper. These cylinders are made in such a way that they are 
not only excellent insulators but also mechanically strong. The permittivity of insulating cylinders 
is about 4. The major insulation is transformer oil which has a permittivity of 2.2.
Minor Insulation : This is the insulation on individual turns and between layers. The conductor 
insulation may be of paper, cotton or glass tape, the latter being used for air insulated transformers 
only. The insulation is wrapped round the conductor without overlap of adjacent turns.
The windings of the transformers are generally impregnated. Now-a-days transformer oil has 
greatly replaced varnish as an impregnant. In general there are three main stages in preparing the 
windings for oil impregnation. In the first stage the pre-drying and shrinking of the coils are done. 

Single-Phase Transformers 
89
In the second stage, further drying is carried out until the required insulation resistance is obtained. 
These two stages are usually accomplished by circulation of hot air at atmospheric pressure in an 
oven while making sure that the oxidation of the winding does not take place. In the final stage, the 
vapour and gas are removed from the assembled core and the windings prior to oil impregnation. This 
process must be carried out at a temperature of approximately 100°C and a vacuum of at least 0.5 
mm. The windings of the power transformers are generally impregnated after assembly on the core.
Note: Never provide excessive insulation, it not only increases the cost but it also makes heat 
transfer poor.
2.3.5 Bushings
The core and winding assembly is placed in the transformer tank. The winding terminals are to be 
connected to the external conductors (transmission lines) or bus-bars where conductor has to pass 
through the top cover of the tank which is earthed on account of safety.
These outgoing terminals of a transformer are provided with bushings.
For system voltages upto 66 kV, non-condenser bushings such as porcelain or oil-filled bushings 
are used whereas for system voltages more than 66 kV, condenser bushings are employed for economic 
reasons.
The oil filled bushings carry a hollow tube conductor placed in the centre of a hollow porcelain 
cylinder. The space between the conductor and the porcelain is filled with insulating oil. Normally, 
there is a glass chamber at the top of the bushing to indicate the oil level which also acts as an expansion 
chamber for the oil when the temperature of the bushing rises. Under the influence of the electric 
field, dust or metallic particles present in the oil have a tendency to align themselves in the direction 
of the electric field, giving rise to paths of low dielectric strength which may lead to breakdown of 
the bushing. To break up these chains, sometimes concentric bakelite tubes are used as insulating 
barriers in between the porcelain and the conductor. Fig. 2.11(a) shows a typical oil filled bushing.
The body of a condenser type bushing shown in Fig. 2.11(b) is formed by inserting aluminium foil 
layers into a paper winding at predetermined radii. The conducting layers take the form of co-axial 
cylinders in such a way that the electrical stress in the radial direction does not exceed 7.5 kV/mm 
for synthetic resin bonded paper (s.r.b.p.) or 20 kV/mm for oil impregnated paper (o.i.p.) and the axial 
stress does not exceed 0.4 kV/mm for air and 0.65 kV/mm for oil. The capacitances between adjacent 
pair of conducting surfaces are known as partial capacitances between adjacent pair of conducting 
surfaces are known as partial capacitances. The thickness of the partial capacitances and the values of 
the partial capacitances are made equal by properly proportioning the axial length of the conducting 
layers. Consequently, the insulating layers are equally stressed and the dielectric stresses are kept 
within the limits for the insulating material used. A typical condenser bushing is shown in Fig. 2.12. 
For use in outdoor substations, the bushing is covered by a porcelain rain-shed which is outwardly 
very similar to a porcelain bushing. The space between the rain shed and the bushing assembly is 
filled with insulating oil. The rain sheds are designed to increase the creepage length taking into 
consideration the electric field distribution and thus reduce the tendency to flashover under dry as 
well as wet conditions.

The bushings are mounted in localised projections from the transformer tank known as turrets 
and current transformers are often housed in turrets around the flange barrels of the bushings. The 
size of the transformer tank is also greatly influenced by the portion of the lower end of the bushing 
inserted into the tank.
2.3.6 Transformer Tank
In modern transformers, depending upon the size, the following types of tanks are mainly used:
(i) Plain Sheet Steel Tank
(ii) Tubed Tanks

On the basis of core construction and the arrangement to windings, the transformers are named as 
(i) core type transformers (ii) shell type and Berry-type transformers.
Fig. 2.12 Single-phase small transformers used with electrical gadgets
Core-type Transformers
In Such transformers the magnetic core is built up of laminations to form a rectangular frame. The 
laminations are cut in the form of L-shape strips as shown in Fig. 2.13(a). To eliminate high reluctance 
continuous joint, the laminations are placed alternately as shown in Fig. 2.13(b).
The upper horizontal portion of the core is known a yoke and the vertical portion, as shown 
in Fig. 2.14(b), which carries windings is called limb. Usually, the cross-sectional area of yoke is 
kept 15 to 20% more than the limbs because it reduces the flux density and consequently reduces 
the iron losses.
(a) L-shaped strips for core 
(b) Joints kept alternately 
(c) Staggering of stampings
Fig. 2.13
In actual transformer construction, the primary and secondary windings are interleaved to reduce 
the leakage flux. Half of each winding is placed side by side or concentrically on either limb or leg 
of the core as shown in Fig. 2.14. However, for simplicity, the two windings are shown in Fig. 2.2(a) 
located on separate limbs of the core.

92
Electrical Machines
Fig. 2.14 Placing of coils over core-type transformers
While placing these windings, an insulation layer (Bakelite former) is provided between core 
and lower winding and between the two windings. To reduce the insulation, low voltage winding is 
always placed nearer the core as shown in Fig. 2.14(a). The windings used are form wound (usually 
cylindrical in shape) and the laminations are inserted later on.
Shell-type Transformers
In such transformers, each lamination is cut in the shape of E’s and I’s as shown in Fig. 2.15. To eliminate 
high reluctance continuous joint, the laminations are placed alternately as shown in Fig. 2.16(a).
Fig. 2.15 Laminations of E and I-shapes.
In a shell-type transformer, the core has three limbs. The central limb carries whole of the flux, 
whereas the side limbs carry half of the flux. Therefore, the width of the central limb is about double 
to that of the outer limbs.

(b) 
(c)
Fig. 2.16 Placing of coils over shell-type transformer

Single-Phase Transformers 
93
Both the primary and secondary windings are placed on the central limb side by side or 
concentrically (see Fig. 2.16). The low voltage winding is placed nearer the core and high voltage 
winding is placed outside the low voltage winding to reduce the cost of insulation placed between 
core and low voltage winding. In this case also the windings are form wound is cylindrical shape 
and the core laminations are inserted later on.
The whole assembly i.e., core and winding is then usually placed in tank filled with transformer 
oil. The transformer oil provides better cooling to the transformer and acts as a dielectric medium 
between winding and outer tank which further reduces the size of outer tank of the transformer.

shown (as top view) in Fig. 2.17.

In order to avoid possible insulating damage due to movement of strips and winding, the core and 
coil of the transformer are provided with rigid mechanical bracing. Good bracing reduces vibration 
and the objectionable noise-a humming sound - during operation.

2.5 An Ideal Transformer
To understand the theory, operation and applications of a transformer, it is better to view a transformer 
first as an ideal device. For this, the following assumptions are made:
(i) Its coefficient of coupling (k) is unity.
(ii) Its primary and secondary windings are pure inductors having infinitely large value.
(iii) Its leakage flux and leakage inductances are zero.
(iv) Its self and mutual inductances are zero having no reactance or resistance.
(v) Its efficiency is 100 percent having no loss due to resistance, hysteresis or eddy current.
(vi) Its transformation ratio (or turn ratio) is equal to the ratio of its secondary to primary terminal 
voltage and also as the ratio of its primary to secondary current.
(vii) Its core has permeability (P) of infinite value.
Thus, a transformer is said to be an ideal one, if it has no ohmic resistances, moreover whole of 
the flux set-up in the core is considered to be linking with its primary and secondary turns, i.e., it 
carries no leakage flux. In other words, a transformer is said to be ideal one, when it has no losses, 
i.e., copper or iron losses. In actual practice, such a transformer cannot exist, but to begin with it 
may be considered so.
For an ideal transformer, the output must be equal to input (since it has no losses), therefore.
i.e.,
E2 l2 cos I = E1 I1 cos I
or E2 I2 = E1 I2
or

Hence, primary and secondary currents are inversely proportional to their respective turns.
Transformation ratio: The ratio of secondary to primary turns is called transformation ratio. It 
is usually devoted by letter ‘K’.
Behaviour and Phasor Diagram
Consider an ideal transformer whose secondary is open, as shown in Fig. 2.18(a). When its primary 
winding is connected to sinusoidal alternating voltage V1, a current Imag flows through it. Since 
the primary coil is pure inductive, the current Imag lags behind the applied voltage V1 by 90°. This 
current sets up alternating flux (or mutual flux Im) in the core and magnetises it. Hence it is called 
magnetising current. Flux is in phase with Imag as shown in the phasor diagram and wave diagram 
in Figs. 2.18(b) and (c), respectively. The alternating flux links with both primary and secondary 
windings. When it links with primary, it produces self-induced emf E1 in opposite direction to that 
of applied voltage V2. When it links with secondary winding, it produces mutually-induced emf 
E2 in opposite direction to that of applied voltage. Both the emfs. E1 and E2 are shown in phasor 
diagram in Fig. 2.18(b).

Power is transferred through magnetic flux.
2.6 Transformer on DC 
A transformer cannot work on DC. The basic working principle of a transformer is electro-magnetic 
induction, i.e, when flux linking with a coil changes an emf is induced in it. If DC is applied to one of 
the winding (primary) of a transformer, it will set a constant magnetic field in magnetic core. Hence 
no emf will be induced either in primary or secondary. Then electric power cannot be transformed 
from one circuit (primary) to the other (secondary).
Moreover, if rated DC voltage is applied to its primary, high current will be drawn by it since 
there is any counter (self) induced emf which limits the current. Consequently, heaving heat will be 
produced and winding insulation will burn.
Hence, a transformer cannot work on DC and it is never put-on rated DC supply.

2.7 emf Equation 
When sinusoidal voltage is applied to the primary winding of a 
transformer, a sinusoidal flux, as shown in Fig. 2.19. is set up in 
the iron core which links with primary and secondary winding.
Let, Im = Maximum value of flux in Wb;
f = supply frequency in Hz (or c/s);
N1 = No. of turns in primary;
N2 = No. of turns in secondary.
As shown in Fig. 2.19, flux changes from + Im to – Im in half

Ans. Transformer is a static device that transfers AC electrical power from one circuit to the other at the 
same frequency but the voltage level is usually changed.
Its broad area of application is in electrical power system. At generating stations it is used to step-up 
the voltage, for economic reasons, to transmit electric power and at various sub-stations it is used to 
step-down the voltage for economical and safety reasons.
Q.2. Why does a transformer have iron core?
Ans. Iron core provides an easy (low reluctance) path for the magnetic lines of force.
Q.3. Why is the transformer core laminated?
Ans. The core of a transformer is laminated in order to reduce eddy current losses.
Q.4. What do you mean by iron space factor with respect to transformer core?
Ans. The ratio of the net cross-sectional area to gross cross sectional area of the transformer core is called 
the iron space factor or simply iron factor Ki.
Ki = Ai / Agc
Q.5. When a transformer is connected to the supply, how its windings are named?
Ans. When a transformer is connected to the supply, the windings are named as primary and secondary 
winding.
The winding to which supply is connected, is known as primary winding and the winding to which load 
is connected, is known as secondary winding.
Q.6. Why circular coils are always preferred over rectangular coils for winding a transformer?
Ans. Circular coils are preferred for winding a transformer as they can be easily wound on machines on a 
former, conductors can easily be bent and winding does not bulge out due to radial forces developed 
during operation.

Ans. Sandwiched winding provides better magnetic coupling and cooling facilities in large transformers.
Q.8. Is there a definite relation between the number of turns and voltages in transformers?
Ans. Yes, voltage is directly proportional to number of turns of the winding (V v N).
Induced emf in any winding = emf/turn × No. of turns.
Q.9. What do you mean by major and minor insulation used in transformer winding?
Ans. Major insulation: The insulation in the form of cylinders provided between LV winding and core or 
between LV and HV winding is termed as major insulation.
Minor insulation: The insulation provided between individual turn and between layer is termed as minor 
insulation.
Q.10. Why arcing horns are provided across the transformer bushings?
Ans. To protect the transformer against lighting.
Q.11. What is the significance of turn ratio in a transformer?
Ans. Turn ratio determines whether a transform is to step-up or step-down the voltage.
Q.12. What is an ideal transformer?
Ans. An ideal transformer is one which has no ohmic resistance and no magnetic leakage flux.
Q.13. Can a transformer work on DC? Justify.
Ans. No, a transformer cannot work on DC. If small DC is applied to primary, constant flux is set-up in the 
core and no emf is induced in the secondary. Hence, no transformer action is possible.
Q.14. A transformer is said to be analogous to mechanical gear, why?
Ans. In mechanical gear drive, mechanical power is transferred from one shaft to the other through mechanical 
gear, whereas in transformer electrical power is transferred from one circuit to the other through 
magnetic flux.
In mechanical gear drive, there is perfect ratio between number of teeth and speeds, similarly in 
transformer there is perfect ratio between number of turns and induced emfs.
Q.15. While drawing phasor diagram of an ideal transformer, the flux vector is drawn 90° out of phase 
(lagging) to the supply voltage, why?
Ans. Under ideal conditions, transformer behaves as a pure inductive circuit; therefore, magnetising current 
or flux phasor lags behind the voltage phasor by 90°.
Q.16. Cold rolled grain oriented steel (CRGOS) is used almost exclusively in spite of its high cost, in the 
construction of transformer core, why?
Ans. It is because cold rolled grain oriented steel has excellent magnetic properties in the direction of rolling 
and hysteresis losses are very small.
Q.17. Why is the area of yoke of a transformer kept 15 to 20% more than limb?
Ans. By keeping area of yoke 15 to 20% more than the limb, the flux density in the yoke is reduced which 
reduces the iron losses of the transformer consequently reduces the winding material.

Q.18. What is the thickness of laminations used for transformer core?
Ans. Thickness of laminations varies from 0.35 to 0.5 mm.
2.8 Transformer on No-load 
A transformer is said to be on no-load when its secondary winding is kept open and no-load is 
connected across it. As such, no current flows through the secondary i.e., I2 = 0. Hence, the secondary 
winding is not causing any effect on the magnetic flux set-up in the core or on the current drawn by 
the primary. But the losses cannot be ignored. At no-load, a transformer draws a small current I0
(usually 2 to 10% of the rated value). This current has to supply the iron losses (hysteresis and eddy 
current losses) in the core and a very small amount of copper loss in the primary (the primary copper 
losses are so small as compared to core losses that they are generally neglected moreover secondary 
copper losses are zero as I2 is zero).
Therefore, current Io lags behind the voltage vector V1 by an angle I0 (called hysteresis angle of 
advance) which is less than 90º, as shown in Fig. 2.20(b). The angle of lag depends upon the losses 
in the transformer. The no-load current I0 has two components;
(i) One, Iw in phase with the applied voltage V1, called active or working component. It supplies 
the iron losses and a small primary copper losses.
(ii) The other, Imag in quadrature with the applied voltage V1, called reactive of magnetising 
component. It produces flux in the core and does not consume any power.

The equivalent circuit of a transformer at no-load is shown in Fig. 2.22. Here, R0 represents 
the exciting resistance of the transformer which carries power loss component of no-load current, 
i.e., Iw used to meet with the no-load losses in the transformer, whereas X0 represents the exciting 
reactance of the transformer which carries wattless component of no-load current, i.e., Imag used to 
set-up magnetic field in the core.
2.9 Effect of Magnetisation on No-load (Exciting) Current 
A transformer requires less magnetic material if it is operated at a higher core flux density. Therefore, 
from an economic point of view, a transformer is designed to operate in the saturating region of the 
magnetic core, although it increases the harmonics in the wave.
When the voltage applied to the primary of a transformer is sinusoidal then the mutual flux set up 
in the core is assumed to be sinusoidal. The no-load current I0 (exciting current) will be non-sinusoidal 
due to hysteresis loop which contains fundamental and all odd harmonics.
Consider the hysteresis loop of the core as shown in Fig. 2.22(a). Since I = BA and i = (Hl/N), the 
hysteresis loop is plotted in terms of flux I and current i instead of B and H so that the current required 
to produce a particular value of flux can be read directly. The wave-shape of the no-load current i0
can be found from the wave shape of sinusoidal flux and I – i characteristics (hysteresis loop) of 
the magnetic core. The graphical procedure to determine the waveform of i0 is shown in Fig. 2.22.
At point O of the flux-time curve [see Fig. 2.22(b)], the flux is zero; this corresponds to a current 
OA on the hysteresis loop [see Fig. 2.22(a)]. At point a of the flux-time curve [see Fig. 2.22(b)] I = 
aac; this corresponds to a current OB, [see Fig. 2.22(a) where OB = ‘2’]. The corresponding value of 
current I0 = ‘2’ is plotted on flux-time curve [see Fig. 2.22(b)]. In brief, the various abscissas of Fig. 2.22 
(a) are plotted as ordinates to determine the shape of the current wave on Fig. 2.22(b). The procedure 
is followed round the whole loop until a sufficient number of points are obtained. The current–time 
curve for the whole loop is plotted. For graphics, only upper half of the hysteresis loop is considered.
The ascending part of the loop is used for increasing fluxes, and the descending part for decreasing 
fluxes. The waveform of the current in Fig. 2.22(b) represents the magnetising component and the 
hysteresis component of the no-load current. It reaches its maximum at the same time as the flux

wave, but the two waves do not go through zero simultaneously. Thus, the current lags behind the 
applied voltage by an angle slightly less than 90°.
(a) Hysteresis loop of core material 
(b) Wave forms of sinusoidal flux f and exciting current i0
Fig. 2.22 Wave shape of the no-load current of a transformer.
The above current is required to be modified to account for the eddy-current loss in the core 
and the modified current is called the no-load current, I0. The corresponding current component 
apart from being is phase with applied voltage V1 is sinusoidal in nature as it balances the effect of 
sinusoidal eddy-currents caused by sinusoidal core flux. It is, therefore, seen that eddy-currents do 
not introduce any harmonic in the exciting current. However, eddy-current loss reduces the angle 
between the applied voltage V1 and the no-load current, I0.
It is seen that the waveform of the no-load current contains third, fifth and higher-order odd 
harmonics which increase rapidly if the maximum flux is taken further into saturation. However, 
the third harmonic is the predominant one. For all practical purposes harmonics higher than third 
are negligible. In no-load current, the third harmonic is nearly 5 to 10% of the fundamental at rated 
voltage. However, it may increase to 30 to 40% when the voltage rises to 150% of its rated value. 
When the load on the transformer is linear, the sinusoidal load current is so large that it swamp out 
the non-sinusoidal nature of the primary current. Therefore, for all practical purposes, the primary 
current is considered sinusoidal at all loads. 
In certain 3-phase transformer-connections, third-harmonic current cannot flow, as a result the 
magnetising current Imag is almost sinusoidal. For satisfaction of BH curve, the core flux I must 
then be non-sinusoidal; it is a flat-topped wave, as shown in Fig. 2.23(b). This can be verified by 
assuming a sinusoidal magnetising current and then finding out the flux wave shape from the flux-

magnetising current relationship, the normal magnetising curve, neglecting hysteresis component 
which is in phase with V2. Since the flux is flat-topped, the emf which is its derivative will now be 
peaky with a strong third harmonic component. The various waveforms are illustrated in Fig. 2.23.
(a) 
(b) 
(c)
Fig. 2.23 Wave shapes of magnetising currents
Under load conditions the total primary current is equal to the phasor sum of load current and 
no-load current. Since the magnitude of the load current is very large as compared to the no-load 
current, the primary current is almost sinusoidal, for all practical purposes, under load conditions.
Thus, while operating in saturated region, the magnetising current contains more percentage 
(30 to 40%) of harmonics.
Note: When a transformer is operated in the saturated region of magnetisation, the magnetising 
current wave-shape is further distorted and contains more percentage of harmonics.
However, for economic reasons, usually transformers are designed to operate in saturated region. 
A transformer will require smaller quantity of magnetic material if it is designed for saturated region.
2.10 Inrush of Magnetising Current 
When a transformer is initially energised, there is a sudden inrush of primary current. The maximum 
value attained by the flux may reach to twice the normal flux. The core is driven far into saturation 
with the result that the magnetising current has a very high peak value.
For mathematical treatment, let the applied voltage be,
v1 = V1m sin (Zt + v) 
…(2.15)
The secondary of the transformer is open circuited. Here v the angle of the voltage sinusoid at 
t = 0. Suppose for the moment we neglect core losses and primary resistance, then

Integrating the eqn. (2.19), we get,
I = –Im cos (Zt + v) + Ic
…(2.20)
where Ic is the constant of integration. Its value can be found from initial conditions at t = 0. Assume 
that when the transformer was last disconnected from the supply line, a small residual flux Ir remained 
in the core. Thus at t = 0, I = Ir.
Substituting these values in eqn. (2.20)
Ir = –Im cos v + Ic
?
IC = Ir + Im cos v
…(2.21)
Then the eqn. (2.20) becomes
I = – Im cos (Zt + v) 
+ 
Ir + Im cos D
…(2.22)
Steady-state component 
transient component
of flux i.e., Iss 
of flux i.e., IC
Equation (2.22) shows that the flux consists of two components, the steady-state component Iss
and the transient component Ic. The magnitude of the transient component
Ic = Ir + Im cos v
is a function of v, where v is the instant at which the transformer is switched on to the supply.
If the transformer is switched on at v = 0, then cos v = 1
Ic = Ir + Im
Under this condition
I = –Im cos Zt + Ir + Im
At Zt = S, 
I = – Im cos S + Ir + Im = 2Im + Ir 
…(2.23)
Thus, the core flux attains the maximum value of flux equal to (2 Im + Ir), which is over and 
above twice the normal flux as shown in Fig. 2.24. This is known as doubling effect. Consequently, 
the core goes into deep saturation. The magnetising current required for producing such a large flux 
in the core may be as large as 10 times the normal magnetising current. Sometimes the rms value 
of magnetising current may be larger than the primary rated current of the transformer as shown in 
Fig. 2.25.

Electrical Machines
Fig. 2.24 Wave shape of inrush current
Fig. 2.25 Transients due to inrush current
This inrush current may produce electromagnetic forces about 25 times the normal value. 
Therefore, the windings of large transformers are strongly braced.
Inrush current may also cause (i) improper operation of protective devices like unwarranted 
tripping of relays, (ii) momentary large voltage drops and (iii) large humming due to magnetostriction 
of the core.
To obtain no transient inrush current, Ic should be zero:
Ic = Ir + Im cos v = 0 or cos D = -f
f

m
…(2.24)
Since Ir is usually very small cos D = 0 and a
p

2 . 
…(2.25)
In other words, if the transformer is connected to the supply line near a positive or negative voltage 
maximum, the current inrush will be minimised. It is usually impractical to attempt to connect a 
transformer at a predetermined time in the voltage cycle.
Fortunately, inrush currents do not occur as might be thought. The magnitude of the inrush 
current is also less than the value calculated by purely theoretical considerations. The effects of 
other transformers in the system, load currents and capacitances all contribute to the reduction 
of transients.

Determine (a) the maximum value of flux in the core, (b) the core loss (c) the magnetising component of 
current and (d) exciting resistance and reactance. (Ans. 5.293 m Wb; 293.75 W; 4.84 A; 268 :, 69.2 :)
3. The primary and secondary of a single-phase transformer carry 500 and 100 truns, respectively. The mean 
length of the flux in the iron core is 200 cm and the joints are equivalent to an air gap of 0.1 mm. If the 
maximum value of flux density is to be 1.1 Wb/m2 when a potential difference of 2200 volt at 50 cycles 
is applied to the primary, calculate (i) the cross-sectional area of the core (ii) the secondary voltage on 
no-load (iii) the primary current and power factor on no-load.
Assume that 400 At/m are required to produce a flux density of 1.1 Wb/m2 and the corresponding iron 
loss to be 0.8 watt/kg at 50 Hz and the density of the iron to be 7.8 gm/cm3.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. Even at no-load, a transformer draws current from the mains. Why?
Ans. At no-load, what so ever current is drawn by a transformer that is used to meet with iron losses and 
to produce magnetic flux is the core.
Q.2. What do you mean by exciting resistance and exciting reactance?
Ans. At no-load, a transformer behaves as a highly inductive load connected to the system which contains 
some resistance and inductance in parallel. The resistance is called exciting resistance R0 = V1/Iw and 
reactance is called exciting reactance, X0 = V1/Imag.

Q.3. Usually, transformers are designed to operate in saturated region. Why?
Ans. If a transformer is operated in saturated region, a smaller quantity of magnetic material is required, 
therefore, for economic reasons, usually transformers are designed to operate is saturated region.
Q.4. What is doubling effect in transformer core?
Ans. When a transformer is initially energised, there is a sudden inrush of primary current. The maximum 
value attained by the flux may reach to twice the normal flux. This condition is known as doubling effect
and the core goes into deep saturation.
Q.5. Does the magnetising current of a transformer lie in-phase with the applied voltage? Justify.
Ans. No, the phasor of magnetising current lies in quadrature i.e., lags behind the applied voltage by 90º. It 
is because in pure inductive circuits, current lags behind the voltage by 90º.
Q.6. What is the effect of saturation on exciting current of transformer?
Ans. When a transformer is operated in the saturated region of magnetisation, the magnetising current 
waveshape in further distorted and contains more percentage of harmonics.
Q.7. What are the ill-effects of inrush current of transformer?
Ans. Following are the ill-effects of inrush current in a transformer:
(i) Improper operation of protective devices
(ii) Momentary large voltage drops and
(iii) Large humming due to magnetostriction effect.
2.11 Transformer on Load 
(Neglecting winding resistance and leakage flux)
When a certain load is connected across the secondary, a current I2 flows through it as shown in 
Fig. 2.27(i). The magnitude of current I2 depends upon terminal voltage V2 and impedance of the 
load. The phase angle of secondary current I2 with respect to V2 depends upon the nature of load i.e., 
whether the load is resistive, inductive or capacitive.
Fig. 2.27 (i) Circuit diagram for loaded transformer
The operation of the transformer on load is explained below with the help of number of diagrams ;
(i) When the transformer is on no-load as shown in Fig. 2.27(ii)(a) it draws no-load current I0 from 
the supply mains. The no-load current I0 produces an mmf N1 I0 which sets up flux in the core.

Single-Phase Transformers 
115
(ii) When the transformer is loaded, current I2 flows in the secondary winding. This secondary 
current I2 produces an mmf N2 I2 which sets up flux I2 in the core. As per Lenz’s law this flux 
opposes the main flux I± as shown in Fig. 2.27(ii)(b).
(iii) As I2 is set-up in opposite direction to the main flux, the resultant flux tends to decrease and 
causes the reduction of self-induced emf E1 momentarily. Thus, V1 predominates over E1 causing 
additional primary current Ic1 drawn from the supply mains. The amount of this additional current 
I1
’ is such that the original conditions i.e., flux in the core must be restored. so that V1 = E2. The 
current I1 is in phase opposition with I2 and is called primary counter balancing current. This 
additional current Ic1 produces an mmf N1 I1c which sets up flux I, in the same direction as that 
of I as shown in Fig. 2.27(ii)(c), and cancels the flux I2 set up by mmf N2 I2.
Fig. 2.27 (ii) Transformer action when load is applied to it.
Now 
N1 I1c = N2 I2 (ampere-turns balance)
?
I1c = N
N

I2 = K I2
(iv) Thus, the flux is restored to its original value as shown in Fig. 2.27(ii)(d). The total primary 
current I1 is the vector sum of current I0 and I,c i.e., I1 = I0 + I1c.
This shows that flux in the core of a transformer remains the same from no-load to full-load ; this 
is the reason why iron losses in a transformer remain the same from no-load to full-load
2.12 Phasor Diagram of a Loaded Transformer 
(Neglecting voltage drops in the windings; ampere-turns balance)
Since the voltage drops in both the windings of the transformer are neglected, therefore,
V1 = E1 and E2 = V2
While drawing the phasor diagram the following important points are to be considered.

(i) For simplicity, let the transformation ratio K = l be considered, therefore, E2 = E2.
(ii) The secondary current I2 is in phase, lags behind and leads the secondary terminal voltage V2

2.14 Mutual and Leakage Fluxes 
So far, it is assumed that when AC supply is given to the primary winding of a transformer, an 
alternating flux is set up in the core and whole of this flux links with both the primary and secondary 
windings. However, in an actual transformer, both the windings produce some flux that links only 
with the winding that produces it.
(a) Circuit diagram 
(b) Equivalent circuit
Fig. 2.31 Transformer primary and secondary winding reactance
The flux that links with both the windings of the transformer is called mutual flux and the flux 
which links only with one winding of the transformer and not to the other is called leakage flux.
The primary ampere turns produce some flux Il1 which is set up in air and links only with primary 
winding, as shown in Fig. 2.31(a), is called primary leakage flux.
Similarly, secondary ampere turns produce some flux Il2 which is set up in air and links only 
with secondary winding called is secondary leakage flux.
The primary leakage flux Il1 is proportional to the primary current I1 and secondary leakage flux 
Il2 is proportional to secondary current I2. The primary leakage flux Il1 produces self-inductance L1 
(= N1Il1/I1) which in turn produces leakage reactance X1(= 2S f L1). Similarly, secondary leakage flux 
Il2 produces leakage reactance X2 (= 2S f L2). The leakage reactance (inductive) have been shown 
external to the windings in Fig. 2.31(b).
2.15 Equivalent Reactance 
To make the calculations easy the reactances of the two winding can be transferred to any one side. 
The reactance from one side to the other is transferred in such a manner that percentage voltage drop 
remains the same when represented on either side.
Let the primary reactance X1 be transferred to the secondary and the new value of this reactance 
is X1c called equivalent reactance of primary referred to secondary, as shown in Fig. 2.32(a).

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What do you know about reactance in a transformer?
Ans. The primary leakage flux linking with its own turns produce self inductance (L1 = N1I/I1). The opposition 
offered by this inductance to the flow of primary current is called primary reactance.

Single-Phase Transformers 
123
Q.2. How leakage reactance of transformer can be reduced?
Ans. It can be reduced by reducing leakage flux i.e., by sandwiching the primary and secondary.
Q.3. When load current of a transformer increases, how does the input current adjust to meet the new 
conditions?
Ans. When load current of a transformer increases, its secondary ampere-turns (N2I2) set-up a flux in the 
core, and to counter balance this flux, primary draws extra current (I1
c) from the mains so that ampere-
turns are balanced i.e., I1cN1 = I2N2.
Q.4. How does leakage flux occur in a transformer?
Ans. When current flows through primary winding of a transformer, it produces magnetic flux. Most of the 
flux is set-up in the magnetic core, since it offers very low reluctance, and links with the secondary. 
But at the same time minute flux is set-up in air around the coil which does not link with the secondary. 
This magnetic flux is called primary leakage flux. 
Similarly, there will be secondary leakage flux.
Q.5. Explain that “The main flux in a transformer remains practically invariable under all conditions of 
load.”
Ans. When a transformer is connected to the supply at no-load a flux is set-up in the core called main flux 
(mutual flux).
When load is applied on the secondary, the secondary ampere-turns (N2I2) set-up a flux in the core in 
opposite direction to the main field which reduces the main field momentarily and hence reduces the 
self-induced emf E1. 
Instantly, primary draws extra current I1c from the main to counter balance the secondary ampere-turns, 
such that I1N1 = I2N2.
Hence, the resultant flux in the core remains the same irrespective of the load.
Q.6. “The overall reactance of transformer decreases with load.” Explain. 
(Hint: L = NI/I)
or
Why the transformers operate at poor pf when lightly loaded?
Ans. We know that total reactance of a transformer is NI/I, where I is the load current. Larger the load 
current, smaller will be the inductance or reactance (2SfL).
Hence, overall reactance of a transformer decreases with the increase in load.
That is why transformers operate at poor pf when lightly loaded.
Q.7. Does the flux in a transformer core increase with load? 
Ans. No, flux in the core of a transformer remains the same from no-load to full-load.
2.16 Actual Transformer 
An actual transformer has (i) Primary and secondary resistances R1 and R2, (ii) primary and secondary 
leakage reactances X1 and X2 (iii) iron and copper losses and (iv) exciting resistance R0 and exciting

2.17 Simplified Equivalent Circuit 
While drawing simplified circuit of a transformer, the exciting circuit (i.e., exciting resistance and 
exciting reactance) can be omitted.
The simplified equivalent circuit of a transformer is drawn by representing all the parameters of 
the transformer either on the secondary or on the primary side. The no-load current I0 is neglected 
as its value is very small as compared to full load current, therefore, I1c = I1
(i) Equivalent circuit when all the quantities are referred to secondary.
The primary resistance when referred to secondary side, its value is R1c = K2 R1 and the total or 
equivalent resistance of transformer referred to secondary, Res = R2 + R1c. Similarly, the primary 
reactance when referred to secondary side, its value is X1
c = K2X1 and the total or equivalent reactance 
of transformer referred to secondary, Xes = X2 + X1c. All the quantities when referred to the secondary 
side are shown in Fig. 2.35.

are referred to the primary side, with short circuited secondary is shown in Fig. 2.39(a). On short 
circuit the applied voltage V1is just utilised to circulate current I1(sc) in the impedance of the transformer 
referred to the primary side Zep. The phasor diagram of transformer under short circuit condition is 
shown in Fig. 2.39(b). The impedance of the transformer is quite small. Therefore, at normal voltage, 
the short circuit current I1(sc) = V
Zep

load current. This current may damage the transformer. Power and distribution transformers are 
designed for high leakage reactance so that the short circuit current is limited between 8 times (for 
large transformer) to 30 times (for small transformers) of full load current.

2.20 Voltage Regulation 
When a transformer is loaded, with a constant supply voltage, the terminal voltage changes due to 
voltage drop in the internal parameters of the transformer i.e., primary and secondary resistances 

130
Electrical Machines
and inductive reactances. The voltage drop at the terminals also depends upon the load and its power 
factor. The change in terminal voltage from no-load to full-load at constant supply voltage with 
respect to no-load voltage is known as voltage regulation of the transformer.
Let, E2 = Secondary terminal voltage at no-load.
V2 = Secondary terminal voltage at full-load.

Condition for Zero Regulation
From the above expression, we can derive the condition at which the regulation of a transformer 
becomes zero, it means when the load is thrown off, the terminal voltage remains the same, i.e.,
0 = % resistance drop × cos I2 – % reactance drop × sin I2
or % reactance drop × sin I2 = % resistance drop × cos I2

2.22 Kapp Regulation Diagram 
It is observed that the secondary terminal voltage of a transformer changes when the load on it 
changes. The change in terminal voltage (rise of fall) does not only depend upon the magnitude of 
load but it also depends upon pf of the load. For finding the voltage drop (or rise) which is further 
used to determine the regulation of the transformer, a graphical construction is employed called Kapp 
regulation diagram as proposed by late Dr. Kapp.
For drawing Kapp regulation diagram, it is necessary to know the equivalent resistance and 
reactance as referred to secondary i.e., R-esand Xes. If I2 is the secondary load current then, secondary 
terminal voltage on load, V2, is obtained by subtracting I2Res and I2Xes voltage drops vectorially from 
secondary no-load, E2.
Now, E2 is constant, hence it can be represented by a circle of constant radius OC as shown in Fig. 
2.41. This circle is known as No-load or open-circuit emf circle. For a given load OI2 represents the 
load current and is taken as the reference vector. AB represents I2Res and is parallel to vector OI2, 
BC represents I2Xes and is drawn at right angles to AB. Vector OA obviously represents secondary 
terminal voltage V2. Since I2 is constant, the drop triangle ABC remains constant in size. It is seen 

132
Electrical Machines
that end point A of V2 lies on another circle whose centre is Oc. This point Oc lies at a distance of 
I2Xes vertically below the point O and a distance of I2Res to its left as shown in Fig. 2.41.
i.e., 
OcBc = AB and OBc = BC
Fig. 2.41 Kapp regulation diagram of a transformer
To determine the voltage drop at full-load lagging pf cos I± radius OLP inclined at an angle of I
with OX. LM = I2Resand is drawn horizontal. MN= I2Xesand is drawn perpendicular to LM. Obviously 
ON is No-load voltage E2. Now ON = OP = E2. Similarly, OL is V2. The voltage drop = OP – OL = LP.
Hence percentage regulation = OP

OP

¥
=
¥
100
100
It is seen that for finding voltage drop, the drop triangle LMN need not be drawn, but simply the 
radius OLP is sufficient to determine regulation.
The diagram shows clearly how the secondary terminal voltages falls as the angle of lag increases. 
Conversely, for a leading power factor, the fall in secondary terminal voltage decreases till for an 
angle of IOR leading the fall becomes zero; hence V2 = E2. For angles greater than IOR, the secondary 
terminal voltage V2 (i.e., OS) becomes greater than E2 and voltage regulation comes out to be negative.
The Kapp diagram is very useful in determining the variation of regulation with power factor. 
But it is not so accurate since the lengths of the sides of the impedance triangle are very small as 
compared to the radii of the circles. To obtain desired accuracy, the diagram has to be drawn on a 
sufficiently large scale.

2.23 Losses in a Transformer 
The losses which occur in an actual transformer are:
(i) Core or iron losses (ii) Copper losses
(i) Core or iron losses: When AC supply is given to the primary winding of a transformer an 
alternating flux is set up in the core, therefore, hysteresis and eddy current losses occur in the 
magnetic core.
(a) Hysteresis loss: When the magnetic material is subjected to reversal of magnetic flux, it 
causes a continuous reversal of molecular magnets. This effect consumes some electric 
power which is further dissipated in the form of heat as loss. This loss is known as hysteresis 
loss. (Ph = Kh V f Bm
2.6). This loss can be minimised by using silicon steel material for the 
construction of core.
(b) Eddy current loss: Since flux in the core of a transformer is alternating, it links with the 
magnetic material of the core itself also. This induces an emf in the core and circulates 
eddy currents. Power is required to maintain these eddy currents. This power is dissipated 
in the form of heat and is known as eddy current loss (Pe = Ke V f2 t2 B2
m). This loss can be 
minimised by making the core of thin laminations.
It is already seen in article–8 that the flux set up in the core of the transformer remains constant 
from no-load to full load. Hence, iron loss is independent of the load and is known as constant 
losses.
(ii) Copper losses: Copper losses occur in both the primary and secondary windings due to their 
ohmic resistance. If I1, I2 are the primary and secondary currents and R1, R2 are the primary 
and secondary resistances, respectively.
Then, total copper losses = I R

The currents in the primary and secondary winding vary according to the load, therefore, these 
losses vary according to the load and are known as variable loss.
Magnetostriction and Its ill-effects
The property of ferromagnetic materials, due to which their dimensions are changed due to change 
of magnetic field, is called magnetostriction effect. In fact, the applied magnetic field changes the 
magnetostrictive strain until reaching its saturation value (O). This causes change in the dimensions 
of ferromagnetic materials. The effect was first identified in 1842 by James Joule while observing 
a sample of iron.
In simple terms, as per this phenomenon, if a piece of magnetic sheet steel is magnetised it 
will extend itself. When the magnetisation is taken away, it goes back to its original condition. A 
transformer is magnetically excited by an alternating voltage and current so that it becomes extended 
and contracted twice during a full cycle of magnetisation. 
Hence, when the core becomes magnetised, it expands then it contracts and expands again as 
the field is reversed. A 50 Hz transformer, therefore, expands and contracts at 100 Hz, producing a 
buzzing sound at that frequency.

Single-Phase Transformers 
143
Transformer buzzing noise (or hum) is caused by a phenomenon called magnetostriction.
Although, these extensions are only small dimensionally, and therefore cannot usually be seen by 
the naked eye. They are, however, sufficient to cause vibration resulting in a noise. 
This effect also causes losses which produce heat in ferromagnetic cores. 
Thus, the first cause of humming noise is magnetostriction, the other cause may be due to details 
of core construction, size and gauge of laminations or joints in the core
The other reasons for humming sound in a transformer may be
Loosening of laminations, mounting defects, unbalancing or insulation deterioration etc. 
Methods to control transformer noise: The transformer noise can be controlled by
using low value of flux density core, 
by proper tightening of the core by clamps, bolts etc.
by sound insulating the transformer core from tank walls.
2.24 Effects of Voltage and Frequency Variations on Iron Losses
Power transformers are not ordinarily subjected to frequency variations and usually are subject to 
only modest voltage variations, but it will be interesting to note their effects.
Variation in voltage and/or frequency affects the iron losses (hysteresis and eddy current loss) 
in a transformer. As long as the flux variations are sinusoidal, hysteresis loss (Ph), and eddy current 
loss (Pe) vary according to the following relations
Ph v f (Imax)1.6
…(2.68)
The value 2.6 is an arbitrary value which lies between 1.5 and 2.5 depending on the grade of iron 
used in transformer core
and 
Pe v f 2 (Imax)2
…(2.69)
If the transformer is operated with the frequency and voltage changing in the same proportion, 
the flux density will remain unchanged as obvious from equation (E = 4.44 Bm Ai Nf or Bm
= 
E
A Nf
i
4 44
.
or Bm v V
f ) and apparently the no-load current will also remain unaffected.
The transformer can be operated safely at frequency less than rated one with correspondingly 
reduced voltage. In this case iron losses will be reduced. But if the transformer is operated with 
increased voltage and frequency in the same proportion, the core losses may increase to a large 
extent which may not be tolerated. Increase in frequency with constant supply voltage will cause 
reduction in hysteresis loss and leave the eddy current losses unaffected. However, some increase 
in voltage could, therefore, be tolerated at higher frequencies, but exactly how much depends on 
the relative magnitude of the hysteresis and eddy current losses and the grade of iron used in the 
transformer core.
Example 2.28

(i) the losses on 50 Hz for the same supply voltage and current. (ii) the output at 50 Hz for the same 
total losses as on 40 Hz.

2.27 Efficiency vs Load 
The variation of efficiency with load is shown in Fig. 2.43 which likewise shows the constant and 
variable components of the total loss. It has been pointed out that with constant voltage the mutual 
flux of the transformer is practically constant from no-load to full load (maximum variation is from 
1 to 3%). The core or iron loss is, therefore, considered constant regardless of load. Copper loss varies 
as the square of the load current or kVA output. The variations in copper loss with the increase in 
load current (or kVA) is shown in Fig. 2.43. The efficiency vs load curve as deduced from these is 
also shown in the Fig. 2.43. From the efficiency–load curve shown in Fig. 2.43 it is obvious that the 
efficiency is very high even at light load, as low as 10% of rated load. The efficiency is practically 
constant from about 20% rated load to about 20% overload. At light loads the efficiency is poor because 
of constant iron loss, whereas at high loads the efficiency falls off due to increase in copper loss as 
the square of load. From Fig. 2.43 it is also obvious that the transformer efficiency is maximum at 
the point of intersection of copper loss and iron loss curves i.e., when copper loss equals iron loss.
Imp. The intersection of copper loss curve and iron loss curve ‘A’ gives the point of maximum 
efficiency. It will be seen that the efficiency changes very little over the greater part of the operating 
range.

2.29 All-day Efficiency 
The efficiency discussed so far is the ordinary or commercial efficiency which is given by the ratio 
of output power to input power i.e.,
Commercial efficiency, K = output power
input power
The load on certain transformers fluctuates throughout the day. The distribution transformers 
are energised for 24 hours, but they deliver very light loads for major portion of the day. Thus iron 
losses occur for whole day but copper losses occur only when the transformer is loaded. Hence, the 
performance of such transformers cannot be judged by the commercial efficiency, but it can be judged 
by all-day efficiency also known as operational efficiency or energy efficiency which is computed 
on the basis of energy consumed during a period of 24 hours.
The all-day efficiency is defined as the ratio of output in kWh (or Wh) to the input in kWh (or 
Wh) of a transformer over 24 hours.
?
All-day efficiency = Kall-day = output in

kWh
kWh
…(2.76) (for 24 hours)
To find this all-day efficiency, we have to know the load cycle on the transformer. 
Example 2.39
A 20 kVA transformer on domestic load, which can be taken as of unity power factor, has a full load 
efficiency of 94.3%, the copper loss then being twice the iron loss. Calculate its all-day efficiency 
on the following daily cycle; no-load for 10 hours, half load for 8 hours and full load for 6 hours.

Full load output= 20 × 1 = 20 kW
Full load input = output

= 20·986 kW
Total losses, Pi + Pc = 20.986 – 20 = 0·986 kW
Now Pc= 2 Pi (given) Pi + 2 Pi = 0·986 kW
Or 
Iron losses, Pi = 0·3287 kW
Full load copper losses = 2 × 0·3287 = 0·6574 kW
kWh output in 24 hours = 1
2 × 20 × 8 +1 × 20 × 6 = 200 kWh
Iron losses for 24 hours = 0·3287 × 24 = 7·89 kWh
Copper losses for 24 hours = cu. losses for 8 hrs at 1

hrs. What will be the all-day efficiency of the transformer? 
(Ans. 94·5%)
Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What are no-load losses occurring in the transformer?
Ans. Iron losses which are also known as magnetic losses or core losses. These losses include hysteresis 
loss and eddy current loss.
Q.2. Why is efficiency of a transformer high as compared to other electrical machines?
Ans. Transformer is a static device i.e., it has no rotating part, therefore, it is free of mechanical losses. 
Hence, it operates at higher efficiency in comparison to other electrical machines.
Q.3. Define efficiency and all-day efficiency of a transformer.
Ans. The ratio of power output (in kW) to power input (in kW) is called efficiency or commercial efficiency 
of a transformer, i.e.,
K = Output in kW
input in kW
The ratio of output energy (in kWh) to the input energy (in kWh) in a day of a transformer is called its 
all-day efficiency.
Kall-day = Output in kWh in a day
Input in kWh in a day
Q.4. Are transformers normally considered to be efficient devices?
Ans. Yes, normally transformers are considered as efficient devices.
Q.5. Why is the efficiency of a transformer high as much as 96%?
Ans. It is because transformers do not have rotating parts and mechanical losses do not occur.
Q.6. How can eddy current loss be reduced?
Ans. Eddy current loss can be reduced by laminating the core (0.35 mm to 0.5 mm thickness) and each 
lamination must be insulated from the other by an insulating layer (varnish).
Q.7. How may the iron loss be reduced to a minimum?
Ans. Iron loss can be minimised by using steel having sufficient quantity of silicon, now-a-days cold rolled 
grain oriented steel (CRGOS) is used, and the core is laminated, each lamination has a thickness 0.35 
to 0.5 mm and insulated from each other.
Q.8. In a transformer, buzzing noise cannot be avoided. Justify.
Ans. Since magnetostriction phenomenon cannot be avoided, the buzzing noise produced by a transformer 
cannot be avoided.

2.30 Transformer Tests 
All the transformers are tested before placing them in the field. By performing these tests, we can 
determine the parameters of a transformer to compute its performance characteristics (like voltage 
regulation and efficiency etc.).
Large transformers cannot be tested by direct loading because of the following reasons:
(i) It is almost impossible to arrange such a large load required for direct loading.
(ii) While performing test by direct loading, there is huge power wastage.
(iii) It is very inconvenient to handle the power equipment.
Therefore, to furnish the required information open circuit and short circuit tests are conducted 
conveniently without actually loading the transformer.
The other important tests which are conducted on a transformer are polarity test voltage ratio test 
and Back-to-back test.
2.31 Polarity Test 
Polarity test is performed to determine the terminals with same instantaneous polarity of the two 
windings when terminals are not being marked. The relative polarities of the primary and secondary 
terminals are required to be known for
(i) interconnecting two or more transformers in parallel.
(ii) connecting three single-phase transformers while doing poly-phase transformation of power.
(iii) connecting windings of the same transformer in parallel or series.
For determining the relative polarity of the two windings of a transformer, the two winding are 
connected in series and a voltmeter is connected across them as shown in Fig. 2.45. One of the 
winding (preferably HV winding) is excited from a suitable AC voltage (less than rated value). If the 
polarities of the windings are as marked on the diagram, then the windings will have a subtractive 
polarity and the voltmeter will read the difference of E1 and E2 (i.e., E1 – E2). If the voltmeter reads 
E1 + E2 the polarity marking of one of the windings must be reversed.
Fig. 2.45 Circuit diagram for polarity test

Single-Phase Transformers 
159
While performing polarity test, subtractive polarity method is preferred over additive polarity 
method, because in this case, the voltage between A and Ac or that between B and Bc is reduced. The 
leads connected between these terminals and two windings are not subjected to high voltage stresses. 
Whereas, in case of additive polarity the two windings and leads connected between AAc and BBc
are subjected to high voltage stresses.
When the transformer is placed in the field, it may not be convenient to perform the above test 
to check the polarity. In such cases, polarity may be checked by using a battery, a switch and a DC 
voltmeter (PMMC type) which are connected in the circuit as shown in Fig. 2.46. When switch (S) 
is closed, the primary current increases which increases the flux linkages with both the windings 
inducing emf in them. The positive polarity of this induced emf in the primary is at the end to which 
battery is connected. The end of secondary which simultaneously acquires positive polarity which 
is indicated by the deflection in the (PMMC) voltmeter. If deflection does not occur, then open the 
switch. At this instant, if deflection occurs the polarity of secondary is opposite.
Fig. 2.46 Polarity test using PMMC
2.32 Voltage Ratio Test 
The true voltage ratio is based upon turn-ratio of the two windings of a transformer. In case the two 
voltages are measured at no-load, their ratio is almost equal to the true value. Similarly, if the primary 
and secondary currents are measured on short circuit, their ratio gives true-ratio particularly if the 
transformer has little leakage flux and low core reluctance.voltage ratio

2.33 Open-circuit or No-load Test 
This test is carried out at rated voltage to determine the no-load loss or core loss or iron loss. It is 
also used to determine no-load current I0 which is helpful in finding the no-load parameters i.e., 
exciting resistance R0 and exciting reactance X0 of the transformer.
Usually, this test is performed on low voltage side of the transformer, i.e., all the measuring 
instruments such as voltage (V), wattmeter (W) and ammeter (A) are connected in low-voltage side 
(say primary). The primary winding is then connected to the normal rated voltage V1 and frequency 
as given on the name plate of the transformer. The secondary side is kept open or connected to a 
voltmeter V’ as shown in Fig. 2.47(a).

160
Electrical Machines
Since the secondary (high voltage winding) is open circuited, the current drawn by the primary is 
called no-load current I0 measured by the ammeter A. The value of no-load current I0 is very small 
usually 2 to 10% of the rated full-load current. Thus, the copper loss in the primary is negligibly 
small and no copper loss occurs in the secondary as it is open. Therefore, wattmeter reading W0 only 
represents the core or iron losses for all practical purposes. These core losses are constant at all loads. 
The voltmeter Vc if connected on the secondary side measures the secondary induced voltage V2.
The ratio of voltmeter readings, V

2.34 Separation of Hysteresis and Eddy Current Losses

2.35 Short Circuit Test 
This test is carried out to determine the following:
(i) Copper losses at full load (or at any desired load). These losses are required for the calculations 
of efficiency of the transformer.
(ii) Equivalent impedance (Zes or Zep), resistance (Res or Rep) and leakage reactance (Xes or Xep) of the 
transformer referred to the winding in which the measuring instruments are connected. Knowing 
equivalent resistance and reactance, the voltage drop in the transformer can be calculated and 
hence regulation of transformer is determined.
This test is usually carried out on the high-voltage side of the transformer i.e., a wattmeter W, 
voltmeter V and an ammeter A are connected in high-voltage* winding (say secondary). The other 
winding (primary) is then short circuited by a thick strip or by connecting an ammeter Ac across the 
terminals as shown in Fig. 2.52. A low voltage at normal frequency is applied to the high voltage 
winding with the help of on autotransformer so that full-load current flows in both the windings, 
measured by ammeters A and Ac. Low voltage is essential, failing which an excessive current will 
flow in both the windings which may damage them.
Since a low voltage (usually 5 to 10% of normal rated voltage) is applied to the transformer winding, 
therefore, the flux set up in the core is very small about 1
30 th  to 1
8 th  of normal flux. The iron losses 
are negligibly small due to low value of flux as these losses are approximately proportional to the 
square of the flux. Hence, wattmeter reading Wc only represents the copper losses in the transformer 
windings for all practical purposes. The applied voltage V2sc is measured by the voltmeter V which 
circulates the current I2sc (usually full load current) in the impedance Zes of the transformer to the 
side in which instruments are connected as shown in Fig. 2.52.

* For convenience and better results, short circuit test is performed on HV side of the transformer; to make it 
clear, let us consider an example.
To perform short circuit test about 5 percent of rated voltage is required. For a 250 kVA, 2500/250V 
transformers, if short circuit test is performed on HV side, voltage required for the test is 2500

After calculating Res and Xes, the voltage regulation of the transformer can be determined at any 
load and power factor.
2.36 Back-to-back Test 
(Sumpner’s Test or Regenerative Test)
Although efficiency and regulation of a transformer can be determined by performing open circuit and 
short circuit test but to test temperature rise, it is necessary to conduct a full-load test on a transformer. 
For small transformers, full-load test can be conveniently conducted, but for large transformers 
full-load test is very difficult. A suitable load to absorb full-load power of a large transformer may 
not be easily available. It will also be very expensive as a large amount of energy will be wasted in 
the load during the test. Therefore, large transformers can be tested for determining the maximum 
temperature rise by back-to-back test. This test is also called the Regenerative test or Sumpner’s test.
The back-to-back test on single-phase transformers requires two identical transformers. Fig. 2.53, 
shows the circuit diagram for the back-to-back test on two identical single-phase transformers Tr1
and Tr2 . The primary windings of the two transformers are connected in parallel and supplied at 
rated voltage and rated frequency. A voltmeter, an ammeter and a wattmeter are connected to the 
input side as shown in Fig. 2.53.
Fig. 2.53 Back-to-back test on two identical single-phase transformers
The secondary windings are connected in series with their polarities in phase opposition, which 
can be checked by the voltmeter V2. The range of this voltmeter should be double the rated voltage of 
either transformer secondary. In order to check that the secondary windings are connected in series 

168
Electrical Machines
opposition, any two terminals (say B and C) are joined together and the voltage is measured between 
the remaining terminals A and D. If the voltmeter V2 reads zero, the two secondary windings are in 
series opposition and terminals A and D are used for test. If the voltmeter reads a value approximately 
equal to twice the rated secondary voltage of either transformer, then the secondary windings are 
acting in the same direction. Then terminals A and C are joined and the terminals B and D are used 
for the test.
If the primary circuit is now closed, the total voltage across the two secondary windings in series 
will be zero. There will be no current in the secondary windings. The transformers will behave as 
if their secondary windings are open circuited. Hence, the reading of wattmeter W1 gives the iron 
losses of both the transformers.
A small voltage is injected in the secondary circuit by a regulating transformer TR excited by the 
main supply. The magnitude of the injected voltage is adjusted till the ammeter A2 reads full-load 
secondary current. The secondary current produces full-load current to flow through the primary 
windings. This current will follow a circulatory path through the main bus-bars as shown by dotted 
line in Fig. 2.53. The reading of wattmeter W2 will not be affected by this current. Thus, wattmeter 
W2 gives the full-load copper losses of the two transformers.
The ammeter A1 gives total no-load current of the two transformers. Thus, in this method we 
have loaded the two transformers to full load but the power taken from the supply is that necessary 
to supply the losses of both transformers.
The temperature rise of the transformers can be determined by operating these transformers back-
to-back for a long time, say 48 hour, and measuring the temperature of the oil at periodic intervals 
of time, say every one hour.
Example 2.46 
Open-circuit, and short-circuit tests were conducted on a 50 kVA, 6 360/240 V, 50 Hz, single-phase 
transformer in order to find its efficiency. The observations during these tests are:

Electrical Machines
Open Circuit Test: 8 kV, 61.9 A and 136 kW
Short Circuit Test: 650 V, 6.25 kA and 103 kW.
Determine the efficiency and voltage regulation if the transformer is operating at rated voltage and 
a load of 0.9 p.f. lagging.
Solution:
Here, rating of transformer = 50 MVA = 50 × 106 VA
V1 = 8 kV; V2 = 78 kV; Load p.f., cos I = 0.9 lag
Open circuit (LV side): 
V1 = 8 kV; I0 = 61.9 A; W0 = 136 kW
Short circuit test (LV side): 
V1(sc) = 650 V; I1(sc) = 6.25 kA; Wc = 103 kW
From open circuit test, iron losses of the transformer,

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. Why short circuit test is performed on high voltage side of transformer?
Ans. For convenience and better results, short circuit test is performed on HV side of a transformer.
Q.2. Why are iron losses or core losses assumed to remain constant in a power transformer from no-
load to full-load?
Ans. The magnetic flux set-up in the core remains the same from no-load to full-load, hence iron losses 
remain constant from no-load to full-load.

2.37 Classification of Transformers 
The transformers are often classified according to their applications. Following are the important 
types of transformers:
(i) Power Transformers: These transformers are used to step up the voltage at the generating 
station for transmission purposes and then to step down the voltage at the receiving stations. 
These transformers are of large capacity (generally above 500 kVA). These transformers usually 
operate at high average load, which would cause continuous capacity copper loss, thus affecting 
their efficiency. To have minimum losses during 24 hours, such transformers are designed with 
low copper losses.
(ii) Distribution Transformers: These transformers are installed at the distribution sub-stations 
to step down the voltage. These transformers are continuously energised causing the iron losses 
for all the 24 hours, Generally the load on these transformers fluctuate from no-load to full 
load during this period. To obtain high efficiency, such transformers are designed with low iron 
losses.
(iii) Instrument Transformers: To measure high voltages and currents in power system potential 
transformer (P.T.) and current transformer (C.T.) are used, respectively. The potential transformers 
are used to decrease the voltage and current transformers are used to decrease the current up 
to measurable value. These are also used with protective devices.
(iv) Testing transformers: These transformers are used to step up voltage to a very high value for 
carrying out the tests under high voltage, e.g., for testing the dielectric strength of transformer 
oil.
(v) Special purpose transformer: The transformers may be designed to serve special purposes, 
these may be used with furnaces, rectifiers, welding sets etc.
(vi) Auto-transformers: These are single winding transformers used to step down the voltages for 
starting of large three-phase squirrel cage induction motors.
(vii) Isolation transformer: These transformers are used only to isolate (electrically) the electronic 
circuits from the main electrical lines, therefore, their transformation ratio is usually one.
(viii) Impedance matching transformer: These transformers are used at the output stage of the 
amplifier for impedance matching to obtain maximum output from the amplifiers.
2.38 Parallel Operation of Transformers 
When the primaries and secondaries of the two or more transformers are connected separately to 
the same incoming and outgoing lines to share the load, the transformers are said to be connected 
in parallel.
The two single-phase transformers A and B are placed in parallel as shown in Fig. 2.56. Here 
the primary windings of the two transformers are joined to the supply bus-bars and the secondary 
windings are joined to the load through load bus-bars. Under this conditions;
V1 = Primary applied voltage
V2 = V = Secondary load voltage.

182
Electrical Machines
Fig. 2.56 Parallel operation of two one-phase transformers (circuit diagram)
2.39 Necessity of Parallel Operation 
The following are the reasons for which transformers are put in parallel.
(i) When the load on the transmission lines increases beyond the capacity of the installed 
transformer. To overcome this problem one way is to replace the existing transformer with the 
new one having larger capacity (this is called augmentation of transformer) and the other way 
is to place one more transformer is parallel with the existing one to share the load. The cost of 
replacing the transformer is much more than placing another one in parallel with the existing 
one.
Hence, it is desirable to place another transformer is parallel when the electrical load on the 
existing transformer increases beyond its rated capacity.
(ii) Sometimes, the amount of power to be transformed is so high that it is not possible to build a 
single unit of that capacity, then we have to place two or more transformers in parallel.
Hence, parallel operation of transformers is necessary when the amount of power to be 
transformed is much more than that which can be handled by single unit (transformer).
(iii) At the grid sub stations, spare transformers are always necessary to insure the continuity of 
supply in case of breakdown. The size of spare transformer depends upon the size of transformers 
placed at the grid sub-station. Therefore, it is desirable to place transformers of smaller capacity 
in parallel to transform the given load which in turn reduces the size of the spare transformer.
Hence, it is desirable to do parallel operation of transformers if we want to keep the spare 
transformer of smaller size.
2.40 Conditions for Parallel Operation of One-phase Transformers
The following conditions are to be fulfilled if two or more transformers are to be operated successfully 
in parallel to deliver a common load.
(i) Both the transformers should have same transformation ratio i.e., the voltage ratings of both 
primaries and secondaries must be identical.

Single-Phase Transformers 
183
If this condition is not exactly fulfilled i.e., if the two transformers ‘A’ and ‘B’ have slight 
difference in their voltage or transformation ratios, even then parallel operation is possible. 
Since the transformation ratios are unequal, primary applied voltage being equal, the induced 
emfs in the secondary windings will not be equal. Due to this inequality of induced emfs in the 
secondary windings, there will be, even at no-load, some circulating current flowing from one 
secondary winding (having higher induced emf) to the other secondary windings (having lower 
induced emf). In other words, there will be circulating currents between the secondary windings 
and therefore between primary windings also when the secondary terminals are connected in 
parallel. The impedance of transformers is small, so that a small percentage voltage difference 
may be sufficient to circulate a considerable current and cause additional I2 R loss. When load is 
applied on the secondary side of such a transformer, the unequal loading conditions will occur 
due to circulating current. Hence, it may be impossible to take the combined full load kVA output 
from the parallel connected group without one of the transformers becoming excessively hot. 
For satisfactory parallel operation the circulating current should not exceed 10% of the normal 
load current.
(ii) Both the transformers should have the same percentage impedance.
If this condition is not exactly fulfilled, i.e., the impedance triangles at the rated kVA’s are not 
identical in shape and size, even then parallel operation will be possible, but the power factors 
at which the transformers operate will differ from the power factor of the load. Therefore, in 
this case the transformers will not share the load in proportion to their kVA ratings.
(iii) Both the transformers must have the same polarity i.e., both the transformers must be properly 
connected with regard to their polarities.
If this condition is not observed, the emfs in the secondary windings of the transformers which 
are parallel with incorrect polarity will act together in the local secondary circuits and produce 
the effect equivalent to a dead short circuit.
Polarity Check: Referring to Fig. 2.56 we have two transformers A and B with terminals 
of unknown polarity. Primary terminals T1 and T2 are connected to the primary bus bars as 
usual. On the secondary side, one of the terminals of the transformer A is joined temporarily 
to a terminal of transformers B and the other terminals of A and B transformers are connected 
through the Double range voltmeter i.e., the two secondary windings and the double range 
voltage form a closed series circuit. If the double range voltmeter reads zero, when the primary 
windings are energised, then the terminal which are temporarily joined are of correct polarity 
i.e., like polarity, but if the double range voltmeter reads twice the normal secondary voltage, 
these terminals are of incorrect polarity i.e., unlike polarity.
(iv) In case of 3-phase transformers, the two transformers must have the same phase-sequence i.e.,
the transformers must be properly connected with regard to their phase-sequence.
If this condition is not observed, it will have the same effect as discussed above when the polarity 
of two single phase transformers is not the same. Phase-sequence is also checked as discussed 
above.
(v) In case of 3-phase transformers, the two transformers must have the connections so that 
there should not be any phase difference between the secondary line voltages i.e., a delta-

184
Electrical Machines
star connected transformer should not be connected with a delta-delta or star-star connected 
transformer.
If this condition is not fulfilled, it will cause a heavy circulating current which may damage 
the transformers.
2.41 Load Sharing between Two Transformers Connected in Parallel 
The load sharing between two transformers connected in parallel depends upon the various conditions 
are as discussed below:
(i) When the two transformers have the same voltage ratios and their impedance voltage 
triangles are identical in size and shape.
The condition for which the transformers have the same voltage ratio and impedance voltage 
triangles is known ideal condition or ideal case. Let E be the no-load secondary voltage of 
each transformer and V the terminal voltage. Figure 2.57 shows the equivalent circuit in which 
I1 and I2 are the currents supplied by the transformers A and B, respectively. I be the total load 
current lagging behind the voltage V by an angle I. The impedance voltage triangles of the 
individual transformers are identical in shape and size and are therefore, represented by a single 
triangle VAB with the resistance drop (side VA) parallel to the load current vector OI as shown 
in Fig. 2.58. The current I1 and I2 in the individual transformers are both in phase with the load 
current I and are inversely proportional to their respective impedances.

(ii) When the two transformers have the same voltage ratios but different voltage triangles
In this case, no-load voltages of both secondary are equal in magnitude as well as in phase i.e., 
there is no phase difference between E1 and E2 which will only be possible if the magnetising 
currents of the two transformers are not very different from each other or nearly the same. Under 
these conditions, both sides of two transformers can be connected in parallel, and no current 
will circulate between them on no-load.
Figure 2.59 shows the equivalent circuit diagram when the parallel connected transformers 
are sharing the load current I, and it represents two impedances in parallel. The impedance 
voltage triangle is now represented by two triangles VAB, VAc B having common hypotenuse 
VB as shown in Fig. 2.60. The resistance drop sides of the triangles VA, VAc are parallel to the 
phasors OI1 and OI2 of the respective secondary currents. The sum of these vectors OI1 and 
OI2 represents the load current OI.

as well as in direction.
(iii) When the two transformers have different voltage ratio and different voltage triangles.
In this case, the voltage ratios or transformation ratios of the two transformers are different. It 
means, these no-load secondary voltages are unequal.

The equivalent circuit and vector diagram are also shown in Fig. 2.61 and Fig. 2.62, respectively.

The two equations (2.110) and (2.111) then give the values of secondary currents shared by the 
two transformers. By the division of transformation ratio i.e.,K and by addition (if not negligible) 
of the no-load current the primary current may be obtained. Usually E1 and E2 have the same 
phase (as assumed above) but there may be some phase difference between the two due to some

delta 3-phase transformers.

…(2.113)
The physical interpretation of second term in equations (2.112) and (2.113) is that it represents 
the cross-current (circulating current) between the secondaries. The first term shows how the 
actual load current divides between the loads. If E1 = E 2 , the ratios of the currents are inversely 
as the impedances (Numerical values).
Note: In the above case, it is more convenient to work with Numerical values of impedances 
instead of % values.
Example 2.55
A load of 500 A, at 0·8 power (lagging), at a terminal voltage of 400 V is supplied bytwo transformers 
are connected in parallel. The equivalent impedances of the two transformers referred to the 
secondary sides are (2 + j3) ohm and (2.5 + j5) ohm, respectively. Calculate the current and kVA 
supplied by each transformer and the power factor at which they operate.

Two single-phase transformers connected in parallel supply a load of 1000 A at 0·8 p.f. lagging. For 
each transformer, the secondary emf on open circuit is 3300 V and the total leakage impedances in

Example 2.60
A 500 kVA transformer is connected in parallel with a 150 kVA transformer and is supplying a load of 
750 kVA at 0.8 pf lagging. Their open circuit voltages are 405 V and 415 V, respectively. Transformer 
A has 1% resistance and 5% reactance and transformer B has 1.5% resistance and 4% reactance. 
Find (a) cross-current in the secondaries on no-load and (b) the load shared by each transformer.
Solution:
It is more convenient to work with ohmic impedances and for that purpose, we will convert percentage 
values into Numerical values by assuming 400 volt as the terminal voltage (i.e., V1 = V2 = 400 V, this 
value is arbitrary but this assumption will not introduce appreciable error).

2.42 Auto-transformer
A transformer, in which a part of the winding is common to both the primary and secondary circuits, 
is called an auto-transformer. In a two winding transformer, primary and secondary windings are 
electrically isolated, but in an auto-transformer the two windings are not electrically isolated rather 
a section of the same winding acts as secondary or primary of the transformer.
Construction
The core of an auto-transformer may be rectangular [Fig. 2.63(a)] or circular ring-type [see Fig. 
2.64(a)] in shape. A single winding is wound around one or two limbs of the rectangular core as 
shown in Fig. 2.63(b) or it is wound over the ring as shown in Fig. 2.64(b). Terminal ‘B’ is taken as a 
common point from which one terminal for primary and one terminal of the secondary is taken out. 
The second terminal of the secondary is connected to point ‘C’ which may be fixed or movable as 
shown in Figs. 2.63(b) and 2.64(b). The number of turns between AB are taken as N1 and the number 
of turns between BC are taken as N2 as shown in Figs. 2.63(c) and 2.64(c). Thus, one section of the 
same winding acts as a primary and the other section of the same winding acts as a secondary. 
When the number of secondary turns N2 is less then the primary turns N1 (i.e., N2 < N1) as shown 
in Fig. 2.63(c) and 64(c), the auto-transformer works as step-down transformer, whereas, it works as 
a step-up transformer if number of secondary turns N2 is more than primary turns N1 as shown in 
Figs. 2.63(d) and 2.64(d).

The pictorial view of a single-phase auto-transformer used in labs is shown in Figs. 2.64(e and 
f). Here, point C is attached to a movable arm which carries a carbon brush. The brush moves over 
number of turns wound over a circular laminated core and its position determines the output voltage.
Working
When AC voltage V1 is applied to winding AB, an exciting current starts flowing through the full 
winding AB if the internal impedance drop is neglected, then the voltage per turn in winding AB is 
V1/N1 and, therefore, the voltage across BC is (V1/N1) N2.
When switch S is closed, a current I2 starts flowing through the load and current I1 is drawn from 
the source. Neglecting losses,
Input power = Output power
or 
V1I1 cos I1 = V2I2 cos I2
Fig. 2.65 Circuit for single-phase auto-transformer.
If internal (or leakage) impedance drops and losses are neglected, then
cos I1 = cos I2
Hence 
V1I1 = V2I2

Here K is less than unity. The expression is identical to a two winding transformer.
Let at any instant the exciting current flows from A to B and it establishes a working mmf directed 
vertically upward in the core. When switch S is closed, the current in winding BC must flow from 
B to C, in order to create an mmf opposing the exciting or working mmf, as per Lenz’s law. Since 
the working mmf in a transformer remains constant at its no-load value, the primary must draw 
additional current I1 from the source, in order to neutralise the effect of current IBC. In winding AB, 

198
Electrical Machines
I1 flows from A to B while in winding BC, I2 flows from B to C. Therefore, the current in winding 
BC is I1 from C to B and I2 from B to C. Here the current I2 is greater than I1 (because V2 < V1) and 
their mmfs. are opposing each other at every instant, therefore,
IBC = I2 – I1.
mmf of winding 
AC = I1 (N1 – N2) = I1N1 – I1N2
= I2N2 – I1N2 = (I2 – I1) N2
[… I1N1 = I2N2]
= IBCN2
= mmf of winding CB.
It is, therefore, seen that the transformer action takes place between winding, section AC and 
winding section BC. In other words, the volt-amperes across winding AC are transferred by transformer 
action to the load connected across winding BC.

2.43 Auto-transformer vs Potential Divider 
At first sight, an auto-transformer appears to be similar to a resistance potential divider. But this is 
not so, as described below.
(i) A resistive potential divider can’t step up the voltage, whereas it is possible in an auto-transformer.
(ii) The potential divider has more losses and is, therefore, less efficient.
(iii) In a potential divider, almost entire power to load flows by conduction, whereas in auto-
transformer, a part of the power is conducted and the rest is transferred to load by transformer 
action.
(iv) In a potential divider, the input current, must always be more than the output current, this is 
not so in an auto-transformer. If the output voltage in auto-transformer is less than the input 
voltage, the load current is more than the input current.
2.44 Saving of Copper in an Auto-transformer 
Volume, and hence weight of copper (or aluminium), is proportional to the length and area of
X-section of the conductor. The length of conductor is proportional to number of turns whereas area of 
X-section is proportional to the current flowing through it. Hence the weight of copper is proportional 
to the product of current and number of turns.
Now, with reference to Fig. 2.66(a), weight of copper required in an auto-transformer.
Wta = weight of Cu in section AC + weight of Cu in section CB
?
Wta f I1 (N1 – N2) + (I2 – I1) N2 f I1 N1 + I2 N2 – 2 I1 N2 
…(2.120)

If an ordinary two winding transformer is to perform the same duty, then with reference to 
Fig. 2.66(b). Total weight of copper required in the ordinary transformer.

or

…(2.122)
Saving of copper affected by using an auto-transformer
= wt. of cu required in an ordinary transformer – wt. of copper required in an auto-transformer.
= Wt0 – Wta = Wt0 – (1 – K) Wt0 = K × Wt0
?
Saving = K × Wt. of copper required for two winding transformer
Hence, saving in copper increases as the transformation ratio approaches to unity, therefore, auto 
transformers are used when K in nearly equal to unity.
2.45 Advantages of Auto-transformer over Two-winding Transformer
1. Quantity of conducting material required is less. The quantity of conducting material required 
for an auto-transformer having same rating as that of an ordinary two winding transformer is 
only (1 – K) times, i.e., Quantity of conducting material required for auto-transformer = (1 – K) 
quantity of conducting material required for an ordinary two winding transformer. Thus, the 
cost of auto-transformer is less as compared to two winding transformer of the same rating.
2. Quantity of magnetic material required is less. During designing, the window dimensions are 
decided from the consideration of insulation and conductor material. For an auto-transformer, a 
reduction in conductor material means lower window area and, therefore, smaller core length is 
needed. It shows that for the same core area, the weight of auto-transformer core is less. Hence, 
there is further saving in core material. Thus auto-transformer is more economical than a two 
winding transformer when K approaches to unity.
3. Operate at higher efficiency. Owing to the reduction in conductor and core materials, the ohmic 
losses in conductor and the core loss are lowered. Consequently, an auto-transformer has higher 
efficiency than a two-winding transformer of the same rating.
4. Operate at better voltage regulation. Reduction in the conductor material means lower value of 
ohmic resistance. A part of the winding being common, leakage flux or the leakage reactance 
is less. In other words, an auto-transformer has lower value of leakage impedance and hence 
auto-transformer has lower value of leakage impedance and has better voltage regulation than 
a two-winding transformer of the same output.
2.46 Disadvantages of Auto-transformers 
Although auto-transformers have less cost, better regulation and low losses as compared to ordinary 
two winding transformer of same rating. But still they are not widely used due to one major 

Single-Phase Transformers 
201
disadvantage that the secondary winding is not insulated from the primary. If an auto transformer 
is used to supply low voltage from a high voltage and there is a break in the secondary winding, full 
primary voltage comes across the secondary terminals which may be dangerous to the operator 
and equipment (load). Therefore, it is advisable not to use an auto transformer for interconnecting 
high voltage and low voltage system. Their use is only limited to the places where slight variation of 
output voltage from the input voltage is required. The other disadvantages are;
x The effective per-unit impedance of an autotransformer is smaller compared to a two-winding 
transformer. The reduced internal impedance results in a larger short-circuit (fault) current.
x In an autotransformer there is a loss of isolation between input and output circuits. This is 
particularly important in three-phase transformers where one may wish to use a different 
winding and earthing arrangement on each side of the transformer.
2.47 Phasor Diagram of an Auto-transformer 
Considering a step-down auto-transformer shown in Fig. 2.67.
Fig. 2.67(a,b) Circuit for auto-transformer
Let 
V1 = applied voltage, acting downwards (from A to B)
I2 = supplied current flows through winding AB (A to B)
I2 = load current which also flows through section BC (B to C)
I2 – I1 = resultant current in section BC (B to C)
I = flux produced in the core linking with winding.
An emf is induced in both the sections of the winding i.e., ECA and EBC which act in opposite 
direction to the applied voltage to balance it.
The phasor diagram of an auto-transformer is shown in Fig. 2.67(c), where V2 is the voltage applied 
across the load represented by phasor OA. Let the load is inductive, then current drawn by the load 
I2 lags behind the voltage phasor V2 by an angle I2 (where I2 = cos–1 pf of load).

This current IBCis represented by phasor OC. There is a voltage drop in the resistance and reactance 
of the winding section BC. To represent these drops, draw a line parallel to line OC from A and take 
AD = I2 (1 – K) R2. Draw a perpendicular from D on OC so that DE = I2(1 – K) X2. Triangle ADE

An auto-transformer, shown in Fig. 2.69(a), may be considered as a two-winding transformer with 
winding of section AC of (N1 – N2) turns acting as primary and the winding of section BC of N2
turns acting as secondary. Thus, an auto-transformer behaves as a two-winding transformer primary 
applied voltage across AC is VAC and primary current is I1. The secondary output voltage is V2 and 
the secondary winding current is (I2 – I1). For given auto-transformer, its equivalent circuit as a two-

Fig. 2.69 Simplified equivalent circuit of an auto-transformer
The equivalent circuit of an auto-transformer is shown in Fig. 2.69(c) where exciting circuit is 
not considered. If exciting resistance and reactance is considered, then its equivalent circuit will be 
as shown in Fig. 2.69(d).
In Fig. 2.69(a), if input voltage is applied across BC and the load is connected across AB, then the 
transformer acts as a step-up auto-transformer.
2.50 Conversion of a Two-winding Transformer to an Auto-transformer 
A conventional two-winding transformer with its polarity markings is shown in Fig. 2.70(a). It can 
be converted to a step-up autotransformer by connecting the two windings electrically in series with 
additive or subtractive polarities. With additive polarity between the high-voltage and low-voltage 
sides, a step-up transformer is obtained. Whereas, with subtractive polarity a step-down transformer 
is obtained.
Let us consider a conventional 24 kVA, 2500/250 V transformer to be connected in autotransformer 
configuration.
Additive Polarity
Figure 2.70(b) shows the series connections of the windings with additive polarity. The circuit is 
redrawn in Fig. 2.70(c) showing common terminal of the autotransformer at the top. Figure 2.70(d) 
shows the same circuit with common terminal at the bottom. Since the polarity is additive, VHV = 
2500+ 250 = 2750 V and VLV = 2500 V, the transformer acts as a step-up autotransformer.
Subtractive Polarity
Figure 2.70(e) shows the series connections of the windings with subtractive polarity. The circuit is 
redrawn in Fig. 2.70(f) with common terminal at the top. Figure 2.70(g) shows the same circuit with 
common terminal at the bottom. Since the polarity is subtractive VHV = 2500 V and VLV = 2500 – 250 
= 2250 V, the transformer acts as a step-down autotransformer.

2.51 Comparison of Characteristics of Auto-transformers and 
Two-winding Transformers 
An auto-transformer can be considered as a two-winding transformer with winding AC as primary 
and winding BC as the secondary. Ratings and characteristics of auto-transformers and two-winding 
transformers so obtained, differ as discussed below:

(ii) Losses. When a two-winding transformer is connected as an auto-transformer, the current in 
different sections and voltages across them remain unchanged. Therefore, losses when working 
as an auto-transformer are the same as the losses in a two-winding transformer. Per unit losses, 
however, differ.

(iii) Impedance drop. When a two-winding transformer is used as an auto-transformer, both LV 
and HV windings are utilised completely. In addition, current and voltage ratings of each 
winding section remain unaltered. Therefore, impedance drop at full load is the same in both 
the transformers. Their per unit values are, however, different. When referred to HV side, per 
unit impedance drop as an auto-transformer is with respect to voltage V1 and for a two-winding 
transformer, it is with respect to (V1 – V2) = V1 (1 – K).

2.52 Applications of Auto-transformers 
1. Single-phase and 3-phase auto-transformers are employed for obtaining variable output voltages 
at the output. When used as variable ratio auto-transformers, these are known by their trade 
names, such as variac, dimmerstat, autostat etc.
Fig. 2.71 Auto-transformer as a variac
A variable ratio auto-transformer (or variac) has a toroidal core and toroidal winding. A sliding 
contact with the winding is made by carbon brush, as shown in Fig. 2.71 and Fig. 2.64( f). The 
position of the sliding contact can be varied by a hand-wheel which changes output voltage. 
These are mostly used in laboratories.
2. Auto-transformers are also used as boosters for raising the voltage in an AC feeder.
3. As furnace transformers, for getting a convenient supply to suit the furnace winding from 
normal 230 V AC supply
4. Auto-transformers with a number of tappings are used for starting induction motors and 
synchronous motors. When auto-transformers are used for this purpose, these are known as 
auto-starters.

It is to be noted that if the windings of the two-winding transformer are connected in series to 
form an autotransformer, the current in the two windings should not exceed their rated values.
To form an autotransformer, the two-windings may be connected in the following two ways:

Here, 
VAC = 2500 V, VBC = 12500 V
?
V1 = VAC + VBC = 2500 + 12500 = 15000 V

Example 2.67
A load of 100 kVA is to be supplied at 500 volt from 2500 V supply mains by an auto-transformer. 
Determine the current and voltage rating for each of the two windings. What would be the kVA 
rating of the transformer, if it were used as a two winding transformer.

The voltage across winding BC is 500 volt and current flowing through it is phasor difference 
of currents I1 and I2. Neglecting no-load current, phasor difference of currents I1 and I2 is equal to 
numerical difference of two currents I1 and I2 and therefore current flowing through winding BC is 
200 – 40 = 160 A, refer Fig. 2.3
Hence voltage rating of winding BC = 500 V (Ans.)
Current rating of winding BC = 200 A (Ans.)
Although voltage across winding AC is not necessarily in phase with the voltage across CB. However 
the angle between the two voltages is usually so small that the voltages are added numerically.
Voltage across winding, AC = 2500 – 500 = 2000 V
Current flowing through the winding AC is I1 i.e., 40 A
Hence voltage rating of winding AC = 200 volt (Ans.)
Current rating of winding AC = 40 A (Ans.)

(v) Percent impedance of two-winding transformer = 4%
The ohmic drop at full load is the same in both cases. If the impedance drop is referred to 
HV side of the auto-transformer (see Fig. 2.77), the pu (per unit) or percent drop in the auto-
transformer is with respect to V1 while that in the two-winding transformer it is with respect to
V1 – V2 = V2 (1 – K)
If the impedance drop is referred to LV side of the auto-transformer, then the winding current is
I2 – I1 = I2 (1 – K),
So the impedance drop with respect to I2 is to be reduced by (1 – K) times in the case of an 
auto-transformer.
Therefore pu or percent impedance drop in an auto-transformer

Introduction
Three phase system is invariably adopted for generation, transmission and distribution of electrical 
power due to economical reasons. Usually, power is generated at the generating stations at 11 kV 
(or 33 kV), whereas, it is transmitted at 750 kV, 400 kV, 220 kV, 132 kV or 66 kV due to economical 
reasons. At the receiving stations, the voltage level is decreased and power is transmitted through 
shorter distances. While delivering power to the consumers, the voltage level is decreased to as low 
as 400V (line value) for safety reasons.
Thus to increase the voltage level at the generating stations step-up transformers and to decrease 
the voltage level at the receiving stations, step down transformers are employed.
CHAPTER

Three-Phase Transformers 
225
3.1 Merits of Three-phase Transformer over Bank of Three Single-
phase Transformers 
The voltage level in three-phase system at the generating stations and at the receiving stations can 
be changed either by employing a bank of three single-phase transformers (inter connecting them in 
star or delta) or by employing one three phase transformer. Generally, one three phase transformer 
is preferred over a bank of three single phase transformers because of the following reasons.
(i) It requires smaller quantity of iron and copper. Hence, its cost is nearly 15% lesser than a bank 
of three single phase transformers of equal rating.
(ii) It has smaller size and can be accommodated in smaller tank and hence needs smaller quantity 
of oil for cooling.
(iii) Because of smaller size, it occupies less space; moreover it has less weight.
(iv) It needs less number of bushings.
(v) It operates at slightly better efficiency and regulation.
These transformers suffer from the following disadvantage.
(i) It is more difficult and costly to repair three-phase transformers. 
(ii) It is difficult to transport single large unit of three-phase transformer than to transport three 
single phase transformers individually.
The advantages of three-phase transformer (such as lower cost, lower weight, lower space 
requirement etc.) over weighs its disadvantages and hence are invariably employed in the power 
system to step-up or step-down the voltage level.
3.2 Construction of Three-phase Transformers 
Form construction point of view, three-phase transformers are also classified as
(i) Core type transformers (ii) Shell type transformers
Core Type Transformers
In core type three-phase transformers, the core has three limbs of equal area of cross-section. Three 
limbs are joined by two horizontal (top and bottom) members called yokes. The area of cross- section 
of all the limbs and yokes is the same since at every instant magnitude of flux set-up in each part is 
the same. The core consists of laminations of silicon steel material having oxide film coating on both 
the sides for insulation. The laminations are usually of E and I shape and are staggered alternately 
to decrease reluctance of magnetic path and increase the mechanical strength. 
The complete section of a three-phase core type transformer with its plan is shown in Fig. 3.1. This 
type of transformers is usually wound with circular cylindrical coils. The low voltage* (LV) winding 
* When LV winding is placed nearer the core, less insulation is required between the core and the LV winding 
in comparison to that if HV winding is placed nearer the core and hence reduces the cost of construction.

226
Electrical Machines
is wound nearer the core and high voltage (HV) winding is wound over low voltage winding as shown 
in Fig. 3.1. Insulation is always provided between the core and low voltage winding and between low 
voltage winding and high voltage winding.
Fig. 3.1 Construction of a three-phase core type transformer
The core construction for very large capacity three-phase transformers is slightly changed. In this 
case, the core consists of three main limbs on which windings are arranged and two additional limbs 
at the sides without winding are formed as shown in Fig. 3.2. This arrangement allows decreasing 
the height of the yoke and consequently decreases the overall height of the core. However, the length 
increases. This facilitates the transportation of transformers by rail. In this arrangement, the magnetic 
circuits for each phase are virtually independent:
In either case, the magnetic circuits of the three-phases are somewhat unbalanced, the middle 
phase having less reluctance than the outer two. This causes the magnetising current of middle phase 
slightly less than the outers. But during operation, the magnetising current is so small that it does 
not produce any noticeable effect.
Fig. 3.2 Core and winding of core-type three-phase transformer
Shell Type Transformers
In shell type transformers, the core construction is such that the windings are embedded in the core 
instead of surrounding the iron as shown in Fig. 3.3. The area of cross section of the central limbs 
is double to that of the side limbs and horizontal members.
The low voltage and high voltage windings of the three-phases are wound on the central limbs. 
These windings are placed vertically in the three portions as shown in Fig. 3.3. The low voltage (LV) 
winding is always placed neater to the core and high voltage (HV) winding is placed over the low 

Three-Phase Transformers 
227
voltage winding for economic reasons. To obtain uniform distribution of flux in the core, usually 
second winding placed on the central limb is wound in the reverse direction as shown in Fig. 3.4.
Note: The detailed construction of core, winding, bushing, etc., has already been dealt with in 
chapter-4.

3.3 Determination of Relative Primary and Secondary Windings in 
Case of Three-phase Transformer 
At the place of manufacturing, all the primary and secondary winding terminals are traceable. Otherwise, 
all the primary and secondary winding terminals belonging to each other are to be determined.
To determine which secondary belongs to which primary, proceed as follows:
Short circuit all the phases except one primary and a probable secondary. Connect a voltmeter 
across the secondary and circulate a small direct current in the primary. A momentary deflection 
of voltmeter on making and breaking of primary current confirms that the secondary corresponds 
to the primary chosen otherwise check the other secondary. The test is repeated for other windings 
too. For this test, the terminals of all the windings must be open and available for testing.
3.4 Polarity of Transformer Windings
In order to connect windings of the same transformer in parallel or series or in star/delta, or to 
interconnect two or more transformers in parallel, or to connect single phase transformers for poly-
phase transformation of voltages, it is necessary to know the polarity of the different winding terminals. 
The polarity of the transformer terminals is usually indicated by means of standard marking scheme 
followed by manufactures – the scheme varies from country to country.

228
Electrical Machines
Transformer polarity marking designates the relative instantaneous directions of current and 
voltage in the transformer leads. In one system high voltage leads are indicated by letter A (or H) 
and low voltage leads by a (or X), and tertiary, if any by (A) [or Y], each with a subscript 1, 2, 3 etc., 
depending upon the number of leads. The A-a scheme is shown in Fig. 3.5
Note: As per Indian standards based on IEC (International Electro-technical Commission) 
document, in single-phase power transformers 1.1 is used for A1 (or H1), 1.2 for A2 (or H2), 2.1 
for a1 (or X1), 2.2 for a2 (or X2), 3.1 for (A1) or Y1, etc., the voltage magnitudes in A-a and (A) 
being in decreasing order.
In Fig. 3.5 the primary winding A1–A2 and secondary winding a1–a2 are wound in the same 
direction, while in Fig. 3.5(b) secondary winding a2 – a1 is wound in the direction opposite to A1–A2. 
When the A1 and a1 leads are adjacent, the polarity is said to be subtractive, and when A1 and a1
are diametrically opposite to each other, the polarity is designated as additive. It may be noted that 
subtractive polarity reduces voltage stress between adjacent leads.
The polarity of unmarked transformers can be found out by simple polarity tests which have 
already been dealt with in chapter-1. (Section 1.31).
Fig. 3.5 Transformer polarity designation
3.5 Phasor Representation of Alternating Quantities in Three-phase 
Transformer Connections 
Before to study the connections of three-phase transformers, it is necessary to learn the characteristics 
of balanced three-phase systems as well as the conventions followed to designate currents and voltages 
of a three-phase system. If the supply voltage is balanced, the voltages can be represented by a voltage 
triangle shown in Fig. 3.6(a), where A, B, C are the nomenclatures of the three lines of the system 
and N stands for the neutral or star point of the system. A,B,C are the three vertices of the equilateral 
triangle ABC and N is the circum centre of the triangle. The voltages and currents with double 
subscripts notation are represented by phasors. For example, Vab, Iab represent voltage of point a with 
respect to point b and current flowing from point a to point b, respectively. With the arrow pointing 
towards A the line represents voltage phasor VAN. Thus the line-to-line voltage (also called as line 
voltage) phasor and line-to-neutral voltage (also known as phase voltage) phasors can be drawn from 

Three-Phase Transformers 
229
the voltage triangle shown in Fig. 3.6(a). The phasor diagram is shown in Fig. 3.6(b) where phase 
voltage phasors which are equal in magnitude are displaced from each other by 120°. The line voltage 
phasors are also equal in magnitude and displaced from each other by 120°, but the magnitude of a 
line voltage phasor is 
3  times the magnitude of a phase voltage phasor. Further it may be noted 
that the set of line voltage phasors is displaced from the set of phase voltage phasors by 30°.
Fig. 3.6 Phasors of a balanced three-phase system
If the lines carry balanced load then the magnitudes of the line currents IA, IB and IC are equal 
and displaced with respect to each other by 120°. They are equally displaced from the corresponding 
phase voltages by an angle I as shown in Fig. 3.6(b), the power factor being cos I. In this case, the 
power factor is lagging as currents lag behind the phase voltages.
Note: As per Indian Standards Specifications, the terminals of a three-phase transformer are 
marked as U, V, W with numerics 1, 2, 3, etc.

3.6 Three-phase Transformer Connections
As mentioned earlier, the standard nomenclature for phases is A, B, C. Capital letters A, B,C are used 
for HV windings, lower case letters a, b, c for LV winding and (A), (B), (C) for a tertiary windings 

230
Electrical Machines
if provided. Neutral terminals precede line terminals. Each winding 
has two ends designated by the subscript numbers 1, 2. However, 
if there are intermediary tapping (or there are sections of the same 
winding) these are numbered in order of their separation from end 1, 
as illustrated in Fig. 3.7.
The interconnection of the phase windings to give a three-phase, 
three-wire or three-phase, four wire supply provides three alternative 
modes of connection (i) delta or mesh (ii) star and (iii) zig-zag. Each of 
these can be achieved in two ways. For Example 3.a star-connection may 
be had by joining together A1, B1 and C1, to form the neutral and using 
A2, B2 and C2 as line terminals. Alternatively A2, B2, and C2 may be 
joined to give neutral and A1, B1 and C1 may be used as line terminals.
Since primary and secondary can be treated in either of these ways, 
at least twelve combinations of connection are possible. All these 
combinations are illustrated in Fig. 3.8. According to the phase displacement which exists between 
the line voltages on the two sides of the transformer these combinations can be arranged in the 
following four main groups:
Group 1: With 0° phase displacement 
: Connections with symbolic notation Yy0, Dd0, Dz0
Group 2:With 180° phase displacement 
: Connections with symbolic notation Yy6, Dd6, Dz6
Group 3: With 30° lag phase displacement : Connections with symbolic notation Dy1, Yd1, Yz1
Group 4: With 30° lead phase displacement : Connections with symbolic notation Dy11, Yd11, Yz11
Among the above, the most popular method of connecting transformers is the delta–star connections 
(Dy11). The connection diagram illustrates the relative position of the terminals in the terminal box 
and the arrangement of internal connections. The HV winding is connected to a three-wire supply 
having phase sequence A, B, C and at the instant chosen the potential of A is at its maximum positive 
value. Thus the line voltage on the HV side will form an equilateral triangle as illustrated. The line 
terminals are A1, B1 and C1 and the corners of the triangles are so marked. It is to be noted that the 
phase A of the transformer lies between A1 and B1, phase B between B1 and C1 and phase C between 
C1 and A1 owing to internal connections used.
In case of LV winding, since Va a
1 2 is in phase with VA A
1 2, the line na1 is, therefore, drawn parallel 
to B1A1 in order to establish the direction of phase–voltages phasor. Similarly nb1 and nc1 depend 
on C1B1 and A1C1 and the phasor diagram for LV shows the voltages of the terminals a1, b1 and c1
with respect to n.
From the phasor diagrams of induced voltages for HV and LVsides it is observed that the voltage of 
the HV line A1 is at maximum value, the LV line a1 has been advanced by 30°. In fact, the transformer 
connections have produced this displacement of 30° for all lines.
All the other methods of connections in the same main group no. 4 give a similar 30° advance 
which is the basis of classification.
In case of group no. 1 there is no phase displacement, whereas group no. 2 gives phase displacement 
of 180°. In group no. 3, the line voltage of LV winding lags by 30°.
For parallel operation of transformers the essential requirement is that the transformer connections 
belong to the same main group so that there may not be any phase displacement between the line voltages.

Three-Phase Transformers 
233
With three-phase transformers, it is possible to obtain any desired phase shift if the primary and/
or secondary windings are divided into a sufficient number of sections. The zig-zag connection 
is one of the example of sectionalised winding. By using these connections, the effect of third 
harmonics in line to neutral voltages and line to line voltages is reduced. In these connections, 
half sections are connected in opposition which gives the larger total fundamental voltage and 
causes the co-phasial third harmonics to cancel. The fundamental line-to-neutral voltage is 0.866 
times the arithmetic sum of the two section voltages (phase voltages in zig-zag, connection being 
composed of two half-voltages with a phase difference of 60°). This causes the reduction in voltage 
and to compensate the same 15 percent more turns are required for a given total voltage per phase. 
Consequently, it necessitates an increase in the frame size over that normally used for the given 
rating. However, the advantages of zig-zag arrangement may offset the cost. The other important 
advantages of zig-zag connections are unbalanced loads on the secondary side are distributed 
better on the primary side. The zig-zag/star connection has been employed where delta connections 
were mechanically weak (on account of large number of turns and small copper sections) in HV
transformers. These are also preferred for rectifiers.
3.7 Selection of Transformer Connections 
When a transformer is to be placed in a power system to step-up or step down the voltage, it is 
selected as per its connections which are having some peculiar characteristics as explained below:
3.7.1 Star-Star (Yy0 or Yy6) Connections
The star-star connections of a three-phase transformer are shown in Figs. 3.9.1(a and b) and 9.2(a
and b). Their phasor diagrams are also shown in Figs. 3.9.1(c and d) and 3.9.2 (c and d). It may be 
seen that line voltage is
3  times the phase voltage and there is a phase difference of 30° between 
them. In Fig. 3.9.1 the secondary voltage is in phase with the primary, whereas in Fig. 3.9.2 the 
secondary voltage system is 180° out of phase from the primary, the former is designated as Yy0 
and the latter is designated as Yy6 for three-phase transformers.

Three-Phase Transformers 
235
Star-star connected three-phase transformers are operated with grounded neutrals, i.e., the neutral 
of the primary is connected to the neutral of the power source. If the neutral is kept in isolation, the 
unbalanced load on the secondary will shift the position of neutral which changes the magnitude of 
phase voltages. A grounded neutral in the primary prevents this unsatisfactory operation.
With an isolated neutral the third-harmonic components in the magnetising currents of the three 
primary windings are in phase and as such they have no path. As the path for third harmonic current 
is absent, the phase voltages become non-sinusoidal though the line voltages are sinusoidal.
Fig. 3.10 Oscillating neutral at different instants
For illustration, consider that the fundamental phasors for the balanced phase voltages are e1A, 
e1B and e1C each of magnitude e1, while the third harmonic voltage for each phase is e3. At a certain 
time their relative positions are as shown in Fig. 3.10. As the third harmonic phase voltage has the 
frequency different from that of the fundamental (the frequency of third harmonic is thrice the 
fundamental frequency) phase voltage, their relative positions vary with time, that is, position of Nc
changes. This phenomenon is known as oscillating neutral. The maximum voltage at any phase is
e
e
1
3
+
. Thus harmonic voltage is undesirable as it develops high stress in the insulation of the 
windings. The use of a grounded neutral or a tertiary delta winding will allow a path for the third-
harmonic current and thus produces a sinusoidal flux and a sinusoidal phase voltage.
The star-star transformer connections are most economical. These are employed in small current and 
high voltage transformers. The advantages and disadvantages of such an arrangement are given below:

236
Electrical Machines
Advantages:
(i) The number of turns per phase and the amount of insulation is minimum because phase voltage 
is only 1
3
times to that of line voltage.
(ii) There is no phase displacement between the primary and secondary voltages.
(iii) It is possible to provide a neutral connection since star point is available on both the sides.
Disadvantages:
(i) Under unbalanced load conditions on the secondary side, the phase voltages of load side change 
unless the load star point is earthed. This condition is called shifting of neutral. However by 
connecting the primary star point to the star point of the generator the difficulty of shifting 
neutral can be overcome.
(ii) The primary of the transformer draws a magnetising current which contains third and fifth 
harmonic. If neutral of primary winding is not connected to neutral of generator, the third and 
fifth harmonic currents will distort the core flux and change the wave shape of output voltages. 
However, by connecting primary neutral to the generator neutral, the path for return of these 
third and fifth harmonic currents is provided and, therefore, the trouble of distortion of voltages 
is overcome.
(iii) Even if neutral point of primary is connected to neutral of generator or earthed, still third 
harmonic may exist. This will appear on secondary side. Although the secondary line voltages 
do not contain third harmonic voltage; but the 3rd harmonic voltages are additive in the neutral 
and causes current in the neutral of triple frequency (3rd harmonic) which will cause interference 
to the nearby communication system.
Note: Star-star connections are rarely used because of the difficulties associated with the exciting 
current although these are more economical.
3.7.2 Delta-Delta (Dd0 or Dd6) Connections
Figure 3.11.1(a and b) shows delta-delta connections, designated as Dd0 of a three-phase transformer. 
Their phasor diagrams are also shown in Fig. 3.11.1(c and d). It may be seen that line voltages and 
phase voltages have the same magnitude but the line currents are 3  times to that of phase currents, 
i.e., IA = 3I AB .

If the connections of the phase windings are reversed on either side as shown in Fig. 3.11.2(a and
b) we may have the phase difference of 180° between the primary and secondary systems as shown 
in Fig. 3.11.2(c and d). These connections are designated as Dd6.

Electrical Machines
The primary draws the magnetising current of a transformer which contains third harmonic. 
Since the third harmonic components of current of the three phases are displaced from each other 
by 120° × 3 = 360°, they are all in phase and produce circulating current within the primary delta. 
This current produces sinusoidal flux and the secondary voltage becomes sinusoidal.
These connections are usually employed in power system where large currents on low voltages 
are employed. Moreover, these connections are suitable when continuity of service is required to be 
maintained even though one of the phases develops fault. When operated in this way, the transformer 
delivers three phase currents and voltages in their correct phase relationship but the capacity of the 
transformer is reduced to 57.7% of the normal rating.
Advantages:
(i) There is no phase displacement between the primary and secondary voltages.
(ii) There is no distortion of flux, since the third harmonic component of magnetising current flows 
in the delta-connected primary winding without flowing in the line wires.
(iii) For winding, conductors with smaller diameter are required as cross-section of conductor is 
reduced because the phase current is 1
3
times of line current.
(iv) No difficulty is experienced even though the load is unbalanced on the secondary side.
Disadvantages:
(i) More insulation is required in comparison to star-star connections since phase voltage in equal 
to line voltage.
(ii) In these connections, the star point is absent, if one line gets earthed due to fault, maximum 
voltage between windings and core will become full line voltage.
3.7.3 Star-Delta (Yd1 or Yd11) Connections
These connections are shown in Fig. 3.12.1(a, b). By drawing a phasor diagram, it can be seen that 
a 30° phase shift appears in line voltage as well as in system phase voltages between primary and 
secondary side. The third-harmonic currents flow within the mesh to provide a sinusoidal flux, the 
ratio between primary and secondary system voltages is 
3  times the phase turns ratio. When 
operated in Y-', the primary neutral is sometimes grounded to connect it to four-wire system.

Three-Phase Transformers 
239
Figure 3.12.1 shows phase shift of 30° lag whereas Fig. 3.12.2(a and b) shows phase shift of 30° 
lead. If the transformer is poly-phase and the high voltage side is star connected, the former connection 
is termed as Yd1 and the latter Yd11.
Fig. 3.12.2 
Phase shift 30º lag
Usually, the transformers with these connections are used where the voltage is to be stepped down. 
For example, at the receiving end of a transmission line. In this type of transformer connections, the 
neutral of the primary winding is earthed. In this system line voltage ratio is 1
3
times of transformer 
turn-ratio and secondary line voltages have a phase shift of ± 30° with respect to primary line voltages. 
On the HV side of the transformer insulation is stressed only to the extent of 57.7% of the line voltage 
and, therefore, there is some saving in the cost of insulation.
3.7.4 Delta-Star (Dy1 or Dy11) Connections
The '-Y connections and phasor diagrams of a three-phase transformer supplying a balance load are 
shown in Figs. 3.13.1 and 3.13.2. It may be noted that the secondary system phase voltages i.e., Van 
etc., lag the primary system phase voltages VAN etc., by 30°. The ratio of primary to secondary line 
voltages is 1
3
/
times the transformation ratio for the individual phase windings. No difficulty 
arises due to third harmonic currents as a delta connection allows a path for these currents.

Electrical Machines
Fig. 3.13.2 Delta–star connection of transformer (Phase shift 30° lead)
The use of such connections permits a grounded neutral on the secondary side to provide a three-phase 
four-wire supply system. By reversing the connections on either side, the secondary system voltage can 
be made to lead the primary system by 30° as shown in Fig. 3.13.2. If the transformer is three-phase 
and the high voltage side is delta connected, the transformer is designated as Dy1 and the latter Dy11.
The transformers with these connections are employed where it is necessary to step up the 
voltage. For example, at the beginning of HV transmission system. These connections are also very 
popular with distribution transformers where voltages are stepped down to 400 V with three-phase, 
four-wire system.
Advantages:
(i) On the high voltage side of the transformer, insulation is stressed only to the extent of 57.7% of 
line voltage.
(ii) In this case, the neutral point is stable and will not “float” when load is unbalanced.
(iii) There is no distortion of flux because the primary is delta connected which allows a path for 
the 3rd harmonic currents.
Disadvantages:
(i) In this scheme of connection the line voltage ratio is 
3  times of transformer turn-ratio.

Three-Phase Transformers 
241
(ii) The secondary line voltages have a phase shift of ± 30° with respect to primary line voltages.
The neutral of the secondary is grounded to provide three-phase, four-wire system and this scheme 
of connections is widely used in distribution systems because it can be used to serve both the three 
phase power equipment and single phase lighting circuits. In such case the 11 kV/400 V transformer 
connections provide a four-wire secondary, with neutral converted to the 4th wire. The three-phase 
equipment is connected to the line wires to operate at 400 V while the lighting equipment is connected 
between one of the line wires and neutral to operate at 230 volt.
Note: Star–delta or delta–star connected transformers cannot be operated is parallel with star-
star or delta-delta connected transformers even though the voltage ratios are correctly adjusted 
as there will be a 30° phase difference between corresponding voltages on the secondary side.
3.7.5 Delta-Zigzag Connections
In this case, the primary is connected in delta and each secondary winding is divided in two halves 
such as a1 – a2, a3 – a4; b1 – b2, b3 – b4 and c1 – c2, c3 – c4. The six halves are then connected to form 
a zigzag connection as shown in Figs. 3.14.1 and 3.14.2. A1, a1, a3 are of same polarity; similarly, B1, 
b1, b3 and C1, c1, c3 are of same polarity respectively. If the voltage of each half of the transformer 
secondary is V2, the phase voltage of the secondary system is 
3 2
V and the voltage is 
3
3
¥
V2
= 3V2. If I2 be the rated current of each secondary winding, the volt-ampere available from the three-
phase transformer will be3 3 V V
2 1 while the sum of the individual winding capacities is 6V2I2. Thus 
only 0.866 of the combined individual capacity is available at the output.
There is no phase difference between phase voltages of the primary and secondary systems in 
the connection of Fig. 3.14.1(a) whereas a phase shift of 180° occurs if the secondary is connected as 
shown in Fig. 3.14.2. In poly-phase transformers if the delta is on the high voltage side, which is usually 
the case, the connections of Fig. 3.14.1 are termed as Dz0 and that of Fig. 3.14.2 are termed as Dz6.
Delta-zigzag connections are useful for supply of power to rectifiers.

3.7.6 Star-Zigzag Connection
In this case, the primary is connected in star and each secondary which is made of two helps of a1
– a2, a3 – a4; b1 – b2 etc. is connected in zig-zag. Zigzag connections have already been explained 
while discussing delta–zigzag connections. In Fig. 3.15.1 the phase voltage of the secondary system 
leads the primary voltage by 30° while in Fig. 3.15.2 they lag by 30°.
Fig. 3.15.1 Phase shift 30° lead
If the zigzag is on the low voltage side, which is normally the case, and the transformer is poly-
phase, then the connection of Fig. 3.15.1 is designated as Yz11 and that of Fig. 3.15.2 as Yz1. There 
is similar reduction in available capacity as in delta–zigzag connections.
These zig-zag connections reduce the effect of third-harmonic voltage and at the same time permits 
unbalanced loading even though the primary is star-connected with isolated neutral.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What are the advantages of using three-phase transformers over a bank of three one-phase 
transformers? 
Ans. 
(i) It requires smaller quantity of iron and copper. Hence, its cost is nearly 15% lesser than a bank 
of three single phase transformers of equal rating.
(ii) It has smaller size and can be accommodated in smaller tank and hence needs smaller quantity 
of oil for cooling.
(iii) It has less weight and occupies less space.
(iv) It needs less number of bushings.
(v) It operates at slightly better efficiency and regulation.

Q.4. Star-star connected transformers are rarely used, why?
Ans. 
(i) Under unbalanced load conditions on the secondary side, the phase voltages of load side change 
unless the load star point is earthed. This condition is called shifting of neutral.
(ii) The primary of the transformer draws a magnetising current which contains third and fifth harmonic. 
If neutral of primary winding is not connected to neutral of generator, the third and fifth harmonic 
currents which distort the core flux and change the wave shape of output voltages.
(iii) Even if neutral point of primary is connected to neutral of generator or earthed, still third harmonic 
may exist.
Star-star connections are rarely used because of the difficulties associated with the exciting current 
although these are more economical.
3.8 Parallel Operation of Three-phase Transformers
When the primaries and secondaries of the two or more transformer are connected separately to the 
same incoming and outgoing lines to share the load,the transformers said to be connected in parallel.

Three-Phase Transformers 
253
Fig. 3.16 Connections for parallel operation of two three-phase transformers
The two three-phase transformers A and B are placed in parallel as shown in Fig. 3.16. Here the 
primary windings of the two transformers are connected to the supply bus-bars and the secondary 
windings are connected to the load through load bus-bars. Under this conditions
V1L = Primary applied voltage
V2L = VL = Secondary load voltage.
3.9 Necessity of Parallel Operation of Three-phase Transformers
As explained earlier, following are the reasons for which transformers are put in parallel.
(i) When the load on the transmission lines increases beyond the capacity of the installed 
transformer. To overcome this problem one way is to replace the existing transformer with the 
new one having larger capacity (this is called augmentation of transformer) and the other way 
is to place one more transformer is parallel with the existing one to share the load. The cost of 
replacing the transformer is much more than placing another one in parallel with the existing 
one.
Hence, it is desirable to place another transformer is parallel when the electrical load on the 
existing transformer increases beyond its rated capacity.
(ii) Sometimes, the amount of power to be transformed is so high that it is not possible to build a 
single unit of that capacity, then we have to place two or more transformers in parallel.
Hence, parallel operation of transformers is necessary when the amount of power to be 
transformed is much more than that which can be handled by single unit (transformer).

254
Electrical Machines
(iii) At the grid sub stations, spare transformers are always necessary to insure the continuity of 
supply in case of breakdown. The size of spare transformer depends upon the size of transformers 
placed at the grid sub-station. Therefore, it is desirable to place transformers of smaller capacity 
in parallel to transform the given load which in turn reduces the size of the spare transformer.
Hence, it is desirable to do parallel operation of transformers if we want to keep the spare 
transformer of smaller size.
3.10 Conditions for Parallel Operation of Three-phase Transformers
The following conditions are to be fulfilled if two or more Three-phase transformers are to be operated 
successfully in parallel to deliver a common load.
(i) Both the transformers should have same transformation ratio i.e., the voltage ratings of both 
primaries and secondaries must be identical.
If this condition is not exactly fulfilled i.e., if the two transformers ‘A’ and ‘B’ have slight 
difference in their voltage or transformation ratios, even then parallel operation is possible. 
Since the transformation ratios are unequal, primary applied voltage being equal, the induced 
emfs in the secondary windings will not be equal. Due to this inequality of induced emfs in the 
secondary windings, there will be, even at no-load, some circulating current flowing from one 
secondary winding (having higher induced emf) to the other secondary windings (having lower 
induced emf). In other words, there will be circulating currents between the secondary windings 
and therefore between primary windings also when the secondary terminals are connected in 
parallel. The impedance of transformers is small, so that a small percentage voltage difference 
may be sufficient to circulate a considerable current and cause additional I2 R loss. When 
load is applied on the secondary side of such a transformer, the circulating current will tend 
to produce unequal loading conditions. Hence, it may be impossible to take the combined full 
load kVA output from the parallel connected group without one of the transformers becoming 
excessively hot. For satisfactory parallel operation the circulating current should not exceed 
10% of the normal load current.
(ii) Both the transformers should have the same percentage (or per unit) impedance.
If this condition is not exactly fulfilled, i.e., the impedance triangles at the rated kVA’s are not 
identical in shape and size, even then parallel operation will be possible, but the power factors 
at which the transformers operate will differ from the power factor of the load. Therefore, in 
this case the transformers will not share the load in proportion to their kVA ratings.
(iii) Both three-phase transformers must have the same phase-sequence i.e., the transformers must 
be properly connected with regard to their phase-sequence.
If this condition is not observed, the secondary of one transformer will act as a load on the other, 
i.e., the secondaries will be under short circuit condition, they will be heated up and damage 
the insulation quickly This condition must be fulfilled by all means.
(iv) In case of three-phase transformers, the two transformers must have such connections that 
there should not be any phase displacement between the secondary line voltages.
The primaries and secondaries of three-phase transformers may be connected in different form 
of connections. These connections produce various magnitudes and phase displacements. 

Three-Phase Transformers 
255
The magnitudes can be adjusted by changing the tapings but phase displacement cannot be 
compensated. Therefore the following types of connections are permissible for connecting three-
phase transformers in parallel.
Transformer-I: 
Yy 
Dd 
Yy 
Yd 
Yd
Transformer-II: 
Yy

Dy 
Yz
However, transformers with (D + 30°) and (–30°) angle can also be connected in parallel but 
only after reversing the connections of either primary or secondary.
3.11 Load Sharing between Three-phase Transformers Connected 
in Parallel 
The load sharing between two transformers connected in parallel depends upon the various conditions 
as discussed in chapter-2, Art No. 2-41. The only difference is that, in case of three-phase transformers 
per phase impedance is to be considered while determining the load sharing. If percentage impedances 
of the two transformers having different rating are given, their values have to be converted as per 
base kVA for calculating load sharing, i.e., % Resistance or % Reactance at base kVA = Base kVA
Rated kVA
× % R or % X at rated kVA.
Example 3.11
Two three-phase transformers each of 100 kVA are connected in parallel. One transformer has (per-
phase) resistance and reactance of 1% and 4% respectively and the other has (per-phase) resistance 
and reactance of 1.5% and 6% respectively. Calculate the load shared by each transformer and 
their pf when the total load to be shared is 120 kVA, 0.8 p.f. lagging.

Here, 
Load = 120 kVA at p.f. 0.8 lagging

3.12 Three Winding Transformers (Tertiary Winding) 
Transformers usually have third winding in addition to the normal primary and secondary winding 
called tertiary winding, and the transformer in called triple wound or 3-winding transformer. The 
third winding is placed on the core because of any of the following reasons:
(i) In star-star connected transformers to suppress harmonic voltages, to allow sufficient earth 
fault current to flow for operation of protective devices and to limit voltage unbalancing when 
transformer is supplying an unsymmetrical load.
(ii) To prevent neutral potential, in star/star connected transformer, from oscillating to undesirable extent.
(iii) To supply an additional load at a voltage different from that of the primary and secondary.
(iv) To supply power to phase compensating devices, such as condensers,* operated at a voltage that 
is different from both primary and secondary voltage.
(v) To measure voltage of an HV testing transformer.
* Usually, in all extensive high voltage systems, regulation of voltage at certain points is provided by means of synchronous 
condensers. These condensers are connected to the high voltage system through transformers. From economic 
considerations, the condenser connections are made through a third winding placed in the transformers. 

258
Electrical Machines
Usually, tertiary windings are delta-connected to provide path for zero sequence currents in the 
case of single line or double line to ground faults. This low reactance path reduces voltage unbalancing 
caused by these unbalanced ground faults.
The tertiary winding is called as an auxiliary winding when it is employed for supplying an 
additional small load at a different voltage. On the other hand, it is also called as stabilising winding 
when it is employed to limit the short-circuit current.
Operating Principle of 3-winding Transformer
The operating principle of a 3-winding (or triple wound) transformer is essentially the same as 
that of a two-winding transformer. The primary winding of a three winding transformer acts as the 
magnetising winding, and its current produces the main magnetic flux. The flux links the secondary 
and tertiary windings and induces emfs in them in proportion to their number of turns respectively. 
When loads are connected across the secondary and tertiary windings, currents I2 and I3 flow in 
them. The ampere-turns are balanced as given below:
I1N1 = (–I2 N2) + (–I3N3) + I0 N1 
…(3.11)
or 
I1 = I2c + I3c + I0 
(since I2c = -I N
N
2
2
1
and I3c = -I N
N
3
2
1
) …(3.12) 
Thus in a 3-winding transformer, power is transferred to secondary and tertiary winding 
simultaneously.
Usually, both secondary and tertiary windings are not fully loaded at the same time, moreover the 
currents I2c and I3c will not be in phase at the same instant. Therefore, the primary winding is usually 
designed for a lower load than the sum of the rated powers of the secondary and tertiary windings.
Construction
In a three-winding transformer, there are three sets of windings (primary, secondary and tertiary) 
placed on the core. Three winding transformers may be either single three-phase units or three one-
phase units connected in a three-phase units placed in the same tank or three one-phase separate units 
connected in a three-phase bank. In this transformer, three windings are operated at three different 
voltages termed as high voltage, medium voltage and low voltage windings.
The two possible winding arrangements starting from core outwards are : (i) LV, MV and HV and 
(ii) MV, LV and HV as shown in Fig. 3.17.
In two-winding transformers, the kVA ratings of both the primary and the secondary windings 
are the same and same is the rating of transformer but it is not so in case of 3-winding transformers. 
The kVA rating of the 3-winding transformer is considered to be equal to the largest kVA rating of 
any of its windings (i.e., primary winding).
The rating of tertiary winding depends upon its intended application. If it is provided for supply 
of an additional load, the winding is designed and calculated on the same basis as the primary and 
secondary. When it is employed only for balancing of loads and controlling short-circuit currents, it 
carries current only for short-duration, and its rating depends mainly on its heat-capacity. In practice, 
the x-section of the winding wire is generally determined by the fault conditions irrespective of the fact 
for what application it is going to be used because it carries maximum current during this condition.

Equivalent Circuit
The equivalent circuit can be drawn where each winding is represented by its own resistance and leakage 
reactance referred to a common voltage (base voltage). The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 3.18, 
neglecting circuit. The resistances and reactances can be converted to per unit values on the basis of an 
assumed common or base kVA.

3.12.1 Stabilisation Provided by Tertiary Winding in Star-Star Transformer
Star-star transformers may comprise of single-phase units, or three-phase shell or five-limb core-type 
units. All these transformer units suffer from the following disadvantages:
(i) They cannot supply unbalanced loads between line and neutral, i.e., zero sequence loads. (ii) 
Their phase voltages may get distorted by third-harmonic emfs.
The reason is that mmf due to third-harmonic and zero sequence currents have an iron path.
The zero sequence impedance is so high between primary and secondary windings that it causes 
large voltage unbalancing. This can well be understood from Fig. 3.19(a). The single-phase load or fault 
current I2 tends to induce I1 in the corresponding primary winding (phase-A), but in the absence of 
a neutral the current I1 has to return through the other two phases B and C. The reactance of these 
windings, which is magnetising reactance here due to absence of their secondary currents, is very high.
Fig. 3.19(a) Distribution of currents in windings due to single-phase load or ground fault
The voltages of these phases B and C rise and become nearly equal to the primary line voltage. 
On the other hand, the voltage of the faulty or loaded phase A reduces to a very low value. It develops 
a serious voltage unbalancing.

Three-Phase Transformers 
261
By the use of a delta connected tertiary winding, zero sequence currents are provided with low 
reactance paths, this prevents the voltage unbalancing in case of unbalanced loads or ground faults. 
Figure 3.19(b) shows how currents are distributed in the windings of star-star-delta connected 
transformer in case of single-phase loads or faults. It is assumed that each winding has equal turns 
per phase. It is seen that no current has to encounter magnetising impedance magnetically linked 
balancing current paths are available. Thus voltage unbalancing is prevented.
Fig. 3.19 (b) Distribution of unbalanced current in winding when a connected tertiary is placed
The two disadvantages mentioned above are reduced to some extent in the three-limbs of core type 
transformers, because zero sequence flux is forced out of the core limb to high-reluctance air and 
tank leading to reduction in flux and zero sequence impedance thereby reducing voltage unbalance 
considerably. The third-harmonic flux also has similar high reluctance path and so magnitude of third 
harmonic flux is small. The distortion in voltage wave shape is small and transformer has more or 
less sinusoidal flux and emf when the input voltage is sinusoidal. It is nevertheless usual to provide 
a delta-connected tertiary even to the three-limb core type transformer if the primary and secondary 
are connected star-star. Further the third harmonic fluxes have been found to cause losses in tanks.

3.13 Tap-changers on Transformers
All the electrical equipments connected at the consumers end are designed to operate satisfactorily at 
a particular voltage level. Therefore, it is essential to supply the electrical energy to the consumers at 
a level which must fall within the prescribed limits. However, in the power system, due to change in 
load (may be seasonal or otherwise), the transformer output voltage on the consumer’s terminal may 
change beyond the permissible limits. This can be controlled by providing tap-changing transformers. 
Taps can be provided either on the primary or on the secondary.
Secondary output voltage can be regulated by either changing the number of turns in the primary 
or secondary on the basis of following principle.
Let V1, N1 and V2, N2 be primary and secondary quantities respectively. If N1 is decreased, the 
emf per turn on primary

increases which increases secondary terminal voltage

¯˜ . One the other hand, if N2 is increased keeping N1 constant, the secondary terminal 
voltage (V2 D N2) still increases.
Thus, secondary terminal voltage can be increased either by decreasing the primary turns or by 
increasing the secondary turns and vice-versa.

266
Electrical Machines
Choice between Primary and Secondary to provide Taps to Regulate Output 
Terminal Voltage of the Transformer
While selecting the side to provide taps to regulate secondary output voltage, we always try to maintain 
voltage per turn, as far as possible, constant. If the primary voltage per turn decreases, the core flux 
decreases which results in poor utilisation of core, although it reduces the core losses. On the other 
hand, if the primary voltage per turn increases, the core flux increases which results in magnetic 
saturation of the core. It also increases the core losses.
In the transformers located at the generating stations,the primary voltage has to be kept constant,
consequently the taps are provided on the secondary side. However, if transformers are energised 
from a variable source, as at the receiving end of a transmission line (receiving sub-stations), the 
taps are usually provided on the primary side.
The other factors which may also be taken into consideration are given below:
(i) Transformers with large turns ratio, are tapped on the HV side since this enables a smoother 
control of the output voltage. If in such transformers, the taps are provided on the LV side, it 
varies the output voltage to a large step which is usually undesirable.
(ii) Tap-changing gear provided on the HVside are to handle low currents, although more insulation 
has to be provided.
(iii) It is difficult to tap the LV winding, since it is placed next to the core. Whereas, the HVwinding, 
placed outside the LV winding, is easily accessible and can, therefore, be taped more easily.
3.14 Types of Tap-changers 
There are two types of tap-changers, called
(i) No-load (or off-load) tap-changers and
(ii) On load tap-changers
The working of these tap-changers is explained below with the help of schematic diagrams.
3.14.1 No-load (or Off-load) Tap-changer
These tap-changers are used for seasonal voltage variations. The schematic diagram of a no-load 
tap-changer is shown in Fig. 3.21(a). A winding is tapped and its leads are connected to six studs 
marked 1 to 6. The studs are stationary and are arranged in a circle. The face plate carrying the 
studs can be mounted any where on the transformer, say on the yoke or on any other convenient 
place (say a separate box). The rotatable arm ‘A’ is attached to a hand wheel which is kept outside 
the tank and can be rotated.
Sometimes, in case of large transformers, the rotatable arm is rotated with the help of a motor 
(with gear drive) and the controls of the motor are placed on the panel board although hand wheel 
is also provided for manual operation.
The active number of turns of the winding which remain in the circuit depends upon the position 
of rotating arm. If the winding is tapped at 2% interval, then ‘at various positions of the rotatable 
arm ‘A’, the winding in the circuit will be as under:

Three-Phase Transformers 
267
(i) at studs 1–2: Full winding is in the circuit.
(ii) at studs 2–3: 98% of the winding is in the circuit.
(iii) at studs 3–4: 96% of the winding is in the circuit.
(iv) at studs 4–5: 94% of the winding is in the circuit and
(v) at studs 5–6: 92% of the winding is in the circuit.
Fig. 3.21 (a) Off-load Tap-changer 
A stopper S is placed in between the stud 1 and 6. It fixes the final position of the arm ‘A’ at stud 
5–6. Moreover, it prevents the clockwise rotation of the arm ‘A’ from stud-1. It prevents the connections 
of stud 1 and 6 through arm ‘A’. If stud 1 and 6 are connected then only the lower part of the winding 
is cut out of circuit which is undesirable from mechanical-stress considerations.
In this case, the tap-changing is carried out only after the transformer is disconnected from the 
supply. For instance, let the arm ‘A’ is at stub 1 and 2 and the whole winding is in the circuit. Now, if 
we want to reduce the winding to 96%, we have to rotate the arm in anticlockwise direction to bridge 
stud 3 and 4 through arm ‘A’. While doing so, the transformer is disconnected from the supply, arm 
is rotated to the desired position and then the transformer is energised.
This tap-changer is never operated on load. If it would be operated on load, there would be heavy 
sparking at the studs when arm ‘A’ is separated from them. It may damage the tap-changer and the 
transformer winding.
3.14.2 On-load Tap-changer
This tap-changer is used for daily or short period voltage regulations. The output voltage can be 
regulated with the help of this tap-changer without any supply interruptions. During the operation 
of an on-load tap-changer the following points must be kept in mind;
(i) Never open the main circuit during the operation of tap-changer otherwise dangerous sparking 
will occur, and
(ii) No part of the tapped winding should get short circuited.
One form of an on-load tap-changer provided with a centre-tapped reactor is shown in Fig. 3.21( b). 
The function of the reactor is to prevent the short-circuiting of the tapped winding. The switches 1, 
2, 3, 4 and 5 are connected to the correspondingly marked taps.

268
Electrical Machines
During normal operation switch S is closed [see Fig. 3.21(b)], switches 2, 3, 4 and 5 are opened and 
switch 1 is closed. The entire winding is in the circuit. The two halves of the reactor carry half of the 
total current in opposite directions. Since the whole reactor is wound in the same direction, the mmf 
produced by the two halves is opposite to each other. Since these mmfs are equal, therefore, the net 
mmf is practically zero. Hence, the reactor is almost non-inductive and the impedance offered by it 
is very small, consequently, the voltage drop in the centre-tapped reactor is negligible.
Fig. 3.21 (b) On-load tap changer
When a change in voltage is required, the following sequence of operations is adopted.
(i) Open the switch S: By opening this switch, total current flows through the upper half of the 
reactor and there is more voltage drop. Since reactor is to carry full load current momentarily, 
the reactor must be designed accordingly.
(ii) Close the switch 2: When switch 2 is closed, the winding between taps 1 and 2 is connected 
across the reactor. Since the impedance offered by the reactor is high for a current flowing in 
only one direction, the local circulating current flowing through the reactor and tapped winding 
is quite small. 
Thus, reactor prevents the tapped winding from getting short circuited. The terminal voltage 
at this instant is mid-way between the potentials of tappings 1 and 2.
(iii) Open the switch I: The entire current now flows through the lower half of the reactor which 
causes more voltage drop.
(iv) Close the switch S: By closing the switch, current is divided equally in the upper and lower part 
of the reactor which causes almost negligible voltage drop.
The same sequence of operations is repeated if the tapping is to be changed from stud 2 to 3.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What is the necessity of parallel operation of three-phase transformers?
Ans. 
(i) It is desirable to place another transformer is parallel when the electrical load on the existing 
transformer increases beyond its rated capacity.
(ii) Parallel operation of transformers is necessary when the amount of power to be transformed is 
much more than that which can be handled by single unit (transformer).
(iii) It is desirable to do parallel operation of transformers if we want to keep the spare transformer of 
smaller size.
Q.2. What do you expect if star-delta transformer is connected in parallel with a star-star transformer?
Ans. The phasor displacement cannot be compensated and the transformers will come under direct short 
circuit condition.
Q.3. Why a tertiary winding is also called as auxiliary winding and stabilising winding?
Ans. The tertiary winding is called as an auxiliary winding when it is employed for supplying an additional 
small load at a different voltage. On the other hand, it is also called as stabilising winding when it is 
employed to limit the short-circuit current.
Q.4. What are on-load tap changing transformers?
Ans. No-load (or off-load) top-changer. These tap-changers are used for seasonal voltage variations. The 
schematic diagram of a no-load tap-changer is shown in Fig. Q.7). A winding is tapped and its leads 
are connected to six studs marked 1 to 6. The studs are stationary and are arranged in a circle. The 
face plate carrying the studs can be mounted anywhere on the transformer, say on the yoke or on any 
other convenient place (say a separate box). The rotatable arm ‘A’ is attached to a hand wheel which 
is kept outside the tank and can be rotated.
By changing the position of arm ‘A’, tapings can be changed or the voltage can be changed.

Electrical Machines

Q.5. Give limitations of on load tap changing transformer.
Ans. No-load tap changes is never operated on load. If it would be operated on load, there would be heavy 
sparking at the studs when arm ‘A’ is separated from them. It may damage the tap-changer and the 
transformer winding.
3.15 Transformation of Three-phase Power with Two Single-phase 
Transformers 
Three-phase power can be transformed by means of only two single phase transformers or by 
means of only two windings placed on primary and secondary of a three-phase transformer. This 
can be done by two methods, namely (i) Open-delta connection method and (ii) T-connection 
method. Both of these methods result in slightly unbalanced output voltage under load because of 
the unsymmetrical relations. However, this problem is not considered to be a serious problem in 
commercial transformers.
3.16 Open-Delta or V-V Connections 
The delta-delta connections of three transformers for a three-phase system are shown in Fig. 3.22(a). 
Let us suppose that in one of the transformers, a fault develops due to which it is removed. If the 
primaries are connected to three-phase supply as shown in Fig. 3.22(b) then three equal three-phase 
voltages will be available at the secondary terminals at no-load. This method of transforming three-
phase power by means of only two one-phase transformers is called open delta or Vee-Vee connections.
The basis of operation of open-delta connections is because of the fact that the vector sum of any 
two of the line voltages in a balanced three-phase system is equal to the third line voltage. Thus even 
though one of the transformer has been removed, the voltage between the terminals of the secondary 
to which load has been connected remains unchanged. The following are the points which favour 
the use of open-delta or vee-vee connections.

Three-Phase Transformers 
271
Fig. 3.22 Δ–Δ and open Δ connections
(i) When the three phase load is comparatively small, so that the installation does not warrant a 
three phase transformer bank.
(ii) When one of the transformers in a '-' bank fails, so that the service may be continued until 
the faulty transformer is repaired or good one is substituted.
(iii) In a new installation advantage is taken of the open-delta or Vee connections by installing initially 
only two transformers of the capacity to meet the present maximum demand. When the load on 
the system increases to the expected full load, a third transformer is added to close the delta.
Hence open-delta or Vee-connections are used when it is anticipated that in future load will 
increase necessitating the closing of the open-delta at some later stage.
The phasor diagram of an open delta or Vcc – Vcc connections is shown in Fig. 3.23.
It is important to note that the total load that can be handled by V-V connections is not two-third 
of the capacity of a delta-delta bank but is only 57.7% of it. Mathematically, it is proved as below:

Fig. 3.23 Phasor diagram for open delta connection
Note: It is assumed that the power factor in both the systems is same but in actual practice the 
power factor in the V-V connections is lesser than the actual power factor of the load.
The two transformers constitute 66.6 per cent of the installed capacity of the three, but they are 
able to deliver only 57.7% of the three in open delta connections. For example, if the three transformers, 
each having rating of 33.33 kVA are connected to form closed delta bank, the rating of the bank 
would be 100 kVA. But if one of these transformers is removed, the rating of the resulting open Δ 
bank is not 66.67 kVA, but it will be only 57.7 kVA. The total load that can be carried by an open 
delta transformer bank is not two-thirds of the capacity of a Δ²Δ bank, but it is only 57.7 percent of 
it. This is a reduction of about 14% 66 67

at which the two transformers operate when the load is of unity p.f.
If the transformer of B-phase is removed from the bank on each primary and secondary as shown in 
Fig. 3.24(a) the same line voltages VAB, VBC, VCA, Vab, Vbc and Vca will appear in the systems as Vbc = – 
(Vca + Vab). Obviously the same secondary phase voltages Van etc., will appear and there is no difficulty 
in supplying three-phase load. The balanced three-phase currents Ia, Ib, Ic are supplied to the load at 
a power factor of cos I lag [Fig. 3.24(b)]. The currents in the secondary windings are Iba = – Ib, Iac = 
Ic. On the primary side the line currents and winding currents are related as IB = – IAB, IC = ICA and
IA = – (IB + IC). It may be seen that one of the windings operates at a power factor of cos (30° + T) 
and the other at cos (30° – T).
Fig. 3.24 Open-delta connections and phasor diagram
The performance of two transformer connected in open delta will change as per the load p.f. as 
mentioned below:

274
Electrical Machines
(i) When the load p.f. is unity, the transformers operate at the same p.f.
P.f. of Transformer I = cos (30° – 0) = cos 30° = 0.866
P.f. of Transformer II = cos (30° + 0) = cos 30° = 0.866
∵
cos I = 1
?
I = 0
(ii) When the load power factor is 0.866, one transformer will operate at unity p.f. while the p.f. 
of the other will be 0.5.
p.f. of transformer I = cos (30° – 30°) where I = cos–1 0.866 = 30°
= cos 0° = unity 
p.f. of transformer II = cos (30° + 30°) = cos 60° = 0.5
(iii) When the load p.f. is 0.5, one transformer will operate at zero p.f. and delivers, no power, while 
the other, operating at a p.f. of 0.866, will take up the entire load.
p.f. of transformer I = cos (30° – 60)
cos–1 0.5 = 60°
= cos 30° = 0.866
p.f. of II = cos (30° + 60°) = cos 90° = 0
Note: Hence it shows that except for a balanced unity p.f. load, the two transformers in an open 
delta or V-V-bank operate at different power factors.

Where V and I are respectively the voltage of, and current in, the individual transformers, both 
on the same side i.e., primary or secondary.
A significant point in this connection is that the secondary terminal voltages tend to become 
unbalanced to a greater extent as the load is increased, this happens even when the load is perfectly 
balanced. This situation does not exist when the load is supplied by a bank of three transformers.
If the Vee-Vee connections are required to supply the same load on the three phase delta, it will 
be overloaded and winding may be damaged.
3.17 Comparison of Delta and Open Delta Connections 
(i) When similar transformers are used, the voltages given by the delta and Vee connections are 
the same and their outputs are proportional to their line currents.
(ii) In balanced delta connection the line current is 
3  of the phase current whereas in Vee-
connection the line current is the same as the phase current.

Three-Phase Transformers 
275
(iii) With non-inductive balanced load, each transformer of the delta connection carries one-third 
of the total load at unity power factor. Under the same conditions each transformer of Vee-
connection carries one half of the load at a p.f. 0.866.
(iv) The ratio of the power in Vee-Vee to Power in delta connection is 0.577.
3.18 T-T Connections or Scott Connections 
The other method of transformation of three-phase power from one circuit to another by using two 
transformers is T-T connections These connections were proposed by C.F. Scott therefore, these are 
frequently called as Scott connections. This scheme of connections is also used for three-phase to 
two-phase, and vice-versa transformation.
In this arrangement, two transformers are used. One of them must have at least two primary and 
two secondary coils so that a centre tap may be brought out from each side (or the transformer should 
have centre-tap primary and centre-tap secondary). This transformer is called main transformer. The 
other transformer must have primary and secondary windings having number of turns 0.866 times 
of the respective turns on the main transformer. This transformer is called teaser transformer. The 
current ratings of the two transformers should be the same. The connections are shown in Fig. 3.25(a). 
It may be noted that one end of both the primary and secondary of the teaser transformer are connected 
to the centre taps on both primary and secondary of the main transformers respectively whereas, 
the two ends of main transformer (A and B) and 86.6% tapping point (C) on teaser transformer are 
connected to the three-phase supply on the primary side. 
The two ends (a and b) of the secondary of main transformer and 86.6% tapping point (c) of 
secondary of teaser transformer are taken to connect the load, as shown in Fig. 3.25(a).
Fig. 3.25(a) Scott connections

276
Electrical Machines
Fig. 3.25(b) Phasor diagram of T-T connected transformer
Since primary and secondary of teaser transformer are connected to the centre tap of the primary 
and secondary of the main transformer respectively giving a shape of English letter ‘T’, as shown in 
Fig. 3.26 (a and b) the connections are known as T-T connections.
Let VAB, VBC and VCA be the applied voltages across the line terminals, then
VCD = VCA + VAD = V ±120° + 1
2 ±0° 
= V (– 0.5 + j 0.866) + 0.5 V = j 0.866 V = 0.8666 V ±90° 
…(3.19)
The above expression shows that voltage applied across the teaser is 0.866 times of that applied 
across the main and has a phase difference of 90°. If both the primary and secondary of the teaser 
transformer have 0.866 times of the respective turns on the main transformer, then the induced voltages 
in the secondary circuit will have same phase and magnitude relationship as that of applied voltages 
on the primary. Thus, the voltage induced in the teaser will be 0.866 times to that of induced voltage 
in the main transformer and has a phase difference of 90°. Consequently, a balanced 3-I system of 
voltages across points a, b and c will be available.
If V is the applied voltage which is also equal to the line voltage (VL) and I is current rating of the 
winding, which is also the line current (IL), the combined volt-ampere rating of the two transformers 
is VI + 0.866 VI i.e., 1.866 VI. The volt-amperes supplied are 
3VI , therefore, utility factor is 
3
/1.866 i.e., 0.928. Thus the T-T connections are more economical than open Δ connections which are 
having utility factor of 0.866. The two identical transformers with centre-tap and 86.6 tap may be 
used. This will provide interchangeability, but 13.14% of winding of teaser will remain idle. With 
identical transformers, the total volt-ampere capacity of the two transformers is 2VI and the utility 
factor is 0.866, the same as in case of open Δ system. This implies, therefore, that each transformer 
in a T-T connection must have a rating 15% greater than each of the transformers employed in a three 
transformer bank.

Three-Phase Transformers 
277
Fig. 3.26 T-T or Scott connections
For any balanced load of power factor cos I (lag), one of the two halves of the main transformer 
operates at a pf of cos (30° + I) and the other at cos (30° – I). This is similar to the condition as in 
open Δ. Mainly because of this (i.e., different loading effects) the voltages on the secondary side tend 
to become unbalanced to a greater extent with the increase in load.
It may be noted that this arrangement provides the three-phase, four-wire system. Three phase 
power loads may be connected between lines a, b and c while lighting load may be connected 
between ad and bd. There is a further advantage of availability of neutral on the teaser transformer. 
This permits a true three-phase four-wire system with the use of two transformers, which we could 
not get in open Δ system.
3.19 Conversion of Three-phase to Two-phase and vice-versa 
In some cases such as for electric furnaces, it is desirable to work with two-phase currents. From 
the power supply system, three-phase AC supply is available, therefore, it is necessary to convert 
three-phase supply to two-phase supply. This can be achieved by using Scott-connections. In these 

278
Electrical Machines
connections, two identical one-phase transformers are required, one of them must have centre tapped 
primary and secondary. The connections are made as shown in Fig. 3.27. 
Fig. 3.27 Transformer connections for conversion of three-phase to two-phase 
Since point D is located midway on AB, so VCD leads VAB by 90° i.e., voltages across the primaries 
of the transformer are 90° apart. It follows that the secondary voltages are 90° apart. With equal 
fluxes in the core, the secondary windings require an equal number of turns (say, N2) to give equal 
secondary voltages. Hence the two transformers have unequal ratios of transformation.

It is to be noted that point D is not the neutral point of the primary system, as its voltage with 
respect to line terminals A, B and C are not equal to V1
3
. Let N be such a point that the voltages 
from point N to points A, B and C are equal. Point N, therefore, is the neutral of the primary system.
The neutral point on the three phase side can be located on the teaser transformer. The neutral 
must have a voltage of V
3
i.e., 0.577 to C and since the voltage C to D is 0.866 V, the neutral point 
N will be 0.866 V – 5.77 V from D or 0.289 V i.e., a number of turns below D equivalent to 28.9 per 
cent of the primary turns in main transformer. Since 0.289 is one third of 0.866, the neutral point is 
one third the way down the teaser transformer winding from D to C or point N divides the teaser 
winding in the ratio of 1: 2.
For determination of primary currents let us neglect the magnetising current and consider load 
component currents I2M and I2T only.

Thus IA, IB and IC are equal in magnitude but are 120° apart from each other and so they give a 
balanced system.
Phasor diagram for voltages and currents, neglecting the transformer impedance and magnetising 
current, is shown in Fig. 3.28. The load currents are lagging behind their respective secondary 
voltages by an angle I. One half of the main transformer primary winding AB, has an angle of lag 
of (30° – I) while the other has angle of lag of (30° + I) where teaser primary has an angle of lag 
of I. This is the reason why the volt-ampere capacity of the primary winding of main transformer 
must be greater than that of its secondary.

3.20 Difference between Power and Distribution Transformers
In power system, the voltage level is raised at the generating station and it is decreased at the various 
sub-stations for economic reasons. The transformers used in the power system are called either power 
transformers or distribution transformers depending upon the duty performed by them. They basically 
differ from design point of view, as explained below:
(i) Power Transformers: These transformers are used to step up the voltage at the generating 
station for transmission purposes and then to step down the voltage at the receiving stations. 
These transformers are of large sizes (generally above 500 kVA). These transformers usually 
operate at high average load, which would cause continuous heavy copper loss, thus affecting 
their efficiency. To have minimum losses during 24 hours, such transformers are designed with 
low copper losses.
(ii) Distribution Transformers: These transformers are installed at the distribution sub-stations 
to step down the voltage. These transformers are continuously energised causing the iron losses 
for all the 24 hours, when generally the load fluctuates from no-load to full-load during this 
period. To obtain high efficiency, such transformers are designed with low iron losses.
3.21 Cooling of Transformers 
When a transformer is connected to the mains, heat is produced in the transformer due to various 
losses. This increases its temperature. In fact, output of the transformer is limited by the rise in 
temperature. Therefore, some means are provided to cool down the transformer so that the rise in 
temperature may not go beyond the permissible limits.
According to specifications, the rise in temperature of a transformer when working at the rated 
output shall not exceed 45°C to 60°C.
Most of the electrical machines have rotating part, therefore, it is easy to cool down such machines 
by providing fan on their shaft and ducts in their construction. But in case of transformers there is no 
rotating part, therefore, it is difficult to cool down the inner parts of a transformer. However, depending 

292
Electrical Machines
upon the size of a transformer, various methods have been evolved to dissipate heat produced in the 
transformer. These are mentioned below:
1. Natural Cooling
(a) Air Natural cooling (AN)
(b) Oil immersed Natural cooling (ON)
(c) Oil immersed Forced oil circulation Natural cooling (OFN)
2. Artificial Cooling (Air)
(a) Oil immersed Forced oil circulation with air Blast cooling (OFB)
(b) Oil immersed air Blast cooling (OB)
(c) Air Blast cooling (AB)
3. Artificial Cooling (Water)
(a) Oil immersed Water cooling (OW)
(b) Oil immersed Forced oil circulation with Water cooling (OFW)
4. Mixed Cooling
(a) Oil immersed Natural cooling with alternative additional air Blast cooling (ON/OB)
(b) Oil-immersed Natural cooling with alternative additional Forced oil circulation (ON/OFN)
(c) Oil-immersed Natural cooling with alternative additional Forced oil circulation air Blast 
cooling (ON/OFB)
(d) Oil-immersed Natural cooling with alternative additional forced oil circulation and Water 
cooling (ON/OFW)
3.22 Methods of Transformer Cooling 
Some of the common methods of transformer cooling are explained below:
1. Air Natural Cooling (AN)
Small transformers of a few kVA rating are cooled by the Natural air surrounding the core and 
winding of the transformer. The heat produced in the transformer due to losses dissipated by 
conduction, convection and radiation.
The transformers cooled by this method are used in laboratories and small appliances like 
radios, rectifiers etc.
2. Oil immersed Natural cooling (ON)
In this case, the assembly of core and winding (assembled unit) of a transformer is placed in a steel 
tank filled with pure insulating oil as shown in Fig. 3.33. The cooling is affected by natural circulation 
(convection currents) of the oil through the cooling ducts provided between coils and between coils 
and core.
For small transformers, the tanks are usually smooth surfaced but for large sizes the tanks 
are made of corrugated sheets as shown in Fig. 3.34. Sometimes fins are attached to the other 
surface as shown in Fig. 3.35 to improve cooling.
In most of the pole mounted transformers upto the rating of 200 kVA number of round or 
elliptical tubes are provided with the tank externally as shown in Fig. 3.36. The transformer 
oil has large coefficient of expansion, therefore, convection currents develop which cause the 

Three-Phase Transformers 
293
oil to circulate through the external tubes as shown in Fig. 3.36. The cooling can further be 
improved by using a radiator in place of external cooling tubes.
Fig. 3.33 Oil natural cooling 
Fig. 3.34 Corrugated tank
Fig. 3.35 Tank with fins
Fig. 3.36 Tank with cooling tubes
3. Oil immersed Forced oil-circulation Natural cooling (OFN)
In this type, core and coils are immersed in oil and the cooling is effected basically by forced 
oil circulation through motor driven oil pump as shown in Fig. 3.37. This method of cooling is 
one of the latest to be adopted and is employed with the radiators separately attached with the 
main tank of the transformer. A pump forces the oil through the ducts provided between winding 
and back to the radiators. The transformer tank in this case is also made plain, the radiators 
being relied upon to give necessary cooling.
4. Oil immersed Forced oil circulation with air Blast cooling (OFB)
This is achieved by means of fans blowing under the radiator as shown in Fig. 3.37. The radiators 
may be placed at some little distance from the transformer tank. Fans are placed under the 
radiators in such a way as to blow air through them and thus increases the cooling.
The method in which forced air cooling is adopted in addition to the oil-forced cooling is called 
OFB method i.e., oil immersed forced oil circulation with air blast cooling.
OFN method raises the rating by one-third and OFB by another third.

3.23 Power Transformer and its Auxiliaries 
The transformers used in the power system for transfer of electric power or energy from one circuit 
to the other are called power transformers. The rating of a transformer includes voltage, frequency 
and kVA. The kVA rating is the kVA output that a transformer can deliver at the rated voltage and 
frequency under general service conditions without exceeding the standard limit of temperature rise 
(usually 45º to 60ºC) The power transformer has the following important parts :
1. Magnetic circuit: The magnetic circuit comprises of transformer core. The transformer core 
may be core type or shell type in construction. The power transformers used in the power 
system are mostly three phase transformers. In a core type three-phase transformer core has 
three limbs of equal area of cross-section.
2. Electrical circuit: In three phase transformers there are three primary (H.V.) windings and 
three secondary (L.V.) windings. Whole of the L.V. winding is wound over one limb next to 
the core, then whole of the H.V. winding is wound over the L.V. winding. In between the L.V.
winding and H.V. winding and between core and L.V. winding insulation is provided.
3. Transformer oil: Transformer oil is a mineral oil obtained by fractional distillation of crude 
petroleum. The oil is used only in the oil cooled transformers. The oil not only carries the heat 
produced due to losses in the transformer, by convection from the windings and core to the 
transformer tank, but also has even more important function of insulation.
When transformer delivers power, heat is produced due to the iron and copper losses in the 
transformer. This heat must be dissipated effectively otherwise the temperature of the winding 
will increase. The raise in temperature further increases the losses. Thus, the efficiency of the 
transformer will decrease. As there is no rotating part in the transformer, it is difficult to cool 
down the transformer as compared to rotating machines. Various methods are adopted to cool 
down the transformers of different rating. The common methods are air natural cooling, oil 
immersed natural cooling, oil immersed forced oil circulation natural cooling, oil immersed 
forced oil circulation with air blast cooling, oil immersed forced oil circulation with water 
cooling etc.

Three-Phase Transformers 
295
Generally, for cooling of distribution transformers, oil immersed natural cooling method is adopted. 
Cooling tubes or small cooling radiators are used with the main tanks, as shown in Fig. 3.38, to 
increase the surface area for the dissipation of heat.
Fig. 3.38 Pictorial view of a 200 kVA, 11 kV/400 V oil immersed natural cooled distribution transformer
4. Tank Cover: A number of parts are arranged on the tank cover of which most important are :
(i) Bushing: The internal winding of the transformer are connected to the lines through copper 
rods or bars which are insulated from the tank cover, these are known as bushings. Upto 
33 kV ordinary porcelain bushing can be used. Above this voltage oil filled bushings or 
condenser bushing are employed.
(ii) Oil conservator tank: Oil conservator is also known as an oil expansion chamber. It is 
a small cylindrical air tight and oil tight vessel. The oil conservator is connected with a 
tube to the main transformer tank at the tank cover. This tank is partially filled with oil. 
The expansion and contraction of oil, changes the oil level in the conservator.
(iii) Breather: The transformer oil should not be allowed to come in contact with atmospheric 
air, since a small amount of moisture causes a great decrease in the dielectric strength of 
transformer oil. All the tank fittings are made air tight. When oil level in the oil conservator 
tank changes due to expansion and contraction of oil because of change of oil temperature, 
air moves in and out of the conservator. This action is known as breathing.
The breathed air is made to pass through an apparatus called breather to abstract moisture. 
Breather, contains Silica gel or some other drying agent such as calcium chloride. This 
ensures that only dry air enters the transformer tank.
(iv) Buchholz Relay: This is installed in between the main tank and the oil conservator. It is 
a gas relay which gives warning of any fault developing inside the transformer, and if the 
fault is dangerous, the relay disconnects the transformer circuit. This relay is installed in 
the transformer having capacity more than 750 kVA.
All the important parts of a 200 kVA, 11 kV/400 V oil immersed natural cooled distribution 
transformer are shown in Fig. 3.38.

3.24 Maintenance Schedule of a Transformer 
A power or distribution transformer when despatched from a factory, its tank is filled with oil upto 
a certain level in the conservation tank. Above the oil level, dry air or inert gas under pressure is 
filled. On receipt of the transformer, it is important to check the oil level and the dielectric strength 
of the oil which may be affected during transportation.
To check the electric strength of the oil, its sample is taken from near the top and bottom of the tank. 
The dielectric strength of the oil in no case should be lower than 30 kV for a 4 mm gap.
For a long trouble-free service, transformers should be given due attention regularly. For this 
purpose, a proper maintenance schedule of transformer has to be prepared. Different maintenance 
schedule is prepared for
(i) Attended indoor or outdoor transformers and (ii) Unattended outdoor transformers.
(i) Maintenance schedule for attended indoor or outdoor transformers.
The different checks employed on transformers are given below:
(a) Hourly check: Check oil temperature, winding temperature, ambient temperature, load and 
voltage after very hour.
The temperature is kept within the permissible limits by adjusting the load.
(b) Daily Check:
(i) Check oil level daily. If low, fill moisture free oil.
(ii) Check the colour of the silica gel in the breather daily. Its colour should be blue. If its 
colour is pink replace it.
(c) Quarterly check: Check the working of cooling fans and pumps quarterly. If not working 
properly, get them repaired.
(d) Half-yearly:
(i) Check dielectric strength, if below 30 kV for 4 mm then filter it or replace it.
(ii) Check bushes, insulators and cable boxes half-yearly. If found defective replace them.
(e) Yearly: (i) Check oil alarm circuits, relays, contacts, earth resistance and lightning arrestors.
(f) Five yearly:
(i) Carry out overall inspection of the transformer including lifting of coils and core.
(ii) Cleaning of transformer with moisture free transformer oil.
(ii) Maintenance schedule of outdoor transformers.
These transformers are checked after a certain period as given below:
(a) Quarterly:
(i) Check oil level and condition of silica gel.
(ii) Clean bushings, check conditions of switching and alarm circuits etc.
(b) Yearly:
(i) Check dielectric strength of oil.
(ii) Check earth resistance and lightning arrestors etc.
(c) Five-yearly:
(i) Carryout overall inspection of the transformer.
(ii) Cleaning of transformer with moisture free transformer oil.

3.25 Trouble Shooting of a Transformer 
For any type of internal fault of the transformer, the winding insulation and bushings are tested. For 
this insulation test between transformer winding and core or tank is carried out. Similarly, to test 
insulation of bushings, insulation test between each terminal of transformer and tank is carried out. 
When fault is located, it is removed.

(i) When similar transformers are used, the voltages given by the delta and Vee connections are the 
same and their outputs are proportional to their line currents.
(ii) In balanced delta connection the line current is 
3 of the phase current whereas in Vee-connection 
the line current is the same as the phase current.
(iii) With non-inductive balanced load, each transformer of the delta connection carries one-third of 
the total load at unity power factor. Under the same conditions each transformer of Vee-connection 
carries one half of the load at a p.f. 0.866.
(iv) The ratio of the power in Vee-Vee to Power in delta connection is 0.577.

Q.2. Why Scott connections are also known as T-connections? 
Ans. Since primary and secondary of teaser transformer are connected to the centre tap of the primary and 
secondary of the main transformer respectively giving a shape of English letter ‘T ’, as shown in Fig. 
Q.3 (a and b) the connections are known as T-T connections.
Fig. Q.3
Q.3. What is the function of a breather is a transformer?
Ans. Breather: The transformer oil should not be allowed to come in contact with atmospheric air, since a 
small amount of moisture causes a great decrease in the dielectric strength of transformer oil. All the 
tank fittings are made air tight. When oil level in the oil conservator changes, air moves in and out of 
the conservator. This action is known as breathing.
The breathed air is made to pass through an apparatus called breather to abstract moisture. Breather, 
contains Silica-gel or some other drying agent such as calcium chloride. This ensures that only dry air 
enters the transformer tank.

Introduction
A DC machine is an electro-mechanical energy conversion device. When it converts mechanical 
power (ZT) into DC electrical power (EI), it is known as a DC generator. On the other hand, when it 
converts DC electrical power into mechanical power it is known as a DC motor.
Although battery is an important source of DC electric power, but it can supply limited power. 
There are some applications where large quantity of DC power is required (such as in chemical and 
metal extraction plants, for electroplating and electrolysis processes etc.), at such places DC generators 
are used to deliver power.
In short, we can say that DC machines have their own role in the field of engineering. In this 
chapter, we shall focus our attention on the common topics of DC generators.
CHAPTER

Electrical Machines
4.1 DC Generator 
An electro-mechanical energy conversion device (or electrical machine) that converts mechanical 
energy or power (ZT) into DC electrical energy or power (EI) is called DC generator.
Fig. 4.1 Block diagram of electro-magnetic energy conversion (Generator action)
Working Principle
The basic principle of a DC generator is electro-magnetic induction i.e.,
“When a conductor cuts across the magnetic field, an emf is induced in it.”
(a) Linear motion of conductor in a uniform magnetic field 
(b) Coil rotating in a uniform magnetic field
Fig. 4.2 Generation of emf
Consider Fig. 4.2(a), here, when a conductor is moved vertically upward or downward, the deflection 
in the galvanometer clearly shows that an emf is induced in the conductor since flux is cut by the 
conductor. But, when it is moved horizontally (left or right), 
there is no deflection in the galvanometer which shows that 
no emf is induced in the conductor since flux cut is zero and 
conductor moves just parallel to the magnetic lines of force.
In fact, in a generator, a coil is rotated at a constant speed 
of Z radians per second in a strong magnetic field of constant 
magnitude as shown in Fig. 4.2(b). An emf is induced in the 
coil by the phenomenon of dynamically induced emf (e =
Fig. 4.2(c) Wave shape of induced emf

DC Generator 
303
Blv sin T; e v sin T). The magnitude and direction of induced emf changes periodically depending 
upon sine of angle T. The wave shape of the induced emf is shown in Fig. 4.2(c), which is AC for 
internal as well as external load. 
This AC is converted into DC with the help of commutator, as explained in the Articles to follow.
Thus, the working principle of a DC generator is electro-magnetic induction.
4.2 Main Constructional Features 
The complete assembly of various parts in a scattered form of a DC machine is shown in Fig. 4.3. 
The essential parts of a DC machine are described below:
Fig. 4.3 Disassembled parts of a DC machine
1. Magnetic Frame or Yoke
The outer cylindrical frame to which main poles and inter poles are fixed is called yoke. It also helps 
to fix the machine on the foundation. It serves two purposes:

304
Electrical Machines
(i) It provides mechanical protection to the inner parts of the machine.
(ii) It provides a low reluctance path for the magnetic flux.
The yoke is made of cast iron for smaller machines and for larger machines, it is made of cast steel 
or fabricated rolled steel since these materials have better magnetic properties as compared to cast iron.
2. Pole Core and Pole Shoes
The pole core and pole shoes are fixed to the magnetic frame or yoke by bolts. They serve the 
following purposes:
(i) They support the field or exciting coils.
(ii) They spread out the magnetic flux over the armature periphery more uniformly.
(iii) Since pole shoes have larger X-section, the reluctance of magnetic path is reduced.
(a) Field winding placed around pole core 
(b) Field winding
Fig. 4.4 Pole core, pole shoe and field winding
Usually, the pole core and pole shoes are made of thin cast steel or wrought iron laminations 
which are riveted together under hydraulic pressure as shown in Fig. 4.4(a).
3. Field or Exciting Coils
Enamelled copper wire is used for the construction of field or exciting coils. The coils are wound on 
the former [see Fig. 4(b)] and then placed around the pole core as shown in Fig. 4(a). When direct 
current is passed through the field winding, it magnetises the poles which produce the required flux. 
The field coils of all the poles are connected in series in such a way that when current flows through 
them, the adjacent poles attain opposite polarity as shown in Fig. 4.5.
4. Armature Core
It is cylindrical is shape and keyed to the rotating shaft. At the outer periphery slots are cut, as shown 
in Fig. 4.6, which accommodate the armature winding. The armature core shown in Fig. 4.6, serves 
the following purposes:

DC Generator 
305
(i) It houses the conductors in the slots.
(ii) It provides an easy path for magnetic flux.
Since armature is a rotating part of the machine, reversal of flux takes place in the core, 
hence hysteresis losses are produced. To minimise these losses silicon steel material is used for 
its construction. When it rotates, it cuts the magnetic field and an emf is induced in it. This emf 
circulates eddy currents which results in eddy current loss in it. To reduce these losses, armature 
core is laminated, in other words we can say that about 0.3 to 0.5 mm thick stampings are used for its 
construction. Each lamination or stamping is insulated from the other by varnish layer (see Fig. 4.6).
Fig. 4.5 Magnetic circuit of DC machine 
Fig. 4.6 Armature core
5. Armature Winding
The insulated conductors housed in the armature slots are suitably connected. This is known as 
armature winding. The armature winding acts as the heart of a DC machine. It is a place where one 
form of power is converted to the other form i.e., in case of generator, mechanical power is converted 
into electrical power and in case of motor, electrical power is converted into mechanical power. On 
the basis of connections, there are two types of armature windings named (i) Lap winding and (ii) 
Wave winding (detailed discussions in the coming articles).
(i) Lap winding: In this winding, the connections are such that the number of parallel paths is 
equal to number of poles. Thus, if machine has P poles and Z armature conductors, then there 
will be P parallel, paths, each path will have Z/P conductors in series. In this case, the number 
of brushes is equal to the number parallel paths. Out of which half the brushes are positive and 
the remaining (half) are negative.
(ii) Wave winding: In this winding, the connections are such that the numbers of parallel paths are 
only two irrespective of the number of poles. Thus, if machine has Z armature conductors, there 
will be only two parallel paths each having Z/2 conductors in series. In this case, the number 
of brushes is equal to two i.e., number of parallel paths.

306
Electrical Machines
6. Commutator
It is an important part of a DC machine and serves the following purposes:
(i) It connects the rotating armature conductors to the stationary external circuit through brushes.
(ii) It converts the alternating current induced in the armature conductors into unidirectional current 
in the external load circuit in generator action, whereas, it converts the alternating torque into 
unidirectional (continuous) torque produced in the armature in motor action.
The commutator is of cylindrical shape and is made up of wedge-shaped hard drawn copper 
segments. The segments are insulated from each other by a thin sheet of mica. The segments are 
held together by means of two V-shaped rings that fit into the V-grooves cut into the segments. Each 
armature coil is connected to the commutator segment through riser. The sectional view of the 
commutator assembly is shown in Fig. 4.7.
Fig. 4.7 Commutator
7. Brushes
The brushes are pressed upon the commutator and form the connecting link between the armature 
winding and the external circuit. They are usually made of high grade carbon because carbon is 
conducting material and at the same time in powdered form provides lubricating effect on the 
commutator surface. The brushes are held in particular position around the commutator by brush 
holders and rocker.
8. Brush Rocker
It holds the spindles of the brush holders. It is fitted on to the stationary frame of the machine with nut 
and bolts. By adjusting its position, the position of the brushes over the commutator can be adjusted 
to minimise the sparking at the brushes.
9. End Housings
End housings are attached to the ends of the main frame and support bearings. The front housing 
supports the bearing and the brush assemblies whereas the rear housing usually supports the bearing 
only.

DC Generator 
307
10. Bearings
The bearings may be ball or roller bearings these are fitted in the end housings. Their function is to 
reduce friction between the rotating and stationary parts of the machine. Mostly high carbon steel 
is used for the construction of bearings as it is very hard material.
11. Shaft
The shaft is made of mild steel with a maximum breaking strength. The shaft is used to transfer 
mechanical power from or to the machine. The rotating parts like armature core, commutator, cooling 
fan etc. are keyed to the shaft.
4.3 Simple Loop Generator and Function of Commutator 
For simplicity, consider only one coil AB placed in the strong magnetic field. The two ends of the coil 
are joined to slip rings Ac and Bc respectively. Two brushes rest on these slip rings as shown in Fig. 4.8.
Fig. 4.8 Generated emf for external circuit connected through slip rings
When this coil is rotated in counter clockwise direction at an angular velocity of Z radius per 
second, the magnetic flux is cut by the coil and an emf is induced in it. The position of the coil 
at various instants is shown in Fig. 4.8(a) and the corresponding value of the induced emf and its 

308
Electrical Machines
direction is shown in Fig. 4.8(b). The induced emf is alternating and the current flowing through the 
external resistance is also alternating i.e., at second instant current flows in external resistance from 
M to L, whereas, at fourth instant it flows from L to M as shown in Fig. 4.8(b).
Commutator Action
Now, consider that the two ends of the coil are connected to only one slip ring split into two parts 
(segment) i.e., As and Bs. Each part is insulated from the other by a mica layer. Two brushes rest on 
these parts of the ring as shown in Fig. 4.9(a).
In this case when the coil is rotated is counter clockwise direction at an angular velocity of Z
radians per second, the magnetic flux is cut by the coil and an emf is induced in it. The magnitude 
of emf induced in the coil at various instants will remain the same as shown in Fig. 4.8(b).
However, the flow of current in the external resistor or circuit will become unidirectional i.e., 
at second instant the flow of current in the external resistor is from M to L as well as the flow of 
current in the external resistor is from M to L in the fourth instant, as shown in Fig. 4.9(a). Its wave 
shape is shown in Fig. 4.9(b).
Fig. 4.9 Generated emf for external circuit connected through split ring
Hence, an alternating current is converted into unidirectional current in the external circuit with 
the help of a split ring (i.e., commutator).
In an actual machine, there are number of coils connected to the number of segments of the ring 
called commutator. The emf or current delivered by these coils to the external load is shown in 
Fig. 4.10(a). The actual flow of current flowing in the external load is shown by the firm line which 
fluctuates slightly. The number of coils placed on the armature is even much more than this and a 
pure direct current is obtained at the output as shown in Fig. 4.10(b).

DC Generator 
309
Thus, in actual machine working as a generator, the function of commutator is to convert the 
alternating current produced in the armature into direct current in the external circuit.

4.4 Connections of Armature Coils with Commutator Segments 
and Location of Brushes 
Consider an armature which has four coils 1, 2, 3 and 4 equally spaced in the armature slots as shown 
in Fig. 4.11. The number of commutator segments is equal to number of coils. When the armature 
is rotated clockwise, the direction of induced emf and hence the current in coil sides 3c, 1, 4c, 2 is 
downward and in coil sides 1c, 3, 2c, 4 is upward. The coils should be connected in such a way that 
the emf induced in the two sides of the same coil be added up as shown in Fig. 4.12, The coil sides 
1–4c, 1c–2, 2c–3 and 3c–4 are connected to the commutator segments namely 1, 2, 3 and 4 as shown 
in Fig. 4.13.

Electrical Machines
Fig. 4.13 Developed windings diagram for 2-pole, 4-coil, 4-segment DC machine.
The next point of discussion is to determine how many brush sets are required and where these are 
to be placed with respect to the poles. The brushes are to collect or deliver the current and arc placed 
at such a position that sparking is minimum at the brushes. The rules to be followed for determining 
the position of brushes are given below:
(i) Place the brush at each meeting point or each separating point of two emf’s. The brushes at the 
meeting point are of positive polarity and those at the separating point are of negative polarity. 
At segment 1, current is separated towards conductor 1 and 4c, hence it is a separating point. 
Whereas, current is coming towards segment 3 from conductor 2c and 3, hence it is a meeting 
point. So, the commutator segment 1 is the position of negative brush and commutator segment 
3 of the positive brush.
(ii) Brushes are generally equally spaced and placed directly opposite to the pole centres. This brings 
out a very important point, namely, that in certain positions of the commutator the brushes will 
be actually short circuiting the coils connected to the segments with which they are in contact 
(Fig. 4.14). In this case only two coils are short circuited, which is taking place continuously 
and as such the width of brushes must be greater than the thickness of the mica insulation 
between segments. However, for representation, the general convention is to place the brushes 
at geometrical neutral plane (G.N.P.). All conductors above the brush axis carry current in 
one direction and all conductors below the brush axis carry current in the opposite direction. 
This convention represents that the brushes are placed at the coil or coils in which the voltage 
induced is zero.
The actual position of the brushes is shown in Figs. 4.14, 4.15 and 4.16. These figures also show the 
position of coil sides and the direction of currents after the coils 2 and 4 undergo commutation. The 
negative brush short circuits the segments 1 and 4 whereas positive brush short circuit the segments 
2 and 3. The coils 4 and 2 are short circuited by the brushes and hence no emf should induce in these 
coils. The armature winding forms a closed circuit and consists of two parallel paths. When a coil 

DC Generator 
311
under goes commutation no emf is induced in it since it passes through magnetic neutral axis (MNA), 
and the coil is short-circuited by the brushes, hence no sparking will take place.

4.5 Armature Winding 
At the outer periphery of an armature core, slots are cut. In these slots number of conductors are 
placed which are connected with each other in proper arrangement forming series–parallel paths 
depending upon the requirement. This arrangement of connections is known as armature winding. To 
understand the armature winding schemes, it is desirable to have an idea about the following terms.
1. Conductor: The length of wire embedded in armature core and lying within the magnetic field 
is called the conductor (see Fig. 4.17(a), where AB is a conductor). It may be having one or more 
parallel strands. Total number of conductors in the armature winding are represented by the 
symbol Z.

312
Electrical Machines
2. Turn: Two conductors lying in a magnetic field connected in series at the back, as shown in 
Fig. 4.17(a), so that emf induced in them is additive is known as a turn.
Fig. 4.17 Representation of a coil.
3. Coil. A coil may be a single turn coil having only two conductors, as shown in Fig. 4.17(a), or 
it may be a multi-turn coil having more than two conductors as shown in Fig. 4.17(b). In Fig. 
4.17(b), a three-turn coil is shown. The bunch of three conductors may be wrapped by the cotton 
tape, as shown in Fig. 4.17(c), before placing in the slot of armature. A multi-turn coil can be 
represented by single line diagram as shown in Fig. 4.17(d). Multi-turn coils are used to develop 
higher voltages. When the armature conductors are more, it is not feasible to use single turn 
coils because it will require large number of commutator segments and if used it will not give 
spark-less commutation. Moreover, it will not be economical due to use of more copper in the 
end connections. The total number of coils in the armature winding are represented by symbol 
‘C’.
4. Coil side. Each coil (single turn or multi-turn) has two sides called coil sides. Both the coil 
sides are embedded in two different slots as per the winding design (nearly a pole pitch apart).
5. Coil group. A group of coils may have one or more coils.
6. Winding. When number of coil groups are arranged on the armature in a particular fashion as 
per the design, it is called an armature winding.
7. Inductance effect. All the coils have some inductance effect as current is changing in them. 
Due to inductance effect the flow of current is opposed causing reduction in resultant output 
voltage. Over-hanging end connections have some adverse effect due to inductance.
Terms Related to Winding Design
8. Front-end and Back-end connectors. A wire that is used to connect end of a coil at the front 
to the commutator segment is called a front-end connector.
Whereas, a wire that is used to connect one coil side to the other coil side at the back is called 
back-end connector.

DC Generator 
313
9. Pole pitch. In general, it is defined as number of armature slots per pole. It may also be defined 
as the number of armature conductors per pole. If there are 36 conductors for 4 poles then pole 
pitch will be equal to 36/4 i.e., 9 conductors per pole.
10. Back pitch. The distance in terms of number of armature conductors between first and last 
conductor of the same coil i.e., the distance between two coil sides of the same coil is called 
back pitch. It is also called the coil span or coil spread and is denoted by Yb, as shown in Figs. 
4.18(a), (b) and (c)
Fig. 4.18 Terms used in coils
11. Front pitch. The distance in terms of number of armature conductors or number of slots between 
second conductor of one coil and the first conductor of the next coil which are connected to the 
same commutator segment on the front is called front pitch. It is denoted by YF, as shown in 
Figs. 4.18 (a), (b) and (c).
12. Resultant pitch. The distance in terms of number of armature conductors or number of slots 
between the start of one coil and the start of the next coil to which it is connected is called 
resultant pitch. It is denoted by YR as shown in Figs. 4.18(a), (b) and (c).
13. Commutator pitch. The distance measured in terms of commutator segments between the 
segments to which the two ends of a coil are connected is called commutator pitch. It is denoted 
by YC as shown in Figs. 4.18(a), (b) and (c).
14. Coil span or coil pitch. The distance in terms of number of armature conductors or number 
of slots between two sides of the same coil is called coil span or coil pitch.
The coil span may be equal to, less than or more than pole pitch. Accordingly, the coils are 
knows as full pitched, short pitched or over pitched coils respectively.
For instance, consider Fig. 4.19. where pole pitch is say 4. One side of coil-A is placed is slot 
No. 1 and the other side is placed in slot No. 5, then the coil span is 5-1 = 4 which is equal to 
pole pitch hence coil-A is called a full-pitched coil. Whereas, in case of coil-B, the coil span is 
6–3 = 3 which is less than pole pitch, this coil is called a short pitched coil.

314
Electrical Machines
Fig. 4.19: Full-pitch and short-pitch winding
When the coils are full pitched, the induced emf in a coil is the arithmetic sum of the emfs 
induced in two sides of the same coil since the coil sides are displaced by 180° electric al. In 
this case, the two sides of the same coil are placed at similar position of two adjacent poles 
(North and South).
In case of short pitched and over pitched coils, the resultant induced emf is reduced because the 
two sides would fall under the influence of the same pole at some instant. At this instance the 
induced emf in the two sides will oppose each other causing reduction in resultant emf (phasor 
difference).
The advantage of short pitched winding is that in this case the copper used for end connections 
is reduced substantially which reduces the cost of machine. If also improves the commutation 
(reduction of sparking at brushes) because inductance of overhang connections is reduced. 
Moreover, it reduces the copper losses and improves the efficiency to some extent. Hence, many 
a times short pitched winding is used.
15. Degree of Re-entrant of an armature winding. There can be single re-entrant or multi re-
entrant armature winding. While tracing through a winding once, if all armature conductors 
are included on returning to the starting point, the winding is called single re-entrant winding. 
It will be double re-entrant if only half of the conductors are included in tracing through the 
winding once.
4.6 Types of Armature Winding 
The continuous or closed armature windings are of two types:
1. Gramme-ring winding 
2. Drum Winding
The gramme-ring type of armature winding is an early form of armature winding. This winding 
is replaced by more efficient drum type winding. The gramme-ring type of armature winding was 
having following disadvantages.

DC Generator 
315
Disadvantages
(i) Only half the coil was available to link with the pole flux. The other half of the portion of 
winding was lying inside the core which was used only as connectors and so there was wastage 
of copper.
(ii) As each turn was to pass through the centre of the core, therefore, it was difficult to wind and 
require more labour, hence was costlier.
(iii) The maintenance and repairs were more costly.
(iv) Insulation of winding was also difficult.
(v) For the same pole flux and armature velocity the emf induced in ring winding was half of that 
induced in the drum winding having same number of coils.
(vi) Construction was having a large air gap, so stronger field excitation was required to produce 
the required flux.
4.7 Drum Winding 
In this type of winding, the conductors are housed in slots cut over the armature surface and connected 
to one another at the front and back through connectors. It has the following two main advantages.
1. Whole of the copper used is active except end connectors, i.e., it cuts flux and, therefore, is 
active in generating emf.
2. The coils can be pre-formed and insulated before placing on the armature, which reduces the 
construction cost.
The drum winding may be either single layer or double layer winding. In single layer winding, only 
one conductor or one coil side is placed in each armature slot. It is rarely used because of its more cost.
In two-layer winding, as shown in Fig. 4.20, there are two conductors or coil sides per slot arranged 
in two layers. Mostly it is employed because of economy reasons. These coils are usually are wound 
on machine driven formers which give them proper shape. The turns may be bound together with 
cotton tape. The ends are left bare to solder them to the commutator segments. The coils are then 
dipped into some insulating compound such as asphalt and are then dried. If the machine is to be 
operated at high temperatures, other materials, such as mica and paper tape, fibre glass tape, and 
silicon impregnated insulation may be used.
Before placing the coils in the slots, liners of leatheroid are placed to ensure mechanical protection 
is provided to the coils. After dropping the coils into the slots, wedges of wood or hard fibre are 
driven to hold them in place, as shown in Figs. 4.20(a) and (b).
To obtain maximum voltage a full pitched winding is used. However, the span may be reduced 
to as much as eight-tenth of the pole pitch without any serious reduction in the induced emf. When 
this is done, the winding is called short pitch (or fractional pitch) winding.
Usually, one side of every coil lies in the top of one slot and the other side lies in the bottom 
of some other slot at a distance of approximately one pole pitch along the armature. Thus, at least 
two coil sides occupy each slot. Such windings, in which two coil sides occupy each slot are most 
commonly used for all medium sized machines. In case of large machines, more coil-sides can be 
placed in a single slot as shown in Figs. 4.20(b) and 4.20(d). Placing of several elements in a single 
slot gives fewer slots than segments which have got following advantages.

316
Electrical Machines
(i) By providing more conductors in one slot, the number of slots decreases. As the number of slots 
is reduced the armature core teeth become mechanically stronger to bear the stresses.
(ii) In this arrangement, the number of commutator segments is increased, the voltage between 
segments adjacent to each other decreases and the number of turns of wire in the coil or coils 
connected to adjacent segments also decreases. The result is that there is less sparking at the 
commutator because of the improved commutation.
(iii) The overall cost of construction is reduced.
In general there are two types of drum type armature windings: (i) lap winding (ii) wave windings.
(a) Two conductors per slot 
(b) Six conductors per slot
(c) Two conductors per slot 
(d) Four conductors per slot
Fig. 4.20 Double-layer winding
4.8 Lap Winding 
Single turn lap winding is shown in Figs. 4.21(a) and (b). In lap winding a coil side under one pole is 
connected directly to the coil side of another coil which occupies nearly the corresponding position 
under the next pole and the finish end of other coil is connected to a commutator segment and to 
the start end of the adjacent coil situated under the same pole and all coils are connected similarly 
forming a closed loop. Since the sides of successive coils overlap each other, it is called a lap winding. 
Lap winding may be further classified as a simplex (single) or multiplex (double or triple) windings.
Simplex lap winding: In this winding, there are as many parallel paths as there are field poles on 
the machine.
Double or duplex lap winding: In this case, two similar simplex windings are placed in alternate 
slots on the armature and connected to alternate commutator segments. Thus, each winding carries 
half of the armature current.

DC Generator 
317
Fig. 4.21 Lap winding connections
Triple or triplex lap winding: In this case, three similar simplex windings are placed to occupy every 
third slot and connected to every third commutator segment. Thus, each winding carries one third 
of the armature current. Similarly, there can be multiplex lap winding having even more than three 
simplex winding as per the requirement.
The above explanation clearly shows that the sole purpose of employing multiplex lap winding is 
to increase the number of parallel** paths enabling the armature to carry a large total current, at the 
same time reducing the conductor current to improve commutation conditions.
Following points regarding lap winding should be carefully noted:
1. The back and front pitches must be odd. But they cannot be equal. They differ by 2 or some 
multiple thereof.
2. The coil or back pitch YB must be nearly equal to a pole pitch Z
P( ).
3. The average pitch YA = Y
Y
B
F
+
2
. It is equal to pole pitch = Z
P .
4. Commutator pitch YC = ± 1 for simplex winding (in general, YC = ± m where m is the multiplicity 
of winding)
5. Resultant pitch YR is always even, being the arithmetical difference of two odd numbers, i.e.,
YR = YB – YF. It is equal to 2 m where m is multiplicity of winding.
6. For a two-layer winding, the number of slots and number of commutator segments are equal to 
the number of coils (i.e., half the number of coil sides).
7. The number of parallel paths in the armature = mP where m is the multiplicity of winding and 
P the number of poles.
Taking the first condition, we have YB = YF ± 2.
* In duplex lap winding the number of parallel circuits is twice the number of poles and in triplex lap winding, the number 
of parallel circuits is three times the number of poles.

318
Electrical Machines
(a) If YB > YF i.e., YB = YF + 2, then we get a progressive or right-handed winding i.e., a winding which 
progresses in the clockwise direction when we look towards the commutator end. Obviously, 
YC = +1, in this case.
(b) In case YB < YF i.e., YB = YF – 2, we get a retrogressive or left-handed winding i.e., a winding 
which advances in the anti-clockwise direction just opposite to the previous case. In this case, 
YC = –1.

4.9 Numbering of Coils and Commutator Segments in Developed 
Winding Diagram 
The developed winding diagram can be obtained by removing the armature periphery, cutting it along 
the slot and laying it out flat so that the slots and conductors can be viewed to trace out the armature 
winding. While drawing developed winding diagrams, we will designate only the coil sides with 
number (not individual turns). The upper side of the coil will be represented by a firm continuous 
line, whereas the lower side will be represented by a dotted line. The consecutive number i.e., 1, 2, 
3,….. etc. will be assigned to the coil sides such that odd numbers are assigned to the top conductors 
and even numbers to the lower sides for a two-layer winding. The commutator segments will also 
be numbered consecutively, the number of the segments will be equal to the number of coils and the 
upper side will be connected to it.
The readers will be able to understand how to develop armature winding diagram by going through 
the following examples:

4.10 Characteristics of a Simplex Lap Winding 
From the above examples it is concluded that
1. A simplex lap winding is a singly re-entrant closed winding because winding may start from any 
coil side (here it starts from coil side No. 1) returns back to the same coil side after connecting 
all the coil sides of the armature once and only once.
2. Both back pitch (YB) and front pitch (YF) of all the coils remain the same and odd number.
3. Total number of brushes is equal to the number of poles. These brushes are connected to the 
coil sides which lie in between the poles and have no emf induced in them at that particular 
instant.
4. There are as many parallel paths in the armature as the number of poles (see Fig. 4.27). That 
is why such a winding is also known as ‘Multiple Circuit’ or ‘parallel’ winding.
In general, number of parallel paths in armature, A = mP where m is the multiplicity of the lap 
winding. For simplex lap winding m = 1 (? A = P), for duplex lap winding m = 2 and so on.
5. The emf developed across the positive (+ve) and negative (–ve) brushes is equal to the emf 
generated in any one of the parallel paths.
Generated emf, Eg = emf generated per parallel path
= Average emf/coil side × Z
P
where Z
P is the number of coil sides connected in series per parallel path.
6. If l is the length of each armature conductor (or coil side), including overhang, a is the area of 
cross-section and U is the resistivity of conductor material, then

Resistance of each conductor (or coil side) = r l

each slot having 2 coil sides. Indicate the direction of motion, position of poles, position of brushes

4.11 Characteristics of a Multiplex Lap Winding 
From the winding diagram for duplex lap winding, the following conclusions have been drawn:
1. There are two independent winding, each closed on 
itself. Accordingly, the winding is said to be a doubly 
re-entrant duplex winding.
It is important to note that that in duplex winding, if 
the coils are not multiple of 2, there will not be two 
independent windings and in such cases, the winding 
will close only once, then it is known as singly re-
entrant duplex winding.
Similarly, for triplex winding, the number of coils 
must be a multiple of 3 and so on.
2. Total number of brushes is equal to the number 
of poles but each brush must have a span of two 
commutator segments to collect current provided 
by two windings, as shown in Fig. 4.28. Similarly, 
for triplex winding each brush must have a span of 
three segments and so on.
3. The number of parallel paths for each winding is 
equal to the number of poles (i.e., 6 in this case). 
Therefore, total number of parallel paths for the 
armature is mP where m is the multiplicity, in this 
case m = 2, therefore the number of parallel paths = 
2 × 6 = 12, as shown in Fig. 4.31.
4. The number of conductors in each parallel path are Z/mP (here m = 2)
In this case, No. of conductors connected in series in each parallel path, say,
ZS = Z
mP =
¥
=
48

5. It is obvious that multiplex lap winding is used in the machines where we require high current 
to be delivered at small voltages.
4.12 Equalising Connections and their Necessity 
In simplex lap winding, the number of parallel paths are equal to the number of poles and all the 
conductors of any one parallel path lie under one pair of poles. If the flux produced by all the poles 
is exactly the same, the emf induced in each parallel path and hence the current carried by each one 
of them will be equal. But in spite of best efforts, this condition cannot be obtained due to different 
properties of steel used for construction of poles and variation of air-gap between the poles and 
armature. Hence, there is always a slight difference in the induced emf in various parallel paths 
which results in large circulating currents in the armature winding. This circulating current flows 
Fig. 4.31 Parallel paths

328
Electrical Machines
from one parallel path to the other from one commutator segment to the other through brushes. This 
circulating current has the following ill-effects:*
1. Armature circulating current heats-up the armature winding.
2. It causes heavy sparking at the brushes which not only heats-up the machine but also causes 
undue burning and wear of commutator and brushes. If it is carried too far, it may result in 
flash over from positive to negative brushes.
To overcome this detrimental effect, usually, equalising connections are provided in all lap-wound 
armatures. These connections are made with the help of very low resistance (almost zero) wires 
called equalisers.
Fig. 4.32 Developed winding diagram
An equaliser is a copper wire having very low resistance and is used to connect the points of 
different parallel paths of armature winding which should have same potential under ideal conditions. 
These equaliser rings carry the circulating current and relieve the brushes to carry these circulating 
current. Under this condition, the brushes are to carry only the load current.
For making equaliser connections, the number of coils should be multiples of the number of poles 
and at the same time, the number of coils per pole should be divisible by a small number 2, 3 or 4.
* The current flowing in various paths may also differ due to difference in their resistances, but this would not pose 
serious effects. 

DC Generator 
329
For instance, consider a four-pole, 16-slot double layer, lap wound armature winding having 32 
coil sides. Its developed winding diagram is shown in Fig. 4.32. Here, the number of coil sides per 
pole are 8. The equaliser connections are shown in Fig. 4.32. The following points are worth noting:
1. That every 3rd coil is connected to an equaliser. Each coil-side (or coil) connected to the equaliser 
occupies the same position relative to the poles such that same emf is induced in all the coils 
at every instant.
2. The number of connections to each equalising ring is equal to the number of pair of poles.
3. The number of equalising rings is equal to the number of coils under one pair of poles (i.e., 
8/2 = 4).
4. Here, alternate coils have been connected to the equalising ring and as such it is said that the 
winding is equalised by 50%. If all the coils would have been connected to the equalisers it 
would have been said that the winding is 100% equalised.
Example 4.4
A six-pole DC armature with lap connected winding has 72 slots and 2 coil-sides per slot. Determine 
the winding pitches and connections to the 6 equalising rings.
Solution:

4.13 Simplex Wave Winding 
A simplex* wave winding is shown in Fig. 4.33. In lap 
winding a coil side under one pole is connected directly to a 
coil side at the back which occupies almost corresponding 
positioned coil side under the next pole and the finish 
end of that coil is connected to a commutator segment 
and to the start end of the adjacent coil situated under 
the same original pole. But in the wave winding the coil 
side is not connected back rather progresses forward to 
another coil side placed under the next pole, as shown 
in Fig. 4.33. In this way, the winding progresses, passing 
successively every North and South pole till it returns to 
the coil side from where it was started. It clearly shows 
that the connections of wave winding always progresses 
in the same direction around the armature instead of 
moving forward and backward alternately like that of lap 
winding. As the shape of winding is wavy, it is named as 
wave winding.
The wave winding may be classified as progressive wave winding or retrogressive wave winding.
Progressive wave winding. If after completing one round of the armature, the winding falls in a slot 
to the right of its starting point the winding is known as progressive wave winding.
Retrogressive wave winding. If after completing one round of the armature. The winding falls in a 
slot to the left of its starting point, the winding is known as retrogressive wave winding.
The wave winding may also be a multiplex winding (double, triple or more).
A simplex wave winding has only two parallel paths irrespective of the number of pair of poles of 
the machine. However, a multiplex wave winding has 2 m parallel paths, where m is the multiplicity.
* Like lap winding, a wave winding may also be multiplex winding i.e., duplex, triplex and so on…

Regarding wave winding, the following points are worth noting:
(a) Simplex wave winding
1. Both back and front pitches must be odd.
2. Both back and front pitches must be nearly equal to pole pitch. They may be equal to each other 
or may differ by 2 i.e.,
YF = YB or YF = YB ± 2
3. Commutator pitch, YC = YA (average pitch)
4. An average pitch YA must be an integer given by the relation

The wave winding will be closed itself only if the value of average pitch (YA) comes out to be 
a whole number (i.e., integer) and agrees to the above formulae.
It is important to note here that in formulae YA = Z – 2
P
, the value ±2 has been taken due to the 
reason that after one round of armature the winding falls either short or go ahead by two 
conductors from the starting conductor. If it is not done and the average pitch is taken as Z/P
then after one round of armature the winding would have been closed without including all 
coil-sides.
The positive sign provides progressive winding whereas negative sign provides retrogressive 
winding.
It is mentioned that average pitch (YA) must be a whole number, it shows that this winding is 
not possible with any number of coil-sides. For example, with 32 conductors in a four-pole 
machine, YA = 32

(ii) the number of commutator segments may be odd or even.
(iii) the average pitch must be odd for even number of coils but it must be even for odd

(iii) In case of duplex winding
(a) If No. of pair of poles is add and average pitch is odd, it must have odd number 
of commutator segments and coils.
If average pitch is even machine must have an even number of commutator 
segments and coils.
(b) If No. of pair of poles is even, the number of commutator segments and coils 
must be even irrespective whether the average pitch is odd or even.
If average pitch is odd, the winding will be singly re-entrant and if even doubly 
re-entrant.
4.14 Dummy Coils 
While designing wave winding, a particular number of coil-sides are required. To accommodate these 
coil-sides, the stemming with particular number of slots are needed which may not be available with 
standard armature punching. In such cases, some coil-sides (or conductors) are placed in the vacant 
slots. These coil sides are not connected to other coil-sides of the winding and do not participate in 
the conversion of power. Such coil-sides or coils are called dummy coil. These are employed only to 
make the mechanical balancing of the armature.
Thus, the coils placed on the armature which do not participate in the conversion of power but 
are employed only to make mechanical balancing of the armature are known as dummy coils.

Starting from 1st coil-side, connect coil-side 1 to 1 + 7 = 8 at the back and 8 to 8 + 7 = 15 at the 
front through commutator segment 8. The first coil side is connected to commutator segments 1 at 
the front. Thus YC = 8 – 1 = 7. The coil side 15 is further connected to coil side 15 + 7 = 22 at the 
back and 22 to 22 + 7 = 29 at the front and so on, as per the table given below, till winding is closed.
* If YA is taken as 8, then YB = 9 and YF = 7 or YF = 9 and YB = 7. However, it is important to note that if YC = 7 the armature 
will rotate in one direction and if YC = 8, it will rotate in opposite direction.

shown in Fig. 4.35.
Fig. 4.35 Spiral winding
3. Figure 4.35 shows that whole winding is divided into two portions i.e., between N to M and to 
M to N.
4. Here N is a point where induced emfs are separating, but this position is at the back and does 
not fall at the commutator end. Therefore, the negative brush may be placed either at position 
P or Q i.e., either at commutator segment number 1 or 8.
5. Similarly, it is clear that M is a point where induced emfs are meeting, but this position is at 
the back and does not fall at the commutator end. Therefore, the positive brush may be placed 
either at position R or S i.e., either at commutator segment number 5 or 12.
6. Here, conductors 24, 1, 8, 15, 2, 9, 16, 23 fall in between the poles, no emf is induced in them 
and the brushes can be placed at their junctions.
7. If negative brush is placed at P, the positive brush can be placed at R or S. Let the negative 
brush be placed at P and the positive brush is placed at R, the armature winding will form two 
parallel paths as shown in Fig. 4.36.
Fig. 4.36 Parallel paths
8. If in all, 4 brushes (two positive and two negative) are used and are placed in both alternative 
positions, then the loops lying between the brushes of same polarity are being short circuited 
as shown in Fig. 4.37, but the number of parallel paths remain only two.

335
Fig. 4.37 Path formation with four brushes
9. The ring diagram with brush position is shown in Fig. 4.38.
Fig. 4.38 Ring diagram
From the above explanation, it is summarised that:
(i) Only two brushes are necessary (at position P and R, see Fig. 4.36), although their number 
may be kept equal to the number of poles (at position P–Q, negative and R–S, positive; 
see Fig. 4.38).
Note: Only two brushes are necessary, however, parallel brushes may be added to make 
their number equal to the number of poles. The parallel brush arrangement reduces the 
current per brush set which reduces the axial length of commutator and consequently 
reduces the cost of commutator or machine. This arrangement is used in large machines, 
for small machines only two brushes (one set) is sufficient.
(ii) Wave wound armature winding has only two parallel paths irrespective of the number of 
poles of the machine. That is why, this winding is sometimes called ‘two circuit winding’ 
or ‘series winding’.

Electrical Machines
(iii) The total generated emf, Eg = eav × Z/2
where 
eav = average induced emf/conductor and
Z/2 = No. of conductors connected in series in each parallel path.
(iv) The current carried by each parallel path or each armature conductor will be Ia/2 where 
Ia is the total armature current.

4. From Fig. 4.40, it is clear that point N is a position where induced emfs are separating, but this 
position is at the back and does not fall at the commutator end. Therefore, negative brush may 
be placed either at position P or Q i.e., either at commutator segment number 6 or 11.
5. Similarly, from Fig. 4.40, it is clear that point M is a position where induced emfs are meeting, 
but this position is at the back and does not fall at the commutator end. Therefore, positive brush 
may be placed either at position R or S i.e., either at commutator segment number 14 or 3.
6. If negative brush is placed at P, the corresponding position of positive brush will be R. However, 
if the negative brush is placed at Q, the corresponding position of positive brush will be S.

opposite when shown in the circuit diagram (see Fig. 4.41) in comparison to developed winding 
diagram shown in Fig. 4.39.
In fact, these two coil-sides, at this particular instant, are passing through magnetic neutral axis 
and the induced emf in these conductors is zero. Hence, they do not affect the system.
4.15 Applications of Lap and Wave Windings 
The lap winding contains more number of parallel paths and provides large current. Hence, this 
winding is applied to the generators which are to deliver more current. Wave winding is more suitable 
for small generators specially these are meant for 500–600 V circuits.
The main advantage of wave winding is that it gives more emf than lap winding for given 
number of poles and armature conductors, whereas, the lap winding would require large number of 
conductors for the same emf. This will result in higher cost of winding and less utilisation of space 
in the armature slots.
Moreover, in wave winding, equalising connections are not necessary, whereas in lap winding these 
are required definitely. It is because, in wave winding the conductors of the two paths are distributed 
in such a way that they lie under all the poles, therefore, any inequality of pole fluxes affects two 
paths equally, hence their induced emfs are equal. But, in lap winding, each parallel path contains 
conductors which lie under one pair of poles, hence unequal voltages are produced which set-up a 
circulating current causing sparking at the brushes.
Thus, in general practice, wave winding is preferred, the lap winding is only used for low-voltage, 
high-current machines.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. Define statically and dynamically induced emf. 
Ans. When flux linking with the coil changes on emf is induced in the coil is called statically induced emf, 
in this case both coil and magnetic field system are stationary.
When a constructor cuts across the magnetic field an emf is induced in the conductor is called 
dynamically induced emf, in this case either conductor on the magnetic field system is moving (or 
rotating).
Q.2. Why is commutator employed in DC machines? 
Ans. Commutator in employed in DC machines:
1. To convert AC into DC, in generator action, to deliver DC electric power to the load.
2. To convert DC into AC, in motor action, to develop unidirectional torque in armature.
Q.3. Define coil pitch and coil span. 
Ans. Coil pitch or Coil span: The distance between two sides of the same coil is called coil pitch or coil span.
The coil-pitch is usually expressed in terms of number of armature conductor or number of slots 
between two sides of the same coil.
The coil span is usually expressed in terms of angular displacement (electrical angle) between the two 
sides of the same coil.
Q.4. Define resultant pitch. 
Ans. The distance in terms of number of armature conductor or number of slots between the start of one 
coil and the start of next coil to which it is connected is called resultant pitch.
Q.5. Explain the difference between integral slot and fractional slot winding.
Ans. The winding in which the number of armature slots per pole give an integer (whole number), the winding 
is called integral slot winding.
The winding in which the number of armature slots per pole gives fractional value, the winding is called 
fractional slot winding.
Q.6. Define the factors and state benefits of short pitched coils. 
Ans. The advantage of short pitched winding is that in this case the copper used for end connections is 
reduced substantially which reduces the cost of machine. If also improves the commutation (reduction 
of sparking at brushes) because inductance of overhang connections is reduced. Moreover, it reduces 
the copper losses and improves the efficiency to some extent. Hence, many a times short pitched 
winding is used.
Q.7. What are equaliser rings and why are they used? 
Ans. Equaliser rings and their use: An equaliser is a copper wire having very low resistance and is used to 
connect the points of different parallel paths of armature winding which should have same potential 
under ideal conditions. These equaliser rings carry the circulating current and relieve the brushes to 
carry these circulating current. Under this condition, the brushes are to carry only the load current.
Q.8. What is the basic principle on which a generator operates?
Ans. A generator operates on the basic principle of production of dynamically induced emf (electro-magnetic 
induction).

340
Electrical Machines
Q.9. Why is the pole shoe section of a DC machine made larger than pole core?
Ans. The pole shoe is made larger because it is to support the field coils and spreads out the flux over the 
armature periphery more uniformly. The larger x-section area reduces the reluctance of the magnetic 
path.
Q.10. Is it necessary to use a large number of coils and commutator segments with the coils evenly 
distributed around the surface of the armature of a DC machine?
Ans. Yes, it is necessary it provides practically constant unidirectional voltage at the brushes.
Q.11. Why the armature of a DC machine is made of laminated silicon steel?
Ans. To reduce hysteresis and eddy current loss.
Q.12. In large DC machines electro-magnets are preferred over permanent magnets, why ?
Ans. On account of their greater magnetic effect and field strength regulation.
Q.13. In small DC machine, cast iron yokes are preferred, why?
Ans. Because of their low cost.
Q.14. Why fractional pitch winding is preferred over full pitch winding?
Ans. To effect saving in the copper of end connections and to have improved commutation by reducing 
inductance effect of overhang.
Q.15. What for brushes are employed in DC generator.
Ans. The brushes are employed to collect current from the commutator and supply it to the external load circuit.
Q.16. For what type of DC machine, wave winding is employed?
Ans. For low current and high voltage rating machine.
Q.17. Which are the different types of armature windings commonly used in DC machines ?
Ans. Lap and wave windings.
Q.18. For what type of DC machine lap winding is employed?
Ans. For high current and low voltage rating machine.
Q.19. Why equaliser rings are used?
Ans. Equaliser rings are used in lap wound machines to avoid unequal distribution of current at the brushes, 
thus reducing sparking at the brushes.
Q.20. In which type of armature winding equaliser connections are used?
Ans. In lap winding.

Thus, we conclude that the induced emf is directly proportional to flux per pole and speed. 
Moreover, the polarity of the induced emf depends upon the direction of magnetic field and the 
direction of rotation. If either of the two is reversed, the polarity of induced emf i.e., brushes is 
reversed, but when both are reversed the polarity does not change.
This induced emf is fundamental phenomenon to all DC machines whether they are working as 
generator or motor. However, when the machine is working as a generator, this induced emf is called 
generated emf and is represented as Eg, i.e., Eg = PZ N

4.17 Torque Equation 
We know that when a current carrying conductor is placed in the magnetic field a force is exerted 
on it which exerts turning moment or torque (F × r) (see Fig. 4.43). This torque is produced due to 
electro-magnetic effect, hence is called electromagnetic torque.

Thus, we conclude that torque produced in the armature is directly proportional to flux per pole 
and armature current. Moreover, the direction of electromagnetic torque developed in the armature 
depends upon the direction of flux or magnetic field and the direction of flow of current in armature 
conductors. The direction of torque produced and hence the direction of rotation is reversed if either 
of the two is reversed. But when both are reversed the direction of torque does not change.

4.18 Armature Reaction 
When a DC generator is loaded, a current flows through the armature conductor in the same direction 
as that of the induced (or generated) emf The armature conductors carrying current, produce their 
own magnetic field called armature field.
The effect of armature field produced by the armature current carrying conductors on the main 
magnetic field is known as armature reaction.
Let us see the effect of armature field on the main magnetic field when the generator is loaded.
Consider a bipolar generator. At no-load, no current flows through the armature conductors and the 
flux distribution in the armature is shown in Fig. 4.44. The vector OFm represents the mmf produced 
by the main field. It is observed that the Magnetic Neutral Axis (MNA), which are perpendicular to 
the main field passing through the armature, and the Geometrical Neutral Axis (GNA) coincide with 
each other. The brushes (B1 and B2) are always placed at MNA. Here, they are shown as touching 

350
Electrical Machines
the armature conductors directly, but in reality they touch the commutator segments connected to 
these conductors.
Geometrical Neutral Axis: The line passing through the geometrically central point between the 
two adjacent opposite magnetic poles is called geometrical neutral axis (GNA).
Magnetic Neutral Axis: The line passing through the magnetically neutral position between the 
two adjacent opposite magnetic poles is called magnetic neutral axis (MNA). When a conductor 
(or coil) passes through these axis, no emf is induced in the conductor (or coil).
When load is applied to the generator, current* flows through the armature conductors which 
sets up armature field as shown in Fig. 4.45. The vector OFA represents the mmf produced by the 
armature field.
Fig. 4.44 Main field produced by main poles
Fig. 4.45 Field produced by armature conductors
This armature flux interacts with the main flux and a resultant flux is set up in the armature as 
shown in Fig. 4.46. It can be observed that the resultant flux is no longer uniform. It is concentrated 
(becomes stronger) at the trailing pole tips and is rare (becomes weaker) at the leading pole tips.
The resultant mmf is shown by the vector OF which is the vector sum of OFm and OFA. Thus, the 
MNA are shifted to new position displaced from its original position by an angle T. 
The new position of magnetic neutral axis i.e., the shifting of axis by an angle T depends upon 
the magnitude of load applied on the generator. Larger the load, larger will be the shift or larger will 
be the value of angle T. It means the shifting of MNA is not constant, it varies and depends upon 
the magnitude of load applied on the machine. Moreover, the shift is in the direction of rotation. (in 
generating action).
As per the new position of MNA, the distribution of armature flux is shown in Fig. 4.47. The vector 
OFAR represents the new position of mmf producing resultant armature field. This armature field 
has two component (i) OFC which is perpendicular to the main mmf OFm and produces the cross 
magnetising effect. (ii) OFD which opposes the main mmf OFm and produces the demagnetising 
effect. 
* The direction of flow of current in armature conductors is determined by Flemming’s right hand rule. The direction of 
induced emf and direction of flow of current is the same.

DC Generator 
351
Thus the armature magnetic field produces.
(i) Cross magnetising effect which creates a magnetic field in between the two adjacent opposite 
poles where brushes are placed for commutation.
(ii) Demagnetising effect which weaken the main magnetic field and changes the flux distribution 
such that at trailing pole tips the flux is strengthened and at leading pole tips the flux is weakened.

Fig. 4.47 
New position of MNA
Ill-effects of armature reaction
The above two effects caused by the armature reaction lead to poor commutation (increases sparking 
at the brushes or at the commutator surface) and increases iron losses. Let us see how it happens; 
(i) Sparking at brushes: During commutation i.e., when a coil is short circuited by the brushes 
through commutator segments should have zero emf induced in it. That is why the brushes 
are usually placed along the interpolar axis where the flux cut by the coil is zero and no emf 
is induced in it. But due to armature reaction the magnetic neutral axis (MNA) are shifted and 
the coil which undergoes commutation induces some emf causing sparking at the brushes. At 
heavy loads, the induced emf in the commutating coil may be so high that it may produce a 
spark that may spread around the commutator surface forming a ring of fire. By all means, it 
has to be avoided otherwise it would damage the commutator surface and brushes.
(ii) Iron losses: The flux density in the leading and trailing pole tips is changing due to change in 
load on the generator or due to armature reaction. This change in flux density causes more iron 
losses in the pole shoes.
4.19 Calculations for Armature Ampere-turns 
Armature reaction causes demagnetising and cross-magnetising effect. Due to armature reaction, 
let the MNA be shifted ahead by an angle T. The new position of MNA is represented by line AB. 
Draw another line CD making the same angle T with GNA but in opposite direction as shown in Fig. 

352
Electrical Machines
4.48. It may be observed that all the conductors lying between AOC and BOD carry current in such 
a direction mmf produced by them in opposite to the main mmf. These conductors cause demagnetising 
effect and these turns are known as demagnetising turns.
All other turn lying between angle AOD and COB produce 
cross magnetising mmf and are called cross-magnetising turns.

4.20 Commutation 
In a DC machine, one of the major function is the delivery of current from the armature (rotating 
part) to the external circuit (stationary part) or vicenegativersa. This operation is conducted with the 
help of brushes and commutator.
During this operation one of the armature coil moves from the influence of one pole to the other 
and consequently the current in this coil is reversed. While moving from one pole to the other the 
coil is short circuited by the brushes through commutator segments for fraction of a second (say 
about 1
500 second). This operation is called commutation.
Thus, the process in which a coil is short circuited by the brushes through commutator segments 
while it passes from the influence of one pole to the other is called commutation. In this process 
the current in the coil is reversed.
The duration for which a coil remains short circuited is called commutation period.
Explanation
For better understanding, consider a machine having ring winding, a part of which is shown in Fig. 
4.49. Assume that the width of brush is equal to the width of commutator segment and the insulation 
between the segments is very thin (negligibly small). The current per conductor isIcand the armature 
is rotating in such a direction, that coils are moving from left to right. Let the coil ‘B’ undergoes 
commutation. Step-wise explanation in given below:
1. As shown in Fig. 4.49 (a), the brush is in contact with commutator segment ‘a’ and collects 
current 2Ic coming equally from both the sides.
2. As the armature is moving, in the first step as shown in Fig. 4.49(b), the brush contact with 
segment ‘b’ starts increasing and contact with segment ‘a’ starts decreasing. Consequently, the 
current flowing towards the brush via segment ‘b’ starts increasing* and through segment ‘a’ 
starts decreasing.
* It may be noted that at first instant the current in segment ‘b’ is zero but at second instant its value is Ic – x and at the next 
instant it will become Ic which will be move than (Ic – x). Similarly, at first instant current in segment ‘a’ was 2 Ic (i.e., Ic + 
Ic = 2Ic) which is reduced to Ic + x and at the next instant it will be reduced to Ic only.

356
Electrical Machines
It may be noted that current in coil ‘B’ decreases from Ic to x.
Fig. 4.49 Commutation during brush shifts from segment ‘a’ to ‘b’
3. At the next instant, as shown in Fig. 4.49(c), the brush is at the centre of both the segments ‘b’ 
and ‘a’ and covers half of the area of both the segments. At this instant brush is drawing equal 
current (Ic) from both the segments ‘b’ and ‘a’ and its total value is 2Ic.
It may be noted that current in the coil ‘B’ at this instant reduces to zero.
4. Further at the next instant, as shown in Fig. 4.49(d), larger area of segment ‘b’ has come in 
contact with the brush than segment ‘a’. Accordingly, brush draws more current (Ic + y) from 
segment ‘b’ and draws smaller current (Ic – y)* from segment ‘a’.
* It may be noted that at each instant current drawn by the brush is 2Ic. First instant, 2Ic; second instant (Ic–x + Ic + x = 2Ic); 
third instant (Ic + Ic = 2Ic); fourth instant (Ic + y + Ic – y = 2Ic). 

DC Generator 
357
It may be noted that current in the coil ‘B’ has reversed and starts increasing.
5. At the next (final) instant, as shown in Fig. 4.49(e), the brush completely comes in contact with 
segment ‘b’ and draws equal current Ic from both the sides.
It may be noted that current in the coil ‘B’ has totally reversed and obtains its rated value Ic.
Thus, the commutation process is completed for coil ‘B’. The same process continues for the next 
coils to come (i.e., coil C, D and so on………..).
The reversal of current through a coil undergoing commutation may 
occur in any of the following manners (see Fig. 4.50):
Curve-I. Shows linear commutation, where current changes from 
+Ic to –Ic uniformly. It is an ideal commutation and provides uniform 
current density at the brush contact surface. In this case, the power 
loss at the brush contact is minimum.
Curve-2. Shows sinusoidal commutation. It results in satisfactory 
commutation.
Curve-3. Shows an accelerated or over-commutationwhere the current 
attains its final value with a zero (quick) rate of change at the end of 
commutation period. Usually, it provides a satisfactory commutation.
Curve 4. Shows a retarded or under-commutation where the final 
rate of change of current is very high. In such conditions sparking at 
the trailing edge of the brush is inevitable.
Curve 5. Shows sharply accelerated commutation where the current may reach to its proper final 
value without a spark but it involves very high localised current densities at the brush contact leading 
to sparking and heating which further leads to deterioration of brushes.
Curve 6. Shows sharply retarded commutation where current reaches to its final value which causes 
excessive current density under brushes resulting in sparking at the brushes.
Conclusion
From the above discussion, it is concluded that for satisfactory commutation, the current in the coil 
which undergoes commutation must be reversed completely during its commutation period Tc. 
4.21 Cause of Delay in the Reversal of Current in the Coil going 
through Commutation and its Effect 
The main cause of delay in the reversal of current in the coil undergoing commutation is its inductive 
property. It is apparent that the coils placed in the armature may have large number of turns embedded 
in the magnetic core having high permeability, due to which it possesses appreciable amount of 
self-inductance.
The inductive property of the coil undergoing commutation gives rise to a voltage called reactance 
voltage. This voltage opposes the reversal of current in it. Although, this voltage is very small, it

reversal of current

358
Electrical Machines
produces a large current in the coil whose resistance is very small under short circuit. Due to this, 
heavy sparking occur at the brushes.
Thus, it is observed that even though the brushes are set at such a position that coils undergoing 
short-circuit are in the magnetic neutral axis where they are not cutting any flux and hence no emf is 
induced in them due to rotation of armature but there will be an emf induced due to self-inductance 
which causes severe sparking at the brushes.
How to Offset this Reactance Voltage?
To offset this reactance voltage, a voltage is produced in each coil as it passes through commutating 
period. This voltage is produced in the coil in such a direction that it offsets the reactance voltage 
and helps in reversing the current in the coil. Such a voltage is called the commutating emf.
The necessary commutating emf can be produced either (i) by shifting the brushes in non-interpolar 
machines, beyond the position of MNA which is selected to neutralise the armature reaction. or (ii) 
by strengthening the inter-poles more than that is necessary to neutralise the armature reaction flux.
4.22 Magnitude of Reactance Voltage 
An approximate value for inductance (L) of a coil placed in the armature can be determined by 
Hobert’s formula. Hobart gave an experimental rule for determining inductance of a coil, i.e.,
L = n2 (8 le + 0.8 lf) × 10–6 henry 
…(4.11)
where, le = embedded length of coil in metre
lf = free length (over hang) of coil in metre
n = number of turns of a coil

4.23 Good Commutation and Poor Commutation 
Good Commutation 
Good commutation means no sparking at the brushes and the commutator surface remains unaffected 
during continuous operation of DC machines. Efforts are made to obtain good commutation.
Poor Commutation (Causes of sparking at brushes)
A machine is said to have poor commutation if there is sparking at the brushes and the commutator 
surface gets damaged during its operation. Sparking at the brushes results in overheating at the 
commutator brush contact and pitting of commutator. These effects are cumulative, since any sparking 
impairs the contact which increases heating and further aggravates the situation.
Poor commutation may be caused by mechanical or electrical conditions. The mechanical 
conditions for poor commutation may be due to uneven surface of the commutator, non-uniform brush 
pressure or vibrations of brushes in the brush holder etc. By making proper mechanical arrangements, 
the sparking due to mechanical conditions can be avoided (or eliminated).
The electrical conditions for poor commutation is development of emf in the coils undergoing 
commutation which may be due to armature reaction or inductance effect of the coil.

DC Generator 
361
The production of emf due to armature reaction in the coil undergoing commutation can be 
eliminated by providing interpoles or compensating winding on the machine. The production of 
emf due to inductance can be counter balanced either (i) by strengthening the interpoles more than 
that is necessary to neutralise the armature reaction flux or (ii) by shifting the brushes beyond the 
position of MNA which is selected to neutralise the armature reaction.
4.24 Interpoles and their Necessity 
The narrow poles placed in between the main poles of a DC machine are called interpoles or 
commutating poles.
Necessity
Interpoles are provided in between the main poles of DC machine and are energised to such an 
extent that they must neutralise the armature field produced by the armature winding when machine 
is loaded. At the same time they must neutralise the emf induced due to inductance in the coil 
undergoing commutation.
For illustration,
Consider a coil ab placed on the armature, rotating in a uniform magnetic field. At this instant, when 
the induced emf in the coil ab which undergoes short circuit must be zero as shown in Figs. 4.51 (a) 
and (b). Then no current flows and there is no sparking at the brushes which are slipping from one 
commutator segment to the next.
(a) Instant when induced emf in coil ab is zero 
(b) Bushes short circuiting the segments
Fig. 4.51 Armature rotating in uniform magnetic field
When load is applied, the armature conductors also carry current and produce their own magnetic 
field IA in the direction shown in Fig. 4.52(a). Thus coil ab undergoing commutation, this coil is short 
circuited for a small period. Although it is moving parallel to main field Im but at the same time it 
is cutting the armature field IA at right angles. Hence, an emf is induced in the short circuited coil 

362

ab as shown in Fig. 4.52(a). This produces lot of current in the coil and hence causes sparking at 
the brushes.
(a) EMF induced in coil ab due to armature field. 
(b) Position of interpoles
Fig. 4.52 Interpoles neutralising the armature field
The sparking at the brushes can be avoided by neutralising the armature field. For this, interpoles 
are provided in the DC machines which are placed in between the main poles as shown in Fig. 
4.52(b). The flux produced by the interpoles, i.e., Ii must be equal to that of armature field IA.
As IA is proportional to Ia, therefore, the winding of the interpoles is connected in series with the 
armature as shown in Fig. 4.53(a) and 4.53(b). Usually, the interpoles are tapered in order to ensure 
that there may not be saturation at the root of the pole at heavy overloads. At the same time the air-
gap under the interpoles is kept larger (1.5 to 1.7 times) than that under the main poles in order to 
avoid saturation in the interpoles.
(a) In DC series machines 
(b) In DC shunt machine
Fig. 4.53 Connections of interpole winding
4.25 Compensating Winding and its Necessity 
An armature reaction produces a demagnetising and cross-magnetising effect. The demagnetising 
effect is compensated by incorporating a few extra turns to the main-field winding, whereas, to 
neutralise the cross-magnetising effect a compensating winding is used.

DC Generator 
363
In this case, a number of conductors or coils are embedded 
in the slots of the pole shoes and are connected in series with 
the armature winding in such a way that current flowing 
through these conductors or coils sets up a magnetic field which 
neutralises the cross-magnetising effect of armature field. This 
winding is known as compensating winding, as shown in Fig. 
4.54.
When current flows through this winding, it sets up magnetic 
field which is equal and opposing to the cross-magnetising effect 
of armature field and neutralises it. Thus, no emf is induced 
in the coil passing through MNA and hence sparking at the 
brushes is eliminated. Thus, a sparkless or good commutation 
is obtained.
Example 4.33
Estimate the number of turns needed on each commutating pole of six-pole generator delivering 
200 kW at 200V, given that the number of armature conductors is 540 and the winding is lap connected

4.26 Methods of Improving Commutation 
Commutation may be improved by employing following methods.
1. By use of high resistance brushes. High resistance carbon brushes help the current to be 
reversed in the coil undergoing commutation and reduces sparking at the brushes.
2. By shifting of brushes. In this method, brushes are shifted to the new position of MNA so 
that no emf be induced in the coil undergoing commutation. Thus, the sparking at the brushes 
is eliminated. But in this case, the position of MNA changes with the change in load on the 
machine and simultaneously the position of brushes cannot be changed.
Hence, this method is employed in the machine which we do not have interpoles and the load 
on the machine remain almost constant.
3. By use of interpoles or commutating poles. In this method, narrow poles are placed in between 
the main poles of a DC machine which re-energised to such an extent that they neutralise the 
field produced by the armature under load. Hence, no emf is induced in the coil which undergoes 
commutation.
4. By use of compensating winding. In this method, a number of conductors or coils are embedded 
in the slots provided at the pole shoes faces and carry current of such a magnitude and direction 
that field produced by them neutralises the armature field and improve commutation.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What is armature reaction?
Ans. The effect of magnetic field set up by the armature current carrying conductors on the distribution of 
flux set-up by the main poles of a DC machine is called armature reaction.
Q.2. Mention two unwanted effects of armature reaction?
Or
State the effects of armature reaction in DC machines. 
Ans. Demagnetisation or weakening of main field and cross-magnetisation or distortion of main field.
Q.3. How will you define magnetic neutral plane (mnp)?
Ans. The plane through the axis, along which no emf is induced in the armature conductors, is known as 
magnetic neutral plane.
Q.4. Give the relation between electrical and mechanical angle in case of rotating machine. 
Ans. In a multipolar machine, the electrical angle completed in one revolution is P

mechanical angle is only 360°.
?

2 Tmech
Q.5. In a DC machine without interpole to get improved commutation, whether the brush shift should 
be varied with change in load or brush shift should be fixed?
Ans. Brush shift has to be varied with the change in load in a DC machine so as to lie along MNA to provide 
sparkless commutation.
Q.6. Explain bad commutation. 
Ans. A machine is said to have poor or bad commutation if there is sparking at the brushes and commutator 
surface. The bad commutation may be caused by mechanical or electrical conditions. The mechanical 
conditions may be due to uneven commutator surface non uniform brush pressure, vibration of brushes 
in the brush holder etc. The electrical conditions include development of emf in the coil undergoing 
commutation due to armature reaction or due to inductance.
Q.7. What is linear commutation? 
Ans. When current in a coil undergoing commutation changes from + IC to – IC uniformly, it is called linear 
commutation. It is an ideal commutation.
Q.8. Name the factor that opposes reversal of current in a coil undergoing commutation.
Ans. Self-inductance of the coil undergoing commutation opposes the reversal of current.
Q.9. Why are the interpoles of a DC machine tapered? 
Ans. Interpoles are tapered in order to ensure that there may not be saturation at the root of the pole at heavy 
overloads.
Q.10. What is the function of compensating winding in a DC machine?
Ans. The compensating winding is used to neutralise the effect of armature reaction outside the influence 
of the interpoles. It also maintains uniform flux distribution under the faces of the main poles.

368
Electrical Machines
Q.11. In what way compensating winding is connected to the armature?
Ans. The compensating winding is connected in series with the armature in a manner so that the direction 
of current through the compensating winding conductors in any pole face will be opposite the field 
produced by the armature current carrying conductors.
Q.12. What is the role of interpoles and compensating winding in DC machine?
Ans. Both are used to neutralise the armature field produced by the current carrying conductors of the 
armature when machines are loaded.
Q.13. What are disadvantages of armature reaction?
Ans. Armature reaction produces demagnetising and cross-magnetising effect on the main magnetic field.
Because of armature reaction, the MNA are shifted due to which an emf is induced in the coil undergoing 
commutation which causes heavy sparking at brushes.
4.27 Types of DC Generators 
D.C. generators are generally classified according to the methods of their field excitation. On the 
basis of this criteria, they can be classified as:
1. Separately excited DC generators
2. Self excited DC generators – these are further classified as:
(i) Shunt wound DC generators
(ii) Series wound DC generators
(iii) Compound wound DC generators.
(a) Long shunt compound wound generators
(b) Short shunt compound wound generators.
Except the above, there are also permanent magnet type DC generators. In these generators, no field 
winding is placed around the poles. These machines have fairly constant magnetic field. Although 
these machines are very compact but are used only in small sizes like dynamos in automobiles etc. 
The main disadvantages of these machine is that the flux produced by the magnets deteriorates with 
the passage of time which changes the characteristics of the machine.
4.28 Separately-excited DC Generators 
A DC generator in which current is supplied to the field winding from 
an external DC source is called a separately excited DC generator. 
The flux produced by the poles depends upon the field current with 
in the unsaturated region of magnetic material of the poles (i.e., 
I v If), but in the saturated region, the flux remains constant. Its 
conventional diagram is shown in Fig. 4.55.
Important relations: Here, Ia = IL…(4.16)
where Ia is armature current and IL is the line current.

If contact brush drop per brush (Xb) is known,
V = Eg – Ia Ra – 2 Xb. 
…(4.17)
Power developed = Eg Ia;
Power output = VIL = VIa
4.29 Self-excited DC Generators 
A DC generator whose field winding is excited by the current supplied by the generator itself is 
called a self-excited DC generator.
In a self-excited DC generator, the field coils may be connected in parallel with the armature, 
in series with the armature or partly in series and partly in parallel with the armature winding. 
Accordingly, the self-excited generators may be classified as
(i) Shunt wound generators
(ii) Series wound generators
(iii) Compound wound generators.
(i) Shunt Wound Generators
In a shunt wound generator, the field winding is connected across the 
armature winding forming a parallel or shunt circuit. Therefore, full 
terminal voltage is applied across the field winding. A very small current 
Ish flows through it because this winding has many turns of fine wire 
having very high resistance Rsh (of the order of 100 ohm). Its conventional 
diagram is shown in Fig. 4.56.
Important relations:
Shunt field current, Ish = V/Rsh 
…(4.18)
Where Rsh is the shunt field winding resistance. The field current Ish is practically constant at all 
loads, therefore, the DC shunt machine is considered to be constant flux machine.
Armature current, Ia = IL + Ish 
…(4.19)
Terminal voltage, V = Eg – Ia Ra
Including brush contact drop, V = Eg – Ia Ra – 2Xb 
…(4.20)
Power developed = Eg Ia; Power output = VIL
Fig. 4.56 Circuit diagram 
for DC shunt generator

370
Electrical Machines
(ii) Series Wound Generators
In a series wound generator, the field winding is connected in series 
with the armature winding forming a series circuit. Therefore, full line 
current IL or armature current Ia flows through it. Since the series field 
winding carries full load current, it has a few turns of thick wire having 
low resistance (usually of the order of less than one ohm). Its conventional 
diagram is shown in Fig. 4.57.
Important relations:
Series field current, 
Ise = IL = Ia…(4.21)
Series field winding resistance = Rse
Terminal voltage, 
V = Eg – Ia Ra – Ise Rse = Eg – Ia (Ra + Rse)
Including brush contact drop, 
V = Eg – Ia (Ra + Rse) – 2Xb 
…(4.22)
Power developed = EgIa; Power output = VIL = VIa
Note: The flux developed by the series field winding is directly proportional to the current flowing 
through it (i.e., Iv Ise). But it is only true before magnetic saturation, after saturation flux becomes 
constant even if the current flowing through it is increased.
(iii) Compound Wound Generators
In a compound wound generator, there are two sets of field 
windings on each pole. One of them is connected in series 
(having few turns of thick wire) and the other is connected 
in parallel (having many turns of fine wire) with armature. A 
compound wound generator may be;
(a) Long shunt in which the shunt field winding is connected in 
parallel with the combination of both armature and series 
field winding. The conventional diagram of lone shunt 
compound generator is shown in Fig. 4.58.

Cumulatively and Differentially Compound-wound Generators
In compound wound DC generators, the field is produced by the shunt as well as series winding. 
Generally the shunt field is stronger than the series field. When the series field assist the shunt field, 
the generator is called as cumulatively compound wound generator [see Fig. 4.60(a)]. However, 
when the series field opposes the shunt field, the generator is known as differentially compound 
wound generator [see Fig. 4.60(b)].

(b) Differential

4.30 Voltage Regulation of a DC Shunt Generator 
At no-load, the voltage at the terminals of a shunt generator is maximum and is called no-load 
generated emf When load is applied on the generator, the terminal voltage decreases due to drop in 
the armature circuit.

4.31 Characteristics of DC Generators 
To determine the relation between different quantities of a DC generator, the following are the 
important characteristics of DC generators:
1. No-load characteristics. It is also known as magnetic characteristics or open-circuit 
characteristics (O.C.C.). It shows the relation between the no-load generated emf in the armature 
(E0) and the field current (i.e., exciting current) If, at a specified speed.
2. External characteristics. It is also called the performance characteristics. It shows the relation 
between the terminal voltage (V) and the load current IL.
3. Internal Characteristics. It is also known as total characteristics. It gives the relation between 
the emf actually induced in the armature (Eg) and the armature current Ia.
4.32 No-load Characteristics of DC Generators or Magnetisation Curve 
of DC Generator 
It shows the relation between the no-load generated emf in the armature (E0) and the field current 
If, at a specified speed. To obtain this characteristics, proceed as follows:

DC Generator 
377
Open the field winding of the generator and connect it to a separate DC source through a rheostat 
as shown in Fig. 4.67. Connect an ammeter in the field circuit and a voltmeter across the armature. 
Reduce the field current to zero and run the armature at a specified speed. Get the reading of 
voltmeter and mark the point ‘a’ on the graph. To plot the characteristics take field current If along 
X-axis and no-load generated emf (E0) along Y-axis. Increase the field current in steps and get the 
corresponding voltmeter readings. Plot these values on the graph. The curve thus obtained (shown in 
Fig. 4.68) shows the no-load characteristics or open circuit characteristics (O.C.C.) of the generator.
Fig. 4.67 Circuit diagram 
Fig. 4.68
No-load characteristics
Analysis of the curve
While analysing the curve, the following points are worth noting:
1. The curve starts from point ‘a’ instead of ‘O’ when the field current is zero. It is because of the 
residual magnetism of the poles.
2. The initial part of the curve (ab) is almost a straight line because at this stage the magnetic 
material is unsaturated and it has high permeability.
3. After point ‘b’ the curve bends and the generated emf (E0) becomes almost constant. It is because 
after point ‘b’, the poles (magnetic material) starts getting saturated.
4.33 Voltage Build-up in Shunt Generators 
The shunt generator is a self-excited DC generator whose field winding is supplied current from 
the output of the generator itself. But question arises how it can supply current to the field winding 
before the voltage being generated? And if the field current is not supplied, how can the voltage be 
generated? Let us find out its answer from the following explanation.
The open circuit characteristics of a DC shunt generator is shown in Fig. 4.69(b). The shunt field 
resistance is represented by a straight line OX. When armature is rotated at a constant speed of Z
rad/sec, the small residual flux of the poles is cut by the armature conductors, and very small emf
(oa) is induced in the armature. If now key (K) connected in the shunt field winding, as shown in Fig. 
4.69(a), is closed, current ob flows in the field winding. This current increases the flux produced by 
the poles and voltage generated in the armature is increased to oc which further increases the field 
current to od which further builds up the voltage. This building up action comes to an end at point 
f where the o.c.c. intersects the shunt field resistance line OX. It is, because beyond this point, the 

378
Electrical Machines
induced voltage is less than that required to maintain the corresponding field current. Thus, the final 
current in the field winding is ef and the final voltage build up by the generator for a given O.C.C. 
is oe as shown in Fig. 4.69(b).
(a) Circuit diagram 
(b) Curve between Eg and If 
Fig. 4.69 Open circuit voltage built-up 
4.34 Critical Field Resistance of a DC Shunt Generator 
The open circuit characteristic of a DC shunt generator are shown 
in Fig. 4.70. The line OX is drawn in such a way that its slope gives 
the field winding resistance, i.e.,
Rsh = 
OB in volt
OC in ampere
(
)
(
)
In this case, the generator can build up a maximum voltage OB
with a shunt field resistance Rsh. A line OY represents a smaller 
resistance. With this resistance, the generator can build up a 
maximum voltage OF which is slightly more than OB. If the field 
resistance is increased, the slope of the resistance line increases. 
Consequently the maximum voltage which the generator can build 
up, at a specified speed, decreases. If the value of Rsh is increased 
to such an extent that the resistance line does not cut the no-load characteristics at all (OZ), then it 
is apparent that the voltage will not be built-up (i.e., the generator fails to excite).
If the resistance line (OP) just coincide with the slope of the curve, at this value of field resistance, 
the generator will just excite. This resistance, given by the tangent to the O.C.C. is called the critical 
resistance at a specified speed.
Thus, the slope of the tangent drawn on the O.C.C. is called critical resistance.
Critical resistance of a field winding. It is that maximum value resistance of a field winding which 
is required to build-up voltage in a generator. If the value of field resistance is more than this value, 
the generator would not build-up the voltage.
Critical load resistance. The minimum value of load resistance on a DC shunt generator with which 
it can be in position to build-up is called its critical load resistance.
Fig. 4.70 Critical resistance

DC Generator 
379
Critical speed of a DC shunt generator. It is the speed of a DC shunt generator at which shunt field 
resistance will represent the critical field resistance.
4.35 Load Characteristics of Shunt Generator 
It is also called external or performance characteristics of shunt 
generator. It shows relation between the terminal voltage V on load and 
the load current IL. To obtain this characteristics, proceed as follows:
Connect an ammeter A1 and rheostat in the field circuit and an 
ammeter A2 and voltmeter V on the load side as shown in Fig. 4.71. 
Apply a variable load across the terminals. At start switch off the load 
and run the generator at rated speed. No-load emf (generated voltage 
Eg) will appear across the voltmeter. Then switch on the load through 
switch S and increase the load gradually keeping field current (ammeter 
reading A1) constant with the help of rheostat Rh. Take the readings 
of voltmeter V and ammeter A2 at various instants and plot the curve. 
The curve so obtained is shown in Fig. 4.71.
Analysis of the Curve
While analysis the curve, the following points are highlighted:
1. At no-load, the voltage across the terminals is maximum and is considered to be equal to 
generated emf Eg.
2. As the load is increased gradually, the load current ILincreases but the terminal voltage decreases. 
The decrease in voltage is because of the following reasons:
(i) Due to increase in voltage drop in the armature resistance (IaRa)
(ii) Due to armature reaction, when load current or armature current Ia increases, the 
demagnetising effect of the armature field increases on the main field which reduced the 
induced emf Consequently the terminal voltage decreases.
(iii) The drop in terminal voltage further causes decreases in field current. This will, in turn, 
causes the decrease in induced emf which reflects the drop in terminal voltage. However, 
the field current can be kept constant by adjusting the 
rheostat connected in the field circuit.
3. During initial portion of the curve AB, the tendency of 
the voltage drop due to armature resistance is more than 
armature reaction.
4. At point B these two effects neutralise each other.
5. After point B, armature reaction dominates and the curve 
turns back (BC portion of the curve), as shown in Fig. 4.72.
6. The point C at which the external characteristic cuts the 
current axis corresponds to a gradual short circuit.

Electrical Machines
4.36 Load Characteristics of Series Generators 
In this generator, the field winding is connected in series with the armature and load (see Fig. 4.73). 
Therefore, full armature current Ia flows through it. When load increases, Ia increases which increases 
flux and consequently generated emf is also increased. This, correspondingly increases the terminal 
voltage V. Thus, a series generator has a rising characteristic (curve OA) as shown in Fig. 4.73.
Fig. 4.73 Circuit diagram 
Fig. 4.74 Curve between V and IL
However, at higher loads, the terminal voltage begins to reduce because of the excessive 
demagnetising effects of armature reaction. Ultimately, the terminal voltage reduces to zero at load 
current OB as shown in Fig. 4.74.
4.37 Load Characteristics of Compound Generator 
There are some applications where constant terminal voltage is essential. At such places, shunt 
generator is not suitable, because its terminal voltage decreases with the increase in load on it.
However it can be made suitable for such applications by connecting a few turns in series with 
the armature as shown in Fig. 4.75. The field produced by these series turns assist the field produced 
by the shunt winding. Such generators are known as compound generators. In such generators when 
load current increases, the flux increases which increases the induced emf This extra induced emf 
compensates the voltage drop in the armature resistance and the demagnetising effect due to armature 
reaction. Hence, the terminal voltage V remains substantially constant.
Degree of Compounding
A cumulatively – compound wound generator is shown in Fig. 4.75. Its level of compounding can be 
changed by varying the amount of current passing through the series field winding by connecting 
a by-pass rheostat Rh. 
When the field current is adjusted such that the terminal voltage V on full load remains the same 
as that on no-load, the generator is called to be level or flat compounded generator (see Fig. 4.76).
When the terminal voltage on full-load is more than its terminal voltage at no-load, the generator 
is called to be an over compounded generator.
On the other hand, when the terminal voltage on full-load is less than no-load voltage, the generator 
is called to be as under compounded generator.

DC Generator 
381
However, if the field produced by the series field winding acts in opposite direction to the field 
produced by the shunt field winding, the generator is called to be differentially compounded (see 
Fig. 4.76). 
Fig. 4.75 Circuit diagram 
Fig. 4.76
Load characteristics of compound generator 
4.38 Causes of Failure to Build-up Voltage in a Generator 
There may be one or more of the following reasons due to which a generator fails to build-up voltage:
1. When the residual magnetism in the field system is destroyed.
2. When the connections of the field winding are reversed. This, in fact, destroys the residual 
magnetism due to which generator fails to build up voltage.
3. In case of shunt-wound generators, the other causes may be
(i) the resistance of shunt field circuit may be more than the critical resistance.
(ii) the resistance of load circuit may be less than critical resistance.
(iii) the speed of rotation may be below the rated speed.
4. In case of series-wound generators, the other causes may be
(i) the load circuit may be open: it may be due to faulty contact between brushes and 
commutator or commutator surface may be greasy or dirty and making no contact with 
the brushes.
(ii) the load circuit may have high resistance.
Rectification: If the generator is not building up because of absence of residual magnetism due 
to any reason, the field coils should be connected to a DC source for a small period in order to 
magnetise the poles.
4.39 Applications of DC Generators 
Depending upon the characteristics of various types of DC generators, their important applications 
are given below:
1. Separately excited DC generators. Although, these generators are more costly than self excited 
generators as they require a separate source for their field excitation. But their response to the 

382
Electrical Machines
change in field resistance is more quick and precise. Therefore, these are employed where quick 
and definite response to control is important such as Ward–Leonard System of speed control.
2. Shunt-wound DC generators. As they provide constant terminal voltage, they are best suited 
for battery charging. Along with field regulators, they are also used for light and power supply 
purposes.
3. Series-wound DC generators. These generators have very few applications. Their best 
application is in the DC locomotives, where they supply field current for regenerative braking. 
They are also employed in series arc lighting. Another application of these generators is as 
series boosters for increasing DC voltage across the feeders.
4. Compound-wound DC generators
(i) Over-compounded type. These are more suited for lighting and power services, as they 
compensate for the voltage drop in the lines and voltage at the terminals of the load remains 
constant.
(ii) Differential-compounded type. They are usefully employed as are welding sets. In such 
cases, generator is practically short-circuited every time the electrode touches the metal 
plates to be welded.
4.40 Losses in a DC Generator 
While conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy, a part of energy dissipated in the form 
of heat in surrounding air is called losses in the generator.
These losses affect the efficiency of the generator. A reduction in these losses leads to higher 
efficiency. Thus, the major objective in the design of a DC machine is the reduction of these losses. 
The various losses occurring in a DC machine can be sub-divided as:
1. Copper losses.
2. Iron losses
3. Mechanical losses.
1. Copper losses. The various windings of the DC machine, made of copper, have some resistance. 
When current flows through them, there is power loss proportional to the square of their 
respective currents. These power losses are called copper losses.
In general, the various copper losses in a DC machine are:
(i) Armature copper loss = I R

The brush contact drop is generally included in armature copper losses.

DC Generator 
383
2. Iron losses. The losses which occur in the iron parts of a DC generator are known as iron losses 
or core losses or magnetic loss. These losses consist of the following:
(i) Hysteresis loss. Whenever a magnetic material is subjected to reversal of magnetic flux, 
this loss occurs. It is due to retentivity property of the material. It is expressed with 
reasonable accuracy by the following expression: Ph = K V f B
h
m
1 6. .…(4.28)
where, Kh = hysteresis constant in J/m3i.e., energy loss per unit volume of magnetic material 
during one magnetic reversal, its value depends upon nature of material;
V = Volume of magnetic material in m3;
f = frequency of magnetic reversal in cycle/second and
Bm = maximum flux density in the magnetic material in tesla.
It occurs in the rotating armature. To minimise this loss, the armature core is made of 
silicon steel which has low hysteresis constant.
(ii) Eddy current loss. When flux linking with the magnetic material changes (or flux is cut 
by the magnetic material) an emf is induced in it which circulates eddy currents through 
it. These eddy currents produce eddy current loss in the form of heat. It is expressed with 
reasonable accuracy by the expression:
Pe = K V f t B
e
m
2 2
2
…(4.29)
where, Ke = constant called co-efficient of eddy current, its value depends upon the nature 
of magnetic material;
t = thickness of lamination in m;
V, f and Bm are the same as above.
The major part of this loss occur in the armature core. To minimise this loss, the armature 
core is laminated into thin sheets (0.3 to 0.5 mm) since this loss is directly proportional 
to the square of thickness of the laminations.
3. Mechanical losses. As the armature of a DC machine is a rotating part, some power is required 
to overcome:
(i) Air friction of rotating armature (windage loss)
(ii) Friction at the bearing and friction between brushes and commutator (friction loss).
These losses are known as mechanical losses. To reduce these losses proper lubrication is done 
at the bearings.
4.41 Constant and Variable Losses 
The losses in a DC generator may also be sub-divided into:
1. Constant losses; 2. Variable losses
1. Constant losses. The losses in a DC machine which remain the same at all loads are called 
constant losses. The constant losses in a DC machine are:
(i) Iron losses; (ii) Mechanical losses; (iii) Shunt field copper losses
2. Variable losses. The losses in DC machine which vary with load are called variable losses.
The variable losses in a DC machine are;

384
Electrical Machines
(i) Armature copper loss; (ii) Series field copper loss (iii) Interpole winding copper loss and (iv) 
Compensating winding copper loss.
4.42 Stray Losses 
The sum of the iron losses and mechanical losses in a DC machine are known as stray losses i.e.,
Stray losses = Iron losses + Mechanical losses.
4.43 Power Flow Diagram 
The mechanical power (Z Tm) is supplied to the generator which is converted into electrical power 
(VIL). While conversion, various losses occur in the machine. The power flow diagram for a DC 
generator is shown in Fig. 4.77.
Fig. 4.77 Power flow diagram of a DC generator
4.44 Efficiency of a DC Generator 
The ratio of output power to the input power of a DC generator is called its efficiency.
Efficiency, K = output
Input ; where, Power output = VIL watt
Power input = Power output + Variable losses + Constant losses

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What are the requirements of self-excited DC machine? 
Or
What are the conditions to be fulfilled for a DC shunt generator to build-up emf.
Ans. Following are the requirements of a self-excited DC machine:
1. Its poles must have residual magnetism.
2. The field winding must be connected in such a way that field produced by the field winding must 
add to the residual magnetism. It should never be connected in reverse direction.
3. The field resistance should not be more than critical resistance.
4. The armature should not be rotated in reverse direction.
5. The resistance of the load circuit must not be below the critical resistance.
Q.2. Define critical resistance of DC shunt generator.
Ans. Critical resistance of a DC shunt generator. The maximum value of a shunt field winding resistance 
required to build-up voltage in a DC generator is called critical resistance. If the value of field winding 
resistance is more than this value, the generator will not be in position to built-up the voltage.

Q.3. What are the different methods by which flux is established in the magnetic circuit of a DC 
generator? 
Ans. The magnetic flux in a DC generator, can be established by the following methods:
(i) by means of permanent magnets.
(ii) By the field coils excited by some external source
(iii) By the field coils excited by the generator itself.
Q.4. How can you differentiate between the excitation system of a DC series generator and that of a DC 
shunt generator?
Ans. In a series wound generator, the field winding is connected in series with the armature winding so that 
whole current flows through it and the load. In a shunt wound generator the field winding is connected 
across the armature winding forming a parallel or shunt circuit.
Q.5. Why is field coils of a DC shunt generator are wound with a large number of turns of fine wire.
Ans. The field coils of a DC shunt generator are wound with a large number of turns of fine wire so as to have 
high resistance in order to keep shunt field current as low as possible as well as to provide required 
mmf.
Q.6. What type of current flows in field winding and armature winding of a DC shunt generator? 
[A.M.I.e., Winter 2003]
Ans. In field winding, it is DC whereas in armature winding it is AC.
Q.7. What is meant by OCC of a DC generator?
Ans. OCC mean open circuit characteristics. The curve drawn between generated emf at no-load and the 
field current, when the machine is running at a specified speed is known as magnetic characteristic or 
open-circuit characteristic (OCC) of a DC generator.
Q.8. What is the critical resistance of field circuit? 
Ans. The maximum value of resistance of field circuit of a DC shunt generator with which the DC shunt 
generator will be able to excite it is called critical resistance.
Q.9. In what respect the separately excited DC generator is superior to self excited DC generator?
Ans. The separately excited DC generator provides stable operation with any field excitation in comparison 
to self excited generators.
Q.10. What is critical speed in a DC shunt generator?
Ans. It is the speed of a DC generator at which shunt field resistance will represent the critical field 
resistance.
Q.11. A DC shunt generator is developing rated terminal voltage at some speed. For this generator,
(i) If only the direction of rotation is reversed, will the generator build-up?
(ii) If the direction of rotation and also the residual magnetism are reversed simultaneously will 
the generator build up?
Ans. 
(i) The generator will not build up. When the direction of rotation is reversed, the polarity of the 
generated emf will be reversed. the direction of field current will also be reversed and hence the 
residual magnetism present in the poles will be wiped off and the generator will fail to build up.

390
Electrical Machines
(ii) When the direction of rotation and the residual magnetism both are reversed simultaneously then 
it is obvious that a small emf will be produced initially which will further strengthen the field and 
hence the generator will build up voltage.
Q.12. What kind of generator can be expected to have no-load voltage and full load voltage to be same?
Ans. It can be expected in case of flat-compounded DC generator.
Q.13. If the terminal voltage of a DC generator at full load is more than its open-circuit voltage. What is 
the mode of excitation of the generator?
Ans. It can happen only if the machine is cumulatively compound wound.
Q.14. What type of DC generator can be used for battery charging?
Ans. DC shunt wound generator.
Q.15. What type of DC generator can be used for general power supply?
Ans. Cumulative compound wound is the most suitable.
Q.16. A DC series generator is not considered suitable for general electric supply?
Ans. Because DC series generators provide rising V–I characteristics.

Introduction
A machine that converts mechanical power into DC electrical power is called a DC generator. The 
same machine when used to convert DC electrical power into mechanical power, it known as a DC 
motor. From construction point of view there is no difference between a DC generator and motor.
The DC motors are very useful where wide range of speeds and perfect speed regulation is required 
such as electric traction.

5.1 DC Motor 
An electro-mechanical energy conversion device (electrical machine) that converts DC electrical 
energy or power (EI) into mechanical energy or power (Z T) is called a DC motor.
Electric motors are used for driving industrial machines, e.g., hammers, presses, drilling machines, 
lathes, rollers in paper and steel industry, blowers for furnaces, etc., and domestic appliances, e.g., 
refrigerators, fans, water pumps, toys, mixers, etc. The block diagram of energy conversion, when 
the electro-mechanical device works as a motor, is shown in Fig. 5.1.
Fig. 5.1 Block diagram of electromagnetic energy conversion (motor action)
5.2 Working Principle of DC Motors 
The operation of a DC motor is based on the principle that when a current carrying conductor is 
placed in a magnetic field, a mechanical force is experienced by it. The direction of this force is 
determined by Fleming’s Left Hand Rule and its magnitude is given by the relation:
F = Bil newton
For simplicity, consider only one coil of the armature placed in the magnetic field produced by a 
bipolar machine [see Fig. 5.2(a)]. When DC supply is connected to the coil, current flows through 
it which sets up its own field as shown in Fig. 5.2(b). By the interaction of the two fields (i.e., field 
produced by the main poles and the coil), a resultant field is set up as shown in Fig. 5.2(c). The 
tendency of this is to come to its original position i.e., in straight line due to which force is exerted 
on the two coil sides and torque develops which rotates the coil.
Fig. 5.2 Working principle of a motor
Alternately, it can be said that the main poles produce a field Fm. Its direction is marked in Fig. 
5.3. When current is supplied to the coil (armature conductors), it produces its own field marked as 
Fr. This field tries to come in line with the main field and an electromagnetic torque develops in 
clockwise direction as marked in Fig. 5.3.

DC Motors 
397
In actual machine, a large number of conductors are placed on the armature. All the conductors, 
placed under the influence of one pole (say, North pole) carry the current in one direction (outward). 
Whereas, the other conductors placed under the influence of other pole i.e., south pole, carry the 
current in opposite direction as shown in Fig. 5.4. A resultant rotor field is produced. Its direction 
is marked by the arrow-head Fr. This rotor field Fr tries to come in line with the main field Fm and 
torque (Te) develops. Thus, rotor rotates.
Fig. 5.3 
Position of main field Fm and rotor field Fr
Fig. 5.4 Motor action 
It can be seen that to obtain a continuous torque, the direction of flow of current in each conductor 
or coil side must be reversed when it passes through the magnetic neutral axis (MNA). This is achieved 
with the help of a commutator.
Function of a Commutator
The function of a commutator in DC motors is to reverse the direction of flow of current in each 
armature conductor when it passes through the M.N.A. to obtain continuous torque.
5.3 Back emf 
It has been seen that when current is supplied to the armature conductors, as shown in Fig. 5.5(a), 
placed in the main magnetic field, torque develops and armature rotates. Simultaneously, the armature 
conductors cut across the magnetic field and an emf is induced in these conductors. The direction 
of this induced emf in the armature conductors is determined by Fleming’s Right Hand Rule and is 
marked in Fig. 5.5(b).
Fig. 5.5 Back emf

398
Electrical Machines
It can be seen that the direction of this induced emf is opposite to the applied voltage. That is why this 
induced emf is called back emf (Eb). The magnitude of this induced emf is given by the relation;
Eb = PZ N
A
f

or 
Eb = ZP

IN or Eb v IN 
(since ZP

are constant) …(5.1)
Also, N
Eb
µ f
shows that speed of motor is inversely proportional to magnetic field or flux.
A simple conventional circuit diagram of the machine working as 
motor, is shown in Fig. 5.6. In this case, the supply voltage is always 
greater than the induced or back emf (i.e., V > Eb). Therefore, current is 
always supplied to the motor from the mains and the relation among the 
various quantities will be; Eb = V – Ia Ra.
Significance of Back emf
The current flowing through the armature is given by the relation: 
Ia = V
E
R
b
a
-
When mechanical load applied on the motor increases, its speed decreases which reduces the 
value of Eb. As a result the value (V – Eb) increases which consequently increases Ia. Hence, motor 
draws extra current from the mains.
Thus, the back emf regulates the input power as per the extra load.
5.4 Electro-magnetic Torque Developed in DC Motor 
The electrical power which is supplied to a DC motor is converted into mechanical power. The 
conversion of power takes place in the armature as stated below:

Thus, it is concluded that torque produced in the armature of a DC machine is directly proportional 
to flux per pole and armature current. Moreover, the direction of electromagnetic torque developed in 
the armature depends upon the direction of flux or magnetic field and the direction of flow of current 
in the armature conductors. If either of the two is reversed the direction of torque produced is reversed 
and hence the direction of rotation. But when both are reversed the direction of torque (or rotation) 
does not change.
5.5 Shaft Torque
In DC motors whole of the electromagnetic torque (Te) developed in the armature is not available 
at the shaft. A part of it is lost to overcome the iron and mechanical (friction and windage) losses. 
Therefore, shaft torque (Tsh) is somewhat less than the torque developed in the armature.
Thus, in case of DC motors, the actual torque available at the shaft for doing useful mechanical 
work is known as shaft torque.
Brake Horse Power (B.H.P.)
In case of motors, the mechanical power (H.P.) available at the shaft is known as brake horse power 
(B.H.P.). If Tsh is the shaft torque in Nmand N is speed in rpm then, 
Useful output power = Z Tsh = 2S N Tsh/60 watt

It has been seen that the same machine can be used as a DC generator or as a DC motor. When it 
converts mechanical energy (or power) into electrical energy (or power), it is called a DC generator 
and when it is used for reversed operation, it is called a DC motor.

1. In generating action, the rotation is due to 
mechanical torque, therefore, Tm and Z are in the 
same direction.
2. The frictional torque Tf acts in opposite direction 
to rotation Z. 
3. Electromagnetic torque Teacts in opposite direction 
to mechanical torque Tm so that ZTm = ZTe + ZTf.
4. In generating action, an emf is induced in the 
armature conductors which circulates current in 
the armature when load is connected to it. Hence, 
e and i both are in the same direction.
5. In generator action, E > V
6. In generating action, the torque angle T is leading.
7. In generating action, mechanical energy is 
converted into electrical energy.
1. In motoring action, the rotation is due to 
electromagnetic torque, therefore, Te and Z are in 
the same direction.
2. The frictional torque Tf acts in opposite direction 
to rotation Z.
3. Mechanical torque Tm acts in opposite direction to 
electromagnetic torque Te so that ZTe = ZTm + ZTf.
4. In motoring action, current is impressed to the 
armature against the induced emf (e), therefore 
current flows in opposite direction to that of 
induced emf.
5. In motor action, E < V
6. In motoring action, the torque angle T is lagging.
7. In motoring action, electrical energy is converted 
into mechanical energy.

5.7 Types of DC Motors
On the basis of the connections of armature and their field winding, DC motors can be classified as;
1. Separately excited DC motors: The conventional diagram of a separately excited DC motor 
is shown Fig. 5.8. Its voltage equation will be;
Eb = V – Ia Ra – 2Qb
(where vb is voltage drop per brush) …(5.4)
2. Self excited DC motors: These motors can be further classified as;
(i) Shunt motors: Their conventional diagram is shown in Fig. 5.9.

value is very small.

The compound motor can be further subdivided as;
(a) Cumulative compound motors: In these motors, the flux produced by both the windings is 
in the same direction, i.e.,
Ir = Ish + Ise.
(b) Differential compound motors: In these motors, the flux produced by the series field winding 
is opposite to the flux produced by the shunt field winding, i.e.,
Ir = Ish – Ise

5.8 Characteristics of DC Motors
The performance of a DC motor can be easily judged from its characteristic curves, known as motor 
characteristics. The characteristics of a motor are those curves which show relation between the two 
quantities. On the basis of these quantities, the following characteristics can be obtained:
1. Speed and Armature current i.e., N – I a Characteristics: It is the curve drawn between 
speed N and armature current Ia. It is also known as speed characteristics.
2. Torque and Armature current i.e., T–Ia Characteristics: It is the curve drawn between torque 
developed in the armature T and armature current Ia. It is also known as electrical characteristic.
3. Speed and Torque i.e., N–T characteristics: It is the curve drawn between speed N and torque 
developed in the armature T. It is also known as mechanical characteristics.
The following important relations must be kept in mind while discussing the motor characteristics: 
Eb v N I
or N v Eb
f
and T v I Ia
5.9 Characteristics of Shunt Motors 
The conventional diagram of this motor is shown in Fig. 5.13. In these motors, the shunt field current 
Ish = V/Rsh remains constant since the supply voltage V is constant. Hence, the flux in DC shunt motors 
is practically constant (although at heavy loads, somewhat flux decreases due to armature reaction).

406
Electrical Machines
1. N – Ia characteristics
We know that, 
N v Eb
f
Since flux is constant; 
N v Eb or N v V – Ia Ra
If the armature drop (Ia Ra) is negligible, the speed of the motor will remain constant for all 
values of load as shown by the dotted line AB in Fig. 5.14. But strictly speaking, as the armature 
current increases due to the increase of load, armature drop Ia Ra increases and speed of the 
motor decreases slightly as shown by the straight line A C in Fig. 5.14 (neglecting armature 
reaction). Moreover, the characteristic curve does not start from a point of zero armature current 
because a small current, no-load armature current Ia0, is necessary to maintain rotation of the 
motor at no-load.
Fig. 5.13 Circuit for shunt motor
Fig. 5.14 N-Ia characteristics of shunt motor
Since there is no appreciable change in the speed of a DC shunt motor from no-load to full load 
that is why it is considered to be a constant speed motor. This motor is best suited where almost 
constant speed is required and the load may be thrown off totally and suddenly.
2. T – la Characteristics
We know that, 
T v I la
Since flux is constant, 
T v la
Hence, the electrical characteristic (i.e., T – Ia) is a straight line passing through the origin 
as shown in Fig. 5.15. It is clear from the characteristic curve that a large armature current is 
required at the start if machine is on heavy load. Thus, shunt motor should never be started on 
load.
Fig. 5.15 T–Ia characteristics of shunt motor
Fig. 5.16 N-T characteristics of shunt motor

DC Motors 
407
3. N – T Characteristics
The N – T characteristic is derived from the first two characteristics. When load torque increases, 
armature current Ia increases but speed decreases slightly. Thus with the increase in load or 
torque, the speed decreases slightly as shown in Fig. 5.16.
5.10 Characteristics of Series Motors 
The conventional diagram a series motor is shown in Fig. 5.17. In these motors, the series field 
winding carries the armature current. Therefore, the flux produced by the series field winding is 
proportional to the armature current before magnetic saturation, but after magnetic saturation flux 
becomes constant.
1. N – Ia Characteristics
We know that 
N v Eb
f
where, Eb = V – Ia (Ra + Rse)
When armature current increases, the induced emf (back emf) Eb decreases, due to Ia (Ra + Res) 
drop whereas flux I increases as I v Ia before magnetic saturation. However, under normal 
conditions Ia (Ra + Rse) drop is quite small and may be neglected.
Considering Eb to be constant,
N v 1
1
f µ Ia
Thus, before magnetic saturation, the N – Ia curve follows the hyperbolic path as shown in Fig. 
5.18. 
In this region, the speed decreases abruptly with the increase in load or armature current.
After magnetic saturation, flux becomes constant, then
N v Eb v V – Ia (Ra + Rse)
Thus, after magnetic saturation, the N – Ia curve follows a straight line path and speed decreases 
slightly as shown in Fig. 5.18.
Fig. 5.17 Circuit diagram of series motor 
Fig. 5.18
N-Ia characteristics of DC series motor

408
Electrical Machines
From this characteristic, it is concluded that the series motor is a variable speed motor, i.e., its 
speed changes when the armature current (or load) changes. As the load on this motor decreases, 
speed increases. If this motor is connected to the supply without load, armature current will 
be very small and hence speed will be dangerously high which may damage the motor due to 
heavy centrifugal forces.
Therefore, a series motor is never started on no-load. However, to start a series motor, 
mechanical load (not belt driven load because belt slips over the pulley) is put on it first then 
started.
2. T – Ia Characteristics
We know that, 
T v I Ia
In series motors, before magnetic saturation I v Ia
Hence, before magnetic saturation the electromagnetic torque produced in the armature is 
proportional to the square of the armature current. Therefore, this portion of the curve (OA) is 
a parabola passing through the origin as shown in Fig. 5.19.
However, after magnetic saturation, the flux I becomes constant.
?
T v Ia
Hence, after magnetic saturation, the curve (AB) becomes a straight line. 
It is seen that before magnetic saturation T v Ia
2. When load is applied to this motor at start, it 
takes large current and heavy torque is produced which is proportional to square of this current. 
Thus, this motor is capable to pick up heavy loads at the start and best suited for electric traction.
3. N – T Characteristics
This characteristic is derived from the first two characteristics. At low value of load, Ia is small, 
torque is small but the speed is very high. As load increases, Ia increases, torque increases but 
the speed decreases rapidly. Thus for increasing torque, speed decreases rapidly as shown in 
Fig. 5.20.
Fig. 5.19 T-Ia characteristics of DC series motor
Fig. 5.20 N-T characteristics of DC series motor
5.11 Characteristics of Compound Motors 
There are two types of compound wound DC motors namely; cumulative compound motors and 
differential compound motors. Cumulative compound motors are most common. The characteristics of 

DC Motors 
409
these motors lies between the shunt and series motors. The N – Ia characteristics, T – Ia characteristics 
and N – T characteristics are shown in Figs. 5.21(a), (b) and (c), respectively.
Fig. 5.21 Characteristics of cumulatively compound DC motor 
However the N–Ia, T–Ia and N–T characteristics of a differentially compound motor are shown 
in Figs. 5.22(a), (b) and (c), respectively.
Fig. 5.22 Characteristics of differentially compound DC motor
5.12 Applications and Selection of DC Motors 
5.12.1 Applications of DC Motors
As per the characteristics of DC motors, different types of DC motors are applied for different jobs 
as explained below: 
1. Separately excited motors: Very accurate speeds can be obtained by these motors. Moreover, 
these motors are best suited where speed variation is required from very low value to high value. 
These motors are used in steel rolling mills, paper mills, diesel – electric propulsion of ships, etc.
2. Shunt motors: From the characteristics of a shunt motor we have seen that it is almost constant 
speed motor. It is, therefore, used;
(i) Where the speed between no-load to full load has to be maintained almost constant.
(ii) Where it is required to drive the load at various speeds (various speeds are obtained by 
speed control methods) and any one of the speed is required to be maintained almost 
constant for a relatively long period.

410
Electrical Machines
As such the shunt motors are most suitable for industrial drives such as lathes, drills, grinders, 
shapers, spinning and weaving machines, line shafts in the group drive, etc.
3. Series motors: The characteristics of a series motor reveal that it is variable speed motor i.e., 
the speed is low at higher torques and vice-versa. Moreover, at light loads or at no-load, the 
motor attains dangerously high speed. It is, therefore, employed: 
(i) Where high torque is required at the time of starting to accelerate heavy loads quickly.
(ii) Where the load is subjected to heavy fluctuations and speed is required to be adjusted 
automatically.
As such the series motors are most suitable for electric traction, cranes, elevators, vacuum 
cleaners, hair driers, sewing machines, fans and air compressors, etc.
Note: The series motors are always directly coupled with loads or coupled through gears. Belt 
loads are never applied to series motor, because the belt may slip over the pulley or it may break. 
Then the motor will operate at light loads or at no-load and will attain dangerously high speed 
which may damage the motor.
4. Compound motors: The important characteristic of this motor is that the speed falls appreciably 
on heavy loads as in a series motor, but at light loads, the maximum speed is limited to safe 
value. It is, therefore, used;
(i) Where high torque is required at the time of starting and where the load may be thrown off 
suddenly.
(ii) Where the load is subjected to heavy fluctuations.
As such the cumulative compound, motors are best suited for punching and shearing machines, 
rolling mills, lifts and mine - hoists, etc.
5.12.2 Selection of DC Motors
While selecting a DC motor for a particular work, one is to consider the following points:
1. Selection of power rating: If the size (HP or kW capacity) of a motor is more than the load to be 
picked-up by it then it will operate at lighter load than its rating. Hence, there will be more losses 
(i.e., motor will operate at poor efficiency) and unnecessarily there will be wastage of power. Thus 
extra expenditure will incur during operation. At the same time its initial cost will be more.
On the other hand, if the size of the motor is less than the load to be picked-up by it, then it will 
be over loaded and it will be heated-up beyond its limits. Hence the motor may be damaged if 
operated continuously. Otherwise, also the protective devices will disconnect the motor under 
over-load conditions and this affect the production.
Thus, a motor should be chosen of a size for its maximum power utilisation. During operation, 
it should be heated-up within the permissible temperature limits and it should never be over-
heated. But at the same time it should be capable to take-up the over-loads temporarily.
2. Characteristics of the motor: For satisfactory operation, selection of power rating of a motor 
is not only the criteria, rather one should know the characteristics of a motor (i.e., behaviour 
of a motor under different load conditions) so that a work can be done quickly and efficiently 
without any breakdown. Therefore, before selection of motor, one should know the following 
particulars of the work

DC Motors 
411
(i) Torque requirement during starting and running at different loads.
(ii) Requirement of accelerating and braking torque
(iii) Frequency of switching
(iv) Temperature at the work place
(v) Environmental conditions, etc.
After knowing the above particulars at the work place, a suitable motor (with proper enclosures) 
to meet with the requirements is selected.
5.13 Starting of DC Motors 
To start a DC motor, when it is switched–ON to the supply with full rated voltage, it draws heavy 
current during starting period (more than its rated value). This excessive current overheats the 
armature winding and may even damage the winding insulation. Therefore, during starting period a 
resistance called starter in connected in series with the armature circuit to limit the starting current.
5.14 Necessity of Starter for a DC Motor 
Under normal operating conditions, the voltage equation for a motor is given as
Eb = V – IaRa
or IaRa = V – Eb
The armature current is given by the relation;
Ia = V
E
R
b
a
-
When the motor is at rest, the induced emf Eb in the armature is 
zero (Eb vN). Consequently, if full voltage is applied across the motor 
terminals, the armature will draw heavy current (Ia = V/Ra) because 
armature resistance is relatively small. This heavy starting current 
has the following effects :
(i) It will blow out the fuses and prior to that it may damage the insulation of armature winding 
due to excessive heating effect if starting period is more.
(ii) Excessive voltage drop will occur in the lines to which the motor is connected. Thus, the 
operation of the appliances connected to the same line may be impaired and in some cases they 
may refuse to work.
To avoid this heavy current at start, a variable resistance is connected in series with the armature, 
as shown in Fig. 5.23, called a starting resistance or starter, and thus the armature current is limited 
to safe value I

. After that the starting resistance is gradually reduced. Ultimately, whole of the 
resistance is taken out of circuit when the motor attains normal speed.

412
Electrical Machines
Another important feature of a starter is that it contains protective devices such as overload 
protection coil (or relay) which provides necessary protection to the motor against over loading and 
no-volt release coil. 
5.15 Starters for DC Shunt and Compound Wound Motors 
The basic function of a starter is to limit the current in the armature circuit during starting or 
accelerating period. Starters are always rated on the basis of output power and voltage of the motor 
with which they are to be employed, e.g., 10 HP, 250 V shunt motor starter). A simplest type of 
starter is just a variable resistance (a rheostat) connected in series with the armature alone (not with 
the motor as a whole) as shown in Figs. 5.24(a) and (b).
Fig. 5.24 DC Series and Compound motor starter
It may be noted that shunt field is kept independent of starting resistance. It is because when supply 
is connected, it receives normal rated voltage and sets-up maximum (rated) flux. A higher value of 
flux results in a low operating speed and a higher motor torque for a particular value of starting 
current since speed is inversely proportion to flux per pole 
N µ 1
Ê
ËÁ
ˆ
¯˜
f
whereas motor torque is 
proportional to product of flux per pole and armature current (T v IIa). Hence, for a given load torque, 
the motor will accelerate quickly and reduces the starting period. Thus, the heating effect to armature 
winding is reduced.
For all practical application, this starter is further modified which includes protective devices 
such as over-load release and no-volt release. The over-load release protects the motor against over-
loading i.e., when the motor is over-loaded (or short circuited) this relay brings the plunger to its 
OFF position. On the other hand, the no-volt release brings the plunger to its OFF position so that 
the motor may not start again without starter. For shunt and compound motors there are two standard 
types of starters named as (a) three point starter and (b) four point starter.
5.16 Three-point Shunt Motor Starter 
The schematic connection diagram of a shunt motor starter is shown in Fig. 5.25. It consists of starting 
resistance R divided into several sections. The tapping points of starting resistance are connected 

DC Motors 
413
to number of studs. The last stud of the starting resistance is connected to terminal A to which one 
terminal of the armature is connected. The + ve supply line is connected to the line terminal L
through main switch. From line terminal, supply is connected to the starting lever SL through over 
load release coil OLRC. A spring S is placed over the lever to bring it to the off position, when supply 
goes off. A soft iron piece SI is attached with the starting lever which is pulled by the no volt release 
coil under normal running condition. The far end of the brass strip BS is connected to the terminal Z
through a no volt release coil NVRC. One end of the shunt field winding in connected to Z terminal 
of the starter. An iron piece is lifted by OLRC under abnormal condition to short circuit the no-volt 
release coil. The negative supply line is connected directly to the other ends of shunt field winding 
and armature of the DC shunt motor.
Fig. 5.25 Three-point shunt motor starter
Operation
First of all the main switch is closed with starting lever resting in off position. The handle is then 
turned clockwise to the first stud and brass strip. As soon as it comes in contact with first stud, 
whole of the starting resistance R is inserted in series with the armature and the field winding is 
directly connected across the supply through brass strip. As the handle is turned further the starting 
resistance is cut out of the armature circuit in steps and finally entire starting resistance is cut out 
of armature circuit.
No-volt Release Coil and its Function
A no-volt release coil is a small electromagnet having many turns of fine wire. It is connected in series 
with shunt field winding and therefore, carries a small field current. When the handle is turned to 
on position, the no-volt release coil is magnetised by the field current and holds the starting lever at 
on position. In case of failure or disconnection of the supply, this coil is demagnetised and the lever 

414
Electrical Machines
comes to the off position due to spring tension. Consequently. The motor is disconnected from the 
supply. If the spring with the no-volt release coil is not used the lever would remain in ON-position 
in case of supply failure. And again, when the supply comes, the motor would be connected directly 
to the lines without starter.
The other important advantage of connecting the no-volt release coil in series with the shunt 
field winding is that due to an accident if the circuit of field winding becomes open, the NVRC will 
be demagnetised and the starting lever is immediately pulled back to off position by the spring. 
Otherwise the motor would have attained dangerously high speed.
Over-load Release Coil and its Function
An over-load release coil is an electromagnet having small number of turns of thick wire. It is 
connected in series with the motor and carries the line current. When the motor is over loaded (or 
short circuited), a heavy current more than predetermined value will flow through it. Then, the iron 
piece (armature or plunger) is lifted and short circuits the no-volt release coil. Hence the starting lever 
is released and pulled back to the off position due to spring tension. Thus the motor is disconnected 
from the supply and is protected against over loading.
5.17 Four-point Starter 
For speed control of DC shunt or compound motors, a rheostat (variable resistor Rh) is connected in 
series with the field winding, as shown in Fig. 5.26. In this case, if a three-point starter is used and 
the value of Rh is so adjusted that the current flowing through the shunt field winding is very small. It 
may be seen that the same current flows through the no-volt release coil, then the magnetic strength 
of the coil may be insufficient to hold the plunger at its ON position. This is an undesirable feature 
of a three-point starter. This feature makes a three-point starter unsuitable for such applications. 
Accordingly, a four-point starter is designed, as shown in Fig. 5.26, in which the current flowing 
through the no-volt release coil is made independent of the shunt field circuit. Figure 5.26(a) shows 
a four-point starter used with a shunt wound motor whereas Fig. 5.26(b) shows a starter used with a 
compound wound machine.
Operation
The working of a four-point starter is similar to a three-point starter with slight changes.
In this case, when the plunger touches the first stud, the line current is divided into the following 
three parts:
(i) First part passes through starting resistance and armature (as well as in series field for compound 
motors).
(ii) Second part passes through the field winding (and speed control resistance if applied) and
(iii) The third part passes through no-volt release coil and protective resistance connected in series 
with the coil.

Fig. 5.26 Four-point DC motor starter
It is evident that is a four-point starter, the no-volt release coil circuit is independent of the field 
circuit. Therefore, the change of current in the field circuit do not affect the pull exerted by the 
holding coil which remains always sufficient to prevent the spiral spring from restoring the plunger 
to its OFF position.
While starting a motor with a four-point starter it is necessary to ensure that the field circuit is 
closed and the rheostat connected in series with the shunt field winding must be at zero resistance 
position. Moreover, whole of the starting resistance must come in series with the armature.
Whenever a shunt motor is required to be stopped, it must be stopped by opening the line switch. 
In fact this switch can be opened without any appreciable arc since the motor develops back emf 
nearly equal to applied voltage and the net voltage across the switch contacts is very small. The 
electromagnetic energy stored in the field does not appear at the switch but it gradually discharges 
through the armature. The motor should never be stopped by bringing the plunger (starting arm) 
back to the OFF position, because in such cases, when the field circuit breaks at the last stud placed 
near the OFF position, a heavy spark occurs owing to the inductive nature of the field. Usually, this 
sparking burns the contact.
Moreover, while stopping the motor, the value of resistance connected in the field circuit should 
always be reduced to zero so that speed of motor falls to its normal value. This ensures that, when 
the motor is started next time, it must start with a strong field and higher starting torque.

5.18 Calculation of Step Resistances Used in Shunt Motor Starter
For starting a motor from stand still to its rated speed, it is normally desirable to increase the speed 
gradually to maintain the angular acceleration constant during the starting period. The angular 
acceleration is proportional to the net torque, which is in turn nearly proportional to the product of 
flux (I) and armature current Ia i.e., T v IIa. The flux I will remain constant provided line voltage 
remains constant. Hence it follows that substantially constant angular acceleration calls for constant 
armature current during starting period.
We know, 
Speed, N v E

where R = resistance of armature plus the resistance of starter.
Since Ia and I are to be kept constant, therefore, for increasing the speed (N) gradually, R should 
be varied (reduced) in such a way that the above relation must be satisfied. For different values of 
armature current, the value of R is given by the expression, d
R = V

where K is a constant 
Note the Steps:

or I N v V – IaR
or 
KN = V – IaR
or R = V

-
In starters, usually the value of R is changed in steps and, therefore, armature current will change 
in two extreme values. Accordingly, the steps of the starter are designed in such a way that armature 
current varies in between these limits so that torque may not change to a greater degree.
The fuse or MCB placed in the motor circuit is usually not larger than 150% of the motor full-
load current.
Let I1 and I2 be the maximum and minimum value of the current drawn by the motor during 
starting. Let the starter has n-sections each having a resistance as r1, r2, r3…rn as shown in Fig. 5.27. 
Let the total resistance of armature circuit when the starting arm is kept at stud No. 1, 2, 3, … n and 
n + 1 be R1, R2, R3, …Rn and Rn+1 (where Rn+1 = Ra), respectively.

Just at the time of starting when the starting arm is brought in contact with stud-1, the motor is 
stationary and there is no back emf, the maximum value of current drawn by the motor,

Now the starting arm is shifted to stud-2, the speed of the motor is still N1 and the back emf is

If the values of armature resistance Ra, limiting currents I1 (max. value) and I2 (min. value) are 
known, the value of R1 and K can be determined from eqn. (5.11) and (5.16) respectively. At the same 
time, the number of section (n) can be determined by using eqn. (5.17).
By knowing the value of R1 and K, one can determine the values of R2, R3, R4, … Rn by using 
the eqn. (vi) and then the value of resistance of each step can be determined. i.e., r1 = R1 – R2; r2
= R2 – R3; r3 = R3 – R2; …; rn = Rn – Ra

5.19 Series Motor Starter 
A series motor starter is also called a two-point starter. Its internal and external connections are 
shown in Fig. 5.28.
Fig. 5.28 Two-point series motor starter
Here, for starting the motor, the control arm or plunger is moved in clockwise direction from 
its OFF position to ON position against the spring tension. In the beginning, all the sections of the 
starting resistance are connected in series with the armature to limit the current to predetermined 
value. As the starting arm moves, various steps of the starting resistance are cut out of circuit and 

DC Motors 
423
ultimately whole of the starting resistance is cut-out and the control arm is held in the ON position by 
an electromagnet. The hold-on (no-volt release) coil is connected in series with the armature circuit. 
If the motor loses its load, current drawn by the motor decreases which decreases the strength of the 
hold-on coil. Immediately the arm goes back to the OFF position due to strong spring tension; thus 
preventing the motor from over-speed. The control arm or plunger also goes back to the OFF position 
when supply goes OFF or when the supply voltage decreases appreciably. L and Y are the two points 
of the starter through which supply line terminal and the motor (series field) terminal is connected. 
For stopping the motor, the line switch should always be opened rather than bringing the control 
arm back to its OFF position. If it is done a heavy sparking occurs at the last stud placed near the 
OFF position. This sparking occurs due to dissipation of energy stored in the magnetic field of series 
field winding.
Example 5.17
A 240 V series motor takes 40 A when giving its rated output at 1500 rpm. Its armature and series 
field resistance is 0.18 : and 0.12 : respectively. Find the external resistance which must be added 
to obtain rated torque (i) at starting and (ii) at 1000 rpm.

Since torque remains the same in both the cases, the current drawn by the motor remains constant

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. How does a DC motor differ from a DC generator in construction?
Ans. Basically, there is no difference in the construction of a DC generator and motor, however the frame of 
the generator can, as a rule, be open but those of motors should be either partly or totally enclosed.
Q.2. Why the emf generated in the armature of a DC motor is called the back emf ?
Ans. Because this induced emf in a DC motor opposes the applied voltage, therefore, it is called back or 
counter emf.
Q.3. What do you understand by self excitation mode of DC machine? Name two DC machines working 
in this mode.
Ans. The DC machine in which field winding(s) is/are excited by the current supplied by the machine itself is 
said to be in its self excited made. In such machines the field coils are inter-connected with the armature 
winding.
The self excited machines may be (i) DC shunt machine (ii) DC series machine
Q.4. What will be the effect on direction of rotation of a DC series motor if the supply terminals are 
reversed?
Ans. There will be no effect, motor will rotate in the same direction, as before the reversal of line terminals.
Q.5. How can the direction of rotation of a DC shunt motor be reversed?
Ans. Direction of rotation of a DC shunt motor can be reversed by reversing the current flow through either 
the armature winding or the field winding.
Q.6. What do you mean by speed regulation of a DC motor?
Ans. The speed regulation of a DC motor is defined as the change in speed when the load on the motor is 
reduced from rated load to zero load and is expressed in percentage of rated full-load speed
Q.7. In a DC motor, the brushes are given a backward shift why?
Ans. In a DC motor, the brushes are given backward shift to neutralise the effect of armature reaction and 
further to reduce sparking at the commutator.

Electrical Machines
Q.8. What should be the location of interpoles in a (i) motor (ii) generator.
Ans. In case of a motors, the interpoles having the same polarity as that of main poles must be placed behind 
them, whereas in case of a generators, the interpoles having same polarity as that of the main pole 
must be placed ahead of them in the direction of rotation.
Q.9. Why large variable speed DC motors are fitted with compensating windings?
Ans. To reduce sparking at brushes due to armature reaction.
Q.10. Why is the starting torque of a DC series motor more than that of a DC shunt motor of the same 
rating?
Ans. In case of a DC series motor flux I is directly proportional to armature current Ia (before saturation) 
and, therefore, torque developed Te v Ia
2 while in case of a DC shunt motor torque developed Te v Ia 
(flux being constant). Obviously on the basis of the same kW output and speed, a DC series motor 
develops the torque more than that of a shunt motor. Hence, series motors are capable to pick heavy 
loads at start.
Q.11. What would you expect if the field winding of a DC shunt motor gets disconnected while in normal 
operation?
Ans. The flux will drop to almost zero value (residual value) and, therefore, the speed will increase to a 
tremendously high value and the motor may get damaged due to heavy centrifugal forces.
Q.12. What is the purpose and location of a series field winding?
Ans. Series field winding is connected in series with the armature and placed over the magnetic pole core 
to set up necessary flux in the machine for production of torque.
Q.13. A DC shunt motor runs away at heavy loads. Comment.
Ans. The field may be weakened, due to armature reaction at heavy loads, to the extent that the motor runs 
away.
Q.14. What is difference between cumulative compound and differential compound wound motors?
Ans. In cumulative compound wound DC motors, the field produced by series field winding assists the field 
produced by shunt field winding, whereas in differential compound wound motors series field opposes 
the shunt field.
Q.15. A long shunt DC compound motor is cumulatively compounded. Without any change in connection, it 
is now run as a DC generator. State whether it will now be differentially or cumulatively compounded.
Ans. When a cumulatively compounded long shunt DC motor is run as a generator, the shunt and series field 
currents produce flux in opposite directions and thus it will operate as a differentially compounded 
generator.
Q.16. What is the field of application of DC shunt motor and DC series motor.
Ans. DC shunt motors are almost constant speed motors. These motors develop medium starting torque 
and their speed can be adjusted by using speed control methods. Therefore, shunt motors can be used 
for the loads which are totally and suddenly thrown off without resulting in excessive speed. Being 
constant speed motors, they are best suited for driving of line shafts, machine lathes, milling machines, 
conveyors, fans and for all purposes where constant speed is required.

DC Motors 
427
DC series motors are variable speed motors. These motors develop large starting torque but attain 
dangerously high speed on no-load. So these motors cannot be operated at no-load. Series motors 
are best suited for electric traction, elevators, cranes, vacuum cleaners, sewing machines etc.
Q.17. Identify suitable DC motors for the following applications:
(a) Electric traction (b) Vacuum cleaners (c) Paper making (d) Shearing and punching.
Ans. (a) DC series motor (b) DC series motor (c) DC cumulative compound motor (d) DC cumulative compound 
motor.
Q.18. What would happen if a DC motor is directly switched ON to the supply, without any starter?
Ans. If a DC motor is directly switched ON to the supply, it will draw heavy current (about 10 – 12 times its 
rated value) which may over-heat the motor or damage it, depending upon the starting period.
Q.19. Why a starter is necessary for a DC motor?
Or
Why starters are used for DC motors.
Ans. A starter is employed to limit the starting current and provide necessary safety to the motor.
Q.20. A DC shunt motor is connected to a three-point starter. What would happen if
(i) the starter handle is moved rapidly from ‘off to ‘on’ position;
(ii) the field circuit becomes open-circuited with the motor running at no-load;
(iii) the starter handle is pulled back to stop the motor.
Ans. (i) When the starter handle is moved rapidly from ‘OFF’ to ‘ON’ position, the resistance connected in 
series with the armature is being cut out at a faster rate and the speed of the motor is increased 
at a slow rate. Because of this the armature current will increase to a larger value and the ratio of 
upper and lower values of currents will not be maintained.
(ii) With the opening of field circuit with motor running at no-load, the field current will reduce to 
zero. So flux collapses and reduced to zero, in the process, the speed of motor will suddenly starts 
increasing and continue to increase if the supply is not cut-off.
(iii) Sparking will occur at the last stud due to release of energy stored in the magnetic field of field 
winding, which may burn it.
Q.21. It is desirable that the starting lever of a motor starter should fall back to off position when the 
power goes off. Why?
Ans. If the starter arm remains in the “ON” position when supply goes off, then on restoring the power 
supply, the motor will start without starting resistance. Hence, motor will draw heavy current when 
supply is restored.
Q.22. Discuss the limitations of a three-point starter.
Ans. In a three-point starter, the no-volt release coil is connected in series with the shunt field winding. If the 
field current is decreased to low value for speed control then magnetic strength of the no-volt release 
coil decreases to such an extent that spring tension brings the starting arm back to OFF position. To 
overcome this problem a four-point starter is used.
Q.23. Why do you prefer starter to rheostat in starting DC motors?
Ans. The starter also contains protective devices, such as no-volt release, overload release, etc.

428
Electrical Machines
Q.24. How does four point DC shunt motor starter differs from three point starter?
Ans. In a four point starter the circuits of no-volt release coil and shunt field are made independent and so 
the operation of no-volt release is not effected due to variations in field current.

where Eb = V – Ia Ra
?

-
f
From the above equation it is clear that the speed of DC motors can be controlled;
1. By varying flux per pole I. This is known as flux or field control method.
2. By varying the armature drop, i.e., by varying the resistance of armature circuit. This is known 
as armature control method.
3. By varying the applied voltage. This is known as voltage control method.
5.21 Speed Control of Shunt Motors 
5.21.1 Field Control Method
The speed of a DC motor can be increased by weakening the field and it can be decreased by 
strengthening the field. In DC shunt motors, the speed adjustments can be made by field control 
method by employing any one of the following methods:
1. Field-rheostat control method
2. Reluctance control method
3. Field-voltage control method
1. Field rheostat control method. The flux produced by the shunt field winding depends upon 
the current flowing through it (i.e., I v Ish and Ish =

¯˜ is reduced and hence the flux I. Consequently, the motor runs at a speed 
higher than the normal speed (since N v 1/I), as shown in Fig. 5.29(b) The amount of increase 
in speed depends upon the value of variable resistance R.
This method is most common since very little power (I2
sh R) is wasted in the shunt field variable 
resistance due to relatively small value of Ish. 
In this method speed can be only increased, thus we can obtain speeds above normal. The other 
limitations and drawbacks of this method are:
(i) Speeds below normal cannot be obtained.

DC Motors 
429
(ii) The speeds above normal can be obtained by weakening the field. The advantage of high 
speed cannot be considered for increase in power output rather to compensate the power, 
armature has to draw extra current from the mains.
(iii) To obtain high speed, the field is very weak, to obtain certain load torque, armature draws 
extra current which may causes overheating of armature winding; poor commutation and 
instability.
Hence, the high speeds are restricted to certain extent. High speeds are also restricted due to 
mechanical considerations such as centrifugal forces developing in the armature conductors 
and friction occurring at the bearings.
Accordingly there is a limit to the maximum speed obtainable with this method. It is mainly 
because of poor communication at weak fluxes. A ratio of maximum to minimum speeds of 6 is 
fairly common.
Fig. 5.29 Speed control of DC shunt motor by field control method
2. Reluctance control method. The flux or field can also be controlled by controlling the reluctance 
of the magnetic circuit, but this can only be obtain by employing some special mechanical 
features which increases the cost of machine. Therefore, practically this method is not employed.
3. Field-Voltage control method. The flux or field can also be controlled by supplying variable 
voltage to the field winding. This can only be achieved by disconnecting the field winding from 
the armature and supplying variable voltage from some other source. Then the motor is treated 
as separately excited DC motor.
5.21.2 Armature Control Method
In this method, voltage applied to the armature is changed without altering the field current. This 
cannot be achieved by just changing the common supply voltage because it will also affect the field 
simultaneously and the combined effect will have little change in the speed of shunt motor. Hence, to 
adjust the speed of DC shunt motors by armature control method, different arrangements are made 
and the methods are known as:
1. Armature-resistance control method
2. Shunted-armature control method
3. Armature terminal-voltage control method

430
Electrical Machines
1. Armature resistance control method. In a shunt motor, flux is constant when applied terminal 
voltage and shunt field resistance are constant. Therefore, speed of the motor is directly 
proportional to induced emf (i.e., N v Eb and Eb= V – Ia Ra). The value of Eb depends upon the 
drop in the armature circuit. When a variable resistance is connected in series with the armature 
as shown in Fig. 5.30(a) the induced emf [Eb = V – 1a (Ra + R)] is reduced and hence the speed. 
Thus, the motor runs at a speed lower than the normal speed as shown in Fig. 5.30(b).
Fig. 5.30 Speed control of DC shunt motor by armature control method
For a constant load, the armature current remains the same so the input to the motor remains 
the same but the output decreases in proportion to the speed. Therefore, for the loads such as 
fans and centrifugal pumps where the load torque decreases with the fall in speed, this method 
of speed control is quite convenient and economical.
By this method, a wide range of speeds (below normal) can be obtained. Moreover, motor 
develops any desired torque over its operating range since torque depends only upon the armature 
current (flux remaining unchanged). The major advantage of this method is that the speed of the 
motor can be reduced to any low value and creeping speed (only a few rpm) can be developed 
so easily, as shown in Fig. 5.30(c).
The major disadvantage of this method of speed control is that there is heavy loss of power in 
the control rheostat.
2. Shunted-armature control method. An armature resistance control method is very simple 
and usually employed when speeds below normal are required. But this method suffers from 
the drawback that the motor speed changes with every change in load on the machine. It is 
because the speed variation does not depend only upon the controlling resistance but it also 
depends upon load current. Because of this reason constant speed cannot be obtained in case 
of rapidly changing loads. To improve the stability, a shunt diverted is used across the armature 
in addition to series resistance, as shown in Fig. 5.31(a). By this arrangement, the changes in 
armature current due to change in load torque will not be so effective to change the voltage 
across armature and hence the speed of the motor remains almost constant.
Figure 5.31(b) shows the speed-torque characteristics for shunted armature control method. 
In this method, the ideal no-load speed of the motor (Nc0) will be less than that obtained by 
conventional series resistance method (N0). This difference occur due to the fact that even if 
no current flows through the motor armature, there is some current in the series resistance and 

DC Motors 
431
the diverter. Hence, there is some voltage drop in series resistance which reduces the voltage 
coming across the armature. Thus, in this arrangement, the voltage coming across the armature 
is always less than the supply voltage. Whereas in case of conventional series resistance control 
method, the voltage coming across armature is V. The following three characteristics have been 
drawn in Fig. 5.31(b).
(i) Normal speed-torque characteristics – curve-A.
(ii) Speed-torque characteristics with conventional series resistance control – curve-B
(iii) Speed-torque characteristics with shunted armature control – curve-C.
Fig. 5.31 Speed control of DC shunt motors by shunted armature control method.
3. Armature terminal-voltage control method. In this method, speed of a DC shunt motor is changed 
by changing the voltage applied across the armature. This can be achieved only by providing a 
separate voltage source. Although this method avoids the disadvantages of poor speed regulation 
and low efficiency, which are the characteristics of armature-resistance control method, but it 
is very expensive and has very high initial cost. It is because an adjustable voltage generator or 
an adjustable electronic regulator is required to supply variable voltage to the armature. Both 
these machines are very costly.
This method gives a large range of speeds with any desired number of speed points. It is 
essentially a constant-torque system because the output of the motor decreases with a decrease 
in applied voltage and a corresponding decrease in speed.
5.22 Speed Control of Separately Excited Motors 
Sometimes, it is also called an armature voltage control method of a DC shunt motor. In this case, a 
separate DC source is used to supply power to the armature of DC shunt motor or separately excited 
motor and the field winding is excited from a different source. The most common and accurate 
speed control method of separately excited DC motors is Ward-Leonard system as explained below :
Ward-Leonard System
This system is used to supply variable voltage to the motor. As shown in Fig. 5.32, a DC generator G
is mechanically coupled with a prime mover PM which rotates the generator at constant speed. The 
field winding of the DC generator is connected to a constant voltage DC supply line through a field 

432
Electrical Machines
regulator and reversing switch. The DC motor M is fed from the generator G and its field winding 
is connected directly to a constant DC supply line.
Fig. 5.32 Ward-Leonard method of speed control of DC motors
The voltage of the generator fed to the motor, can be varied from zero to its maximum value by means 
of its field regulator. By reversing the direction of the field current by means of the reversing switch, the 
polarity of the generated voltage can be reversed and hence the direction of rotation of motor M. Hence, 
by this method, the speed and direction of rotation both can be controlled very accurately.
The capital investment in this system is very high as two extra machines (a generator and a prime 
mover) are required. This system of speed control is best suited where almost unlimited speed control 
in either direction of rotation is required, e.g., in steel rolling mills, paper machines, elevators, cranes, 
diesel-electric propulsion of ships, etc.
5.23 Speed Regulation 
The speed regulation of a DC motor is defined as the change in speed from full load to no-load and 
is expressed as a percentage of the full load speed.

Example 5.25
The armature resistance of a 200 V DC shunt motor is 0.5 ohm. When it draws an armature current 
of 30 A, it runs at a speed of 750 rpm. In order to reduce the speed to 450 rpm, what resistance must 
be added in the armature circuit keeping armature current constant. Further, what will be the speed of

5.24 Speed Control of DC Series Motors 
The speed of DC series motors can be controlled by any one of the following methods:
(i) Armature control method
(ii) Field control method
(iii) Series – parallel control method
5.24.1 Armature Control Method
By making various adjustments in the armature circuit of a DC series motor its speed can be controlled. 
According to the adjustments made, these methods are knows as;
1. Armature series resistance control method
2. Shunted armature control method
3. Armature terminal voltage control method.
1. Armature series resistance control method. In this method, a variable resistance is connected 
in series with the armature or motor as shown in Fig. 5.36(a). If the load and torque developed 
by the machine is constant, the speed of the motor depends upon back emf i.e., N v Eb. When 
no addition resistance is connected in series with the armature, then Eb1 = V – Ia (Ra + Rse). 
However, when an additional resistance R is connected in series with the armature, then back 
emf, Eb2 = V – Ia (Ra + Rse + R). Obviously Eb2 < Eb1 accordingly N2 < N1. Hence, by connecting 
an additional resistance is series with the armature we can obtain speeds below normal.
The speed-torque characteristics of a DC series motor without additional resistance and with 
additional series resistance is shown in Fig. 5.36(b). The maximum range of speed control of 
about 3: 1 will be available depending upon the load.
This is the most common method employed for the speed control of series motors. The power 
loss in the control resistance for many applications of DC series motors is not too serious, since in 
these applications the control is utilised for a large portion of time for decreasing the speed under 
light loads.

DC Motors 
441
The major applications of this method of speed-control are for driving cranes, hoists, trains, 
etc., because such drives operate intermittently.
Fig. 5.36 Speed control of DC series motors by armature control method
2. Shunt armature control method. In this method, 
combination of a rheostat R2 shunting the armature and 
a rheostat R1 in series with armature, as shown in Fig. 
5.37 is used. It provides slow speeds at light loads. This 
is an arrangement which accomplishes the speed control 
both by lowering the voltage applied to the armature 
and by varying the flux. In fact, the voltage applied 
to the armature terminals is varied by varying series 
rheostat R1 whereas the exciting current is varied by 
varying the shunting rheostat R2 keeping the armature 
current constant.
In this method, by the insertion of armature diverter R2, armature current reduces, then flux I
must increase because torque developed (T v Ia) by the armature remains the same. This causes 
increase in current drawn from the supply mains which increases the field and decreases the 
speed.
Thus, by this method, speeds below normal can be obtained. A wide range of speeds below 
normal can be obtained by taking different ratios of R1 and R2.
The application of this method is restricted to the places where speed control for short internals 
is required because this method is not so economical due to considerable power losses in speed 
controlling resistance.
3. Armature terminal voltage control method. In this method, a variable voltage power supply 
is used to change the supply voltage which changes the speed of a DC series motor. But the cost 
of such equipment is so high that this method is rarely applied.
5.24.2 Field Control Method 
The speed of series motors can be controlled by varying the flux produced by the series field winding. 
The variation of flux can be brought about by anyone of the following ways;
Fig. 5.37 Circuit diagram for shunted 
armature control method

442
Electrical Machines
1. Field diverters: In this method, a variable resistance R is connected in parallel with the series 
field winding as shown in Fig. 5.38. Its effect is that it diverts the path of the current IL drawn by 
the motor. A part of the current ID flows through diverter and the current flowing through the 
series field winding is reduced which reduces the flux I. Consequently, the speed of the motor 
is increased (N v I/ I). Thus by this method, only speeds above normal can be obtained.
2. Armature diverter: In this method, variable resistance R is connected in parallel with the 
armature is shown in Fig. 5.39. Its effect is that it diverts the path of the line current IL. Some 
of the current ID flows through the diverter and reduces the armature current Ia. For a given 
constant load torque, if Ia is reduced then I must increase ( T v I Ia). This results in increase 
in current drawn by the motor and a fall in speed (N v 1/I). By adjusting the value of diverter 
resistance, any speed below normal can be obtained by this method.
Fig. 5.38 
Circuit diagram for field divertor method 
Fig. 5.39 Circuit diagram for armature diverter
3. Tapped field control: In this method, the number of turns of 
the series field winding can be changed by short circuiting a 
part of it as shown in Fig. 5.40. We know that flux produced 
by the winding depends upon the ampere-turns (i.e., I v
Ise × No. of turns). As the number of turns are reduced, 
the speed of the motor is increased (N v 1/I). Thus, only 
speeds above normal can be obtained by this method.
5.24.3 Voltage Control Method
In this method, the voltage across the series motors are changed 
by connecting them in series or in parallel or the combination of 
both. This in widely used in electric traction.
To explain this method, let us consider only two similar series motors (for simplicity) whose 
shafts are mechanically coupled. Firstly they are connected is series and then in parallel as shown 
in Figs. 5.41(a) and (b), respectively. The current flowing through each motor and the voltage across 
it is shown in Fig. 5.41.

Thus, when the motors are connected in series, low speeds are obtained and when they are 
connected in parallel high speeds (nearly 4 times to that of first case) are obtained. Many speeds 
can be obtained by having more number of motors and connecting them in series, in parallel or the 
combination of both.
Usually, this method is employed in electric locomotives for controlling the speed of trains. In 
this case, combination of series-parallel and resistance control method is employed. The sequence 
of connections are shown in Fig. 5.42:

A 400 V series motor has a total resistance of 0·25 ohm, when running at 1200 rpm it draws a 
current 25A. When a regulating resistance of 2·75 ohm is included in the armature circuit, it draws 
a current of 15A. Find the speed and ratio of the two mechanical outputs. Assume that the flux with 
15A is 70% of that with 25A.

5.25 Electric Braking 
When load is removed from an electric motor and supply is disconnected, it continues to run for some 
time due to inertia. This continuous rotation may cause damage to equipment or to the manufactured 
product and even loss of human life. Therefore, quick stopping of a motor is essential in such cases.
Fig. 5.44 Circuit diagram

452
Electrical Machines
Thus, the method by which an electric motor or drive is brought to rest quickly when load on it 
is removed and supply is disconnected is called braking.
Braking may be employed to bring the drive to rest or it may be employed to lower down the 
speed when load is reduced. The device employed for braking has to absorb the kinetic and potential 
energy of the moving parts.
Objectives of Braking
While stopping the drive, braking may be used for any one of the following objectives:
(i) Reducing the time of stopping i.e., reducing the time of continuous running when drive is 
switched – OFF.
(ii) Stopping the drive exactly at specified point, e.g., in lifts; for safety reasons, the drive has to 
be stopped at a specific point.
(iii) For feeding back some of the energy to the supply system.
Essential Features of Braking
(i) It should be quick and reliable in action.
(ii) Braking force should be controllable.
(iii) Suitable means must be provided for dissipating the stored energy of the rotating parts.
(iv) A failure of any part of the breaking system should result in the application of brakes.
Braking Systems
Broadly, in electric drives, two systems of braking can be applied:
1. Mechanical braking: In mechanical braking the stored energy of rotating parts is dissipated 
in the form of heat where frictional torque acts against the rotation. The motor may be stopped 
by using a brake shoe or brake band or brake drum.
2. Electrical braking: In electrical braking, the kinetic energy of the motor is converted into 
electrical energy and is dissipated as heat in a resistance or returned to the supply system.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Electrical Braking over Mechanical Braking
Before dealing with electric braking, let us try to find out the advantages and disadvantages of electric 
braking over mechanical braking.
Advantages
(i) Saving; no replacement cost: In case of mechanical braking, due to friction there is excessive 
wear on brake lining which needs frequent and costly replacement. But in electric braking no 
such replacement is required hence saves money.
(ii) Small maintenance cost: In case of mechanical braking there is more wear and tear which 
increases the maintenance cost. There is no wear and tear in case of electric braking which 
reduces the maintenance cost to very low value.

DC Motors 
453
(iii) Energy saving: In regenerative braking, a part of energy is returned to the supply this reduces 
the operating cost. This is only possible in electric braking.
(iv) Reliability: In case of mechanical braking, the heat produced at brake blocks may result in 
failure of brakes. But in case of electric braking, the heat produced does not affect the braking 
system this improves its reliability.
(v) Smooth operation: Mechanical braking may produce jerks but electric braking never produces 
jerks.
(vi) System Capacity: By employing electric braking the capacity of the system can be increased 
by way of higher speeds and handling of heavy loads.
Disadvantages or Limitations
(i) It cannot hold the machine or load stationary: In case of electric braking, the driving motor 
starts working as a generator during braking period. But at stand-still the machine (motor) cannot 
work as generator. Therefore, an electric brake can reduce the speed of the machine or load and 
bring it to almost at stand-still condition but it cannot hold it stationary. Hence, electric brake 
alone cannot fulfil the purpose, friction (mechanical) brake is always provided in addition to 
it.
(ii) Cost: Addition equipment employed for electric braking increases the cost.
(iii) Choice of motor is limited: In case of electric braking system, the motor has to function as a 
generator and must have suitable braking characteristics. Thus, the choice of motor is limited.
Electric braking is superior to mechanical braking since it is much quicker and eliminates the 
cost of maintenance of mechanical brakes. However, in order to finally bring the motor to a stand 
still position and hold it there, friction brakes are also essential. 
5.26 Types of Electric Braking 
There are three types of electric braking.
(i) Plugging
(ii) Rheostatic braking
(iii) Regenerative braking.
5.26.1 Plugging
This is also called a counter-current braking. It is simplest type of braking and involves the reversing 
of the connections to the armature of the motor so that it tends to run in the reverse direction. In 
order to stop the machine, a special device must be installed to cut off the supply as soon as it comes 
to rest. This method can be applied to DC motors, induction motors and synchronous motors. It is 
particularly suitable where the drive has to be rapidly reversed such as in planning machines, etc.
(a) Plugging applied to DC Shunt motors: The direction of rotation of DC shunt motor can be 
reversed by reversing the current flowing through the armature. The expression for the armature 
current is Ia = V
E
R
b
a
-
.

454
Electrical Machines
Fig. 5.45 Plugging with shunt motor
During normal running, the back emf Eb is opposite to the applied voltage ‘V’ but at the instant 
of reversal a voltage equal to V + Eb is impressed across armature. This will cause a great 
rush of current (almost double the normal) in the armature circuit. To prevent this the starting 
resistance is reinserted in the circuit as shown in Fig. 5.45.
(b) Plugging applied to DC series motors: The method is same as in case of DC shunt motor. 
The changeover of connections is shown in Fig. 5.46.
Fig. 5.46 Plugging with series motor
In both cases, the motor must be disconnected from the supply when it comes to rest otherwise 
it may rotate in the opposite direction.
5.26.2 Rheostatic Braking
This is also called a dynamic braking. With this method of braking the motor is disconnected from 
the supply and used as a generator driven by the momentum of the equipment to be braked and 
supplying current to resistance; DC or synchronous motors can be braked in this way. The induction 
motors, however, require a separate source of DC excitation during this type of braking. This type 
of braking is applied to different motors as explained below;
(a) DC shunt motors: The armature is disconnected from the supply and a resistance is connected 
across it, as shown in Fig. 5.47(b). The motor then works as a separately excited generator and 
the braking torque is applied by the current flowing in the resistance as shown in Fig. 5.47.

DC Motors 
455
Fig. 5.47 Rheostatic braking of shunt motors
The magnitude of the braking effect can be controlled by varying either the resistance in the 
armature circuit or the field current. The braking is not effective if the supply fails during this 
period.
(b) DC series motors: The motor after being disconnected from the supply mains, works as a self 
excited series generator. Sometimes, in order to build up more field flux the connections of 
armature are reversed as shown in Fig. 5.48(b).
Fig. 5.48 Rheostatic braking of series motors
In such cases if the resistance is above a certain critical value equal to the initial slope of the 
current-voltage characteristics, the machine will not be self excited, therefore, resistance should 
be low enough.
5.26.3 Regenerative Braking
This type of braking is mostly employed in electric traction. The kinetic energy of the motor is 
converted into electrical energy, which is fed back to the supply lines instead of wasting it in a 
rheostat. This method can be applied to DC motors and induction motors.
(a) DC shunt motors: If the emf generated by the motor is greater than the supply voltage, power 
will be fed back to the supply. The emf in a shunt motor depends upon the field flux and speed. 
During this type of braking the field is disconnected from the armature and connected to a 
separate supply as shown in Fig. 5.49. The field current is so adjusted that E > V and this is 
returned to the mains.

456
Electrical Machines
Fig. 5.49 Regenerative braking with shunt motors
Alternatively, if the field excitation does not change but the load causes the speed to increase, the 
induced emf may become more than the supply voltage and power will be fed back to the supply.
(b) DC series motors: Regenerative braking cannot be applied to DC series motors in an ordinary 
way. For regenerative braking, the motor should work as a generator this is achieved by reversing 
the connections of series field. But even if the field connections are reversed at the exact moment, 
this method would still be not successful, because at the instant of reversal, the emf induced in 
the motor will be small, so the current will flow through the field winding in wrong direction, 
which will reverse the field and cause the motor emf to help the supply voltage. This will result 
in short circuit of supply. Due to these complications, this method is not used for common 
industrial purposes. However, regenerative braking can be applied with series motors used for 
traction purposes but in this case, either the field windings are modified or the machines are 
supplied with separate exciting windings.
Fig. 5.50 Regenerative braking with series motors
One method of regenerative braking with series motors is French method. If there is a single 
series motor, it is provided with one main series field winding and 2 or 3 auxiliary field windings. 

DC Motors 
457
During normal running the main and auxiliary field windings are placed in parallel with each 
other as shown in Fig. 5.50(a). During regenerative braking, the auxiliary windings are placed 
in series with each other and combination is connected in parallel across the armature and main 
series field winding as shown in Fig. 5.50(b). In this case the machine works as a differentially 
compound generator and sends back power to supply lines.
In locomotives there are four to six motors and therefore, no auxiliary windings are required. 
The regenerative braking can be applied in this case as shown in Fig. 5.51.
Fig. 5.51 Regenerative braking
An alternative method of regenerative braking is applied by using an exciter for controlling the 
excitation of the field windings during regeneration.

5.27 Losses in a DC Machine 
A DC machine is used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy or vice-versa. While doing 
so, the whole of input energy does not appear at the output but a part of it is lost in the form of heat 
in the surroundings. This wasted energy is called losses in the machine.
These losses affect the efficiency of the machine. A reduction in these losses leads to higher 
efficiency. Thus, the major objective in the design of a DC machine is to reduce these losses. The 
various losses occurring in a DC machine can be sub-divided as:
1. Copper losses.
2. Iron losses.
3. Mechanical losses
1. Copper losses: The various windings of the DC machine, made of copper, have some resistance. 
When current flows through them, there will be power loss proportional to the square of their 
respective currents. These power losses are called copper losses.
In general, the various copper losses in a DC machine are:
(i) Armature copper loss = I

The loss due to brush contact is generally included in armature copper loss.
2. Iron losses: The losses which occur in the iron parts of a DC machine are called iron losses 
or core losses or magnetic losses. These losses consist of the following:
(i) Hysteresis loss: Whenever a magnetic material is subjected to reversal of magnetic flux, 
this loss occurs. It is due to retentivity (a property) of the magnetic material. It is expressed 
with reasonable accuracy by the following expression:
Ph = Kh V f Bm
1 6◊
where,
Kh = hysteresis constant in J/m3 i.e., energy loss per unit volume of magnetic material 
during one magnetic reversal, its value depends upon nature of material;

DC Motors 
461
V = Volume of magnetic material in m3.
f = frequency of magnetic reversal in cycle/second and
Bm = maximum flux density in the magnetic material in Tesla.
It occurs in the rotating armature. To minimise this loss, the armature core is made of 
silicon steel which has low hysteresis constant.
(ii) Eddy current loss: When flux linking with the magnetic material changes (or flux is cut 
by the magnetic material) an emf is induced in it which circulates eddy currents through 
it. These eddy currents produce eddy current loss in the form of heat. It is expressed with 
reasonable accuracy by the expression:
Pe = Ke V f 2 t 2 Bm
2
where,
Ke = constant called co-efficient of eddy current, its value depends upon the nature of 
magnetic material;
t = thickness of lamination in m; V, f and Bm are the same as above.
The major part of this loss occurs in the armature core. To minimise this loss, the armature 
core is laminated into thin sheets (0·3 to 0·5 mm) since this loss is directly proportional to the 
square of thickness of the laminations.
3. Mechanical losses: As the armature of a DC machine is a rotating part, some power is required 
to overcome:
(i) Air friction of rotating armature (windage loss).
(ii) Friction at the bearing and friction between brushes and commutator (friction loss).
These losses are known as mechanical losses. To reduce these losses proper lubrication is done 
at the bearings.
5.28 Constant and Variable Losses 
The losses in a DC machine may also be sub-divided into two categories, i.e.,
1. Constant losses; 
2. Variable losses.
1. Constant losses: The losses in a DC machine which remain the same at all loads are called 
constant losses. The constant losses in a DC machine are:
(i) Iron losses; (ii) Mechanical losses; (iii) Shunt field copper losses.
2. Variable losses: The losses in a DC machine which vary with load are called variable losses.
The variable losses in a DC machine are:
(i) Armature copper loss; (ii) Series field copper loss; (iii) Interpole winding copper loss.
5.29 Stray Losses 
The sum of the iron loss and mechanical loss in a DC machine are known as stray losses i.e.,
Stray losses = Iron loss + Mechanical loss.

generator is shown in Fig. 5.52.

Although losses in a DC machine are the same whether it works as a generator or as a motor but 
the flow of power is opposite. The power flow diagram for a DC motor is shown in Fig. 5.53.

The ratio of output power to the input power of a DC machine is called its efficiency**.
Efficiency, K = Output
Input ;
* The ratio of output to input of a DC motor is called its commercial efficiency, i.e., h = output
input . The ratio of 
mechanical power output to the power developed in the armature is called its mechanical efficiency, i.e., h m
= 
mech. power output
mech. power developed in the armature The ratio of electrical power developed in the armature to the 
electrical power input is called electrical efficiency of the motor, i.e., he = power developed in the armature

5.33 Test Performed to Determine Efficiency of DC Machines 
To determine the efficiency of a DC machine namely, three methods can be used direct method, 
indirect method and regenerative method.
1. Direct Method. In this method, full load is applied to the machine and output is directly 
measured. Although, this method looks to be very simple but it is very difficult and inconvenient 
to apply full load to large size machines. Therefore, this method is restricted only to determine 
the efficiency of small sized machines. Brake test comes under this category.
2. Indirect Method. In this method, the losses are determined without actually loading the 
machine. The power is required to supply the losses only, therefore, large machines can be 
tested by applying this method. Accordingly, this method is usually employed to determine 
the efficiency of large DC shunt and compound wound machines. The major drawback of this 
method is that the temperature rise of the winding on load and commutating qualities cannot 
be assessed since the machine is operated at light loads. Swinburne’s test falls in this category.
3. Regenerative Method. In this method, two identical, mechanically coupled machines are used. 
One acts as a motor drawing power from the supply and the other acts as a generator which 

472
Electrical Machines
feeds the generated power back to the supply. Thus motor draws power equal to the total losses 
of the two machines at rated speed and load. Very large machines can be tested by this method. 
Moreover, the machines can be operated (or tested) for long duration and their performance 
regarding commutation, temperature rise, etc., can be studied conveniently. Hopkinson’s test 
falls in this category.
5.34 Brake Test 
It is a direct method of determining the efficiency of a DC motor. This test is performed only with 
small motors. The brake is applied to a pulley (either air cooled or water cooled) mounted on the 
motor shaft as shown in Fig. 5.57. The load on the motor is increased by tightening the belt mounted 
on the pulley. The electrical connections are made as shown in the circuit diagram.
Let, spring balance reading on tight side = W1 kg
Spring balance reading on loose side = W2 kg
Motor speed = N rpm (reading taken by tachometer)

This method of measuring efficiency has the following drawbacks:
(i) We cannot determine the efficiency of large machines because such facilities of loading are 
not available.
(ii) The output measured by this method is not accurate because belt is not offering a constant load 
(usually belt slips over the pulley)
A special precaution is to be observed while performing this test on a series motor. If the brakes 
applied fails, the motor may obtain a dangerously high speed; therefore, this test is usually applied 
only on shunt and compound machines.
Example 5.50
In a brake test, the DC motor took 38.5 A from a 240 V supply mains. The brake pulley of radius 
35 cm had an effective load of 30 kg and the speed was 720 rpm. Find the bhp (metric) and the 
efficiency at the above load.
Solution:

5.35 Swinburne’s Test 
Swinburne’s test is performed determine the constant losses in a 
DC shunt machine. In this test, the machine is operated as a motor 
on no-load. This no-load test is also known as Swinburne’s test. A 
voltmeter and two ammeters A1 and A2 are connected in the circuit 
as shown in Fig. 5.58. The normal rated voltage V is applied to the 
motor terminals. The ammeter A1 and A2 measure the no-load line 
current IL0 and shunt field current Ish respectively. The voltmeter 
measures the applied voltage. As there is no output at no-load, all 
the power supplied to the motor, given by the product of current 
IL0 and voltage V, is being utilised to meet with losses only. The 
following are the losses at no-load:
(i) Iron losses in the core
(ii) Windage and friction losses at bearing and commutator.
(iii) Shunt field copper losses.
(iv) Armature copper losses at no-load (very smell)

Advantages
1. Very convenient and economical method since power required is very small.
2. Stray or constant losses are determined, therefore, efficiency at any desired value of load can 
be determined.
Disadvantages
1. Since the test is performed at no-load, the effect of temperature rise and performance of 
commutator cannot be assessed properly.
2. This test cannot be performed with DC series motors because at no-load series motors obtain 
dangerously high speeds.
3. The change in iron losses from no-load to full-load are not accounted for, although this change 
is prominent due to armature reaction.

5.36 Hopkinson’s Test 
Hopkinson’s test is basically a regenerative test. It is also known as back-to-back test. To perform 
this test, two identical machines are required. These machines are mechanically coupled to each 
other. One of them works as a motor which acts as a prime-mover for the other machine which works 
as a generator.
The electrical power or energy supplied to the motor is converted into mechanical energy which 
is further converted into electrical energy by the second machine coupled to it, and fed back to the 
motor through supply system. In the process, in fact, the two machines draw electrical power or energy 
to meet with the losses of the two machines. Since the mechanics are identical, the losses in each 
machine are determined by dividing the input into two equal parts. Usually, this test is performed 
on large size machines at full-load for longer duration.
Circuit Arrangements and Procedure of Performing the Test
The electrical circuit arrangement is shown in Fig. 5.61.

Electrical Machines
Fig. 5.61 Circuit arrangement for Hopkinson’s test
Connect machine-I to the supply through its main switch (motor) and starter keeping main switch 
of the other machine-II open. Operate machine-I to its rated speed and adjust the field current Ishg of 
second machine such that the voltage developed by this machine (working as a generator) is 1 to 2V 
more than the mains voltage having same polarity as that of bus-bars. The voltage and polarity can 
be checked with the help of a paralleling voltmeter V. Now, connect the second machine (generator) 
to the mains through its main switch.
It may be noted that a machine with smaller excitation acts as a motor and a machine with larger 
excitation acts as a generator.
To increase the load, the excitation of machine-I (i.e., motor) is decreased gradually. With the 
decrease in excitation its back emf decreases due to which motor draws more current from the mains. 
This process goes on till the machine draws its full-load current as per the rating. During this process, 
the supply voltage must be maintained at its rated value.
The value of the resistances involved in the armature circuit such as armature winding resistance 
including brush contact, interpole winding resistance, compensating winding resistance of the two 
machines are measured by passing full-load current through them after the completion of whole 
procedure when these windings attain their final temperature at full-load.
Let various ammeters A1, A2, A3, A4 and A5 connected in the circuit shown in Fig. 5.61 measure 
line current IL, motor current Im, motor shunt field current Ishm, generator current Ig and generator 
shunt field current Ishg respectively.
Where, motor current, Im = IL + Ig 
(as per Kirchhoff’s current law) …(5.39)
Motor input = VIm 
…(5.40)
and generator output = VIg 
…(5.41)
where V is bus = bar voltage.
If Km and Kg are the efficiencies of motor and generator respectively,

then 
motor output = VIm Km 
…(5.42)
and 
generator input =

But

This assumption is true for large machines since there is very slight difference in their armature 
and excitation current, but in case of small machines, the difference between the armature currents 
and shunt field currents is large. To obtain accurate results, armature and shunt field losses are 
determined separately and stray losses are assumed to be equal in both the machines.

Thus, the efficiency of motor and generator can be determined from the data available from the test.
Advantages
(i) It is economical since small power is required.
(ii) The performance of the machines regarding commutation and temperature rise, etc., can be 
conveniently studied as the machines are tested at full-load, that too for long duration.
(iii) Accurate results are obtained since the efficiency is determined under load conditions and the 
stray load loss are being taken into account.
Disadvantage
The main disadvantage of this test is that there is necessity of two identical machines which are 
rarely available.

Example 5.58
The Hopkinson test on two shunt machines gave the following results for full load: 
Line voltage, 250 V; line current excluding field currents, 50 A; motor armature current 380 
A ; field currents, 5A and 4.2 A. Calculate the efficiency of each machine. Armature resistance of 
each machine is 0.02 ohm.
Solution.
Here, V = 250 V; Iam = 380 A; IL = 50 A; Ra = 0.2 :
In Hopkinson’s test, the machine working as a generator must have field current more than the 
machine working as a motor.
Fig. 5.63 Circuit diagram
Therefore, 
Ishg = 5A; Ishm = 4.2 A
Current drawn by the motor, Im = Iam + Ishm
= 380 + 4.2 = 384.2 A
Current delivered by the generator,
Ig = Im – IL
= 384.2 – 50 = 334.2 A
Iag = Ig – Ishg

Armature copper loss in motor = (Iam)2Ra = (380)2 × 0.02 = 2888 W
Armature copper loss in generator = (Iag)2Ra = (329.2)2 × 0.02 = 2168 W

5.37 Testing of DC Series Machines 
(Field test)
Small DC series machines can be tested by brake test but large DC series machines cannot be tested 
by brake test because neither it is convenient nor possible to develop a mechanism to apply load on 
such large machines directly.
Moreover, DC series machines cannot be tested by Swinburne’s test, because at no-load these 
machines obtain dangerously high speeds. In view of this*, field testis considered to be most suitable 
for determining efficiency of these machines.
Field Test
To determine efficiency of large DC series machines usually field test is employed. To perform this 
test, two** identical DC series machines are coupled mechanically, as shown in Fig. 5.65, and their 
fields are connected in series so that the iron losses of both the machines be made equal. One of the 
machine-I to which supply is given, operates as a motor and drives the other machine-II. This other 
machine operates as a separately excited generator. A variable load RL is connected directly across 
its terminals without any switch.
Fig. 5.65 Circuit arrangement for field test of DC series motors
Performance
The machine-I (motor) is switched-ON to the supply in a usual manner and the output of the other 
machine-II, working as a generator, is dissipated in the variable load resistor RL. The voltage across 
the motor terminals V2 is kept equal to its rated value. It is obvious that the supply voltage V1 will 
be more than V2 i.e., V1 = V2 + ImRseg. The load resistor RL is varied till the ammeter A1, shows full-
*Field test looks to be similar to regenerative test but it is not so because in this case the output of the generator is not 
feedback to the motor rather it is dissipated in a load resistor. This will be confirmed after going through the test. 
**It is not difficult to have two identical DC series machines because in electric traction DC series motors are used in pairs.

load motor current. The hot resistances of various windings are measured by voltmeter-ammeter 
(or other suitable) method after performing the test. Note down the readings of various measuring 
instruments as mentioned below:
Precautions
Every effort is to be made to get accurate measurements since the accuracy of the test depends upon 
the accuracy of these measurements.
Let,

Disadvantages of Field Test Method
1. Even for a small error in the measurement of the input to motor or output of generator may 
cause a relatively large error in computed the efficiency.
2. Whole of the power supplied to the set is wasted.
Example 5.60
The following test data is obtained after performing a field test on two identical, mechanically 
coupled DC series motors (with their field windings connected in series):
Motor: Armature current-50 A, Armature voltage-500 V; Field winding voltage drop 35 V

5.38 Inspection/maintenance of DC Machines
The basic purpose of inspection/maintenance is to ensure uninterrupted and efficient service from 
the machine. The frequency of routine inspection/maintenance depends upon conditions under which 
a machine is operating. The normal routine inspection/maintenance tasks are discussed below :
1. Mechanical maintenance
(i) Bearings: Check sound and excessive play if any. Check for proper lubrication-avoid 
excessive lubrication.
(ii) General: Check all the fixing fixtures – tight them it required.
Check that all the cover-plates and enclosures are clean and correctly in place – if not fix them.
2. Electrical maintenance
Always keep the insulation dry and in good condition for better reliability.
(i) Commutator: Trouble may be caused due to dirt deposits deposit, of carbon dust in the 
grooves between segments, rough surface or eccentricity. Check for these and clean the 
commutator surface with a dry soft fluff free cloth if required.
(ii) Brushes: Trouble may be caused due to less spring tension, wrong brush positioning, 
insufficient contact surface or too short a brush. Check for there and do the adjustments 
or changes as per the need.

Electrical Machines
(iii) Winding: Trouble may be caused due to deterioration of insulation. Check the insulation 
resistance of armature winding and field winding periodically – if faculty, it should be 
repaired.
(iv) Insulation resistance: The insulation resistance of the whole machine be checked 
periodically which should not be less than 1 M :. If its value is found to be less than this 
then the machine should be cleaned and dried.
(v) Earthing: Outer frame of the motor must be properly earth, the earth resistance should be 
checked, if found more pour water in earthing pit.
(vi) Starter: Check the functioning of the starter, its relay must be sensitive enough to protect 
the machine.
5.39 Faults in DC Machines 
In DC machines faults may occur in field windings or in armature winding.
1. Faults in field winding: The faults in field winding may be
(a) Open circuit fault: Check the winding for open circuit, if found faulty, check the opening 
at the terminals if so tight-up the terminals otherwise replace the field winding.
(b) Earth fault: Check for the earth fault, if found remove it or replace the coil.
(c) Short circuit fault: Check for the voltage drop in each turn and locate the fault and replace 
the turn or repair the field winding.
2. Faults in armature winding: In armature winding, following faults may develop:
(i) Short-circuit in coils: The turns placed in the same slot of the armature may get short 
circuited due to insulation failure between the turns. Heavy local current flows and heat 
is produced. This may lead to open circuit. The heavy current is purely local and it does 
not over-load the brushes.
(ii) Open-circuit in coils: Due to open circuiting of armature coil, half of the armature which 
carries sound coils carries double the normal current and the other portion carries no 
current. This produces heavy sparking at the brushes which may damage it. Therefore 
machine has to be stopped and repaired immediately.
(iii) Earthed coil:When a coil in the armature comes in direct contact with armature stampings 
due to insulation rupturing, the fault is called earth fault. If this fault occurs at one place, 
the effect is not that serious but if this fault occurs at two places, the two coils are being 
short circuited causing a serious short circuit fault which produces heavy sparking due to 
unbalancing of armature currents.
5.40 Trouble Shooting in a DC Motor 
For trouble shooting of a DC motor, the following steps are taken:
1. Check the fuses.
2. Check the electrical connections at the terminals
3. Check the wear and tear of the brushes.

Q.3. How do the various losses occurring in a DC machine vary with the load?
Ans. The copper losses occurring in armature windings i.e., series field winding, compensating winding and 
interpole winding, vary as the square of the load current whereas copper losses occurring in DC shunt 
field winding is constant. Iron and mechanical losses are independent of load and remain constant.
Q.4. What are the components of iron loss in DC machine and in which part of the machine it occurs? 
Ans. The components of iron loss are hysteresis and eddy-current losses obviously these losses occur in 
the iron parts of the machine such as armature core, pole shoe, etc.

Ans. Basically, direct, indirect and regenerative tests are performed to determine the efficiency of DC machines.
Q.7. Can a Swinburne’s test be applied to a DC series motor? Justify.
Ans. No, Swinburne’s test is performed at no-load and at no-load series motors obtain dangerously high 
speed and gets damaged. Therefore, Swinburne’s test cannot be applied for determining efficiency of 
DC series motors.
Q.8. What is the main drawback of brake test?
Ans. The output of the motor cannot be measured accurately.
Q.9. Why constant losses can be considered equal to input to a machine at no-load?

winding and compensating winding, if any) are negligible owing to very small armature current.
Q.10. State the advantages of Swinburne’s test.
Ans. Advantages of Swinburne’s test are:

Introduction
In an AC system voltage level can be increased or decreased (as per requirement) very easily with 
the help of a transformer, therefore, this system is exclusively used for generation, transmission and 
distribution of electric power. The mechanical power or energy is converted into electrical power 
or energy with the help of an AC machine called alternator or synchronous generator. However, 
when the same machine can be used to convert electrical power or energy into mechanical power 
or energy, then it is known as a synchronous motor. Thus, the same machine can be operated as a 
generator or as a motor and in general, it is called as a synchronous machine. In fact, it is a machine 
which rotates only at synchronous speed (NS = 120 f/P) under all conditions. To understand the 
construction, working and performance of the machine its study is divided into number of main 
topics as chapters, to be followed.
In this chapter, the readers will go through various topics related to this machine when working 
as a synchronous generator or alternator.
6.1 General Aspects of Synchronous Machines
A machine in which the following relation is maintained for its satisfactory operation is called a 
synchronous machine (The machine may work as a generator or motor):
NS = 120 f
P
or f = PNS
120
where NS is the synchronous speed in rpm;
f is the supply frequency and
P is the number of poles of the machine.
When the machine is to work as a generator, it has to run at synchronous speed (NS) to generate 
power at certain frequency (f), called power frequency. In India its value is 50 Hz, whereas in the
USA it is kept at 60 Hz.
When the machine works as a motor, it can rotate only at synchronous speed (NS) since the magnetic 
poles are locked with the revolving field. If the machine fails to rotate at synchronous speed, it is 
palled out of step and stops.
Hence, synchronous machine (generator or motor) is a machine which only runs at synchronous 
speed and maintains the relation;
NS = 120 f /P rpm

Electrical Machines
6.2 Basic Principles
A synchronous machine is just an electro-mechanical transducer which converts mechanical energy 
into electrical energy or vice-versa. The fundamental phenomenon which make these conversions 
possible are :
(i) the law of electro-magnetic induction and (ii) law of interaction.
(i) Law of electromagnetic induction: This relates to the production of emf, i.e., emf is induced in 
a conductor whenever it cuts across the magnetic field (see Fig. 6.1). This is called Faraday’s 
first law of electromagnetic induction.
(ii) Law of interaction: This law relates to the phenomenon of production of force. or torque i.e.,
whenever a current carrying conductor is placed in the magnetic field, by the interaction of the 
magnetic fields produced by the current carrying conductor and the main field, force is exerted 
on the conductor and torque is developed (see Fig. 6.2).

1. In generator action, the rotation is due to 
mechanical torque, therefore, Tm and Z are in the 
same direction.
2. The frictional torque Tf acts in opposite direction 
to rotation Z.
3. Electromagnetic torque Teacts in opposite direction 
to mechanical torque Tm so that ZTm = ZTe + ZTf.
4. In generator action, an emf is induced in the 
armature conductors which circulates current in 
the armature when load is connected to it. Hence, 
e and i both are in the same direction.
5. In generator action, E > V
6. In generator action, the torque angle T is leading.
7. In generator action, mechanical energy is converted 
into electrical energy.
1. In motoring action, the rotation is due to electro-
magnetic torque, therefore, Te and Z are in the 
same direction.
2. The frictional torque Tf acts in opposite direction 
to rotation Z.
3. Mechanical torque Tm acts in opposite direction to 
electromagnetic torque Te so that ZTe = ZTm + ZTf.
4. In motoring action, current is impressed to the 
armature against the induced emf (e), therefore 
current flows in opposite direction to that of 
induced emf.
5. In motor action, E < V
6. In motoring action, the torque angle T is lagging.
7. In motoring action, electrical energy is converted 
into mechanical energy.

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
503
6.3 Generator and Motor Action 
In generator action, an emf is induced in the armature conductors when they cut across the magnetic 
field. On closing the circuit, current flows through the armature conductors which produces another 
field. By the interaction of this field and main field a force is exerted on the conductor which acts is 
opposite direction to that of rotation. It is this force against which the relative motion of conductors 
has to be maintained by the mechanical power supplied by the prime-mover, thus the mechanical 
power is converted into electrical power.
In motor action, a current is supplied to the machine which flows through the armature conductors. 
The armature conductors produce a field which interacts with the main field. Thus, a force is exerted 
on the conductors and rotation takes place (i.e., torque is developed). Once rotation occurs, an emf 
is induced in the conductors due to relative motion. This emf acts in opposite direction to the flow 
of current. The flow of current has to be maintained against this emf by applying external voltage 
source thus electrical power is converted into mechanical power.
6.4 Production of Sinusoidal Alternating emf
When a conductor or coil cuts across the magnetic field an emf is induced in it by the phenomenon 
called electromagnetic induction. This can be achieved either by rotating a coil in the stationary 
magnetic field or by keeping the coil stationary and rotating the magnetic field. (The magnetic field 
can be rotated by placing the field winding on the rotating part of the machine).
For illustration see Figs. 6.5(a) and (b), two positions of a coil rotating in a stationary magnetic 
field are shown. Whereas, in Figs. 6.5(c) and (d), two positions of a rotating electro-magnet in a coil 
placed on stationary armature are shown. At first instant, the emf induced in the coil is zero since 
flux cut by the coil is zero. However, at second instant, the emf induced in the coil is maximum (say 
positive). The two instants t1 and t2 are marked on the wave diagram shown in Fig. 6.5(e). In one 
revolution the induced emf completes one cycle and its wave shape is shown in Fig. 6.5(e).

6.6 Advantages of Rotating Field System over Stationary Field System
Only in small synchronous machines the field system is placed on stator and armature winding on 
rotor, but in larger machines, the field winding is placed on the rotor and armature winding is placed 
on the stator. The rotating field and stationary armature system is preferred over stationary field and 
rotating armature system.
Following are the important advantages of rotating field system over stationary field system:
(i) The armature winding is more complex than the field winding. Therefore, it is easy to place 
armature winding on stationary structure.
(ii) In the modern alternators (synchronous generators), high voltage is generated, therefore, heavy 
insulation is provided and it is easy to insulate the high voltage winding when it is placed on 
stationary structure.
(iii) The size of the armature conductors is much more to carry heavy current, therefore, high 
centrifugal stresses are developed. Thus, it is preferred to place them on stationary structure.
(iv) The size of slip rings depends upon the magnitude of flow of current, therefore, it is easy to 
deliver small current for excitation, through slip rings of smaller size when rotating field system 
is used.

505
(v) It is easier to build and properly balance high speed rotors when they carry the lighter field 
system.
(vi) The weight of rotor is small when field system is provided on rotor and as such friction losses 
are produced.
(vii) Better cooling system can be provided when the armature is kept stationary.
6.7 Constructional Features of Synchronous Machines
The important parts of a synchronous machine are given below:
1. Stator 
2. Rotor 
3. Miscellaneous
1. Stator: The outer stationary part of the machine is called stator; it has the following important 
parts:
(i) Stator frame: It is the outer body of the machine made of cast iron and it protects the inner 
parts of the machine. It can be also made of any other strong material since it is not to 
carry the magnetic field. Cast iron is used only because of its high mechanical strength.
(ii) Stator Core: The stator core is made of silicon steel material. It is made from number of 
stamping which are insulated from each other. Its function is to provide an easy path for 
the magnetic lines of force and accommodate the stator winding.
(iii) Stator Winding: Slots are cut on the inner periphery of the stator core in which three-phase 
or one-phase winding is placed. Enamelled copper is used as winding material.
2. Rotor: The rotating part of the machine is called rotor. From construction point of view, there 
are two types of rotors named as
(i) Salient pole type rotor; (ii) Non-salient pole type rotor.
(i) Salient pole type rotor: In this case, projected poles are provided on the rotor. The cost 
of construction of salient pole type rotors is low, moreover sufficient space is available 
to accommodate field winding but these cannot bear high mechanical stresses at high 
speeds. Therefore, salient pole 
type construction is suited 
for medium and low speeds 
and are usually employed 
at hydro-electric and diesel 
power plants as synchronous 
generators. Since the speed of 
these machines (generators) 
is quite low, to obtain the 
required frequency, the 
machines have large number 
of poles as shown in Figs. 6.7 
and 6.8. To accommodate 
such a large number of poles, 
these machines have larger 
diameter and small length. 
Fig. 6.7 Salient pole type alternator.

506
Electrical Machines
For a speed of 200 rpm (alternators coupled with water turbines) the diameter of the 
machines is as large as 14 metre and length is only 1 metre. The salient pole type rotor 
has the following important parts:
Fig. 6.8 
Parts of rotor of salient pole alternator
(a) Spider: Spider is made of cast iron to provide an easy path for the magnetic flux. It 
is keyed to the shaft and at the outer surface, pole core and pole-shoe are keyed to it 
[see Fig. 6.9(a)].
(b) Pole core and pole shoe: It is made of laminated sheet material [see Figs. 6.8 
(b) and 6.9(b)]. Pole core provides least reluctance path for the magnetic field and pole 
shoe distributes the field over the whole periphery uniformly to produce sinusoidal 
wave form of the generated emf.
Fig. 6.9 (a) Spider
Fig. 6.9 (b) Pole core pole shoe
(c) Field winding or Exciting winding: Field winding [see Fig. 6.8 (c)] is wound on the 
former and then placed around the pole core. DC supply is given to it through slip 

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
507
rings. When direct current flows through the field winding, it produces the required 
magnetic field.
(d) Damper winding: At the outermost periphery, holes are provided [see Fig. 6.9 (b)] in 
which copper bars are inserted and short-circuited at both the sides by rings forming 
damper winding.
Generally, the segments on individual poles are joined together to form common rings 
resulting in a short-circuited squirrel cage winding similar to that used in induction 
machines with squirrel cage rotors. Salient pole machines are frequently provided with 
a damper winding on the rotor to damp rotor oscillations during transient-conditions 
and to facilitate smooth operation under unbalanced load conditions.
Fig. 6.10 Salient pole type alternator mounted vertically at hydro-electric power plant (half-sectional view)
At hydro-electric power plants, usually, salient pole type alternators are placed with 
their shafts in vertical position, as shown in Fig. 6.10.
(ii) Non-salient pole type rotor: A non-salient pole alternator is shown in Fig. 6.11. In this 
case, there are no projected poles but the poles are formed by the current flowing through 

508
Electrical Machines
the rotor (exciting) winding. Non-salient pole type construction is suited for the high 
speeds. The steam turbines rotate at a high speed (3000 rpm). When these turbines are 
used as prime-mover for this machine working as a generator, a small number of poles 
are required for given frequency. Hence, these machines have smaller diameter and larger 
length. Non salient pole type rotors have the following parts:
(a) Rotor core: Rotor core is made of silicon steel stampings. It is keyed to the shaft. At 
the outer periphery slots are cut in which exciting coils are placed. It provides an easy 
path to the magnetic flux.
(b) Rotor winding or Exciting winding: It is placed in rotor slots and current is passed 
through the winding in such a way that poles are formed according to the requirement 
(see Fig. 6.12).
Fig. 6.11 Non-salient pole type alternator
Fig. 6.12 Non-salient pole type rotor
3. Miscellaneous Parts: The following are few important miscellaneous parts; 
(i) Brushes: Brushes are made of carbon and these just slip over the slip rings. DC supply is 
given to the brushes. From brushes current flows to the slip rings and then to the exciting 
winding.
(ii) Bearings: Bearings are provided between the shaft and outer stationary body to reduce 
the friction. The material used for their construction is high carbon steel.
(iii) Shaft: Shaft is made of mild steel. Mechanical power is taken or given to the machine 
through shaft.
Some Special Features of Salient and Non-salient Structures
Usually the salient pole field structure has the following special features:
(i) These are of larger diameter and shorter length.
(ii) Usually, 2/3rd of the pole pitch is covered by the pole shoes

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
509
(iii) To reduce eddy current losses, the poles are laminated.
(iv) The machine having such structure are employed with hydraulic turbines or with diesel engines 
which are usually operated at low speeds (100 to 375 rpm)
The non-salient field structure has the following special features.
(i) They are of smaller diameter and of very long axial length.
(ii) Robust construction and noiseless operation.
(iii) Less windage (air-resistance) loss.
(iv) Better in dynamic balancing.
(v) High operating speed (3000 rpm).
(vi) Nearly sinusoidal flux distribution around the periphery, and therefore, gives a better emf 
waveform than that obtainable with salient poles field structure.
(vii) There is no need of providing damper windings (except in special cases to assist in synchronising) 
because the solid field poles themselves act as efficient dampers.
Air-gap and its Significance
A very small air-gap increases the stray-load loss and synchronous reactance Xd. A large air-gap 
needs larger excitation current. Therefore, a compromise has to be made. Generally the ratio of air-
gap to the pole pitch is between 0.008 and 0.02.
6.8 Excitation Systems 
Since the field winding is on rotor, a special arrangement is necessary to connect DC source to the 
field. In small size synchronous machines, generally the field winding is excited from a separate 
DC source through sliprings and brushes. Sliprings are metal rings completely encircling the shaft 
of the machine, but insulated from it. A brush rides and slips over each slipring. The positive end of 
a DC voltage source is connected to one brush and negative end is connected to another brush. In 
large machines, various schemes are employed to supply DC excitation to the field winding. Some 
of the most important excitation systems are given below:
6.8.1 DC Exciters
This is a conventional method of exciting the field windings of synchronous generators. In this method, 
three machines namely pilot exciter, main exciter and the main 3-phase alternator are mechanically 
coupled and are therefore, driven by the same shaft. The pilot exciter is a DC shunt generator feeding 
the field winding of a main exciter. The main exciter is a separately-excited DC generator which 
provides the necessary current to the field winding of the main alternator through brushes and slip 
rings as shown in Fig. 6.13. 
This conventional method of excitation suffers from cooling and maintenance problems associated 
with slip rings, brushes and commutator with the higher rating alternators. The modern excitation 
systems have been developed by eliminating the sliding contacts and brushes. This has led to develop 
static and brushless-excitation systems.

510
Electrical Machines
Fig. 6.13 Circuit diagram of DC exciter
6.8.2 Static Excitation System
In this method, the excitation power for the main alternator field is drawn from output terminals 
of the main 3-phase alternator itself. For this purpose, a three-phase transformer T1 steps down the 
alternator voltage to the desired value. This three-phase voltage is fed to a three-phase full wave 
bridge rectifier using thyristors. The firing angle of these thyristors is controlled by means of a 
regulator which picks up the signal from alternator terminals through potential transformer PT and 
current transformer CT as shown in Fig. 6.14. The controlled DC power output from thyristor unit is 
delivered to the field winding of main alternator through brushes and slip rings as shown in Fig. 6.14. 
Fig. 6.14 Circuit diagram of a static exciter
While initiating the process of static excitation, first of all, field winding is switched on to the 
battery bank to establish field current in the alternator. The alternator speed is adjusted to rated 
speed. When the output voltage from alternator is built up sufficiently, the alternator field windings is 

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
511
disconnected from battery bank and is switched on to the thyristor bridge output. Sufficient protection 
devices are installed in the static excitation scheme for any possible fault in the excitation system.
The advantages of static excitation are as follows:
1. Its response time is very small about 20 m sec.
2. It eliminates the exciter windage loss and commutator, bearing and winding maintenance.
3. As the excitation energy is taken from alternator terminals itself, the excitation voltage is directly 
proportional to alternator’s speed. This improves the overall system performance.
6.8.3 Brushless Excitation System
Figure 6.15 shows a simplified diagram of a brushless excitation system. The excitation system 
consists of an alternator rectifier main exciter and a pilot exciter (permanent magnet generator PMG). 
Both the main exciter and pilot exciter are driven directly from the main shaft. The main exciter 
has a stationary field and a rotating armature, which is directly connected, through silicon rectifiers 
S1, to the main alternator field. Thus the sliprings and brushes are eliminated. The main exciter’s 
field is fed from a shaft driven PMG, having rotating permanent magnets attached to the shaft and 
a stationary 3-phase armature. The AC output of PMG is rectified by three-phase full-wave phase 
controlled thyristor bridges. The thyristor assembly is usually housed in removable drawers, which 
can be taken out easily for repair. The thyristor bridges are controlled by a set of dual firing circuits 
operating in parallel. 
Fig. 6.15 Brushless excitation system for synchronous generator
The base excitation is controlled by an input setting to the thyristor gating circuits. This control 
signal is derived from the PMG via a regulated DC supply, which also serves the regulator logic 
circuitry. The regulator controls excitation by supplying a buck-boost control signal, which adds 
algebraically to the base setting. The regulator elements also comprise of solid state circuits.
This excitation system has a short time constant and a response time of less than 0.1 second.

6.9 Armature Winding
In the large synchronous machines, stationary part is the armature. On the inner periphery of the 
stator core, number of slots (mostly open parallel sided slots) are provided. In these slots armature 
winding is placed. 
6.10 Types of Armature Winding
Various types of winding schemes can be adopted to wound the armature of an alternator, a few of 
them are given below:
1. Single-phase and poly-phase windings: When only one winding is placed on the armature 
and only one emf is obtained at the output, winding is called single-phase winding.
When more than one windings are placed on the armature and emfs induced are more than one, 
displaced from each other by some angle, the winding is called poly-phase winding. Mostly 
three-phase winding is provided on the armature.
2. Concentrated and distributed windings: When one slot per pole or slots equal to the number 
of poles are employed, the windings thus obtained are called concentrated windings. Such 
windings give maximum induced emfs for given number of conductors but the wave form of 
induced emf is not exactly sinusoidal.
When number of slots per poles are more than one, the windings thus obtained are called 
distributed windings. Such windings give slightly less than maximum induced emf for a given 
number of conductors but the wave form of induced emf is more sinusoidal.
3. Single layer and double layer windings: When only one coil side is placed in a slot, the winding 
is called single layer winding. However, when two coil sides are placed in one slot, one over 
the other, the winding is called double layer winding.
4. Full pitched and short pitched windings: When the two coil sides of the same coil are 180 
electrical degrees apart, the winding is called full pitch winding. When the two sides of the 
same coil are less than 180 electrical degrees apart, the winding is called short pitch winding.
The emf induced in each coil is maximum with full pitch winding scheme is employed whereas 

514
Electrical Machines
emf induced in the short pitch winding is less than that. However, short pitch winding is preferred 
over full pitch winding because of the following reasons:
(i) It decreases the length at the end-connections and thus amount of copper required is saved.
(ii) It reduces the slot reactance and thus improves the wave shape of the generated emf, i.e., the 
generated emf can be made to approximately sinusoidal more easily by properly chording 
the winding.
(iii) It reduces or eliminates distorting harmonics in the wave form of generated emf
The only disadvantage of short pitch winding is that a few more turns are used to obtain the 
same voltage as it would be induced in full pitch winding.
5. Concentric (or spiral), Lap and Wave windings: When each group of coils under a pole is 
arranged into a sort of concentric shape i.e., when the current flow is traced through one such 
properly connected set of coils that the conductors seem to form a spiral around a portion of 
the core (see Fig. 6.16) the winding is called concentric or chain or spiral winding. This type 
of winding scheme is preferred for large diameter, low speed synchronous machines.
Fig. 6.16 Concentric winding
In the alternators, the lap and wave windings give the same emf as long as the other conditions 
are the same. In case of lap winding as shown in Fig. 6.17, coils or coil sides overlap the other 
consecutively and connections are made. Whereas in wave winding, as shown in Fig. 6.18 the 
coils are always forward connected. The connections of a lap winding are simpler to that of the 
wave winding, therefore lap winding is exclusively used.
Fig. 6.17 Lap winding 

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
515
Fig. 6.18 Wave winding
6.11 Important Terms Used in Armature Winding
Some of the important terms used in the armature winding are given below:
(i) Electrical angle: When a conductor passes through a pair of poles, one cycle of emf is induced 
in it. Thus a pair of poles represents an angle of 360 electrical degrees.
There is a perfect relation between electrical and mechanical angle.
Electrical angle = Mechanical angle × Pair of poles.
(ii) Pole pitch: Distance between two neutral axis (or similar points) of adjacent poles is called 
poles pitch. The pole pitch can be expressed as number of slots per poles or electrical degrees 
(i.e., 180° elect.), refer to Fig. 6.20.
If S is the number of slots on the whole periphery of armature and P is the number of poles, 
Then,
Pole pitch = No. of slots per pole = S/P.
(iii) Coil: Two conductors placed in the two slots displaced by pole pitch (in full pitch winding) or 
less than pole pitch (in short pitch winding), connected at one side by the end connections form 
a single turn coil as shown in Fig. 6.19(a). When number of turns are connected in series and 
each side (coil side) is placed in the slot, it is called a multi-turn coil as shown in Figs. 6.19(b) 
and (c). The multi-turn coil is shown in Fig. 6.19(d) by a single line diagram.
Fig. 6.19 Single and multi-turn coils

Electrical Machines
(iv) Coil pitch or coil span: The distance between two active sides of a coil is called coil span. It 
is expressed in terms of number of slots or electrical degrees. Refer to Fig. 6.20.
Fig. 6.20 Distributed winding
(v) Slot pitch: The distance between centre points (or similar points) of two consecutive slots or 
teeth is called slot pitch. It is expressed in electrical degrees. Refer to Fig. 6.20.
slop pitch, D = 
180º
No. of slots/pole
(vi) Phase spread: The angle or space of pole face over which coil sides of the same phase are spread 
is called phase spread, as shown in Fig. 6.20. In a distributed winding, the conductors of one 
phase under one pole are spread in number of slots so that each phase has equal distribution. 
In a three phase winding:

When three windings are placed on the armature and three emfs are obtained at the output which are 
displaced by an angle of 120 degree electrical, the winding is called three-phase winding.
Q.2. What do you mean by single-layer and double-layer winding?
Ans. When only one coil side is placed in a slot, the winding is called single layer winding. However, when 
two coil sides are placed in one slot, one over the other, the winding is called double layer winding.
Q.3. Why do we prefer short-pitched winding?
Ans. Short pitch winding is preferred over full pitch winding because of the following reasons:
(i) It decreases the length at the end-connections and thus amount of copper required is saved.
(ii) It reduces the slot reactance and thus improves the wave shape of the generated emf i.e., the generated 
emf can be made to approximately sinusoidal more easily by properly chording the winding.
(iii) It reduces or eliminates distorting harmonics in the wave form of generated emf
Q.4. What is difference between electrical and mechanical angle?
Ans. A pair of poles represents an angle of 360 electrical degrees but the physical angular displacement i.e., 
mechanical angle depends upon number of poles on the machine. There is a perfect relation between 
electrical and mechanical angle.
Electrical angle = Mechanical angle × Pair of poles.
6.12 Coil Span Factor
In a full pitch winding the coil span or coil pitch is always equal to the pole pitch which is equal to 
180 electrical degrees. When the coil span is less than 180 electrical degrees, the winding is called 
short pitched or fractional pitch or chorded winding as shown in Fig. 6.26.
Fig. 6.26 Short pitched winding
Fig. 6.27 Phasor diagram
Let ‘e’ be the induced emf in each of the two sides of the same coil. For a full pitch winding the 
emf induced in two sides of the coil i.e., OA and AB are 180 electrical degrees apart as shown in Fig. 
27. However, when the winding is short pitched by an angle E electrical degrees, the emf induced in 
the two sides of the coil are OA and AC, i.e., (180 – E) electrical degrees apart of shown in Fig. 6.27.
For a full pitch winding,
Total induced emf in the coil = OA + AB = e + e = 2e

522
Electrical Machines
For a short pitch winding,
Total, induced emf in the coil = OC = OD + DC
= OA cos E/2 + AC cos E/2 
(where AD is A on OC)
= e cos E/2 + e cos E/2
= 2 e cos E/2
The ratio of induced emf in a coil when the winding is short pitched to the induced emf in the 
same coil when it is full pitched is called a coil span factor or pitch factor or chorded factor and 
it is generally denoted be Kc. It is always less than unity.

6.13 Distribution Factor
In a concentrated winding, all the conductors of any one phase, which lie under a single pole, are 
placed in a single slot. When the conductors of one phase, which lie under a single pole, are placed 
in several slots, the winding is called distributed winding. A distributed winding is shown in Fig. 
6.28 in which there are 12 slots per pole for a three-phase winding or four slots per pole per phase. 
In a distributed winding, the number of coils representing each phase are connected in series and 
is called a coil group.
Fig. 6.28 Distributed winding
The emfs induced in the conductors lying in two adjacent slots is similar in wave shape and 
magnitude but there is a phase difference between them. This phase difference is equal to the angular 
displacement between two adjacent slots, i.e., slot pitch.

6.14 Winding Factor
The combined effect of coil span factor and distribution factor is known as winding factor. In fact,
winding factor is the product of coil span factor and distribution factor.
Kw = Kc × Kd
6.15 Generation of Three-phase emf
In a three-phase system, there are equal voltages (or emfs) of the same frequency having a phase 
difference of 120°. These voltages can be produced by a three-phase AC generator having three 
identical windings (or phases) fixed on the some spindle and displaced by 120° electrical. When 
these windings are rotated in a stationary magnetic field as shown in Fig. 6.30(a) or when these 
windings are kept stationary and the magnetic field is rotated [see Fig. 6.30(b)], an emf is induced 
in each winding or phase. These emfs are of same magnetic and frequency but are displaced from 
one another by 120° electrical.
Consider three identical coils a1 a2, b1 b2 and c1c2 mounted on the rotor as shown in Fig. 6.30 
(a) or placed on the stationary armature as shown in Fig. 6.30 (b). Here, a1, b1 and c1 are the start 
terminals, whereas, a2, b2 and c2 are finish terminals of three coils. It may be noted that a phase 
difference of 120° electrical is maintained between the corresponding start terminals a1, b1 and c1. 
Let the three coils mounted on the same axis be rotated (or the magnetic field system be rotated 
keeping coils stationary) is ant i-clockwise direction at Z radians/second, as shown in Fig. 6.30(a) 
and (b) respectively. Three emfs are induced in the three coils respectively. Their magnitude and 
direction, at this instant are given below:
(i) The emf induced in coil a1 a2 is zero and is increasing in the positive direction as shown by 
wave a1 a2 in Fig. 6.30(c).
(ii) The coil b1 b2 is 120° (electrical) behind the coil a1 a2 The emf induced in this coil is negative 
and is becoming maximum negative as shown by the wave b1 b2 in Fig. 6.30(c).
(iii) The coil c1c2 is 120° (electrical) behind b1 b2 or 240° (electrical) behind a1 a2 The emf induced 
in this coil is positive and is decreasing as shown by wave c1 c2 in Fig. 6.30(c).
Phasor diagram: The emfs induced in three coils are of the same magnitude and frequency but are 
displaced by 120° (electrical) from each other as shown in phasor diagram [see Fig. 6.30(d)]. These 
can be represented by the equations:

6.17 Wave Shape
The flux distribution in the air-gap of an alternator is not well distributed. moreover, if the winding 
is concentrated and full-pitched, the wave shape of the induced emf is not sinusoidal.
The wave shape can be made sinusoidal by proper designing of salient pole shoes and using short-
pitch and distributed winding.
6.18 Harmonics in Voltage Wave Form
The harmonics in the output voltage wave form are developed due to non-sinusoidal wave form of 
the field flux. These are also developed due to variation in the reluctance of the air-gap because of 
slotting of stator core.
Suppression of Harmonics
Harmonics can be suppressed or eliminated by various methods as mentioned below:
(i) By well distributing the armature winding.
(ii) By using short-pitched winding.
(iii) By skewing the poles by one slot-pitch.
(iv) By using fractional slot winding.
(v) By using slightly larger air-gap length to increase the reluctance.

6.19 Production of Revolving Field
(Physical/Graphical aspect)
A resultant magnetic field having constant magnitude and fixed polarity changes its position 
continuously in space is called a revolving field.
For simplicity, consider the stator of a two-pole synchronous machine or of an induction motor having 
three-phase winding represented by the concentric coils a-ac, b-bc and c-cc respectively as shown in 
Fig. 6.32 (a).
Let 3-phase currents having wave diagram as shown in Fig. 6.31(a) flows through the stator 
winding. Current of phase-1 flows through coil a-ac, current of phase-2 flows through coil b-bc and 
current of phase-3 flows through coil c-cc respectively. When three-phase currents flow through the 
three-phase winding, they produce their own magnetic fields I1, I2 and I3. The phasor diagram of 
the fields is shown in Fig. 6.31(b). The positive half cycle of the alternating current is considered as 
inward flow of current [cross in a circle ±] and negative half cycle as outward flow of current [dot 
in a circle ±]. It is marked in the start terminals (a, b and c) of the three coils. The direction of flow 
of current is opposite in the finish terminals of the same coil.

The three fields are given by the equation;
I1 = Im sin T [where T = Zt]
I2 = Im sin [T – 120°]
I3 = Im sin [T – 240°]
At an instant t1 when T = 0, the flow of current in the start terminals of the three coils, a, b and 
c is zero, negative and positive (i.e., zero, outward and inward) respectively whereas, in the finish 
terminals it is opposite to that of the start terminals as shown in Fig. 6.32(a). The resultant field 
produced by the stator winding and its direction Fm is shown in Fig. 6.32(a).

At another instant t2, where T = 90°, the direction of flow of current in coil-side a is inward and 
in b and c is outward. Whereas, the flow of current in the other sides of the coils is opposite, i.e., 
in ac it is outward and in bc and cc it is inward as shown in Fig. 6.33(a). The resultant field and its 
direction Fm at this instant is shown in Fig. 6.33(a). The resultant field is rotated in anti-clockwise 
direction (i.e., the direction in which the supply sequence is applied to the winding, here the supply 1, 
2, 3 is given to the coils a, b and c respectively) through an angle I = 90° from its previous position.
Fig. 6.33 Position of resultant field at instant ‘t2’ 
At this instant, angle T is 90°, therefore,
I1 = Im sin 90° = Im
I2 = Im sin (90° – 120°) = – 0·5 Im
I3 = Im sin (90° – 240°) = – 0·5 Im
The three fields, I1, I2 and I3 are shown vectorially in Fig. 6.33(b). Fields I2 and I3 are shown in 
opposite direction each having a magnitude of 0·5 Im. The resultant field IR is the vector sum of I1, 
I2 and I3. Resolving the fields along the axis of field I1.
IR = I1 + I2 cos 60° + I3 cos 60°

or 
IR = Im + 0·5 Im × 0·5 + 0·5 Im × 0·5

IR = 1·5 Im
At some other instant t3 where T = 270° the direction of flow of current in start terminals of the 
three coils a, b and c is outward, inward and inward respectively, whereas in the finish terminals it 
is opposite to that of the start terminals as shown in Fig. 6.34(a). The resultant field and its direction 
Fm at this instant is shown in Fig. 6.34(a). The resultant field is rotated in anti-clockwise direction 
through an angle T = 270° from its first position.
Fig. 6.34 Position of resultant field at instant ‘t3’
At this instant, angle T is 270°, therefore,
I1 = sin 270° = – Im
I2 = sin (270° – 120°) = 0·5 Im
I3 = Im sin (270 – 240°) = 0·5 Im
The three fields, I1, I2 and I3 are shown vectorially in Fig. 6.34(b). Field I1 is shown in opposite 
direction. The resultant field IR is the vector sum of I1, I2 and I3. Resolving the fields along the 
axis of field I1.
IR = I1 + I2 cos 60° + I3 cos 60°
or 
IR = Im + 0·5 Im × 0·5 + 0·5 Im × 0·5
or 
IR = 1·5 Im
Hence, in one cycle the resultant field rotates through one revolution. It may also be seen that when 
supply from three phases 1, 2 and 3 is given to coils a-ac, b-bc and c-cc respectively, an anticlockwise 
rotating field is produced. If supply to the coils a – ac, b – bc and c – cc is given from phase 1, 3 and 
2 respectively, the direction of rotation of the resultant field is reversed.
Thus, to reverse the direction of rotation of rotating magnetic field, the connections of any two 
supply terminals are interchanged.

Conclusion
Hence, it is concluded that when a three-phase supply is given to a three-phase wound stator of an 
induction motor or synchronous motor, resultant field Fm of magnitude 1·5 Im is produced which 
rotates in space at a constant speed called synchronous speed (Ns = 120 f /P). The direction of rotation 
of the resultant field depends upon the sequence in which supply in given to the stator winding.
6.20 Ferrari’s Principle (Vector Representation of Alternating Field)
An alternating field can be represented by two vectors revolving in opposite directions at constant 
speed of Z radians per second. It can be well explained with the help of Ferrari’s principle.
Ferrari’s principle states that a single alternating magnetic field is the resultant of two fields, 
each of half the magnitude of alternating field, rotating in opposite direction at fixed speed, called 
synchronous speed.
Consider a field Im having two components 1 and 2 each of magnitude Im/2, which are rotating 
in oppose direction at a constant angular speed of Z radians/sec.
Fig. 6.35 Two-vectors revolving in opposite direction and its wave diagram
Let at start, the two components are vertically upwards i.e., along the vertical axis and the resultant 
field is +Im. When Z = 90°, the resultant field is zero as shown in Fig. 6.35(ii), whereas when I = 
180° the resultant field is –Im and so on.
To determine the value of resultant field at any instant (say after t seconds), the two components 
make an angle I = Zt with the reference (vertical) axis
Then, the resultant field at that instant,
I = Im cos Zt
or 
IR = Im cos T
which is an alternating field.

540
Electrical Machines
Hence, an alternating field can be represented by two components of field having half the magnitude 
rotating in opposite direction at a constant speed, called synchronous speed.
According to Ferrari’s Principle, an alternating field produced by each phase (coil) can be 
represented by two components of field each having half the magnitude rotating in opposite direction 
at a constant speed, called synchronous speed.
Fig. 6.36 Position of the components of the fields at various instants
Considering a coil a-ac having an axis OA. When an alternating supply is given to the coil, an 
alternating field (I) is produced by the coil as shown in Fig. 6.36(a). At an instant t1, the two components 
of the field 1 and 2 each of magnitude Im/2 rotating in opposite direction are represented along the 
axis of the coil as shown in Fig. 6.36(b). At an instant t2, the two components of the field are rotated 
through 90° and their position is shown in Fig. 6.36(c). Similarly at an instant t3 the position of the 
two components is shown in Fig. 6.36(d).
6.21 Production of Two-phase Rotating Magnetic Field
Considering two coils a-ac and b-bc having axis OA and OB respectively displaced from each other 
by 90° as shown in Fig. 6.37(b). When two-phase AC supply is given to these coils, each one of them 
produces alternating field (flux) as shown in Fig. 6.37(a). Considering an instant t1, flux produced 
by coil a-ac is + Im, therefore the component 1 and 2 each of value Im/2 are along the axis of coil 
a-ac i.e., OA, as shown in Fig. 6.37(b).
The flux produced by the coil b-bc is zero at this instant and will become + Im after a rotation 
of 90°. Accordingly the position of component 3 and 4 each equal to Im/2 is shown in Fig. 6.37(b).
At this instant, the component 2 and 4 are equal and opposite and rotating in opposite direction, 
thus neutralising each other. The resultant component is the sum of 1 and 3 equal Im rotating in 
anticlockwise direction i.e., the direction of the supply sequence.
Thus, it is concluded that when 2-phase supply is applied (or current flows) to a 2-phase wound 
stator, resultant field of magnitude Im is set-up which rotates in space at a synchronous speed in the 
direction of supply sequence.

6.22 Production of Three-phase Rotating Magnetic Field
Considering three coils a – ac, b – bc and c – cc having axis OA, OB and OC respectively as shown in 
Fig. 6.38(b). When three phase supply is given to these three coils, each of them produces alternating 
field (flux) as shown in Fig. 6.38(a). Considering an instant t1, flux produced by coil a – ac is + Im, 
therefore the components 1 and 2 each of value Im/2 are long the axis of coil a – ac i.e., OA.
Fig. 6.38 Resultant magnetic field
The flux produced by coil b – bc will become positive maximum (+Im) after an angular rotation 
of 120 electrical degrees. Therefore, one of the component (3) of the field produced by this coil, 
rotating in anticlockwise direction, at this instant is along the axis of a – ac i.e., OA. Whereas, the 
other component (4), rotating in clockwise direction is along the axis of coil c – cc i.e., OC.
The flux produced by the coil c – cc will become positive maximum (+Im) after an angular rotation 
of 240 electrical degrees. Therefore, one of the component (5), rotating in anticlockwise direction, 
at this instant is along the axis of coil a – ac i.e., OA. Whereas, the other component (6), rotating in 
clockwise direction is along the axis of coil b – bc i.e., OB.
The resultant of the three components 2, 4 and 6, which are rotating in clockwise direction and 
displaced by an angle of 120 electrical degrees is zero. The resultant of the remaining three components 

542
Electrical Machines
1, 3 and 5 is 1·5 Im which is rotating in anticlockwise direction. It is the direction in which the supply 
is given to the three phases (coils) of the machine.
Conclusion
Hence, it is concluded that when a three-phase supply is given to the stator of a three-phase wound 
machine, a resultant field of magnitude 1 · 5 Im is produced which rotates in space at a constant speed, 
called synchronous speed. The direction of rotating of the resultant field depends upon the sequence 
in which supply is given to the three phases (or coils).
6.23 Rating of Alternators
The rating of all the power apparatus whether mechanical (steam or IC engines) or electrical (electrical 
machines) depends upon the power which they can handle safely and efficiently under some specific 
conditions.
Electrical machines or apparatus are usually rated as per the load they can carry without overheating 
and damaging the insulation. The rating of electrical machines is governed by the temperature rise 
caused by the internal losses of the machine. The copper loss (I2R), in the armature depends upon 
the magnitude of current passing through the armature conductors and core loss depends upon the 
operating voltage. Both these losses are independent of the power factor.
The power in kW is proportional to the power factor of the load which may be different for different 
loads. For instant, let the rating of an alternator be 1000 kVA, at full-load it will be in position to 
deliver 400, 600, 800 and 1000 kW at power factor 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 respectively. At these loads, 
current supplied by the alternator will be the same and the losses will also remain the same.
The above explanation clearly shows that the rating of an alternator depends upon, the maximum 
current it can deliver without overheating and the voltage for which it is designed. The pf of the load 
is not considered to give its rating.
Hence, alternators are rated in kVA and not in kW.
The electrical machines and apparatus which themselves work as a load like induction motors, 
ovens, heaters, refrigerators, air-conditioners, etc., are rated in kW. But the machines which are 
supplying or transferring electric power like alternators, transformers etc., are rated in kVA.
6.24 Armature Resistance

upon resistivity of winding material, length and area of cross-section

is called DC
resistance of the winding. The actual or AC resistance in nearly 1·25 to 1·75 times the DC resistance. 
This is because of unequal distribution of alternating current (Skin effect) over the cross-section of 
the conductor. Voltage drop (IR) occurs in the winding because of this resistance which is in-phase 
with the current phasor. However, the value of this resistance is very small as compared to synchronous 

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
543
reactance of the machine, which is why, many times, its voltage drop effect is neglected. Heavy 
copper losses occur in the machine because of armature resistance.
6.25 Armature Leakage Reactance
When current flows through the armature conductors, local fluxes are set at various places. The flux 
which links with the armature winding but not with rotor field winding is called leakage flux. The 
leakage flux may be divided into the following three components:
(i) Slot leakage flux: The flux which links or surrounds the armature conductors embedded in 
the iron or placed in the slots but does not passes through the air gap is called the slots leakage 
flux as shown in Fig. 6.39.
(ii) Air gap leakage flux: The flux which surrounds the armature conductors and passes through 
the air gap (i.e., the flux which crosses from tooth to tooth in the air gap) as shown in Fig. 6.39 
is called air gap leakage flux.
(iii) End-connection leakage flux: The flux which links with only the end-connections of the 
armature winding is called end-connection leakage flux. It is also called as an over hang leakage 
flux.
Fig. 6.39 Leakage Fluxes
The total leakage flux which links with the armature winding (conductors) gives rise to inductance. 
The magnitude of the inductance is given as
L = fN
I
henry
where I is the leakage flux in weber, N is the number of turns and I is the armature current. This 
inductance L, when multiplied by Z gives the leakage reactance XL. Hence,
XL = ZL = 2S f L ohm

6.26 Armature Reaction
At no-load, the only field (mmf) acting in the synchronous machine (alternator) is the main field ‘Fm’ 
produced by the exciting winding. When load is connected to the alternator, current flows through 
the armature conductors and produces a field (mmf) called armature field Fa. This field affects the 
main magnetic field Fm.
Thus, the effect of the armature field on the main magnetic field is known as armature reaction.
The current flowing through the armature conductors depends upon the power factor of the load. 
Therefore, the armature reaction will be studied at three extreme conditions of the p.f., i.e., unity, 
zero lagging and zero leading.
At Unity Power Factor
Consider a two pole alternator with the poles rotating in anticlockwise direction. The three phases 
are represented by concentric coils a-ac, b-bc and c-cc which are displaced by 120° electrical from 
each other. Where a, b and c are the start terminals and ac, bc and cc are the finish terminals.
At an instant t1, depending upon the position of the poles, direction of induced emfs in three coils 
is shown in Fig. 6.40(a) and their wave diagrams are shown in Fig. 6.40(c) (i.e., vaac, vbbc and vccc). 
Fig. 6.40 Armature reaction at unity of power factor
The position of the main magnetic field Fm produced by the exciting field coils is shown in Fig. 
6.40(a) as well as Fig. 6.40 (b). When a load of unity power factor is connected to the alternator, 
current flows through the coils which is in phase with the induced emf as shown in Fig. 6.40(b) 
and their wave diagrams are shown in Fig. 6.40 (c) (i.e., iaac, ibbc and iccc). A resultant armature field 
Fa is produced by the current carrying armature conductors of magnitude 1·5 Im (where Im is the 
maximum value of flux produced by the current flowing through each phase) in the direction as 
shown in Fig. 6.40(b). The two fields mmfs. are shown vectorially in Fig. 6.40(d). The armature field 
Fa is perpendicular of the main magnetic field Fm and produces cross-magnetising effect. It is also 
clear from the position of the two fields that armature field Fa lags behind the main magnetic field 
Fm by 90° causing the same effect as it is being caused by a pure inductance.
Thus, for a non-inductive load (at unit p.f.) the effect of armature reaction is cross-magnetising
i.e., it distorts the main field.

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
545
At Zero Power Factor Lagging
At an instant, t2, depending upon the position of the poles, direction of induced emfs in three coils is 
shown in Fig. 6.41(a). For simplicity, the wave diagram of induced emf in coil a – ac is only shown in 
Fig. 6.41(c). At this instant, induced emf in coil-side ‘a’ is zero and becoming negative. The position of 
main magnetic field Fmproduced by the exciting field coils is shown in Fig. 6.41(a) as well as Fig. 6.41(b).
Fig. 6.41 Armature reaction at zero lagging power factor
When a pure inductive load at zero p.f. lagging is connected to the alternator, currents will flow 
through the coils, which lag behind their respective induced emfs by 90° electrical. The wave diagram 
for the phase representing coil aac is shown in Fig. 6.41(c).
Accordingly, the direction of flow of current in various coil is shown in Fig. 6.41(b). A resultant 
armature field Fa of magnitude 1·5 Im is produced by the current carrying armature conductors in 
the direction as shown in Fig. 6.41(b). The two fields (mmfs.) are shown vectorially in Fig. 6.41(d). 
The armature field Fa acts in opposite direction to that of main magnetic field Im and produces 
demagnetising effect. It is also clear from the position of the two fields that armature field Fa lags 
behind the main magnetic field Fm by 180° i.e., it lags by 90° because of a pure inductive load and 
90° because of armature reaction.
Thus, with a pure inductive load (at zero p.f. lagging) the effect of armature reaction is 
demagnetising i.e., it weakness the main field.
At Zero Power Factor Leading
At an instant t3, depending upon the position of the poles, direction of induced emfs in the three coils 
is shown in Fig. 6.42(a). Only wave diagram of induced emf in coil a – ac is shown in Fig. 6.42(c). At 
this instant, induced emf in coilside ‘a’ is zero and becoming positive. The position of main magnetic 
field Fm produced by the exciting field coils is shown in Fig. 6.42(a) as well as 6.42(b).
When a pure capacitive load at zero p.f. leading is connected to the alternator, currents will flow 
through the coils which leads their respective induced emfs by 90° electrical. The wave diagram for 
the phase representing coil a-ac is shown in Fig. 6.42(c).
Accordingly, the direction of flow of current in various coils is shown in Fig. 6.42(b). A resultant 
armature field Fa of magnitude 1·5 Im is produced as shown in Fig. 6.42(b). The two fields (mmfs.) 
are shown vectorially in Fig. 6.42(d). The armature field Fa acts in the same direction as that of the 
main magnetic field Fmand produces magnetising effect. It is also clear from the position of the two 

546
Electrical Machines
fields that the armature field Fa is in phase with the main magnetic field Fm. In fact, the armature 
field was to lead the main field by 90° due capacitive load but it falls back to its original position due 
to armature reaction. Hence, the armature field acts in phase with the main field.
Fig. 6.42 Armature reaction at zero leading power factor
Thus, with a pure capacitive load (at zero p.f. leading) the effect of armature reaction is 
magnetising i.e., it strengthens the main field.
Conclusion
The above explanation reveals that
1. The armature reaction flux (Ia = 1.5 Iarm) is constant in magnitude and rotates at synchronous 
speed.
2. When generator supplies a load at unity pf, the armature reaction is cross-magnetising.
3. When generator supplies a load at zero pf lagging, the armature reaction in demagnetising.
4. When generator supplies a load at zero pf leading, the armature reaction is magnetising.
5. In all the cases, if the armature-reaction flux is assumed to act independently of the main field 
flux, it induces voltage in each phase which lags the respective phase current by 90°. Hence 
armature reaction causes an armature reactance drop.
6.27 Effect of Armature Reaction on emf of Alternator
To see the effect of armature reaction on the emf induced in the alternator.
Let, E0 = emf induced per phase by the main field (flux) at no-load.
Ea = emf induced per phase by the armature field (flux).
E = Net emf induced per phase i.e., resultant of E0 and Ea.
?
E = E
Ea
0 +
When the armature is at no-load, no current flows through the armature. Thus the armature field 
is zero. The main field Fm (or Im) will induce an emf E0 which lags behind Im by 90° as shown in 
6.43. Therefore, net induced emf E = E0.

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
547
When a non inductive load is connected to the alternator, current (I) flows through the armature 
conductors which is in phase with E0 and produces an armature field Fa or Ia which lags behind the 
main field by 90°. An emf Ea is induced by this field which lags behind the armature field by 90° as 
shown in Fig. 6.44. Thus a resultant emf E is obtained across the armature. E

When a pure inductive load is connected to the alternator, a current (I) flows through the armature 
conductors which lags behind E0 by 90°. This current produces armature field Ia which further 
induces an emf Ea in the armature lagging behind Ia by 90° as shown in Fig. 6.45. Thus a resultant 
emf (E = E0 – Ea) is obtained across the armature.
When a pure capacitive load is connected to the alternator, a current (I) flows through the armature 
conductors which leads the emf E0 by 90°. This current produces armature field Ia which further 
induces emf Ea in the armature lagging behind Ia by 90° but in phase with E0 as shown in Fig. 6.46. 
Thus, a resultant emf (E = E0 + Ea) is obtained across the armature.

Conclusion
From the above discussion, it is concluded that E0 is always in phase quadrature with the load current 
I and proportional to it. It, therefore, resembles with the emf induced in an inductive reactance so that 
the effect of armature reaction is exactly as if the stator winding has a reactance Xa = Ea/I. Whereas 
Xa is termed as armature reaction reactance.

Thus, an armature reaction produces a reactance effect in the armature winding called armature 
reaction reactance.

The phasor diagram for non-inductive, inductive and capacitive load are shown in Fig. 6.48(a), (b) 
and (c) respectively. While drawing phasor diagram, following steps are followed:
(i) Terminal voltage V is taken as the reference vector.
(ii) Load current I is drawn in phase with voltage vector V for non-inductive load. For inductive 
load, it is drawn so that it lags behind the voltage vector by an angle I. Whereas for capacitive 
load it leads the voltage vector by an angle I. Where I is the power factor angle.
(iii) Draw voltage drop vector IR parallel to current vector from point A.
(iv) Draw voltage drop vector IXS from point B perpendicular to vector AB since it is in quadrature 
to current vector.
(v) Join point O and C, where OC is the emf E0 which is induced due to the main field Im or the 
terminal voltage at no-load and is the vector sum of V, IR and IXS.

6.30 Expression for No-load Terminal Voltage
To deduce an expression for no-load terminal voltage, complete the phasor diagrams for various 
loads as shown in Fig. 6.49.
The no-load terminal voltage E0 is the actual induced emf in the armature produced by the main 
magnetic field Im. It is the vector sum of terminal voltage at load, drop in resistance and drop in 
synchronous reactance. From phasor diagram of alternator at different load conditions. we can deduce 
the expression for no-load terminal voltage.

6.31 Voltage Regulation
We have seen that because of the voltage drop in the armature resistance and synchronous reactance, 
the terminal voltage of synchronous generator depends upon the load and its p.f.
The rise in terminal voltage when the given load is thrown off, the excitation and speed remaining 
constant, is called the voltage regulation of a synchronous generator (alternator).
If E0 = no-load terminal voltage and V = terminal voltage at a given load.
Then voltage regulation = E
V
V

Percentage regulation, % Reg = E

The voltage regulation is positive both at unit and lagging p.f. because this causes rise in terminal 
voltage when the load is thrown off (removed). However, in case of leading p.f. the terminal voltage 
may fall when the load is thrown off. Therefore, at leading p.f. voltage regulation may be negative.

552
Electrical Machines
The voltage regulation may be zero, when load and its pf may be such that
*IR cos I = IXssin I
The voltage regulation of a synchronous generator is usually much high than that of power 
transformer because of large amount of voltage drop in synchronous reactance.
6.32 Determination of Voltage Regulation
To determine the voltage regulation of smooth cylindrical rotor type alternators, the following 
methods may be used:
1. Direct load test 
2. Indirect Method
1. Direct load test: Direct load test is performed only on small alternators (say 5 kVA). In this 
case, the alternator is run at synchronous speed with the help of a prime-moves and its terminal 
voltage is adjusted to its rated value V and the load is varied until the ammeter and wattmeter 
indicate the rated values at given power factor.
Then the load is removed keeping the speed and field excitation constant. At open circuit i.e.,
at no-load, the terminal voltage E0 is recorded. Then voltage regulation is determined as under:
Percentage voltage regulation = E
V

2. Indirect method: For large size alternator, indirect methods are used to determine voltage 
regulation. These methods are:
(i) Synchronous impedance method or EMF method
(ii) Ampere-turn method or MMF method
(iii) Zero power factor method or Potier method.
6.33 Synchronous Impedance Method or emf Method
This method is based on the concept of replacing the effect of armature reaction by a fictitious 
reactance.

?
IR cos I – IXs sin I = 0
or 
IR cos I = IXs sin I

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
553
To determine synchronous impedance, open-circuit and short circuit tests are performed and to 
determine synchronous reactance, armature resistance is measured by ammeter-voltmeter method.
By using these parameters, the regulation of the alternator can be determined at any load.
6.33.1 Determination of Synchronous Impedance
To determine the value of synchronous impedance of an alternator experimentally, the following two 
tests are performed on the machine:
(i) Open circuit test 
(ii) Short circuit test.
(i) Open circuit test: To perform open circuit test, the terminals of the alternator are kept open and 
is rotated by the prime-mover at synchronous speed. A DC supply is given to the field winding 
through a rheostat. A voltmeter is connected across the terminals of the alternator to measure 
open circuit voltage E and an ammeter is connected in the field circuit to measure field current 
If as shown in Fig. 6.50. The field current If (excitation) is gradually varied (increased in steps) 
and the voltage across the terminals of the alternator E is recorded for every change in the field 
current. A graph is plotted taking If along abscissa and E along the ordinate called open circuit 
characteristics (O.C.C.). The O.C.C. curve so obtained is shown in Fig. 6.52. The curve rises 
steeply and then flattened due to saturation of the magnetic circuit.
Fig. 6.50 Circuit diagram for open circuit test on single and three phase alternators
Note: In case of three-phase star-connected alternator, to plot the curve phase value of the terminal 
voltage E = EL/
3  is to be considered.
(ii) Short circuit test: To perform short circuit test, the terminals of the alternator are short circuited 
by a thick strip or an ammeter as shown in Fig. 6.51. And its rotor is rotated by the prime-mover 
at synchronous speed. The field current If is gradually increased and the short circuit current 
Isc is recorded for every change in the field current with the help of ammeter connected across 
the alternator terminals. A graph is plotted taking If along abscissa and Isc along with ordinate 
called short circuit characteristics (S.C.C.). The S.C.C. curve so obtained is shown in Fig. 6.52 
which is almost a straight line.
It should be noted that both the O.C.C. and S.C.C. curves are drawn on a common field current 
If as shown in Fig. 6.52.

Determination of Synchronous Impedance
To determine synchronous impedance of the alternator, let OA be the extension (field current If). For 
this field current OA, open circuit voltage is AB (i.e., E) and for the same field current the short circuit 
current is AC (i.e., Isc). When the alternator is short circuited terminal voltage is zero. Therefore, at 
short circuit, whole of the induced voltage E is being utilised for circulating the short circuit current 
Isc through the synchronous impedance Zs.

The value of synchronous impedance is not constant. Its value is slightly high at low magnetic 
saturation. An approximate graph of Zs against field current. If is drawn by the dotted line as shown 
in Fig. 6.52.
Note: The value of synchronous impedance is usually determined at the field current which provides 
the rated emf of the machine
6.33.2 Determination of Synchronous Reactance
To determine the value of synchronous reactance, first of all armature resistance is calculated by 
voltmeter–ammeter method, circuit shown in Fig. 6.53. Since the value of armature resistance is very 
small, a low DC supply voltage is connected across the terminals of a one-phase alternator. The value 
of armature resistance R

an alternator is 1.25 to 1.75 times to that of DC resistance.

Also, all the vector diagrams are drawn considering the phase quantities whether the alternator 
is single-phase or three-phase. To determine the regulation, all the quantities must be phase value.

6.34 Modern Alternators
When the terminals of the alternator are short circuited due to any fault (short circuit fault) short 
circuit current Isc flows through the armature conductors. This current depends upon the induced 
emf E0 and the synchronous impedance Zs of the alternator i.e.,
Isc = E
Zs
0 .
This short circuit current may damage the armature winding of the alternator if ZS is very small. 
Therefore, to limit the short circuit current, the modern alternators are designed for higher synchronous 
impedance. The resistance cannot be increased because it would increase the losses in the machine. 
Thus modern alternator are designed for higher synchronous reactance (or leakage reactance) but 
smaller resistance.
The value of synchronous reactance is some times more than 20 times the armature resistance. 
Therefore, for all practical purposes the voltage drop due to armature resistance is neglected as 
compared to voltage drop due to synchronous reactance.
6.35 Short-Circuit Ratio (SCR)
The ratio of field current to produce rated voltage on open-circuit to the field current required to 
circulate rated current on short-circuit while the machine is driven at synchronous speed is called 
short-circuit ratio (SCR) of a synchronous machine.
From OCC and SCC shown in Fig. 6.54.

Thus, SCR is just reciprocal of per unit synchronous reactance XS of the machine. The value of 
synchronous reactance depends upon saturated conditions of the machine whereas, SCR is specific 
and defined at rated voltage.
Significance of SCR
Smaller is the value of SCR, larger is the value of synchronous reactance which limits the short circuit 
current to smaller value. But it causes difficulty during parallel operation of the machines owing to 
smaller value of synchronising power.
Larger value of SCR increases the stability of the machine and improves its voltage regulation.
Usually, the SCR of a high speed non-salient pole alternators lies between 0.5 and 0.75 whereas 
it lies between 1.0 and 1.5 for low speed salient pole type alternators.
Therefore, the salient pole type alternators are more stable than non-salient pole type alternators.

A three-phase, star connected, 20 MVA, 11 kV, 50 Hz alternator produces a short-circuit current 
equal to full-load current when a field current of 70 A passes through its field winding. The same 
field current produces an emf of 1820 V (line to line) on open circuit. If the alternator has a resistance 
between each pair of terminals as measured by DC is 0.16 ohm and the effective resistance is 1.5 
times the ohmic resistance, what will be its full-load regulation at (i) 0.707 pf lagging and (ii) 0.8 
pf leading.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What are the different modes of operation of a synchronous machine?
Ans. Operation of synchronous machines: A synchronous machine may operate independently or in parallel 
with other machines. Accordingly, their operation is called;
(i) First mode of operation: The mode of operation in which a synchronous machine works 
independently is called its first mode of operation. In this case, machine works only as a generator.
(ii) Second mode of operation: The mode of operation in which a synchronous machine works in parallel 
with other machines or connected to the infinite bus bars is called second mode of operation. In 
this case, a machine may work as a generator or motor.
Q.2. What is armature leakage reactance?
Ans. Due to leakage fluxes like slot leakage flux, air gap leakage flux, end-connection leakage flux etc., the 
armature winding has some inductance (L) in each phase which offers leakage reactance (XL = 2S f L) 
and is called armature leakage reactance.
Q.3. What do you mean by armature reaction reactance?
Ans. In fact, in synchronous generators the armature reaction produces the same effect as if a reactance is 
connected in series with the winding and hence is called armature reaction reactance.

Q.5. In short tell how to determine synchronous impedance of an alternator.
Ans. Determination of synchronous impedance: It is determined by performing open circuit and short circuit 
test on the alternators.
By performing open circuit test, a curve between field current (If) and open circuit voltage or induced 
emf (E-phase value) is drawn.
By performing short circuit test, a curve between field current (If) and short circuit current (Isc – phase 
value) is drawn.
Then, synchronous impedance, Zs = E
Isc
at the same If.
Q.6. Name different methods used to determine voltage regulation of an alternator.
Ans. Voltage regulation of an alternator can be determined by the following methods:
(i) Synchronous impedance method or emf method.
(ii) Ampere-turn method or mmf method
(iii) Zero power factor method or Potier method.
6.36 Assumptions Made in Synchronous Impedance Method 
The following assumptions are made in synchronous impedance method:
1. The synchronous impedance is considered to be constant.
In fact, it is constant only when OCC an SCC are straight line. But above the Knee-pointof OCC, 
when the saturation starts, the value of synchronous impedance starts decreasing. Hence, the 
synchronous impedance obtained under test conditions is usually larger than actual value. This 
is the major source of error of determining voltage regulation of an alternator by synchronous 
impedance method.
2. The flux under test conditions is considered to be the same as that under load conditions.
The same value of field current is not producing the same flux always. When the armature is 
short circuited, the armature current lags behind the generated voltage by almost 90°, hence 
armature reaction produces demagnetising effect. This reduces the degree of saturation further. 
The actual resultant flux is reduced which reduces the generated emf. These conditions are 
different from those when the machine is actually loaded. Hence, the synchronous impedance 
obtained under test condition is usually larger than actual value. This causes a source of error 
while determining voltage regulation of an alternator by this method.
3. The effect of armature reaction flux is usually replaced by a voltage drop proportional to the 
armature current.

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
567
This assumption also causes errors because the shift of armature flux varies with the power 
factor and the load current.
4. The magnetic reluctance to the armature flux is considered to be constant regardless of the 
power factor.
Although, this assumption is substantially true for non-salient pole type alternators because 
air-gap in these machines is uniform. But in case of salient pole type alternators, the position of 
armature flux relative to field poles varies with the power factor. This assumption also introduces 
considerable error.
Hence, it is found that the regulation determined by using synchronous impedance method is 
higher than the actual value.
6.37 Ampere-turn (or mmf) Method
The synchronous impedance method is based on the concept of replacing the effect of armature 
reaction by a fictitious reactance. Accordingly, some assumptions were made. But due to those 
assumptions, the voltage regulation obtained by that method was higher than the actual value.
In ampere-turn or mmf method, the effect of armature leakage reactance is to be replaced by an 
equivalent additional armature reaction mmf. This additional mmf is combined with the armature 
reaction mmf.
To determine the regulation of an alternator by mmf method, the following information is required.
(i) The resistance of the stator winding per phase.
(ii) Open-circuit characteristics at synchronous speed.
(iii) Short-circuit characteristics.
All these informations can be obtained by performing the same tests as preformed in emf method 
i.e., open circuit test, short circuit test and ammeter–voltmeter method for finding armature resistance.
The open circuit and short circuit characteristics are shown in Fig. 6.54, where field current If1; is 
determined to give rated voltage V on no-load, neglecting armature resistance drop, the field current 
If2 is determined to cause short-circuit current, equal to full load current, on short circuit.
On short circuit, the field excitation If2, balances the impedance drop in addition to armature 
reaction on full load. But, as we know that R is usually very small and XL is also small for low voltage 
on short circuit, so impedance drop can be neglected. Hence pf on short circuit is almost zero lagging 
and the field amp-turns are used entirely to overcome the armature reaction. Therefore, If2, gives 
demagnetising amp-turns at full load.
Now, let us consider that the alternator is supplying full load current at a pf of cos I. Draw a line 
OA representing If1 to give full load rated voltage, V [actually it is equal to V + I R cos I] as shown 
in Fig. 6.55. Then draw AB at an angle (90° ± I) representing If2 to give full load current on short 
circuit; + ve sign for lagging pf and -ve sign for leading pf. Now find field current Ifmeasuring OB, 
which will give open-circuit EMF E0, which can be determined from OCC.
Then percentage regulation can be determined from the relation,

This method of determining synchronous impedance is known as optimistic method since it 
gives values lower than actual values. It is because the excitation to overcome armature reaction is 
determined on unsaturated part of the magnetising curve.

The field ATs or simply field current that is obtained from OCC is used to overcome the effects of 
armature reaction and leakage reactance. The ATs 2376 are the field ATs for balancing the armature 
reaction. The field ATs to balance or overcome the leakage reactance can be read off from the OCC
graph corresponding to leakage reactance drop of 185 volt and it comes out to be 370 ampere turn.
?
Short circuit field ATs = 2376 + 370 = 2746 ATs.

So the SCC is drawn with two points, one the origin (0,0) and second point is (2746, 72), These 
two points are joined, hence we get a straight line.
To determine total ampere-turns, proceed as follows:
Draw the phasor diagram as shown in Fig. 6.57. where terminal phase voltage V is taken as reference 
vector and current lags behind this voltage by an angle 36.87° (I= cos–1 0.8 = 36.87°). Here, resistance 
drop is zero and drop in leakage reactance IXs is 185 V which leads the current vector by 90°.

From OCC graph, corresponding to 4000 volt, the field current is 62 ampere.
This excitation (If1) is called normal excitation which is drawn at right angles to E. This is 
represented by vector oa. 
From short-circuit characteristic, corresponding to full load current of 30 A, the exciting current 
is 42.85 A. This excitation (If2) is in phase opposition with the current I and represents the field 
excitation of armature reaction and leakage reactance drop. The vector (ab) is drawn in parallel to 
current vector in phase opposition to balance the effect of armature reaction.
Now, the resultant of these two vectors is given by ob whose magnitude (If) is calculated as follows.
ob2 = oa2 + ab2 – 2oa × ab × cos (90 + I + G)
= (62)2 + (42.85)2 – 2 × 62 × 42.85 × cos (90 + 36.87° + 3.5°)
= 3844 + 1800 + 2 × 62 × 42.85 × cos (49.63°)

6.38 Zero Power Factor or Potier Method
The regulation obtained by synchronous impedance (or emf) method and ampere-turn (or mmf) 
method is based on the total synchronous reactance i.e., (the sum of reactance due to armature 
leakage flux and due to armature reaction effect). This introduces error due to vectorial addition of 
magnetic fluxes. Whereas, the zero power factor method is based on the separation of reactances 
due to leakage flux and that due to armature reaction flux, therefore, it gives more accurate results.
For determining voltage regulation by this method, the following data is required:
(i) effective resistance of armature winding
(ii) open-circuit characteristic
(iii) field current to circulate full-load current in the stator and
(iv) zero-power factor full-load voltage characteristic—a curve plotted between terminal voltage 
and field current while the machine is being running on synchronous speed and delivering 
full-load current at zero power factor.
The first three requirements can be fulfilled by performing open circuit test, short circuit test and 
resistance measurement test, as discussed earlier. The curve of zero power factor characteristic can 
be obtained by taking various steps as explained below:
1. The machine is rotated at rated synchronous speed by a prime-mover.
2. A pure inductive load (variable load reactors or an under-excited synchronous motor) is connected 
across the armature terminals and the excitation or field current of the alternator is raised so 
as to cause flow of full-load armature current.
Usually, the alternator is loaded by an under-excited synchronous motor while plotting zero 
pf full-load curve.
3. The value of the reactance is then increased step by step in such a way that the excitation 
current is adjusted to a value that causes full-load rated armature current to flow. In the process, 
the armature terminal-voltages are varied from 125 % to 25 % of the rated voltage in steps, 
maintaining the speed and rated armature current constant throughout the test.
4. Note down the armature terminal voltages and excitation currents at each step.
5. Draw a curve between terminal voltage and excitation current, as shown in Fig. 6.66. It gives 
the zero power factor (lagging) characteristic.
Now, the zero power factor (lagging) characteristic can be used for obtaining the Potier reactance, 
it is sufficient to determine the point representing rated armature current and rated voltage. This is 
indicated by point B in Fig. 6.66.
From OCC and zero power factor curve, it reveals that there is a definite relationship between 
the zero power factor (lagging) characteristic and an open-circuit characteristic of an alternator. The 
zero power factor characteristic curve is of exactly the same shape, as that of OCC but it is shifted 
vertically downward by leakage reactance drop I XL and horizontally, by the armature reaction mmf.
Zero power factor full-load voltage-excitation characteristic can be drawn by knowing two points 
A and B. Point A is obtained from a short-circuit test with full-load armature current. Hence OA 
represents excitation (field current) required to overcome demagnetising effect of armature reaction 
and to balance leakage reactance drop at full load. Point B is obtained when full load current flows 
through the armature but wattmeter reads zero.

580
Electrical Machines
Fig. 6.66 OCC of the alternator with zero pf full-load curve
From point B, line BC is drawn equal and parallel to AO. Then a line is drawn through C parallel 
to initial straight part of OCC (parallel to extended OG), intersecting the OCC at D. BD is joined 
and a perpendicular DF is dropped on BC. The triangle BFD is imposed at various points of OCC 
to obtain corresponding points on the zero factor curve.
In triangle BDF the length BF represents armature reaction excitation and the length DF represents 
leakage reactance drop (I XL)*. This is known as Potier reactance voltage drop and the triangle is 
known as Potier triangle. The Potier reactance is given, as
XP = DF (voltage drop per phase)
Zero power current per phase
It is observed that in case of cylindrical rotor machines, Potier reactance is nearly equal to armature 
leakage reactance, but in case of salient pole machines, the magnetising circuit is more saturated and 
the armature leakage reactance is smaller than the Potier reactance.
Potier Regulation Diagram
To determine voltage regulation, Potier regulation diagram is drawn as follows:
(i) OV is drawn horizontally to represent terminal voltage, V on full load and OI is drawn to 
represent full load current at a given power factor. (say lagging).
(ii) Draw VE perpendicular to phasor OI and equal to reactance drop (IXL), neglecting resistance 
drop.

(v) Draw oa = If1 perpendicular to phasor OE to represent excitation required to induce emf OE on

(vi) Draw ab = If2 parallel to load current phasor OI to represent excitation equivalent to full-load 
armature reaction.
(vii) Join ob = If which gives total excitation required. If the load is thrown off, then terminal voltage 
will be equal to generated emf corresponding to field excitation ob = If.
Hence, emf E0 may be determined from OCC corresponding to field excitation ob = If. Where, 
the phasor E0 will lag behind phasor ob by 90°. Here, EE0 represents voltage drop due to armature 
reaction. Now regulation can be obtained from the relation.

ohm per phase. A field current of 30 A produces a full-load current on short circuit and a line to 
line emf of 1039 V on open circuit. Determine the power angle of the alternator when it delivers full 
load at 0.8 p.f. lagging. Also determine SCR of the alternator.

6.40 Two-Reactance Concept for Salient Pole Synchronous Machines
In case of a multi-polar cylindrical rotor machine, the airgap is uniform and therefore, its reactance 
remains the same, irrespective of the rotor position. The effect of armature reaction, fluxes and 
voltages induced can, therefore, be treated in a simple way with concept of a synchronous reactance 
and taking it as constant for all positions of field poles with respect to the armature. But in case of 

598
Electrical Machines
a salient pole synchronous machine, the air-gap is non-uniform due to which its reactance varies 
with the rotor position. Therefore, a salient pole machine possesses two axes of geometric symmetry
(i) field pole axis, called direct axis or d-axis and
(ii) axis passing through the centres of the inter-polar space, called the quadrature axis or q-axis, 
These axes are shown in Fig. 6.80. In case of a cylindrical rotor machines, there is only one 
axis of symmetry (pole axis or direct axis).

Fig. 6.80 Representation of d-axis and q-axis
Thus, for salient pole machines, the reluctance of the magnetic paths on which the induced emf 
depends, acts differently along the direct axis and quadrature axis. The reluctance of the direct axis 
magnetic circuit is due to yoke and teeth of the stator, air-gap, and pole shoe and core of the rotor. In 
quadrature axis, the reluctance is mainly due to large air-gap in the interpolar space.
Thus it is observed that because of non-uniformity of the reluctance of the magnetic paths, the 
mmf of the armature is divided into two components namely:
(i) a direct acting component and (ii) a quadrature (or cross) component.
We have seen that when armature current is in phase with the excitation voltage E the entire mmf 
of the armature acts at right angles to the axis of the salient poles and, therefore, all the armature 
mmf is in quadrature. But, if the armature current is in quadrature with the excitation voltage E, the 
entire mmf of the armature acts directly along the magnetic axis of the salient poles. Hence, all of 
the armature mmf is either added or subtracted from the mmf of the salient pole field. However when 
the phase difference between armature current and excitation voltage, is of some angle in between 0 
and 90°, the armature mmf will have both a direct acting and a quadrature component. The direct-
acting component is proportional to the sine of the phase angle between the armature current and 
excitation voltage, whereas the quadrature (or cross) component is proportional to the cosine of the 
phase angle between the armature current and the excitation voltage.
The two reactance concept is similar to the synchronous impedance concept where the effect of 
armature reaction is taken into account by means of equivalent armature reactance voltage. Since, 
there is difference in the reluctance of the magnetic paths upon which the two components of the 
armature mmf act, the value of the equivalent reactance for the direct component of armature mmf 

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
599
is greater than the value of the equivalent reactance for the quadrature component of the armature 
mmf. Thus the two-reactance concept for salient-pole machines replaces the effect of armature 
reaction by two fictitious voltages. These reactance voltages are respectively Id Xad and IqXaq, where 
Id and Iq are the components of the armature current along direct and quadrature axis respectively. 
Each of these components of armature current also, produce a leakage-reactance voltage caused by 
the armature leakage flux. However, the armature leakage reactance exists is assumed to have the 
same value XL for both components of the armature current, Therefore, synchronous reactance for 
each component of the armature mmf is as follows:
Synchronous reactance for direct axis,
Xd = Xad + XL
Synchronous reactance for quadrature axis,
Xq = Xaq + XL

Usually, for salient pole synchronous machines Xq = 0.6 to 0.7 times Xd whereas in cylindrical 
rotor machines Xq = Xd 
6.40.1 Determination of Xd and Xq by Low Voltage Slip Test
To determine the value of Xd and Xq. a low voltage slip test is performed on the machine, as described 
below:
Step-I: The circuit is arranged as shown in Fig. 6.81.
Fig. 6.81 Circuit for low-voltage test
Step-II: A three-phase balanced reduced voltage (say V volt) is applied to the stator winding of the 
unexcited machine operating at a speed little less than its synchronous speed (slip being less than 1%). 
Step-III: Using oscillographs, measure and draw the wave shapes of the voltage applied across 
armature winding, current flowing through it and the voltage induced in the field winding (see Fig. 
6.82)
Theory: When low voltage V is applied to the stator winding, a current I flows through it which 
produces stator mmf. This stator mmf moves slowly relative to the poles and induces an emf in the 
circuit at slip frequency.

600
Electrical Machines
When the axis of the poles and axis of the armature reaction mmf wave coincide, the armature 
mmfacts through the field magnetic circuit. The voltage applied to the armature is then equal to drop 
caused by the direct component of armature reaction reactance and leakage reactance.
Fig. 6.82 
Wave diagrams for applied voltage and armature current
When the armature reaction mmf is in quadrature with the field poles, the applied voltage is equal 
to the leakage reactance drop plus the equivalent voltage drop of the corresponding field component.
Accordingly, the value Xdand Xq is determined from the oscillograph record as mentioned below :
Xd = Maximum voltage
Minimum current and Xq = Minimum voltage
Maximum current
6.41 Construction of Phasor Diagram for Two-Reaction Concept
To construct the phasor diagram for two reaction concept, the values of Xd and Xq must be known. 
The following steps are used in sequence to draw a phasor diagram:
(i) Taking voltage phasor as a reference vector, the current phasor OI is drawn lagging behind the 
voltage vector by an angle I depending upon the load conditions as shown in Fig. 6.83.
Fig. 6.83 Phasor diagram of a salient pole alternator

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
601
(ii) From the extreme point of the voltage phasor a line parallel to current phasor OI and equal to 
IR is drawn.
(iii) From the extreme point of the phasor IR a line perpendicular to current phasor OI and equal to 
IXq is drawn
(iv) Draw a line from the origin O passing through the extreme point of IXq phasor. This line gives 
the direction of excitation voltage E0.
(v) Knowing the direction of E0 the currents ld and Iq are drawn and their values are determined.
(vi) From extreme point of vector IR, draw a vector IdXd perpendicular to Id and IqXq from the 
extreme point of vector IdXd, as shown in Fig. 6.83, perpendicular to Iq.
(vii) By adding vectorially IdXd and Iq Xq to extremity of phasor IR, the magnitude of excitation 
voltage E0 is determined.
The angle T between E0 and I is called the internal power factor angle whereas, the angle G
between E0 and V is called the load or power angle.
The phasor diagram is redrawn in Fig. 6.84 taking E0 in horizontal direction.

From the above expression, it is very clear that power developed consists of two terms, the first 
term representing power due to excitation and the second term represents the reluctance power i.e.,

second term becomes zero and the power is given by the first term only.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What is the use of slip test performed on an alternator?
Ans. It is performed to determine the value of synchronous reactance for direct axis Xd and synchronous 
reactance for quadrature axis Xq.
Q.2. Why two reaction theory is applied only to salient pole synchronous machines?
Ans. In case of salient pole machines, the air-gap is not uniform and its reactance varies with the rotor 
position. Because of this non-uniformity of the reactance of the magnetic paths, the mmf of the armature 
is divided into two components called direct-acting component along the field pole axis i.e direct-axis 
and quadrature-component along the axis passing through the centre of the two consecutive salient 
poles i.e., quadrature axis.
Q.3. What are the factors on which the power angle d depends?
Ans. The power angle d depends upon the following factors:
(i) Supply voltage 
(ii) armature current
(iii) load power factor and 
(iv) quadrature component of synchronous reactance.
Q.4. How the value of SCR affect the stability limit? 
Ans. We know Xd =, smaller the value of SCR, larger is the value of Xd. Now maximum power output of a 
machine is inversely proportional to Xd.
Hence, larger the value of Xd lower will be the stability.
Thus, smaller the value of SCR lower will be the stability limit.
6.43 Transients in Alternators
A sudden change in the operating conditions of an alternator causes transients. Transients may occur 
due to 
(i) Switching 
(ii) Sudden change of load
(iii) Short –circuiting (either line-to line or line to neutral or short circuiting of all the terminals)
The short-circuiting of thermals may develop severe mechanical stresses on the armature winding 
which may damage the machine or its prime-mover.
Therefore, it is desirable to analyse the synchronous machines under such conditions to predict 
the possible conditions that may occur due to these abnormal operations.
The complete analysis of transient conditions that may occur due to short – circuiting is quite 
extensive and beyond the scope of this book. However, we shall limit our discussions regarding this 
phenomena to the extent that how to determine the short-circuit transient currents and the reactance 
that limit these currents.
The analysis of transients depends upon two fundamental facts i.e.,
(i) The current in an inductive circuit cannot change instantly and 
(ii) The theory of constant flux linkages which states that flux linkages cannot change with a closed 
circuit having zero resistance and no source.

612
Electrical Machines
Consider a three-phase alternator running at synchronous speed with its DC field excitation, 
without any load. When a short-circuit occurs at its terminals, the resulting currents in the three 
phases will develop as shown in Fig. 6.91. 
Fig. 6.91 Wave diagram of currents on the three-phases
The armature current in each phase has an AC as well as DC component. The AC component 
corresponds to the armature current required to oppose the time varying flux produced by the field 
winding as it rotates and the DC component corresponds to the initial flux linkages exist at the 
instant of short circuit. The net resultant of these currents produces the armature flux linkages. Each 
phase of armature keeps its initial flux linkages constant. The similar effects occur in the rotor field 
winding and these actions occur simultaneously. 
Most of the synchronous machines have damper winding which has resistance, self-inductance 
and mutual inductance with respect to armature and field windings. This winding also affects the 
short circuit currents. 
The transient conditions (currents) do not remain indefinitely. These tend to decay due to resistance 
of armature and field winding, as shown in Fig. 6.92.

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
613
Fig. 6.92 Symmetrical short-circuit stator current in synchronous machine
As the voltage at the three phases are 120° out of phase, the short circuit occur at different voltages 
at the three phases. Accordingly the AC component of currents, at the instant of short circuit, is 
different in each phase. As a result the DC component of armature current is also different in each 
phase. The total initial current in about 1.5 times AC component of current.
As shown in Fig. 6.92, the AC component of current can be divided into three distinct periods 
(i) Subtransient period: During one cycle or so, the AC current is very large and falls very rapidly. 
This period of time is called subtransient period and the rms value of AC current flowing during 
this period is called sub-transient current (Is). This current is developed due to the effect of 
both damper and field winding. It falls quickly with a time constant Tds
(ii) Transient period: After sub-transient period, the current continues to fall but at slow rate till it 
attains a steady value. This period of slow decay is called transient period and the rms value 
of AC current during this period is called transient current (Ic). it is caused in the field winding 
at the instant of short circuit. The time constant of transient period (Tdc) is much longer (nearly 
5 times) than the sub-transient time period. It is because the time constant of field winding 
circuit is much longer than damper winding circuit.
(iii) Steady state period: After transient period, the short circuit current reaches a steady state value 
ISC It persists as long the circuit is not opened by some protective device.
It is possible to observe the three periods of current if the rms value of AC component is plotted as 
a function of time on a semi-log scale, as shown in Fig. 6.93. Accordingly, it is possible to determine 
the time constants Tds and Tdc from such a plot. 
6.43.1 Sub-transient, Transient and Direct-Reactance
Sub-transient current Is is the rms value of the initial current which occur at the instant of short 
circuit (i.e., oa
2 ) the corresponding value of reactance is known as direct axis sub-transient
reactance (Xds).

614
Electrical Machines
The transient current envelope cuts the y-axis at point b (see Fig. 6.92). Ic is the rms value of 
transient current (i.e., ob
2 ) and the corresponding value of reactance is called direct axis transient 
reactance (Xdc).
Similarly, the rms value of the current represented by intercept oc (i.e., oc
2 ) is known as steady 
state short circuit current ISC and the corresponding reactance is called the direct axis reactance Xd.

6.44 Losses in a Synchronous Machine and Efficiency
A synchronous machine is used to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy or vice-versa. 
While doing so, the whole of input energy does not appear at the output but a part of it is lost in the 
form of heat in the surroundings. This wasted energy is called losses in the machine.
These losses affect the efficiency of the machine. A reduction in these losses leads to higher 
efficiency. Thus, the major objective in the design of a synchronous machine is to reduce these losses. 
The various losses occurring in a synchronous machine can be sub-divided as:
1. Copper losses.
2. Iron losses.
3. Mechanical losses
4. Stray losses
1. Copper losses: The various windings of the synchronous machine such as armature and field 
winding are made of copper and have some resistance. When current flows through them, there 
will be power loss proportional to the square of their respective currents. These power losses 
are called copper losses.
In general, the various copper losses in a synchronous machine are:
(i) Armature copper loss = I2R
(ii) Field winding copper loss = If
2Rf
(iii) Brush contact loss = I2Rb
The brush contact loss is generally included in field winding copper losses.
2. Iron losses: The losses which occur in the iron parts of the DC machine are called iron losses 
or core losses or magnetic losses. These losses consist of the following:
(i) Hysteresis loss: Whenever a magnetic material is subjected to reversal of magnetic flux, 
this loss occurs. It is due to retentivity (a property) of the magnetic material. It is expressed 
with reasonable accuracy by the following expression:
Ph = Kh V f Bm
1 6.
where, Kh = hysteresis constant in J/m3i.e., energy loss per unit volume of magnetic material 
during one magnetic reversal, its value depends upon nature of material;
V = volume of magnetic material in m3.
f = frequency of magnetic reversal in cycle/second and
Bm = maximum flux density in the magnetic material in tesla.
It occurs in the armature (stator core). To minimise this loss, the armature core is made 
of silicon steel which has low hysteresis constant.
(ii) Eddy current loss: When flux linking with the magnetic material changes (or flux is cut 
by the magnetic material) an emf is induced in it which circulates eddy currents through 
it. These eddy currents produce eddy current loss in the form of heat. It is expressed with 
reasonable accuracy by the expression:
Pe = KeVf 2t2B2
m
where, Ke = constant called co-efficient of eddy current, its value depends upon the nature 
of magnetic material;
t = thickness of lamination in m;
V, f and Bm are the same as above.

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
617
The major part of this loss occur in the armature core. To minimise this loss, the armature 
core is laminated into thin sheets (0·3 to 0·5 mm) since this loss is directly proportional 
to the square of thickness of the laminations.
3. Mechanical losses: As the field system of a synchronous machine is a rotating part, some power 
is required to overcome:
(i) Air friction of rotating field system (windage loss).
(ii) Friction at the bearing and friction between brushes and slip rings (friction loss).
These losses are known as mechanical losses. To reduce these losses proper lubrication is done 
at the bearings.
4. Stray losses. In addition to the iron losses, the core losses are also caused by distortion of the 
magnetic field under load conditions and losses in insulation of armature and field winding, these 
losses are called stray lasses. These losses are also included while determining the efficiency 
of synchronous machines.

The ratio of output power to the input power of a synchronous generator is called its efficiency.

6.46 Necessity of Cooling
In the synchronous machine, following are the main losses;
(i) Copper losses 
(ii) Iron losses 
(iii) Mechanical losses.
Because of these losses heat is produced which increases the temperature of the machine. This 
rise in temperature deteriorates the dielectric strength and ability to withstand mechanical stresses 
of the insulation. Thus it reduces the life of insulation on which life of machine depends. The rise 
in temperature further increases the losses and reduces the efficiency. Hence the rise in temperature 

618
Electrical Machines
is very harmful for the electrical machines. Therefore, various means are adopted to dissipate this 
heat into the atmosphere and to reduce the temperature of machine. At a stage when the rate of heat 
production becomes equal to the rate of heat dissipation, final temperature is achieved. Hence, to 
keep the temperature of the machine within the limits, efficient cooling method is necessary.
6.47 Methods of Cooling
Cooling methods of synchronous machine are broadly divided into;
(i) Open-circuit cooling 
(ii) Closed-circuit cooling
(i) Open-Circuit Cooling: In an open-circuit cooling system, a machine is cooled by the intake 
of cold air taken from atmosphere, which passes through the machine and is expelled into the 
atmosphere.
To prevent clogging of the machine with dust which air always contains, a filter may be mounted 
at the air intake, but it must be frequently cleaned. However, the filter increases the resistance 
to air flow, requiring addition fan power.
Fig. 6.95 Open circuit cooling
In this method, fans are mounted on the rotor shaft which induces a stream of air flow into the 
machine. The air enters the machine from one side and leaves at the other. Air flows axially 
and radially in the machine and cools it (see Fig. 6.95). In bigger machines separate fans are 
driven by the independent motor are employed to circulate more air and improve the cooling 
efficiency.
(ii) Closed-Circuit Cooling: The closed-circuit cooling 
system is one in which the same volume of air 
passes through a closed circuit. It passes through the 
alternator, becomes heated, then it passes through air 
cooler, where it is cooled down and again circulated 
through the alternator by a forced fan as shown in Fig. 
6.96. The air thus circulates in a closed system. The 
closed-circuit cooling system is widely used with large 
synchronous generators.
In closed-circuit cooling system not only air, but also 
other gases may be used for cooling of large synchronous 
generators. At present hydrogen at a pressure of 3–4 
atmosphere is mainly used.
Fig. 6.96 Closed circuit cooling

Synchronous Generators or Alternators 
619
Hydrogen cooling has a number of valuable advantages over air cooling as mentioned below;
1. The heat conductivity of hydrogen is 7 times greater than that of air and as a result the surface 
heat-transfer coefficient is 1·4 times greater than air. Hydrogen, therefore, cools a machine more 
effectively and a machine of higher output can be built with smaller dimensions.
2. Hydrogen is 14 times lighter than air. Hence, the windage losses, which in high speed machines 
make up the bulk of the total losses, decreases to about one-tenth of the losses when air is used. 
This results in the increase in efficiency of the machine.
3. With the use of hydrogen, when the corona phenomena occurs ozone gas is not liberated to 
cause intense oxidation of the insulation. Thus the service life of insulation is improved.
6.48 Preventive Maintenance
Preventive maintenance and routine inspection techniques conserve and prolong the life of electric 
machinery. Synchronous machines with general purpose ball or roller bearings require periodic 
lubrication while those equipped with self-lubricating “lifetime” bearings require no lubrication at 
all. It may be noted that in lubricating electric machinery (synchronous machines), excessive oiling is 
just as damaging as insufficient lubrication. Hence, periodic and appropriate lubrication is required.
In synchronous machines, the brushes and sliprings also require periodic maintenance in addition 
to lubrication. The sliprings must be checked and cleaned periodically for dust sticking on its surface.
Care must be taken that there should not be any type of oil leakage onto the stator. This may 
cause insulation breakdown of stator winding.
The body temperature and insulation temperature must be recorded frequently. Its value must 
fall within the prescribed limits.

Introduction
To meet with the ever increasing demand of electrical power, it is economical and advisable to run 
number of generating units in parallel. Although a single larger unit used to meet with the demand 
is more economical but it reduces the reliability. In fact, there are a number of good reasons to 
use number of smaller units operating in parallel to meet with the existing demand. In the present 
scenario, not only the number of units placed at one generating station are operated in parallel rather 
all the other units placed at the other generating stations which are interconnected are also operating 
in parallel with each other.
In this chapter, we shall study different aspect of parallel operation of alternators or synchronous 
generators.
7.1 Necessity of Parallel Operation of Alternators
To meet with the demand of electrical power, a variety of generating stations hawing large capacity 
have been erected. In the modern generating stations, where huge power is generated, several 
alternators are operated in parallel. 
CHAPTER
7

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
627
When number of alternators are connected to same bus-bars, they are called to be connected 
in parallel.
Such practice is considered necessary for the following reasons:
1. Physical size: The output power of modern power stations is so high that it is difficult to build 
a single unit of that capacity.
2. Reliability or continuity of service: Several small units are more reliable than a single large unit 
because if one unit fails, the continuity of supply can be maintained by operating the other units.
3. Repair and maintenance: Repair and maintenance of a unit is more convenient and economical 
if a large number of smaller units are installed at the power station.
4. Size and cost of stand-by unit: Since each unit is of smaller size, the cost of stand by unit is small.
5. Extension of power plant: The additional unit can be installed as and when the load demand 
increases.
6. Operating efficiency: Moreover, the load on the power station varies greatly both during day and 
night as well as during the different seasons. Thus the number of units operating at a particular 
time can be varied depending upon the load at that time. This keeps the machines loaded upto 
their rated capacity and hence results in increase in efficiency of operation as the efficiency of 
an electrical machine is maximum at or near rated capacity.
7.2 Requirements for Parallel Operation of Alternators 
The following are the requirements for the parallel operation of alternators:
1. Output voltage rating: The output voltage rating of all the alternators must be the same
2. Output frequency: The rated speed of all the machines should be such that they produce the 
same frequency (f = PN/120).
3. Output wave shape: The output wave form of all the alternators must be the same, although 
their kVA rating may be different.
4. Speed-load characteristics: The drooping speed-load characteristics of the prime-movers of 
the alternators should be the same so that alternators share the load in their proportion as per 
their output (kVA) rating.
5. Impedance triangles:The impedance triangles of the alternators should be identical for successful 
parallel operation.
7.3 Synchronising Alternators
The procedure of connecting an alternator in parallel with another or with common bus-bars to 
which a number of alternators are already connected, is called synchronising of alternators.
7.4 Conditions for Proper Synchronising
For proper synchronising of alternators, the following conditions must be fulfilled:
1. The terminal voltage of the incoming alternator must be equal to that of the bus-bar voltage.

628
Electrical Machines
2. The voltage of the incoming alternator should be in phase opposition to the bus-bar voltage. 
This implies that there will be no circuiting current between the windings of the alternators 
already connected to bus-bars and the incoming alternator.
3. The speed of the incoming alternator must be such that its frequency is equal to that of bus-bar 
frequency.
4. In case of three-phase alternators the phase of the incoming alternator must be identical with 
the phase of the bus-bars. In other words, the phase sequence of the incoming alternator must 
be same as that of the bus-bars.
Before studying the practical method of synchronising the alternators, we must be clear about the 
situation that will arise if the above conditions are not achieved. Considering only two single-phase 
alternators connected to the common bus-bars operating in parallel as shown in Fig. 7.1. A load is 
connected to the bus-bars. There are two circuits to which current can be supplied by the alternators. 
One circuit is the external load and the other is local internal circuit i.e., synchronous impedance 
of the two alternators.
Fig. 7.1 Two 1-phase alternators connected in parallel 
For the external circuit (i.e., load), the terminal voltage of the two alternators are equal and in 
phase with each other as shown in Fig. 7.2 (a) and the alternators share the load current as per their 
respective ratings.
Considering first and second condition, for correct synchronising, the terminal voltage of the 
incoming alternator must be equal and opposite (180° out of phase) to the voltage of the alternator 
already connected to the bus-bars with respect to the internal circuit as shown in Fig. 7.2 (b). Thus 
the resultant voltage is zero and no current circulates in the internal circuit. But if these conditions 
are not fulfilled i.e., the two voltages are not equal to each other in magnitude as shown in Fig. 7.2 
(c), a resultant voltage Er appears which will result in a circulating current Is in the local circuit. 
This circulating current lags behind the resultant voltage Er by 90° since the opposition of the local 

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
629
circuit is only synchronous reactance of the two alternators as resistance is neglected. Moreover, the 
circulating current will load the two alternators, without supplying any power to the external load.
Another condition can be when the voltage of second alternator is equal to the bus-bar voltage 
in magnitude but it is not out of phase by 180°, as shown in Fig. 7.2 (d). In this case also a resultant 
voltage Er acts to circulate current Is in the internal circuit of the alternators.
Fig. 7.2 Phasor representation of terminal voltages of two alternators
Considering third condition, for correct synchronising, the frequency of the incoming alternator 
must be the same as that of the frequency of the alternator already connected to the bus-bars i.e., 
the vectors representing the two voltages must rotate at the same speed. But if this condition is not 
fulfilled, one of the vectors rotates at speed higher or lesser than the other vector (say vector V2 is 
rotating at a speed higher than vector V1). The position of the two vectors at different three instants 
is shown in Fig. 7.3. Thus, the voltages of the two alternators will come in phase and go out of phase. 
This will happen at the rate equal to the difference of the frequencies of the two alternators. Because 
of this for local circuit, the resultant voltage Er varies from zero to double the voltage (V1 + V2) and 
circulates variable current in the local circuit.
7.5 Synchronising Single-phase Alternators
Synchronising of single-phase alternators is generally done by using lamps called lamp methods. 
There are two methods, namely, (i) Dark lamp method (ii) Bright lamp method.
7.5.1 Dark Lamp Method 
An alternator A is already connected to the bus-bars as shown in Fig. 7.4. Alternator B is of the 
synchronised to the bus-bars. This is done with the help of two lamps L1 and L2 connected across 
the main switch (synchronising switch) of alternator B as shown in Fig. 7.4.

630
Electrical Machines
Fig. 7.3 When frequency of the incoming alternator is more than the existing
Fig. 7.4 Synchronising of 1-phase alternators
The prime-mover of alternator B is started and its speed is brought up near to the rated speed. 
The field winding of the alternator is then excited by DC source. The excitation is then increased to 
raise the voltage of the alternator equal to that of the bus-bar voltage.

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
631
If the frequency of the incoming alternator B is not equal to the frequency of alternator A, 
already connected to the bus-bars (i.e., fb ≠ fa), a phase difference will exit between the voltages. 
This phase difference will be continuously changing, and therefore, the current flowing through 
the local circuit (shown dotted) and the synchronising lamps L1 and L2 will go on changing. As a 
result the lamps will become alternately bright and dark which produces flickering of lamps. The 
frequency of flickering of lamps will be equal to the difference of frequencies (fb – fa or fa – fb) 
of the two alternators. The flickering of the lamps will be rapid when there is large difference in 
frequencies and slow when the frequencies are nearly equal. To reduce the flickering, the speed of 
incoming alternator is adjusted.. 
If the voltage of incoming alternator is not equal to or in phase opposition to the bus-bar voltage, 
a resultant voltage will appear across the two lamps L1 and L2. Thus, the lamps will not be totally 
dark. The voltage can also be checked by connecting voltmeters across the two alternators as shown 
in Fig. 7.4. The voltage of the incoming alternator is made equal to the bus-bar voltage by adjusting 
its excitation.
Hence, to synchronise the alternator to the bus-bars, its speed is adjusted until the lamps flickering 
reduces to almost zero and, its terminal voltage is made equal to the bus-bar voltage by adjusting 
the excitation. Then synchronising switch is closed in the middle of the dark period.
Limitations
The lamps can be dark even though a considerable voltage may exist across their terminals; therefore, 
it is difficult to judge the correct instant of zero voltage in the dark lamp method. Keeping in view of 
this difficulty, some engineers prefer to synchronise the alternators by bright lamp method because 
of the fact that lamps are much more sensitive to change of voltages at their maximum brightness 
than when they are quite dark.
7.5.2 Bright Lamp Method 
In this method, the two lamps L1 and L2 are cross connected as shown in Fig. 7.4. When the voltage 
of the incoming alternator C is equal to the bus-bar voltage, the voltage across the two lamps will be 
double to that of alternator C. The synchronising switch is closed in this case when the two lamps 
are equally bright i.e., in the middle of the bright period.
7.6 Synchronising Three-phase Alternators
For synchronising of three-phase alternators, two methods are used i.e., (i) By using lamps, (ii) By 
using synchroscope.
Usually, low voltage alternators are synchronised by using three lamps. Depending upon the 
connections by which three lamps are connected across the terminals of the incoming alternator and 
bus-bars, the incoming alternator is switched-ON to the bus-bars at a particular instant. Accordingly, 
the lamp methods are named as (i) Three dark lamps method and (ii) Two bright and one dark lamp 
method.

632
Electrical Machines
7.6.1 Three Dark Lamps Method
An alternator A is already connected to the bus-bars as shown in Fig. 7.5. Alternator B is to be 
synchronised by three-dark lamps method. In this case lamp L1 and L2 and L3 are connected across 
R–Rc, Y–Yc and B–Bc terminals of the synchronising switch, respectively, where RYB are the bus-bar 
terminals and RcYcBc are the terminals of incoming alternator B.
The voltages of the bus-bars and the incoming alternator are shown vectorially in Fig. 7.6. If the 
voltages are equal, the frequencies are identical and the phase sequence is correct, the voltage across 
all the three lamps will be zero. Under this condition the lamps are completely dark. This is the ideal 
condition for closing the synchronising switch. 
When the frequency of the incoming alternator is different from that of bus-bar frequency and the 
remaining conditions are satisfied, then the three lamps will flicker in unison. At any instant, when 
the frequency of the incoming alternator is less than the bus-bar frequency, the voltage across the 
three lamps L1, L2, L3 is shown in Fig. 7.7. The frequency of flickering depends upon the difference 
between the frequency of alternator B and the bus-bar frequency (i.e., fb – fa). However, if the 
phase sequence is not correct the three lamps will flicker one after the other instead of flickering 
simultaneously. Then the phase sequence should be corrected by interchanging any two leads to 
the incoming alternator at the synchronising switch. The flickering of lamps can be minimised by 
adjusting the speed of the prime mover of the incoming alternator.
Fig. 7.5 Synchronising of three-phase alternators by using lamps
If the voltage of the incoming alternator is not equal to that of bus-bar voltage and the other 
conditions are fulfilled, all the lamps will flow with equal brightness and will continue to attain the 

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
633
same brightness. The ideal condition can be achieved by adjusting the excitation of the incoming 
alternator B.
The disadvantage of this method is that a lamp can be dark even though a considerable voltage 
may exist across its terminals and if the alternators are connected at this instant, this may cause 
considerable disturbance to high speed turbine-driven alternator. Therefore, in this case voltmeter is 
also connected across the synchronising switch as shown in Fig. 7.5. The other disadvantage of this 
method is that the flickering of lamps does not indicate whether the incoming alternator is slow or 
fast. These difficulties are eliminated in two bright and one dark lamp method.
Fig. 7.6 Phasor diagram when V2 = V1; f2 = f1 and phase sequence is incorrect
Fig. 7.7 Phasor diagram when V2 = V1 and phase sequence is correct but f2 < f1
7.6.2 Two Bright and One Dark Lamp Method
Consider alternator C to be synchronised by two bright and one dark lamp method. In this case 
lamp L1 is connected across R – R¢, lamp L2 is connected across Y – B¢ and lamp L3 across B – Y¢ 
as shown in Fig. 7.5.
The bus-bar voltages OR, OY and OB and the voltage of incoming alternator OR¢, OY¢ and OB¢ 
are shown vectorially in Fig. 7.8. If the voltages are equal, the frequencies are identical and the phase 
sequence is correct, the voltage across L1 will be zero and across L2 and L3 will be line value (VL) 
as shown in Fig. 7.8. Under this condition lamp L1 will be completely dark and the lamps L2 and L3
will be equally bright. This is the ideal condition for closing the synchronising switch.

634
Electrical Machines
When the frequencies of the incoming alternator are different from that of bus-bar frequency and 
the remaining conditions are fulfilled, then the three lamps will flicker alternately (i.e., one after 
the other in sequence). There can be two different conditions i.e., either the incoming alternator is 
running too fast or too slow.
If the incoming alternator C is running too fast, then the vector diagram R¢Y¢B¢ will rotate faster 
than RYB. Because of this voltage across lamp L1 is increasing, across L2 is decreasing and across L3
is increasing as shown in Fig. 7.9. representing two instants (a) and (b). The lamps will then become 
bright or flicker one after the other in the order L3, L1, L2, L3, L1, L2, etc. To distinguish the sequence 
of flickering of lamps, the lamps are generally placed on the vertices of an equilateral triangle as 
shown in Fig. 7.10.
Fig. 7.8 Phasor diagram when V2 = V1; f2 = f1
and phase sequence is correct
Fig. 7.9 Incoming alternator is running 
two fast (f2 > f1)
Fig. 7.10 Lamps placed on the vertices of an equilateral triangle
On the other hand, if the incoming alternator is too slow, then the vector diagram RcYcBc will rotate 
slower than RYB. Because of this, voltage across lamp L1 is increasing, across L2 is increasing and 
across L3 is decreasing as shown in Fig. 7.11. But in this case, lamps will become bright or flicker 
one after the other in the order L2, L1, L3, L2 L1, L3, etc., as shown in Fig. 7.12.
Thus in case of two bright and one dark lamp method, the sequence of flickering of the lamps will 
indicate whether the incoming alternator is too fast or too slow, accordingly the speed is adjusted 
to minimise the flickering of the lamps.
However, if the phase sequence is not correct all the three lamps will flicker in unison. Then the 
phase sequence should be corrected by interchanging any two leads of the incoming alternator at 
the synchronising switch.

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
635
Fig. 7.11 Incoming alternator is running two slow
Fig. 7.12 Lamps placed on the 
vertices of an equilateral triangle
If the voltage of the incoming alternator is not equal to that of bus voltage and the other conditions 
are satisfied, all the lamps will flow with different brightness and will continue to attain the same 
brightness. The ideal condition can be achieved by adjusting the excitation of the incoming alternator.
Thus when the flickering frequency is minimised to zero, lamp L1 is totally dark and L2 and 
L3 are equally bright the synchronising switch should be closed.
The lamp methods are only suitable for small low voltage alternators. For large capacity, high 
voltage alternators, a sychroscope is almost invariably used for synchronising.
7.7 Synchronising Three-phase Alternators using Synchroscope
High voltage alternators are generally synchronised with the help of synchroscope.
A synchroscope is an instrument which has been devised, with a rotating pointer and a fixed index. 
The pointer indicates whether the incoming machine is slow or fast. In fact, it shows the precise instant 
of synchronisation when the paralleling switch should be closed. Synchroscopes are manufactured 
in a variety of designs such as polarised-vane type, moving iron type and crossed-coil type.
In simplest form, a synchroscope utilises a split phase arrangement to give a rotating field which 
is excited by the incoming alternator.
When the two machines differ in frequencies, the reaction of the two fields produces rotation. 
A pointer connected to the rotor moves over the dial face and indicates the phase positions of the 
alternators. In this method of parallel operation two additional bus-bars, known as synchronising 
bus-bars are necessary by means of which synchroscope is connected through potential transformers 
(P.T.) to the two alternator to be synchronised and to the main bus-bar as shown in Fig. 7.13. The 
secondary windings of the potential transformers are connected to the synchronising bus-bars.
The incoming alternator is arrowed to run at its rated speed and its voltage is adjusted equal to the 
main bus-bars voltage. The two plugs are inserted in the secondaries of the potential transformers 
so that the synchroscope is acted upon by the voltages of both the incoming alternator and the main 
bus-bars. The greater the difference in frequency between bus-bars and the incoming alternators. 

636
Electrical Machines
The greater will be the movement of the pointer. If the incoming alternator runs slower the pointer 
rotates in anti-clockwise direction and if the incoming alternator runs faster its pointer rotates in 
clockwise direction.
.
Fig. 7.13 Synchronising of three-phase alternators by using synchroscope 
The speed of the incoming alternator is now adjusted until the pointer assumes a vertical position 
and thus indicates that the two alternators can be put into synchronism. At this instant 3 pole paralleling 
switch P.S. is closed.
7.8 Shifting of Load
After fulfilling all the necessary conditions of synchronising, the synchronising switch is closed 
and the alternator is said to be connected in parallel with the other alternators already connected to 
the bus-bars, by closing the synchronising switch. The incoming alternator is connected in parallel 
with the existing alternator but at this instant, the incoming alternator is not delivering any load 
(current) to the bus-bars. The load is shifted from the existing alternator to the incoming alternator 
by increasing the mechanical power input to the prime-mover of the incoming alternator and 
simultaneously reducing the mechanical power input to the prime-mover of existing alternator. In 
case of steam machines this may be readily done by admitting more steam (by opening the steam 
inlet valve) to the steam-turbine of incoming alternator and simultaneously closing the steam valve 
of existing alternator. Thus, any load can be shifted to incoming alternator from existing alternator. 
Generally it is shifted as per their respective ratings.
If the existing alternator is to be disconnected from the bus-bars the process continues till whole 
of the load is shifted to the incoming alternator as indicated by the ammeter and wattmeters in the 
circuits. Then the line circuit breaker (main switch) and field breaker (field switch) of the existing 
alternator are opened.

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
637
The most important point, to be emphasised, is that load cannot be shifted from one machine to 
the other by adjusting the excitation. Once the alternator is connected to the bus-bars, the change in 
excitation only changes the power factor of the alternator it does not affect the load sharing.
7.9 Load Sharing between Two Alternators
Consider two alternators I and II with identical speed/load characteristics are connected in parallel 
with a common terminal voltage V and delivering power to a load, as shown in Fig. 7.14.
Fig. 7.14 Alternator I and II operating in parallel delivering load 
Let E1 and E 2 be the induced emf/phase of the two machines I and II, respectively, Z S1 and 
ZS2 be the impedance/phase of two machines I and II, respectively, whereas I1 and I2 be the current

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. Why are synchronous generators put in parallel? 
Ans. Synchronous generators are put in parallel for high efficiency of operation, better reliability, convenience 
in repair and maintenance, extension of power plant capacity, etc. 

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
647
Q.2. What conditions are required to be fulfilled for parallel operation of alternators? 
Ans.
Terminal voltage, frequency and the phase (or phase sequence) of the incoming alternator must be the 
same as that of the existing alternator or the bus-bars.
Q.3. For synchronising of three-phase alternators; which method is preferred, dark lamp method or 
one-dark and two-bright lamp method?
Ans. One-dark and two-bright lamp method is preferred.
Q.4. How load in shifted to the incoming alternator?
Ans. After synchronising the incoming alternator to the bus-bars of the existing alternator, the input power 
to the incoming alternator is increased whereas to the existing alternator is decreased gradually.
7.10 Two Alternators Operating in Parallel
When the two alternators are operating in parallel as shown in Fig. 7.15 under stable equilibrium, 
they share the total load in proportion to their ratings or equally if both are identical. Any tendency 
on the part of one to pull out of synchronism because of change in load or excitation is immediately 
counteracted by the production of a synchronising current (hence synchronising torque) which pulls 
it back to synchronism.
Let us study the effect of change in input power change in excitation or change in speed of the 
alternators.
Fig. 7.15 Two alternators operating in parallel
7.11 Synchronising Current, Power and Torque
When the two identical alternators are in exact synchronism, the emfs of two alternators E1 and E2
are equal and in exact phase opposition, as shown in Fig. 7.16 (a), as far as the local circuit of the 
alternators in concerned. No circulating current flows through the local circuit.
If the induced emfs. of the two alternators are equal but due to some reason the emf of the second 
alternator E2 fall back by an angle T (electrical radians) as shown in Fig. 7.16 (b), then a resultant emf 
Er acts in the local circuit and causes flow of current known as synchronising current.

7.12 Effect of Change in Input Power of One of the Alternators
When two identical alternators are operating in parallel, they supply equal current to the load at the 
same power factor. Both the alternators have same reactance and induced emfs.Under such conditions, 
all the quantities are shown vectorially in Fig. 7.17 for the local circuit of the two alternators.
Fig. 7.17 Phasor diagram with ideal conditions,
If input power (steam supply or water supply or fuel supply) to alternator ‘A’ is increased, it will 
increase the torque angle G1 to G1c (since input power is proportional to G neglecting losses). Thus the 
emf E1 of the alternator ‘A’ attains a new position as shown in Fig. 7.18 and a resultant emf Er appears 
across the local circuit which circulates synchronising current Is. This synchronising current lags 
behind the resultant emf Er by 90°. The current-delivered by alternator ‘A’ increases to ¢I1 and the 
current delivered by alternator ‘B” decreases to ¢I2 . The power factor of the two alternators also 
changes to cos ¢
f1 and cos ¢
f2 , respectively.
Fig. 7.18 Phasor diagram when input to one of the alternator is increased

650
Electrical Machines
Fig. 7.19 Power triangle representation
Thus, the increase in power input to prime-mover of alternator ‘A’, increases the kW output of 
alternator ‘A’ and decreases that of alternator ‘B’ by the same amount. If this process is continued, 
a point may reach where output power of alternator ‘A’ becomes more than the total load supplied, 
then the alternator ‘B’ instead of supplying load will start drawing power from alternator ‘A’. Hence, 
the alternator A will start working as a motor. The load sharing diagram of the two alternators is 
shown in Fig. 7.19 (b).
7.13 Effect of Change in Excitation of One of the Alternators
If the excitation of alternator ‘A’ is increased from E1 to E1c, a resultant voltage Er (i.e., E1c – E2) appears 
across the local circuit and circulates a synchronising current Is. This current lags behind the resultant 
voltage Er by 90° and acts almost in quadrature with the voltage vector. Therefore, it does not affect 
the active component of current delivered by the two alternators. The resultant currents delivered by 
the two alternators are I1c and I2c as shown in Fig. 7.20. The power factor of the two alternators also 
changes in cos I1c and cos I2c¹ respectively.
Thus, the increase in excitation of alternator ‘A’ does not affect the kW loading of the two alternators 
but it affects the power factor and reactive power of the two alternators. When the excitation of 
alternator 
Fig. 7.20 Phasor diagram when excitation of one of the alternator is increased.
‘A’ is increased, the reactive power (kVAR1) shared by this alternator will increase while the 
reactive power (kVAR2) shared by alternator ‘B’ will decreased by the same amount. The load sharing 
diagram of the two alternators is shown in Fig. 7.21.

7.14 Effect of Reactance
When two alternators are running in parallel, the emf of one alternator acts opposite to the emf of 
the other alternator with respect to their local circuit. As such one machine runs as a synchronous 
motor with respect to the other. Due to any reason, if the input supply to one of the machine is cut-
off, it is quite evident that it would draw a wattful current from the other machine to run as a motor.
(a) Machines having negligible resistance 
(b) Machines having negligible reactance 
with respect to reactance 
with respect to resistance 
Fig. 7.22 Pharos diagram for the internal circuit of two synchronous machine operating in parallel 
Considering that the two machines are having only resistance and negligible reactance. Their 
emfs E1 and E2 are practically in phase opposition, as shown in Fig. 7.22(a) and their resultant emf 
Er is in quadrature with E1 and E2. The synchronising current IS [ IS = Er /(R1 + R2)] will be in phase 
with Er but in quadrature with E1 and E2. Hence, no real power is transferred from one machine to 
the other since the synchronising current is the wattless current (needs help for synchronisation).
Now, considering that the two machines are having large reactance as compared to resistance. 
The synchronising current IS will lag behind the resultant voltage Er by 90° as shown in Fig. 7.22 
(b), this synchronising current IS will develop a real power E1 IS cos q which will be delivered by 
one machine to the other, Hence, one machine works as a generator and the other works as a motor. 
This causes the machine to restore synchronism. 
Conclusion
From the above discussions, it is concluded that machines must have high reactance for satisfactory 
parallel operation of synchronous generators.

7.15 Effect of Governors’ Characteristics on Load Sharing
The speed-load characteristics of the prime-movers of the alternators are drooping curves as shown 
in Fig. 7.23 the curve shows that the speed or frequency of an alternator decreases with the load.
Governors are usually employed with the generator prime-movers which act on the centrifugal 
principle. The moment, there in drop in speed caused by the increase in load, the valve mechanism 
operates and brings the speed back to its rated value. 
Fig. 7.23 Speed-load characteristics of synchronous generators
In Fig. 7.23 The speed-load characteristics of three alternator I, II and III each of same rating 
(say 5 MVA), are shown. The speed-load characteristics of alternator I and II are identical but that 
of alternator III are different.
Let us see how speed-load characteristics affect the load sharing when they are connected is 
parallel. Consider that alternator I and II are operating in parallel and both of them are supplying 
their rated full load of 4MW (say the pf of the load is 0.8 lagging). If the load on the system decreases 
( say from 8MW to 6MW), as shown in Fig. 7.23 (a) the frequency of both the alternators increases 
momentarily but equal load (3MW each) is shared by them.
Fig. 7.24 Load shared by two alternators running in parallel.

Parallel Operation of Alternators 
653
Now, consider that alternator I and III are operating in parallel and both of them are supplying 
their rated full load of 4MW (say the pf of the load is 0.8 lagging). If the load on the system decreases 
(say from 8 MW to 6MW), as shown in Fig. 7.24(b), the frequency of both the alternators increases 
momentarily but they are not sharing the load equally, alternator I is sharing less load than the 
alternator III as shown in Fig. 7.24 (b).
Hence, it is concluded that the speed-load characteristics play their role. Therefore, the governess 
placed on the alternators must be very sensitive so that they bring the alternators to operate at their 
rated frequency and share the load as per their rating.
7.16 Hunting
When a synchronous machine is loaded, the rotor poles slightly fall back in position with respect to 
the stator field (poles) by an angle G known as power angle or torque angle or retarding angle. As 
the load is gradually increased, this angle G also increases gradually so as to produce more torque 
for coping with the increased load. If the load is suddenly thrown off, angle G decreases suddenly 
and the rotor poles are pulled into almost exact opposition to the stator poles, but due to inertia of 
rotor and rotor poles travel too far. They are then pulled back again, and so on, thus oscillations are 
set up around the equilibrium position, corresponding to new load. 
The oscillation of the rotor about its equilibrium position is known as hunting.
Hunting effect produces heavy mechanical tresses in the machine parts particularly on the bearings. 
Therefore effort are made to prevent hunting
The hunting (oscillations) can be prevented by providing damper winding on the rotor pole faces 
in case of salient pole alternators. This damper winding consists of number of copper or aluminium 
bars embedded into the slots provided on the outer periphery of the pole shoes and then short circuited 
by end rings. When hunting takes place, there is relative motion of the rotor with respect to the stator 
field, which sets up eddy currents in this winding which flow in such a way that it suppresses the 
oscillations. Hunting can also be reduced by placing heavy flywheels on the shaft and putting dash-
pots on the engine governors.
However, non-salient pole of alternators used in steam-fed power plants do not have the tendency 
to hunt.
The hunting also occurs when the machine operates as a motor. In this case also because of 
sudden change in load oscillations are set up in the rotor called hunting; which can be prevented by 
providing damper winding on the rotor.

Example 7.14
The governors of the two 50 MVA, three-phase alternators operating in parallel. are set in such a 
way that the rise in speed from full-load to no-load is 2% in one machine and 3% in the other. The 
characteristics being straight lines in both cases. If each machine is fully loaded when the total 
load is 100 MW (unity pf), what will be the load on each machine when load is reduced to 75 MW.
Solution:
For parallel operation of two alternators having same number of poles, the speed of both should be 
the same. When each machine is fully loaded, the operating points are A and B (see Fig. 7.25). When 
the total load is reduced to 75 MW, let the speed rises to some value x% of the full load speed. Now 
the operating points of alternator I and II are shifted to F and E.

(Ans. 13.33 kW, 16.67 kW)
Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. The synchronous generators with larger air-gap have higher synchronising power, why? 
Ans. A large air-gap offers a large reluctance to the armature mmf and reduces the armature reaction. This 
reduces the value of synchronous reactance. Since synchronising power is inversely proportion to 
synchronous reactance, the smaller synchronous reactance will develop higher value of synchronising 
power.
Q.2. Will an increase in excitation of an alternator connected to infinite bus-bars increase its real power 
generation?
Ans. No, real power generation will not be affected, it will remain the same.
Q.3. What do you understand by synchronising power and what is its significance?
Ans. When the equilibrium of a synchronous generator connected to infinite bus-bars in disturbed due to any 
reason, a synchronising current flows through it which develops synchronising power. The tendency 
of the synchronising power is to bring the machine back in to synchronism.
Q.4. How can the load sharing between the alternators operating in parallel be changed?
Ans. The load sharing between the alternators operating in parallel can be changed by adjusting the input 
power to their prime-movers.
Q.5. Do the non-salient pole type of alternators employed at steam power plants have a tendency to 
hunt?
Ans. No, they don’t have the tendency to hunt.
Q.6. What are the causes of hunting in synchronous machines?
Ans. In synchronous machines, hunting occurs due to sudden change in load on the machine.

Introduction
The same synchronous machine can be used as a generator or as a motor. When it converts mechanical 
power or energy into electric power or energy, it is called a synchronous generator. On the other hand, 
when it converts electric power or energy into mechanical power or energy, it is called a synchronous 
motor.
For instance, if two alternators A and B are operating in parallel and the power input to one of 
the alternator say ‘A’ is increased, it starts delivering more power. Since the demand of the load is 
unaltered, the alternator ‘B’ will thus be relieved off load by an equal amount. If this process is 
continued till output power of alternator ‘A’ becomes more than the total load supplied, then the 
alternator ‘B’ instead of supplying power starts receiving power from the bus-bars. Thus, the machine 
starts working as a motor. However, when two alternators A and B (or any number of alternators) are 
operating in parallel and the driving force (power input) of any one of them is removed, it continues to 
run as a motor by receiving power from the other alternator (or bus bars). 
Thus, the machine starts working as a motor and is called synchronous motor.

Electrical Machines
Hence, a synchronous machine can be operated as a generator (called alternator or synchronous 
generator) or a motor (called synchronous motor).
Fig. 8.1 Synchronous motor with exciter
Note: The construction of synchronous motor is same as that of synchronous generator or 
alternator. In fact, the same machine can be operated as a generator or as a motor.
8.1 Working Principle of a Three-phase Synchronous Motor
When a 3-phase supply is given to the stator of a 3-phase wound synchronous motor, a revolving 
field is set up (say in anticlockwise) which rotates at a synchronous speed (NS = 120f
P
). This field 
is represented by the imaginary stator poles. At an instant as shown in Fig. 8.2(a), the opposite poles 
of stator and rotor are facing each other (for simplicity two-pole machine is considered). As there is 
a force of attraction between them, an anticlockwise torque is produced in the rotor as the rotor poles 
are dragged by the stator revolving poles or field.
After half a cycle, polarity of the stator poles is reversed whereas the rotor poles could not change 
their position due to inertia. Thus, like poles are facing each other and due to force of repulsion a 
clockwise torque is produced in the rotor as shown in Fig. 8.2 (b).
Hence, the torque produced in a 3-phase synchronous motor is not unidirectional and as such 
this motor is not self-starting.
However, if rotor of synchronous motor is rotated by some external means at the start so that it 
also reverses its polarity as the polarity of stator poles is reversed after half a cycle as shown in Fig. 

Synchronous Motors 
667
8.2(c). A continuous force of attraction between stator and rotor poles exists. This is called magnetic 
locking. Once the magnetic locking is obtained, the rotor poles are dragged by the stator revolving 
field (imaginary poles) and a continuous torque is obtained. As the rotor poles are dragged by the 
stator revolving field, hence the rotor rotates at the same speed as that of stator revolving field, i.e., 
synchronous speed.
Thus, a synchronous motor only runs at a constant speed called synchronous speed.
Fig. 8.2 Representing working principle with initial torque
8.2 Effect of Load on Synchronous Motor
When a synchronous motor is connected to the lines and started by some external means, it starts 
rotating at synchronous speed. If the motor is running at no-load and has no losses (ideal condition), 
then the induced emf E is equal and opposite to applied voltage V as shown in Fig. 8.3(a) and the 
stator and rotor poles are in line with each other as shown in Fig. 8.3(b). The resultant emf and hence 
the current drawn by the motor is zero. Thus, the motor is said to be floating on the lines.
Fig. 8.3 Synchronous motor on no-load (ideal condition)
However, in actual machine some losses are always present with the result induced emf E falls 
back by an angle G0 relative to the stator poles as shown in Fig. 8.3(b). This causes a resultant voltage 
Er across the armature circuit and motor draws no-load current I0 (I0 = Er /Zs) from the mains. This 
no-load current lags behind the resultant voltage by an angle T where T = tan–1 X
R
S ; XS is the

synchronous reactance and R is the resistance of armature (stator winding). Since resistance is very 
small as compared to synchronous reactance, therefore angle T is nearly 90°. The power drawn by 
the motor at no-load is VI0 cos I0 which is sufficient to meet with the losses and make the motor 
running continuously at synchronous speed.

Fig. 8.4 Synchronous motor at no-load (considering losses)
However, when load is applied through the shaft on the motor, the rotor poles fall back a little 
more (angle G) relative to stator poles as shown in Fig. 8.5(b). Hence the torque angle increases to G
with the increase in load. This increases the resultant voltage Er which in turn increases the current 
I (I = Er /Zs) drawn by the motor from the mains.
Thus, a synchronous motor is able to supply power to the increased mechanical load, not by decrease 
in speed, but by shifting the position of the rotor poles with respect of the stator poles or field.
Fig. 8.5 Synchronous motor at load 
When load applied on the shaft of the motor is further increased, the induced, emf E falls back 
further. Hence load angle (torque angle) G increases with the increase in load. When G increases the 
resultant voltage Er increases and so the armature current I. If too great mechanical load is applied 
to the synchronous motor, the rotor is pulled out of synchronism, after which it comes to stand still.
This maximum value of torque that a motor can develop without losing its synchronism is called 
pull-out torque.

8.3 Equivalent Circuit of a Synchronous Motor
The equivalent circuit of a synchronous motor is the same, in all respects, as that of a synchronous 
generator, the only difference is that the direction of power flow is reversed in this case, as shown 
in Fig. 8.6. In the equivalent circuit
V = Voltage applied to the armature (phase value)
I = armature current (phase value) 
R = effective armature resistance in ohm per phase

Armature current, 
I = I ± – I = I cos I – jI sin I

8.6 Different Torques in a Synchronous Motor
The following torques of a synchronous motor are usually considered while selecting it for a particular 
application:
1. Locked-rotor torque. The minimum torque at any angular rotor position that is developed 
with the rotor locked (that is, stationary) and rated voltage at rated frequency is applied to the 
terminals is called locked rotor torque. This torque is provided by the stator windings.
2. Running Torque. The torque developed by the motor under running conditions is calledrunning 
torque. It is determined by the power rating and speed of the driven machine.
3. Pull-in torque. A synchronous motor is usually started as induction motor. When it runs 2 to 5 
percent below the synchronous speed, DC excitation is applied and the rotor pulls into step with 
the synchronously rotating stator field. The pull-in torque is the maximum constant torque at 
rated voltage and frequency under which a motor will pull a connected load into synchronism 
when DC excitation is applied.
4. Pull-out torque. The maximum value of torque which a synchronous motor can develop at 
rated voltage and frequency without losing synchronism is called pull-out torque.

I = armature current (phase value); 
Id = direct axis current;
Iq = quadrature current;

Iq = I cos \ = I cos (I – G)
Fig. 8.10 Phasor diagram of a salient-pole synchronous motor at lagging power factor
After combining the above equations, we get
IXq cos (I – G) = IR sin (I – G) + V sin G
IXq (cos I cos G + sin I sin G) = IR (sin I cos G – cos I sin G) + V sin G

OF = V, AC = AB cos \ = IR cos \ = IqR

Substituting the values of Id and Iq, we get,
V sin G = IR sin (I + G) + IXq cos (I + I)

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. Why the synchronous motor is not self-starting?
Or
Why can’t a synchronous motor start by itself?
Ans. When 3-phase supply is given to the stator of a 3-phase wound synchronous motor, a revolving field is 
set-up in the stator. Simultaneously, DC supply is given to the rotor which excites the poles. The stator 
revolving field tries to drag the rotor poles (or field) along with it but fails to do so due to rotor inertia.
Thus, a synchronous motor is not self-starting or in other words, a synchronous motor can’t start by 
itself.
Q.2. What is the speed regulation of a synchronous motor?
Ans. Speed regulation of a synchronous motor is zero, because 
Speed regulation = No load speed-full load speed
No-load speed

= zero
Q.3. What is pull-out torque?
Ans. Pull-out torque: The maximum value to torque which a synchronous motor can develop at rated voltage 
and frequency without losing synchronism is called pull-out torque.
Q.4. Why a synchronous motor runs only at synchronous speed?
Ans. Synchronous motor can run only at synchronous speed because rotor poles are magnetically locked with the 
stator revolving field and the these rotor poles are dragged by the stator revolving field.
8.11 Effect of Change in Excitation
Consider a synchronous motor loaded with a constant mechanical load and normal (100%) excitation 
i.e., having induced emf equal to applied voltage V in magnitude. At the given load it takes a current 
of I ampere lagging behind the applied voltage V by an angle I. As load on the machine is constant,
P = VI cos I = VE
XS
sin d is constant
Here, V and XS are constant, therefore, for constant power output E sin G and I cos I should remain 
constant, i.e.,
I cos I = Constant
E sin G = Constant
Since I cos I is constant, while drawing phasor diagram draw a horizontal dotted line passing 
through the extreme point of vector OI. On the other hand, as E sin G is constant, draw a vertical line 
passing through the extreme point of vector OE as shown in Fig. 8.20(a) and (b).
When the excitation is decreased, the induced emf decreases to E’ in magnitude so that E sin G
remains constant i.e., E decreases to Ec angle delta increases to Gc as shown in Fig. 8.20(a). This 
increases the resultant voltage Er to E r
¢ , which is also shifted in clockwise direction. With the 

702
Electrical Machines
increase in resultant voltage, current increases to Ic (Ic= E r
¢ / ZS). Since the phase angle T between 
the resultant voltage and current is constant, therefore, current is also shifted in clockwise direction. 
This increases the phase angle between voltage and current to Ic which in turn decreases the lagging 
power factor cos I to cos Ic more lagging but the active component of current Ic cos Ic remains the 
same i.e., i cos Ic = I cos I,
Hence with the decrease in excitation, synchronous motor draws more current from the supply 
mains at lower (lagging) power factor. Thus, the Motor operates as an inductor.
Fig. 8.20 Phasor diagram at constant load
When the excitation is increased, the induced emf increases in magnitude to Es keeping Es sin 
Gs to be the same as that of E sin G for constant load. This decreases the resultant voltage which is 
also shifted in anti-clockwise direction. Since the phase angle T between the resultant voltage and 
current is constant, current is also shifted in anti-clockwise direction and decreases in magnitude till 
it comes in phase with the voltage vector as shown in Fig. 8.20(b). At this instant, the current drawn 
by the synchronous motor is minimum and the power factor is maximum i.e., one.
Now, if the excitation is further increased, the induced emf increases to Eccc in magnitude. This 
increases the resultant voltage to Erccc which is also shifted further in anti-clockwise direction. 
Therefore, current is also shifted in anti-clockwise direction and its magnitude increases to Iccc. This 
increases the phase angle between voltage and current to Iccc in opposite direction as shown in Fig. 
8.19(b), which makes the power factor leading.
Thus, when synchronous motor is over excited, it draws more current at a leading power 
factor from the supply mains. A synchronous motor operating under this condition is also called 
synchronous condenser.
It may be noted that when excitation voltage E is changed, the torque angle G changes such that
E sin G = Ec sin Gc = Es sin Gs = Esc sin Gsc
Similarly, the active component of armature current also remains the same, i.e.,

Synchronous Motors 
703
I cos I = Ic cos Ic = Is cos Is = Isc cos Isc
It is also observed that when the value of E increases, the magnitude of armature current first 
decreases and then increases. The armature current is minimum at unity pf and more at lagging or 
leading power factors.
Minimum Excitation
From Fig. 8.20, it is very clear that as excitation decreases, the torque angle increases. The minimum 
permissible excitation, Emin corresponds to the stability limit, i.e., G = 90°.
Therefore, 
Emin = PX
V
S (where P is the power input)
8.12 V-Curves and Inverted V-Curves
While changing the excitation of a 3-phase synchronous motor, keeping the load constant, the curve 
plotted between field current If and armature or load current I is called V-curve,
It is named as V-curve because its shape resembles with the shape of English alphabet ‘V’. 
When the excitation of a three-phase synchronous motor taking constant power is varied, it changes 
the operating power factor of the motor. If
P = 3 VI cos I
where, 
P = Power input.
V = Terminal voltage (phase value).
I = Armature current (phase value) and 
cos I = Power factor.
then for constant power input P and terminal voltage
V, only increase in power factor causes decrease in 
armature current I and vice versa. Armature current 
will be minimum at unity power factor and increases 
when the power factor decreases on either side 
(lagging or leading).
Hence variation in excitation (field current) causes 
the variation in armature current I. If we plot a curve 
taking field current If on X-axis and the armature 
current I on Y-axis, the curve so obtained is called 
V-curve because of its shape. The V-curve at 
different power inputs are shown in Fig. 8.21.
Significance of V-Curves
V-curves are useful in adjusting the field current. By increasing the field current If beyond the level 
of minimum armature current I, we can obtain leading pf. On the other hand by decreasing the field 
Fig. 8.21 V-curves

704
Electrical Machines
current If below the level of minimum armature current I, we can obtain lagging pf. Therefore by 
controlling the field current of a synchronous motor, the reactive power supplied to or consumed 
from the power system can be controlled.
Thus, by changing the field current (or excitation), a synchronous motor can be used as a condenser 
or inductor.
Inverted V-Curves
If we plot a family of curves between power factor and field current (If), the curves so obtained are 
called invested V-curves, as shown in Fig. 8.22, because of their shape.
Fig. 8.22 Inverted V-curves
These curves reveal that:
(i) The highest point on each of these curves indicate unity p.f..
(ii) The field current for unity pf at full-load is more than the field current for unity pf at no-load.
(iii) If the synchronous motor at full-load is operating at unity p.f., then the removal of shaft load 
causes the motor to operate at a leading power factor.
8.13 Effect of Change in Load on a Synchronous Motor
A synchronous motor runs at absolutely constant speed called synchronous speed, regardless of the 
load. Let us examine how change in load affects its performance.
Consider a synchronous motor operating initially at a leading power factor cos I1. The phasor 
diagram for leading power factor is shown in Fig. 8.23.
Let the load on the shaft be increased. The rotor slows down momentarily since it takes some 
time to settle down as per the increased power drawn from the lines. In other words, although still 
rotating at synchronous speed, the rotor slips back in space as a result of increased loading as shown 
in Fig. 8.23. In this process the torque angle G becomes larger and therefore the induced torque

VE
X

increases. The increased torque increases the rotor speed and the motor again 
picks up the synchronous speed but with a larger torque angle G. Thus, with the increase in load, the 

Synchronous Motors 
705
torque angle G increases. But the magnitude of excitation voltage E remains constant which depends 
upon field current If and speed and both of them are constant.

These expressions show that the increase in P increases E sin G and I cos ). The locus of E is 
shown in Fig. 8.24. It is seen from Fig. 8.24 that with the increase of the load, the quantity jIXs goes 
on increasing so that the relation V = E + jIXS is satisfied and therefore the armature current I also 
increases. It is also seen from Fig. 8.24 that the power factor angle I also changes. It becomes less 
and less leading and then becomes more and more lagging.
Fig. 8.24 Effect of increase in load on the operation of a synchronous motor

706
Electrical Machines
Thus, when the load on a synchronous motor is increased,
(i) the motor speed does not change, it continues to run at synchronous speed.
(ii) the torque angle G increases.
(iii) the excitation voltage E remains constant since If is constant
(iv) the armature current I drawn from the supply increases.
(v) the phase angle I first decreases in the leading region and then increases in the lagging region.
There is a limit to the mechanical load that can be applied to a synchronous motor depending 
upon its rating. As the load is increased, the torque angle G increases till a stage is reached when the 
rotor is pulled out of synchronism and the motor is stopped. The maximum value of torque which a 
synchronous motor can develop at rated voltage and frequency without losing synchronism is called 
the pull-out torque. Its value may vary from 1.5 to 3.5 times the full-load torque.
8.14 Methods of Starting of Synchronous Motors
Since a synchronous motor is inherently not self-starting, the following methods are generally adopted 
to start the synchronous motor:
1. By means of Auxiliary Motor: A small induction motor called the pony motor (auxiliary motor) 
is mounted on the same shaft or coupled to synchronous motor as shown in Fig. 8.25. The auxiliary 
motor should have the same number of poles as that of synchronous motor or preferably one pole 
pair less so that it can rotate the motor nearly at synchronous speed. First of all supply is given to the 
pony motor. When it rotates the rotor of the synchronous motor near to the synchronous speed 
the main switch and DC switch of the main synchronous motor are closed.
Fig. 8.25 Starting of synchronous motor by means of auxiliary motor
The rotor poles are pulled into synchronism with the rotating field (poles) of the armature (stator) 
of the main motor. Then supply to the auxiliary motor is disconnected and it acts as a load on the 
main motor.

Synchronous Motors 
707
2. By providing damper winding: This is a most common method of starting a synchronous motor. 
In this method, the motor is first started as a squirrel cage induction motor by providing a special 
winding on the rotor poles, known as damper or squirrel cage winding. This damper winding consists 
of number of copper bars embedded into the slots or holes provided on the outer periphery of the 
pole shoes, where salient poles are employed, and then short circuiting these bars by brazing them to 
end rings as shown in Fig. 8.26. In a non-salient pole machine, the damper winding conductors are 
placed in the rotor slots above the main field winding and short circuited by the end rings.
Fig. 8.26 Starting of synchronous motor by providing damper winding
When the synchronous motor (armature) is connected to 3-phase supply mains, a revolving 
field is set up which causes the rotor to rotate as a squirrel cage induction motor. As soon as motor 
attains about 65% synchronous speed, the rotor winding is connected to DC mains (exciter) and 
the rotor field is magnetically locked with the stator rotating field and the motor starts running 
runs as a synchronous motor. 
8.15 Synchronous Condenser
The power factor of a synchronous motor can be controlled over a wide range by adjusting its 
excitation. At no-load, when the motor is over-excited it may draw the current from mains which 
leads the voltage by large angle nearly 90°. Hence, the motor acts like a static capacitor and is known 
as a synchronous condenser.
Thus, an over excited synchronous motor operating at no-load is called a synchronous condenser 
or synchronous capacitor.
When an over excited motor is operated on the same electrical system to which some industrial 
load (induction motors, induction furnaces, arc furnaces, etc.) is operating at lagging power factor, the 
leading reactive power supplied by the synchronous motor compensates for the lagging reactive power 
of industrial load and improves the overall power factor of the system. In large industrial plants, which 
have a low lagging power factor load, it is often found economical to install an over excited synchronous 
motor (synchronous condenser), even though the motor is not required to drive a load.

Consider an industrial load PL operating at a power factor cos I1. When an over excited motor 
drawing power Pm is connected in parallel with the existing load as shown in Fig. 8.27(a), some of 
the lagging reactive power of the industrial load in compensated by the leading reactive power of the 
motor (i.e., Prm) which improves the over-all power factor to cos I2 as shown in Fig. 8.27(b).

Example 8.21
The excitation of a 3-phase synchronous motor connected in parallel with a load of 500 kW 
operating at 0·8 p.f. lagging is adjusted to improve the overall p.f. of the system to 0.9 lagging. If 
the mechanical load on the motor including losses is 125 kW, calculate the kVA input to the 
synchronous motor and its p.f.
Solution:
Industrial load, PL = 500 kW

8.16 Characteristics of Synchronous Motor
A synchronous motor has the following important characteristics;
1. It is inherently not a self-starting motor.
2. For a given frequency, it operates only at one speed called synchronous speed given by the 
expression NS = 120 f / P.
3. It can be operated under a wide range of power factors both lagging and leading.
4. In addition to the motor being used for mechanical load, it is also used as a power factor 
improvement equipment and is known as synchronous condenser.
5. At no-load it draws a very small current from the mains to meet the internal losses of the motor. 
With the increase in load, the torque angle G increases due to which motor draws more current 
from the mains. After the input current reaches maximum (torque angle G in nearly 90°) no 
further increase in load is possible. If the motor is further loaded it goes out of synchronism 
and stops.

711
8.17 Hunting
When a synchronous motor is loaded, the rotor poles slightly fall back in position with respect to the 
stator field (poles) by an angle G known as power angle or torque angle or retarding angle. As the 
load is gradually increased, this angle G also increases gradually so as to produce more torque for 
coping with the increased load and the motor remains in equilibrium. If the load is suddenly thrown 
off, angle G decreases suddenly and the rotor poles are pulled into almost exact opposition to the 
stator poles, but due to inertia of rotor and rotor poles travel too far. They are then pulled back again, 
and so on, thus oscillations are set up around the equilibrium position, corresponding to new load. If 
these oscillations are too large they may throw the motor out of synchronism and stops.
The oscillation of the rotor about its equilibrium position is known as hunting.
The hunting (oscillations) can be prevented by providing damper winding or squirrel cage winding 
on the rotor pole faces. This damper winding consists of number of copper bars embedded into the 
slots provided on the outer periphery of the pole shoes and then short circuited by end rings. When 
hunting takes place, there is relative motion of the rotor with respect to the stator field, which sets up 
eddy currents in this winding which flow in such a way that it suppresses the oscillations.
The hunting may also occur when the machine is operating as an alternator. In this case also 
because of sudden change in electrical output or mechanical input oscillations are set up in the rotor called 
hunting; which can be prevented by providing damper winding on the rotor.
From the above discussions, the following factors are evolved:
Causes of Hunting
1. Sudden change in the load. 
2. Sudden change in the field current.
3. Cyclic variation of the load torque. 
4. Faults occurring in the system.
Effects of Hunting
1. The machine (generator or motor) may go out of synchronism. This is the most important 
phenomenon to be avoided.
2. Large mechanical stresses may develop in the rotor shaft.
3. It increases the possibility of resonance. It happens when the frequency of torque component 
becomes equal to that of the transient oscillations of the synchronous machine.
4. It increases the machine losses which may overheat the machine.
5. It may cause variations in supply voltage (generator action) producing lamp flickering.
Reduction of Hunting
1. By using damper winding: The eddy currents developed in the damper winding, damped down 
the oscillations.
2. By using flywheels: The prime-mover is provided with a large and heavy flywheel which 
increases the inertia of the prime-mover and helps in maintaining the motor speed constant.

8.18 Applications of Synchronous Motors
The following are the important applications of synchronous motors:
1. These are used to improve the power factor of large industries.
2. These are used at the substations to improve the power factor.
3. These are used to control the voltage at the end of transmission lines by varying their excitation. 
When operated in this manner, it is called a synchronous phase modifier or reactor.
4. These are used to textile mills, cement factories, mining industries and rubber mills for power 
applications.
These motors are mostly used to drive equipment which are operated at constant speed continuously 
such as centrifugal pumps, centrifugal fans, air compressors, motor-generator sets, blowers, etc.
8.19 Comparison between Three-phase Synchronous and Induction 
Motors
Se. No. Particulars
Synchronous motor
Induction motor
1.
Magnetic excitation
A synchronous motor is a doubly 
excited machine. Its armature 
winding is energised from an AC 
source, whereas, its field winding is 
excited from a DC source
An induction motor is a singly-
excited machine. Its stator winding 
is energised from an AC source and 
rotor is excited due to induction.
2.
Speed
It always runs at synchronous speed
and its speed is independent of load.
Its speed falls with the increase 
in load and is always less than the 
synchronous speed.
3.
Starting
It is not self-starting. It has to be run 
upto synchronous speed by some 
means before it can be synchronised 
to AC supply.
An induction motor has got self-
starting torque.
4.
Power factor
A synchronous motor can be 
operated under wide range of power 
factors, both lagging and leading by 
changing its excitation.
An induction motor operates at only 
lagging power factor, which becomes 
very poor at light loads.
5.
Major application
It is usually used for power factor 
correction in addition to supplying 
torque to drive mechanical loads.
An induction motor is used for 
driving mechanical loads only.
6.
Efficiency
It is more efficient than induction 
motor of the same output and 
voltage rating.
Its efficiency is lesser than that of 
a synchronous motor of the same 
output and voltage rating.
7.
Cost
A synchronous motor is costlier
than an induction motor of the same 
output and voltage rating.
The cost of an induction motor is 
less than a synchronous motor of the 
same output and voltage rating.

8.20 Merits and Demerits of Synchronous Motor
Merits
(i) The ease with which the power factor can be controlled. An over-excited synchronous motor 
having a leading power factor can be operated in parallel with induction motors and other power 
apparatus operating at lagging power factors, thereby improving the power factor of the supply 
system.
(ii) The speed is constant and independent of load. This characteristic is mainly of use when the 
motor is required to drive another alternator to generate a supply at a different frequency as in 
frequency changers.
(iii) Electro-magnetic power varies linearly with the voltage.
(iv) These motors can be constructed with wider air gaps than induction motors, which make them 
better mechanically.
(v) These motors usually operate at higher efficiencies, especially in the low speed unity pf ranges.
Demerits
(i) The cost per kW output is generally higher than that of an induction motor.
(ii) It requires DC excitation which must be supplied from external source.
(iii) The synchronous motor is inherently not self-starting motor and needs some arrangement for 
its starting and synchronising.
(iv) It cannot be used for variable speed jobs as there is no possibility of speed adjustment.
(v) It cannot be started under load. Its starting torque is zero.
(vi) It has a tendency to hunt.
(vii) It may fall out of synchronism and stop when over-loaded.
(viii) Collector rings and brushes are required.
(ix) For some purposes synchronous motors are not desirable as for driving shafts in small work-
shops having no other power available for starting and in cases where frequent starting or strong 
starting torque is required.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. What will happen, if the excitation of a synchronous motor connected to an infinite bus-bar is varied, 
load remaining constant?
Or
What happens if the excitation of a synchronous motor is varied at constant load.
Ans. Effect of change in excitation keeping load constant on a synchronous motor
The change in excitation changes the power factor of the machine.
(i) If excitation is decreased, the power factor becomes lagging and is further reduced. The machine 
behaves as an inductor and the machine is known as synchronous inductor.
(ii) If excitation is increased, the lagging power factor of the machine is improved and becomes unity. If it 
is further increased, the machine starts operating at leading power factor. The machine behaves as a 
capacitor and it is known as synchronous condenser.
Q.2. How a synchronous motor can be used as a synchronous condenser?
Ans. An over-excited synchronous motor draws power at leading power factor, under this condition it can 
be used as a synchronous condenser.
Q.3. Why dampers are used in a synchronous motor?
Ans. In synchronous motors, dampers are used to suppress the oscillations of the rotor around its find 
position.
Q.4. How is a synchronous motor started.
Or
How a synchronous motor is made self-starting?
Ans. A synchronous motor is not self-starting. It can be started by using either of the following methods:
1. By using an auxiliary motor: This motor is coupled to the shaft of main motor and rotates it almost at 
synchronous speed. Then DC excitation is given to rotor poles of the main motor which are magnetically 
locked with the stator revolving field and motor starts rotating at synchronous speed.
2. By using damper winding: Due to damper winding the synchronous motor stars rotating as a squirrel 
cage induction motor. Once, it picks-up speed near to synchronous speed, DC excitation is given to the 
rotor poles. Thus, the rotor poles are magnetically locked with the stator revolving field and the motor 
starts rotating at synchronous speed.
Q.5. Define the term over-excitation and under-excitation with reference to synchronous machines.
Ans. Over-excitation: The excitation (field current) at which a synchronous motor operates at leading power 
factor is called over-excitation.
Under-excitation: The excitation (field current) at which a synchronous motor operates at lagging power 
factor is called under-excitation.

4. Wrong connections
5. High friction at the bearings
6. Field winding is not excited properly
7. Over-loaded at the start
8. Some fault in the armature or field winding
9. Poor contact of brushes at the sliprings.
Q.7. Mention the characteristic features of synchronous motor.

1. Synchronous motor operates only at synchronous speed.
2. It is not a self-starting motor.
3. It can be operated in a wide range of power factor both lagging and leading.
4. At no-load it draws very small current to meet with the mechanical losses.
5. It can be used to regulate the voltage of transmission lines.
Q.8. What happens when the field current of a synchronous motor is increased beyond the normal value 
at constant input?
Ans. When field current of a synchronous motor is increased beyond normal it starts working at leading 
power factor and is called as a synchronous condenser.
Q.9. Why synchronous motor is designated as P.F. improving device?
Ans. An over excited synchronous motor operates at leading power factor, under this condition it can improve 
the power factor of the system. Hence, designated as power factor improving device.
Q.10. Show the inverted V-curve for synchronous machine.
Ans. Inverted V-Curves
If we plot a family of curves between power factor and field current (If), the curves so obtained are called 
invested V-curves, as shown in Fig. Q.19, because of their shape.

Introduction
Induction machines are also called asynchronous machines i.e., the machines which never run at a 
synchronous speed. Whenever we say induction machine we mean to say induction motor. Induction 
motors may be single-phase or three-phase. The single phase induction motors are usually built in

small sizes (upto 3 H.P). Three phase induction motors are the most commonly used AC motors in 
the industry because they have simple and rugged construction, low cost, high efficiency, reasonably 
good power factor, self-starting and low maintenance cost. Almost more than 90% of the mechanical 
power used in industry is provided by three phase induction motors.
In this chapter, we shall deal with all the important aspects of a three phase induction motor.
9.1 Constructional Features of a Three-phase Induction Motor
A 3-phase induction motor consists of two main parts, namely stator and rotor.
1. Stator: It is the stationary part of the motor. It has three main parts, namely. (i) Outer frame, 
(ii) Stator core and (iii) Stator winding.
(i) Outer frame: It is the outer body of the motor. Its function is to support the stator core and 
to protect the inner parts of the machine. For small machines the fame is casted but for 
large machines it is fabricated.
To place the motor on the foundation, feet are provided in the outer frame as shown in Fig. 
9.1.
(ii) Stator core: When AC supply is given to the induction motor, an alternating flux is set -up in 
the stator core. This alternating field produces hysteresis and eddy current loss. To minimise 
these losses, the core is made of high grade silicon steel stampings. The stampings are 
assembled under hydraulic pressure and are keyed to the frame. Each stamping is insulated 
from the other with a thin varnish layer. The thickness to the stamping usually varies from 
0.3 to 0.5 mm. Slots are punched on the inner periphery of the stampings, as shown in Fig. 
9.2, to accommodate stator winding.
Fig. 9.1 
Stator 
Fig. 9.2
Stator stamping
(iii) Stator winding: The stator core carries a three phase winding which is usually supplied 
from a three phase supply system. The six terminals of the winding (two of each phase) are 
connected in the terminal box of the machine. The stator of the motor is wound for definite

number of poles, the exact number being determined by the requirement of speed. It will

. The three- phase winding may be connected in star or delta 
externally through a starter.
2. Rotor: The rotating part of the motor is called rotor. Two types of rotors are used for 3-phase 
induction motors. (i) Squirrel cage rotor (ii) Phase wound rotor.
(i) Squirrel cage rotor: The motors in which these rotors are employed are called Squirrel 
cage induction motors. Because of simple and rugged construction, the most of the 
induction motors employed in the industry are of this type. A squirrel cage rotor consists 
of a laminated cylindrical core having semi-closed circular slots at the outer periphery. 
Copper or aluminium bar conductors are placed in these slots and short circuited at each 
end by copper or aluminium rings, called short circuiting rings, as shown in Fig. 9.3. Thus, 
in these rotors, the rotor winding is permanently short-circuited and no external resistance 
can be added in the rotor circuit. Figure 9.3 clearly shows that the slots are not parallel to 
the shaft but these are skewed. The skewing provides the following advantages: 
(a) Humming is reduced, that ensures quiet running.
(b) At different positions of the rotor, smooth and sufficient torque is obtained.
(c) It reduces the magnetic locking of the stator and rotor,
(d) It increases the rotor resistance due to the increased length of the rotor bar conductors. 
Fig. 9.3 Squirrel cage rotor
(ii) Phase wound rotor: It is also known as slip ring rotor and the motors in which these rotors 
are employed are known as phase wound or slipring induction motors. This rotor is also 
cylindrical in shape which consists of large number of stampings. A number of semi-closed 
slots are punched at its outer periphery. A 3-phase insulated winding is placed in these 
slots. The rotor is wound for the same number of poles as that of stator. The rotor winding 
is connected in star and its remaining three terminals are connected to the slip rings. The 
rotor core is keyed to the shaft. Similarly, slip-rings are also keyed to the shaft but these 
are insulated from the shaft. (see Fig. 9. 4).
In this case, depending upon the requirement any external resistance can be added in the 
rotor circuit. In this case also the rotor is skewed.
A mild steel shaft is passed through the centre of the rotor and is fixed to it with key. The 
purpose of shaft is to transfer mechanical power.

9.2 Production of Revolving Field
The detail description of production of revolving field has been discussed in chapter 6 please refer 
the same. However, here we will go through the topic quickly.
Consider a stator on which three different windings represented by three concentric coils a1a2, 
b1b2 and c1c2 respectively are placed 120° electrically apart.
Let a 3-phase supply, as shown in Fig. 9.5, is applied to the stator. Three phase currents will flow 
through the three coils and produce their own magnetic fields. The positive half cycle of the alternating 
current is considered as inward flow of current in the start terminals and negative half cycle is considered 
as outward flow of current in the start terminals. The direction of flow of current is opposite in the 
finish terminals of the same coil.
Fig. 9.5 Wave diagram of 3- phase supply
Let at any instant t1, current in coilside a1 be inward and in b1 and c1 outward. Whereas, the current 
in the other sides of the same coils is opposite i.e., in coil side a2 is outward and b2 and c2 is inward. 
The resultant field and its direction (Fm) is marked in Fig. 9.6.
At instant t2 when T is 60°, current in coil sides a1 and b1is inward and in c1 is outward. Whereas, 
the current in the opposite sides is opposite. The resultant field and its direction is shown in Fig. 9.7, 
which is rotated through an angle T = 60° from its previous position.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
725
At instant t3 when T is 120°, current in coilside b1 is inward and in c1 and a1 is outward. The 
resultant field and its direction is shown in Fig. 9.8. Which is rotated through an angle T = 120° 
electrical from its first position.
Thus, in one cycle, the resultant field completes one revolution. Hence, we conclude that when 
3-phase supply is given to a 3-phase wound stator, a resultant field is produced which revolves at 
a constant speed, called synchronous speed (Ns = 120°f /P).
Fig. 9.6 
Stator field position Fig. 9.7
Stator field position Fig. 9.8
Stator field position

at instant t2
at instant t3
In this case, we have seen that when supply from phase 1,2 and 3 is given to coil a1a2, b1b2 and 
c1c2, respectively, an anticlockwise rotating field is produced. If the supply to coil a1a2, b1b2 and c1c2
is given from phase 1, 3 and 2 respectively, the direction of rotating field is reversed. Thus, to reverse 
the direction of rotation of rotating field the connections of any two supply terminals are inter changed.
9.3 Principle of Operation 
When 3-phase supply is given to the stator winding of a 3-phase wound induction motor, a revolving 
field is set up in the stator core. The resultant magnetic field set-up by the stator core, at any instant, 
is shown in Fig. 9.9. The direction of the resultant field is marked by an arrow head Fm. As per the 
supply sequence, let this field is rotating in an anti-clockwise direction at synchronous speed Zs
radian per second.
The revolving field is cut by the stationary rotor conductors and an emf is induced in the rotor 
conductors. Since the rotor conductors are short circuited, current flows through them in the direction 
as marked in Fig. 9.9(a). A resultant field Fr is set-up by the rotor current carrying conductors. This 
field tries to come in line with the stator revolving field Fm, due to which an electromagnetic torque 
Te develops and rotor starts rotating in same direction as that of stator revolving field.
Alternately: Reproducing section X of Fig. 9.9(a) as shown in Fig. 9.10, when the revolving stator 
field see Fig. 9.10 (a) cuts the stationary rotor conductors, an emf is induced in the conductors by 
induction. As rotor conductors are short circuited, current flows through them, as marked in Fig. 
9.10 (b), which sets up field around them. A resultant field is set up, as shown in Fig. 9.10 (c), which 
exerts force on the rotor conductors. Thus, the rotor starts rotating in the same direction in which 
stator field is revolving.

726
Electrical Machines
Fig. 9.9 Phaser position of stator and rotor field
Fig. 9.10 Working principle of induction motor
The rotor picks up speed and tries to attain the synchronous speed but fails to do so. It is because 
if the rotor attains the synchronous speed then the relative speed between revolving stator field and 
rotor will be zero, no emf will be induced in rotor conductors. No emf means no current, no rotor 
field Fr and hence no torque is produced. Thus, an induction motor can never run at synchronous 
speed. It always runs at a speed less than synchronous speed.
Since, the principle of operation of this motor depends upon electromagnetic induction, hence 
the name induction motor.
9.4 Reversal of Direction of Rotation of Three-phase Induction Motors
In section 9.2 it has been seen that a revolving field is set up in the stator of a 3-phase induction motor 
when 3-phase supply is given to its winding and the direction of rotation depends upon the supply 
sequence.
In section 9.3, it has been see that rotor of a three phase induction motor rotates in the same 
direction as that of the revolving field.
The direction of rotation of the revolving field or that of the rotor can be reversed if the sequence 
of supply is reversed. The supply sequence can be reversed by interchanging the connections of any 
two supply leads at the stator terminals.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
727
Hence, the direction of rotation of a 3-phase induction motor can be reversed by interchanging 
the connections of any two supply leads at the stator terminals.
9.5 Slip 
In an induction motor, the speed of rotor is always less than synchronous speed.
The difference between the speed of revolving field (Ns) and the rotor speed (N) is called slip.
The slip is usually expressed as a percentage of synchronous speed (Ns) and is represented by 
symbol S.

The difference between synchronous speed and rotor speed is called slip speed i.e.,
Slip speed = Ns – N
The value of slip at full load varies from about 6% small motors to about 2% for large motors.
Importance of Slip
Slip plays an important role in the operation of an induction motor. We have already seen that the 
difference between the rotor speed and synchronous speed of flux determine the rate at which the 
flux is cut by rotor conductors and hence the magnitude of induced emf i.e., e2 v NS – N

or

Hence, T v S
Thus, greater the slip greater will be the induced emf or rotor current and hence larger will be 
the torque developed.
At no-load, induction motor requires small torque to meet with the losses only such as mechanical, 
iron and other losses. Therefore rotor speed at no-load is very high and the slip is very small. When 
the motor is loaded, greater torque is required to drive the load, therefore, the slip increases and 
rotor speed decreases slightly.
Thus, it is seen that ship in an induction motor adjusts itself to such a value so as to meet the 
required driving torque under normal operation.

9.6 Frequency of Rotor Currents 
The frequency of rotor currents depends upon the relative speed between rotor and stator field. 
When the rotor is stationary, the relative speed between stator revolving field and stationary rotor 
conductors is (Ns– 0 = Ns) the frequency of rotor currents is the same as that of the supply frequency. 
But once the rotor starts rotating, the frequency of rotor currents decreases depends upon relative 
speed or slip speed (Ns – N).

9.7 Speed of Rotor Field or mmf
When three-phase currents are supplied to the stator winding of a poly phase induction 
motor, a resultant field is set up which rotates at a constant speed called synchronous speed 
(NS = 120f/P).
This rotating field induces poly phase emfs. in the rotor winding and if rotor winding is closed, 
poly phase currents circulate in it. These currents set up a revolving field in the rotor which rotates 
at a speed
Nr = 120 fr /P with respect to rotor.
Now 
Nr = 120 × Sf/P = SNS
When rotor itself is rotating at a speed N rpm in the space.
?
Speed of rotor field in space = N + Nr =(1 – S) NS + SNS = NS – SNS + SNS = NS

730
Electrical Machines
Thus, rotor magnetic field also rotates, in space, at the same speed and in the same direction as 
that of stator field. Hence, the two fields are magnetically locked with each other and are stationary 
with respect to each other.
9.8 Rotor emf
The revolving magnetic field set up in the stator by poly phase currents is common to both stator 
and rotor winding. This field induces emfs. in both the windings. The stator induced emf per phase 
is given by the relation;
E1 = 4.44 kw1 T1 f fm
…(i)
Where kw1 = winding factor i.e., product or coil span factor kc and distribution factor kd. 
T1 = No. of turns/phase of stator winding;
f = stator or supply frequency and 
fm = maximum value of flux.
The rotor induced emf/phase, E2 = 4.44 kw2 T2 fr fm
…(ii)
Where fr is the rotor current frequency, and under stationary condition i.e., at the start fr = f. 
Therefore, rotor induced emf/phase at stand still or start, E2s = 4.44 kw2 T2 f fm
Dividing eq. (ii) by (i), we get,

From eq. (ii), induced emf in the rotor under running condition, 
E2 = 4·44 kw2 T2 (Sf) Im= SE2S
The induced emf in the rotor circuit is maximum at the start and varies according to the value 
of slip under running condition. Since, the value of normal slip under loaded condition is nearly 5% 
therefore, the rotor induced emf is nearly 5% of the maximum value.
9.9 Rotor Resistance 
Since the rotor winding is made of some conducting material (copper or aluminium), it has a definite 
resistance (R= U l/a). Its value remains constant and is denoted by R2. 
9.10 Rotor Reactance 
Whole of the flux produced by the rotor currents does not link with the stator winding. The part of 
rotor flux which links the rotor conductors but not with the stator winding is called leakages flux 
and hence develops leakage inductance (L2). The leakage flux and hence the inductance is very 
small if the rotor conductors are placed at the outermost periphery of the rotor as shown in Fig. 9.11. 
Depending upon the rotor current frequency, rotor reactance will be developed.
Rotor reactance, X2 = 2S fr L2 = 2S Sf L2 = S (2S f L2)

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
731
When the rotor is standstill i.e., at the start, when slip, S = 1 
The value of rotor reactance = X2s = 2S f L2
Thus, under normal running, rotor reactance, X2 = SX2s 
Fig. 9.11 Rotor leakage flux
9.11 Rotor Impedance
The total opposition offered to the flow of rotor current by the rotor circuit is called the rotor 
impedance.

Short Answer Type Questions
Q.1. How does the name of an induction motors is derived? 
(PTU)
Ans. The name of an induction motor is derived from the fact that it work on the basic principle of mutual 
induction. The current in the rotor conductions is induced by the motion of rotor conductor relative to 
the magnetic field produced by the stator currents.
Q.2. Classify 3-phase induction motors on the basis of their construction. Which one is generally 
preferred and why?
Ans. Three-phase induction motors may be classified as (i) squirrel cage induction motors and (ii) phase 
wound or slip-ring induction motor.
Squirrel cage induction motor is generally preferred due to its low construction cost, low maintenance, 
high pf, high efficiency, robust construction etc.

740
Electrical Machines
Q.3. Usually semi-closed slots are preferred is small motors, why? 
Ans. In case of semi-closed slots, the reluctance becomes more uniform and improves the power factor of 
the motor.
Q.4. Why the rotor slots of an induction motor are skewed?
Ans. The rotor slots of an induction motor are skewed to reduce humming noise and ensuring quiet running, 
reduce magnetic locking and for smooth and uniform torque.
Q.5. Why the rotor conductors of the squirrel cage rotor are short-circuited in the case of slip-ring 
induction motors, the rotor circuit is closed through resistors? 
Ans. In induction motors, torque develops by the interaction of stator and rotor fields. The rotor field is 
developed only if current flows through the rotor conductors which is only possible if rotor circuit is 
closed or short-circuited.
Q.6. What is slip in an induction motor? 
Ans. The difference between the synchronous speed of stator revolving field and the rotor speed expressed 
as a fraction of synchronous speed is known as a slip in an induction motor.
Q.7. What is the value of slip at start in an induction motor? 
Ans. 1
Q.8. If the full load speed of a 3-phase, 50 Hz induction motor is 1460 rpm, what will be its synchronous 
speed?
Ans. 1500 rpm.
9.14 Stator Parameters 
Like rotor the stator winding of the motor also has resistance R1. The flux produced by stator winding 
linking with its own turns only (leakage flux) produces leakage reactance X1. 
Of the total voltage V applied to the stator, a part of it is consumed by stator resistance (I1Rl) and 
leakage reactance (I1X1) and the remaining is utilised in establishing mutual flux which links with 
stator and rotor winding both. When it links with the stator winding it produces self-induced emf E1.

9.15 Induction Motor on No-load
(Rotor circuit open)
In slip ring induction motor rotor circuit can be opened. Under this condition, when stator is connected 
to 3-phase supply, it draws a very small current called no-load current I0. This current has two 
components i.e., working component Iw and magnetising component Imag. Working component is in 
phase with the supply voltage and it supplies the stator iron losses. Whereas, magnetising component 
lags behind the supply voltage V by 90° and produces the mutual flux which links with stator and 
rotor winding and induces E1 and E2s.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
741
The equivalent circuit and phasor diagram of the motor under this condition is shown in Fig. 9.19.
Fig. 9.19 Induction motor at no-load
9.16 Induction Motor on Load
When load is applied on the induction motor its speed decreases slightly and slip increases. Thus rotor 
current I2 increases. Simultaneously, to meet with this load, motor draws extra current from the supply 
mains similar to that of a transformer. In fact, power is transferred through magnetic field or flux.
The complete circuit diagram and phasor diagram of a loaded induction motor is shown in Fig. 
9.20(a) and (b), respectively.
Here,

The circuit shown in Fig. 20(a) is similar to the equivalent circuit of a transformer with secondary

9.17 Induction Motor vs Transformer
An induction motor can be compared with a transformer considering the following facts:
Similarities
1. Induction devices: Both induction motor and transformer are the induction devices. the stator 
and rotor of an induction motor can be compared to the primary and secondary of a transformer.
2. Performance at no-load: When a 3-phase supply in fed to the stator of a 3-phase induction 

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
743
motor, a revolving field is set-up in the stator core and an emf is induced in the rotor as well as 
in the stator winding (please refer to Art. No 9.8) similarly as it is induced in the secondary and 
primary winding of a transformer but in this case field is pulsating not revolving. If we refer 
to the equations, the only difference is that in case of induction motors, the winding factor kw
(kw= kcu kd) is considered since the winding is distributed over the stator core as per the design 
requirement. Thus, an induction motor at standstill exhibits the characteristics of a transformer 
on no-load. In induction motors also the leakage fluxes exist as in a transformer. 
3. Performance on-load: Under load conditions also the behaviour of both the devices is similar. 
The flow of current in the rotor conductors produces rotor mmf. The rotor mmf and stator 
mmf both are rotating at synchronous speed and hence stationary with respect to each other, 
thus can be combined. This produces the same effect as it is produced in a transformer where 
mmf produced by primary and secondary are combined. Because of this combined mmf, 
when load on the transformer (secondary) increases, the primary draws extra current from 
the supply and the load current is transferred through mmf depending upon transformation 
ratio. Similarly, when mechanical load on an induction motor increases, rotor current increases 
and simultaneously motor draws extra current from the supply and the transfer of load occurs 
through mmf,
4. Performance under short circuit: An induction motor with blocked rotor is similar to a 
transformer under short circuit. The stator and rotor windings have resistance and leakage 
reactances just as transformer primary and secondary windings have and hence, the equivalent 
circuit and phasor diagram of an induction motor is similar to a transformer.
Dissimilarities 
Although, as per performance, both are similar devices as explained above but at the same time there 
are some dissimilarities too as mentioned below:
1. Winding placement and designing:As per the need, induction motor winding is well distributed 
over its core, where as in a transformer, the winding is concentrated.
2. Operating conditions: An induction motor is a rotating device; basically it converts electrical 
energy into mechanical energy. Whereas a transformer is a static device; basically it transfers 
electrical energy from one circuit to the other and while doing so the voltage level is raised or 
lowered.
3. Leakage reactance and magnetising current: since there is air gap between rotor and stator, the 
leakage reactances in an induction motor are higher than in a transformer. Moreover, induction 
motor draws more magnetising current which reduces its power factor.
4. Losses and efficiency: induction motor has more losses (i.e., mechanical losses because of 
rotating parts) and lower efficiency than a transformer. 
9.18 Reasons of Low Power Factor of Induction Motors
The basic principle of operation of an induction motor is mutual induction. When 3-phase supply is 
given to a 3-phase wound stator of an induction motor, a revolving field is set up in the stator. This 

744
Electrical Machines
field (flux) is also set up in the air between stator and rotor which links with rotor conductors and 
an emf is induced in them by mutual induction.
To set up the mutual flux, induction motor draws magnetising current (Imag) from the mains which 
lags behind the voltage by 90° as shown in Figs. 9.19(a) and 9.20(b). The magnitude of this current 
is quite large because of high reluctance of the air gap between stator and rotor.
The power factor of the induction motor is minimum at no-load as shown in Fig. 9.19 (a) since the 
magnetising current has its dominating effect. However, the power factor increases with increase in 
load on the induction motor and is maximum at full load as shown in Fig. 9.20 (b). 
Therefore, it is advised to operate the induction at full load.
Thus, because of air gap, induction motor draws large magnetising current and operates at low 
lagging power factor.
9.19 Main Losses in an Induction Motor
The major losses in an induction motor are:
1. Stator losses: The losses which occur in the stator of an induction motor are called stator losses.
(i) Stator copper losses – I1
2 R1 (per phase)
(ii) Stator iron losses- These are the hysteresis and eddy current losses.
2. Rotor losses: which occur in the rotor of an induction motor are called rotor losses.
(i) Rotor copper losses – l2
2 R2 (per phase) 
(ii) Rotor iron losses- Since under normal running condition rotor frequency is very small, 
therefore. These losses are so small that they are neglected.
3. Mechanical losses: The sum of windage and friction losses is called mechanical losses.
9.20 Power Flow Diagram 
Electrical power input is given to the stator. There are stator copper and iron losses and the remaining 
power i.e.,stator output is transferred to the rotor through magnetic flux called rotor input. In the 
rotor there are rotor copper losses and the remaining power is converted into mechanical power called 
mechanical power developed in the rotor. Then there are mechanical losses and the remaining power 
is available at the shaft called mechanical power output.
The power flow diagram is shown in Fig. 9.21.

Core loss is 290 watt, stator copper loss is 568 watt, rotor copper loss in 445 watt, friction and 
windage losses are 100 watt. Determine; (a) power transferred across air gap; (b) mechanical power 
in watt developed by rotor; (c) mechanical power output in watt; (d) efficiency; (e) slip. 
Solution:
Power input to motor or stator = 9100 watt
Power transferred across air gap = Stator input – Stator core loss – Stator copper loss
= 9100 – 290 – 568 = 8242 W (Ans)
Mechanical power developed in rotor = rotor input – Rotor copper loss = 8242 – 445 = 7797

The torque developed will be maximum at a particular value of slip. As, slip (S) is a variable 
quantity, therefore, to obtain the condition for maximum torque, the above expression for torque is 
differentiated with respect to S and equated to zero.

or

for full load torque, we get,

Thus, the maximum torque is independent of rotor resistance but it is inversely proportional to 
rotor reactance at standstill (i.e., X2s). Therefore, to achieve higher value of maximum torque, the 
leakage reactance of the rotor should be kept minimum. This is achieved (i) by placing the rotor 
conductors very near to the outer periphery of the rotor and (ii) by reducing the air gap between 
stator and rotor to smallest possible value.
9.25 Starting Torque
At start rotor is stationary and the value of slip is one i.e., S = 1.
Thus, to obtain the expression for starting torque, substitute the value of slip, S = 1 in the expression 
of full load torque;

Sometimes maximum torque is required at start. In that case, in the condition for maximum torque 
substitute the value of S = 1.
R2 = SX2s = X2s
(since S = 1 at start)
Thus, to obtain maximum torque at start, the value of rotor resistance must be equal to rotor leakage 
reactance at standstill. Therefore, at start some external resistance is added in the rotor circuit. This 
is only possible in case of slip ring induction motors. This is the reason, why slip ring induction 
motors are applied where heavy loads are required to be picked up at start such as in lifts, cranes, 
elevators etc. Once the motor picks up the load the external resistance is gradually reduced to zero.
In case of squirrel cage induction motors, the rotor resistance is fixed and is kept quite low in 
comparison to rotor reactance, otherwise the rotor copper losses would be high and the efficiency 
of the motor would fall to low value. However to obtain higher starting torque in case of squirrel 
cage induction motors another cage is embedded in the rotor and the motor is called a double cage 
induction motor.

Thus, when the supply voltage V is changed, it changes the torque T developed by the motor under 
running condition. With the decrease in supply voltage, torque decreases abruptly and in order to

maintain the same torque to pick up the load slip increases or speed decreases. Hence, the motor 
draws extra current from the supply mains which may overheat the motor. If the motor is operated 
continuously under this condition, it may burn.

To draw the torque-slip or torque-speed curve the following points are considered:
(i) At synchronous speed (Ns); slip, S = 0 and torque T = 0.
(ii) When rotor speed is very near to synchronous speed i.e., when the slip is very low the value of 
the term (SX2s)2 is very small in comparison to R2
2 [i.e., (SX2s)2 < < R2
2)] and is neglected.
Therefore, torque is given by the expression;
T = 3

= KS, or T v S
Thus, at low values of slip, torque is approximately proportional to slip S and the torque-slip 
curve is a straight line, as shown in Fig. 9.22.
Fig. 9.22 Torque-slip curve
(iii) As the slip increases torque increases and attains its maximum value when S = R2/X2s. This 
maximum value of torque is also known as break down or pull out torque.
(iv) With further increase in slip due to increase in load beyond the point of maximum 
torque i.e., when slip is high, the value of term (SX2s)2 is very large in comparison to R2
2
[i.e., (SX2s)2 >> R2
2]. Therefore, R2
2 is neglected as compared to (SX2s)2 and the torque is given 
by the expression.

Thus, at higher value of slip (i.e., the slip beyond that corresponding to maximum torque), torque 
is approximately inversely proportional to slip S and the torque-slip curve is a rectangular hyperbola, 
as shown in Fig. 9.22.
Thus, with the increase of slip beyond the point of maximum torque, due to increase in load, torque 
decrease. The result is that the motor could not pick-up the load and slows down and eventually stops. 
This results in blocked rotor or short circuited motor.
9.30 Torque-speed Curve and Operating Region
The torque-speed curve of an induction motor is shown in Fig. 9.23. It is the same curve which is 
already drawn, the only difference is that speed is taken on the abscissa instead of slip.
From the curve, it is clear that induction motor develops the same torque at point X and Y. However 
at point X the motor is unstable because with the increase in load speed decreases and the torque 
developed by the motor also decreases. Therefore, the motor could not pick up the load and the result 
is that the motor slows down and eventually stops. The miniature circuit breakers will be tripped 
open if the circuit has been so protected.
At point Y, the motor is stable because in this region with the increase in load speed decreases 
but the torque developed by the motor increases. Thus the motor will be in position to pick up the 
extra load effectively.
Thus, on the torque-speed curve region BC is the unstable region and region AB is the stable 
or operating region of the induction motor as shown in Fig. 9.23.
Fig. 9.23 Torque-speed curve
9.31 Effect of Rotor Resistance on Torque-slip Curve
To see the effect of rotor resistance on torque-slip curve, consider a slip ring induction motor in which 
additional resistance in the rotor circuit can be introduced through slip rings. The rotor reactance 
X2s remains constant.
It has already been seen that maximum value of the torque developed by an induction motor is 
independent of rotor resistance R2, but is inversely proportional to rotor standstill reactance X2s. 
Therefore, the effect of change in rotor resistance will change the value of slip at which this maximum

torque occurs; Greater the rotor resistance, greater the value of slip at which the maximum torque 
occurs since

The torque-slip curves are shown in Fig. 9.24. for various values of rotor resistance R2 keeping

Fig. 9.24 Torque-slip curves with addition of various external resistors
The maximum value of the torque can be obtained even at the start by adding that much resistance 
in the rotor circuit so that R2 becomes equal to X2s.
The following important points may be noted from the above discussions:
(i) The maximum torque developed by an induction motor remains constant since it is independent 
of the rotor resistance.
(ii) The slip at which maximum torque occurs varies with the variation of the rotor resistance.
(iii) The starting torque increased with the increase in the value of rotor resistance.
(iv) The maximum torque is obtained at the start when rotor resistance is made equal to rotor 
reactance at standstill i.e., R2 = X2s

9.32 Constant and Variable Losses in an Induction Motor
Various losses which occur in an induction motor during energy conversions are given below:
(i) Constant losses 
(ii) Variable losses.
(i) Constant losses: The losses which are independent of the load and remain constant irrespective 
of the load variation are called constant losses. These losses may be:
(a) Core losses: These include hysteresis and eddy current losses in stator as well as in rotor 
core. Eddy current losses in rotor core is negligible since rotor current frequency is very 
small of the order of 0·5 to 2 Hz. These losses are constant or fixed losses since these depend 
upon voltage and frequency which is practically constant.
(b) Friction and windage losses: These losses are also constant as these losses depend upon the 
speed of the induction motor. The speed of induction motor is approximately constant (for 
normal running, slip is very small). These losses occur in the machine because of power loss 
due to friction at the bearings and to overcome wind resistance. Additional sliding friction 
loss occur in the slip ring induction motor.
(ii) Variable losses: The losses which depend on the load and change with the variation in load 
are called variable losses. These losses are:
(a) I2R loss in stator winding.
(b) I2 R loss in rotor winding.
There losses occur due to the resistance of stator winding as well as resistance of rotor 
winding. This loss is also called copper loss. It is proportional to the square of the current 
following in the stator as well as in rotor winding.
(c) Brush contact loss: This loss occurs only in slip ring induction motors. This is occurring 
because of contact resistance between brushes and slip rings. Its magnitude is very small 
since contact resistance is made minimum.
(iii) Stray losses: These losses are occurring in iron as well winding of the machine. These cannot 
be determined exactly but are accounted for when the efficiency of the machine is calculated, 
by suitable factor.

9.33 Main Tests Performed on an Induction Motor
To determine losses, power factor, efficiency and other characteristics of an induction motor various 
tests viz stator resistance test, no-load test, blocked rotor test, heat run etc., are performed on an 
induction motor
9.33.1 Stator Resistance Test
This test is performed to determine the resistance of stator winding. In this test, resistance between two 
terminals of the stator winding is measured by voltmeter-ammeter method using DC supply as shown 
in Fig. 9.25 this gives the resistance of two phases in series. To obtain the resistance of each phase, 
the measured value is divided by 2. Let the resistance measured between two terminal be Rc, where
Rc = voltmeter reading (V)
ammeter reading (I)
Resistance of each phase, R = R¢
2
Fig. 9.25 Circuit for stator resistance test
To obtain more accurate results, the resistance may be measured between terminals 1-2,2-3 and 
3-1 as Rc1, Rc2, Rc3,respectively. Then their average value is considered i.e., Rc=
¢ +

. Since 
the effective AC resistance is higher than the DC resistance, the average value Rc is multiplied by a 
is multiplied by 1.2 to obtain the effective value.
Hence, Winding resistance/phase, R = 1.2 Rc
9.33.2 Voltage-ratio Test
This test can only be performed on a phase-wound induction motors. While performing this test, 
brushes are lifted from the slip-rings and stator is excited by 3-phase AC supply through a 3-phase 
variac at normal frequency. The ratio of rotor to stator voltage can be measured by means of voltmeters 
connected on the both sides, as shown in Fig. 9.26. to obtain more accurate results, various reading 
across different phases near to rated voltages are taken and the average value is considered.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
767
Fig. 9.26 Circuit for voltage ratio test
In this case, it may be noted that the rotor current frequency is the same as that of the supply 
frequency since the rotor is stationary.
9.33.3 No-load Test
This test, as the name indicate, is performed on induction motor when it is running without load. 
This test tells us the magnitude of constant losses occurring in the motor.
The machine is started in the usual way and runs without load at normal voltage. On the stator 
side, suitable instruments are connected between supply mains and motor terminals to measure 
power, line current and line voltage. as shown in Fig. 9.27. For power and power factor measurement 
wattmeter readings W1 and W2 are taken keeping the switch S1 at stud-1 and then at stud-2. Since 
motor is running without load, p.f. of the motor is low (less than 0·5), so once the wattmeter will 
give down-scale reading. To obtain up-scale reading, the connections of the potential coil of the 
wattmeter are reversed by changing the position of switch-2 from stud-1 to stud-2, but the reading 
is considered as negative. 
Fig. 9.27 Circuit diagram for no-load test

768
Electrical Machines
Total power drawn by the motor is then the difference of the two wattmeter readings. The readings 
of wattmeters are taken with various values of applied voltage and then curve is plotted against power 
and input voltage. From this curve windage and friction losses are determined.
Since motor is at no-load the input power supplied to the motor is utilised to meet with the losses 
only. Losses are occurring in iron core of the stator as well as rotor which are called core losses. 
Small amount of copper loss is also occurring in stator winding. This can be neglected since stator 
current is very small. Therefore, total power is the sum of rotor iron loss + copper loss in stator + 
friction and windage loss. The readings noted at normal voltage and at rated frequency are considered 
to find out the fixed core losses.
Fig. 9.28 Curve between applied voltage and power input to the motor at no-load
The procedure to separate the various losses is given below:
Total power measured by two readings of the wattmeter = P0= (W1– W2-) watt,
Copper losses in stator winding = 3I0
2R1
where I0 is the no-load current measured by ammeter at normal voltage and rated frequency of supply 
and R1 is the stator winding resistance per phase. and V

is the applied 
voltage per phase.
?
Total constant losses = (P0 – 3I0
2R1) watt
Now to determine the friction and windage losses the curve drawn between applied voltage and 
input power is extended till it cuts the vertical axis. The point where it intersects the vertical axis, 
represent the losses at zero applied voltage. When applied voltage is zero the core losses and stator 
copper losses are zero. Therefore, power input at no-load and zero voltage represents the windage 
and friction losses. Other calculation is given below:

9.33.4 Blocked Rotor Test
This test is performed by locking the rotor (by holding the rotor not to rotate). This is carried out to 
know the copper loss at short circuit, power factor at short circuit and total equivalent resistance 
and reactance of the motor referred to stator side. This test is just equivalent to short circuit test of 
a transformer.
Keeping switch S1and S2 at stud-1 and starting with zero voltage across the stator, the applied 
voltage is gradually increased in steps till motor draws the full-load current. The readings of voltmeter, 
ammeter and wattmeters are noted. the wattmeter reading is taken as W1 it is again noted by changing 
the position of switch S2 from stud-1 to stud-2 and recorded as W2. While performing this test the 
following points are taken care of.
1. The mechanism used to hold (or block) the rotor should be of proper strength.
2. The direction of rotation of rotor should be established prior to start the test. And direction of 
force which is to keep the rotor blocked (unmoved) should be in opposite direction.
3. As the windings get heated while performing the test, therefore this test should be carried out 
quickly.
4. The short circuit current should not be allowed to rise more than one and half times the full 
load current.

In case of phase wound motors, the stator and rotor winding resistances per phase can be measured

The equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. 9.31.
The total power input to motor when rotor is locked is absorbed as total copper losses in the motor 
as well as small iron losses (usually neglected). The iron losses are small since small voltage only 10 
to 15% of normal voltage is applied to circulate full load current in the motor.
?
Psc = total Cu loss in motor.
If 
Isc = full load current of motor then Psc is total copper loss on full load.
9.33.5 Heat Run Test
When a motor is operated at load, it is heated-up due to various losses which occur in different parts 
of the machine. Maximum temperature is obtained by the machine at a certain load. The life of the 
winding insulation depends upon the temperature.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
771
Therefore, this test is performed on the motor to check the rise in temperature which must remain 
with-in the prescribed limits.
The prescribed limits depend upon the type of insulation material used and the duty cycle of the 
motor. The temperature is measured both while the motor is operating and after it is shut-down. The 
motor should be stopped as soon as the motor attains the thermal equilibrium.
Example 9.29

9.34 Equivalent Circuit of an Induction Motor
It is seen that when stator winding of a 3-phase induction motor is connected to 3-phase supply, the 
rotor circuit being closed (or short circuited), torque is developed and rotor rotates. Thus, energy 
is transferred from stator winding to rotor winding through magnetic flux. Therefore, an induction 
motor is similar to a transformer with a rotating secondary. The induction motor may be viewed as 
shown in Fig. 9.32. where per phase values have been considered.
Fig. 9.32 Induction motor circuit 
This circuit can be further represented as shown in Fig. 9.33. Here, stator and rotor winding is shown 
just as it is the primary and secondary of a transformer.

9.37 Circle Diagram
The performance of an induction motor can be studied, at a glance, with the help of its circle diagram. 
The construction of a circle diagram is based on the simple equation of a circle.
To understand it more clearly, consider an RL series circuit, as shown in Fig. 9.38. The circuit is 
fed at constant voltage V. It contains a constant reactance X but a variable resistance R.

The equation (i) represents the equation of a circle in polar from having diameter (V/X). Such a 
circle is shown in Fig. 9.39 (a). While drawing this circle the magnitude of the current and power 
factor angle are taken as polar co-ordinates of the point A.
The circuit represents the locus of point A which is the extreme point of vector OA= 1 since, R is 
variable, its magnitude varies which also changes the phase angle I

) is such a way that point A lies on the circle having diameter equal to V/X 
(constant value). Usually, for lagging power factors, the circle diagrams are drawn by taking diameter 
on horizontal position (X-axis) and voltage vector on vertical (Y-axis) position, as shown in Fig. 9.39 
(b). All relations are true for both the positions.

9.38 Circle Diagram for the Approximate Equivalent Circuit of an 
Induction Motor
The approximate equivalent circuit of an induction motor is shown in Fig. 9.40. It clearly shows that 
the circuit beyond (on the right hand side of) point ab is similar to an RL series circuit having constant 
input voltage V and reactance Xeq1 but the value of resistance varies depending upon the slip (or load).
Fig. 9.40 Simplified equivalent circuit of an induction motor
Hence, the extreme point A of the current vector I1c i.e., rotor current referred to the stator side, 
will lie on a circle with a diameter of V/Xeq1 (i.e., OB) as shown in Fig. 9.41, this is the rotor current 
referred to the stator side. When I1c is lagging and I2 = 90° then position of vector for I1c will be 
along OB i.e., at right angles to vertical axis OY.
I0 is the no-load current which is the vector sum of Iw and Imag. If it is assumed that exciting 
resistance Ro and exciting reactance X0 as constant, then I0 and cos Io will be constant.

9.39 Construction of a Circle Diagram for an Induction Motor
The circle diagram of an induction motor may be drawn by using the data obtained from (i) stator 
resistance test, (ii) no-load test and (iii) blocked rotor test. From stator resistance test, the stator 
winding resistance per phase R1 is determined.
From no-load test, the phase voltage V V

¯˜ and short circuit phase angle ISC are determined.
From this data, a circle diagram for an induction motor is drawn by taking the following steps:
1. Draw the voltage phasor OV along y-axis.
2. Choose a convenient scale for current and draw a line OOc = I0 at an angle of I0 with phasor 
OV.
3. Draw a line OX perpendicular to voltage phasor OV. Also draw a line OcX from Oc parallel to 
line OX.
4. From O draw a line OA equal to blocked rotor current ISN corresponding to normal rated voltage, 
with the same scale used for I0, lagging behind voltage vector OV by an angle ISC. Then phasor 
OcA will represent the rotor current referred to stator side i.e.,I2c. The line OcA is known as output 
line.
5. It is obvious that both point Oc and A will lie on the circle. To determine the centre of circle C, 
divide the line OcA equally. Extend the dividing line on both sides and the point where it meets 
the line OcXc that will be the centre C of the circle (see Fig. 9.42).
6. Taking C as centre and COc as radius, draw a semicircle OcAB.
7. Draw vertical lines OcP and AQ from Oc and A respectively parallel to Y-axis or voltage vector 
OV.

784
Electrical Machines
Fig. 9.42 Circle diagram for an induction motor
It may be noted that all the vertical distances represent the active or power components of current 
since they are in phase with the voltage vector OV. Accordingly, OcP represents working component 
of no-load current (i.e., OcP = OOc cos IO = I0 cos IO = ,w); otherwise it represents no-load input 
which includes core losses, friction and windage losses and very small amount of stator copper loss. 
Similarly, AQ i.e., vertical component of OA is proportional to motor input on short circuit which 
includes rotor copper loss, stator copper and fixed losses i.e.,stator iron loss and mechanical loss.
Where FQ = OcP = Stator iron loss + windage and friction loss
AE = rotor copper loss
EF = stator copper loss
The rotor and stator copper losses are represented by the torque line OcE and ‘Ec is located as 
follows:

resistance test. Then

9.40 Results Obtainable from Circle Diagram
Let us assume that the motor is drawing a current of I1 ampere at any load. Draw an arc with radius 
OL = I1 with O as its centre. From L, draw a line LM parallel to y-axis, as shown in Fig. 9.42 which 
intersects various lines at points N,K and J. Then JM represents fixed losses, JK as stator copper loss, 
KN as rotor copper loss, KL as rotor input, Nl as rotor output and LM as total motor input.
Various analysis can be done by using the following relations:
1. Motor input = 3V (LM) watt 
2. Fixed losses = 3V (JM) watt
3. Stator Cu loss = 3V (JK) watt 
4. Rotor Cu loss = 3V (NK) watt
5. Total losses = 3V (NM) watt 
6. Mech. power developed = 3V (NL) watt

9.41 Maximum Quantities
The maximum quantities can be determined from the circle diagram shown in Fig. 9.43, as mentioned 
below:
Fig. 9.43 Maximum quantities on a circle diagram
1. Maximum output: From centre point C drop a perpendicular on output line OcA and extend it 
to meet the circle at R. From R draw a vertical line intersecting the output line OcA at S. Then 
maximum output is represent by RS, such that 

786
Electrical Machines
Maximum output = 3 V (RS) watt.
2. Maximum torque or rotor input: From centre point C drop a perpendicular on torque line OcE 
and extend it to meet the circle at U. From U draw a vertical line intersecting the torque line 
OcE at W. Then maximum torque is represent by UW, such that 
Maximum torque = 3 V ( UW
w
) Nm
3. Maximum input power: Draw a vertical line parallel to y-axis passing through the centre of 
circle C. It intersects the circle at D and the x-axis at Z. The point D where the tangent to the 
circle is horizontal represents the maximum input power which is proportional to DZ, such that
Maximum power = 3V (DZ) watt. 
But the motor will be unstable here since the point D occur beyond the point of maximum torque 
U. However, maximum input indicates the ability of the motor to carry short-time over loads. Usually. 
the maximum input power is 2 to 3 times the rated power.
9.42 Significance of Some Lines in the Circle Diagram
Although, many lines have been drawn in the circle diagram but some of them (given below) are 
important and have special significance.
1. Input line OX: The vertical distance between any point on the circle and this line represents 
the input power and hence called input line.
2. Output line OcA: The vertical distance between any point on the circle and this line represents 
the output power and hence called output line.
3. Torque line or Air-gap power line OcE: Since KL represents mechanical power developed in 
the rotor i.e., air-gap power, the line OcE is called torque line or air-gap power line.

The following readings were obtained when no-load and blocked rotor tests were performed on a

9.43 Effect of Space Harmonies
While discussing the performance of an induction motor, so far, it is assumed that the flux in the 
air-gap is distributed sinusoidally which produces a revolving field which rotates at synchronous 
speed in space. But in actual practice, it is not so. Either line harmonics or space harmonics are 
there to affect the torque.
These harmonics may have components that rotate at speeds other than that correspond to the 
fundamental frequency.
The time harmonic voltages are usually small in comparison to fundamental voltages, moreover 
the motor reactance to the time harmonics is high and consequently the torques developed by these 
harmonies are very small. Thus, the performance of an induction motor is not much affected by 
time harmonics.
However, the space harmonic fields are developed by the windings, slotting, magnetic saturation 
and irregularity in air-gap length. These harmonic fields induce emfs which circulate harmonic 
currents in the rotor windings. These harmonic currents interact with the harmonic fields and develop 
harmonic torques which produce vibrations and noise.
With certain relationship between the number of pole, stator and rotor slots in cage motors peculiar 
behaviour may be observed when the motor is started.
9.43.1 Cogging in Three-phase Induction Motors
In an induction motor, the magnetic circuit is completed through stator and rotor. It is the tendency 
of a magnetic circuit to align itself in a position of minimum reluctance. Thus, if the number of stator 
slots is equal to the number of rotor slots, there exists a position of minimum reluctance when the 
teeth of rotor and stator are aligned opposite to each other. The radial alignment forces become very 
strong when the machine is at rest and rotor and stator teeth are aligned. These forces may exceed 
the tangential forces of acceleration thereby preventing the motor from starting.
Thus, the phenomenon by which the radial alignment forces exceed the tangential accelerating 
forces and the machine (induction motor) refuses to start is called cogging.
Due to cogging, the rotor of induction motor is locked which may overheat the motor winding.
To avoid cogging the number of rotor slots are never made equal to the number of stator slots. 
Moreover, the rotor is always skewed for smooth running of the rotor.
9.43.2 Crawling in Three-phase Induction Motors
In a three-phase induction motor, the fundamental frequency produces the synchronous torque due 
to which rotor starts rotating at its rated speed. However, in the induction motors, harmonics are 
developed out of which 5th and 7th harmonics are more important. These harmonics generate rotor 
emfs, currents and torques of the same general torque/speed shape as that of the fundamental but with 
synchronous speeds 1/5th (backward) and 1/7th (forward) of the fundamental synchronous speed.
The 7th harmonic torque reaches its maximum value just before 1/7th of synchronous speed, but 
beyond this speed the 7th harmonic torque becomes negative since the slip in the harmonic field is 
negative. The resultant torque-speed curve combined with 7th harmonic and fundamental frequency 
is shown in Fig. 9.48. Torque due to harmonic flux causes dip in the torque-speed characteristics.

796
Electrical Machines
Fig. 9.48 Effect of harmonics on starting torque of an induction motor
When dip in the torque occur due to 7th harmonic and is insufficient to pick the load, the motor 
can not accelerate to its full speed but starts crawling at the speed corresponding to point ‘a ’.
Thus, when a 3-phase induction motor continues to rotor at a speed little lower than the 1/7th 
synchronous speed, it is said to be crawling.
Such operation of a motor is unstable, a momentary reduction in load may permit the motor to 
accelerate to the rated speed. In fact, the crawling effect can be eliminated by proper choice of coil 
pitch and distribution of coils while designing the winding. This reduces the harmonic flux in the 
air gap to very low value. 
9.44 Performance Curves of Induction Motors
The behaviour of an induction motor at different loads is different. The graphical representation of 
various quantities of an induction motor with respect to its output represents its performance curve.
1. Speed-output characteristics: The speed–output (or slip-output) characteristics of a 3-phase 
induction motor are shown in Fig. 9.49. It shows that the speed of the motor decreases slightly 
from no-load to full-load but slip increases. Hence, it is almost a constant speed motor, similar 
to a DC shunt motor.
2. Power factor characteristics: The power factor–output characteristics of a 3-phase induction 
motor are shown in Fig. 9.49. At no-load, motor draws magnetising current Imag which is very 
large component due to high reluctance of the air-gap and no-load current Io lags behind the 
voltage by a large angle and thus power factor of the motor is very low at no-load. As the load 
increases, motor draws more current from the supply to meet with the load and the percentage 
of magnetising current component decreases with respect to the total load current drawn by the 
motor and thus power factor improves and goes on improving with the load, as shown in Fig. 
9.49.

Fig. 9.50 Performance Curves of a 3-phase, 50 Hz squirrel cage motor

798
Electrical Machines
Under operating conditions, at any load, there are certain fixed losses (such as iron losses and 
mechanical loss) and variable losses i.e., stator and copper losses which vary as square of the 
load. At light loads, fixed losses are more in comparison to variable losses whereas, at heavy 
loads (near to full load) variable losses are more in comparison to fixed losses. But at certain load 
fixed losses are equal to variable loss. At this load the efficiency of the machine is maximum.
Thus, at light loads efficiency in low but increases rapidly in the earlier stages becomes maximum 
and then again decreases as shown in Fig. 9.50.
4. Stator current characteristics: The stator current–output characteristics of a 3-phase induction 
motor are shown in Fig. 9.20. At no-load, motor drawn current to meet with the losses and to 
set-up magnetic field in the core and air-gap which is nearly 20 to 30% of full-load which may 
be more for small motors. When load on an induction motor increases, slip decreases and motor 
drawn extra current from the mains. Because of high value of magnetising current this curve 
is not a straight line curve.
9.45 Factors Governing Performance of Induction Motors
The performance or characteristics of an induction motor are governed by its
(i) Rotor resistance, (ii) air-gap length (iii) shape of stator and rotor slots and teeth. 
(i) Rotor resistance: Smaller value of rotor resistance improves the efficiency of the motor but the 
starting torque becomes very poor. To improve the starting torque rotor resistance cannot be 
increased in squirrel cage rotors. Hence these motors have poor starting torque. But in case of 
slip ring induction motors, an external resistance is added at the start to improve the starting 
torque.
(ii) Air-gap length: Larger the air-gap, larger will be the magnetising current and poor will be the 
power factor of the motor. Therefore, efforts are made to reduce the air-gap between stator 
and rotor, but mechanical difficulties may not allow us to reduce the air-gap to large extent. 
Moreover, very small air-gap may increase the noise and reduces the over-load capacity of the 
motor.
(iii) Shape of stator and rotor slots and teeth: The shapes of the rotor teeth and slots affect the rotor 
reactance which in turn affects the starting current and maximum torque developed by the motor. 
For deep and narrow slots rotor reactance is high, consequently the maximum torque developed 
by the motor will be low. Therefore, semi-closed slots cut near the periphery are preferred.
9.46 High Starting Torque Cage Motors
Three-phase squirrel-cage induction motors are invariably used in the industrial applications 
because of their valuable characteristics such as robustness, simple and low cost of construction, low 
maintenance and high efficiency. However, these motors suffer from the drawback of poor starting 
torque. Starting torque of an induction motor can be increased by increasing the rotor resistance at the 
start which is possible in case of slip-ring induction motors. The rotor resistance of the squirrel cage 
induction motor is fixed since their cages are short circuited. If their rotor resistance is increased by 

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
799
designing their rotor circuit, then their efficiency would become very poor under running conditions. 
However, two types of rotors i.e., deep bar rotors and double cage rotors with short circuited cages 
are suggested to improve the starting torque without affecting the efficiency of the motor.
9.46.1 Deep Bar Cage Rotor Motors 
A deep bar cage rotor is a rotor which carries deep bar conductors i.e.,its bar conductors are 20 to 
25 mm high with a depth to width ratio of 10:1 or 12:1, as shown in Fig. 9.51 (a). 
In deep bar cage rotor motors, skin effect is dominating factor to increase the rotor resistance 
at the start to obtain higher starting torque. Let us see how this skin effect occurs in deep bar cage 
rotor motors.
Fig. 9.51 Magnetic flux and current distribution in a deep bar cage rotor conductors
Consider a slot and conductor of a deep bar rotor. At the start, the rotor current frequency in equal 
to supply frequency. The flux will be set-up around the rotor conductions as shown in Fig. 9.51 (a). 
the concentration of magnetic field is more in the lower part than the upper.
Therefore, more emf is induced in the lower part of the bar conductor than the upper part. This 
result is more current to flow in the upper part than the lower. The current density in the conductor 
is depicted as shown in Fig. 9.51 (b). This effect is called skin effect. The non-uniform current 
distribution causes greater ohmic loss. Thus, the apposition offered by conductor increases at the 
start. The AC resistance is substantially high (Rac >> Rdc). As a result, the starting torque increases 
and the starting current decreases.
Once motor picks up speed, the frequency of rotor currents decreases to the values corresponding 
to steady state operating conditions. The skin effect gradually diminishes and current is distributed 
uniformly over the area of cross-section of the conductor as shown by the dotted line -2, in Fig. 
9.51 (b). Thus, the resistance of the rotor gradually decreases and becomes normal under operating 
conditions.

800
Electrical Machines
Thus, in these motors, high starting torque with lesser starting current is obtained without losing 
the efficiency of the motor. However, in this case the rotor reactance will be high as compared to 
the normal cage motor because of more leakage flux. Hence, the maximum torque obtained by these 
motors will be smaller. It reduces the over-load capacity. of the motor. Moreover, the power factor 
of these motors is also reduced.

The cut-away view of a deep-bar rotor is shown in Fig. 9.52. For comparison, the torque-speed 
characteristics of squirrel cage induction motor with normal bar rotor, high resistance-bar rotor and 
deep-bar rotor are shown in Fig. 9.53.
Fig. 9.53 Torque-speed characteristics of low- resistance and beep-bar rotor motor
9.46.2 Double Cage Induction Motor
The rotor design of a double squirrel cage induction motor is somewhat expensive than deep-bar rotor 
design but it provides better starting and running characteristics. The rotor of this motor is so designed 
that it provides a high starting torque (200 to250 percent) with a low starting current (restricting to 
400 to 600 percent of full-load value). The major advantage of this design is that a high resistance 

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
801
rotor circuit comes into action during starting and a low resistance rotor circuit during running which 
improves the efficiency of motor during normal running conditions.
Construction
A double cage induction motor consists of a rotor which has two independent cages one above the 
other in the same slot. A double cage rotor is shown in Fig. 9.54. The upper slot conductors form the 
outer cage and the lower slot conductors form the inner cage. The outer cage consists of bars of high 
resistance (resistance of outer cage in nearly 5 to 6 times the resistance of inner cage), generally bars 
of brass alloy of smaller area of cross-section, are employed. The inner cage consists of bars of low 
resistance, generally bars of copper metal of larger area of cross section, are employed. Since the 
inner cage is embedded deep in the iron, it has relatively more leakage flux as shown in Fig. 9.55 
and has high reactance.
Thus, the outer cage has high resistance and low reactance whereas, the inner cage has low 
resistance and high reactance. A slit is provided between upper and lower slot so that it offers high 
reluctance for the stator field. Thus the stator field instead of linking with only outer cage, links both 
the cages simultaneously. 
Fig. 9.54 Double-cage rotor conductors
Fig. 9.55 Rotor flux distribution
Operation
To study the operation of a double-cage induction motor, the following points must be kept in mind:
1. Since the maximum torque produced by each cage is independent of their resistance but is 
inversely proportional to their stand still reactance. Therefore, the value of the maximum torque 
developed by the inner cage is more than the outer cage as shown in Fig. 9.56.
2. At start, the rotor current frequency is equal to the supply frequency, therefore, the reactances 
(2S f L) of the two cages are high as compared to their resistances. The divisions of the rotor 
current between the cages is determined by their relative impedance (reactance). Therefore, at 
start, comparatively a small current flows through inner cage bars while a large current flows 
through the outer cage in spite of its high resistance.
Thus, at start the torque is mainly produced by the outer cage as shown in Fig. 9.56.

802
Electrical Machines
3. As the motor picks up speed, the rotor current frequency decreases and is very low at rated 
speed. Under this condition the reactance of the two cages are very low as compared to their 
resistances. Therefore, the division of the rotor current between the cages is determined by their 
relative resistance and most of the current flows through the inner cage while a small current 
flows through the outer cage.
Thus, under normal running condition, the torque is mainly produced by the inner cage as 
shown in Fig. 9.56.
The torque-speed curves of outer and inner cages as well as double cage induction motor are 
shown in Fig. 9.56 separately.

9.47 Motor Enclosures 
Various types of enclosure of the motor have been designed to protect the windings, bearings, and 
other mechanical parts from moisture, chemicals, mechanical damage and abrasion from grit.

808
Electrical Machines
NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) has suggested 7 Most Common Motor 
Enclosure. These types are defined by NEMA Standards. 
Under the categories of open machines, totally enclosed machines and with sealed windings, more 
than 20 types of enclosures have been defined in NEMA standards MG1-1.25 to 1.27. Out of which 
the 7 most common types of enclosures are:
1. Open Drip Proof (ODP) Enclosure 
An open Drip Proof (ODP) enclosure for a premium efficient super-E motor is shown in Fig. 9.61. 
This enclosure prevents the liquid drops to enter the motor when they fall with 15 degree angle from 
the vertical but it allows air to circulate through the internal winding for cooling. These enclosures 
are typically used for indoor applications in relatively clean, dry locations.
Fig. 9.61
Open Drip Proof (ODP) Enclosure 
Fig. 9.62 Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled 
(TEFC) Enclosure 
2. Totally Enclosed Fan Cooled (TEFC) Enclosure
The NEMA Premium Efficiency – Three Phase TEFC Enclosure Motor is shown in Fig. 9.62.
This enclosure prevents the free exchange of air between the inside and outside of the frame, 
but the frame is not made completely air-tight. To increase the cooling efficiency, a fan is attached 
to the motor shaft which circulates the air during operation. Ribs or fins are attached on the frame 
to increase the surface area which further improves cooling. These enclosures are more versatile 
and are used with motors for pumps, fans, compressors, general industrial belt drive and direct 
connected equipment.
3. Totally Enclosed Non-Ventilated (TENV) Enclosure
A1/2 HP, 3-Phase, 1140 RPM Motor with Totally Enclosed Non-Ventilated (TENV) Enclosure is shown 
in Fig. 9.63. It is almost similar to a TEFC enclosure but in these enclosures, fan is not employed and 
heat is dissipated only by convection. It is a tightly enclosed enclosure hence prevents free exchange 
of air. Although, no vent is provided in the enclosure but it is not air-tight

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
809
These are suitable for uses which are exposed to dirt or dampness, but not very moist or hazardous 
(explosive) locations.

4. Totally Enclosed Air Over (TEAO) Enclosure
A1/3 HP, 24 V DC, 1800 RPM Motor with Totally Enclosed Air Over (TEAO) Enclosure is shown 
in Fig. 9.64.
Dust-tight fan and blower duty motors designed for shaft mounted fans or belt driven fans. The 
motor must be mounted within the airflow of the fan.
5. Totally Enclosed Wash Down (TEWD) Enclosure 
A Motor with Totally Enclosed Wash Down (TEAO) Enclosure is shown in Fig. 9.65.
The Washdown Duty Motors are used for food processing, packaging, pharmaceuticals, or in the 
applications where motors are regularly exposed to high pressure washdown. While designing these 
enclosures one must take care of high wash-down pressure, humidity and wet environment. Various 
enclosures have been designed for such (wet) conditions.

Electrical Machines
6. Explosion-proof Enclosures (EXPL)
A Motor with Explosion-proof enclosures (EXPL) is shown in Fig. 9.66.
The Explosion-proof enclosure (EXPL) motors are used in chemical plants, the oil industry, in gas 
works, wood and plastic processing industry or in agriculture. Where there is hazardous environment, 
the enclosure of explosion proof motors is designed in such a way that it can withstand heavy pressures 
built inside the motor. However, if pressure is built-up more than the designed value that must be 
released through the safety valve and switch off the supply simultaneously.
These motors are designed for specific hazardous purposes, such as atmospheres containing 
gases or hazardous dusts. For safe operation, the maximum motor operating temperature must be 
kept below the ignition temperature of surrounding gases or vapours.
Explosion proof motors are designed, manufactured and tested for particular requirements.
7. Hazardous Location (HAZ) Enclosures
3-Phase, 5 HP Motor with Hazardous Location (HAZ) Enclosure is shown in Fig. 9.67. It meets with 
the requirements of National Electrical Code for Hazardous Locations.
Fig. 9.67 Explosion-proof enclosures (EXPL) motor
These motors are used to operate Power Fans, Blowers, Pumps or Air Compressors in the hazardous 
locations. 
While selecting the enclosure and motor, the environment of the location is determined and 
accordingly the specific material is used for the enclosure so that the enclosure’s strength may not 
deteriorate.
The format used to define this information is a class, group, division and temperature code structure 
as defined by the National Electric Code (NFPA-70).
9.48 Standard Types of Squirrel Cage Motor
With the slight variation in design as per the need, the squirrel cage induction motors have been 
standardised. According to their electric characteristics and design, these are designated as design 
A, B, C, D, E and F.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
811
The commercial simple squirrel-cage induction motor with shallow slots are designated as class 
A. These motors are considered to have normal slip and hence used as reference.
9.48.1 Class A Motors
Normal starting torque, normal starting current, normal slip.
Characteristics
x Have relatively normal (low) resistance and normal (low) reactance
x Rotor slots are semi-closed cut near the periphery to have small reactance.
x At rated voltage, the locked rotor current is generally more than 6 times the rated full-load current.
x For the machines having smaller sizes and number of poles, at rated voltage, the starting torque 
is twice the full-load torque
x For the machines having larger sizes and number of poles, at rated voltage, the starting torque 
is 1.1 times the full-load torque.
x Full-load slip is less than 5%.
Applications
These motors can pick-up low inertia loads very quickly and can be started and stopped frequently 
therefore, these are generally used for fans, pumps and conveyors etc.
9.48.2 Class B Motors
Normal starting torque, normal starting current, normal slip.
Characteristics
x Have deep and narrow bars (see Fig. 9.62) therefore offer high reactance at start.
x Can be started at full-load. Then it draws relatively low starting current but develops normal 
starting torque.
x Generally, locked-rotor current draws 5 to 6 times the full-load current at rated voltage..
x Full-load slip is less than 6%.
Applications
These motors can pick-up almost full-load while developing normal starting torque with relatively low 
starting current and best suited for compressors, heavy fans having high, machine tool applications 
centrifugal pumps etc.
9.48.3 Class C Motors
High starting torque, low starting current, normal slip.

812
Electrical Machines
Characteristics
x Have two separate cages and are called double squirrel-cage motors (see Fig. 9.63).
x Locked-rotor current with rated voltage is generally 5 to 6 times the full-load current as in 
case of class-B motors.
x Starting torque with rated voltage is usually 2.75 times the full-load torque.
x Full-load slip is normal less than 6%.
Applications
These motors develop high torque at start nearly 2.75 times the full-load torque with low starting 
current at rated voltage. Therefore, these are best suited to pick heavy loads at start and are generally 
used for crushers, compression pumps, large refrigerators, conveyors, textile industry, boring mills 
and wood working equipment.
9.48.4 Class D Motors
High starting torque, low starting current, high slip
Characteristics
x Have relatively high resistance to obtain high starting torque with low starting current.
x The bar conductors of the cage have relatively smaller area of cross-section to obtain high 
resistance. These conductors are located very near the periphery to have low leakage reactance.
x Locked-rotor current with rated voltage is generally 5 to 6 times the full-load current similar 
to class-C.
x Full-load slip varies from 5 to 20%, depending upon the application.
Applications
These motor have the ability to develop extremely high torque at start, therefore, these are best suited 
for shearing machines, pinching processes, stamping machines, bulldozers, laundry equipment and 
metal drawing equipment.
9.48.5 Class E Motors
Low starting torque, low starting current, low slip
Characteristics
x Have relatively very low resistance accordingly have low starting torque and low reactance. 
x Locked-rotor current with normal rated voltage is generally 8 to 10 times the rated full-load 
current, for larger sizes it may be more than this even.
x Their power factor and efficiency is relatively high.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
813
Applications
These motor have low resistance and operate at higher power factor and efficiency, therefore, best 
suited for continuous running such as exhaust fans.
9.48.6 Class F Motors
Low starting torque, low starting current, normal slip
Characteristics
x Have relatively low resistance and to reduce the starting current, rotor reactance is made 
very high by embedding the rotor bar conductors deep in the slots for increasing the leakage 
flux.
x Locked-rotor current with rated voltage is generally 5–6 times the rated full-load current.
x The starting torque with full voltage is only 1.25 times the full-load torque.
x Full-load slip less than 6% depending upon the load.
9.49 Advantages and Disadvantages of Induction Motors
9.49.1 Squirrel Cage Induction Motors
Advantages
1. Cost of construction is low comparatively.
2. These motors are rugged in construction and mechanically robust.
3. Copper losses in cage rotor are low hence, their efficiency in high.
4. There is no overhang of rotor winding hence, their length is smaller.
5. Slip-rungs and brushes are not used, therefore, their maintenance cost is low and there is no 
risk of sparking.
6. These can be cooled down comfortably by using large fans on the sides since more space is 
available.
7. These motors have almost constant speed, high over-load capacity and starting arrangement.
Disadvantages
1. These motors have low starting torque (1.5 to 2 times the full-load torque) with large starting 
current (5 to 9 times the full-load current). Their power factor is also low. 
2. Speed cannot be controlled comfortably.
3. These motor are very sensitive to supply voltage fluctuations.
4. During starting, there is more energy loss in comparison to slip-ring induction motors. 
Therefore these motors are not used where frequent starting is required.

814
Electrical Machines
9.49.2 Slip-ring Induction Motors
Advantages
1. In these motors, external resistance can be added in the rotor circuit at start. Hence heavy 
starting torque at low starting current can be obtained. The maximum torque can be 
obtained at the start by making rotor resistance equal to standstill rotor reactance (i.e.,R2
= X2S).
2. Speed of the motor can be controlled or adjusted as per need by simply inserting external 
resistance in the rotor circuit.
Disadvantages
1. Cost of construction is high comparatively.
2. Rotor copper losses are more in these motors and hence the efficiency is low in comparison 
to squirrel cage induction motors.
3. The size of these motors is larger due to overhang or rotor winding and slip-rings.
4. Repair and maintenance charges of these motors are more because of slip-rings and brushes.
5. Because of overhang of rotor winding and slip-rings larges fans cannot be accommodated 
which affects its cooling.
9.50 Applications of Three-phase Induction Motors
The applications of squirrel cage induction motors and slip-ring (phase wound) induction motors 
are given below:
1. Squirrel cage induction motors: These motors are mechanically robust and are operated 
almost at constant speed. These motors operate at high power factor and have high over load 
capacity. However, these motors have low starting torque. (i.e., these motors cannot pick-up 
heavy loads) and draw heavy current at start. On the bases of these characteristics, these motors 
are best suited for:
(i) Printing machinery 
(ii) Flour mills
(iii) Saw mills 
(iv) Shaft drives of small industries
(v) Pumps

characteristics (advantage) of squirrel cage induction motors and at the same time have the 
ability to pick-up heavy loads at start drawing smaller current from the mains. Accordingly 
these motors are best suited for;
(i) Rolling mills 
(ii) Lifts and hoists

Particulars
Squirrel Cage induction motor
Phase Wound Induction motor
1.
Construction
It is simple in construction and 
mechanically robust.
Its rotor is phase wound which needs 
care.
2.
Cost
It is cheaper in construction cost.
It is more costly.
3.
Maintenance
It requires less maintenance.
Because of slip rings, brushes etc. it 
requires more maintenance.
4.
Utilisation of 
slot space
Space of rotor slots is better utilised since 
rotor conductors are in shape of bars.
Whole of the slots space is not utilised 
since winding is placed in the slots.
5.
Coper losses

low rotor resistance.
It has got more copper losses.
6.
Efficiency
Its efficiency is high.

7.
Cooling
The heat can be dissipated more 
efficiently because the end rings are bare 
thus there is more space for providing a 
cooling fan.
In this case, overhang of the winding 
occupies space and less space is left 
for the provision of a good cooling fan. 
Thus cooling is not quite efficient.
8.
Starting 
torque

due to low resistance which cannot be 
increased by ordinary means.

be added in the rotor circuit at the start 
to improve its starting torque.
9.
Starter
Starters are applied on stator side and 
starting methods are quite simple.
Starter is applied on rotor side through 
sliprings and brush gears.

9.53 Installation of Induction Motors
An electrical engineer must have the general idea regarding the installation and preventive maintenance 
of induction motors. The general information regarding installation and preventive maintenance of 
induction motors is available in the sources like Indian Standards (IS: 900-1965), manufacturers 
manuals, reference books, hand books etc.
Installation of induction motors involves the following points:
1. Inspection of the motor on its arrival and its storage.
2. Section of location for the installation of motor and control gear.
3. Preparation of foundation and arrangement of levelling.
4. Checking for proper alignment.
5. Fitting of loading system (pulleys, couplings etc.)
6. Earthing etc.
1. Inspection of the Motor on its Arrival and its Storage
Unload the wooden crates containing motors with the help of cranes, chain and pulleys, ropes etc. Care 
should be taken that under no circumstances motor be damaged while unloading. After unloading, the 
motor is carried to the storage site. While handling, hook on the frame should be used for its lifting.
Inspection and storage: If there is visible sign of damage on the crate, open delivery from carrier 
be taken and loss/damage certificate be got signed. Otherwise open the crate by keeping the motor 
in upright position with the help of screw drivers, main pullers, pliers, hammers etc. Care should be 
taken that the motor may not be damaged while opening the crate. On opening the crate, the material 
should be checked by comparing it with the packing test. For any type of loss or damage during 
transit the supplier and the insurance company should be informed immediately.

Three-Phase Induction Motors 
817
The motor should be stored in a clean and dry place. After storing, the rotor should be rotated 90° 
and relocked periodically (say every fortnight). If motor is stored at locations susceptible to vibrations, 
rubber pads are provided underneath to avoid stationary indentation.
2. Selection of Location for the Installation of Motor and Control Gear
The following points may be considered while selecting a location for the installation of moto:
(i) The motor should be installed at a place, where sufficient space around the motor is available. 
It will facilitate the movement of operating personal. 
(ii) It should be installed at a place where it is easily accessible for carrying out repair and 
maintenance. Sometimes, the lifting arrangement is also provided with the structure at the 
building.
(iii) The motor and control gear should be installed at a place so that they may not be exposed to 
water, corrosive liquid, oil, steam, metallic dust, dirt etc. However, if it cannot be avoided, the 
motor control gears must be properly enclosed.
3. Preparation of Foundation and Arrangement of Leveling
Depending upon the size of the motor, a strong and rigid cement concrete foundation is provided. The 
foundation block should be at least 20 cm longer and 20 cm wider than the motor feet. The anchor 
or rag bolts which are to hold the motor are embedded in concrete. Their location is determined 
with great accuracy.
Where the motor rests directly on foundation, a great care is needed in leveling the foundation 
otherwise the motor will be strained when the mounting bolts are tightened. After leveling, the 
motor is also carefully aligned with the driven equipment to avoid extra load or strain on the motor.
4. Checking for Proper Alignment
The motor should be properly aligned with the driven equipment to avoid undue loading. The alignment 
is generally checked by free rotation of the motor with or without directly coupled load. Proper 
alignment for direct coupled drives is achieved by ensuring three operations i.e., axial positioning 
of shaft, paralleling of shaft and centering at shaft.
5. Fitting of Loading System
The loading system (pulleys, coupling etc.) is fitted on the motor shaft and is properly aligned so 
that the motor may not be unduly overloaded.
6. Earthing
Each motor frame is connected at two places with two distinct earthing systems. The earth wire 
should have proper size as per the size of the motor.

9.54 Preventive Maintenance of Three-phase Induction Motors
It is always better to prevent faults to occur on the motor than to repair it afterwards. This can only 
be achieved by giving periodic attention to the motor. The periodic attention prevents the faults to 
occur and provides trouble free service for long time.
Some of the important aspects of maintenance of an induction motor are given below:
(i) The motor frame or outer body should be repainted periodically.
(ii) Motor should be cleaned periodically with the help of blowers and vacuum cleaners.
(iii) Motor should be kept dry. The stator and rotor winding should be kept free from oil, grease, 
dampness, dirt, smoke etc.
(iv) Terminals should be kept clean and tight to maintain good connections.
(v) Air-gap between stator and rotor should be kept clean i.e., free from any accumulation of dirt.
(vi) Bearings should be greased in case they make noise. Every three years, bearings should be 
washed with petrol and new grease of good quality be filled.
(vii) Dust, oil, moisture etc., should not be allowed to accumulate on the surface of slip rings and 
brush-gear.
(viii) Spring tension and brush pressure on the slip rings should be checked periodically.
(ix) Insulation of winding should be tested periodically.
(x) To verify the effectiveness of earthing, the earth resistance should be measured periodically.
(xi) The control and switching devices should be cleaned and checked periodically.
Recommended Maintenance Schedule
Refer IS: 900-1965

Introduction
In the previous chapter, it has been found that a 3-phase induction motor is a self-starting motor. 
When a 3-phase supply is given to the 3-phase wound stator of an induction motor, a rotating field 
is developed. By induction, an emf is induced in the rotor conductors, torque develops and rotor 
starts rotating. But, if the motor is directly switched on to the supply, it draws heavy current from 
the mains due to inertia of rotor. Thus, a device is required to limit the inrush flow of current at the 
start, called starter.
Once the motor picks-up speed and takes-up the load, there are many applications where regulated 
speed is required. To fulfil this requirement various means and methods have been devised.
In this chapter, we shall discuss various methods and devices which are used for starting and 
speed control of 3-phase induction motors.

10.1 Necessity of a Starter
The current drawn by a motor from the mains, depends upon the rotor current. The rotor current 
under running condition is given by the expression:
I2 = 
SE

At start slip S = 1, therefore, rotor current.

This current is very large as compared to its full load current. Thus, when a squirrel cage induction 
motor is directly connected to the supply mains, it draws very large current (nearly 5 to 7 times of the 
full load current) from the mains. This heavy current may not be dangerous for the motor because 
it occurs for a short duration of time, but it causes the following affects:
(i) It produces large voltage drop in the distribution lines and thus affects the voltage regulation 
of the supply system.
(ii) It adversely affects the other motors and loads connected to the same lines.
Hence it is not advisable to start large capacity induction motors by direct switching. Rather, such 
motors should be started by means of some starting device known as starter.
The function of a starter is to limit the initial rush of current to a predetermined value.
A starter also has some protective devices to protect the induction motors against over loading.
10.2 Starting Methods of Squirrel Cage Induction Motors
The various starters which are employed to restrict the initial rush of current in squirrel cage induction 
motors are given below:
1. Direct On Line (D.O.L.) Starter; 2. Primary resistance (or inductance) starter; 3. Star/Delta 
Starter; 4. Auto-transformer Starter. 
10.2.1 Direct on Line (D.O.L.) Starter
It is a starter by which the motor is switched ON direct to the supply mains by switching conductor. 
With normal industrial motors this operation results in a heavy rush of current of the order of five to 
seven times of the normal full load current. This high current rapidly decreases as the motor picks 
up speed but it is at a very low power factor and thus tends to disturb the voltage of the supply in the 
distribution lines. For this reason, the supply authorities limit the size of motor upto 5 H.P. which 
can be started by this starter. An automatic D.O.L. Starter is shown in Fig. 10.1.
A direct on line starter essentially consists of a contactor having four normally open (N.O.) contacts 
and a contactor coil also known as no-volt coil or no volt release. There are two push buttons ON
and OFF which are used to start and stop the motor. To protect motor against overload, thermal or 
magnetic over-load coils are connected in each phase.

830
Electrical Machines
Fig. 10.1 Direct-on-line starter
To start the motor, the ON push button (green) is pressed which energies the no-volt coil by 
connecting it across two phases. The no-volt coil pulls its plunger in such a direction that all the 
normally open (NO) contacts are closed and motor is connected across supply through three contacts. 
The fourth contact serves as a hold on contact which keeps the no-volt coil circuit closed even after 
the ON push button is released. To stop the motor, OFF push button (red) is pressed momentarily 
which de-energises the no volt coil opening the main contacts.
When the motor is over loaded, the thermal overload relay contact, connected in the control 
circuit opens thus disconnecting the No-volt relay from the supply. Overload protection is achieved 
by thermal element overload relay.
Torque developed by the motor when started by direct on line starter:
Power developed in the rotor or rotor input = ZT
Rotor copper loss = S u rotor input
= SZT

Also rotor copper loss = 3 I

Where S is the slip, Z is the angular velocity, T is the torque developed, I2 is the rotor current per

10.2.2 Stator Resistance (or Reactance) Starter
In this method, a variable resistor (or inductor) is connected in series with each phase of the stator 
winding of a 3-phase squirrel cage induction motor, as shown in Fig. 10.2.
Fig. 10.2 Stator resistance starter

832
Electrical Machines
Very low voltage is supplied to each phase of the winding at the start by inserting more resistance 
(or inductance) in series with the winding. As the motor picks-up the speed, the resistance (or 
inductance) is taken out of circuit.
Let the voltage applied across each phase be reduced to a fraction of x
Voltage applied across each phase at start = xV
Starting current, ISt = x ISC
Hence, the current is reduced to fraction x.

Starting torque = x2 × torque developed by direct switching.
Merits
(i) Smooth acceleration since the resistance (or inductance) is reduced gradually.
(ii) Simple and less expansive
(iii) Higher pf during starting
Demerits
(i) Current is reduced by a fraction of x but the torque is reduced to fraction x2, hence starting 
torque is poor.
(ii) More energy loss in the resistors, therefore, inductors are preferred. But still loss is more.
(iii) Starting duration is comparatively more.
This method of starting is used very rarely.
10.2.3 Star-Delta Starter
This method is based upon the principle that in star connections, voltage across each winding is 
phase voltage i.e., 1/
3 times the line voltage, whereas the same winding when connected in delta 
will have full line voltage across it. So at start, connections of the motor are made in star fashion so 
that reduced voltage is applied across each winding. After the motor attains speed the same windings 
through a change-over switch, as shown in Fig. 10.3 are connected in delta across the same supply. 
The starter is provided with overload and under voltage protection devices also. Moreover, the starter 
is also provided with a mechanical inter-locking which prevents the handle to put in run position 
first. Simplified connections of a star delta starter are shown in Fig. 10.4.

Starting Methods and Speed Control of Three-Phase Induction Motors 
833
Fig. 10.3 Star-delta starter
Fig. 10.4 Simplified star-delta starter
Since at start stator windings are connected in star connection, so voltage across each phase 
winding is reduced to 1/
3  of line voltage, therefore, starting current/phase becomes equal to
Isc/
3  = Starting line current
Starting line current by direct switching with stator winding connected in delta = 
3 Isc

Thus, it concludes that when a 3-phase motor is started by a star/delta starter, the current drawn 
by it is limited to 1/3rd of the value that it would draw without starter.

Starting torque = 1
3 u torque developed by direct switching
The equation shows that the starting torque developed by the motor when started by star-delta 
starter is also reduced to one-third of the starting torque developed by direct on line switching.
Merits
It is a simple, cheap, effective and most efficient method of starting of squirrel cage induction motors. 
It is the most suitable method of starting for high inertia and long acceleration loads.
However, it suffers from the following demerits.
Demerits
1. All the six terminals of the stator winding are to be brought out to starter through six leads and 
the motor has to be operated in delta.
2. The starting current can only be limited to 1/3rd of the short circuit current.
3. Starting torque developed by the motor is reduced to 1/3rd which is very low to pick the load.
Accordingly, such starters are employed with the squirrel cage induction motors having capacity 
4 kW to 20 kW.
Precautions
To start the motor, the handle is operated to start position i.e., to connect the motor winding in star. 
Keep the handle in this position till the motor picks-up speed to 70% of its rated value. Only after 
that shift the handle to run position (i.e., delta connection), otherwise there will be heavy sparking 
at the starter terminals.
10.2.4 Auto-transformer Starter
In the previous method, the current can only be reduced to 1/3 times the short circuit current. 
Whereas, in this method, the voltage applied across the motor and hence current can be reduced to 
a very low value at the time of start. At the time of start, the motor is connected to supply through 
auto-transformer by a 6 pole double throw switch. When the motor is accelerated to about full speed, 
the operating handle is moved to run position. By this, motor is directly connected to the line as 
shown in Fig. 10.5.
Overload protection and under voltage protection is provided as explained in the first method. 
Although this type of starter is expensive but is most suitable for both the star-connected and 
delta-connected induction motors. It is most suitable for starting of large motor.

Starting Methods and Speed Control of Three-Phase Induction Motors 
835
Fig. 10.5 Auto-transformer starter
Large size motors draw huge amount of current from the mains if they are connected to mains 
without starter. However, if they are connected to the mains through star/delta starter, the current 
is limited to 1/3rd value which is still, so large that it would disturb the other loads connected to 
the same lines. Hence, to limit the initial rush of current to low values auto-transformer starters
are employed. With the help of auto-transformer starters, we can limit the starting current to any 
predetermined value as explained below:
Let the motor be started by an auto transformer having transformation ratio K.
If Isc is the starting current when normal voltage is applied.
Applied voltage to stator at start = KV
Then motor input current Ist = KIsc
Supply current = Primary current of Auto transformer
= K × Secondary current of Auto-transformer
= KKIsc = K2Isc
If 20% (i.e., one-fifth) voltage is applied to the motor through auto-transformer starter, the current 
drawn from the mains is reduced to 1

10.3 Rotor Resistance Starter for Slip Ring Induction Motors
To start a slip ring induction motor, a 3-phase rheostat is connected in series with the rotor circuit 
through brushes as shown in Fig. 10.6. This is called rotor rheostat starter. This is made of three 
separate variable resistors joined together by means of a 3-phase armed handle which forms a star 
point. By moving the handle equal resistance in each phase can be introduced.
Fig. 10.6 3-phase slip-ring induction motor starter
At start, whole of the rheostat resistance is inserted in the rotor circuit and the rotor current is 
reduced to

Correspondingly it reduces the current drawn by the motor from the mains at start.
When the motor picks up speed the external resistance is reduced gradually and ultimately whole 
of the resistance is taken out of circuit and slip rings are short-circuited.
Fig. 10.7 
3-phase slip-ring induction motor starter
By inserting external resistance in the rotor circuit, not only the starting current is reduced but at 
the same time starting torque is increased due to improvement in power factor:

Calculation of Starting Resistance at Various Steps
Assumptions: consider that (i) the motor starts against a constant load or torque and (ii) the rotor 
current fluctuates between fixed maximum and minimum values of current i.e., I2max and I2min
For calculations, consider only one phase of a 3-phase slip-ring induction motor having R2 as rotor 
resistance and X2S as rotor reactance at stand-still, as shown in Fig. 10.8.
Let, 1, 2, …n be the number of studs of the starter
r1, r2 … rn-1 be the resistance of different steps in each phase.
RS1, RS2… RSn be the total resistance per phase in the rotor circuit at stud 1, 2…and n, respectively.

When motor is stationary and handle is moved to stad-1, at that instant slip S1 = 1. The rotor starts

10.4 Speed Control of Induction Motors
The speed of an induction motor is given by the relation
N = Ns (1 – S) or N = 120 f
P
(1 – S)
Hence, the speed of an induction motor depends upon three factors i.e., frequency, slip and number 
of poles for which the motor is wound. It also depends upon the supply voltage. Thus, the speed of 
an induction motor can be controlled by changing or controlling any one of these quantities.

Starting Methods and Speed Control of Three-Phase Induction Motors 
845
10.5 Speed Control by Changing the Slip
The speed of an induction motor can be changed by changing its slip, and the slip can be changed 
(1) by changing the rotor circuit resistance (2) by changing the supply voltage and (3) by injecting 
voltage in the rotor circuit.
10.5.1 Speed Control by Changing the Rotor Circuit Resistance
In the wound type motor the slip may be changed by introducing resistance in the rotor circuit and 
hence speed is changed.
Torque developed in an induction motor is given by the expression:

The torque will remain constant if R
S
2 is constant. For a given torque, the slip at which a motor 
works is proportional to the rotor resistance.
The torque-speed curve (dotted) of a slip ring induction rotor is shown in Fig. 10.9. When an 
external resistance is added in the rotor circuit, speed decreases for the same torque T, so that ratio 
R
S
2 remains constant.
Fig. 10.9 Torque-speed curve when speed is controlled by changing the rotor circuit resistance
The disadvantages of this method of speed control are
(i) Poor efficiency: By the introduction of external resistance in the rotor circuit, there is extra 
power loss (I2
2R) in the rotor circuit which reduces the overall efficiency of the motor.
(ii) Poor speed regulation: When speed of the induction motor is controlled by adding some external 
resistance in the rotor circuit, the change in speed is larger when load on the machine changes 
from one value to the other. Hence the machine operates at a poor regulation.
For illustration, refer to Fig. 10.10. When the rotor resistance is R1 and the load on the machine 
changes from half-load to full-load, the speed of the motor decreases from N1 to N2. However, when 
some resistance is added in the rotor circuit so that its value becomes R2 (i.e., R2 > R1), then the speed 

846
Electrical Machines
changes from N3 to N4 when load on the motor changes from half-load to full-load. It is very clear 
that N3 – N4 is larger than N1 – N2. Hence the machine operates at a poor regulation.
Fig. 10.10 Torque-speed curve representing the effect on maximum torque when speed 
is changed by changing the rotor circuit resistance
10.5.2 Speed Control by Controlling the Supply Voltage
Slip or speed of a motor can also be changed by controlling the voltage fed to the motor. We have 
already seen that the torque developed by the motor is directly proportional to the square of the supply 
voltage. If the supply voltage is decreased, the torque developed by the motor decreases rapidly (T
v V2) and to pick-up the load slip increases or speed decreases.
For illustration, look at Fig. 10.11. At rated voltage and given load, the speed of the motor is N1. If the 
supply voltage is reduced (say to 90%), the speed of the motor decreases to N2 to pick-up the given load.
Fig. 10.11 Torque-speed curve when speed is changed by changing the supply voltage
This method is never used for the speed control of three-phase large induction motors because the 
voltage control devices are very costly and bulky. However, this method is usually employed with 
single-phase induction motors e.g., ceiling fans, etc.

Starting Methods and Speed Control of Three-Phase Induction Motors 
847
10.5.3 Speed Control by Injecting Voltage in the Rotor Circuit 
The speed of an induction motor can also be controlled by injecting a voltage at slip frequency 
directly into the rotor circuit. This method of speed control is discussed in detail in Art.no.10.9. First 
of all, this method was introduced by K.H. Schrage of Sweden and the motor in which this method 
is employed is called Schrage motor. (shall be dealt in detail in the next chapters) If the injected 
emf has a component directly opposite to the rotor induced emf, the motor speed decreases. On the 
other hand, if the injected emf has a component in phase with the rotor induced emf the motor speed 
increases and may rises beyond the synchronous speed.
Now-a-days, Schrage motors are not preferred because of their heavy cost and bulky construction 
but these are still employed in large printing presses like newspaper printing.
10.6 Speed Control by Changing the Supply Frequency
The frequency of the power supply is constant, therefore, to control the speed of an induction motor 
by this method, the induction motor is connected to the alternator operating independently. To control 
the speed, the frequency of the alternator is changed. This is a costly affair.
Recent improvements in the capabilities of controlled rectifiers (SCR) and continued decrease 
in the cost of their manufacturing, it has made it possible to control the speed of induction motor 
by controlling the supply frequency fed to the motor. By this method 5 to 10% of rated speed of 
induction motors can be controlled. However, if the speed is to be controlled beyond this value, the 
motor design has to be changed accordingly.
Further, If the speed of the motor is changed by changing the frequency, to keep the flux level 
constant in the stator core, supply voltage is also changed so that v/f is kept constant.
10.7 Speed Control by Changing the Poles
By means of suitable switch, the stator winding connections can be changed in such a manner that 
the number of stator poles is changed. This changes the actual speed of motor since actual speed of 
the motor is approximately inversely proportional to the number of poles.
By suitable connections one winding can give two different speeds.
Suppose there are four coils per phase. If these are connected in such a way that they carry 
current in same direction then it will form eight poles altogether as shown in Fig. 10.12(a). Now if 
the connections are such that the alternate coils carry current in opposite directions, we get four 
poles altogether as shown in Fig. 10.12(b).
If more than two speeds are required. Two separate winding are housed in same slots and if each 
is arranged to give two speeds then two windings can give four different speeds.
In squirrel cage motors, the rotor poles are adjusted automatically. However, in wound type motors, 
care has to be taken to change the rotor poles accordingly. Moreover, due to flux distribution, the pf 
of the motor is also affected by changing the number of poles to obtain different speeds. If the speed 
is decreased by increasing the number of poles the power factor of the motor decreases.

10.8 Speed Control by Cascade Method
A method of speed control of induction motor involving two or more motors is known as cascade 
method of speed control. The two machines are mechanically coupled with each other, one of them 
must be a slip ring induction motor. Mostly both slip ring motors are used having transformation 
ratio equal to unity. In this case supply is connected to the stator of one of the induction motor and 
the induced emf of the rotor from slip rings is fed to the stator or rotor of the second induction motor, 
as shown in Fig. 10.13.

10.9. Speed Control by Injecting an emf in the Rotor Circuit
In this method, the speed of a 3-phase slip-ring induction motor is controlled by injecting a voltage (or 
emf) in the rotor circuit. While injecting emf in the rotor circuit, we are to take care for its frequency 
which must be the same as that of the rotor frequency of the induction motor. Although there is no 
restriction as to the phase of the injected voltage.

Starting Methods and Speed Control of Three-Phase Induction Motors 
851
If the injected voltage is in phase with the rotor induced emf, it amounts to decrease in the rotor 
resistance, on the other hand, if the injected voltage is in phase opposition to the rotor induced emf, 
it amounts to increase in rotor resistance.
Hence, by changing the phase of the injected emf, which in effect changes the rotor resistance, 
the speed of the motor can be changed.
The following systems are used to control the speed of slip-ring induction motors:
10.9.1 Kramer System of Speed Control
This system of speed control was suggested by Kramer as illustrated below:
It consists of a rotary converter C which converts the low slip frequency AC power into DC. 
This DC power is used to drive a DC shunt motor D mechanically coupled to the main motor M, as 
shown in Fig. 10.14.
Fig. 10.14 Kramer system of speed control
When 3-phase AC supply is given to the main slip-ring induction motor M, an emf at slip frequency 
is induced in the rotor. This emf induced in the rotor at slip frequency is given to the rotary converter 
C through slip. rings. The DC output of rotary converter C is given to DC motor D. Both DC motor 
D and rotary converter C are excited from DC bus-bars (or from exciters). The field of DC motor D
can be regulated which regulates its back emf (Eb) and hence the DC potential at the commutator of 
C which further controls the slip-ring voltage and therefore, the speed of motor M.
This method of speed control is used for the speed control of large motors of capacity 4000 kW 
or above. The major advantage of this method is that any speed, within the working range, can be 
obtained instead of only in two or three steps, as with other methods of speed control.
Another major advantage of this method is that the power factor of the main motor can be improved 
by over-exciting the rotary converter.
10.9.2 Scherbius System of Speed Control
The other method employed to control the speed of large size slip-ring induction motors is scherbius 
system of speed control. In this system, the slip frequency energy is not converted into DC and then 

852
Electrical Machines
fed to a DC motor, rather it is fed directly to a specially designed 3-phase (or 6-phase) commutator 
motor C called a scherbius machine, as shown in Fig. 10.15.
Fig. 10.15 Scherbius system of speed control
The slip frequency emf developed in the rotor of slip-ring induction motor is fed to the poly-
phase winding of scherbius machine C through a regulated transformer RT. The commentator motor 
(scherbius machine) C is a variable speed motor and its speed can be controlled by either varying the 
tapings on regulating transformer RT or by adjusting the position of brusher placed on its commentator. 
Since main motor M is mechanically coupled to scherbius machine hence, the speed of main motor 
is controlled as per need.
This system of speed control of heavy slip-ring induction motors is preferred over Kramer system 
since it is more economical because DC motor is not required in this case. Moreover, it provides 
smooth operation.
Example 10.9
A 3-phase, 4-pole, 50Hz slip-ring induction motor is rotating at a speed of 1440 rpm at full-load. 
Its rotor resistance is 0.25 ohm per phase. What external resistance should be added in the rotor 
circuit to reduce the speed to 1320 rpm, the torque is to be kept the same.

Introduction
Although, 3-phase induction motors are invariably employed in the industry for bulk power conversion 
from electrical to mechanical. But for small power conversions 1-phase induction motors are mostly used.
These motors, usually have output less than one horse-power or one kilowatt, hence are called 
fractional horse-power or fractional kilowatt motors. AC single-phase, fractional kilowatt motors 
perform variety of services in the homes, offices, business concerns, factories etc. Almost in all the 
domestic appliances such as refrigerators, fans, washing machines, hair driers, mixer grinders etc., 
only 1-phase induction motors are employed. In this chapter, we shall focus our attention on the 
general principles, operation and performance of single-phase induction motors.
11.1 Classification of Single-phase Motors
Usually, single-phase motors are built in fractional horse-power range and are called as fractional 
horse-power (FHP) or fractional kilo-watt (FKW) motors. These motors may be classified into the 
following four, basic categories:

11.2 Single-phase Induction Motors
A single-phase induction motor is very similar to a 3-phase squirrel cage induction motor in 
construction. The pictorial disassembled view of a single phase induction motor is shown in Fig. 11.1. 
Similar to 3-phase induction motor it consists of two main parts namely stator and rotor.
Fig. 11.1 Dismantled view of a 1-phase induction motor
1. Stator: It is the stationary part of the motor. It has three main parts, namely. (i) Outer frame, 
(ii) Stator core and (iii) Stator winding.
(i) Outer frame: It is the outer body of the motor. Its function is to support the stator core 
and to protect the inner parts of the machine. Usually, it is made of cost iron.
To place the motor on the foundation, feet are provided in the outer frame as shown in 
Fig. 11.2(a).
Fig. 11.2 Single-phase induction motor 

Single-Phase Motors 
859
(ii) Stator core: The stator core is to carry the alternating magnetic field which produces 
hysteresis and eddy current losses. To minimise these losses high grade silicon steel 
stampings are used to build core. The stampings are assembled under hydraulic pressure 
and are keyed to the outer frame. The stampings are insulated from each other by a thin 
varnish layer. The thickness of the stamping usually varies from 0.3 to 0.5 mm. Slots are 
punched on the inner periphery of the stampings to accommodate stator winding.
(iii) Stator winding: The stator core carries a single phase winding which is usually supplied 
from a single phase AC supply system. The terminals of the winding are connected in 
the terminal box of the machine. The stator of the motor is wound for definite number of 
poles, as per the need of speed.
2. Rotor:It is the rotating part of the motor. A squirrel cage rotor is used in single phase induction 
motors.
It consists of a laminated cylindrical core of some high quality magnetic material. Semi-closed 
circular slots are punched at the outer periphery. Aluminium bar conductors are placed in these 
slots and short circuited at each end by aluminium rings, called short circuiting rings, as shown 
in Fig. 11.2(b). Thus, the rotor winding is permanently short circuited.
The rotor slots are usually not parallel to the shaft but are skewed. Skewing of rotor has the 
following advantages: 
(a) It reduces humming thus ensuring quiet running of a motor,
(b) It results in a smoother torque curves for different positions of the rotor,
(c) It reduces the magnetic locking of the stator and rotor,
(d) It increases the rotor resistance due to the increased length of the rotor bar conductors.
The other miscellaneous parts of a 1-phase induction motor are shaft, bearings, end-rings, fan, 
nut-bolts, etc. as shown in disassembled view of the motor (see Fig. 11.1)
11.3 Nature of Field Produced in Single Phase Induction Motors
The field produced in a single-phase induction motor can be explained by double revolving field 
theory which is given below: 
This theory is based on the “Ferraris Principle” that pulsating field produced in single phase 
motor can be resolved into two components of half the magnitude and rotating in opposite direction 
at the same synchronous speed.
Thus the alternating flux which passes across the air gap of single phase induction motor at stand 
still consists of combination of two fields of same strength which are revolving with same speed, 
one in clockwise direction and the other in anticlockwise direction. The strength of each one of 
these fields will be equal to one half of the maximum field strength of the actual alternating field 
as shown in Fig. 11.3 (a).
Let Im be the pulsating field which has two components each of magnitude Im/2. Both are rotating 
at the same angular speed Zs rad/sec but in opposite direction as shown in Fig. 11.3 (a). The resultant 
of the two fields is Im cosT. This shows that resultant field varies according to cosine of the angle T. 
The wave shape of the resultant field is shown in Fig. 11.3 (b).

860
Electrical Machines
Fig. 11.3 Two field revolving theory
Mathematically
Consider the phasor diagram shown in Fig. 11.3 (a), where two magnetic fluxes each of magnitude 
Im/2 are revolving in opposite direction. At any instant t, the two fluxes have been rotated through 
angle T (T = Zt). To determine the resultant value at this instant, resolve the flux vectors along x-axis
and y-axis;
Total value of flux along x-axis = f

Thus an alternating field can be represented by the two fields each of half the magnitude rotating 
at same angular (synchronous) speed of Zs radians/sec but in opposite direction.
11.4 Torque Produced by Single-phase Induction Motor
The two revolving fields will produce torques in opposite directions. Let the two revolving fields 
be field No. 1 and field No. 2 revolving in clockwise and anticlockwise direction. The clockwise 
field produces torque in clockwise direction, whereas, the anticlockwise field produces torque in 
anticlockwise direction. The clockwise torque is plotted as positive and anticlockwise as negative 
as shown in Fig. 11.4. At stand still, slip for both fields is one. At synchronous speed, for clockwise 
direction, the field-1 will give condition of zero slip but it will give slip = 2 for field No. 2. Similarly, 
at synchronous speed in a counter clockwise direction, will give condition of zero slip for field -2 
but slip = 2 for field No. 1. The resultant torque developed in the rotor is shown by the curve passing 
through zero position as shown in Fig. 11.4.
Now, if we examine the resultant torque it is observed that the starting torque (torque at slip = 1) is 
zero. And except at starting there is always some magnitude of resultant torque, (see at position 1-1c, 
the torque developed by field-1 is dominating, therefore, motor will pick-up the speed in clockwise 
direction, similarly, at position 2-2c, the torque developed by field-2 is dominating, therefore, motor 

Single-Phase Motors 
861
will pick-up the speed in anti-clockwise direction). This shows that if this type of motor is once 
started (rotated) in either direction it will develop torque in that direction and rotor will pick-up the 
required speed.
Fig. 11.4 Graphical representation of torque developed
The above analysis shows that single phase induction motor with single winding develops no 
starting torque but if the rotor is rotated in any direction by some auxiliary means in will develop 
torque in the same direction and will start rotating in that direction. So the problem is to find out 
the auxiliary means to give the starting torque to the motor.
11.5 Equivalent Circuit of Single-phase Induction Motor
The equivalent circuit of a single-phase induction motor may be drawn on the basis of two revolving 
field theory. Accordingly, each of the field is producing emf in the rotor by induction. Therefore, 
a single-phase induction motor may be imagined to have common stator but two rotors revolving 
in opposite directions. Where, each rotor has resistance and reactance half the actual rotor values:
Let R1 be the resistance of stator winding
X1 be the leakage reactance of stator winding
Xm be the total magnetising reactance
Rm be the total magnetising resistance
R2’ be the resistance of rotor referred to stator
X2’ be the reactance of rotor referred to stator
While developing the equivalent circuit, it is considered that the stator is having only one winding. 
The equivalent circuit can be developed under stand-still (at start) and running (operating) conditions.
At Standstill Conditions
At standstill, the motor is considered simply as a transformer with its secondary short-circuited. 
The only difference is that in this case, two fields are considered revolving in opposite direction. 
Therefore, for each field rotor resistance and reactance is considered to be half the value, i.e., R2c/2

862
Electrical Machines
and X2c/2. Moreover, each rotor is associated with half the total magnetising reactance and resistance 
i.e., Xm/2 and Rm/2 respectively.
The equivalent circuit of a single-phase induction motor at standstill is shown in Fig. 11.5(a), Its 
simplified circuit is shown in Fig. 11.5(b) where core loss component Rm has been neglected.

At Running Condition
At running condition, if the rotor is rotating in the direction of the forward revolving field with the 
slip S, the rotor current produced by the forward field will have a frequency Sf. At the same time 
the rotor current produced by the backward field will have a frequency (2-S) f. Accordingly, the 
equivalent circuit of single-phase induction motor at running condition is drawn and shown in Fig. 
11.6(a). Whereas, it is simplified in Fig. 11.6(b) where core loss component Rm has been neglected.

11.6 Rotating Magnetic Field from Two-phase Supply
In case of 3-phase induction motors, we have seen that a revolving field of magnitude 1.5 Im is 
produced in the stator core when 3-phase AC supply is given to its 3-phase stator winding. Similarly, 
a 2-phase balanced AC supply also produces a rotating magnetic field of constant magnitude Im.
Let us see how?
Consider the stator of a 2-pole machine having two phase winding represented by the concentric 
coils a-a’ and b-b’ respectively as shown in Fig. 11.7.
Fig. 11.7 Stotar carrying 2-phase winding
Let a 2-phase supply having wave diagram shown in Fig. 11.8(a) is applied to the stator winding. 
Phase-1 is connected to coil a-a’ and phase-2 is connected to coil b-b’. Alternating currents having 
the same wave shape as that of supply voltage start flowing through the coils and produce their own 
magnetic field Im (each). The phasor diagram of the fields at an instant is shown in Fig. 11.8(b). The 
positive half cycle of the alternating current is considered as inward flow of current [cross in a circle 
³] and negative half cycle as outward flow of current (dot in a circle ±). This abbreviation is marked 
in the start terminals of the two coils i.e., a and b, respectively. Whereas, the direction of flow of 
current is opposite in the other two ends of the coils.

At an instant t1, when T = 0, the flow of current in the start terminal of coil a-a’ i.e., a is zero, 
whereas the start terminal of b-b, i.e., b it is positive. Accordingly, current in terminal a is zero and 
in a’ also zero but in terminal b it is ³, whereas in b’ it is ± as shown in Fig. 11.10(a). The magnetic 
field produced in the stator core at instant t1 is shown in Fig. 11.10(a). Fm represents the direction of

as well as in start terminal of coil b-b; i.e., b is also positive as shown in wave diagram Fig. 11.9(a). 
Accordingly, the direction of flow of current in start terminals of the two coils i.e.,a and b is marked 
as ³ but the flow of current in the finish terminals of the two coils i.e., a’ and b’ is ± as shown in 
Fig. 11.11(a).

At an instant t3, when T = 90°, the flow of current in the start terminal of coil a-a’, i.e., a is positive, 
whereas, in the start terminal, of coil b-b i.e., ‘b’ is zero. Accordingly, current in terminal a is ³ and 
in a’ it is ± whereas, in conductor b and b’ it is zero as shown in Fig. 11.12(a). The magnetic field 
produced in the stator core at an instant t3 is shown in Fig. 11.11(a). Fm represents the direction of

The phasor representation of the resultant field Fm or IR = Im is shown in Fig. 11.12(b). The 
magnitude of the resultant field is Im but it has been rotated through an angle 90° with respect to 
its first position.
Similarly, the position of the axis of the resultant field set-up in the stator at various instants (t4,
t5and t6) are shown in Fig. 11.13, whereas, the phasor representation and magnitude of resultant field 
at various instants (t4, t5 and t6) are shown in Fig. 11.14. Thus, the resultant phasor completes one 
revolution in one cycle.
From the above discussion, it is revealed that when a 2-phase AC supply is given to a 2-phase 
wound stator of a machine, a resultant field of magnitude Im is produced which rotates in the space 
of the stator at synchronous speed NS

11.7 Methods to make Single-phase Induction Motor Self-starting
As discussed, a single-phase induction motor inherently is not self-starting. To make it self-starting, 
some method is required to be evolved to produce a revolving magnetic field in the stator core. This 
may be obtained by converting a single-phase supply into two-phase supply which can be achieved 
by using an additional winding (this additional winding may be or may not be disconnected once 
the motor starts and picks-up the speed) or by creating another field (by induction) using a short 
circuiting band or ring. Accordingly, depending upon the method used to make a 1-phase induction 
motor self-starting, single-phase induction motors can be classified as:
1. Sprit-phase motors: These motors are started by employing two-phase motor action through 
the use of an auxiliary winding called starting winding.
2. Capacitor motors: These motors are started by employing two-phase motor action through 
the use of an auxiliary winding with capacitor.
3. Shaded-pole motors: These motors are started by the interaction of the field produced by a 
shading band or short circuiting ring placed around a portion of the pole structure.
Example 11.3
A single-phase induction motor draws a current of 0.5 A at 230 V and 0.6 lagging p.f. If it runs at 
a speed of 100 radian per second and develops an output torque of 0.3 Nm, find its output power 
and efficiency.
Solution:
Here, V = 230 V; I = 0.5 A; cos I = 0.6 lagging; Z = 100 rad/s
Output torque, T = 0.3 Nm
Output power, Pout = ZT = 100 u 0.3 = 30 W

11.8 Split Phase Motors
Construction
The outer frame and stator core of a split-phase motor is similar to the outer frame and stator core 
of a 3-phase induction motor as shown in Fig. 11.2. It is provided with an auxiliary stator winding 
called starting winding in addition to main winding. These windings are placed in the stator slots. 
Both the windings are put in parallel as shown in Fig. 11.15(a). The purpose is to get two different 
currents sufficiently displaced from each other so that a revolving field is produced. The main winding 
which is highly inductive is connected across the line in the usual manner. The auxiliary or starting 
winding has a greater resistances and lesser reactance as compared to main winding.
The current in the starting winding Is lags the supply voltage by lesser angle Is whereas the current 
in the main winding Im being highly inductive lags the supply voltage by greater angle Im as shown 
in Fig. 11.15(b). The two currents have a phase difference of T° electrical. Thus, a revolving field is 
set-up in the stator and a starting torque is developed in the rotor. 
Fig. 11.15 Split-phase induction motor
Consequently rotor starts rotating and picks up the speed. A centrifugal switch which is normally 
closed is incorporated in series with the starting winding. When the motor attains a speed about 75% 
of synchronous speed, the centrifugal switch is opened automatically with the help of centrifugal 
force and puts the starting winding out of circuit. It is important that the centrifugal switch should 
open otherwise the auxiliary winding being made of thin wire will be over heated and may damage.
Performance and Characteristics
A typical torque speed characteristics are shown in Fig. 11.16, the starting torque is about twice the 
full load torque. The current at start is about 6 to 8 times. The speed falls with increase in load by 
only about 5% to 7% otherwise it is a constant speed motor. Speed is governed by the relation
NS = 120 f
P
rpm
Actual speed is less than synchronous speed NS. For the same weight its rating is about 60% to 
that of the poly phase induction motor. It has lower p.f. and lesser efficiency. P.f. is about 0.6 and 
efficiency is also about 60%.

Fig. 11.16 Torque-speed characteristics of a split-phase induction motor
Applications
As starting torque is not so high so this machine is not used where large starting torque is required. It 
is used for smaller sizes about 0.25 h.p. It is used in washing machines, fans, blowers, wood working 
tools, grinders and various other low starting torque applications.
Reversal of Direction of Rotation
The direction of rotation of a 1-phase (split phase) induction motor can be reversed by reversing 
(interchanging) the connections of either starting winding or running winding.
Example 11.4
The main and starting winding of a 230V, 50 Hz, 190 W, 1750 rpm, resistance split-phase (1-phase) 
induction motor yields the following results when its rotor is blocked:

Starting winding:

Calculate (i) The phase angle between Im and IS
(ii) The locked-rotor current drawn from the lines at 230 V.
Solution:
Here, V = 230 V; f = 50 Hz; N = 1750 rpm
At block rotor, for main winding, Im = 4A; Vsc = 45V; Psc(m) = 120 W
For starting winding, IS = 4A; Vsc = 45V; Psc(s) = 60 W

11.9 Capacitor Motors
It is also a split phase motor. In this motor, a capacitor is connected in series with the starting 
winding. This is an improved form of the above said split phase motor. In these motors, the angular 
displacement between IS and Im can be made nearly 90º and high starting torques can be obtained 
since starting torque is directly proportional to sine of angle T. The capacitor in the starting winding 
may be connected permanently or temporarily. Accordingly, capacitor motors may be
1. Capacitor start motors. 2.Capacitor run motors. 3. Capacitor start and capacitor run motors.
1. Capacitor start motors: In the capacitor start induction motor capacitor C is of large value such 
that the motor will give high starting torque since torque T u sin I and in this case, the phase 
angle between Im and IS is made near to 90°, as shown in Fig. 11.17(b). Capacitor employed is 
of short time duty rating. Capacitor is of electrolytic type. Electrolytic capacitor C is connected 
in series with the starting winding along with centrifugal switch S as shown in Fig. 11.17(a). 
When the motor attains the speed of about 75% of synchronous speed starting winding is cut-
off. The construction of the motor and winding is similar to usual split phase motor. It is used 
where high starting torque is required such as refrigerators.
Fig. 11.17 Capacitor start motor
Performance and characteristics: Speed is almost constant with in 5% slip. This type of 
motor develops high starting torque about 4 to 5 times the full load torque. It draw low starting 
current. A typical torque speed curve is shown in Fig. 11.18. The direction of rotation can be 
changed by interchanging the connection of either starting or running winding.

Electrical Machines
2. Capacitor run motors (fan motors): In these motors, a paper capacitor is permanently connected 
in the starting winding, as shown in Fig. 11.19(a). In this case, electrolytic capacitor cannot be 
used since this type of capacitor is designed only for short time rating and hence cannot be 
permanently connected in the winding. Both main as well as starting winding is of equal rating.
Fig. 11.19: Capacitor run motor
Performance and characteristics. Starting torque is lower about 50 to 100% of full load 
torque. Power factor is improved may be about unity. Efficiency is improved to about 75%. A 
typical characteristics have been shown in Fig. 11.19(b). It is usually used in fans, room coolers, 
portable tools and other domestic and commercial electrical appliances.
3. Capacitor start and capacitor run motors: In this case, two capacitors are used one for 
starting purpose and other for running purpose as shown in Fig. 11.20(a). For starting purpose 
an electrolytic type capacitor (Cs) is used which is disconnected from the supply when the 
motor attains 75% of synchronous speed with the help of centrifugal switch S. Whereas, a paper 
capacitor CR is used for running purpose which remains in the circuit of starting winding during 
running conditions. This type of motor gives best running and starting operation. Starting 
capacitor CS which is of higher value than the value of running capacitor CR.

Performance and characteristics: Such motors operate as two phase motors giving best 
performance and noiseless operation. Starting torque is high, starting current is low and give 
better efficiency and higher p.f. The only disadvantage is high cost. A typical torque speed 
curve is shown in Fig. 11.20(b).

11.10 Shaded Pole Motor
Construction
Shaded pole motor is constructed with salient poles in stator. Each pole has its own exciting winding 
as shown in Fig. 11.22(a). A 1/3rd portion of each pole core is surrounded by a copper strip forming 
a closed loop called the shading band as shown in Figs 11.22(a) and (b). Rotor is usually squirrel 
cage type.
Fig. 11.22 Shaded pole induction motor
When a single phase supply is given to the stator (exciting) winding, it produces alternating flux. 
When the flux is increasing in the pole, a portion of the flux attempts to pass through the shaded 
portion of the pole. This flux induces an emf and hence current in the shading band or copper ring. 
As per Lenz’s law the direction of this current is such that it opposes the cause which produces it i.e.,
increaseof flux in shaded portion. Hence in the beginning, the greater portion of flux passes through 
unshaded side of each pole and resultant lies on unshaded side of the pole. When the flux reaches 

880
Electrical Machines
its maximum value, its rate of change is zero, thereby the emf and hence current in the shading coil 
becomes zero. Flux is uniformly distributed over the pole face and the resultant field lies at the centre 
of the pole. After this the main flux tends to decrease, the emf and hence the current induced in the 
shading coil now tends to increase the flux on the shaded portion of the pole and resultant lies on 
the shaded portion of the pole as shown in Fig. 11.23.
Hence, a revolving field is set up which rotates from unshaded portion of the pole to the shaded 
portion of the pole as marked by the arrow head in Fig. 11.23. Thus, by electromagnetic induction, a 
starting torque develops in the rotor and the rotor starts rotating. After that its rotor picks up the speed.
Performance and Characteristics
A typical speed torque characteristics is shown in Fig. 11.24. The starting torque of this motor is very 
small about 50% of full load torque. Efficiency is low because of continuous power loss in shading 
coil. These motors are used for small fans, electric clocks, gramophones etc.
Its direction of rotation depends upon the position of the shading coil, i.e., which portion of the pole 
is wrapped with shading coil. The direction of rotation is from unshaded portion of the pole to the 
shaded portion. Its direction of rotation cannot be reversed unless the position of the poles is reversed.

11.11 Reluctance Start Motor
The stator of a reluctance start motor is constructed with salient poles. The starting torque is achieved 
by creating non-uniform air-gap of the salient poles as shown in Fig. 11.25. Each pole is excited by 
its own winding carrying the same current. The rotor is usually squirrel cage type.
The non-uniform air-gap between stator poles and rotor offers different reluctance to the magnetic 
lines of force. The flux (IA) set up in the portion having greater air gap will be more in phase with the 
current than the flux (IB) set-up in the portion having smaller air-gap. This can be illustrated more 
clearly by considering two coils one having air-core and the other having iron core as shown in Fig. 
11.27. In air-cored coil, there is no core loss, I lags behind the voltage vector by 90º. This current 
is the magnetising current and sets up field IA in phase with I. Whereas, in iron-cored coil, there 
are core losses, I lags behind the voltage vector by an angle D (less than 90º). This current has two 
components, Ie (energy component) in phase with voltage to meet with losses and Im (magnetising 

Single-Phase Motors 
881
component) in quadrature to voltage vector to set-up field Ii in the core. Hence, field Ii lags behind 
the current vector I by an angle T.
Fig. 11.25 Two-pole reductance 
Fig. 11.26 Flux IAand IB and
start 1-phase motor 
their phasor diagram
Fig. 11.27 Effect of reluctance on the field.
Hence, the fluxes set-up by the two portions of the poles will lag behind the current by different 
angles and are displaced in time from one another. Thus, the resultant magnetic axis will shift across 
the poles from the longer air-gap region to the shorter air-gap region since IA is in more phase with 
current I than IB. Consequently, the rotor starts rotating in the same direction. Once the rotor starts 
rotating, it will continue to rotate like other types of single-phase inductor motors.
It is evident that the direction of rotation of these motors is fixed by the construction (i.e., stator 
poles) and cannot be reversed.
Reluctance-start motors have very small starting torque, low efficiency and poor power factor, 
therefore, their applications are limited. For most of the small power applications, shaded pole motors 
are preferred.
11.12 Single-phase Synchronous Motors
Synchronous motors are constant speed motors which rotate only at synchronous speed. The speed 
depends upon supply frequency and the number of poles for which the machine is designed. It is 
given by the relation

882
Electrical Machines
NS = 120 f
P
rpm
where f = supply frequency in Hz and
P = number of poles of the motor
Single-phase synchronous motors are small, constant speed motors which do not need DC excitation 
and are self-starting. In comparison to fractional kilowatt (fractional H.P.) induction motors, these 
motors are built for wider range of output and speed. These motors are usually built in miniature 
ratings as low as 0.001 kW and are used in clocks, control apparatus, timing devices, CD players etc. 
Single-phase synchronous motors are of two types namely, reluctance motors and hysteresis motors.
11.13 Reluctance Motors
The three-phase as well as single-phase motors can be built with rotors without DC excitation but 
having non-uniform air-gap reluctance. The stator construction of such motors is similar to 3-phase 
or 1-phase induction motors but the shape of squirrel cage rotor of these motors is changes such that 
it has variable magnetic reluctance along the air-gap. The 3-phase induction motors with such rotors 
are usually called synchronous induction motors. However, the single-phase induction motors built 
with a variable air-gap reluctance rotor without DC excitation are called reluctance motors. These 
motors work on the basis of reluctance principle which is explained below:
Reluctance Principle
Consider a piece of magnetic material (iron), free to rotate, placed in a magnetic field as shown in 
Fig. 11.28(a). A torque will act (by the alignment of two fields) on the piece of magnetic material 
(see Fig. 11.28(a)] which will bring it to the position shown in Fig. 11.28(b), so that it offers minimum 
reluctance to the magnetic flux.
Fig. 11.28 Reluctance principle
Construction
The stator of a reluctance motor can be of any type of single-phase induction motor. To obtain starting 
torque, the *stator may have an auxiliary winding with the main winding. The rotor is a modified 
squired cage rotor. The variation of the air-gap reluctance is created either by removing some of the 
rotor teeth or by shaping the rotor stampings as shown in Fig. 11.29 (a) and (b), respectively.

Single-Phase Motors 
883
Fig. 11.29 Rotor stampings of reluctance motor
Working
When supply is given to the stator of a single-phase (split-phase) reluctance motor, a revolving field 
is set-up in the stator. The rotor starts rotating as an induction motor rotor and picks-up the speed 
near to synchronous speed. Then the rotor is pulled into synchronous speed with the stator field since 
reluctance torque is developed at the salient poles which have smaller air-gap reluctance. Thus, the 
rotor starts rotating at synchronous speed once the reluctance torque is developed.
Torque-Speed Characteristics
The torque-speed characteristics of a typical reluctance motor is shown in Fig. 11.30. The motor starts 
at any where from 300 to 400 percent of its full-load torque (depending upon the rotor position of 
the unsymmetrical rotor with respect to the field windings) as a split-phase motor.
Fig. 11.30 Torque-speed curve of reluctance motor
At about 70% of synchronous speed, the starting winding is opened by a centrifugal switch but 
the motor continues to develop a single-phase torque produced by its running winding only. As it 
approaches synchronous speed, the reluctance torque is sufficient to pull the rotor into synchronism 
with stator field. The motor operates as a constant speed, single-phase, non-excited synchronous motor 
upto a little over 200 percent of its full-load torque. If it is loaded beyond the value of synchronous 

884
Electrical Machines
pull-out torque, it will continue to operate as a single-phase induction motor upto over 500 percent 
of its rated torque.
Applications
These motors have constant speed, rugged construction, do not need DC excitation and need minimum 
maintenance. Therefore, these motors find their wide applications in recording instruments, timing 
devices, control apparatus, automatic regulators etc. However, these motors have poor efficiency 
and power factor.
11.14 Hysteresis Motors
A hysteresis motor is a single-phase cylindrical (non-salient pole type) synchronous induction motor. 
The difference between this motor and reluctance motor is in (i) the shape of the rotor and (ii) the 
nature of the torque produced.
Construction
The stator construction of a hysteresis motor is either split-phase type or shaded-pole type which 
produces a revolving field in the stator when single phase AC supply is given to it.
The rotor of hysteresis motor is specially designed and is made of Hysteresis-type laminations 
of the shape shown in Fig. 11.31. These are usually made of hardened high-retentivity steel rather 
than commercial low-retentivity dynamo steel. During operations, the cross arms of the rotor are 
permanently magnetised due to high retentivity of the steel used for its construction.
Fig. 11.31 Rotor stamping of 2-pole Hysteresis motor
Principle and Working
When single-phase supply is given to the stator (split-phase type or shaded pole type), a revolving 
magnetic field is set-up by it. Eddy currents are induced in the rotor. These eddy currents set up the 
rotor magnetic field which causes rotor to rotate. A high starting torque is produced as a result of 
the high rotor resistance (proportional to the hysteresis loss). As the motor approaches synchronous 
speed, the frequency of current reversal in the cross bars decreases and the rotor becomes permanently 
magnetised in one direction through cross-arms as a result of high retentivity of the steel used for 

Single-Phase Motors 
885
the construction of rotor. With the two permanently set field poles, the rotor (shown in Fig. 11.31) 
will develop a speed of 3000 rpm at 50 Hz. Thus, the motor runs as a hysteresis motor on hysteresis 
torque because the rotor is permanently magnetised.
Applications
The amount of torque produced as a result of rotor magnetisation is not as great as reluctance torque. 
But hysteresis torque is extremely steady in both amplitude and phase in spite of fluctuations in 
supply voltage. As a result of this, these motors are extremely popular in driving high-quality cassette 
players, compact disc players, record players, tape recorders, clocks, etc.
11.15 AC Series Motor or Commutator Motor
When a 1-phase AC supply is given to a DC series motor, a unidirectional torque is developed in it. In 
fact, during positive half cycle, same current flows in the series field winding and armature winding 
which develops a torque in one direction (say clockwise). During the negative half cycle, current 
flowing through series field winding is reversed and at the same time current flowing through the 
armature also reverses, therefore, torque is developed in the same direction (i.e., clockwise direction). 
Thus, a continuous rotation is obtained.
Fig. 11.32 AC series motor 
Fig. 11.33 Phesor diagram for AC series motor
Mathematically we know:
Torque in DC series motors, T v Ise Ia where Ise is the series field winding flux and Ia is the 
armature current.
Now when AC supply is given to series motor T v Ise Ia for positive half cycle. For negative half 
cycle T v (– Ise) (– Ia) v Ise Ia. Thus same torque is produced during positive and negative half cycle. 
However, some modifications are necessary in a DC series motor for its satisfactory operation on 
AC which are given below:
1. The iron structure of field and yoke are laminated.
2. The series field winding is so designed that it will produce relatively small mmf as compared 
to DC This is done by reducing the number of turns. The smaller field mmf would result in 
reduced air gap flux. Therefore, in order to develop the necessary torque the number of armature 
conductors have to be increased proportionately.

886
Electrical Machines
3. Increase in armature conductors would result in increased inductive reactance of the armature so 
the net inductive reactance may not be reduced. In order to overcome this difficulty compensating 
winding is connected in series with armature as shown in Fig. 11.32. This completely neutralises 
the inductive effect of the armature winding.
4. The reluctance of the magnetic circuit is reduced to have high flux with reduced mmf So 
magnetic material used should be of high permeability and air gap should be small.
As shown in the vector diagram (Fig. 11.33) large voltage drop occurs in resistance and reactance 
of the armature and field winding. Voltage left for operation is only E.

Performance and Characteristics
The speed-torque characteristic for DC and AC series motors are shown in Fig. 11.34. The torque 
varies as square of the current and the speed varies inversely proportional to the current approximately. 
The efficiency will not be good as that of corresponding DC machine because of greater eddy current 
loss and effects of p.f.
Fig. 11.34 Torque-speed characteristics of DC and AC series motors
These motors have their wide applications where high speed (20000 rpm) is required e.g., mixer 
grinders, blowers, hair dryers, etc.
11.16 Universal Motor
A motor which can be operated on AC as well as on DC supply at the rated voltage is called 
universal motor.
Basically, universal motor is an AC series motor. It is just an improved from of a DC series motor. 
The core size of an universal motor is more than the core size of a DC series motor of the same rating.

Single-Phase Motors 
887
Construction
The motor has two main parts namely.
1. Stator and 2. Rotor
1. Stator. It is the stationary part of the motor. It consists of magnetic frame (or yoke), pole core 
and pole shoe and field or exciting winding as shown in Fig. 11.35.
Fig. 11.35
Side-sectional view of an universal motor
The magnetic frame, pole core and pole shoe are made of silicon steel stampings. The stempings 
are insulated from each other by varnish layer. The hysteresis losses are very small in silicon 
steel and eddy current losses are reduced due to stampings. The field winding made of enamelled 
copper is wound around the poles to produce the required flux.
2. Rotor. It is the rotating part of the motor. It consists of shaft, armature, armature winding and 
commutator, as shown in Fig. 11.36.
Fig. 11.36 Rotor of a universal motor
Shaft is a part of rotor which transfers mechanical power or energy to the load. It is made-up 
of mild steel. Armature is made-up of stempings of silicon steel material since it is to carry 
the magnetic field. It is keyed to the shaft. Slots are cut at its outer periphery to accommodate 
armature winding. The ends of armature winding are braced to the commutator segments. 
Commutator is made-up of wedge shaped segments forming a ring. The wedges are insulated 
from each other by an insulating layer of micanite. The commutator is also keyed to the shaft.
Carbon brushes are pressed over the commutator surface to deliver current to the machine.

888
Electrical Machines
Principle
When a current carrying conductor is placed in the magnetic field, a force is exerted on it and torque 
develops. In other words, when the rotor field produced by the rotor current carrying conductors, 
tries to come in line with the main field, torque develops and rotor rotates.
Working 
The armature winding and stator field winding both are connected in series, as shown in Fig. 
11.37. When 1-phase, AC supply is given to the motor, current flows through the field winding and 
armature winding. The field winding sets up main stator field Fm, and the armature winding sets up 
rotor field Fr as shown in Fig. 11.38. Rotor field Fr tries to align itself with the main field Fm and an 
anticlockwise torque in produced.
During negative half cycle, the direction of flow of current in the field winding as well as in 
the armature winding is reversed, as shown in Fig. 11.39. The two windings set up their fields in 
the direction as shown in Fig. 11.39, again anticlockwise torque is produced in the rotor. Thus, 
unidirectional torque is produced in the motor.
To obtain continuous torque, commutator reverses the direction of flow of current in the coil or 
conductors which cross the magnetic neutral axis (MNA).

Introduction
So for, we have discussed about synchronous machines, induction machines, fractional kW machines 
etc. These machines are the basic machines which are employed at various places as per requirement. 
However, in industries, at commercial places and in houses there are variety of jobs for which these 
general purpose basic machines are not suitable. But these machines with suitable amendments in 
their design can be employed to perform these jobs. Such specially designed machines are called 
special purpose machines.
The machines which are designed specially to perform a particular job are called special purpose 
machines.
12.1 Feedback Control System
A control system which tends to maintain a prescribed relationship between a controlled variable 
and a reference input by comparing relationship between a controlled variable and a reference and 
difference as a means of control is call a feedback control system.
CHAPTER
12

894
Electrical Machines
Electrical feedback control systems rely upon mainly electrical energy for operation. The essential 
of this type of control are (i) an error detecting device, (ii) an amplifier and (iii) an error-correcting 
device as shown in Fig. 12.1. Each one of them serves a functional purpose in matching the controlled 
variable to the reference input.
Fig. 12.1 Feedback control system (Black diagram) 
The error-detecting device determines when the controlled variable is different from the reference 
input. It then sends out on error signal to the amplifier, which is turn supplies power the error 
correcting device changes the controlled variable so that it matches the reference input. The closed 
loop at feedback control system is shown in Fig. 12.1.
Thus, a system in which output is compared with the input and error is used to control the 
operating system is called feedback control system. 
12.2 Servomechanism
The mechanism in which the control variable is adjusted by the error served by comparing output 
and input is called servomechanism.
Any quantity e.g., voltage, speed, temperature, position, direction or torque be controlled by 
providing appropriate feedback. Any quantity can be used as a reference input. Moreover, the 
reference input need not have the same units as the controlled variable provided that the proper error 
detecting device is employed.
When the controlled variable is mechanically positioned or adjusted of its time derivatives, the 
feedback control system is commonly called a servomechanism.
12.3 Servomotors
The motors which respond to the error signal abruptly and accelerate the load quickly are called 
servomotors. Servomotors are usually employed with control system.
Servomotors may be either DC (shunt or series) motors or AC (2-phase) induction motors. DC 
motors are preferred because of their high torque to inertia ratio and high starting torque. On the 
other hand AC motors are known for their reliability and freedom from commutation problems such 
as noise and wearing of brushes etc. Servomotors vary in size from 0.05 HP to 1000 HP.

Special Purpose Machines 
895
The fundamental characteristics to be sought in any servomotor (DC or AC) are
(i) The motor output torque should be proportional to its applied control voltage (developed by the 
amplifier in response to an error signal).
(ii) The direction of the toque is determined by the (instantaneous) polarity of the control voltage.
12.4 DC Servomotors
The DC motors which are employed in the control system are called DC servomotors.
There are four types of DC servomotors which are used in the control system. These are (1) the 
field-controlled shunt motor, (2) the armature controlled shunt motor, (3) the series split-field motor, 
and (4) the permanent-magnet (fixed field excitation) shunt motor.
12.4.1 Field-controlled DC Servomotors
In this motor armature current is always kept constant and the field is excited by the DC error 
amplifier, as shown in Fig. 12.2. The torque produced by the motor is zero when no field excitation 
is supplied by the DC error amplifier. Torque produced by the motor varies directly as the field flux 
and also as the field current up to saturation (T = k I Ia). The direction of the motor (i.e., rotation) is 
reversed if polarity of the field is reversed.
Fig. 12.2 Field control DC servomotor
The control of field current by this method is used only in small servomotors because
(i) it is undesirable to supply a large and fixed armature current as would be required for large DC 
servomotors and
(ii) its dynamic response is slower than the armature-controlled motor because of the longer time 
constant of the highly inductive field circuit.
12.4.2 Armature-controlled DC Servomotors
This servomotor employs a fixed DC field excitation furnished by a constant-current source, as shown 
in Fig. 12.3. As sated, this type of control possesses certain dynamic advantages not possessed by 
the field-control method. A sudden large or small change in armature voltage produced by an error 
signal will cause an almost immediate response in torque because the armature circuit is essentially 
resistive as compared to the highly inductive field circuit.

896
Electrical Machines
Fig. 12.3 Armature control DC servomotor
The field of this motor is normally operated well beyond the knee of the saturation curve to keep 
the torque less sensitive to slight changes in voltage from the constant-current source. In addition, a 
high field flux increases the torque sensitivity to the motor (T = kI Ia) for the same small change in 
armature current. DC motors up to 1000 hp are driven by armature voltage control in this manner. 
If the error signal polarity is reversed, the motor reverses its direction.
12.4.3 Series Split-field DC Servomotors
Small fractional-horsepower, series split-field DC motors may be operated as separately excited 
field-controlled motors, as shown in Fig. 12.4. One winding is called the main winding and the 
other is called the auxiliary winding, although they are generally equal in MMF and are wound 
about the field poles in such a direction as to produce reversal of rotation with respect to each other. 
As shown in Fig. 12.3 the motors may be separately excited, and the armature may be supplied by 
a constant-current source.
Fig. 12.4 Series split-field DC servomotor
The advantages of the split-field method of field control are the (1) the dynamic response of the 
armature is improved since the fields are always excited (there is no delay due to inductive time 
constant) and (2) a finer degree of control is obtained because the direction of rotation is more 
responsive to extremely small differences in current between the main and auxiliary windings.
12.4.4 Permanent-magnet Armature-controlled DC Servomotor
This type of extremely popular servomotor uses permanent magnets (either Alnico or ceramic) for 
constant field excitation, as shown in Fig. 12.5. It is usually manufactured in 6V and 28 V ratings in 
fractional-horsepower sizes and in 150 V rating in integral-horsepower sizes up to 2 hp. The field 

Special Purpose Machines 
897
structure for this type of motor usually consists of Alnico VI alloy, cast in the form of a circular 
ring, completely surrounding the armature and providing a strong, constant flux. The permanent-
magnet motors are well compensated by means of commutating windings to avoid demagnetisation 
of the field magnets whenever the DC armature voltage is suddenly reversed. Eddy currents and 
hysteresis effects in these motors are generally negligible, and the pole pieces are usually laminated 
to reduce arcing at brushes whenever a rapid change of signal voltage occurs. These devices are 
also controlled by armature voltage control in the same manner as the armature-controlled shunt 
motor.
Fig. 12.5 Permanent magnet DC servomotor
The PM DC servomotor is used in two modes of operation: (1) position control and (2) velocity 
control. PM DC servomotors used for position control are sometimes called “torque motors” because 
they develop extremely high torques at standstill or low speeds. Conversely, at high speeds, since, for 
a given horsepower, torque varies inversely as speed the developed torque is extremely small. The 
developed torque is also a function of the voltage applied to the armature.
High speed velocity control servomotors are usually totally enclosed and have large frame sizes 
to permit adequate heat dissipation. Depending on the velocity to be controlled and the torque 
requirements of the load driven, a motor may also require a built-in fan to improve the heat dissipation 
and cool the armature.
12.5 AC Servomotors
The AC motors which are employed in the control system are called AC servomotors.
Along with smaller DC stepping motors, most of the smaller AC servomotors are of the AC two-
phase or the shaded-pole induction motor-type.
Two-phase AC Servomotors
Figure 12.6 shows the schematic diagram of a two-phase servomotor. This motor is a true two-phase 
motor, having two stator windings displaced 90° in space on the stator. The reference windings in 
constantly and usually excited through a capacitor by the fixed AC supply. With no error signal, the 
squirrel-cage rotor is at standstill. A small error signal of some particular instantaneous polarity with 
respect to the reference winding is amplified by the AC amplifier and fed to the control winding. 
Torque i.e., rotation is produced in such a direction so as to reduce the error signal, and the motor 
ceases to rotate when a null (zero error signal) is produced at the control winding.

898
Electrical Machines
Fig. 12.6 Two-phase AC servomotor
Shaded-pole AC Servomotor
The schematic diagram of a shaded-pole servomotor is shown in Fig. 12.7. In this motor, a phase-
sensitive relay is employed to actuate those contacts that will produce a short circuit of the shaded-pole 
winding to develop rotation in the desired direction. As with all shaded-pole windings, a single-
phase AC field winding is connected to the AC supply. In the presence of an error signal sufficient 
to actuate the relay, one pair of shaded-pole windings is shorted; there upon, the servomotor rotates 
until the null is produced (at which point the relay drops out) and the motor stops. An error signal of 
opposite polarity will actuate the phase-sensitive relay to short-circuit a different pair of windings, 
causing rotation of the servomotor in the reverse direction.
Fig. 12.7 
Shaded pole AC servomotor
It is fairly evident that the two-phase motor design of Fig. 12.6 is better of the two types since it 
is capable of responding to small error signals. A shade-pole servomotor will respond only when the 
amplified error signal is of sufficient magnitude to cause the relay to actuate. The response of the 
two-phase servomotor to very small control signals is further improved by reducing the weight and 
inertia of the motor. Shaded-pole AC servomotor
12.6 Schrage motor
The demand of the industry to have a motor of moderate size having desirable features of speed 
control and power factor improvement without the auxiliary devices was met with when K H Schrage
of Sweden developed such a motor and was named as Schrage motor.

Special Purpose Machines 
899
Schrage motor is a motor that contains both power factor correction arrangement and speed 
control in one and the same motor.
These motors are generally built in sizes from 3 hp to 50 hp, however these can also be built in 
large sizes upto 150 hp. But beyond this these are not economical. These motors are designed for 
3-phase, 50 Hz, 400 V supply. A simple diagram of a two-pole Schrage motor is shown in Fig. 12.8. 
Since the position of the brushes placed on commutator can be adjusted to obtain the desired speed, 
therefore, this motor is also known as brush shift AC motor. This motor provides characteristics 
similar to a DC shunt motor, hence it is also called as AC shunt motor.
Construction
The winding or electrical connection diagram of a 2-pole Schrage motor is shown in Fig. 12.8. This 
motor is an inverted wound rotor induction motor in which the rotor winding connected in star or 
delta is the Primary and is supplied from a 3 phase supply through slip rings as shown in Fig. 12.8
The motor has another winding known as compensating or adjusting or regulating winding, 
entirely similar to an ordinary DC armature winding, and is tapped to segments of a commutator 
in the usual manner. The conductors of the regulating or adjusting winding are placed in the same 
slots in which the conductors of the rotor winding or primary winding are housed. The conductors 
of the regulating winding are placed above the conductors of the primary winding as shown in Fig. 
12.9. Brushes held by brush rockers are placed on the surface of the commutator. The stator winding 
forms the secondary and is divided into 3 isolated phases as shown in Fig. 12.9. The two ends of 
each phase of the stator winding are connected to two brushes A and B placed on the commutator 
as shown in Figs. 12.8 and 12.10.
Fig. 12.8 Conventional diagram of Schrage motor
Two sets of brushes (i.e., a set of three A-brushes and a set of three B-brushes) are supported on 
two brush rockers. Each rocker carrying three brushes are located at opposite ends of the commutator 
and are so arranged that they can be rotated relative to each other in either direction by means of 
a hand wheel. Thus by turning the hand wheel one brush rocker or set of brushes moves clockwise 

900
Electrical Machines
and the other moves anticlockwise, thereby allowing the brushes of the two rockers to be displaced 
with respect to each other or to be placed in line with one another. The three brushes of one rocker 
or set of brushes are connected to the respective starts of the three phases of the stator or secondary 
winding, while the finishes of these winding are connected to the corresponding brushes on the 
second rocker or set of brushes.
Fig. 12.9 Slots for stator and rotor
Working
When supply is given to the primary or rotor winding through slip rings, the primary (rotor) current 
will set up a resultant magnetic field which rotates at synchronous speed with respect to the rotor. At 
start this magnetic field rotates at synchronous speed in space. This revolving field induces emfs and 
currents in the secondary. The reaction between the induced secondary currents and the revolving 
magnetic field develops a torque in the same manner as in any induction motor. Because of the fact 
that the secondary winding is in this case embedded in the stator slots, the torque will cause the 
rotor to rotate in a direction opposite to that of the revolving magnetic field. The revolving magnetic 
field itself necessarily continues to rotate at synchronous speed relative to the rotor and consequently 
as the rotor speeds up more and more in the contrary direction, the speed of the magnetic field in 
space decreases more and more and approaches zero as the rotor approaches synchronous speed. In 
general, the magnetic field rotates in space at slip speed in a direction opposite to that of the rotor 
core. From this it follows that the secondary currents and emfs. will be of slip frequency (Sf) just as 
in any induction motor. The adjusting winding will have an emf induced due to transformer action 
from the primary winding provided in the same slots. Hence the frequency of the voltages in both 
the windings is the same as that of the supply. With constant supply voltage, the r.m.s. values of 
induced voltages in the adjusting winding are nearly constant at all loads.
Thus it is concluded that when the primary is fed from the supply, emfs. are induced in the 
regulating winding at supply frequency and as the rotor rotates, emfs. induced in the secondary 
winding are at slip frequency.

Special Purpose Machines 
901
Speed Control by Changing the Brush Position
From the Fig. 12.10 it is clear that for any position of brushes connected to each phase of the secondary, 
there exists a voltage, the value of which depends upon the number of turns of the regulatingwinding 
which is contained between these brushes. This means that at any instant the voltage of the Regulating 
winding between the two brushes is in series with secondary emf The voltage of the regulating winding 
is zero when the two brushes touch the same bar and its value is maximum when the two brushes 
are 180° electrical apart. Thus the magnitude of the voltage of the regulating winding is varied by 
changing the separation between the brushes of the same phase. Thus, voltage of the regulating 
winding in injected into each phase of the secondary winding and if this injected emf is in direct 
opposition to secondary induced emf the speed will be below normal. On the other hand if it is in 
phase with the secondary induced emf will be above normal. There are three possible positions of 
brushes as illustrated in Figs. 12.10 (a), (b) and (c).
Fig. 12.10 Various brush positions for (speed control)
(i) Figure 12.10 (a) shows when the brushes A and B carried by two rockers are in line with one 
another, so that at every instant there will be direct electrical contact through a commutator 
segment. Hence each secondary phase is short circuited and the motor will run like a plain 
induction motor.
In fact, at this instant, there is no regulating voltage injected into the secondary circuit and 
the only emf is due to secondary winding and thus the motor runs at normal speed.
(ii) Figure 12.10 (b) shows when the brushes are opened out. In this case, the regulating voltage 
equivalent to the voltage induced in the turns contained between the brushes A and B is injected 
into each phase of the secondary circuit so that it opposes the secondary induced emf This 
reduces its magnetic effect with the result the speed of the motor decreases.
(iii) Figure 12.10 (c) shows when the brushes are moved apart in the opposite direction i.e., when the 
position of the brushes A and B is reversed. In this case, the regulating voltage will be in phase 
with secondary induced emf The total emf acting in the secondary circuit increases which in 
turn increases the current in the secondary winding thus the motor speed increases.
Hence, it is concluded that if the brushes are separated, regulating voltage will appear between 
the brushes A and B, which is injected into each phase of the secondary winding. This injected 
voltage may aid or oppose the secondary induced voltage, depending upon the direction of shifting 
of brushes. Thus, for any position of the brushes there will be definite speed of rotation either above 
or below synchronous speed. In practice a hand wheel is fitted which operates the brushes in either 
direction through differential gearing.

902
Electrical Machines
Power Factor Control by Changing the Brush Position
Although the magnitude of the emf between the brushes A and B is dependent on their relative angular 
position, the phase of the emf depends upon the position of the centre line with respect to the centre 
of the rotor winding. Hence if the brushes as a whole are moved round the commutator as shown in 
Fig. 12.11 the phase of the emf, injected into the secondary circuit will be varied relative to the rotor 
induced emf and therefore power factor of the motor will be varied.
Fig. 12.11 Various brush positions (pf control)
When the injected emf has a quadrature component which leads the induced rotor emf [as shown 
in Fig. 12.11 (b)] the power factor of the motor will improve and becomes leading.
Hence, the power factor of the motor can also be adjusted by adjusting the position of the brushes 
i.e., by changing the position of brush A and B simultaneously in the same direction.
Conclusion
From the above discussions we conclude that the speed of motor depends on the angular distance 
between the individual brushes A and B while the p.f. depends upon the angular position of the brushes 
as a whole. Owing to the changes in power factor over the speed range where motor is to be used for 
one direction only, the brushes are set to give best p.f. over the whole range. A motor should note be 
reversed without making an adjustment in the setting of the brushes. The power factor is very high 
at speeds above synchronous and relatively low at sub-synchronous speeds. The low power factor 
at reduced speed can be improved by unsymmetrical brush displacement. This can be achieved by 
allowing one brush rocker to move faster than the other, so that the centre line of the brushes is rotated 
round the commutator. Motor which are designed with unsymmetrical brush displacement can be 
run in one direction only, but by a simple reconnection or readjustment of the brushes the direction 
of rotation can be changed. Reversible machines such as crane and hoisting motor, are designed with

12.7 Brushless Synchronous Generator
The elimination of the exciter on the shaft of a synchronous generator eliminates the problems 
associated with commutation (like sparking at the brushes, excessive heating, wear and tear, 
maintenance etc.) of a DC generator. But it is still necessary to supply DC to the field via brushes 
and slip rings. In order to eliminate slip rings and brushes. The brushless synchronous generators
were developed.
A block diagram of one type of brushless synchronous generator is shown in Fig. 12.12. Its 
explanation is given below:

904
Electrical Machines
1. Block-1: It is a stationary part, its main function is to provide the necessary field current (or 
excitation) to the field winding of the auxiliary alternator. The function of each part of this 
block is given below:
(i) Single-phase variac: When 1-phase AC supply is given to variac, it provides variable 
voltage at its output which is fed to a full wave rectifier.
(ii) Full-wave rectifier: It converts AC into DC. As the output of rectifier contains ripples, a 
filter circuit is provided which removes the ripples. Pure DC is fed to a potentio-divider.
(iii) Potentio-divider: By changing the position of jockey, we can change the magnitude of 
field current fed to the field winding of auxiliary alternator.
(iv) Field winding of auxiliary alternator: This winding provides the necessary magnetic field 
so that a required voltage is induced in the armature winding of the auxiliary alternator.
Fig. 12.12 Brushless synchronous generator (block diagram)
2. Block-2: It is a rotating part and is coupled with the prime-mover. Its main function is to provide 
necessary field (or flux) to the main synchronous generator. The function of each section of this 
block is given below: 
(i) Armature of auxiliary alternator: It is a part in which necessary emf is induced. This part, 
ultimately provides the required field current for the field winding of main synchronous 
generator. The output of auxiliary alternator is given to the solid state static DC rectifier.
(ii) Solid state static DC rectifier: It is an electronic circuit containing transistors, SCRs, 
resistors and capacitors. This circuit converts AC into DC which is further fed to the field 
winding of the main synchronous generator.
(iii) Field winding of main synchronous generator: It is a winding which produces the magnetic 
flux. The magnitude of flux produced by it depends upon the current flowing through it. 
The value of this field current can be varied by varying the voltage supplied to rectifier 
in block-1 or by varying the value of potentiometer.
3. Block-3: It is the stationary armature of the main synchronous generator. The three-phase AC 
supply is available at its output terminals.
The above means of controlling the DC field excitation of the synchronous generator does not 
need exciter, slip rings or brushes of any kind.

Special Purpose Machines 
905
The reduced cost and increased reliability of solid state rectifier packages has encouraged a 
variety of brushless generators in the low and medium power ratings in both poly-phase and single-
phase types. This trend is expected to continue because of the advantages such as no commutation 
problems, no sparking and no maintenance on brushes.
12.7.1 Brushless DC Generator
When the output of a brushless synchronous generator is converted into DC with the help of a solid 
state rectifier, the complete set-up is called a brushless DC generator.
12.8 Brushless Synchronous Motor
The elimination of the exciter on the shaft of the synchronous motor eliminated the problems associated 
with commutation of a DC generator and sparking at the brushes connected to the commutator. In 
order to completely eliminate slip rings and brush maintenance, the brushless synchronous motor
was developed.
A block diagram of one type of brushless synchronous motor is shown in Fig. 12.13.
Fig. 12.13 Brushless synchronous motor (block diagram)
This arrangement requires an AC generator (auxiliary alternator) having a stationary DC field 
and a rotating poly-phase armature in which AC voltages are generated. The DC excitation of the 
synchronous motor is controlled by the single-phase variac exciting the stationary DC field of the 
poly-phase alternator, which is on the same rotor shaft as the rotor field of the synchronous motor, 
as shown in Fig. 12.13.
The rotor of the synchronous motor, as shown in Fig. 12.13, carries the alternator armature, the 
static DC control and rectification system, consisting of transistors and SCRs and the rotor field of 
the synchronous motor.
The arrangement shown in Fig. 12.13, provides a means of controlling the DC field excitation of 
a synchronous motor without the need for exciter or slip rings or brushes of any kind.
The reduced cost and increased reliability of solid-state rectifier packages has encouraged a 
variety of brushless synchronous motors in the low to medium horse-power ranges in both poly-phase 

906
Electrical Machines
and single-phase types. This trend is expected to continue because of the advantages of this type 
of motor, i.e., no commutation problems, no sparking, and no maintenance on brushes, as found in 
conventional synchronous motors.
12.9 Three-brush (or Third-brush) Generator
In some types of small generators, particularly those which operate at variable speed, such as 
automobile generators, advantage is taken of armature reaction to regulate the current. If an ordinary 
shunt or compound generator used in an automobile to charge the battery, the generator would be 
lightly loaded at low speeds and too heavily loaded at the higher speeds.
A common method of regulating automobile generators is the third-brush method, in which the 
shunt field is connected between one of the main brushes and a small third brush located between 
the two main brushes. In Fig. 12.14, A is the positive main brush, and B is the negative main brush, 
which is usually grounded to the frame of the car or engine.
Fig. 12.14 Three-brush generator
The auxiliary, or third, brush C is placed at an angle of about 60° from brush B in the direction 
opposite to the direction of rotation. The shunt field is connected between the brush C and the 
positive brush. In Fig. 12.14 (a) the flux through the armature under light-load condition is shown 
diagrammatically. There is negligible armature reaction. The voltage across the field will be 
substantially the emf induced in the conductors connected in series between d and e, which cut the 
flux included between brushes A and C.
If the speed of the generator increases, other factors remaining constant, the emf will increase 
and the generator will deliver a greater current. This current, however, distorts the magnetic field in 
the direction of rotation, as shown in Fig. 12.14 (b). The effect is to transfer the flux from between 
conductors d and e to the region between brushes C and B. Since the total emf between conductors 
d and e, and hence the voltage across the field, is proportional to the flux between conductors d and 
e, the effect of the increased speed will be compensated in part at least by the lesser flux and the 
current will increase only slightly if at all. A study of Fig. 12.14 (b) shows that the current may be 
increased by moving the third brush C in the direction of rotation and the current may be decreased 
by moving if against the direction of rotation.

Special Purpose Machines 
907
When such generators are used to charge batteries, as in automobiles, there should be a cutout 
relay which connects the battery to the generators only after the generator has built up to a voltage 
slightly higher than that of the battery. If the generator shows down, this relay opens when the current 
reverses and begins to flow from battery to generator.
12.10 Brushless DC Motors
A conventional DC motors suffers from the following two major problems:
(i) They require more maintenance and need to replace brushes periodically
(ii) Their operating voltage and speed is limited because of commutation difficulties
To over-come these difficulties, we have to eliminate commentator and brushes.
Thus, a motor that retains the characteristics of a DC motor but eliminates the commutator and 
brushes is called a brushless DC motor.
The brushless DC motors are equipped with electronic circuits and devices which perform the 
same function as that of a mechanical commutator.
Operating Principle
The schematic diagram of a brushless DC motor is shown in Fig. 12.15. It consists of a multi-phase 
winding wound on a non-salient stator and a permanent magnet (PM) rotor. The required voltage 
is applied to the individual phase winding through a sequential switching operation such that the 
necessary commutation is achieved to impart rotation to the motor. The necessary switching operation 
is achieved by using electronic circuit and devices such as transistors, thyristors, etc.

Electrical Machines
Let us see how it operates
When switch S1 is closed, winding-1 is energised, the PM rotor is aligned with its magnetic field. 
When switch S1 is opened and S2 is closed, winding-2 is energised, the PM rotor is aligned with 
its magnetic field and turn through a particular angle. When a number of such phase windings are 
energised sequentially, the rotor rotates.
In such motors, the windings can be designed for required voltage and very high speeds, as high 
as 40000 rpm.
Advantages
(i) Require little or no maintenance
(ii) Have longer operating life
(iii) Less losses, more operating efficiency
(iv) No sparking, hence can be used in the vicinity of combustible fluids and gases.
(v) These are very reliable and efficient (efficiency is more than 75%).
(vi) They are capable to run at very high speeds (more than 40000 rpm)
Disadvantages
(i) More expressive then conventional DC motors
(ii) Additional electronic circuit and devises are required that increases the overall size of the 
machine
Application
Due to high reliability and low maintenance these motors find their applications in aerospace industry. 
satellites, gyroscope and high efficiency robotic system. These motors are also suitable for artificial 
heart pumps, disc drives, video recorders and biomedical fields.
12.11 Stepper Motors
A motor in which the rotor turns in discrete movements is called a stepper motor.
A stepper motor, as its name implies, turns in discrete movements called steps. After the rotor 
makes a step, it stops turning until it receives the next command (or signal).
Principle of Operation
Stepper motor operation can be easily visualised by considering a series of electromagnets or solenoids 
arranged in a circle as shown in Fig. 12.16. When these solenoids are energised in sequence, their 
fields interact with the rotor, causing it to turn either clock wise or counter clockwise, depending 
upon the input commands (or signals). The stepping angle (D) is determined by the design of the 
motor, but it should not be greater than 180° in any case.

Special Purpose Machines 
909
Fig. 12.16 Rotor movement
Types of Stepper Motors
There are two basic types of magnetic stepper motors
(i) Permanent-magnet (PM) stepper motor
(ii) Variable-reluctance (VR) stepper motor.
12.11.1 Permanent-magnet (PM) Stepper Motor
A stepper motor in which rotor is made of permanent magnet having even number of poles is called 
a permanent-magnet (PM) stepper motor.
Construction
The stator of a permanent-magnet stepper motor carries the similar winding as that of a conventional 
two-phase, three-phase or higher poly-phase induction or synchronous motor. The end terminals of 
all the windings are brought out to the terminal box for DC excitations. The rotor of this motor has 
even number of poles made of high retentivity steel alloy (Alnico) producing a multipole permanent 
magnet. Both rotor and stator may employ salient or non-salient pole construction. Usually, the stepper 
motors having small stepping angles are of non-salient pole type construction.
Working
Figure 12.17 (a) shows a typical PM stepper motor. With stator winding A1 – A2 energised only, 
for the polarity shown in Fig. 12.17(b) the PM rotor is “locked” in the position shown. If stator coil 
A1 – A2 is de-energized and B1 – B2 is energised, the polarity of south (S) is produced at B1 and 
north (N) at B2, causing the PM rotor to rotate 90° in response to the excitation torque produced 
by the winding B1 – B2. The excitation torque is maximum when the angle between the PM rotor 
and stator winding is 90°.
Reversing the current in windings A and B, consecutively, in turn, results in continuous clock wise 
rotation of the PM rotor. Instead of reversing the supply voltages feeding each phase, a simplified 
switching arrangement using two solid-state (transistors or thyristors) switches accomplishes the 
current reversals in each phase of the two-phase windings, as shown in Fig. 12.17 (b).

The adjoining table shows the switching sequence for the four-step stepper motor. Note that for 
a two-pole, two-phase stepper, the pole-phase product is 4. If 360° is divided by this product, we 
obtain the stepping length, or stepping angle, for any PM or VR stepper motor.
i.e.,

Since the number of teeth (or poles) on a rotor of given diameter is limited, it might appear 
that the solution to smaller stepping lengths is to increase the number of phases. But, as shown in 
Fig. 12.17 (b), increasing the number of phases (or stacks) results in a corresponding increase in the 
number of solid-state driven circuits. Since increasing the number of phases produces no particular 
performance advantages, steppers are rarely found having more than three phases or stacks.
Finally, if reversal of the stepping motor is desired, the switching steps shown in the table (reading 
from top the bottom) may be reversed by performing the sequences steps 4-3-2-1 (reading from 
bottom to top).
A new type of PM stepper motor has overcome the rotor size and weight problems that limit the 
maximum speed which motor can achieve. The rotor of this new type of stepper motor is a disc 
rather than the more typical cylinder. The rotor is a thin disc made from rare-earth magnetic material 

Special Purpose Machines 
911
(Fig. 12.18). Because the disc is thin, it can be magnetised up to a hundred individual tiny magnets, 
evenly spaced around the edge of the disc. Conventional PM steppers are generally limited to a 
minimum step angle of 30°, for a maximum of 12 steps per revolution. The new thin-disc motors 
are generally half the size of the ordinary stepper motors and weigh 60% less.
Fig. 12.18 Permanent magnet stepper motor
The disc of the stepper motor is supported on a nonmagnetic hub, the disc and hub together form 
the rotor. The disc magnets are polarised with alternating north and south poles, as shown in Fig. 
12.18. A simple C-shaped electromagnet forms the field poles. When one of the phases is energised 
the rotor will align itself with the electromagnetic field generated. Then, when the first phase is 
turned off and the second is turned on, the rotor will turn by one-half of a half (or one-quarter) of a 
rotor pole to align itself with the field from the second phase. So that the rotor keeps turning in the 
same direction, the second phase is turned off and the first phase is turned on again.

12.11.2 Variable-reluctance (VR) Stepper Motor
A stepper motor in which rotor is made of soft iron (low retentivity alloy) having teeth at the outer 
periphery to obtain variable reluctance is called a variable reluctance (VR) stepper motor. 
The essential difference between the VR stepper motor and the PM stepper is that the VRrotor uses 
soft-iron or low-retentivity alloy and the rotor torque is developed as a result of reluctance torque. That 
is, the rotor moves to that position where reluctance is minimised, and air-gap flux is maximised.
Construction
Variable-reluctance (VR) stepper use a ferromagnetic multi-toothed rotor with an electromagnetic 
stator similar to the PM stepper. A typical three-phase design (Fig. 12.19). has 12 stator poles spaced 
30° apart; the rotor has eight poles spaced at 45° intervals.
Fig. 12.19 Variable reluctance stepper motor
Working
The stator poles are energised sequentially by the three-phase winding. When current is supplied 
to phase-1, the rotor teeth closest to the four energised (magnetised) stator poles are pulled into 
alignment. The four remaining rotor teeth align midway between the non-energised reluctance 
between rotor and stator field.
Energising phase-2 produces an identical response. The second set of four stator poles magnetically 
attracts the four nearest rotor teeth, causing the rotor to advance along the path of minimum reluctance 
into a position of alignment. This action is repeated as the stator’s electromagnetic field is sequentially 
shifted around the rotor. Energising the poles in a definite-sequence produces either clockwise or 
counterclockwise stepping motion.

Special Purpose Machines 
913
The exact increment of motion (step angle) is the difference in angular pitch between stator and 
rotor teeth, in this case 30° and 45°, respectively, for a net difference of 15°. The VR stepper’s step 
angles are small, making possible finer resolution that can be obtained with the PM type. Maximum 
stepping rates generally are higher than that in the PM stepper. Also, because of the non-retentive 
rotor, VR steppers do not have detent torque when unenergised.
A typical VR stepper uses a stator with 12 fields. Poles are set about 30° apart and grouped for 
three-phase operation where each phase has four coils set 90° apart. The rotor has eight teeth spaced 
45° apart. VR steppers have a maximum stepping speed of about 18,000 steps/s, much higher than 
the PM stepper can produce. At high speeds, however, the VR stepper tends to overshoot and must 
be damped.
Applications
Stepper motors are often used as output devices for microprocessor-based control system as in paper 
drives on printers and X – Y graphical plotters. For example, (i) in a graphical plotter pen driven 
by X-axis and Y-axis steppers is controlled by a microprocessor whose phase-controlled signals 
operate the drive circuits producing phase currents for each stepper motor. (ii) These motors are also 
used in closed-loop servo-systems, replacing conventional DC servomotors in DC-operated servo-
mechanisms, to position machine tools and valves. (iii) Further, since the signals fed to a stepper 
consist of a digital pulse train (of 0s and 1s), at a given repetition rate, the stepper may also serve as 
a digital-to-analog converter.

12.12 Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM)
Construction
The schematic diagram of a switched reluctance motor (SRM) is shown in Fig. 12.20. Both stator 
and rotor of the motor have salient poles. Exciting coils are placed on the stator poles wherein the 
diametrically opposite coils are connected in series to from a pair of poles. In Fig. 12.20. Four coils 
are grouped to form two phases (or pair of poles) A and B. The laminated stator poles are attached 
to a laminated yoke. The rotor is also laminated and made of some magnetic material.
Operating Principle and Working
The operating principle of a switched reluctance motor is the same as that of a variable reluctance 
motor. When stator coils are energised sequentially with a single pulse, a reluctance torque is developed 
due to the attraction between the rotor and stator poles. To obtain continuous rotation, the position 
of rotor and sensor’s timings are well synchronised (designed). High speeds can be developed by 
using high frequency pulses.

Special Purpose Machines 
915

Switched reluctance motor (SRM)
Advantages
(i) Robust construction since no winding on the rotor or slip-rings are used
(ii) Efficiency is high (about 75%)
(iii) Can be operated at high speeds (10000 to 30000 rpm)
(iv) Also perform well at higher temperatures.
12.13 Linear Induction Motor (LIM)
A conventional induction motor gives a circular motion whereas, a linear induction motor gives a 
linear or translational motion.
Thus, a linear induction motor (LIM) is a motor which gives a linear or translational motion 
instead of rotational motion as is obtained from a conventional induction motor.
Construction
To understand its construction, consider a 3-phase conventional induction motor as shown in Fig. 
12.21(a). Cut it along the axis A A’ and spread out flat as shown in Fig. 12.21(b). The stator winding 
is placed in the stator core called primary, whereas, the rotor short circuited ring or rotor conductor’s 
spread over the rotor core is called secondary. In the linear induction motors the secondary consists 
of a flat aluminium conductor with ferromagnetic core. 
Working
As in case of conventional 3-phase induction motor, when 3-phase supply is given to the stator, a 
resulting rotating flux is produced. Similarly, in case of linear 3-phase induction motor when 3-phase 
supply is given to its primary, a resultant travelling flux is produced which travels from one end 
to the other and repeats the same. EMF or current is induced in the aluminium conductor due to 

916
Electrical Machines
relative motion between the travelling primary field and stationary aluminium conductor or strip. 
BY the interaction of field produced by the secondary and the primary a linear force (or thrust) F
is produced. If the secondary is kept fixed and primary is allowed to move, the force or thrust will 
move the primary in the direction of travelling field.
The linear induction motor (LIM) shown in Fig. 12.21 (b) is called a single-sided linear induction 
motor (SLIM). However, the primary can be placed on both the sides of the secondary, as shown in 
Fig. 12.22(a). then the motor is called double-sided linear induction motor (DLIM)

12.14 Permanent Magnet DC Motors
A permanent magnet (PM) DC motor is similar to an ordinary DC shunt motor, except that its poles 
are made of permanent magnets and no excitation is required for the poles. Although these motors 
can be designed upto 75 hp but their actual field is confined to smaller sizes (fractional hp motors).
Construction
In these motors, the permanent magnets are supported by a cylindrical steel stator which provides an 
easy path for the magnetic flux. The cross-sectional view of a 2-pole permanent magnet DC motor 
is shown in Fig. 12.23. The permanent magnets occupy comparatively less space which reduces the 
overall size of the machine. The armature with conductors in its slots, commentator and brushes, 
etc, are the same as in a conventional DC machine.

918
Electrical Machines
Fig. 12.23 Permanent magnet DC motor
Working
Usually, these motors are operated on 12V (or less) DC supply which may be obtained from batteries 
or rectifiers. When supply is given to the armature, torque develops and motor picks up the speed as 
in ordinary motors. These motors are put directly on line without starter since their stalling torque 
is very high (5 to 6 times full load torque).
The schematic diagram of the motor is shown in Fig. 12.24. It may be noted that, the supply is 
given to the armature and there is no field connections.

The above relation shows that torque-armature current as well as torque-speed characteristics 
fallow the straight line, as shown in Fig. 12.25 
The characteristics of a permanent magnet (PM) DC motor can be changed by changing either
(i) the supply voltage, V or
(ii) resistance of the armature circuit
By changing the supply voltage, the no-load speed NO of the motor is changed without affecting 
the slope of the characteristic, as shown in Fig. 12.26. Accordingly, a set of parallel speed-torque 
characteristics are obtained for a set of supply voltage (V1, V2, V3, …) 
Fig. 12.26 Effect of change in supply voltage 
Fig. 12.27 Effect of change in armature circuit resistance
By change the effective resistance of the armature circuit (inserting some resistance in series with 
the armature), the slope of the speed-torque characteristic changes without affecting the no-load 
speed NO of the motor, as shown in Fig. 12.27..
Salient Features of PM DC Motor
(i) Generally, the size of this motor, for the same rating, is smaller than the excited field wound 
motors.
(ii) Since these motors do not have exciting field winding, losses are reduced and improved efficiency 
is obtained.
(iii) Usually, these motors are used for low voltage (less than 12V) and smaller power rating (0.1 to 
5W).
(iv) Smaller life for small motors which is basically determined by the commutator and brushes 
used. Usually, it is limited to 1000 to 2000 hour.
While designing such motors, a compromise is made between cost, life span and efficiency. Since 
these motors are operated by battery, these are designed for an efficiency of 80%.
Applications
These motors are used for toys, windshield wipers, cordless tools, shavers, portable vacuum cleaners, 
automobile heaters, fans, wheel-chairs etc. For all these applications, millions of small PM DC motors 
with the ratings of 0.1 to 5W, 12 V or less than 12 V are produced every year.

12.15 Induction Generator
A three-phase induction motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. When the same 
machine starts converting mechanical energy in to electrical energy, it is called as an induction 
generator.
Let us see how this condition is achieved (Principle of operation). 
x When 3-phase AC supply in given to the stator winding of a 3-phase wound induction machine, 
a revolving field is produced in the stator core which rotates at synchronous speed. Current is 
induced in the rotor conductors and torque develops by the interaction of rotor and stator fields. 
Rotor starts rotating at a speed less then synchronous speed (machine is acting as a motor).
x Now, if the rotor is accelerated to the synchronous speed by means of a prime mover, the slip 
will become zero and hence the torque will be zero. The rotor current will become zero. The 
machine will just float on the bus-bars. At this stage, the machine is neither receiving any power 
nor delivering any power to the mains.
x If the rotor is further accelerated and the rotor speed is increased more than the synchronous 
speed, the slip will become negative. The rotor conductors will generate current in opposite 
direction since they are cutting stator magnetic field due to relative speed between the rotor 
conductors and the stator revolving field.
x This generated rotor current produces a rotating magnetic field in the rotor which applies thrust 
on to the stator field in opposite direction. Consequently, an emf is generated in the stator winding 
which is larger than the applied voltage and acts in opposite direction. This pushes the current 
to flow out of the machine, thus the machine starts working as an induction generator.
The induction machine working as a generator is not a self-excited machine. In order to develop 
rotating magnetic field, it requires magnetising current and draws reactive power from the mains. 
At the same instant, it supplies active power to the mains as shown in Fig. 12.28, proportional to 
the slip above the synchronous speed. It shows that an induction generator cannot work in isolation 
because it continuously requires reactive power from the supply mains. 
Fig. 12.28 
Induction machine working as a generator
However, the problem can be solved by connecting a capacitor bank to supply reactive power 
equivalent to the reactive power which was earlier supplied by the mains.

Special Purpose Machines 
921
Isolated Induction Generator 
Isolated induction generator is also called a self-excited induction generator. It is called a self-excited 
because in isolation when the rotor of induction generator is rotated at an enough speed, a small 
voltage is generated across the stator terminals due to residual magnetism. This small voltage produces 
current to pass through the capacitor bank connected across the stator terminals. The capacitor bank 
provides the further reactive power for magnetisation.
Fig. 12.29 Induction Generator in Isolated
In induction generators, the reactive power required to establish air-gap flux is provided by a bank 
of capacitors in case of stand-alone system. But is case of grid connected system, the reactive power is 
met by the grid. In case of grid-connected system, the voltage and frequency of the machine is taken 
care by the grid. But in case of stand-alone system, the frequency and voltage of the machine depend 
upon machine parameters, capacitors used for excitation and the type and value of load applied.
Advantages
1. Induction generators do not require commutator and brush arrangement as it is needed for 
synchronous generators and hence these are more rugged.
2. These are more simple in construction (mechanically and electrically) than other generators
Disadvantages
They take quite a large amount of reactive power.
Limitations
The requirement of large amount of reactive power puts limit to its common applications. These are 
only used for some special applications.
Applications
These generators are best suited where rotor speed is varying occasionally such as in wind turbines 
and in micro-hydro power plants

12.16 Submersible Pumps and Motors
A submersible pump or electric submersible pump *(ESP) is a device which has a **hermetically 
sealed motor coupled to a pump body as shown in Fig. 12.30(a). The whole assembly is submerged 
in the fluid or liquid to be pumped. Submersible pumps push fluid to the surface instead of pulling it 
as it is being done in jet pumps. Submersibles are more efficient than jet pumps. The main advantage 
of this type of pump is that it prevents pump cavitation, a problem associated with a high elevation 
difference between pump and the fluid surface.
Fig. 12.30 
Submersible pump and motor assembly
Working Principle of Pump
The submersible pumps used in ESP installations are multistage centrifugal pumps operating in a 
vertical position. Its external view is shown in Fig. 12.30(b). The basic principle of a submersible 
pump is that the surrounding liquid (water or oil) after being subjected to great centrifugal forces 
caused by the high rotational speed of the impeller, lose their kinetic energy in the diffuser where a 
conversion of kinetic energy to pressure energy takes place. This is the main operational mechanism 
of radial and mixed flow pumps.
* ESP means Electric Submersible Pump
** Hermetical real means airtight seal 

Special Purpose Machines 
923
The pump shaft is connected to the gas separator or the protector by a mechanical coupling at 
the bottom of the pump. The surrounding fluid enters the pump through an intake screen and is 
lifted by the pump stages. Other parts include the radial bearings (bushings) distributed along the 
length of the shaft providing radial support to the pump shaft turning at high rotational speeds. An 
optional thrust bearing takes up part of the axial forces arising in the pump but most of those forces 
are absorbed by the protector’s thrust bearing. 
Fig. 12.31 Sectional view of pump
The pump itself is a multi-stage unit, as shown in Fig. 12.31, with the number of stages being 
determined by the work requirements. Each stage consists of a driven impeller and a diffuser which 
directs flow to the next stage of the pump. Pumps come in diameters from 90 mm (3.5 inch) to 254 
mm (10 inch) and their length varies between 1 metre (3 ft) and 8.7 metre (29 ft). The motor used 
to drive the pump is typically a three phase, squirrel cage induction motor, with a nameplate power 
rating in the range 7.5 kW to 560 kW (at 50 or 60 Hz).
The ESP system consists of a number of components that turn a staged series of centrifugal pumps 
to increase the pressure of the well fluid and push it to the surface. The energy to turn the pump 
comes from a high-voltage (3 to 5 kV) alternating-current source to drive a special motor that can 
work at high temperatures of up to 300°F (149°C) and high pressures of up to 5000 psi (34 MPa), 
from deep wells of up to 12000 feet (3.7 km) deep with high energy requirements of up to about 1000 
horsepower (750 kW). ESPs have dramatically lower efficiencies with significant fractions of gas, 

924
Electrical Machines
greater than about 10% volume at the pump intake. Given their high rotational speed of up to 4000 
rpm (67 Hz) and tight clearances, they are not very tolerant of solids such as sand.
Submersible Motor
A submersible pump coupled to a motor, as shown in Fig. 12.30(a), is used to lift fluid (or water) is 
called submersible motor. It may be a single-phase capacitor start capacitor run motor or a 3-phase 
squirrel cage induction motor which is hermetically sealed and coupled to the pump. The size of the 
motor varies from 75 mm (3 inch) to 250 mm (10 inch) in diameter.

12.17 Energy Efficient Motors
There is a large gap between the demand and supply of electrical energy. This gap is widening at the 
rate of 3%. To reduce this gap either we are to increase the generation of electrical energy or we are 
to conserve it. It is very difficult to increase the generation of electrical energy as per the increasing 
demand. Therefore, it is suggested to employ energy efficient electric motors.
For conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy, the basic need of industry is electric 
motors. Electric motors consume around 70% of the total electricity used in the industrial sector. As 
motors are the largest users of electrical energy, even small efficiency improvements can produce 
very large savings across the country. Energy conservation measure taken by individual consumers 
in this direction can improve the national economy and benefit the environment on global scale.
An energy efficient motor produces the same shaft output power but draws less input power 
than a standard motor. Hence energy efficient motor consumes less electricity than comparable 
standards motor.

Special Purpose Machines 
927
Fig. 12.33 Pictorial view of induction motor
Energy-efficient motors, also called premium or high-efficiency motors, are 2 to 8% more efficient 
than standard motors. Motors qualify as “energy-efficient” if they meet or exceed the efficiency 
levels listed in the National Electric Manufacturers Association’s (NEMA’s)
Energy-efficient motors possess their higher performance characteristics because of their improved 
design and more accurate manufacturing tolerances, as mentioned below :
1. More copper, using wire of larger diameter in the stator saves energy by reducing the resistance 
of the stator winding consequently reducing copper losses.
2. Thinner steel laminations, decrease eddy current losses
3. Longer stator, lowers magnetic density and increases cooling capacity. As a result, both magnetic 
and load losses are reduced.
4. Efficient cooling fan design, improves air flow and reduces power required to drive the fan.
5. Premium grade steel core, reduces hysteresis losses.
6. Modified stator slot design, helps to decrease magnetic losses and makes room for larger 
diameter wire.
7. Larger rotor conductor bars and end rings, reduce rotor resistance losses
